JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: STAYING IN L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
THE TRUTH IS, MOST ANGELENOS WOULD RATHER GRIPE THAN SWITCH

AS A RECENT Times poll showed, almost half of all Angelenos are so disenchanted 
with Los Angeles that they have thought of moving out. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, few do. Some have decamped to Northern California, Oregon 
and other nearby states, but their numbers hardly constitute a land rush. 
</P>
<P>
One reason we are reluctant to locate elsewhere, I suspect, is that we are 
afraid that our reputation as laid-back, amoral, greedy and rude will have 
preceded us, and we may find the natives hostile. 
</P>
<P>
Our minorities may contribute to our overcrowding, but they are also victims of 
it. They might prosper in smaller communities elsewhere, but they may fear 
being ostracized not only because they are Angelenos, but also because they are 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle Times columnist Tom Kelly wrote recently about "California jerks" who 
sell their inflated equities and move to the Northwest, where they drive up 
housing prices and otherwise disturb the equanimity of life. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that he came to Seattle from Santa Monica only 14 years ago, Kelly 
wonders whether there is a "statute of limitations" on California jerks, or 
whether, once a jerk, always a jerk. 
</P>
<P>
He suggests that California jerks can ease their entry by making a few 
intermediate stops. If you spend a year in Arkansas, for example, and a couple 
in Iowa, you can really be "from" Iowa. On the other hand, newcomers from the 
nearby states of Idaho, Montana and Oregon are simply "neighbors, and get a 
free ride." 
</P>
<P>
I can understand why Kelly resents Californians coming into Washington and 
ruining the ecology of that wonderland (he is especially worried about the San 
Juan Islands). But, of course, this is a free country, not Russia; Americans 
can move anywhere they like. 
</P>
<P>
I don't like to use that old taunt, "If you don't like it here, why don't you 
go back where you came from?" The Statue of Liberty sheds her grace on all of 
us. "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses ..." and all that. But, 
also, the door opens both ways. If Los Angeles is too crowded, too polluted, 
too dangerous, then why not try Tungsten, Nev., near Rye Patch Reservoir and 
the Humboldt River? 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, I visited Good Thunder, Minn., at the invitation of the 
local publisher. The town was dying. Its young people had gravitated to the big 
city. It was wide-open for exploitation, with rows of empty storefronts and 
plenty of cheap houses. Why don't some of us migrate to Good Thunder and bring 
its economy back? 
</P>
<P>
There is plenty of space out there. What's the matter with Medicine Bow., Wyo., 
near the Freezeout Mountains? Why not try Hardin, Mont., near the Custer 
battlefield? There must be opportunities in Mountain Home, Ida., near the 
Mountain Home Air Force Base. What about Syracuse, Utah, on the Great Salt 
Lake? 
</P>
<P>
Bill Seavey makes a living out of helping city people relocate in small towns. 
He is president of EMIGRANTS (Endangered Metropolitan Inhabitants/Growth 
opponents Resettling in Arcadian Neighborhoods, Towns and Suburbs -- perhaps 
the longest almost-acronym in existence), P.O. Box 1122, Sierra Madre, Calif. 
91024. For $45 a year, members receive their Greener Pastures Gazette 
Newsletter and other publications. 
</P>
<P>
In response to a previous column of mine on moving out, Seavey said: "I, too, 
agree that there are wide-open spaces in the West, and I'm obviously not alone. 
But convincing people to consider relocation is a tough nut. I maintain that 
there is no official encouragement, and that's part of the problem. People need 
support." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe people longing to breathe free should get some official support. It might 
be helpful if the Greater Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce opened a Back to the 
Sticks desk to advise those who want to go elsewhere. They'd probably get 
plenty of cooperation from places such as Buffalo Gap, Tex. (There is also a 
Buffalo Gap in South Dakota, if you're interested.) 
</P>
<P>
Curse it as they will, most people are not likely to leave Los Angeles. Big 
cities, like big celestial bodies, have more gravity than small ones. Besides, 
with all its faults, Los Angeles is probably the freest city in the world. 
</P>
<P>
As for me, I'm staying right here until I'm shot, hit by a car or asphyxiated.

RICHARD EDER: THE SORROW AND THE PITY BALANCED BY POWER AND BEAUTY;

<P>
ABSENT FRIENDS BY FREDERICK BUSCH (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $18.95; 278 PP.) 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
If Frederick Busch wrote about grapes, the birds would eat them off the pages. 
He writes about people, and we rock slightly in their wind as they go by. 
</P>
<P>
Like other prominent American short story writers, his subject is distances of 
all kinds; between mates, lovers, friends, generations, bosses and employees, 
and most of all, between the individual and his or her life. 
</P>
<P>
Busch is not content with revealing the distances. He dramatizes them. His 
characters rail at them, fight them, treat them with passion. They speak 
vividly, bitingly; they are often defeated but rarely resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all the stories in "Absent Friends" are downbeat, but they display a 
living, not a dying fall. Busch surrounds his people with ice, raises their 
temperatures a degree or two above normal and heightens their colors. Some of 
the stories are sardonic; the best are extremely sad. It is the deeper sadness 
that comes out of the plight of people with a talent for happiness. 
</P>
<P>
"Name the Name," perhaps the loveliest, angriest and saddest of the stories, 
lays out a scene of social wreckage: the devastation of a younger generation. 
The narrator is a teacher in a rural district whose job is to give lessons to 
children unable to attend school. 
</P>
<P>
His first visit is to Myrna, a 12-year-old in an advanced state of pregnancy. 
He talks briefly with her mother, worried but unquestioningly loyal. She'd been 
pregnant at about the same age, she recalls; she and her husband will take care 
of the baby so Myrna can go back to being a little girl. And the baby's father? 
</P>
<P>
"No, they're too young. He'll have to live with his own mommy and daddy." It is 
the kind of quiet phrase that Busch is master of; one with a scream hidden in 
it, a scream for a world of lost children. Myrna waves politely as the teacher 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
The visit to Leslie is even more rending. A fearful overdose of pills has put 
her permanently in an intensive care unit, unable to speak and barely to move. 
She communicates by scrawling on an "Invisible Pad." 
</P>
<P>
"How's the spider?" he asks, his customary joking reference to the web of tubes 
that keeps her alive. "Not spider fly," she writes. "Love U." When he tells her 
she must keep up her work, she scrawls "Why?" So, she can go to college, he 
says. "Bologna," she writes. Minutes later, though, she ads, "What college?" 
And, just before he leaves, "Kiss." 
</P>
<P>
The narrator's tone, level and angry, keeps the sorrow of such a story in 
unmoving focus. Leslie is the all-but-unbearable climax; the third visit is a 
mournful passage down from it. It is to the narrator's son, arrested for 
vandalism and facing the prospect of a work camp. 
</P>
<P>
At the end, we hear the question: What have we come to? -- but it is framed in 
the children's gestures: Myrna's wave, Leslie's "Love U" and the son's 
frightened "Dad?" 
</P>
<P>
Not all the stories are as good as "Name the Name," which I think will become a 
classic. Several are wispy vignettes of disappointment and frustration. But the 
tone is rarely less than authentic, and Busch's individual sensibilities are 
almost always linked to some larger social theme. 
</P>
<P>
In "Orbits," the isolation between the generations is strikingly told with a 
visit by a middle-aged couple to the wife's aged parents. They are well off and 
in reasonable health, but they have shrunk inside their pleasant house. Death 
is not far away; the old man, once a charming and successful businessman, has 
put his most amusing recollections on tapes. The four sit on the porch at 
night, listening to this taped immortality. 
</P>
<P>
Busch's dramatizing gives his distances life and power. Sometimes he takes 
dramatic shortcuts, piling on the hypocrisy or clownishness of his hypocrites 
and clowns. In "Ralph the Duck," the satisfying come-uppance of a college 
security guard against a snobbish and lecherous professor becomes a little 
thinner because of the shortcuts. 
</P>
<P>
It is a wry and wiry story, nonetheless, and it begins with one of the splendid 
bits of scene-setting that Busch is so good at. The guard is beginning his day, 
badly: 
</P>
<P>
"I woke up at 5:25 because the dog was vomiting. I carried 75 pounds of heaving 
golden retriever to the door and poured him onto the silver, moonlit snow. 
'Good boy,' I said because he'd done his only trick." 
</P>
<P>
There is another hint of caricature in "From the new World," but it is no more 
than a quirk in an otherwise magisterial and richly textured story. ("Rich" is 
a word that invariably comes up in connection with Busch's writing, but it is a 
tense and disciplined richness.) 
</P>
<P>
The daughter and the estranged son of a wealthy, domineering lawyer come home 
after his death to settle his and their affairs. The son, a film maker, brings 
with him the wife who was the subject of the estrangement. She is black, strong 
and splendid. Her splendor -- a mix of wit, warmth and steel -- contrasts with 
the pinched snobbery of the sister. (Here, perhaps, is the touch of 
caricature.) 
</P>
<P>
Over a long night, all the angers and buried pain of a cold family are made to 
come out. At the end, the son overcomes sorrow and compunction with the help of 
his wife; they sneak away before daybreak. The sister, her knots barely 
loosened, watches from the window, a prisoner still. 
</P>
<P>
There are other memorable stories in the collection; in particular, "North," 
which tells gracefully of the efforts of a shop attendant in a small town to 
escape a meaningless marriage and the male tyranny of her boss. 
</P>
<P>
Busch writes of a general decay of custom and humanity with a fierce 
particularity. His characters are actors in the best sense of the word. The 
lift of a shoulder, the lilt or fury of a voice, chain us to his melancholy 
themes and release us from them at the same time.

AMY'S CHILDREN BY OLGA MASTERS (W. W. NORTON: $16.95; 240 PP.; 0-292-02574-8)

<TEXT>
<P>
In other times, Olga Masters might never have written. The Australian novelist 
came to fiction late in life; the mother of seven children, she took up writing 
in her mid-50s and was dead of cancer within a decade. Masters wrote about 
people who seldom find themselves in stories. Her characters seem to stare back 
at her, like photographic subjects: They wait without vanity to be captured and 
legitimized. 
</P>
<P>
"Amy's Children" and "A Long Time Dying," both available in this country for 
the first time, are tales of blundering lives. In each, the focus is on women: 
wives and daughters turned on the lathe of male inattention, who have every 
reason to give up love but don't. Men disappoint them, die on them, desert 
them, but they seek solace in a coveted object or an offhand exchange. Masters' 
prose offers another kind of consolation, a record so vivid that its fidelity 
seems like a reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
"A Long Time Dying" is a collection of stories, a gallery of family portraits. 
It offers a chronicle of small-town life in the Australian outback that is as 
rich in psychological acuity as in demographic detail. Here we have the spoiled 
Rossmores and the Jusseps who farm their land, fighting off the Depression and 
their neighbors' scorn. Most of the families in the book -- and the book is 
about families -- fall between the Rossmores and the Jusseps on the economic 
scale. But Masters' work is never simply sociological; witness the way she 
evokes poverty, in the expression in a picture of Jesus embarrassed by how 
poorly He's displayed. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the book's finest chapters, "A Haircut on Saturday," a selfish young 
woman takes two children to visit the local widow. Every gesture is a rebuke: 
The children are offered only the fruit that's rotten and made to sit outside 
on the broken stoop. When the young woman calls their father by his first name, 
they bridle at the flirtation. The little girl senses longing in her father's 
reply, witnessing in a glance his discontent with the mother she adores. 
</P>
<P>
Masters' prose has the effect of glimpses caught from a passing train or stolen 
through an open window; surreptitious and all the sweeter for being uninvited, 
undeserved. The short, sudden sentences are like telegraph bursts. They have 
the breathlessness of gossip, giving these tales of exhausted women and 
desperate men a surprising energy. Even the personality of the outback town 
seems to insinuate itself, in sentences spit out with the force of collective 
spite. 
</P>
<P>
In "Not the Marrying Kind," the community preys on the loneliness of a young 
woman, whose unmarried mother abandoned her at birth. When a young man takes a 
sudden interest, she blossoms, protected from ridicule by the unexpected 
promise of love. One day, she opts not to walk past the place she knows he'll 
be waiting. Her fate -- now she will never marry -- seems the inevitable result 
of the route she chose. This is Masters at her best, assigning to negligible 
choices a ravaging consequence. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it is precisely this intensity of scrutiny that makes "Amy's Children" a 
tedious read. The book confirms Masters' skill at miniature. She cannot 
negotiate the larger canvas of a full-scale novel. "Amy's Children" revisits 
the subject and characters of "Not the Marrying Kind," telling the story of a 
woman who deserts her three small daughters. But the book's focus is uncertain, 
and every idle thought or casual introduction threatens to divert the 
narrative. The work is derailed also by erratic shifts of sympathy: Amy's 
eldest daughter is at first the novel's emotional sentry, but by the end of the 
book the dreamy, buffeted Amy has become its center. 
</P>
<P>
In "Amy's Children," Masters' plainness of style is a nuisance, and the lives 
move so slowly that the lack of momentum confirms their insignificance. In "A 
Long Time Dying," she hardly ever goes wrong. Masters makes us see the world 
again, more acutely. In other times, both she and the people she writes about 
might have "sank unwept into oblivion," to borrow George Eliot's phrase. We're 
lucky they have not.

CHANGES IN LATITUDE 
</P>
<P>
An Uncommon Anthropology 
</P>
<P>
by Joana McIntyre Varawa 
</P>
<P>
(Atlantic Monthly Press: 
</P>
<P>
$18.95; 272 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in Chicago and Los Angeles, Joana Varawa was the classic rebel, 
dreaming of exotic Polynesia after her mother told her, "Comb your hair -- you 
look like a Fijian," leaving her marriage (after raising a son) to take a job 
as harbor master in a small Hawaiian town, and leaving the town when she 
learned that a restaurant complex was slated to replace her favorite seaside 
hill. Once making good on her dream of moving to Fiji, however, Varawa realized 
that if she wanted to stay, she would have to become the ultimate conformist, 
learning to appreciate a foreign culture despite her inability to accept her 
own. On one level an account of Varawa's character reversal, "Changes in 
Latitude" also has larger relevance as a book about holding onto self-respect 
despite the loss of familiar moorings and letting go of emotional defenses in 
order to experience the tumultuous feelings that are part and parcel of new 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
Flying to Fiji in search of somewhere "bushy and wild," Varawa arrived in the 
city of Nadi, some place "hot and sticky." Soon, however, several "quietly 
beautiful" Fijian women invited her to their traditional fishing village, where 
she quickly became enmeshed in heated social dramas, with people she hardly 
knew telling her where she could go and with whom she could visit. "You stay 
away from Male, said one suspiciously jealous Fijian woman, "he's no good," but 
Varawa -- reacting much as she had to her mother's advice -- found herself 
attracted to this "fierce, charming man-child." Not long after Male proposes -- 
suggesting, in broken English, that she can help tame his violent temper -- she 
finds herself saying "yes." 
</P>
<P>
Varawa soon discovers that Male cannot change; he often orders his new wife 
around, as is the custom, and resists her attempts to "meddle in his heart . . 
. to teach him that there is no need for that darkness to enter his eyes, the 
darkness that blots out thought and reason." Eventually, though, Varawa 
overcomes her disappointment, moving onto a private island with Male and 
settling into a domestic life "of pots filled with fish soup and sleeping dogs 
and burrowing pigs." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, she stops to envy the simple lives of two pigs she sees mating: 
"I wish my mind were as clear as Miss Oink's, for mine is constantly finding 
fault with and looking for holes in the fabric of perfection that I would call 
love. Oh! just to stand still and half close my eyes and, when finished, lie in 
the shallows cooling my belly or burrow in the cool dirt under the trees, body 
and soul at rest." Most of these pages, though, pay tribute to the beautiful 
complexity of life among Varawa's own species, from the village's surprising 
equality of labor to the cathartic effect of Males anger on their relationship: 
"Culture is a garment that clothes the soul," Varawa writes. "We may never be 
able, or even want, to exchange our cloaks, but what matters is the perception 
of each other's realities, even if the reality is hatred."

Tell Their Story 
</P>
<P>
by Hatsuho Naito 
</P>
<P>
(Kodansha: $18.95; 215 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Strangelove," the movie where a U. S. Air Force base commander attacks 
the Russians because he believes they are conspiring to fluoridate the Free 
World's water, reaches its lunatic height when a bomber pilot bedecked in a 
cowboy hat manages to release an intractable A-bomb by jumping on it and 
gleefully riding it like a bronco. The humor of the scene lay in its absurdity, 
of course, but a similar act was in fact commonplace toward the end of World 
War II, when a desperate Japan began launching its "Okha" planes, little more 
than man-guided missiles. Okha pilots would drink the ritual sake, listen to 
rallying cries cheery enough for a football game ("Keep your eyes open! Peel 
and dive! Go for it!"), and then fly their blasting-powder-filled planes into 
enemy ships at speeds approaching 600 miles per hour. 
</P>
<P>
Like some Muslims today, as Asia scholar Boyd de Mente writes in the 
introduction, the Okha pilots saw death in defense of their country as the 
noblest possible act. As one pilot wrote his parents, "My body will collapse 
like a falling cherry blossom, but my soul will live and protect this land 
forever." Hatsuho Naito, a former Japanese air corps officer who helped 
engineer the Okha, captures the spirits prevailing among the pilots with 
unprecedented intimacy in these pages, though the book's technical passages 
about the Okha's design often fall flat next to Naito's moving stories of a 
bomber crew surviving fiery and icy water after a crash at sea or of a bitter 
vice admiral leading a suicide attack on the enemy six days after Japan's 
surrender. More problematic is Naito's conclusion that the Okha program was 
"futile" and "self-destructive," the conversion of "individual insanity to 
organized insanity," for while certainly abhorrent, the program seemed 
successful in the cold terms of war strategy: The suicide missions killed 
roughly 12,300 U. S. servicemen and wounded about 36,400; all told, however, 
only 3,913 Japanese pilots died. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Naito's claims are highly persuasive, however, such as his argument 
that a single young lieutenant did not design the Okha on his own, as legend 
has it. This argument -- suggesting that the lieutenant was used to deflect 
public criticism -- is one of several in these pages that have already provoked 
strong denunciations from the Japanese government.

THE SILENT WAR 
</P>
<P>
America's Struggle 
</P>
<P>
for World Markets 
</P>
<P>
by Ira C. Magaziner 
</P>
<P>
and Mark Patinkin 
</P>
<P>
(Random House: $19.95; 395 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
The title is apt, for the economic wars shaping world power today are so quiet 
that most Americans do not see the difference between their mental image of an 
America grown stronger at home and abroad under Reagan and the hard realities: 
increasingly dangerous trade imbalances (in 1973, America imported only 9% of 
our goods and exported the same; by 1988 we were importing almost a third of 
all cars, over half of all machine tools, over 65% of all radios, TVs and 
stereos); falling salaries (West Germans who 15 years ago were making 
two-thirds of our average income are now a third ahead); and, of course, 
growing debt (In 1982, the world owed us $140 billion; by early 1988, we owed 
the world $420 billion). 
</P>
<P>
Ira Magaziner's strategy for reversing this decline is essentially the same as 
that propounded in other recent business books -- invest more in long-term 
research and development and implement high technology more quickly -- but his 
arguments have polish and verve, and they don't come merely from 20/20 
hindsight, as is the case with many authors in this genre: In the mid-1970s, 
Magaziner correctly predicted that America would suffer from its failure to 
modernize as quickly as many Asian and European countries. Here, he and his 
journalist co-author take a similar tack, urging American business leaders to 
overcome their fears by illustrating how foreign countries have been profiting 
from slow yielding investments and government-aided research. 
</P>
<P>
"The Silent War" is not immune from the most common problem plaguing the 
business book genre: a tendency for clear writing to become muddled when the 
time comes to suggest specific solutions. The authors call for more research 
funding, but don't suggest funding sources (the great majority of America's 
research and development budget now goes to the military, even though few 
believe that its advances "trickle down" to help civilian technologies); they 
offer no effective solutions on how we can compete with companies based in 
low-wage countries such as Brazil (lauding one General Electric attempt to 
compete with Brazil, they fail to mention that it is $350 million in the red); 
and they devote only one prescriptive paragraph to the delicate subject of 
government intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, though, this is a well-argued guide to reorienting our factories -- 
and our minds -- in order to at least hold our ground in the "silent wars" of 
the 1990s.

ABOUT FACES 
</P>
<P>
The Evolution of the Human Face 
</P>
<P>
by Terry Landau 
</P>
<P>
(Doubleday: $29.95; 294 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
 A clever way of reviewing the latest theories about human physiological and 
psychological development (for the face reflects both our culture and our 
nature), "About Faces" travels back in time to illustrate our ancestors' facial 
features (new reconstruction techniques reveal an alien mien, neither apelike 
nor human) and forward thousands of years, to an age when our eyes and ears 
might have grown larger to reflect their increased importance. TV producer 
Terry Landau sometimes spends too much time reporting the obvious (e.g., "We 
seem to have a mental model for famous faces") and too little examining 
innovations, such as genetic engineering, that are bound to change our visage 
dramatically. She surveys an impressively wide range of thought, though, from 
social scientists who claim that you can judge a person by his or her "cover" 
to Picasso, who would often paint faces from memory alone because he believed 
that the most accurate images lay in the subjectivity of his mind's eye.

TAKING BACK THE PARKS 
</P>

<P>
ARBY FIELDS WAS OFFICIATING at an evening basketball game at Ross Snyder 
Recreation Center in South-Central Los Angeles in January when a group of gang 
members began harassing the players. When Fields, the park recreation director, 
politely asked them to stop, gang members exchanged angry words with him and 
warned him as they left that they were going to "take (him) out." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty minutes later, they tried to make good on their promise, returning to 
the crowded gym with weapons and opening fire on Fields. The "gang-bangers" 
chased the 28-year-old former college football player out the gym and up the 
street but stopped short of killing him when a woman let Fields into her house 
to call for help. 
</P>
<P>
After talking with police that night, Fields locked up the park as usual and 
went home, determined never to step foot in Ross Snyder again. That resolution 
is something he and many park-area residents have in common. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 6 feet (tall) and 225 pounds. I don't look like the kind of guy you push 
around -- but I don't have an 'S' on my chest that ricochets bullets, either," 
says Fields, who subsequently transferred to another park and still has 
nightmares about the attack. "Will it take a (park) director to get murdered 
before they take some measures to deal with the situation?" 
</P>
<P>
Ross Snyder is defaced and crime-ridden and offers few programs to the 
community for which it was built. But Jack Perez, head of the Urban Impact 
Parks task force with the city's Recreation and Parks Department and a 31-year 
department employee, remembers when it was a center of neighborhood life. "The 
parks used to be cared-for things," he says. "There have always been gangs, but 
they knew they couldn't occupy the parks because people were there. We had a 
male presence, even in the most depressed areas of the city. Guys came home 
after work and played basketball with their kids." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles was the "mecca for urban recreation," says Perez, and Ross Snyder, 
on East 41st Street, was a "great place," a park that attracted 25,000 people 
for a Halloween celebration in the years before the Watts riots destroyed the 
Central Avenue businesses that had supported its programs. Even after the 
riots, Ross Snyder was an active park. But that era ended when Proposition 13 
devastated its budget. And across Southern California, parks have seen similar 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
In some neighborhood parks, drug dealers, gangs, vandals and the homeless have 
replaced children on swings. Graffiti and litter have overtaken what were once 
green and pristine oases; equipment has deteriorated, and programs have 
dwindled. In the better neighborhoods, parks that are safe during daylight 
hours become dangerous after dark. And even the city's flagship park, 4017-acre 
Griffith Park, is not immune: In April, five bodies were discovered there in a 
span of 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is particularly bad in Los Angeles and most acute at parks in the 
inner city. Families that once would have used the lawns for a Memorial Day 
picnic or strolled out to escape the heat of a sweltering apartment are afraid 
to let their children out to play there; many adults are afraid to go near the 
parks after dark. 
</P>
<P>
But this fear and frustration have also bred a new activism -- a growing, 
multi-fronted push to take back the parks. 
</P>
<P>
Among recent developments: 
</P>
<P>
* A citywide coalition of more than 60 local community and environmental groups 
formed earlier this year in a first-ever attempt to breathe life back into Los 
Angeles' dying recreation centers and create a citywide advocacy group for a 
better parks system. Called People for Parks, the group hopes to force 
politicians to pay attention to the area's parks and environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
* "100 Men Plus," a group of concerned South-Central Los Angeles residents that 
organized in October, has sponsored park family days and taken part in rallies 
at local parks to help the community "reclaim our parks." 
</P>
<P>
* In Chinatown, community activists have made the tiny Alpine Recreation Center 
one of the city's most-used parks and have been a force behind a new 
$1.5-million gym that will allow the park to expand its programs. 
</P>
<P>
* On the Eastside, the United Neighborhoods Organization is a co-sponsor (along 
with the South-Central Organizing Committee) of the "Safe Harbors" program, 
which works with law enforcement and city agencies to boost park security with 
high-visibility patrols of police and unarmed rangers. 
</P>
<P>
* The rise of open cocaine dealing in MacArthur Park -- only a year after the 
city spent $400,000 to revitalize the park with new lighting and equipment -- 
prompted a community candlelight protest march. 
</P>
<P>
* And the city of Los Angeles is pouring more than $1 million into what it 
calls its Vision Parks program, designed to find ways to resuscitate four urban 
parks and in the process pioneer approaches that can be used in urban parks 
citywide. 
</P>
<P>
So far, in Los Angeles at least, success stories are few and usually reflect 
the tenacity of one person or the organized determination of one neighborhood. 
It is still difficult, organizers admit, to persuade citizens to become 
involved in saving their parks and in untangling the web of problems facing the 
parks system, which include poor security, insufficient funding and an 
overburdened and demoralized parks staff. But increasingly, they feel compelled 
to try. 
</P>
<P>
THE LOS ANGELES parks system began to deteriorate soon after the voters passed 
Proposition 13 in 1978, and the parks soon reflected general changes in the 
city itself, most notably the growth of crime, drugs and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 13 funding cutbacks hit the parks system hard. "Parks and libraries 
were seen as frills by a lot of people who didn't have to rely on them," says 
Barbara Gardner, director of USC's urban affairs program, and budget cutters 
made them prime targets. In 1979-80, the first year to reflect the realities of 
Proposition 13, the Recreation and Parks Department budget shrank by 12% -- 
losing $4.8 million of the $40 million it had spent to run its 350 park 
facilities -- and dwindled steadily thereafter. Two dozen recreation centers 
closed, the department's staff fell from 4,000 to 2,000 employees, programs 
were slashed and park hours were reduced. James E. Hadaway, the department's 
controversial general manager, had divvied up the remaining money by using a 
simple formula: Parks of the same size got the same amount of money. It was, he 
believed, a fair system. 
</P>
<P>
Parks were suddenly thrust into the fund-raising business. If they could come 
up with money from jog-a-thons, local businesses or fees for classes and the 
use of facilities, the city said, they could rehire recreation assistants to 
keep their buildings open evenings and weekends and their programs growing. 
</P>
<P>
The results weren't surprising. Parks in affluent communities, which could 
charge $20 for a class or $3 for a swim, did well. And in the poorer areas, the 
parks -- referred to by planners as Urban Impact Parks -- died out, says Jack 
Foley, a professor in Cal State Northridge's department of leisure studies and 
recreation and a former consultant to the city's Recreation and Parks 
Department. This, he wrote in a recent paper entitled "Leisure Rights Policies 
for Los Angeles' Urban Impact Parks," "could be called a kind of 'recreation 
apartheid,' separated by income, race and ethnic origin." 
</P>
<P>
Parks Commissioner Stan Sanders agrees, calling the city's parks "separate and 
unequal." 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, an informal survey of other local park districts shows that the 
city of Los Angeles was unique in its approach to recreation after Proposition 
13. Many other parks districts, such as those in Anaheim, Glendale and Long 
Beach, faced with similar cutbacks, continued to offer a basic, standardized 
level of programming -- including free classes -- for all segments of the 
community by subsidizing parks according to their needs, not their size. 
</P>
<P>
It was only in the past year and a half, Hadaway says, that he realized, while 
attending a parks convention, that "fair is not equal." As a result of 
increasing public outcry over the disparity between urban and suburban parks, 
the city has begun to distribute resources to Los Angeles parks based on need. 
Last year, the Recreation and Parks Department and the city acknowledged that 
discrepancies exist in the parks system by providing an extra $2.8 million for 
increased maintenance, recreation personnel and security at the 66 Urban Impact 
Parks. 
</P>
<P>
For parks employees, safety is one of the paramount issues. Talk to most 
veteran inner-city park staffers and each has stories to tell about the 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
Emma Ruiz, now director of Toberman Recreation Center in South-Central Los 
Angeles, tells of being knocked down and assaulted by a gang member in broad 
daylight last year at Hoover Park, which she ran until last June. Loren Miller 
Recreation Center director Clarence Palmerremembers being threatened by a 
PCP-crazed gang member with a screwdriver when he ran El Sereno Recreation 
Center in East Los Angeles. And Ralph Jordan, director of Normandie Recreation 
Center, remembers how often he considered carrying his gun to work with him in 
his previous position running Denker Recreation Center near USC. 
</P>
<P>
Reduced park hours, staff and programming -- and the resulting drop in park 
attendance -- have been blamed for the rise in crime, but officials say that in 
many ways, crime in the parks merely reflects the crime problem in the city 
itself. Hadaway points out that half of the city's parks are on gang turf. And, 
says Los Angeles Police Cmdr. Ronald Banks, park police coordinator for the 
LAPD: "With the increase in gang activity and narcotics activity and the 
gradual increase in crime, parks have become more of a focal point of these 
activities than they have in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Although the LAPD does not keep specific statistics on crime in the parks, park 
rangers' records show a steady rise in crimes in most inner-city parks. The 
overall number of incidents in the city's 350 park facilities more than doubled 
from 1987 to 1988, according to Chief City Park Ranger Lucia Ruta. 
</P>
<P>
City officials responded by doubling the number of park rangers in the coming 
year to 50 and giving them limited peace officer status -- a victory won by 
park activists. 
</P>
<P>
BEYOND MAKING the parks safer, there is no consensus about exactly how to make 
them thrive. Each park, activists say, has different needs, but even in 
providing additional funding to the Urban Impact Parks, the city stresses its 
own priorities and requires that each park spend its money in about the same 
way. The typical park will receive an additional $235,000 for refurbishment and 
play equipment, $30,000 for maintenance and security and $30,000 to help expand 
its programs (in the form of 2,600 hours of part-time help) by the end of 1990, 
according to Stephen Klippel, the department's director of finance. 
</P>
<P>
That means that the parks will look more appealing, but parks activists stress 
that it will take more than repainting buildings, installing playground 
equipment and planting grass in the inner-city parks to revive them. 
</P>
<P>
"We are bringing a lot of parks up to a visibly attractive level -- that 
helps," Sanders says. "But it's not enough." 
</P>
<P>
"You can plant and paint forever," USC's Gardner agrees, "but what people need 
are programs. The original concept of public parks was as places to stroll, 
where families would come. But in 1989, parks are the only place to meet very 
important needs of young people. They have to provide recreational services and 
social services and educational functions that nobody else is meeting. So we 
can't hold to the original idea of parks as a lovely place to stroll." Tiny 
Aliso-Pico Recreation Center (see sidebar), for example, thrives despite a lack 
of grass and equipment, attracting community interest with its full roster of 
classes and activities. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, park programs -- and employees -- should be tailored to their 
communities: soccer fields in the predominantly Latino Eastside parks or 
Chinese-speaking recreation assistants in Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
Hadaway agrees that it is vital to get communities to embrace their parks but 
says, "I don't think anyone adequately knows how to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Creative, tenacious individuals within the parks system, however, have found 
ways to reconnect dying parks with their neighborhoods. It took Ralph Jordan 
eight years as director of Denker Recreation Center, one of the city's worst, 
before he saw any progress in reclaiming the now-thriving park. Jordan says at 
first he had to push through 150 to 200 gang members every day to get to his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
When he went home at night, he'd have to take the park's equipment and supplies 
with him to keep them from being stolen. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd lock up at 10 p.m. and go home," recalls Jordan, who was recently 
transferred to Normandie Recreation Center, "and at 10:05, (gang members) would 
be in here having a full party." 
</P>
<P>
Unable to raise any money to hire more staff, and frequently the only park 
employee on duty, Jordan was still able to start a successful adult softball 
league by forging a fragile truce with the local gang and hooking up with local 
black radio stations to try to lure patrons back to his park. 
</P>
<P>
"There were several times when I said, 'To hell with the park; they might as 
well blow it up and build some housing,' " Jordan recalls. "But time brought 
about a change. The key is not to give up. If you've got a safe park, you can 
have good programs." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan is now trying to repeat his success in the Vision Parks program, which 
is experimenting with ways to improve Normandie, Queen Anne, Hoover and 
Toberman parks. He and three of the department's strongest, most motivated 
directors have been promised "everything they want" and mandated to do 
"whatever it takes" to bring area residents back into their parks, Hadaway 
says. The lessons learned will then be applied throughout the system, he says. 
</P>
<P>
But even the Vision Parks directors say they continue to have a hard time 
obtaining the essentials necessary to run their parks. At Toberman, a park 
tucked away near where the southbound Harbor Freeway ramps lead into the 
westbound Santa Monica Freeway, director Ruiz says she still must rely on 
friends and charitable organizations to provide office supplies and materials 
and brings in her own toilet paper, soap and paper towels for the park. "We 
shouldn't have to go out and beg (for supplies)," she says, "but most of us 
(directors) are scavengers and beggars." 
</P>
<P>
Some parks advocates see one alternative to begging in something called the 
Quimby Ordinance. The 1972 city ordinance requires residential developers to 
pay the city an average fee of $1,400 to rehabilitate existing parks or develop 
new parks within a mile and a half of new residential development. This has 
brought such boons as a $5-million recreation facility to Westwood but has 
largely excluded the inner city, which has been skipped by the development 
boom. Although Urban Impact Parks receive general revenue funds that the Quimby 
parks don't, the poorest parks are getting less than their share. Distributing 
the money citywide, activists say, would be more equitable. 
</P>
<P>
Another funding option: bond issues. Buoyed by the success of Proposition 70, 
the statewide ballot proposition last year that raised money for buying and 
developing parkland, local parks groups are considering offering a similar 
proposal to Los Angeles voters. 
</P>
<P>
Specific strategies aside, there's one thing parks advocates agree on: The 
health -- and survival -- of the parks system depends on making parks a 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just our problem, it's the whole city's problem," stresses Rosa 
Manriquez, director of the mid-city Queen Anne Recreation Center. "If we don't 
wake up and reclaim the parks, 20 years from now, someone is going to look at 
this and say, 'My God! What did we do?' "

PORTERHOUSE BLUE 
</P>
<P>
by Tom Sharpe 
</P>
<P>
(Atlantic Monthly Press: $8.95) 
</P>
<P>
 Porterhouse, a venerable Cambridge college, is on the brink of disaster. On 
this point all the quirky British characters that populate this novel agree, 
though the reasons for impending doom are variously construed. A new Master has 
been appointed -- Sir Godber Evans -- who intends to effect change in the 
college; in his view, the ossified system that values the quality of the 
kitchen and the cultivation of rowing skills over academic achievement is 
outmoded. His plans, however, are strenuously opposed by the established 
hierarchy of the school. "We have our faults I daresay but they are not ones I 
would wish to see Sir Godber Evans remedy," says the most conciliatory among 
the conservatives. The ensuing political battle is waged on such arcane 
battlegrounds as High Table and College Council and elicits such sage counsel 
as: "An appearance of open-mindedness has in my experience a tendency to disarm 
the radical left. They seem to feel the need to reciprocate." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Sharpe masters a staggering range of comedic effect, from the bawdy to the 
sublime. In an exchange fit for vaudeville, a student seeking advice on a 
sexual obsession finds himself compelled to describe his problems to the deaf 
chaplain through a megaphone. "Porterhouse Blue" has been filmed as a PBS 
miniseries.

LETTERS TO OLGA 
</P>
<P>
by Vaclav Havel 
</P>
<P>
translated by Paul Wilson 
</P>
<P>
(Henry Holt: $16.95) 
</P>
<P>
 Vaclav Havel, Czech playwright and leading member of the human rights group 
Charter 77, was arrested in Prague during demonstrations in January and 
sentenced to six months in prison -- his third prison term since the 1968 
invasion of his country by the Soviet Union. This volume is a collection of the 
letters he wrote to his wife from prison between June, 1979, and September, 
1982. "Not only were (these letters) my only means of communication with the 
outside world," he writes, "they were my only opportunity for some kind of 
creative expression. I was not allowed to write anything else." As the prison 
authorities forbade letters discussing anything but family matters, Havel 
developed an encoded style, which allowed him to "smuggle more and more general 
comments into the letters." Often, however, his meditative observations of 
simple activities -- passages that could easily pass the censors -- are the 
most revealing, poetic and affecting. He revels, for instance, in the pleasure 
of drinking tea: "I have become a fanatical devotee of Earl Grey, which the 
English tea lover scorns as a perfumed, old-maidish drink. . . . Tea, it seems 
to me, becomes a kind of material symbol of freedom here. When and how I make 
it is entirely up to me. Tea as a sign of private relaxation . . . is a 
substitute for the world of wine rooms, parties, binges . . . something you 
choose yourself and in which you realize your freedom in social terms."

BANANA DIPLOMACY 
</P>
<P>
The Making of American 
</P>
<P>
Policy in Nicaragua 1981-1987 
</P>
<P>
by Roy Gutman 
</P>
<P>
(Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster: $9.95) 
</P>
<P>
 The author, national security correspondent for Newsday, explains that when 
Ronald Reagan became President in 1981, there were in place no American 
policies hostile to Nicaragua. Although the United States had supported the 
Somoza regime, the economic and social ties between the two countries remained 
intact even after the 1979 Sandinista revolution. The Reagan Administration's 
campaign against the Sandinistas therefore had to be made up from scratch. 
Formed without any specific strategy, the blanket anti-Communist mandate 
resulted in what might be called a Keystone Kops style of foreign affairs 
management. Reviewer Peter Davis characterized "Banana Diplomacy" as 
"fascinating and complex, resembling more closely the court intrigues around 
Louis XIV than the conventional policy development of an American presidency."

FALL OUT OF HEAVEN 
</P>
<P>
An Autobiographical Journey 
</P>
<P>
Across Russia 
</P>
<P>
by Alan Cheuse 
</P>
<P>
(Atlantic Monthly Press: $7.95) 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, novelist and NPR commentator Alan Cheuse traveled across the Soviet 
Union with his son on a sort of pilgrimage, seeking out the places his father, 
Philip Kaplan, had known. The story of this voyage is braided with tales of 
Kaplan's romantic and adventuresome youth (he was in the Red Army Air Force), 
told in the first person. The third interwoven strand is the author's 
recollections of a difficult father-son relationship in Kaplan's 
far-from-heroic later life as an immigrant auto worker. Jonathan Kirsch's 
review called "Fall Out of Heaven" "a celebration of the belated intimacy of 
father and son which is achieved, tragically but also triumphantly, only after 
death."

 Winner of the Flannery O'Connor Award for Short Fiction and the Carl Sandburg 
Literary Arts Award, "Spirit Seizures" contains short stories with a cast of 
broken, thwarted, despairing characters. Melissa Pritchard writes an unbalanced 
style, often lurching from first person to third within a story, and takes a 
merciless distance on her subjects, who observe each other closely but without 
connection or concern for each other. In "A Man Around the House," a woman 
confined to a wheelchair recalls the man who lodged for a few days at their 
house: "His handwriting made me queasy. No man worth his salt writes with such 
fat female letters." Later, when the suspicious character murders her sister 
and robs them, she muses detachedly: "I hope she had some happiness before he 
killed her anyway."

ENDPAPERS: THE NATURAL PROPORTIONS OF THE WELL-MADE BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC GILL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A book is a thing to be read -- we all start with that -- and we will assume 
that the reader is a sensitive as well as a sensible person. Now, the first 
thing to be noticed is that it is the act of reading and the circumstances of 
that act that determine the size of the book and the kind of type used; the 
reading, not what is read. A good type is suitable for any and every book, and 
the size of a book is regulated not by what is in it but by the fact that it is 
read held in the hand (e.g. a novel), or at a table (e.g., books of history or 
reference with maps or other necessarily large illustrations), or at a desk or 
lectern (e.g., a missal or a choir book), or kept in the pocket (e.g. a prayer 
book or a travelers' dictionary). 
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, some hold that size of books and style of type should be 
specially chosen for every book; that such and such a size is suitable for 
Shakespeare; such and such for H. G. Wells' novels, such and such for T. S. 
Eliot's poems; that the type suitable for one is not suitable for another; that 
elegant poetry should have elegant type, and the rough- hacked style of Walt 
Whitman a rough-hacked style of letter; that reprints of Sir Thomas Malory 
should be printed in "Black Letter" and books of technology in "sans-serif." 
There is a certain plausibility in all this, and even a certain reasonableness. 
The undignified typography of the Daily Mail Year Book is certainly unsuitable 
for the Bible; a fine italic might be suitable for Milton but unsuitable for 
"Tono-Bungay" (a novel by H. G. Wells); sans-serif may be suitable for a 
translation of Jean Cocteau but might be unsuitable for a pocket prayer book. 
And as to size: it is impossible to print the Bible on too grand a scale, but 
third-rate verse might look and be absurd in a book requiring a lectern to hold 
it. Nevertheless, the reasonable producer of books starts with the principle 
that it is the reading, not the reading matter, which determines the size of 
book and style of type; the other considerations come in only as modifying 
influences. In planning a book, the first questions are: Who is going to read 
this, and under what circumstances? 
</P>
<P>
If, then, there are normally four sizes of books, it would seem that there 
should be four sizes of type. A pocket book demands small type, say 8-point 
(Editor's note: The text you are reading is set in 8.5-point type), for reasons 
of space. A book held in the hand demands type of about 10 or 12 points on 
account of the length of the human arm and the normal power of human eyesight, 
assuming a normally legible type. Table books and lectern books, normally read 
further from the eye, demand types of still larger sizes, say 14- or 18-point 
or over. But the sizes of types named here are not binding on anybody; it is 
only the principle we are concerned with. 
</P>
<P>
The proportions of books were formerly determined by the sizes of printing 
papers. These were always oblong in shape (probably because this was the shape 
most easily handled by the makers, or, perhaps, because the skins of animals 
used for writing on in medieval times are of this shape, and so books followed 
suit) and when folded in half and in half again and so on, made a narrow folio, 
a wide quarto, a narrow octavo, etc. But with the machine-made papers now 
almost universally used, these proportions are only retained by custom, the 
width of the web of paper and the direction of the grain being the only 
determining factors. 
</P>
<P>
Books printed on machine-made paper can, these factors understood, be of any 
shape that pleases you. And thus the commercial book designer is, to a greater 
degree than his predecessor, released from the thraldom of any considerations 
but that of what will sell. 
</P>
<P>
As to what does or should sell, we may say that the things that should form the 
shape and proportions of the page are the hand and the eye; the hand because 
books of wide proportions are unwieldy to hold, and the eye because lines of 
more than 10-12 words are awkward to read. (With longer lines, set solid, i.e. 
without leads (spaces) between them, there is difficulty in following from one 
line to the next, and, even if the type be leaded, a long line necessitates a 
distinctly felt muscular movement of the eye and, in extreme cases, of the 
head.) As to the height of a page, this again is governed by the needs of hand 
and eye; a very tall page necessitates either a distinct movement of the neck 
of the reader or a changing of the angle at which the book is held in the hand, 
and such things are simply a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
It may be that there are other considerations than those of physical 
convenience that have helped to determine the normal octavo page; it may be 
that such a proportion is intrinsically pleasing to the human mind. It is, 
however, sufficient for us to see that there is a physical reasonableness in 
this proportion, and we may safely leave the discovery of other reasons to 
professional aestheticians. 
</P>
<P>
The shape of the page being given, it remains to discover the best proportions 
for the lines and mass of type printed upon it. Here again physical 
considerations are a sufficient guide. Two things are to be thought of: the 
type and the margins. 
</P>
<P>
Let us consider the margins first. The inner margin exists simply to separate a 
page from the one opposite to it, and need be no wider than is enough to keep 
the printed words clear of the bend of the paper where it is sewn in binding. 
The top margin, again, needs only to be sufficiently wide to isolate the type 
from the surrounding landscape of furniture and carpets (just as a "mount" or 
frame is used by painters to isolate a picture from wallpaper, etc.). On the 
other hand, the outer and bottom margins need more width than is required for 
mere isolation, for it is by these margins that the book is held in the hand; 
enough must be allowed for thumbs, and the bottom margins need more than the 
side or outer ones. 
</P>
<P>
These physical considerations being allowed for, we may now consider the 
margins in relation to one another, and it will be seen at once that, taking 
one page at a time, i. e. half the "opening," slightly more must be allowed to 
the top margin than is required for mere isolation; for if you make the top and 
inner margins equally narrow, the outer margin wide and the bottom still wider, 
the text will appear to be being pushed off the top. We may say then that the 
general rule should be: a narrow inner margin, a slightly wider top margin, an 
outer margin at least double the inner, and a bottom slightly wider than the 
others; the exact proportions being left to the judgment of the printer. 
</P>
<P>
It is to be noted that unless the outer margin be at least double the inner, 
the two inner margins, seen together when the book is opened, will appear to be 
pushing the text outwards off the page. 
</P>
<P>
With a normal octavo page of 5 inches wide and 7 1/2 inches high, and supposing 
that we allow margins as follows: inner, 1/2 inch; top, 3/4 inch; outer, 1 
inch, and bottom, 1 1/6 inch; we shall get a type page 3 1/2 inches wide by 5 
2/3 inches high (i. e. 34 lines of pica type, 12 pt., set solid). This allows 
for a line of an average length of 10-12 words in pica, and pica is a good, 
ordinary size for a book held in the hand. Obviously these dimensions may be 
varied slightly without destroying the rationality or normality of the page, 
and type slightly larger or smaller than pica (12 pt.) can be used without 
extravagance or loss of legibility; though it is obvious that, for reasons of 
physical convenience, a variation that entails a lengthening of the line to 
more than 12 or 13 words is a variation in a direction less commendable than 
one that entails a shortening of the line. The dimensions given may therefore 
be taken as a norm. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the book is also a thing to be considered. By increasing the 
margins and leading the type, the number of pages will be increased, and this 
may be desirable on various grounds. For instance, where great legibility is 
required, the leading of the type is helpful; or where the text is short and 
the book consequently a very thin one, the increase of margins and the use of 
leads may give that bulk to the book that habit has made pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
Even the business of bookselling makes its legitimate demands; books commend 
themselves to buyers by their weight, bulk and size as well as by their titles 
or their typography, and this is not entirely foolish. Books have got to be 
handled as well as read, and they have got to stand on shelves. Nevertheless 
there is no occasion to go to extremes in this matter, and it is as foolish to 
make a thick book of a short story as it is, by small type and cramped margins, 
to make one volume of a book that is properly two. 
</P>
<P>
As to binding: The continental practice of issuing books in sheets, or simply 
sewn with a paper wrapper, is much to be praised. The English (Editor's note: 
and the American) book buyer's insistence on a stiff cover, even for the 
cheapest books, has been met by the invention or development of the "case," i. 
e. a stiff cover that may be applied after the sheets are sewn, and is designed 
for making in large quantities. 
</P>
<P>
The only objection to such cases is that they nearly always retain certain 
conventional ornamentations that are derived from the "binding" of former times 
and are not appropriate to machine-made things. For sixpenny novels, the work 
is done from end to end by machine -- including the ornaments on the sides and 
back. For more expensive books, some parts of the work are still done by hand, 
e. g. the pasting of the end-sheets and the insertion of head bands of 
particoloured cloth. But except for individual private customers, "binding," i. 
e. the sewing of the sheets and the lacing of the whole thing to the cover so 
that book and cover are one thing, is not done at all. 
</P>
<P>
Doubtless the ordinary products of commercial printing are not suitable for any 
other treatment, and while the cry is for cheaper and cheaper books, anything 
but what can be done by machine is out of the question. Printing done by 
machinery on machine-made paper may well be cased in machine-made casing, but 
printing done by human beings on paper made by human beings ought to be bound 
by human beings. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Obviously there is only one just cause for the limitation of an edition, and 
that is the size of the market. Provided you are concerned to make books as 
well as they can be made -- and this not so much in a spirit of piety (though 
we do not disdain the virtue of Prudence) as in a spirit of reasonableness, for 
ultimately there is no happiness in a world in which things are not as good as 
they can be -- the size of your edition will depend simply upon your judgement 
and experience as to the number of possible buyers. And if, owing to the time 
factor, you cannot supply in a reasonable time all who would buy, then you can 
produce second and third editions. 
</P>
<P>
We may here go into the question of the artificial limitation of numbers in 
order to capture a "collectors" market. Properly understood, this is a purely 
"business" matter, and the printer whose first concern is quality is not a man 
of business. Let us suppose that both the craftsman and the industrialist have 
produced as many of their respective products as they can sell. What further 
can either of them do? 
</P>
<P>
The craftsman can introduce into his workshop a bit of machinery, and, without 
its being noticeable to his customers, produce the same number of books more 
cheaply and therefore more profitably. He will continue to produce the same 
number, but now, instead of that number being the largest number he can sell, 
it will be the most profitable number. 
</P>
<P>
The industrialist can introduce into his factory a book designer who has 
studied in the museums where they store pre-industrial productions, and, by 
careful watching of the work of "private" presses and of the market supplied by 
them, he may produce, at a considerably higher price than they cost him to 
make, a "limited" edition that will make almost as much appeal to collectors as 
the work of Cobden-Sanderson and his predecessors. This is simply a matter of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
There are, then, two principles, as there are two worlds. There is the 
principle of best possible quality, and the principle of greatest possible 
profit. And there is every sort of compromise between the two. Whether, as 
seems probable, industrialism win a complete victory, or human nature so far 
reassert itself as to overthrow industrialism, is not here our concern. For the 
present we hold simply to the conviction that the two principles and the two 
worlds can exist side by side, industrialism becoming more strictly and nobly 
utilitarian as it recognizes its inherent limitations, and the world of human 
labor, ceasing any longer to compete with it, becoming more strictly and 
soberly humane. 
</P>

 From Eric Gill, "An Essay on Typography" (David R. Godine: $15.95; 133 pp.), 
with a new introduction by Christopher Skelton. This justly celebrated essay, 
long out of print, has been re-issued by a publishing house distinguished for 
the excellence of its typography. The new Godine edition reproduces a 1936 
British edition that enacted a number of Gill's ideas and was, as a result, not 
just interesting on the subject of typography but typographically interesting. 
</P>
<P>
"Born in 1882 in Brighton, England, Eric Gill displayed interest and talent in 
lettering and architecture at an early age. Encouraged by W. R. Lethaby of the 
Central School of the Arts and Crafts, he began carving letters and attending 
the classes of Edward Johnston. In 1903, he struck out on his own, beginning 
his life-long career as a self-employed craftsman. 
</P>
<P>
"By 1925, . . . Gill had started drawing alphabets (one of which was to 
eventually become Perpetua) as well as formulating the principles later 
collected in his celebrated 'Essay.' "

A sequel to the very silly 1988 Paramount hit, "The Naked Gun: From the Files 
of 'Police Squad'!" is in the works, according to co-exec producer David Zucker 
-- with Leslie Nielsen already confirmed to reprise his wacky role as a police 
lieutenant on the trail of a sinister murder conspiracy. The working title is 
"The Smell Of Fear: From the Files of 'The Naked Gun.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I would love to have it ready for release in the summer of 1990, but . . . the 
scripts always take longer than we think they will," said Zucker. 
</P>
<P>
Zucker said there's no real plot yet, but he's currently "assembling jokes" for 
the picture with writer Pat Proft. "We've been watching a lot of old movies. 
That's how we do it," Zucker explained. 
</P>
<P>
Zucker's assessment so far: "The Dirty Harry movies have tons of jokes. 
'Brubaker' (Robert Redford as a reform prison warden) was funny too. 'I Am a 
Fugitive From a Chain Gang' had a lot of jokes. And all the prison movies like 
'White Heat' -- those are hysterical." Stacy Jenel Smith

"Bride of the Re-Animator" -- the sequel to the cult pic, "Re-Animator," about 
the bizarre experiments of med student Herbert West -- begins shooting in and 
around L.A. in June. Producer/director Brian Yuzna is casting, but Jeffrey 
Combs (who played West in the original) is as yet unsigned. 
</P>
<P>
The sequel finds West attempting to "revive" his late girlfriend. Like "I," 
said Yuzna, "it will have a satirical bent." 
</P>
<P>
A casting notice sure does. Consider: "(The bride is) a patchwork quilt of old 
body parts . . . (but) she goes to pieces when he rejects her." And for West: 
"Totally and irrevocably bonkers." 
</P>
<P>
The casting call for performers to portray the re-animated corpses requires one 
to have . . . dance experience. Pat H. Broeske

OUTTAKES: EXPLOITING JESSICA

Jessica Rabbit, the Toon temptress from Disney's "Who Framed Roger Rabbit," is 
about to re-emerge in a big way. Complete with Kathleen Turner's voice, she'll 
make a cameo appearance as a comforting nurse in hubby Roger Rabbit's June 
23-debuting, big-screen cartoon short, "Tummy Trouble" (look for trailers for 
the seven-minute cartoon this weekend). Soon after, Jessica -- in nurse's garb 
-- will appear on store shelves as a figurine and a key chain, with more 
merchandising deals in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Coulter, Disney director of film licensing, admitted that the company was 
"cautious" in its initial exploitations of the voluptuous Jessica ("she is a 
little racy"), but added, "We're doing more with her now." 
</P>
<P>
Jessica has been especially sought after by manufacturers who aim products at 
men, but Disney has turned some down -- including Budweiser. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this line is going to create a whole little sensation in the 
marketplace," Coulter said. "It's going to be an ongoing program, with products 
being created in support of each of the character's new roles as they come out 
(in future films)." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Roger Rabbit is widely considered the surprise toy flop of last 
year. Disney marketing veep Paul Pressler admits that the hapless bunny "did 
not perform as well as we had hoped" in the toy field but said R.R. fared 
better as a gift item. Stacy Jenel Smith

Arsenio Hall is constantly being told that he is "too black" for mainstream 
America. Does anyone ever consider the vast audience that is going untapped 
because Johnny Carson and Pat Sajak are "too white" (and bland) for the youth 
and minorities of America? I'm sorry that Washington Post TV critic Tom Shales 
feels left out when watching "The Arsenio Hall Show." At least he has the 
option of turning the dial to Carson, Sajak or Letterman. Isn't that why we 
have more than one channel on the tube? Why not give Arsenio Hall a chance to 
be his own man and see what America thinks?

ARSENIO HALL

<TEXT>
<P>
A hearty rooof, rooof, rooof to Arsenio Hall for his efforts to entertain 
audiences while maintaining his own cultural uniqueness and style. I suggest 
that the so-called mainstream WASP America give African-Americans and other 
people of color the dignity of their own cultural expression. It would go a 
long way in relieving you of the burden of your own cultural elitism and at the 
same time expose you to a diversity of ethnic expression that can only be a 
learning experience for the better.

Patti LaBelle gave Arsenio Hall the best advice he'll probably ever hear. By 
Hall's being himself we are rewarded with a host who is sincere, interested in 
his guests, fun and, best of all, funny. Where I live we receive one channel. 
I'm grateful it happens to be the one that carries "The Arsenio Hall Show."

ARSENIO HALL

<TEXT>
<P>
Does Johnny Carson sit and ponder over the fact that he may not be reaching a 
black audience? I don't think so. So why should Arsenio Hall worry about 
mainstream America? There seems to be an unwritten law in Hollywood that if a 
black entertainer wants to be truly successful, he or she must have a 
significant white following. As long as there is a Johnny, a David and a Pat, 
the average white American will be taken care of. We need someone to appeal to 
the few of us who cannot relate to the introduction "Here's Johnny!"

A VOCAL GROUP THAT SPECIALIZES IN JAZZ"NEW YORK VOICES." 3 GRP GRD 9589. **** 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New jazz-oriented vocal groups are so rare that this ensemble, four of whose 
five members studied at Ithaca College, must be welcomed as a step in the right 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
Darmon Meader is the key figure: singer, composer, arranger, tenor saxophonist. 
The others -- Peter Eldridge, Kim Nazarian, Sara Krieger, Caprice Fox -- are 
co-writers, contributing lyrics or music for the originals, which are halfway 
between profound and trivial. 
</P>
<P>
Their five-way blend is splendid; the instrumental backing, sometimes using 
synthesizer and sequencer programming, is too aggressive at times, as if the 
group is a little too anxious for commercial success. "Caravan" has interludes 
of scatting and polysyllabic vocalese. (The inclusion of printed lyrics was 
invaluable.) 
</P>
<P>
Of the originals, "National Amnesia" aims at social significance, "Dare the 
Moon" is one of those cheerful wish-upon-a-star ditties; the wordless "Baroque 
Samba" with its choral introduction is charming; "Street Party" has a melody 
too unpartylike for the words. The program closes with the brief, slow, pensive 
"Come Home." 
</P>
<P>
There are no outstanding solo jazz vocalists in New York Voices, though Fox and 
Krieger come closest. In any event, this is a most promising debut. 
</P>
<P>
"SPHINX." Allegro Jazz Ensemble. Mobile Fidelity MFCO 898. **** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
Jazz critics in the Soviet Union voted this the foremost jazz group in the 
U.S.S.R. Clearly the Soviets take their fusion seriously; within this hour-plus 
of very contemporary music are two suites: "In This World," in four parts, and 
the three-movement "Legend," followed by the hard-boppish title number and the 
extended "Portrait." All were composed by the keyboard soloist, Nikolai 
Levinovsky. Conception, performance and recording are exemplary, with just the 
right balance of fusion and jazz elements, touches of humor and some 
high-octane cooking. Igor Butman, the group's tenor saxophonist, has since 
moved to the United States and recorded with Grover Washington. The use of 
synthesizers is effective; the bassist, Viktor Dvoskin, is outstanding. Allegro 
may well trigger a situation that could find American musicians copying their 
Soviet counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
"ELLINGTON MASTERPIECES." The American Jazz Orchestra, conducted by John Lewis. 
East-West 7 91423-2. ***** 
</P>
<P>
Is it Duke or is it Memorex? The old ethical question resurfaces as this 
repertory ensemble interprets 15 works from Ellington's golden age. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of Duke at the piano you have Dick Katz, copying a solo note for note 
off the original record. On trumpet there is John Eckert, copying a solo from 
Cootie Williams that Williams inherited from Ray Nance. Loren Schoenberg, 
better known as a Lester Young disciple, here suggests Ben Webster. And so 
forth. 
</P>
<P>
A statement in the notes, that Duke's music was "all there in the score," is 
false. Much of this band's music was in the hearts and fingers and creative 
minds of Johnny Hodges and all the other giants who were integral to Duke's 
triumphs. Their solos can never quite be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, whether or not you are familiar with the originals, be advised 
that these are masterful re-creations. "Ko-Ko" and "Main Stem" and "Jack the 
Bear" never sounded better. On "Conga Brava" and "Cotton Tail," Schoenberg does 
indeed seem to be ad-libbing. 
</P>
<P>
Under Lewis' guidance, the charts (copied off old records, because Duke left 
few complete written scores) sound magnificent. Heretical as it may seem, I 
believe this version of "Bojangles" is even greater than the original. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis himself replaces Katz at the piano to play the first three choruses of 
"Rockin' in Rhythm" in his own style, and it just may be his finest hour. 
</P>
<P>
It boils down to this: Which versions do you prefer, the derivative ones in 
digital sound, or the originals in mono? While insisting that the creative 
credit must go to Ellington, it's still possible to take six of one and half a 
dozen of the other. 
</P>
<P>
"THE BENNY GOODMAN YALE ARCHIVES, VOL. 3." Music Masters CIJ 60157 X. *** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
Never before released, these 20 tracks stem from a week Goodman spent in 
Brussels in 1957, with a group that included Zoot Sims (prominent in both big 
band and small group numbers), trumpeter Taft Jordan and vocals by Jimmy 
Rushing and the elegant, sadly neglected Ethel Ennis. 
</P>
<P>
Though hoarse and sometimes goofing around with the lyrics, Rushing is his 
indomitable self; he even does "A Fine Romance" as a duet with Ennis. Goodman's 
clarinet has its moments, but he seems awkward at times and even fluffs. What 
makes this an intriguing set is that along with a few old familiar items there 
are little-known charts by Bobby Gutesha, Sid Feller and even Gil Evans. 
</P>
<P>
"GULA MATARI." Quincy Jones. A &amp; M CD 0820. *** 
</P>
<P>
Only four cuts and 34 minutes here, and they are loaded with special effects: a 
female vocal group here, a quartet of celli there, a bass marimba, a guitarist 
who whistles while he works (Toots Thielemans), a bassist who sings while he 
plays (Major Holley). The title tune is somberly dramatic; "Bridge Over 
Troubled Water" becomes a soul vocal waltz, but the Miles Davis blues "Walkin' 
" and Nat Adderley's "Hummin' " have a touch of that old big-band sound and 
moments by Milt Jackson and Hubert Laws. 
</P>
<P>
"SONNY SIDE." Ken Peplowski Quintet. Concord Jazz CCD 4376. *** 
</P>
<P>
At 31, Peplowski is another of those rare younger men who lean to jazz 
traditions. A highly promising clarinetist and a warm, Websterish tenor soloist 
(he also plays agreeable alto on "Alone at Last"), he is backed by a 
conservative rhythm section that wakes up in "Half Nelson," a Latinized 
treatment with good solo work by pianist Dave Frishberg.

RECORD RACK: BOWIE'S MACHINE: THE RETURN OF THE CHAMELEON;

<P>
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes. This is not the latest David Bowie album, but rather the 
first LP from a new quartet of which rock's eternal chameleon is merely the 
most famous member. Right. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, this is one crushing record, recorded mostly live in the studio 
with a minimum of overdubs and bristling with a cold fury. If it were a movie 
it'd be titled something like "The Attack of the Giant Ice Crusher." 
</P>
<P>
Anchored by Bowie's impassioned singing and minimal rhythm guitar work, lead 
guitarist Reeves Gabriels stomps out a wailing maelstrom of white noise that's 
matched by the hard-charging rhythm section of drummer Hunt Sales and his 
brother bassist Tony. 
</P>
<P>
While all 12 songs are solid (the CD and cassette contain two extra tracks), 
the best moments come on a rolling, bluesy paean to the pleasures of the flesh 
called "Heaven's in Here," the anti-drug "Wild Thing" knock-off "Crack City," 
and the R&amp;B rave-up "Pretty Thing," which is ostensibly about a girl but 
winds up sounding like a tribute to the legendary '60s punk-blues group of that 
name. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the anti-fascist riffslinging of "Under the God," the brutal 
rearrangement of John Lennon's "Working Class Hero," the biting, "chop-it-up" 
chorus of "Video Crime," and the unnerving tale-told-by-an-idiot titled "I 
Can't Read." Think Kinks, think Who, Yardbirds 'n' Hendrix too. Think great 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
A little shy on melody to go POP! perhaps, but a couple of these tunes are 
destined to be classic additions to Bowie's already formidable catalogue. DON 
WALLER

RECORD RACK: STEVIE NICKS "THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR." MODERN/ATLANTIC **

Maybe Stevie Nicks has stopped twirling long enough to shake her long-standing 
dizziness: "Ghosts," the best song on her fourth solo album, is not about 
otherworldly specters, but rather haunting mistakes from one's own "past that 
you live in" and "the future you are frightened of." And though that song (and 
others) refer to the likes of guardian angels, this is the most grounded Nicks 
has been since she first sang about her Welsh witch pal so many years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than rock's Shirley MacLaine, this time she's more its Sylvia Plath -- 
though Nicks has apparently crawled out from under her unspecified bell jar. 
Images of brooding solitude and hard lessons learned abound: Besides the angels 
there's lotsa falling rain and disillusioned fairy-tale princesses, all sung 
about in an appropriately weary but wizened voice (as opposed to Fleetwood 
Mac's 1986 LP "Tango in the Night," where her voice sounded shot). 
</P>
<P>
She hedges her bet a bit, writing too often in third person, and Rupert Hine's 
glossy production and the all-star cast (including a duet with Bruce Hornsby) 
also tend to mask the fragility and vulnerability of the lyrics. Still, these 
reflections reveal a woman making positive artistic steps in keeping with her 
apparent personal growth. STEVE HOCHMAN

This group of old school rock 'n' rollers kicks back on its latest LP and tries 
for more of a pop angle. It keeps a few of the metal trappings -- a guitar 
crunch here, some bump-and-grind drums there -- so it won't lose its hard rock 
audience, but songs like "Move It" and "House of Broken Love" seem obviously 
slated for the Top 40 crowd. When tattooed party dude Jack Russell attempts to 
pass himself off as a sensitive guy by warbling "The Angel Song," it just plain 
doesn't work. Great White needs to get real and get down.JANISS GARZA

ART NEWS: NEW TRADITIONS FROM LATINO PHOTOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert J. Phelan balked when he was asked to curate a Latino photography show. 
</P>
<P>
Ethnic art exhibits tend to perpetuate ethnic stereotypes, he told the 
officials at the New York State Museum in Albany who had offered him the job. 
</P>
<P>
"But needing to make a living, I said, 'Lemme think about it,' " said Phelan, 
an independent curator who finally took on the exhibit as an "experiment." The 
result: "New Traditions: Thirteen Hispanic Photographers," an eclectic show 
with works that range from experimental to documentary at the Southwest Museum 
through July 2. 
</P>
<P>
Phelan found plenty of material. One-hundred-and-ten images, most by emerging 
artists, are on view. But finding a common theme or sensibility connecting the 
artworks proved nearly impossible, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deep into the process of gathering photographs, "I started to get more and more 
agitated because the images I found didn't have a unifying factor or connecting 
thread that I sort of expected them to have. You know you have to have that to 
give coherence to an exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
"But this actually turned out to be the best thing about the show -- that it 
doesn't necessarily support or deny any sort of ethnic stereotype." 
</P>
<P>
Some similarities did crop up as he looked at the works over and over, Phelan 
said. Among them were "an inclination to examine things in terms of religious 
context and the reference to history or the idea of fable or myth or 
tradition." Magic realism emerged as a commonality too. 
</P>
<P>
"But the Hispanic heritage of these artists is an element of greater or lesser 
importance," he said. "It's not necessarily the controlling factor and in some 
cases it's not there at all. Of the work I saw, I ultimately found 13 different 
approaches." 
</P>
<P>
ROAD SIGNS: Proposals for ArtBulletin, the program that reproduces original 
artworks for display on billboards, are being sought. A panel of Los Angeles 
art professionals will choose three artists whose work will be displayed 
throughout the Los Angeles area for at least four months starting in December. 
During that time, each artist's billboard will be moved to several sites. Each 
artist will also receive a $750 honorarium. All professional artists who are 
residents of Los Angeles County are eligible for the program, co-sponsored by 
Patrick Media Group, Inc. and Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions. Deadline 
for ArtBulletin proposals is June 30. For an entry form and information, call 
the ArtBulletin Program at (213) 731-5111. 
</P>
<P>
DON'T BE FOOLED: Leading some listeners to expect an advertisement about the 
L.A. County Museum of Art, a spot that's been airing on radio station KNX-AM 
starts off like this: "Welcome to the county art museum." But the ad was 
written to sell cars, not pitch art. The blurb for Chevrolet's new Lumina car 
goes on to liken the automobile to a great painting. A brochure for the car, 
describing it as "a work of art," sparked the idea, said Alan Woods, president 
of Ad Works, who wrote the ad. A LACMA spokeswoman said she had not heard the 
cultural car commercial. 
</P>
<P>
AND TOKYO TOO: Japanese and American officials are planning to stage the first 
Tokyo International Exposition in March, 1990, an event likely to improve 
worldwide visibility of the emerging Japanese contemporary art scene. The expo 
(similar to Los Angeles' International Contemporary Art fair), is being 
co-produced by the Japan Art Publishing Group, which publishes Japanese art 
magazines, and the Lakeside Group, producers of Chicago's venerable art fair. 
One hundred dealers are expected at the Japanese fair, said Mary Michalik, 
Chicago Expo director. The Japanese publisher approached Lakeside "then we went 
to see them last April and a letter of intent (to co-produce the event) was 
signed," Michalik said. 
</P>
<P>
HARD TIMES AHEAD: Arts giving is down nationally and will stay that way, 
according to "The Cost of Culture," recently published by ACA Books. Edited by 
Margaret Jane Wyszomirski and Pat Clubb, the new book is composed of four 
essays on nonprofit arts philanthropy that present such declarations as: 
Government matching grants do not generate new money for the arts, baby boomers 
don't give or go to the arts as much as their parents, and corporations prefer 
to support arts institutions rather than individual artists or arts projects. 
The book is available for $9.95 plus $3 shipping and handling from ACA Books, a 
division of the American Council for the Arts, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, New 
York, N.Y. 10019. 
</P>
<P>
GRANTS: Four Southern California art museums have been awarded National 
Endowment for the Arts grants to improve the conditions in which works of art 
are exhibited or stored. The museums and their grant amounts are: L.A. County 
Museum of Art, $50,000; Museum of Photographic Arts, San Diego, $10,000; 
Newport Harbor Art Museum, Newport Beach, $4,900; Museum of Contemporary Art, 
$4,700.

YOU CAN TAKE IT WITH YOU;

<P>
PICNICS YOU DON'T HAVE TO PACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH REICHL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once upon a time picnics were fun. You simply stuck a slew of sandwiches into a 
bag, threw in a couple of carrot sticks, a handful of hard-boiled eggs and a 
bunch of brownies and went off to find some ants. 
</P>
<P>
Then gourmania struck. Suddenly picnics became as competitive as dinner 
parties; nobody wanted to be caught in the wilderness without the appropriate 
grub. Urban picnics were even more ridiculous; people could be seen trudging up 
to the Hollywood Bowl with enough for an army of foodies. There they were, 
under the stars, discussing the fine points of foie gras. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurants contributed to this madness. Suddenly they were all packing up 
their food to go, providing major meals in plastic cartons. These days it's a 
rare restaurant that isn't itching to offer moveable food, and now that summer 
is approaching my desk will become buried beneath a blizzard of press releases 
promising the perfect picnic basket. 
</P>
<P>
But do you really want to head outdoors clutching containers full of duck a 
l'orange? I don't. I'm tired of soggy salads, I don't want anymore portable 
pates, and if I am offered one more cold chicken leg I think I'll scream. 
</P>
<P>
It's time to rethink the picnic. This does not necessarily mean going back to 
basics. All sorts of restaurants offer all sorts of dishes that are perfect 
picnic fare -- and many of them do not even know it. Not one of the following 
restaurants thinks of what it cooks as alfresco food, but each provided what I 
consider a perfect picnic. 
</P>
<P>
ANTIPASTO ALFRESCO: I looked out the window and shivered; it was one of those 
cold gray Sundays that seem more appropriate to San Francisco than to Los 
Angeles. The picnic, I knew, would be off. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the end of $45 worth of food," I said morosely, looking at the platter 
of food I had picked up at Angeli the day before. "It will never last another 
day." 
</P>
<P>
Five days later I was eating my words -- and still eating the antipasto I had 
picked up for the picnic. It got better as time passed -- even the pansies that 
decorated the dish survived for days. 
</P>
<P>
Antipasto really is the perfect picnic food. And Angeli's party platter, 
intended as hors d'oeuvres for 15, makes an abundant picnic for six. 
</P>
<P>
Packed into a portable plastic tray, the platter was enormous. Mounded in the 
middle was a rice salad surrounded by a pinwheel of colorful marinated 
vegetables. Bright garlicky carrots glistened next to slick roasted peppers and 
shiny green beens. Pungent mushrooms nestled against thickly sliced salami; 
cauliflower was set off by big black olives. Large slices of creamy baked 
ricotta provided a cool contrast to the spicy vegetables. Throw in a few loaves 
of Angeli's chewy bread, add a few of the restaurant's delicious biscotti and a 
little fruit, and you end up with a pretty perfect picnic. 
</P>
<P>
 Angeli, 7274 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles, (213) 936-9086. Antipasto platter, 
$45. Biscotti, $5 per order of 4. 
</P>
<P>
SUSHI SAFARI: It was noon in a small sushi bar in Little Tokyo. The man 
standing at the door wanted sushi to go. "When are you going to eat it?" asked 
the sushi chef. "Four o'clock," replied the man at the door. The chef shook his 
head decisively. "It won't be any good by then," he said. The man pleaded, but 
the chef would not be moved. "Go someplace else," he said. "I won't sell you my 
sushi." The man walked out empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
And yet all over Japan sushi is considered the perfect portable food. 
Supermarkets and sushi shops routinely sell sushi to go, and every Japanese 
station boasts a stand selling sushi to take on the train. The Japanese know 
that the sushi must be eaten quickly, but no sushi shop is without pretty boxes 
to pack up its wares. 
</P>
<P>
On this side of the Pacific, nobody packages more seductive sushi than Katsu. 
The boxes are not as beautiful as the restaurant's handmade plates, but they 
are so attractively packed that just opening them up is a treat. The restaurant 
also makes ordering easy: the person who answered the phone when I called asked 
me to name the fish in English. "I don't speak Japanese," he said when I asked 
for uni. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant sends along good-quality soy sauce and attractive chopsticks, so 
that all you need to pack are some small cups in which to mix the soy sauce and 
</P>
<P>
wasabi, and something simple for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
You'll discover the advantages of this particular picnic both coming and going: 
It is the least bulky food you can possibly pack, so you won't have to carry 
more than a few flat boxes. And when the picnic's over, there is nothing to 
bring home. 
</P>
<P>
 Katsu, 1972 Hillhurst Ave., Los Angeles, (213) 665-1891. Sushi will cost at 
least $20 per person. 
</P>
<P>
PEKING PICNIC: I'm the sort of person who often finds herself standing at the 
refrigerator at 2 in the morning eating leftover Chinese food. And I have been 
known to take cold moo shu pork on a picnic. Still, I realize that many people 
are more sensible than this, and I'm not going to suggest that you create a 
picnic out of day-old Chinese food. 
</P>
<P>
I am, however, about to suggest a picnic of carefully chosen items from a 
Chinese menu. Most Chinese restaurants offer a number of dishes that are 
intended to be eaten at room temperature; anybody who likes Chinese food (and 
who doesn't?) would be thrilled to find himself sitting outdoors munching on a 
bowl of cold spicy noodles. 
</P>
<P>
The last Chinese picnic I partook of came from Mandarette. I am addicted to the 
curried chicken turnovers, and I find that they are perfectly delicious at room 
temperature. The menu has a number of salads that don't get soggy: I especially 
like the gingered poached green beans and the garlicked cucumbers. The pungent 
cold noodles are perfect picnic fare (if you aren't planning on eating early, 
you might ask them to pack the sauce separately). Roast duck travels well, and 
I've discovered that fried rice tastes as good cold as it does hot. 
</P>
<P>
You can find good picnic dishes at almost any Chinese restaurant, but 
Mandarette has one advantage: If you want more than fortune cookies for 
dessert, the restaurant can provide it. 
</P>
<P>
Mandarette, 8386 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles. (213) 655-6115. Expect to spend a 
minimum of $15 a person. CAKE WALK: Speaking of dessert. . . . Some people 
can't wait until it's time to eat it. If you are one of them, you'll be glad to 
know about a new bakery in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not suggesting that you take nothing but sweets to your outdoor feast. The 
Old Town Bakery does make a few things that you can eat without feeling guilty. 
Their savory rolls -- brioche filled with ham and cheese -- seem designed for 
picnics. They also bake an olive-swirl bread that is abundantly sprinkled with 
whole kalamata olives; a loaf of this bread and a hunk of cheese would make any 
olive addict swoon. 
</P>
<P>
But dessert is the main thing here. Proprietor Amy Pressman supplies many 
restaurants, hotels and caterers, and you may have run into her incredibly 
decadent almond rocca cake or her three-layer chocolate raspberry mousse cake 
somewhere before. (You aren't likely to forget them.) Her pies are wonderful, 
but they don't travel well. Still, you could easily take the zippy gingerbread, 
the rich sour cream coffee cake, the brownies, the date bars or the cookies off 
to your picnic. Then again, you may just take one look at the cases filled with 
cakes and decide to have your picnic right there in the shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Old Town Bakery, 166 W. Colorado Blvd., Pasadena, (818) 792-7943. Brioche 
filled with ham and cheese, $1.75 each; olive bread, $4.50; cakes and pies 
about $3 a slice.

NOTEBOOK: INFORMAL, INEXPENSIVE AND IN FASHION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
While sophisticated upscale restaurants (you know: the kind with $28 entrees 
and $50 Chardonnays) are languishing all over town, more and more informal, 
inexpensive restaurants are opening -- and, for now at least, doing very well. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of the 8-month-old Daily Grill in Brentwood, for instance, report that 
they've been serving between 600 and 800 meals a day -- in a 90-seat restaurant 
-- and expect to take in roughly $3 million in receipts this year! They're so 
pleased with business, in fact, that they are now working on a second Daily 
Grill -- in the new Beverly Connection complex. The new place, scheduled to 
open before Christmas, will be larger than the Brentwood original, with 120 
seats and a 30-seat private dining room -- but will otherwise remain true to 
the formula (good, honest grill Americana at reasonable prices; no 
reservations; coffee-shop decor) that seems to be working so well. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Silvio DeMori, proprietor of Tuttobene in Hollywood and Tuttopasta 
downtown, is plotting a second version of the latter -- which frequently has 
people lined up outside waiting for a table, despite what he considers a 
terrible location in the Subway Terminal Building on Hill Street. The new 
Tuttopasta, which will open in about two months, is located across the street 
from the aforementioned Daily Grill in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
"It will definitely be another Tuttopasta," says DeMori, "but it will be more 
of a trattoria, and it will be more comfortable than the downtown one." 
</P>
<P>
The new Tuttopasta will be open only for dinner -- though, says DeMori, he does 
a good lunchtime delivery business from the downtown location. "We put in a fax 
machine for orders, as a joke," he adds, "and now we have to buy a second one." 
</P>
<P>
WHAT'S NUA?: When I spoke with Kenji Seki (ex-manager of Chinois on Main and 
co-creator of New York's China Grill) last October about the restaurant he was 
planning to open in Beverly Hills, he said that it would be called Noa Noa, and 
that it "must open by March, 1989." March has come and gone with no Noa Noa. 
But, says Seki, construction has finally started on the place, and he does plan 
to be in business by early August. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he has changed the restaurant's name to Nua Nua, in order to avoid a 
possible conflict with the Noa jazz club in Santa Monica, and has announced 
that his chef will be none other than Masayuki Ishikawa -- whose Ishi's Grill 
was one of the first restaurants in the country to successfully blend Japanese 
and contemporary American cooking. 
</P>
<P>
SPAM, SPAM, SUSHI AND SPAM: Bento Xpress in San Jose has added Spam sushi -- 
marinated Spam on rice wrapped in seaweed -- to its otherwise conventional 
Japanese menu. The creation, which has reportedly been a success with local 
diners, is said to be a popular dish in Hawaii -- a place whose most famous 
dish, it might be noted, is a paste made from taro root.

PEAK MOMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What would it take to please Martin Bernheimer? I attended the Metropolitan 
Opera's monumental production of Wagner's "Ring" cycle, and I suspect that few 
in the international, musically sophisticated audience would agree with 
Bernheimer's article in the May 7 Calendar. 
</P>
<P>
Bernheimer nit-picks over details of the scenery and props, while failing to 
give us an overall picture of the power of the performance. 
</P>
<P>
The opera lover goes to the theater in hopes of experiencing those peak moments 
in which he is, to borrow C.S. Lewis' phrase, "surprised by joy." 
</P>
<P>
Alas, there is no joy in a Bernheimer review, and this time I fear that the 
mighty critic has indeed struck out.

REPLYING TO FEIFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cartoonist Jules Feiffer's May 14 degradation of African-Americans was a misuse 
of his access to media, and it emphasized media's power to propagandize. 
</P>
<P>
First, African-Americans have little media ownership. Second, the community 
ills portrayed in the media are created and controlled by people outside the 
community. And, third, the "genocide against African-Americans" that Feiffer 
refers to is real. 
</P>
<P>
The problems described in the cartoon are created by white Americans. For 
example, "children in front of crack houses": Only white Americans at the top 
have the power and money to bring cocaine into this country. And where else are 
the children to play? 
</P>
<P>
Teen-age pregnancy: White girls have more pregnancies than other races. Also, 
more of them are on welfare than all other groups. 
</P>
<P>
The crimes of young white males are not highlighted in the media to the same 
extent as those of others. Surely no one thinks that many members of the 
virtually media-proof and justice-proof white race are not sadistic and 
criminal. Ever hear of Satanism? Manson? Hangings? 
</P>
<P>
The fear in "liberal white friends" (to quote Feiffer) is because they know 
that downtrodden and maligned people will not forever stay underfoot. 
</P>
<P>
The power of media is such that it could stop racism in one week if it wanted 
to, or, as typified by Feiffer, propel it to new heights.

X-RATED PLAY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Movies are rated as "G," "Parental discretion recommended" or "X," but I am 
shocked to find that plays are not rated. 
</P>
<P>
I took my mother out of a nursing home in a wheelchair to see "Minamata" 
because we were told by a very skillful telemarketing person that this was a 
play about Japan. I was further told by the ticket office that most people 
loved it -- that there was lots of singing and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
My mother, who is half-paralyzed from a stroke, almost had another stroke when 
we saw on stage men having sex with women and men having sex with men. Many of 
the scenes had naked performers. 
</P>
<P>
Only with the greatest imagination could you believe this was a story about 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
I was told this was the best play of the season. I have demanded my season 
subscription of $132 be refunded. I was told: no, I might enjoy the rest of the 
season!

AST STRUGGLING BACK FOLLOWING FOUNDERS' RIFT; 
</P>
<P>
PARTNER LEFT AFTER YEARS OF CONSENSUS MANAGEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About a year ago, when AST Research's computer sales were sizzling and its 
stock was soaring, the company's three young founders decided to treat 
themselves. They all went out and bought fancy new cars. 
</P>
<P>
Albert C. Wong and Thomas C. K. Yuen drove up to work in identical black 
Ferrari Testarossas. Safi U. Qureshey, displaying more modest taste, showed up 
in a top-of-the-line BMW. 
</P>
<P>
Whether purchasing cars or plotting corporate strategy, AST's top executives 
followed a "Three Musketeers"-type philosophy after forming their company in 
1980. They named the company by using the initials of their first names and 
chose their original job titles by literally picking them out of a hat. They 
later shared the title of co-chairman, drew the same salaries and decorated 
their offices almost identically. They were not just business partners but also 
close friends. 
</P>
<P>
New employees at the Irvine firm soon learned that important company decisions 
weren't final until Albert, Safi and Tom -- as AST workers call them -- gave 
their collective stamp of approval. 
</P>
<P>
But somewhere along the line, something went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The first sign of trouble came in November when Wong, the company's technology 
chief, abruptly resigned. "The reason I left was the partners," Wong said in a 
recent interview. "We just didn't get along." 
</P>
<P>
In eight years, AST's founders had gone from being three enthusiastic 
entrepreneurs working 16-hour days in an 800-square-foot office in Irvine to 
millionaire executives trying to run the daily operations of a big, 
fast-growing enterprise. AST is now one of the nation's leading manufacturers 
of IBM-compatible personal computers and it is expected to surpass $500 million 
in sales in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But the AST story is also a case study of the strains that young entrepreneurs 
endure when a company grows, prospers and then stumbles along the way to 
becoming a major corporation. It also shows how idealistic visions, such as the 
AST founders' egalitarian approach to management, sometimes don't work in the 
business world. 
</P>
<P>
"When you start a company, you are really doing it for yourselves," AST's 
Qureshey said. "We have learned that we have to take a much more objective, 
businesslike approach. It doesn't mean that our values are less important. But 
we know we cannot treat the company as our personal property." 
</P>
<P>
AST's founders say one thing that bound them together was their similar 
backgrounds. All came to the United States to study engineering. Yuen and Wong 
came from Hong Kong to Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, where they were 
roommates. Qureshey, a Pakistani, studied engineering in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refinanced Homes 
</P>
<P>
Qureshey and Yuen met at Computer Automation, an Irvine computer maker. In 
1980, the three decided to strike out on their own, using $50,000 they raised 
by refinancing their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"We all wanted to move up faster and sooner," said Yuen, AST's chief operating 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
After selecting the company's name over a meal at a Carl's Jr. restaurant, the 
founders started a computer consulting firm specializing in the mid-range 
computer business. 
</P>
<P>
But in August, 1981, International Business Machines introduced its first 
personal computer, prompting AST to enter a new field. By December, AST was out 
with its first product, a printed circuit board that made it easier and cheaper 
to boost the memory of IBM's PC. 
</P>
<P>
"We sold our first board to a customer in Orange County," Qureshey recalled. 
"They sent us a check for $82, and the check bounced. It was not a good 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revenue Soared 
</P>
<P>
By 1986, AST had become the leading producer of add-on products designed to 
increase the memory and capabilities of PCs. The add-on business began to slow 
about that time, though, because newer PCs didn't require as much extra 
equipment. So AST decided to build its own personal computers. Its first model, 
the Premium/286, was a big success. Revenue soared to $412 million for the year 
ended June 30, 1988, doubling the year-earlier revenue of $206 million. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, AST's founders shared in managing the company and divided up 
their responsibilities according to respective skills and interests. Yuen 
focused on marketing and sales. Wong oversaw engineering and manufacturing. And 
Qureshey divided his time among several areas. 
</P>
<P>
The founders referred to each other as "partner" and never by their titles. 
They made decisions as a group, discussing issues until they reached a 
consensus. They took no votes on issues to avoid having any one of them come 
out on the short end of a 2-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
But as AST continued to grow, the unusual power-sharing arrangement began to 
show signs of strain. Those differences became more critical when AST's 
earnings slipped in mid-1988, despite soaring sales. 
</P>
<P>
Wong eventually departed, and two months later, AST had a stunning financial 
setback. The company in late January reported its largest quarterly loss ever, 
a whopping $8.9-million deficit. The second-quarter loss resulted in AST 
cutting 6% of its worldwide work force, or 120 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Falling Out Denied 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Wong's departure appeared to be just another story of a 
computer-whiz-turned-millionaire quitting to enjoy the good life. At the time 
of his departure, the founders, including Wong himself, denied that there had 
been a falling out. But Wong, who remains an AST director and major 
shareholder, recently has been more forthcoming about why he left. 
</P>
<P>
According to Wong's account, the tensions that led to his eventual departure 
had been building for about two years. Increasingly, Wong was finding himself 
in disagreement with Qureshey and Yuen on key decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"When a company is doing fantastic, then a lot of problems can be shoved under 
the table," said Wong, who after leaving AST formed a small real estate 
company, DMK Development Corp., in Laguna Hills. But when AST began to stumble, 
tensions arose. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute that led to Wong's departure centered on a new PC the company 
planned to introduce. According to Wong, Yuen wanted to ship the new machine to 
customers before Wong, who headed up engineering, felt that the product was 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
Several AST vice presidents tried unsuccessfully to mediate the dispute between 
Yuen and Wong. But, Wong said, "I didn't want to compromise." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Longer Working 
</P>
<P>
The underlying problem, the founders agree, was that their unusual arrangement 
of sharing the decision-making authority as co-chairmen was no longer working. 
</P>
<P>
"It got all of us frustrated," said Wong, who still owns a 16% stake in AST 
worth about $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
Qureshey and Yuen also acknowledge the problems with the founders' 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
The founders "had a lot of respect for each other's opinions," Yuen said. "But 
when the opinions diverged, the easiest way was to not argue and just back 
away. We didn't want to create a personal confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Yuen added, decisions were sometimes delayed or not made at all 
and "the company became lethargic." 
</P>
<P>
The two remaining founders are careful to avoid direct criticism of Wong, but 
they say the company has run more smoothly since his departure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More Common Values' 
</P>
<P>
"Safi and I have more common values and vision," Yuen said. "And that has made 
it much easier for us to work together." 
</P>
<P>
Since Wong's departure, Qureshey and Yuen say they have also attempted to 
delegate more decision-making authority to an eight-member executive committee 
made up of themselves and other top managers. 
</P>
<P>
"We know where we're going now and it's very different now from six months 
ago," Qureshey said. 
</P>
<P>
In public comments after his departure that particularly irked Qureshey and 
Yuen, Wong has suggested that the day-to-day operations might be better handled 
by a professional manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel Safi and Tom can bring the company around" from its recent financial 
troubles, Wong said. "But I hope eventually they will bring on board some 
capable people to run the business. The founder can't be worrying about whether 
this screw is the right one to put in the computer, and we were doing that."

<P>
Idea Scoffed At 
</P>
<P>
But Yuen and Qureshey scoff at that idea. They say they have no plans to bring 
in a new chief executive or chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
"It is sometimes a disturbing feeling to have your partner feel you don't have 
management experience," Yuen said. "Does it make any difference that we don't 
have Harvard MBAs? I don't think so. We have a lot of hard-earned experience." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some Wall Street analysts say they are encouraged by the direction 
AST has taken during the past six months. Although the company posted a net 
loss of $1.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, it had a small operating 
profit of $423,000, on sales of $113.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts reacted positively to that news because the loss was smaller than 
anticipated and a substantial improvement over the previous quarter's loss of 
$8.9 million. Several have predicted that the company should make a net profit 
in the fourth quarter ending June 30. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more encouraged than I was six months ago," said Jay Vleeschouwer, an 
analyst at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in New York. "They have done a number of 
things to improve their balance sheet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Tragedy 
</P>
<P>
In the past two months, Yuen has been called on more than ever to lead the 
company. Qureshey has spent a lot of time away from his office because of a 
family tragedy involving his young daughter, who was critically injured in a 
swimming pool accident. The daughter is recovering at an Orange County medical 
clinic. 
</P>
<P>
The three founders and longtime friends say the parting was difficult. But they 
add that they have managed to keep their friendship, despite their differences. 
</P>
<P>
Wong says he wishes AST well and believes the company will "prove itself" in 
the long run. But he says he avoids driving his Ferrari past AST's current 
offices or its new headquarters under construction in Irvine. He says the idea 
that he is no longer part of the company is still too painful.

TRADE FRICTION WITH JAPAN GETS DOWN TO BASICS: IS ITS ENTIRE ECONOMY STACKED 
AGAINST FREE TRADE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration cited Japan for unfair trade practices on 
supercomputers, satellites and lumber Thursday. But the real focus was not on 
particular products -- it was on a whole economic system. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the U.S. action stemmed from the growing belief that Japan's 
economy is geared to what is called adversarial trade -- importing reluctantly 
but exporting aggressively. That's a way of benefiting from the other fellow's 
market but denying him the benefit of your own -- a particularly galling fault 
when the offender is a big economic power like Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, which is proposing talks with Japan on impediments to 
trade, is asking its Asian ally to shoulder the responsibilities that go with 
being a major nation, to grow up and no longer try to live at the expense of 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's trade surpluses are unique. It sells more than it buys just about 
everywhere. To West Germany -- one of the world's great exporters -- Japan 
sells $14 billion worth of goods but buys only $6 billion worth. To the 
European Community, Japan sells roughly $20 billion more than it buys; it sells 
more to Asia than it buys, and more to Latin America, and much more to the 
United States -- which accounts for 37% of Japan's exports. 
</P>
<P>
Both friends and critics of Japan have acknowledged that it practices 
adversarial trade -- a term coined three years ago by Peter F. Drucker, a 
longtime friend and adviser to Japanese industry. Drucker warned Japan at the 
time that keeping its markets closed while taking advantage of others would 
bring a reaction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reaction Growing 
</P>
<P>
Now to some extent it has, although on Thursday Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D.-Tex.) 
criticized the Administration's action as "only a first step" that Japan 
already had been "able to water down." 
</P>
<P>
But reaction has been growing. Where for years Japan was admired for its hard 
work and industry, today its very system is being seen as a problem. In 
"Politics and Productivity," a new book edited by University of California 
scholars Chalmers Johnson, Laura D'Andrea Tyson and John Zysman, the industrial 
policy that raised a defeated and hungry Japan to the heights of prosperity in 
a few decades is seen as a disturbing model for developing nations and a 
problem for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Other recent commentators have less kind things to say. One new book, "The 
Enigma of Japanese Power" by Karel van Wolferen, a Dutch journalist who has 
lived for 25 years in Japan, sees its industrial complex as a danger to itself 
and to the rest of the world. And the same thought is taken up by American 
journalist James Fallows in an Atlantic magazine article titled "Containing 
Japan," using a term for America's chief Asian ally that formerly was reserved 
for its principal ideological and military adversary, the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The focus of all that criticism is much more than traditional trade matters -- 
tariffs and other barriers. The charge is that Japan's true trade barriers lie 
in its closed system of corporations, particularly the way its big companies 
organize in groups, hold each other's stock and coordinate business activities. 
Here, that would be against U.S. antitrust laws; there, it's standard business 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
Groups are no secret. About 100 of Japan's largest and best-known corporations 
belong to six groups of companies connected to banks or finance houses. The 
Mitsui group, for example, consists of 24 companies, including such familiar 
names as Toshiba and Toyota. The 21-company Sumitomo group includes NEC, the 
world's largest semiconductor maker. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exchange Information 
</P>
<P>
The Dai-Ichi Kangyo Group includes Hitachi, a giant electrical and computer 
company, as well as Fujitsu, Japan's leading computer maker, and 45 other big 
companies that in total employ 500,000 people and have total sales of 44 
trillion yen -- or $338 billion, slightly more than the combined revenues of 
General Motors, IBM and Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
What do groups do? "Representatives of the group meet every three months to 
exchange information on business opportunities and, where applicable, to 
coordinate their companies' activities," says Dai-Ichi Kangyo in its annual 
report. They give preference to other group members in purchasing and trade 
business information. 
</P>
<P>
To a Japanese observer such interconnections are no big deal. The six big 
groups, with 182 companies, are only the top level of a structure of business 
among Japan's estimated 1.7 million companies, in which small firms serve big 
ones, and big companies have a responsibility for the well-being of the small 
-- "as feudal lords and vassals had mutual obligations," explains Bob Ching, 
the Shanghai-born head of Asian operations for Boston Consulting, who served 11 
years in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The groups are "the tip of the iceberg of the shared purpose and vision that 
one feels in Japanese industry," says William Ouchi, professor of management at 
the UCLA graduate business school. "What lies under the surface is a series of 
networks -- financial networks and government-business networks, scientific 
networks and political and educational networks that jointly provide the 
interstitial tissue that knits it all together." 
</P>
<P>
Companies within the groups hold stock in each other -- between 15% and 30% on 
average of a group member's shares are held by other members, providing a 
stable source of ownership for group companies. 
</P>
<P>
Cross-share holding, familiar from an earlier era in American business -- when 
for example Du Pont held General Motors shares for decades -- is common in 
Japan and thought to be a good idea by many U.S. business people. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota owns more than 20% of the stock of Nippondenso and Aisin Seiko, its 
major parts suppliers, as a form of pledge or bond. The investment assures the 
supplier that if he makes capital investments -- which ultimately benefit 
Toyota cars -- he won't be left in the lurch by the big company. U.S. car 
companies now are offering suppliers similar pledges by means of long-term 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese have a good understanding of supplier relationships," says James 
Morgan, founder and president of Applied Materials, a Santa Clara, Calif., 
company that makes semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Fujitsu, for example, 
owns 21% of Advantest, a principal semiconductor equipment supplier. But 
Advantest supplies Fujitsu's competitors, too. Why does Fujitsu permit that? 
"So they remain strong," explains a Fujitsu executive. "If they are weak, they 
are no good to us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Members Come First 
</P>
<P>
That's nice, say trade experts, but a country that seeks to benefit from free 
markets internationally can't fall back on group behavior at home. Both the 
U.S. and Japanese economies are theoretically open, says UC Berkeley business 
professor Michael Gerlach, but the word means different things when firms of 
one country habitually buy from one another and ignore bids from foreign 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Bluntly put, U.S. companies or trade officials may press all they want for 
sales in Japan, but a group member's supercomputer or semiconductor comes 
first. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. semiconductors, for example, go in the motors of all the world's cars -- 
except Japanese cars. "Where we take 70% U.S. semiconductors," says the head of 
one U.S. car company, "the Japanese maker will take less than 1%." Why take 
any? Because the U.S. industry is technologically ahead in many semiconductor 
products. "The Japanese will only buy what they absolutely cannot make 
themselves," says Robert Noyce, a U.S. semiconductor industry pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes discrimination against the U.S. supplier seems comic, as in the 
episode of Motorola's cellular phones. The Japanese government, in an 
ostensible example of encouraging free trade and competition, gave out cellular 
telephone specifications for a partnership including Motorola, and one 
including Toyota. Toyota got the Tokyo-Osaka corridor through the populous 
heart of Japan; Motorola got the hinterland. 
</P>
<P>
So the question on trade has become not whether Japan imports another 
supercomputer, but whether it changes its closed system. And to penetrate the 
system, trade advisers who have gained influence recently, such as former 
Commerce Department official Clyde Prestowitz, counsel the broad approach. 
Clearly, say these analysts, U.S. officials will never understand the true 
inner workings of Japan's group culture, so they shouldn't negotiate on 
details. Instead, they advise, require Japan to give U.S. products the same 
market share Japan's products enjoy here. And let Japan work out ways to meet 
broad targets, they argue; it is the trading partner that must change. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Domestic Prices High 
</P>
<P>
Which raises the question, Why should Japan change when its system has brought 
it success? The answer, say many experts, including Japanese officials, is that 
the price of Japan's success is coming out of the hides of its own people. 
</P>
<P>
Prices in Japan are high in order to provide a home market cushion of profit 
for Japanese companies competing in international trade. Buyers in Tokyo pay 
more so foreign customers in New York can pay less for Canon cameras, or 
Hitachi (Sears, RCA) TV sets and VCRs. Japanese telephone users pay more for 
phone calls than do Americans, so that suppliers to Nippon Telegraph &amp; 
Telephone can support overseas business with home market profits. In the 
modernization of the phone system, prices being paid for fiber-optic cable are 
three times the world price -- because Japanese cable suppliers are 
uncompetitive except in their home market. 
</P>
<P>
That's why economists figure the Japanese people, despite the strong yen and 
the fact that they have the world's highest gross national product per person 
at $17,244, have 30% less purchasing power than the currency's strength should 
warrant. That is, the Japanese people have lower purchasing power than they 
should because the goods are not available or they are unaffordable -- as 
housing is in big cities. 
</P>
<P>
The blame for that situation lies more in politics than economics, says Naohiro 
Amaya, a former vice minister of Japan's renowned Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry (MITI) and one of the chief planners of his country's 
postwar development. "After the war we put more emphasis on economic values 
than political values of freedom and democracy -- but modern economies need 
democratic society," says Amaya. "Of course we pay respect to the ideals of 
freedom and democracy, but in everyday life they are not implemented. If 
freedom prevailed, prices would go down." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It's Up to the People 
</P>
<P>
Amaya equates political freedom with economic freedom -- the principle that 
allowing products to compete freely and consumers to choose is the most just 
and democratic way to allocate resources in society. 
</P>
<P>
Amaya is also saying Japan has unfinished business. "We are facing the question 
of what sort of relations we are going to have with the outside world and, 
domestically, what sort of political ideals we are going to pursue." Now 
retired from government and serving as executive director of the Dentsu 
Institute for Human Studies, Amaya argues that if Japan is to change, its 
people will have to demand it. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the country's whole image and demeanor seem to refute him. In a time of 
restructuring in the West and perestroika in the East, Japan seems like a song 
from the 1950s. Big companies rule its business undisturbed, as elderly 
politicians survive the Recruit scandal and carry on quietly arranging things 
behind the scenes. Protest is scarcely seen or heard, even though millions of 
middle-class salary earners now reckon they will never be able to afford to buy 
a home. 
</P>
<P>
Why are the Japanese people so apparently uncomplaining? Because rising 
standards of living since the war are better than anything that went before; 
Japan has always been a tough place to live. "One of the most difficult things 
for Americans to understand is the Japanese lack of opportunity," says Jiro 
Tokuyama, senior adviser to the Mitsui Foundation and a Tokyo- and 
Harvard-educated, longtime student of the two societies. Japan is not only 
crowded, it is competitive; it has 120 million people living in a country the 
size of California (28 million population), and in the postwar years, 40 out of 
every 100 of them graduate from college and want good jobs. Before the war and 
throughout Japanese history, most of the people lived in villages, yet in the 
cities before the war, labor relations were violent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
There Is Change 
</P>
<P>
Japan's postwar solution was the corporate system, with a hierarchy of 
organizations and assured employment. It was stable, but also static. A man 
didn't move from company to company, and companies didn't hire talent away from 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
But closed systems are challenged when conditions change. And change is 
occurring today as foreign firms demand a place in the Japanese market and 
Japanese companies move to foreign markets. Employees in new fields such as 
financial services are changing employers these days as premiums are paid to 
attract specialists and experts. "The group system is changing," says Minoru 
Makihara, president of New York-based Mitsubishi International Corp., the U.S. 
arm of the 42-company Mitsubishi Group. 
</P>
<P>
Companies are trimming staff, setting up dozens, even hundreds, of 
subsidiaries, often solely for the purpose of getting surplus employees off the 
payroll. Japan is seeing an entrepreneurial wave as members of the Japanese 
baby boom -- those born during a population surge in the 1950s -- are reaching 
35 to 39 years old and hearing "up or out" at their companies. 
</P>
<P>
And companies are changing to get more efficient and competitive for world 
markets -- a surprise perhaps to many Americans who tend to overestimate 
Japan's industry. The fact is, for all the sheltering and group cooperation, 
results overseas for Japanese companies have been mixed. Automobiles have been 
a big success, but telecommunications has not. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, despite advance publicity about their great size, Japanese financial 
companies have made negligible strides in financial services worldwide. The 
size of Japan's brokerage houses, in any case, results from the fact that fixed 
commissions -- and the profits they bring through restricted competition -- are 
still in force in Japan as they have not been since 1975 in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Overseas Production 
</P>
<P>
The comforts of the home market have made Japanese industry reluctant to go 
abroad before now. Although Japan accounts for almost 20% of the world's 
industrial output, and its exports account for 10% of world trade, its 
companies on average have less than 5% of their production outside of Japan. 
This compares to 15% to 20% for West Germany, Britain and other major nations, 
and 17% for U.S. business. "It's still a developing economy," says Drucker of 
Japan today. 
</P>
<P>
So it may be, because last week the Bush Administration gave Japan notice that 
it's time to move on, as one would to an aging adolescent. For four decades 
now, Japan has been able to make its economic strides and practice adversarial 
trade without world retaliation, because it had both a big protector and a big 
customer in the United States. Now that protector and customer is demanding a 
change, asking Japan to look beyond its own needs and face new responsibility. 
That's what the whole trade thing is about, not trade war but trade maturity.

WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: A RETURN TO EARLY '88 RATE LEVELS IS UNLIKELY SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRUDELE, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for the New York Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Interest rates have come down during the past few weeks but are still nowhere 
near as low as they were just a year ago. And here are half a dozen reasons 
rates won't go back to early 1988 levels very soon: 
</P>
<P>
1. Even if inflation is under control, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan 
Greenspan is not the type to dramatically reverse direction on monetary policy. 
"By his very nature, Greenspan is not inclined to lurching," says Peter Rona, 
head of IBJ Schroder Bank &amp; Trust, a unit of Industrial Bank of Japan. Rona 
believes that if Greenspan decides to ease up on his yearlong tight-money 
policy, he'll do it "in small doses." It was the Fed's tight monetary policy, 
of course, that drove interest rates higher in the first place and is keeping 
them there. 
</P>
<P>
2. Interest rates won't come down sharply because inflation isn't under 
control, especially not worldwide. Prices are rising at levels that are 
unacceptable to the West Germans, Japanese, British and other important trading 
partners, so there is intense pressure from abroad to keep interest rates high. 
During the past few weeks, experts here have been arguing that the United 
States' inflation scare is over. But not everyone -- especially not the Federal 
Reserve -- seems convinced of that. 
</P>
<P>
"Inflation will remain high in the months ahead," says William Sullivan, 
director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds, who estimates that 
consumer prices will be up at an annual rate of 5% to 6% during the next three 
months. "There is some evidence that the core inflation rate may be picking 
up," Sullivan adds. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation at the producer level in this country has been running at an 8.4% 
rate during the past few months, while prices on the consumer level are moving 
up at a 6.6% yearly rate. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, the government reported that orders for durable goods, or big 
ticket items, rose a larger-than-expected 2.9% in April. If durable goods 
growth of that magnitude continues, or if other financial data confirms that 
the economy is still very strong, fears of inflation will return before long. 
</P>
<P>
3. Interest rates won't come down quickly or sharply because the Fed is saying 
things, and more important doing things, that indicate it is not ready to ease 
monetary policy. On the same day last week that the Wall Street Journal was 
quoting government sources as saying "some Fed officials have begun to consider 
easing credit to stem the dollar's surge," the central bank was draining 
reserves from the monetary system. That move, which keeps pressure on interest 
rates, anchored the federal funds rate at a lofty 9.75%. The recent peak for 
that rate was a tad higher at 9.875% a little more than a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fed is standing still right now," says Francis Schott, chief economist at 
Equitable Life. "The Fed's aim is not to ease prematurely. Its action this week 
reflects a policy stance that in all likelihood was defined at the Open Market 
Committee meeting earlier this month." 
</P>
<P>
Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson also said last week that the central bank's 
main concern is domestic inflation, although he also commented that recent 
inflation data "looks encouraging." Johnson added that when the Fed sees the 
inflation situation getting better, it might ease up. 
</P>
<P>
That's true. But are "encouraging" hints on inflation enough to prompt lower 
interest rates? The experts don't think the Fed is going to risk going back to 
square one on inflation just because of a few "encouraging" economic figures. 
</P>
<P>
4. Interest rates won't come down sharply until there are sure signs that the 
U.S. economy is slipping into a recession. Only under a recession threat will 
the Fed risk pulling rates down quickly. "The economy doesn't appear to be in 
any danger of falling into a recession," says David Resler, chief economist at 
Nomura Securities. 
</P>
<P>
5. And the Fed will not drag interest rates down simply to get the dollar under 
control, as much as some White House officials may want it to. "The dollar 
ranks fourth, maybe third, in the Fed's policy parameters," says Kim Ruppert, a 
Fed watcher for MMS International, a consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the dollar on the Fed's list of worries, Ruppert says, are inflation, 
the strength of the economy and money supply growth. "I don't look for a major 
change in interest rates," she says. 
</P>
<P>
6. Even if the Fed does loosen, it will be awhile before banks pass their 
savings on to borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
Financial markets, of course, take heart whenever there is even the slightest 
sign that interest rates are declining. But if you are someone who doesn't care 
about the financial markets and just wants to borrow some money at a better 
rate, you might have a long wait. 
</P>
<P>
Even if underlying interest rates come down, banks will be slow passing on the 
lower rate to borrowers. Allen Sinai, chief economist at Boston Co., says that 
even though banks would be justified in lowering their prime lending rate, it 
won't happen soon. "Banks have been under pressure and they will try to keep 
their profit margins up for as long as possible," says Sinai, who adds that 
sizable drops in rates won't be seen until much later this year. 
</P>
<P>
There may be one temporary exception. Robert Heady of Bank Rate Monitor says 10 
of the nation's top 100 banks reduced the rate on their 30-year fixed-rate 
mortgages below 10% last week. 
</P>
<P>
Heady says this was partly in response to the banks' lower borrowing cost, but 
mostly because demand is very slow for mortgage loans. Heady thinks that this 
trend will be reversed just as soon as demand picks up. 
</P>
<P>
"There's blood in the street. It's a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
No, this guy isn't talking about the post-election situation in Panama or even 
describing a typical day in Central Park. He's a stock trader who dabbles in 
speculative takeover issues, and he's talking about the state of his business 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a gut-wrenching game. You'd better be prepared to lose 25%," he warned 
small investors who might want to play what on Wall Street is sometimes known 
as rumortrage. (Translated, rumortrage is betting on rumored deals that haven't 
been announced and may never be.) 
</P>
<P>
As predicted, there haven't been many takeovers announced lately. Investment 
banking sources have been saying high stock prices and hefty interest rates 
have kept American companies from making acquisitions, with foreign companies' 
chances of making a good buy hurt by the soaring dollar. To make matters worse 
for speculators, some of the takeover situations they thought were the most 
promising have disappointed them tremendously of late. McGraw-Hill, for 
instance, destroyed one of the longest-lasting rumors when it got British 
investor Robert Maxwell to sign a standstill agreement. That means Maxwell, who 
probably wasn't going to bother the publishing company anyway, really won't be 
bothering it now. 
</P>
<P>
And Amway didn't follow through with its takeover bid for Avon Products. 
Nothing further has developed at Honeywell, which lost a proxy battle earlier 
this month. Cray Research opted for a restructuring that hurt its stock price. 
And Sea Containers, another durable takeover rumor, hasn't panned out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the day of reckoning for speculators," says my friend the trader, who 
sees some irony in the fact that investors in the bluest blue chip stocks, such 
as General Electric, have been doing just fine while he has been playing 
rumortrage roulette. 
</P>
<P>
Outplacement specialist Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas says 20% of all 
upper-level executives are performing 1 1/2 to two jobs. That may be why the 
median job tenure for those executives who quit in the first quarter was 8.75 
years, the lowest figure in seven consecutive quarters.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON: ON PARTICIPATION AND 
PRODUCTIVITY

Berkeley and research director of the Berkeley Roundtable on the International 
Economy.

<P>
America needs a quick, inexpensive way to increase productivity growth. 
Sluggish productivity growth is a cause of some of the nation's most pressing 
economic problems, including stagnation in real family incomes and the erosion 
of our competitive lead in world markets. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1973, output per hour of labor has increased an average of just 1% a 
year. This compares poorly to the 2.7% annual productivity increase we realized 
during the previous 15 years and to the 2% growth rate we enjoyed during the 
preceding century. It also compares poorly to the performance of many of our 
trading partners, especially Japan and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In the competitive world economy, what we can afford to pay ourselves depends 
on our productivity. If we want to make our labor more valuable, we must make 
ourselves more productive. The question is how. 
</P>
<P>
One obvious way is to increase investment in education and in the creation of 
new capital. If we invest to address the shocking weaknesses of our educational 
system, we will produce better trained, more productive workers. And if we 
invest to give these workers more and better equipment to work with, they will 
certainly perform better. 
</P>
<P>
But more investment, though necessary, is expensive, and its effects take time. 
We need to increase worker productivity quickly and cheaply, but can it be 
done? 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, yes. There is growing evidence that meaningful employee 
participation in decision making, accompanied by new forms of employee 
compensation such as profit sharing, can foster productivity. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, David Levine, an assistant professor in the Business School at UC 
Berkeley, and I analyzed this evidence in a paper for the Brookings 
Institution. We drew on the experiences of both American and foreign companies, 
and we surveyed the findings of a large number of researchers from diverse 
disciplines. We concluded that employee participation, if done right, can and 
does increase productivity -- but to be successful in raising productivity, 
employee participation must be substantive. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, many U.S. companies have introduced quality control circles -- QCs -- 
to encourage employee suggestions on how to improve performance. Usually, the 
effects on productivity have been minimal and short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief honeymoon period, workers have lost interest in participating in 
QCs. Often their suggestions have gone unheeded. Sometimes they have resulted 
in job loss. And employees have rarely shared in any increased profit from 
their suggestions. When employees have pushed for more meaningful participation 
and a share in the resulting profit, even successful QCs have sometimes been 
terminated by management. 
</P>
<P>
Employee stock ownership plans -- ESOPs -- have also proved disappointing 
unless they are accompanied by substantive participatory arrangements. The 
evidence suggests that ESOP firms with opportunities for employee participation 
outperform conventionally owned firms, but ESOP firms without participation do 
not. And the kind of participation that seems to affect ESOP productivity is 
not participation by stock voting rights or employee representation on company 
boards, but participatory arrangements that extend to the shop floor and 
involve real influence over how work is organized. 
</P>
<P>
One such participatory arrangement is the work team. In contrast with QCs, work 
teams allow employees both to generate ideas and to act on them. Typically, 
work teams make their own work assignments and determine their own work 
routines, subject to overall work-flow requirements. The organization of 
production into work teams can have substantial, long-term effects on 
productivity. The most successful team production techniques, however, require 
other changes, including the development of additional channels for employee 
participation, such as joint labor-management consultation committees or 
employee representation on company boards. Institutionalized participation 
across a broad range of issues leads to higher productivity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dramatic Effects 
</P>
<P>
In addition, successful work teams are usually accompanied by alternative pay 
systems, such as gain sharing or profit sharing, that motivate employees to 
cooperate as a team and reward them for their enhanced productivity. And work 
teams are more likely to improve performance in companies that are committed to 
job security. Without such a commitment, workers are discouraged from making 
workplace innovations that will improve productivity but threaten their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
With supporting changes in work organization, compensation and employment 
security, the productivity effects of employee participation can be dramatic. 
One need only think of the experience of NUMMI, the joint GM-Toyota venture in 
Fremont, Calif. The old GM plant there was plagued by drug abuse, absenteeism 
and very poor labor relations. Largely using the same technology and the same 
workers as in the old plant, and with the same union in place, NUMMI has 
reduced by 40% the number of labor hours required per car, has zoomed to the 
top of U.S. auto plants in quality and has the lowest absenteeism rate in the 
U.S. auto industry. Work teams are an essential feature of NUMMI, as are 
pay-productivity linkage, a degree of job security unprecedented in the U.S. 
auto industry and union-management consultation committees at every level. 
</P>
<P>
Successful participation, however, does not require Japanese ownership or 
management. Several American-owned companies, including Hewlett-Packard and 
Xerox, have developed channels for employee participation bolstered by 
employment security and innovative pay arrangements. In most cases, 
productivity has increased. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Key Role for Employees 
</P>
<P>
If employee participation improves performance, why don't we see more of it? 
Simple inertia is one explanation. Managerial resistance is another. By 
definition, meaningful participation reduces managerial autonomy. Sometimes, 
certain managerial positions, such as first-line supervisor, are eliminated as 
workers take over day-to-day management of their jobs. Participation also tends 
to reduce differences in status -- and occasionally even pay -- between 
managers and workers. 
</P>
<P>
Unions, too, often oppose employee participation. Sometimes participatory 
arrangements are introduced by management to avoid unionization or to get 
around union contracts. Even when this is not the case, such arrangements 
threaten traditional union authority on a wide range of issues. 
</P>
<P>
One year ago, the report of the Cuomo Commission on Trade and Competitiveness 
recommended employee participation as part of a strategy to restore American 
competitiveness. Mounting evidence demonstrates the wisdom of this 
recommendation. If American companies are to prosper in the long run, American 
labor and American management must work together to develop participatory 
workplaces.

IN WORLD OF CHANGE, BUSH STANDS STILL

<TEXT>
<P>
George Bush is a status-quo politician. That's why he was elected President 
last year. Americans liked the status quo under Ronald Reagan and they voted to 
preserve it. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, however, was not a status-quo politician. His response to Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev was remarkably open -- some would say naive. But the last thing 
anyone would say about Reagan is that he was fearful of change. 
</P>
<P>
That is exactly what people are saying about Bush. "I think perhaps this is a 
time for caution," said Bush in response to the stirring upheaval in China. 
Caution? At a time when 1 million people are putting their lives on the line 
for democracy? That is the sort of thing that could give caution a bad name. 
</P>
<P>
Today Gorbachev has become the symbol of change in the world. Wherever he goes, 
he seems to spread democracy in his wake. "We need someone like Gorbachev, a 
man with vision," said a student protester in Beijing last week. Imagine a 
protester saying that about Bush, who announced that it would be improper for a 
U.S. President to advise the students "what their course of action should be." 
Bush added, "We do not exhort in a way that is going to stir up a military 
confrontation." What does he think he and Reagan have been doing with the 
Contras for eight years? 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev represents previously unthinkable aspirations, namely, reforming 
communism and ending the Cold War. The Bush Administration counters with "the 
status quo plus," a policy the President describes as "a deliberate, 
step-by-step approach to East-West relations." In other words, let's slow 
things down. 
</P>
<P>
When Gorbachev said he would stop sending weapons to Nicaragua, the White House 
responded with annoyance. Press spokesman Marlin Fitzwater dismissed the 
gesture as a "public relations gambit" perpetrated by a "drugstore cowboy." The 
White House just doesn't get it. To say the Soviets are engaging in "public 
relations" implies that they are being superficial while we are being 
substantive. But they are reforming their system and making unilateral arms 
cuts while we are saying, "Let's wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
They act. We complain. They withdraw 500 nuclear missiles from Europe. Defense 
Secretary Richard B. Cheney complains they have "so many rat-holes over there 
in Eastern Europe that 500 is a pittance." This kind of small-minded response 
gives the United States the same image the Soviet Union had when Andrei Y. 
Vishinsky represented them at the United Nations and earned the nickname "Mr. 
Nyet." 
</P>
<P>
There is more than image at stake, however. The United States does not seem 
able to control events -- or even influence them -- in Panama, the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and China. When a 
country loses its ability to influence events, it loses power. The United 
States gained power under Reagan because he succeeded so often in controlling 
events -- although sometimes, as in Lebanon, he failed. Bush seems buffeted by 
events -- more like Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives are becoming critical. They were outraged over an incident that 
happened during Bush's visit to China earlier this year. The Chinese government 
forcibly excluded China's best-known dissident from a banquet Bush had invited 
him to. Bush protested the government's action only after aides pressured him. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, at the urging of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee adopted a resolution supporting the student demonstrators 
in Beijing and warning Chinese leaders that violent suppression of the 
protesters would "seriously damage relations with the United States." At the 
same time, a State Department official said, "The government in trouble in 
China is a friendly government with which we have had good relations. We don't 
wish that government ill." Asked to characterize Bush's response to the 
upheaval in China, one Republican senator said, "He's taken out a patent on 
banality." 
</P>
<P>
Liberals sometimes sound as if they miss Reagan. Rep. Stephen J. Solarz 
(D-N.Y.) urged that Bush "publicly identify himself" with the movement for 
democracy in China by inviting Chinese students to meet with him. "It's time 
for the President of the United States to find words to encourage them in their 
struggle for freedom," Solarz said. "Isn't this what we've been talking about 
for all these years?" 
</P>
<P>
Indeed it is. The fact is, we are winning the Cold War. The Soviets are 
accepting our initiatives. We have been complaining that it makes no sense for 
NATO to negotiate a reduction in short-range nuclear missiles as long as the 
Soviets have a significant edge in conventional forces. So last week, the 
Soviets offered sweeping reductions in their conventional forces. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet offer astonished some U.S. officials. But Bush, who had to scrap his 
prepared remarks at the Coast Guard Academy the next day, responded petulantly. 
The Soviet offers, he said, "confirm what we've said all along -- that Soviet 
military power far exceeds the levels needed to defend the legitimate security 
interests of the U.S.S.R." 
</P>
<P>
Bush hears what the Soviets say, but he says he doesn't see anything warranting 
a substantive U.S. response. "I welcome (Gorbachev) proposals," Bush said last 
Sunday at Boston University, "but I would like to see them implemented." 
</P>
<P>
Others are less suspicious. Right now, only 26% of the U.S. public believes 
that "the military threat from the Soviet Union is constantly growing and 
presents a real, immediate danger to the United States." That figure is down 
from 64% in 1983. The status quo is changing. But no one in the Bush 
Administration has the courage or the imagination to say so. 
</P>
<P>
Remember when Jesse Jackson went to Syria to rescue the captured U.S. pilot? 
Reagan refused to be embarrassed. Instead, he held a ceremony at the White 
House to celebrate the occasion. Bush seems unable to celebrate the 
breakthrough in U.S.-Soviet relations without casting suspicion on Moscow's 
motives. 
</P>
<P>
It takes a secure leader to do something like that. Reagan was secure. Despite 
all the nutty things he said, his sense of personal security was always 
reassuring. Bush usually says sensible things, but he is so easily rattled that 
he makes people nervous. He seems to be paralyzed by two fears -- the fear of 
being called a wimp and the fear of creating a controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Bush refuses to criticize the Beijing government for fear of provoking a 
controversy. "The world has a stake in China's economic progress, national 
security and political vitality," the President said in a statement issued at 
the height of the upheaval last week. "The United States hopes to see the 
continuing implementation of economic and political reforms, which undoubtedly 
will also help advance these goals." Take that, communist oppressors! 
</P>
<P>
Bush takes a tough line with the Soviets to show he's no pushover for this 
glasnost thing. In his May 12 speech, Bush demanded the Soviets pass a series 
of "tests" to show they had changed. If they passed, the United States would be 
willing to go "beyond containment." Last week, the President spelled out the 
reward. If the Soviets are good, he offered to "integrate the Soviet Union into 
the community of nations." In other words, invite them to accept the status 
quo. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's foreign policy is Reaganism without risks. Or as one foreign-policy 
specialist described it, "the Reagan agenda pushed by civil servants." 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, Gorbachev is doing something conservatives have dreamed about for 
40 years. He is rolling back communism. A free election was held in the Soviet 
Union. In China, protesters openly defied the communist government and 
succeeded in challenging its legitimacy. In Poland, a communist government will 
face an organized opposition movement at the polls next month -- and it will 
probably lose. According to the government's poll of Poles, only 12% of the 
voters say they will vote for the communists. 
</P>
<P>
Is communism in its death throes? A lot of communists say yes. In Hungary, a 
radical reform faction seems likely to take over the Communist Party. They are 
calling for a multiparty system, a complete transformation of the economy -- 
and withdrawal of Hungary from the Warsaw Pact, in favor of "neutralism 
guaranteed by the two superpowers." 
</P>
<P>
The totalitarian model is crumbling. That model depends on keeping a close link 
between control of the economy and the monopoly of power. In the Soviet Union, 
Gorbachev loosened up on the monopoly of power and allowed non-communist 
candidates to compete in elections. As a result, the party is under pressure to 
allow a freer economy. In China, Deng Xiaoping loosened up on the party's 
control of the economy. Now its monopoly of power is being challenged. 
</P>
<P>
No communist leader, not even Gorbachev, believes a communist party should have 
to compete for power with an organized opposition. The purpose of glasnost is 
to allow for change and reform within the party. This year's Soviet election 
was a gigantic primary. Independents were allowed to participate, but communist 
rule was never threatened. 
</P>
<P>
The protests in China last week were a kind of impromptu Iowa caucus. 
Participants started out by calling for a "dialogue" with the authorities and 
demanding recognition of their movement as "patriotic" -- that is, as 
legitimate rather than "counterrevolutionary." But as in Iowa, the media 
attention made the participants feel powerful, and they ended up demanding the 
ouster of the prime minister. That's when the authorities decided to crack 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Totalitarianism requires the party be completely identified with the system. 
Opposition to the party becomes "counterrevolutionary" -- i.e., treason. 
Separate the party from the system, however, and you make democracy possible. 
That is what is happening in the Soviet Union, China, Poland and Hungary. 
Movements are emerging that claim to be loyal to the system ("patriotic") but 
critical of the Communist Party. When will we know that communism is doomed? 
When a ruling Communist Party loses power to the opposition. That has never 
happened. But at times it looked possible last week. 
</P>
<P>
And it had the Bush Administration worried. Secretary of State James A. Baker 
III said at a news conference, "I don't think it would be in the best interests 
of the United States for us to see significant instability in the People's 
Republic of China, just like I don't think it's in the best interests of the 
United States for us to see significant instability in the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
The message of the Bush Administration is clear: Democracy is fine, as long as 
it doesn't disturb the status quo.

GREAT CROSSROADS IN THE SQUARE 
</P>

After weeks of political euphoria, of daily demonstrations of the people's 
will, of spoken dreams for a new China, the thousands of students camping on 
Tian An Men Square, the tens of thousands of citizens marching each night, 
waited. They waited because they knew they had done all they could. They waited 
also because it is not they, but a small group of old men who would decide the 
path China will next trod. 
</P>
<P>
Each evening last week, thousands of students and professors and bus drivers, 
doctors and Popsicle vendors, engineers, journalists and factory workers, 
mostly young but some older folks, gathered in front of the ornate gate of 
Zhongnanhai, a former imperial compound and now the working residence of 
China's leaders. Through the open gate, beneath the crimson lacquered upswept 
eaves of this portal to power, the crowd saw, on an inner wall, immense 
characters scrawled in the calligraphy of Mao Tse-tung that read: "Wei renmin 
suwu" -- "Serve the People." 
</P>
<P>
The people stood, they sang, they chanted, they called on the old men behind 
this gate to hear them, to serve them. Cries of "Down with Li Peng," "Long Live 
Freedom," "Long Live Democracy," echoed against the high cement walls, even as 
the somber green-uniformed praetorian guards stood at attention before them. 
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, the prime minister, had forbidden this. He declared martial law, 
banned the encampments on Tian An Men Square, the parades through the heart of 
the capital, the slogan-chanting outside his compound. Yet the people 
persisted. They blocked his soldiers and ignored his commands. They flaunted 
their power and flouted his. But they knew this is China -- and in the end it 
is not they but the men in Zhongnanhai who would decide how this all ends and 
that it could end at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the government will win," said a 23-year-old student of international 
politics at Beijing University. "That is because of military power. They have 
the guns. If the army wants to come, it could come immediately. Like South 
Korea, the people could be defeated." 
</P>
<P>
But before the guns are drawn, it is the party's leaders, Deng Xiaoping, the 
man who set China on a course of economic modernization and reform, Yang 
Shangkun, the elderly military leader who is the country's president, Qiao Shi, 
the Communist Party disciplinarian, Zhao Ziyang, the party's general secretary 
who now has been eclipsed, and Li, who would decide. Everywhere on Beijing's 
streets, there are rumors of the power struggle being waged within this 
coterie, a battle over the soul of the party, over authority, the right to 
rule, indeed the right to call oneself a communist. 
</P>
<P>
It is now assumed that Deng, the man unquestionably behind Li's effort to 
impose martial law, has turned viciously on his chosen head of the Communist 
Party, Zhao Ziyang, labeling him a "counterrevolutionary." Zhao is under house 
arrest, and it is said that his personal secretary Bao Tong has been arrested 
and a purge of Zhao's supporters is under way. Then again there are rumors that 
Li will be dismissed -- because he cannot prevail in one version, because he 
must be sacrificed in another. 
</P>
<P>
This leadership battle, the most brutal since Mao's death in 1976, has 
paralyzed the government and shattered the fragile succession structure 
assembled by Deng in the last two years. Although he has sought to withdraw 
from the quotidian work of government, Deng has remained the guiding influence 
for significant policy decisions and personnel changes. The explosive momentum 
of the student protests -- what are now citizen protests -- has exposed the 
frailty of Deng's efforts, and the brittleness of the party he has tried to 
rebuild in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Deng, who heads the military commissions of both the party and 
government, was forced to tour the country to rally support among China's 
regional military commanders. Yet it required some time to determine what their 
attitudes were. He has apparently attacked Zhao and thrown his weight behind Li 
and the demand for repression -- all in an effort to preserve his vision of a 
China, at once wealthy, powerful and controlled by an unshakable Communist 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
Unacknowledged by Deng, though, his labors are precisely what have borne the 
fruit of protest, a discontent over tyranny and the yearning for some measure 
of individual and collective freedom. Economic liberalization -- encouraging 
free markets and individual initiative to drive the economy -- cannot be 
isolated from other facets of a society's development. This is the lesson of 
the Philippines, South Korea and Taiwan. But more is at work. New ideas and new 
values have flooded into China along with the Sony televisions, National 
refrigerators and Peugeot automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
The young politics student, standing unshaven on Tian An Men Square, smoking 
distractedly under the midday sun, put it bluntly. "We have grown up in the 
last 10 years. The Chinese people have grown up. Everyone is awakened. Everyone 
can see." 
</P>
<P>
And what Chinese in cities from Beijing to Canton, Chengdu to Shanghai see is 
the unwillingness of China's leadership to embrace the norms of modernity 
accepted elsewhere. This is why Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has 
mastered the art of discourse, of persuasion, of the genuine, has become a hero 
for China's students. Gorbachev has failed utterly to bring Soviet citizens the 
material rewards that Deng has, yet he has declared his respect for people's 
minds, for their will. This China's leaders have been unable to do -- unable 
even to understand why they must. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese now take economic achievements for granted. They want more, and on 
the streets of China's cities, they are saying they want it now. Not everyone 
says the same thing, but they all see how their demands are related. This 
coalition of desire has fueled the most powerful challenge to China's communist 
leadership since 1949. Last week a journalist from the Guangming Daily marched 
under his newspaper's banner on Thursday and spoke, not of abstract notions of 
freedom, but of censorship. "We cannot write what is true," he said. "We cannot 
write what we should. We want to tell the Chinese people the truth." A young 
man from Shenyang, a student at the Lu Xun Art Academy, talked earnestly of 
democracy, "We should be able to elect our leaders, like they do in the West." 
Four workers from a railway department carried a placard reading "Li Peng step 
down." 
</P>
<P>
For the Communist Party, and especially for the emerging new hard-line 
leadership, none of these ideas is palatable, none acceptable. Free elections, 
as experience has shown in the Soviet Union and sentiment on the streets here 
has demonstrated, are counterrevolutionary -- at least in that they signal the 
demise of the party's claim to represent the people. The right to protest, a 
free press, guarantees of individual privacy and a government of law, all 
undermine the principles by which the Communist Party continues to exercise its 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
On Tian An Men Square, as night closed in once again, the young students 
huddled under makeshift tents and lean-tos. Bicycle tea wagons labored through 
the maze of passages that separate the encampments, the students of the China 
Opera Institute from the Sichuan Foreign Languages Institute, the Petroleum 
Institute from Beijing University's archeology department. The students were 
weary and admitted being far from their goals. Less than one hour away, in all 
directions, were hundreds of thousands of soldiers, armed with assault rifles 
and tanks. The students and the citizens of Beijing knew they had stopped the 
soldiers before, but they seemed unsure about being able to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps all that prevented Deng -- and his public voice, Li -- from issuing 
those orders is a deep-seated unease over the probable cost. More likely 
though, while the intense struggle was being waged within the leadership, there 
was no one -- not even Deng -- who could issue orders of this magnitude. It 
seems certain now that the party has suffered damage so serious that it will 
never rule with the authority it had before. But nonetheless the new party 
leadership appears intent upon a period of intellectual and political 
repression, a course that has failed in the past but remains the only one they 
know. 
</P>
<P>
"Changes," the student of international politics said, "must come from outside 
the party. Inside the party, they won't listen to the people. The walls around 
them prevent them from touching the people. This is a long course, maybe 20, 
maybe 50 years. But what we are doing is a worldwide trend. If the party does 
not reform itself, it will be overthrown by the people."

THE PALESTINIAN SOLUTION IS INDEPENDENCE -- WITH UNITY

Twenty-two years after the Six-Day War, there is little distinction when 
Israelis, Palestinians and Americans discuss nothing more than a procedural 
device for electing 10 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza to negotiate with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The best moments in Israel's career, from the historic breakthrough in the late 
'40s to the peace treaty with Egypt, were all achieved when Israeli and world 
statesmen were lending their minds to larger visions and more substantive 
issues. Today the fashionable trend is for small steps with a purely procedural 
connotation. We shall probably find that nations, invited to take short steps, 
have an irritating habit of wanting to know the general direction in which the 
steps are to be taken. 
</P>
<P>
I hope the proposal for elections in the West Bank and Gaza can be developed 
into an agreed procedure. This will require American efforts to harmonize Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's important initiative with other views and interests. 
It is naive to expect that there will be an intellectual freeze on all 
exploration of future horizons. 
</P>
<P>
I was the first to expound the "Benelux" idea. The reference is to communities 
that combine national independence with a large measure of integration and 
mutual openness, as Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg did in 1948 when 
they established the Benelux Economic Union. 
</P>
<P>
In European forums in the late '60s and early '70s I discussed the European 
Community experience as a structural model for solving the 
Israeli-Jordanian-Palestinian equation. As long ago as the Geneva Peace 
Conference on the Middle East in 1973, I said: "The ultimate guarantee of peace 
lies in the creation of common regional interests in such degree of intensity, 
such multiplicity of integration, such entanglement of reciprocal advantage as 
to put the possibility of war beyond rational contingency." 
</P>
<P>
I recalled an occasion in the historic partition debate at the U.N. General 
Assembly in 1947 when a delegate from the Netherlands explained why a unitary 
state for the whole area of the former Palestine Mandate would not be just or 
realistic. He said: 
</P>
<P>
"After the Napoleonic Wars, Belgium and the Netherlands formed one unitary 
state. Although our two peoples had very close ties, relations and interests of 
a cultural, historical, ethnological and economic nature, this unitary state 
ended rapidly and unsuccessfully. The differences between Arabs and Jews are 
much greater than those between Belgium and the Netherlands . . . . Now, 
together with Luxembourg, these countries are reunited not politically but 
economically, and what counts now is not our political separation but our union 
for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1947 the European attempt to reconcile individual independence with 
integration in many fields has made impressive headway. This principle now 
joins 12 nations for the only successful attempt in the modern age to moderate 
sovereignty without abolishing it. The trend has been inexorably toward 
widening and deepening the sectors in which community interest prevails against 
national separatism. 
</P>
<P>
From 1967 until the Rabat summit conference of Arab leaders in 1964, it seemed 
possible that Jordan and the West Bank might form a single state along the 
lines of the previous Hashemite Kingdom, which existed between 1950 and 1967. 
But for Jordan's decision to make war against Israel in 1967, this would 
probably have become permanent. Arab tragedies are usually self-inflicted. 
</P>
<P>
The case for open boundaries and for common regional interests arises from the 
special character of the land. It would be incompatible with history, geography 
and human experience for the West Bank and Gaza to be cut off from a political 
relationship with Jordan and an economic and human relationship with Israel. 
These three entities can never be as separate from each other as are the 
traditional hermetic boundaries between sovereign states. Even when war rages 
and revolt flares up, thousands of people move across open bridges and border 
posts between Jordan and the Arab-populated West Bank -- and between the West 
Bank and the sovereign territory of Israel as defined in Israeli legislation. 
How incongruous it would be if this human traffic were to flow in times of war, 
only to be stifled by the establishment of peace. 
</P>
<P>
The peoples of this area need separation for the purpose of defining their 
juridical and cultural identity, but they need mutual accessibility and 
integrative habits for all other constructive ends. 
</P>
<P>
There is good reason for opposing the idea of a Palestine state totally cut off 
from Israel and Jordan, but most objections would be alleviated if there were 
an integrative atmosphere in a peace accord involving Israel, Jordan and some 
densely populated Arab areas of the West Bank and Gaza, supplemented by an 
agreement on the demilitarization of the West Bank and Gaza that could be 
monitored by a vigilant Israel and Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
There is a world of difference between a Palestinian state that would be 
entirely free to do as it likes and a Palestinian nation that would be bound by 
community commitments to harmonize its policies with those of its neighbors. 
The tactical advantage of this option is that it confers on the Palestinians an 
asset in the form of a national identity that they could easily lose by 
irredentism or terrorism. The knowledge that this could be the case would be 
the surest guarantee of responsible conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Palestinians would have a very small territorial area and would not 
be able to compete with Israel in military terms, their compensation would lie 
in a national identity and in the fact that they would be saved from total 
weakness by using their economic and human links with Israel and Jordan. In 
advocating a confederation between Israel, Jordan and a Palestine state, the 
Tel Aviv Center for Strategic Studies, representing mainstream military 
thinking in Israel, wrote: "In this way, even a malevolent Palestine, were it 
to emerge, would be deterred by an alliance of the stronger countries that 
completely surround it: Israel and Jordan and, adjacent to Gaza, Egypt." 
</P>
<P>
Free movement across the western part of the community area would prevent 
Israelis from being cut off from areas revered in the national history. It 
would also diminish the anomaly of lack of contiguity between the West Bank and 
Gaza. The area, though partitioned politically, would be intact as a social and 
human reality. 
</P>
<P>
Is this too utopian or visionary to be considered in an area now plunged in a 
sordid alternation of revolt and repression? The Palestinian leaders will have 
to advance much further on the road toward credibility in Israel before this 
vision comes into sight. There will also have to be a substantial modification 
of Israeli attitudes, although the basic idea of "territory for peace" already 
has massive support. It is precisely because the gaps are so wide and the 
dangers so acute that there is need for new thinking even at the edge of the 
precipice. When Jean Monnet first projected his idea for a European community 
to be formed by nations whose wars had plunged mankind in torrents of blood and 
anguish, there were many who doubted the realism of his idea. 
</P>
<P>
A sense of impending peril often drives human beings and nations toward 
innovation. In the last resort, nations can only find security by doing what 
their mutual interests demand.

PUTTING A DOLLAR COST ON THE HAVOC IN LEBANON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Mail, writes frequently on the Middle East and South Asia.

<TEXT>
<P>
For more than two years, AtifKubursi has been doing for the United Nations the 
reverse of what every journalist is taught to do -- dehumanizing the tragedy in 
Lebanon with cold, hard numbers. Kubursi is a Canadian economist who was asked 
by the United Nations for a study on the never-ending Lebanese civil strife, in 
a form that economists and bankers could understand. 
</P>
<P>
It was to be an economic primer of sorts that would eventually tally the cost 
of rebuilding the one-time Monaco of the Middle East. The idea was to alert 
global monetary institutions such as the World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Last month he handed in his as-yet unpublished study, a mind-numbing fact sheet 
with an equally amazing bottom line: In the unlikely event that civil war in 
Lebanon ended today, it would cost between $25 billion and $30 billion to 
rebuild the country. 
</P>
<P>
The figure comes very close to the $33-billion Japanese estimate for the 
rebuilding of Iran and Iraq after their war. Or, in a North American context, 
close to what it cost Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. to buy tobacco and food 
giant RJR Nabisco. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the hidden cost of the Lebanon war," Kubursi said in an interview. "It 
flattened a country that was a success story in 1974, an economy that was 
poised to take off." His study tallies everything from the gross domestic 
product to the consumer price index and capital investment -- or the lack of it 
-- in plants and factories, comparing the present with the prewar years before 
1975. As sources, he used the Central Bank of Lebanon and the local chamber of 
commerce (yes, both are actually functioning), professors and students at the 
American University in Beirut and the U.N. economic staff. 
</P>
<P>
Kubursi, a professor of economics at McMaster University near Toronto, is a 
Lebanese Christian by birth; he came to Canada some 20 years ago. His parents 
rent a three-bedroom apartment in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1976," he said, "they used to pay a rent of $7,000 a year. Today, they pay 
about $31. But the bizarre thing is that the landlord gets the same amount of 
Lebanese pounds for $31 that he did in 1974 for $7,000." 
</P>
<P>
Currency devaluation was one of the casualties of the 14-year-old strife. 
During the prewar period, the Lebanese pound appreciated steadily against the 
U.S. dollar and other currencies. Since 1975, it has been depreciating by an 
average of 18% a year until 1985 and much faster since then. While 2.3 pounds 
were equal to $1 in 1974, the dollar now fetches more than 550 pounds and a few 
months ago it bought 620. 
</P>
<P>
While bankers and currency-futures players may draw one meaning from this fact, 
it has much wider implications. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, given that Lebanon imports over 75% of its requirements, most of it food, 
the real incomes of families are all that much lower," Kubursi explained. 
</P>
<P>
Put against the backdrop of 1974, the hidden cost of Lebanon's free-for-all 
becomes more striking. Lebanon was the playground of the Near East, drawing 
rich businessmen to rest and to launder their money through the secretive, 
Swiss-style banking system. 
</P>
<P>
"It was called the success story of the Third World," Kubursi said. "Its 
economy was poised to take off and challenge the 'Southeast Asian Tigers' -- 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. Among other things, such exports 
as fresh produce, electrical goods, textiles, cosmetics and even petroleum 
byproducts were increasing at a rate of 33% a year. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the closest model to an Adam Smith economy," he said. "The Lebanese 
government was restricted to minimal activities. Even most education and 
medical services were private . . . the only thing the government looked after 
was telephone, mail, justice, defense, just the very minimal." 
</P>
<P>
The effects of the civil war that began on April 13, 1975, were not felt for a 
few years, for several reasons. The Middle East was enjoying an oil boom. 
Lebanese working in the gulf were remitting about $400 million a month to their 
country. In addition, the Palestine Liberation Organization was based in 
Lebanon, with its own schools, hospitals and other infrastructure, pumping 
about $4 billion a year into the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Adam Smith model has become virtually a state-run enterprise. "In 
1974, the government's expenditure was only 14.9% of the gross domestic product 
(the total goods and services produced by a country)," Kubursi said. "In 1985 
this increased to 45.5%, in 1988 to 60.1% -- Lebanon has become a state-run 
economy, a role it was ill-equipped to play." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the private sector, which adjusted by firing workers, the government had 
to spend more on things such as subsidies for the imported food, defense and so 
on. But somebody had to finance this and it drew on the Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result," Kubursi said, "there was a sharp acceleration of money supply 
growth arising from the Central Bank financing of the government deficit -- a 
euphemism for printing money." By the early '80s, the buffer had also crumbled. 
The oil boom was going bust. The PLO was driven out of Lebanon after the 1982 
Israeli invasion, dropping its spending from $4 billion a year to about $500 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Among the major sources of income left were the ports, which explains the 
incessant fighting for their control between the militias and the government. 
By 1986, the government's port revenue had shrunk to 423 million pounds from 
477 million pounds but at a vastly devalued rate. The militias, meanwhile, 
helped themselves to about 900 million pounds annually from port income to fund 
their activities, including providing jobs to the growing unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost all the fighting now is over revenue," Kubursi said. "The public debt 
exceeds total government revenue of about $5 billion . . . so the public sector 
is effectively in a state of bankruptcy, it can only print money. Ether way 
they have more inflation." 
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index, rising at a rate of 3.6 % in 1974, rose at a rate of 
20% up to to 1985 and then in 1986 and 1987 topped 700%. A basket of essential 
goods that cost 10 pounds in 1974 had risen to about 60 pounds by 1985 and 741 
pounds by 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Against this, the average family income in Lebanon in 1974 was $800 a month. 
Today it is less than $130, Kubursi said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974 Lebanon was in the enviable position of having virtually no deficit. 
Today just the interest it needs to service its debt is greater than its 
income. All of this translates into social costs, Kubursi notes: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The middle class, the only one that could play a cementing role in Lebanese 
society, has been virtually wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An "out-migration of human capital" -- a brain drain -- with the 
entrepreneurs and skilled workes fleeing, has left the semiskilled and 
unskilled to fend for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A "reduction in the quality of human capital" leaves schools closed most of 
the time; professors have "either fled or been kidnaped." 
</P>
<P>
 -- A reduction in the number of males has caused a greater participation of 
unskilled and unprepared females in the labor force. Many households are led by 
women who work long hours without such support services as child care. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The ensuing tension has increased the divorce rate on one hand and 
increased polygamy on the other. Men, not necessarily Muslim, may have two or 
three common-law wives. 
</P>
<P>
Is there anything that is still functioning in Lebanon? 
</P>
<P>
"Banking is still very vibrant," Kubursi said. "Deposits in Lebanese banks are 
about $4 billion, $3 billion of these in U.S. dollars. Lebanon still acts as a 
tax haven, a lot of money is laundered through it because it maintains the 
Swiss-style numbered accounting system." According to Canadian police sources, 
a lot of the laundering is done by drug barons. Kubursi said even on days when 
it is impossible to get through by telephone to people in Lebanon or find out 
the weather in Beirut, bank telexes and fax machines keep whirring. 
</P>
<P>
"And every newspaper religiously reports the Lebanese exchange rate every day," 
he said.

HISTORICAL SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'd like to respond to some statements in the article (Part I, May 12) about 
the meeting of the 70 California Historical Society members, librarians and 
historians called to discuss the closure of the CHS library, among other 
things. A coalition called the Friends of the California Historical Society was 
formed, whose goal is to re-open the library and stop the sale of its Whittier 
Mansion headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
This group of concerned people is not, as Nancy Maushardt (president of the 
board of trustees of CHS) said, mostly "loyalists to former executive director 
(James) Holliday." He did not call the meeting, and most of us never met him 
before. He was just one of many people that night who spoke up and gave an 
opinion. Mrs. Maushardt herself was invited to the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the article she stated " . . . This group has possibly a different 
philosophy on how the society should be run. I'm a fiscal conservative. I don't 
believe in running deficits." Well, neither do we. We, as members, want to 
investigate how the society got into its deficit position. I personally believe 
that it's due to a lack of proper fund-raising and incompetent management of 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
CHS is a membership organization, and the members would like to have input into 
how the society is run. With the current board of trustees, we have been left 
in the dark.

DWORKIN ON JOHN MACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andrea Dworkin in her condemnation of the brutality of John Mack and the 
callousness of his defenders in Congress ("Political Callousness on Violence 
Toward Women," Opinion, May 14) erred only in failing to recognize the full 
reality. Some, not all, men are certainly guilty of vile conduct -- as often as 
not toward other men, as well as women. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, women themselves are hardly exempt from comparable behavior. 
History is replete with examples; the most recent, the doyenne of the Nazi 
concentration camps, Ilse Koch. The lady fashioned lamp shades from human skin. 
</P>
<P>
A convincing intellectual case can also be made against the economic Darwinism 
so fervently embraced by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
There is more than enough shame and guilt to go around. Charles Schulz may have 
expressed it best through Linus in the "Peanuts" comic strip many years ago: 
</P>
<P>
"I love the human race. It's people I can't stand."

WELFARE REFORM PROPOSALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial "For the Common Good" (May 14) makes the Ford Foundation report 
on social welfare reform sound like worthwhile reading. But as necessary as 
increased spending on the social safety net is, I keep wondering when this 
country is going to begin dealing with the causes of poverty? When will the 
commitment manifest that will make solutions inevitable? To most Americans the 
funds spent on poverty, hunger, homelessness, housing, inadequate health care, 
etc., are simply being poured down the proverbial bucket with a hole. 
</P>
<P>
What is needed? Once again, it's the complete commitment on the part of every 
American to demand of their government and each other the empowerment of every 
other American. With the proper support, caring, resources, encouragement, and 
values any person reaching adulthood can have choices and make decisions 
consistent with their own goals and visions for a prosperous life. The first 
step in that process is ensuring that our children, through personal contact, 
the media, our institutions and social infrastructure, have the self-esteem to 
have forged a vision of a satisfying life so that their actions, at all stages 
of life, will be for their own good and the common good as well. 
</P>
<P>
No "welfare" program can do that, although some are and more could form planks 
of the foundation upon which those choices are made. And our commitment to 
those programs must be greater than our commitment to war machines, if they are 
ever to attain the lofty goal of full budgetary consideration. 
</P>
<P>
It is a two-pronged attack; a higher priority for relief initiatives, and a 
more concentrated effort at the root causes. But neither will occur until all 
of us raise it to its appropriate position on our personal and political 
agenda.

DWORKIN ON JOHN MACK

<P>
The John Mack case is a particularly horrific example of a justice system 
lacking any semblance of justice. To have smashed a woman's skull in with a 
hammer, stabbed her in the chest and slit her throat and then serve a little 
more than two years of prison time is morally reprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
Should John Mack have resigned his post as top aide to Speaker of the House Jim 
Wright? One could reasonably argue that he should never have been there in the 
first place! 
</P>
<P>
In fact, one could even more reasonably argue that he should still be behind 
bars for the incredibly evil act he perpetrated.

BAKER'S INAPPROPRIATE ROLE AS AN EVENHANDED BROKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANE KIRKPATRICK, Jeane Kirkpatrick writes a syndicated column in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State Jim Baker's speech to the American Israel Political Action 
Committee last week is being widely interpreted as the first comprehensive, 
authoritative statement of the Bush Administration on the Arab-Israeli 
conflict. It is generally believed that its style and substance reflect the 
thoughts and feelings of the Bush-Baker team about problems of the region. 
</P>
<P>
Examination of the speech establishes that it is less harshly critical of 
Israel than was generally reported, especially on radio and television. 
Nonetheless, the speech was not good news for Israel and its friends, and is 
more likely to heighten tensions than lower them. 
</P>
<P>
The substantive proposals made by Baker were rendered less attractive than they 
might have been by some gratuitously negative language, which gave the speech 
its negative tone. 
</P>
<P>
"Stop the challenges to Israel's standing in international organizations," he 
told the Arabs; "repudiate the odious line that Zionism is racism." 
</P>
<P>
He told the Palestinians to renounce the policy of a phased takeover of Israel 
and to give up the uprising for diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
To Israelis he said, "Forswear annexation. Stop settlement activity. Allow 
schools to reopen. Reach out to the Palestinians as neighbors who deserve 
political rights." 
</P>
<P>
There are important problems with Baker's speech. Most notable, perhaps, is the 
curious tone of evenhandedness in Baker's approach, the kind of assumption that 
fairness lies in a middle ground between Israeli and Palestinian goals, and his 
request that all parties -- Israelis, Palestinians and other Arabs -- make 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
Baker referred in the introductory portions of his speech to the fact that 
Israel is a "vigorous democracy" with which the United States has a "strategic 
partnership." But his discussion of the conflict communicated no sense of 
greater concern for one side than for the other. It communicated no sense that 
Israel is a beleaguered democracy confronting a violent adversary bent on its 
destruction, no sense that Israel has fought three wars for survival. 
</P>
<P>
In a phrase seized on by the media, Baker called on Israel to "lay aside, once 
and for all, the unrealistic vision of a greater Israel." This is very strange 
language; it suggests that the secretary thinks that Israel is driven by an 
expansionist vision. But, of course, it was not expansionism that delivered the 
West Bank and Gaza to Israeli occupation. It was the need to defend against 
repeated attacks by neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's curious language becomes curiouser when it is remembered that in the 
since 1967, no Israeli government has acted to annex the territories, and that, 
to the contrary, in the one available opportunity to negotiate peace with an 
Arab neighbor, Israel returned the Sinai to Egypt in exchange for a very formal 
peace. In fact, no significant political party in Israel is driven by the 
vision of a "greater Israel." And to suggest otherwise is unfair and 
inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is a state in the region driven by dreams of expansion. It is 
Assad's Syria, which occupies more than half of Lebanon. Jim Baker has yet to 
discuss this most-important obstacle to peace in the region. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear why Baker should be more concerned with the peace and rights of 
Palestinians than of Lebanese. It is not clear why a U.S. secretary of state 
has a greater concern with peace on the West Bank than with peace in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's goal for the West Bank and Gaza seems to me reasonable and compatible 
with the security of Israel, Jordan and West Bank Palestinians. His support of 
Israel's proposed plan for elections in the territories is consistent with our 
values and Israel's. His recognition that it will take time and concession by 
all is realistic. But his desire to be (or to seem to be) an evenhanded broker 
in a life-and-death struggle involving a faithful ally seems to me 
inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Responsibility for the Arab-Israeli conflict is not evenly distributed. This 
conflict was born of Arab refusal to accept the existence of a Jewish state, 
born of three Arab wars and of the refusal of Israel's neighbors even to 
discuss peace. It is a conflict that has led to the murder of Jews and 
Palestinians, and also of Anwar Sadat, Bashir Gemayel and other Arabs who have 
dared to advocate peace. It is a conflict that successive Israeli governments 
have sought to end -- even at great cost -- whenever a reasonable opportunity 
appeared. 
</P>
<P>
These are simple facts that need to be faced, even in this age when neutrality 
is often confused with reason and justice.

SUDDENLY, TOM BRADLEY LOOKS MORTAL, AND L.A. BLACKS FEEL ORPHANED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET CLAYTON, Janet Clayton is an assistant editor of this page who 
previously covered local politics for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I've come home . . . I've come home." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Mayor Tom Bradley spoke these words to launch his second 
ill-fated gubernatorial campaign at a rally of hundreds of black supporters who 
had jammed into a poorly ventilated room in South Los Angeles just to see and 
hear him. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Bradley has come home again. With the mayor's blessing, last week a 
gathering of black influentials rose to Bradley's defense as he faces the most 
serious crisis of his political career over questions about his financial 
dealings and allegations of conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
What was behind the stout, if belated, defense of the mayor has as much to do 
with deep concern for the future of all blacks in this city as it does with Tom 
Bradley's political future. The black leaders mounting the mayor's defense are 
afraid that without Bradley, the doors will shut again at a City Hall that was 
all but off-limits before he took office; in a broader sense, they fear that 
his absence will create an overall social and business environment more hostile 
to blacks in a city that already is strongly segregated. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what the disposition of the current investigations, the era of the 
71-year-old Bradley's quiet political dominance is in its twilight. And in 
spite of 16 years as mayor, Bradley, who has surrounded himself at the highest 
levels largely with people who represent his big business/Westside money base, 
has no political protege. 
</P>
<P>
Among the three blacks on the City Council, none appears able to forge the 
multiethnic coalition that Bradley attracted. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Lindsay, 88, represents a district with a boundary change possible in 
the future and a growing Latino population; there is a reasonable chance that 
the next representative will not be black. Robert Farrell, 51, has had to beat 
back two recall attempts. Nate Holden, 60, is a populist scrapper who ran 
against Bradley this spring. Holden proved himself adeptat tapping into 
widespread dissatisfaction about the quality of life in Los Angeles. But he did 
poorly against the mayor in the three predominantly black City Council 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, many black political activists are pinning their highest hopes on a 
lawsuit initiated by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund. 
Either through creation of an expanded Board of Supervisors resulting from the 
lawsuit, or through natural succession to the seat currently held by Supervisor 
Kenneth Hahn, blacks are expecting a place on that powerful body. Rep. Julian 
Dixon, Assemblywoman Maxine Waters and Holden already have indicated interest. 
</P>
<P>
But in spite of its tremendous influence over health care, courts and 
environmental issues, the county board remains a nebulous entity to many 
voters. The mayor and council, like the President and Congress, are easily 
identifiable and thus most often looked to for leadership. And right now, the 
pool of younger blacks in position to ascend politically is limited. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley himself may have unwittingly fostered this dearth of local black 
political up-and-comers. When the mayor in 1987 put the power of his office 
behind the council candidacy of Homer Broome, a sincere but uncharismatic city 
commissioner with no electoral experience, the decision had a domino effect. 
Rita Walters, who wanted to run for the council, decided to stay on the school 
board. That set back Mark Ridley-Thomas, executive director of the local 
Southern Christian Leadership Conference and one of several young black 
professionals hungry for a chance to make a difference in politics. He found 
himself unexpectedly running against the well-supported incumbent Walters. The 
result: He lost, and another chance of political upward mobility for a new 
generation of black leaders was lost, too. And since incumbents rarely leave 
office, the "thirtysomething" hopefuls grow gray waiting for their turn at the 
political helm. 
</P>
<P>
So, many blacks cling to Bradley, with an interest less in protecting him 
personally and more as an act of self-preservation. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if you're not a fan of his," said one prominent black businessman, "if he 
goes out with a cloud over his head, it hurts us all." 
</P>
<P>
Many privately express worry that they will be forgotten in Los Angeles as 
Latino and Asian populations grow. It's an odd worry for a city that has the 
third-largest black population in the nation. But that infrequently quoted fact 
is little comfort to the blacks who have personalized Bradley's woes. 
</P>
<P>
Such a deep fear, which likely seems exaggerated to whites, is credible to many 
blacks. A January Los Angeles Times poll showed why with an ugly reality: 
Blacks are the group most disliked by others in Southern California. Although 
no poll was needed to confirm that to a black person, living daily with that 
knowledge has its deleterious effects -- like seeing racism as the motive when 
the press naturally goes after a big news story about Bradley's finances. 
</P>
<P>
The love-indifference-love relationship between Bradley and black voters was 
best described to me by a longtime resident who has known the mayor for several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
To the black community, this person said, Tom Bradley "is like the cousin in 
your family who was bright and managed against all odds to get to college and 
do better than anyone else in the family, and everyone's so proud. Then the 
cousin moves to the other side of town and visits less often because he's busy 
and successful. You understand. But as time goes on and baby brother needs 
shoes and mom gets sick, you sort of resent him for not doing more (to help). 
But when someone outside of the family attacks him, you end up leaping to his 
defense -- though you may think about it awhile first." 
</P>
<P>
And so to the degree that the black community ties its fate to that of the 
mayor, both face some difficult times and hard questions ahead.

GERMANY NEEDS FORTITUDE TO KEEP HAMADI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTORIA TOENSING, Victoria Toensing, former deputy assistant attorney 
general in the Justice Department from 1984-88, supervised international 
terrorism cases. She currently practices law in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The conviction and life sentence imposed on Mohammed Ali Hamadi by a West 
German court this month was a major, but not a complete, victory in the fight 
against international terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Hamadi was tried in Frankfurt for the June 14, 1985, hijacking of TWA Flight 
847 and the murder of Navy diver Robert Stethem. Our government had strongly 
requested that Hamadi be extradited here to be tried in U.S. courts, but the 
Germans refused. The refusal was based on terrorists' demands not to extradite 
or they would kill two German hostages in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Hamadi's arrest was a fluke. He was questioned at the Frankfurt airport in 
January, 1987, because of suspicious behavior. That "border stop" led the 
authorities to discover explosive material hidden in his possession. Only after 
he was booked and fingerprinted did the Germans realize who they had in 
custody. Immediately, the Kohl government notified the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In response, the State and Justice Departments worked through the night and a 
Washington blizzard preparing the proper extradition papers and translating the 
documents into German. But within 24 hours of the public announcement of 
Hamadi's arrest, a German citizen was kidnapped in Beirut; within a few days 
the terrorists grabbed a second German hostage. 
</P>
<P>
The great urgency suddenly subsided into a six-month lull while the Germans 
delayed and delayed their decision on extradition. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in June, they informed the U.S. government that they would consider 
extradition but wanted to be certain the man in prison was, in fact, Mohammed 
Ali Hamadi. On the two-year anniversary of the hijacking, three victims of the 
crime dropped everything on 24 hours notice and flew from the United States to 
Frankfurt as witnesses to identify Hamadi in a lineup unprecedented in 
extradition procedure. Even though all three identifications were "without 
doubt" according to the German judge presiding, the Germans refused to 
extradite because of the terrorists' demand. Subsequently, both German hostages 
were released. 
</P>
<P>
To its credit, the German state judicial system conscientiously tried Hamadi 
during a 2-month trial that occurred over a 10-month span. On May 17, he was 
sentenced to life, the maximum penalty under German law. For this decision, 
Germany is to be congratulated and praised. 
</P>
<P>
But the story has not ended. The day of the verdict, terrorists kidnapped three 
more (two still remain in their custody) German citizens in Lebanon. Demands to 
lessen his sentence or trade Hamadi cannot be far behind. In all likelihood, 
the political branch of the West German federal government, not the state 
judiciary which tried the case, will once again have to make a judgment about 
terrorists and citizens held hostage. 
</P>
<P>
When I was in Bonn in June, 1987, negotiating Hamadi's extradition, I warned 
the German delegation meeting with us that Hamadi would be a "hot potato." If 
they convicted him, they would always have to deal with threats for his 
release. It would be far better to send him to the United States, I argued, 
where we had the resolve to keep him because he was charged with the murder of 
an American serviceman, the hostage-taking of U.S. citizens and the hijacking 
of a U.S. carrier. West Germany had no victims whatsoever involved in TWA 
Flight 847; the sole jurisdiction for the trial was finding Hamadi on its soil. 
Therefore, the German government might not have the strong support of its 
people to continue to imprison a convicted terrorist when fellow Germans' lives 
are once again being threatened -- as was the situation on the extradition 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
So the case of Hamadi is not over and will not be until he actually serves life 
in prison. Since the terrorists succeeded in making Germany modify its behavior 
on the extradition, they will expect acquiescence again on lessening the life 
sentence. By caving in to the terrorists' demands in 1987, the Germans merely 
delayed making the tough call. We can only wish them well. Now they must 
display a strong national will and refuse to reduce Hamadi's sentence when the 
inevitable new demand from the terrorists arrives.

ZAN THOMPSON: TINY PAWS THAT WILL LEAD AND PROTECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Zan Thompson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first class of puppies to fall around the obstacle course was the babies, 
puppies 4 to 7 months old. They had the invincible innocence of all young 
things, and they lumbered around the course on their big, round feet, soft as 
muffins. 
</P>
<P>
This was last Sunday at the open house of International Guiding Eyes in Sylmar 
in the San Fernando Valley. My friend Mary Ann Thomas is president of the 
California State Board of Guide Dogs for the Blind. Mary Ann knows I will go 
anywhere I can meet a lot of dogs, and there were a lot there, all enchanting. 
</P>
<P>
The obstacle course was laid out on a lawn between a couple of International 
Guiding Eyes' buildings. The first thing the pups had to do was sit; all of 
them managed that. Several gave the tester-trainer warm kisses on his hand. 
</P>
<P>
The first problem the dogs encountered was food, two large, unopened sacks of 
dried food, and balanced on top a plate holding two hamburger patties and two 
grilled frankfurters. The purpose was to test the dogs' distractibility. A dog 
guiding a blind person must ignore temptations, even hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
Another trial was a set of steps built like a stile, three steps up, a small 
platform, then three steps down. There was a handrail on each side for the 
handlers, the people who have taken the pups into their homes to raise until 
they are 1 year old. The steps sound easy -- but almost all of the puppies 
spread their hind legs and braced themselves as if for a tug of war. The dogs 
between 7 and 11 months old did much better, although several of those had to 
be hauled up the stairs by their handlers with the help of the tester-trainer. 
The older dogs walked up the steps, posed and gazed grandly at the crowd from 
the top, and walked with a casual Chesterfieldian air down the other side. 
</P>
<P>
A few feet away was a wire pen holding two Rhode Island red chickens borrowed 
from Knott's Berry Farm for the day, another test of the dogs' ability to keep 
their minds on their work. A few of the dogs walked right by. The tester made 
sure they went back and looked at the chickens. Some of the dogs, very few, 
shrugged. "Big deal. A couple of chickens." 
</P>
<P>
A lot of them jumped back in surprise and then approached the pen and sniffed 
at the chickens. A couple were obviously uneasy about the chickens, even 
afraid, and got away as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The next test was a grill placed flat on the grass, like a grid or a manhole 
cover such as dogs might encounter when they graduated and had their own people 
to guide. Some of the dogs trotted casually across it, some sniffed it and then 
went over it, but several tried to walk on their tiptoes in the front while 
kicking their hind feet up as fast as they could. 
</P>
<P>
The last obstacle was a large floor fan, turned on, with crepe paper streamers 
blowing out from it. Again, some dogs merely looked and walked ahead, some were 
hesitant and one large German shepherd was not going to go by it at all. At 
first he tried to walk on the side away from the infernal thing, but the 
trainer made him come back and walk between his friend and the fan. 
</P>
<P>
Only one dog broke the pattern at the plate of grilled meats. He grabbed a 
frankfurter and happily chomped it. He was so quick, his handler didn't have 
time to pull him back. One snap and he had it. Everyone laughed and I clapped. 
Oh, just a little bit. But I am on the side of the fellow who says, "Oh, come 
on, let's give it a go." 
</P>
<P>
International Guiding Eyes was founded in 1948 through donations of the 
International Assn. of Machinists Union and has been supported by donations 
ever since from the Machinists Union, which is the mainstay, and from 
corporations, clubs, unions and individuals. Last Sunday, the Telephone Company 
Pioneers contributed $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
No money is received at any guide dog center from city, county or state. It is 
just from people who realize what they can do for a blind person -- give him 
independence, self-respect and the outpouring of love from a dog. 
</P>
<P>
The pups are trained first by families who give them house manners and simple 
obedience. Then, at the end of a year, the dogs go back to the Guiding Eye in 
Sylmar. Many people immediately apply for another pup. 
</P>
<P>
The dogs chosen to train are Labrador and golden retrievers, German shepherds, 
boxers, collies and some crossbreeds. Right now, they are trying border 
collies, smaller dogs with minds that could get them into Caltech and the 
hearts of lions. A woman who was taking a border collie home as her fourth 
puppy to train said that the dogs are so intelligent that it will compensate 
for their lack of heft. 
</P>
<P>
The trainers who had brought their dogs to be shown were all ages and both 
sexes. When the dogs come back to Guiding Eye, they are given rigorous teaching 
for four months with a licensed instructor. Then a dog and an applicant for a 
guide dog are carefully matched for disposition and living conditions. Last, 
the dog and the applicant live together in a room at the Guiding Eye and work 
together every day, in traffic, on buses, on airplanes, on trains. 
</P>
<P>
The dogs are so beautiful and the trainers so proud; being with them for an 
afternoon is a high privilege.

ON AGING: SUPPLEMENTING THE BENEFITS OF MEDICARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The UCLA-USC Longterm Care Gerontology Center 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How many private health-insurance policies does it take to supplement Medicare 
benefits? Answer: one. And only one, because by law so-called Medigap policies 
must provide coverage for what Medicare does not: the $564 deductible for 
hospital costs, the $75 deductible for physicians' services and the 20% of 
Medicare-approved doctor charges. A second policy duplicates coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Says Robert Hunt of the National Insurance Consumer Organization: "Anyone who 
tries to sell a person more than one (Medigap policy) is trying to take the 
customer." So far, about 5.6 million older Americans have been taken, according 
to a 1987 study by the Health Insurance Assn. of America. That many people own 
two or more Medigap policies. 
</P>
<P>
Often they've been misled. It's illegal to knowingly sell a supplemental policy 
duplicating the purchaser's existing coverage, so unscrupulous sales persons 
may not ask if you already own a Medigap policy. They'll just try to sell you 
theirs. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some common sales pitches and facts for deciphering them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Social Security or Medicare worker comes calling to sell you a Medigap 
policy. Don't believe it. Representatives of these federal programs don't sell 
or service such insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A salesman explains that Medicare does not cover extended stays in a 
nursing home, then pitches a Medigap policy. His statement is true as far as it 
goes: Medicare helps pay for care in a skilled-nursing facility for only 150 
days and does not cover stays of any length in intermediate- or custodial-care 
nursing homes. But the agent's misled you by implying that Medigap policies 
cover lengthy nursing-home stays. They don't. Consumers can purchase insurance 
policies that cover long-term care, but these are currently distinct from 
Medigap policies and do not supplement Medicare hospital and physician 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Medigap insurance agent asks if you'd be interested in a policy that 
helps prevent you from ever becoming a burden to your spouse or children. With 
your worst fears running rampant, you have difficulty resisting the sales 
pitch. Again, the implication is that Medigap insurance offers coverage for 
long-term care. Once again, it doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
If you're worried about what will happen if you ever need extended care, 
discuss your concerns with family members and explore such options as 
long-term-care insurance or buying into a continuing-care retirement community. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An insurance rep asks if you'd like coverage for prescription drugs. You 
would, because your current Medigap policy doesn't provide this benefit. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to paying for items required by federal and state laws, some 
higher-priced Medigap polices provide extra insurance for prescription drugs, 
physician fees in excess of Medicare-approved charges or other benefits. 
Monthly premiums for these policies pay for the standard Medigap insurance plus 
the additional coverage. 
</P>
<P>
If you want broader coverage than your current Medigap policy provides, 
exchange it for one that meets your needs. Don't buy an extra Medigap policy.

THE COUSTEAU WATCH: OPENING OLD CHAPTER ON WAR AND PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN-MICHEL COUSTEAU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first, I saw only the spear. In Boga Boga, a coastal village in Papua New 
Guinea, the weapon was brandished at me by a tribal elder to symbolize war. But 
there was no danger, for the traditional rite was an essential element of 
welcome and, anyway, I was protected. Two other tribesmen had stepped in front 
of me, crossing two long poles to symbolize peace. War could find no entry. 
</P>
<P>
Our team was not simply being accorded hospitality. We were also being 
scrutinized, for visitors were rare. 
</P>
<P>
We had come to dive on an extraordinary wreck offshore, a fallen World War II 
B-17 bomber known as Black Jack. No one owns Black Jack today, but the people 
of Boga Boga must give permission to dive on it, since it came to rest in front 
of their village. 
</P>
<P>
The villagers could not know of the irony at hand. Calypso, floating pure white 
above the crystal blue sea, was originally a minesweeper. She was built in 
Seattle in 1942, when that city produced many wartime aircraft and ships. 
Before my father acquired her, the vessel was known simply as J-826 and, under 
the lend-lease program, served the British navy in the Mediterranean. Also in 
1942, Seattle turned out a B-17, No. 41-24521 and nicknamed Black Jack for its 
last two digits. Black Jack was commissioned by the United States for action in 
the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Ship and plane left Seattle within days of each other, headed for opposite 
corners of the world. Our visit reunited them. 
</P>
<P>
Black Jack's mission had been clear. By January of 1942, the Japanese, 
intending to invade Australia, established a base at Rabaul on New Britain 
Island off New Guinea. To hold off the Japanese, American and Australian forces 
installed themselves at Port Moresby, New Guinea. 
</P>
<P>
From there, Black Jack took off on July 11, 1943, to attack Rabaul. After 
dropping its bombs, the plane headed back to base. But two of its four engines 
failed. Lost in bad weather and running out of fuel, the pilot ditched in the 
shallows off Boga Boga. 
</P>
<P>
Villagers, who had seen the plane circling weakly above, rowed dugout canoes to 
the plane and rescued the crew. Eventually, all crew members were picked up by 
an Australian float plane and motor launch. Black Jack sunk into the sea, not 
to be seen again until 1986, when it was accidentally discovered by divers. 
</P>
<P>
The plane sits at 50 meters, just about the length of Calypso. At this depth, 
lest we risk problems of decompression, we had no more than 15 minutes per dive 
to retrace four decades of history. 
</P>
<P>
Black Jack lay serenely on the sandy bottom, her wings spreading more than 100 
feet, still not touching the ground -- in one's imagination, an airplane still 
headed home. The fabric fuselage had rotted away, but the skeleton was 
perfectly intact, a shrine to the engineering of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Fascinated by the impeccable condition of the wreck, I explored its nooks and 
crannies, and pictured the craft darting through the sky. I felt the smooth 
round engines, all still in place. I reached into a propeller socket and found 
a rough brown object. It was an odd place for a coconut, but I left it where it 
was, for I didn't want to alter anything in the quiet sanctum. 
</P>
<P>
In the tail of the plane, I came upon something more conventional -- an empty 
box of ammunition. Only when another team member signaled me did I realize that 
I was innocently, and foolishly, standing on ammunition itself. 
</P>
<P>
Coconuts and bullets. In the village, a ritual dance celebrated a newborn baby. 
The contrasts startled me. As Black Jack spoke of the waste of battle, Boga 
Boga spoke of the renewable human spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Little vegetation clung to the wreck, as strong currents passed, and 
consequently few fish fed there. Resting on the ocean floor, Black Jack was 
unutterably alone. 
</P>
<P>
Lying only one ship's length below its sister vessel, Black Jack seemed to 
become a partner of the reborn Calypso, now that both were free of battle. In 
the reunion of ship and plane in the blue New Guinea ocean, the ugliness of war 
had been rendered beautiful by peace.

LIFE IN 'FAST LANE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Fast-Lane Environments" predicting that future commuters will ignore clean air 
plans and spend more time "car-cooning" on the freeways was dismaying at the 
very least. 
</P>
<P>
As a newcomer to Southern California, I've received an overwhelming impression 
of a public longing for a solution to jammed freeways and smog and willing to 
abide by rules and regulations if fairly applied. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, a dearth of leadership means there is no one in government or 
the press with the guts to demand that the people be 
</P>
<P>
served. 
</P>
<P>
We could start by insisting that the automotive designers -- so intent upon 
providing us with car phone, fax &amp; TV -- give us a small one-person 
commuter vehicle that would not only conserve fuel but would save room on the 
highways. And, oh yes -- It could be made comfortable as well.

WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR AND WHAT'S TO BE DONE ABOUT 'KIDS OUT OF CONTROL'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jane Martin, from the Juvenile Hall in Sylmar, is quoted in "Kids Out of 
Control" (by Bob Sipchen, May 18) as asking, "What went wrong that so many of 
the kids society produced now have come back to haunt us? Where along the line 
did we lose control? And how did our priorities change?" 
</P>
<P>
First, let me correct Martin and tell her that society doesn't produce 
children. Parents produce children. Let me also tell Martin what went wrong. 
Parents for one reason or another no longer dedicate themselves and make 
personal sacrifices in order for their children to have the best possible 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
When parents of yesterday and today make their children their number one 
priority, there is no need to think in terms of "controlling" them. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, there has been much written about losing control over our kids. I 
believe that control is not what we want to do to our children. I control my 
dog. I support my children. Parenting should not be thought of in terms of 
controlling kids, but in terms of loving and supporting them. And teaching them 
self-control. 
</P>
<P>
It is precisely because kids feel controlled that they become so rebellious 
during their teen-age years. They want to break the chains. If we think in 
terms of controlling our kids, we are really saying, "I don't trust you." If we 
would only trust our kids right from the beginning, there would be no need to 
feel that we must control them.

Regarding Nikki Finke's article on Willie Bogan, this story casts a refreshing 
glow on the idea of equality by focusing on Bogan's accomplishments and outlook 
rather than his race. Perhaps a few students ditching class during the Los 
Angeles teachers' strike will pick up the View section and learn from Bogan's 
example. He is an inspiration to young people of all ethnic backgrounds. 
Journalism is greatly enhanced by both the content and style of this piece.

POSITIVE ROLE MODEL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nothing could have pleased me more than reading the Willie Bogan story ("Glory 
Redux" by Nikki Finke, May 16). 
</P>
<P>
It was, in fact, a thrilling read, and a reminder of the old, glory days when 
poor but hard-working and ambitious black American parents -- as many still do 
today -- inspired their children to seek higher education "as a way out" and 
when those children, motivated by their parents, became academic All-Americans, 
or students first, athletes second. 
</P>
<P>
I wish there were a Hall of Fame for such unsung parents today because whenever 
and wherever you find a Willie Bogan, invariably you find heroic parents. On 
second thought, however, they probably feel properly honored by the successes 
of their great sons and daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Bogan stands tall as a genuine role model for all young Americans, and 
this is one of the most important stories the Los Angeles Times has published 
in a long, long time.

THE MAJESTY OF THE ROCKIES;

<P>
JASPER NATIONAL PARK CONTAINS SOME OF THE MOST EYE-CATCHING SCENERY IN NORTH 
AMERICA. AN UNSPOILED WILDERNESS OF JAGGED MOUNTAINS, LAKES AND RIVER, 
GLACIERS, WATERFALLS AND HUGE ICE FIELDS GREET THE VISITOR.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those grand old resorts, Banff and Lake Louise, may be the best-known jewels in 
Alberta's Rocky Mountain crown, but the wonders are no less spectacular in 
adjacent Jasper National Park. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving in Edmonton by jet,the province in spring or early summer resembles a 
giant tapestry in various shades of green. From jagged snow-capped peaks to the 
west, icy rivers twist and cascade into mirror lakes. Fertile valleys give way 
to cattle ranches and wheat fields that stretch for miles across the prairie. 
</P>
<P>
Snuggled up against the Continental Divide, Jasper National Park, named after 
oldtime trapper and company clerk Jasper Hawes, was founded in 1907 and covers 
roughly 4,200 square miles of some of North America's most eye-catching 
scenery. 
</P>
<P>
Here, about a four- to five-hour drive west of Edmonton, Canadians and visitors 
alike can -- depending upon the season -- hike, fish, camp, climb, raft, ride, 
ski or simply gaze in awe at the beauty around them. 
</P>
<P>
"The last wild elk, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, grizzly and black bears will 
live in these national parks," naturalist and writer Ben Gould once said. "In 
the near future, the only wilderness left in the world will be protected in 
such parks. 
</P>
<P>
"People will learn to enjoy not having roads up the canyons, not seeing 
buildings of any kind. Visitors who experience the grandeur, the pungent 
aromas, the silence, the refreshment of having a mountain virtually to 
themselves, become wilderness activists." 
</P>
<P>
There is no better introduction to the majesty of the Canadian Rockies than by 
taking the aerial tramway up The Whistlers Mountain. The 20-minute ascent in 
the gondola delivers passengers to a restaurant at the upper terminal, where 
breakfast, lunch and dinner are served on three glass-enclosed terraces. 
</P>
<P>
From there, at 6,700 feet, visitors can climb the alpine hiking trail to the 
summit for an eagle's-eye view of 12,929-foot Mt. Robson, the highest peak in 
the Canadian Rockies, the Athabasca Valley and the Columbia Icefield. Also 
visible from the windswept ridges are spectacular Maligne Canyon and the 
turquoise waters of Maligne Lake, the second-largest glacial lake in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Dropping back down below the timberline, take the Icefield Parkway, which links 
Jasper to Lake Louise, for a close-up view of the glaciers. Sights not to be 
missed include the Athabasca Glacier and the Sunwapta and Athabasca falls. 
</P>
<P>
At the Athabasca Falls, river-rafting guide Mike Szkorupa and his colleagues, 
passionate environmentalists all, take visitors on foaming, roller-coaster 
rides in inflatable boats. 
</P>
<P>
Seven to a boat, participants in rubber suits and life jackets are given a 
brief orientation from their helmsman/guide, then find themselves paddling 
through the rapids or coasting in quiet pools for three hours before pulling up 
on a beach for a lunch break. 
</P>
<P>
For some, the most exhilarating wilderness experience is an afternoon hike up 
to Athabasca Glacier, one of dozens of glaciers making up the Columbia 
Icefield, which, at 150 square miles, represents the largest accumulation of 
ice and snow south of the Arctic Circle. 
</P>
<P>
Although Athabasca Glacier can be viewed from the comfort of a snow coach, on a 
fine day the gradual climb with mountain guide Peter Lemieux is much the best 
way to go. 
</P>
<P>
The Columbia Icefield is a true "continental divide." Its meltwaters feed 
streams and rivers that pour into the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic 
to the east and the Pacific to the southwest. 
</P>
<P>
An information center houses a scale model of the entire ice fields area, and 
the audiovisual display, too, is worth a look-in. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Jasper National Park is crisscrossed with more than 625 miles of 
backcountry trails, each one of them offering something new around the next 
bend. 
</P>
<P>
The town of Jasper itself lies in a broad valley where the Athabasca and Miette 
rivers meet. Less hectic than Banff, even in the high season, it did not really 
begin to develop until the railway reached town in 1911. 
</P>
<P>
Souvenir and crafts shops line the main street but, not surprisingly, it is the 
countryside and not the town that visitors come to Jasper to see. 
</P>
<P>
Those who want to prolong their enjoyment of the Rockies can leave Jasper on 
the 8 p.m. train and enjoy the mountains from their table in the diner. In 
summer, en route to Vancouver, a late-setting sun affords hours of pleasurable 
travel while the scenery rolls by. 
</P>
<P>
Still lakes reflect evergreens and peaks aglow in orange light. The track 
follows the swift Fraser River with its islands of dense fir and spruce, its 
beaver dams, moose drinking at the water's edge, caribou and elk grazing in the 
meadows and solitary Indians spearing salmon, their nets drying on rock 
outcroppings. 
</P>
<P>
At one place, a waterfall is cantilevered across the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Compartment windows are wide and clean, but if you want a bigger picture find a 
seat in the dome car, where the conductor might even have a tale or two to tell 
about the passing country. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian passenger trains can be sidetracked for a freight. Being late is only 
a bonus for true train buffs. Later at night, passengers can watch the 
constellations swing into different positions as the train winds through 
Yellowhead Pass and across scores of high bridges. The 18-hour trip costs $128 
Canadian. 
</P>
<P>
The colorful 190-page "Scenic Rail Guide to Western Canada" by Bill Coo is a 
perfect companion, providing maps, history and local lore. Coo, a lifelong 
railroader, includes locations of the Hudson's Bay Company trading posts, a 
description of the blind mice that live in one five-mile tunnel, stories of the 
monumental struggles to lay these tracks (camels and mules were used to climb 
"the hill of despair," where the last spike was driven), plus facts on 
pioneers, wildlife and side trips with the Canadian National and Canadian 
Pacific system.

NEW YORK CITY IS MOST COSTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With an average daily cost of $308.36 for a hotel room, three meals and a 
rental car, New York City is America's most expensive corporation travel 
destination, according to the "89 Corporate Travel Index," an exclusive study 
on the cost of business travel commissioned by Corporate Travel magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The next six most expensive cities are: Washington ($237.21 a day); Boston 
($236.96); Chicago ($230.93); Newark, N.J. ($217.18); Philadelphia ($213.85), 
and Stamford, Conn. ($209.53). 
</P>
<P>
Sun Belt cities, traditionally known for their lower travel costs, made inroads 
into that exclusive tier -- Dallas ($204.45); Los Angeles ($191.21); New 
Orleans ($190.15); Austin, Tex. ($189.82), and Santa Barbara ($176.47). The 
national average is $163.91. 
</P>
<P>
The least costly cities are: Rochester, Minn. ($120.89); Corpus Christi, Tex. 
($120.67); El Paso $120.48); Greenville, S.C. ($119.72), and Roanoke, Va. 
($104.05). 
</P>
<P>
The "Corporate Travel Index" also showed how per-diem costs break down. Of the 
$163.91 average total, $64.68 went to a downtown hotel room (39.5%), $55.16 
went to three meals (33.6%), including tax and tip, and $44.07 went to one 
day's car rental (26.9%). 
</P>
<P>
A key finding indicated that meals replaced car rental as the second-largest 
cost component of the travel dollar. The average $55.16 tab for three meals was 
up 17.8% from 1987.

A JOURNEY ON FOOT IN THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS 
</P>

BALLACHULISH, Scotland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The way some Britons from the past told it, few people wanted to set foot on 
Glen Coe, one of the most spectacular mountain enclaves in Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
To Dorothy Wordsworth, who journeyed through the great Scottish gorge with her 
brother, William, in the early 19th Century, it seemed a "wild and desolate 
spot." 
</P>
<P>
To Charles Dickens, a few decades later, Glen Coe was "perfectly terrible . . . 
an awful place. If you should happen to have your hat on, take it off that your 
hair may stand on end." 
</P>
<P>
Glen Coe remains wild even today, but "perfectly terrible" it is not. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Wordsworth got it right when, after her maidenly Victorian shuddering, 
she selected another adjective to describe the scene: "sublime." 
</P>
<P>
And though there is a luxury hotel at one end, a tourist information center and 
a paved road through the pass, Glen Coe still rates its share of hyperbole. 
</P>
<P>
With its yawning chasms, its beetling crags towering above and its hawks 
hovering against the skyline, Glen Coe remains the metaphor for 19th-Century 
romanticism. For once the cliches hold true. And as if this weren't enough, 
there is its history containing a bloody, brutal massacre involving the 
Macdonalds and the Campbells of Glenlyon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outdoor Paradise 
</P>
<P>
Today Glen Coe is famous for being an outdoor paradise. The beetling crags are 
used by climbers and the towering peaks by a growing contingent of 
nature-lovers and hikers, a group I joined recently for a week of walking the 
High Tops. 
</P>
<P>
I soon discovered that within 20 miles of Ballachulish, the snug village at 
Glen Coe's foot that we used as a base, there lies some of the most magnificent 
walking country in Europe; and with its road and rail links to the south, some 
of the most accessible in terms of true wilderness. Glen Coe also is close to 
the heart of the splendid Scottish Highlands. 
</P>
<P>
From Bridge of Coe, which marks the beginning of the gorge, to Meeting of Three 
Waters at the head of the pass, Glen Coe is six miles long. Within a short 
distance are many of Scotland's finest peaks, including Ben Nevis, Britain's 
highest, and the lochs and islands that form a picturesque backdrop to the 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Genuine Mountains 
</P>
<P>
The Scottish Highlands, despite their diminutive size (Ben Nevis is only 4,406 
feet high) are real mountains, with knife-edge aretes, cliffs hundreds of feet 
high and weather that notoriously can bring blinding midsummer snowstorms. 
</P>
<P>
Because most of the peaks rise abruptly from sea level, the climbs are equal to 
any in the Eastern United States. 
</P>
<P>
In Glen Coe, 12,000 acres of the finest wilderness are overseen by the Scottish 
National Trust, permanently protected from commercial exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
In the week with the British hikers we scaled six of these mountains, each 
involving more than 3,000 feet of climb and at least a 12-mile hike, with such 
evocative Gaelic names as Buchaille Etive Mor, Sgoor Dhearg, Beninn a' Bheithit 
and, most tongue-twisting of all, Stob Coire na h-Eirghe. 
</P>
<P>
Of these the grandest by far is Buchaille Etive Mor, a majestic, naked pyramid 
that dominates the pass of Glen Coe and Rannoch Moor, a desolate plateau to the 
south. Buchaille Etive Mor means "big herdsman," and its presence is 
appropriately commanding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Winter Ice Climb 
</P>
<P>
The Buchaille is known for its tensile rock -- a rough rhyolite -- and for 
Crowberry Ridge, an ice climb used in winter as a practice run by the original 
conquerors of Mt. Everest. 
</P>
<P>
But the peak also contains more modest ascents. Our group contained three 
leaders and we had three choices: a tricky rock ridge that was a low-grade 
technical climb beyond my capability, a hike of alleged "medium" difficulty 
that joined the ridge route at the summit and a walk up Devil's Staircase, 
which sounded scary but was actually an old military road from 1750, a snap! 
</P>
<P>
The medium hike seemed about my speed, particularly as two plucky sisters in 
our group, Mary and Elizabeth, both in their 70s, went along. If they could 
walk it, I (a fairly spry 62) also could do it, or so I thought. 
</P>
<P>
The trail led steeply to a deep gash in the mountainside, corrie as the Scots 
call it, with a wall that, from below, appeared uncompromisingly vertical. 
</P>
<P>
What appeared perpendicular was a series of rock slopes that could be 
surmounted. Nevertheless, a slip could have resulted in injury, and the 
climbers certainly would have been safeguarded by wire ropes on crags in the 
Alps. 
</P>
<P>
There were some tricky moments but we made it to the top, puffing and panting, 
elated and triumphant as we looked back. 
</P>
<P>
We were rewarded by an exhilarating ridge walk, the kind that abound in 
Scotland, with sweeping views of the surrounding valleys. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Munro's Mountains 
</P>
<P>
The several peaks we climbed around Glen Coe go by another Scottish sobriquet: 
Each is a Munro, a title given to mountains 3,000 feet and higher, and first 
listed by Sir Hugh Munro, a Scottish mountaineer. 
</P>
<P>
There are 276 of these peaks, some remote and some many miles from the nearest 
highway. But a growing fraternity of Munro addicts' aim is to climb the lot. 
</P>
<P>
Munro-bagging, however, can become a costly and time-consuming obsession. A 
friend living in the south of England drives at least 1,000 miles (at $3.40 a 
gallon) on long weekends to nab a few extra peaks. He has climbed 180. 
</P>
<P>
The most celebrated Munro is the "Cloud-Capped Hill of Heaven" or the 
"Heaven-Kissed Hill," depending which translation from Gaelic you prefer for 
Ben Nevis. Thousands climb Ben Nevis each year and our group was eager to join 
the pilgrimage. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years the climb up Ben Nevis has gained the reputation of an easy 
amble: An automobile chugged to the top in 1911 and there have been numerous 
gimmicky ascents since, including a grand piano that was propelled up the trail 
to publicize a charity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trail Demands Stamina 
</P>
<P>
Runners sprint up and down the 10-mile round trip on what is condescendingly 
known as the "Tourist Path." The record is under 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Ben Nevis demands stamina. Sometimes it kills. 
</P>
<P>
Often, the mountain is slashed by hurricane-force winds and rain and the summit 
is shrouded in impenetrable mists. 
</P>
<P>
Snow sometimes lingers throughout the year and glaciers could form if the peak 
were a few hundred feet higher. In a recent 15-year period 50 deaths were 
recorded, some due to exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Our group continually was warned to prepare for the worst. But for us, Ben 
Nevis put on a rare smiling face: sunny, cloud-flecked skies, temperatures in 
the low 60s, a perfect crystal-clear day. 
</P>
<P>
Our leaders offered two alternative routes: the Tourist Path or a knife-edge 
ridge with acrophobia-inspiring drops on either side. 
</P>
<P>
I chose the easier way and had no regrets, because it allowed us to spend 90 
minutes at the summit enjoying the view. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed that the whole of Scotland was at our feet: from the snowcapped 
Cairngorm Mountains in the east, across the huge cleft of the Great Glen and on 
to the Atlantic Ocean in the west with those bizarrely named islands -- Muck, 
Eigg, Rhum, Mull and Skye -- rising dreamlike from the sea. Visibility: 150 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
A popular hike in the heart of Glen Coe leads to the Coirre Gabhail of "Lost 
Valley," because the upper corrie is invisible from below in the glen. 
</P>
<P>
The Gaelic name has another meaning, the Corrie of Capture, and for good 
reason. There the Macdonalds, the Scottish clan that inhabited Glen Coe, hid 
their plundered cattle. 
</P>
<P>
It is there, too, that 40 of 200 were killed by the Campbells in the infamous 
Glencoe massacre, a saga of murder, mayhem, deception and treacherous abuse of 
hospitality about 300 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
If you climb to the Lost Valley you will find no trace of the carnage. But the 
hike, a steep but easy climb from the Glen Coe road, is worthwhile. Once above 
the rocks, however, you'll suddenly see the hidden valley, desolate and wild, 
hemmed in by soaring crags. 
</P>
<P>
Here is some information, if you hike in the Scottish Highlands: 
</P>
<P>
It rains, sometimes prodigiously, on Ben Nevis a staggering 157 inches 
annually. This means that the hillsides often resemble quagmires. Wear good 
rain gear and tough hiking boots. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the mountains lack trails. Paths sometimes are inadequately blazed or 
cairned. The British believe this keeps things "natural," but it can be 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain know-how is essential, unless you hike with a group and are led on 
recognized routes. 
</P>
<P>
While the hiking is splendid, don't spend all your time on the High Tops. 
Explore more afield in Lochaber, the region surrounding Glen Coe. 
</P>
<P>
A rented car is useful but not essential: A bus route links Ballachulish with 
rail and steamer services to many nearby lochs and islands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Medieval Castles 
</P>
<P>
Oban, a picturesque fishing port, and Ft. William, great for souvenir shopping, 
are a few miles away. Medieval castles seem to sprout from every lake side. 
</P>
<P>
Several British travel organizations offer hiking programs in the Western 
Highlands. Among them: Holiday Fellowship, most convenient to Glen Coe, with 
centers in adjacent Ballachulish, alongside Loch Leven and in nearby Loch Awe. 
The Loch Awe center is a converted railroad hotel with its own railroad 
station. 
</P>
<P>
Both centers operate late April through early October, with weekly rates 
between $300 and $340 per person double, including accommodations and meals. 
</P>
<P>
The cost includes guided hikes but not transportation to trail heads. In 
addition, Holiday Fellowship has an agreement with British Rail that permits 
round-trip travel to the Scottish centers from London for $55, less than a 
third of the regular fare. Contact HF Holiday, 142-144 Great North Way, London, 
England NW4 1EG. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hiking on Mull 
</P>
<P>
Ramblers Holidays offers weeklong hiking on the Isle of Mull, the largest of 
Scotland's Inner Hebrides, from mid-May through September for a tour charge of 
about $305 per person double occupancy, including all meals. 
</P>
<P>
This operator also offers reduced rail fares but cites them only on 
application. Ramblers Holidays, P.O. Box 43, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, 
England AL8 6PQ. 
</P>
<P>
Icelandair flies to Glasgow, Scotland, from Chicago and has an agreement with 
America West for the Los Angeles-Chicago leg of the flight, with connections in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
A shuttle bus operates between Ft. William and Oban, with stops in 
Ballachulish. Rental cars are available in Ft. William and Oban. 
</P>
<P>
If you prefer to hike independently rather than on tour, there is a wide range 
of hotels, guest houses and bed and breakfast inns. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels include Ballachulish, Loch Leven and Alt Nan Ros. Rates fall between $25 
and $40 per person double occupancy, with breakfast. B&amp;Bs are $15 to $20. 
</P>
<P>
There are tourist information centers in Ballachulish and the village of 
Glencoe, with details of events, hotels, outdoor activities and maps. 
</P>
<P>

MAKING BOOKS ON JOYCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After finishing the first chapter of Ulysses and embarking on the rest of the 
book, Karen Kenyon, author of "Joyce's Dublin" (May 7), will find that the 
novel offers many interesting spots worth visiting in and around the Dublin 
area. In fact, all of James Joyce's novels can be used as tour guides of 
turn-of-the-century Dublin. City parks, universities, pubs, libraries and 
government buildings discussed in the novels are still in existence, and 
visiting them brings an interesting life to the masterpieces in which they are 
featured. To discuss one building in one chapter in "Ulysses" hardly uncovers 
the mystique of touring Joyce's Dublin. Yet Joyce's novels are not simply tour 
guides of Dublin. His works are artistic masterpieces of style and form that 
have reshaped modern literature.

THREAT TO BODIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is alarming news of a threat that could do irreparable damage and even 
eventually destroy that wonderful ghost town of Bodie, Calif., which I wrote 
about in The Times last year (May 1, 1988). A Canadian company proposes to 
develop an open-pit mine nearby and remove the entire ridge behind the town 
while attempting to extract gold from 25 million tons of low-grade ore. 
</P>
<P>
Only the protection and tender loving care of the park rangers have kept Bodie 
intact. But some of the 170 buildings are crumbling, while others are frail and 
on the point of collapse. They could never survive the constant rumbling 
vibration of heavy truck traffic and the blasting that are part of a major 
open-pit operation. 
</P>
<P>
A special committee of the California State Park Rangers Assn. has been formed 
to try to save the town. It is called SAVE BODIE! The address is P.O. Box 
28366, Sacramento 95828-0366, (916) 383-2530. Those who care about Bodie and 
would like to help should write to the committee for more information.

Regarding the Consumer Report on Amtrak's problems, hundreds of cars are in 
storage while Amtrak refuses to use anything but Superliners on the western 
transcontinental routes. Besides a shortage of accommodations, 
three-days-a-week service on some routes and a complete lack of service on 
others, this policy leads to a lack of dining and lounge cars for trains that 
split into sections bound for different destinations. Further, the "California 
Zephyr" runs right through Colorado's Glenwood Canyon, where the scenery 
inspired the invention of the dome car, but the only dome in sight is the model 
on the monument that marks the spot.

INSIDER PROFILE: LARGE HOUSES REALM OF 'TEAR-DOWN KING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alan Khaderi wears a couple of hats, but the crown some bestow on him is not to 
his liking: 
</P>
<P>
"Tear-Down King of Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
The developer cringes at the words. He disassociates himself from the wave of 
tear-downs that prompted city zoning law changes in March. And he prefers a low 
profile, though he is president of the residential development arm of Columbia 
Savings, a company with high visibility. 
</P>
<P>
Since Columbia Residential Development was formed under his leadership five 
years ago, it has built and sold more than $100 million in residential 
properties. By Khaderi's count, this represents about 40 homes, 25 of them in 
Beverly Hills, most on razed-home sites. 
</P>
<P>
Khaderi probably has demolished more houses in Beverly Hills than anybody else. 
He was a pioneer in leveling houses to build larger ones, on spec. 
</P>
<P>
But he blames "other people who tried to copy our houses and overdid them or 
built big boxes with little landscaping" for the City Council's action to 
restrict the size of homes on bigger lots in the north part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The move was partly prompted by the construction by other developers of two 
huge houses on a cliff above Coldwater Canyon Park, said city officials, who 
requested anonymity, but one added, "Columbia Savings set the tone for building 
the bigger houses, because they did so many." 
</P>
<P>
Khaderi noted, however, that the zoning changes "will not affect the size of 
our plans, because we've always been under the (new) allotted square footage." 
</P>
<P>
He said he doesn't want the houses he develops to stand out because of unusual 
size or style but, instead, wants them to look as if they were always part of 
the neighborhood, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He considers it a compliment when a new Columbia house is mistaken for a home 
that has been remodeled. He uses mature trees "to give an impression that the 
trees have been there for awhile," and he has put mud between tiles to make 
roofs look old. He also has created weathered, monolithic-looking entries of 
cast concrete. 
</P>
<P>
The houses have fetched base prices from $1 million to $6.5 million. Khaderi 
estimates that 75% of his buyers have been singles or couples, so Columbia 
houses have been generally designed for these markets. 
</P>
<P>
A $5.9-million house he just completed in Bel-Air is typical, although it has a 
carport instead of the standard garage. The 6,892-square-foot house has two 
stories, but the master suite takes up the entire second floor. 
</P>
<P>
And the house has all three ingredients Khaderi says his home buyers want: 
privacy, security and a good location. It is a block away from the home of 
President and Mrs. Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Among its other features are white oak floors, light-colored walls, large 
windows and many skylights -- all part of Khaderi's effort to make interiors 
light and bright, which he learned from veteran builder Fred Smathers, starting 
in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"We built quite a few homes together in Nichols Canyon," Khaderi said. They 
stopped building in the early 1980s, when the economy slowed, and Khaderi 
resumed, with Columbia, when the market picked up again. 
</P>
<P>
When he met Smathers, Khaderi was a full-time dentist with a practice in 
Hancock Park. "I was interested in art history and architecture when I was an 
undergraduate at UCLA," Khaderi said, "but I became a dentist because my mother 
and father wanted me to become a dentist." 
</P>
<P>
He earned his dental degree at USC, where he was a student of Ellis Ring, 
another dentist who became a developer. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a role model for me," Khaderi said of the 75-year-old Ring, who 
developed, with his brother, more than 6,000 apartments in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Now 49, Khaderi is still a dentist after 25 years, though he sees only a few 
patients -- mainly family and friends. "It would have been very difficult for 
me to have given it up entirely," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a real estate developer, Khaderi maintains unpretentious offices in the back 
of a Columbia Savings building in Beverly Hills. As a dentist, he shares an 
office with another dentist in Hancock Park. 
</P>
<P>
"That makes my mother happy," he said, "because she worked to put me through 
USC."

LIGHT AT THE END OF GOPHER TUNNELS;

<P>
THIS OLD-TIME FARM METHOD USES TWO WOODEN TRAPS TO CATCH THE LITTLE CRITTERS. 
</P>

<P>
By BILL SIDNAM, Sidnam has written garden columns and features for The Times 
since 1975.

<TEXT>
<P>
You say you have a gopher problem. You have tried trapping, gassing, poisoning, 
clubbing, drowning and shooting the poor devil with no results. Here is a 
method that, while it is not 100% sure-fire, is close to it. The method was 
taught to me by an old-time, highly successful farmer. I have never seen it 
fail. 
</P>
<P>
The method requires the use of two wooden box traps and your careful attention 
to the directions for completing the three steps involved. 
</P>
<P>
Box traps are available mostly at farm-supply stores and usually are labeled 
"Baitless Gopher Trap." They run about $5 apiece. Unfortunately, these traps 
are sometimes difficult to locate in urban nurseries. If you cannot locate 
them, the wire Macabee traps (widely available) are almost as effective with 
this method. 
</P>
<P>
Warning: Whichever trap you utilize, have the seller demonstrate the correct 
method of setting and handling the trap, and follow carefully the written 
instructions that accompany the trap. Many a careless gopher trapper has 
experienced a smashed finger for his carelessness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Creates Tunnels 
</P>
<P>
Before we go into the actual procedure, it is necessary to examine a little 
background on our quarry: 
</P>
<P>
The gopher lives his life underground, spending much of his time creating 
underground tunnels or runways. Where he mines these runways, he must relocate 
the surplus soil. He does so by creating lateral (branch) tunnels off the main 
runway, where he digs to the surface and deposits mounds of dirt. Aside from 
plant damage, these mounds are the only evidence the gardener has that a gopher 
has invaded his property. 
</P>
<P>
Many people waste their time placing traps or poisons in the holes in the 
center of the mounds of the lateral tunnel. This is a mistake, because the 
gopher usually plugs the lateral tunnel leading to the surface mound and may 
never return to the mound area. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the first step in successfully trapping the varmint is to locate his 
main runway. You do this by probing the gopher hole with a stick until you 
locate the plugged area of the lateral tunnel that is evidenced by loose soil, 
in contrast to the surrounding solid soil. This plugged area will connect you 
with the main runway. 
</P>
<P>
Using a trowel, remove the plugged soil until you hit the main runway. You will 
probably find that the lateral tunnel runs into the main runway at an angle 
about 6 to 10 inches from the surface hole. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traps Face Each Other 
</P>
<P>
When you locate the main runway, use a shovel and dig down from the area 
directly above the main runway until you reach it. The main runway usually is 
located about 10 inches from the surface, but may be even deeper. 
</P>
<P>
The second step involves digging a rectangular area from the surface to the 
runway. It should be large enough to place the two box traps on each side of 
the tunnel so that the two holes at the solid end of the trap face each other 
with about 3 inches separating them. 
</P>
<P>
It is very important not to place the box traps back into the runway or there 
will not be enough room for the traps to spring. Instead, they should be 
aligned so that the rear edges of the traps fit snugly with each runway 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
If you are using Macabee traps, they are smaller and are actually inserted back 
into the runway on each side of your excavation. In addition, the traps are 
anchored by wire to a stake positioned on the soil surface to prevent the 
gopher from dragging the traps back into the tunnel (explained in directions 
accompanying Macabee traps). 
</P>
<P>
In the third step, set the box traps and cover them with a thin coat of peat 
moss or other lightweight material so that light is blocked off from any cracks 
surrounding the traps. However, be certain that the small holes in the solid 
ends of the traps are exposed and will let light enter the trap. This is the 
key to the whole operation. 
</P>
<P>
Gophers do not like any light entering their runways and will enter the trap to 
investigate. In so doing, he will spring the trap and end your gopher problem. 
</P>
<P>
Again, if utilizing Macabee traps instead of box traps, you will have to put 
straw or other lightweight material over both openings in the runway. Separate 
the straw slightly so a little light will enter the runway in both directions. 
</P>
<P>
Using this method, you should trap your gopher within 24 hours and usually much 
sooner. It is very important to use two traps so that you cover both directions 
in the runway. 
</P>
<P>
You will experience some success using just one trap, but your chances for 
success increase dramatically with two traps. 
</P>
<P>
Keep pets and children away from the area until the traps are sprung; when the 
trapping operation is over, store the traps where children cannot get to them. 
</P>
<P>
This method is intended for the gardener who encounters a gopher now and then. 
If you live in an area where gophers are numerous and firmly in command, you 
may want to consider gardening in containers or in raised beds with heavy mesh 
wire underneath.DR, GEORGE CAREY / Los Angeles Times

INTERIOR DECORATOR FACES 14 CHARGES OF THEFT, BAD CHECKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many of the homeowners who did business with Florliza (Flory) Navarrette recall 
being impressed by the Chino Hills interior decorator's persuasive personality 
and sense of style. 
</P>
<P>
Navarrette solicited business among residents of newly built up-scale housing 
tracts in boom areas such as Diamond Bar, Walnut, San Dimas, Chino Hills and 
Orange County. Walking through barren new homes, Navarrette projected images of 
the fashionable furniture and draperies she would have custom-made at a price 
no one could beat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
50% Deposits 
</P>
<P>
Many took her up on her offers, signing contracts and plunking down 50% 
deposits on decorating work that ran into thousands of dollars. Some of those 
customers now believe they were taken. 
</P>
<P>
More than 60 have filed suit against Navarrette, alleging that she performed 
only part of the work, or -- in many cases -- no work at all. Many said they 
have given up hope of getting their money back after Navarrette and her firm, 
Your Design Company Inc., filed for protection under Chapter 7 of U.S. 
bankruptcy laws last month. 
</P>
<P>
Navarrette pleaded not guilty last week in Pomona Superior Court to 10 counts 
of grand theft and four counts of passing bad checks. If convicted, she faces a 
prison sentence of eight to nine years, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Burns. 
Fraud detectives in San Bernardino and Orange counties say they are preparing 
evidence to present to the district attorneys there. 
</P>
<P>
Antonio J. Bestard, Navarrette's attorney, would not comment on the charges 
against the decorator. 
</P>
<P>
"She wants to try the case," he said. "She says she's not guilty." 
</P>
<P>
Disgruntled customers tell similar stories of their experiences with the 
decorator. 
</P>
<P>
Eugenie Liou of Diamond Bar, said she paid Navarrette a $1,350 deposit on 
$2,450 worth of draperies in May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"She just never put the draperies in," Liou said. "We called her and she said 
there were some material problems and she gave us another (installation) date. 
She kept postponing until we cancelled the whole deal." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Claims Rulings 
</P>
<P>
Liou received a small claims judgment for her deposit in Pomona Municipal Court 
last October. "She has not paid us," Liou said. "She says she's going to pay 
off $400 in three months." 
</P>
<P>
Other customers, such as Joyce Riley of Chino Hills, have already been paid 
judgments by Navarrette, after what they describe as arduous legal battles. But 
even those who have gotten their money back said they won't be fully satisfied 
until they see Navarrette sentenced to prison. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way to keep her out of business is for her to be locked up," Riley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, who gave Navarrette a $1,250 down payment last June for draperies she 
said were never installed, has helped organize a network of former customers 
who are angry with the decorator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Customer Network 
</P>
<P>
Using court records and word-of-mouth referrals, Riley and other customers have 
compiled a list of 130 Navarrette customers, who they said are owed more than 
$500,000. Newsletters are sent out regularly to those on the list, apprising 
them of Navarrette's legal situation and instructing them on how to file civil 
suits and criminal complaints against her. 
</P>
<P>
"Be aware: Ignoring your rights to file civil and criminal charges is condoning 
the crime," read one newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
Bestard subpoenaed Riley last week to turn over all the material she has 
collected. Burns said in court Thursday that Navarrette may be planning to sue 
Riley for maliciously causing criminal charges to be filed and suggested that 
Bestard was seeking information for use in that suit. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where he got that idea," Bestard said later of Burns' statement. 
"I'm not a civil lawyer . . . . There's always the possibility of that when 
someone's such a vigilante as Joyce Riley." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hearing on June 14 
</P>
<P>
Bestard said he is only representing Navarrette in her criminal case and that 
he needs Riley's information to prepare a defense. Pomona Superior Court Judge 
James H. Piatt deferred a decision on the subpoena until Navarrette's pretrial 
hearing on June 14. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Bestard said Riley is "not accurately presenting the facts." 
Of the $56,785 involved in the 14 criminal charges, Bestard said, $1,650 -- 
including the money owed Riley -- has been repaid. 
</P>
<P>
After the arraignment, Riley said she was not worried about the prospect of a 
lawsuit against her and denied having a vendetta against Navarrette. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't just me going after Flory," she said. "It's a lot of people standing 
up and being counted." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Informal Soliciting 
</P>
<P>
Most customers came into contact with Navarrette after receiving advertising 
flyers at their new homes or when she canvassed their affluent neighborhoods 
soliciting business. Some customers were referred by Navarrette's husband, 
Nick, after he did grouting work for the new homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Nick would get in the house to go in and seal the floors, then he would 
tell the people, 'My wife's an interior decorator,' " said Evelyn Fournier of 
Whittier, a decorator who worked for the Navarrettes earlier this year. "He 
told me they don't even go to houses that are (worth) less than $350,000." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Velasco, who lives in a gated community, Sorrento Hills in Fullerton, 
said he was approached in this way. 
</P>
<P>
"He did a good job, so we had her give us an estimate," Velasco said. "She gave 
us a bargain price. We ordered wood blinds, draperies, furniture for the living 
room and the family room. She told me that she did a volume business and could 
eliminate middle-man costs." 
</P>
<P>
Velasco said he paid Navarrette a $3,250 deposit in June for the work, which 
was to cost $7,500. After Navarrette missed a series of deadlines, Velasco said 
he hired an attorney in November and threatened legal action. Velasco said the 
draperies were installed in early December and he received some of the 
furniture two weeks later, after giving Navarrette an additional $2,000 check. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leather Couch 
</P>
<P>
Among the furniture delivered, Velasco said, was an expensive leather couch. 
"The couch was dirty," he said. "It was a second-hand couch. It was only 
reupholstered." Velasco said he stopped payment on the check and asked 
Navarrette to take back the couch, but she has not done so. 
</P>
<P>
Some customers said they were initially pleased with Navarrette's work. After 
being satisfied with draperies installed by Your Design Company in 1987, Kim Le 
of Diamond Bar paid Navarrette $2,500 for additional draperies and furniture in 
April, 1988. None of this work was done, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept calling, and she'd say, 'Next week, next week,' for almost a year," Le 
said. "She was very nice. If I'd listened to my husband, I would have gotten 
money back a long time ago. I told him she was very nice, so I would give her 
another chance. I gave her many chances." 
</P>
<P>
The first two of the 10 grand theft charges against Navarrette resulted from 
her alleged failure to fulfill two large contracts. Dr. Amado Mandani and his 
wife, Eva, of San Dimas, filed a police report with Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's fraud detectives after paying $31,000 for furniture they said was 
never delivered. Samuel Villanueva of Laguna Niguel filed a similar report, 
saying he was owed $18,000. 
</P>
<P>
Navarrette was arrested in December on those two charges and released on $2,500 
bail. In the months that followed, she paid off some of the customers who had 
judgments against her, but the prosecutor said he believes she did so with 
deposits paid to her by new customers. 
</P>
<P>
"She's tried to satisfy their claims by taking money from other people and just 
moving the money around in kind of a variation on a Ponzi scheme," Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
Bestard declined to comment on Burns' statement. "I agree that is the district 
attorney's position. I'm not the judge of facts." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decorator's Help 
</P>
<P>
Fournier said she began working for Navarrette in January, unaware the woman 
had been arrested on suspicion of grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me they had a small cash flow problem, but if I was willing to work 
with them, they could turn the business around," she said. "I bought products 
on my credit based on the belief that I would be paid when they were installed 
. . . One day I just realized I had been had." 
</P>
<P>
Fournier, who now owes $8,000 for material she bought for Navarrette, said the 
decorator contracted for work she had no chance of performing. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't have the employees," Fournier said. "When I went to work for her 
she had one lady in a work room." 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino Sheriff's Detective Bart Gray said his ongoing investigation of 
Navarrette's business in Chino Hills also indicates the decorator often made no 
effort to do the work she promised customers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Furniture Orders 
</P>
<P>
"I've made contact with the furniture company they were supposed to be dealing 
with," Gray said. "They never received any money or any orders for furniture 
that these people had already paid for."

<TEXT>
<P>
The votes have been counted, but neither the bruising recall campaign against 
Vice Mayor Frank Blaszcak nor its accompanying atmosphere of recrimination is 
over. 
</P>
<P>
Blaszcak, who lost his City Council seat by nine votes out of almost 3,800 cast 
in last week's election, announced Thursday that he will formally request a 
recount. 
</P>
<P>
And as the rancorous political fight wound down, there were these other 
developments: 
</P>
<P>
Each side charged the other with campaign violations. 
</P>
<P>
Blaszcak supporters said there may have been irregularities in the 
vote-counting process, which was conducted by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the divided City Council talked wistfully about finding a new unity 
and getting back to work. 
</P>
<P>
Of the four remaining council members, two worked for the recall, one worked 
against it and one remained neutral. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost almost a whole year on this," said Councilman James Castaneda, a 
former Blaszcak ally who has since distanced himself from the vice mayor but 
took a neutral position in the recall fight. "A lot of time, energy and money 
has been wasted on this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Barred From Running 
</P>
<P>
With the continuing controversies, no one was speculating last week about 
possible candidates for Blaszcak's seat, which will be filled in a special 
election in September. Blaszcak is barred by law from running. 
</P>
<P>
Blaszcak supporters said reports of voting irregularities are being gathered. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a witness who's willing to testify that there was electioneering going 
on at one of the polling places," Blaszcak said Thursday, one day after the 
last ballots were counted. "In another instance, two people came in and 
misspelled their own names." 
</P>
<P>
He said he and his supporters were also concerned about the "chain of control" 
over ballots on Election Day, suggesting that votes could have been tampered 
with. "There were times when the ballots could have been changed," Blaszcak 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for them to accept this," said Deputy City Clerk Cindy Bookter, 
inviting a challenge to the tally. Bookter, who insisted that the count was 
conducted with strict attention to state law, led the team that recorded the 
3,797 votes cast last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The final count was 1,903 for recall and 1,894 against. The voters opted, by a 
ratio of almost 3 to 1, for a special election to fill Blaszcak's seat rather 
than allow the council to appoint a successor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Out of Envelopes' 
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, Blaszcak said, some ballots had been opened before they 
arrived at the City Council chambers, where the tally was being conducted. "We 
suspect that some ballots were sent from the precincts in envelopes, but they 
resurfaced in the council chambers out of their envelopes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bookter said a recount could be conducted within a few days of the election's 
certification, scheduled for Tuesday's City Council meeting. Blaszcak must pay 
the recount costs of about $1,000, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Recall proponents aired some allegations of their own last week, charging that 
there had been at least one instance of a Blaszcak supporter trying to 
intimidate a voter. They presented Police Chief Don Tutich with an affidavit 
from Alfredo Fernandez, who claimed that a Blaszcak supporter had shown him a 
badge and ordered him to remove a pro-recall lawn sign from his property. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said in an interview that he took the sign down and did not vote in 
the election. Tutich said an inquiry is being made. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking for Explanations 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leaders of both factions were sifting through the remains of the 
campaign, seeking explanations for the results. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor John Tapp and City Councilman Sabino Cici, both leaders in the recall 
effort, contended that the deciding factor had been hard work by pro-recall 
volunteers. "People just got in and gave it all they had," said Cici. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a little bit more desire maybe than they did," said Tapp. 
</P>
<P>
Both acknowledged that a strategy of encouraging many voters to apply for 
absentee ballots had provided the deciding votes. Although Blaszcak ran 
slightly ahead at the polls, he lost the absentee balloting by a margin of more 
than 150 votes. 
</P>
<P>
"We encouraged people that it was easy to vote that way," said Cici, who added 
that the recall committee had printed and circulated 3,000 applications for 
absentee ballots to known recall supporters. He said the absentee strategy 
emulated other successful campaigns, such as a winning slow-growth initiative 
campaign waged last March by PRIDE (Pasadena Residents In Defense Of their 
Environment). 
</P>
<P>
One recall leader, who asked not to be named, said a list of voters who had 
signed recall petitions was used so that get-out-the-vote efforts could be 
focused on residents opposed to Blaszcak. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of Blaszcak's character also played well with the voters, Cici and 
Tapp said. Blaszcak's critics alleged that, 10 years ago, he had offered to 
procure $60 worth of cocaine for a Santa Ana police officer. Despite police 
allegations, Blaszcak was never charged by the Orange County district attorney, 
because of insufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Blaszcak vehemently denied that he had ever offered to procure cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"People didn't vote yes or no based on that," contended Tapp, "but they used it 
as background information." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overconfidence Acknowledged 
</P>
<P>
Members of Citizens for Responsible Development (CFRD), the slow-growth group 
that provided most of Blaszcak's volunteers, acknowledged that they had been 
overconfident. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe we were that out of touch with the way people were voting," 
said Gary Meredith, one member of the group. "We thought we were going to win 
this one." 
</P>
<P>
The discrepancy between the expectation and the outcome has prompted concerns 
about the legitimacy of results, said Meredith. 
</P>
<P>
In a pattern that one Blaszcak supporter described as "like the Civil War -- 
North versus South," the vice mayor carried most of the southern precincts 
while losing most of those in the more affluent areas, north of the Southern 
Pacific Railroad tracks that bisect the city. 
</P>
<P>
But Blaszcak also lost narrowly and unexpectedly in two southern precincts, 
including one that voted strongly for him in last year's City Council election. 
</P>
<P>
That area, the so-called San Gabriel Village, a neighborhood of meandering 
streets and single-family cottages, has been "a CFRD stronghold," said 
Meredith. But in the precinct that includes San Gabriel Village, recall won, 
114 to 109. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to challenge that in every way possible" because CFRD leaders 
believe that Blaszcak should have easily carried that precinct, Meredith said. 
</P>
<P>
Blaszcak had portrayed himself in earlier statements as an underdog from the 
southern part of the city facing "the old guard oligarchy" from the north. 
</P>
<P>
"The north is the stronghold of the oligarchy that has always controlled the 
city," he said. "I think that's a very telling thing." 
</P>
<P>
Cici dismissed such a view as another example of Blaszcak's divisiveness. 
"Frank has never had anything good to say about this city," Cici said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW THE VOTE WENT 
</P>
<P>
16 of 16 precincts. 27.9% turnout 
</P>
<P>
Shall Frank Blaszcak be recalled from the City Council? 
</P>

EPA RETHINKS ITS STRATEGY ON SUPERFUND CLEANUP PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which has spent $8.5 million on 
ground-water contamination in the San Gabriel Valley without developing a 
comprehensive plan or cleaning up any water, is reevaluating its approach. 
</P>
<P>
The reevaluation comes amid growing criticism of EPA by water suppliers, 
community groups and political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conferring on New Strategy 
</P>
<P>
EPA spokesman Terry Wilson said the agency's regional office in San Francisco, 
which oversees the San Gabriel Valley Superfund project, is conferring with 
officials in Washington on a new strategy for attacking ground-water pollution. 
</P>
<P>
That strategy will be unveiled, Wilson said, at a congressional hearing that 
Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) has scheduled in Baldwin Park June 5. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said EPA officials will not discuss any changes in priorities on the 
project until the hearing by the Small Business Committee's subcommittee on 
environment and labor, headed by Torres. 
</P>
<P>
Torres has already berated EPA for a lack of progress in dealing with a 
contamination problem that was discovered nearly 10 years ago and has been on 
the Superfund priority list since 1984. Suspected carcinogens have seeped into 
more than one-fourth of the 400 wells in the Main San Gabriel Basin, 
jeopardizing the water supply of 1 million people. 
</P>
<P>
"From the material presented to me so far by the agency," Torres said, "it 
appears to me that EPA has, at the very least, mismanaged the project. For 10 
years they have been running around in circles trying to decide what to do and 
they still don't know." 
</P>
<P>
EPA also will face strong criticism at the hearing from the Upper San Gabriel 
Valley Municipal Water District, which imports water to the area; the Main San 
Gabriel Basin Watermaster, which oversees pumping from wells in the basin, and 
the Upper San Gabriel Valley Water Assn., which represents water suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
Robert G. Berlien, general manager of the water district, has been authorized 
by all three agencies to tell the congressional hearing that EPA is moving much 
too slowly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
District Manager's Points 
</P>
<P>
In testimony prepared for the hearing, Berlien has outlined these concerns: 
</P>
<P>
EPA has not developed an overall plan or cleaned up any water. "Water suppliers 
do not have a clear understanding of where the cleanup project is headed." 
</P>
<P>
Little progress has been made in finding out how pollutants contaminated ground 
water. The pollutants include trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE) 
and other solvents. The sources must be found to make sure that contamination 
is not continuing and to identify polluters who can be billed for cleanup 
costs. Even though EPA is giving the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control 
Board $1 million a year to find pollution sources, the water board says it will 
take 10 years to complete its initial survey at its present pace. 
</P>
<P>
EPA's decision to concentrate resources and efforts on preventing contaminated 
ground water from moving southward through the Whittier Narrows to the 
neighboring Central Basin is of little help to the San Gabriel Valley. 
Meanwhile, cleanup of the San Gabriel Valley's most polluted region, the 
Azusa-Baldwin Park area, is being deferred. 
</P>
<P>
EPA's decision to spend more than $1.5 million to solve the pollution problem 
of a tiny El Monte water company that serves only 200 homes, Berlien said, 
"does not appear to us to be a reasonable decision." The problem could have 
been solved cheaply with a connection to another water supplier. 
</P>
<P>
EPA's proposed change of engineering contractors "in mid-project can only 
result in significant time delays as one contractor phases out and another 
gears up to take over. Vast amounts of specific site experience will be lost in 
the change and large expenditures will be needed to educate the new engineering 
contractor." 
</P>
<P>
Berlien said he understands that the current contractor, the environmental 
consulting and engineering firm of CH2M Hill, will be replaced on the San 
Gabriel Valley project by the Bechtel Co. next year. Wilson at EPA said that a 
change might be made, but contracts have not yet been signed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staff Increases 
</P>
<P>
In his written testimony, Berlien said the water agencies believe that EPA 
should increase its staff on the San Gabriel Valley project, consider opening a 
local office, accelerate the search for pollution sources and immediately begin 
to clean up heavily contaminated ground water in Baldwin Park and Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of his harsh criticism of the cleanup effort, Berlien said he hopes 
that EPA will not dwell on past mistakes but move forward. "We certainly do not 
wish to see EPA expending its limited resources on justifying its past 
actions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
EPA has committed more than $15.3 million to the ground-water cleanup thus far, 
including $8.5 million already spent. 
</P>
<P>
A new accounting by EPA of funds obligated to the project lists $6.5 million 
for studies of the basinwide problem, $2.3 million for studies in the Whittier 
Narrows area, $1 million for the design of a treatment system for polluted 
wells in Whittier Narrows, nearly $2 million for the study of pollution 
problems of three small El Monte water companies and construction of a 
treatment system for one of them, and more than $1.5 million for a search for 
pollution sources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vast and Complex 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said that organizing the cleanup project has been difficult because the 
problem is so vast and complex. EPA estimated last year that it might take $800 
million and decades of work to remove the industrial solvents that have seeped 
into ground water. 
</P>
<P>
Also testifying at the hearing will be representatives of the East Valleys 
Organization, a church-based community action group that has put ground-water 
cleanup at the top of its agenda. 
</P>
<P>
John L. Korey, chairman of a task force studying the ground-water issue for the 
group, said EPA has not given the San Gabriel Valley the attention it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
"We see this as a key issue in the valley," Korey said. "People are becoming 
concerned." Korey said his group's goal is to create so much awareness of the 
problem that EPA's top administrator in Washington "will wake up in the morning 
worrying about the quality of water in the San Gabriel Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Carol Montano, a task force member, said that although EPA has put "an 
incredible amount of research and investigation" into the San Gabriel Valley 
project, it has failed to pursue polluters aggressively and make them pay for 
the cleanup. "There's definitely been foot-dragging," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GROUND-WATER PROBLEMS IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
Here is an overview of the task facing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
in cleaning up ground water in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Water basin: Forty-six city water departments, private water companies and 
public water districts draw water out of the Main San Gabriel Basin through 
wells and pipe it to homes, businesses, schools and factories. Basin serves 
more than 1 million people in an area that covers nearly all of the San Gabriel 
Valley outside of Pasadena and Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery: Tests in December, 1979, showed high amounts of trichloroethylene 
(TCE), an industrial solvent, in an Irwindale well. 
</P>
<P>
Superfund: EPA added the Main San Gabriel Basin to its list of Superfund 
cleanup sites in 1984 and has spent more than $8.5 million on the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Contaminants: Primarily TCE and tetrachloroethylene, also known as 
perchloroethylene (PCE), both used in dry cleaning and as industrial solvents. 
Lesser amounts of carbon tetrachloride, another solvent. These compounds are 
classified as volatile organics -- volatile because they evaporate easily and 
organic because they contain carbon. 
</P>
<P>
Current status: More than one-fourth of the basin's 400 wells are contaminated 
with volatile organics. About 65 wells are shut down: 35 because of volatile 
organics and 30 because of unrelated contamination from nitrates, stemming from 
fertilizer or failed septic systems. Wells that have not been closed have such 
small amounts of contamination that the water meets state and federal standards 
or the water is treated or mixed with purer water. 
</P>
<P>
Health risk: Some of the compounds have caused cancer in animal experiments. 
But by closing wells and treating or blending water, all water suppliers in the 
San Gabriel Valley are delivering water that meets federal and state drinking 
water standards. 
</P>
<P>
Sources: Suspected causes of polluted wells include leaks from chemical storage 
tanks, spills while storage tanks are being filled or chemicals are being used, 
illegal dumping by companies or individuals, and leaks from scores of dumps

TAIWANESE POLICE ARREST SUSPECT SOUGHT IN 1988 SLAYING IN MONTEREY PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A gunman walked into a crowded restaurant in Monterey Park early one morning 
last November and fatally shot a 40-year-old Taiwanese man. 
</P>
<P>
By last month, Monterey Park police detectives had tracked their suspect to 
Taipei. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of Taiwanese diplomats in Los Angeles who sent crime reports by 
telex to Taiwan, and with the assistance of a Mandarin-speaking Monterey Park 
police reserve officer on vacation in Taipei, Taiwanese police found the 
suspect and put him under surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, police arrested Huang Chue Ming, 35, at Taipei International 
Airport as he attempted to board a flight to the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Park police said Huang has denied killing Hsu Chia Liang at the Sea 
Palace Restaurant on South Atlantic Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
According to an article in last Thursday's Chinese-language Centre Daily News 
published in Monterey Park, Huang told Taiwanese police that five other men 
committed the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Moy said that there have been many theories about the motive for the killing, 
but that "we have nothing concrete." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lived in Monterey Park 
</P>
<P>
Moy declined to provide details about the victim, Hsu, or his family members, 
some of whom still live in the San Gabriel Valley. He did say that the suspect 
and the victim had been in contact before the shooting and that Hsu had lived 
in Monterey Park for several years. 
</P>
<P>
There is no extradition from Taiwan to the United States. The United States 
severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1979. Nevertheless, authorities say, 
Taiwan will likely prosecute Huang for the Monterey Park homicide. Although 
this procedure is unusual, it is not unheard of. 
</P>
<P>
"(Taiwanese officials) just don't like the idea of people leaving their country 
going around committing crimes," Monterey Park Detective Jones Moy said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interviewed 45 Witnesses 
</P>
<P>
Authorities noted that detectives from Monterey Park and the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department had assisted in the Taiwanese prosecution of a killing 
that occurred earlier in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Hsu's killing, Moy and former Police Chief Robert Collins, who 
retired in February but who continued to help in the investigation, have spent 
months interviewing 45 witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
No weapon has yet been found in what was one of seven homicides reported in the 
city last year. And many of the 40 to 50 patrons at the Sea Palace Restaurant 
fled before police arrived shortly after the 1 a.m. shooting. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Collins said, "everybody denied seeing anything." Many of the patrons 
were of Asian descent, Moy said, and this contributed to their reluctance to 
speak with police. Often, police say, newcomers from Asia see police in terms 
of their homelands, where law enforcement officers are viewed more as 
protectors of the government rather than as crime fighters. 
</P>
<P>
The reluctance of some witnesses, Moy said, also resulted from the same 
hesitancy that anyone has. "They just don't want to get involved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, though, police developed enough information to pursue Huang. 
</P>
<P>
During 1987 and 1988, police said, Huang lived at a number of locations 
throughout the San Gabriel Valley. But there was nothing on his record more 
serious than traffic violations, Moy said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suspect Denies Killing 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Moy first contacted Taiwanese officials in the Los Angeles office 
of the Coordination Council for North American Affairs, which functions as 
Taiwan's quasi-embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Later that month, Winston Yuen, a Monterey Park police reserve, visited Taipei 
police and explained the murder case in detail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unsure How Case Will Proceed 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Park police said they are unsure how Taiwanese officials will handle 
the case. And because of the 15-hour time difference, police by Thursday had 
only been able to talk with Taiwanese authorities a few times to sort out 
details. 
</P>
<P>
Liang-Houh Shieh, a Los Angeles attorney who once represented criminal 
defendants in Taiwan, explained that there is no arraignment comparable to the 
American legal system. 
</P>
<P>
He said a judge decides whether a suspect should be charged and whether bail is 
allowed. There is no jury trial, only trial by a judge, Shieh said. Penalties 
are generally stiffer, he said, and defendants have fewer rights than those 
afforded in America. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the legal system is not 100% like it is here," said Daniel T. C. 
Liao of the coordination council. "But we're happy to be able to help American 
officials fight crime." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Liao said, if Monterey Park police aren't satisfied with the 
results in Taiwan, "I don't know how they will close their case" since there is 
no extradition. 
</P>
<P>
Said Collins: "It's hard for us, since we're here and (the suspect) is there."

TARGETS COMPTON VIOLENCE; 
</P>
<P>
NEW COUNCILWOMAN NOT USED TO GIVING UP

<P>
When she was a youngster, Patricia A. Moore and her migrant family spent 
Memorial Day and the Fourth of July picking crops in the Central Valley while 
the parades passed them by. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember . . . asking my father why we couldn't be there. He would say, 
'Baby, next year we're going to see it.' I wanted to be a majorette, so, he cut 
off a broom handle for me." 
</P>
<P>
Determination and years of practice with the broom handle made Moore the first 
black majorette at the high school in Corcoran, the farm town between Fresno 
and Bakersfield where the family settled after her father was paralyzed in a 
farm accident. 
</P>
<P>
The same kind of determination has made Moore a Compton city councilwoman. 
After unsuccessful tries in two previous elections, she won a seat on the 
council in last month's primary. 
</P>
<P>
She was to be sworn in July 1 but, without ceremony, took the oath of office at 
last week's council meeting after Floyd A. James, whom she defeated in the 
April 18 primary election, decided to vacate his seat early to wage a write-in 
campaign against Councilman Robert Adams. 
</P>
<P>
Though there was no time to organize an elaborate celebration or to gather her 
family and friends, the swearing-in was momentous, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shaking because I was so overcome by it . . . asking myself, 'Am I 
ready?' I feel that I am, but you never feel that you're worthy of all the 
people you have such respect for that have supported you." 
</P>
<P>
Though her election was only a month ago, 40-year-old Moore, an outreach 
specialist for the U.S. Census Bureau, dived headfirst into her new duties even 
before her swearing in. She rode night patrols with the Compton police and 
attended the budget work sessions that ended last week. 
</P>
<P>
Her performance during the budget sessions has already impressed some city 
staff members. "I think she'll be the type of person who is going to read all 
the materials," one said, "who does her homework, does research and is involved 
in everything. 
</P>
<P>
"She's very dedicated to the well-being of the community. I think that came 
through in the (budget sessions). She asked some good questions that were 
thought out and had some substance." 
</P>
<P>
In a city beset by bitter rivalries and struggles over who will reap the 
benefits of redevelopment, Moore's success has also sparked criticism. One 
woman active in local politics referred to her as a "political hack" who is 
"unqualified" to sit on the council. 
</P>
<P>
While Moore was attending the daily budget sessions, foes were already asking 
why she was not at work at the Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
"I took time off," Moore said without rancor. "I put in long hours with the 
bureau." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Excellent Work Record' 
</P>
<P>
On most mornings, she said, she is on her way to the bureau by 7. Also, she 
said, her job requires her to work many weekends, speaking at churches and 
other gatherings in an effort to heighten awareness of the importance of the 
population count. "I work very hard. I have an excellent work record there." 
</P>
<P>
While she was working and campaigning this spring, she was also taking four 
classes at Cal State Dominguez Hills, where she is earning her degree in 
political science. 
</P>
<P>
Hard work, though, is nothing new to her. She remembers well the days when she 
and her two younger siblings worked with their parents in the fields. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to travel in the summer to dig potatoes, pick watermelons . . . plums, 
beans, grapes. I couldn't sleep at night because we would sleep on those 
mattresses that were full of bedbugs and they would bite us. I remember, oh, so 
vividly, up before dawn. We were up on the trucks going out to the fields." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teacher's Encouragement 
</P>
<P>
After her father's accident, she, her brother and her sister helped him run a 
small "juke joint" in Corcoran while their mother worked as an attendant for 
home-bound people. A kindly junior high school teacher whom Moore remembers 
only as "Mr. Isaac" convinced her parents that their oldest daughter could 
spend more time in school and still do her share of the work at home. 
</P>
<P>
When she graduated from high school, Moore came to Los Angeles, went to 
business school, worked for the Bank of America, then married and raised three 
children in Compton. The grandmother of a 2-year-old, Moore and her husband, a 
former Compton policeman, separated 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
As a congressional fellow, Moore worked in U.S. Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally's 
office. In 1983 she ran for the City Council against Jane Robbins, with whom 
she will now share the council dais. Four years ago she ran against James and 
lost. She was not planning to run again but when a 2-year-old child was killed 
in Compton during a drive-by shooting earlier this year, Moore said she was 
overwhelmed with the feeling that she had to do something to help her community 
overcome the cycle of violence and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I got tired of people up at the university saying when something happens over 
in Compton you don't stand up and do anything. Where are the people?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Organized Group 
</P>
<P>
Moore organized marches and demonstrations to draw attention to the need for 
gun control and helped establish a group called Mothers Against Violence that 
was made up largely of women who had lost their children in gang shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Creating a safer community, she said, will be her No. 1 priority as a council 
member. "Without people feeling safe," she said, "they don't participate, they 
can't function. They can't shop, they can't water their front lawns." 
</P>
<P>
She said she wants a reevaluation of the Compton Police Department so that more 
patrolmen are on the street. Compton residents, she said, don't have faith in 
their police. The chief, his commanders and his lieutenants, she said, must go 
out into the streets and listen to the people's pleas for more protection. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to look at a more progressive way of dealing with our gang problem," 
she said. "We've got to offer alternative (programs)." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said city officials need to work more closely with their state and 
federal representatives to bring more programs and more money into the city for 
job training, education and recreation.

CRITICISM GROWS AS CONGRESSIONAL HEARING NEARS; 
</P>
<P>
EPA RETHINKS ITS STRATEGY ON WATER CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which has spent $8.5 million on 
ground-water contamination in the San Gabriel Valley without developing a 
comprehensive plan or cleaning up any water, is reevaluating its approach. 
</P>
<P>
The reevaluation comes amid growing criticism of the EPA by water suppliers, 
community groups and political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conferring on New Strategy 
</P>
<P>
EPA spokesman Terry Wilson said the agency's regional office in San Francisco, 
which oversees the San Gabriel Valley Superfund project, is conferring with 
officials in Washington on a new strategy for attacking ground-water pollution. 
</P>
<P>
That strategy will be unveiled, Wilson said, at a congressional hearing that 
Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) has scheduled June 5 in Baldwin Park. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said EPA officials will not discuss any changes in priorities on the 
project until the hearing by the Small Business Committee's subcommittee on 
environment and labor, headed by Torres. 
</P>
<P>
Torres has already berated EPA for a lack of progress in dealing with a 
contamination problem that was discovered nearly 10 years ago and has been on 
the Superfund priority list since 1984. Suspected carcinogens have seeped into 
more than one-fourth of the 400 wells in the Main San Gabriel Basin, 
jeopardizing the water supply of 1 million people. 
</P>
<P>
"From the material presented to me so far by the agency," Torres said, "it 
appears to me that EPA has, at the very least, mismanaged the project. For 10 
years they have been running around in circles trying to decide what to do and 
they still don't know." 
</P>
<P>
EPA also will face strong criticism at the hearing from the Upper San Gabriel 
Valley Municipal Water District, which imports water to the area; the Main San 
Gabriel Basin Watermaster, which oversees pumping from wells in the basin, and 
the Upper San Gabriel Valley Water Assn., which represents water suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
Robert G. Berlien, general manager of the water district, has been authorized 
by all three agencies to tell the congressional hearing that EPA is moving much 
too slowly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
District Manager's Points 
</P>
<P>
In testimony prepared for the hearing, Berlien has outlined these concerns: 
</P>
<P>
EPA has not developed an overall plan or cleaned up any water. "Water suppliers 
do not have a clear understanding of where the cleanup project is headed." 
</P>
<P>
Little progress has been made in finding out how pollutants contaminated ground 
water. The pollutants include trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE) 
and other solvents. The sources must be found to make sure that contamination 
is not continuing and to identify polluters who can be billed for cleanup 
costs. Even though EPA is giving the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control 
Board $1 million a year to find pollution sources, the water board says it will 
take 10 years to complete its initial survey at its present pace. 
</P>
<P>
EPA's decision to concentrate resources and efforts on preventing contaminated 
ground water from moving southward through the Whittier Narrows to the 
neighboring Central Basin is of little help to the San Gabriel Valley. 
Meanwhile, cleanup of the San Gabriel Valley's most polluted region, the 
Azusa-Baldwin Park area, is being deferred. 
</P>
<P>
EPA's decision to spend more than $1.5 million to solve the pollution problem 
of a tiny El Monte water company that serves only 200 homes, Berlien said, 
"does not appear to us to be a reasonable decision." The problem could have 
been solved cheaply with a connection to another water supplier. 
</P>
<P>
EPA's proposed change of engineering contractors "in mid-project can only 
result in significant time delays as one contractor phases out and another 
gears up to take over. Vast amounts of specific site experience will be lost in 
the change and large expenditures will be needed to educate the new engineering 
contractor." 
</P>
<P>
Berlien said he understands that the current contractor, the environmental 
consulting and engineering firm of CH2M Hill, will be replaced on the San 
Gabriel Valley project by the Bechtel Co. next year. Wilson at EPA said that a 
change might be made, but contracts have not yet been signed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staff Increases 
</P>
<P>
In his written testimony, Berlien said the water agencies believe that EPA 
should increase its staff on the San Gabriel Valley project, consider opening a 
local office, accelerate the search for pollution sources and immediately begin 
to clean up heavily contaminated ground water in Baldwin Park and Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of his harsh criticism of the cleanup effort, Berlien said he hopes 
that EPA will not dwell on past mistakes but move forward. "We certainly do not 
wish to see EPA expending its limited resources on justifying its past 
actions," he said.

<P>
Cal State Long Beach is about to become the first campus in the California 
State University and Colleges system to declare itself a "smoke-free" 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
A recommendation by the Faculty Senate expected to be approved by university 
President Curtis L. McCray would ban smoking beginning in the fall in all 
campus buildings except the student union and dormitories. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the state of our ventilation, when you smoke in a closed interior the 
smoke is extended beyond the confines of a small room," said June Cooper, vice 
president of faculty and staff relations, who said she brought the issue before 
the Faculty Senate after receiving numerous complaints. "This (expresses our) 
concern for the health hazards of nonsmokers and our concern for providing a 
safe and healthy working environment."

WE MUST SAVE OUR PUBLIC BEACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The beaches of Southern California are unique. They are truly some of the great 
beaches of the world. Anything that would destroy these beaches would be a 
disaster to all our citizens. The beaches are a public asset that must be 
operated and administered as a public trust, in the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
Recently the city of Santa Monica approved plans for the development of a 
luxury hotel on state-owned park property, explaining the land was being 
"under-utilized" and that they were not receiving sufficient rent (Incredibly, 
this is the city where many landlords are being paid a fraction of what they 
would receive in a free market). Santa Monica has already approved two other 
beach hotels -- now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
If we allow this development on state park property, it will not be too long 
before other developments begin and our coast will resemble Miami Beach. Let 
the state operate the state-owned land with the goal to maximize public use and 
access without commercial development. Our beaches are unique and beautiful. 
Let's preserve them for future generations. The city of Santa Monica has shown 
it is not worthy of controlling this public trust land.

ACTIVISTS HIT GOAL TO SAVE EAGLE ROCK, KEEP GOING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ESTHER SCHRADER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eagle Rock activists have raised $10,000 as part of an effort to persuade city 
officials to buy the 50-foot boulder from which the community gets its name. 
</P>
<P>
The mark was set as an initial fund-raising goal. But the activists say they 
are not stopping now. 
</P>
<P>
The Save the Eagle Rock Committee, a community group formed last year to fight 
a developer's proposal to build apartments on the land that includes the rock, 
is asking the city to create a public park on the 2.2-acre lot. 
</P>
<P>
The committee reached its self-imposed goal by selling paperweights in the 
shape of the rock and T-shirts with "Save the Eagle Rock" printed on them. The 
group also organized a pancake breakfast that drew city officials, including 
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Stopping' 
</P>
<P>
"Now that we've found out how easy it is, we're gonna change the goal to 
$20,000," said Katie Smith, chairwoman of the committee. "You can tell 
everybody we're not stopping." 
</P>
<P>
The residents who formed the committee have said that if the city does not find 
the money to buy the property north of the Pasadena Freeway, they will buy it 
themselves. Their effort has gained widespread support in Eagle Rock and among 
residents groups throughout Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have said they will do everything they can to buy the land at a 
reasonable price. In November, the city hired an appraiser who estimated the 
value of the land at $500,000, said Brad Sales, spokesman for Councilman 
Richard Alatorre. The city Department of Recreation and Parks has set aside 
$230,000 to purchase the land, and a number of city officials have said they 
support the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are also exploring the possibility of swapping a city-owned lot 
for the land that includes the rock, Sales said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Historical Monument 
</P>
<P>
The southwest portion of the rock is a sheer cliff that looms imposingly above 
the Ventura Freeway. The cliff has an indentation in its face that produces an 
eagle-shaped shadow in the afternoon. The entire rock formation was declared a 
historical monument in 1982 by the city's Cultural Heritage Board but was not 
acquired by the city.

HERO DOG WINS PRAISE FOR SAVING HER OWNER

<P>
When the phone rings at Luella Ball's Arcadia home these days, the caller 
usually wants to reach a resident named Shasta. 
</P>
<P>
Shasta, however, can't come to the phone. She is usually napping on the car 
seat of a '72 red Opel or hiding under a camellia bush. 
</P>
<P>
A petite, 20-pound white spitz, Shasta is a hero dog in big demand. In January, 
a fire engulfed Ball's den at 2 a.m., and before the flames spread to the rest 
of the house, the dog awakened her sleeping owner. Recently, Shasta won an 
annual heroism award from the Los Angeles Society for Prevention of Cruelty to 
Animals. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time the phone rings, it is something about Shasta," said Ball, 75, a 
longtime Arcadia resident. 
</P>
<P>
There have been offers of free dog food from a kennel club, requests for 
interviews and an invitation to appear at a spitz show. 
</P>
<P>
The fluffy, 4-year-old canine has been in the limelight ever since the pre-dawn 
Jan. 13 fire. An ember from a fireplace ignited a recliner chair -- where 
Shasta sleeps -- then spread to other furniture, the carpet and the drapes. A 
television and a stereo melted into Dali-like forms. The smoke was thick and 
the heat intense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Overcome With Smoke' 
</P>
<P>
"She was so overcome with smoke that she could not bark," Ball said. "Two times 
she pounded my bedroom door with her body." 
</P>
<P>
That noise was enough to wake Ball, who, with another dog, managed to make her 
way to the kitchen to dial 911. Shasta was unable to walk any further, so Ball 
had to push her out the back kitchen door. 
</P>
<P>
Ball and the dogs were unharmed in the blaze. By the time the fire was 
extinguished, they had recuperated from smoke inhalation. For the next five 
months, they lived in Ball's recreational vehicle until repairs on the house 
were completed. 
</P>
<P>
Word of Shasta's bravery reached the Los Angeles SPCA, which decided to give 
her the seventh annual Hero Dog Bruce Farrell Award. The award was established 
by Pauline De Farrell when her dog, Bruce Farrell, saved her from an attacking 
Great Dane. A plaque and a $100 check were presented to Ball and Shasta at a 
recent ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel she suffered an awful lot," Ball said, holding Shasta in her lap. 
"During the fire, all I could think of was to get out with her." 
</P>
<P>
The rescue is somewhat of a role reversal for Ball. For 20 years, she has been 
a foster parent to abused and neglected dogs. She would often take in several 
dogs at a time until permanent homes could be found. An avid gardener, Ball 
would sell her staghorn ferns, citrus trees and iris bulbs to pay for 
veterinary bills. 
</P>
<P>
She says that before the fire, she was planning to retire from this 
time-consuming role and put Shasta up for adoption because of her constant 
barking and obedience problems. Several interested people called her and 
offered to adopt Shasta. 
</P>
<P>
But just as Ball had rescued Shasta from a neglectful owner a year and a half 
ago, Shasta had saved her life from the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"She has attached herself to me," Ball said. "In my heart that changed my 
mind."

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

<TEXT>
<P>
1990 Budget 
</P>
<P>
The House passed, 241 to 185, the conference report on House Resolution 106 
giving Congress spending, revenue and deficit targets for the fiscal year 
beginning Oct. 1. The Senate followed suit and HR 106 is now in effect. 
</P>
<P>
The fiscal plan was developed by the Republican White House and Democratic 
Congress. It formalizes President Bush's pledge of no new taxes but projects 
$5.3 billion in largely unspecified new revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The plan assumes spending of $1.17 trillion, revenue of $1.07 trillion and a 
deficit within the Gramm-Rudman law's $100-million target. All sides conceded 
it avoids tough fiscal decisions and that its goal of a $100-million deficit is 
wishful thinking. Members looking for a bright spot said the agreement shows 
the President and Congress can work harmoniously toward fiscal goals. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the fiscal 1990 budget.

ALICE KAHN: TABLE TALK AMONG THE TRENDOIDS

<TEXT>
<P>
"I don't think I was meant to be a mother," Bree Wellington told her old friend 
Mai Blender over lunch at the Quilted Adobe. 
</P>
<P>
"Meant, schmeant," opined Mai, a licensed therapist and an amateur 
sarcasticist. "You've got the kid. Even Nordstrom won't take her back." 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I love Rachel Whoopi as I've never loved another human being. I 
can't imagine life without her," Bree said, fiddling with the heel of the 
baguette. "It's just that I don't think I have the patience." 
</P>
<P>
They were interrupted by the sight of the waiter standing there like a symphony 
conductor demanding their complete attention before he began his performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Our specials today are the George Bush Squid Pro Quo with a confit of figs, 
papaya, mango and corn. We also have a Dan Quail, lightly roasted with a 
polenta happy face. And finally, there is the Jim Wright Pork Barrel with a 
salad of mixed greens and aged goat cheese. The soup today is chayote, and our 
wine of the week is Cheek Creek white Zinfandel at $6.50 a glass." 
</P>
<P>
"Do we get to keep the glass? Does it have our team's name on it?" asked Mai. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll have the Bush and a glass of the Creek," Bree said, her look telling the 
waiter to indulge her boorish friend. 
</P>
<P>
"Gimme the Quail and a glass of Diet Coke with a twist," Mai told the waiter. 
Then she turned to Bree and asked, "You paying?" After Bree nodded, Mai added, 
"Throw in a bowl of the chayote soup." 
</P>
<P>
"Mommy, Mommy," screamed the little boy at the next banquette, "that lady's 
eating a coyote." 
</P>
<P>
"Nicodemus," his mother said. "Get your bolo tie out of your spaetzle!" 
</P>
<P>
Mai looked at the boy and then made the finger-down-the-throat gesture to Bree. 
She leaned forward and whispered, "Hell is other people's children." 
</P>
<P>
She moved on to another subject that she knew would get a rise out of Bree. 
"Have you heard the latest about Neal Blender?" she asked, referring to her 
husband circa 1974 and Bree's lover circa 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"He's dating Cher," she said and began snickering. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's impossible," Bree protested. "Neal's over 30." 
</P>
<P>
"I know," Mai cackled, "but it's true. He told me she might even name a perfume 
after him -- Neal. But she'll spell it K-n-e-e-l. Kneel by Cher -- share the 
fantasy -- something like that." 
</P>
<P>
"Forgive me, Mai. I know you were married to the man for five years, but why 
would anybody give up that pretty little Rob Camilletti for a balding, 
40-year-old wanna-be screenwriter?" 
</P>
<P>
"I guess for the same reason that you almost broke up with Dirk to nestle with 
Neal." 
</P>
<P>
"Now, just a minute. That was before Dirk and I were married and, of course, 
well after your separation from Neal. 
</P>
<P>
"Relax," Mai said, picking up the crumbs of the baguette from the tablecloth 
and licking them off her fingers. "Neal and I had an open marriage anyway. 
That's why we ended up divorced." 
</P>
<P>
Just then, the waiter put down the bowl of chayote and slid the squid toward 
Bree. As they were digging in, a man in a military uniform with a bandoleer 
belt across his chest suddenly raced through the terra-cotta restaurant 
brandishing a machine gun. A fig fell from Bree's mouth to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
The man fired a rat-a-tat at the ceiling, but nothing happened. Then he 
shouted, "The Creme Brulee is excellent!" 
</P>
<P>
The waiters then surrounded him and escorted him out like assistants at a James 
Brown concert. Before he exited through the kitchen, he screamed back, "The 
Creme Brulee -- and tell them Gaucho sent you." 
</P>
<P>
There were just 10 seconds of silence before the sophisticated urban diners, 
accustomed to a world of mania and mayhem, returned to quiet talk about ruined 
relationships and done deals. 
</P>
<P>
Mai slurped her chayote and said, "This restaurant-as-theater bit has gone too 
far."

CALLIGRAPHY BY COMPUTER WITH THAT HANDMADE TOUCH

<P>
Addressing wedding invitations by computer? Surely Miss Manners would 
disapprove. 
</P>
<P>
Well maybe, and maybe not. Meet InScribe, a computerized calligraphy system 
that's so sophisticated that it even makes tiny errors -- just like a real 
human calligrapher. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a printer, the InScribe uses a mechanical claw holding a calligraphy 
pen attached to an Epson Equity II computer. Because it employs a real pen, the 
result is lettering virtually indistinguishable from hand-drawn calligraphy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hand-Drawn Look 
</P>
<P>
"At first, the lettering was too perfect," says Joe Sieber, the president of 
Massachusetts-based InScribe Inc. "People wanted it to have the look of 
hand-drawn calligraphy. So we went back and altered the program to produce tiny 
glitches in some of the letters. We also used an ink that can smear ever so 
slightly for additional realism." 
</P>
<P>
Sieber got the idea for the Inscribe system several years ago while ordering 
his own wedding invitations. With the help of his brother, Jon, a graduate of 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer science program, he 
developed the system. It was an almost instant success, selling to large 
corporations, colleges and independent stationery stores. 
</P>
<P>
InScribe uses a "lettering bed," a flat surface to which calligraphy paper is 
attached by magnets. The operator composes the document on the Epson monitor, 
hits a button and the mechanical claw proceeds to letter the document. 
</P>
<P>
The InScribe is not speedier than a human calligrapher, but Joe Sieber points 
out one major advantage of machine over man. "The InScribe," he says "never 
gets writer's cramp." 
</P>
<P>
The basic system costs $8,500 for computer, lettering bed, software and four 
font styles. Additional type styles -- more than 60 in all -- are available 
starting at $200 apiece. And there are more than 60 ink colors available as 
well, with gradations of hue so subtle that the company can offer baby pink, 
bubble gum pink, conch pink, hot pink, and scorching hot pink. (For wedding 
invitations, however, etiquette dictates only black or blue-black.) 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Bank and the universities of Texas and Connecticut 
are among the organizations with their own InScribe Systems. Even the White 
House, where there are calligraphers on staff, has purchased an InScribe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Fun' 
</P>
<P>
Nathalia Adrian of the Los Angeles County Office of Protocol says that the 
staff uses its InScribe almost daily, for certificates, envelopes, invitations 
and book inscriptions. "It's fun," she says. "And it's easy to use." 
</P>
<P>
For those interested in having their next invitations InScribed, the cost 
ranges around $2 an invitation at Los Angeles area stationery stores that offer 
the system. Brides who dread the tedium of addressing thank-you notes can have 
envelopes made up at the same time they order their wedding invitations, using 
the invitation list already in the computer. 
</P>
<P>
The Siebers are now introducing In-A-Flash, a laser printer that can print up 
mass quantities of invitations very quickly. They also intend to continue 
expanding type styles; one of their latest, Kidstuff, simulates a child's 
printing, down to the reversed E's and R's.

MYSTERY WRITERS LEAVE CLUES FOR NOVICES PLOTTING WHODUNITS

<P>
One mystery about mystery writing is where the creators of Sherlock Holmes and 
Sam Spade get their plots. 
</P>
<P>
Sara Paretsky, author of five novels featuring the Chicago private investigator 
Vi Warshawski, including "Bloodshot," says she has no problem. 
</P>
<P>
She gets her plots from the Wall Street Journal and the Chicago Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm on the lookout for always is political or financial or industrial 
fraud on a scope or scale that might lead one to commit murder in order to 
prohibit this fraud from coming to light," Paretsky said recently at the 
Mystery Writers of America annual convention. 
</P>
<P>
The message from mystery writers this year is that industrial fraud is in 
vogue, along with environmental disaster. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sex it Out 
</P>
<P>
Sex, however, is out. 
</P>
<P>
"People who want sex should read romances," said Matthew Sartwell, an editor at 
New American Library. "Mysteries are going to more contemporary settings, 
dealing with the environment and health." 
</P>
<P>
Warren Murphy, looking at ease in a tweed jacket and knit tie, refrained from 
chewing his bushy mustache when he told a group of would-be mystery writers, 
"Plot is the simplest part of this business." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, who has written more than 100 novels, including "Too Old a Cat," upon 
which the television series "Murphy's Law" is based, told the group: "God 
either made you a writer or God made you not a writer. But if you are a writer, 
then I or anyone else in this business could probably help you become a 
novelist." 
</P>
<P>
His two main pieces of advice: come up with a title, and summarize the novel in 
one sentence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Map Out Plots 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Paretsky, who confessed to having tossed out several false starts of 60 
or 70 pages, Murphy warned writers to carefully map out their plots before 
putting pen to paper. 
</P>
<P>
"I never throw out 60 pages," he said. "I hate to write. And it would be a 
shame to waste that material." 
</P>
<P>
While the pair did not come to blows -- she didn't slip him any poison; he 
didn't take out a knife -- they agreed on little and revealed even less. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did Donald Westlake, whose latest works are "Trust Me on This" and "Sacred 
Monster," or Lawrence Block, the author of "Eight Million Ways to Die" and 
"When the Sacred Gin Mill Closes," reveal his secret to creating characters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'An Intuitive Process' 
</P>
<P>
"How do I do it?" said Block, who looks like an aging hippie. "It's an 
intuitive process. I really don't know," said the creator of Matthew Scudder, a 
former alcoholic detective, and Bernie Rhodenbarr, a private eye and 
gentlemanly thief. 
</P>
<P>
Looking like an unassuming English professor in his best navy blue blazer, 
Westlake revealed with a twinkle in his eyes that he could never write about 
someone being presented to the Queen of England, because he had never had that 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
"But I can write about a man driven by a desperate need for money, because, 
once or twice, I've been driven by a desperate need for money." 
</P>
<P>
Priscilla Ridgeway, the group's executive secretary, said the market for 
mysteries is booming. 
</P>
<P>
"Mysteries are on a roll. Whether you're talking spy or cozy (in the tradition 
of Agatha Christie), they're hot. We get requests all the time for mystery 
cruises, mystery weekends. I'm holding out for the one up the Amazon." 
</P>
<P>
The mystery writers and their fans, an eccentric looking group complete with 
the occasional ascot, wide-brimmed hat and trench coat, were in town for the 
organization's annual convention, called Edgar Allen Poe Week, which culminated 
in a black-tie gala for the 42nd annual bestowing of the Edgars, their version 
of the Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Best Mystery 
</P>
<P>
The Edgar for best mystery of the year went to Stuart Kaminski's "Cold Red 
Sunrise"; and Hillary Waugh was named a grandmaster of the mystery writers' 
craft. 
</P>
<P>
Waugh said he finds his plots everywhere. "You read a story and that gives you 
an idea. Or I see a newspaper headline and I think was what a great starting 
place. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are really having a hard time, read true murder cases and get an idea 
from them. When all else fails, sit down or lie down and let your mind roam and 
find things coming to you from your own life." 
</P>
<P>
Block says he gets his ideas from just hanging out in the city, "listening to 
what people say. There are so many crazy things going on you can always find 
something."

MARATHONERS WHO RUN HOT, COLD;

HYPOTHERMIA CHIEF ENEMY OF INEXPERIENCED RUNNERS

<P>
Question: I've started two marathon races, but both times I've had to drop out 
because I got overheated. But I've heard stories about other marathoners that 
had to drop out of a race because they got too cold. How can it ever be 
possible for someone who is running in a marathon to become too cold? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I assume that neither of the marathons in which you participated was 
held on a cold, windy or wet day. If you try this some time, you will find that 
heat loss (hypothermia) can be a serious problem. 
</P>
<P>
Hypothermia is most likely to occur if the runner proceeds at a relatively slow 
pace. Among inexperienced marathoners (which, I believe, would include you), 
the critical time comes during the second half of the race when fatigue causes 
the runner to slow the pace. At such times, the body may very well be losing 
heat faster than it is producing it. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there any explanation for the fact that some children are simply more 
graceful than others? For example, some boys seem to be natural athletes, while 
others have two left feet. Why should there be such a difference in children? 
</P>
<P>
A: What you are describing may simply be two ends of a spectrum of motor 
skills. At one end are the natural athletes; at the other, less gifted 
children. 
</P>
<P>
It has been suggested that some clumsiness may be the result of minimal brain 
damage. Once this has been ruled out, it would seem that children simply differ 
in relation to their motor skills just as they differ in intelligence and other 
traits. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm just beginning to realize how many conditions are being treated with 
hypnosis. I've heard of its being used by dentists and by women at the time 
they give birth. Would it ever be possible for a child to be hypnotized? 
</P>
<P>
A: The peak age for susceptibility to hypnosis has been reported to range from 
7 to 10 years; it then declines with age. Children can also learn self-hypnosis 
more easily than is possible with adults. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You have mentioned at various times that a loss of weight and poor sleep are 
symptoms of depression. Is this always true? 
</P>
<P>
A: Weight loss and insomnia can be symptoms of depression. However, a person 
may experience weight loss and impaired sleep because of some medical condition 
or even as a side effect of medication. Similarly, sleep disturbance due to the 
need for frequent urination would not be considered a symptom of depression.

ART NOTEBOOK: MORE FIRST-TIME ART COLLECTORS SEE GALLERIES AS COMMODITY BROKERS 
</P>

<P>
With inflation in the con temporary art market at an all-time high, it is not 
just serious collectors who are looking to turn a profit on their investments. 
</P>
<P>
According to several Los Angeles-based galleries, the lure of investment 
potential is trickling to people who are just beginning to buy and collect 
contemporary art. The Tamara Bane Gallery in West Hollywood, which has recently 
presented exhibitions by up-and-coming artists Aldo Luongo and Mark Kostabi, 
will be presenting a pop art show this summer featuring works by Kostabi and 
graffiti artist Keith Haring, among others. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unbelievable," says Robert Bane, gallery president. "We don't 
specifically sell for investment purposes, but our clients are definitely more 
investment-oriented now." 
</P>
<P>
Tamara Bane, gallery vice president, concurs with her husband's assessment, 
pointing out that limited-edition art -- lithographs and serigraphs -- by Mel 
Ramos, expected to sell for $4,000 to $6,000, has been fetching $45,000 in the 
inflationary market. "People who have never been serious investors are 
realizing that modern art is a pretty secure investment," she says, "and it 
seems to be escalating." 
</P>
<P>
"Today, investment potential seems to be the first thing on everyone's mind," 
says Jan Turner of the Jan Turner Gallery in Los Angeles. She recently curated 
a show of the works of painter Carlos Almaraz. Turner says that Almaraz' works 
in the $3,000 range are appreciating by more than $1,000 a year -- "and I don't 
see an end to it. If the bottom drops out, it won't be in just the modern art 
market, but in the economy in general." 
</P>
<P>
Candace Lee of the Saxon-Lee Gallery in Los Angeles concurs but adds, "It's not 
really affecting us, because our business is in the secondary art market -- art 
that sells for the second time." Lee, who recently returned from the Chicago 
Art Fair, noted that this year the European galleries represented there had 
only brought investment-quality, blue-chip work for consideration, rather than 
works by new or emerging artists. 
</P>
<P>
Even small galleries such as Contemporary Images of Woodland Hills are feeling 
the ripples from the inflation at the larger galleries. Co-owner Ruth Banarer 
says, "People are looking for names. They're very careful in what they're 
buying. Even if they're purchasing prints, they're purchasing collectable 
prints as opposed to decorative prints -- not so much things to hang in their 
home. 
</P>
<P>
CALIFORNIA ROLL: After a year or so of inactivity, the Santa Monica Art Tool 
will finally be rolling down the beach from Ocean Park to the Pacific 
Palisades, beginning today at 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Sculptor Carl Cheng created a 9-by-12-foot concrete roller, similar to one used 
to pave asphalt, and installed it on the Santa Monica beach in the spring of 
1988. It has a surface of indentations that, when driven over the sand, imprint 
a miniature landscape of Los Angeles. The mini-cityscape, titled "Walk on 
L.A.," will be 2 inches high and 3 miles long. 
</P>
<P>
The Tool will also roll down Santa Monica Beach at 9 a.m. this summer on June 
11, July 3 and 23, Aug. 20, Sept. 4, and Oct. 30. For further information call 
the Santa Monica Arts Foundation at (213) 458-8350.

CALIFORNIA DREAMINGS: The first museum exhibition of Australian aboriginal art 
to tour the United States, "Dreamings: The Art of Aboriginal Australia," is on 
exhibit at the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History through July 29. It 
is co-sponsored by the Westfield Group and the CAZ Gallery of West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the exhibit, the Westside Pavilion in West L.A. will be 
celebrating Australia through July, with banners throughout the shopping center 
and an information desk at the west end of the pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers who stop by the information desk and join the museum will be given a 
gift certificate to Koala Blue, Olivia Newton-John's Australian boutique on the 
third floor of the mall. 
</P>
<P>

COELHO TO RESIGN FROM CONGRESS; 
</P>
<P>
FACING ETHICS PROBE, CALIFORNIAN REPORTEDLY SAYS IT'S TIME TO LEAVE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Tony Coelho, the third-ranking member of the House Democratic leadership, 
is resigning from Congress, sources said Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The stunning decision by the 46-year-old Californian follows mounting reports 
of ethical problems that threatened to block his advancement up the leadership 
ladder. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho's announcement was made in the form of an interview with the New York 
Times. In it, Coelho (D-Merced) said that he did not want to put his party and 
his colleagues through a protracted investigation of his personal finances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Chance to Move On' 
</P>
<P>
"I want to give my party a chance to move on," he said. "I don't intend to put 
my party through more turmoil. I don't intend to put this institution through 
more turmoil. And more importantly, I don't intend to put my family through 
more turmoil." 
</P>
<P>
Coelho had been expected to face investigations by the House and the Justice 
Department for a 1986 investment involving the purchase of $100,000 in junk 
bonds underwritten by the investment firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert. He has 
acknowledged failing to report on his financial disclosure form the help that 
he received from a Columbia Savings &amp; Loan executive in buying the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation announcement came only hours after Coelho's press spokesman had 
informed reporters that his boss was planning to jump into the expected race 
for House majority leader "with both feet." 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Washington were thunderstruck by the news, which came near the end 
of a tumultuous week that saw House Speaker Jim Wright move toward an expected 
resignation this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, my God," said George Kundanis, a top aide to House Majority Leader Thomas 
J. Foley (D-Wash.) when he learned from a reporter of Coelho's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Foley is expected to become the new Speaker if Wright's resignation takes 
place. That would open up his job as Democratic leader, the No. 2 position in 
the House. Coelho had been regarded as the front-runner for that post. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A New Challenge' 
</P>
<P>
"If I can't be leader and if I can't be whip," Coelho told the New York Times, 
"it's time to try a new and different challenge. Therefore, June 15, which is 
my 47th birthday, will be my last day in the Congress." 
</P>
<P>
Coelho's unexpected move clears the way for Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of 
Missouri to enter the race for majority leader. Gephardt and Coelho met Friday 
in the latter's Capitol office. 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates in the race are expected to include Rep. Ed Jenkins of 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
There will also be a spirited fight for the post of majority whip, which Coelho 
is vacating. The likely candidates include Reps. William H. Gray III of 
Pennsylvania, David E. Bonior of Michigan and Beryl Anthony Jr. of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Common Cause, the liberal lobby group, called for a House ethics 
investigation of Coelho. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to House Ethics Committee Chairman Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), 
Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer said that a formal House inquiry is 
needed to determine whether Coelho violated rules prohibiting members from 
accepting "favors or benefits" under questionable circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho has admitted that he did not report details of a 1986 junk bond 
transaction that netted him $6,882 in six months -- a deal in which he put up 
none of his own money. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho also admitted underpaying his tax on the bond transaction by more than 
$2,000. He blamed his accountant for the error.

ZHAO AND UP TO 6 OTHER MODERATES REPORTED TARGETS OF PURGE IN CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A conservative Chinese leader Friday indirectly denounced Communist Party chief 
Zhao Ziyang's reformist faction for plotting "schemes and intrigues" against 
the party, amid reports that Zhao and as many as six other moderates were 
targeted for a purge. 
</P>
<P>
The public attack was another indication that the conservatives had gained an 
upper hand in the leadership power struggle that was provoked by the 
student-led pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
"The dogs are biting the dogs, fighting for a bone," said one Beijing resident, 
describing the fiercest power struggle in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese sources said hard-line leaders had summoned senior Communist Party 
members to Beijing for a special meeting, and state radio broadcast an order to 
rank-and-file party members to "carry on their duties" and "immediately quit 
demonstrations." 
</P>
<P>
Word of what could be the biggest leadership purge in a decade came as students 
leading the democracy movement voted overwhelmingly to continue occupying 
Beijing's central Tian An Men Square, despite increasing chances of a 
crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
But there were no protests Friday at the square, and the number of occupying 
students camped in a shantytown of plastic tents dwindled to between 20,000 to 
25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran party conservative Chen Yun, in a nationally televised address, warned 
of a secret plot aimed at toppling paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and his 
allies, including Premier Li Peng. 
</P>
<P>
Chen did not mention Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang by name, but his attack 
clearly was aimed at Zhao's liberal reformist faction of the party. 
</P>
<P>
"We old comrades must resolutely expose and struggle against a very, very small 
number of people who have fabricated schemes and intrigues, and never yield to 
them," Chen said. 
</P>
<P>
"This turmoil is truly not coincidental. One of the important reasons is that 
for a certain period of time we have eased off education in Marxist thought," 
he said in language reminiscent of chaotic factional strife and leadership 
struggles of the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese and Western sources said that Zhao, Defense Minister Qin Jiwei and as 
many as five others were marked for a purge for opposing conservative Li's 
decision to declare martial law a week ago and deploy troops in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Zhao and Qin were believed to have been under a form of house detention all 
week but had yet to be formally arrested, Chinese sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said the six were considered part of an "anti-party clique" that 
failed to stem student protests that sparked the largest anti-government 
demonstrations since the founding of the communist state in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese sources said that in order to lend the coming purge an air of 
legitimacy, the shake-up would not be announced until after the conservatives 
succeeded in holding a special plenum of the party's Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
As the country awaited results of the power struggle, state radio broadcast an 
order to rank-and-file party members. 
</P>
<P>
"All party members have to remain in their posts, carry on their duties 
carefully and observe martial law" and "immediately quit demonstrations, the 
petitions, the strikes and the boycotting of classes." 
</P>
<P>
Of China's 1 billion people, only 47 million are party members. Although some 
party members joined in the pro-democracy protests, most demonstrators were 
non-party students and workers. 
</P>
<P>
Premier Li appeared to be consolidating his authority, after resurfacing 
Thursday for the first time since the power struggle erupted and declaring the 
Deng government "capable and stable." 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party newspaper People's Daily carried a statement Friday by the 
political department of the Beijing region's military command throwing its 
support behind the martial law decree issued a week ago Saturday by Li. The six 
other military commands surrounding the capital had issued similar statements 
earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats said the army has moved more troops into the city's outskirts 
in recent days. At least 80,000 soldiers were believed encircling the capital 
after failing in initial attempts last weekend to break through citizens' 
barricades, the diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
Li, whose resignation has been called for by the protesting students, said 
Thursday that the army had stopped not because it was unable to move but 
because it had been "tolerant" of the peaceful demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
The Western and Chinese sources said Zhao had been named as leading an 
"anti-party clique." They noted that military statements backing the martial 
law decree criticized a conspiracy by a "small group of people." 
</P>
<P>
"At first we thought they meant the student leaders and those supporting them," 
a Western intelligence source said. "But it looks like they mean the people 
with Zhao and against martial law." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Zhao and Qin, others believed targeted included Zhao's former 
secretary, Bao Tong, head of a Zhao-sponsored reformist think tank, and Hong 
Xuezhi, a senior member of the National People's Congress, the Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Also included were Yan Mingfu and Wen Jiabao, both senior Central Committee 
members, and Du Runsheng, director of the party's rural policy research center, 
the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Zhao and Yan had tried to conciliate with the students, while the others were 
criticized for supporting or being too tolerant of the protests or of 
permitting news coverage of the demonstrations, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the student movement, meanwhile, held a crucial all-night meeting in 
Tian An Men Square, with 278 students voting to continue the sit-in that began 
in earnest May 13, said Ji Cheng, a student at Beijing University.

Suzie Azar became the first woman mayor in El Paso history with a landslide 
victory over fellow City Council member Ed Elsey in a runoff election. "One 
hundred seventeen years is a long time for El Paso to wait, and I'm glad they 
waited for me," Azar said. The final but unofficial totals showed she had 
captured 65% of the votes, or 29,961, to 35%, or 16,218, for Elsey. The 
successor to Mayor Jonathan Rogers, who by law had to step down after four 
consecutive two-year terms, will face problems posed by widespread poverty and 
rapid growth. El Paso's elections are nonpartisan.

Israeli warplanes stepped up reconnaissance of Syrian army positions in Lebanon 
amid tension over reports that Syria is preparing its troops for an assault on 
Christian forces. Syrian troops did not open fire on the Israeli planes, which 
flew for two hours over Syrian positions in the hills above Beirut as well over 
Muslim West Beirut and southern Lebanon, military sources said. Muslim militia 
sources said that Syria beefed up its estimated 40,000 troops in Lebanon to put 
pressure on Christian army commander Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, whose forces oppose 
the pro-Syrian Muslim government of Premier Salim Hoss.

VICTIMS SOUGHT IN OHIO BRIDGE COLLAPSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Helicopters hovered over a tributary of the Ohio River searching for an 
undetermined number of people whose vehicles plunged into the rain-swollen 
waterway when a temporary bridge collapsed shortly before it was to be closed 
to traffic. Powerful currents prevented authorities from finding any victims or 
their vehicles. The American Red Cross said at least seven people remained 
unaccounted for. Officials are uncertain how many vehicles fell when a 100-foot 
section of the bridge near Cincinnati gave way. Eyewitness accounts differed 
but authorities believed at least two vehicles disappeared into the Great Miami 
River's rushing, muddy water. County engineers said the bridge had been ordered 
closed because of debris that was pinned against it, but the collapse occurred 
before workers could arrive.

GUYANA HAS GOLD, DIAMONDS AND POVERTY; 
</P>
<P>
DESPITE RICH NATURAL RESOURCES, COUNTRY'S ECONOMY IS IN SHAMBLES

GEORGETOWN, Guyana 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although it has bountiful resources, including gold and diamonds, Guyana is in 
the throes of one of the worst economic declines in the developing world. 
</P>
<P>
Its 750,000 people face chronic shortages of electricity, water, 
transportation, fuel and food. Jobs are scarce, and prices are soaring. A 
gallon of milk costs the equivalent of $3, three times the average daily wage. 
</P>
<P>
Its only thriving economic sector is the black market. 
</P>
<P>
Frustration is giving way to violence and strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing riots similar to those that killed 176 people in neighboring Venezuela 
in late February and early March, Guyana's military is on alert. The unrest 
here is simmering at its worst since race riots left hundreds dead in the 
mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
The World Bank estimates Guyana, a former British colony on South America's 
northeast shoulder and the continent's only English-speaking nation, has had 
the worst economic decline in the Third World over the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
"We have sunk almost to the bottom of the table, perhaps just above Haiti and 
Bolivia," the Stabroek News, an independent daily, commented recently. 
</P>
<P>
Guyana has had virtually no economic growth in 10 years and in the mid-1980s 
suspended payments on its foreign debt, now $1.9 billion. Western creditors 
have stopped most aid to the country. 
</P>
<P>
But not only does Guyana, which is about the size of Idaho, have a big foreign 
debt for its size, it has no foreign exchange reserves. It has borrowed $1 
billion just to keep foreign currencies on hand for emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, when the government needed more local currency -- the Guyanese 
dollar -- it simply printed it. 
</P>
<P>
Without hard currencies such as the U.S. dollar, Guyana cannot afford to import 
parts or buy technology, and this has left its infrastructure -- roads, 
bridges, sewers, electric and water treatment plants -- to deteriorate. An 
exodus of skilled workers and poor production of its three major exports -- 
sugar, bauxite and rice -- also contribute to the slump. 
</P>
<P>
But the crisis also points to the government's establishment in 1980 of a 
cooperative republic "in transition from capitalism to socialism." 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, President Desmond Hoyte has backed away from much of the 
socialism of his predecessor, Forbes Burnham, who led Guyana to independence 
from Britain in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham died in 1985 after years of authoritarian rule. During his presidency, 
he nationalized 80% of the economy and discouraged foreign and private 
investment in a bid to make Guyana a self-sufficient, nonaligned socialist 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
Critics also blame the crisis on mismanagement, resistance to democratic reform 
and alleged corruption by Burnham's People's National Congress, which has 
dominated politics since he became president in 1966. The elections in 
December, 1985, which brought Hoyte to office, were widely regarded as 
fraudulent. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a big question over elections which has never been addressed, and 
it's a cancer in the life of the country," Anglican Bishop Randolph George 
said. "The style has changed with Burnham's death, but it's the same old gang. 
It's a mini-dictatorship." 
</P>
<P>
Although the government maintains Burnham's socialist policies were not 
responsible for Guyana's decline, a pending agreement with the International 
Monetary Fund signals a change of course. 
</P>
<P>
"Private enterprise doesn't conflict with socialism," Prime Minister Hamilton 
Green said. "We need large inputs of money, and we hope the IMF program will 
provide incentives needed to grow. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's going to be rough, very rough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Western creditors want an International Monetary Fund agreement before giving 
Guyana new aid. So on March 31, Hoyte imposed a three-year International 
Monetary Fund program that devalued Guyana's currency by 70%, doubled interest 
rates to 35% and triggered 300% price hikes. 
</P>
<P>
To soften the blow, the government gave state workers a 20% pay increase. But 
that is small change for salaries that dropped in value to $1 a day from $2.50 
as a result of the devaluation. Food prices skyrocketed. Workers have to work 
two days to buy a pound of chicken or a pint of cooking oil. 
</P>
<P>
"A 20% increase is not enough. We need 1,000%," said Lincoln Lewis, president 
of the Guyana Mine Workers Union, representing 4,000 of the 5,000 workers in 
the bauxite industry. 
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 workers from the state-owned sugar industry and all workers in the 
bauxite sector responded to the International Monetary Fund program by walking 
off their jobs. A sympathy teachers' strike shut down the University of Guyana. 
In the monthlong walkouts, about 140 people were arrested, most in 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guyanese Urged to 'Agitate' 
</P>
<P>
"We are going down, like the rest of Latin America, with policies imposed by 
North America," said Cheddi Jagan, a former prime minister and minority leader 
in the Parliament who has called on Guyanese to "agitate" against government 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
Guyana has two main ethnic groups -- blacks of African descent and East 
Indians. Political parties are based largely on racial lines. 
</P>
<P>
Jagan represents the Indians, who make up about 50% of the population. Hoyte 
draws his support mainly from urban blacks, about 30% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
But the current unrest is economically based. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters have hurled Molotov cocktails at government buildings, and arsonists 
have destroyed about $800,000 worth of sugar cane. Dunstan Barrow, chief 
executive for the bauxite sector, said the strike has cost the industry $1.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Combined earnings from the bauxite and sugar industry are about $200 million a 
year but a drought in 1988 hurt sugar output. Last year, Guyana had to import 
sugar because it produced barely enough to meet its obligation to the European 
Economic Community. Production was 170,000 tons, slightly less than half of its 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of neglect abounds. 
</P>
<P>
Because of poor drainage, heavy rains often flood the littered and potholed 
streets of Georgetown, a once-gleaming capital settled by the Dutch in the 16th 
Century that boasted broad avenues, wooden colonial buildings and houses at the 
mouth of the Demerara River. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scheduled Blackouts 
</P>
<P>
Daily routines such as cooking, cleaning or taking baths are timed around 
scheduled blackouts that average seven hours a day but often last 20 hours. The 
outages, which sometimes are unscheduled, knock out water and fuel pumps, 
creating shortages. 
</P>
<P>
Forests take up about 80% of Guyana's 85,000 square miles. Most of the 
population lives along the 235-mile Atlantic coastline, the region most in need 
of energy. One of Georgetown's three aging generators has shut down. The other 
two limp along with repairs. Of the 45 megawatts needed at peak times, only 13 
megawatts are going out. 
</P>
<P>
Homemakers line up for hours outside thinly stocked grocery stores. Others turn 
to "suitcase traders" -- people who sell goods picked up in neighboring 
Suriname, Venezuela or Brazil, usually with contraband gold sold for U.S. 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Guyana produced 22,400 ounces of gold, but an estimated 100,000 ounces 
are believed smuggled out each year, about $40-million worth. 
</P>
<P>
By law, gold must be sold to the Guyana Gold Board, which pays at lower prices 
in the devalued Guyana currency rather than U.S. dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Other important exports are diamonds, shrimp and timber, which the United 
States imports. But production declines brought on by shortages of parts and 
fuel have hurt those areas too. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Black Market 
</P>
<P>
Economic activity thrives in Georgetown's "Wall Street," as the black market is 
called. Young men with gold chains around their necks and wads of Guyanese 
currency in their hands trade in coveted U.S. dollars. 
</P>
<P>
With devaluation, the official exchange is 33 Guyanese dollars to one U.S. 
dollar. On the black market, it is more like 50 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been doing it for seven years," one young dealer said. "I don't know what 
I would do if it stopped." 
</P>
<P>
Guyana's poor quality of life is causing skilled workers -- teachers, doctors, 
nurses, managers -- to flee. Despite an increase in the birth rate, the 
population has dropped in the last decade by about 100,000. U.S. officials 
estimate that 5% of the population awaits immigration visas. 
</P>
<P>
Lines outside the U.S. Embassy form at dawn. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Mellville, spokesman for the Independent Federation of Trade Unions, 
representing 50,000 of the 80,000 unionized workers, said workers have lost 
faith in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The future isn't promising, and people aren't motivated to work. So the main 
alternative is to leave the country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GUYANA AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
GEORGETOWN, Guyana 
</P>
<P>
 -- Here are some facts and figures on Guyana. 
</P>
<P>
History: The Guianas, a region that today includes Suriname, French Guiana, 
Guyana and parts of Brazil and Venezuela, was sighted by Columbus in 1498. But 
Guyana was not settled until late in the 16th Century, when the Dutch arrived. 
The British became the rulers in 1796 and established British Guiana in 1831. 
Independence was granted in 1966. Guyana, which means "Land of Many Rivers," 
became a republic in 1970 and was declared a cooperative republic "in 
transition from capitalism to socialism" by the 1980 constitution. Forbes 
Burnham became president in 1966 and ruled until his death in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The People: Most of the population of 780,000 is made up of English- and 
Creolese-speaking people. The literacy rate is about 90%. Most of the people 
are descendants of African slaves or indentured servants, mostly from India and 
a few from Portugal. Slavery was abolished in 1833. 
</P>
<P>
The Land: Guyana is a tropical country on the northeastern coast of South 
America between Suriname and Venezuela. Its 83,000-square-mile area is about 
the size of Idaho. About 80% of the land is rain forest and savanna, laced by 
rivers and rich in rice lands, wildlife, gold, diamonds, semi-precious stones 
and timber. The most populated region is along the 235-mile Atlantic coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Politics: Politics are based more on ethnic lines than on ideology, with the 
governing People's National Congress supported by urban blacks and the People's 
Progressive Party of Cheddi Jagan by Indo-Guyanese, who are about 49% of the 
population. The National Congress, first under the late President Forbes 
Burnham, and now under President Desmond Hoyte, has governed since 1964. 
Opposition parties, Western governments and human rights organizations charge 
the National Congress maintains power by election fraud. National elections 
were held in 1985. The next elections must be held no later than this December, 
although Hoyte could call them earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The Government: Guyana has a modified parliamentary system, with legislative 
power in a unicameral National Assembly. The president, who is the leader of 
the majority party, is the chief executive and appoints a prime minister and a 
Cabinet. The prime minister is the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
The Economy: The government has launched a major drive for foreign investment 
to spur the economy, which is nearly stagnant and dominated by a black market 
created by the country's depleted foreign exchange account. Economists estimate 
black market transactions account for 80% of the country's economic life. The 
country has a foreign debt of $1.9 billion. Official estimates of unemployment 
and inflation are not available.

The Federal Aviation Administration denied a petition from a group of older 
pilots to be allowed to fly airliners after age 60, saying older pilots are 
more likely to be involved in accidents. However, the agency announced that it 
would fund a study of pilot age and accident rates and indicated that it might 
be willing to certify individual pilots over 60 if a way can be found to 
determine their capacities. The issue has simmered since the 1950s when the FAA 
first ordered airline pilots and co-pilots to retire at 60. It attracted 
renewed interest after Feb. 24 when 59-year-old United Airlines pilot David 
Cronin guided a Boeing 747 to a safe landing in Honolulu after part of its 
fuselage blew off, killing nine people. Cronin was hailed as a hero for his 
second-to-last commercial flight before retirement. The latest denial came on a 
petition filed in May, 1986. The FAA rejected it 16 months later. The U.S. 
Court of Appeals in Chicago required the FAA to take another look at the 
petition.

The Jewish community in the West German city of Frankfurt said it is taking 
court action against a city council member from an ultra-rightist party over 
alleged anti-Semitic remarks. Erich Gutjahr, a 78-year-old member of the 
rightist National Party of Germany, was quoted by the Frankfurt Allgemeine 
newspaper as saying: "Jews have bought up half the city. The Jews are 
plundering us again. Something must be done about this." The city prosecutor's 
office said it is investigating Gutjahr for possible violation of German laws 
over the statements, and several members of the city council have demanded that 
he resign. Gutjahr said he is not anti-Semitic and only wants to protect 
"German interests," the paper reported.

Czechoslovakia ordered three British diplomats and a businessman out of the 
country in response to Britain's expulsion of four members of the Czechoslovak 
Embassy in London one day earlier. The Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry on Friday 
summoned Britain's ambassador in Prague and accused the four of unacceptable 
behavior. Mirroring the British action, Czechoslovakia gave the four 14 days to 
leave, the embassy added. Named in the expulsion order were embassy first 
secretaries Rick Todd and Anthony Arnold and press secretary Patricia Holland. 
Also ordered out was Nicholas Brooks, a representative of Britain's Shell Oil.

Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York arrived in Beirut on a three-day mission 
to draw attention to foreign hostages held in Lebanon and to the bitter 
fighting there. The 69-year-old archbishop is scheduled to meet with warring 
Christian and Muslim leaders on both sides of the divided capital. O'Connor is 
in Lebanon in his capacity as president of the Catholic Near East Assn., which 
provides millions of dollars in humanitarian aid to the embattled country. He 
said he would gladly meet with any of the nine Americans and seven other 
Western hostages, and added, "I hope that they can hear my voice or can see me 
or can read that the people of our country have not forgotten them."

TECHNOLOGY OF U.S. SPY PLANE USED TO WAGE MALARIA WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN LOKKEN, Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The same high-flying technology that has enabled governments to spy on each 
other's military forces is now being directed against one of mankind's most 
deadly and intransigent enemies -- malaria. 
</P>
<P>
Using American and French satellites and a civilian version of the U-2 spy 
plane, scientists are developing a method of predicting where and when 
malaria-carrying mosquitoes will strike. 
</P>
<P>
The war against the Anopheles mosquito is a critical one: More than half of the 
world's population lives in areas where the insects are found. World health 
experts expect more than 100 million new cases of the disease and about 1.5 
million deaths this year alone. 
</P>
<P>
American scientists are spearheading the high-tech war against the mosquito, 
and numerous foreign governments and international agencies, including the U.N. 
Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, are watching its progress. 
</P>
<P>
For the last four years, scientists have studied in minute detail aerial photos 
taken of about 100 rice fields in California's Sacramento Valley and correlated 
the fields' characteristics with the appearance of mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
They now say they can predict -- two months in advance and with greater than 
83% accuracy -- the exact locations where Anopheles mosquitoes will breed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Breed in Limited Areas 
</P>
<P>
The precision is required because researchers long ago discovered that the 
insects, which carry the parasite that causes malaria, breed in limited areas. 
</P>
<P>
Of 104 California rice fields studied, only 16 accounted for half of the 
mosquito population. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with that knowledge, the scientists think they can develop for every 
region of the globe infected with malaria -- mainly those countries near the 
Equator -- the means to predict and plan for mosquito infestations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking in the first week of May about what's going to happen in the 
latter part of July and August," Robert Waschino, one of the project's 
scientists, said in a recent telephone interview. "Now, that's real magic." 
</P>
<P>
Waschino, an entomologist at the University of California at Davis and one of 
the world's leading experts on the Anopheles mosquito, and his colleagues plan 
to start correlating the satellite and aircraft data with insecticide spraying 
in California this year. 
</P>
<P>
They are using data gathered by aerospace scientists at Ames Research Center, a 
NASA facility at Mountain View, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
A second phase of the fight against malaria already has been started in Mexico. 
A third phase, due to start sometime in the 1990s, will be able to cover every 
country identified by the World Health Organization as being at high risk for 
malaria. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Expand Study Area 
</P>
<P>
Paul Sebasta, a NASA ecologist and the project's manager, said scientists are 
now studying a 36-square-mile plot of land near Tapachula, in Mexico's Chiapas 
state. Once the hydrology and vegetation of the targeted land is known, the 
size of the study area will be enlarged. 
</P>
<P>
By learning myriad details about land and vegetation features, the scientists 
said they can predict where the heaviest of the mosquito populations will 
emerge. "We are confident we can do this," said Sebasta, "and we want to take 
the lessons we've learned here in California and apply them to Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
The conventional method requires that inspectors test rice fields and other 
potential breeding grounds first-hand, using small dippers to scoop up water 
that is then examined for mosquito larvae. It is a crude, slow and costly 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the current means of hunting for the breeding grounds provides 
little predictability, said Waschino. 
</P>
<P>
"In a field with a low density of Anopheles, to get the kind of precision you 
need you may have to dip a thousand times. And that's just one field," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists hope that in the mid-1990s they will be able to detect mosquito 
breeding grounds from a satellite permanently orbiting the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"Our ultimate goal is to be able to say, for instance, that based on satellite 
data, breeding conditions will be perfect in four weeks for certain species of 
malaria-bearing mosquitoes," said Sebasta. "We won't really be able say the 
disease is there, but we can say the potential is there."

RED CROSS DEVELOPING AIDS GAME TO SHOW FATAL RISK OF UNSAFE SEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARHEA, Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Red Cross, which brought Americans swimming lessons and resuscitation for 
heart-attack victims, is developing a game to help fight AIDS by teaching 
children about the consequences of unsafe sex. 
</P>
<P>
"The Red Cross sees this game as a natural extension of its response to a 
critical health emergency," said Sandra Grymes, manager of health services for 
the American Red Cross in Greater New York. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a game that is directed toward teen-agers and young adults to help them 
process information about AIDS and understand that they have some control over 
their behaviors in relationship to the disease," Grymes said. "It seeks to 
educate people about the risks of their behavior." 
</P>
<P>
The game, called At Risk, was conceived by Irene Katcher, an administrator at 
Junior High School 80 in the Bronx borough of New York -- where, she said, the 
students don't say no to anything. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to give a kid a reason to say no," said Katcher, 40, a former 
science teacher who is discipline dean for the seventh grade. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot easier to form attitudes than to change them, and people don't want 
to say no to things that are fun," she said. "Research in this area has shown 
that saying no to sex doesn't work, once people discover it." 
</P>
<P>
In the game -- to be conducted by a trained health professional in a classroom 
environment -- players use dice, cards and a "Sexual Wheel of Misfortune" to 
develop "life styles" and sexual histories that can lead to simulated death 
from the incurable disease. 
</P>
<P>
As of late last year about 325 of every 100,000 people in the area served by 
the school had acquired immune deficiency syndrome, Katcher said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Public Health Service has estimated that as many as 1.5 million people 
in the country were infected and at least 45,000 Americans had died of AIDS by 
the end of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the U.S. victims have been male homosexuals and people who 
share needles when they inject drugs, the percentage of those who transmit the 
virus through heterosexual sex is small but increasing, according to a report 
in Scientific American magazine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Infected Drug Addicts 
</P>
<P>
More than 60% of the drug addicts in New York City have the AIDS virux, and 
it's probably much higher than that, Katcher said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can carry AIDS for up to 14 years, possibly longer, without showing any 
symptoms at all," Katcher said. "If you have the AIDs virus in your body, 
you're a walking time bomb. You're going to die. You don't know when, but it's 
going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
The development, testing and distribution of the game is being done under a 
$20,000 grant from the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta through 
the Red Cross under Katcher's supervision. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a simulation that's built for a group of 20 or more. I don't believe the 
game would be effective with less," Katcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Why a game? 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in the teaching business a long time. Telling people is one thing. 
Nobody likes to be told anything, and sitting in a lecture listening to 
statistics is boring. You're not involved. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of it being boring, instead of it being preachy, we get to run you 
through a real-life situation." 
</P>
<P>
The major goal of the game, Katcher said, is to demonstrate to young people 
that each time they have sex, in effect, they are having sex with all the 
previous partners of their current partner. 
</P>
<P>
The game starts with all players breaking up into couples. Each couple rolls a 
special cube, which has three sides marked "sex," two labeled "abstain" and one 
indicating a monogamous relationship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sexual Histories 
</P>
<P>
After recording their partner's name and the outcome of the dice roll on a 
score sheet, the couples split up and everyone takes a new partner and they 
roll again. This happens at least four times, with the score sheets becoming 
sexual histories of each player. 
</P>
<P>
Then each player is dealt a card, with one getting a card marked AIDS and the 
rest getting "I'm OK for Now" cards. 
</P>
<P>
The AIDS recipient goes to the front of the room and is joined by all his or 
her past sex partners. They are then joined by all their past sex partners, 
creating a pool of potential AIDS victims. 
</P>
<P>
Those players then draw cards indicating either "safe sex" -- the use of 
condoms or spermicides -- or "It can't happen to me" -- an attitude that 
results in AIDS transmission. 
</P>
<P>
Only those players who practice "safe" sex can avoid AIDS, but they still have 
to overcome the 1-in-10 odds that even those practices are not totally safe. 
Those odds are reflected in the "Sexual Wheel of Misfortune," which is 90% red 
and 10% green. Those players who spin "green" are the only winners. The rest 
get AIDS and wind up in the front of the room. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where you go to die," Katcher says.

SEQUOIA NATIONAL FOREST, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As logging goes, this is a pretty dainty affair. 
</P>
<P>
The burly guys with the suspenders, spiked boots and chain saws are still on 
hand. But in Sequoia National Forest, they are using a massive helicopter -- 
capable of lifting 10,000 pounds if the weather is right -- as a key part in 
the logging of 556 acres. It is used to fly logs cut on the steep slopes across 
from Camp Wishon to loading zones. 
</P>
<P>
Using the helicopter means they do not have to cut a new road into the area or 
drag the logs with a bulldozer, the most common method. 
</P>
<P>
And if you look at the helicopter-logged area from a nearby hillside, it is 
tough to see any evidence of logging. 
</P>
<P>
"All we're doing is picking and plucking," said Del Pengilly, district ranger 
in the forest's Tule River Ranger District. Cutting a road into the steep slope 
would have meant using a bulldozer to make some deep switchbacks into a 
hillside across from a popular campground, thereby increasing the chance of 
erosion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Proper Logging Method' 
</P>
<P>
"This is the proper logging method for this hillside," said Paul Miller, Forest 
Service sale administrator. 
</P>
<P>
But using a helicopter costs about five times as much as using a bulldozer. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way that operation washes (makes a profit) is due to the fact of the 
quality of the pine," said Larry Duysen, logging superintendent for Sierra 
Forest Products in Terra Bella, which bought the timber. 
</P>
<P>
It is old-growth pine with few knots that can be made into top-quality 
products. It is the type of wood used for window frames, door jambs and 
molding, he said. 
</P>
<P>
And the steep slopes are most likely to be home of that old growth. "The more 
easily accessible areas have been harvested over the years," Duysen said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Younger Trees Left 
</P>
<P>
Said Miller: "We're taking some 300-year-old trees, but we're leaving some 150- 
to 200-year-old ones." 
</P>
<P>
Carla Cloer of the Kern-Kaweah chapter of the Sierra Club said she would like 
to see more use of helicopters in logging but is concerned about logging 
debris, replanting and seeing the old-growth trees cut. 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible to do a lot of damage with helicopter logging," she said. "It 
depends on how you do it. It's not a panacea. We're going to be really watching 
this (timber) sale to see how they carry it out." 
</P>
<P>
Once the trees are cut, they are cleaned up, their weight is calculated, and 
cables are attached to the logs so they can be lifted out. 
</P>
<P>
The ground crews use mirrors and radios to guide the helicopter trailing a 
200-foot cable with an electrically controlled hook to the right location. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing is being conscious of the rate of descent," said Sean Gavin, 
command pilot for Columbia Helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
If the helicopter moves down too fast, it may not be able to stop. The 
helicopter sometimes dumps loads. Speed is also critical. To be economical, the 
helicopter needs to keep up a good pace in bring the logs out. 
</P>
<P>
The logs are flown to a small clearing beside a road, lowered to the ground and 
dropped. A front-end loader moves the logs out of the drop zone and stacks them 
for trucks to pick up.

The number of dentists using gloves when treating patients has jumped by more 
than 53% in recent years, according to a national survey by the American Dental 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The report, published in the May issue of the American Journal of the American 
Dental Assn., said 5,800 dentists were randomly surveyed between January and 
May of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Of those responding, 76.4% said they now wear gloves. In a similar 1986 survey, 
Only 22.7% said they wore gloves. 
</P>
<P>
ADA guidelines to prevent transmission of infectious diseases in the dental 
profession include the use of gloves, masks and eye wear with every patient.

Here are some facts and figures about Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
 History: Britain's Capt. James Cook is believed to have first entered 
Antarctic waters during an expedition from 1773 to 1775, and was followed by 
several other mariners who discovered land there in the early 1800s. The 
American Capt. Charles Wilkes first identified it as a continent in 1840, when 
he traced 1,500 miles of coastline. The first inland expeditions were carried 
out by Norway's Leonard Kristensen and Britain's Robert F. Scott and Ernest 
Shackleton in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Roald Amundsen of Norway reached 
the South Pole in December, 1911, and Scott arrived a month later, but his 
four-man party perished. 
</P>
<P>
Geography: Antarctica has an area of 5.1 million square miles, larger than 
Europe's, and has been determined to have 17,500 miles of rugged coastline. Its 
uneven surface of rock and gravel descends toward the center like a soup bowl, 
under the vast weight of a rounded cap of ice more than a mile deep in some 
places. The total volume of ice on the continent is equivalent to 72% of all 
the water on earth. The continent is divided by the Transantarctic Mountains 
and includes other clusters of peaks, including Visson Massif, the highest at 
16,864 feet above sea level. 
</P>
<P>
Climate: Antarctica's inland temperatures remain almost constantly below 
freezing, making it the coldest continent. On the Antarctic Peninsula, 
temperatures can rise above freezing during the austral summer. The lowest 
reading ever, at the Soviet Union's Vostok Station on July 21, 1983, was minus 
89.2 degrees Celsius. There is little precipitation in Antarctica, an average 
of 4 inches a year. 
</P>
<P>
Politics: The continent is administered by the Antarctic Treaty, signed by 12 
nations in 1961. The signers agreed to suspend territorial claims and dedicate 
the region to peaceful research. Eight other nations have since become voting 
members, and 18 more have observer status. The treaty is up for review in 1991. 
Seven nations make direct territorial claims to parts of the continent, with 
some claims overlapping. Other countries, including the United States and the 
Soviet Union, refuse to recognize any claims.

SALESMEN WARNED OF LONG-TERM DAMAGE FROM SLEAZY SALES TECHNIQUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert B. Cialdini wrote his book about sleazy sales techniques to warn 
consumers to be on guard. Now he is frequently invited to speak before the 
people in charge of the selling. 
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old professor of psychology at Arizona State University in Tempe 
spent three years researching his book, "Influence: The New Psychology of 
Modern Persuasion." He worked as a used-car salesman, peddled products 
door-to-door, sold advertising and made "cold calls" on the telephone to learn 
all the sales pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Now he is on a lecture tour, taking his message to marketing and sales 
executives, negotiators, attorneys, fund-raisers and the like. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who invited me to come for lectures already understood the process 
in an inarticulated way," he said. "That is, they knew what worked, but they 
wanted to know why it worked. They wanted the psychological underpinnings." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A 'Typical Patsy' 
</P>
<P>
Thus Cialdini began speaking more about the ethics of persuasion than the 
process itself. He says he has a natural interest in the subject because he is 
a "typical patsy" for a sales pitch. 
</P>
<P>
And, he says, he is not alone. We are socialized in such a way, he says, that 
if someone gives us something, such as a Hare Krishna flower at an airport, we 
feel we must reciprocate in some way. We are taught not to interrupt, so we 
listen to a long pitch on the telephone because we are too polite to just hang 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Cialdini's research showed how salesmen take advantage of these common 
civilities. 
</P>
<P>
He found a fire safety sales pitch to be one of the seamiest: A salesman would 
come in to make a free inspection of the home and the lucky householder would 
receive a free fire extinguisher. 
</P>
<P>
"First, the salesman would show pictures of burned children," he said. "It was 
just awful." 
</P>
<P>
After the inspection, he would ask the resident to fill out a questionnaire 
while he went out to the car to get something. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Building Up Trust 
</P>
<P>
"He would always say, 'Stay seated. I'll let myself out and come back in.' 
That's very important. Think of it. Who do you let in and out of your house? 
Someone you trust. So the salesman has established himself as a trusted person 
by this simple technique." 
</P>
<P>
Then came the pitch. It went something like, "Charles, do you think your wife 
and little girl here are worth $2,000?" What other way can you answer that? 
</P>
<P>
If the potential customer resisted, the salesman would ask permission to call 
his office to report that he had failed at another sale, a failure that, he 
explains, might cost him his job. On the phone the front office, all part of 
the central plot, would explain that he could offer the products for $500 less, 
since his job was on the line. 
</P>
<P>
Cialdini also took breathing lessons so he could make a pitch on the telephone 
without taking a breath and giving the other party a chance to say, "I'm not 
interested." 
</P>
<P>
He said consumer groups have shown little interest in his book, but the 
interest it engendered in corporate America has changed his life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Dream 'Boondoggle' 
</P>
<P>
"IBM flew me to Monte Carlo for a month -- twice -- for big educational 
conferences," he said. "That's the kind of boondoggle I always read about 
somebody else getting, but I got it, and they paid me money besides." 
</P>
<P>
He gets $3,500 for each lecture, or $5,000 for half a day, but he has had to 
cut his speaking down to twice a month. He is back teaching psychology after a 
sabbatical. 
</P>
<P>
Cialdini said he is pleased that the book did not turn him into a "pop 
psychologist" and that he did not lose academic standing because of it. 
</P>
<P>
The book, published in 1984 and re-issued as an academic text in 1988, outlines 
the six "triggers" to which people respond in decision-making: authority, 
reciprocity, scarcity, commitment, consensus and liking. 
</P>
<P>
In discussing the authority technique, Cialdini offers an ethical and unethical 
use. 
</P>
<P>
If nine out of 10 doctors really did prefer a certain brand, that's one thing, 
he says, but it's something else to have an actor whom the public identifies 
with a physician role endorsing a decaffeinated coffee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Detectives and Smugglers 
</P>
<P>
Cialdini describes the difference as the "detective" approach and the 
"smuggler" approach. The detective approach is to find naturally hidden 
triggers in the product. The smuggler approach is to create them, as with the 
actor in a white doctor's coat endorsing a product. 
</P>
<P>
Let's say you have spent about half an hour with a used-car salesman. Do you 
feel as though you like him? If the answer is yes, watch out. You are being 
manipulated. The question is whether the price on the car is a good deal. 
</P>
<P>
That technique explains the success of products such as Tupperware, Avon, and 
Mary Kay, he says. The seller of such a line is likely to be a friend, or at 
least an acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
Let's say you are looking at a house to buy and your real estate agent becomes 
aware that another family is also interested. He tells you that someone else 
might get it. That is perfectly legitimate. He's acting in your best interest. 
In an unethical scenario, however, there is no other buyer out there. The agent 
creates one to get you to put down a firm bid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deceptions and Ethics 
</P>
<P>
How do you know when it's real? 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, often, you don't. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why all salesmen tend to get tarred with the same brush and end up 
ranking down there below undertakers," Cialdini said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I talk to business groups, the point I make is that they are going to do 
better in the long term by being ethical," he said. "Then they sit up and take 
notice." 
</P>
<P>
He uses as an example a trusted mechanic who told him the repairs necessary on 
his car would be $45. The previous mechanic had estimated $500. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very ethical and he now has me as a customer for life," Cialdini says. 
</P>
<P>
The research he put in on his book gave him one more advantage, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I can say no a lot better now."

SOME SAY COURT'S CASELOAD IN DEPT. 35 IS TOO MUCH

<P>
It's 9:15 a.m. and Superior Court Judge Kevin Midlam is ready to tackle the 
10th case of the day. It's a messy affair, involving an insurance company, with 
lots of motions and filings in several courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers begin to expound on the intricacies of the case, but Midlam has 
heard enough. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tempest in a teapot," Midlam sighs. "Work it out and save yourselves 
time and your clients money." Motion denied. 
</P>
<P>
9:18 a.m: An embarrassed young lawyer who missed a court date asks Midlam to 
reinstate his client's case. He soothes the lawyer's ego and grants the motion 
but warns that the lawyer may have to pay court costs. Next case. 
</P>
<P>
9:21 a.m.: The owners of a franchise business want their contract dispute heard 
in California even though the contract says any legal disputes must he heard in 
New York courts. "They're big boys, they entered into the contract," Midlam 
says. Motion denied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gatekeepers of a Daunting Caseload 
</P>
<P>
The pace will continue for most of the morning, as Midlam dispenses rapid-fire 
justice in Department 35, one of the most important civil courtrooms in San 
Diego. Before he stepped down from the bench Thursday morning, Midlam had 
ruled, in minor or major ways, on 23 civil lawsuits. After lunch, Judge William 
C. Pate takes his turn in Department 35, wrestling with an equally daunting 
caseload. 
</P>
<P>
The two judges are the gatekeepers of civil litigation in San Diego County, 
hearing motions and pleadings on nearly all civil lawsuits up to the point when 
the cases are ready for trial. They are generally well-regarded, but serious 
questions have emerged in recent months about whether any two judges can handle 
the volume of cases and issues that now pass through Department 35. 
</P>
<P>
Most judges have come to detest their tours of duty in Department 35, and 
lawyers complain that the judges simply do not have enough time to understand 
their cases and give them the tender loving care they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Presiding Judge Michael I. Greer has ordered the formation of a 
committee to study whether San Diego County should drastically overhaul its 
civil litigation system, eliminating Department 35 -- the "law and motion" 
courtroom -- and assigning each civil case to one judge who will handle it from 
beginning to end. Such a system is called "direct calendaring" or 
"one-judge-for-all-purposes." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mill," Greer said of Department 35. "Most of the studies nationwide in 
civil law have told us that you become much more efficient on a direct 
calendar. . . . We are thinking in terms of starting experimental direct 
calendaring." 
</P>
<P>
A judge who handles a case from beginning to end becomes familiar with the file 
and is "responsible for his own or her own work product," Greer said. "You can 
manage the case much more efficiently right down to its conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Reduce Squabbling 
</P>
<P>
Such a system would cut down on squabbling between attorneys, he added. "If I 
were the judge-for-all-purposes, and they (lawyers) called up and said, 'He 
won't tell me this,' and, 'She won't do that,' I would put them on the phone 
and say, 'Let's knock off the crap and let's start acting like ladies and 
gentlemen and let's decide this thing quickly.' 
</P>
<P>
"There's more management. There's things that just get done, and there's less 
paper, less billing to the client." 
</P>
<P>
Greer said the courts are authorized by law to switch to a direct-calendaring 
system, and San Diego County already has done so for a few complex cases as 
part of a statewide program to speed the handling of civil cases. Los Angeles 
has begun a large-scale experimental program of direct calendaring, and so far 
it is working well, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, meetings with attorneys and judges about the possible change will 
begin in June, and a number of courtrooms may be designated for direct 
calendaring by next year. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the country, Greer said, most jurisdictions have already switched to 
the direct-calendar system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Made It Through 
</P>
<P>
Adding fuel to the push for a new system was the trial last month of a lawsuit 
brought by Laurence Price, the 43-year-old son of multimillionaire businessman 
Sol Price. Laurence Price sued his father for $100 million in damages for 
emotional distress he claimed his father caused by being mean to him and trying 
to interfere with his life. 
</P>
<P>
The case made it through Department 35 and went to trial, but Superior Court 
Judge Arthur W. Jones threw it out after Laurence Price's lawyer, Marvin 
Mitchelson, rested his case. Jones said Mitchelson had presented no evidence 
for the jury to consider. 
</P>
<P>
Some lawyers said privately that if one judge had been monitoring the case from 
the beginning, it would have been thrown out before trial. 
</P>
<P>
Others, including Greer, said the case was a close call, but that Mitchelson 
had made enough of a showing in Department 35 that the case had to go to trial. 
If the case had been thrown out at that level, he said, Mitchelson probably 
would have appealed, and the case would have been returned to Department 35 and 
sent to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Midlam, who sent the Price case to trial, said last week that he had no choice 
under the law. He said he advocates a change to direct calendaring but added 
that he is satisfied that he and his staff of 10, which includes lawyers, 
clerks and administrators, give each case the consideration it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like Being in Jail' 
</P>
<P>
Midlam is near the end of his eight-month stint in Department 35 and said that, 
generally, judges are rotated out after six months, "before they begin talking 
to themselves." He said he advocates direct calendaring but did not object when 
Greer sent him to Department 35, unlike other judges who "think it's like being 
in jail. They spend all their time trying to figure out how to get out of 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen P. Swinton, an attorney with Brobeck, Phlger &amp; Harrison, said a 
switch to one-judge-for-all-purposes may make for more knowledgeable judges and 
more honest attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Judges "are dealing with an overwhelming burden right now," Swinton said. "But 
I think when you only have five minutes to review a file and if the file is 
huge, it is impossible for you to assess the entire history of the pleading." 
That history might include instances of misconduct by lawyers that would be 
difficult for the judge to recall or detect if he hadn't seen the case before. 
</P>
<P>
"And there is a perception that it is easier sometimes for a judge to dodge a 
difficult position on the assumption that somebody else will handle it down the 
road," Swinton continued. "I'm certainly vocal in my desire to see the court 
assign more cases to a single judge assignment system." 
</P>
<P>
Gerald McMahon, the lawyer who defended Sol Price in the suit brought by 
Mitchelson, also advocates a direct-calendaring system. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times when you play by the rules and you do things right, and the 
other side, for whatever reason, doesn't, they can get away with a lot more if 
there's not one judge who is familiar with the case and knows the games that 
have been played," McMahon said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current system, he said, "you can play those games a lot longer and a 
lot more freely." 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like disciplining kids. If you are involved step by step, you get a 
pretty good idea who's on the right side and who's on the wrong side."

MARINES START TO GET IN STEP WITH ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The evidence was troubling: A vast pool of underground water, stretching more 
than three miles from the edge of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station to the 
heart of residential Irvine, had been contaminated with a cancer-causing 
chemical. 
</P>
<P>
As the local water district official delivered his report at a recent public 
meeting, he built a case against the military as the source of the 
contamination. Seated in the front row, Navy Capt. S. R. Holm Jr., attired in 
freshly pressed dress blues, listened intently until it was his turn to speak. 
When he stood, he had no counterattack, only a conciliatory offering. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Full Responsibility' 
</P>
<P>
"If it is shown that we were at fault, we will take full responsibility," Holm 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Holm's remarks, some say, reflect the U.S. Marine Corps' gradual change of 
attitude toward environmental issues. The Tustin Marine Corps Helicopter Air 
Station and El Toro Marine Corps Air Station have long been among Orange 
County's largest producers of hazardous wastes, according to county records. 
For nearly four decades, solvents, jet fuel, paint products and hydraulic 
fluids were dumped routinely -- an illegal practice by today's standards -- at 
El Toro, a 4,900-acre jet fighter and bomber training base, and at the nearby 
Tustin base, a 1,000-acre helicopter training facility. 
</P>
<P>
It was even common practice at many installations, including El Toro, to spray 
dirt lots and vacant fields with petroleum wastes and chemicals to control dust 
on windy days. 
</P>
<P>
But the Marines are changing their ways. Facing public pressure, tougher laws 
and a health risk to their own troops, they have given environmental issues a 
higher priority, said Holm, director of facilities management at the El Toro 
base. The corps is willing to right the environmental wrongs of the past and 
cooperate with local, state and federal regulatory agencies, which have 
complained for years about the military's failure to clean up its hazardous 
waste, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the El Toro air station, the Marines in recent years have identified 14 
sites, including several landfills and firefighter training pits, where 
hazardous wastes such as jet fuel and paint thinners may have been dumped in 
the past. Similarly, 11 such sites have been identified at the Tustin base. 
None of these sites has yet been excavated or tested, so it is not known 
whether they contain any high levels of toxic wastes or radioactive material. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$500,000 Effort 
</P>
<P>
To make that determination, the corps says that within the next year, it will 
use more than $500,000 from the military's $400-million Defense Environmental 
Restoration Account -- the U.S. Defense Department's special environmental 
cleanup fund -- to investigate the suspected hazardous waste sites at each 
base. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't always been the best neighbor when it comes to taking care of the 
environment," Holm said. "But we like to think we've gotten a bit more 
enlightened in recent years." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Mayor Larry Agran, one of the military's harshest local 
</P>
<P>
critics, agrees that the Marines have begun to show a "greater inclination to 
listen" to concerns and complaints from surrounding cities and outside 
agencies. But he predicted that the Marines' "new attitude" will be tested as 
water and health experts begin acting to clean up what is potentially the 
largest ground-water contamination case in Orange County history. 
</P>
<P>
Varying levels of trichloroethylene, or TCE, have been detected in the ground 
water beneath the El Toro air base and portions of Irvine. The presence of 
cancer-causing TCE, a strong degreasing agent used by the military until the 
late 1970s to clean jet fighter and helicopter engines, poses no immediate 
threat to public wells. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange County Water District officials warn that if the polluted ground 
water, which has contaminated several miles of the aquifer, is not removed, it 
eventually could seep into Irvine's domestic drinking supplies. The aquifer is 
a pocket of porous rock near the earth's surface where water collects. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been an attempt by the Marines to be more forthcoming about 
environmental issues," Agran said. "But we are dealing with something here that 
is much bigger than disclosure or public relations. We have a serious problem, 
and I think this is a big test of the Marines' willingness to cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, the Marines say they are better armed now to meet the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
For years, one person monitored the handling and disposal of tons of hazardous 
materials and wastes at both air stations. Since 1984, the Marines have added 
five experts to their environmental staff, headed by Navy Ensign Michael Rehor, 
a chemical engineer. In addition, a hazardous waste recycling program has been 
launched on the bases to sell unused or contaminated jet fuel, solvents, paints 
and petroleum-based products to civilian contractors. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a $7.5-million military contract awarded recently to a Santa Ana 
firm, a long-awaited inspection of 460 underground fuel storage tanks at the El 
Toro base is scheduled to begin this summer, a process that may take up to four 
years to complete. Only 80 of the tanks are in use; the rest have been 
abandoned and, for the most part, are empty. State and local health officials 
have long pushed for a tank inspection program at El Toro out of concern that 
the tanks, many of which are as old as the 56-year-old base, may be leaking 
toxic residues. 
</P>
<P>
Under California law, all underground chemical and fuel tanks should have been 
inspected by their owners by 1986. So far only one tank at El Toro has been 
examined. That 110,000-gallon storage tank was found to be in good condition, 
but a feeder line carrying high-performance jet fuel had a tiny leak, which has 
been patched, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"A year ago, we were not very happy with the Marines," said Robert Merryman, 
Orange County's director of environmental health. "But today, as far as 
compliance with the underground tank-testing program goes, we're very pleased." 
</P>
<P>
The Marines have taken several preventive steps as well. Classes on the 
handling and proper disposal of hazardous materials and wastes are conducted 
regularly for those who live and work at the two bases. Storage drums 
containing paint thinners, hydraulic fluids, oily rags and lubricants must be 
clearly marked, numbered and stored at one of 60 hazardous waste accumulation 
sites at the two bases. Each barrel is listed on a master log and its movement 
on base is tracked. 
</P>
<P>
"A large part of our job is education," Holm said. "We've got 10,000 Marines 
here, many of them young kids from the hills of West Virginia or Oklahoma. At 
home, they think nothing of going out back and dumping a couple of cans of 
motor oil into the stream. For them, it's an acceptable practice." 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't work in Orange County, he said. "Fortunately, today's Marine 
is much more sensitive to the environment than 10 years ago. . . . But that's 
not to say we don't have a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
The ground-water issue remains the most serious problem. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Marines have refused to acknowledge full responsibility, county, 
state and federal officials say the El Toro base is the primary source of the 
TCE found in the contaminated ground water. The U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency last year recommended placing the entire El Toro base on the national 
Superfund list for toxic waste sites. If it receives Superfund status, EPA 
officials will then oversee inspection, cleanup and monitoring of any hazardous 
waste sites on base, including the TCE-contaminated ground water. 
</P>
<P>
The TCE controversy illustrates one of the most persistent complaints about the 
corps: its slow response to resolving environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not pointing the finger at them for what they did 20 or 30 years ago," 
said Curt Berchthold, senior engineer with the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality 
Board, which oversees most of the watershed in Orange, Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
"We know people dumped TCE and other chemicals on the ground. The problem we 
have is the rate at which they are moving to correct those problems. They 
continue to go about their business in a very slow and methodical fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem, Holm said, is the bureaucratic nature of the military. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I wish we could move faster. When people say we're slow, I think it's 
a fair criticism," Holm said. "Trouble is, this is a big place, and people 
forget that we're like a small city. It takes time to react."

SCHOOL HEALTH CLINICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Unified School District board made a move in the right direction 
by approving, in concept, the high school-based health and social service 
clinic ("School Board Takes Step Toward a Health Clinic," May 17). 
</P>
<P>
Being a student at UC San Diego, I find it very convenient and helpful to have 
a health service on campus. There is no need to worry if you cannot pay the 
bill, because there is no cost to see a doctor. Without this service, I would 
not be as inclined to see a doctor if I had a health problem, because medical 
costs are so outrageous today. For students with little or no money, the health 
center is a useful service. 
</P>
<P>
Students who are in high school should have the same opportunity to health 
services. Low-income parents can no more afford medical care for their children 
than starving university students can. I feel the health clinics would provide 
the much-needed services not available to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
The question about family planning being included should be set aside for the 
moment. This issue will take a while to settle and should not stop the health 
clinic idea totally. The clinics are not based exclusively on family planning, 
so this topic does not need to delay the approval of installing health clinics. 
Improving students' health is the primary issue here, not birth control.

DIVIDE AND CONQUER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Barry Horstman's May 23 article ("Supervisors OK Growth Compromise That 
Pleases Neither Side"), a misunderstanding of Bob Glaser's past growth support 
was made. 
</P>
<P>
It was Citizens for Limited Growth that gathered signatures and put the "slow 
growth" initiative on the ballot. Glaser and San Diegans for Managed Growth 
encouraged and supported the opposing ballot measure, and we therefore lost 
with a divided vote. The best way to win an election is to divide the vote, and 
I hope we will remember this example when we have another citizen ballot 
measure.

20 YEARS ERODE FERVOR, BUT NOT HER PRO-CHOICE VIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNY CULLINAN-JAMES, Jenny Cullinan-James is the promotion and public 
relations manager for The Times' San Diego County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
When President Reagan's Supreme Court nominees were making news in October, a 
business acquaintance commented: "This could overturn Roe vs. Wade. And I'll 
tell you, that's the one issue that could get me on a plane to march on 
Washington." 
</P>
<P>
Washington. March. Her words sent me back to the late '60s and to the Foggy 
Bottom district of the capital. When I was 18 and a stone's throw from the 
White House, the world looked pretty absolute. Those were days of 
demonstrations against war and poverty, days of "I'll never . . . " and "I'll 
always . . . " 
</P>
<P>
I picked up the shreds of the conversation with the San Diego bank executive 
that had sent me off on this journey. And I agreed. Me too. First plane. Take 
the kids. 
</P>
<P>
But when it came time to march in April, I wasn't in Washington. I read the 
newspaper accounts. I watched the television coverage. And I did it from 
California, wondering: What would that 18-year-old think of this 39-year-old? 
What would she say if she could see herself now? 
</P>
<P>
She'd probably be as amused by appearances as I was when I ran across an old 
photo the other day. She had great expectations, that earnest liberal with 
ironed hair and painfully tight, yet rumpled, bell-bottom jeans. But I'm a 
forgiving sort, and I think she would be, too, even of the rationalizations I 
employed to avoid thinking about a trip to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Once I got past the client breakfast for 140, I'd think about it. 
</P>
<P>
After the kids recovered from the chicken pox, I'd be able to plan better. 
(Kids? she would ask. She didn't plan to have kids.) 
</P>
<P>
As soon as I scheduled the refrigerator delivery, my husband's grousing would 
return to normal levels. (What's a Sub-Zero, and why does it cost more than a 
year's college tuition?) 
</P>
<P>
If I can just get in to have that engine noise diagnosed, I'll sort out my 
schedule. (That car -- you drive a big car like that?) 
</P>
<P>
But, after being amused, the 18-year-old me would certainly be puzzled by some 
of my delays. How could I explain the frustration of repeatedly illegible 
copies from the facsimile machine? Or the capital expenditure form it takes to 
justify a scanner for the art department's Macintosh computer? Or being placed 
on call-waiting by a friend who's expecting her amniocentesis results? When I 
stop to think about it, I'm a little perplexed by all that myself. 
</P>
<P>
But, although I look different and march to a different routine, I can't avoid 
the disappointment that I know the 18-year-old would feel in me. I'm 
disappointed in myself. I made such a grand-but-hollow vow in that conversation 
back in October. Go to Washington. Speak up for what you believe is right 
before it's too late. What could be more important? It would have shocked and 
hurt me when I was 18 -- and abortion was already legal in the District of 
Columbia -- to learn that the right to an abortion was again at risk, and that 
I failed to do my small share in a historic controversy. 
</P>
<P>
My disappointment in myself is probably more bitter than hers because I'm more 
committed to the pro-choice position now. It's more real. 
</P>
<P>
In my college days, the most I did was help escort a few women past the 
demonstrators who were the precursors of today's "pro-life" protesters. 
</P>
<P>
But, since then, I've nursed a couple of friends through post-abortion recovery 
and I've watched others grapple with parenthood without the benefit of an 
essential ingredient: Enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
When I was young, I felt concern for a woman burdened with an unwanted child; 
now my empathy is probably greater for a child burdened with an unwilling 
mother. Regardless of the advocacy, who would wish a miserable generation on 
these two? 
</P>
<P>
My belief in abortion has also been cemented by a personal event, one I 
couldn't have imagined at 18. 
</P>
<P>
A pregnancy between the birth of my sons ended tragically for my husband and me 
when prenatal tests revealed that our unborn child was hopelessly flawed by 
conditions "inconsistent with life." Our decision to abort was excruciating. I 
thought nothing could be more difficult, though I don't know that anyone who 
hasn't faced that choice could understand why. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, I've thought of something that would have magnified that pain: What 
if we had needed some stranger's approval to implement that terrible decision? 
</P>
<P>
My heart goes out to partners who must make this choice on the basis of a 
less-conclusive diagnosis, or those women who simply feel they are not ready 
for motherhood. I can't imagine how they would feel if they had to make this 
brutal decision contingent on the consent of some authorities, which could 
happen if Roe vs. Wade is overturned. I can't imagine what it would take to try 
to build and present a persuasive case on such a painful issue. 
</P>
<P>
I wish I could meet the 18-year-old me today. Twenty years of living make me 
admire her expectations and instincts. It's curious to me to think that I've 
traveled so much longer yet still share her views on this subject. 
</P>
<P>
There's one more thing about the 18-year-old that hasn't changed -- neither of 
us ever enjoyed "making a spectacle of oneself," as a cranky aunt used to put 
it. But unseemly behavior is less important than doing what's right. 
</P>
<P>
My husband and I have treated the circumstances of our baby's death as a very 
private event, until now. But, since I didn't "vote with my feet" in April, I 
must try to speak with my word processor in May. 
</P>
<P>
I think that might amuse and perplex, but not disappoint, the 18-year-old.DR,

MARINE DIES IN CRASH WHILE DRAG-RACING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 24-year-old Marine sergeant from Camp Pendleton died early Saturday when his 
motorcycle spun out of control while he was drag-racing with another 
motorcyclist down an Oceanside street. 
</P>
<P>
The man, whose identity was being withheld pending notification of relatives, 
suffered massive head injuries and died before paramedics could rush him to 
Tri-City Hospital, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The man was racing along North Pacific Street shortly after midnight when he 
lost control in the 500 block, struck a curb and was thrown to the ground, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities are seeking the rider of the second motorcycle, which did not stop.

REFLECTIONS

By Caroline Lemke, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
'I seem to photograph birds more than anything else. They are the most 
challenging. . . . A flower just sits there.' 
</P>
<P>
 The walls of Anthony Mercieca's Chula Vista home are covered with vivid color 
photographs of hawks, bison, bull elk and kit foxes. One picture -- of an elf 
owl swooping down on a field mouse -- took Mercieca over a week to capture just 
the way he wanted. But spending hours, even days, waiting for the right shot is 
nothing upsetting to the 51-year-old nature photographer who has traveled the 
world and snapped for such publications as National Geographic and Audubon. 
Mercieca retired early from National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co. so he would 
have more time to pursue his passion. Most recently, he spends his days 
observing the peregrine falcons' nest in the steelwork beneath the Coronado Bay 
Bridge. It was Mercieca who rescued one of the baby falcons after it left its 
nest for the first time and crashed into the side of the San Diego Trolley. 
Times staff writer Caroline Lemke interviewed Mercieca and Stan Honda 
photographed him. 
</P>
<P>
I started in photography when I was about 16 years old. I was born and raised 
in Malta, and I did a lot of diving when I was growing up. I took pictures of 
only natural things. Very seldom would I do anything else. 
</P>
<P>
I immigrated to the United States in 1959. I came to San Diego in 1960 and 
worked with National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding for 27 years before retiring in 
1987. When I first came here I didn't know anybody, and Dave Fitch from 
Nelson's Photo suggested I take a nature photography class at night school. He 
said I could meet people interested in the same things as me. 
</P>
<P>
So my photography happened all along the way. I do a lot of work for National 
Wildlife and their publication for children, "Ranger Rick." My stuff has been 
used by all the major publications -- National Geographic, National Wildlife, 
Audubon. 
</P>
<P>
I think my love of nature goes back to when I was a little kid. My father 
bought me a little bird, a yellow wagtail. They sold for three pennies in those 
days. I was interested in nature ever since then. I used to go out and trap 
birds and study them. 
</P>
<P>
I've been to Alaska and Africa, and I've done a lot of photography in Arizona 
and Texas and North Dakota. Now I'm getting ready to go off to the Sierras. I 
will probably be there all summer. 
</P>
<P>
I've done all these trips on vacations and weekends and evenings. You can 
accomplish a lot with just two days on the weekend, if you get everything 
organized. Getting organized means finding a bird's nest, remembering where it 
is, and knowing when the young hatch. 
</P>
<P>
I seem to photograph birds more than anything else. They are the most 
challenging. I mean, a flower just sits there, and some people do great work 
with that, but a bird . . . first you've got to find it, then you've got to get 
close enough. That's a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes I work all night. Like, at Otay Lake there is a pair of night hawks 
that nest there every year. I wanted to get a picture of them feeding, so I 
spent several nights there. It took me three different years to finally get the 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
I belong to the Peregrine Falcon Society, and our group decided when the birds 
below the Coronado Bridge fledge, somebody should be down there to help them. 
They aren't very capable birds. They think -- like when we were young and we 
thought we could do everything -- that they can fly like their parents. And, as 
soon as they try to fly, they find out how little they can do. And they get 
tired very easily. 
</P>
<P>
The first day, one of the birds flew out of the nest and ran into the side of 
the trolley. I saw this, went and picked it up, and took it to the zoo. We got 
that bird back from the zoo, and the very same day another bird got in trouble 
and broke its wing. 
</P>
<P>
I've been to the nest every day twice a day since the birds fledged. In the 
first days, I spent all day there. It's never boring. 
</P>
<P>
It sure helps to have a lot of knowledge about the animals and birds you 
photograph. About all I read about is stuff about nature. I don't call it an 
obsession. It's not going to kill me if I don't do it, but it sure would make 
my life a little harder.

VETERANS' HEALTH CARE FACES CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Department of Veterans Affairs announced Friday that it will cut some 
veterans health care services because "urgently needed" funds are tied up in a 
congressional battle over an emergency spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
VA Secretary Edward Derwinski called the cutbacks "temporary" and said they 
will be closely monitored. But he warned that unless the urgently needed new 
funds reach the VA soon, more drastic cutbacks will follow. 
</P>
<P>
Among the immediate steps being taken to save health care funds include a 
freeze on accepting new patients whose eligibility depends on available VA 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
Except in emergencies, the agency said, veterans affected are those whose 
status is not service-connected and whose incomes are above limits set by law. 
</P>
<P>
Other actions include decreasing staff levels at VA facilities through 
attrition, the agency said. It said the VA also will halt spending used to 
purchase and maintain certain medical equipment and will delay the start-up of 
several new projects. 
</P>
<P>
Derwinski said the cutbacks and other cost-saving measures should keep the VA 
health care facilities operating until June 15, "when we are cautiously 
optimistic that the Congress will resolve its differences and provide VA with 
urgently needed funds."

REMELMEYER HAS HEART SURGERY AFTER SUFFERING CHEST PAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Torrance City Atty. Stanley E. Remelmeyer was in stable condition 
Saturday at Torrance Memorial Hospital Medical Center after undergoing open 
heart surgery Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Remelmeyer, 70, was hospitalized after suffering chest pains while attending a 
political fund-raiser in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert said she had been informed by Remelmeyer's wife 
that he underwent a bypass operation. 
</P>
<P>
Remelmeyer was transported to Torrance Memorial's intensive care unit by 
ambulance Friday after spending Thursday night in the critical care unit of San 
Pedro Peninsula Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Remelmeyer was driven to the San Pedro hospital by Torrance City Councilman Dan 
Walker after he complained of chest pains while attending a fund-raising dinner 
in San Pedro for Assemblyman Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro). 
</P>
<P>
Remelmeyer retired last November after 32 years as Torrance city attorney. He 
was appointed earlier this month to serve for two to three months as interim 
city attorney in Hermosa Beach while the city seeks a permanent city attorney.

ROGERS STEPS DOWN AS VINCENNES SKIPPER; 
</P>
<P>
CAPTAIN ALSO HONORED FOR ACTIONS DURING TOUR OF DUTY IN PERSIAN GULF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Capt. Will C. Rogers III was awarded the Legion of Merit on Saturday, a top 
military honor, as he stepped down from command of the Vincennes, a 
guided-missile cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
He has been reassigned to shore duty in what Navy officials describe as a 
routine transfer. 
</P>
<P>
The Vincennes created an international furor last July when it mistakenly shot 
down an Iranian airliner in the Persian Gulf during a firefight with seven 
Iranian gunboats, killing all 290 people on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking from the deck of the ship, Rogers lashed out against the "rabid 
ideology" of terrorists and the "lack of courage" of those who give in to 
terrorist actions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ovation for Wife 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Sharon, seated among 500 spectators on the pier next to the ship, 
drew a standing ovation from the crowd Saturday as she accepted a bouquet of 
red roses from the Navy at the change-of-command ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Last March, she survived a suspected terrorist bomb attack as she drove to her 
teaching job in La Jolla. Several days later, she was fired by administrators 
of the exclusive La Jolla Country Day School, who feared her presence posed a 
security threat to the children. 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators have speculated that the pipe bombs that destroyed her 
van may have been planted in retaliation for the downing of the civilian 
airliner. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony took place amid unusually tight security at the 32nd Street Naval 
Station. Only invited guests were allowed on the base, and all had to pass 
through two security checks and a metal detector. The Rogerses remain under the 
constant protection of the Naval Investigative Service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pupils as Guests 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests were a number of children from the fourth-grade class Sharon 
Rogers taught at La Jolla Country Day School. Giggling and smiling, the 
children gathered around her before the ceremony. Sharon Rogers has not 
returned to the school since the bombing incident and has reached a $135,000 
settlement with its administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers called his wife "a very brave and courageous lady," and described her 
reaction on the morning her van exploded at a La Jolla intersection. 
</P>
<P>
"She literally rode the fireball out of the vehicle, sprinted to the curb, 
combed the shrapnel from her hair and asked a construction worker to call and 
inform me that she had experienced a minor mechanical difficulty," Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I arrived, she was most concerned, as her lesson plans were in flames and 
she was going to be late for school." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Posted to Point Loma 
</P>
<P>
Rogers has been reassigned as commander of the Tactical Development and 
Training Group based at Point Loma. He will be replaced on the Vincennes by 
Capt. Robert B. Lynch, who previously was assigned to the Naval Military 
Personnel Command. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers was given the Legion of Merit award for his performance as commanding 
officer of the Vincennes, to which he was assigned in April, 1987. A letter 
written on behalf of President Bush by Navy Sec. H. Lawrence Garrett III 
described Rogers' "superb professionalism, confidence and exceptional 
leadership and dedication to excellence." 
</P>
<P>
During the ship's tour in the Persian Gulf, Rogers' "tactical skills and calm 
direction enabled his crew to successfully engage seven heavily armed 
high-speed Iranian surface craft" attacking the Vincennes in "confined and 
confused waters," the letter stated. "As a result, five craft were destroyed 
and two retreated." 
</P>
<P>
The letter made no mention of the Iranian airliner, which Rogers ordered shot 
down that day in the mistaken belief that it was an Iranian fighter plane. 
Rogers and his crew were cleared of any responsibility for the mistake in a 
Defense Department investigation last year.

LAWSUITS CHALLENGE PROJECT ON PIKE SITE

<TEXT>
<P>
Two citizens groups have filed lawsuits challenging the city's approval of a 
massive shoreline development project on the site of the old Pike Amusement 
Park, claiming city officials have paid scant heed to traffic and air pollution 
problems associated with the $1-billion project. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits, filed in Superior Court in Los Angeles, assert that the city's 
environmental impact report fails to fully address the development's 
environmental problems or ways of alleviating them. The housing association 
also claims the upscale, mixed-use Pike development is ignoring a critical need 
for more affordable housing in Long Beach.

NEWMAN; 
</P>
<P>
IF HIS DETRACTORS ARE RIGHT, THEN WHERE DID THOSE SIX MISL TITLES COME FROM?

<P>
There is a tad of little boy left in Ron Newman. You see it when he jumps up 
from his chair to demonstrate a play. Or when he flashes a devilish smile while 
discussing a tactic that might bend Major Indoor Soccer League rules to the 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
It's a bit surprising that Newman hasn't lost his appetite for this game. He 
has been through more than his share of rough spots as coach of the often wild, 
sometimes complaining and usually zany Sockers. 
</P>
<P>
Newman has been called everything from a borderline idiot to a borderline 
genius, sometimes in the same sentence. Players say his English style of soccer 
is archaic. Coaches say his innovations show disrespect for the game. He has 
been trashed in the newspapers and is never far from a critic. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Newman has been on the winning end of more indoor soccer games than any 
coach in history. His record over nine years is 298-153, including a 60-23 
playoff mark. 
</P>
<P>
The skeptics have their argument. Check the talent, you'll hear. Where would he 
be without Juli Veee? Branko Segota? Kevin Crow, Brian Quinn and Steve Zungul? 
</P>
<P>
It seems people think this group could have racked up as many victories with 
Fred Flintstone running the show. But even Newman's harshest critics admit he 
deserves some credit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure we would have won championships," says Crow, the defender who once 
requested a trade because he said he no longer wanted to play for Newman. "But 
I don't think we would have won six." 
</P>
<P>
Monday, the Sockers play Baltimore in Game 1 of the MISL championship series. 
Newman is four victories away from his seventh title. His team, as usual, 
pulled through a slow start, a host of injuries and a 3-2 deficit in the 
semifinals of the playoffs against Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
That's typical. Little has come easily for Newman. 
</P>
<P>
As a child, he often had to go to bed in an air-raid shelter because German 
bombers were attacking the naval yard in his hometown of Portsmouth, England. 
</P>
<P>
His first professional contract as a player earned him $7 a week, hardly enough 
to start an early retirement plan. 
</P>
<P>
And despite the championships, life with the Sockers has been rocky. Perhaps 
most indicative of that is the way he has learned to measure success. It isn't 
in terms of money, victories or championships. Rather, he figures his worth by 
the number of times he has been ripped in the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Somebody once told him: "It's only when you've made it that you're going to 
start getting people calling you names in the media." 
</P>
<P>
By that criteria, Newman could be considered among the greatest coaches of all 
time. In any city, any sport. 
</P>
<P>
Examples? 
</P>
<P>
First some background. During January and February of 1986, the Sockers made a 
practice of calling timeouts late in games in which they held comfortable 
leads. Newman decided these were good situations to practice pulling the goalie 
in favor of a sixth attacker, his invention. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the league, even some of the Sockers, took exception, calling it poor 
sportsmanship. Displeasure was voiced in print. 
</P>
<P>
Former St. Louis defender Steve Pecher said: "Some of (the Sockers) were coming 
up to us after the game and apologizing. They said, 'Don't kick us. It's not 
our fault. (Newman) was an idiot last year, and he's an idiot this year.' " 
</P>
<P>
To this day, Crow thinks his coach was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I still disagree with it," he said. "He said he was doing it for practice. If 
you're the other team, you're not going to look at it that way." 
</P>
<P>
Newman defends himself, saying if he was looking to rub salt in a team's wounds 
he would "tell everybody to get on one leg and cover an eye." 
</P>
<P>
Criticism of Newman has been frequent. Many disagree with his ideas, from 
players who were taught different brands of soccer in their native countries, 
to referees who never could figure what Newman was going to come up with next, 
to coaches who were perhaps simply jealous. 
</P>
<P>
Without Newman, this game might have progressed at a nice, steady pace and, 
quite possibly, never reached its present level of excitement. Call it a poor 
imitation of traditional soccer if you will, but Newman's intentions were 
always to improve the entertainment value of both his team and the game. 
</P>
<P>
His first step in preparing for the switch from outdoor to indoor was to read a 
hockey book. He didn't get much out of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I found it just like a very ordinary soccer coaching book," Newman said. "They 
did the same sort of things you do with high school boys." 
</P>
<P>
Early on, Newman toyed with substitution. It didn't make sense to him to make a 
great player run up and down the carpet so long that he could hardly walk by 
game's end. So he had players coming and going so fast it made heads spin. Of 
course, that also caused problems. 
</P>
<P>
Once, in a game against Chicago, Newman noticed opposing players coming on the 
field before their teammates had gone off. He questioned the referee, and the 
conversation went something like this: 
</P>
<P>
Newman: What bloody rules are we playing? 
</P>
<P>
Referee: As long as they don't interfere with the game anymore, the other 
player can come in. 
</P>
<P>
Newman: That seems a bit bloody lax. 
</P>
<P>
Referee: That's the way hockey does it. 
</P>
<P>
Newman: OK, if we're following hockey . . . 
</P>
<P>
So the next game, in New York against the Cosmos, Newman decided to give the 
laws of hockey a go. He asked the referees to clarify the substitution rule 
once again and was told the same thing, a player could enter the game as long 
as the player coming off was no longer involved in the play. 
</P>
<P>
With that established, Newman proceeded to have an offensive player run toward 
the wall every time the Cosmos began a breakaway and send a defensive player 
flying off the bench at the other end to mark their unsuspecting center 
forward. It worked like a charm and, in Newman's words, "The New York fans went 
mad." 
</P>
<P>
The refs pulled Newman aside at halftime and told him he was stretching the 
rule a bit too far. Maybe more accurately, it was another case of Newman 
stretching his imagination. 
</P>
<P>
During games, Newman stands near the substitution doors. He found out awhile 
back he could give his players an advantage by opening the door and redirecting 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about that, he breaks into a "guilty-as-charged" smile. "I shouldn't do 
that," he says. "Sometimes I see that ball coming, and I know if I turn that 
door a little bit it may change the angle. It's irresistible." 
</P>
<P>
If Newman's creative mind is one reason for his success, perhaps a bigger one 
is his ability to squeeze the best out of a wide variety of players with vastly 
different backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
This season, he brought back superstar Yugoslavian Steve Zungul who, at 34, was 
a question mark. Other teams didn't want him. Some thought it was a stupid 
move. 
</P>
<P>
Turns out Zungul is second only to Segota in playoff points (12) and has given 
the team valuable experience on the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Newman has learned bits and pieces from each player's style and 
incorporated it into his master game plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's been very flexible," Quinn said. "He kind of gives players a free 
rein to do what they want as long as they produce." 
</P>
<P>
That hasn't been easy. Players don't always agree with Newman's style, which is 
largely based on his English background. 
</P>
<P>
Listen to Juli Veee: "He comes from the old school, caveman time. The indoor 
game is a very new game. The English style of soccer doesn't fit this game at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
But Newman's coaching does. He has never put a choke hold on the creativity of 
his players. He knows when to leave well enough alone. To hear Veee tell it, 
there's no other way to deal with the Sockers. They've always been too crazy to 
control. 
</P>
<P>
"The American public doesn't understand the nationality problem," Veee said. "I 
couldn't stand half of (the players). And they didn't like me, either." 
</P>
<P>
Judging by some of the negative things said by Socker players in the 
newspapers, Newman couldn't be categorized as a popular coach. You don't find 
him at the bar on team trips surrounded by players, though maybe he would like 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron would like to be close to the players," Quinn said. "He likes everybody to 
be his friend. Maybe that's not the nature of the job requirement." 
</P>
<P>
There's difficulty in playing two roles, authority figure and friend. 
</P>
<P>
Veee said he hardly spoke two words to Newman off the field. But when Veee was 
having personal problems, going through a divorce, Newman told him: "Juli, take 
as much time as you want. Don't worry about it." 
</P>
<P>
"He let you work your own things off," Veee said. "I think he's one helluva 
good human being." 
</P>
<P>
A sensitive one, too. He admits the public criticism isn't something he takes 
in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts," he said. "I don't know anybody who likes it. I don't like my family 
involved in that type of thing. I don't think it should be done in the media. 
I've never criticized a player in the media." 
</P>
<P>
For every critical player who feels Newman's coaching has had little to do with 
the Sockers' success, there are others who say he has had quite a bit to do 
with it. Waad Hirmez is the first to admit that if anyone should criticize 
Newman, it should be him. Newman cut him twice. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Hirmez says: "He will give a player a chance over and over. You have 
to give credit to the person who's putting all these players on the field. He 
has done so much for the game in this country. I just can't see why anybody 
would criticize him for anything he does." 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, through good and bad, Newman has retained his sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
There's one story Newman's son, Guy (who played for the Sockers from 1980-86) 
enjoys telling. One day before practice, the players were sitting around 
waiting for Ron Newman. He arrived and told Steve Daley, a midfielder, to get 
up and do some sprints. The players watched. About the time Daley was getting 
tired, somebody asked Newman what he was doing. Newman said he had recently 
been in for a checkup, and the doctor told him: "You need to exercise 'daily.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
There are many more stories, including the time Veee was supposed to speak at a 
luncheon and wasn't able to make it, so Newman showed up with a life-size 
cutout of Veee and spoke for him. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that Newman still enjoys coaching. He dismisses the mishaps 
with a simple: "Those sort of things happen." 
</P>
<P>
It's the price for doing what he loves.

"The tolerance this man has," says Veee, pausing. "He puts his whole life into 
soccer."

DODGERS' HERSHISER ONE BASEBALL STAR WHO CONTINUES TO SHINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Baseball reached its first checkpoint of the season this Memorial Day weekend 
with many of its best hitters apparently on a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Home runs and scoring are down, along with the entire American League East 
Division and some of the game's top stars. 
</P>
<P>
Three of last year's major award winners -- MVPs Jose Canseco and Kirk Gibson 
and Cy Young winner Frank Viola -- have found encores difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco has been out all season with a bad wrist. A damaged hamstring cost 
Gibson 22 games on the disabled list. Viola, locked in an ugly contract battle 
at the start of the season, is struggling along at 3-6 with a 4.12 earned run 
average compared to 7-1, 2.69 at this time last year. 
</P>
<P>
Only Orel Hershiser, the playoff and World Series MVP, was on track with a 6-3 
record and 1.76 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati Manager Pete Rose has been playing defense for more than two months 
now during an investigation by the commissioner's office. His situation and its 
possible ramifications are more serious, however, than that of the laughable AL 
East where three teams -- Cleveland, Boston, Baltimore -- shared first place 
for one day last week, despite the fact that each of them was under .500. 
</P>
<P>
It was the latest ever that a team -- in this case three teams -- that had lost 
more games than it had won, held the top spot in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, hitters were having a heyday with home runs flying out of 
ballparks at a record pace. Some people suspected that baseballs were being 
altered to aid the previously dormant offenses. At the 1987 All-Star Game, Bart 
Giamatti, then president of the National League, was asked if, in fact, the 
balls were juiced. 
</P>
<P>
The ex-president of Yale drew himself up indignantly, looked the questioner 
squarely in the eye and said: "No more than I am, sir." 
</P>
<P>
Now Giamatti is commissioner and the hitters who were tearing it up then, seem 
to have gone south. Over 100 fewer homers have been hit and more than 200 fewer 
runs scored this season than there were at this time a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of offense, the pitchers are flourishing with their collective 
ERAs down from 3.78 at Memorial Day in 1988 to 3.67 just before the checkpoint 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
As the holiday approached, Wade Boggs of Boston was batting .301, not bad for 
most hitters but terrible for a guy who was at .347 at this time a year ago and 
is a career .356 hitter. Fred Lynn was hitting .203 with one homer and nine 
runs batted in for Detroit. Montreal's Andres Galarraga, hailed as one of the 
National League's top young first basemen, was at .224. Jack Clark, acquired by 
San Diego last fall, was at an embarrassing .193. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Yankees' Don Mattingly was batting .269 and celebrated the 
approach of the holiday with his first home run of the season. In fact, the 
Yankees, once a haven for left-handed hitters with Yankee Stadium's short right 
field porch, had just two other homers by lefty hitters all season, a figure 
that astounded their ex-slugger, Reggie Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole team's got two?" he said before Mattingly connected. "I could do 
that by myself." 
</P>
<P>
And he's been retired for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Numbers like those, plus the sub-.200 averages of Gary Carter, Mookie Wilson, 
Gregg Jefferies and John Shelby, and the not much over-.200 figures of Lloyd 
Moseby, Juan Samuel, Terry Pendleton, Willie McGee, Benito Santiago, Willie 
Randolph, Shawon Dunston and Chris Sabo would suggest that the pitchers are 
benefitting. But that's not the case for all of them. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota's Viola wasn't the only one with problems. Detroit's Jack Morris, the 
winningest pitcher of the decade, drifted through the first two months at 2-7 
with a 4.94 ERA. Pascual Perez of Montreal, who missed spring training because 
he was in a rehabilitation progam, was 0-7 with a 5.04 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Jackson of Cincinnati, runnerup in the Cy Young race when he won 23 games 
with 15 complete games a year ago, was 3-7 with no complete games this season. 
Atlanta's pitching Smiths, Zane and Pete, were 1-7 and 1-5 respectively. 
Chicago's Greg Maddux, a 15-game winner at the All-Star break last year, was 
3-5. Charley Hough of Texas was 3-5 with a 5.83. 
</P>
<P>
If they're all doing so badly, then who's doing well? 
</P>
<P>
Oakland, despite the season-long absence of Canseco, has stayed at the top of 
the AL West, largely because of the fast starts of Dave Stewart, who was 8-1, 
and bullpen ace Dennis Eckersley, who had 14 saves. 
</P>
<P>
Carney Lansford of the A's was leading the league in hitting and teammate Terry 
Steinbach, the All-Star Game MVP when he was a .220 hitter a year ago, was 
batting over 100 points higher than that. 
</P>
<P>
Will Clark of San Francisco was 50 points ahead of everybody in the NL batting 
race and teammate Kevin Mitchell was comfortably in front in home runs and 
RBIs. That kept the Giants hot on the heels of Cincinnati, which ignored Rose's 
woes to lead the NL West race through the early going. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Ballard, with 10 lifetime victories before this season, won seven games 
for Baltimore, and Lee Guetterman, with a career 5.11 ERA, had a string of 30 
2-3 scoreless innings out of the Yankees' bullpen before that ended the night 
Mattingly hit his homer. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps nobody's doing better, however, than Toronto's Nelson Liriano. Burdened 
with a good-field, no-hit reputation, Liriano was batting .318 and leading the 
league in breaking pitcher's hearts. 
</P>
<P>
Twice within five days in April, pitchers took no-hitters into the ninth inning 
against Toronto and both times Liriano broke up the bids, first against Nolan 
Ryan of Texas and then against Kirk McCaskill of California.

PREACHER ROE SAVORS HIS MEMORIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes when he's weeding his tomatoes or fishing for a trophy bass, Preacher 
Roe can't help but wonder what his left arm in its prime would be worth in the 
major leagues today. 
</P>
<P>
At least $1 million a year, perhaps more. Roe smiles and shakes his head. The 
most money he made in a season in his 12-year career that ended in 1954 was 
$28,500. When he won 22 games in 1951, he got a $2,500 raise. 
</P>
<P>
"I really like to brag about this: I was the highest-paid pitcher in Brooklyn 
Dodger history one time," Roe said. "I thought $28,500 was the greatest thing 
there ever was. Back then, it was. A man making $10,000 or $12,000, those were 
good wages." 
</P>
<P>
But Elwin (Preacher) Roe, 73, says he wouldn't trade his baseball memories for 
a million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Roe, a product of the Ozark hills of northern Arkansas, compiled a 127-84 
record pitching for St. Louis in 1938, Pittsburgh from 1944-47 and Brooklyn 
from 1948-54. He was 93-37 at Brooklyn and had a 2-1 record in the Dodgers' 
three World Series appearances against their cross-town rivals, the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
His teammates included such greats as Jackie Robinson, Duke Snider, Gil Hodges, 
Carl Furillo, Pee Wee Reese, Roy Campanella, Don Newcombe and Al Lopez. He 
helped tutor a young Sandy Koufax. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of the time I played," Roe said. "Baseball was cleaning up its act. 
Years ago baseball had a reputation of being a little rough. Players drank a 
lot and caroused and tore up hotels. 
</P>
<P>
"And I saw the black man enter the scene. It was a great change in the game and 
I was part of that. I'm proud of it. I can't look back and wish I'd come along 
later." 
</P>
<P>
Roe, who lives in West Plains, a small town in southern Missouri, never had 
overpowering stuff. He won 10 or more games in eight seasons, including a 22-3 
mark in 1951, his best year, by mixing slow breaking pitches with an average 
fastball and pinpoint control. 
</P>
<P>
And he acknowledges slipping in an occasional spitball. 
</P>
<P>
Roe got his nickname when, at age 3, an uncle asked him what his name was. 
"Preacher," he replied, for no apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
Roe shifts uneasily in his chair, like a kid in a church pew, when he is asked 
about the spitter. 
</P>
<P>
Hitters had long accused Roe of throwing the illegal pitch, but not until a 
newspaper story was published after his retirement did he acknowledge it. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s, players talked extensively among themselves about the pros 
and cons of legalizing the spitter, Roe says. A couple years after his 
retirement, several pitchers asked Roe to speak publicly on behalf of 
legalizing the pitch. He agreed. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with New York sports writer Dick Young, Roe acknowledged 
throwing four spitballs. Monte Irvin hit one for a triple; Stan Musial and Ted 
Kluszewski struck out; and the fourth pitch bounced in the dirt for a ball. 
</P>
<P>
Roe claimed the spitter was not the dastardly pitch that batters and managers 
claimed, saying that it was far easier to hit than the knuckleball or forkball. 
</P>
<P>
The story caused a furor in baseball circles, and suddenly the pitchers who had 
promised to support Roe were nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
"Four spitters is all I admitted throwing then," Roe said. "But I don't mind 
telling you that I would throw about one a game, or two. But after that 
article, hell, everything you'd read said the spitball was all I ever threw. I 
threw everything that can be thrown except a forkball and a knuckleball." 
</P>
<P>
Roe said he intentionally tried to make hitters believe he was throwing a 
spitter to gain a psychological advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, I tell you, some of them got so upset when they came to bat. Ol' Jimmy 
Russell, he was so sure I was throwing a spitter he'd jump up and down and go 
berserk. Sometimes I'd get ready to pitch and have him back out and ask for the 
ball as many as six times in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"Another thing you could do too is if the umpire asks for the ball, you drop it 
on the ground. Then the hitter would think, Oh boy, something's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Roe considers his six-hit, 1-0 victory over the Yankees in his first World 
Series appearance in 1949 to be the highlight of his career. His association 
with Branch Rickey, the Dodgers' owner, was another. 
</P>
<P>
"Branch Rickey was one of the greatest people that ever lived," Roe said. "Mr. 
Rickey was the smartest judge of talent. He was morally a great man." 
</P>
<P>
Roe said when Rickey, then owner of the Cardinals, signed him in 1938, he spoke 
of the injustice of the policy of banning blacks from the major leagues. Nine 
years later, Jackie Robinson became the first black player in the majors as one 
of Rickey's Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"When he picked Jackie Robinson, he picked a dandy," Roe said. "Jackie had to 
promise to keep his mouth shut. I tell you, the fans and opposing players gave 
him the dickens. They'd holler terrible things but he just kept his mouth shut 
and played ball. He was a great ballplayer."

CROMARTIE, BATTING .439, KEEPS ORIENTAL PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
So Will Clark is batting .372 to lead the major leagues. Big deal. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Cromartie, formerly of the Montreal Expos and now star center fielder 
for Japan's favorite team, the Yomiuri Giants, can hardly remember .372. In his 
sixth and, he says, final year of playing Japanese baseball, Cromartie is 
tearing up the Central League with 25 RBI in 32 games and a .439 average. 
</P>
<P>
Cromartie said this week he isn't sure how to explain his record-breaking 
batting pace. "I'm eating the same amount of sushi that I've always eaten," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cromartie, known in Montreal for the "Cro-bar" candy bar, has adjusted better 
to the quirks and oddities of yakyu, as baseball is known here, than most 
American players. One lesson he's learned well, as he showed during an 
appearance at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan, is to restrain his 
braggadocio in favor of properly Japanese modesty. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, I don't think I'll hit .400," he said as to whether he could 
become the first in Japan to sustain a Ted Williams-like average through the 
season. "I'm a realistic person. You've got to have a lot of luck, you've got 
to stay healthy and you've got to have a bat with eyes." 
</P>
<P>
But there is no question that Cromartie, 35, has mastered the art of Japanese 
baseball. Although no one would claim the level of play here can match 
major-league ball, many American veterans -- including some who came with more 
impressive numbers than Cromartie -- have bombed out quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Cromartie said he, too, often thought he would pack it in during his first 
years in Japan. Baseball is one of America's few successful exports to Japan, 
and on the surface it looks like the same game -- but only on the surface. 
</P>
<P>
The unrelenting practices, the brutal travel schedule, the sometimes 
minor-league accommodations -- "to be honest, the first two or three years, I 
really didn't think I would make it," Cromartie said. 
</P>
<P>
He recalled the first time he took part in a game that ended in a 10-inning 
tie, a peculiarly Japanese modification in a nation where conflict is sometimes 
shunned. "I couldn't deal with that," he said. "Even with marbles, we always 
had a winner." 
</P>
<P>
In this cramped nation, Cromartie recalled hotels where he would put his foot 
in the toilet as he exited the shower. "You've got to think small at times," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And Cromartie recalled some of the foreigner's difficulties such as the 
pitchers who throw around him, or at him, but rarely challenge him. He recalled 
the season-ending day when Japanese pitchers walked Randy Bass four times 
rather than give him a chance to break the season home-run record set by 
national idol Sadaharu Oh. 
</P>
<P>
And he remembered the many gaijin, or foreign players, he has seen come and go, 
frustrated by the regimented practices, the language barrier, the cautious 
style of team-oriented play. 
</P>
<P>
"Some do fight it, and the ones who do fight it are no longer here," he said, 
explaining the secret of his success. "The ones who don't fight it seem to 
stick around longer." 
</P>
<P>
Cromartie has now been here longer than any active gaijin except Greg "Boomer" 
Wells, who played briefly for Minnesota and Toronto before coming here in 1983, 
one year before Cromartie. Unlike many major-leaguers, Cromartie came here in 
his prime, after eight years in Montreal. "I haven't played in the States yet," 
he joked. 
</P>
<P>
After batting .280 in 1984, Cromartie has kept his average above .300, with a 
high of .363 in 1986. But last year he broke his thumb and missed most of the 
season. Back in the United States, Cromartie trained hard, he said, for what he 
says will be his last year before retiring to devote more time to his life as a 
drummer and lyricist. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just riding a good wave right now," he said. "I'm trying to go back where 
I started: trying to have fun."

UMPIRES SAY THE DAYS OF TENNIS BRATS OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Tennis has cleaned up its act. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are the ugly days of the spitting, racket-bashing, tantrum-throwing brats. 
</P>
<P>
That's the verdict of the men charged with restoring decorum to the courts: the 
chair umpires. 
</P>
<P>
The officials, once the main target of the abuse, say the new climate is due to 
improved umpiring and line-calling, the enforcement of code-of-conduct 
regulations and the emergence of a new generation of better-behaved players. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't see the real blowups on the court which tennis was famous for four 
and five years ago," said Richard Ings, a 24-year-old Australian who is one of 
the six full-time umpires on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some players who won't say 'boo' and will accept any decision," he 
said during a break at the Italian Open. "And there are some players who have a 
reputation as being difficult. But there are no more players going crazy every 
match. I think that everyone would accept that things are much quieter these 
days." 
</P>
<P>
Luigi Brambilla, the chief umpire at the Italian Open, credits both the players 
and the officials for the revival of tennis etiquette. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no more outrageous conduct because both the officiating and the 
behavior of the players have improved tremendously," said the 57-year-old 
Brambilla, who has umpired at nine U.S. Opens and eight French Opens. "The 
players recognize now that the umpires and the linesmen are much better and 
there is no more room for bad behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"I've umpired three generations in tennis, starting with (Rod) Laver, (Cliff) 
Drysdale and (Ilie) Nastase, then onto (Jan) Kodes, (Vitas) Gerulaitis and the 
young (Jimmy) Connors, and now (Andre) Agassi. The second generation is almost 
finished. The new generation knows the officials and realizes there is no sense 
to complain." 
</P>
<P>
The players were on their best behavior during the two weeks of the Italian 
Open, a tournament which has had some famous incidents over the years, 
including the expulsion a few years ago of Argentina's Jose Luis Clerc for 
vehemently protesting during a doubles match. 
</P>
<P>
There were contested calls throughout the tournament, sometimes forcing the 
umpire to climb down from his chair and examine the mark himself. But there 
were no protracted arguments, as the players invariably accepted the call and 
returned to position for the next point. 
</P>
<P>
Alberto Mancini didn't so much as blink when French umpire Bruno Rebeuh gave 
him a warning for receiving coaching from the stands and later assessed him a 
penalty point for kicking his racket after an error. Even though the penalty 
cost him a crucial game, the unruffled Argentine went on to beat Andre Agassi 
in a five-set final. 
</P>
<P>
In order to combat the rash of incidents that were giving the sport a bad name, 
the Men's Tennis Council in 1985 instituted a system of full-time certified 
chair umpires to officiate at all major Grand Prix tournaments around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
There are currently six MTC umpires: Ings, Rebeuh, Gerald Armstrong of England, 
Rudy Berger of West Germany, American Richard Kaufman and Paulo Pereira of 
Brazil. They each officiate 32 weeks of tennis a year, working the four Grand 
Slam events together and splitting up the others. At least two are on hand at 
each tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Before you often had an umpire doing just one tournament a year," said Ings, 
who was hired at the age of 21 and has umpired more than 1,000 matches in the 
three years since then. "That led to a lot of cronyism. That doesn't exist any 
more." 
</P>
<P>
The umpires have code-of-conduct rules to help them keep the peace on the 
court. Under the system, a player receives a warning for a first violation, is 
penalized a point for the second infraction, loses a game for the third and 
forfeits the match on the fourth. About a third of the code violations result 
in fines, which range from a few hundred dollars to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The code-of-conduct is not designed as punishment," Ings said. "It helps to 
control the match." 
</P>
<P>
It's not always sweetness and light, though. At the Indian Wells tournament in 
March, Ings defaulted Robert Seguso for his behavior during a match against 
Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
"Incidents like those are far and few between, but it's still not roses every 
day," Ings said. "We still have good times and bad times. It's a job that 
involves making instantaneous decisions. There are always big points in a 
match, so you're going to get a reaction from a player. You just have to accept 
that it's impossible to make a decision that makes everybody happy." 
</P>
<P>
The umpires prefer not to discuss the behavior of individual players. 
</P>
<P>
"We try not to categorize the players at all," Ings said. "You don't want to 
have pre-conceived ideas. A guy with a bad reputation can be really nice, and a 
guy with a good reputation can get out of the wrong side of the bed once in a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
Working full-time, the umpires say, allows them to establish a professional 
on-court relationship with the players. 
</P>
<P>
"We see them week in and week out," Ings said. "We know them and we know how 
they react. And they get to know how we work. They know they can't get away 
with certain things. That professional familiarity makes our job a lot easier." 
</P>
<P>
For obvious reasons, the umpires are forbidden from socializing with the 
players off the court. 
</P>
<P>
"Saying hello is okay, but you could never umpire a guy who was your friend," 
Berger said. "And if you did, you'd probably be enemies the next day."

DAN PINTO'S RECOVERY FROM NEAR-FATAL ACCIDENT CULMINATES IN ONE OF TOP JC VAULT 
MARKS IN STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
October, 1987. Dan Pinto drifts in and out of consciousness in the emergency 
room at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, his head and back aflame 
with pain. In a moment of clarity, he can make out the sorrowful faces peering 
down at him. Sisters and brothers he hasn't seen for a while. Other members of 
his Granada Hills family. And the face of a stranger, a priest, giving him last 
rites. 
</P>
<P>
March, 1989. Pinto stares down the runway during warm-ups for a track meet at 
Santa Monica City College. He rolls the shaft of a fiberglass pole in his 
hands, then he barrels toward the pit, plants the pole and clears 14 feet. The 
vault itself isn't remarkable -- or even better than his high school best -- 
but to Pinto and those who know him, it confirms a remarkable fact: 18 months 
after a devastating accident, Pinto is alive and well and, incredibly, vaulting 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty amazing he can even walk, let alone pole vault," says Fred De La 
Vega, Pinto's track coach at College of the Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
After a drunken driver plowed into Pinto's motorcycle and dragged him 165 feet, 
there was doubt whether he would even live. The back of his head was crushed, 
his brain was hemorrhaging, his back was broken and his left knee "was 
destroyed," Pinto says. During rehabilitation, he says, "Two of my eight 
doctors said I wouldn't be able to play any sport again. And they still don't 
think it's a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
But Pinto, the youngest of six children, had two things going for him at the 
time of the accident: He was young (19 then) and he was in excellent shape 
because of a six-hour-a-day training regimen. Like most head-trauma patients, 
however, his comeback would be frustrating, painful and measured in agonizing 
fractions. 
</P>
<P>
Pinto was driving south on Sepulveda Boulevard returning from the '87 
homecoming football game at Alemany High, his alma mater. He was on a new Ninja 
1000. "It was so beautiful, and I was so cool, not wearing my helmet," he says 
with sarcasm. He pulled into the left-turn lane and stopped to let oncoming 
traffic go by so he could turn on Mayall Street. But the driver of the Ford 
Bronco behind him kept going and "went right over me," Pinto says. The driver 
-- convicted twice previously of drunken driving -- had a blood-alcohol level 
that was twice the legal limit, Pinto says. 
</P>
<P>
Pinto spent more than a month in the hospital. His weight dropped from 160 
pounds to 125. He had searing headaches and petit mal seizures. He couldn't 
sleep. His speech, memory and learning ability were impaired. He was trussed up 
in braces "from head to toe" and couldn't walk if he wanted to. His hand-eye 
coordination was severely reduced. 
</P>
<P>
"In therapy they had me make these little models that a kid should have been 
able to do," Pinto says. "I hated it. It was so frustrating. I couldn't do it. 
I couldn't even remember a single-sentence direction." 
</P>
<P>
Six months after the accident, Pinto was discharged from physical therapy and 
was able to get around without braces. "They were restrictive, uncomfortable 
and embarrassing when people backed up behind you on the stairs," he says. 
Nearly a year after the priest performed the last rites, Pinto signed up for 
classes at COC despite lingering physical and mental problems. His equilibrium 
was affected if he stood up quickly and his memory was still faulty. 
</P>
<P>
"In class, it was hard to get the information from the board to my notebook," 
he says, "but all my professors were very understanding." 
</P>
<P>
Even today -- although he has a 3.2 grade-point average -- thoughts don't flow 
spontaneously and he often has to search for the right word in conversations. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually have to think ahead on what to say," he says. "And it takes more 
time and patience to study." 
</P>
<P>
During the early days of his recovery, Pinto would often have vivid, surreal 
dreams about pole vaulting. It had been his event ever since his freshman year 
at Alemany. 
</P>
<P>
"My coaches reeled me in and said 'You're just going to pole vault,' " Pinto 
says, referring to Alemany track coaches Randy Smith and Dave Carlson (who 
helped coach him at COC this year). In Pinto's junior year, he won the Southern 
Section 2-A Division championship with a vault of 14-6. 
</P>
<P>
Despite discouragement from his doctors, Pinto walked into De La Vega's office 
last spring and signed up for the track team. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew what he did in high school and I knew about the accident, but I didn't 
know the details," De La Vega says. Pinto was purposely evasive about the 
severity of his injuries. "I didn't want Fred to mother me," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But once De La Vega found out, "I was really careful with him," he says. Which 
upset Pinto. "Fred is an L. A. County fireman and he knows all about the kind 
of injuries I had," Pinto says, "so he started mothering me, cutting back on 
practice, things like that. We had a conflict but it blew over fast. Fred just 
had to let me be me." 
</P>
<P>
Once Pinto began working out at the track, he was surprised at how quickly 
everything came back. "It was like riding a bike," he says. But he didn't try 
his first vault until the meet in Santa Monica. "I felt good," he says, his 
soft voice filled with enthusiasm. "Nothing hurt. I put it up and went over. 
It's just in my blood." 
</P>
<P>
How far has he come back? A few weeks ago, he vaulted 15 feet, which was the 
fourth best junior college vault in the state this year. Although he didn't 
qualify for the state JC championships ("Pole vaulting is a head-trip sport," 
he says, "and I put too much pressure on myself."), he feels he can clear 16 
feet by the end of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
De La Vega concurs. "I think he really can," the coach said, "but he's got to 
work on two or three mechanical things." 
</P>
<P>
Pinto says that his accident has given him a deeper appreciation and 
understanding of life. "Even as bad as I was, I was the most fortunate person 
in my head-trauma class," Pinto says. To give something back, he is considering 
changing his major from economics to special education. 
</P>
<P>
Pinto, who has been invited to vault for a U. S. team at a meet in Tahiti this 
summer, plans to attend a four-year college -- possibly USC or Cal State 
Northridge -- and "become an NCAA champion." 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the 1992 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be in my athletic prime then," he says, adding, "I set extremely high 
goals for myself." 
</P>
<P>
Anybody else with such large dreams would be considered a cockeyed optimist 
but, as Pinto showed in the emergency room, he can't be counted out.

TECHNOLOGY HAS DOMINATED INDY IN '80S 
</P>

INDIANAPOLIS

<TEXT>
<P>
The Indianapolis 500 began the 1980s in turmoil and controversy, moved into an 
unprecedented era of high technology and corporate sponsorship and approached 
the end of the decade with no apparent end to the ever-increasing speeds. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the old guard that had dominated Indy-car racing since the 1960s 
remained competitive, but a younger crop emerged and Rick Mears became the 
focus of the most successful Indy team in history. 
</P>
<P>
Safer, more competitive racing was a byproduct of the improvements, notably the 
crash-worthy chassis designs and more efficient engines. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing is high technology, the carbon fiber tubs . . . basically 
the '80s stuff, the age of technology," says Bobby Unser, who began his career 
in the front-engine roadsters of the 1960s and ended it as a three-time winner 
in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"This doesn't mean it's going to stop (in the 1990s), but probably the biggest 
gains, the biggest changes can be attributed to technology which has never 
before been available," Unser said. "All of a sudden, the cars were jumping in 
speed. And for a while, they didn't know why." 
</P>
<P>
The last time a car took the pole position at Indianapolis with under a 
200-m.p.h. average was 1980, when Johnny Rutherford went on to win the 500 for 
the third time. The speeds have climbed dramatically ever since, with Mears 
winning the pole this year at record speeds of 224.254 m.p.h. for one lap and 
223.885 m.p.h. for four laps. 
</P>
<P>
But you can't isolate speed without considering safety, says Unser, noting the 
seeming paradox of faster speeds with fewer dangers. The technology that 
produced the speed, he said, has "also done the same thing for safety." 
</P>
<P>
"That's come right along with it. There are more good fuel cells and breakaway 
fittings which have almost completely stopped fire (in a crash). Fire is 
practically non-existent in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
"Then they went through a siege of drivers hurting their feet and legs, but the 
design (of the newer cars) has taken that away. They've gained quite a bit in 
safety. Today, cars are so much safer than they were in the '70s or '60s or 
'50s." 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen drivers were killed in practice or the race from 1953-73. Since then, 
only one, Gordon Smiley in 1982, has died at the Speedway. And that death was 
due to the nearly head-on angle of impact into the wall, not the speed. 
</P>
<P>
"Racing made a big gain in the '80s," Unser continued. "It became a more 
internationally, and without a doubt nationally, accepted sport. It's gone like 
a forest fire out of control. It's really been the sport of the '80s. It's 
surpassed every other sport in growth." 
</P>
<P>
That seemed remote as the decade began amid a civil war between the U.S. Auto 
Club, the sanctioning body for Indy-car racing since the mid-1950s, and the 
breakaway Championship Auto Racing Teams, which was formed in late 1978 in a 
dispute over control of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
CART, whose members included the sport's top drivers and car owners, claimed 
USAC had not given them sufficient input in making the rules that affected 
their livelihood. For a while, the two groups banded together under the banner 
of the Championship Racing League. But the the truce dissolved in 1980, and 
USAC's influence in Indy-car racing quickly dwindled to only the Indianapolis 
500. 
</P>
<P>
CART, which now sanctions every other Indy-car race, has turned the sport into 
an estimated $400 million annual business enterprise, and attendance has 
increased each of the past seven years to more than 2.6 million spectators at 
last year's 14 CART events. 
</P>
<P>
"John Frasco (CART chairman) came along at a good time for CART. He probably 
has done more for motor racing than any other man in history," said Unser. 
"CART has been very good for the sport, not because it whipped USAC -- it's not 
that at all -- but because it was just time for a change. 
</P>
<P>
"CART was able to make it a bigger sport. USAC wasn't ready to grow with it. 
They're a good organization but they got stuck in the mud, not willing to 
change," he said. "Frasco was able to look far, far above it." 
</P>
<P>
The most dominant driver of the 1980s at Indianapolis has been Mears, the only 
one to win the 500 more than once since 1978. Starting with 1979, in Mears' 
second race at the Speedway, he has won three times, finished second once and 
third twice. He has started from the front row eight times and has captured the 
pole position a record-tying four times. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Mears earned a record $804,000 for the Penske Racing team from the 
first $5 million purse in auto racing history. It also was a record seventh 
victory for car owner Roger Penske, the sixth since Mears first won in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Penske also was the owner of Unser's winning car in 1981, although it took more 
than four months before he could celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
The 1981 race marked the most controversial running of the 500 because of 
Unser's illegal passing of eight cars as he exited the pits under the yellow 
caution flag. The next morning, after a protest by second-place Mario Andretti, 
USAC announced a one-lap penalty and reversed the order of finish. 
</P>
<P>
But Unser appealed the penalty, and four months later, a special USAC panel 
restored Unser's victory. 
</P>
<P>
Andretti's frustrations at Indy continued throughout the decade, including the 
very next year when a pace-lap crash took him and three other drivers out of 
the race. A bitter Andretti blamed Kevin Cogan, whose car veered to the right, 
crashed and bounced back in front of Andretti as the cars approached the 
starting line. 
</P>
<P>
Cogan, meanwhile, another young driver whose entire Indy experience has been in 
the 1980s, was second four years later in the closest 1-2-3 finish in Indy 
history. He was apparently locked into first place with two laps to go under 
the yellow light. But when the green light came on, Bobby Rahal rocketed past 
him and won by 1.4 seconds. Mears, who lost to Gordon Johncock by .16 second in 
1982 -- the closest 1-2 finish in history -- was another .4 second behind Cogan 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Cogan says the 1980s will be remembered primarily for two things: 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing, the most important, is ground effects," he said of the 
aerodynamic designs which keep the cars virtually glued to the track and allow 
them to go through the corners at almost straightaway speed. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1980, probably less than an eighth of the cars had ground effects. My first 
year (1981), it was maybe half the field. By 1982, if you didn't have ground 
effects, you didn't race,' said Cogan. 
</P>
<P>
"The No. 2 thing would be the dominance of the Cosworth, then falling away at 
the end of the '80s," he said of the engine that replaced the once-dominant 
Offenhauser. 
</P>
<P>
The famed four-cylinder Offenhauser, which powered 31 Indy 500 winners from 
1934-76 faded in the early 1980s as the smaller, lighter, more powerful and 
more easily turbocharged eight-cylinder Cosworth came into favor. 
</P>
<P>
The Cosworth developed higher horsepower and faster speeds than the Offy, but 
by the mid-to-late '80s, even the Cosworth was being challenged, primarily by 
the Chevy Indy V8, which won 14 of the 15 Indy-car races in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a developmental thing," Cogan said. "Cosworth hadn't changed much. 
The Chevy group of guys were with Cosworth originally, and they knew how to 
improve the engine. But to do it, they had to do it from scratch, and it had 
some bugs." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the decade, only Unser was missing from the group that had 
dominated the sport for so long. His brother, Al Unser, won his fourth Indy 500 
in 1987, subbing on the Penske team for an injured Danny Ongais. A.J. Foyt, who 
became the first four-time winner in 1977, also was still active, as were 
Rutherford, Andretti and Gordon Johncock. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Simon, who in 1988 became the oldest known Indy 500 driver at age 54, says 
he has seen in the '80s "a tremendous marketing tool become available to 
corporations." 
</P>
<P>
"What that has created is additional funds to racing, and in doing so, it has 
created tremendously competitive teams and cars," Simon said. "Now, instead of 
four or five people that can vie for the front row, you've got probably 15 
people here that can qualify for that front row. 
</P>
<P>
"It has evened out the competition a lot," he said. "The competitors, March, 
Lola, Penske and a few of the other people that have come in with engines and 
things are making it very, very highly professional. Not that it wasn't 
professional before, but it's making it possible, through the marketing, I'd 
say, for other teams to come up with a little bit more money and start matching 
the test and development dollars and equipment."

<P>
It's May, 1999, and 64-year-old A.J. Foyt has just qualified his Nissan-powered 
Penske PC28 for the 83rd Indianapolis 500 at a record four-lap average of 
253.335 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
It is Foyt's record 42nd consecutive race, but age doesn't matter since drivers 
long ago ceased to do anything but aim the cars on the 2 1/2-mile oval. Racing 
is done by on-board computer. 
</P>
<P>
The Indianapolis Motor Speedway now has 400,000 seats, the grandstands circling 
the track both inside and out. Major sponsors have placed billboards around 
most of what used to be bare, white concrete walls lining the oval. 
</P>
<P>
The 33 race starters will share a $15 million purse, with the winner of the 
500-mile race taking home $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Don't laugh. It's all possible; some of it even likely. 
</P>
<P>
As the 1990s approach, the catchwords in Indy-car racing are technology, 
aerodynamics, telemetry and corporate. 
</P>
<P>
The cars have become more sleek, slick and quick than ever before. And many in 
the Indy-car community say it's only the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the increase in technology in the '80s, it's pretty amazing 
to see where we have come to in just the last few years," said 1983 
Indianapolis winner Tom Sneva. 
</P>
<P>
"But really, there's no end in sight," he said. "When you talk about 
technology, you're talking about something that's pretty much infinite. 
Whatever you can think of can eventually be done." 
</P>
<P>
If, as Sneva says, speed is the byproduct of advancing technology, then more 
speed is in Indy's future. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Hurtubise was the fast qualifer in 1960 with a four-lap record of 149.056. 
By the end of that decade, the record was 171.559, set by Joe Leonard In 1968. 
</P>
<P>
The '70s saw the speeds accelerate even more, leaping to 202.156 by Sneva in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
The '80s were notable for the improvements through ground effects aerodynamics, 
radial tires, safety through carbon fiber construction and the introduction of 
computers in monitoring a variety of on-board systems, including the 
electronics and fuel. 
</P>
<P>
The inevitable and dramatic result of all that technology has been the biggest 
escalation of speed yet, with five-time pole-winner Rick Mears setting a 
four-lap Speedway record of 223.885 mph with a fast lap of 224.254 in 
qualifications this year. 
</P>
<P>
Another inevitable product of the technological advancement of the '80s has 
been the addition of a new member to Indy-car teams -- the engineer. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, what we're doing now is testing the limits of our abilities to make 
the car go fast," said Nigel Bennett, a car designer and engineer for Penske 
Racing, easily the most successful team of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Computers have cut the time it takes to design a car in half. That leaves more 
time for research, testing and refining the cars." 
</P>
<P>
"Basically," Bnnett added. "the cars are going faster because they stick to the 
track better. In simple terms, we've taken the design of an airplane wing and 
turned it upside down. The lift that helps an airplane take off is instead used 
to push the car down on the track by creating downforce rather than lift. 
</P>
<P>
"We're attaining straightaway speeds over 230 m.p.h., and every airplane I know 
of can take off at 230 miles an hour." 
</P>
<P>
The sanctioning bodies -- the U.S. Auto Club, which sanctions the Indy 500, and 
Championship Auto Racing Teams, which oversees the rest of the Indy-car series 
-- have made periodic rule changes in an attempt to slow the cars down, or at 
least to keep them from going even faster. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller aerodynamic wings; less air pressure, also known as boost, for the 
turbochargers and other changes have been almost momentary impediments for the 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, there are ways of slowing the cars down, but eventually the engineers 
and engine-builders find ways of overcoming the rules," says Bobby Rahal, the 
1986 Indy winner. "And it doesn't take them very long, either." 
</P>
<P>
Foyt, the only driver to race at Indianapolis in four different decades, isn't 
awed or frightened by change. "When I came here (1958), we were driving 
roadsters, the fast speeds were under 150 and a lot of guys either got killed 
or retired young," Foyt said. "Now we're driving these things over 200 and 
they're good, stable, safe race cars. Hell, they'll even be better 10 years 
from now and maybe I'll be racing one."

CLU'S BLUHM 8TH IN NAIA 400 FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Susan Bluhm of Cal Lutheran placed eighth in the 400-meter final at the NAIA 
track championships Saturday at Azusa Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Bluhm, a junior, finished in a time of 58.40 seconds, nearly two seconds off 
her school-record time of 56.85, set two weeks ago at the District 3 
championships at Point Loma Nazarene. 
</P>
<P>
"She had a great season," Cal Lutheran women's track Coach Hector Nieves said. 
"She surpassed all of our expectations all season long. It's nice seeing her 
achieve up to her potential." 
</P>
<P>
Darren Bernard, who placed fifth in the 400 in the national championships last 
year, failed to advance to the final this weekend. The sophomore placed fifth 
in his semifinal heat Friday in a time of 48.27, but only the top four 
qualified for the final. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal Lutheran women's team finished in a tie for 53rd place and the men's 
team placed 59th in the team standings.

REYES TWITCHES QUICKEST, WINS A PAIR OF SPRINT TITLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange Glen's Glen Reyes was talking about "quick-twitch muscles" after his 
performances in the 100 and 200 meters during Saturday's San Diego Section 
track and field finals at Poway High. 
</P>
<P>
But it was more than a twitch that helped him make up three strides on 
front-runner Kiyoshi Moody of Castle Park in the final 30 meters of the 100 to 
win in 10.79. Moody was clocked at 10.81. 
</P>
<P>
And it was more than a twitch that gave Reyes the lead in the 200 coming out of 
the turn and allowed him to cruise to the finish in 21.47, a 1989 section best. 
</P>
<P>
"I stopped training with weights a couple weeks ago because my muscles were 
getting heavy and strong, but not quick," Reyes said. "Now I'm starting to do 
drills to work on my quick-twitch muscles." The drills, Reyes explained, have 
been designed by Dr. Michael Yessis, a bio-mechanical expert who is fluent in 
Russian and has studied and translated Soviet training manuals. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got calls from Knoxville, Tenn., from USA Today; reporters doing stories 
on Dr. Yessis asking me if he's done anything for me," Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
The answer is evident, especially considering that Moody was the favorite in 
the 100. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes also finished third in the long jump at 22-feet-7 1/4 behind Jerome Price 
of University City (24-6 1/4, season best) and Tom Brown of Castle Park (23-5 
3/4). 
</P>
<P>
Three events, two firsts. Not bad, unless of course one compares that against 
the accomplishments of San Pasqual's Francis O'Neill. O'Neill also entered 
three events -- the 800, 1,600 and 3,200 meters -- and won each. 
</P>
<P>
Other big winners included Brent Noon, the top finisher in both the discus and 
shotput; sophomore Eric Bell, who came from behind to edge Mario O'Conner of 
Escondido and Poway's Jeff Haines in the 110 high hurdles, and Granite Hills 
pole vaulter Brian Chase. 
</P>
<P>
The boys' team champion was Fallbrook with 51 points. Orange Glen was right 
behind with 50. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill, who ran 5,600 meters and claimed his three titles in the span of two 
hours, finished the 800 in 1:52.40, the 1,600 in 4:14.09 and the 3,200 in 
9:19.72. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, Noon set another personal best. Unexpectedly, however, it did not 
come in the shotput. Noon's discus throw of 185-4 was 4-9 better than his 
previous county best. In the shot, Noon's top effort traveled 66-7, well below 
his national best of 69-8 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Noon was pestered as to whether he is placing too much pressure on 
himself to reach 70-0; he got his 69-8 1/4 on May 5, Fallbrook's last dual 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
"No," he answered, "because I feel I'm on track for next week (at the state 
meet in Cerritos)." 
</P>
<P>
Bell was a surprise in 110 high hurdles. Besides being a sophomore, he was the 
second-to-last qualifier at last week's preliminaries with a time of 15.33. 
Saturday he ran a county season best 14.55 into a slight head wind. 
</P>
<P>
"The coaches and I, we all knew I could do it," Bell said. "It was just a 
matter of concentrating and just getting over the hurdles." 
</P>
<P>
Chase's new county best in the vault is 15-5. "I had a good, tall takeoff and 
made it pretty easy," said Chase, who also spoke of difficulties at lower 
heights. "I had three attempts before I made 14-4. I was getting a little 
nervous there."

JORGENSEN FINISHES IN STYLE

<P>
There were no tears Saturday from Rancho Buena Vista's Kira Jorgensen, who 
ended her illustrious high school track career in San Diego County with two 
more vintage runaway victories. 
</P>
<P>
But there was definitely cause for an emotional outburst. As she came down the 
stretch in the 3,200, which she won for the fourth consecutive year, Jorgensen 
was given a standing ovation by the crowd at Poway High. 
</P>
<P>
"That was awesome," said Jorgensen, will finish her high school track career 
next weekend at the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
In winning the 3,200 (10:55.59) and her third consecutive 1,600 (4:59.76), 
Jorgensen ran as she has most of her prep career -- alone. She beat the 
second-place finisher, which in both races happened to be teammate Mira 
Hornbacher, by 19 seconds in the 3,200 and 3.3 seconds in the 1,600. 
</P>
<P>
Still Jorgensen was not completely pleased with her races. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to run a little faster to get better seeds at state," Jorgensen said. 
"But no matter how fast I ran, it would have been a bummer because it was the 
last race. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Jorgensen finished with a 59-second anchor on RBV's fourth-place mile 
relay team. 
</P>
<P>
Jorgensen was almost upstaged by a couple of outstanding performances by Poway 
junior hurdler Kim Dill and Serra freshman sprinter Angela Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
Dill won the 100 and 300 low hurdles, and Sullivan won the 100 and 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Dill topped surprising San Pasqual freshman Erin Blunt in both races. In the 
100, she expected a challenge from San Pasqual's Cathy Stark, who finished 
third. 
</P>
<P>
"She's always wanted to beat me," said Dill, who finished in 14.29 to Blunt's 
14.92. "When she was next to me, I was scared to death." 
</P>
<P>
In the 300, Dill said she was scared to death of Mt. Carmel's Casandra Tyson, 
who came in with the fastest qualifying time. Dill took the lead early and 
never faltered; Tyson fell just yards from the finish and did not qualify for 
the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a shocking day," Dill said. 
</P>
<P>
It was even moreso for Sullivan, who ran a section best 11.98 into a slight 
wind to beat Hilltop's Francine Wada (12.18) in the 100. In the 200, she dusted 
University City's Angela Kimmey by almost a full second, 24.51 to 25.20. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to qualify for state," Sullivan said. "In a way, this is a 
surprise." 
</P>
<P>
There was no big surprise in the 400-meter relay, which Morse won for the 11th 
consecutive year. Senior Nicola Stennis and sophomores Ayanda Bennett, Sharon 
Russell and Nichella Milner easily beat Mt. Carmel, 47.33 to 47.49. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual won the team title with 50 points, Mt. Carmel had 49 and Rancho 
Buena Viosta 45 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford City junior Shani Freeman ran a meet record 55.19 in the 400 to beat 
Mt. Carmel freshman Allison Dring (56.44). The two were virtually even as they 
came around the final turn, but Freeman had much more left and won by 10 yards. 
Freeman, who was ineligible last year in post-season, said Dring was her 
motivation. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to get beat by a freshman," she said. "I conserved myself in the 
middle, because wanted to make sure I had some left at the end." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry's Rochelle Johnson was the outstanding girls' field competitor, 
winning the triple jump (39-8 1/4) and taking second in the long jump (17-10 
1/4).

Monte Vista felt confident going into Saturday's San Diego Section 3-A softball 
championship game, and with good reason. The Monarchs had been defeated only 
once this season and are led by one of the top pitchers in the county. 
</P>
<P>
But in the fifth inning of a scoreless game, Coach Charlie Costello said he and 
his team began to feel the pressure. And it wasn't until the top of the 10th 
that Monte Vista scored to defeat Mt. Miguel, 1-0, for the title. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont edged USDHS, 2-1, for the 2-A title, and Bishop's defeated Mountain 
Empire, 1-0, in 1-A. 
</P>
<P>
"They stuck with it," Costello said. "They've been under pressure all year 
being undefeated, being No. 1 and not wanting to lose." The Monarchs, who 
finished 25-1, suffered their only loss to El Capitan in the final 
regular-season game. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs loaded the bases in the ninth, and although they did not score, 
Costello said that was when they felt they would win. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the bases were loaded, we knew," said leadoff hitter Kristy Howard. "It's 
contagious once the momentum gets going." 
</P>
<P>
In the 10th, Lisa Wall singled. After Jeanine Williams' flyout, Lynn Darnell 
bunted Wall to third. After Kristy Howard grounded out, sister Kelly drove in 
Wall with the winning run. Kelly Howard finished three for five. 
</P>
<P>
"(Mt. Miguel) was flying high after we had the bases loaded and didn't score, 
but we came back and held them," Costello said. "The run came at the most 
convenient time, two runners on and two outs." 
</P>
<P>
Only once this season had Monte Vista gone into extra innings. Pitcher Suzy 
Lawrence (19-1), who struck out seven, said she didn't even realize how many 
innings the game had lasted when it was over. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to concentrate. I just wanted our team to score," Lawrence said. 
"When I was a sophomore, I pitched 19 innings, so I was thinking how I handled 
it back then. I started getting a little tired, but I overcame it." 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Miguel pitcher Burna Cloyd used a strong wind to her advantage, frustrating 
Monte Vista batters and earning praise from Costello. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where Burna was tough," Costello said. "She was setting the ball 
outside, and I kept telling the team that, but those seasoned veterans, you 
can't change them." 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-A final, Brenna Hancock (22-4) not only led Grossmont to its first 
section title, she broke the section record for career victories with 59. 
Castle Park's Dawn Wood had tied the old record of 58 earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy that I'll be remembered for a record that now someone else has to 
break," Hancock said. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the first, Shannon Sexton hit a triple, followed up by an RBI 
single by Heather Farris to give USDHS (15-8) its only run. 
</P>
<P>
"We did battle with them and got hits off of Brenna, which not many people 
thought we would," USDHS Coach Margaret Mauro said. "I think we surprised a lot 
of people getting as far as we did in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Jolie Oliver scored both of Grossmont's runs. In the second, Michelle 
Messer hit an RBI single, and in the fourth, Heather Reynolds scored Oliver 
with a double.

'LIKE CHRISTMAS';

PHOENIX HOUSE'S DECISION ELATES NEIGHBORHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
To Janet Jackson, whose home backs up to the defunct Lake View Medical Center, 
the Saturday before Memorial Day seemed more like Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson and her Lake View Terrace neighbors fought for more than a year to 
block the proposed 210-bed Nancy Reagan Center for drug-abuse treatment and 
just when the battle seemed lost, the former First Lady on Friday backed away 
from the fight, citing the neighborhood opposition. 
</P>
<P>
And Phoenix House, the drug treatment organization that had proposed operating 
the center, quickly announced that it was pulling out of the project. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a feeling of lightness," said Jackson, 37, whose Luanda Street home 
overlooks the 14-acre former hospital property. "It's almost like 
Christmastime." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Community Amenity 
</P>
<P>
Telephones rang repeatedly Saturday as neighbors shared their elation. They 
talked excitedly about how the three-story building and its grounds might be 
transformed from a white elephant into a community amenity, such as a library, 
a senior citizens center or a theater. Others relived the battle, repeating 
arguments that the center's drug-addicted residents would have posed security 
risks to the area. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just incredible," Jackson said. "We don't know what happened, but we know 
it was a miracle here." 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood's battle had often seemed lopsided during the 13 months since 
the politically connected Phoenix House announced plans to buy and renovate the 
hospital, which had gone bankrupt in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix House had Nancy Reagan, who as First Lady had become the nation's most 
well-known drug fighter, on its side. But it also had the money and prestige of 
Hollywood, with such personages as Merv Griffin and Grant Tinker supporting the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
The racially integrated community around the hospital site -- a mixture of 
aging tract homes with barred windows and almost-new homes with good views -- 
seemed an impossibly mismatched underdog. But residents from a variety of races 
and income groups joined to fight back by lobbying Los Angeles city officials, 
community leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the immediate vicinity of the site, Phoenix House had vocal supporters, 
including City Council candidate Lyle Hall. But Lynne Cooper said opposition 
was nearly 100% in her neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the battle with Phoenix House has been won, Cooper, president of the 
Lake View Terrace Improvement Assn., one of two groups of organized homeowners 
in the community, talked about the new challenges. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got some momentum going now, and I think that will help us get a 
community center," said Cooper, 28, whose three-bedroom home overlooks the back 
of the hospital building. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt we were fighting a losing battle," said Brian Cooper, 29. "But we kept 
going." 
</P>
<P>
The homes in the Coopers' neighborhood were built between 1984 and 1986. 
Landscaping is maturing. Pools are going in. And home values have gone up 
substantially, to between $170,000 and $200,000, real estate agents and 
residents say. 
</P>
<P>
But several residents said the escalation in value nearly halted last year when 
it appeared that Phoenix House would win city approval of its plans. Although 
some residents were ready to move away anyway, Cooper said, the proposed 
drug-abuse treatment center caused them to accelerate their plans. In some 
cases, residents said, houses sold for less than they were worth as residents 
fled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Values Increase 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Russell, a real estate agent active in the neighborhood, said homes 
immediately next to the former hospital probably went up in value between 
Friday afternoon and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix House "was a barrier to getting the price that the houses were really 
worth," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Those not ready to pick up and move began taking precautions as well. Bob and 
Joycelin Furgunson moved into their Luanda Street home three weeks before 
Phoenix House officials confirmed plans to buy and renovate the property just 
beyond their back fence. 
</P>
<P>
They considered leaving, but feared that they would be unable to sell the house 
for a high enough price. So they decided to erect tall trellises, plant rose 
bushes and install an alarm system, something they had thought unnecessary in 
what appears to be a serene suburban neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"We were planning on fortifying the back yard," said Bob Furgunson, 38, a 
sculptor and artist. He said he wanted to discourage Phoenix House residents 
from coming on his property. 
</P>
<P>
The Furgunsons said they would not have opposed a center for voluntary drug 
treatment. But Phoenix House residents would have been assigned to the center 
by courts and might have tried to escape, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The Furgunsons and others insisted that their fight against Phoenix House was 
not just another case of a neighborhood resisting an idea from outside. They 
said they supported the program until they learned more about it. 
</P>
<P>
The unity formed during the fight, the residents said, will be important in 
continuing to battle drugs in the neighborhood and in fighting expansion of the 
nearby Lopez Canyon landfill. They also want to make sure that whatever is 
proposed for the former hospital site meets with the community's approval. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the community is planning a huge block party. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been promising ourselves this party for a year and a half," Lynne Cooper 
said. "We deserve it."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN KILLED BY RIFLE BELIEVED TO BE EMPTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old man was fatally shot in the Antelope Valley when a friend, who 
thought that the rifle he was playing with was empty, fired a shot at him, 
authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Robert Gladysz of La Canada Flintridge, was taken by helicopter to 
Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center in Lancaster, where he was pronounced 
dead, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Ernie Roop. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at 11:30 p.m. Friday, Roop said. Five friends from the La 
Canada Flintridge area had been drinking heavily and playing with a .22-caliber 
rifle at the Littlerock Dam Recreation Area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Drew McDonald, also 21, pointed the rifle at Gladysz and pulled 
the trigger, thinking that the gun was empty, Roop said. The single bullet hit 
Gladysz in the neck. McDonald was arrested on suspicion of involuntary 
manslaughter and taken to the Lancaster jail. Bail was set at $6,000.

200 MOURN TEEN-AGE RUSSIAN ROULETTE VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 200 mourners, including friends and relatives wearing T-shirts 
adorned with his name, said goodby Saturday to Gabriel Soto, the 13-year-old 
victim of a shooting that occurred during a one-sided version of Russian 
roulette. 
</P>
<P>
After a Mass at Our Lady of Perpetual Hope Catholic Church, the boy's body was 
buried on a windy, steep hillside at Eternal Valley Memorial Park in Newhall, 
where the crying of his family and the strains of traditional mourning songs 
were almost drowned out by noise from the Antelope Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel's mother, Olga Soto, broke down and stretched over the coffin as the 
graveside ceremony drew to a close, and mourners and pallbearers placed white 
carnations on the ground. A girl wept into a handkerchief that enfolded 
Gabriel's school photo. 
</P>
<P>
At graveside rites, Father Robert Rankin, an associate pastor at Our Lady of 
Perpetual Hope, said: "Human life in God's mind is complete, no matter how long 
it lasts." 
</P>
<P>
Olga Soto had been one of the last family members to see the boy alive, as he 
was leaving the family's small home on Arch Street near the railroad tracks in 
Newhall on Tuesday morning to visit a friend. His classes at Placerita Junior 
High School did not begin until 1 p.m. She had told him not to be late. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drawn Into Deadly Game 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel and a 14-year-old friend went to an apartment in Valencia where another 
classmate lived. Authorities believe that the third boy, also 14, drew the 
other two into a deadly game of Russian roulette, using a gun owned by his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies have said the third boy always held the 
gun, allegedly pointing it at his own head and then at the other two boys. The 
suspect pleaded not guilty Friday to a murder charge, and a June 21 hearing 
date has been set. He is being held at Sylmar Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
At his funeral, Gabriel was remembered as a fun-loving boy who joked, rode his 
bicycle around the neighborhood and played games "just like any 12- or 
13-year-old boy would do," said Francisco Orona, 17, a neighbor. "He was just 
like a little brother to all of us." 
</P>
<P>
He had had some difficulties at school, but family members said his grades were 
improving, and a special school seemed to be making a difference. His father, 
Edward Soto Sr., an auto mechanic whose specialty is electronics, said that 
Gabriel always had wanted to help him work on cars and that his son was saving 
his money to buy a motor bike. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Valenzuela, another mourner, said: "We're all like one big family" in 
the neighborhood where the Sotos have lived for 15 years. Valenzuela wore one 
of the T-shirts, which also had the date of Gabriel's death and the words "In 
Memory" across the back.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $1.4 MILLION IN CASH SEIZED; 4 ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Simi Valley police seized $1.4 million in cash and arrested four people 
Saturday after a two-week investigation of a Latin American cocaine cartel. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests began shortly after 7:30 a.m., when officers observed suspects 
loading cash into a vehicle, authorities said. Police said they followed it to 
Chatsworth, where they witnessed a financial transaction, which they would not 
describe in detail. 
</P>
<P>
Marta Urrego, 36, a Colombian citizen who lives in Chatsworth, was arrested at 
the scene, said Lt. Bob Klamser. Police confiscated three suitcases containing 
$1.4 million in the trunk of a 1988 Oldsmobile. 
</P>
<P>
Later, three other suspects were arrested at undisclosed locations in Simi 
Valley and the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested were Floriberto Urrego, 48, a Colombian living in Simi Valley; Marina 
Urrego, 36, a Colombian living in Chatsworth, and Emilza Gonsolez, 35, a 
Guatemalan living in Simi Valley. Police said the four represented Latin 
American drug buyers and handled the cash transactions with sellers. 
</P>
<P>
All were arrested on suspicion of conspiring to distribute and transport 
cocaine and launder money, Klamser said. Authorities will ask that $1 million 
bail be set for each of the suspects, who were to be taken to the Ventura 
County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of money seized is the largest in the city's history, Klamser said. 
The Ventura County district attorney's office will seek to allow Simi Valley to 
keep the money, along with three vehicles that were seized.

MORNING BRIEFING: FOOTBALL'S SANDERS IS PLAYING BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some snickered when Deion Sanders, the fifth pick in the National Football 
League draft last month, said he might play major league baseball instead of 
pro football. 
</P>
<P>
Or both. 
</P>
<P>
Like Bo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Through Friday, playing for the New York Yankees' upstate New York double-A 
team, Albany-Colonie, Sanders was hitting .294 after 30 games, had scored 25 
runs, hit one home run, driven in six runs, stolen 15 bases in 19 attempts, and 
had a .384 on-base percentage -- aided by the fact he'd been hit by pitchers 
six times. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees aren't sure what to make of their young center-field prospect, who 
played 28 games in the Yankees' system last summer, including five in triple-A. 
</P>
<P>
Is he playing minor-league baseball to get the Atlanta Falcons to pay him more 
money? The Falcons drafted him as a defensive back out of Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
Said Pete Jameson, the Yankees' assistant general manager: "Deion is getting a 
taste of pro baseball life. His approach to the game is serious. He's a capable 
double-A player who shows some major-league promise. 
</P>
<P>
"No one should compare him to Bo Jackson. He'll never hit home runs like Bo. 
He's a different kind of player. He's a much better outfielder, for one thing, 
although he doesn't have the arm Bo has." 
</P>
<P>
He's also a big winner. 
</P>
<P>
Through Friday, Albany-Colonie had a 28-8 record, the best in professional 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: The Dodgers were one of only four major league teams that opened 
the season with no rookies on their roster. Name the other three. 
</P>
<P>
Just say nyet: The USC football team will make two trips to Moscow next season. 
On Sept. 2 in the Soviet Union, the Trojans will play Illinois in the Glasnost 
Bowl. Four weeks later, they will travel to Moscow, Ida., which is just across 
the Washington/Idaho border from Pullman, Wash., where they will play 
Washington State on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Stray Bullets: The Washington Bullets were the only team in the National 
Basketball Assn. that did not have a single player who shot 50% or better from 
the floor. 
</P>
<P>
One way to look at it: Stu Inman, director of player personnel for the Miami 
Heat, which was 15-67 in its first season in the NBA, said his team enjoys a 
unique position as it looks forward to next month's draft. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the more established teams in the lottery will go for need, whereas 
we're not restricted by it," he said. "We need everything." 
</P>
<P>
Fetch the keys: Television commentator Dick Vitale doesn't believe that the 
Sacramento Kings will take Michigan's Glen Rice with the No. 1 pick in the NBA 
draft, as Bill Russell, the club's executive vice president, has suggested. 
</P>
<P>
"If Rice is in a King uniform on opening night," Vitale told USA Today, "I'll 
be Russell's personal valet and chauffeur that night and maybe get Big Bill's 
autograph. They'll either trade the pick or take (Duke's) Danny Ferry or 
(Arizona's) Sean Elliott." 
</P>
<P>
In a spin: Ron Kittle of the Chicago White Sox is 0 for 14 with 10 strikeouts 
against right-hander Mike Boddicker of the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time I faced him, I took my bats and threw them in the whirlpool," 
Kittle said. "They went around and around, but they didn't hit anything." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Boston Red Sox, the New York Yankees and the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett, who is a minority owner of the 
Miami Miracle, a Class-A baseball team that plays in the Florida State League: 
"I like the fact that it's a non-polluting industry with no tall buildings."

Chris Waddle scored midway through the first half and Steve Bull added a goal 
late in the game as England defeated Scotland, 2-0, in the 107th annual soccer 
match between the rival neighbors that was marred by fan violence at Glasgow, 
Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
Clashes between fans in and around the stadium at Hampden Park led to 96 
arrests, Glasgow police said, and at least 150 other people were arrested for 
soccer-related violence in other parts of Glasgow. 
</P>
<P>
The yearly game, oldest rivalry in international soccer, often has been the 
setting for fan violence in recent years. Police in Glasgow expected problems 
and made special plans for controlling hooliganism surrounding the game.

EXPOS DECIDE TO GO FOR BROKE WITH TRADE FOR LANGSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ross Newhan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now or never? 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the Montreal Expos to trade pitching prospects Randy Johnson, 
Brian Holman and Gene Harris for the Seattle Mariners' Mark Langston isn't a 
now or never situation, but it's close. 
</P>
<P>
Call it: Win now or, perhaps, not again in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Call it a calculated gamble -- three prospects for a proven pitcher who becomes 
a free agent at the end of the season, and had already rejected a three-year, 
$7.1 million contract from the Mariners and looms as difficult to sign for the 
Expos. 
</P>
<P>
"The bulk of our team is in its prime," Montreal Manager Buck Rodgers said. "We 
think we can win this year and felt we needed a top-line pitcher. We tried 
Holman. We tried Johnson. We felt they are still a year or two away. We felt we 
couldn't wait to break in a young pitcher with most of the team in its prime. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt we had to go out and get someone who can win now. I asked one of our 
scouts about Langston and he said that if he had his pick of five pitchers to 
start a rotation, Langston would be one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"We know he's turned down a lot of money, that he obviously thinks he's in the 
(Frank) Viola, (Roger) Clemens, (Dwight) Gooden, (Orel) Hershiser class, and he 
may very well be. We're going to try like hell to sign him. We know that with 
the money he's asking, the exchange rate and the aspect of living in a foreign 
country, the odds aren't good, but we think the chance to win outweighs the 
risk." 
</P>
<P>
The Expos have had little success in luring top line free agents across the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
They retained Tim Raines -- with help from collusion -- and lost Andre Dawson. 
They signed a quality second baseman, Dave Cash, in 1977 and pitcher Ross 
Grimsley, who went on to become the only 20-game winner in franchise history, 
in 1978. A fading Pete Rose signed for part of the 1984 season. Otherwise, the 
free agent cupboard has been filled with generics. 
</P>
<P>
Langston has already spent more than five seasons in the comparative anonymity 
of Seattle. He wants his place in the spotlight, the big market. A California 
kid accepting Montreal? 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't there anywhere else?" he reportedly asked agent Arn Tellum after the 
Mariners agreed to the Expos offer when Langston and Tellum turned down the 
$7.1 million proposition late Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers, as he said, knows the odds. 
</P>
<P>
He also knows that the potential of a Johnson, Holman and Harris often goes 
unfulfilled. He knows his fourth and fifth starters have a 1-13 record this 
year, that he has had to send Pascual Perez to the bullpen with an 0-7 record 
and that Raines will be 30 this year, Tim Wallach will be 32 and Hubie Brooks 
33. 
</P>
<P>
There is one other thing. 
</P>
<P>
He knows the New York Mets are vulnerable and the National League East is up 
for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mets are like everyone else now. They're not the super team they were two 
or three years ago," Rodgers said. "I said that in spring training and still 
believe it. They have problems like the rest of us. They can be beat, and I 
feel we can put together the club that can do that. 
</P>
<P>
The new Seattle rotation? It wasn't clear immediately, but apparently Johnson, 
the 6-foot-10 former USC left-hander who was 0-4 before being sent out by the 
Expos, and Holman, who is 1-2, will join Scott Bankhead, 2-4 entering a weekend 
series in Milwaukee, Erik Hanson (4-4) and Bill Swift (2-0) as the starters. 
That's a cumulative 9-14 and a new test for Jim Lefebvre's managerial skills. 
</P>
<P>
Just off the disabled list, his ailing hamstring still not 100%, Kirk Gibson 
agreed to move from left field to the more demanding center field for the 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Just off the disabled list, his ailing hamstring still not 100%, Eric Davis 
opted to play it safe, moving from center field to the less demanding right 
field for the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
It's a temporary transition that Davis would like to make permanent. "I'd like 
to move," he said the other day. "It would probably add another four or five 
years to my career, but I don't expect it to happen soon. If you have a real 
good center fielder, that's a rarity. And I take pride in being a real good 
center fielder." 
</P>
<P>
Walt Hrniak, who defected from the Boston Red Sox to join the Chicago White Sox 
and become baseball's highest salaried batting coach at $500,000 a year, is 
earning his pay, helping elevate the team batting average more than 25 points 
from last year's .244. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's revolving door pitching staff, however, has baseball's worst 
earned-run average, and General Manager Larry Himes refuses to use youth and 
inexperience as an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from 39-year-old Jerry Reuss, the other nine Chicago pitchers are all 29 
or younger with an average age of 25.2. Himes went on a Chicago radio show the 
other day and said eight of his 10 pitchers seemed to belong in the minors. He 
excused only Eric King and Bobby Thigpen. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting ready to wave goodby to some of these guys," Himes said. "It's 
like driving a car with four blowouts. I'm fed up and disgusted." 
</P>
<P>
Himes' comments followed a one-hour meeting with Manager Jeff Torborg in which 
they decided to demote Ken Patterson and Jose Segura and call up Jeff Bittiger 
and Jack Hardy, the 13th and 14th pitchers to appear for the Sox this year. 
</P>
<P>
Dog Days: It rained so hard Monday night in Cincinnati that it appeared that 
the Reds and St. Louis Cardinals would be unable to play. 
</P>
<P>
However, Reds management waited two hours past the scheduled start, then 
ordered the game to begin. Two innings later, the umpires ordered the field 
covered, and one hour and 15 minutes after that, at 11:25 p.m., they called it. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Magrane, the St. Louis starting pitcher, concluded that Reds owner Marge 
Schott was to blame for even thinking the game could be played. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard the phenomenon before of the master taking on the appearance of the 
dog," Magrane said, alluding to Schott and her St. Bernard, Schottzie. "That's 
already been established. But I never heard it went as far as the master taking 
on the thinking process of the dog." 
</P>
<P>
Still a thrill a minute with his erratic control, Mitch Williams has filled a 
major void for the Chicago Cubs, converting 12 of 15 save opportunities, only 
one shy of Goose Gossage's club leading total of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the National League East leaders have no regrets about the 
seven-player deal in which Rafael Palmiero went to the Texas Rangers for 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll trade zero game-winning RBIs (Palmeiro's total of last year) for 12 saves 
at this point anytime," Chicago pitching coach Dick Pohl said. "Rafael was 
cute. The female fans were upset with the trade because he was cute, but cute 
doesn't win games." 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Moyer, who went from the Cubs to the Rangers in the same deal and was 3-0 
with a 2.82 ERA in April, is 0-4 with a 6.85 ERA in five May starts and will 
try again Monday in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Those same Detroit Tigers who drove Sparky Anderson to his Thousand Oaks home 
on the brink of exhaustion are 6-1 under interim manager Dick Tracewski, who 
has an 11-2 career record replacing Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between coaching and managing, as it pertains to the media? 
</P>
<P>
"I used to say hello to everyone and they'd never answer," Tracewski said. "Now 
they want to know what color underwear I'm wearing." 
</P>
<P>
In quest of a successor to fired manager Jimy Williams, the Toronto Blue Jays 
have now interviewed Bob Bailor, manager of their Syracuse farm club; Terry 
Bevington, the White Sox first-base coach, and Lou Piniella, the former New 
York Yankee manager who now does color commentary on the Yankee cable 
telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
Piniella is the front-runner, but Yankee owner George Steinbrenner will 
reportedly demand player compensation in return for letting Piniella out of his 
contract, and during this week's series with the Angels he ordered Piniella 
onto the field to work with Yankee hitters during batting practice in what 
seemed to be a blatant attempt to show that Piniella's value to the Yankees 
extends beyond the broadcasting booth, beefing up his compensation demands. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate result was an awkward situation in which Piniella, in street 
clothes, stood on one side of the cage and hitting instructor Frank Howard, in 
uniform, stood on the other, with the players caught in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, asked about his interview by six members of the Toronto front 
office, Bailorsaid: 
</P>
<P>
"You ever see one of those Iran-Contra hearings? I felt like Oliver North. 
Every once in awhile they'd ask me a question like 'would you go fishing with 
one of your players?' 
</P>
<P>
"I think I answered, 'yes, but not all the time. It would depend on if 
something good came out of it. It would depend on who was paying for the boat 
and who was buying the beer.' " 
</P>
<P>
Offering a solution to the Blue Jay managerial situation, pitcher Mike Flanagan 
said Cito Gaston "should sign a three year deal as the interim manager. That 
would solve everything. When you get right down to it, they're all interim 
managers anyway."

The Candidate: Ballot stuffing got Oakland Athletics catcher Terry Steinbach 
and his .217 batting average into last year's All-Star game, but Steinbach has 
been a bonafide All-Star ever since. He won the Most Valuable Player Award in 
last year's game with a home run off Dwight Gooden, batted .302 over the second 
half and was hitting .346 as the A's entered a weekend series in New York. His 
composite average since last year's All-Star break: .319 with six home runs and 
50 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland Oddities: Steinbach's reversal isn't the A's only interesting twist. 
First, there's Carney Lansford, who was batting .402 last June 4, then hit .196 
over the remainder of the year to finish at .279. Lansford is on a tear again, 
batting .370 entering the weekend and .452 in May. Then there's Mark McGwire, 
who should be playing for the Chicago Cubs in Wrigley Field. McGwire, since the 
start of the 1988 season, is hitting .306 in day games and .221 in night games. 
</P>
<P>
Power Source: Minnesota Twins pitchers are doing their best to boost baseball's 
sagging home run totals. They have given up 52 in 44 games through Thursday. 
And among those who had homered off the Twins were: Jeff Kunkel, who hit three 
in three days after never hitting more than three in a season; Willie Wilson, 
who had gone a full year without one; Torey Lovullo and Joey Meyer, who have 
since been sent to the minors, and Kurt Stillwell, who bats ninth for the 
Kansas City Royals and hit two in the same game. 
</P>
<P>
Great Scott: The Houston Astros' Mike Scott has won six of his last seven 
decisions with the Pittsburgh Pirates after going 0-8 against them. Scott 
pointed out that Willie Stargell and Dave Parker are now gone and that he is a 
different pitcher as well. Said Andy Van Slyke, who is one for 32 against 
Scott: "It's a good thing he wasn't born triplets or I'd be pumping gas at 
(teammate) Glenn Wilson's station." ROSS NEWHAN

GIBSON GIVES DODGERS DEPTH THAT WEST RIVALS LACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kirk Gibson's left hamstring is still not 100%. Mike Marshall has stiffness in 
his lower back. Eddie Murray's bat has been ailing some lately. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Dodgers -- in an important way -- appear healthier in the middle of the 
lineup than any of the National League West's other viable contenders. 
</P>
<P>
All have demonstrated a need for the protective depth Gibson restores to the 
heart of the Dodger order, the type of depth that pressures an opposing pitcher 
to deal with each hitter in the middle of the lineup and relieves the pressure 
felt by an unprotected hitter trying to do too much. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco Giants covet a No. 5 hitter for protection behind Will Clark 
and Kevin Mitchell. The San Diego Padres could use one behind Jack Clark. The 
Houston Astros need one behind Glenn Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Need to the extent that Astro General Manager Bill Wood questions whether his 
team can win without one, a feeling shared, in part, by Giant President Al 
Rosen. 
</P>
<P>
The Cincinnati Reds, with Kal Daniels recently replacing Eric Davis on the 
disabled list, haven't been able to go with a set lineup often enough to 
determine if Todd Benzinger and Paul O'Neill represent adequate protection. 
</P>
<P>
Weighed against the injuries to Davis and Daniels, the uncertainty surrounding 
Manager Pete Rose and the combined 7-11 record of Danny Jackson and Tom 
Browning, who were 41-13 last year, the Reds' strong start -- they are eight 
games over .500 and leading the division -- may indicate a new maturity. 
</P>
<P>
For the Giants, Padres and Astros, manpower is the issue. Their stories are 
strikingly similar. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Giants: When batting fifth, behind Clark and Mitchell, Candy Maldonado 
and Ernest Riles hit two home runs and were batting a cumulative .224 through 
Friday. Maldonado was 4 for 35 with runners in scoring position and batting 
.194 as the No. 5 hitter. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of protection -- the Giants had also used eight players in the No. 
6 spot in the lineup and seven in the No. 7 -- has had a significant impact on 
Clark and Mitchell, who leads the league with 14 homers and 43 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, when Mitchell drove in 80 runs but missed 24 games with injuries, 
Clark led the league in walks. Pitchers simply took their chances with whoever 
was batting behind him. Now, with Mitchell healthy and on a roll, Clark is not 
even in the top 10 in walks. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, getting his pitches, he is leading the league in hitting. Mitchell, 
the clean-up hitter, is being pitched around, as illustrated by seven walks in 
the last nine games, a pace that could continue unless Maldonado and Riles do 
something about it. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been fortunate in that the first four spots in our lineup have been very 
productive," Rosen said, "but we aren't getting the production from the bottom 
of the order that's so important if you're going to win. Had we received the 
production we expected, we would have won five or six more games, and that's 
very frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
"We keep looking for the Maldonado of two years ago. He has nine or 10 RBIs and 
it's difficult to remember any of them. But I'm sure he's as frustrated as 
management is. What happens, as everyone who has played knows, is that you get 
so mentally down that it's difficult to go to the park. Every time you look out 
there all you see are infielders and outfielders." 
</P>
<P>
Rosen said he has been looking for hitting help but "so is everyone else" in a 
year in which "pitching has taken over." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he is concerned about Clark and Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, as hot as they've been, pitchers are going to start pitching around 
both of them," he said. "For a hitter to sustain an outstanding year he needs 
protection front and back. 
</P>
<P>
"The great performances demonstrate that." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Padres: Clean-up hitter Clark was batting .206 with six home runs and 
23 RBIs through Friday. Not all of his struggle can be pegged to a lack of 
protection, but it is obvious that he seldom gets a good pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Clark led the league with 45 walks in 49 games. But with the walks seldom 
materializing into runs, he has recently begun to swing at most anything. His 
54 strikeouts projected to 186, three shy of Bobby Bonds' major league record, 
set in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have used nine different players in the No. 5 spot, including every 
regular except Tony Gwynn and Garry Templeton. The No. 5 hitters were batting 
.213 with one home run and 15 RBIs through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Is it any wonder that the Padres' search for a No. 5 hitter to protect Clark is 
ultimately expected to produce a trade involving Sandy Alomar Jr., their highly 
regarded catching prospect? 
</P>
<P>
Said Gwynn, reflecting on the situation: 
</P>
<P>
"For the Dodgers, that fifth man (in the batting order) ain't too important 
because they got 'em. And the Reds, they've got someone. And the Giants, 
they've got Mitch and Will Clark. They don't need anybody. 
</P>
<P>
"Now for us, it's been different. Jack just ain't seen nothing to hit and this 
could turn into a big problem. But maybe if we can win games in other ways it 
won't be as big a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Astros: In a lineup of limited power, clean-up hitter Davis had 10 of 
Houston's 22 homers through Friday. Eight of the remaining 12 were hit either 
by Bill Doran, batting third, or another No. 2 or No. 3 hitter. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the Astros had only four homers by the four hitters batting 
behind Davis and none from the No. 5 spot in the order. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a reasonably disciplined power hitter who struck out once every 6.8 
at-bats prior to this season, is now striking out once every 4.1 at-bats, 
clearly chasing bad pitches in his zeal to compensate for that lack of power 
and protection behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"Glenn could stand there and get three or four walks per game, but you can't 
produce runs if you're not swinging the bat, and he's obviously frustrated (by 
the tendency to pitch around him)," General Manager Wood said by phone. "It's 
difficult to get run production if you don't have a middle of the order that 
fits together and works together. 
</P>
<P>
"It took us a long time to find and develop a Glenn Davis, but the guys we've 
put with him are being asked to do things they're not capable of." 
</P>
<P>
Wood has conducted a two-year crusade to find help, pursuing Dave Winfield, 
Jesse Barfield and Wade Boggs among others, but he said: "We promised to do 
something and meant it, but we've been unable to come up with the right player 
at the right price." 
</P>
<P>
And unless he does, Wood acknowledged that the Astros will have a tough time 
winning: "I won't say it's impossible, but without getting a hitter it will be 
difficult. We'd have to solve all our other problems and that wouldn't be easy 
in the span of a year." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Dodgers: Executive Vice President Fred Claire has said that with 
Gibson, Murray and Marshall, the Dodgers -- on paper, at least -- are as strong 
in the middle as anyone anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Health may be an issue. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson's hamstring affects the weight he can put on his back or power leg and 
cuts into his base- running effectiveness. Marshall's chronic back problem 
reduces his ability to rotate, reducing his power. He has two RBIs in May and 
12 this season. Murray may be paying a price for a heretofore lack of 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
The clean-up hitter had drawn 15 walks, five of which were intentional, and 
batted .148 in his last 16 games through Friday night. He walked 28 times in 
all, 10 of those being intentional. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers went into Saturday night's game 2-2 since Gibson returned to the 
lineup and pleaded with the media not to portray him as the savior for an 
attack that was last in the league in runs, home runs and team average. 
</P>
<P>
Batting coach Ben Hines agreed. He cited Gibson's and Marshall's physical 
problems and cautioned against the expectation of instant combustion from the 
middle of the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"We're definitely as strong as anyone in the league there and I definitely 
believe that having Kirk back will prove contagious, but it might not show for 
awhile," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the bottom line on protection, on having productive hitters 
behind productive hitters, is often the season's final statistics. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be difficult to measure day to day, but over the long run it makes a 
big difference," he said. "You only have to look at how Clark has benefitted 
from having Mitchell behind him." 
</P>
<P>
And how both may suffer from the absence of any other protection.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
YANKEES BLANKED AGAIN BY ATHLETICS, 3-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the pitchers dominated last season, baseball people were sure they knew 
the reason why. They said there was a switch to a dead ball, one that wouldn't 
carry a distance. 
</P>
<P>
This season, runs are even tougher to come by. Are the pitchers really that 
good? 
</P>
<P>
If the last two games in New York are an example, the hitters are in trouble. 
The Yankees, with a batting order that figures to score, have been humbled 
twice in a row by lesser members of the Oakland Athletics' staff. 
</P>
<P>
In the vernacular of the hitter, left-hander Curt Young doesn't throw hard 
enough to break a pane of glass. But Young and three relievers held the Yankees 
to six hits in the Athletics' 3-0 victory Saturday at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Contrasted with Friday night, that was solid hitting. Todd Burns, in his first 
start of the season, and two relievers held the Yankees to one hit as the A's 
won, 4-0. The Yankees sent only 27 batters to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
The back-to-back shutouts mark the first time the Yankees were blanked in 
consecutive games in more than five years. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees' first three hitters -- Rickey Henderson, Steve Sax and Don 
Mattingly -- figure to at least manufacture a run. And the middle three of 
Jesse Barfield, Steve Balboni and Ken Phelps all have power. 
</P>
<P>
These batters were at the mercy of Burns, Young, Gene Nelson, Rick Honeycutt 
and Eric Plunk. 
</P>
<P>
Yankee Manager Dallas Green said he was at a loss for an explanation why the 
Yankees stopped hitting. "I've tried everything," he said, "and nothing works." 
</P>
<P>
It may have been a costly victory for the leaders of the West. Dennis 
Eckersley, as good a reliever as there is, faced two batters to start the 
ninth, then left abruptly, grabbing his right shoulder in pain. 
</P>
<P>
Eckersley, who had 45 saves last year, was two outs from his 15th of this 
season when he departed. A's Manager Tony La Russa blamed the difference 
between the bullpen mound and the mound on the field at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this is something that will be corrected," La Russa said. "I'll ask 
Sandy Alderson (Oakland's general manager) to talk to the Yankees about fixing 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Although Eckersley said he was free of pain after the game, La Russa said the 
reliever would probably see a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 5, Toronto 3 -- It was the next-to-last game played in Exhibition 
Stadium, opened 12 years ago. White Sox rookie Carlos Martinez is not likely to 
forget it. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot 5-inch Venezuelan third baseman hit his first major league home run 
in the sixth inning to break a 3-3 tie and lead the White Sox to victory. The 
home run, a bit wind-aided, came in his 55th at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting," Martinez said. "I got a good piece of the ball. I wasn't 
trying to hit it out. It kept going and I think the wind blew it out." 
</P>
<P>
Today's game will end the Blue Jays' use of the stadium. They will begin play 
in the Skydome June 5. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 5, Detroit 1 -- Mark Gubicza (4-4) got his first victory in four 
decisions at Kansas City with a complete-game seven-hitter. Kevin Seitzer and 
Bo Jackson drove in runs early to give the right-hander a lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I was beginning to wonder where home was," Gubicza said. "It was nice to win 
at home against a team that is trouble for me." 
</P>
<P>
Texas 5, Minnesota 3 -- Tempers flared in the second inning at Minneapolis, but 
the Rangers remained cool and won for the fourth time in their last five games. 
</P>
<P>
Both benches emptied in the second inning when Twin catcher Brian Harper 
accused the Rangers' Steve Buechele, who was at second base, of stealing his 
signs. After Buechele, who had one of the Rangers' seven doubles, crossed the 
plate, the two had words and got into a wrestling match. Play was held up 10 
minutes, but apparently nobody was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Brown (4-1) pitched a six-hitter for his third complete game. He struck 
out seven. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 5, Cleveland 1 -- Mickey Tettleton provided the offense and Mark 
Huisman came to the rescue of ailing Dave Schmidt at Cleveland, leading the 
Orioles to their fifth victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton hit a two-run home run, his 11th homer of the season and sixth in the 
last 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
When Schmidt (4-4) had to leave because of a rib-cage injury after five 
innings, Huisman gave up only one hit in the last four innings for his first 
save since July 6, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 3, Seattle 2 -- Teddy Higuera indicated his arm troubles are behind 
him, then suffered a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Higuera, bothered by injuries for most of the last two seasons, held the 
Mariners to one hit in 4 2/3 innings before being injured. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers won when shortstop Gary Sheffield, who on Friday asked to be 
traded, singled in the winning run with two out in the ninth at Milwaukee. DAN

MIKE DOWNEY: JORDAN TEACHES A LESSON IN MANNERS

<P>
Good Boys 2, Bad Boys 1? 
</P>
<P>
"Good overcomes evil," Michael Jordan said, laughing his head off, sticking 
that tongue of his out. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday was a bad day for those self-made "Bad Boys" from Detroit. They 
thought they had the Chicago Bulls exactly where they wanted them -- 14 points 
down with 7 1/2 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Bulls had the Pistons exactly where they wanted them. The Bulls 
had the two things they needed to win a basketball game: 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan and a basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Next thing anybody knew, Chicago had come back to win, 99-97, on Jordan's 
running bank shot with three seconds to play, to take a 2-1 lead in the 
National Basketball Assn.'s Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored, oh, you know, 46 points, something like that. 
</P>
<P>
So, Los Angeles vs. Chicago for the NBA title? Magic Johnson vs. Michael 
Jordan, for the heavyweight basketball championship of the world? 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I love Magic to death," Detroit forward John Salley said after Saturday's 
game here. "But after facing Michael, all I can say is he should be the MVP. 
</P>
<P>
"The man is unstoppable." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit isn't done trying. Bouncing back with a Memorial Day victory would put 
the Pistons in the driver's seat with three games remaining, two of them at the 
Palace of Auburn Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, stopping the unstoppable Jordan might not matter so much. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit must stop stopping itself. 
</P>
<P>
Twice now, those nasty boys have lost games in this series because they didn't 
know when to cut out the rough stuff. The Pistons are like Tina Turner singing 
"Proud Mary." They never, ever like doing anything nice and easy. 
</P>
<P>
They blew a shot at taking Game 1 when Rick Mahorn committed a moving pick in 
the final half-minute. They blew a shot at saving Game 3 when Bill Laimbeer 
thrust a hip into Jordan with nine seconds remaining, also while trying to set 
a pick. Two fatal offensive fouls. 
</P>
<P>
Lest we forget, the Pistons also continued to pile up technical fouls because 
of their bad tempers, Mahorn drawing one early in Saturday's game, Coach Chuck 
Daly drawing one late. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the Pistons would get a break on a call from the officials if they built 
up some good will once in a while, instead of beefing all game long and instead 
of promoting themselves as the "bad boys" of basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure if they do themselves any favors," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
What a piece of work Mahorn is, for instance. Four minutes into Saturday's 
game, he fouled Jordan in the lane. A foot from the official's face, Mahorn 
spat out what is arguably the nastiest word in the English language, as anybody 
sitting within 50 feet of courtside could plainly hear. 
</P>
<P>
Technical foul, and Mahorn was taken out of the game by his coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even say anything," Mahorn told his coach, like a child fibbing to 
his father. 
</P>
<P>
Daly, either believing him or backing up his player, immediately stuck index 
fingers in both ears and called out to the referee that there must be something 
wrong with his hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Nice way to get the officiating on your side for later in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Remember that foul called on Laimbeer in Game 6 of last year's NBA finals, 
which sent Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to the line to win the game for the Lakers, 
costing Detroit the title? 
</P>
<P>
"The call went against the Detroit Pistons, once again," Laimbeer said about 
Saturday's fouls. "Same as Game 6 against the Lakers. Familiar story." 
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, nothing should be left to chance as long as this Jordan guy is on the 
premises. 
</P>
<P>
"I've said it before and I'll say it again," Chicago Coach Doug Collins said. 
"If there's the least little chance to win and Michael's in the game, there's a 
good chance you'll win." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored 10 of the Bulls' last 14 points this time. When the Bulls got the 
ball back with nine seconds left, on Laimbeer's offensive foul, they called a 
timeout to call a play. 
</P>
<P>
What play? 
</P>
<P>
What a question. 
</P>
<P>
"It's called 'Get the Ball to Michael and Everybody Get the . . . Out of the 
Way,' " Collins said, borrowing that multi-purpose Mahorn word. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan said: "It's a challenge, because everybody in the building knows you're 
going to get the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rodman knew it. Arguably the league's top defensive player, and 
officially voted 1988-89's best defensive non-center, Rodman guarded Jordan on 
that final trip down the floor. (Since he doesn't start, and since Detroit 
doesn't want to put a guard on Chicago forward Scottie Pippen, Rodman does not 
get to defend against Jordan as much as he would like.) 
</P>
<P>
Jordan tried to drive on him, but Rodman cut him off. Jordan changed 
directions, but Isiah Thomas helped out. 
</P>
<P>
So, Jordan split the difference. He went between them. 
</P>
<P>
"I just kind of jumped sideways," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
And shot, and scored. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, he had done it, as he had against Cleveland and New York earlier in 
the playoffs. Once again, Michael rowed the boat ashore, hallelujah. 
</P>
<P>
Michael vs. Magic in the NBA finals? 
</P>
<P>
The team that wins will be whichever one touches the ball last.

WEBSTER, CAMPBELL CONSIDERED CANDIDATES TO COACH THE KINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kings could name a new coach as early as Wednesday, now that the Stanley 
Cup finals are over and King owner Bruce McNall has returned from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Webster, a former New York Ranger coach who has some strong support within 
the Kings' organization, is being mentioned as a prime candidate along with 
Detroit Red Wing assistant Colin Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Webster had replaced Campbell as the most likely to succeed Robbie 
Ftorek, who was fired last month, McNall said that both should be considered. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody might have gotten the idea that Webster has an edge because I haven't 
even met Campbell yet," McNall said. "I still plan to meet with Campbell. 
Remember, I just got started on this. We're still in the process. No decision 
has been made." 
</P>
<P>
McNall also confirmed that he had spoken with Edmonton Oiler assistant coach 
John Muckler, who said he did not want to leave Edmonton unless the job 
included an opportunity of becoming a general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Webster might have an edge over Campbell because of his head coaching 
experience. But McNall said his first priority is finding a coach who has a 
good rapport with the players.

GOLF ROUNDUP;

BLAKE IS NO-NAME AT TOP IN GEORGIA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's in a leader-board? The names atop the Atlanta tournament aren't exactly 
a who's who of golf. It's more like a who's he. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Don Blake, who has never finished better than ninth in a PGA Tour event, 
birdied the final hole to cap a two-under-par 70 and take a one-stroke lead 
after three rounds at Marietta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
Blake had a nine-under-par total of 207 for 54 holes. Duffy Waldorf, another 
non-winner, had a 71 and sole possession of second place. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that when it's all over with, they'll know my name," Blake said. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because you don't have a well-known player up there doesn't mean there 
isn't talent up there," he added of a leader board that also includes Waldorf, 
Kent Kluba and Mike Miles. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Mize, Davis Love III and Kluba each posted 69s that left them two shots 
off the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Grady of Australia, who led at the halfway point, parred the first 14 
holes before taking bogeys on three of the last for holes to fall four shots 
back after a 75. 
</P>
<P>
Ayako Okamoto of Japan overcame swirling winds to shoot a four-under-par 67 to 
open a five-shot lead over Beth Daniel after three rounds of an LPGA tournament 
at Corning, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Okamoto, who had previous rounds of 69 and 66, had a 54-hole total of 
11-under-par 202. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel, who trailed by only one stroke going into the third round, shot a 71 
for 207. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Bradley was third, seven shots behind, at 209. Patty Sheehan and 
first-round co-leader Dawn Coe were tied for fourth at 211. 
</P>
<P>
Al Geiberger saw his lead dwindle to one stroke when he shot a one-under-par 71 
in the second round of the Senior Tour's Southwestern Bell tournament at 
Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
Geiberger, who had a three-shot lead at the start of the day, birdied the first 
and last holes for a 36-hole total of seven-under-par 137. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Nichols was alone in second place after his second 69. Jim Dent had an 
eagle on the par-5 fifth hole and shot a 70 to tie for third with Paul Moran 
(65) and Orville Moody (70), two strokes back. 
</P>
<P>
Masters winner Nick Faldo of Britain overcame a double bogey on the 15th hole 
to share a three-shot lead with Australian Craig Parry after two rounds of the 
European PGA Championship at Virginia Water, England. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo had a 69, and Parry had a second 68 for a total of 136.

JUNG WILL MEET LEAYCRAFT IN FINAL

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four years ago, Steven Jung was a lightly recruited junior player from Hacienda 
Heights in search of a tennis program. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents were about to have four kids in college," Jung said. "Getting a 
scholarship was a necessity." 
</P>
<P>
When the West Coast schools ignored him, Jung picked Nebraska over Indiana. 
Now, after what he terms "consistent improvement over four years," Jung is on 
the brink of the singles title at the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
The unseeded Jung (34-4) will meet Louisiana State's Donni Leaycraft (30-7) 
today at the University of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
The doubles final, which begins immediately after the singles' competition, 
will feature USC's Eric Amend and Byron Black against UC Irvine's Mike Briggs 
and Trevor Kronemann. A California school has won the doubles title five 
consecutive years with Trojan teams winning three in four years. 
</P>
<P>
Both Jung and Leaycraft defeated Georgia players in Saturday's semifinals. Jung 
eliminated Stephen Enochs in 70 minutes, 6-3, 6-2, and Leaycraft outlasted 
Francisco Montana, 7-5, 4-6, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Leaycraft, seeded in a group of players from nine to 16, is the first LSU 
player to reach a singles final; Jung is the first Big Eight player to 
accomplish the feat. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, USC's Rick Leach and Scott Melville defeated Irvine's Julian 
Barham and Darren Yates in the doubles finals. 
</P>
<P>
"UC Irvine has never had a Division I national champ in tennis," Briggs said. 
"Hopefully, we'll be the first. It's like Coach (Greg Patton) says, 'You just 
put on the lamp shades and go to the party.' " 
</P>
<P>
Doubles teams played quarterfinals and semifinals Saturday. In the semifinals, 
Briggs and Kronemann defeated Stanford's Alex O'Brien and Jeff Tarango, 6-3, 
6-7 (7-5), 6-3. Amend and Black defeated Irvine's Mark Kaplan and Richard 
Lubner for the third time this season, 3-6, 6-0, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
"We used the same strategy against them each time," Amend said. "We started 
slowly and then played back and made them hit volleys. They didn't have 
anywhere to put it." 
</P>
<P>
Jung is no stranger to championship tennis. His older sister Pam was a two-time 
All-American at Pepperdine and currently plays the pro tour. Another sister, 
Debbie, competed at Cal Poly Pomona. In 1985, the Jungs were named tennis 
family of the year by the United States Tennis Assn. "My dad taught us all," 
said Jung, who graduated two weeks ago with a degree in finance. "He wanted a 
sport that would bind us together. He didn't think it would come to this." 
</P>
<P>
When Nebraska also offered Jung's twin, Stuart, a scholarship, he decided to go 
to Lincoln, Neb. Stuart played doubles for the Cornhuskers. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand why some of the California schools didn't recruit me," Steven 
said. "Nebraska took a risk with me. I appreciate it." 
</P>
<P>
Jung failed to win a set in two previous NCAA appearances. But he blossomed 
this season, winning a tournament in Milwaukee last January. He eventually was 
ranked No. 23 nationally, but might have been higher had Nebraska's schedule 
included tougher competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had four years of constant improvement," he said. "I've slowly gotten 
better and better. My confidence has grown. I know I can play with the best. I 
feel there's nobody who can beat me when my game is on."

<P>
West Germany defeated the United States, 2-1, Saturday at the World Team Cup 
tournament at Dusseldorf, West Germany, to advance to a showdown against 
Argentina in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany's Boris Becker defeated Tim Mayotte, 6-4, 6-3, in the first 
singles match, and countryman Carl-Uwe Steeb overpowered Aaron Krickstein, 6-2, 
6-2, in the second. 
</P>
<P>
In Blue Group doubles play, Rick Leach and Jim Pugh of the U.S. pulled out a 
6-3, 6-7, 6-3 victory over Eric Jelen and Patrick Kuhnen. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time West Germany has advanced to the tournament finals, 
whereas the United States is a three-time champion. 
</P>
<P>
Spain defeated Switzerland, 2-1, to take third place in the Blue Group. 
Argentina advanced to the final by beating Czechoslovakia, 2-1, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Manuela Maleeva of Bulgaria and fourth-seeded Conchita Martinez of 
Spain will meet in the final of the European Open women's tournament today at 
Geneva, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
Maleeva advanced by beating Laura Garrone of Italy, 6-3, 7-5, and Martinez, 
ranked 13th in the world at age 17, advanced with a 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 victory over 
Barbara Paulus of Austria, who stunned top-seeded Chris Evert in the second 
round. 
</P>
<P>
Maleeva, singles bronze medalist at the 1988 Olympics, said she has 
particularly wanted to win at Geneva since marrying her Swiss coach, Francois 
Fragniere, in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Jana Novotna of Czechoslovakia breezed into the final of the 
Strasbourg Open women's tournament with a 6-1, 6-2 victory over unseeded 
Jo-Anne Faull of Australia. In the other semifinal, Patricia Tarabini of 
Argentina defeated Wiltrud Probst of West Germany, 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Sixth-seeded Horacio De La Pena of Argentina trounced top-seeded Andres Gomez 
of Ecuador, 6-1, 6-1, to reach the finals of a tournament at Florence, Italy. 
De La Pena will face 17-year-old Goran Ivanisevic of Yugoslavia, who reached 
his first career final by beating seventh-seeded Lawson Duncan, 6-3, 6-4.

MAN DIES OF BEATING BY BASEBALL BAT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Memorial Day weekend mayhem in Los Angeles County claimed the lives of four 
people, including one man beaten to death with a baseball bat outside a Compton 
bar and another accidentally shot by a friend who had been drinking during an 
overnight camp-out. 
</P>
<P>
In other unrelated violence, two youthful gang members in a pickup truck fired 
more than a dozen shots at sheriff's deputies attempting to stop them for 
running a red light, and two car thieves tried to run down another sheriff's 
deputy, who fired three shots at them as he dove out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
In Compton, Police Lt. Al Smith said Jose Britos, 26, and a friend were walking 
to Las Palomas bar in the 700 block of West Alondra Boulevard when two 
strangers approached them and began beating them with baseball bats. 
</P>
<P>
Britos was pronounced dead in the Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. 
The other man was not severely injured. No arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Playing With Rifle 
</P>
<P>
The camping death occurred after five friends who had been drinking heavily 
during an overnight trip near Littlerock Dam in the Angeles National Forest 
began playing with a .22-caliber rifle. 
</P>
<P>
Drew MacDonald, 21, of La Canada thought the weapon was unloaded when he 
pointed it at others and pulled the trigger, hitting La Canada resident Robert 
Gladysz, 21, in the neck, killing him, according to Sheriff's Deputy Chris 
Wahla. MacDonald has been booked on suspicion of involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
A neighborhood argument early Saturday apparently triggered another shooting 
death in the 4000 block of Marathon Street at the edge of the Silver Lake 
district, Los Angeles police said. "Essentially, we had an argument over loud 
noises," said Detective Ken Wiseman. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, Hermogenes Rodriguez, 34, became upset at neighbors who 
were making noise on the street, got into an argument, pulled a gun and shot 
one man. The victim, whose name was not immediately released, died about an 
hour later at UCLA Medical Center. Rodriguez was booked on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Man Found Dead 
</P>
<P>
In Tarzana, homicide detectives suspect foul play in the death of a 74-year-old 
man, who was found Friday evening in his home in the 18000 block of Collins 
Street. The man's name was not released until relatives could be notified. 
</P>
<P>
In Paramount, two alleged gang members in a Toyota pickup truck fired 15 shots 
from a 9-mm handgun at two sheriff's deputies who tried to stop them for 
running a red light, officials said. The deputies were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects, Victor Casillas, 19, and a 17-year-old juvenile were booked on 
suspicion of attempted murder of a police officer and held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy David Philippon of the Temple City sheriff's station was another law 
enforcement target in an incident that began when he tried to talk to the 
drivers of two cars that had been speeding in South El Monte early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Philippon had to dive out of the way as the 17-year-old driver of one of the 
cars tried to run him down in a gas station, according to a sheriff's 
spokesman. The deputy fired three shots, all of which hit the car but missed 
the driver and his passenger, Paul Vasquez, 20, of El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez was arrested for grand theft auto and is being held on $1,500 bail, and 
the juvenile was booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on a 
police officer and grand theft.

DISABLED GIRL TAKES HER SHOT AT THE TITLE

<TEXT>
<P>
When Tammy Miner received an invitation to participate in the Miss Californian 
American Coed Pageant, she didn't let her physical condition spoil a dream. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-year-old San Bernardino resident, who uses a motorized wheelchair 
because of cerebral palsy, applied for the pageant and joined hundreds of other 
teen-age and preteen girls in the contest Saturday at the Airport Marriott in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
She wore a pink satin dress that her godmother made for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
At a dance rehearsal before the finale, two men lifted her on stage in her 
wheelchair, and she joined the practice by moving her arms the way the others 
did. While waiting for an interview with the judges, she muttered, "I can't 
believe I'm doing this. I get nervous very easily." 
</P>
<P>
Tammy learned about the pageant by mail. Her name appeared on a list of 
teen-agers used by pageant sponsors to find contestants. 
</P>
<P>
"She was really excited about it," her mother, Martha, recalled. "I said, 'Calm 
down.' We'll have to call them Monday. I called them and they said, 'Sure, the 
wheelchair will be no problem.' She really liked the idea. She would have 
pushed the car here if necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Because of her physical condition, Tammy was unable to compete in the talent 
and speech competition on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Her daughter realized that realistically she had "little chance of winning" the 
competition among more than 200 preteen participants, Miner said. Nevertheless, 
she said, Tammy was resolved to take part. 
</P>
<P>
"She's an 11-year-old, and she determined to do whatever every 11-year-old 
does," Miner said. "She's involved in Girl Scouts, and she goes to summer camp 
and everything like that. She starts middle school in September." 
</P>
<P>
Tammy said she often tries things that others think she can't do. "I do it to 
prove I can, and sometimes to experiment." And how do her experiments turn out? 
She laughed: "Mostly good." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's experiment was mostly good, too. Tammy placed in the top 20 
finalists and was voted Miss Congeniality-Miss Personality by the other girls. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very heartwarming," said Jack Cione, spokesman for the sponsoring 
American Coeds Pageants Inc. of Pensacola, Fla. "We were very concerned about 
putting someone like that in a pageant like this, not knowing how the girls 
would react. But they just really took to her." 
</P>
<P>
The co-winners of the pageant -- Casey Dickerson of Folsom and Jill Tacey of 
San Diego -- will compete in the national finals in Honolulu in late August.

YOUNG TURKS GIVE BOOST TO OLD RACEWAY;

NEWCOMERS ARE BIG REASON WHY FADING ASCOT TRACK IS EXPERIENCING A REVIVAL AS IT 
HEADS FOR FINAL FINISH

<P>
The roar from stock cars careening around the quarter mile at Ascot Raceway 
last Sunday did little for Mike Kirby's headache. 
</P>
<P>
Kirby, a native of Carson, has been one of the hottest newcomers on the 
California Racing Assn. sprint-car circuit the past year and a half. He has 
also shown a propensity for racing pro stocks, bomber ovals and figure-8s in a 
career that is nearly a decade old. But as he sat on a bale of straw in the 
windy infield here, he wasn't sure he wanted to race anything again except 
figure-8s. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to race today. No way," he said about that night's stock car 
card. He was still reeling from the previous night, when problems with his 
sprint car forced him out of that night's main event. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Kirby wanted it known that he is capable of driving just about anything, 
and he changed his tune about driving last Sunday several times. 
</P>
<P>
"If I want to drive (stocks) I will," he asserted. "I can race those things if 
I have to." 
</P>
<P>
As versatile as he is, Kirby, 26, is just one of Ascot's promising young South 
Bay home boys. The group, which includes P. J. Jones of Rolling Hills Estates 
(full midgets), Frank Pedregon of Gardena and Sean Birmingham of Torrance 
(three-quarter midgets), and Chris Laney of Gardena (stocks, bomber ovals and 
figure-8s), is part of the reason the tired, old Gardena track is experiencing 
a revitalization less than 18 months from its final event. 
</P>
<P>
Racing continues tonight and Monday at the annual Salute to Indy, but 
eventually the track is scheduled to close. The land it sits on, roughly a 
triangular lot where the Harbor, San Diego and Artesia freeways meet, is slated 
for development once the lease with the raceway's owner, Agajanian Enterprises, 
expires in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the number of competitors at the track has increased over the past 
two years after about a decade of decline, according to Executive Vice 
President Ben Foote. About 117 cars of various types run there on any given 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"In the sprints alone, it was not uncommon 10 years ago to have at least 50 
cars running," Foote said. "In the mid-'80s we had 30 to 32 cars. Now on most 
nights we have 40 to 45, about the most of any association in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Foote attributes the rise in new, young drivers to a variety of factors. In the 
midget class, he said, the allure of racing under the national banner of the 
United States Auto Club is important to younger drivers. USAC became involved 
with Ascot a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"For the young guys, I think there is enthusiasm for running with a national 
organization," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Foote also said that the type of events offered at Ascot, like Enduro racing, 
attract a lot of drivers who just want to race for fun and then later take up 
the sport seriously. Laney began his career in Enduro, which features street 
cars modified only with a roll bar for the driver's protection. 
</P>
<P>
"I think racing for fun appeals to the younger guys," Foote said. 
</P>
<P>
Ascot's demise isn't news around the track, but it certainly doesn't set well 
with the youth invasion. "We just want to race," Pedregon said. 
</P>
<P>
As for Kirby, he had good reason not to run in the pro stocks last Sunday. A 
fiery crash the night before at Ascot took the life of fellow sprint-car racer 
Jeff Bagley, the 1988 Rookie of the Year. And, because of Kirby's misfortune in 
the main, there was speculation that his sprint sponsor was considering 
canceling the remainder of its season if problems with the car aren't corrected 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
There is little doubt, however, among Ascot officials that Kirby would hook up 
with another racing team. 
</P>
<P>
"He's such a good driver," said Ascot spokeswoman Carol McEvoy Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
A slow starter, Kirby is the oldest of the younger drivers. He did not qualify 
for a sprint main until his ninth time out last season. But since then he has 
recorded some impressive finishes, including third in a major national event 
two weeks ago in Knoxville, Tenn. He won Ascot's novice figure-8 title in 1981 
and the overall figure-8 crown in 1987. He was Most Improved Driver last year 
in quarter mile sprint-car racing. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, 20, is among the youngest successful drivers at the track. He began his 
career in go-carts and won more than a third of all his races. He began racing 
midget cars late in 1986 but was still voted USAC Rookie of the Year. In 1987 
he finished fifth in overall points in USAC midgets. He is the eldest son of 
1963 Indy 500 winner Parnelli Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Pedregon, 25, spent most of his youth in the pits for his father, Frank, a 
top-fuel drag racer, at famed Lions Drag Strip in Wilmington. In 1980 he raced 
diesel trucks, then moved onto dirt carts in 1983. A year later he won the 
Grand National title on pavement. He set a record of eight consecutive main 
event victories in 1986, then moved up to three-quarter midgets. He has been 
seen on ESPN's Thunder Series from Ascot and on May 4 finished third in the 
full midget main. 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham, 21, was the USAC three-quarter Rookie of the Year in 1988 after 
five top-10 finishes. An auto mechanic by trade, he began racing motocross when 
he was 6. In his late teens he was on the pit crew for the late driver Roger 
Newell. Newell was involved in a fatal accident at Ascot and that convinced 
Birmingham to start out in the three-quarters. He says he plans to return to 
sprint cars in a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
Laney, 20, is perhaps the hottest driver of the youth movement right now, 
despite opening the year with three blown engines in his first three events. A 
first-place finish April 30 in the pro stocks "hiked his chances for Rookie of 
the Year honors," according to the Winston Racing Series News. 
</P>
<P>
Laney is running about even in points with another talented racer, Tony Zaffino 
of Carson. Zaffino was last year's Rookie of the Year. Laney's efforts are a 
family affair. Brother Paul owns the race car, his fiancee, Karla Kirby (Mike 
Kirby's sister), helped pay for the motor and brothers Mark and Brett serve as 
his pit crew. "All the money I've got is in this car," Laney said. On the night 
Kirby chose not to race, Laney finished fourth in the pro stocks, fifth in the 
bomber oval and first in the figure-8. 
</P>
<P>
All of the young turks of the track appear to have futures, no matter where 
they race when Ascot is closed. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost all drivers would race anything just to get a ride," Birmingham said. 
</P>
<P>
They won't have to beg, it appears. Ascot as their home track is expected to 
keep them racing when it shuts down. 
</P>
<P>
"We think Ascot is one of the premier leaders in racing, particularly in the 
area of promotion," said Chris Boals, national field representative for the 
National Assn. of Stock Car Racing, during a visit to the track last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Ascot has been a proving ground for many top auto racers. Ten of the 33 racers 
in today's Indianapolis 500 have raced here. In 1988, 14 of the drivers at Indy 
had performed at Ascot in their careers. 
</P>
<P>
Of the home boys, Jones probably has the greatest chance at moving on to Indy 
cars. In fact, he says that following in his dad's footsteps is a goal. "This 
is a steppingstone where you learn the basics," he said of the dirt track at 
Ascot. "You make a mistake here, it's not going to hurt you." 
</P>
<P>
Pedregon likens Ascot to his home. It is a unique place, he said, right down to 
the damp odor of the slick track and the brown adobe mud that clings to shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are at Ascot, you know it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"Ask anyone in the United States (who knows racing) about Ascot and they will 
tell you that this is one of the premier dirt tracks in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
Laney calls the Ascot oval "a driver's track," and says racers who compete here 
often fare better in out-of-town races. 
</P>
<P>
But even with this year's ESPN coverage, which concludes Thursday at 5:30 p.m., 
Ascot has suffered from a lack of exposure, and the youthful drivers say that 
has hurt their image. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jones: "The crowd factor has hurt. We just can't get L.A. people to go to 
the races. There are so many other things to do here." 
</P>
<P>
Boals says there's no doubt each of the young drivers would receive more 
attention in areas like the Midwest and South, where all forms of racing are 
highly popular. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys would be heroes in small towns," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Late afternoon rays from an orange sun cast shadows onto the mud-stained 
billboards around the track as Kirby remained in the infield. No, he would not 
race today, he said once again. Maybe he'd work in the pits. He could race. He 
just didn't want to. 
</P>
<P>
When all the cars were off the track, he negotiated the muddy surface and 
jumped over the retaining wall, disappearing into the pits. He wouldn't race 
tonight, but there would be other times, just as there had been before.

TOP PITCHING TOSSES SOUTH BAY FROM 4-A BASEBALL TOURNAMENT

<P>
After reports of its demise proved to be greatly exaggerated, the L.A. City 
Section 4-A baseball playoffs opened Friday, accompanied by the confusion you'd 
expect from a tournament thrown together on 24 hours' notice. 
</P>
<P>
For example: 
</P>
<P>
* University High of West Los Angeles faced San Pedro without its starting 
catcher, Isaac Yoshinaga, because the team was unable to get in touch with him. 
"He never got the word," Coach Frank Cruz said. 
</P>
<P>
* San Pedro Coach Jerry Lovarov said one of his starters had to be called in 
from Palm Springs and another was about to depart for a camping trip to 
Mammoth. "We got him just as he was leaving," Lovarov said. 
</P>
<P>
* The site of the Banning-Grant game was changed from Banning to Grant in Van 
Nuys, four hours before starting time, when it was discovered that Grant had 
the better record. 
</P>
<P>
* Gardena's regular center fielder knew about the Mohicans' game with 
Chatsworth, but failed to show. "I guess he felt like he wasn't into it any 
more," Coach Mike Sakurai said. 
</P>
<P>
But the games were played, and that's all anybody really wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the South Bay's three entries, it was a quick exit from 
post-season play. San Pedro fell to University, 8-3, Banning dropped a 6-2 
decision to Grant, and for the third straight year, Gardena lost in the first 
round to Chatsworth, 9-1. 
</P>
<P>
In each case, area teams ran into superior pitching. 
</P>
<P>
University's Eric Alexander, a powerful right-hander who has signed with 
Oklahoma State and is expected to be a high draft choice, shut out San Pedro on 
two hits through five innings before leaving the game with an 8-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Grant's Javier Delahoya allowed six hits and struck out 11 against Banning, and 
Chatsworth aces Reed McMackin and Derek Wallace combined on a three-hitter and 
10 strikeouts against Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro Coach Jerry Lovarov acknowledged that Alexander, who helped 
University to the City 3-A title last year, was one of the best pitchers the 
Pirates had faced. But he said the effects of the 11-day teachers' strike had 
more to do with his team's poor showing. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids' timing was way off because of the layoff," Lovarov said. 
</P>
<P>
Although San Pedro's players continued to practice on their own throughout the 
strike, Friday's game was the first time they had played since May 11. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo's Cardiac Kids were at it again Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In what is becoming a familiar scenario, the Eagles rallied for five runs in 
the bottom of the seventh inning to edge visiting La Canada, 14-13, in the 
quarterfinals of the CIF-Southern Section 2-A baseball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth time this season El Segundo has won a game in the bottom of 
the last inning. 
</P>
<P>
A sign of things to come came in the Eagles' first two games. They rallied for 
three runs in the seventh to defeat Brea-Olinda, 7-5, in their opener and came 
back the next game with a run in the eighth to beat Alhambra, 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo worked its last-inning magic again May 10, scoring three runs in the 
bottom of the eighth to pull out a 6-5 win over St. Bernard for the Camino Real 
League title. 
</P>
<P>
Friday the Eagles trailed 13-9 before overtaking La Canada on three hits, three 
walks, a sacrifice fly, a catcher's interference and a suicide squeeze by 
sophomore Brett Newell that scored pinch-runner Steve Mortesen with the winning 
run with one out. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded El Segundo (24-5) advances to the semifinals at 3:15 p.m. Tuesday 
against third-seeded Temple City (20-7) at Culver City High. It will be the 
Eagles' 12th appearance in the semifinals in 30 years under Coach John 
Stevenson, who has guided El Segundo to five Southern Section titles. Its last 
championship was in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo went through its entire pitching staff against La Canada as four 
pitchers gave up a total of 19 hits. Junior right-hander Rob Croxall proved the 
most effective, giving up three hits and one earned run over the final two 
innings to notch his second win of the playoffs and improve to 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson said it was the first time this season that his pitchers had been lit 
up. La Canada out-homered the Eagles, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just one of those days," he said. "Everything we threw up there turned 
into a base hit or a home run. (La Canada) got two bloop hits that fell in the 
infield behind our pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson said he would start either Croxall or senior right-hander Rick Clark 
(8-0), who started Friday and gave up nine hits and six runs in 2 2/3 innings, 
on Tuesday. Croxall allowed no earned runs in nine innings pitched last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Croxall is really pitching well, but his arm is a bit tired," Stevenson said. 
"That's why we didn't go to him earlier (Friday). But Clark has been our ace 
all year. He's had a lot of good games." 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder Erik Evans hit a grand slam in the second inning and finished 
with five RBIs. He leads the Eagles with six home runs and 37 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
When St. Bernard's Dan Melendez stepped to the plate with the bases loaded in 
the sixth inning Friday, Coach Bob Yarnall expected a grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was going to hit it out," he admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Melendez grounded into a fielder's choice that ended the inning and 
left San Marino with a 3-2 lead. San Marino came back with four runs in the 
bottom of the sixth off Melendez to build its advantage and went on to 
eliminate the Vikings, 7-3, in the quarterfinals of the CIF 2-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
It was a rough way for Melendez to end a prolific prep career. He allowed 10 
hits and a season-high five earned runs to suffer only his third loss in 14 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
And although he finished the season with 12 home runs, his power waned in the 
last month. After hitting two home runs against Verbum Dei on April 26, he hit 
only one more in St. Bernard's last eight games. He ended his career with 31 
home runs, one shy of the Southern Section record held by former Simi Valley 
slugger Scott Sharts. 
</P>
<P>
Yarnall said the pressure of carrying the team may have gotten to Melendez, who 
will play for Pepperdine next season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was a little relieved when it was over," he said. "He doesn't have 
to carry the team any more. He's going to be just another team member (in 
college)." 
</P>
<P>
Melendez ended the season with a .527 batting average (39 for 74), 27 runs 
scored, 40 RBIs, an 11-3 pitching record and a 1.67 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne's 400-meter relay team set a state record for the second straight 
week Friday night at the CIF-Southern Section Masters Meet at Cerritos College, 
where a shaky handoff on the last leg may have cost the Cougars a national 
record. 
</P>
<P>
The team of Chris Alexander, Anthony Smith, Erik Allen and Curtis Conway broke 
the record they set two weeks ago at the 4-A Division finals with a time of 
40.25 seconds. But Coach Kye Courtney said if Conway had not switched the baton 
from his left hand to his right after taking the handoff from Allen, Hawthorne 
would have become the first team to break the 40-second barrier. 
</P>
<P>
The national 400 relay record is 40.00. 
</P>
<P>
"If we hit him on the dead run, and he doesn't switch (hands), it's all over," 
he told The Daily Breeze. "We'll run 38 (seconds). Forget 39." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne will get another shot at the record this weekend at the state 
championships at Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars moved into good position to capture their seventh state title of 
the 1980s by qualifying athletes in six events, including three in the 100 
meters.

JUAN DOWNEY: ARTISTIC SPARKS FROM CULTURE SHOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another in a series that profiles people in the arts who have migrated across 
cultural boundaries in the Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
Artist Juan Downey knows about culture shock. Born in Santiago, Chile, he left 
home at 21 for Barcelona, Spain. Uprooting again, he went to Paris a year 
later, then shortly thereafter settled in New York, where, after 24 years, he 
will soon become an American citizen. 
</P>
<P>
Crossing time lines and language barriers, adapting to societies separated by 
thousands of miles and hundreds of years' history, Downey's art matured and 
expanded constantly, whether by exposure to Diego Velasquez's classical 
17th-Century paintings or to Andy Warhol's Coca-Cola bottles. 
</P>
<P>
"The culture shock became an aesthetic spark," the 48-year-old conceptual 
artist said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, uniting the multiple facets of his background has proved impossible. In 
addition to the cultural chasm between his birthplace and his adopted homeland, 
there is the Irish heritage that gave the artist his surname, and French, 
Spanish and English ancestry too. 
</P>
<P>
"I oscillate between these polarities . . . I am constantly trying to resolve 
the opposition with no success. It is a dilemma I have not solved and probably 
never will," says the artist, who's also a professor of architecture and video 
at New York's Pratt Institute. 
</P>
<P>
This torque and tension has influenced much of Downey's work, two examples of 
which may be be seen in Southern California beginning this month. 
</P>
<P>
"Latin American Spirit: Art and Artists in the United States, 1920-1970," 
includes an electronic installation he made in 1969. KCET Channel 28 will air 
his recent video work "Return of the Motherland" on June 16 at 11 p.m. in its 
"New Television" series. 
</P>
<P>
After studying architecture (his father's profession) and printmaking in 
Santiago, Downey focused on painting, drawing and prints when he arrived in 
Paris in 1962. Intrigued by movement and energy, he created machine-like 
images, influenced by compatriot Roberto Matta, a Surrealist also living in 
Paris, Dadaist Marcel Duchamp and conceptualists who believed "that the ideas 
in art were more important than the object," the artist said. 
</P>
<P>
His work jumped off the page when he moved to New York in 1965 and started 
actually making machines, three-dimensional kinetic, electronic sculptural 
installations. These often required audience participation like "Against 
Shadows," the piece in the San Diego show, in which viewers' shadows determine 
patterns lit up on a bank of light bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
Downey, whose works have been shown at Washington's Corcoran Gallery of Art, 
traces his interest in interactive artwork back to his studies of classical 
Spanish paintings in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
"In this art, there is always room for the viewer. Specifically, Velasquez 
engages the viewer in a participatory act of seeing. In his work "Las Meninas," 
the royal family looks directly at the viewer. 
</P>
<P>
"So in my work of the '60s in New York (with further influence from such 
artists as Robert Rauschenberg who was experimenting with technology) it became 
audience participation by means of technology." 
</P>
<P>
And the use of technology then led to video, a medium he began to use in the 
early '70s when his work also became more political. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly this perfect society of hippies collapsed. The bombing of Cambodia, 
the fact that Nixon was lying to Congress and the Kent State killings struck me 
very deeply." 
</P>
<P>
Among the works born out of this period were two series that combined video, 
installation and graphic works to address his own "transcultural" situation and 
the search for self. One, titled "Thinking Eye," deals with his European roots; 
the other, "TransAmericas," takes up his Latin American heritage. 
</P>
<P>
"What's beginning to happen lately is that the series has merged," Downey said. 
"I often deal in one piece with both European roots and Latin American roots. 
For instance, I have a video installation entitled 'About Cages,' which deals 
both with fascism in Europe and fascism in Chile."Downey's worlds intermingle 
again in "Return of the Motherland," the video to be televised next month. 
Here, the artist confines himself to his life in New York City and his ties to 
Santiago, expressing these two realities as suggestive "fictions," woven 
together on the 27-minute tape that bespeaks his dilemma of "living in two 
cultures." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very good in New York, I feel great response from the environment. I 
feel support, not only in the sense of grants or sales of my drawings, but in 
receiving feedback for my work and personal support and understanding." 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "I cannot forget the elimination of the democracy under the 
(Augusto) Pinochet dictatorship, the missing people, the tortures. . . . Though 
I will soon be an American citizen and I'm active in the art world in New York, 
the Latin root is extremely powerful. My heart is in Chile."

AMAN: NO QUESTION, IT'S STILL A TIME TO DANCE;

L.A.-BASED ETHNIC FOLK ENSEMBLE WORKS TO LURE BACK LOCAL AUDIENCES

"From the top!" hollers Barry Glass, above a mild din of laughter and lively 
patter. 
</P>
<P>
The chunky cherub of a director turns to face his 40-odd performers as they 
group themselves into short lines and circles. At a signal they sing out in 
robust, thrusting chest tones. A somewhat reedy edge gives the massed sound a 
wild vitality. 
</P>
<P>
The stage area becomes a riot of regimental patterns all moving in 
simultaneous, rhythmic motion. The pace quickens, someone hoots a high 
ad-libbed note and at a peak of whirling, stomping excitement the piece ends. 
</P>
<P>
It's Tuesday, a regular rehearsal night for the Aman Folk Ensemble and the 
Serbo-Croatian number at hand is "Ladarke" -- one of 200 suites in the 
repertory. The studio, housed in what formerly was the downtown Design Center, 
occupies the building's fourth floor. Two stories higher is Aman's deluxe 
offices and storage rooms for more than 4,000 costumes. A real-estate 
tycoon-patron has been good to the troupe. 
</P>
<P>
It's business as usual, except that a milestone looms just ahead: the 25th 
anniversary of Aman and a celebratory performance at Royce Hall, UCLA, on June 
10. 
</P>
<P>
It's a time to dance, no question. The company has grown from a scrappy 
collection of high-spirited amateurs with Moseyev-of-yore stars in their eyes 
to a slick professional ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
But in 25 years, Aman has had its downs as well as ups. At one point in the 
early '80s its budget fell from a previous peak of $1 million to $200,000, an 
indicator of the company's drop in popularity. But it's on the rise again. 
</P>
<P>
For this, a key force behind Aman, Anthony Shay, no longer takes credit, thanks 
to the powers that are. He runs his 12-year-old off-shoot troupe, Avaz. 
</P>
<P>
Aman and Avaz are both at the six-figure mark now, "with the gap closing, but 
Aman definitely having the advantage of name recognition and a backlog of 
costumes," says Bonita Edelberg, former Aman dancer and now an attorney who 
sits on the Avaz board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Both troupes want to lure audiences back to the ethnic fold. However, Glass 
says he does not want Aman to remain "in its ghetto." He'd like to possibly 
include rap songs and break-dancing from the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, so would Shay, "but my (Avaz) dancers could never do that sort of 
thing convincingly," he says. "And why would I want to teach them Japanese 
classical dance, for instance, when right here we have authentic experts of the 
genre?" 
</P>
<P>
Nothing has changed a quarter of a century after the founding of Aman. Two 
distinct philosophies prevail: 
</P>
<P>
"I respect Barry," says Shay. "He's the best rehearsal director I've ever seen. 
But his aesthetic point of view -- that's another matter." 
</P>
<P>
"We're not really rivals," says Glass of Shay. "I see our two companies as 
friendly competitors." 
</P>
<P>
Aman's 25th anniversary is a time to acknowledge roots. But some of them lie 
buried, with little hope of exhumation. And therein lies a tale. 
</P>
<P>
The year was 1963, the place, UCLA. A folklorist with a bachelor's degree in 
international relations, Shay had just come back from two years of study 
(Iranian language and literature) at the University of Tehran, where he also 
played principal flute in that city's symphony orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to save the world," Shay recalls, referring to his international 
relations major, "until I realized that it didn't want saving." He spoke Farsi 
fluently, read Serbo-Croatian and Turkish and functioned in Russian. On the 
heels of '60s folk-music madness he fell in step with ethnic dance, which was 
natural for such a citizen-of-the-world idealist. 
</P>
<P>
Out of a campus recreational group he called the Village Dancers, Shay formed a 
new company -- one named with the words that means "Amen" in Middle Eastern 
languages. And he became entranced by Leona Wood, a tall beauty of a 
belly-dancer, who, along with her percussion-accompanist husband Phil Harland, 
was part of the Westwood folk-dance scene. 
</P>
<P>
"She was the kind of mesmerizing, spectacular performer, who could take her 
specialty back to its roots," says Shay, "and Phil was a brilliant musician. 
They would have been a terrific asset to any company and I certainly needed a 
soloist of that calibre to elevate our amateur level." 
</P>
<P>
After several months, Wood accepted the invitation to join Aman. Once she did, 
becoming co-director with Shay, she followed her interest in Arabic and North 
African dance, taking charge of that wing and teaching it to the other members. 
Meanwhile Shay ran the Iranian, Balkan and Central Asian division. 
</P>
<P>
No one took salaries or depended on them. Camaraderie, which epitomized the 
folk spirit, ran high among the smitten; they revelled in the multicultural 
joys of what they saw as a kindly global village. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years Aman grew. Its fortunes enlarged with its exposure and 
experience, paving the way for a smooth professionalism. Auditions brought 50 
contenders for every two openings. Because folk dance flourished as a 
socio-recreational force, with many cafes crammed with aficionados, the talent 
pool was full. 
</P>
<P>
But so did the artistic discrepancy between Shay and Wood widen. He was a world 
traveler guided by a documentarian's ardor. She loved the nest and didn't want 
to venture. For a while it worked out; he did the footwork, so to speak, 
bringing back from exotic places the fruits of his research, showing her films 
of villagers dancing. 
</P>
<P>
She adapted the material. "Once you remove the art form from its dung-and-dirt 
village," Wood explains, "it's already a showpiece, not authentic. I believe in 
technique as the key to re-creating the dances. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you catch iron particles? How do you catch mice? With a better magnet, 
with a better mousetrap. That's what Aman could do -- attract the best dancers. 
I also believe in matching the material to the audience, although one has to be 
wary of wholesale revisions. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw Jonathan Miller's English translated production of "Rigoletto" (set 
in New York's Little Italy) it made sense as it never did before. By the same 
token, a thing can be choreographed to the nines and still be authentic." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing of this attitude made sense to 
</P>
<P>
Shay. He was in love with the genuine article, the anthropological context, 
even the taverna down the street in Los Angeles. He believed that Aman's 
dancers could capture a people's core expression without forfeiting, he says, 
"their human value or the meaning of their social existence." His dance suites, 
which represented three-fourths of the Aman repertory, painstakingly preserved 
the essence of the material. 
</P>
<P>
"But the minute you reduce that expression to patterns and pretty decorative 
trappings and colorful spectacle," he explains, "is when you lose integrity. 
Leona was a fine visual artist before she came to ethnic dance. She's very 
designer-oriented. We simply were not on the same wave-length." 
</P>
<P>
The inevitable split occurred in 1977. It came following Shay's return from a 
Middle Eastern trip. This time he was not content to teach Wood the dances and 
then see, as a result, what he considered to be "second-hand choreography." She 
resisted his desire to re-create the dances. 
</P>
<P>
To mediate the standoff the board of directors formed an ad hoc committee that 
would judge both Wood's and Shay's choreography, choosing the better sample. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony could not abide such a decision," says Edelberg, an Aman board of trustee 
member. "Those people knew nothing of artistic matters. The whole idea was a 
sham -- meant to protect the status quo. As it was he always gave Leona the 
benefit of the doubt." 
</P>
<P>
Slay continues: "One board member took me aside and said the company would be 
mine in a year, when Leona stepped down. But it still didn't seem right. Art 
cannot be done by committees any more than it can be done by numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Edelberg sees the situation from a political perspective "and one in which 
greed, betrayal, lust for power and all those other deadly sins come into 
play." Shay simply never developed the knack for ingratiating himself with the 
power players, she says: 
</P>
<P>
"Keeping a low profile was natural to him. His interest was in the work, not 
the politics, which seemed to involve everyone else. He's a deep man when it 
comes to his art, one who is compelled to keep it safe from trivialization. And 
I share the feeling. My cheeks get red when I sit in the audience today and 
watch the cutesy-poo stuff that passes for ethnic dance." 
</P>
<P>
As proof of his strong scruples she mentions that Shay never took a salary at 
Aman -- "although all five subsequent directors, working only half-time, got 
paid nicely for the repertory Tony put in place." To this day he earns his 
living as the head of a city library branch (with a third master's degree in 
library science). 
</P>
<P>
The differences between Wood and Shay went beyond artistic matters, however. 
She characterizes their relationship as "a love affair between mother and son, 
regent and heir -- except that he wanted to put on the crown before his time. 
The end came when Tony, like the biggest puppy trying to grab the most food, 
wanted to spend the budget largely on his dances." 
</P>
<P>
Her estimate does not surprise Shay. 
</P>
<P>
"Leona never experienced motherhood," he says. "She did treat the dancers as 
her children, though, whereas I was satisfied to regard them as colleagues. As 
for the money, our beginning agreement never changed -- since my group was 
larger it got two-thirds of the budget . . . a matter of simple arithmetic." 
</P>
<P>
Leaving Aman meant "starting from scratch," says Shay. He knew that with no 
costumes, no board and empty pockets his Avaz Dance Theatre would not be 
appearing at the Music Center or any of the established venues. What's more, he 
was at a disadvantage when it came to attracting the best dancers. But talent 
wins out and in 1989 he finds a cherished word -- "authenticity" -- in his 
company's reviews. 
</P>
<P>
"When that happens I know I'm doing something right." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1977, when Aman and Shay parted ways, the company continued in its 
expansion -- venturing to the Brooklyn Academy of Music and throughout the U.S. 
on a major tour. The launching of Florida's Disney World in 1982 found Aman in 
residence for 19 weeks at Epcot Center as the featured entertainment 
attraction. And when the United States Information Agency needed to select 
cultural ambassadors to the Middle East and North Africa it selected Aman. 
</P>
<P>
Success begets success, as they say. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from these honors, the company depends heavily on its performances in 
Southern California schools, logging anywhere between 200 and 300 a year. 
Through the Music Center Education Division and Performing Tree, Aman dancers 
also teach roughly 1,000 classes a year in these schools. 
</P>
<P>
It's a smoothly operating system. 
</P>
<P>
But Glass, Aman's director since 1985, says he is looking beyond the present to 
'a brave new world," one that "will allow us to interface with other forms of 
dance . . . by not maintaining our separateness. 
</P>
<P>
I want to do more than conserve dance documents. And I know we must be part of 
the larger picture to grow, not shut off in a ghetto. What intrigues me, for 
instance, is how much we have in common with Laura Dean -- all those stage 
patterns and entertainment values. Yet Aman falls into the folk dance 
classification and she belongs to the postmodern movement." 
</P>
<P>
He talks about the fact that both are popular with series presenters. 
</P>
<P>
"But Aman is considered an audience builder. We're popular in small towns." 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not Glass ever sees the company merging with other forms of concert 
dance he acknowledges the multicultural forces in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Our audiences of the future will come from these ethnic communities. In one 
elementary school we found 38 languages spoken! If we can't be all things to 
all people, at least we'll have fun trying."

ARTHUR MILLER TO BRITS: DON'T BLOW IT; 
</P>
<P>
PLAYWRIGHT WARNS BRITISH THEATER NOT TO LET THE FLAME DIE

<TEXT>
<P>
Willy Loman strides around his dark kitchen, trying to hold onto a single train 
of thought. "Population is out of control! The competition is maddening! Smell 
the stink from that apartment house! . . . How can they whip cheese?" 
</P>
<P>
Sitting to the side of the stage at the Theatre Royal, Norwich, Arthur Miller 
studies the scene. Willy's accent may be a shade too Brooklyn, but it's the 
character to the life. Wonderful how a British actor (Warren Mitchell) bites 
into a line. Must be all that Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
Miller is watching 50 years of his plays flash before his eyes, as a theater 
full of Englishmen watch him. The experience has got to be gratifying. 
</P>
<P>
It is also ironic. The original London reviews of "Death of a Salesman" weren't 
that great. Now it is seen as a masterpiece, and Miller finds himself regarded 
here as the greatest living playwright on either side of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
Compare his treatment at home. He is respected, of course, but what has he done 
for us lately? The New York Times didn't like his new one-acts at Lincoln 
Center, and the Broadway revival of "All My Sons" ran only a few weeks. As the 
treasurer of a Broadway theater might put it, at the box office, he's no Neil 
Simon. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of thinking is why he likes to work in England. He has come to 
Norwich to inaugurate the Arthur Miller Centre for American Studies at the 
University of East Anglia and to take part in "An Evening With Arthur Miller," 
staged by David Thacker of the Young Vic. 
</P>
<P>
The evening -- it sold out the day it was announced -- starts with a surprise: 
a scene from an unpublished, unproduced play that Miller wrote at the 
University of Michigan in the 1930s, "The Golden Years." It is an epic about 
Cortez's conquest of Mexico, and one is expecting a high-flown student play, 
along Maxwell Anderson lines. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the lines do have the clang of armor, and actors John Shrapnel (Cortez) 
and Ronald Pickup (Montezuma) let them ring out. But the first interview 
between the two conquerors is effectively underwritten, with both men keeping 
to official pleasantries, while testing each other for weakness. The 
untouchable Montezuma's leap backwards when Cortez tries to shake his hand is 
good theater, even though both actors are carrying a script. 
</P>
<P>
"What did you think of it?" emcee Chris Bigsby asks Miller as the scene ends 
and the talk-show part of the evening begins. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised," the playwright answers in his gravel voice. "It holds up." 
</P>
<P>
Bigsby is a theater critic and a professor of American Studies at UEA. He had 
come up with the idea of the Arthur Miller Centre as a way of dramatizing the 
value of American Studies in British universities. He also knew what a good 
guest Miller would make at the Theatre Royal. Brits think that Yanks work too 
hard at being liked (or, as Willy Loman would say, well-liked). Miller is not 
that sort of Yank. 
</P>
<P>
At 74, he is dour and laconic, a guy who has learned that you get what you pay 
for and that you do pay for it. What, Bigsby wanted to know, was the impact of 
the Crash of 1929 on Miller's family? 
</P>
<P>
"Well . . . it ruined them," the playwright said. "But it also caused them to 
look at life more realistically." 
</P>
<P>
Failure will do that. Not so, success. Miller may still be a working playwright 
because -- unlike Tennessee Williams or William Inge -- he was never granted so 
much success that he came to believe in it. Something always came along to 
upset the apple cart, from the Depression to his troubles with the House 
Committee on Un-American Activities during the 1950s to his comparative 
critical neglect today. Adversity braced him. 
</P>
<P>
Bigsby asked Miller about HUAC after Matthew Marsh and Margot Leicester had 
finished a scene from "The Crucible." Miller recalled how strange it had been 
to find oneself in the middle of a scene that one had written for the stage. 
But where the Salem persecutors had thought they were going about God's work, 
Miller didn't remember much of that in Washington in the '50s. Politics and 
publicity -- that was what the red scare had come down to. 
</P>
<P>
David Calder's and Suzan Silvester's scene from "A View From the Bridge" 
reminded Miller that somebody had once pointed out to him that each of his 
plays had a lawyer in it. This surprised Miller, but when he checked, it was 
true. Which suggested that he believed in the law. That was true. He did. In 
the end, it was all we had. 
</P>
<P>
Miller hadn't come to Norwich with any sort of message for the English people. 
But having sat through two days of talks at the university about the state of 
British drama -- on stage, on the radio and on TV -- he did want to remind his 
listeners at the Theatre Royal not to blow it. 
</P>
<P>
England had developed a rational theater system, where a playwright could find 
opportunities to write decent stuff at any level from afternoon radio to the 
National Theatre of Great Britain; a state-supported theater where it was 
understood that good plays don't necessarily make the charts or attract the 
attention of big advertisers on TV. 
</P>
<P>
But -- if what Miller had been hearing was true -- this theater system was 
being threatened by the Thatcher government's philosophy that the arts ought to 
pay their own way: that they would pay their own way if artists would just 
"give people what they want." 
</P>
<P>
This was precisely the motto of the Broadway theater, Miller pointed out -- the 
theater where "Death of a Salesman" had once attracted the kind of serious, 
thoughtful, un-rich audience that a playwright wanted to speak to. Now Broadway 
had become a trashy midway dominated by one or two overpriced musicals and no 
serious plays at all. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, American TV and radio are more market-driven every year. In the 
arts, Miller warned, Gresham's Law prevails as surely as it does in economics. 
"Bad money drives out good." 
</P>
<P>
"Theater in New York is dead, kaput," Miller said. That was the bottom line of 
it, and that was what happened when theater became so "privatized" (a favorite 
word in England just now) that only a show that could provide its investors a 
quick return could survive. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be seduced into thinking that that which does not make a profit is 
without value," Miller told the crowd at the dinner in his honor after the 
show. "We all know that people who know the price of everything but the value 
of nothing are impoverished." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, back in London, an M.P. was arguing that it was stupid to preserve 
the ruins of an Elizabethan theater, the Rose, at the expense of a new office 
block. It could happen here.

GETTING THE LOWDOWN ON REBA MCENTIRE; 
</P>
<P>
SHE WAS IN THE RIGHT SPOT WHEN COUNTRY FANS TIRED OF 'URBAN COWBOY' POP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Oozing down-home charm, Reba McEntire -- the reigning queen of country music -- 
is perky, friendly and outgoing. Candor is one of her assets too. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll talk about anything," said the quintessential good ol' girl, whose 16th 
album, appropriately titled "Sweet Sixteen," is already No. 11 on the country 
charts. "You name it." 
</P>
<P>
Even K.T. Oslin? 
</P>
<P>
"You bet," she replied without skipping a beat. 
</P>
<P>
Oslin is the sophisticated, ultra-contemporary singer-songwriter who many 
country music insiders think is inching ahead of McEntire in the hearts of 
country fans. Recently, she's been winning many of the awards -- notably, the 
Country Music Assn. and Academy of Country Music honors -- that McEntire used 
to collect routinely. But listening to McEntire gush about Oslin, you wouldn't 
know they're rivals. 
</P>
<P>
"K.T.'s a real spitfire -- very unpredictable," said the 33-year-old McEntire. 
"Me and her are good friends. I love her singing. I love her albums. I nearly 
wore out her first album listening to it on my (tour) bus. My bus driver got 
sick of it because I played it so much. But I never got sick of it." 
</P>
<P>
Is McEntire concerned about Oslin's apparent takeover? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't look at myself as a queen of anything," McEntire said. "I'm just ol' 
Reba, singing and performing the best I can." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to aw-shucks humility, McEntire is hard to beat. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent local visit, she did a guest spot on a morning talk show, then 
later headed for a TV studio to tape another. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all part of making me more visible to folks," said McEntire. "A lot of 
people outside of country haven't heard of me. We're trying to fix that." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
McEntire is a pure country vocalist, appealing to the hard-core fans. Singing 
in an old-fashioned, Pasty Cline-influenced style, she displays a melodious, 
affecting, high-pitched wail, neatly applicable to those tear-jerking country 
tales. 
</P>
<P>
On her last two MCA albums, McEntire has been trying to broaden her appeal, 
using songs like Etta James' bluesy "Sunday Kind of Love" and the Everly 
Brothers' "Cathy's Clown" -- the first single off "Sweet Sixteen." Her previous 
LP, "Reba," has been near the top of the country charts for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunday Kind of Love" in particular revealed a new dimension of her vocal 
talent -- a strong pop/bluesy style she rarely gets to use. But if it was up to 
her hard-core audience, she wouldn't use it again any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview, Stan Campbell, program director of country station 
KLAC, noted: "That song didn't go over well with her audience. Bluesy songs 
never work well with country audiences. Anyway, Reba has that hard-core country 
audience that doesn't want her to go too far astray." 
</P>
<P>
It seems that experimentation with other musical styles has coincided with the 
Oslin threat. 
</P>
<P>
"K.T. didn't have anything to do with it," McEntire insisted. "I wanted to make 
a few changes. I was tired of singing the same old ballads. I just wanted to 
try something a little different -- for my own satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
An Oklahoma native who was discovered in 1974 singing the national anthem at a 
rodeo, McEntire struggled through the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
She emerged from the pack in the post-"Urban Cowboy" period when pop influences 
had flooded country and threatened to sink traditional country music. When the 
country world threw off some of those pop shackles, McEntire was one of the 
artists leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my time," McEntire said of her emergence in the mid-1980s. "I had 
worked hard building an audience, refining my style." 
</P>
<P>
But it was more than that. 
</P>
<P>
KLAC's Campbell cited other factors, starting with her record producer: "When 
she started working with Jimmy Bowen, she really came into her own. He's God in 
Nashville. And, of course, she started getting better material. Also, things 
changed for her when she went to MCA, a major label. It's tough making it when 
you're recording for those independent labels. They just don't have the 
resources. When those things happened, that's when Reba really took off." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very dull," McEntire said when asked about her private life. "There's no 
scandal, nothing that would interest the National Enquirer. If their readers 
had to read about what I did, they'd fall asleep." 
</P>
<P>
The closest thing to a scandal in McEntire's life was her divorce a few years 
ago from rodeo champion Charlie Battles after an 11-year marriage. "There was 
no great story there," she said. "I was in love and then I fell out of love. 
Fans were upset about it. They don't like to see that stuff. They might have 
been more upset about it than I was." 
</P>
<P>
To hear her talk, the life of a country music queen is one giant snore. 
</P>
<P>
"What do I do? I play golf and I work. I'm on the road just about all the time. 
I play 150 dates a year. That bus is my second home -- my real home actually. 
</P>
<P>
"Work is really my hobby," emphasized the singer, whose next local appearance 
is July 14 at the Celebrity Theatre. "I can't wait to work. Work is exciting, 
but it's still work. If you're looking for excitement, don't follow me around." 
</P>
<P>
The big change in her life, McEntire admitted, is that she's calmed down in the 
last few years. "I used to be so hyper," she said. "I'm more settled now." 
</P>
<P>
Did that change have anything to do with her divorce? 
</P>
<P>
"Could be," she said smugly. 
</P>
<P>
McEntire offered a nifty capsule summary of herself: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a decent person who's nice most of the time -- though not as much of the 
time as I'd like, actually. I'm just ol' Reba. I'm not very complicated. That's 
for other folks. I'm simple and I like it that way. What you see is what you 
get."

What am I looking forward to seeing this summer? All the shows that got past me 
this spring, starting with Taper Too's "Standup Tragedy." It transfers to the 
Taper mainstage on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Also -- "Phantom of the Opera," despite the buildup (Ahmanson, Wednesday.) John 
Steppling's "Teenage Wedding" -- a suspiciously cheerful title from our darkest 
playwright (Cast Theatre, July 1.) The Padua Hills Playwrights Playwrights 
Festival -- where Steppling and Jon Robin Baitz got started (CSU Northridge, 
Aug. 6.) Also -- Shakespeare at the Old Globe Theatre, San Diego, especially 
John Hirsch's staging of "Measure for Measure" (June 29). Romulus Linney's 
"Heathen Valley" -- a fable of Pharisees: it won last year's American Theatre 
Critics Assn. award (Gem Theatre, Aug. 18). "Fiddler on the Roof" with Topol 
(Pavilion, July 25.) Marlane Meyer's "The Geography of Luck" (LATC, Aug. 26). 
</P>
<P>
And much more. Theater slows down elsewhere in the summer. In Southern 
California it heats up.

Art buffs learn to live, like oriental sages, without hope or anticipation. If 
one is so rash as to hope that this or that exhibition will be marvelous the 
fates contrive to make it a turkey. If one is so unkind as to anticipate that 
this other show will be a dud the resulting bad karma turns it into the Taj 
Mahal just to prove we're not so smart. Better to wait in blissful neutrality. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand it is delicious to dream and what's the harm? It's just a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
I can't exactly anticipate the Frank Stella exhibition at the County Museum 
since I saw it already at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Stella's recent 
paintings are as big as baby elephants and almost as thick. They look like 
massive metal French curves dressed up to go dancing in sequins, glitter and 
popsicle colors. In New York they appeared the very embodiment of Manhattan's 
frenetic energy and pizzaz. I'm betting they are chameleons which L.A. will 
transform into exotic tribal objects. 
</P>
<P>
By now "A Forest of Signs" at the Museum of Contemporary Art has been open long 
enough to be seen by any interested citizen. It is all about how present 
artists use words or images that imply words. The presence of that show tempts 
one to anticipate "The Dada and Surrealist Word Image" coming to the County 
Museum of Art. It will be about how now-classic modern artists like Marcel 
Duchamp and Rene Magritte used words in their art decades before the young 
whippersnappers over at MOCA. Taken together the shows are liable to prove 
there is really nothing new under the inverted bowl we call the sky. But then 
we already knew that. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing seduces one to the sin of anticipation more than the promise of a 
really hard look at an artist who has been interesting in isolated glimpses. 
The Belgian Marcel Broodthaers turned up for years in European extravaganzas 
with one big absorbing piece per show. I remember one at a Documenta in Germany 
made up of old wheeled cannon and Victorian furniture. It had the literary 
density of a 19th century novel. Broodthaers inherited the Surrealist tradition 
then expanded it into the realm of environmental and conceptual art. One cannot 
resist hoping that the first survey of his work coming to MOCA is going to 
change one's life. 
</P>
<P>
you look at your cereal box like an artwork. But its the encounter that counts.

Eclecticism will be the keynote at the 11th annual Playboy Jazz Festival June 
17-18 at the Hollywood Bowl. For jazz-fusion fans there will be the likes of 
Stanley Clarke, George Duke and Spyro Gyra, but the cause of unhyphenated jazz 
will be well served by the big bands of Terry Gibbs and Illinois Jacquet, the 
combos of Art Blakey and Dave Brubeck, and a rare straight-ahead appearance by 
George Benson with the McCoy Tyner Trio. 
</P>
<P>
Among the five concerts scheduled for the "Jazz at the Bowl" summer series, the 
most intriguing is set for Aug. 9, with three big bands: Frank Foster leading 
the Basie ensemble, Mercer Ellington carrying on his father's legacy, and Louie 
Bellson with his always exciting ensemble, plus Carmen McRae as guest soloist. 
</P>
<P>
Not all this summer jazz is confined to the stage. Eagerly awaited is the 
appearance June 23-24, at Catalina's in Hollywood, of an international 17-piece 
orchestra led by George Gruntz, the Swiss born composer who for many years has 
been musical director of the Berlin Jazz Festival. This will be the band's 
first Southland gig.

With only two of the summer's entries out of the starting gate, "Indiana Jones 
and the Last Crusade" and "Pink Cadillac," almost everything remains 
unpreviewed. I am most looking forward to: "Dead Poets Society," "Batman," 
"Distant Voices, Still Lives," "Do the Right Thing," and "Great Balls of Fire."

<P>
For those who prefer to look back in pleasure, the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art's summer program is Fridays and Saturdays through July and is one of 
popular demand. It will include "Around the World in Eighty Days," "The 
Uninvited," restored or re-struck prints of "King Kong," "Gone With the Wind," 
"A Star is Born" and the first showing in 25 years of "The High and the 
Mighty."

<P>
For those who like to be on the crest of the wave of the future, the Academy of 
Motion Picture Arts and Science's 16th annual Student Film Awards June 11 will 
present the winners of its national competition. Most times this is bracing; at 
others, when you feel that students are using television as reality, it's 
dispiriting; there's no way to know but to see and judge for yourself. (This is 
free and open to the public, but tickets must be obtained by contacting the 
Academy: (213) 278-8990, ext. 233).

COOLING WATERS TO EXPLORE FOR SUMMER FUN IN THE SOUTHLAND

Summer fun seekers can cool off by riding rafts and waves without encountering 
a single jellyfish or strand of seaweed -- at the Southland's four water parks. 
Here's what they offer: 
</P>
<P>
RAGING WATERS, 111 Raging Waters Drive, San Dimas, claims to be the largest 
water-adventure theme park in the West and covers 44 acres. The park offers 
more than 25 water slides and flume rides, ranging from high-speed to kiddie 
level. A 3-acre "Typhoon Beach" features a lagoon surrounded by sunbathing 
areas and children's activities. 
</P>
<P>
The "Wave Cove," a simulated ocean where 3-foot waves crash on a somewhat sandy 
shore, is one of the featured attractions. The park's newest attraction, "The 
Bermuda Triangle," promises to bolt water sliders through three 100-foot long, 
spiral tunnels. Other slide rides include "The Screamer," which shoots the 
thrill-seeker down eight stories at up to 25 m.p.h. before splashdown. 
"Dropout," takes sliders to speeds of up to 40 m.p.h.

THE SAN DIEGO WILD ANIMAL PARK: A HIDE 'N' SEEKERS' HABITAT

<P>
Welcome to Sunday in the Parks with Calendar -- the Sequel. And please fasten 
your seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
For our second annual survey of Southern California's major theme parks, our 
intrepid reporters visited the parks on a recent Sunday, unannounced. 
Accompanied by family or a friend, they bought tickets, stood in lines, sampled 
the park's rides and menus and withered in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, they put in calls to the various park publicists for assistance in 
compiling our comparison chart. (Some of those publicists would have preferred 
that we attend their parks during special "media days" -- when the parks 
operate without a glitch and are especially clean and when we might have been 
wooed with "cuts" in line, as well as special edibles.) 
</P>
<P>
It's no surprise that Sundays in the park have changed since the serene 
turn-of-the-century depiction "Sunday Afternoon on the Island of the Grande 
Jatte," by French artist Georges Seurat, (the inspiration for our 
illustrations). In fact, Sundays keep on changing, as the parks continue in 
their mania to always be one step/ride/attraction ahead of the competition. So 
how do they measure up? Read on: 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Wild Animal Park, just east of Boiling Cauldron and immediately 
west of Raging Inferno, creates a nice cozy environment akin to the inside of a 
hamburger cooking in a microwave. Since there is very little else to do in the 
park, the line for the monorail -- a creaky 50-minute guided tour of the park 
-- is an excruciating 35 minutes. Because of the heat, it seems more like six 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Patrons waiting in line for the monorail are treated to a light mist that's 
meant for the growing bamboo. It's not enough. 
</P>
<P>
The park is a pleasant-enough place to walk around on a Sunday afternoon, sort 
of like a visit to the set of the old "Daktari" television show. Except you saw 
more animals on the TV show. 
</P>
<P>
The park's animal shows are almost obnoxiously cute, geared toward the average 
4-year-old Muppet Babies fan. Grand finale of the new Australian show is a 
kangaroo jumping over some posts. Not exactly the stuff of "Wild Kingdom." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the quickie shows, the only real time killer -- other than spending 
money in the imitation African gift shop -- is the monorail ride. 
</P>
<P>
It winds through the 700-acre park, where animals roam relatively free, 
allowing people glimpses of them in environments somewhat similar to their 
natural habitats. 
</P>
<P>
(Folks willing to fork over $50 each are taken by truck right up to the 
animals.) 
</P>
<P>
The monorail affords great views of elephants, elephant keepers gingerly 
cleaning up after elephants, thousands of deer-like creatures and a few 
bored-looking rhinos. It also provides a stunning view of the people in the 
trucks who get to see the animals up close. 
</P>
<P>
Right after boarding the monorail, our monotone-voiced tour guide -- with 
glazed expression and perky humor reminiscent of the Osmond clan, circa 1971 -- 
warns visitors of the dangers of the ride. To summarize: Passengers who jump 
out of the tram might hurt themselves, so the park advises against it. Now, let 
the thrills begin. 
</P>
<P>
Tip: Sit on the right side of the tram. People sitting on the left get a great 
view of California shrubbery, and little else. 
</P>
<P>
Because it's "baby season" at the park through June, there are lots of baby 
animals wandering around. Of course, visitors taking the 2 p.m. tram almost 
certainly won't see them since most of the animals are sleeping in the shade. 
Animals are not stupid. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the animals don't seem to mind the tram, but they don't exactly 
rush out to greet it, either. Visitors take their chances. The animals may be 
in sight; or maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
Given our guide's monotone style, and prepared speech, she did not seem to 
notice whether the animals did or didn't appear. 
</P>
<P>
"If we pass something that I don't mention, it means that I think we'll see it 
later," she said, oh-so-sweetly. 
</P>
<P>
Translation: Don't ask any questions and keep your suggestions to yourself. The 
condescending tone permeated the tour. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the tour concentrates on the park's wildly successful breeding 
programs. In fact, judging from our tour guide's talk, the park is some sort of 
animal fantasy land -- a kind of animal heaven. 
</P>
<P>
An animal recently released into the park was "eating, drinking and reproducing 
within a week," the guide revealed. Oh, the park's rhinos also have a 
"Jacuzzi." 
</P>
<P>
After listening to the patter, and spending 15 minutes watching gazelle graze, 
a park visitor begins to hope for something to happen. Anything. 
</P>
<P>
According to the guide, a certain kind of gazelle is able to escape a charging 
cheetah. OK, then, let's see it . . . quick, someone, let a cheetah loose. 
</P>
<P>
Now, that would make the trip worth the price of admission. KEVIN BRASS

MAGIC MOUNTAIN: BABY, IT'S TOASTY OUTSIDE

Welcome to Sunday in the Parks with Calendar -- the Sequel. And please fasten 
your seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
For our second annual survey of Southern California's major theme parks, our 
intrepid reporters visited the parks on a recent Sunday, unannounced. 
Accompanied by family or a friend, they bought tickets, stood in lines, sampled 
the park's rides and menus and withered in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, they put in calls to the various park publicists for assistance in 
compiling our comparison chart. (Some of those publicists would have preferred 
that we attend their parks during special "media days" -- when the parks 
operate without a glitch and are especially clean and when we might have been 
wooed with "cuts" in line, as well as special edibles.) 
</P>
<P>
It's no surprise that Sundays in the park have changed since the serene 
turn-of-the-century depiction "Sunday Afternoon on the Island of the Grande 
Jatte," by French artist Georges Seurat, (the inspiration for our 
illustrations). In fact, Sundays keep on changing, as the parks continue in 
their mania to always be one step/ride/attraction ahead of the competition. So 
how do they measure up? Read on: 
</P>
<P>
There may be no record that Buster Poindexter ever visited Six Flags Magic 
Mountain, but it's a cinch his biggest hit could be adopted as the park's theme 
song. Magic Mountain, cradled in arid Valencia about an hour northeast of L.A. 
Civic Center, is hot, hot, hot. 
</P>
<P>
It was particularly withering one Sunday when the temperature climbed to a 
desertlike 90 degrees -- a harbinger of arid, blistering summer days ahead. 
</P>
<P>
To its credit, the management of the 260-acre amusement center has imported a 
veritable forest over the past couple decades, artificially offering some 
shade. There are also lean-tos and all manner of shade-shelters erected outside 
the more popular rides so patrons will not fry, die or sue due to heat 
prostration while they wait an hour or more for a 3-minute thrill ride. 
</P>
<P>
One of the newer and more innovative anti-boredom systems for those sweating 
minions waiting in line is a clever series of strategically placed TV monitors 
that offer music videos and advertisements for assorted goings-on in the park. 
As moms, dads and kids shuffle through, they can watch the same TV they left at 
home in order to get out in the world and have fun in the great outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Mountain, which calls itself "the park that cares about you," makes a 
tradition of opening a blockbuster ride each year. The most recent additions: a 
kind of high-rise whirlybird called Condor and a sort of high-speed ski lift 
without the skis, Ninja. (The latter premiered last summer.) 
</P>
<P>
Condor, which opened late last year, had no line at all at high noon. Maybe 
that's because it's on the south side of the park where there are few trees and 
less shade. Or maybe it's the ride itself, which consists of about 2 minutes of 
twirling at the top of a 112-foot pole -- leaving even the healthiest adult 
nauseous. 
</P>
<P>
The park's chief attraction remains Colossus: the biggest and -- since the 
razing of Long Beach's Cyclone Racer more than 20 years ago -- most frightening 
roller coaster on the West Coast. Riders have been known to throw up, shriek in 
abject horror and shake for a full 15 minutes after a first trip around the 
monster's tracks. There are at least two spots where it appears that the entire 
Lakers basketball team could be decapitated if they were to stand up from their 
seats. If a true thrill seeker is prepared to spend an hour in line, there's no 
better ride in the park. 
</P>
<P>
Runners-up include Z-Force (riders hang upside down from a swinging gondola in 
such a manner that a sheer drop of about four stories to the pavement below 
seems like a certainty) and Roaring Rapids, which had the longest line (81 
minutes) in the park. The great thing about this artificial white-water river 
raft trip is that riders get wet. Or, rather, drenched. On a toaster-oven 
Sunday when the lines just to buy a $1.85 ice cream cone are 10 minutes long, a 
good soaking in Roaring Rapids will keep a Magic Mountaineer cool for two hours 
-- longer if pants or skirt are made of denim. 
</P>
<P>
(Footnote to thrill-ride fans: Shock Wave, the stand-up roller coaster that 
once ranked as the park's baaaadest ride, is no longer here. "I think we moved 
it to our park in Georgia," said a park employee. Bummer!) 
</P>
<P>
The newest attraction, opening next Sunday, also promises to be wet. Though it 
was still under construction during this reporter's visit, Tidal Wave had the 
look of a damp roller coaster. Park-ride designers say the idea is to drop 
patrons down a 98-foot chute into a 20-foot high wall of water -- something 
like experiencing a prefab flash flood. 
</P>
<P>
Though the park obviously caters to adolescent adrenaline, teen-agers with lots 
of disposable income are not the only ones who can happily saute on a summer's 
day at Magic Mountain. There are the obligatory dolphin shows, fireworks 
displays and life-sized renditions of Warner Bros. cartoon characters wandering 
around the park like visions from a nightmare. Also, Tweety, Bugs Bunny and 
Porky Pig, among others, put on a stage show near Bugs Bunny World, which 
houses mini-thrill rides for the stroller set. DENNIS McDOUGAL

HOUSE MUSIC: THE BLUES FOR DANCE; 
</P>
<P>
THE NEW SOUND PUMPS UP THE VOLUME AND EYES A MOVE FROM R &amp; B UNDERGROUND TO 
THE POP MAINSTREAM 
</P>

<P>
The place: the Warehouse Club in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The time: late Saturday night, some time in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene: Frankie Knuckles stands at the mixing console in the deejay booth, 
surveying the colorful Chicago characters "jacking" their bodies on the dance 
floor. Knuckles is pleased -- he realizes that the Saturday-night "parties" 
he's been throwing at the Warehouse since arriving from New York in 1977 have 
already transformed the Windy City dance-club scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that creating a new sound had been on his mind -- it was just that the 
dance records coming out of New York at the time lacked something. It wasn't 
hard for Knuckles to improve them by restructuring and rearranging the rhythm 
tracks at home, either on his drum machines or by jamming with his 
percussionist friend who played live to the tracks at the Warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the element Knuckles really enjoys about the Warehouse, being able to 
put some of his own musical ideas into practice on new records, or expanding on 
the deep, danceable R&amp;B of the old Philly soul records he cherishes. He 
loves watching the dancers move to records that are now as much his as the 
recording artist's, and he takes pride in the compliments that come his way 
afterward: "Oh, new record, huh? Is that a new mix on it? Who did that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Knuckles dreams of one day sliding into the record industry and becoming a 
producer. But Knuckles never suspects that the music he's playing at the 
Warehouse is inspiring a host of younger club deejays and would-be producers . 
. . or that the sound that develops will soon acquire a name, a variant of 
Warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 They call it house music. 
</P>
<P>
 House music didn't stop in Chicago. The sound is now the latest contender to 
move into the pop mainstream from the R&amp;B underground. The style was 
initially developed and dominated by deejays and/or producers in Chicago 
releasing 12-inch singles that made a strong mark on the East Coast and 
European dance-club scenes. Now house music is international in scope, and the 
emphasis is shifting toward a fresh crop of artists. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the major labels are about to launch some of kind of house 
assault, because they're scooping up everybody out in Chicago," said Marshall 
Jefferson, one of the most influential and prolific of the early house 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
"They look on it as the next big type of music, and I don't particularly like 
that," he continued. "I want house to have variety because that's when people 
can get innovative and not have to worry about sounding like the latest fad." 
</P>
<P>
What exactly is house music? 
</P>
<P>
It's bop-till-you-drop dance music that recalls the 120-plus beats-per-minute 
music of the disco era. But house music packs stronger bass lines than disco, 
and the minor-key melodies often create a moody undercurrent. 
</P>
<P>
"The main difference I find between disco and house is that disco was a lot 
happier sounding, a lot more jolly," explained producer David Cole. "House 
music is almost like the blues for dance -- it has the same intensity, the same 
feeling and indescribable emotions that the blues has." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles clubs specializing in house music are usually underground affairs 
that shift their location each week, but dance music fans throughout America 
may already be familiar with house -- although not by that name. House mixes 
have become de rigueur for any artist attempting to court the dance audience, 
from Samantha Fox and Debbie Gibson to Natalie Cole and the Tom Tom Club. 
Prince gave a nod to the style with the song "Housequake" on his "Sign 'O' the 
Times" album. 
</P>
<P>
Clouding the identification issue are the several variations the style has 
spawned, like the more electronic version known as "acid house" that became a 
pop sensation in England last year. American listeners got a taste when "Pump 
Up the Volume" by M/A/R/R/S became a hit here last year. 
</P>
<P>
"House is going through the same thing that rap went through," said producer 
Cole. "When rap first came out, it had to make its mark. It had to say, 'I'm 
here and I'm not going anywhere. What's your move?' That's where house is now." 
</P>
<P>
The roots of house lie in the danceable R&amp;B of Philly soul and other early 
'70s grooves that led into the disco era. Like the reggae "dub" music of the 
mid-'70s, house producers and artists frequently engage in guerrilla warfare on 
a song by using studio technology to manipulate the melodies over the 
stripped-down rhythm tracks. Some artists, particularly in the acid-house 
arena, rely heavily on sampling (using snippets of other songs, TV shows or 
speeches) for hooks or to create collage-type melodies. 
</P>
<P>
The music industry has acknowledged the ability of house deejays and producers 
to enhance a song by releasing house mixes of their artists' material. Most 
originators of the house sound caution that "house" mixes by commercial pop 
artists may use all the right techniques -- but that doesn't guarantee that the 
result will be a house record. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many things that create a house groove," said Cole. "Some things 
have the elements that are considered to be house, but it's not the elements. I 
hate to be corny but it's almost a vibe, a sense of energy, that is created by 
those elements." 
</P>
<P>
Like most invigorating pop movements, house took off when fans took matters 
into their own hands. Following Knuckles' lead in the early '80s, Chicago 
deejays began recording house tracks on 4-track tape machines at home with 
synthesizers and drum machines. They'd then play the tapes at their clubs. 
</P>
<P>
David Cole moved from live jamming at a New York dance club to playing 
keyboards on dance re-mixes for producer Arthur Baker and his current 
production partnership with deejay Robert Clivilles. Marshall Jefferson 
describes himself as a "headbanger" rock guitarist in his pre-house days. 
</P>
<P>
"Rock 'n' roll didn't seem like a rebellious art form any more so I vacated it 
in '83," Jefferson explained. "The house crowd was a really rebellious crowd. 
They didn't go for what played on the radio, and they seemed to take pride in 
enjoying a song because it was good and nobody else knew about it." 
</P>
<P>
Twelve-inch house singles began being released about 1985 on home-grown labels 
like Trax Chicago Connection and DJs International. The groups Jesse's Gang and 
J. M. Silk landed major label deals in 1987 with Geffen and RCA, respectively, 
but their records failed to dent the charts. 
</P>
<P>
"House was underground here because black radio stations by and large don't 
like that kind of 'clubby' music," says Brian Chin, director of artists and 
repertoire for Profile Records. " 'That's the Way Love Is' by Ten City was a 
real breakthrough record 
</P>
<P>
on black radio because it reached the Top 20. But all the breakthroughs have 
happened this year in America." 
</P>
<P>
Says Ten City lead singer Byron Stingily, "We felt that no one had stuck by 
their guns and followed through on this dance-music scene. Before, people in 
Chicago got their major label record deals and suddenly wanted to do 
commercial, crossover music. We decided to do what we do best, and we know it's 
going to pay off in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
House became a major force in England when J. M. Silk's "Jack Your Body" became 
a No. 1 pop hit in 1986. The big development was acid house, which spiced 
heavily electronic rhythm tracks with collages of "samples" and blossomed into 
a full-blown movement, with the happy-face smile button as its fashion 
trademark. 
</P>
<P>
Acid house clubs attempted to create a total environment with scented, colored 
smoke and dry ice machines; some even reportedly featured swimming pools next 
to the dance floors. The movement became a cause celebre in Britain due to the 
reported heavy use of psychedelic drugs, and clubs were forced underground or 
out of existence. 
</P>
<P>
But you won't find many acid house fans among the earliest house artists. 
</P>
<P>
"There might have been two acid records that I liked and it's only because they 
balanced 'em out with an acoustic piano," said Frankie Knuckles. "It added an 
element of realness to it because there was one instrument that kept it from 
being totally electronic. Most of it was garbage to me." 
</P>
<P>
Is house music destined to become a household word in pop music? 
</P>
<P>
Its immediate future certainly is bright. Veteran house producers like 
Knuckles, Jefferson and the Cole-Clivilles team have progressed from doing 
dance re-mixes to production projects for major labels in Europe and here. As 
house becomes more accepted, they're starting to work with bigger names in the 
R&amp;B field. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest development is the new surge of artists. And more are on the way. 
Ten City established house as a potential force on black radio with "That's the 
Way Love Is," and the Detroit-based Inner City duo featuring producer Kevin 
Saunderson has made inroads with its "Good Life" single. 
</P>
<P>
Jive Records has opened a Chicago office and signed artists like vocalist Liz 
Torres and producer Adonis. Motown signed the production team Blaze, and Steve 
Hurley of J. M. Silk just signed with Atlantic. The acid house group 
S-Express's debut album will be released soon by Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
The best recorded introduction to the R&amp;B-rooted house style are Profile's 
pair of two-record compilations, "Best of House Music" and "Gotta Have House." 
A number of acid house singles have been dance-chart hits recently, and other 
house compilation albums are beginning to be released. 
</P>
<P>
Acid house may benefit from the commercial cachet of being an Anglo hip trip, 
but it could also suffer from fickleness of the trendy set in the long run. A 
more promising move on the R&amp;B side is the potential merger of hip hop and 
house elements: Rob Base's hit "It Takes Two" and the Jungle Brothers' "I'll 
House You" have been cited as harbingers of a new "hip house" hybrid. 
</P>
<P>
"Rap and house were polar opposites before, because rap people often found club 
music to be too effeminate, too sissy for them," said Profile Records' Chin. 
"Merging rap with house didn't occur until last year but it's been a 
tremendously powerful combination because it's got the tough approach of rap 
and the persuasive, accessible things about house music." 
</P>
<P>
But the future of house rests on the artists' resisting the temptation to crank 
out formulaic grooves to capitalize on its trendy status. 
</P>
<P>
"All it takes is people at the head of the field to do quality music and not 
worry about sales," said Jefferson. "The only roadblock is that radio 
programming as it is today is resistant to a new sound."

<TEXT>
<P>
This is the way the war on drugs is being fought: not with a bang but a thud. 
</P>
<P>
Laboring in 90-degree heat under the vast roof of a U.S. Customs Service shed 
on the Miami waterfront, sweat-soaked Florida National Guardsmen in camouflage 
fatigues are heaving 75-pound burlap bags of Haitian orange rind onto a 
forklift. The aromatic bags, enough of them to fill a 40-foot cargo container, 
will be sniffed, poked, slit open and X-rayed in hopes of discovering illicit 
drugs hidden inside. 
</P>
<P>
None will be found among the orange rinds this day. Nor will the guardsmen find 
any drugs in the next cargo van, containing hundreds of crates of organically 
grown Haitian mangoes. Nor in the boxes of T-shirts from Jamaica, nor in the 
cans of carburetor cleaner from Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't rocket science. This is labor. And it takes a lot of labor to find 
dope," said Frank Mullin, a supervisor with customs' Contraband Enforcement 
Team in Miami, who oversees the guardsmen down on the docks. 
</P>
<P>
Calling out the National Guard is a new and still controversial tactic in the 
frustrating national campaign against narcotics. Congress ordered a reluctant 
Pentagon to spend $300 million this year to try to seal the nation's borders 
against a tide of illegal cocaine, marijuana and heroin. State National Guard 
units will spend $40 million of the funds to assist local law enforcement 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
And in this, as in most other approaches to the nation's drug problems, there 
are sharp disagreements about whether the effort is effective or desirable. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really been a big help to have these guys here," said the Customs 
Service's Mullin. National Guard leaders, and a surprising number of 
participating guardsmen, also strongly support the program. Some of them offer 
deeply felt testimony about the ravages of drugs in their neighborhoods and 
their desire to respond. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of crack cocaine and a lot of crime in my area," said one 
guardsmen, an unemployed worker from northern Florida, as he unloaded boxes of 
gloves from Jamaica for inspection. "This is a good thing for the Guard. I'm 
behind it 100%." 
</P>
<P>
"My house was broken into" by drug users in search of money or goods to trade 
for dope, he said, explaining why he had volunteered for a form of duty so 
different from anything he had done in 12 years of service in the Guard. 
</P>
<P>
Many career members of the regular armed forces are less supportive of using 
the military against drugs. They generally view anti-drug assignments as costly 
and unhelpful diversions from their real mission -- preparing to defend the 
nation against foreign enemies. 
</P>
<P>
"No sane person wants to sit on a dock and check suitcases," said one 
active-duty Army general. "That doesn't train you for (anything), unless you 
want to be a customs agent." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of such opinions, Congress has become increasingly insistent on 
using the military in the war on drugs. And the Guard is likely to remain a 
part of that. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Guard units in eight states have begun drug-interdiction efforts, 
involving about 800 Guard members, officials in Washington said. Florida, with 
$3.4 million earmarked for its program, has the largest share of the $40 
million the Guard will spend this year. Texas and California have the 
next-biggest programs, using guardsmen at seaports, airports and highway border 
crossings to assist the Customs Service and Drug Enforcement Administration and 
Border Patrol agents in searching for dope. 
</P>
<P>
In California, Guard members have been manning border checkpoints south of San 
Diego and have been sent to the docks at the ports of Los Angeles, Long Beach 
and San Diego to inspect cargo, as they are doing in Florida. California's 
program has a $1-million budget for this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 Florida guardsmen have been working with customs agents at Florida 
seaports and airports since April 28 in a program dubbed "Operation Guardian." 
They assisted in two seizures this month at Miami International Airport, 
confiscating a total of 385 pounds of cocaine being ferried in on flights from 
Guatemala and Panama. 
</P>
<P>
"The object is to create some turmoil in these major cocaine cartels who are 
using cargo to ship their cocaine," said Howard L. Cooperman, regional director 
of the Customs Service's South Florida inspection unit. "Hopefully this 
disruption will cause them to make mistakes -- and keep the cocaine out." 
</P>
<P>
Cooperman estimates that 40% of the cocaine entering South Florida arrives by 
air or sea, concealed in legitimate commercial cargo, sometimes without the 
knowledge of the shipper. Most of the freight arrives in sealed containers -- 
20- and 40-foot trailers identical to those pulled by trucks on the highway -- 
and inspecting them all is impossible, customs officials admit. 
</P>
<P>
"We get 110,000 containers a year just in the port of Miami, most of them from 
Central and South America and the Caribbean," Cooperman said. Nationwide, the 
total is nearly 8 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
With its own current manpower, customs can inspect only about 3% to 4% of all 
shipments; with the help of the Guard, customs hopes to look at 10% to 12% of 
the containers. Customs is also upgrading its computerized tracking and 
target-identification systems, hoping to pinpoint suspicious cargo for thorough 
inspection. 
</P>
<P>
In a three-week pilot program last summer called "Operation Flete" (Spanish for 
freight), members of the Florida National Guard worked with customs agents to 
inspect incoming cargo. But no drugs were found, Cooperman acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
"We still feel it's helping, even though we didn't make any seizures in last 
year's operation," he said. "The bad guys held off, according to our 
intelligence. Now we're working with the Guard for an indefinite period of 
time. . . . They're out there for deterrence." 
</P>
<P>
Down at the Miami docks, the guardsmen toil in brutal conditions. The 
temperature on the loading dock is 90 degrees. Inside the unventilated aluminum 
cargo vans, the heat rises to a suffocating 130 degrees. The only relief comes 
from big portable floor fans. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers would not allow themselves to be photographed or identified by 
name, fearing reprisals from local drug dealers. All are volunteers earning 
their normal National Guard duty pay of about $45 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Most National Guard officials have enthusiastically accepted the anti-drug 
mission in marked contrast to their counterparts in the regular armed forces, 
who have shrunk from the assignment, arguing that they are soldiers, not cops. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon contends that drug duty diverts the military from its chief job of 
defending the country against foreign enemies, wastes expensive training hours 
and consumes equipment that should be used for combat readiness. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is important . . . that we not expect men and women who are trained 
to function in military units to simultaneously double as law enforcement 
officers capable of making arrests and safeguarding the rights of the accused," 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said during his confirmation hearings in March. 
"So it is a delicate balance that is called for." 
</P>
<P>
The 19th-Century posse comitatus act forbids the military from carrying out 
domestic law enforcement duties. 
</P>
<P>
"I would love to be part of a search-and-destroy operation -- just blow these 
(drug dealers) away. Any good-thinking American would. But with posse 
comitatus, it's illegal," said an Army general. 
</P>
<P>
Guardsmen see things differently. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very strongly this is the No. 1 priority facing the nation. The problem 
is so great that every resource that is available should be put against it," 
said Maj. Gen. Robert F. Ensslin Jr., commander of the Florida National Guard 
and vice president of the National Guard Assn. of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Pentagon has been very reluctant to become involved and has tried 
to keep the effort at arm's length. It is partially because of the professional 
military mind set that says we don't get involved in law enforcement. Also, 
they see this as another one of these no-win situations. They don't see a quick 
victory, and there isn't going to be one regardless of what we do," Ensslin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not out there in the communities where the guardsmen are and see the 
damage that's being wreaked. If you live on an Army post, you don't see the 
damage and the violence that drugs are causing," he added. "My street leads to 
a hospital emergency ward. Guardsmen have a little different perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Although National Guard troops have been used in domestic police duties in the 
past -- enforcing civil rights laws in the South, keeping order during urban 
riots in the 1960s -- Guard officials are careful to point out that guardsmen 
are acting only in a supporting role to civilian agencies and have not been 
given arrest powers. 
</P>
<P>
If a guardsman on a loading dock or highway checkpoint spots a suspicious 
package or vehicle, he is to report it to his counterpart at customs or the 
Border Patrol. A National Guard helicopter pilot flying patrol off the coast 
must radio the Coast Guard if he spots suspected drug activity. Guardsmen 
staking out suspected aircraft landing strips or marijuana patches report 
sightings to the local sheriff, state police, DEA or the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
"It's purely an assistance role that doesn't confront us as soldiers with the 
civilian population," said Missouri Adjutant Gen. Charles M. Kiefner, president 
of the National Guard Assn. "The rules of engagement are such that we're taught 
to go to war and fight other armies, not our own people." 
</P>
<P>
Congress, which imposed the drug job on the military, is unhappy with the 
Pentagon's apparent lack of commitment to the task. Of the $300 million 
appropriated for the fiscal year beginning last Oct. 1, only about $50 million 
has been spent, half of that for National Guard activities. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a disgraceful record," said Sen. Alphonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.). 
</P>
<P>
D'Amato and Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) 10 days ago introduced legislation to 
create an anti-drug task force within the Pentagon, complete with a joint staff 
and a three-star military commander. The Pentagon rejects the new unit as 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
"The Defense Department is AWOL when it comes to aggressively mobilizing its 
resources against drug traffickers," Wilson said. "In the meantime, the number 
of casualties on our streets continues to rise." 
</P>
<P>
Back on Miami's sun-seared docks, the guardsmen sweat and heave in a tedious 
routine whose reward remains frustratingly abstract. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the money that's the incentive for these guys," said Capt. Tony 
Barbarette of the Florida Army National Guard. "It's not glamorous. You're not 
running around in speedboats and helicopters. You're just out here busting your 
butt every day."

FOR SOME CHINESE, LIVING BY THE NUMBERS IS SAFEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Emblazoned in 3-foot-high characters on the side of a medical office building 
in Monterey Park are the numbers 941-943. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers are merely the building's address, but when the numerals 9, 4, 1, 3 
are pronounced in Mandarin or Cantonese dialects, they sound like a common 
Chinese saying: "Nine die; one lives." 
</P>
<P>
"It means the possibility of surviving is almost zero," said one real estate 
agent, shaking his head in disbelief. "Imagine a medical building with that 
number? I won't even mention the property to a client." 
</P>
<P>
Now consider the BMW 528e, that trendy symbol of the American yuppie. In 
Cantonese, the model number is easily recognizable as the phrase: "Not easy to 
prosper." 
</P>
<P>
The first two digits of the Volvo 240 have the even more horrifying 
pronunciation: "Easy to die." 
</P>
<P>
"They're not popular cars" among Chinese, said Gregory Tse, owner of Wing On 
Realty in Monterey Park, the only city in the nation with a majority Asian 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the world of Chinese numerology, an amalgam of linguistic coincidences 
and age-old superstitions from the Far East that is exerting a quirky effect on 
American life in places where Asians have settled. 
</P>
<P>
The superstition has influenced choices on buying cars, selecting telephone 
numbers, picking lucky Lotto combinations and even determining wedding dates. 
</P>
<P>
But nowhere has it had a more far-reaching effect than in the world of 
commercial and residential real estate, especially in the San Gabriel Valley 
with its burgeoning Chinese population. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate agents say fear of the number four, which, when translated, sounds 
like the word "death," and the popularity of the number eight, which sounds 
like "prosperity," have become factors in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
Some deals have dangled in escrow waiting for a lucky date to close, prices 
have been determined by the number of eights in the final figure and even 
hardened investors have become squeamish when a property has the number four in 
its address. 
</P>
<P>
While many Chinese speakers are aware of the superstition, only some actually 
believe it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Double Meaning Recognized 
</P>
<P>
For example, in the Monterey Park building on 941-943 S. Atlantic Blvd., two of 
the eight offices are rented to Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
Yu Dafang, an acupuncturist who has an office in the building, said he 
recognized the double meaning of the address the minute he saw it, but decided 
it was unimportant. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, people said things, but not anymore," he said. "It's not polite." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, awareness about the effect of the superstition has spread to the 
point where even non-Chinese are now watching their numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Toni Foster-Quiroz, president of Cosmic Escrow Corp. in Monterey 
Park, opened a new office on Garvey Avenue. One of the first things she did was 
pay the city $500 to change the building's address from 114 to 116 to remove 
the number four. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Little Edge' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe it, but if it makes my clients feel better about coming here, 
it's OK with me," she said. "It gives us a little edge." 
</P>
<P>
The key to the superstition lies in the tonal nature of Chinese in which one 
pronunciation can have many meanings depending on which tone is used. 
</P>
<P>
Mandarin, the dialect spoken by those from Taiwan and parts of mainland China, 
has four tones; Cantonese, the dialect of Hong Kong and Guangdong province, has 
nine. 
</P>
<P>
The Cantonese, by most accounts, are the main followers of the superstitions. 
</P>
<P>
In that dialect, every digit except seven and zero has a clear dual meaning. 
The number one is the same as "certainly," two is "easy," three is "life, birth 
or to do business," four is "death," five is "no or not," six is "happiness, 
wealth or continuous," eight is "prosperity," and nine is "long lasting." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fascination With Numbers 
</P>
<P>
The fascination with numbers is more extensive in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore 
and other parts of Asia. In Singapore, properties are sometimes offered at a 
discount because of unlucky addresses and in Hong Kong, vehicle license plates 
with lucky numbers, which are competitively bid, can cost thousands of dollars 
to obtain. 
</P>
<P>
The most notorious of the numbers is four, and some buildings, such as the Bank 
of Trade building in Chinatown, have no fourth floor just because of the 
connotation of death. 
</P>
<P>
Woe be to the person with the address of 14, which sounds like the phrase: 
"certain death." The number 24 is a slight improvement, "easy to die." 
</P>
<P>
Watch out for 424, which in Mandarin is pronounced in the same way as "die and 
die again." 
</P>
<P>
Just having four anywhere in an address can be unsettling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Worried 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, architect C. K. Moh bought a rental house in Monterey Park 
with the address 434. 
</P>
<P>
Moh said he was not worried about the address when he bought the property, but 
later paid the city $500 to have it changed to 438 after he became involved in 
a lawsuit related to the property. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really believe in it, but, well, I'm trying to avoid bad luck," he 
said. "I'm playing it safe." 
</P>
<P>
City officials in Monterey Park report they receive two or three requests a 
month for address changes. The vast majority of applicants, who pay $500 for 
the service, are Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
Arcadia gets about 40 requests a month, all of which are futile because the 
City Council about two years ago banned address changes, said Joseph Lopez, 
director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Certain Lucky Combinations 
</P>
<P>
"There was such a large volume of requests," Lopez said. "If we made a change 
for every request, it would really create an intolerable work load." 
</P>
<P>
Four can be lucky in certain combinations, such as the number 154, which sounds 
like the phrase: "No way to die." Likewise, the pronunciation of the number 148 
closely resembles: "A lifetime of prosperity." 
</P>
<P>
Eight is by far the most sought-after number and the arrival of Aug. 8 last 
year -- 8/8/88 -- sparked a flurry of weddings, banquets and Lotto purchases in 
areas with large Chinese populations, such as San Francisco and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The reputation of the number is such that some sales people have latched onto 
it as a gimmick to attract Chinese buyers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Obvious Ploy' 
</P>
<P>
Georgene Neely, a San Marino real estate agent, said she has noticed in recent 
years that more home sellers are using the number in asking prices, such as a 
house that was recently on the market for $988,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an obvious ploy to appeal to the foreign buyer," she said, adding that 
she views the practice as unprofessional. 
</P>
<P>
Neely said buyers also have asked to add number eights to real estate prices 
for good luck, such as a recent lease agreement involving several thousand 
dollars in which the tenant added $1.88 to the final figure. 
</P>
<P>
But these digits are the easy cases. The meanings of other combinations can be 
open to a wide range of interpretation. Numbers that sound one way in one 
dialect also can sound entirely different in another. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'One of the Worst Numbers' 
</P>
<P>
Take the number 169. Mandarin speakers would shrug their shoulders, but to a 
Cantonese "it's one of the worst numbers you can have," said Valiant Chiu, the 
head of Garfield Realty in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
The number is pronounced like an obscene slang term. 
</P>
<P>
How much effect all this really has on business is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Brooks, spokesman for BMW of North American Inc., said he was unaware 
of the meaning of the BMW 528e, which coincidentally was discontinued last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But George Sarrade, sales manager of Century Motor Sales, a major BMW 
dealership in Alhambra, said he has noticed that the dealership has sold few 
528e models to Chinese. "Son of a gun," he said. "It might have something to do 
with that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blown Out of Proportion 
</P>
<P>
Most real estate agents say superstition's power to affect the market has been 
blown way out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Shen, manager of Huntington Realty in San Marino, said a good house at a 
good price will always sell no matter how bad the number. 
</P>
<P>
Shen, for example, lives in a house with the street number 404. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a lucky number for me," he said. "I don't even care. This is 
America." 
</P>
<P>
Tse of Wing On Realty agreed that the superstition plays only a small role in 
business. "It's minor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To prove his point, Tse mentions the recent sale of a house with the street 
number 664 -- a terribly inauspicious number that sounds like the phrase: 
"continuous death." 
</P>
<P>
"We just cleared escrow on the house," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Only later does he explain that the sale to a Chinese family was contingent on 
changing the address from 664 to 662, which means "always easy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NUMBER SUPERSTITIONS 
</P>
<P>
 In various Chinese dialects, some numbers sound like threatening phrases. 
Houses with such numbers may be considered unlucky; cars with such numbers may 
be shunned. On the other hand, the number 8 sounds lucky. Here are a few 
numbers and their "translations" in Chinese superstition.

GEPHARDT PLANS TO SEEK HOUSE LEADERSHIP POST

House Majority Whip Tony Coelho's stunning decision to resign from Congress 
prompted Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) on Saturday to put aside another 
presidential bid and join a Democratic leadership scramble already set in 
motion by House Speaker Jim Wright's expected resignation. 
</P>
<P>
When the smoke clears from the tumultuous downfalls of Wright (D-Tex.) and 
Coelho (D-Merced) in scandals over their finances, two Democratic moderates 
with a reputation for bipartisan consensus-building may hold the top House 
posts -- Rep. Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) as Speaker and Gephardt as majority 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Race for Coelho's Post 
</P>
<P>
At least three other Democrats are seeking Coelho's post, but the apparent 
front-runner is a Democratic campaign chieftain who has carried on Coelho's 
tradition of getting business interests to contribute heavily to Democratic 
candidates -- Rep. Beryl Anthony Jr. (D-Ark.). 
</P>
<P>
Coelho had planned to run for majority leader on the assumption that Foley, the 
incumbent, would move up to replace Wright. Then on Friday, he suddenly put out 
the word that he was resigning on his 47th birthday next month to spare his 
family, his House colleagues and himself the turmoil of intense inquiries into 
his financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
In a formal statement released Saturday, Coelho said that his ability to work 
for social change, for wider acceptance of the disabled and for his 
constituents and party "has been diminished by needless and baseless charges 
about my investments or private life." 
</P>
<P>
He maintained that his decision to step down was not "motivated by weakness in 
my political standing or my legal position." 
</P>
<P>
Coelho, who had rapidly climbed the leadership ladder after winning election to 
the House in 1978, faced a preliminary criminal investigation by the Justice 
Department and an expected House ethics inquiry into the purchase of a $100,000 
"junk bond" underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. with the help of a 
$50,000 loan from Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Gephardt let it be known through associates that he had been "persuaded to run" 
for House majority leader in the expectation that Wright would resign, possibly 
by Wednesday, and that Foley would become Speaker, almost certainly without 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Gephardt sought the Democratic presidential nomination last year, running 
largely on a trade protection plank. When he formally declares his candidacy, 
he will renounce any intention of making another bid for the White House in 
1992, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
In his only public comment, the St. Louis congressman said in a statement that 
he was "stunned and deeply saddened" by the decision of his "good friend," 
Coelho. Gephardt had told Coelho that he would not run for majority leader if 
Coelho sought the job. 
</P>
<P>
In the majority leader race, Gephardt will face opposition from Rep. Ed Jenkins 
(D-Ga.), a fellow member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. 
Jenkins, a leading advocate of limits on textile imports, has a voting record 
substantially more conservative than Gephardt's or Foley's. 
</P>
<P>
Gephardt, former head of the House Democratic Caucus, is regarded as the 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"He is seen as extremely bright and likable, with a great deal of integrity," 
said Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento). "His only potential negative would 
be that he is so consensus-oriented, sometimes it is hard to find the real 
Dick. That could be a problem in the leadership struggle because Foley also is 
not what you call clearly definable." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Matsui added, reflecting a widespread view, "a Foley-Gephardt team 
would be centrist in outlook and appeal to suburban America. They have 
extremely clean images and certainly would be an antidote for the times." 
</P>
<P>
Contesting with Anthony for the majority whip position so far are Reps. David 
E. Bonior (D-Mich.) and William H. Gray III (D-Pa.). Anthony is chairman of the 
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (Coelho's old post), Bonior is 
chief deputy whip and Gray is chairman of the House Democratic Caucus and 
former Budget Committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
If Foley, a Westerner, and Gephardt, a Midwesterner, are chosen as expected, 
the Democrats are likely to turn to Anthony, a Southerner, for regional 
balance, several lawmakers said. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony said a big plus in his favor is "the fact I was able to take over a 
reinvigorated campaign committee from Tony Coelho, who supposedly set 
fund-raising records that could never be broken. I methodically went out and 
broke each one of them." 
</P>
<P>
If Coelho steps down on his birthday, June 15, Gov. George Deukmejian will have 
14 days to proclaim a special election in the congressman's district, which 
includes the rich agricultural lands west of Highway 99, from the suburban 
fringes of Fresno north to Modesto. 
</P>
<P>
A general election there would be scheduled for the first Tuesday to fall 112 
days or more after the date of Deukmejian's proclamation. A single district 
primary election would be held eight Tuesdays before that, with all candidates 
entered regardless of party. 
</P>
<P>
Any candidate who received more than 50% of the vote in the primary would win 
the seat outright. If none did, the general election race would be between the 
Democrat and the Republican who got the most primary votes. Voter registration 
in the district is 56% Democratic and 35% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony predicted Saturday that Coelho's "bold, dramatic move" to resign would 
"shift the ethics focus off the Democrats right square onto" House Minority 
Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.). Gingrich, who prompted the House Ethics Committee 
probe of Wright, now faces a similar inquiry into his own financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich rejoined acidly: "For the first time in history, we're faced with two 
of the top three leaders of the House's majority party having to resign, and 
their campaign chairman says it is the other party that has a problem. This is 
like Richard Nixon's press secretary announcing that the President's 
resignation sure makes it tough on the Democrats."

NATO'S SUCCESS SPAWNS A NEW CRISIS FOR ALLIANCE

<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which will celebrate its 40th 
anniversary here Monday and Tuesday with a meeting of the heads of government 
of its 16 member nations, is struggling with a major crisis -- how to survive 
its own success. 
</P>
<P>
NATO's reason for being -- its deep-seated fear of the Soviet Union -- is 
receding in the face of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's bold, rapid 
moves to reduce arms levels. All of a sudden, the Soviet Union is accepting in 
principle NATO's demand to reduce the massive armies that have confronted each 
other across Europe's East-West divide since the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
So intense are the pressures these apparent concessions have generated inside 
NATO that President Bush has seemingly been forced to modify his go-slow, 
wait-and-see posture on arms control. Bush is expected to present his fellow 
NATO leaders with a proposal for removing more than 30,000 U.S. troops from 
Western Europe as part of an eventual U.S.-Soviet agreement on curbing 
conventional forces. 
</P>
<P>
Such a reduction, far bigger than previous U.S. proposals, reflects the 
pressure on Washington to catch up with dramatic maneuvering by the Soviet 
leader -- at least at the level of public relations. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev is dancing to our tune, to the principles of the Atlantic Alliance," 
said Paul H. Nitze, veteran U.S. arms negotiator and an expert on European 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
And NATO's very success has precipitated the fifth major crisis in its 40-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany, demonstrating a new-found independence within the alliance, has 
called on the other members to accept the Soviet offer of quick negotiations to 
reduce short-range nuclear missile forces in Europe. But the United States and 
Britain are not ready to abandon some of the weapons they believe have played 
an essential role in deterring Soviet aggression. 
</P>
<P>
The West German challenge was long in coming. NATO's first supreme commander, 
Dwight D. Eisenhower, said in 1950 -- as he took over military command of the 
fledgling alliance -- that he bore no resentment toward the defeated Germany 
and hoped it would "line up with the rest of the free world." 
</P>
<P>
It did, but only now has West Germany begun to speak out in a voice 
commensurate with its political and economic strength, rather than in the muted 
tones of the vanquished aggressor in World War II. And now that it is speaking 
out, it is doing so with considerable force. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not a great power," President Richard von Weizsaecker said last week in 
an address marking West Germany's 40th anniversary, "but we are also not a 
playing ball for others. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The need for NATO to move beyond a purely defensive military alliance was 
forecast from the start. George F. Kennan, in a 1947 article that helped give 
birth to NATO, wrote that the purpose of the West's containment policy toward 
the Soviet Union was not to perpetuate the conditions left in Europe by World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
"It was to tide us over a difficult time and bring us to a point where we could 
discuss effectively with the Russians the drawbacks and dangers of the status 
quo and to arrange with them for its peaceful replacement by a sounder one," he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
That "difficult time" lasted far longer than expected. But NATO has now reached 
the point, forecast by Kennan, when a sounder relationship with the Warsaw Pact 
is possible. It is up to the NATO member nations to decide where they want to 
go, and at what pace. 
</P>
<P>
Seldom has there been a time when NATO has not been described as in disarray. 
The alliance was born in 1949 in response to the Soviet takeover of what became 
its satellites in Eastern Europe, to such threats to the West as the Berlin 
blockade and the first Soviet atomic bomb test. 
</P>
<P>
It has experienced many challenges, including four major crises, but each time 
the Soviet Union took action that helped draw the alliance back together. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany's rearmament and its admittance to NATO in 1955 created the first 
NATO crisis. The Soviets responded within days by creating the Warsaw Pact. The 
divided and anxious atmosphere in NATO was greatly deepened a year later when 
the United States publicly chastised France and Britain for their invasion, 
with Israel, of Egypt over Cairo's nationalization of the Suez Canal. But the 
Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 reunited NATO against the common threat. 
</P>
<P>
The second crisis began in 1958 when French President Charles de Gaulle started 
to pull France out of NATO. But in 1961, Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev 
told the West that "we will bury you," attempted to take over Berlin, erected 
the Berlin Wall and precipitated the Cuban missile crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The third difficult period came in 1966 when De Gaulle withdrew France from 
NATO's unified military command. But two years later the Soviets reminded NATO 
of its purpose when its forces led a Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth crisis began in the late 1970s with the massive Soviet military 
buildup in Europe. NATO made the controversial decision in 1979 to reply by 
deploying U.S. Pershing 2 missiles and ground-launched cruise missiles, a 
decision aided by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan that year. The alliance 
began deploying its missiles in 1983, and the Soviets, despite earlier threats, 
returned to the bargaining table and negotiated a treaty that banned such 
weapons on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has repeatedly sounded a call for nations of the "common European 
home" to work together to solve their political problems, a formulation that 
would include Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union but exclude the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. view is that the alliance rests on what Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III calls "shared Western values." President Bush will argue at the 
summit conference, Baker said last week, that NATO was created to promote the 
common defense of these shared common values -- democracy, human rights, the 
rule of law, free enterprise and respect for the individual. 
</P>
<P>
These values are inspiring peoples in many parts of the world, including 
Eastern Europe and even the Soviet Union, Baker said, and they will be the 
principal basis for ending the division of Europe and drawing Warsaw Pact 
nations and the Soviet Union into a community. 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, Baker said, NATO must continue to ensure a strong 
defense, although possibly at lower levels of arms as negotiators make progress 
in Vienna toward agreements to reduce non-nuclear forces on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
In what appeared to be a diplomatic way of encouraging the separation of East 
European nations from Moscow, Baker said the NATO members should look for ways 
to "further the peaceful decentralization of economic, political and social 
authority in Eastern Europe." Vestiges of the Cold War, such as the Berlin 
Wall, must be removed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these points may be reflected in two documents that Manfred Woerner, 
the NATO secretary general, wants the summit conference to produce. 
</P>
<P>
One is a "comprehensive concept" statement that would spell out force 
requirements for NATO and arms reduction possibilities for the future. The 
other is a statement on broad NATO political policy toward the East Bloc that 
would map out the way ahead. 
</P>
<P>
On a more personal level, European leaders here will be carefully observing the 
performance of Bush, who is attending his first NATO summit meeting. The 
alliance has instinctively looked to the U.S. President for firm leadership, 
but as Western Europe has grown stronger, it has also grown more independent 
and more critical in its appraisal of U.S. leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Several European members, particularly West Germany, believe that the Bush 
Administration has been slow to respond to Soviet arms control proposals. For 
this reason, the White House is expected to work hard at this conference for a 
compromise on the knotty issue of short-range nuclear forces. 
</P>
<P>
That controversy threatens to focus world attention on NATO's differences, with 
West Germany and some other NATO members pitted against the United States and 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, Washington and London favor modernizing the aging Lance missile, 
then deploying a new missile in the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
But West Germany, where virtually all Western short-range nuclear weapons are 
deployed, fears that if such weapons are ever used, they will almost certainly 
be used on German soil. It wants the decision on modernizing the short-range 
nuclear weapons delayed until at least 1992, and it has called for early 
negotiations on reducing both sides' short-range nuclear forces. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have resisted such talks on grounds that Soviet 
pressure to ban all short-range missiles would become all but politically 
irresistible. That, they say, would jeopardize the doctrine of "flexible 
response," which they credit with deterring Soviet aggression for the last two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
Short-range nuclear weapons, the Americans and Britons argue, have served as 
the balancing force against the Warsaw Pact's overwhelming superiority in 
conventional arms arrayed along the East-West border. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain want the conference to produce a statement that 
short-range nuclear weapons will not be totally abolished. The West Germans are 
reluctant to commit themselves to such a policy. 
</P>
<P>
Some NATO and U.S. officials believe that a compromise can be reached by 
setting up a committee to study linking early short-range nuclear forces 
negotiations with demonstrated progress at the Vienna talks on reducing 
non-nuclear forces. A statement ruling out -- for the present -- a ban on all 
short-range nuclear weapons might have to be part of the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
In the view of many experts in NATO affairs, the missile issue is only the most 
obvious manifestation of West Germany's new assertiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. government officials put little stock in the West German challenge on 
the missile question. "It's a minor issue," a senior official in Washington 
said. He implied that West German politicians have exaggerated the significance 
of short-range nuclear forces in order to distract attention from domestic 
controversies over taxes and immigration. 
</P>
<P>
But to Nitze, who was former President Ronald Reagan's arms control adviser, 
"the main problem of NATO is the future of (West) Germany. The alliance must 
recognize that Germany deserves a more important role. The United States has 
had the central role in NATO until now. But now (Germany) is the Continental 
power." 
</P>
<P>
As President von Weizsaecker put it in his 40th anniversary speech: 
</P>
<P>
"The alliance, Western Europe and the whole Continent are decisively dependent 
on our contribution. Our political weight derives from our central location, 
the special situation of Berlin, the size of our population, our productivity 
and our stability."

COURT CASE OF 'LASSEN FIVE' IS NO SECRET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN RODERICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

SUSANVILLE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the basement of the Lassen County courthouse, the drunk-driving and bad 
check suspects waiting in Justice Court for arraignment one day last month 
shared the folding chairs with a vaguely familiar and unusually well-dressed 
gang of five. 
</P>
<P>
The celebrity defendants were four members of the Lassen County Board of 
Supervisors and last year's board chairman. They did not stand accused of 
official corruption or lapsed morals. Their alleged crime was discussing the 
purchase of two new county cars during an 18-minute closed meeting last 
September. 
</P>
<P>
They are the first elected body to be charged with a criminal violation of 
California's 35-year-old Ralph M. Brown Act, the law that requires county 
boards and city councils to conduct most of their business in public meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Plenty of civil suits have arisen out of the law, but no criminal action that 
could, at least in theory, send an entire elected county government board to 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
As might be expected, the supervisors are not too happy about it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Just So Petty' 
</P>
<P>
"This is pathetic," said Michael A. Grob, their Sacramento attorney, who 
advised the supervisors not to speak with reporters. "It is just so petty." 
</P>
<P>
Even organizations that have spent years defending and strengthening the act, a 
favorite tool of journalists and citizen activists, say the "Lassen Five" case 
is not destined for legal immortality. Mostly they find the episode bemusing. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be surprised if there is a finding of guilt here," said Terry Francke, 
legal counsel for the California Newspaper Publishers Assn., which often 
invokes the Brown Act in civil courts on behalf of journalists. "But I've been 
surprised before." 
</P>
<P>
In the small mountain towns of Lassen County, where residents are quick to slap 
a recall petition on politicians who step out of line, the misdemeanor charges 
have caused hardly a ripple in the routine of making ready for the summer 
tourist onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
"Not one letter to the editor has come in," said Tom Wright, news editor of the 
Lassen County Times and instigator of the episode. "The people are keeping real 
quiet. Maybe they're waiting to see if any convictions come out of this." 
</P>
<P>
Wright's role began during the winter when he read some minutes from a Board of 
Supervisors meeting held in September. He noticed that a vote to approve a 
raise and a car for county Administrative Officer Ron Holden had been discussed 
earlier, according to the minutes, in a private session. 
</P>
<P>
The Brown Act allows certain personnel and legal matters to be discussed in 
private. But Wright said he did not feel that Holden's salary and car -- and 
the decision to buy a second county car as well -- were included. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Specifies Complaint 
</P>
<P>
"I think they deserve cars. I have no problem with that," Wright said recently. 
"My complaint is it wasn't done in full view of the public." 
</P>
<P>
With the backing of his publisher, Wright took his conclusions to Lassen County 
Dist. Atty. William O. Scott. In most such cases, Brown Act experts say, the 
dispute does not become a criminal matter. 
</P>
<P>
If a violation occurs, it can be fixed by the board simply taking up the issue 
again properly in public session. In extreme cases when a city council or board 
has been defiant, a civil injunction has been obtained to force a meeting to be 
held in public. But the law has always allowed for criminal penalties as well. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the Brown Act is not simply to have the final decision made in 
public but to have the debate that led to the final decision in public," said 
Walter Zelman, executive director for California Common Cause. "But in most 
cases civil penalties would probably suffice." 
</P>
<P>
In Lassen County, the district attorney called in the Susanville Police 
Department to investigate. After several months of investigation, Scott filed 
one misdemeanor count March 23 against each of the five -- Supervisors Helen 
Williams, Gary Lemke, John Gaither and Hughes de Martimprey, and former board 
Chairman Jack Jenkins, who lost his seat in November's election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Be Fined, Jailed 
</P>
<P>
All were released on their own recognizance at the April 19 arraignment, and 
pleas were delayed until June 8. By law, the charges could carry a six-month 
jail sentence, a $1,000 fine and $2,000 in penalty assessments. 
</P>
<P>
Scott's decision to file charges came as a surprise, both in Lassen County and 
among attorneys with extensive Brown Act experience. Scott will not discuss the 
case, even to rebut whispered allegations that he is engaging in political 
revenge for an earlier clash with the supervisors over staffing for Scott's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The vendetta theory is not widely accepted by those who are close to the case, 
on either side. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he's the type of person to make it a personal battle," Wright, 
the newspaper editor, said of Scott. "He knew he was going to have to deal with 
these people again." 
</P>
<P>
Francke, the publishers' organization legal counsel who has been following the 
developments, also found the revenge idea unlikely. "I can't think this is just 
politics because politics could have been satisfied without all this trouble," 
Francke said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Based on a Dispute 
</P>
<P>
The attorney for the accused supervisors said he also does not think the 
charges grow out of any lingering dispute with the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty clean community politically," said Grob, the Sacramento 
attorney. "But I don't have any idea why he's doing it. The district attorney 
has absolutely no proof of a knowing violation, and the Brown Act requires a 
knowing violation." 
</P>
<P>
The law's requirement that officials know that their action was illegal is the 
main reason there have been so few attempts to prosecute under the Brown Act, 
attorneys familiar with the law's history said. 
</P>
<P>
Only two other criminal cases have been brought under the Brown Act, and 
neither reached trial. One involved a Nevada County city official indicted by a 
grand jury, but Grob, who represented the official, said the charges were 
dropped when he resigned. In the other case a member of a special district 
board had a Brown Act charge tacked onto a more serious conflict-of-interest 
allegation. Those charges were dropped as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
County Counsel at Session 
</P>
<P>
Grob said the Lassen County supervisors cannot be held responsible because the 
closed board meeting was attended by the Lassen County counsel, and he would 
have been responsible for advising the supervisors if they were crossing into 
uncertain legal turf. 
</P>
<P>
The county administrative officer whose salary was discussed in the meeting 
said he should be blamed for what he called a mix-up involving an error in the 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"The minutes were definitely in error," Holden said. "I'm brokenhearted about 
it. There's no way I would knowingly lead the supervisors to break the open 
meeting law." 
</P>
<P>
In a small county such as Lassen, the charges have complicated the carrying on 
of government. Justice Court Judge Stephen D. Bradbury refused to hear the 
case, citing his close relationship with the supervisors, so a judge had to be 
called in from neighboring Modoc County. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said the newspaper has taken some heat from friends of the supervisors, 
but he said he just had to explain "it was my job." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think our supervisors are terrible, mean, nasty people who cheat and 
steal," Wright said. "I just think they should pay more attention to the 
rules."

ROGERS REASSIGNED TO SHORE DUTY; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY HONORS VINCENNES CAPTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Capt. Will C. Rogers III was awarded the Legion of Merit, a top military honor, 
on Saturday as he stepped down from command of the Vincennes. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers was given the award for his performance as commanding officer of the 
guided-missile cruiser, which became the focus of international controversy 
last July when it mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner in the Persian Gulf, 
killing all 290 people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
He has been reassigned to shore duty at the Point Loma Tactical Development and 
Training Group in what Navy officials describe as a routine transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking from the deck of the Vincennes, Rogers paid special tribute to his 
wife, Sharon, who narrowly escaped death in March when a suspected terrorist 
bomb destroyed her van as she was driving to her teaching job at an exclusive 
private school in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
"She literally rode the fireball out of the vehicle, sprinted to the curb, 
combed the shrapnel from her hair and asked a construction worker to call and 
inform me that she had experienced a minor mechanical difficulty," Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I arrived, she was most concerned, as her lesson plans were in flames and 
she was going to be late for school." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, who was seated among 500 spectators on the pier next to the ship, 
drew a standing ovation from the crowd as she accepted a bouquet of red roses 
from the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
She was fired by administrators of the exclusive La Jolla Country Day School, 
who feared that her presence posed a security threat to the children. She has 
since reached a $135,000 financial settlement with the school. 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests were a number of children from the fourth-grade class Sharon 
Rogers taught at the La Jolla Country Day School. Giggling and smiling, the 
children gathered around her before the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony took place amid unusually tight security Saturday. Only invited 
guests were allowed on the base and all had to pass through two security checks 
and a metal detector. The Rogerses remain under the constant protection of the 
Naval Investigative Service. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Rogers was presented with a letter saying that while on duty in the 
Persian Gulf, his "tactical skills and calm direction enabled his crew to 
successfully engage seven heavily armed high-speed Iranian surface craft" 
attacking the Vincennes in "confined and confused waters. As a result, five 
craft were destroyed and two retreated." 
</P>
<P>
The letter made no mention of the Iranian airliner, which Rogers ordered shot 
down that day in the mistaken belief that it was an Iranian fighter plane. 
Rogers and his crew were cleared of any responsibility for the mistake in a 
Defense Department investigation last year.

TAXPAYERS AND LOBBYISTS PICK UP TRAVEL TAB FOR LAWMAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many California legislators don't have to dream of faraway places. They've been 
there. 
</P>
<P>
To Paris and London, Brazil and New Zealand, Singapore and Bombay. 
</P>
<P>
And what's more, they didn't have to pay. A variety of special interests are 
willing to pick up much of the tab. State funds and campaign treasuries pay for 
the rest. 
</P>
<P>
In a detailed study of free travel by legislators during the last legislative 
session, The Times found that: 
</P>
<P>
* Legislative staffers on the public payroll solicited travel money for 
legislators from private sources, including lobbyists, even though state law 
prohibits lobbyists from making or arranging gifts to a lawmaker in excess of 
$10 a month. 
</P>
<P>
* The Senate two years ago set up an office to help arrange trips that took 
dozens of legislators to places as distant as Cairo and Beijing. On most of the 
trips, legislative employees planned the itineraries and acted as tour guides. 
</P>
<P>
* Other travel by legislators, including leisurely fishing trips in Northern 
California and conferences in Bermuda, was planned and paid for directly by 
corporations or trade groups backing bills before the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
* The taxpayers helped foot the bill for a number of trips, including 25 
outside the country to such faraway places as Australia, Hong Kong and South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
* Special-interest money for some legislative travel was distributed by private 
organizations, in effect obscuring its true source. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators defend the travel as helpful, even vital, to California but say 
they need to turn to special interests for financing because taxpayers are 
reluctant to pay the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The costs are substantial. 
</P>
<P>
In their financial disclosure reports for the 1987-88 session, lawmakers 
reported receiving gifts totaling $744,000 for travel, an average of $6,200 per 
lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
Most of that money came from private sources. But some of it, about $64,000, 
came from foreign governments, which themselves have a stake in California tax 
and trade policies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dependence on Special Interests 
</P>
<P>
Critics and even some lawmakers say they are troubled by the Legislature's 
dependence on special interests for travel expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"In my ideal world," said Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los 
Angeles), the state would pay for the travel. "But I'm an American politician, 
I'm a California politician, and I have to recognize what my constituents think 
is proper. And they love having international meetings, and I think they want 
us to learn about the world, and they don't want to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
Roberti minimized the extent to which legislative employees have called on 
lobbyists and special interests to cover the cost of legislative travel, but 
defended the practice. 
</P>
<P>
"What would be more improper would be to treat California as if it is a banana 
republic or a backwater somewhere else," Roberti said. "I think that the 
American people are pretty comfortable having private industry pay for certain 
things if they think there is a reason for it." 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference earlier this year, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco) upbraided a reporter for assuming that a free trip would influence 
the voting behavior of legislators. "It is the ultimate in cynicism," Brown 
said, "to assume automatically that it is (an attempt to buy a vote)." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trip Funding Criticized 
</P>
<P>
But others say that allowing special interests to pay for travel is troubling. 
</P>
<P>
"Private money is not disinterested," said UCLA law professor Daniel H. 
Lowenstein, the first chairman of the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission. "Some private groups make these kinds of gifts in an effort to 
create good will. It's not in the public interest to allow them to create good 
will with public officials in that way. If we decide to save a few pennies by 
letting them send our legislators all over the world we'll pay for it 1,000 
times over." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Legislature does pay certain expenses for lawmakers traveling out 
of state or outside the country. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two years, Speaker Brown authorized state funds for five Assembly 
members to travel outside the United States at a cost to taxpayers of $15,080. 
By far the most expensive was a three-week trip by Assemblywoman Sunny 
Mojonnier (R-Encinitas), who talked to officials in Spain and Portugal about 
the upcoming 500th anniversary of Columbus' first transatlantic voyage. 
Mojonnier was reimbursed $6,648, including $4,374 for food and lodging, 
according to Assembly records. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, the Senate paid $50,424 for out-of-country trips by 14 
senators, according to Senate figures. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest beneficiary by far was Sen. Jim Ellis (R-San Diego), who received 
$11,003 for trips to Australia and London. He made the trips last summer and 
fall, despite the fact that he was already a lame duck legislator, having 
announced many months before that he would not seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need for Outside Sources 
</P>
<P>
However, tax dollars for travel were in relatively short supply during the 
1987-88 session and many legislators looked to outside sources to pay for 
trips. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Senate established the Senate Office of Protocol, primarily to 
receive the hundreds of foreign dignitaries who visit the state Capitol each 
year, Roberti said. 
</P>
<P>
But the office's four state-paid employees also planned or helped arrange 17 
trips that took about 40 legislators out of the country in a two-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Employees of the office accompanied lawmakers on 10 of those trips, serving as 
tour guides and taking care of such "nitty-gritty" problems as handling the 
baggage, according to senators who went along. 
</P>
<P>
When a delegation of senators and spouses held a dinner for Egyptian and 
American diplomats in Cairo last November, the protocol office's associate 
director, Chris Kockinis, paid for the meal with her credit card. A month 
later, she sent bills totaling $1,008 to the California Optometric Assn. and 
the California Retailers Assn., thanking them for hosting the dinner, although 
no one from either group attended. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turned to Lobbyist 
</P>
<P>
Last year, when the Senate wanted to send two of its members -- Republican Ed 
Davis of Valencia and Democrat Milton Marks of San Francisco -- to Mexico City, 
the protocol office turned to Dennis Flatt, chief lobbyist for the California 
Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems for help. The association provided $1,892 
to cover expenses. 
</P>
<P>
But the state Political Reform Act specifically prohibits lobbyists from 
providing gifts to a legislator in excess of $10 a month or from arranging or 
acting as an intermediary for such gifts. Just what it means to "arrange" or 
"act as an intermediary" is not always clear. Recently, the Fair Political 
Practices Commission fined a lobbying firm $1,000 because it allowed a client 
to use its offices and staff for a reception. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital association's spokeswoman, Lori Aldrete, said Flatt merely passed 
along the request for help on the Mexico City trip to the group's executives, 
who are not subject to the $10 limit. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate protocol staff has gone to other lobbyists as well in its search for 
funds for trips. Responding to one of those requests last year, veteran 
lobbyist George Steffes said he called on one of his clients, the California 
Mobilehome Park Owners Alliance. Individual members of the group contributed 
$2,000 to Sacramento State University's Hornet Foundation for a legislative 
trade mission to India and Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
Like other lobbyists who have passed along requests for funds, Steffes said he 
avoids making or arranging such sizable gifts for legislators. "The fact that 
it was going through Sac State made it different, made it an academic thing," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Funding Source Disputed 
</P>
<P>
The director of the Senate protocol office, Susan Foreman, accompanied 
legislators on several trips, including one to Israel in 1987. The legislators 
on that trip reported receiving a total of $13,296 in travel expenses from 
American Associates of Ben Gurion University. Foreman got $2,605. 
</P>
<P>
But the true source of funding for the trip is in dispute. The current director 
of the Beverly Hills-based group, Mark Friedman, said that his office did not 
pay those travel expenses, although it did help coordinate the trip. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in existence for the explicit purpose of raising money for the 
university," Friedman said. "We would not be underwriting costs for a visit of 
the sort you described." 
</P>
<P>
The state's largest teachers union, the California Teachers Assn., helped pay 
for other trips to Israel -- travel organized and led by the Democratic 
chairman of the Assembly Rules Committee, Tom Bane of Tarzana, and his wife, 
Marlene. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying legislators on a Bane-led trip last November was Alice Huffman, 
the teacher association's manager of governmental relations in Sacramento. "If 
the implication is because we go on a trip we have an edge with a member, that 
is a little shortsighted on both sides," Huffman said. "All it does is cause 
one to have a better understanding of members." 
</P>
<P>
Two legislators on that same trip -- Republican Assemblywomen Cathie Wright of 
Simi Valley and Bev Hansen of Santa Rosa -- reported that the Jewish Federation 
Council of Greater Los Angeles, a charitable group, paid all or part of their 
costs. But Ron Rieder, a spokesman for the council, said that he believed the 
Banes raised the money. "We arranged the trip but didn't fund it. The funds 
were privately raised." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 Declined to Discuss Details 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Bane refused to discuss the Israel trip in detail, but said that 
his own costs were paid by his campaign committee, which reported paying $6,300 
to the council last year. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, corporations or groups with a direct interest in legislation simply 
paid for legislative travel outright. Among those who did were: 
</P>
<P>
* Pfizer Inc., which last year paid $17,098 for a four-day trip to Bermuda for 
three legislators, their spouses and two legislative aides. The trip came while 
the Legislature was still considering a Pfizer bill that would have helped the 
company ward off lawsuits from foreign citizens. The bill failed. 
</P>
<P>
* California Co-Composting Systems Inc., which spent $18,600 to help send 
Speaker Brown, Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) and Sen. William A. 
Craven (R-Oceanside) to Austria in 1987 to see highway sound and safety 
barriers made out of a mix of sewage sludge and garbage. The trips came soon 
after passage of a Craven bill requiring the state to test such products, which 
have been in use in Europe for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
* Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which routinely pays 
most of the expenses for legislators' trips to the Academy Awards ceremonies in 
Los Angeles -- including hotel room, limousine service, tickets to the 
ceremonies and, in some cases, air fare. Legislative leaders decided which of 
their colleagues could go. The total bill for 20 legislators and their guests 
over the past two years was $34,293. During the same period, the lobbying group 
won approval of a measure assuring the industry of a sales tax break estimated 
at up to $9 million a year. All 20 legislators voted for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
* Pacific Telesis, which paid out $74,313 for legislators' travel, most of it 
for a 1987 trip by Assembly and Senate utility committee members -- along with 
their spouses -- to London and Paris. The committees control most state 
legislation directly affecting the company and its subsidiary, Pacific Bell. 
The chairs of the two committees, Assemblywoman Moore and Sen. Herschel 
Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), decided which of their colleagues would be invited 
on the trip, said company lobbyist Paul Henry. The phone company has been in 
the middle of numerous legislative battles, ranging from yellow pages to cable 
television. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal was one of several legislators who contended that lawmakers who take 
such trips often turn around and vote against the special interests that paid 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
"The trips are fruitful," he said. "They should be paid for by the Senate. . . 
. At the moment there's no prospect of it." 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, globe-trotting legislators say they have only a vague idea of 
which companies are actually paying for their trips. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Atlantic Encounter 
</P>
<P>
The most notable example is Atlantic Encounter, a mysterious European-based 
group that provided $73,889 for travel to London, Dublin, Rome and Madrid for 
eight Assembly members during the 1987-88 legislative session, plus $18,026 in 
speaking fees. 
</P>
<P>
Among those making these trips were several top Assembly leaders, including 
Speaker Brown, Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), Thomas M. Hannigan (D-Fairfield) and 
Frank Hill (R-Whittier). 
</P>
<P>
Hannigan, the Assembly Democrats' floor leader, described Atlantic Encounter as 
"an association of multinational organizations" that tries to inform policy 
makers about issues affecting Europe. One of the companies was Mars Inc., he 
said. The candy manufacturer reported spending $126,000 to lobby the 
Legislature over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
When five top legislative leaders flew to Tokyo in 1987, their expenses were 
paid for by the Japan Institute for Social and Economic Affairs, which is 
funded by private industry. Sadami (Chris) Wada, a New York-based official for 
Sony Corp. who deals with legislators, said he made recommendations on which 
lawmakers should be invited, attended a Sacramento briefing for legislators by 
the Japanese Consulate, and joined the travelers for part of a trip. The total 
cost of the trips was reported at $36,950. 
</P>
<P>
Senate leader Roberti went on one institute-paid trip. Defending such privately 
financed travel as good for the state, he said: "There's always the presumption 
that anything enjoyable is bad, and that's not true." 
</P>
<P>
Republican Sen. Larry Stirling of San Diego agreed. "It may be trite and banal 
to say it, but travel is broadening," said the senator, who reported a gift of 
$2,000 from the Chinese People's Institute for a trip last year to China. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Noel K. Wilson and Daniel M. Weintraub contributed to this 
story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

WHITE HOUSE DISPUTES CONTENTION THAT ACTION BROKE LAW

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration on Saturday confirmed that the United States has 
discreetly shared some nuclear-weapons information with France since 1972, but 
it disputed a published report that the cooperation violated U.S. law. 
</P>
<P>
In an article published Saturday, Princeton University Prof. Richard H. Ullman 
maintains that the cooperation was a "covert" arrangement that "almost 
certainly has violated U.S. law." But he added that the arrangement has also 
strengthened the nuclear deterrent available to the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization and has helped reverse the ill effects of French President Charles 
de Gaulle's 1966 decision to pull France out of the alliance's unified military 
command. 
</P>
<P>
A statement issued jointly by the Bush White House in Rome and by the State 
Department here pointed out that the cooperation with France dates back to 
1961, when the John F. Kennedy Administration reached a formal agreement with 
France to exchange some classified information "concerning training, military 
planning, protection against nuclear-weapons effects and operation of delivery 
systems." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accord Suspended in 1966 
</P>
<P>
That agreement was suspended in 1966, after De Gaulle marched the French 
military out of NATO and ousted the alliance headquarters from Paris. But the 
arrangement was resumed in 1972, during the Richard M. Nixon Administration, 
and it was further expanded in 1985 in an amendment to the 1961 agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. statement Saturday said that the 1985 amendment allowed "exchanges of 
certain classified information related to the safety, security and reliability 
of nuclear activities and installations." 
</P>
<P>
The statement went on to insist that the relation with the French, extending 
back 28 years, "has been entirely consistent with the terms of the Atomic 
Energy Act of 1954, as amended. . . . While this cooperation has been 
confidential, it is a mistake to label it as covert (because) this cooperation 
takes place with the full knowledge of both governments and does not involve 
activities of an intelligence nature." 
</P>
<P>
In his article, in the Washington-based periodical Foreign Policy, Ullman not 
only calls the exchange covert but insists it was in violation of a 1958 
amendment to the Atomic Energy Act that, by implication, limited American 
nuclear cooperation to Britain, then the only ally with a nuclear weapons 
capability. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in his article, Ullman also concedes that after the Nixon decision to 
resume cooperation was worked out between Henry A. Kissinger, then national 
security adviser, and Michel Jobert, then French foreign minister, care was 
taken not to go beyond existing restrictions on disclosing certain types of 
information. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of the technology involved . . . has in fact been unclassified," Ullman 
writes at one point. "For the most part the exchanges have steered away from 
the actual design of nuclear weapons . . . so as not to run afoul of U.S. 
legislation. In this respect the program of assistance to France has differed 
sharply from the one with Britain, where weapons designs are routinely 
exchanged." 
</P>
<P>
What the Ullman article skirts in its assertion that laws were violated was the 
fact that President Kennedy asked Congress on Sept. 7, 1961, for unusually 
prompt action to amend the Atomic Energy Act to permit exchanges of sensitive 
information with the French. Acting under pressure after the Berlin crisis of 
that summer, Kennedy explained that the exchanges "will make possible effective 
cooperation with France in NATO mutual defense planning and in the training of 
French NATO forces." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Detailed Report 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on Saturday, a Pentagon spokesman issued a more detailed statement 
on the U.S.-French cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
The United States "has cooperated with France in improving the operational 
effectiveness and survivability of its strategic missile systems, including 
supporting command and control systems," said the spokesman, who declined to be 
identified by name. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been several meetings involving U.S. and French technicians every 
year since 1972 under the terms of the 1961 agreement," the statement from the 
Pentagon said.

BUSH ASSURES ITALY ON U.S. TROOP CUTS

<P>
President Bush, indicating he is prepared to offer new arms control proposals 
at the NATO summit Monday, assured Italian leaders Saturday that he will not 
unilaterally reduce U.S. forces in Europe without consulting with U.S. allies. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in a rare Saturday evening audience with Pope John Paul II, Bush vowed 
that "progress must continue" toward "realizing the biblical injunction to turn 
our swords into plowshares." 
</P>
<P>
John Paul, for his part, praised Bush for being "deeply committed" to "the 
efforts being made to liberate the youth of America from the destructive forces 
of drug abuse and to alleviate poverty at home and abroad." 
</P>
<P>
The Pope declared, however, that those problems "are only the symptoms of a 
deeper moral crisis" throughout the world. "Truly the hour of international 
interdependence has struck," he said. "What is at stake is the common good of 
humanity." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the day, his second in a four-nation European tour, Bush toasted 
Italian-American friendship and the contributions of Italian-Americans to the 
United States at a dinner hosted by Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita. Bush was 
loudly applauded when he announced that he will end the current requirement 
that Italians visiting the United States obtain visas. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, only residents of Canada, Britain and Japan are exempt from visa 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
In his meetings with Italian leaders, Bush told De Mita that the latest Soviet 
proposal to reduce its forces in Europe had provided openings for the allies to 
discuss new arms reduction proposals of their own when they meet at the 40th 
annual North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Brussels on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus on Poland 
</P>
<P>
Bush also discussed the situation in Eastern Europe, particularly Poland, with 
Italian President Francesco Cossiga, who recently visited that country, and 
with the Pope, who was archbishop of Krakow before becoming pontiff. 
</P>
<P>
The recent accord between Poland's Communist leaders and the Solidarity-led 
opposition "is a tribute to the spirit of the Polish people as well as to the 
determination of the Polish church and, indeed, the Holy See," Bush told the 
Pope. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the pontiff, Bush, accompanied by his wife, Barbara, top 
aides and Vatican officials, visited 120 American seminarians studying at the 
Vatican. The students broke into applause when Bush entered the room and joined 
in a chorus of "God Bless America" after the President concluded his brief 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
"What a neat welcome," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Bush will tour an American military cemetery near the site of the World 
War II Anzio beachhead. He will then depart for Brussels to prepare for the 
opening of the NATO summit. 
</P>
<P>
At the NATO meetings, Bush is expected to put forward a number of proposals, 
including one that would reduce NATO's troop levels in Europe and another that 
would ease trade sanctions that the United States and its allies imposed 
against the Eastern Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
"The President clearly will be discussing a number of ideas -- many of them 
have not been presented before -- related to the conventional arms talks and 
related to this latest offer by the Soviet Union," White House Press Secretary 
Marlin Fitzwater said as he briefed reporters on the closed-door meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The trade sanctions bar exports to Soviet Bloc countries of any item on a 
lengthy list of products, ranging from computer software to oil pipelines, that 
could be converted to military use. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the United States and its 
allies reviewed such exports on a case-by-case basis. But in 1980, the U.S. 
announced a policy of "no exceptions," under which any such exports would be 
blocked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Unilateral Action 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater stressed that Bush told the Italians -- De Mita, Cossiga and former 
Premier Bettino Craxi -- that Washington will not take any unilateral action 
but will approach both troop reductions and the trade issue "within the 
framework of the consultations in Brussels." 
</P>
<P>
But European nations have long chafed under the no-exceptions trade rule and 
would likely welcome a move by Washington to loosen it. 
</P>
<P>
The impetus for the new moves, Fitzwater said, is the latest Soviet arms 
control proposal, made May 23 at the Vienna arms talks, which called for 
massive reductions in conventional forces. That proposal "goes a long way 
toward accepting some of the concepts" of earlier NATO proposals, Fitzwater 
said.

JET HIJACKING FOILED AFTER CUBAN ELUDES L.A. SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A mentally troubled Mariel refugee who lived in Los Angeles smuggled a starter 
pistol, two knives and scissors past metal detectors at Los Angeles 
International Airport and unsuccessfully tried to hijack a plane home to Cuba 
on Saturday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The hijacking was foiled after the pilot of the American Airlines 727 jetliner, 
carrying 140 passengers, turned back about 60 miles south of Miami because the 
plane was almost out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Rene Comas-Banos, 37, who had escaped from two mental hospitals during 
his stay in the United States, was arrested without incident and charged with 
air piracy, said William A. Gavin, head of the FBI's Miami office. No one 
aboard the jetliner was injured. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dressed in Fatigues 
</P>
<P>
The aborted hijacking began after Comas-Banos paid $417 in cash for a one-way 
ticket from Los Angeles to Miami. Shortly after midnight Saturday, dressed in 
camouflage fatigues and a bomber-type jacket, the sandy-haired Comas-Banos 
carried two red satchels on board American Airlines Flight 30 to Dallas-Ft. 
Worth. 
</P>
<P>
At 7 a.m., he left the Texas airport aboard Flight 1098. As the plane descended 
in its approach to Miami International Airport, Comas-Banos took out the 
starter pistol and demanded in a note to be flown to Jose Marti International 
Airport outside Havana, according to Gavin. Assisted by a Spanish-speaking 
passenger, he told the crew he had explosives with him and would blow up the 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Barker, the Federal Aviation Administration's regional spokesman, said in 
an interview from Georgia that air traffic controllers granted emergency 
permission for the plane to fly to Cuba. Barker said the plane headed south, 
but turned back because fuel was running low, landing in Miami at 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agrees to Surrender 
</P>
<P>
After negotiations with the FBI continued for about 90 minutes, Comas-Banos 
agreed to surrender. A search of his luggage turned up no explosive. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Manzanilla, Cuba, he was sent to St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, 
D.C., shortly after arriving in the United States on May 27, 1980, during the 
Mariel boatlift. He escaped sometime in 1982, made his way to Los Angeles and 
was again hospitalized for psychiatric treatment at an unknown institution 
here, but again escaped, according to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
FBI spokesman Paul Miller said Comas-Banos had spent a considerable amount of 
time living on Los Angeles streets.

CHINA WATCHERS SEE OMENS IN RHETORIC

<P>
The strong language used recently by Chinese leaders to denounce their 
political opponents exemplifies an intolerance of dissent not seen in that 
country since the days of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, U.S. analysts said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most striking examples they noted was a reported speech to the 
Communist Party's Politburo by former President Li Xiannian, who used a 
hallmark phrase from that tumultuous era in describing the clash as a "struggle 
between two headquarters." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly anachronistic, they said, was the nationally televised speech Friday 
by veteran party conservative Chen Yun, who signaled that a major political 
purge is in the works by urging party cadres to "resolutely expose schemes and 
intrigues of the very, very few people who intend to create turmoil." 
</P>
<P>
"That's rough stuff," said historian Thomas Bernstein of Columbia University. 
"Others who have lost favor since the death of Mao Tse-tung have been dismissed 
without that kind of virulent verbiage." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worried Leadership 
</P>
<P>
"Intolerance comes from desperation," said another China watcher, Anthony Kane 
of the Asia Society, "and what I think you see is an increasingly isolated 
leadership that realizes it has some very serious opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The rhetoric, with allusions to an epic battle between party leaders and an 
"anti-party clique," reflects a view that sees Chinese politics as a 
battleground on which a wider class struggle is fought out, the U.S. analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
That notion, which dominated political discourse in China for nearly three 
decades after the Communists took power in 1949, had been almost completely 
submerged in the political relaxation that followed the death of Mao. 
</P>
<P>
Its sudden resurgence last week marked a turnaround that some experts equated 
with Mao's crackdown on dissent after the abortive "hundred flowers" campaign 
of the late 1950s, when exhortations to "let a hundred flowers bloom, let a 
hundred schools of thought contend" gave way to repression of those who had 
offered criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Emotions Inflated Rhetoric 
</P>
<P>
American scholars cautioned that it would be premature to conclude that China 
had taken a great leap backward to a more repressive past, noting that the 
extraordinary emotion of weeks of public rebellion had sent rhetoric on both 
sides soaring. 
</P>
<P>
But they said the change in tone was nevertheless troubling precisely because 
it was reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution and its social and political 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
"This suggests that the intensity of struggle at the top is quite great, and 
that the possibility of wide-ranging purges is considerable," said Michel 
Oksenberg, a former National Security Council official who now teaches at the 
University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
There has not yet been an official announcement of the fate of embattled 
Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang. But widespread reports suggest that he and 
others will be purged from the party because of their support for student 
demonstrations in Tian An Men Square and their opposition to martial law in 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Another indication of the effort to discredit Zhao came Saturday, when Wan Li, 
chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, issued a 
statement from Shanghai accusing a "small number of people" of "plotting 
political conspiracy." Wan had been a leading ally of Zhao, and observers said 
they believed he had been pressed by the Chinese leadership to make the 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Specialists noted that the ouster of then-party chief Hu Yaobang in January, 
1987, was not accompanied by rhetoric so alarmist or threats of consequences so 
severe. While leaders accused Hu of mounting a campaign of "all-out 
Westernization," they also permitted him to resign his post voluntarily and to 
maintain his seat on the party's Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
That the veiled denunciations of Zhao in recent days have become so severe was 
seen by some scholars as an indication that the painful lessons of the Cultural 
Revolution may have faded. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the central lessons of the Cultural Revolution that people seemed to 
have learned was that you had to have a political process where people who 
disagreed could be seen to have disagreed honestly," said Kane of the Asia 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, rather than respond to the other side, it (the party leadership) has 
apparently decided to crush it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Oksenberg: "This suggests that a level of personal animosity has crept 
back into Chinese politics that many of us had hoped belonged to a bygone era."

PROTESTERS HOLD 2ND RALLY AT CHINA CONSULATE IN L.A.

More than 1,000 Chinese students and sympathizers converged on the Chinese 
Consulate in Los Angeles on Saturday, chanting "We Want Freedom!" with clenched 
fists held high in response to a call for support from pro-democracy activists 
in Beijing and elsewhere in China. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second such demonstration in Los Angeles since student activists 
began a sit-in at Beijing's Tian An Men Square and coincided with 
demonstrations around the world. The demonstrators want political and economic 
reforms in China and the resignation of Premier Li Peng and Deng Xiaoping, 
China's paramount leader. 
</P>
<P>
"This is in response to a call from Beijing to demonstrate the power of the 
people and their desire for freedom and democracy in China," said Wang Youqi, 
33, a student at Caltech and a leader of the Chinese Student Scholars Assn. "We 
want freedom of speech and freedom of the press no matter who is in charge in 
China." 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators gathered Saturday morning at Sun Yat-sen Square in Chinatown 
before marching along a serpentine, five-mile route to the consulate on Shatto 
Place. They waved placards that said "Down with Deng Xiaoping" and "Down with 
the Communist Dictatorship." Some of the marchers yelled Min zhu! (democracy) 
and Zi you! (freedom). 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of students who participated in the protest vowed to camp out on the 
steps of the consulate overnight and begin a symbolic 24-hour fast as part of a 
worldwide fast in support of student activists in China who have staged 
life-threatening hunger strikes. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese students came from colleges and universities throughout Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exhilarating to be a part of history," said Pei Huang, 26, who is 
studying applied physics at UC San Diego. "Democracy and personal freedom make 
a country great and strong -- like the United States. That's what we want for 
China." 
</P>
<P>
Among the boisterous sympathizers at the consulate demonstration was Stephen 
Yee, 69, president of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good, good, good -- we have to stop communism over there," said Yee.

Two Marine helicopters from El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in Orange County 
collided Saturday morning in maneuvers about 70 miles east of here, killing two 
of the nine Marines aboard, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The other seven Marines escaped injury, authorities said. The names of the dead 
were being withheld pending notification of family members. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Fallon Naval Air Station said the helicopters were performing 
routine training maneuvers when they collided at 8:45 a.m. in an uninhabited 
desert area near the base. 
</P>
<P>
Olin Briggs, a spokesman for the air station, said there were four Marines in 
one helicopter and five in the other. The ones who died were in the four-person 
craft. 
</P>
<P>
Churchill County Sheriff Bill Lawry said one of the helicopters received major 
damage while the other came away with moderate damage. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities declined to speculate on the cause of the accident but said an 
investigation would begin immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The CH-46 Sea Knights belonged to the Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron, which 
is permanently assigned to the Marine Corps Air Station in El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
The squadron arrived at the Fallon station last week to participate in 
operation "High-Roller," a two-week exercise designed to test combat readiness 
for the 4th Marine Air Wing.

MARIN FOUNDATION CUTS FUNDS FOR SAN QUENTIN INMATE SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trustees of a massive trust that was established to aid the needy residents of 
wealthy Marin County have sharply cut funds that provide legal services to 
3,000 San Quentin prison inmates who have no other representation. 
</P>
<P>
Cuts in the legal service program and three other San Quentin programs were 
announced as the new Marin Community Foundation, which oversees the $400 
million-plus trust bequeathed by Beryl H. Buck, made the first annual gifts 
since the conclusion of a bitter and draining legal battle for control of the 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
The projects at San Quentin "became a lower priority compared to the other 
areas that we needed to fund. . . . We needed to make choices," said Douglas X. 
Patino, president of the foundation. The fund had $19 million to give in this 
round, $10 million a year less than it did before the litigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Now 'in Bad Shape' 
</P>
<P>
"This is the bedrock of our support. Without that stable funding source we are 
really in bad shape," said Donald Specter, director of the five-lawyer Prison 
Law Office, which received $181,000 this year to handle legal problems of the 
San Quentin inmates. Another $50,000 a year comes from the Legal Services Trust 
Fund money and about $70,000 yearly comes from fees from its court fights. 
</P>
<P>
The law office, housed in a bungalow next to the prison, hoped for $290,000 in 
1990. But Specter learned last Thursday it will receive $90,000 in "phase-out" 
money from the Marin Community Foundation, enough to last six months. 
</P>
<P>
The office has received $1.8 million in Buck money over the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Marin Community Foundation also cut smaller grants to an arts project for 
Death Row inmates, a group that matches inmates with visitors and a center next 
to the prison where out-of-town visitors can stay while waiting to see inmates. 
</P>
<P>
At more than $400 million, the fund remains one of the nation's largest 
community-based foundations. But its trouble began in 1984, when lawyers for 
the San Francisco Foundation, which ran the trust in its early years, and 
charities outside Marin sued to break a provision of Buck's will that limited 
the largess to Marin County causes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Money for Other Projects 
</P>
<P>
A 1986 settlement of the suit required that the trust, now administered by the 
Marin Community Foundation, spend more than $6 million a year on three 
long-term projects to study aging, drug abuse and education in Marin. 
</P>
<P>
Court costs and lawyers' fees cut the Buck principal by $12 million. Lower 
interests rates took another bite out of the fund, Buck spokeswoman Sallyanne 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, there was roughly $19 million -- the interest on the endowment -- 
to divvy up for next year, down from the $29 million it had before the suit. 
The Marin Community Foundation earmarked $6.8 million for human needs. 
</P>
<P>
Requests from groups seeking $23 million poured in. In all, 54 groups got 
funding, and 90 were refused. The groups that won funding will seek to end the 
"isolation of the frail elderly," help abused children, and assist AIDS 
sufferers. 
</P>
<P>
"This (decision to cut the prison projects) is a demonstration of the insular 
nature of the trustees," charged Robert Gnaizda, director of Public Advocates 
Inc., the San Francisco law firm that led the attack on the Marin County-only 
clause of Buck's will. 
</P>
<P>
Gnaizda said the prison cuts at a time of growing prison crowding were made 
because "prisoners have no political power by definition. They cannot vote." 
</P>
<P>
Patino scoffed at the suggestion that prisoners' lack of political pull played 
a part in the decision. "We do not fund -- nor would we be the type of 
organization that would fund -- based on political support," he said. "We fund 
based on the need." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handled Various Cases 
</P>
<P>
The Prison Law Office handles up to 2,000 cases a year, ranging from the child 
custody problems of individual prisoners to inmate disputes with prison 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
It also is involved in class-action suits, including litigation over conditions 
at San Quentin that forced the state to spend $35 million to renovate the 
turn-of-the-century prison.

<P>
ON MARCH 20, 1987, an agitated laboratory technician slapped a newspaper into 
the hands of Bill Frankenberger, 34-year-old associate professor of soil 
microbiology and biochemistry at UC Riverside. Frankenberger slumped into a 
chair, put on his glasses and began to read. Suddenly, he jolted upright, 
excited . . . devastated. 
</P>
<P>
According to the article, the state of California had decided how to solve an 
ecological disaster at Kesterson Reservoir in the Central Valley. Toxic levels 
of selenium there had killed hundreds of birds and contaminated countless 
others. Now, the marshy ponds were to be drained and the soil scraped into a 
$48.2-million, 20-foot-high toxic dump -- a permanent poison island the size of 
40 football fields. 
</P>
<P>
Frankenberger jumped to his feet and strode across the hall. He shoved the 
newspaper at his assistant, Ulrich Karlson, a fast-talking, intense 30-year-old 
German two years out of graduate school. As Karlson read, his eyes widened. "My 
God," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In test tubes just 10 feet from where they stood was an alternative to the 
poison island, the product of two years of research. Their findings had not yet 
been published or field-tested, but if Frankenberger and Karlson were right -- 
and they were sure they were right -- there was a way to clean up Kesterson 
naturally, cheaply and permanently. 
</P>
<P>
In the test tubes were microscopic fungi that ate selenium and burped it out as 
a non-toxic gas. It was no secret that such microbes existed; they were a 
natural component of Central Valley soils. But Frankenberger and Karlson had 
coerced the fungi into gobbling selenium as fast as 200 times the normal rate. 
At that rate, Frankenberger calculated, they might clean up Kesterson in just 
one year. 
</P>
<P>
But not if the contaminated land was bulldozed into a dump. The fungi lived, 
ate and burped only in the upper 6 inches of soil. They couldn't make a dent in 
a 20-foot pile of dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Frankenberger and Karlson decided that they had to "get somebody's attention." 
In hindsight, Frankenberger regards it as the moment he tumbled from the ivory 
tower of research science into a bewildering world of politics, bureaucracy and 
public policy. He prepared himself for failure -- "We always thought we would 
be too late," he remembers. But he was not prepared for two years of crusading, 
risking his reputation and research, fighting with environmentalists and taking 
on government bureaucrats. He was not prepared for the difference between the 
world of the laboratory, where compromise is unheard of, and the outside world, 
where compromise is the rule -- where he could win spectacularly and lose 
spectacularly at exactly the same time. 
</P>
<P>
KESTERSON Reservoir, 1,280 acres of irrigation evaporation ponds near the 
middle of California, was eerily quiet in 1983. Quieter, at least, thought U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife biologists, than the surrounding marshes of the Kesterson 
National Wildlife Refuge and the adjacent Grasslands, a private marshlands 
reserve. The marshlands were usually a duck's version of the Ritz Hotel, a 
choice spot along the Pacific Flyway, the wetlands route followed every year by 
thousands of migrating shore birds and waterfowl. In 1983, however, Kesterson 
Reservoir had turned into a duck's version of Hotel Hell. 
</P>
<P>
When the biologists investigated, they found grossly deformed bird embryos 
missing wings, legs and toes. Beaks of black-necked stilts curved grotesquely; 
brains protruded through holes where eyes should have been. Biologists also 
found hundreds of dead adult birds. And a flock of tricolor blackbirds, 
indigenous to the marshes, had an unexplained nesting failure: Thousands of 
eggs never hatched. 
</P>
<P>
Headlines raged; environmentalists screamed for action; politicians demanded to 
know what happened. 
</P>
<P>
It took two years for the state to declare that high levels of selenium -- a 
trace element found in soils and rock -- were responsible for the mutations and 
mortality. In very small amounts, selenium is essential to life. Ten parts per 
billion in water and 4 parts per million in soil are considered safe by the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In some areas of Kesterson, the levels 
had soared to 3,000 parts per billion in the water and 250 parts per million in 
the soil. 
</P>
<P>
The source of the disaster was California's No. 1 industry: irrigated 
agriculture. The state's farmers sold $16.1 billion in agricultural products 
last year alone, but the riches have come at a price. As land is irrigated, the 
water leaches substances such as salts, pesticides and selenium from the soil. 
High evaporation rates concentrate the substances, and bad drainage, common in 
arid regions, traps what doesn't evaporate. Over time, the soil fills with 
contaminants or contaminated water. Draining the water and flushing the soil 
only moves the problem elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
On the west side of the Central Valley, where the soil is high in selenium and 
an impermeable layer of clay 10 feet down makes for especially bad drainage, 
crops began to die of selenium poisoning in the mid-'70s. The land was like a 
bathtub with no drain, filling with dirty water. 
</P>
<P>
The farmers installed pipes to empty the irrigation waste water into rivers or 
into the federally built San Luis Drain, which flowed into the ponds at 
Kesterson. There, the water evaporated and was replenished over and over, and 
selenium concentrated and began moving up the food chain. 
</P>
<P>
From 1983, when the poisoning first surfaced, to 1985, U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
biologists found about 1,000 birds poisoned by selenium -- "a conservative 
number," says research biologist Henry Ohlendorf, who led the investigation. 
"We were never trying to get total counts." The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, 
which oversees the reservoir as part of the West's massive federal water 
system, installed noise cannons to discourage birds from landing there. Signs 
against hunting and fishing were posted. In 1985, after selenium was named the 
culprit, the state ordered the bureau to clean up the mess. 
</P>
<P>
By then it was clear that Kesterson, as one scientist noted, was only a "pimple 
on the rump of an elephant." Next door, at the Grasslands, where some 
agricultural waste water mixes with fresh water, ducks have shown dangerous 
levels of selenium. And the same has been true for waterfowl at federally 
funded irrigation projects such as Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge in 
Nevada, the Salton Sea and Tulare Lake in California, the Kendrick Reclamation 
Project in Wyoming and the Middle Green River in Utah -- all sites laden with 
selenium, uranium, boron, arsenic, salts and pesticides. Biologists are 
investigating dozens more sites. 
</P>
<P>
The birds at Kesterson Reservoir weren't just the Central Valley's canaries in 
the coal mine. What happened to them sounded a warning for wildlife -- and 
irrigated agriculture -- throughout the West. 
</P>
<P>
A PHOTOGRAPH above Bill Frankenberger's desk shows a younger man, a long- 
haired college pole-vaulter running toward a 15-foot-high bar in a stadium at 
Kansas State Teachers College in Emporia. His eyes -- all calm determination -- 
are riveted on the bar. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a track star," he says slowly in a soft, distant voice that belies his 
ambition and stubbornness. Then he adds with a disarming giggle: "It paid my 
tuition. One day, I realized that I had only two more years of pole-vaulting. 
What was I going to do after that?" 
</P>
<P>
The pole-vaulter, a city boy, son of a Topeka, Kan., grocery store manager, 
took a soils conservation course that piqued his interest. "The course was 
concerned with the deterioration of the environment," Frankenberger says. "It 
really opened up things for me." 
</P>
<P>
After completing a master's degree and a doctorate in agronomy, the science and 
economics of crop production, at Iowa State University, he arrived at the 
University of California, Riverside, in 1981 with his two sons and his wife, 
who was expecting their third child. He taught one course a quarter and spent 
most of the rest of his waking hours conducting basic research alongside a 
group of soils microbiologists pioneering the use of microbes to clean up 
pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1985, Frankenberger received a grant to study the interaction of 
microbes and selenium in San Joaquin Valley soils. Although he didn't know it 
-- the grant never mentioned Kesterson -- he had become a beneficiary of the 
disaster at Kesterson Reservoir. In its wake, the Bureau of Reclamation had 
hired UC Berkeley's Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory to devise a cleanup plan for 
the site, and four multimillion-dollar state and federal projects had been set 
up to look at the broader problem of contaminated irrigation water in the San 
Joaquin Valley. Frankenberger's $38,000 and his research assistant were paid 
for by one of those projects. 
</P>
<P>
He and Karlson hunkered down to the science of microbes and selenium. First, 
they discovered three fungus species -- Acremonium falciforme, Penicillium 
citrinum and Ulocladium tuberculatum -- that had an appetite for very high 
concentrations of selenium. Then they stumbled on a decades-old study that 
showed that the eating and burping process, called volatilization, was speeded 
up by adding carbon in the form of glucose. What else, they wondered, fueled 
the process or stopped it? 
</P>
<P>
"We did a grab sample," says Frankenberger, referring to a seemingly 
unscientific scientific method of grabbing anything they could get their hands 
on to apply to the fungi. They paid special attention to natural elements of 
the Central Valley soils -- crop residues, feed-lot manures and sewage sludge. 
Within six months, they found that applying carbon in the form of pectin, from 
citrus peelings, as well as stirring the soil and keeping it warm and moist, 
dramatically increased volatilization rates. In test tubes containing soils 
with 100 parts per million of selenium, they were able to remove 51% of the 
element in 118 days. Absorbed in their research, Frankenberger and Karlson 
ignored the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, they heard none of the screams of outrage when the state shut down the 
San Luis Drain and threatened to end irrigation in the area. They heard none of 
the debate over the cleanup plans. One from Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory would 
have replaced contaminated water with selenium-free water. Another the lab 
offered would have immobilized selenium in pond sediments. The bureau proposed 
a more familiar route: Create a dump. They heard nothing until the news article 
in March, when the state and environmentalists agreed that the LBL plans were 
"research" and that a toxic dump was the best way to halt bird deaths. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew the name -- Kesterson -- and that it had selenium problems," 
Frankenberger remembers. "But I knew absolutely nothing about the alternatives 
for cleanup until I read that story." 
</P>
<P>
Frankenberger's first response was tentative. He and Karlson gave a summary of 
their research to a Bureau of Reclamation environmental engineer they knew. The 
most they hoped for was a chance to conduct field tests at Kesterson to prove 
their research. The response stunned them. 
</P>
<P>
In June, a copy of an LBL report was sent anonymously to Frankenberger's lab. 
In part, the report read: "We were jolted into a decision to quickly set up a 
volatilization experiment after we received a copy of the . . . letter and 
manuscript sent by Bill Frankenberger to . . . the Bureau of Reclamation's 
Sacramento office." It concluded: The "data supports Frankenberger's proposal 
for selenium volatilization as a cleanup process." 
</P>
<P>
"I was extremely upset," says Frankenberger. He had never heard from LBL, a 
courtesy he expected if another lab intended to duplicate his unpublished 
research. Would LBL steal his thunder, if not his data? "I wanted to make sure 
we would be the ones involved in field tests, not LBL," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But how could he protect his claim on volatilization? He could go to the 
newspapers with his research, but that could jeopardize his career. It was a 
big leap from a few test-tube results to proposing a plan to clean up 
Kesterson. Besides, protocol meant waiting until research had been reviewed by 
one's peers in a respected journal before announcing anything publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Frankenberger paced outside his home for several nights. "I put a big path in 
my back yard," he says. "I didn't want to get out on a limb where my 
credibility would be questioned if it didn't work." He discussed options with 
Karlson, who agreed to abide by his decision. Then he rolled the dice. 
</P>
<P>
They applied for a patent on the "Frankenberger-Karlson process." They made an 
appointment to see Bureau of Reclamation officials. And they called a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Oleh Weres, a chemist who had helped LBL pioneer the basic research on selenium 
poisoning and who had been part of an early decision to discard volatilization 
as being too slow to clean the reservoir, was shocked when the press called for 
comments. He called Frankenberger's theories "half-baked" and pointed out that 
they had undergone no formal peer review. (Later, Weres, reluctant to discuss 
LBL's duplication of the Frankenberger-Karlson process, said, "We did just 
enough to figure out what was going on.") 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the scientists from Northern and Southern California reached an 
uneasy truce. Frankenberger and Karlson gave Weres more details about their 
process; Weres gave them a better way to measure volatilization. In July, 1987, 
the bureau anointed Frankenberger: It gave the UC Riverside researchers $50,000 
to begin field tests at Kesterson. 
</P>
<P>
GOSH, IT'S so big," Frankenberger said as he and Karlson stood on the road that 
topped a narrow Kesterson levee and tried to imagine cleaning up an area so 
vast that they couldn't even see its boundaries. It was a hot, dusty day at the 
end of July. Most of the ponds were dry because the San Luis Drain had been 
closed the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
They gathered soil samples during the day and hunched over a table in a tiny 
Los Banos motel at night to plan their field-test strategy. They wanted a year 
of tests. Since their findings were due at the bureau in March, they had to 
settle for eight months. Although they hoped that the fieldwork would prove the 
one-year-cleanup theory, they thought the fungi would still provide a digestive 
solution for Kesterson if the method cut the selenium concentration in the soil 
by at least 20% a year. 
</P>
<P>
They knew the bureau was not planning to wait for their results to act at 
Kesterson. The most it had promised was to use the process, if it worked, in 
remedial cleanup after the dump was constructed. Still, Frankenberger and 
Karlson thought, if the field tests worked like the lab tests . . . 
</P>
<P>
They could envision "farming" the entire 1,280 acres: spreading manure, straw 
and orange peelings, plowing the soil and installing a sprinkler system. They 
estimated the cost at $2,200 an acre, or $2.8 million total. If the cleanup 
lasted longer than a year, an additional $1,000 per acre per year would be 
required. Once the selenium was diffused, the bureau would be able to flood 
Kesterson with clean water and restore the wetlands habitat for waterfowl. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Frankenberger was dealt two hard blows. The fungi weren't working 
fast enough. The test hadn't begun until September; he had missed the hot 
summer months when the fungi worked best. He needed warm weather to show what 
the fungi could do, and even with that, the field tests indicated that the lab 
volatilization rates would always outstrip field results because of seasonal 
and nightly temperature drops. "If only I had a giant hair dryer," he moaned. 
</P>
<P>
Then he discovered that the bureau planned to bulldoze his test plots at the 
same time it created the dump. He could lose the only chance he had to prove 
that the fungi could work in a situation like Kesterson. 
</P>
<P>
Karlson and Frankenberger were desperate. "We felt we should be given a 
chance," Frankenberger says. "All we really wanted was the summer months." 
</P>
<P>
They decided to try an end run around the bureaucracy. Frankenberger lobbied 
U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), state senators, water-quality officials and 
powerful environmentalist organizations; Karlson devoted himself to the lab and 
the plots. They described their results at scientific conferences. 
</P>
<P>
Karlson began to worry about his future. "I was beginning to doubt if doing 
field tests was the right thing to do for my career," he remembers. "A 
post-doc's job is to publish at some point. It was not that I didn't have the 
data. I had a whole drawer full of data. I was getting tired of the long trips 
to Kesterson." 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1988, about a month before the bulldozing was to begin, LBL 
hydrogeologist Sally Benson scraped 6 inches of dirt from empty Kesterson 
ponds. She watched ground water ooze back into the excavation sites and bring 
toxic levels of selenium along with it. It was clear that creating the $48.2 
million dump would only re-create the disaster. Californians would end up with 
two hazardous-waste sites for the price of three: The bureau estimated that 
solving the new problem would cost an additional $96.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the bureaucracy ground to a halt. Citing Frankenberger's process as a 
possible alternative, the Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development of the 
U.S. House Appropriations Committee, which was responsible for approving the 
money for the bureau's dump, stopped funding for the bulldozing. It told the 
Department of the Interior to order the Bureau of Reclamation to ask the state 
to reconsider the toxic-dump plan. 
</P>
<P>
On July 5, Frankenberger, working in his laboratory, answered the telephone. 
When he replaced the receiver, he threw his head back and let out a whoop of 
victory. The state had delayed its cleanup order. It declared that 
Frankenberger's process, "if viable, . . . is a preferable cleanup technique." 
</P>
<P>
"Frankenberger Instrumental in Stopping Bureaucracy," the headlines should have 
screamed. "For the first time, the government has recognized a natural solution 
to massive cleanup problems," the story should have read. But the details 
indicated another theme: Frankenberger wins the war but loses the battle for 
Kesterson. 
</P>
<P>
"Viable," according to the state, meant that the fungi must be able to clean up 
Kesterson in two years -- in 1991, after a final review in 1989. From his 
winter results, Frankenberger knew that the fungi couldn't do it. Five years 
maybe, but not two. 
</P>
<P>
But the issue of "viability" was actually moot. What Frankenberger didn't know 
was that the state, alarmed by Benson's findings, had decided to cover the low 
areas of Kesterson with enough dirt to raise the ground 6 inches above the high 
water table. The idea was to prevent the rise of selenium-contaminated ground 
water into ephemeral pools -- and the deaths of more birds -- during the 
1988-89 rainy season. 
</P>
<P>
In October, Frankenberger and Karlson grimly watched "truck after truck after 
truck after truck" of fill dirt roll past their research site. They had written 
a letter to the bureau protesting the decision but had received no reply. 
Bulldozers spread 6 inches to 3 feet of soil over 600 acres of Kesterson that 
were below the high water table and the selenium-eating fungi that lived there. 
</P>
<P>
By December, the reservoir was bleak and barren. It looked as if it had been 
prepared for the 16 giant malls, complete with parking lots, that could fit 
there. No waterfowl could be poisoned there. But then, no waterfowl could live 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Kesterson Reservoir was a desert. 
</P>
<P>
THE STATE OF California is expected to decide on the final cleanup plan for 
Kester son next month. The Bureau of Reclamation has already made its position 
clear: The leveling of Kesterson means that the cleanup is complete, the goal 
of no more bird deaths has been met and the reservoir needs only monitoring. 
"We will have elevated levels of selenium there, but we will not have it moving 
into the ground water or into the food chain," says Susan Hoffman, manager of 
the bureau's Kesterson program. 
</P>
<P>
But what represents an adequate cleanup to Hoffman and the bureau hasn't 
convinced others. "The Bureau of Reclamation has gone a long way to halting the 
immediate threat to waterfowl," says Ken Tanji, a UC Davis professor of water 
science and the administrative coordinator of UC's Salinity /Drainage Task 
Force. "In the long run, whether selenium will stay (buried) and not 
contaminate the surface is open to conjecture. It depends on the seasonal rise 
of ground water." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Frankenberger is less sanguine. "Filling Kesterson was a major mistake," 
he says. "This is going to haunt us for hundreds of years. It's an extremely 
good possibility that selenium will contaminate the fill material. I would have 
preferred to see a few more bird deaths than this." 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Deason, coordinator of the Interior Department's National Irrigation 
Water Quality Project, guffaws when he considers the situation. A drained and 
leveled Kesterson, or even the environmentalist-preferred lined toxic dump, he 
says, "is certainly not a model" for other areas where as much as 200,000 acres 
is contaminated by selenium and other poisons. "The tremendous volume of dirt 
and water makes removal and encapsulation impossible. Conventional 
hazardous-waste cleanup . . . just won't work." 
</P>
<P>
Even Hoffman finds little hope for the future in Kesterson: "We may do penance 
at Kesterson," she admits. "It may not be the best solution in terms of money, 
time or effect." 
</P>
<P>
Real solutions, according to Deason, who monitors 200 scientists focusing on 
the agricultural waste-water problem, are prevention (in the form of new 
methods of irrigation being developed as part of the research prompted by 
Kesterson); the possible abandonment of farming in some areas (despite 
multimillion-dollar losses), and the cleaning up of existing contamination, 
employing bioremediation solutions such as Frankenberger's fungi. 
</P>
<P>
At his test plots in February, Frankenberger struck a few poses with a shovel 
for a visiting university film crew doing a story on his research. Karlson, his 
post-doctoral appointment at an end, had already joined the Biotechnology 
Research Institute in Braunschweig, West Germany, to conduct microbial ecology 
work. "I remember when Uli and I did all this ourselves," Frankenberger said, 
throwing the shovel aside and watching bureau workers spread orange peels, 
manure, straw and two new materials -- casein and soybean -- onto research 
plots. 
</P>
<P>
Frankenberger's one assistant and $38,000 have turned into 23 scientists and 
lab assistants; a new, larger laboratory; and since 1987, $1.02 million in 
research grants. He and Karlson have published four papers in scientific 
journals; seven have been accepted for publication, and three others are being 
reviewed. Oleh Weres at LBL is using the Frankenberger-Karlson process on a 
project to clean up San Luis Drain sediments, and a plan is being tested to use 
the fungi to clean up evaporation ponds on private land. Frankenberger hopes to 
get a new study going at Kesterson when the first ends in September. The new 
research would delve deeper into what happens during volatilization. He is also 
researching microbial volatilization of selenium in water through bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
At the Kesterson plots, his fungi continue to show promising results. They are 
cleaning soils with 40 parts per million of selenium -- about average at 
Kesterson -- at a rate of 28% a year. But, cautious now about making 
predictions, Frankenberger warns that as selenium concentrations are reduced, 
the fungi work more slowly. Still, even if fungi take 10 years to clean up 
Kesterson, he says, it's a better method than burying the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Will the method ever be applied? Perhaps if the water table rises, or if 
research being done nearby by UC Davis and LBL succeeds in using plants to draw 
selenium up and out of the soil -- or at least close enough to the surface that 
the fungi could do their work. 
</P>
<P>
Frankenberger, looking out over the stark emptiness of Kesterson, can't quite 
see himself battling to get the money and the go-ahead for such an ultimate 
cleanup. "Perhaps I made an important first step at bioremediation as a cleanup 
technique, but I just want to get back into science and get out of the 
political arena," he said in February. "All this was too much for me." 
</P>
<P>
He gave the workers a few last orders, slumped into a rented car with a 
laboratory assistant at the wheel and was driven off along the narrow levee 
road that pierces the dry, flat land like an arrow. Shore birds, ducks, marsh 
birds and coots in the still-lush -- and still-contaminated -- Grasslands on 
the west side of the road heard the car's engine and whooshed into the air. 
From a distance, their shrieks, hoots and whistles sounded like the roaring 
crowd in a stadium.

RECORD RACK: K.D. LANG "ABSOLUTE TORCH AND TWANG." SIRE *** 1/2: ALBUMS ARE 
RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC).

<P>
On her third album, Lang takes a few jaunts accompanied by some venerable 
ghosts of pop music past, the most spectacular result being a superlative 
version of the Faron Young-Willie Nelson song "Three Days." Imagine Patsy Cline 
seeing Judy Garland through the eyes of Billie Holiday (no joke) on this tune 
about the utter self-abasement that can hit when love vanishes. 
</P>
<P>
But Lang is only guided by those musical spirits, not possessed by them. While 
she can summon up their emotional vulnerability, the difference for Lang is 
that loss, no matter how painfully expressed in some of the songs here, never 
gives way to despair. The tone is set in the opening tune, "Luck in My Eyes," 
which Lang delivers with a sense of inner strength that hovers over even the 
most downtrodden tales that follow. Through the record's Western 
swing/honky-tonk musical milieu, Lang taps into characters who, like the 
frontier women of old, mostly know what they want and know how to get it. RANDY

<P>
Summer is the hottest season for the movie industry, when it makes its major 
gambles -- including substantial wagers on new discoveries. The young nes can 
come from anywhere. This group hails from such distant points as suburban New 
Jersey and suburban Minnesota to the Sonoma Valley of California and the Hunter 
Valley in New South Wales. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder the forces behind the upcoming James Bond film, "License to Kill," 
thought Talisa Soto was right for the role of a former Miss Galaxy who fell in 
with the wrong crowd. Nature was good to her. At 22, she is enormously 
beautiful: dark hair, full lips, almond eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a pale-blue denim shirt and black leggings, Soto turns heads at the Bel 
Age. But she doesn't seem to notice; she's used to it. She fell into modeling 
almost effortlessly at 15, she relates, when she showed up at New York's Click 
agency in quest of a summer job. "I walked in on a Friday and got a job on 
Sunday," she remembers. 
</P>
<P>
Her first assignment was in Italy for Lei magazine. A few days later, she was 
in Paris for British Vogue. Now, she thinks she was too young to savor the 
experience. "I lost a pound a day," she recalls. "I wanted my mom's cooking, or 
pizza. I wasn't into the saucy meals." 
</P>
<P>
She's wiser now, and happy to acknowledge that she's acquired a tough veneer. 
"I might have an edge and I would love to develop that even more," she says. 
"Because if you're too sweet -- forget it, darling. Always question everything 
and don't be gullible. You are your own boss." 
</P>
<P>
One requirement of the Bond job is publicizing the product. But with Soto's 
strong instinct for self-protection, she's not entirely comfortable meeting the 
press. One of the perks of being a big star, she imagines, is being able to 
turn down requests for interviews -- but the Bond producers will have none of 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Director Paul Morrissey, who cast Soto in his feature, "Spike of Bensonhurst," 
says Soto's reserve makes her intriguing on screen. "She's very quiet and 
withheld, and the more she withholds, the more you're attracted to her," he 
explains. "She's kind of a femme fatale. She has a kind of dignity." 
</P>
<P>
However reserved she may be, Soto found her leading man, Timothy Dalton, even 
more reserved: "Between actors, there should be give-and-take. I'm not saying 
he's selfish, but at certain times he would put up this wall. He's very serious 
and very English." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, "License to Kill" was a relatively confining experience, especially 
after the freewheeling set of the low-budget "Spike of Bensonhurst." 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to make this part as strong as possible," she says. "I wanted to make 
my character manipulative. (But) I realize in the Bond thing, they try to have 
a formula. They don't go for any spontaneity." 
</P>
<P>
And shooting for 5 1/2 months, with an extended stay in Mexico City, was no 
picnic, either. "It was great for the first month," she says. "The downfall in 
this business is staying in hotel rooms. If you're in your own surroundings, 
you're in luck. Going out to dinners, room service -- you get depressed. You 
cry for nothing. It's ridiculous. But tough luck, baby. You chose to do this." 
</P>
<P>
Even at the tender age of 15, Soto assumed a no-nonsense attitude about her 
career. "For me, the first day I started working I realized this doesn't last 
forever," she says. "It's quite obvious. It's all based on beauty and youth." 
So she kept the modeling in perspective. "You use it," she explains. "It gives 
you the freedom to do so much more. I view it as a job." 
</P>
<P>
Soto grew up in Northampton, Mass., the youngest of four children born to 
working-class Puerto Rican parents. She finished high school, then moved to New 
York when her modeling career took off. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, modeling became boring and acting became interesting. She attacked 
improvisation classes with her mind-over-matter determination: "When I knew I 
was so scared, I said, 'Now I know I have to make an effort.' When you feel you 
can't do something, you have to say, 'I'm going to do it.' " And the effort 
paid off. "I was quite shy, and it helped me realize that if you want to 
accomplish things, they don't listen to the quiet ones," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Soto got into the movies through Morrissey, who is represented by Flick, the 
talent arm of the New York agency that handled Soto's modeling career. 
Morrissey says photographers at Click, the modeling division, referred to Soto 
as "the Puerto Rican Grace Kelly." But with her air of mystery, he says, she 
reminded him of Gene Tierney or Garbo. He adds that her beauty didn't hurt. 
"The real history of the cinema is the history of great-looking people," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
KELLY LYNCH 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Lynch comes to an interview wearing no makeup, no nail polish, with her 
blondish hair hanging limp to her shoulders. Dressed in an dark green T-shirt 
and baggy black pants, the former model isn't making a fashion statement. It's 
hardly what you'd expect of a starlet with a major role behind her (in 
"Cocktail," opposite Tom Cruise) and three pictures coming out this summer. 
</P>
<P>
But Lynch says she's embarrassed about "Cocktail" and she hardly thinks of 
herself as a starlet. She'd rather play a real person, as opposed to beautiful 
bimbo roles -- in movies as well as in life. That's why she proclaims herself 
particularly pleased with her roles in two smaller films, "Drugstore Cowboy" 
and "Warm Summer Rain," even though her role as Patrick Swayze's love interest 
in the just-opened "Road House," is a bigger-budget studio film that might give 
her higher visibility. 
</P>
<P>
"In these next movies, I have layers to the characters. I didn't have to have a 
makeup artist on me every five minutes making sure I looked beautiful. I can do 
that, but it's an illusion. After a while, I want to geek out," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"Drugstore Cowboy" producer Cary Brokaw says Lynch was true to her word in her 
role opposite Matt Dillon. "If Kelly has a type, she was playing the far 
extreme away from it," he says. "She plays a young woman addicted to drugs 
who's spent most of her life in prison. She's an '80s equivalent to Ma Barker. 
She's sort of played down her good looks, as much as that's possible." 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, Lynch careened around New York on a motorcycle and led a life 
that was "a little, like, you know, experimental." But now she's a single 
mother with a 3-year-old girl, Shane. "I want to be around for her," Lynch 
explains. "I try to be a daredevil in my work, but not my life." 
</P>
<P>
Coy about her age, Lynch acknowledges that she was born 20-some years ago in a 
Minneapolis suburb called Golden Valley. "I had a mother like June Cleaver and 
a little sister I used to beat up regularly," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Her father was a restaurateur who didn't encourage her interest in performing. 
"My mom was always sneaking me off to dance class and acting class," Lynch 
says. "My dad was worried that I was going to be what I've become. He was 
worried that I wouldn't make enough money to eat." 
</P>
<P>
She barely sampled college before pulling out to pursue acting. But her career 
was almost ended before it began by a car crash that threatened to leave her 
paralyzed. She spent months recuperating. 
</P>
<P>
"It was actually the best thing that ever happened to me," she says. "I decided 
I wouldn't limit myself. When you really get your life taken away from you for 
a long period of time, you (later) go at it with a different sense of purpose 
and drive." 
</P>
<P>
After recovering, Lynch went to New York and surprised herself by landing 
modeling jobs -- posing for catalogue. "I kept waiting for them to take the 
clothes off me and tell me to wash my face. I had this image of myself as a 
goofy-looking thing." 
</P>
<P>
Still, she says, her assignments weren't particularly glamorous. "Anybody can 
make a $5,000 dress look good, but it's a really great model who can put on a 
housecoat and sell it across America," she laughs. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch almost apologizes for the television roles on "Miami Vice" and the cable 
series "Hitchhiker" that got her started as an actor: "I assumed I was going to 
be working in theater. But I had a rude awakening with rent and food and the 
cost of living. How can people do that and work on the stage? I wasn't that 
clever." 
</P>
<P>
She first appeared in movies in a small role as a jaded model in "Bright 
Lights, Big City." Then she went on to "Cocktail" as the insecure (and often 
scantily clothed) wife of Tom Cruise's best friend, fellow bartender Bryan 
Brown. But much of her performance was edited out of the film. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was more interesting as written," she says. "We had a dark story 
about the '80s and it ended up being about flipping bottles and a stupid love 
story." 
</P>
<P>
Cruise, the hottest male star going, seemed uptight. His character repels her 
in the film -- but there was that one moment where they kiss -- the moment of 
"heat." She says that Cruise kept his lips firmly compressed during their 
supposedly-passionate kiss. 
</P>
<P>
Another rude shock occurred when United Artists canceled her next picture, 
"Atuk," on the first day of shooting because of the studio's disputes with star 
Sam Kinison. But UA rerouted her into "Road House," in which Swayze plays a 
bouncer with a degree in philosophy. She's a doctor who becomes his sweetheart. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch seems slightly baffled by the recent heat on her. She maintains that 
stardom isn't her goal. "I'd rather do a small movie that just a few people see 
than a big movie that I'm not proud of," she insists. "The integrity part of 
this is as important to me as anything. I'm still an idiot and I look at this 
as an art." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ROBERT SHAWN LENARD 
</P>
<P>
At 20, Robert Shawn Leonard worries that he hasn't suffered enough to be great. 
He has convinced a lot of people that he's a pretty good actor but he thinks a 
lot of people are easily pleased. "You sort of get cast as a kid and you sort 
of just have to play a kid," he says simply. "It's really later, when you get 
into roles in Chekhov when you have to have incredible resources to fall back 
on." 
</P>
<P>
But there's "talk" around town, fired by advance screenings of the film "The 
Dead Poet's Society," that Leonard manages to stand out in a group of seven 
young actors who play Robin Williams' students. Williams portrays an English 
teacher who sets out to inspire his prep school wards. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first major motion picture role for Leonard, who has been 
concentrating in theater since he appeared at age 12 in a summer stock version 
of "The Music Man." 
</P>
<P>
Joked Robin Williams of Leonard: "If Laurence Olivier and James Dean had a kid, 
this is what it would look like." 
</P>
<P>
But he went on to say that Leonard combines a theatrical talent with a strong, 
emotive film presence. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Leonard is thoroughly American, Australian Peter Weir, who directed 
the film, saw something of the theatrically trained British actor in Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby struck me as magic from the moment he first read for the part," Weir 
says. "In his work, he combines the best of the British (stage) actor with the 
best of the American screen actor. He has the training and discipline that most 
British actors get, (and) the camera loves him, which makes for a unique 
leading man." 
</P>
<P>
The young actor says Weir sought a theatrical performance focused more on his 
body language than his facial expressions. "He was really into the 
physicality," he explains. "Most film work is taking what's in your head and 
showing it in your eyes. I'm not sure I have that much inside me yet." 
</P>
<P>
But has his life has been too normal? He grew up in an "average suburban town" 
in New Jersey. His father is a retired teacher, his mother is a nurse. "My 
parents are still together, I don't do drugs . . . . Why am I an actor?" he 
asks wryly. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard followed "Dead Poets" with a stint in a free one-act play in a 
theater-bar in New York. "All the theaters are sort of in my backyard here and 
I know everyone . . . . I've never taken an acting class, never studied. But in 
a way, it is studying, going from play to play," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood scene strikes Leonard as far less nourishing: "In L.A., actors 
just sort of come and go. There's no base, no center where you see other actors 
and study their work." Nonetheless, movies have their place in a young actor's 
life. "The money's great," Leonard admits. "It certainly pays for doing 
theater. I audition for everything." 
</P>
<P>
Before "Dead Poets," Leonard had a couple of roles in small films and in TV 
movies. On Broadway, he starred as Eugene in Neil Simon's "Brighton Beach 
Memoirs" and shared the stage with Derek Jacoby in the British play, "Breaking 
the Code." 
</P>
<P>
While he pursues his career, Leonard also is toiling as a student at Fordham 
University in New York. "Right now, I'm weeding the garden of Plato's Republic, 
which has been hell for me," he says. "I've been studying part time for three 
years, on and off, and I plan to finish before I die." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing in Leonard's life at the moment seems likely to provide the baptism of 
fire that he thinks he lacks. But he finds consolation in considering that his 
hero, Jimmy Stewart, also had a fairly stable background. And Stewart, in 
response to several fan letters, wrote to endorse Leonard's plan to stay in the 
theater for the time being. "He wrote, 'It's the best training for an actor,' " 
Leonard says happily. "If I can't follow Jimmy Stewart's advice, I don't know 
whose I would." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
YAHOO SERIOUS 
</P>
<P>
If Warner Brothers is right, Yahoo Serious will prove to be more than just 
another fresh face in the movies this summer. He will be a sudden sensation, 
duplicating his phenomenal success in his native Australia with his first film, 
"Young Einstein." 
</P>
<P>
How much does the studio believe in this bizarre blending of Paul Hogan and Pee 
Wee Herman? Enough to spend (they say) $8 million or more to market a movie 
that cost just under $4 million to make. So keen were Warner executives to show 
him off at February's ShoWest film market in Las Vegas that they offered to 
send the corporate jet to retrieve him from his honeymoon in Africa. Serious 
caught a regular flight, just like a regular guy. 
</P>
<P>
A regular guy he isn't. At 35 he hardly looks like one, with electrified orange 
hair and unusual sartorial tastes. On a stopover in Los Angeles, he was wearing 
what he refers to as his "Elvis Presley pink" suit with tailor's measurements 
printed on the fabric and a strip of buttons running along the seams. His socks 
were pink and yellow. 
</P>
<P>
He says, sweetly, "It's an anti-fashion statement." 
</P>
<P>
Not only did he star in "Young Einstein," but he also wrote, produced, directed 
and edited it. He worked feverishly to maintain creative control through five 
years of permutations that finally brought it to the big screen. The effort 
paid off when the picture became the fourth-biggest box office producer in 
Australian history, behind the two "Crocodile Dundees" and "E.T. the Extra 
Terrestrial" 
</P>
<P>
Serious describes his film as "a cross between 'Lawrence of Arabia' and a Bugs 
Bunny cartoon." 
</P>
<P>
(He performed his own stunts, including break-dancing, hot-air ballooning, 
horse riding, surfing, high diving and cliff climbing. In fact, his recent 
honeymoon with co-star Lulu Pinkus sounded like something out of the movie. 
Says Serious: "We've been white-water rafting down the crocodile-infested 
Zambezi River.") 
</P>
<P>
The plot follows the young radical Einstein's adventures through the invention 
of the electric guitar and a love affair with Marie Curie. (In one satirical 
shot, Einstein is ejected from a Sydney University lecture hall filled with 
sheep.) 
</P>
<P>
So what's with his name? Serious adopted it years ago (from the more pedestrian 
Greg Pead) and offers no coherent explanation. But he says it works with his 
new life as auteur: "When I perform, I'm 'Yahoo,' and when I'm the director, 
I'm 'Serious.' " 
</P>
<P>
Serious grew up in Hunter Valley on the northern coast of New South Wales. 
After dropping out of school at 15, he briefly adopted his father's trade of 
fitting tires. He dabbled in painting, attended art school for a couple of 
years, then drifted into TV production. 
</P>
<P>
But he dropped out again and went wanderlusting on an extended international 
hitchhiking expedition that ultimately provided the inspiration for "Young 
Einstein." The idea came to him on a trip down the Amazon when he spotted a 
Brazilian wearing a T-shirt depicting the inventor as an elderly man, sticking 
out his tongue. 
</P>
<P>
Will success spoil Serious? He thinks not but he doesn't back away from media 
scrutiny. "I kind of love it," he says. "And I don't do anything I don't want 
to do." In that vein, he recently agreed to appear on Australia's "60 Minutes" 
program as long as he could interview himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I lashed myself with a really hard question: 'How do you cope with suddenly 
being chased around and being a sex symbol?' It's a really horrible question, a 
crass question," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"So how did I answer?" He pauses for effect. "I said, 'Well, I could ask you 
the same question.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WINONA RYDER 
</P>
<P>
Diminutive Winona Ryder, with her innocent brown eyes, may have one of the 
summer's most dicey roles -- playing Jerry Lee Lewis' 13-year-old cousin and 
bride. Even though she's all of 17, she worried about her love-making scenes 
with 34-year-old leading man Dennis Quaid. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that I was really freaked out about was -- how it was going to 
look?" she says. "Because, literally, I look about 11 years old. My hair's back 
in a ponytail and I'm wearing these little Peter Pan-collar things and I just 
look so young. And he looks older. I was really concerned that people were 
going to see it and go, 'This is so perverted -- 34 and 17.' 
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid that was going to take away from them watching the movie, that 
all they were going to be thinking about was Winona Ryder and Dennis Quaid, not 
the love story. 
</P>
<P>
"But Jerry Lee and Myra -- as weird as it was -- I think they really were in 
love with each other and I really wanted that to come across. I wanted to come 
across like, it was love and when love comes so strong, there is no right or 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Ryder finally met Myra, when she was invited to attend one of the screenings of 
the "dailies": "I was so nervous. We were showing her some stuff where he was 
picking her up from school and says, 'I'm gonna marry you.' And it goes to the 
wedding. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked over and she was crying and I was so scared because I didn't know 
what she was crying about. I didn't know if she was crying because I was a bad 
actress or that it was so real. 
</P>
<P>
"And then she turned to me and hugged me and said, 'You're a gift from God.' It 
was probably the most amazing feeling that I've ever had in connection with 
acting, to have that kind of approval." 
</P>
<P>
Ryder has little in common with a 13-year-old growing up in Memphis in the '50s 
("It's the absolute opposite of me," she says). But she admits that she's not 
entirely grown up yet, either. "Now, amazingly, people look at me -- I don't 
even want to say it but -- not like a little girl anymore," she confesses. "I'm 
talking about guys. It is sort of strange because I'm not, like, this really 
experienced -- I don't really know what to do in . . . situations." 
</P>
<P>
She laughs. "This is a strange place to be when you're 17. I'm still jailbait, 
really. Thank God. When I turn 18, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
All this made her scenes with Quaid awkward, particularly because her leading 
man immersed himself in the role of the wildly unpredictable rocker of living 
legend. 
</P>
<P>
"I never knew when he was being himself," she says. "When he would say 
something to me, I didn't know if it was him saying it or Jerry Lee Lewis 
saying it. I did sort of get confused from time to time. On the whole, he was 
just very, sort of, obsessed. Obsessed and possessed." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, Quaid/Lewis played the protective role toward young 
Ryder/Myra. And Ryder thinks the unnerving aspects of his behavior helped her. 
"During actual filming, my stomach was sort of coming up through my throat," 
she explains. "When he gets into it, he gets into it. I was a little scared, 
but that's great because Myra was scared a lot. When he would yell at her, when 
he would not trust her, when he would accuse her of being unfaithful, what 
could she do? When he would come on to her, no one had ever come on to Myra 
before. So I think all my -- Winona's -- reactions worked very well for her 
reactions, too." 
</P>
<P>
"Great Balls of Fire" producer Adam Fields says Ryder isn't feigning the role 
of ingenue. "Winona is a very young 17," he says. "She's not like New York or 
Hollywood kids." Originally, he considered Emily Lloyd or even Holly Hunter for 
the part, but Ryder surprised him with her performance: "She reminds me of 
Elizabeth Taylor in 'National Velvet' or a young Audrey Hepburn." 
</P>
<P>
Until this summer, Ryder's best-known role was as the mournful daughter in 
"Beetlejuice." 
</P>
<P>
The character seems alien considering Ryder's exuberance, but she says 
appearances are misleading. "I've gone through very dark stages where I would 
only wear black," she explains. "I went through that stage right before I did 
that movie, so it was a cinch. I was very dramatic. I was like a living sigh. 
It was my 'Sunset Boulevard' thing." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, Ryder's enthusiasm for life is fully restored. She and her best 
friend, model Heather Bursch, have plans. "I want to do the backpack thing -- 
first drive across the United States, rent a car and bring no money and no 
clothes and write really bad poetry," she says, dissolving into a self-mocking 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"Do the whole Jack Kerouac thing. Then we want to go to Europe and do it there. 
We also want to go to Africa. We want to go to college together. We want to end 
up in Trinity in Ireland for the last two years but the first two years we want 
to go somewhere in the United States." Meanwhile, she's taking guitar, piano, 
cooking and fencing. "And I write a lot," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Ryder grew up in Petaluma . She's the third of four children born to Cindy and 
Michael Horowitz; her mother makes educational videos, and her father runs a 
bookstore specializing in the '60s and the counterculture. The daughter chose 
her current surname when she started acting. 
</P>
<P>
Ryder's acting career lifted off effortlessly when she was 12. "I started going 
to a little acting class and a casting director was there by chance," she says. 
Her success came as a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought about acting but it wasn't a life ambition," she says. "When an 
agent called me, I said, 'Well, what do you do?' I never had to really work for 
the things I got . . . . I concentrate a lot and I'm a really hard worker, but

She debuted in "Lucas" when she was 13. She followed with roles in "Square 
Dance," "Beetlejuice," "1969" and the recent black comedy about teen suicide, 
"Heathers." 
</P>
<P>
Ryder's work prevented her from attending her local high school so she studied 
independently and completed her high school requirements with a perfect 4-point 
average. While she feels some yearning for the prom and other adolescent 
trappings, she wasn't especially happy at her school. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not Miss Popularity," she says. "Me and Heather were sort of the geeks. 
Nobody ever paid attention to us or if they did, it was all negative . . . . 
They confronted us a lot. They would say, 'You're going to go nowhere.' It's 
funny. Now, she's in Elle and I'm sure all those girls are feeling a little bit 
stupid."

'When the causes of the Decline of Western Civilization are finally writ," 
wrote Daily Variety four years ago, "Hollywood will surely have to answer why 
it turned one of man's most significant art forms over to the 
self-gratification of high-schoolers." 
</P>
<P>
Variety, the daily diary of the Hollywood dream, was essentially chastising its 
own readers for pandering to adolescent tastes with films that were low in 
protein and high in saturated fats. Movies, especially summer movies, were 
feeding young minds a diet of graphic gore, repetitious science fiction and 
voyeuristic sex comedies. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, Hollywood seemed intent on disproving the notion that youngsters 
today are smarter than ever. 
</P>
<P>
However, in making its doomsday prognosis, Variety made one questionable 
assumption -- that commercial film-making is a significant art form -- and 
overlooked a couple of related trends. Although Hollywood would be the last to 
know, American demographics were skewing older. The pool of easy-to-please 
teen-age consumers was shrinking while adults of all ages were returning en 
masse to movies via their handy videocassette recorders. 
</P>
<P>
"Video renters have always been a little older (than moviegoers)," says Meir 
Hed, co-owner of the Videotheque chain of video stores in Los Angeles. "They 
would wait for movies to come out, and watch them at home. They rediscovered 
the pleasure of movies through video, watching films that weren't chopped up 
and interrupted by commercials. That got them going back to movies." 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers are still a dominant force in the market -- witness the lineup of 
"no-brainer" sequels coming out this summer -- but the video after-market has 
dramatically altered the makeup of the industry's consumer base and has 
prompted a basic change in the quality and variety of films being made. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, the major studios were almost exclusively the manufacturers of 
teen-age toys. Adult-theme movies were left to independent film makers and 
boutique distributors, and summers were virtually conceded to people who were 
still growing up. 
</P>
<P>
Pick a summer early in this decade and you'll have trouble finding a film that 
didn't include lasers, slit throats or giddy shower scenes. In 1983, 
Avco-Embassy was modestly rewarded for releasing Ingmar Bergman's "Fanny and 
Alexander" during the summer, and a year later, Universal dropped John Huston's 
"Under the Volcano" off at a few theaters. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until 1985, however, when another Huston film proved to the industry 
that a good adult-theme movie could do good business during the summer. 
"Prizzi's Honor," a sophisticated gangster comedy that also beat the odds 
against early releases getting Oscar nominations, grossed nearly $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Hector Babenco's "The Kiss of the Spider Woman" and John Boorman's "The Emerald 
Forest" also did well that summer, and the onus on adult-oriented summer films 
was lifted. Last summer, there were more than a dozen certifiably "smart" 
pictures playing in theaters and a couple of them -- "A Fish Called Wanda" and 
"Bull Durham" -- did some smart business for their distributors. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the other films released last summer, unthinkable choices three or four 
years earlier, were "Married to the Mob," "Tucker," "The Last Temptation of 
Christ," "Eight Men Out," "Clean and Sober," "Crossing Delancey" and "Midnight 
Run." 
</P>
<P>
Most of those films were R-rated, and those that weren't were clearly not meant 
to appeal to kids. The distributors, driven by market forces that didn't exist 
10 years ago, were supplying two essential demands. They were providing movies 
for adults who go to theaters year-round, and they were putting into the 
pipeline titles that would be released on video the following winter and 
spring, when demand is greatest in that market. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to very careful in terms of scheduling (films for theatrical 
release)," says Robert Klingensmith, president of Paramount Pictures' very 
successful video division. "The video market has strong and weak seasons, too, 
and you want to time it so your summer hits are on the video shelves when there 
is the greatest demand." 
</P>
<P>
Art Murphy, who watches industry trends for Variety, says that the film 
business remains a hits-driven business and that the year's biggest hits still 
emerge during summer, when 40% of the $4-billion theatrical grosses are 
accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
"The films that you read about as having huge video sales, most of them are 
summer releases," Murphy says. "Films that are big in theaters are big in every 
other market." 
</P>
<P>
"E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial" proves the point. Steven Spielberg's sentimental 
tale about a boy and his pal from outer space became the most popular film in 
history when it was released in the summer of 1982. Last Christmas, when it 
finally made it to the video stores, it claimed the crown in that arena, too. 
MCA-Universal pumped 15 million taped copies of the movie into the video market 
with a retail price tag of $29.95. (Universal and Spielberg's Amblin 
Entertainment reportedly each got $5 per tape, or $75 million each from the 
sale.) 
</P>
<P>
We've come a long way from the days, not all that long ago, when the American 
studios released films in theaters here and abroad, milked them in second-run 
houses and drive-ins, then waited seven years for a handsome payoff for network 
airings on TV. The formula now is American and foreign theatrical releases, 
followed from six to nine months later by a video release, followed a few 
months later by a pay-cable release, followed a year or so later -- if anybody 
cares -- by release on commercial TV. 
</P>
<P>
The Video Revolution has happened so fast that even those in the eye of the 
storm have had trouble predicting its course. 
</P>
<P>
Klingensmith, who has been involved in video from its inception in the late 
'70s, says the most optimistic video analyst didn't dream that video would be 
where it is today. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, someone asked me where I thought it was headed," Klingensmith 
recalls, "and I said that by 1985, there will be nine or 10 million VCR homes, 
and a film may do $10 million in sales. At Paramount, we've had 25 movies do 
better than that." 
</P>
<P>
The fact sheet on video, 1989: 
</P>
<P>
 -- There are 50 million households with VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The video industry now buys about $3 billion worth of videos from 
distributors each year and grosses an estimated $8 billion to $10 billion from 
rentals and retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The film industry makes more money from its sales of films on videocassette 
than it does from domestic box-office rentals (about $2 billion a year). 
</P>
<P>
 -- There are more video stores in America than theater screens (about 30,000 
to about 23,000), and when you include supermarkets, bookstores and other 
businesses dabbling in video rentals, there are more than 50,000 outlets. 
</P>
<P>
With most of those stores stocking more than 1,000 titles and carrying 
virtually every new major studio release, profitable sales are assured for all 
but the most stupendous flops. And even those find their way onto video shelves 
in some number (you'll note there is always a copy of "Ishtar" and "Leonard 
Part VI" available). 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say the surest trend ahead is the demise of the mom-and-pop 
video stores. Eventually, they predict, the video business -- sales and rentals 
-- will be dominated by five or six super chains, which themselves may become 
the targets of conglomerate entertainment takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the video market is having a major say in the kinds of movies 
the film industry turns out. It is true, as Art Murphy said, that the biggest 
hits in theaters become the biggest hits on video, but the ratio of their 
success, compared to less popular theatrical releases, is not as great. A hit 
movie that grosses $150 million at the box office will return about half that 
amount to the distributor in film rentals, and guarantee the distributor of a 
video sale that may net a third as much, or $25 million. Meanwhile, many films 
that gross less than $20 million in theaters ($10 million or less in film 
rentals) go on to earn much more in video. 
</P>
<P>
That is why certain adult-theme films that would have been persona non grata 
from the summer schedule a few years ago are now routinely included. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount, the studio with perhaps the best summer batting average of the last 
decade, released two films last summer -- "Presidio" and "Tucker" -- that made 
more money from video sales than from ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
"These films did not light up box office magic," Klingensmith concedes, "but 
they are going to be terrific for us on video. 'Tucker' got exceptional reviews 
and some Academy Award nominations and the want-to-see on it is tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
Klingensmith estimated that Paramount would sell more than a quarter of a 
million "Tucker" tapes. The film brought in film-rental receipts of about $12 
million, Klingensmith said, while the tape sale figured to bring in close to 
$15 million. He said "Presidio" will net about $13 million from video, compared 
to the $9 million it is estimated to have earned from rentals to theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"Blockbusters in theaters are never as big in video," Klingensmith said. 
"They're strong, and they're the leaders, but it is those 50 to 70 mid-range 
theatrical films that do exceptionally well in video." 
</P>
<P>
Even small films now have a chance of being a reasonably big hit on video. 
Movies like "Blue Velvet" and "The Last Temptation of Christ" with 
controversial themes that made them newsworthy far beyond their commercial 
successes are bound to be hot in video stores going one-on-one with the 
consumers who didn't have the time or the opportunity to see them in theaters. 
</P>
<P>
According to video-industry analysts, the video appetite for films is six times 
as great as that for first-run features. A person who sees one first-run 
feature a month is considered a frequent moviegoer. The average video consumer 
rents six movies a month. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an appetite for every family that owns a VCR," says one video 
distributor. "It's like the plant in 'Little Shop of Horrors,' saying, 'Feed 
me.' We're trying to make sure it's fed."

CONSUMER REPORT: RUNWAY DELAYS LEAVE PASSENGERS UP IN THE AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK ADLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Suppose your plane has left the gate and moved to the runway for takeoff. 
Buckled in, you wait for the plane to ascend. And wait. And wait. 
</P>
<P>
Takeoff delays are common, and with the increasing amount of air traffic and 
airport congestion, it may take longer and longer for the planes to get off the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
How long can an airline keep passengers on a plane while it's waiting to take 
off? What information, if any, must it provide to passengers during this 
process? How often must it update this information? Can a passenger who no 
longer wants to take the flight because of the delay get off the plane? 
</P>
<P>
There are no answers to questions such as these because airlines are not 
regulated by the Department of Transportation in this area. 
</P>
<P>
"The consumer doesn't have any rights in this situation," explained Con 
Hitchcock, a spokesman for the Aviation Consumer Action Project (ACAP) in 
Washington, D.C. "Legally, the airlines don't have an obligation to provide 
information abut delays or to take you back to the gate upon your request." 
</P>
<P>
Airlines are controlled by the Federal Aviation Administration when it comes to 
safety. No offloading is allowed on runways. Planes return either to the gate 
or to an isolated part of the airport when a problem arises. 
</P>
<P>
Some carriers, however, take it upon themselves to be more attentive than 
others in informing passengers about delays. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to be up front with passengers and tell them the reason for the delay 
and its expected duration, if we know it," said Vince Durocher, district 
director of marketing for Delta. "The pilot may be told 20 minutes, which then 
creeps into a longer delay. This happens a lot, but passengers will be updated 
as soon as the initial period is past." 
</P>
<P>
Serving drinks can be a problem while the aircraft is being held on the runway 
because the pilot wants to keep the plane ready for takeoff. "You can't have 
drink carts in the aisles," Durocher said. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, airlines have offered passengers vouchers for upgrades on their 
next flight. 
</P>
<P>
Although airlines are not regulated on runway delays, the DOT does look at the 
accuracy of the information given to passengers. 
</P>
<P>
"The airlines have an obligation, in a general sense, to provide accurate 
information," a DOT spokesman said. "It's quite possible to say there'll be a 
15-minute delay, which lasts much longer. That happens, but it can be a 
good-faith judgment." 
</P>
<P>
However, if it is established that an airline shows a pattern of deliberately 
underestimating the length of the delay in its announcements, the DOT would 
look into that charge. 
</P>
<P>
"Passengers should realize that pilots are often dependent on the information 
they receive from the control tower," said Dieter Stange, station manager for 
Lufthansa at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of their experience, pilots can generally make a very good estimate at 
how long a delay will be, especially from the number of planes in front of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Airlines are not eager to return to the gate, lose their position in the 
takeoff order and risk losing passengers who no longer want -- or have the time 
-- to wait. If the plane is still at the gate, however, passengers do have the 
right to leave. Getting your checked baggage off in time could be another 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
The strike by air controllers in 1981 had a substantial impact on delays. 
</P>
<P>
"After the strike, the FAA wanted airlines to absorb delays on land, rather 
than in the air," ACAP's Hitchcock said. 
</P>
<P>
Planes are now more likely to be delayed on the ground at the point of 
departure than in the air at the point of arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from weather, which can snarl an entire route, another factor that can 
create delays is the duty time of flight personnel. Time spent on a runway 
might force personnel to exceed the number of hours they are supposed to work. 
</P>
<P>
"Following the duty time rules is an FAA requirement," an FAA spokesman said. 
"If the delay on the runway eats into duty time, then a new crew would be 
required and the flight would be even more delayed." 
</P>
<P>
The same scenario is true for foreign airlines. "Our rule of thumb is that if 
the flight crew on the runway waits for takeoff for more than an hour and 15 
minutes, this can mean returning to the gate for a new crew," Stange said. "The 
German air authority has rules on how many hours a crew can work. If this 
situation came up, it would be explained to passengers." 
</P>
<P>
The issue of not being allowed to deplane after a plane has left the gate has 
been challenged. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, James Abourezk, a former U.S. senator from South Dakota, was on a 
New York Air flight to New York City that was delayed for more than three hours 
on the runway in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
Because the delay would cause him to miss a reception at the United Nations, 
Abourezk requested that he be returned to the gate and allowed to get off the 
plane. The request was turned down, and Abourezk flew to New York anyway, then 
took the first flight back to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
After being denied a refund of his fare, and only receiving a form letter 
apologizing for the inconvenience, Abourezk sued the airline for false 
imprisonment. Resolution of the $200,000 suit still is pending, Abourezk said. 
</P>
<P>
Most delays are caused by too many flights around peak periods, poor weather 
and maintenance problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Jets bound on long international flights might get a little more consideration 
because of the flight's duration and flight crew time limitations," Stange 
said. "The controllers want to get these planes into the air as soon as 
possible and they won't let a jet stay on the runway too long." 
</P>
<P>
All in all, there's not much you can do about delays except be prepared. Take 
along a good book.

NEW WAY TO GET CAMPING SPACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prospective campers at California state parks and visitors to Hearst Castle may 
now use an Automatic Teller Machine card to make reservations. (Contact your 
ATM provider to make sure that it is participating.) 
</P>
<P>
A deferred payment plan allows phone-in reservations without use of a credit 
card. This plan is used like credit card reservations through Visa or 
MasterCard, except that no credit card is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The person making the reservation phones the Mistix reservation number, (800) 
444-7252 in California, and asks for a deferred payment reservation. For more 
information on the deferred payment plan, call the Mistix customer service 
office at (619) 452-5956. 
</P>
<P>
All phone-in reservations for family campsites or Hearst Castle tours may be 
made as early as eight weeks in advance. Reservations also may be made as late 
as the day before the proposed date. But deferred-payment reservations must be 
made no later than 10 days before the reservation date.

FINANCING IS A BIG IF FOR JAIL PLAN ON GYPSUM SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If all was to go smoothly, without any hitches whatsoever, the first inmates 
would arrive at a new Orange County jail in Gypsum Canyon in 1995, at the 
latest. 
</P>
<P>
But everything is not going smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the county's plans to build a 6,700-bed jail complex in the canyon 
just east of Anaheim Hills were dealt what could become a serious setback. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) withdrew from 
consideration in the Senate Judiciary Committee a bill she had sponsored that 
would have allowed voters to decide on a proposed half-cent sales tax increase 
for the construction and operation of jail and court facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: Santa Ana officials, fearful that voters will approve a June, 1990, 
ballot initiative requiring that all future county jails be built in their 
city, want to attach an amendment to Bergeson's bill that would prohibit the 
money from being used to build any jail in Santa Ana within a mile of a school. 
That would eliminate many Santa Ana sites from consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson balked, she has said, because local officials were inappropriately 
confusing a jail-financing plan with a jail site-selection plan. Late Thursday, 
however, she offered to compromise if Santa Ana city officials would remove 
their proposed amendment. She promised that she would not pass the sales tax 
measure to the governor for his signature until the Board of Supervisors gives 
final approval to the Gypsum Canyon site sometime in September. As of Saturday, 
there was no formal response from the city, so the sales tax question remains 
stalled. 
</P>
<P>
But even if Bergeson's bill is revived, wins passage in both houses of the 
Legislature and is signed by the governor and ultimately is approved by a 
majority of the county's voters, the money generated by that a half-cent sales 
tax would not be enough to operate the proposed Gypsum Canyon jail for 1 year, 
much less pay for the land it would be built upon and finance its construction. 
</P>
<P>
The sales tax would generate no more than $100 million annually, with jail 
construction projects vying with court construction projects for a piece of the 
pie. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the current estimate is that it will cost at least $700 million to 
buy the Gypsum Canyon site from the Irvine Co. and to build the jail. It would 
cost another estimated $75 million to $100 million annually to operate it, 
county officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Where would that kind of money come from in a county that last year considered 
massive layoffs to balance its budget? 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we don't have very many ways to get it if we don't get it from some 
source outside our routine budget," Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. 
Riley said. As far as he knows, Riley said, the county has no concrete plan for 
financing the jail in Gypsum Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans Have Died 
</P>
<P>
Plans that have been offered in the past, all of which would have required 
voter approval, have died on the vine. 
</P>
<P>
The latest was killed in August by the Board of Supervisors. Under that 
proposal, voters would have been asked to approve a $700-million bond financing 
plan to pay for the first phase of the Gypsum Canyon Jail and for a new 
$250-million courthouse in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, supervisors and other officials said they did not believe Orange 
County's conservative voters would be receptive to a measure that would add an 
estimated $70 in property taxes for every $100,000 in assessed value. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also have discussed creation of a community services district, in 
which properties are assessed a special tax for specific public improvements. 
Creation of such a district would require that voters approve it with a 
two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
If such financing plans eventually were put to voters and approved, the $100 
million generated by a half-cent sales tax might be adequate to pay the annual 
charges to service the debt, county officials said. Even so, money for 
day-to-day operation of the jail still would have to come from somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Residential Development 
</P>
<P>
Now, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the Gypsum Canyon jail project -- 
and in part because of it -- is the Irvine Co.'s announcement that it is 
beginning preliminary planning for residential development of its landholdings 
in the area, which include the proposed jail site. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of homes on or near the jail site would make the county's purchase 
of the land through condemnation proceedings more difficult -- and more 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
"We had put any plans for development on hold," said Dawn McCormick, a 
spokeswoman for the Irvine Co. "But since there has been no movement by the 
county, and there are plans for other development in the area, it's become 
necessary to begin initial master planning . . . in cooperation with the city 
of Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
The Hon Development Co., in conjunction with Anaheim, is planning to annex land 
in the adjacent Coal Canyon area, and that move would require the annexation of 
a small piece of the Irvine Co. land as well, McCormick said. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of that, it seemed appropriate . . . that we work with . . . Anaheim 
to begin development of a master plan for the area," she said. "Since the 
county movement has stalled, it's in our interests to look at that property for 
development." 
</P>
<P>
Still, McCormick said, the company is several years away from actually building 
houses on the land. 
</P>
<P>
Murry Cable, an assistant county administrative officer, said he did not know 
what impact, if any, the Irvine Co.'s announcement would have on plans for a 
new jail in Gypsum Canyon. He noted, however, that both the county and the 
company formally opposed the proposed Coal Canyon annexation plan at a meeting 
last month of the Local Agency Formation Commission, a county agency that 
oversees cityhood and annexation proposals. The matter was continued for 90 
days, Cable said. 
</P>
<P>
Some county officials in private conversations have talked of paring down the 
Gypsum Canyon project considerably and financing construction from the county 
general fund. Such an alternative, however, would require huge -- and perhaps 
untenable -- cuts in county services. 
</P>
<P>
So where does that leave the Gypsum Canyon project, which could become part of 
a legal tangle if voters approve the 1990 initiative to build jails only in 
Santa Ana? 
</P>
<P>
Still alive, insisted Supervisor Riley. 
</P>
<P>
The county is in the process of completing a state-required environmental 
impact report on the Gypsum Canyon site, which was chosen from among several 
remote canyon areas by a sharply divided Board of Supervisors in July, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental report, Riley said, is due to be finished in early September, 
and the Gypsum Canyon site is expected to get final approval from a majority of 
the five supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Riley said, he also hopes that Bergeson's bill will have been revived, 
passed and ready for the governor's signature. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, the county can seriously pursue its plans to build a jail in 
Gypsum Canyon, Riley said.

VOLUNTEERS MAKE SURE THAT FOSTER CHILDREN ARE WELL TAKEN CARE OF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fred and Linda Port have spent some of the most rewarding moments of their 
lives at flea markets, air shows and neighborhood ballparks, providing a 
6-year-old neglected boy with the kind of love and affection he has never known 
before. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten days ago, we spent the day together," Port said of the child who is in 
foster care. "And after knowing him for a year, it was the first time he felt 
comfortable enough that he ran and jumped into my arms and hugged me." 
</P>
<P>
That kind of demonstrative love is what proves most rewarding to the Ports, of 
Laguna Beach, and more than 100 other specially trained volunteers 
participating in the Court Appointed Special Advocate program, one of 17 in the 
state and 366 nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
By providing volunteers who act as special friends and advocates of children 
from group or foster homes, the programs have revolutionized a portion of the 
judicial system by allowing private citizens to participate in previously 
closed juvenile courts. 
</P>
<P>
In a system in which social workers carry oppressively heavy caseloads, the 
child advocates have come to be relied on to provide the kind of loving, 
one-to-one contact that caseworkers often cannot. 
</P>
<P>
"These are kids who have no one outside of the system who cares about them and 
are often moved constantly from foster home to group home to emergency 
shelter," said Susan Leibel, director of the Orange County CASA program. "We 
provide some stability for them, a continuing presence they can count on." 
</P>
<P>
Experts in the social service field say there is a growing concern among 
private citizens and professionals that many children in the child welfare 
system are not receiving the care they need. 
</P>
<P>
"They feel that children are not being adequately represented, that some 
circumstances are not being brought before the court and that judges are not 
given enough options," said Beth Waid, director of the national CASA program, 
based in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary studies from around the country indicate that the CASA programs 
have been effective in providing better representation for children. 
</P>
<P>
In Florida, where counties are required by law to have CASA programs, there has 
been a savings of nearly $300,000 a year in foster care costs because the 
burden on caseworkers has been lessened, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
California recently passed legislation establishing a state-assisted CASA 
program in which counties that join will be eligible for matching state funds. 
However, money for the program has yet to be appropriated. 
</P>
<P>
The state program is also developing guidelines for local CASA organizations 
that will achieve minimal standards for recruitment, training and supervision 
of volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"A program like this is critically necessary because there is no money in the 
state for new welfare programs," said J. Michael Hughes, an attorney who help 
found the Orange County CASA program. "Hopefully, through the overall process, 
the consciousness of the community is raised." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Began 4 Years Ago 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County program was begun 4 years ago as a project of an Orange 
County community service group and family law attorney Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
Now an independent, nonprofit organization with offices supplied by the county, 
the program has trained more than 190 volunteers who come from all walks of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers go through a 20-hour course in which they learn about courtroom 
procedures from judges, lawyers and other court personnel, and attend seminars 
on topics ranging from sexual abuse of children to early childhood development 
and adolescent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
After the training, they are sworn in by a juvenile court judge as officers of 
the court and take an oath of confidentiality to gain access to juvenile court 
files. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare court reports, CASA volunteers talk to the child, parents, other 
relatives, social workers, school officials, doctors and anyone else 
knowledgeable about the child's history to determine if it would be better for 
the child to remain with parents or guardians, be placed in foster care, or be 
freed for permanent adoption. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sometimes hard because while the court and caseworkers are obligated by 
law to work to reunite children with their families, the volunteers don't 
always see that family as worthy of getting the child back," CASA's Leibel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Likened to a Jurors 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the CASA programs liken the concept to lay people on a jury and 
argue that they can apply common sense and community standards to sometimes 
wrenchingly impersonal judicial proceedings that determine the fates of 
families. 
</P>
<P>
"That is one key," said Hughes, who is also a CASA board member. "The juvenile 
court process had always been closed; there was no way for the public to see or 
learn about what happens to children or about problems in the system. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been subtle changes as a result of CASA. You now have an 
independent group giving input to the court and often being critical of the 
social services agency on cases." 
</P>
<P>
C. Robert Jamieson, presiding judge of the Orange County Juvenile Court, said 
the CASA program has proved a "tremendous help." 
</P>
<P>
"They are probably the one common denominator in the system who can talk to all 
the parties involved," Jamieson said. "I view their reports very favorably 
because most other people who provide input have a bias." 
</P>
<P>
The unique role of CASA volunteers has provoked some opposition to their 
presence. As lay people who act independently of social workers and attorneys, 
they are often called upon to make recommendations that conflict with the 
advice of professionals. 
</P>
<P>
"Some support us and want to work with us, others do not," Leibel said. "There 
is definitely room for more growth if we got more cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
But social service officials say that as social workers, in particular, have 
learned more about what the child advocates can contribute, their services have 
become more accepted. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a function that has not been in existence very long, and some social 
workers are not sure what they (volunteers) are going to mean and how they will 
affect a case," said Gene Howard, director of the county Children's Services 
Department. "But I have seen tremendous progress in the area, and I'm finding 
very little resistance now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Willing to Listen 
</P>
<P>
Lila Blackstone, a social worker for 21 years, said any apprehension she had 
about the role of the volunteers was dispelled after she began working with 
one. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt here was another human being who knows this case who can help in the 
decision-making process," Blackstone said. "It is a very positive thing. . . . 
And if somebody else has input, I am willing to listen." 
</P>
<P>
Although social workers are supposed to represent a child's best interests in 
court, most are swamped. Blackstone recently has had to work with caseloads of 
60 to 70 children at a time, which is typical of other social workers in the 
county, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Working with one or two children at the most, CASA volunteers can thoroughly 
examine a case and provide emotional and practical support. 
</P>
<P>
"I have had volunteers take kids to the hospital and to medical appointments 
when a social worker couldn't go," Blackstone said. "In one case, they were 
able to assign a CASA volunteer who was medically knowledgeable and was able to 
ask questions of the doctor and read blood tests and so on. You see a 
substantial difference in the children when they have somebody there for them." 
</P>
<P>
Maureen Buck, a CASA volunteer for 6 months, has not yet had to make any 
weighty decisions about the 10-year-old boy she has come to know and love. But 
that time may come. 
</P>
<P>
"That is one thing they warned us about constantly in training: that we may 
have to make a decision that we don't want to make because we get emotionally 
involved with the child. So I am constantly questioning my (motives) when I 
speak out." 
</P>
<P>
The boy, who has been in foster care since he was 18 months old and now lives 
in a Costa Mesa group home, has some severe medical problems, said Buck, an 
administrative assistant with grown children of her own. 
</P>
<P>
"My role is to make sure he is getting proper medical checks and that he is 
monitored at all times," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's important that he has some idea of family life. He needs to know that 
he is special and that he has a future."

Bye-Bye Birdies -- Theories abounded among local birders earlier this season to 
explain the exceptionally low numbers of migrating birds passing through the 
county. Had the escalating destruction of wintering grounds in the tropics 
taken a sudden and devastating toll? 
</P>
<P>
But a late rush of migrating land birds started early this month and reached a 
big peak a couple of weeks ago. On one day in Huntington Central Park, for 
instance, the avian display included a count of 125 yellow warblers and 100 to 
150 Swainson's thrushes. "It was really impressive," said Doug Willick, who 
keeps track of rare local sightings for American Bird magazine. "That was 
encouraging after a very disappointing April." 
</P>
<P>
Along with the usual Pacific Flyway travelers have come a number of vagrants 
that strayed from other migratory paths. A number of rare fall vagrants that 
are very rare as spring vagrants in the county have been spotted in recent 
weeks. Some highlights: 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee warbler (three different individuals), May 17, 20 and 24. 
</P>
<P>
* Indigo bunting (two individuals), May 4 to 6 and 18. 
</P>
<P>
* Northern waterthrush, May 3. 
</P>
<P>
* Black and white warbler, May 29. 
</P>
<P>
* Gray flycatcher, April 15. 
</P>
<P>
* Summer tanager, May 20. 
</P>
<P>
* Franklin's gull, May 14. 
</P>
<P>
On May 20, a spotted redshank was seen just south of Orange County on Camp 
Pendleton. The Asiatic shore bird, a rare vagrant in the United States outside 
of the Aleutian Islands, has never been seen before in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Making several appearances in recent weeks on the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh 
Reserve in Irvine has been an American bittern, a member of the heron family. 
"They didn't use to be rare, but numbers in Southern California have really 
dwindled," Willick said. At one time, the birds bred in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
While the passage of spring migrants through the county is now waning, the 
number of rare and unusual vagrants should pick up for the next several weeks. 
These birds are probably straggling, Willick said, because they are lost far 
from their usual migratory paths. The vagrants provide an added challenge to 
avid birders and can make for additions to life lists (a birder's list of birds 
seen). 
</P>
<P>
Quail Hill Update -- The city of Irvine has already announced plans to preserve 
Quail Hill, the spot where thousands of migrating Canada geese spend the winter 
each year. Now it's time to decide what will happen to the land behind Quail 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
On both the city and county plans it is part of William R. Mason Regional Park. 
It has not been developed, however, and is now open space and strawberry 
fields. The land is leased from the Irvine Co., and if the county wants to keep 
that arrangement it has to show improvements on the property by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The county pitched a plan to build a golf course and hotel on the property but 
met a less-than-enthusiastic response from the City Council. Some Irvine 
officials, meanwhile, would like to restore the area to something approaching a 
natural state, with native plants and trees and winding trails. 
</P>
<P>
Plans to that effect are being drawn up by a city administrative aide. 
</P>
<P>
New Checklist -- UC Irvine's Museum of Systematic Biology has published a new 
"Checklist of the Vascular Plants of Orange County, California," the first time 
the list has been updated since 1968. Fred Roberts of the museum compiled the 
work, which will serve as the framework for the first-ever complete flora for 
the county, due to be published sometime after 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The checklist includes all native, introduced, naturalized or escaped species 
of vascular plants that have become established or persist as part of the 
county's flora. As presently known, the flora of Orange County includes 1,157 
species of vascular plants with an additional 99 subspecies or variations, for 
a total of 1,256 taxa. Of the total, 806 are native to the county. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of the checklist are available at several locations, including the 
Museum of Natural History and Science in Newport Beach.

LOOSE BOLTS AT THE SAN ONOFRE REACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine, if you will, amid the spate of summer movie sequels, ("Ghostbusters" 
II, "Indiana Jones" III, "Rambo" XXV), a new and timely movie, Three Mile 
Island II, the San Onofre Connection. Doesn't it seem odd that we have a 
nuclear reactor capable of untold destruction being fired up with known 
defects? 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that Edison officials in charge of the plant deem any accident 
relating to the loose bolts holding an important thermal shield "highly 
unlikely." Three out of 30 bolts partly unscrewed reads like 10% in my book, a 
significant amount, especially when coupled with the fact that there are more 
which are known to be in a degenerative condition. Now add to this the fact 
that they are not going to even start to remedy this for 1 full year. 
</P>
<P>
According to The Times article (May 16), Gene Morgan, station manager at San 
Onofre, compared this to the loss of a single screw in the hinge of a door that 
continues to work properly for a year. I have two points to nit-pick: There is 
substantially more at stake here than a few flies in Ma's apple pie, and work 
will not even start for 1 year, at which time several more screws may have 
fallen, not only from the aforementioned hinge but also from Morgan's noggin. 
</P>
<P>
We're not playing with Lincoln Logs anymore, folks. This reads like something 
that could sell a lot of movie rights. I wonder if Stephen King needs a new 
plot for one of his books?

AFTER THE DEATH OF DEBBIE KILLELEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the sentencing of Danny Ornelas for the death of my beautiful wife, Debbie 
Killelea, it is time for my friends and my family to end a very tragic chapter 
in our lives. 
</P>
<P>
Each day is a struggle for my children and myself without Deb, but as time 
passes and with the spiritual and emotional help of our friends and faith, we 
will manage to survive this very painful period. It is difficult for me to 
believe that the pain caused by the loss of Deb will ever die, but I pray that 
one day the sorrow will be replaced by our fond memories of a loving and giving 
wife and mother. 
</P>
<P>
My faith allows me to believe that Deb had served her time on earth and is now 
in a better place. One day, Michael, Hillary, Joseph and myself will be 
reunited with her to again enjoy her warm smile, her positive view of life and 
her special sense of humor. These convictions truly give me and my family the 
strength to continue. 
</P>
<P>
With the end of a chapter we can look forward to the next, and I wish to begin 
by thanking my church, family, and friends and all those unknown people who 
have prayed and helped my children and myself. At this time I encourage 
everyone affected by this tragedy to continue with their lives, as we must. Deb 
would want us all to move on and to forgive.

VICTORY FOR PUBLIC, ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Major developers, with their money and political clout, have the reputation in 
Orange County of being able to build virtually anything they want anywhere they 
want it. But that is not always true. 
</P>
<P>
In areas that are the most environmentally sensitive, like Upper Newport Bay 
and the Bolsa Chica Wetlands, the protective instincts of residents are 
aroused. And although success does not come quickly or easily, conservation and 
common sense have prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
The latest victory came Monday with the disclosure that, after nearly 20 years 
of conflict, a compromise had indeed been agreed upon between the property 
owner -- Signal Landmark Corp. -- city, county and state officials, and Amigos 
de Bolsa Chica, the local environmental group formed 15 years ago to protect 
the wetlands and the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
All parties involved in the agreement deserve praise, but the community owes 
Amigos de Bolsa Chica a grateful and special vote of thanks for its bulldog 
determination and dedication to protect and preserve the irreplaceable 
wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Some details must still be worked out, and the plan must be formally approved 
by several local, state and federal agencies. But the compromise has produced a 
scaled-down version that significantly reduces original development plans and 
will restore more than 1,100 acres of wetlands, making it one of the largest 
restored wetlands preserves in the state. 
</P>
<P>
It is a major victory for the community. And the environment. And for 
generations to come.

DEBATE OVER GAY PRIDE EVENT, IRVINE ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our freedom of speech, as is commonly observed, does not permit one to cry out 
"fire" in a crowded theater -- a justifiable case of the limitations 
surrounding an individual's freedom in relation with that of society's. And I 
propose that it is no different in the case of homosexuality being allowed to 
openly parade itself as a normal, alternative life style. 
</P>
<P>
What goes on between two consenting adults in public must take into account the 
freedoms of those who are constantly overlooked in the scheme of these 
particular individual's "rights." These are of the children. These 
impressionable saplings of the future have enough of a burden within the bounds 
of a normal, heterosexual society; the opposite sex is terrifying as it is 
without the added confusion of lustful notions among the same. 
</P>
<P>
I am not suggesting that the practice of homosexuality be outlawed, or that by 
any means it will one day disappear. However, I am suggesting that 
homosexuality be categorized for what it is -- a sexual perversion, and nothing 
more. For if they are granted the status of a people whose time of coming out 
from the closet has come, then what "alternative" life style will come out of 
the closet next? Bestiality? Necrophilia? The comparison may seem outrageous 
now to some, but who would have seriously considered 20 years ago that men who 
had sex with men would adamantly demand so many positions on the police force 
or so many teaching jobs in our schools? And, even more frightening, begin 
adopting recognition and social sympathy in the process. 
</P>
<P>
It is up to all concerned heterosexuals to voice their opposition to the 
dangerously momentous surge of homosexual visibility in our communities. It is 
only by keeping sexual perversities in the closet that our children have a 
chance at leading the kind of lives that we intend for them. There are enough 
negative influences bombarding our families today without worrying about little 
Jimmy "experimenting" with the neighbor's boy because he saw two men kissing in 
the park. In order for us to grow as a country, both morally or otherwise, we 
must keep these "alternative" life styles out of the mainstream of society, to 
be discovered if they must by mature and responsible adults, for only then can 
they truly be consenting.

DEBATE OVER GAY PRIDE EVENT, IRVINE ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last summer, at the request of the homosexual community and against the wishes 
of hundreds of Irvine residents, who packed the Irvine City Council chambers, 
the Irvine City Council adopted a "human rights" ordinance that would include 
protection for one's "sexual orientation." 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, defines "sexual orientation" as "heterosexuality, homosexuality, 
or bisexuality." 
</P>
<P>
I personally feel this ordinance currently condones the acts of 
heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality. It is not the role of 
government to condone any sexual practice. One's sexual activities should be 
kept private and not be made a political football for any reason. 
</P>
<P>
Discussions surrounding this ordinance have missed the point. The Irvine City 
Council and homosexual community tell us that if the term sexual orientation is 
deleted from the ordinance, then it will be legal to discriminate against 
homosexuals. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council and homosexual community state that the deletion of the term 
"sexual orientation" would prevent homosexuals from living and working in 
Irvine and would legalize discrimination against homosexuals. By the city's own 
definition, this argument is absurd. To use its logic, the deletion of the 
words "sexual orientation" would also legalize discrimination against 
heterosexuals and prevent heterosexuals from living or working in Irvine as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the argument of the City Council and the homosexual community is 
filled with error. So their recourse has been to resort to scare tactics, name 
calling, and distortions in an effort to hide the truth.

HOW JURY DUTY ALTERS VIEW OF LEGAL SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Allow me to suggest a powerful deterrent to would-be violators of the law in 
Orange County. Let them spend one day -- just one -- in the Jury Assembly Room 
and/or the jury box of the Superior Court of the County of Orange. The problem, 
as I see it, lies not at the bench, nor with the attorneys, but with the 
hazardous lottery that is known as "a jury of our peers." 
</P>
<P>
I arrived at Superior Courthouse, naive as a college freshman, eager to perform 
my jury service in the most thoughtful, unbiased manner possible. Armed with 
civic pride and a MacArthurian sense of duty, I approached the Jury Assembly 
Room, eager to serve a month's jury duty with what I presumed would be 
perceptive citizens, also eager to hand up valid and measured decisions. Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, one encounters a room filled with many prospective jurors who have 
arrived, knowing that they, too, will perhaps spend interminable hours waiting 
to be called. Do they bring books or magazines? Correspondence or projects to 
be completed? Crossword puzzles, even? No. Instead, multiples of the citizenry 
assembled are content to sit for hours, staring witlessly into the middle 
distance. There is clearly nobody home. 
</P>
<P>
Then, if one is fortunate enough to be selected as a potential juror, it is 
still tough to make the final cut. Possession of an operable brain, all (well, 
most) of one's faculties, quickly renders a candidate suspect. With keen 
insight, I soon discerned that these qualities, along with basic honesty, were 
deemed unnecessary in some jury boxes. I was excused from a claims case because 
I had failed to file suit for damages in a personal injury case, even though I 
was the guilty party. So much for integrity. But, ladies and gentlemen of the 
populace, who was left on the powerful 12? One old man who was deaf in one ear, 
an elderly lady with nary a tooth in her head, a Vietnamese-American who 
neither spoke nor understood much English and a Mexican-American whose pants 
were held up by a rope. Judgment by a jury of my peers? I quail at the thought.

POLICE HOMELESS SWEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the May meeting of the Orange County Homeless Initiatives Task Force, two 
representatives of the homeless in Santa Ana told the members that, during a 
recent sweep, Santa Ana police officers seized the medicine of a homeless 
woman, suffering from epilepsy. One hour later the victim of this confiscation 
suffered an epileptic seizure. 
</P>
<P>
This allegation was heard by about 40 members of the task force, who represent 
city and volunteer organizations throughout Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
I think you will agree with us that this matter should be investigated by Santa 
Ana immediately, and the results of the investigation should be published. 
</P>
<P>
Besides blackening the name of Santa Ana before the whole of Orange County, the 
cruelty and possible illegality of such sweeps should be apparent to even the 
most hardhearted citizen of your city. We have been assured that these sweeps 
are in violation of a court order in an existing lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Surely Santa Ana does not consider this to be a reasonable answer to the 
national crisis of homelessness.

ON THE DEFENSIVE;

ORIOLES' GLOVES ARE ALMOST AS GOLDEN AS THEY WERE IN THE GOLDEN, GLORY YEARS

<TEXT>
<P>
Brian Holton knows about defense, the good and the bad. He pitches for the 
Baltimore Orioles, and he pitched for the 1987 Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
He was in the clubhouse two seasons ago when Dodgers Manager Tommy Lasorda was 
so fed up with his team's defense he called a team meeting. He asked third 
baseman Pedro Guerrero what were his thoughts before every pitch. Guerrero 
said, seriously, "I think, 'Please don't hit it to me. If it isn't hit to me, 
please don't hit it to (Steve) Sax.' " 
</P>
<P>
Holton smiled and said, "We don't have that problem here. This is best the 
defensive team I've ever been with." 
</P>
<P>
The question is, how good? 
</P>
<P>
The statistics say it is the best in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles' 19 errors are nine fewer than any major-league team. Defensively, 
the Orioles are off to the best start in club history. 
</P>
<P>
The six unearned runs allowed are five fewer than any other team. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles have played 30 errorless games out of 45, including 11 of the last 
13. 
</P>
<P>
They have not made more than two errors in any game. 
</P>
<P>
They are on a pace to make 70 errors, which would break the major-league record 
for the fewest errors in one season (84) set by the 1988 Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
How good is the defense? 
</P>
<P>
"Our outfield defense is the best I've ever seen as an Oriole," Manager Frank 
Robinson said. "You know those great defensive teams we had, the outfield was 
basically (center fielder Paul) Blair. We had (Don) Buford and (Merv) 
Rettenmund and myself, but the real outstanding one was Blair. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have four guys who can be good to outstanding outfielders with Brady 
(Anderson), (Mike) Devereaux, (Steve) Finley and (Phil) Bradley. And (Joe) 
Orsulak is good. They can all play out there." 
</P>
<P>
It would seem ludicrous, given the Orioles' rich tradition of defense, to ask 
if the defense this season has a chance to be the best in their history. After 
all, the Orioles finished first, second or third in the American League in 
defense 22 out of 25 years before 1985. They haven't had a Gold Glove winner 
since 1984 (Eddie Murray), but no American League team has won more (48). 
</P>
<P>
Best overall defense in club history? 
</P>
<P>
Robinson paused. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to make this difficult on me, aren't you?" he said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
He knows that the Orioles' infield has made two errors in 21 games this month, 
and one of those came on a questionable call by an official scorer on third 
baseman Craig Worthington. "With that left side of the infield -- Brooks 
(Robinson) and (Mark) Belanger -- nothing ever got through," Robinson said. "I 
would have to give those teams the edge. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's close." 
</P>
<P>
Not much has gotten through either side of the infield this year. Shortstop Cal 
Ripken hadn't made an error in 29 straight games before a miscue Saturday. 
Catcher Mickey Tettleton has the longest current errorless streak (81 games) 
among major-league catchers. 
</P>
<P>
Ripken, Tettleton and first baseman Jim Traber lead the league in fielding at 
their respective positions. Traber and Randy Milligan haven't made an error 
this year. Worthington and second baseman Bill Ripken have been both reliable 
and terrific. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Ripken said he thought this was the best defensive team he had played for 
since joining the Orioles in 1981. Pitcher Jeff Ballard says it's the best 
defensive team he has ever played with. 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder Anderson was asked the same question. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 11," he said, "we had a shortstop named Jimmy Fredericks. Boy, he 
could really pick it." 
</P>
<P>
Holton said, "Defense is the biggest reason for our pitching success." 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles' earned-run average is down to 3.72. It is impossible to gauge how 
many balls that were doubles in 1988 have been caught by Oriole outfielders 
this year, but you can bet it's quite a few. 
</P>
<P>
"With our defense, all you have to do is throw strikes," Holton said.

ANTEATERS' DOUBLES TEAM WINS TWICE, WILL PLAY FOR TITLE TODAY

<P>
UC Irvine's doubles team of Mike Briggs and Trevor Kronemann won two matches 
Saturday to advance to the finals of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
championships at the University of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
Briggs and Kronemann defeated Texas Christian's Clint Banducci and Eric Lingg, 
the third-seeded team in the tournament, 5-7, 7-5, 6-1, in the morning's 
quarterfinals. In the afternoon, they rallied from a 3-1 third-set deficit to 
beat Stanford's Alex O'Brien and Jeff Tarango, 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
In today's final, Briggs and Kronemann (22-7) will meet USC's Eric Amend and 
Byron Black, who defeated Irvine's team of Mark Kaplan and Richard Lubner, 3-6, 
6-0, 6-4, in Saturday's other semifinal match. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan and Lubner (26-10) defeated Clemson's Vince Van Gelderen and Todd 
Watkins, 6-3, 2-6, 6-4, in the quarterfinals Saturday before losing to the 
Trojan pair for the third time this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We used the same strategy against them each time," Amend said. "We started 
slowly and then played back and made them hit volleys. They didn't have 
anywhere to put it." 
</P>
<P>
A California school has won the doubles title five consecutive years with 
Trojan teams winning three in four years. Two years ago, USC's Rick Leach and 
Scott Melville defeated Irvine's Julian Barham and Darren Yates in the doubles 
final. 
</P>
<P>
"UC Irvine has never had a Division I national championship in tennis," Briggs 
said. "Hopefully, we'll be the first. It's like Coach (Greg Patton) says, 'You 
just put on the lamp shades and go to the party.' " 
</P>
<P>
Another person who could be celebrating today is Nebraska's Steven Jung, who 
four years ago was a lightly recruited junior player from Hacienda Heights in 
search of a tennis scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents were about to have four kids in college," Jung said. "Getting a 
scholarship was a necessity." 
</P>
<P>
When the West Coast schools ignored him, Jung picked Nebraska. Now, after what 
he terms "consistent improvement over four years," Jung is on the brink of the 
singles title. The unseeded Jung (34-4) will meet Louisiana State's Donni 
Leaycraft (30-7) today. 
</P>
<P>
Both Jung and Leaycraft defeated Georgia players in Saturday's semifinals, 
though in entirely different ways. Jung eliminated Stephen Enochs in 70 
minutes, 6-3, 6-2, but it took Leaycraft more than 2 1/2 hours to outlast 
Francisco Montana, 7-5, 4-6, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Leaycraft, seeded in a group of players from nine to 16, is the first LSU 
player to reach a singles final. Jung is the first Big Eight player to 
accomplish the feat. 
</P>
<P>
But Jung is no stranger to championship tennis. His older sister, Pam, was a 
two-time All-American at Pepperdine and currently plays on the pro tour. 
Another sister, Debbie, competed at Cal Poly Pomona. In 1985, the Jungs were 
named tennis family of the year by the United States Tennis Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad taught us all," said Jung, who graduated two weeks ago with a degree in 
finance. "He wanted a sport that would bind us together. He didn't think it 
would come to this." 
</P>
<P>
Jung, an unheralded junior, isn't bitter about having to go to the Midwest to 
find a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand why some of the California schools didn't recruit me," Jung said. 
"Nebraska took a risk with me. I appreciate it." 
</P>
<P>
Jung failed to win a set in two previous NCAA appearances, but he blossomed 
this season, winning a tournament in Milwaukee last January.

IRVINE'S AST HEALING AFTER PARTNER'S EXIT; 
</P>
<P>
IDEALISM, SUCCESS COLLIDED TO SPLIT '3 MUSKETEERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About a year ago, when AST Research's computer sales were sizzling and its 
stock was soaring, the company's three young founders decided to treat 
themselves. They all went out and bought fancy new cars. 
</P>
<P>
Albert C. Wong and Thomas C. K. Yuen drove up to work in identical black 
Ferrari Testarossas. Safi U. Qureshey, displaying more modest taste, showed up 
in a top-of-the-line BMW. 
</P>
<P>
Whether purchasing cars or plotting corporate strategy, AST's top executives 
followed a "Three Musketeers"-type philosophy after forming their company in 
1980. They named the company by using the initials of their first names and 
chose their original job titles by literally picking them out of a hat. They 
later shared the title of co-chairman, drew the same salaries and decorated 
their offices almost identically. They were not just business partners but also 
close friends. 
</P>
<P>
New employees at the Irvine firm soon learned that important company decisions 
weren't final until Albert, Safi and Tom -- as AST workers call them -- gave 
their collective stamp of approval. 
</P>
<P>
But somewhere along the line, something went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The first sign of trouble came in November when Wong, the company's technology 
chief, abruptly resigned. "The reason I left was the partners," Wong said in a 
recent interview. "We just didn't get along." 
</P>
<P>
In 8 years, AST's founders had gone from being three enthusiastic entrepreneurs 
working 16-hour days in an 800-square-foot office in Irvine to millionaire 
executives trying to run the daily operations of a big, fast-growing 
enterprise. AST is now one of the nation's leading manufacturers of 
IBM-compatible personal computers and it is expected to surpass $500 million in 
sales in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But the AST story is also a case study of the strains that young entrepreneurs 
endure when a company grows, prospers and then stumbles along the way to 
becoming a major corporation. It also shows how idealistic visions, such as the 
AST founders' egalitarian approach to management, sometimes don't work in 
</P>
<P>
the business world. 
</P>
<P>
"When you start a company, you are really doing it for yourselves," AST's 
Qureshey said. "We have learned that we have to take a much more objective, 
businesslike approach. It doesn't mean that our values are less important. But 
we know we cannot treat the company as our personal property." 
</P>
<P>
AST's founders said one thing that bound them together was their similar 
backgrounds. All came to the United States to study engineering. Yuen and Wong 
came from Hong Kong to Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, where they were 
roommates. Qureshey, a Pakistani, studied engineering in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refinanced Homes 
</P>
<P>
Qureshey and Yuen met at Computer Automation, an Irvine computer maker. In 
1980, the three decided to strike out on their own, using $50,000 they raised 
by refinancing their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"We all wanted to move up faster and sooner," said Yuen, AST's chief operating 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
After selecting the company's name over a meal at a Carl's Jr. restaurant, the 
founders started a computer consulting firm specializing in the mid-range 
computer business. 
</P>
<P>
But in August, 1981, International Business Machines introduced its first 
personal computer, prompting AST to enter a new field. By December, AST was out 
with its first product, a printed circuit board that made it easier and cheaper 
to boost the memory of IBM's PC. 
</P>
<P>
"We sold our first board to a customer in Orange County," Qureshey recalled. 
"They sent us a check for $82, and the check bounced. It was not a good 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revenue Soared 
</P>
<P>
By 1986, AST had become the leading producer of add-on products designed to 
increase the memory and capabilities of PCs. The add-on business began to slow 
about that time, though, because newer PCs didn't require as much extra 
equipment. So AST decided to build its own personal computers. Its first model, 
the Premium/286, was a big success. Revenue soared to $412 million for the year 
ended June 30, 1988, doubling the year-earlier revenue of $206 million. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, AST's founders shared in managing the company and divided up 
their responsibilities according to respective skills and interests. Yuen 
focused on marketing and sales. Wong oversaw engineering and manufacturing. And 
Qureshey divided his time among several areas. 
</P>
<P>
The founders referred to each other as "partner" and never by their titles. 
They made decisions as a group, discussing issues until they reached a 
consensus. They took no votes on issues to avoid having any one of them come 
out on the short end of a 2-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
But as AST continued to grow, the unusual power-sharing arrangement began to 
show signs of strain. Those differences became more critical when AST's 
earnings slipped in mid-1988, despite soaring sales. 
</P>
<P>
Wong eventually departed, and 2 months later, AST had a stunning financial 
setback. The company in late January reported its largest quarterly loss ever, 
a whopping $8.9-million deficit. The second-quarter loss resulted in AST 
cutting 6% of its worldwide work force, or 120 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Falling-Out Denied 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Wong's departure appeared to be just another story of a 
computer-whiz-turned-millionaire quitting to enjoy the good life. At the time 
of his departure, the founders, including Wong himself, denied that there had 
been a falling-out. But Wong, who remains an AST director and major 
shareholder, recently has been more forthcoming about why he left. 
</P>
<P>
According to Wong's account, the tensions that led to his eventual departure 
had been building for about 2 years. Increasingly, Wong was finding himself in 
disagreement with Qureshey and Yuen on key decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"When a company is doing fantastic, then a lot of problems can be shoved under 
the table," said Wong, who after leaving AST formed a small real estate 
company, DMK Development Corp., in Laguna Hills. But when AST began to stumble, 
tensions arose. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute that led to Wong's departure centered on a new PC the company 
planned to introduce. According to Wong, Yuen wanted to ship the new machine to 
customers before Wong, who headed up engineering, felt that the product was 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
Several AST vice presidents tried unsuccessfully to mediate the dispute between 
Yuen and Wong. But, Wong said, "I didn't want to compromise." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Longer Working 
</P>
<P>
The underlying problem, the founders agree, was that their unusual arrangement 
of sharing the decision-making authority as co-chairmen was no longer working. 
</P>
<P>
"It got all of us frustrated," said Wong, who still owns a 16% stake in AST 
worth about $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
Qureshey and Yuen also acknowledge the problems with the founders' 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
The founders "had a lot of respect for each other's opinions," Yuen said. "But 
when the opinions diverged, the easiest way was to not argue and just back 
away. We didn't want to create a personal confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Yuen added, decisions were sometimes delayed or not made at all 
and "the company became lethargic." 
</P>
<P>
The two remaining founders are careful to avoid direct criticism of Wong, but 
they said the company has run more smoothly since his departure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More Common Values' 
</P>
<P>
"Safi and I have more common values and vision," Yuen said. "And that has made 
it much easier for us to work together." 
</P>
<P>
Since Wong's departure, Qureshey and Yuen said they have also attempted to 
delegate more decision-making authority to an eight-member executive committee 
made up of themselves and other top managers. 
</P>
<P>
"We know where we're going now and it's very different now from 6 months ago," 
Qureshey said. 
</P>
<P>
In public comments after his departure that particularly irked Qureshey and 
Yuen, Wong has suggested that the day-to-day operations might be better handled 
by a professional manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel Safi and Tom can bring the company around" from its recent financial 
troubles, Wong said. "But I hope eventually they will bring on board some 
capable people to run the business. The founder can't be worrying about whether 
this screw is the right one to put in the computer, and we were doing that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Idea Scoffed At 
</P>
<P>
But Yuen and Qureshey scoff at that idea. They say they have no plans to bring 
in a new chief executive or chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
"It is sometimes a disturbing feeling to have your partner feel you don't have 
management experience," Yuen said. "Does it make any difference that we don't 
have Harvard MBAs? I don't think so. We have a lot of hard-earned experience." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some Wall Street analysts say they are encouraged by the direction 
AST has taken during the past 6 months. Although the company posted a net loss 
of $1.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, it had a small operating profit 
of $423,000, on sales of $113.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts reacted positively to that news because the loss was smaller than 
anticipated and a substantial improvement over the previous quarter's loss of 
$8.9 million. Several have predicted that the company should make a net profit 
in the fourth quarter ending June 30. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more encouraged than I was 6 months ago," said Jay Vleeschouwer, an 
analyst at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in New York. "They have done a number of 
things to improve their balance sheet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Tragedy 
</P>
<P>
In the past 2 months, Yuen has been called on more than ever to lead the 
company. Qureshey has spent a lot of time away from his office because of a 
family tragedy involving his young daughter, who was critically injured in a 
swimming pool accident. The daughter is recovering at an Orange County medical 
clinic. 
</P>
<P>
The three founders and longtime friends say the parting was difficult. But they 
add that they have managed to keep their friendship, despite their differences. 
</P>
<P>
Wong said he wishes AST well and believes the company will "prove itself" in 
the long run. But he said he avoids driving his Ferrari past AST's current 
offices or its new headquarters under construction in Irvine. He said the idea 
that he is no longer part of the company is still too painful.
