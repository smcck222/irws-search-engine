A luxury liner with 1,360 people aboard lost power and ran aground on a sand 
bar 22 miles north of Cape May in the Delaware Bay separating Delaware and New 
Jersey.

Nobody was in danger, the Coast Guard reported, and passengers on the 642-foot 
Regent Star said they were enjoying free cocktails. A small electrical fire in 
a switchboard apparently caused the power failure on what was to be the last 
day of a seven-day trip from Montego Bay, Jamaica, to Philadelphia. The Coast 
Guard said initial attempts to free the ship with tugboats failed, and another 
attempt would have to wait until high tide around midnight.

Labor experts estimate that 5,000 to 10,000 children are illegally employed in 
New York's garment industry every day, the Daily News reported. 
</P>
<P>
In the first three months of this year, the state Labor Department's Apparel 
Industry Task Force found 90 garment district factories illegally employing 128 
minors. It was the largest number of violators nabbed in any three-month period 
by the task force. But task force officials said tracking down violators is an 
arduous job. There are 3,500 registered garment manufacturers in the city and 
an equal number that are unregistered. The task force has 24 investigators.

The three-judge panel upheld his 18-year prison term. Vanunu, 35, a former

solitary confinement for almost four years since Israel spirited him back from 
London to face trial. His 1986 disclosures to the London Sunday Times

Soil saturated with flammable and toxic chemicals caught fire around an 
abandoned chemical plant, prompting firefighters to evacuate residents of a 
sparsely populated desert area. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters said the blaze started with a grass fire that swept toward the 
abandoned chemical plant, which contained barrels of cyanide, flammable 
chemicals, mercury and oxidizers. "We didn't have the barrels on fire, but the 
chemicals in the dirt were burning, if you can picture that," said Kern County 
Fire Capt. Kenneth Frasca. He said there were several chemicals in the soil 
around the plant, which has been under a cleanup order by several agencies, 
including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, for the last year. 
Authorities estimated that residents of about 75 to 100 scattered houses, 
mobile homes, apartments and a motel in the desert area 65 miles north of Los 
Angeles were evacuated.

Crews worked to unload fuel tanks on a 90-foot fishing boat seized in a drug 
raid off the coast in the Bay Area so the boat could be searched for hidden 
compartments, the Coast Guard said. No contraband was immediately found on the 
boat, which was seized off Half Moon Bay and towed to San Francisco after San 
Mateo County sheriff's deputies spotted a suspected drug-smuggling operation 
along the coast, the Coast Guard said.

Twelve men -- seven on shore and five aboard the vessel -- were arrested, and 
federal and state officials combed a 20-mile stretch of coastline for drugs 
they suspect were dumped from the trawler. Five pounds of marijuana was seized 
on shore near Pescadero, about 30 miles south of San Francisco, deputies said. 
The arrests and seizure came after deputies spotted several people on 
California 1 throwing something from a bridge, authorities said.

Question: I find it to be very helpful when you write about risk factors for 
different diseases, such as diabetes. Have you ever done this for young people 
who may be suicidal? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Possible risk factors for suicide among the young include loss of a 
parent; family disruption, such as separation or divorce; emotional stress; a 
history of abuse, neglect, or both; having a family member or friend who 
committed suicide; previous suicide attempts; a history of alcohol or drug 
abuse or a family member with a history of drug dependency; and access to 
firearms.

PROPOSITION 118;

<P>
MAKE REDISTRICTING FAIR TO ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD MARTINEZ and ANTONIO GONZALEZ, Richard Martinez is executive 
director of Southwest Voter Registration Project. Antonio Gonzalez is regional 
field organizer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proposition 118 would give a minority (one-third) of the state Legislature the 
power to veto any reapportionment plan proposed by the majority. This would 
increase racial gerrymandering and back-room deal-cutting by incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 119 would remove the redistricting process from the hands of 
popularly elected legislators and put it into the hands of an appointed 
commission. Cynical at best, this would take the redistricting process one more 
step from the voters. Putting such matters into a commission only hides power 
struggles and increases the influence of special interests. 
</P>
<P>
Few Latino leaders argue that past redistricting efforts were fair to our 
community. As Democratic and Republican incumbents battled for power, Latino 
communities were gerrymandered. The result is that while Latinos comprise 26% 
of California's population, they hold only 5% (6 of 120) of the legislative 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
It is time to introduce a new ethic into the process. The Voting Rights Act and 
subsequent precedents hold that criteria of one person/one vote, respect for 
the integrity of communities of interest (blacks, Latinos, etc.), and 
prohibition of racial gerrymandering are preferred guidelines for 
redistricting. New laws should enforce these standards for redistricting at the 
state and local levels (Latinos are also shut out by nonpartisan county 
supervisor elections in California, holding only 8 of 290 seats, or 3%). 
</P>
<P>
The Latino contribution may well be to reintroduce the great values of American 
democratic thought into California political debate. Good governance ought to 
facilitate political participation and representation for all -- poor and 
working class as well as wealthy, ethnic minorities as well as Anglo majority, 
non-citizen as well as citizen, female as well as male. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 118 won't do it. Neither will its competitor, Proposition 119.

IT'S CASTING A NET OVER JURIES; 
</P>
<P>
NO: WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO INTERVIEW THE PEOPLE WHO WILL DECIDE YOUR CASE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARVIN E. KRAKOW, Marvin E. Krakow is a trial lawyer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A provision of Proposition 115 would mandate that the court -- rather than the 
attorneys for the parties -- interview prospective jurors. The politicians and 
prosecutors who back this proposition want us to think that choosing a jury 
only has to do with criminals. They don't want us to think that juries are 
meant to protect us from government error, or worse. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 115 comes from prosecutors. They want to change the rules to make 
it easier for them to win. It's easy for politicians and prosecutors to play on 
our fears. Crime is real and horrible. We want the robbers and the killers 
caught and punished. We want to feel safe on our streets and in our homes. 
</P>
<P>
Most prosecutors are decent, dedicated and caring. We should never forget, 
though, that the worst crimes come from the state: government unchecked and out 
of control. 
</P>
<P>
The worst crimes do not come from the street criminals. We do not have to look 
to Eastern Europe, Iraq, South Africa or Tian An Men Square to see the horror 
of unchecked government power. In our own country, the government, not street 
criminals, brought us slavery and then segregation. The government, not street 
criminals, put American citizens of Japanese ancestry in concentration camps. 
The government, not street criminals, deports Central American refugees to die 
at the hands of guerrillas and government-sponsored death squads. The American 
Revolution was a rebellion against government tyranny: white Anglo-Saxon 
Protestants against a distant power; "strange" religious sects such as Quakers, 
Congregationalists and Methodists against a state religion. Today, it is not 
only Catholics, Baptists and Jews who need to fear when prejudice is married to 
government. When the government goes after "them," it might be going after us. 
</P>
<P>
The English developed juries to protect commoners from prosecutions by the 
church and the agents of the king. Juries, to this day, protect the little guy. 
They are part of a justice system that looks to everyday citizens to protect 
one another, because however good our government, we cannot trust it to protect 
us from its own excesses. The jury system is not designed to protect the 
criminals. It is meant to protect the innocent from the government and the 
prosecutors who make a mistake, or worse, become evil and corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
Jury selection -- lawyers call it voir dire -- is critical to preserving our 
right to an unbiased jury. A juror must bring his or her common sense and 
experience to difficult and important decisions. At the same time, the juror 
must be able to put aside the biases and prejudices that we carry with us. 
Jurors decide who goes to jail; who helps the victims of disabling injuries, 
and how; who cheated on taxes and who is the victim of the heavy hand of the 
Internal Revenue Service. Some jurors must decide who will live and who will 
die. It is only natural that before we give someone such an important job, we 
ask him or her some questions. 
</P>
<P>
If you needed someone for an important job, wouldn't you want to interview the 
person yourself? Would you want someone who didn't have to live with the 
decision ask the questions? What if your ability to support your family 
depended on who you hired? What if your freedom depended on it? What if you 
were mistakenly accused of murder? 
</P>
<P>
The jury selection question is simple. Prosecutors want you to vote for 
Proposition 115, because they don't want you (or your lawyer) to interview the 
men and women who may sit on your jury. The only way they will win is to fool 
you. They have to make you think you are voting about someone else's jury, some 
criminal's jury. That "someone else" might be your friend, your neighbor, your 
relative or someone at work. Remember that the accused "criminal" might be 
innocent. This could happen to you.

THE BOND ISSUES;

<P>
GOVERNMENT FINANCING ON THE INSTALLMENT PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
LIKE CREDIT-CARD ACCOUNTS, THERE'S A LIMIT TO HOW MUCH SACRAMENTO CAN GO INTO 
DEBT BY SELLING BONDS.

By ED SALZMAN, Ed Salzman is a former editor of the California Journal and 
Golden State Report magazines.

<TEXT>
<P>
California should consider lengthening its motto to: "Eureka -- we found 
bonds." 
</P>
<P>
Next week, the state's voters will decide the fate of seven proposed bond 
issues totaling $5.1 billion. That's on top of $5.5 billion approved in 1988, 
by far the most general-obligation debt authorized in any election year. And 
even before this binge began, the state owed $8 billion from previous bond 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Another big bond package is already being prepared by the Legislature for the 
November ballot, and there is no end in sight to the demand for megabucks to 
build the public-works projects needed by the state at the start of the 21st 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
California was essentially forced into heavier bond financing by the tax revolt 
of 1978, which placed limits on spending but left a loophole for financing 
projects through voter-approved bond issues. The Gann spending limit does not 
apply to funds raised through the sale of bonds, thereby encouraging officials 
to accomplish as much as possible on the installment plan. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, environmental organizations have discovered that they can sell 
bond issues to the public by way of the initiative process, as they did in 1988 
with a $776 million parks proposal and as they are attempting in June with a $2 
billion passenger-rail construction measure. Gerald Meral, executive director 
of the Planning and Conservation League, has spearheaded the use of bond 
initiatives as a means of circumventing the legislative budget process and 
mobilizing the environmental movement in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Californians generally approve bond proposals because debt is easier to sell to 
voters than higher taxes and because inflation helps government make its 
payments with relatively cheap dollars. One standard argument for using credit 
financing is that bonds pay for projects that will be used by future citizens, 
so it is only fair that they share the burden. 
</P>
<P>
But just like individual credit-card accounts, there's a limit to how much 
government can go into debt or burden future generations. State Treasurer 
Thomas Hayes, supported by Wall Street debt-rating organizations, warns that 
the markets can absorb only about $2 billion in California general-obligation 
bonds a year without impairing the credit of the state. "The bond market is not 
a bottomless pit," Hayes says. 
</P>
<P>
California's reliance on bonds also carries heavy risks of unfulfilled 
expectations of citizens and possible strain on future budgets. Because the 
politicians and the public are authorizing bonds faster than they can be 
prudently sold, there could be long delays in delivery of the benefits promised 
by bond sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Larkin of Standard and Poor's, one of the three major credit rating 
agencies, says his firm would consider downgrading California bonds if the 
state starts to exceed $2 billion a year in sales. The effect would be an 
increase in interest rates and thus increased cost to taxpayers over the life 
of the bonds, typically 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
California has not yet reached the danger point. It has the highest credit 
rating and still gets favorable interest rates. But that could change rapidly 
if the pace of bond issuance continues to accelerate.

Most of the ballot arguments against Proposition 115 are based on the false 
premise that the measure will eliminate the state constitutional right to 
privacy. Article 1, Section 1 of the California Constitution guarantees that 
right and is entirely unchanged by Proposition 115. What the initiative would 
do is limit a criminal defendant's procedural rights regarding search and 
seizure, speedy trial, privacy, and other matters to those provided under the 
federal Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The right to privacy has been abused by criminal defendants to keep the jury 
from learning relevant evidence against them. For example, defendants have made 
claims that their rights to privacy would be violated if the jury were told of 
their confessions made in police cars or recorded by police in jail cells. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents of the initiative are also claiming that it will somehow affect 
the abortion issue. There is no reference in Proposition 115 to abortion. It is 
clear from the ballot argument in favor of Proposition 115, and from the 
language of the proposition itself that it was intended to affect only criminal 
procedure and not the right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most outrageous claims made by the initiative's opponents is that it 
will "undermine religious freedom" and eliminate free-speech rights such as the 
right to circulate petitions. Proposition 115 has nothing to do with religious 
freedom or free speech. More important, these rights are guaranteed by the 
First Amendment to the United States Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Nor will Proposition 115 make it "difficult" to keep medical records private. 
The confidentiality of medical records has been protected by statute for as 
long as anyone can remember, and the initiative does nothing to change that. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing in Proposition 115 suggests any intent to "criminalize certain sexual 
preferences." The due process clause of the U.S. Constitution does not permit 
punishment for status (such as sexual preference), but only for conduct. 
California was one of the first states to decriminalize sexual conduct between 
consenting adults, including persons of the same sex, and there is no threat 
that the outmoded and unenforceable "bedroom laws" of the past will ever be 
resurrected. 
</P>
<P>
In case there are some voters who do not care about any of these issues, the 
opponents throw in an old standby: the threat of new taxes. The ballot argument 
claims that Proposition 115 will cost "millions of dollars in new taxes." The 
initiative contains no provisions for tax assessments. In fact, it will save 
money by eliminating unnecessary court appearances for which court-appointed 
attorneys are paid, and by shortening the trial process. This will be 
accomplished by streamlining the jury selection process to allow the judge 
rather than the lawyers to ask the questions, by eliminating separate closed 
sessions for questioning of jurors in death penalty cases, by allowing the 
statements of certain witnesses to the police to be used at the preliminary 
hearing instead of a live appearance in court, and by eliminating duplicative 
pretrial probable-cause hearings. 
</P>
<P>
A final misconception is that Proposition 115 will result in more trials. What 
the initiative would do is restore the option of prosecutors to proceed by 
grand jury indictments or by preliminary hearing. This option is contained in 
the state Constitution, but was effectively nullified by the Rose Bird Court. 
While most cases will continue with the preliminary hearing procedure, 
Proposition 115 will give prosecutors the flexibility to use the grand jury for 
those cases in which it is more efficient to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Voters should not allow these scare tactics to prevent essential reform of the 
criminal justice system.

BANNING LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Little Red Riding Hood has been banned in Culver City first-grade classrooms 
because some parents claimed that Trina Schart Hyman's version of the Brothers 
Grimm fairy tale promotes alcoholism among primary students (Metro, May 19). 
</P>
<P>
In this version Little Red takes a loaf of fresh bread, some sweet butter, and 
a bottle of wine to her grandmother's cottage in the deep woods. After being 
eaten by the wolf, Granny and Red are rescued by a huntsman. They celebrate by 
eating the fresh bread and sweet butter. "Grandmother drank some of the wine 
and Red Riding Hood had a cup of blackberry tea. After a while, grandmother 
felt quite strong and healthy." The illustration shows grandmother flushed and 
cheerful with a glass of wine in her hand. This critics say sends a message to 
first graders that drinking wine is an acceptable way to relieve stress and 
feel better. 
</P>
<P>
Nonsense. First graders know the best way to relieve stress is to throw 
tantrums, hit younger siblings and break toys. They prefer French fries, soda 
pop and sugared cereal to wine. 
</P>
<P>
If parents want to complain, how about cruelty to animals? The huntsman cuts 
open the wolf while the animal is snoozing in grandma's bed. Isn't that cause 
for animal rights' activists to protest this story? The huntsman also skins the 
wolf and takes the pelt. Where are the groups against fur coats? 
</P>
<P>
This version of Little Red Riding Hood won national awards and is included on 
the recommended reading list published by the California State Department of 
Education. Yet some nit-pickers begrudge poor, old, ailing granny a glass of 
wine. 
</P>
<P>
Why do some adults read things into fairy tales? What child considers 
Goldilocks and the Three Bears a personal rights case or the Little Red Hen a 
worker's compensation case? "Oh, A Hunting We Will Go" use to be a children's 
song. Now it seems to be a book banner's anthem.

PAT ROBERTSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thanks for spoiling my breakfast as I read the article about televangelist Pat 
Robertson forming a political coalition (Part A, May 15). The American voters 
resoundingly rejected his right-wing agenda when he ran for president and he's 
going to attempt to shove it down our throats again. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps someone should tell Robertson that this is a pluralistic nation and we 
don't need him trying to dictate what we can read, watch on television or how 
we conduct our spiritual lives. 
</P>
<P>
His attempts to "see a country governed by Christians" is frightening. I'm 
quite sure it's from Robertson's point of view. Thanks, but I prefer the 
vitality and strength that comes with diversity and the contributions of all 
religions.

TIDIEST VICTORY OF BUSH'S PRESIDENCY; 
</P>
<P>
BUT NOW CLEAN AIR BILL GOES TO SMOKE-FILLED ROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two versions of a federal Clean Air Act now heading for conference on Capitol 
Hill should someday make many Americans breathe easier. 
</P>
<P>
But the big winners right now are President George Bush and Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed new clean-air requirements could unravel, of course, if John 
Sununu, White House chief of staff, gets too ambitious about the "fine-tuning" 
he says it needs while the Senate and House negotiate away differences in their 
bills. Or it could unravel if some environmentalists are right in saying that 
part of the fine print is fine-tuning that would weaken their impact. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, and for Bush, the 401-21 House vote for the bill -- with his marks 
all over it -- is the tidiest victory of his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
And, perhaps for the first time, Southern California has a chance for air clean 
enough to meet health standards, thanks to the militant diligence of Rep. Henry 
A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and bipartisan teamwork by Rep. Jerry Lewis 
(R-Redlands). 
</P>
<P>
And Bush got everything he asked for, and then some. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Senate and House approved his pioneering program to control acid rain 
that is killing lakes and forests in Canada and the northeastern United States 
(mostly from industry in the Midwest). 
</P>
<P>
Both bills call for 10-million-ton reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Both versions went along with the Bush idea to give utilities that make an 
extra effort to cut emissions pollution credits that they could save for future 
use or sell to other companies. 
</P>
<P>
And toxic emissions from chemical plants and other polluters would fall by as 
much as 75% to 90%. 
</P>
<P>
But the most significant breakthroughs for Southern California are in new 
proposals, presented most effectively in the House version, for controlling 
automobile pollution, which accounts for half of the region's smog. 
</P>
<P>
In one example of what makes the House bill by far the preferable one, the 
Senate version dictates precisely how crude oil must be refined to make cleaner 
gasoline. (It seems that when politicians start practicing chemistry, strange 
things happen.) The Senate formula would, in effect, make 
carbon-monoxide-reducing ethanol, most commonly made from corn, the only 
gasoline additive that could raise its oxygen content to stipulated levels. 
This might make senators from corn states more interested in clean air. But 
ethanol also increases emissions of the basic ingredients of smog, and for 
Southern California and many other urban areas, that is bad. 
</P>
<P>
The House version is much more flexible. 
</P>
<P>
Both bills force 60% reductions in auto emissions of nitrogen oxides and 40% 
cuts in hydrocarbons by mid-decade; these are the two worst smog culprits. 
</P>
<P>
And there's a bonus for California. 
</P>
<P>
When Waxman failed to get a mandate for production of cars that burn cleaner 
fuels than gasoline, he made a deal. He settled for a test program for 
California that would require the auto industry to build 750,000 cars in the 
next seven years that produce only half the pollutants allowed under existing 
law. They could burn natural gas or even reformulated gasoline as long as they 
met the standard. A terrific move. 
</P>
<P>
The bills could cost American industry and consumers $20 billion a year, so 
writing the Clean Air Act was a bruising process. And it's not over yet. 
</P>
<P>
But at this point, it looks like winners all around.

IT'S SECURITY

By Five years ago, Carmelia Goffe, a 42-year-old mother of three sons, was able 
to buy her first home through the innovative Nehemiah Project in Brooklyn, N.Y. 
Similar housing is planned for Los Angeles. Goffe told The Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I had been renting a two-bedroom, subsidized apartment for $330 a month. The 
house initially cost $49,000, but with the $10,000 subsidy, I got it for 
$39,000 with a $5,000 downpayment I scraped together from my savings and from 
loans from my family. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody chipped in and helped. 
</P>
<P>
I would never have been able to own a house at that time without the Nehemiah 
grant. I am a single parent. I was making about $23,000 (annually) at the time. 
I had looked into home ownership but there was no way with my salary and the 
large down payments. 
</P>
<P>
Having the house has meant security. It's affordable and it's a nice 
surrounding. Where I lived before wasn't nice in terms of crime and dark 
stairwells. It's made life much better when you are trying to raise sons in the 
big city with drugs and crime and all those things. Life is much better. The 
streets are nice. It's an area where people care about their houses and that 
makes it a better environment.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES MEMORIAL DAY; 
</P>
<P>
HAPPILY, TODAY'S YOUTH HAVE LITTLE TO REMEMBER -- YET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Mann, Jack Mann is a consultant and writer in Santa Ana. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following is a letter written by Jack Mann to his daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Memorial Day is that holiday that began in 1866 as a celebration and 
remembrance of the bravery and sacrifice of those who fought in the American 
Civil War. Over the years, it has included the fallen and the living combatants 
of too many more wars, but always the intent was the same: a moment to mark the 
deeds of men and women who performed their duty when called upon by their 
country without regard to politics, policies or voice in the matter of their 
destinies. 
</P>
<P>
In today's world, the Memorial Day weekend marks the beginning of summer. Only 
the Old Warriors like your dad have anything to remember, anything to remark to 
commemorate this day. Vietnam is now a generation in the past, and since I came 
home on my two feet instead of in a body bag, you, too, will let this day pass 
in celebration of things far less somber than the remembrance of war. And that 
is good. 
</P>
<P>
With great luck, your generation will know nothing of the agony of war, with 
all its grief, suffering and ultimate, futile losses to all sides. But just in 
case man continues to act like man, and should you have sons of your own, 
remember this: In nearly every generation, American sons have bought and paid 
for your great privilege of freedoms, including the one now exercised to forget 
all about the original meaning of a three-day weekend and suck down suds on the 
beach instead. 
</P>
<P>
Shield your sons from war if you can, but never forget that your father is here 
because his father went to war and you are here because I went to war. No, 
neither your grandfather nor I made America safe by ourselves; but we were part 
of the process that allowed America to show its will to survive. 
</P>
<P>
World War II was politically justified, having been started by three aggressor 
nations without justification. Vietnam was not, except to the extent that one 
remembers that, at the time, our national posture was that communism was 
monolithic and we held the domino theory to be valid (i.e., if one Southeast 
Asian nation fell to communism, the rest would fall like dominoes). 
Nonetheless, both conflicts served notice that America was mighty of sword and 
not without the political courage to take up that sword both in defense of its 
shores and its national policies. 
</P>
<P>
I would also advise you to learn to hate war, but it is a parental commandment 
you cannot follow, for it is but an abstraction to you, and no doubt a badly 
warped one at that. Nevertheless, you have the built-in female aversion to 
anything as stupid and foolish as war, so my concern for you and your sister is 
less than it would be if I were the father of sons. Still, I fear for the lives 
of your children more because of the war in the streets of America than because 
of defeat on some future military battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
More combat-age youngsters are dying from drugs and gang warfare in America in 
a year than all the casualties of our 10-year-long involvement in Vietnam. At 
its worst, American deaths in that field of clashing armies and ideologies 
could not have been with less purpose than an 18-year-old being shot down in 
his front yard at home by a passing maniac with an AK-47 in today's America. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, a Memorial Day would not be necessary in a world where man's 
civilized and intellectual progress matched his cleverness in producing in a 
single generation the means with which to wipe his kind and every living 
species off the face of the earth. Despite progress in all other areas of human 
affairs, man seems doomed to the simple fact that he is not born with the full 
knowledge of all those who have lived before, but rather is forced by the very 
nature of life itself to learn anew the lessons of survival and then, 
hopefully, wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
The accident of birth as to geography, living conditions and the opportunity to 
thrive makes it obvious that the child of a starving Biafran mother and one of 
a Newport Beach matron are not going to live identical lives on Earth. Yet, the 
African child can grow to be a man of integrity and honor, while the Golden Boy 
of Newport Beach may turn out to be cruel, greedy and stupid. It is the 
unpredictability of people everywhere that makes life without war a cherished 
dream of the rational instead of a fait accompli. 
</P>
<P>
Memorial Day is to me, then, a means to honor the bravery and sacrifices of 
individual Americans called upon by their not-always-right government to go 
forth and serve their nation. This bypasses the long and ultimately senseless 
arguments about the issues of humanity that cannot be solved with protest 
marches; insurrections; clashes of hawks and doves, workers and intellectuals; 
and all the other manifestations of man's clearly demonstrated inability to 
agree en masse about almost anything. 
</P>
<P>
The best thing that could happen to Memorial Day is that it slide off the 
calendar into the dustbin of history where lie other special days of 
celebration now long forgotten by people who no longer need to remember. If we 
can do this and not lose America in the process, I hope that it happens in your 
lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
You and your sister filled my thoughts for an indescribably long journey 
through a dark and terrible land. The light at the end of the tunnel for me was 
the opportunity to return home to my family. I remain grateful for that 
privilege, and so it is that Memorial Day will always be a reminder that not 
everyone who served with me shares this privilege. I came home with my shield, 
not on it.

DRUG FOE ELECTED, VOWS END TO COLOMBIA TERROR;

SOUTH AMERICA: PRESIDENT-ELECT ALSO SAYS INDUSTRIAL NATIONS ARE NOT DOING 
ENOUGH TO CUT CONSUMPTION.

BOGOTA, Colombia

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cesar Gaviria, the candidate with the toughest stance against Colombia's 
violent cocaine traffickers, won the nation's presidential election Sunday and 
called for the eradication of "narco-terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
"We have to eradicate it from our life, from our society," Gaviria said in a 
radio interview Sunday evening after his victory was assured. "There is nothing 
that threatens our civilized life and our possibilities for progress and 
prosperity more than narco-terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
Later, flanked by bodyguards, he spoke at a victory meeting in a downtown 
hotel. "We will defeat narco-terrorism, but narco-trafficking is certainly a 
multilateral problem, and the industrialized countries are doing little to face 
the problem of drug consumption," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Official results late Sunday from three-quarters of the ballot boxes, or more 
than 5 million votes, gave Gaviria 47.3% and an irreversible lead over the No. 
2 candidate in a field of 12. 
</P>
<P>
The country's chronic violence cast a shadow of tension over the elections, 
although no fatal incidents were reported during the voting. Guerrillas and 
narco-terrorists have been accused of killing hundreds of Colombians during the 
campaign, including three presidential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday morning, rebels of the National Liberation Army made several attacks in 
provincial areas. No deaths were reported, but five police officers in 
Santander department, west of Bogota, were wounded, radio stations reported. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities canceled voting in several villages because guerrillas stole or 
burned ballots and other election documents. 
</P>
<P>
Defying the bloody terrorist campaign by traffickers, Gaviria has vowed to 
fight them "without concessions" as a matter of principle. "We cannot renounce 
the defense of principles because of terrorist acts," he had said on the eve of 
the elections. 
</P>
<P>
He had predicted a popular mandate to press his hard-line policy. "I believe a 
vote near 50% is a sufficient mandate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The narco-terror campaign by Colombia's drug barons has its roots in the Aug. 
18 assassination of Luis Carlos Galan, a Liberal presidential hopeful. After 
his slaying, the government began a crackdown on the drug lords, extraditing 
several suspects to the United States. In reaction, the drug traffickers have 
waged a terrorist campaign against the government in which scores have been 
slain. 
</P>
<P>
Representing a new generation in the governing Liberal Party, Gaviria will 
succeed President Virgilio Barco Vargas in August. Barco was constitutionally 
barred from reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's partial returns gave 26.8% of the votes to Alvaro Gomez, leader of a 
Social Conservative Party splinter group; 11.5% to Antonio Navarro of the 
Patriotic Alliance M-19, a movement founded by former leftist guerrillas, and 
10.4% to Rodrigo Lloreda, the Conservative candidate. 
</P>
<P>
More than 90% of the voters also approved a ballot measure calling for a 
constitutional assembly that all four major candidates said was needed to make 
government and judicial reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Gaviria, 43, describes himself as a centrist. He has a degree in economics and 
served in Barco's Cabinet as minister of finance and of government. He has been 
a member of the lower house of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 police and military troops patrolled the country and guarded 
7,100 polling places during the day. 
</P>
<P>
Voter turnout was heavy in many Bogota voting places. Even before polls closed, 
Bogotanos began gathering in street rallies and parading along avenues in cars, 
waving their candidates' banners, cheering and honking horns. 
</P>
<P>
Turnout was lighter in Medellin, Colombia's most violent city and home of the 
so-called Medellin cartel of cocaine traffickers. City officials imposed 
curfews for the three nights before the election after a series of bloody 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, police in Bogota announced that they had seized more than a ton of 
dynamite and arrested six men accused of making bomb attacks in Bogota for the 
cartel. 
</P>
<P>
One of those arrested was an air force sergeant who worked at an air base where 
Barco's presidential plane is based, police said. The report revived recurrent 
fears of narco-terrorist penetration in security agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Another man arrested was identified as the brother of a man known as "Tyson," 
who police say coordinates terrorist attacks for fugitive Pablo Escobar, 
Colombia's most notorious drug lord. Authorities have accused Escobar of 
ordering numerous fatal bombings and the assassinations of the three 
presidential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Galan, on March 26, an assassin opened fire on a domestic 
airline flight and killed candidate Carlos Pizarro of the M-19. Bernardo 
Jaramillo, candidate of the leftist Patriotic Union, was killed March 22. 
</P>
<P>
Gaviria will govern with Liberal Party majorities in both houses of Congress, 
which was renewed in March elections. 
</P>
<P>
Colombia, with 32 million people, has the second-largest national population in 
South America after Brazil. Nearly 14 million were eligible to vote Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Colombian presidents have been elected by popular vote throughout this century 
except for a period of military dictatorship from 1953 to 1958. From 1958 to 
1974, Conservatives and Liberals alternated in power under a "National Front" 
agreement between the two traditional parties. 
</P>
<P>
Domination by Liberals and Conservatives has limited popular participation in 
government and has often blocked social reforms. Gaviria has pledged to work 
for change. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, we have all believed that one of the reasons for the guerrilla 
violence has been because we have had a relatively closed system," he said in 
an interview Saturday. 
</P>

ASTRO'S 4 TELESCOPES MAY FILL IN GAPS ABOUT SPACE

Imagine seeing the full complexity of a movie like "Lawrence of Arabia" when 
all you had previously seen was a 60-second trailer, or the vibrant detail to 
be gained from studying a Matisse painting when all you had previously seen was 
a black-and-white print. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly speaking, that is the kind of improvement astronomers hope to gain this 
Wednesday at 12:40 a.m. when the space shuttle Columbia carries the 
$150-million Astro observatory into orbit. The three ultraviolet telescopes and 
one X-ray telescope aboard the shuttle will afford astronomers an unprecedented 
view of the universe in a broad range of wavelengths that hitherto have been 
largely inaccessible, blocked from ground-based telescopes by the absorbing 
power of the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
In a mission of unusual ambition and complexity, and the first ever to be 
devoted to a single scientific discipline, the seven-man crew of Columbia -- 
which includes five astrophysicists -- and their counterparts on Earth will 
work around the clock for 10 days, taking as many as 300 pictures with each 
instrument before packing them up and bringing them home. 
</P>
<P>
The mission is a sharp contrast to the recent flight of the shuttle Discovery, 
which five weeks ago launched the Hubble Space Telescope. Hubble will view the 
stars in great detail for the next 15 years, and the differences between it and 
Astro have sparked a strong rivalry between the crews of the two shuttles. 
</P>
<P>
"We get to be astronomers," said Astro mission specialist Jeffrey A. Hoffman. 
"All they (the Discovery crew) do is throw out a telescope. Anybody can do 
that." Added mission specialist Robert A. R. Parker: "We'll be sending down 
science data while (the) space telescope is still doing engineering checkout." 
</P>
<P>
The Hubble and Astro telescopes differ from each other in much the same manner 
as a spyglass does from binoculars. Hubble is designed to look at very narrow 
regions of space at very high resolution. Astro is meant to study much broader 
regions, but with less resolution. The Astro telescopes also observe at a 
variety of wavelengths to which Hubble is blind. 
</P>
<P>
During the 10-day mission, astronomers will study a variety of celestial 
objects ranging from planets and moons in the outer solar system to Supernova 
1987a -- an exploding star, located about 160,000 light-years from Earth, that 
was first detected in January 1987; from nearby "starburst" galaxies that have 
an unusually high rate of star formation, to distant quasars that are the 
oldest and brightest objects known. 
</P>
<P>
They will also get their first look at large portions of the sky that have 
never been viewed in either ultraviolet or X-ray wavelengths because of the 
atmosphere, and they may even see the first direct evidence for the existence 
of black holes -- those mysterious and elusive collapsed stars that are so 
heavy and dense that not even light can escape their intense gravitational 
pull. 
</P>
<P>
"Each of the instruments is designed to do something that no other existing 
telescope or spacecraft can do," said astronomer Stephen P. Maran of NASA's 
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. "It's going to provide an 
important source of knowledge about what goes on in space." 
</P>
<P>
In their leftover time, the Columbia crew will teach a science lesson from 
space that will be beamed by satellite to high schools around the country. And 
payload specialist Ronald A. Parise will attempt to make ham radio contact with 
Soviet cosmonauts aboard the space station Mir -- perhaps to commiserate with 
the cosmonauts on their need to repair some insulation before returning to 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the four telescopes, to be mounted on pallets in the payload bay of 
Columbia, has its own mission to perform, although their roles are 
complementary. In fact, the three ultraviolet telescopes will be operated in 
unison to provide different pictures of the same celestial objects. The X-ray 
telescope will be operated independently of the other three; sometimes it will 
photograph the same stars as the ultraviolet telescopes, other times it will 
photograph other objects. 
</P>
<P>
The largest of the telescopes is the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope or HUT, 
designed by astronomer Arthur F. Davidsen and his colleagues at Johns Hopkins 
University in Baltimore. It has a 36-inch mirror coated with the rare metal 
iridium to allow it to reflect an unusually broad spectrum of ultraviolet 
frequencies. 
</P>
<P>
HUT also has an exceptionally sensitive electronic detector coated with cesium 
iodide, which allows it to "see" incoming ultraviolet photons. This detector 
must never come in contact with normal air -- especially water vapor -- because 
that would destroy its ultraviolet sensitivity. High-efficiency vacuum pumps 
must be used to keep it in a near-vacuum continuously, except for brief 
transition periods in a dry nitrogen atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most challenging and significant projects" for HUT will be the 
search for helium in the intergalactic medium, Davidsen said. When the universe 
was formed in the Big Bang, astrophysicists believe, its principal components 
were hydrogen and helium. "It's that primordial hydrogen and helium, out of 
which everything else came, that we would like to detect directly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Helium absorbs light at ultraviolet wavelengths detectable only by HUT. "Either 
we will detect it, or we will set a very stringent limit" on the amount of 
matter that can be present in intergalactic space, Davidsen said. The question 
of how much invisible matter is present in the "vacuum" of space is a crucial 
one because it determines whether the universe will eventually collapse in on 
itself or expand forever. 
</P>
<P>
The next largest telescope, with a 15-inch mirror, is the Ultraviolet Imaging 
Telescope or UIT, designed and built by astronomer Theodore P. Stecher and his 
colleagues at Goddard. It is the only one of the four instruments that will not 
produce data during the Columbia flight. Instead, it carries enough film to 
make 2,000 exposures during the flight. The photos will be developed after 
Astro is returned to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
UIT has the largest field of view of any ultraviolet telescope ever built. It 
"covers a vastly larger piece of the sky" than Hubble, Maran said, and thus can 
be used to discover new objects that will be studied in detail by Hubble. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Hubble, which responds to both visible and ultraviolet light, UIT 
responds only to ultraviolet light. "When you look at a globular star cluster 
in visible light, it is dominated by the red giant stars," Maran said. "But 
they all drop away in the ultraviolet, so you can look and discover large 
numbers of white dwarfs, which are shrunken down and quite hot." 
</P>
<P>
UIT will also be used to search for an "ultraviolet light echo" of the 
explosion that created Supernova 1987a. According to conventional theory, the 
ultraviolet light output of the supernova should have peaked just hours after 
the original explosion, while the output of visible light peaked 85 days later. 
</P>
<P>
Both light peaks should cause "echoes" when the bright light is reflected by 
interstellar dust and bounced back to Earth, appearing in telescopes as faint 
and ever-enlarging circles surrounding the supernova. One astronomer, Arlen 
Crotts, has already discovered the visible light echoes, and researchers hope 
to observe the ultraviolet light echoes with UIT. By comparing the intensities 
of the light in the two wavelengths, researchers should be able to determine 
the microscopic composition of the dust grains and their arrangement in the 
clouds. 
</P>
<P>
The properties of interstellar dust are also the focus of the third ultraviolet 
telescope, the Wisconsin Ultraviolet Photo-Polarimeter Experiment, also known 
as WUPPE, which has a 20-inch mirror. It was designed and built by astronomer 
Arthur D. Code and his colleagues at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. It 
will observe polarized ultraviolet light, which has been virtually unstudied. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the electromagnetic radiation that is light vibrates uniformly in all 
directions, like the pistons on an old-fashioned radial airplane engine. 
Polarized light, in contrast, vibrates preferentially in one direction like the 
pistons in a four-cylinder automobile. 
</P>
<P>
Although ultraviolet light is not normally polarized, it can be polarized by 
passing through strong electric fields or by interaction with interstellar 
dust. Studying its polarity will thus reveal a great deal about the magnetic 
fields of other stars and about the composition of interstellar gases. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth and final telescope is the Broad Band X-Ray Telescope or BBXRT, 
designed and built by Peter J. Serlemitsos and his colleagues at Goddard. It 
has an unusual new design. 
</P>
<P>
X-rays are not reflected by mirrors in the same way as normal light. Instead, 
they are reflected only when they strike the mirror at a very shallow angle. 
Hence, conventional X-ray telescopes use very large, highly polished metal 
mirrors that, in fact, have only a very small effective X-ray collecting area. 
</P>
<P>
Serlemitsos developed a design in which literally hundreds of very thin sheets 
of gold-coated aluminum foil can be nestled close together to reflect an 
unusually large proportion of the X-rays entering the telescope, making 
possible unusual X-ray gathering power. 
</P>
<P>
One prime target of BBXRT will be Supernova 1987a. Researchers hope it will 
provide the first firm evidence of the existence of the neutron star that most 
astronomers are sure must be at its center. Visible and ultraviolet light from 
the neutron star are scattered by the large amount of debris around it, but 
X-rays should easily pass through. 
</P>
<P>
"All the heavy elements in the universe have been formed in such explosions," 
Serlemitsos said. "If we can trace the amounts and distribution of the heavy 
elements (in the supernova), we can start putting together good models of how 
heavy elements are built." 
</P>
<P>
To maximize their viewing time in orbit, the astronauts will be divided into 
two teams, Red and Blue, which will work 12-hour shifts each. When the Red team 
is on duty, Columbia pilot Guy S. Gardner, 42, will fly the shuttle to point 
the payload bay in the direction from which observations will be made, mission 
specialist Parker, 53, will operate the aiming system for the ultraviolet 
telescopes and payload specialist Parise, 38, will operate the telescopes 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
When the Blue team is on duty, mission specialist John M. Lounge, 43, will fly 
Columbia, mission specialist Hoffman, 45, will operate the aiming system and 
payload specialist Samuel T. Durrance, 46, will operate the telescopes. Shuttle 
commander Vance D. Brand, 58 and on his fourth flight, will work a staggered 
shift that overlaps with both teams. 
</P>
<P>
The BBXRT will be operated remotely from Goddard.

ADOPT-A-GRAVE REVIVES TWO CEMETERIES 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People all over America adopt children. In this East Bay city, they adopt 
graves. 
</P>
<P>
Not just any grave, but final resting spots in the community's two historic 
cemeteries -- Alhambra, dating back to 1851, and St. Catherine's, established 
in 1870. 
</P>
<P>
The "Adopt-A-Grave" program is the linchpin of a volunteer effort that has led 
to the restoration of the cemeteries. And hundreds of people in Martinez, as 
well as various civic organizations, have responded to it. 
</P>
<P>
"Adoption" papers for each grave come with a biography of the person buried in 
it. More importantly, with the adoption comes responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
A person or group adopting a grave promises to care for the burial site. As a 
result, the nearly 4,000 graves in the two cemeteries are immaculate. Instead 
of weeds, there are flowers. Tombstones are upright and in place. And burials, 
which once had ceased at both cemeteries, have resumed. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the program not only has transformed the two cemeteries into sources of 
community pride, it has led to major celebrations on Memorial Day and Veterans 
Day. This year, all of the city's veterans' organizations are to gather for a 
special service at Alhambra Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't always been like that. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, the two cemeteries were choked with underbrush and high weeds. 
Tombstones had been toppled by vandals and were hidden from sight. 
</P>
<P>
At St. Catherine's, a retaining wall had given way, loosing the dirt next to it 
and exposing several caskets and human remains. "It was horrible," recalled 
Charlene Perry, 67, the city's historian. 
</P>
<P>
Funerals were no longer conducted in either cemetery because of the sad state 
of affairs. And as the cemeteries sat neglected, their future appeared in 
doubt. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Church, which owns St. Catherine's Cemetery, was preparing to 
remove the tombstones, relocate the graves and sell the land to developers. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street, a similar fate apparently awaited Alhambra Cemetery. Members 
of the association that owned it had died and no one had paid taxes on the land 
for years. The state scheduled a tax sale to dispose of the property; the 
likely buyers were developers who planned to build expensive homes and 
condominiums on the choice graveyard property high on a hill overlooking scenic 
Carquinez Strait and Suisun Bay. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Perry and several other Martinez residents went into action. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us got to thinking, 'Hey, wait a minute. This is sacred ground, the 
final resting place for nearly 4,000 men, women and children who spent their 
lives in Martinez,' " the historian said. 
</P>
<P>
It was Perry who came up with the idea for the Adopt-A-Grave Program. The 
Catholic Church and the Martinez City Council, which assumed ownership of 
Alhambra Cemetery and paid its delinquent taxes, agreed to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The council also created a cemetery commission and named Perry and four others 
as members to serve as caretakers for the burial site, as well as coordinate 
efforts to restore St. Catherine's. 
</P>
<P>
Records of burials at both cemeteries were lost. Cemetery commissioner Phyllis 
Wainwright, 73, spent a year copying names from each tombstone in Alhambra 
Cemetery, alphabetizing them, noting grave locations and transcribing them to a 
directory at the cemetery entrance. Cemetery commissioner Margaret Silva, 62, 
spent a year doing the same at St. Catherine's. 
</P>
<P>
The cemetery commissioners then spent months scouring history books, city and 
county records, newspapers and interviewing local residents to develop 
biographies on all the deceased for adoption papers. 
</P>
<P>
When the Adopt-A-Grave Program was announced, the cemetery commission was 
swamped with volunteers. "We had some weird calls, too," recalled Perry. "Like 
how do you adopt a dead person?" 
</P>
<P>
In a gratifying development for the commissioners, many of those participating 
in the program are youngsters. "Getting the children involved is very 
important. We wanted them to have a feeling for history, to have a reverence 
for what has gone on before," said Wainwright, lifelong Martinez resident and 
retired teacher. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Church has spent money upgrading retaining walls, cemetery 
walkways and roads in St. Catherine's Cemetery. The City Council, meanwhile, 
now includes the Alhambra Cemetery in its annual budget for the same type of 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Both cemeteries contain the remains of several well-known California pioneers. 
Dancer Carolyn (Papinta) Holpin, who lived from 1867-1907 and in her heyday was 
the toast of European capitals, is buried in Alhambra Cemetery. She was called 
the "Flame Dancer," a reference to the erotic dance she performed with 33 yards 
of red chiffon. 
</P>
<P>
Also buried in Alhambra is Joseph Reddeford Walker, who in 1833 became the 
first non-Indian to see Yosemite Valley. He was characterized by author 
Washington Irving as "one of the bravest and most skillful of mountain men."

POOR CHECKUP FOR VETERANS HOSPITALS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: TYPICAL FACILITY IS AT LEAST 20% MORE LIKELY THAN NON-VA HOSPITALS 
TO FAIL QUALITY STANDARDS, ACCORDING TO A STUDY. SYSTEM IS BURDENED WITH AGING 
FACILITIES AND IN NEED OF RESTRUCTURING. 
</P>

<P>
The typical veterans hospital is considerably more likely than other hospitals 
to fail quality standards in key areas such as surgery, emergency care and 
intensive care, according to a major study by the commission that accredits 
most of the nation's health care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The study of 116 veterans' hospitals, obtained by The Times from the Department 
of Veterans Affairs last week, is likely to trigger renewed debate over the 
adequacy of government medical care for the nation's 27 million veterans. About 
3.5 million veterans use the 172 medical centers administered by the VA each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations in 
Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., found that VA medical centers are at least 20% more 
likely than non-VA hospitals to fail quality standards in six important areas: 
emergency services, special care services, surgery and anesthesia services, 
surgical case review, alcohol and drug treatment planning, and fire safety. The 
study compiled overall statistics and did not name facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Arthur J. Lewis, the VA's acting chief medical director, said he "was 
concerned by the wide disparities" and that medical centers would be expected 
to "attend promptly to those areas where remedies can be achieved quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis maintained that many of the areas of non-compliance represented 
inadequate "documentation" and "did not necessarily equate to poor care" or to 
"loss of accreditation." 
</P>
<P>
Despite expenditures of $11.6 billion a year, the VA medical care system is 
burdened with aging facilities. It is often characterized as being 
understaffed, under-funded, inefficient, and in need of fundamental 
restructuring. Last year, a VA study found higher than predicted death rates 
among patients at about one-fourth of the medical centers, including 22 that 
were judged to have "likely quality of care problems." 
</P>
<P>
"I have worked with the VA for a number of years and they have had an 
increasing number of problems," said Don Avant, a special assistant to the 
president of the commission. "It is a big, cumbersome, bureaucratic system. 
They have a lot of very good people, but they may be trying to keep too many 
hospitals afloat." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. William Jessee, the commission's vice president for accreditation surveys, 
said the VA had "a seriously aging infrastructure in its health care 
facilities" and had not been "adequately funded to bring these physical plants 
up to current life-safety standards." 
</P>
<P>
VA officials and the commission staff will meet in early June to "try to make 
sense out of (the data)," Lewis said. The VA also plans a variety of programs, 
including a satellite video teleconference in September, to help hospitals 
address high priority issues. 
</P>
<P>
The VA asked the commission to compile the statistics in response to a request 
in January from Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), chairman of the Senate Committee 
on Veterans Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"I am quite concerned about the differences," Cranston said in a statement 
Friday. "The VA must do a better job and it will." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson said the senator had asked the General Accounting Office to 
"investigate on an expedited basis the significance of the data." 
</P>
<P>
The study, sent to the VA in April, compared 116 VA medical centers to the 
5,182 other hospitals that the commission surveyed between 1987 and 1989. 
Hospitals are surveyed an average of once every three years. 
</P>
<P>
On the commission's complicated 100-point rating system, the typical VA 
hospital scored 69.8, compared to a score of 77 for the typical non-VA 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Only 6% of VA medical centers received 87.5 points or more -- a very high score 
-- compared to nearly a quarter of the other hospitals. At the low end of the 
scale, 16% of VA medical centers scored 57.5 points or less, compared to 4% of 
other hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals with inspection scores of 50 or below are placed on probationary 
status, as are some facilities with higher scores but serious problems in key 
areas. These hospitals risk losing their accreditation if the deficiencies are 
not quickly corrected. The names of probationary hospitals and non-accredited 
facilities are made public, but the inspection reports are confidential. 
</P>
<P>
According to the VA, six medical centers are on "conditional accreditation" 
status. These include three in California -- Long Beach, Sepulveda and Palo 
Alto -- two in Oregon and one in Washington. None of the nation's VA hospitals 
are non-accredited. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's quality standards scrutinize the systems that protect patients 
and improve their care, according to the commission's Jessee. They do not 
measure the care received by patients. 
</P>
<P>
"The greater the number of contingencies (areas of non-compliance), the greater 
the likelihood that there might be an adverse event in patient care that could 
have been prevented," Jessee said. 
</P>
<P>
A key limitation of the study is that it compared VA hospitals to all non-VA 
hospitals, not to a matched random sample of hospitals of similar size, type 
and scope of services. In addition, the three deficiency rankings for the 
quality standards -- partial compliance, minimal compliance and non-compliance 
-- were all given equal weight in the analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Jessee said the VA would have to consider the "political risk" of asking the 
commission to perform more sophisticated analyses. "It could cut both ways," he 
said. "It might help them improve the care in their system . . . (but) it could 
make them look better or look worse." 
</P>
<P>
Conditionally accredited hospitals must submit plans of corrections. If the 
plan is accepted, the hospital is reinspected six months later. Fully 
accredited hospitals must either submit written progress reports or undergo 
focused surveys that target the specific problem areas. 
</P>
<P>
The commission considers its standards to represent optimal performance. As a 
result, nearly all hospitals are found to be deficient in at least one of about 
20 core areas. These areas include quality assurance, medical staff monitoring 
and nursing staffing and procedures. Many hospitals have deficiencies in four 
or five areas. 
</P>
<P>
But the typical VA facility racks up far more deficiencies, or "contingencies," 
on key quality standards than the typical non-VA hospital, according to the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
As a group, VA hospitals were found deficient in six of the core areas on more 
than 60% of the inspections. A total of 69.8% of VA hospitals were found 
deficient in medical staff quality monitoring; 71.7% in surgical case review; 
74.6% in special care services such as intensive or coronary care; 62.7% in 
surgery and anesthesia services; 66.2% in the alcohol and drug treatment 
planning process; and 82.4% in hospital life-safety. For emergency services, VA 
hospitals had a 50.9% deficiency rate. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, as a group, non-VA hospitals had much lower levels of 
non-compliance -- typically between 30% and 50% -- in these areas. 
</P>
<P>
"There are always going to be unfortunate adverse events," Jessee said. "But if 
(hospitals) are in substantial compliance with these standards, you are less 
likely to see the same adverse event happen more than once."

VAN DE KAMP RIDES THE RAILS TO PROMOTE STATE TRAIN SYSTEM

Carried at the leisurely pace of a modern-day passenger train, John K. Van de 
Kamp traveled south through California's Central Valley on Sunday to urge 
construction of a high-speed rail system that would stretch from Sacramento to 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic gubernatorial candidate compared the proposal -- which would 
cost at least $7 billion -- to the freeway building boom under former Gov. 
Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr. 
</P>
<P>
"We've talked about our transportation needs. We've studied. We've planned. Now 
it's time to act," Van de Kamp said at a press conference in the Amtrak station 
here, after a three-hour train trip from Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's plan would include passenger trains from Bakersfield to Los 
Angeles, a link that he said "is the key to all future intercity rail transit 
in California." He also advocated linking Sacramento and Stockton, which is the 
northernmost railroad station in the Central Valley, and speeding up rail 
transportation between Los Angeles and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general's proposal was announced against the backdrop of the 
familiar political tool, the whistle-stop train trip. Harry Truman used it to 
propel himself to the presidency in 1948. More recently, Democratic nominee 
Michael S. Dukakis rode the very same rails as Van de Kamp during the 1988 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, along with his wife, Andrea, and campaign aides, boarded a bus in 
Sacramento to take him to Stockton, where he hopped onto the Amtrak train 
traveling south. 
</P>
<P>
He spent most of the time reading in his seat. But after two passengers walked 
forward from the lounge car and tried to beckon him back -- "Voters!" one woman 
cried, pointing to the lounge -- he navigated through three passenger cars, 
stopping once in a while to greet travelers. 
</P>
<P>
During the day, the attorney general repeatedly contrasted the availability of 
rail service in countries like Japan and France with the shortage of such 
service in California. 
</P>
<P>
"The notion that freeways can solve our long-term transportation needs is just 
about as dated as the Berlin Wall," Van de Kamp said. "By the turn of the 
century, we should commit ourselves to attaining the basic standard of rail 
service that exists today in Western Europe." 
</P>
<P>
The seed money for a revamped transportation system would come from 
Propositions 108 and 116, which are on the June 5 ballot and which Van de Kamp 
supports. They would deliver about $3 billion in bond revenues over the next 
decade to pay for transit projects. The connected system he envisions would 
cost at least $4 billion more, Van de Kamp said. He suggested that the money be 
raised by selling more bonds. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he proposed creation of a state rail agency to plan commuter 
railroad systems and reform the state's transportation plan and California 
Transportation Department operations to bring rail spending up to par with 
highway spending. 
</P>
<P>
The tried-and-true train ride was not the only traditional device adopted by 
Van de Kamp on Sunday, nine days before he and former San Francisco Mayor 
Dianne Feinstein hear the judgment of Democratic voters. 
</P>
<P>
Before boarding the train, he traveled to three Sacramento churches serving the 
black community and asked for support, at times sounding more like a preacher 
than a politician. 
</P>
<P>
"We should love one another," he told church members at St. Paul's Missionary 
Baptist Church. "We should put behind us the hate and violence that's become so 
prevalent. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm running to do good things," he said. "I'm running to change California, to 
break with the past, to set a new course." 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, Feinstein also campaigned on the black church circuit 
-- a spirited morning tour of four congregations in South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At each stop, worship was halted so that Feinstein could take the pulpit with a 
two-pronged message. She appealed unabashedly for votes in the primary election 
now just a week from tomorrow, and she appealed for racial tolerance in the 
years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, who has slowed the pace of her campaign this holiday weekend, 
described her mood as she spoke to reporters before services at First A.M.E. 
Church. "Exhilarated, yes," she said. "But there is some anxiety, too, with the 
election so close." 
</P>
<P>
In her back-to-back church appearances, Feinstein quoted the late Martin Luther 
King Jr. on racial harmony: "There is no separate path to black power." 
</P>
<P>
Then, she added: "Do you think it's time for us to be one people?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," the parishioners at Mr. Tabor Baptist Church shouted in reply. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing her speech in this community where women are abundant among leaders, 
Feinstein generated some of the loudest approval of the day with this string of 
amen-sister questions: "Do you think a woman can lead? Do you think a woman can 
be a healer? Do you think a woman can bring people together?" 
</P>
<P>
"Give us your prayers. Give us your votes," she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein scheduled a private fund-raiser in Chino later Sunday and had no 
public appearances planned for Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters questioned Feinstein about her pledge on Saturday to allocate state 
appointive jobs to women and minorities based on their share of the population. 
She said her "goal" was to reach such parity in the policy-level ranks of 
government by the end of her first term. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what people yearn for, to share it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And when a reporter persisted with questions about her commitment to quotas, 
she repliedtartly: "There are a lot of people who believe representative 
democracy is just that -- that they have a chance to represent their people."

ENVIRONMENT IS A NATURAL ISSUE FOR POLITICIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a 30-second sales pitch beamed into the living rooms of California voters, 
John K. Van de Kamp gazes over a panoramic view of the golden state: Parklands. 
Waterfalls. The Big Sur coast. 
</P>
<P>
"He's sponsoring Big Green -- the environmental initiative to protect our 
coastline and outlaw cancer-causing pesticides," intones the campaign ad's 
unseen announcer. 
</P>
<P>
Yet only weeks ago on Earth Day, the biggest environmental celebration in 20 
years, it was not Van de Kamp who dominated television screens in Southern 
California. It was Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks, she had refused to take a position on the initiative. But with an 
eye carefully cast to political advantage, she chose two successive Earth Day 
celebrations in voter-rich Southern California to embrace the most sweeping 
environmental initiative ever proposed. 
</P>
<P>
This year in California, politicians are rushing like lemmings to stress their 
commitment to what is left of California's natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone today is an environmentalist," Atty. Gen. Van de Kamp said recently, 
with more than a touch of sarcasm in his voice. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, as much as anything else, the environment has become the 
motherhood-and-apple-pie issue during Van de Kamp and Feinstein's months-long 
tussle for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. On hot-button topics, there 
is even bipartisan unity, with Republican Pete Wilson as well as the two 
Democrats opposing offshore oil drilling. And all three have taken pains to 
tout their environmental stripes in television ads. 
</P>
<P>
To some environmentalists, that similarity defines the problem this year for 
voters. Between deeply felt positions and political expediency, the three major 
candidates for governor have all crafted records that -- if not perfect -- at 
least inoculate them against a full-scale attack against their environmental 
credentials. 
</P>
<P>
"The voters could be confused readily by the barrage of inputs that they could 
be getting," said Patricia Schifferly, regional director for the Wilderness 
Society. "It's going to be very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the difficulty centers on merging a complex issue such as environmental 
preservation with the quick-hit sound bites and television ads that define 
politics in California. 
</P>
<P>
"Environmental issues in the '90s don't lend themselves to explanations in 30 
seconds," Schifferly said. "Many of them are interdependent. On the line is the 
desert ecosystem. On the line are the wetlands. On the line are the ancient 
forests." 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, leaders of environmental organizations are preparing to issue 
reports on the records and positions of the three gubernatorial candidates. 
Because their conclusions are pending, many declined to be interviewed for this 
story. 
</P>
<P>
When Van de Kamp and a host of environmental leaders last August unveiled the 
"Big Green" initiative, which is expected to be on the November ballot, it 
quickly became the marker against which other environmental platforms were 
measured. For months, while Feinstein decided whether to support it, Van de 
Kamp questioned her level of commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, meanwhile, has used specific environmental issues as wedges to 
separate Van de Kamp from his environmental supporters. Weeks ago, she began 
what has become a persistent criticism of the attorney general by arguing that 
he has been lax in tracking down toxic dumpers. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, trying to regain the offensive after a rocky few days 
following their first debate, she announced her opposition to the state's 
malathion spraying program, and rebuked Van de Kamp for his role in defending 
the Deukmejian Administration effort. Hours later, he responded by joining her 
in opposing urban spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Environment issues mirror the candidates' approaches to many of the pressing 
issues of this campaign -- Van de Kamp more specific and lawyerly, Feinstein 
more centrist and conciliatory. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's environmental platform is, pure and simple, Big Green. It would 
ban 24 pesticides known to cause cancer in humans within 5 years, with a 
three-year extension allowable if there was no alternative. It would ban 
imported food grown with pesticides, outlaw offshore oil drilling, rule out 
clear-cutting of redwood forests and prompt deep cuts -- a 40% decline in 20 
years -- in the gases that affect the earth's ozone layer. It also calls for 
the election of an independent environmental advocate and the establishment of 
a $500-million fund to finance the cleanup of oil spills. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general has traveled throughout the state for Big Green, sometimes 
at a loss to his own campaign: When surrounded by environmentalists from 
organizations which are nonpartisan, Van de Kamp has had to carefully avoid 
mentioning his own aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
But the collision of his candidacy, the environmental initiative and the rise 
in voter interest in the subject undoubtedly has helped Van de Kamp. In an 
April trip through the Central Valley, he carefully surrounded himself with 
human symbols of environmentally related suffering, a rare personal touch for 
the attorney general's campaign. The mother of an 11-year-old boy who blames 
her son's death from leukemia on the pesticides that were sprayed near their 
home stood next to him in Bakersfield; up California 99 in Fresno, a farmer 
whose ill health forced him to turn to pesticide-free agriculture was at Van de 
Kamp's side. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp and his campaign aides say, however, that until they recently began 
running ads connecting the attorney general and the initiative, he had not 
benefited as much as he hoped. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I satisfied with the connection up to now? No," said campaign consultant 
Bob Shrum, who is helping run the Van de Kamp campaign. "But starting a week to 
10 days ago, I think people are getting the point." 
</P>
<P>
However strongly Feinstein can ally herself with Big Green now, the 
environmental platform she unveiled in the week before her endorsement of the 
initiative was more moderate. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than ban pesticides outright, for example, the former San Francisco 
mayor vowed to accelerate University of California research into integrated 
pest management, or natural ways of ridding farmlands of pests. Rather than set 
a specific timetable for reducing gases that contribute to global warming, she 
called on the state to "pursue standards to reduce atmospheric emissions." 
</P>
<P>
Trying to escape from the Big Green shadow, she also has proposed environmental 
education for California schoolchildren and reorganization of the state's toxic 
strike force into a high-activity "swat team". 
</P>
<P>
Some of Feinstein's environmental plans are tentative. Questioned a week ago 
about a mandatory state recycling program she suggested in April, Feinstein 
said she was still studying a range of options. 
</P>
<P>
"The details need to be worked out and they will be," she said. "But what I'm 
saying is that this is what I stand for. I'll get lawyers and staff to draft 
the stuff once I get there." 
</P>
<P>
Big Green and Van de Kamp also skip over some details -- it is never explained, 
for example, how global warming gases would be cut by 40% in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
While her endorsement of Big Green has taken the edge off criticism by 
environmentalists, Feinstein remains dogged by the image of not being a 
forceful ally in the past. According to many of those involved the 1986 
anti-toxics initiative Proposition 65, Feinstein's support for the measure was 
tempered after opponents pressured her. 
</P>
<P>
"She's been so middle of the road -- on anything," said Van de Kamp supporter 
Tom Epstein, the initiative's campaign manager. "Sort of Wilsonesque on how 
careful she is in following a middle course." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson -- in the background for months, with no major opposition in the primary 
-- is likely to be in the news again soon, when President Bush announces his 
long-awaited decision on oil drilling off the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
"Wilson has been careful enough that it's going to be difficult for a Democrat 
to make the environment a dividing issue," said Epstein. 
</P>
<P>
The senator is the only one of the three candidates not endorsing the 
initiative. Yet he, too, has earned some kudos from the environmental 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"Sierra Club is extremely grateful for your consistent support of strong 
legislation for clean air as well as other environmental protection measures," 
the club's president, Richard Cellerius, said in a letter commending Wilson as 
one of 18 senators in the 'Clean Air Honor Roll.' "Your votes for strong clean 
air legislation . . . did not go unnoticed in the environmental community." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has benefited from comparisons with other Republicans who are less 
moderate on environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
"He is . . . one of the better Republican candidates," said the Wilderness 
Society's Schifferly, who has disagreed with Wilson on several issues. "He is 
definitely a real step above (Republican Gov. George) Deukmejian." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's strong suit has been his opposition to offshore oil drilling, a stand 
he has maintained since the Carter Administration. He is credited with spurring 
President Bush's 1988 campaign change of heart on offshore drilling, and of 
pressing for a moratorium on the leasing of offshore tracts. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not an election year convert to these causes," he told the environmental 
group Heal the Bay earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson also has proposed a Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Agency for 
the state, and has vowed to use the governorship as a "bully pulpit" to 
persuade Californians to do their part for the environment. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson has been at odds with environmental groups as well, angering them in 
1988 when he opposed a bill giving wilderness protection to 8 million acres in 
the Mojave Desert and in 1986, when he did not endorse the anti-toxics 
initiative. And he remains distanced from activists this year because of his 
refusal to endorse the sweeping Big Green initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"The environmental litmus test for all the gubernatorial candidates is their 
support for the environmental initiative," Al Meyerhoff of the Natural 
Resources Defense Council said recently. 
</P>
<P>
"Rhetoric is running freely now. Everyone is claiming to be an 
environmentalist. So we need a little truth in advertising."

Voters in Myanmar (formerly Burma) turned the country's first elections in 30 
years into a show of defiance against the military government Sunday, and the 
opposition said it was heading for a landslide victory. 
</P>
<P>
State radio, announcing the first result in the National Assembly elections, 
said the National League for Democracy won at least one district in Yangon, the 
capital, with 80% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
League candidates said the issue now is whether the military junta, which 
assumed power after soldiers crushed a pro-democracy uprising in September, 
1988, will step down. 
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's 20 million voters turned out in large numbers. No conclusive results 
are expected for several days. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign was marked by restrictions and harassment. Several opposition 
leaders were detained and banned from running.

ANGRY MARSEILLES CALLS ITS IMAGE CRIMINAL;

FRANCE: DETRACTORS ARE THREATENED WITH LAWSUITS. IT ALL STARTED WITH THE 1960S

MARSEILLES, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The second-largest city in France is tired of being insulted, pushed around, 
slandered and, even worse, taken for granted by the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting back, the Marseilles Establishment has mounted an aggressive campaign 
to defend its honor against pompous Parisians, libelous Lyonnais, blasphemous 
Bordelais and anybody else who tries to mock Marseilles. 
</P>
<P>
If the critics persist, the Marseillais warned recently in an open letter, they 
will be taken into court. One of the country's biggest newspapers has already 
been sued. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, signed by 70 of the city's leading citizens, among them rabbis and 
priests, doctors, artists and union leaders, and reproduced in full-page 
advertisements in national newspapers, said in part: 
</P>
<P>
"Marseilles addresses France, Europe and the world. Too much is too much. 
Enough is enough. Persistent rumors, willful smears, repeated lies, perverse 
slanders often filled with hate tarnish our image and threaten to slow our 
growth and reduce our standard of living." 
</P>
<P>
How did this proud former gateway to the French African Empire fall so low? 
</P>
<P>
Marseilles is one of the oldest cities in France. It dates back to the time of 
the ancient Greeks and was an important port of the Roman Empire. 
</P>
<P>
The city's decline began in the 1960s with the "French connection," chronicled 
in two American movies, which revealed the city as the main heroin-processing 
center for the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the "lemonade war" of the mid-1980s, in which more than 50 Marseilles 
gangsters were gunned down in a dispute over the control of nightclubs on the 
Mediterranean coast. 
</P>
<P>
Now the "war of the clinics" is sullying the image of the city. This is a kind 
of "General Hospital" run amok, with a member of the City Council, a doctor, 
charged with arranging the shotgun murder of another councilman, also a doctor 
-- and creating a crisis for the mayor, who is a brain surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that the crime rate in Marseilles is lower than in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that the sleazy old port has been cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that Socialist Mayor Robert Vigouroux, the brain surgeon who swamped 
his opponent in last year's elections, has 50 ambitious projects to revitalize 
the city's drooping economy. 
</P>
<P>
The war of the clinics provided the French press, particularly the Parisian 
dailies, with a field day. The right-of-center Le Figaro published a photograph 
of a man on a balcony pointing a gun at the city's old port. 
</P>
<P>
Vowing revenge, the 750-member Marseilles Bar Assn. promised to sue the next 
journalist who treats the city unfairly. "Touch our city and you touch 
lawyers," said attorney Bernard Guibert, who represents a booster organization 
called A New Look at Marseilles. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend," he said, "to sue anyone who defames Marseilles -- journalist, 
author, cinematographer, animator, even the people . . . themselves, who very 
often denigrate their city instead of defending it."

The country's bridge players, once feared by dictator Nicolae Ceausescu as a

a six-year ban. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, outlawed bridge, popular with the 
intelligentsia, and shut down clubs where the card game was played. "They were 
worried that when too many intelligent people got together, it could easily 
develop into something else," mathematician Mircea Mihu said. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety-six tables were at play simultaneously Sunday at the start of an 
eight-day tournament in Bucharest, testifying to the game's survival.

Before the ban, Romania was among the top 10 competitive nations in Europe.

<P>
President Bush offered a Memorial Day message of peace Sunday, saying, "That's 
what this summit coming up with Gorbachev is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Bush added that during his three days of meetings with Soviet President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev, he will try to convince him that "we don't seek anything other 
than peace and prosperity for the people of the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the President sent a strong signal that U.S.-Soviet relations 
will suffer over the Kremlin's response to the Baltic republics' efforts to 
gain independence. 
</P>
<P>
Bush described the question of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian independence -- 
opposed by Moscow -- as a "troubling" matter "that I don't want to sweep under 
this rug" during the summit. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to have him understand the constraints on any U.S. President until 
self-determination is visible and forthcoming there," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
He made his remarks in an interview with Soviet television commentator Valentin 
Zorin on Thursday in the White House family dining room. A transcript of the 
10-minute interview was made public Sunday by the White House in Kennebunkport, 
where Bush is spending the Memorial Day weekend at his vacation home. 
</P>
<P>
For Bush, it was a morning of church and an afternoon of golf, a day in which 
summit preparations decidedly took a back seat, at least in public. He is 
scheduled to return to Washington this afternoon to begin final summit 
preparations. Gorbachev is scheduled to arrive Wednesday evening in Washington, 
and the summit talks begin Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
After a morning worship service at the First Congregational Church, Bush 
attended a brief service in memory of a local man killed in Vietnam in 1969. 
Asked afterward for his thoughts on the Memorial Day weekend before his meeting 
with Gorbachev, the President replied: 
</P>
<P>
"Simply respect for those that gave their lives. . . . And recognition that . . 
. the world is getting smaller, and everybody, regardless of their faith and 
background, aspires to see a world at peace." 
</P>
<P>
In his interview on Soviet television, the President acknowledged differences 
between the two superpowers, but his emphasis was on cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got grandchildren, and he's got family, and we can talk about it as human 
beings. Hey, what are we going to do to make things a little safer? If we 
argue, we'll do that pleasantly," Bush said. "He's a tough guy. Listen, I've 
been around him enough to know that he drives his point home. Well, I can do 
the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Bush added: "I think it's important that I level with him -- here's what's in 
my heart, here's our policy. I want you to understand it. I want you to 
understand that this policy has nothing to do with making things more difficult 
for the Soviet Union. Indeed, if you take my advice, sir, it will be much 
better for the Soviet Union. See, that's the way I'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that he hopes to make progress at the summit on efforts to reach a 
treaty slashing the superpowers' long-range nuclear arms. He will also strive 
to "get more progress" in the so-far slow-moving effort to achieve deep 
reductions in conventional arms in Europe and to reach "a breakthrough of 
sorts" in agreeing to deep cuts in the two nations' chemical weapons arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he expressed hope about narrowing the differences on the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization's role in a unified Germany. The Soviet leader has 
threatened to pull the Soviets out of the conventional forces reduction talks 
if the West insists on East Germany's pulling out of the Warsaw Pact and 
becoming part of NATO in a united Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the state of his personal relationship with Gorbachev, with whom he 
last met in Malta in December, Bush said: "Wait until I see him and then I'll 
be able to tell you, because he may be mad with me over some things because we 
do have some differences." 
</P>
<P>
He then added: "I think we have a personal relationship that's good. . . . I'm 
confident we can have good, open discussions."

Freed hostage Frank H. Reed's joyous reunion Sunday with his 91-year-old mother 
was tempered with an urgent plea for the speedy release of the six Americans 
still held captive. 
</P>
<P>
"They aren't well," he implored after arriving at Boston's Logan International 
Airport. "They are sick. I promise you they are sick. Let us not forget them." 
</P>
<P>
Reed, 57, who has been undergoing medical tests at Andrews Air Force Base in 
Maryland, saw his mother for the first time in eight years in a tearful airport 
reunion before meeting reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"He said to me, 'you're a great mother.' We shed tears of joy," said Leota 
Sprague, who was too weak to join her son earlier. "I say rejoice, give 
thanks." 
</P>
<P>
"She looks lovely," said Reed, with his mother at his side. She was in a 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
The Reed family, including his wife, Fahima, and 9-year-old son, Tarek, 
traveled by motorcade to his daughter's house in this suburb north of Boston, 
where cheering neighbors and 100 yellow ribbons awaited the hometown celebrity. 
The suburb of 56,000 planned a parade for Reed on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Reed was freed April 30 after 44 months in captivity in Lebanon. He was home 
for a brief Memorial Day break but was scheduled to return Wednesday to the 
Malcolm Grow Medical Center at Andrews Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said doctors were trying to do some "medical sleuthing" to find out why he 
is so anemic. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to do some things to verify the contusions and results of the 
beatings I had for trying to escape twice, not really being left alone until a 
few months ago," Reed said. "Despite it all, they say my heart's fine, my lungs 
are fine, my liver's fine." 
</P>
<P>
Reed also spoke out on behalf of the other hostages he said were in ill health. 
His comments contradicted those he made at a Washington news conference May 6, 
when he told reporters the American hostages "look physically wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
"Terry Anderson is not well," he said of the longest held of the hostages. 
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for the Associated Press, is in his 
sixth year of captivity. 
</P>
<P>
"Thomas Sutherland is not well," added Reed, who last saw the hostages more 
than a year ago. "And I told the people in Washington that they are not well. 
We must do something. We must get the other hostages free somehow." 
</P>
<P>
The other Americans still held hostage are Joseph J. Cicippio, 59, who was 
acting comptroller at the American University in Beirut; Edward A. Tracy, 59, a 
west Beirut resident; Alann Steen, 51, a communications instructor at Beirut 
University College, and Jesse Turner, 42, a professor of mathematics and 
computer science at Beirut University College. 
</P>
<P>
A banner hanging in front of the home of Reed's daughter, Marilyn Langston, 
read, "Free at Last -- Frank Reed, April 30, 1990." Reed has two grown 
daughters from a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Frank Reed, 57, was released April 30 after 44 months in captivity in Lebanon. 
He was the head of the private Lebanese International School when he was 
abducted from his car by gunmen near the Beirut Airport in 1986. He was freed 
eight days after another American hostage, Robert Polhill, was released. They 
were the first Americans to be freed in 3 1/2 years.

"They aren't well. I promise you they are sick. Let us not forget them." Reed, 
who was released last month after 44 months in captivity in Lebanon, was home 
for a holiday break but is still undergoing medical tests in Maryland.

FAA CHALLENGES COLORADO AIRPORT'S BAN ON AFTER-DUSK LANDINGS BY PRIVATE PLANES; 
</P>
<P>
AERONAUTICS: ASPEN-PITKIN COUNTY OFFICIALS CALL THE CURFEW A SAFETY MEASURE. 
THE FEDERAL AGENCY SAYS IT IS UNFAIR. FUNDING IS AT STAKE.

<P>
It's been a good many years now, but Rick Davis can't shake the chill he gets 
when recalling that one particular descent into the Aspen-Pitkin County 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
It was past dusk, and Davis, having threaded through a forest of snowcapped 
peaks, was maneuvering his small plane down the curvy Roaring Fork Valley 
toward the runway. Suddenly, the darkness thickened, and Davis could not 
distinguish the mountains from the dancing shadows. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a distorted perception of the terrain," he remembered. There was "this 
terrible claustrophobic feeling, like everything was narrowing in on me." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, now acting manager of the airport, touched down safely minutes later. 
But many others meet a different fate. Pitkin County, a region of towering 
peaks, plunging valleys and schizophrenic wind currents, is littered with the 
rusting carcasses of planes whose pilots were outmatched by the unforgiving 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Pitkin County officials long ago barred private planes from landing in their 
treacherous neck of the woods after dark. The curfew, they say, is a vital 
safety shield both for inexperienced pilots and for residents in the flight 
path as well. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration, however, doesn't see it that way. In a 
mushrooming battle being watched by aeronautical groups nationwide, the FAA has 
concluded that the curfew discriminates against general aviation pilots and has 
ordered Pitkin County to do away with the restriction. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials say the curfew is unfair because it allows commercial 
airlines to land until 11 p.m. while banning private planes 30 minutes after 
sunset. Unless the landing time is equalized, Pitkin County will lose FAA 
funding for future airport construction projects and may be sued for $11 
million in federal money spent over the past 20 years, the agency has warned. 
</P>
<P>
"What we want is for them to treat all aircraft alike," said Mitch Barker, 
spokesman for the FAA's regional office in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Conceding that they have a David-and-Goliath war on their hands, Piktin County 
commissioners nonetheless are determined to persuade the FAA to make an 
apparently unprecedented finding that safety considerations mandate a different 
standard for different aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize we're breaking some new ground, but we believe the FAA has erred in 
assuming that this is a safe airport for any pilot, whether it's a doctor 
flying in for vacation from Wichita or a commercial pilot with 10 years of 
experience," Commissioner Wayne Ethridge said. "If you accept the FAA's logic, 
you'd have to conclude that anyone who drives a car could drive in the Indy 
500." 
</P>
<P>
Because of its famed ski slopes, Aspen draws a steady flood of private pilots 
vacationing with their families. Many of these so-called "flatlanders" are 
unfamiliar with mountain navigation and unaware of the altitude's effect on the 
performance of their aircraft, local pilots said. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1980 and 1988, 22 plane crashes, claiming 20 lives, occurred in Aspen 
or the immediate vicinity, according to the National Transportation Safety 
Board. On April 27 of this year, a single-engine Cherokee carrying six 
passengers slammed into the Continental Divide 11 miles from town. No one 
survived. Nearly all of the wrecks involved general aviation craft. 
</P>
<P>
"Maps of the accidents look like people have taken a pepper shaker and 
sprinkled it all over the mountains," said John McBride, an Aspen businessman 
and veteran pilot who is on the county's air-rescue team. "Probably 95% of 
those accidents were caused by pilot error." 
</P>
<P>
The FAA has been aware of the Aspen curfew for years, but took no action 
against the county until receiving complaints from two organizations of general 
aviation pilots -- the National Business Aircraft Assn., which represents 
corporate aviation, and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Assn. The curfew, these 
groups told the FAA, is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pure discrimination, and we won't take it," said E.H. Haupt, manager of 
airport and environmental services for the NBAA in Washington. Haupt conceded 
that Aspen "has an interesting approach" that is "not for a flatlander," but 
argued that "our people are just as qualified as those on the commercial 
carriers to get in there." 
</P>
<P>
In a stern letter in March, the FAA warned Pitkin County to eliminate the 
discriminatory curfew. If the county refused, it could say goodby to future FAA 
funding and risk a lawsuit forcing repayment of millions used in recent years 
for runway lighting, navigational aids and other improvements. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Pitkin County officials are considering equalizing the curfew at 
10 p.m. for both commercial and private planes. That prospect, however, has 
angered Continental Express and United Express airlines, the two carriers that 
service the ski town. 
</P>
<P>
Aspen residents, meanwhile, have urged the commission to stand firm, with rock 
musician Don Henley, who owns a home in town, reportedly coughing up money for 
the fight. The support is not surprising. Many locals remember well the time a 
plane plunked down in the midst of the Brush Creek subdivision, killing four 
people. And few have forgotten that just last year a Federal Express pilot 
crashed into the hillside a whisker away from the exclusive Red Mountain 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Many local aviators, noting that they avoid flying into Aspen at night, endorse 
the curfew. Realtor and pilot Kent Kelly, however, says, "an imprudent pilot 
can kill himself during the daylight hours just as easily (as at night), and 
it's not the county commissioners' job to legislate against that possibility." 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the curfew hurts tourism here, in addition to being blatantly 
discriminatory," said Kelly, who accused the commissioners of using safety as a 
smoke screen for their true intention -- to keep a lid on air traffic. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, county officials predict the dispute may well wind up in court. 
County Manager Reid Haughey realizes the odds of prevailing are poor, but 
figures it's time somebody challenged the mighty FAA. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't Lawrence, Kan. What the FAA is protecting here is the legal right 
of any private pilot to splatter himself on the side of the mountain," Haughey 
said. "Well, we don't think much of that argument." 
</P>

A migrant Mexican worker, cashing in five lottery tickets he had forgotten 
about for a year, won a $182,000 grand prize but almost had it snatched from 
under his nose, Mexico City's attorney general's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Lazaro Gonzalez Rojas, 53, a poorly paid cook's assistant in Mexico City, found 
the ticket stubs on May 11 after they had been buried for over a year in 
luggage, the attorney general's office said. 
</P>
<P>
His luck almost ran out, however, when a lottery outlet operator told him they 
were worthless, took the tickets and claimed the jackpot, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez Rojas later realized he had been tricked and persuaded police to 
arrest the woman and her nephew, the statement said. She paid him up in full.

SPRING STORM SOAKS NORTHERN PART OF STATE 
</P>

<P>
A late spring storm was expected to cover the western Sierra Nevada with 6 to 
12 inches of snow overnight as rain continued to soak Northern and Central 
California, the National Weather Service said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Southerly winds gusting up to 40 m.p.h. will accompany the storm over the 
Sierra on the Nevada-California border before conditions improve to partly 
sunny this afternoon, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
The weather service predicted the snow level would drop to about 5,000 feet at 
Mt. Shasta by early Memorial Day, 6,500 feet at Lake Tahoe, 7,500 feet in 
Yosemite and 9,000 feet in the southern Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches will be common in the mountains with one-half 
to 1 inch at most lower elevations, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
By Sunday afternoon, rain showers had spread as far south as Santa Maria, 
Bakersfield and the far southern Sierra. Precipitation was expected to reach 
the Tehachapi Mountains by Sunday night. A slight chance of rain was predicted 
for the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
About an inch of rain fell in San Francisco and the North Bay on Sunday, 
spoiling plans of Memorial Day picnickers and forcing cancellation of the 
baseball game between Oakland and Cleveland. Honeydew in Humboldt County 
received 5.1 inches of rain during the weekend and Ross, in the northern San 
Francisco Bay Area, got 2.9 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Napa reported 1.25 inches of rain on Sunday, causing vintners some concern 
about crops as well. 
</P>
<P>
"In 20 years in the business I have never seen so much rain during the bloom 
period," said Forrest Tanner, winemaker at Iron Horse Vineyards near Sebastapol 
where, he said, 2 inches had fallen this weekend and 2 inches last weekend. He 
said it's normally warm and sunny at this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
Weather service forecaster Daryl Williams said the storm should not cause any 
severe wet pounding. 
</P>
<P>
"But we might get a steady, slow, soaking rain out of it, which is better," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said more rain is expected in the north by midweek. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome as it was, the precipitation was not expected to have a major impact on 
drought conditions in the state, officials said.

PARCEL TAX -- AN UPHILL FIGHT IN A CITY OF WEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the city of legendary wealth, the public school system is once again 
rattling its tin cup. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills parents, teachers and students by the dozens have been knocking 
on doors throughout the city in recent days urging residents to vote to tax 
themselves on behalf of the schools in the June 5 election. At stake, they say, 
are the quality of education in the 4,700-student Beverly Hills Unified School 
District and, indirectly, property values. If the city's schools are allowed to 
decline, they argue, the lure to live there will be lessened. 
</P>
<P>
The tax must be approved by two-thirds of the voters to take effect. 
Residential and commercial land parcels in the city would be assessed between 
$250 to $750 annually for the next five years, depending on size and use, to 
raise about $4.5 million a year for the schools. 
</P>
<P>
The levy has become a major civic cause in Beverly Hills, drawing the active 
support of celebrities, the Chamber of Commerce and the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters acknowledge that the school system is not on the verge of collapse. 
It is, however, in danger of becoming ordinary, says Bernard Nebenzahl, a 
chairman of the Yes on Schools Committee. The parcel tax, he says, is needed to 
maintain the "diversity, variety and depth" of the school system, which already 
has had to rebound from a 13-day teachers' strike last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of the tax have staged parades and rallies featuring actors such as 
Valerie Harper and Corbin Bernsen. They are passing out lawn signs and peddling 
T-shirts to all who will have them. And they plan to raise and spend as much as 
they can -- $100,000, if possible -- to try to sell the tax to voters. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the campaign for the tax appears to face an uphill battle. Statewide, 
school tax elections have had only a 37% success rate over the last seven 
years. Beverly Hills' last parcel tax attempt, in 1987, was among the failures: 
59% of the voters favored the tax, short of the two-thirds majority needed. 
</P>
<P>
Winning approval may be especially tough in Beverly Hills. The city has large 
contingents of elderly voters and residents with no school-age children -- 
groups that are generally likely to oppose a school tax. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two groups that in other cities would probably deliver a strong 
"yes" vote -- teachers and parents of school-age children -- have little 
electoral strength. 
</P>
<P>
With housing in Beverly Hills so expensive, all but about 10% of the teachers 
live outside the district, according to the teachers' union. And the parents' 
clout is diluted because a high percentage are recent immigrants not yet 
eligible to vote. There are no precise figures for the parents, but school 
officials say 43% of the students are foreign-born. 
</P>
<P>
An organized anti-tax campaign seems hardly necessary under such circumstances, 
but a low-key group of opponents, touting familiar themes of tax revolt and 
back-to-basics in education, has found its message well-received at several 
recent public forums. 
</P>
<P>
At a debate sponsored by local homeowners' groups last week, anti-tax campaign 
leader ShermanKulick drew enthusiastic applause from some elderly residents 
when he simply stated: "You (would) have to pay the tax even if you don't have 
kids in the schools." 
</P>
<P>
While that argument may give some residents all the reason they need to vote 
no, Kulick's group, Beverly Hills Citizens for Cost-Effective Quality 
Education, is raising additional questions about the school district and its 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
They note that despite its supposed poverty, the district spends almost $6,000 
per student annually, more than any other unified school district in Los 
Angeles County (the statewide average is about $4,800). They argue that school 
districts in the county's other affluent communities, such as San Marino, La 
Canada and Palos Verdes Peninsula, spend less per student, yet their students 
score as well as or better than Beverly Hills students on standardized tests. 
</P>
<P>
Conceding that their test scores may be no better than those in these other 
districts, Beverly Hills officials say their students benefit from a broader 
menu. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Beverly Hills has smaller classes and offers more foreign 
languages and Advanced Placement courses than San Marino or La Canada. In its 
elementary schools, it offers instruction in art, music and computers by 
specialists in each field. The high school has a planetarium. 
</P>
<P>
The San Marino school district, which serves the city with the highest average 
income in the county, spends just $3,700 per student, in part because parcel 
tax proposals have been defeated twice. Among the school district's economies 
are that it has no librarian, no elementary music instruction and only a 
part-time nurse. 
</P>
<P>
If the parcel tax is rejected in Beverly Hills, administrators say, they will 
have to cut costs by 10% next year, to about $30 million. It will mean program 
cuts and the layoff of 48 of the district's 300 teachers, counselors, 
librarians and nurses, they estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Among the positions targeted for elimination are the Academic Decathlon coach, 
two of the district's three nurses, and all elementary school music teachers 
and computer specialists. The planetarium is to close. And a proposed 3% pay 
increase for teachers, negotiated during the teachers' strike but made 
contingent on the passage of the parcel tax, would also have to be dropped. The 
raise proposal is aimed at keeping salaries competitive with Los Angeles 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills administrators say their basic financial problem is inadequate 
state funding. Until the late 1970s, most money for schools came from local 
property taxes, and wealthy cities such as Beverly Hills could easily raise and 
spend far more on schools than poor communities. 
</P>
<P>
But that changed. A 1976 state Supreme Court decision required the state to 
equalize funding among the districts, and in 1978, Proposition 13 limited 
property taxes. Control of funds shifted from local school boards to 
Sacramento. Now, about two-thirds of the the average school district's revenues 
come from the state, whose allocations are based on enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills, however, has some revenue sources not available to other 
districts. The city government pays the district a generous $4.6 million a year 
for the occasional use of school facilities. A nonprofit foundation organized 
by parents raises about $350,000 a year. A cluster of oil wells on the Beverly 
Hills High School campus pumps $276,000 into the district treasury annually. 
</P>
<P>
Still, declining enrollment has cut into state funding, and over the last five 
years the district has eliminated 50 teachers and administrators, school 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
When the 1987 parcel tax failed, the district had some reserves to draw on. But 
now, Assistant Supt. Sol Levine says, the reserves have dried up and "I don't 
see any other way to raise money." 
</P>
<P>
Tax opponent Kulick says the district simply needs to eliminate frills. Drama, 
music and other "Mickey Mouse courses," he contends, simply divert students 
away from the three Rs. 
</P>
<P>
Responds Levine: "When you visit the Louvre, is art a frill?" When you go to 
the Music Center and hear a Beethoven symphony, is music a frill?"

POLICE SIGNS GO UP -- AND CRIME GOES DOWN 
</P>

Carol Hamilton squinted and surveyed the crowd of about 150 people eating hot 
dogs, dancing to rap music and playing softball Sunday afternoon at Ross Snyder 
Recreation Center in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are gang bangers here they must be having a good time," said 
Hamilton, executive assistant to Councilman Gilbert W. Lindsay, standing in the 
shade of a yellow- and white-striped tent and handing out cookies to 
youngsters. "Today, there's no turf thing going on here." 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the upbeat mood at the recreation center on East 41st Street might 
have seemed incongruous -- the park is smack in the middle of what Los Angeles 
police say was the most violent neighborhood in the 10 square miles patrolled 
by the department's Newton Division. 
</P>
<P>
But on Sunday, residents peacefully mingled with police officers to celebrate 
signs that the community is safer than it was last year: Drive-by shootings 
have dropped 85% and overall crime dropped 24% in the half-square-mile area 
bounded by 33rd Street, Vernon Avenue, Central Avenue and Compton Avenue, said 
Police Capt. Gordon Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
He attributed the decline to 50 wooden and concrete barricades surrounding the 
neighborhood with orange signs warning passers-by in English and Spanish that 
they are entering a narcotics enforcement area. Since February, 10 police foot 
patrols have been assigned to the area at a cost of $27,000 a month to the 
city, Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
"People see these signs and say, 'Wait a minute, I'll go somewhere else to buy 
my dope,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sang Brown, 69, founder of the neighborhood's Jefferson Community Block Club, 
said gang members have stopped congregating in front of his home on 40th Place. 
</P>
<P>
Not every resident agreed with the program's success. "I see them smoking 
(crack) like it's nothing," said Sergio Miguel Cardenas, 17, a sophomore at 
Jefferson High School. 
</P>
<P>
His friend, Jose Delgado, piped in: "There were three drive-by shootings here 
yesterday. If (police) had any idea what was going on, they'd stay here 
overnight."

CREW LOOKS FOR CLUES BELOW MCMARTIN SCHOOL SITE

Jackie McGauley stood, arms folded, eyes open wide, peering expectantly into a 
six-foot-deep chasm that workers had dug beneath the concrete foundation of the 
abandoned McMartin Pre-school in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Down below, a hodge-podge gathering of professional archeologists, soils 
experts and curious volunteers used picks and shovels Sunday to sift the sandy 
soil in a strange urban excavation -- searching for remaining clues to the 
child molestation crimes that parents such as McGauley, insist occurred at the 
now-infamous preschool. 
</P>
<P>
The digging, McGauley hopes, will soon reveal a labyrinthine network of tunnels 
many parents believe were secretly burrowed to spirit away dozens of children 
to become participants in a weird Satanic ritual that included both human and 
animal sacrifices. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63 -- the former 
operator of the family-run school -- were acquitted in January of a total of 52 
counts of molestation and conspiracy. Ray Buckey, a former McMartin teacher, is 
now being retried on eight molestation counts stemming from the alleged abuse 
of three girls between 1979 and 1983. 
</P>
<P>
But even though authorities have long finished their examination of the site, 
parents say the school still has a story to tell. For weeks, they have held a 
silent vigil -- drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes, whispering among 
themselves -- while a team of hired professional excavators digs through the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, workers uncovered a small dinner plate bearing a pentagram parents 
believe could be connected with a Satanic ritual. Digging beneath the 
building's 24-year-old foundation, they have also located at least one crudely 
built tunnel they suspect was used to transport children to the yard of an 
adjacent apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
But their efforts to uncover more tunnels -- and the secret underground room 
where they believe the rituals took place -- have become a battle against time. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, construction crews will begin bulldozing the Manhattan Beach 
Boulevard site to make way for a three-story office building and underground 
parking lot, forever sealing any possibility of finding further clues in the 
molestation case that has provided a national focal point for the issue of 
child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
And so, for the parents, the last days at the McMartin Pre-school have brought 
confusing emotions of frustration, anger and an unlikely sense of hope that a 
significant clue will still be found. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect anything we find here to turn the case around," McGauley said. 
"We're doing this for our children and their credibility. That's the most 
important thing." 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office said it would be happy to examine any new 
evidence found at the site. "If someone presents us with some substantive, 
credible, evidence, we'll certainly take a look at it," spokeswoman Sandi 
Gibbons said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent digging began last month when a group of parents broke through 
the concrete floor of a classroom, looking for tunnels that more than a dozen 
former McMartin students reportedly described to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ted L. Gunderson, a former Los Angeles FBI chief and self-proclaimed 
Satanic expert, persuaded parents to stand by while a team of experts took 
over. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Gunderson says, he has spent 12 hours a day at the site, 
supervising an effort that is costing more than $1,000 a day -- paid for mostly 
by donations. Gunderson said he has donated $2,000 of his own money. 
</P>
<P>
"My interest is just finding out, once and for all, what went on here," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gunderson said workers have uncovered what appears to be a series of tunnels 
that may have been filled in in recent years -- possibly after the 
investigation of the case began in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"The district attorney's office should have been out here doing this job six 
years ago after the case broke in 1983," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gary Stickel, an archeologist, said the team has found what it believes is 
a network of tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
"But a lot of it appears to have been filled in in recent years," he said. "And 
that makes the work difficult. If this site had been sealed off and we had been 
brought in by the authorities years ago when this came to light, who knows what 
we may have found?" 
</P>
<P>
"We have people driving by on the street all the time yelling 'Praise 
Satanism,' " said one parent. "But we also have people coming by to volunteer 
just because they believe that something terribly wrong went on here -- 
something that the authorities have just glossed over." 
</P>
<P>
For parents such as Jackie McGauley, driving by the office building that will 
eventually fill the site won't be as painful -- as long as they know they've 
tried their best to uncover what in recent years has become one of the most 
enduring mysteries around. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I'm glad they're not building another school here," she said. "I'm 
grateful that it'll be something completely different. When the bulldozers come 
to tear this place down, I'll be here. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting rid of this school is like having a boil removed. They'll have to dig 
way down to remove it. It'll be painful. But, in the end, it'll be gone."

MANKIND'S SECRETS REVEALED IN ANCIENT BLOOD SAMPLES; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHEOLOGY: RESEARCHERS' USE OF TISSUE RESIDUE ANALYSIS CAN HELP DATE ARTIFACTS 
AND IDENTIFY SPECIES UP TO 50,000 YEARS OLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

in Washington, D.C.

<P>
Most archeologists are content to dig up pottery, bones and other relics of the 
past. Thomas H. Loy takes a different approach -- he analyzes ancient blood. 
</P>
<P>
Loy, of the Australian National University in Canberra, has developed a 
technique for literally lifting minute splotches of blood off stone tools and 
bones. Not only does the blood possess features that identify what species of 
animal it came from, but it can be used to date artifacts up to 50,000 years 
old. Researchers may even be able to extract bits of genetic material from 
prehistoric blood that will provide insights into human evolution. 
</P>
<P>
Loy introduced his technique of blood residue analysis to the scientific world 
in 1983. In his laboratory, he studied 104 stone tools unearthed in British 
Columbia that range in age from 600 to 1,000 years and found blood deposits on 
nearly all of them. The blood belonged to a variety of animals, he reported, 
including blacktailed deer, moose, snowshoe rabbits, caribou and grizzly bears. 
A few of the younger artifacts contained human blood. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has taken blood residue analysis out of the lab and into the 
field. At a 10,000-year-old farming village in Turkey, Loy and Andree R. Wood 
of the University of Chicago recently extracted the blood of humans, sheep and 
an extinct type of cattle from a stone slab near the entrance of a structure 
ominously known as the "skull building." 
</P>
<P>
Rooms in the rear of the skull building in the Turkish village of Cayonu Tepesi 
contained more than 90 human skulls and the remains of several human skeletons. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know exactly what was going on in the skull building, but human and 
animal blood was abundant on the slab," Wood said. The occasional cutting up of 
humans and animals, for whatever reasons, may have taken place there, she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The grisly practice of human sacrifice is one possibility, but bodies may have 
been carted to the skull building after death and placed on the slab for some 
type of ritual before burial. The skeletal remains in the back of the building 
may have come from individuals placed on the slab, although there are no 
decapitation marks at the base of the skulls. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever purpose the skull building served, Loy's blood analysis demonstrates 
that people living in one of the world's earliest known farming villages had 
surprisingly complex cultural practices. This suggests that the village had 
existed for some time prior to 10,000 years ago, which in turn strengthens the 
notion that humans crossed the threshold from hunting and gathering to a 
farming life considerably earlier than many had believed. 
</P>
<P>
The process of studying ancient blood begins by locating dark patches of 
suspected blood with a low-power microscope. The samples are analyzed with a 
coated paper strip sensitive to hemoglobin in the blood. Confirmed blood 
deposits are scraped off and subjected to a chemical process that crystallizes 
hemoglobin. The size and shape of hemoglobin crystals differ among animal 
species, allowing researchers to identify what type of beast spilled the blood. 
To further check the results, hemoglobin is placed in a gel and exposed to an 
electric field; its molecules then line up in patterns that correspond to 
specific animal species. 
</P>
<P>
If the blood appears to be from a human being, it is tested for the presence of 
human immunoglobulin, which aids in the body's defense against disease. 
</P>
<P>
At Cayonu Tepesi, Loy and Wood isolated human and sheep blood on the stone 
slab, but were puzzled by the presence of another type of blood from an 
unknown, nonhuman species. They lifted blood from bone fragments of an extinct 
cattle species discovered at the site and found that its hemoglobin crystals 
matched those of the unknown species taken from the slab. This is the first 
time the blood of an extinct animal has been identified, Loy said. 
</P>
<P>
Further excavations in the skull building uncovered several skulls and horns 
belonging to the same extinct form of cattle. Loy and Wood also found a large 
flint knife containing traces of cattle and human blood. The knife may have 
been used in human sacrifices or mortuary rituals, but Loy noted that human 
blood often ends up on stone tools when toolmakers accidentally cut their 
fingers while adjusting an edge. 
</P>
<P>
Minute quantities of blood taken from the skull building's slab were also 
placed in a machine that separates and counts carbon atoms of different mass. 
The decay of specific carbon atoms in the samples allowed Loy and Wood to 
calculate that the blood is about 9,000 years old. Carbon dating is typically 
used with charcoal and is considered accurate back to about 50,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In another study, Loy found that blood can survive on stone for much longer 
than 9,000 years, or even 50,000 years. A stone tool from a site in Iraq that 
dates to between 75,000 and 125,000 years ago yielded human blood that Loy 
originally thought came from a Neanderthal. 
</P>
<P>
However, further analysis indicated that the hemoglobin crystals in the 
prehistoric blood were comparable to those of modern humans, Loy said. He 
acknowledged that it is unclear now which species left behind the blood on the 
stone tool. 
</P>
<P>
Neanderthals and modern humans inhabited the Near East at around the same time, 
but the bulkier Neanderthals became extinct around 35,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Many anthropologists contend that modern humans -- who are considered modern 
because of shared changes in the anatomy of the skull and lower body -- 
originated in Africa and rapidly spread throughout the world around 200,000 
years ago, driving Neanderthals to extinction in the process. Others argue that 
modern humans originated nearly 1 million years ago in several regions of the 
world and interbred to some extent with Neanderthals. 
</P>
<P>
One way to help resolve the debate is to study the genetic material, or DNA, of 
Neanderthals and modern humans for evidence of chemical similarities or 
differences, Loy said. He and his colleagues plan to extract and analyze DNA 
from the ancient Iraqi blood using the techniques of modern DNA fingerprinting, 
which rely on enzymes that chop up DNA into distinct patterns. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a method developed by British researchers to extract DNA from bone 
could enable scientists to compare the chemical makeup of DNA from Neanderthal 
and modern human fossils. Similarities would point to a shared genetic heritage 
between Neanderthals and ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
If such studies are conducted, confirmed samples of Neanderthal DNA can be 
compared to DNA taken from the Iraqi blood sample, Loy noted. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond disputes over human evolution, blood residue analysis also has the 
potential to clarify the history of specific diseases, according to Loy. The 
human body contains a library of antibodies formed to fend off particular 
illnesses. Those antibodies can be isolated from ancient blood samples and 
researchers can determine the ailments afflicting people who died thousands, or 
tens of thousands, of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Yet archeologists are not clamoring to conduct independent blood analyses and 
DNA studies on prehistoric stones and bones, Loy lamented, because they simply 
are not trained in the new techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the blood of Neanderthals and even earlier members of the human 
evolutionary family undoubtedly stains some of the millions of stone tools 
lying in the museums of the world. "There's a tremendous blood bank on ancient 
stone tools just waiting to be studied," Loy said.

The scratched teeth of an ancient stallion that died more than 6,000 years ago 
have provided the first "direct proof" that humans rode horses before the 
invention of the wheel, a scientist reported last week. A microscopic study of 
horse teeth buried about 4000 BC and discovered in what is now the Ukraine in 
the Soviet Union, revealed scratches from a mouth bit, indicating the horse had 
been ridden, said David Anthony of Hartwick College in Oneonta, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been previous speculation that horseback riding occurred this early. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first direct proof," said Anthony, an assistant professor of 
anthropology who presented his findings at the International Conference on 
Archaeozoology. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional view is that horseback riding developed between 2000 and 1500 
BC in the Ukraine. While there had been some archeological evidence that riding 
may have occurred earlier, there was no direct evidence, Anthony said. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony said he found markings on the ancient horse teeth that were identical 
to scratches and damage he had found on the teeth of modern horses from metal 
bits attached to reins used to ride them.

IN BRIEF: AIDS-LIKE VIRUS FOUND IN CHIMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and Wire reports

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists have found two chimpanzees infected with a virus very similar to the 
human AIDS virus, providing the most valuable clue yet in the search for the 
mysterious origin of the deadly disease. French researchers said they detected 
a virus resembling the human immunodeficiency virus or HIV in two wild, baby 
chimpanzees captured in Gabon, an African nation that straddles the Equator. 
</P>
<P>
Since the AIDS epidemic first surfaced in 1981, scientists have been puzzled by 
the origin of the deadly AIDS viruses. The new virus may prove to be a "missing 
link" between AIDS-like primate viruses and those that infect humans, a U.S. 
researcher said. 
</P>
<P>
The virus found in the Gabon chimps, which researchers suggest naming 
chimpanzee immunodeficiency virus or CIV, varies too much to simply be 
considered a strain of HIV-1, Simon Wain-Hobson of the Pasteur Institute and 
his colleagues reported in the journal Nature.

IN BRIEF: U.S. RESEARCHERS REPORT SUPERCONDUCTOR ADVANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and Wire reports

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American researchers have reported an advance in the commercial production of 
superconductors. Paul Chu and colleagues at the University of Houston reported 
in the journal Nature last week that they had developed a continuous process 
for bulk production of an yttrium-barium-copper oxide compound capable of 
carrying electricity without any resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Superconductors convey electricity far faster than other materials; if 
perfected, they could be used in ultrafast computers and magnetically powered 
high-speed trains and considerably cut the cost of power generation. 
</P>
<P>
It was long thought that superconductivity could only be achieved at 
temperatures far too cold for practical use, but four years ago scientists 
discovered ceramic compounds capable of superconductivity at far higher 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
Chu and his team said they had produced a bar 2 inches long, 0.19 of an inch 
wide and 0.12 of an inch thick that conducted electricity consistently, a 
difficult task when producing ceramic oxides in bulk. It is the first report 
that something more than a thin wire or grain of superconductor material has 
been produced. 
</P>
<P>
Although the bar produced by Chu and his team is too small for practical use, 
the researchers said that theoretically bars of any desired length could be 
made.

MELVIN DURSLAG: ANOTHER NOCTURNAL CREATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A formidable scholar on sleeping habits of the horse, we are able to comment 
with doctrinal authority on the recent granting by the California Horse Racing 
Board of four night dates this meeting to Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
The dates -- all Fridays -- were requested by the track when samplings showed 
that night cards on Friday drew between 30,000 and 40,000, contrasted to 12,000 
on Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't require excessive cogitation to conclude that night racing was better 
for business. 
</P>
<P>
But arranging these four nights at Hollywood Park wasn't easy, because a 
segment of trainer argued that nocturnal action disrupted the life style of the 
horses, not to mention their keepers. 
</P>
<P>
Horses, we were reminded, rise early, meaning that if they went to sleep at, 
say 11 p.m., they would be tired the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
"But of the 4,000 horses stabled at Hollywood Park," one interjects, "only 
about 80 would be going to bed later than usual." 
</P>
<P>
"You are a horse ignoramus," the interrogator is told. "When those 80 runners 
return to the stable after they race, they wake up others." 
</P>
<P>
"Why can't they come in quietly?" 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how quietly they try to come in," you are told, "the stable dog will 
hear them and start to bark." 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, when one dog barks in the neighborhood, all the dogs bark. 
</P>
<P>
A diligent researcher, we ask Laffit Pincay Jr. why horses get up so early. 
</P>
<P>
"They get up early only because people wake them," he responds. "You let them 
alone and they'll go on sleeping like the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
Mel Stute, who has trained horses for 44 years, agrees with Laffit. 
</P>
<P>
"At riding academies," says Mel, "horses often will sleep until 9. No one 
disturbs them." 
</P>
<P>
Same at police stables. If a demonstration is scheduled downtown at noon and it 
looks like a case for the mounted unit, the cops figure they won't need the 
horses until 10. So they let them sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"This business of getting horses up at dawn started long ago," Stute explains. 
"The horses had to be worked early so that the track could be cleared for the 
afternoon program. It was a slower process before, because the exercise boy not 
only worked the horse, but walked him. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, in this age of specialization, the exercise boy works the horse and 
turns him over to a hot-walker. We even have hot-walking machines that will 
accommodate four horses at the same time. So having only to work the horses, 
the exercise boy today can get a lot more done in less time, meaning there is 
no need to start so early." 
</P>
<P>
It is Stute's position that if night racing will help the industry, he isn't 
bothered over disrupting the schedule of a horse, who is just as adaptable as a 
person. One way or another, either will get his rest. 
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon of sleep has been a subject of study for centuries by medical 
scientists, who suspect that sleep in mammals results from chemical change 
related to fatigue of nerves and muscles. 
</P>
<P>
In Vienna, where we did our residency under the famed Dr. Labbermacher, 
laboratory experiments were conducted with horses whereby they were awakened in 
the middle of the night and taken to the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
In seven cases of nine, the horse returning to his bed fell asleep and woke up 
fresh, meaning it is doubtful that a horse disturbed by a stablemate coming in 
at night will be adversely affected. 
</P>
<P>
"Racing people fail to reckon with the adjustable nature of the horse," 
Labbermacher lectured. "At breeding farms, it is the custom to breed horses 
during the day. But if you bring the horses together at night, do you have any 
doubt they would breed?" 
</P>
<P>
"What if a dog who heard them started barking and woke up other horses?" 
</P>
<P>
"The stud would give him a sleeping tablet," Labbermacher answered. "The horse 
is resourceful. You have to laugh at men who describe the horse as a dumb 
beast. Have you ever seen a horse bet on a man?" 
</P>
<P>
"Neither day nor night," we reply. 
</P>
<P>
"The foulest of beverages is the mint julep," Labbermacher continues. "At the 
Derby, have you ever seen a horse drink one?" 
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the evidence, you are challenged by Labbermacher to decide who is the 
dumb beast.

Milwaukee Bucks' assistant coach Mike Dunleavy is the most likely choice to 
succeed Pat Riley as coach of the Lakers if Riley doesn't return next season. .

New Clipper Coach Mike Schuler may not have been wrong when he said he was 
taking the best of the available NBA jobs. There's virtually nowhere to go but 
up and the talent will be plentiful if Ron Harper returns to form and somebody 
else doesn't break a leg. . . .

<P>
The way the series is being played, you have to think that the Phoenix Suns are 
going to beat the Trail Blazers once in Portland and advance to the NBA finals.

Are the Dodgers this good -- or are the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals 
that bad? . . .

It's time for Tom Lasorda to give Chris Gwynn a spot in the everyday lineup or 
trade him for a relief pitcher. . . .

Mr. Team Man: Vince Coleman looked disgusted after he had a stolen base wiped 
out when it was ruled that Milt Thompson was hit by a pitched ball Sunday 
during the Dodgers' rout of the Cardinals. . . .

Max Venable should be known as Venerable. . . .

Philadelphia center fielder Lenny Dykstra, who broke up the no-hit bid of 
Atlanta's John Schmoltz Sunday, told Dodger broadcaster Ross Porter in a 
pregame interview recently that vitamins and weight work were responsible for 
his sizzling start. All the while, Dykstra was puffing on a cigarette. . . .

Hardly anybody else can hit Frank Viola this season, but Eric Yelding of the 
Houston Astros is six for six against him. . . .

Runs scored is the most underrated stat in baseball. . . .

ABC shouldn't expect a repeat Emmy for its Indy coverage. The telecast matched 
the race -- average, at best. . . .

We kept seeing Luyendyk race around the track the final few laps, but never saw 
where the second-place car was and how big the lead was. . . .

The way Mario Andretti's luck is at Indy, he should instead drive in the Grand

Why must they always give us the name of the pilot of the blimp? . . .

The two Australian track announcers, Michael Wrona and John Tapp, have been 
popular with the crowds at Hollywood Park over the holiday weekend. They're 
accurate and clever. My only complaint is that they jabber too much as the 
horses are being loaded into the gate. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Gedaliah Goodman will saddle longshot Santangelo in the Hollywood Turf

Dennis Rodman, Buck Williams, Joe Dumars and Michael Jordan -- are still

Big East commissioner Dave Gavitt will accept the Boston Celtic general

CHANG GOES FROM HIS FEAT ON CLAY AT PARIS IN '89 TO FEET OF CLAY IN '90

<TEXT>
<P>
Time and fame are passing quickly for Michael Chang, who arrives at the scene 
of his greatest victory playing the worst tennis of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Think this is good timing? 
</P>
<P>
"It's all been very frustrating," Chang said. "My confidence is clearly not at 
the highest." 
</P>
<P>
And, apparently, neither is his physical condition. Chang wore a bandage on his 
left wrist as he practiced Sunday after getting tendinitis in an exhibition 
last week in Marseilles. 
</P>
<P>
It was only one year ago that Chang's confidence was soaring as he sent shock 
waves rolling across the Seine and throughout the tennis world by winning the 
French Open. At 17, he became the youngest male player to win a Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
But it is a vulnerable champion who returns to the slow red clay of Stade 
Roland Garros today to begin defense of his French Open crown, which is looking 
pretty wobbly on his head. 
</P>
<P>
Since his French Open victory, Chang's ranking has dropped from No. 5 to No. 
14, a free-fall entirely attributed to a freakish injury during practice last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
As Chang sprinted to get a ball in the corner and planted his feet, he heard 
something crack. The injury was diagnosed as a bone separation in his hip. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to the Assn. of Tennis Professionals tour the last week of 
February, hoping for the best, but experiencing the worst. Chang has won only 
two matches and lost five. In four of the five tournaments Chang has played, he 
lost his first match. 
</P>
<P>
Chang moved on, searching for his game. He has not yet found it. 
</P>
<P>
At Munich, Chang lost his first-round match to Petr Korda of Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
"By Rome, I should be at the top of my game," Chang said in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't. Chang got a first-round bye in Hamburg, West Germany, but lost to 
Juan Aguilera of Spain in the second round, 6-3, 6-2. Then, two weeks ago at 
the Italian Open in Rome, Chang lost another first-round match, 6-3, 6-3, to 
Jan Gunnarsson of Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
As far as building up one's confidence, Chang's clay court tour was more like a 
demolition derby. What's more, he can't explain what's going wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"To be quite honest, I don't know what it is, but the balls just don't seem to 
go where I like them to," Chang said. "It happens to everyone. We all have 
different reasons, but I will not let this break me down. I am 18, I still have 
at least 10 years before me." 
</P>
<P>
At least Chang is here. Only 14 of the top 20 male players will compete, with 
No. 1-ranked Ivan Lendl leading an impressive list of no-shows. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, who is skipping his first Grand Slam event since the 1982 Australian 
Open, chose to work on his grass court game for Wimbledon. John McEnroe, Tim 
Mayotte and Pete Sampras withdrew because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Gilbert has played here only once in the last five years and that was in 
1987. Mats Wilander withdrew for personal reasons. His father died Friday night 
in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Stefan Edberg and Boris Becker, ranked No. 2 and No. 3, become the top two 
favorites to win this year with Italian Open champion Thomas Muster another 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Agassi is also mentioned as someone who has a chance, although Agassi has 
played only one tournament since he won the Lipton International Players 
Championship in late March. Agassi, who plays Martin Wostenholme of Canada 
today, must think he can hit the ground running: He didn't arrive until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Seeded 11th, Chang's first-round match is against Cassio Motta, a 30-year-old 
clay court veteran from Brazil. A victory would advance him to a potential 
fourth-round matchup with sixth-seeded Emilio Sanchez of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
But the way Chang has been playing seems to offer only a slight chance that 
Chang can make it even that far. Yet Chang has not given up hope of repeating 
what he did last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming back and winning Roland Garros is a matter of playing my best tennis," 
he said. "Last year, I probably played the best tennis in my life there. I will 
try my best. I want to be optimistic and think I will be able to do the same 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
How well Chang plays in his return to Roland Garros may hinge more on his match 
toughness than any lingering effects of his hip injury. Chang's physician, Dr. 
Lester Lee of Huntington Beach, said Chang's conditioning is a factor, but the 
hip is not. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis great Jack Kramer said that if Chang is physically fit again, there is 
reason to believe he can go far again this year. 
</P>
<P>
"He certainly has the style of game that is always going to give Becker and 
Edberg fits on that court," Kramer said. "His problems are with Mancini and 
Muster and real clay court players like that. But I sort of like his chances on 
that court." 
</P>
<P>
And one more thing, Kramer said. "He should be hungry as hell. He hasn't done 
anything in a while." 
</P>
<P>
Chang finished his practice match with Jean Fleurian. He was playing on the 
same Centre Court where he upset Lendl in the fourth round a year ago, where he 
defeated Edberg in the final. 
</P>
<P>
Chang said he still can scarcely believe what happened a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not many players who win Roland Garros at 17," Chang said. "It is 
one of those things that after you wonder if they really happened or if it 
wasn't one of those bedtime stories you tell the children before they go to 
sleep. I sometimes have that feeling when I look back." 
</P>
<P>
As far as his game, it's been one long slumber party for Chang so far this 
year. There have been no bedtime stories with happy endings. 
</P>
<P>
He might have chosen another time to defend his Grand Slam title, but he has no 
choice in the matter. Chang's days on clay are here again, ready or not.

A YEAR LATER, CHANG'S VICTORY STILL SEEMS MORE FANTASY THAN REALITY

Give Kirk Gibson his home run, the U.S. hockey team its gold medal and Jack 
Nicklaus his green jacket for Mastering the field against all odds in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But if you want to complete the collection of sport's most mind-bending, 
reality-rending storybook endings of the 1980s, give Michael Chang his due, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
A year has passed since Chang won the French Open men's tennis championship and 
reaction still hasn't caught up with the accomplishment. Maybe everyone's still 
trying to figure it out. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago in Paris, Chang went where no American had ventured in 35 years -- 
and might never visit again. Even if the footprints he left in the Roland 
Garros clay could be traced, it's doubtful they'll ever truly be duplicated. 
</P>
<P>
John McEnroe never won in Paris. Neither did Jimmy Connors or Arthur Ashe or 
Stan Smith or any other American male who tried between Tony Trabert's victory 
in 1955 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
And no one ever won it the way Chang did. 
</P>
<P>
He was 17 years old. 
</P>
<P>
He had been a professional for barely a year. 
</P>
<P>
He stood 5 feet 8 inches. 
</P>
<P>
He weighed 135 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
He nearly had to default because of leg cramps. 
</P>
<P>
He served underhanded. 
</P>
<P>
And won by upsetting, in order: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ivan Lendl, the world's No. 1-ranked player, in the round of 16. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Andre Chesnokov, in the semifinal, one round after Chesnokov eliminated the 
defending French Open champion, Mats Wilander. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stefan Edberg, the 1988 Wimbledon champion, in the final. 
</P>
<P>
Chang could call it a career right now and call it a good one. He could have 
stopped right after the Lendl victory -- a five-set classic that should have 
been a straight-set blowout. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl had everything going for him. Size. Strength. The experience of three 
previous French Open titles. The first two sets. 
</P>
<P>
Chang? 
</P>
<P>
He had leg cramps. 
</P>
<P>
Battling back from a two-set deficit took so much out of Chang -- and he had so 
little to start with. By the time he forced a fifth set, he was cramping so 
severely that it hurt to watch. He looked 17 going on 67, hobbling here, 
lurching there, trying to replenish himself with water and bananas during 
changeovers. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Chang was reduced to desperate tactics. Trying to buy time, he 
sprayed lobs and moonballs back at Lendl. Looking for any possible advantage, 
he whipped an underhanded serve at 4-3, 15-30 -- and the maneuver so unnerved 
Lendl, he failed to win another game. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at match point, with Lendl down to his second serve, Chang played his 
last card. Limping nearly halfway to the net, Chang stopped there and awaited 
Lendl's delivery. You wouldn't play a child this way, but Chang was scrambling 
for any edge, in or out of the book. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl went over the same edge. Flustered, he knocked his next serve into the 
net for a double fault, sending Chang to his knees and, then, to the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
How do you top that? Chang never has. But that's what made his French Open all 
the more remarkable. Three rounds of anticlimax still awaited him, but he never 
let down. Rather than settle for life as a fourth-round footnote, Chang came 
back to beat Ronald Agenor, Chesnokov and Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in 3 1/2 decades, an American landed in Paris. But did 
America notice? Maybe for a couple seconds, on the way to the baseball 
highlights. 
</P>
<P>
Chang didn't even make the cover of Sports Illustrated, unless you count the 
postage stamp-sized teaser in the upper left-hand corner. That week, America's 
weekly sporting journal put Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns on the cover -- 
and buried Chang inside behind reports on Game 3 of the NBA finals and the 
Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
If his victory wasn't the decade's most dramatic, it certainly was the most 
under-appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
In the year that followed, Chang never really cashed in the way he should have, 
which is one reason why Chang recently switched management companies. Now he 
can be seen in a handful of endorsements -- most notably, a TV commercial for 
Cathay Pacific Airlines -- which is more often than he's been seen in recent 
tennis tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Slowed by a freakish hip injury and a premature comeback, Chang has bailed in 
the first round of his last three tournaments. Today, he returns to Roland 
Garros the reigning champion -- and probably a longer shot than he was in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe there's a cosmic price to be paid for such moments in time. Maybe you 
lease your own luck. Look what happened to Jim Craig, the hero goaltender who 
orchestrated the Miracle on Ice. Look what happened to Kirk Gibson's knees. 
</P>
<P>
Greatness comes with risks attached. Take your day in the sun now, worry about 
the skin cancer later.

<P>
The way things started out for Minnesota's Kevin Tapani against Boston Sunday, 
it appeared that he wouldn't be pitching very long. 
</P>
<P>
Tapani opened the game by walking Wade Boggs and then giving up a double to 
Jody Reed. 
</P>
<P>
But he struck out three consecutive batters to get out of the inning after 
throwing 33 pitches, and then didn't allow a run until the eighth as the Twins 
beat the Red Sox, 3-1, at Minnesota for a three-game series sweep. 
</P>
<P>
"The first inning told the story of this game," Boston Manager Joe Morgan said. 
"We swung at a ton of high fastballs out of the strike zone, and that's how he 
got out of the inning." 
</P>
<P>
Tapani (6-3) said: "I wasn't out there trying to strike everybody out. I was 
trying to throw good pitches and get out of there with as little damage as I 
could." 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota's Dan Gladden showed the Red Sox how to do it. He hit the second 
pitch in the bottom of the first inning from rookie Dana Kiecker (0-2) some 407 
feet for his fourth home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Gladden also scored in the third inning when he singled with two outs, stole 
second and came home on a single by Al Newman. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Harper singled home the Twins' third run with two outs in the fourth 
after Kirby Puckett led off with his 15th double, tops in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox finally broke through in the eighth when Boggs led off with a 
double, continued to third on left fielder Gladden's error and scored on a 
single by Reed. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota last swept Boston in Minnesota on Aug. 23-25, 1983. The Twins, 
winners of four in a row, outscored Boston, 25-6, in the series, including 
Friday night's 16-0 rout. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 2, Detroit 1 -- The only really spacious part of Tiger Stadium worked 
against the home team as Cecil Fielder's 435-foot drive with the score tied 1-1 
was run down on the warning track in the sixth inning by White Sox center 
fielder Lance Johnson near a point where the fence is 440 feet from home plate. 
</P>
<P>
An inning later, Ron Kittle singled home the tie-breaking run following a 
two-out intentional walk to Carlton Fisk. 
</P>
<P>
Loser Jack Morris (2-7) had allowed just one hit going into the seventh -- a 
fifth-inning homer by Fisk -- but Robin Ventura singled to lead off the inning. 
Pinch-runner Rodney McCray stole second with one out and Dan Pasqua struck out. 
But Fisk was walked intentionally before Kittle spoiled the strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit took a 1-0 lead in the third inning on a controversial home run. Mike 
Heath hit a fly ball down the left-field line. Ivan Calderon leaped for it, but 
the ball hit the foul pole and bounced into the stands in foul territory for 
Heath's first home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox argued that the ball hit the pole below the top of the fence, 
which would have made it a ground-rule double. 
</P>
<P>
Fisk's homer was his 2,100th career hit. It also lifted him into a tie for 45th 
place on the all-time home-run list with Boog Powell at 339. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 6, New York 2 -- They still have the American League's worst 
record, but the Royals' spirits were up after their victory at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a good, solid team outing, the way we've thought we should be playing 
all year," said reliever Mark Davis, who struck out Jesse Barfield and Don 
Mattingly with the bases loaded in the eighth inning, although he then walked 
in a run. Jeff Montgomery was credit with the save. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Appier (1-0), given a chance to replace the ineffective Richard Dotson as 
the Royals' fifth starter, responded with seven innings of seven-hit pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Seitzer, who had only five RBIs in 165 at-bats, hit two doubles and a 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 9, Texas 2 -- Jeff Ballard, an 18-game winner last season, won for 
the first time this season as the Orioles prevailed at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard (1-5) yielded two runs and five hits over six innings as the Orioles 
swept a road series for the first time since last June 19-21 in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
It was Ballard's ninth start of the season and first victory since he beat 
Detroit last Sept. 20. The Orioles continued their mastery of the Rangers, 
having won 16 of the last 20 meetings. Texas has lost 19 of its last 26 games. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard was 8-1 after nine starts a year ago when the Orioles scored 55 runs in 
his first nine starts. This season they had scored 22 runs for Ballard in his 
previous eight starts. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 5, Seattle 1 -- Manny Lee, Junior Felix and Pat Borders homered 
enabling the Blue Jays to complete a sweep of the series at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth consecutive loss for the Mariners, who are 8-14 at the 
Kingdome, the worst home record in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Lee and Felix, Toronto's eighth and ninth-place hitters, hit back-to-back 
homers leading off the third inning against Randy Johnson (3-3). 
</P>
<P>
Borders homered after George Bell's infield single in the sixth, giving Toronto 
a 5-1 lead. It was the 12th homer yielded by Johnson, most in the majors.

</P>
<P>
EASTERN CONFERENCE: AFTER AN INJURY IN CAMP, HE HAS HAD TO WATCH DETROIT'S 
DRIVE FOR A SECOND NBA TITLE FROM THE PISTONS' BENCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rubber band around the wrist is symbolic of being a Detroit Piston reserve, 
not of the way his career is being held together. 
</P>
<P>
David Greenwood, who has been nothing but an everyday player since attending 
Verbum Dei High School and UCLA in the late 1970s, says he has two or three 
years left in the battered twine that passes for his Achilles' tendons. Whether 
it will be in Detroit, he can't say. Neither can the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
His everyday role now, when not practicing, is to sit on the end of the bench, 
often dreaming of playing. Gaze too far into that land of make-believe, though, 
and regret it. One of the other have-nots in the Pistons' eight-man rotation -- 
Scott Hastings, William Bedford and Gerald Henderson -- will make it a painful 
wakeup call to reality. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what the rubber bands are for," Greenwood explains. "It's something one 
of the guys came up with to keep us in the game. We have so many easy wins. 
It'll be like, 'Oh, well, we're up by 15.' You'll see Hastings' eyes start to 
wander around the crowd or something. One of us will reach over, grab the 
rubber band -- and pow!" 
</P>
<P>
Just one of the ways this season has been painful for Greenwood, who signed a 
one-year contract for a reported $600,000 just before training camp. 
</P>
<P>
After having averaged 72.3 games in his first 10 years in the NBA with Chicago, 
San Antonio and Denver, he made only 37 appearances in 1989-90, the fewest of 
any Piston on roster all season. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwood broke double-figure minutes five times. He may play in the summer pro 
league at Loyola Marymount for the first time, mostly against unknown players 
trying to earn a contract and rookies. Heading into Game 4 of the Eastern 
Conference finals against the Bulls today at Chicago Stadium, he has played 
twice in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Mentally, it has been difficult," said Greenwood, who lives in San Antonio but 
is considering a move back to Los Angeles with his wife and two children during 
the summer. "It's been difficult sitting and seeing the other guys play and 
seeing that I know I can do what is happening on the court. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't regret coming here. I thought it was a great choice when I signed, and 
I still do." 
</P>
<P>
There's the trade off, though: a very good chance at a championship ring. For 
that opportunity, next year can wait. 
</P>
<P>
"Most players will tell you that the greatest thing is winning a championship 
and stuff like that," he said. "But it would be even better if you're an 
integral part of all that. That's what means the most. I've had a wonderful 
time here, but I wish I could have contributed more to what has happened." 
</P>
<P>
What the 6-foot-9, 225-pounder has contributed, to be exact, is 60 points and 
78 rebounds. Brought in as a big-man replacement for Rick Mahorn, lost to 
Minnesota in the expansion draft after last season, he has been unable to crack 
the eight-man rotation, a hamstring injury during camp slowing his adaptation 
to the Pistons from the start. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Greenwood, who turned 33 Sunday, was clued in that Coach Chuck 
Daly has a reputation for spots being earned over time. 
</P>
<P>
"This team is built on loyalty," Greenwood said. "They like to go with the guys 
who've got them here. James Edwards told me he went through the same thing at 
first, but that it gets easier next year." 
</P>
<P>
If there is a next year in Detroit for the free-agent-to-be. There have been 
three operations on the left Achilles' tendon and two on his right to reach 
this point, crediting Los Angeles-based Dr. Tony Daly for much of his current 
improved condition. He hasn't come back from so much to spend the last years of 
the game using those ankles for nothing more than sock holders. 
</P>
<P>
"We know it's been tough on him," General Manager Jack McCloskey said. "But he 
has showed us a lot. If it were a different person, character-wise, they could 
have caused us a lot of trouble by complaining in a similar situation. David 
has got a great deal of character." 
</P>
<P>
Just not much playing time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a real pleasure to be here," Greenwood says. "I haven't achieved any 
personal goals, but I've had some wonderful times." 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dumb statement from a reporter to Dennis Rodman, whose Pistons lead the 
best-of-seven series, 2-1, after losing Saturday: "There doesn't seem to be a 
sense of panic around this team.". . . Game 5 will be Wednesday at Auburn 
Hills, Mich.

WITHOUT A CENT, STEPHENSON SINKS $200,000 PUTT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Jan Stephenson, within two holes of being shut out of the $450,000 purse, made 
a $200,000 putt for par on the 17th hole Sunday in the LPGA's inaugural Skins 
Game at Frisco, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
JoAnne Carner won $75,000 with a 25-foot birdie putt on the 11th hole. Under a 
format calling for prize money on each hole to be carried forward until there 
is a clear winner, the purse built by $25,000 on the 12th, and by $35,000 jumps 
over the next four. 
</P>
<P>
That sent Carner, Stephenson, Nancy Lopez and Betsy King to the tee on the 
140-yard, par-three 17th at the Stonebriar Country Club with $200,000 at stake. 
</P>
<P>
When Carner, Lopez and King all hit windblown six-iron shots into bunkers, the 
door was opened for Stephenson, who used a five iron to put the ball 12 feet 
from the pin. The other three players missed their par putts and Stephenson 
left her birdie chance nearly two feet short, but sank the putt for par. 
</P>
<P>
The 18th was halved, so they went to an extra hole, which Carner won with a 
15-foot birdie putt. It was worth $35,000 and made Carner the runner-up with 
$110,000. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez won $95,000 and King made $45,000 on Saturday, but both were blanked 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Douglass made a six-foot putt for par on the second playoff hole to defeat 
Gary Player in a $500,000 tournament at Malvern, Pa., for his sixth Senior Tour 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Douglass and Player finished at four-under-par 206 after 54 holes after being 
even since the 11th home of the final round. Player shot a one-under-par 69, 
while Douglass came in with a 70. 
</P>
<P>
After halving the first playoff hole, the 15th, Player drove into the trees, 
failed to reach the green on his approach and missed a difficult putt for a 
double bogey. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Charles (67) and Charles Coody (70) tied for third at 207, while George 
Archer shot a 68 for 208, one stroke ahead of Lee Trevino, who had a 71. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Levi made a four-foot birdie putt just before darkness threatened to halt 
play and won a $1-million tournament by one shot at Marietta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
Levi had a three-under-par 69 in the final round, which was delayed six hours 
by rain. Had he missed his final putt, there would have been a four-way playoff 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Winless since 1985, Levi had a 72-hole score of 275, 13 under par, one stroke 
ahead of Larry Mize (70), Keith Clearwater (72) and Nick Price (70). 
</P>
<P>
Levi, trailing Clearwater and Mize by two shots with six holes left, gained a 
share of the lead with birdies on Nos. 14 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Bradley had five birdies and shot a two-under-par 69 to beat Patty Sheehan 
by three shots in a $350,000 LPGA tournament at Corning, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley finished at 274, 10 under par, to gain her third victory of the season 
and 26th of her career. 
</P>
<P>
Sheehan shot a 68, while Alice Ritzman also shot a 68 to finish at 278. 
</P>
<P>
Jose-Maria Olazabal of Spain sank a 12-foot par putt on the 18th hole for a 
one-shot lead after three rounds of the European PGA Championship at Virginia 
Water, England. Olazabal finished with a 69 for 203 after 54 holes, one shot 
ahead of Mike Harwood of Australia, who had a 67.

EVOLUTION IS WINNER IN CALIFORNIA CUP

<P>
Bob Doughty's Evolution, second in the California Cup the past two years, 
outsailed Mitch Rouse's Taxi Dancer in a light-wind final race to claim the 
title in the 28th running of the event off Marina del Rey Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Evolution placed second in the 12-boat fleet behind Hal Ward's Cheval, steered 
by Robbie Haines, to finish with 13 1/2 points, with Taxi Dancer sixth in the 
race and second overall with 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
The California Yacht Club has staged the last six Cal Cups as fleet races for 
sleds, the ultralight 70-foot sloops built primarily for long-distance downwind 
races to Hawaii or Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
However, they also have generated tight competition in windward-leeward buoy 
races. 
</P>
<P>
Evolution, a Santa Cruz 70, used closed-course tactics to defeat Taxi Dancer, a 
Reichell-Pugh 68 that prefers stronger winds than it found through the 
three-day, five-race series. 
</P>
<P>
Despite light and shifty winds of four to six knots that delayed the start for 
1 1/2 hours, Taxi Dancer was second at the first windward mark of the 
three-lap, 12-mile course. 
</P>
<P>
But Doughty slipped Evolution past on the first downwind leg and was able to 
drive Taxi Dancer farther back by tacking on her wind on the upwind legs. 
Evolution won two of the five races, Taxi Dancer none. 
</P>
<P>
Former Cal Cup winners struggled. Kathmandu, the 1985 winner, was last in every 
race. Blondie (1986 and '88) was seventh with new owner Peter Tong, and Citius 
('87, as Citius) was ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The final standings: 1. Evolution, 13 1/2 points; 2. Taxi Dancer, 19; 3. Holua, 
19 1/2; 4. Chance, 21; 5. Grand Illusion, 22; 6. Cheval, 25; 7. Blondie, 30; 8. 
Pyewacket; 9. Ole, 46; 10. Drumbeat, 47; 11. Cheetah, 48; 12. Kathmandu, 60.

NEWSWIRE: DAVID GONZALES SHOT, BUT IN STABLE CONDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Gonzales of Houston, the World Boxing Council's sixth-ranked lightweight, 
was in stable condition Sunday after being shot in the back outside a lounge, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales, whose record is 23-1-1, was to fight Darryl Tyson of Ft. 
</P>
<P>
Worth June 11 for the North American Boxing Federation Championship. Tyson is 
ranked fourth in the world by the WBC. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Gonzales and an unidentified man fled after a companion, Miguel 
Angel Martinez, 25, was shot and killed outside the lounge about 1:30 a.m. 
Sunday. Gonzales was shot in the back and the other man was shot at, but not 
injured, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The three apparently had walked to the parking lot in back of the club, where 
two men confronted them, police said. One placed a small handgun on Martinez's 
chest and fired. Then the two left in a small white Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Police said a game of pool a week ago between some of the men at the lounge 
triggered the dispute. Police said Martinez was not involved in the game.

A record 20 challengers from 15 nations -- including newcomers Japan, Germany

Midnight Saturday was the deadline for submitting non-refundable challenge fees 
of $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
A 21st potential challenger, the Leningrad Yacht Club of the Soviet Union, 
asked for a 14-day extension of payment, likely to be granted. 
</P>
<P>
Another Soviet team, the Odessa Arcadia Yacht Racing Club, sent its money, as 
did Deutscher America's Cup Verein -- originally representing West Germany, but 
now requesting to be known under the unified designation of Germany.

Australian businessman Alan Bond, who won the Cup in 1983, filed an entry 
through the Royal Perth Yacht Club, but his recent financial reversals left his 
ultimate participation questionable.

The San Diego Yacht Club also will conduct trials to select an American

San Diego and Buddy Melges of Wisconsin have indicated they will compete. RICH

EASY GOER EARLY FAVORITE TO BEAT HOUSEBUSTER TODAY

<P>
Easy Goer will take on upstart Housebuster today in the $500,000 Metropolitan 
Handicap at Belmont Park, the first race in New York's handicap triple. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer, last year's Belmont Stakes winner and a narrow loser in the Kentucky 
Derby and Preakness to Sunday Silence, made his first start as a 4-year-old May 
16 with a 7 1/2-length victory in the seven-furlong Gold Stage Stake at 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
In the mile Metropolitan, Easy Goer will carry 127 pounds, while Housebuster, 
winner of eight in a row at a mile or shorter, will carry only 113 pounds 
because he is a 3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
"At some time, we have to be more aggressive, and we might have to be in the 
Met," said Shug McGaughey, Easy Goer's trainer. "If nobody is going to take the 
race to Housebuster, then we might have to. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing that concerns me is the strategy if Housebuster was to get 
loose getting 14 pounds. But Idabel has got speed, and I would think that one 
of the Lukas horses would try to not let him get loose." 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Wayne Lukas will saddle two horses in the Met -- Pimlico Special winner 
Criminal Type and Dancing Pretense. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer, who will be ridden by Pat Day, was the early 3-5 favorite, while 
Housebuster, with Craig Perret, was 3-1.

Twenty-one Memorial Days have gone by since Barbara Birchim's husband, Army 
Capt. James Birchim of the Green Berets, was listed as Missing in Action in 
South Vietnam. But she still lives life in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
She knows this much about Nov. 15, 1968, the last day he was seen alive: "They 
were going on a reconnaissance, to help extract some men who had gotten 
surrounded by the enemy. It was in Laos." Birchim and another man were being 
lifted out, suspended below a helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, she only knows what the other man has told her, that "at some 
point between Point A and Point B, Jim dropped off. It was at night. It was 
raining." Cut by ropes, he was unable to hang on. No one knows just where the 
helicopter was, or at what altitude. 
</P>
<P>
Birchim was at her parents' home in San Francisco when two officers appeared at 
the door that November day 22 years ago to tell her that her husband was MIA. 
</P>
<P>
About the time he was declared missing, she received a letter from him. "He 
told me he was working with the Montagnards and how much he enjoyed that. He 
had even suggested adopting a Montagnard baby." She was pregnant with David, 
now 21. Their daughter, Kim, was 6 months old. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Birchim doesn't quite believe her husband is alive, but she isn't sure 
he's dead, either. "I think it's very possible he's wandering around not 
knowing where he is." 
</P>
<P>
With no solid evidence, the Army in May, 1971, changed James Birchim's status 
from MIA to "killed in action, body not recovered." In August of that year, she 
married another Army officer. 
</P>
<P>
The marriage ended in divorce 11 years later. Now 43, she lives in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Birchim belongs to the National League of Families of American Prisoners and 
Missing in Southeast Asia, which seeks information on 2,303 Americans missing 
or unaccounted for in the region. Independently, she has made two trips to 
Vietnam, the last in March. 
</P>
<P>
"When Jim first turned up missing, I made a promise to him and myself that I 
would go to Vietnam when the kids were old enough to be self-sufficient," she 
said. The responses of villagers there to her questions convinced her that 
"there are Americans there." 
</P>
<P>
She is critical of the U.S. government for what she views as inaction and the 
withholding of information. She went to Vietnam, she said, partially because 
she had to explode the "mystique" of Vietnam. "Now, a lot of the mystery is 
gone and there's comfort in that." 
</P>
<P>
In the last 18 months, she said, "there have been rumors that there are five to 
seven Green Berets living in the mountains in the Kontum area (near where 
Birchim's base camp was) with the Montagnard people." She believes Jim Birchim 
could be one of them. 
</P>
<P>
She poses the possibility, too, that Americans are being held by "some little 
militant faction that thinks they're still at war with us." If Jim Birchim is 
alive, she believes, he is being held against his will. 
</P>
<P>
If he is alive, he is 43 now. Barbara Birchim accepts the possibility that he 
could be leading another life there. "We've heard stories about men forced to 
work in the fields, and part of their pay is they give them Vietnamese wives." 
</P>
<P>
But she is adamant that the men and women still in Southeast Asia "have the 
right to come home" and that their government should be fighting harder for 
that right. BEVERLY BEYETTE

Tony Lam is a Buddhist from Vietnam, but Memorial Day has become an important 
tradition since his arrival in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Westminster businessman honors the memory of Robert Burns, the man Lam, 53, 
calls "my best friend for 25 years." 
</P>
<P>
Burns was Lam's administrator during the early 1970s when Lam was in charge of 
stevedoring at the U.S. military installation at Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Burns was also one of the Americans who sponsored Lam and his family when they 
fled Saigon during the turbulent days of April, 1975, when the North Vietnamese 
Army was laying siege to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Every Memorial Day, Lam also remembers Robert Shidler, a retired Army colonel 
who died last year in Hawaii. Shidler, said Lam, was in charge of the Army 
Transportation Command at Cam Ranh Bay; he also agreed to sponsor the Lam 
family in their efforts to come to America. Lam flew to Hawaii to deliver 
Shidler's eulogy. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the kind of person who was deeply rooted in me," said Lam. 
</P>
<P>
Several of Lam's relatives died in combat in Vietnam, and he remembers them and 
others who fought in that war as "valiant people who fought for freedom." 
</P>
<P>
When he looks at the new life he and his family have made in Westminster -- a 
successful restaurant and college educations for his six children -- he 
remembers specifically the old friends who helped them attain it. 
</P>
<P>
"It really makes me feel that I have the obligation to think of them," said 
Lam, "to be grateful that I'm here and safe and happy with my family." PATRICK

THE ONE WHO DIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 28 years of service to the military, retired Navy Cmdr. Lloyd (Pete) Bucher 
knew scores of men, many of whom died in the line of duty, many of whom would 
spend the rest of their lives coping with a wound or injury. 
</P>
<P>
Bucher fought in World War II, in Korea and in Vietnam, and he knew many men 
for whom the lasting scar of battle was the terror that war leaves in the mind. 
</P>
<P>
But in the idle moments that come when he's at home, in the San Diego suburb of 
Poway, or sitting at an easel -- Bucher these days is a painter -- he thinks 
mostly of one man. 
</P>
<P>
And on Memorial Day, his thoughts are riveted to that man: Duane Hodges, the 
only one of 83 crewmen to have died on the spy ship Pueblo. 
</P>
<P>
Hodges died when the ship was shelled by North Koreans on Jan. 23, 1968. The 
Pueblo, armed with two machine guns, offered little resistance. Bucher ordered 
crewmen to destroy secret documents. Four were injured; only Hodges died. After 
their capture, Bucher and 82 survivors were held hostage for 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
A court-martial was considered at one time for Bucher, who always maintained 
that his confession was forced and that the ship was in international waters at 
the time it was seized. 
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Bucher and the Pueblo crew received POW commendations. It 
took an act of Congress and 22 years to get them. (Long before, Hodges had been 
awarded a posthumous Silver Star.) 
</P>
<P>
"He was carrying out my orders to destroy classified information when he was 
killed," Bucher said with a sigh. "He was throwing classified information over 
the side of the ship. He was hit by cannon fire. . . . He died a few minutes 
later. Others were hit, but he was the only one . . . who was killed." 
</P>
<P>
Bucher, 62, said he's never felt guilt for what happened to Hodges, a man in 
his early 20s from a small town in Oregon. It's more a sense of "grief, 
sadness, fear," he said. "It could have happened to any one of us, or more than 
one of us. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time Memorial Day comes around, I think not just of Duane and what he 
did for his country, but for all of the people who have died and been wounded 
and otherwise incapacitated in the service of our country. I think particularly 
of those who have died in times of conflict, whose deaths have ramifications 
for the preservation of freedom and the extension of that freedom to millions 
of others less fortunate." MICHAEL GRANBERRY

A 'PREPOSTEROUS PLOT' PROVIDES A UNIQUE LOOK AT A MAD, MAD WORLD; 
</P>
<P>
WAITING FOR RAIN BY INDIANA NELSON RANDOM HOUSE $18.95, 370 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
You have to approach "Waiting for Rain" with a few caveats: On its (pretty) 
face, it's preposterous. The plot is plain preposterous! And although there are 
fistfuls of characters -- all of them intriguing -- some of them, some of the 
time, tend to speak in the same voice, especially when they get to talking 
about lofty subjects -- such as the meaning of life. Finally, some of these 
characters tend to change in mid-stream: A girl portrayed at the beginning of 
this narrative as a victim turns out later to be a first-class villain. A 
money-grubbing harridan in fictional present-time performs, in flashback, an 
act that surely qualifies her for heroine status. So the novel isn't perfect. 
</P>
<P>
But what a kick it is! Here's a little patch of the plot: Back in 1955, an 
Arizona rancher named Horace McAllister attends a fur coat fashion show in 
Manhattan. He lays eyes on a nameless model in her mid-teens who wears, under 
her coat, pinned to her basic black cocktail dress, "a pave diamond peacock 
with a luxurious fanning tail of emeralds, sapphires and diamonds." 
</P>
<P>
A half-hour or so later, Horace, out of his mind with lust, rapes this girl. An 
hour or so after that, he kills himself out of remorse. He leaves behind a 
14-year-old daughter named Jewell, out in Dragoon, Ariz., whose mother 
immediately deserts her, and who will be sent to New York to live with her 
crass and unattractive aunt, Nanine, who is married to the wealthy and quietly 
desperate Dinwiddie Brown, who, since he is related by marriage to those 
Arizona McAllisters, goes to see Magda, that model of furs, gets her out of 
jail, pays for the missing peacock (on loan from Cartier), and falls madly in 
love with this mystery woman -- even though she's 17, and he's 59. Meanwhile, 
in the Manhattan mansion, Jewell, 14, has met her cousin Johnnie, 9, and they 
immediately become soul mates, destined to be together forever. 
</P>
<P>
The themes here are: Eastern vs. Western wealth; the relative importance of 
being rich, being loved, or being "visible" in this context; knowing what your 
true identity in the world is. But all this takes a back seat to the author's 
own voice -- intrusive, whacked out, opinionated, musical, infuriating. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Dinwiddie, peering at Nanine, his crabby wife, sees "a plethora 
of disgusting jars and bottles, creams and sinister unguents on his wife's 
dressing table -- some with the caps left off, he had to look away; and oozing 
out from the closet and across the floor, a spill of lingerie, discarded shoes, 
a girdle dragged off, the stockings still attached, and other nasty souvenirs 
no decent man should ever have to confront." 
</P>
<P>
Much, much later, when Jewell is 39 and Johnnie is 34 and Magda is in another, 
far more mysterious context, the whole cast of characters repairs to Venice, 
Italy, for 100 or so pages, and the author again goes hog wild. 
</P>
<P>
Jewell checks out the view: "The enchanted abyss between sea and sky -- the 
Basin of San Marco, where for those who want there might be a soft dancing in 
the basin, a rosy simulacrum of wavering towers, of drowsy lions and amethyst 
lamps, a listless swaying in the morbid heat of boats and palaces. 
</P>
<P>
And then, sliding out silently from behind the Salute and the golden Dogana, 
there comes a vast ship emerging from Giudecca like some horrendous mirage, a 
sluggish beast dragging herself into the basin to be swallowed down by the 
lagoon beyond." 
</P>
<P>
Although the thrust of the novel is mystical, the beauty of it obviously lies 
in its mad descriptions of the physical world: Children drowsy with lust just 
on the threshold of having sex, green Eastern lawns sloping down to the choppy 
Atlantic, marshlands on unknown islands out in the Adriatic, cowboys riding the 
ranch in hot Tucson mornings. 
</P>
<P>
The characters fall in and out of love and in again; that diamond peacock 
changes owners faster than a volleyball in the summertime on our own Manhattan 
Beach. But the great stuff here is the author's voice. 
</P>
<P>
Although Indiana Nelson allegedly spurns the world (the epigraph here is from 
the Bhagavad Gita), it's clear she loves the artifacts of our physical 
existence. 
</P>
<P>
She's a mad goddess of the concrete manifestation. The book is unique -- and 
that's a compliment.

American Medical Sues Over Sale: American Medical International Inc. filed a 
breach-of-contract suit Wednesday, seeking $900,000 plus interest after the 
sale of a hospital fell through last year. The case says Jesse J. Umali agreed 
to buy Glendora Community Hospital from a subsidiary of Beverly Hills-based 
American Medical last October for $8.5 million. Damages plus 12% interest are 
sought because Umali failed to make payments on time, the suit says. The 
hospital eventually was sold to another buyer. (Filed May 23, 1990. Case No.

Pension Insurance Fund Loses Court Round: The federal pension insurance fund's 
$2.2-billion claim against Dallas-based LTV Corp. should be reduced, according 
to a ruling by a federal judge in New York who also rejected an effort by the 
fund, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., to push its claim ahead of others in 
the company's bankruptcy case. The decision could cost the PBGC more than $1 
billion if the agency also loses a related case before the U.S. Supreme Court.

Visitors Bureau Sued Over Firing: The former president of the Los Angeles 
Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau filed a breach-of-contract suit Tuesday, 
claiming that the organization defrauded him when he was fired in September, 
1989. The Los Angeles Superior Court case by Bill F. Miller says the bureau and 
its chairman, John F. Llewellyn, did not point out that his employment contract 
was automatically renewed on a yearly basis when he signed an amendment that 
turned out to waive that right. Miller seeks damages of more than $200,000 plus 
punitives and seven months of his $130,000-per-year salary as severance. (Filed

and hardtop models. The auto maker said it is also recalling the 1985 and 1986 
front-wheel-drive hatchback models.

Orders for machine tools, used to make most manufactured goods from sewing 
machines to weaponry, rose 8.9% to $289.45 million in April from March levels 
as recession fears abated, the Assn. for Manufacturing Technology said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
April was the second-straight month that tool orders increased and reversed a 
decline that began in September, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The April total represented a rise of 19.3% from year-ago levels. 
</P>
<P>
But the increase was primarily because of a large foreign order placed with 
Cross &amp; Trecker Corp., a large machine tools and accessories company based 
in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
In its monthly report, the trade association for the machine tool industry said 
April tool shipments dropped 10.6% from a year ago to $258.20 million but were 
up 3.5% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign orders totaled $24.55 million in April, a 67.8% drop from the $76.30 
million reported in March. 
</P>
<P>
"The writing is on the wall; to stay competitive, U.S. manufacturers must 
invest in the most modern equipment that they can afford," said Albert Moore, 
president of the association. 
</P>
<P>
Total orders for metal-forming tools rose 22.1% last month to $82.60 million 
from March's $67.65 million total.

'Dick Tracy' Extra Sues Walt Disney: An actress on Wednesday sued the Walt 
Disney Co., actor Warren Beatty and his Mulholland Productions Inc., claiming 
that she was injured on the "Dick Tracy" set when she was asked to "violently 
throw herself to the ground repeatedly." The Los Angeles Superior Court suit 
says Victoria Taft was working as an extra when she was asked to perform 
"footfalls," which are usually done by trained stunt artists. (Filed May 23, 
1990. Case No. EC000266)

WALL ST. UNFAZED BY LATEST TOBACCO FLAP 
</P>

Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. reacted quickly last week to news that two 
universities were dumping their tobacco investments and the nation's top health 
official was declaring war on cigarette vending machines. 
</P>
<P>
The investment firm issued an enthusiastic "buy" recommendation for tobacco 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
"This publicity only hurts the stocks temporarily, and it has very little 
effect on earnings or sales," said Roy D. Burry, tobacco analyst for Kidder, in 
a comment echoed by other Wall Street stock pickers. "So it offers investors a 
real chance to increase returns." 
</P>
<P>
But if many on Wall Street played down the damage and talked up the industry's 
impressive earnings growth, anti-smoking partisans predicted that the news 
would contribute to the troubled image that has made tobacco stocks cheap for 
some time. They say the movement will ultimately take its toll on the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Money managers are going to wonder before they buy a tobacco stock, 'Is this 
going to some day embarrass my client?' " predicted Rick Krevor, executive 
director of the Tobacco Divestment Project, in Boston. "And the companies are 
going to face increasing economic isolation." 
</P>
<P>
Tobacco stocks stumbled when Harvard University and City University of New York 
said last Wednesday that they would sell all tobacco stocks amid predictions 
that other institutions may come under increased pressure to do the same. The 
same day, Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of Health and Human Services, let it be 
known that he would ask states to ban cigarette vending machines to limit 
tobacco sales to youth. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris, the market leader, was off $1 a share to $44.125 on heavy volume 
Thursday and fell $1.625 to $42.50 on Friday, again on heavy volume. Other 
companies with tobacco interests, such as American Brands, UST and Loews, were 
also off Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street analysts acknowledge that tobacco's image problems have been a drag 
on tobacco shares for some time. 
</P>
<P>
Although cigarettes are one of the world's most profitable commodities -- with 
operating profit margins of nearly 40% in some cases -- even the best stocks 
trade at only about 11 times annual earnings. That compares to about 13.5 times 
earnings for all stocks in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index. 
</P>
<P>
The discounted prices are due to tobacco's image problems, fears of litigation 
over health claims and worries about the declining unit sales of cigarettes in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts are skeptical that the threat of further divestments or 
Sullivan's initiative will do much harm to the industry's financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the institutions that would be nervous about them have already dumped 
them," said Allan Kaplan, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. "This is old news to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
But Krevor insisted that officials of many institutions aren't even aware that 
their pension trustees hold the stocks in their portfolios. Even the American 
Medical Assn. was unaware for many years that it held tobacco shares as 
investments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-smoking activists believe that not only universities but government 
pension funds, hospitals, mutual insurance companies and other institutions 
will be highly vulnerable to the kind of public pressure they can bring. 
</P>
<P>
Kidder's Burry said he doubted that Sullivan's plea to the states would find a 
receptive audience. Restaurants, hotels and other businesses profit handsomely 
from vending machine sales, he said, and such a ban would also seriously harm 
vending machine companies. "This could mean real economic damage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if a large number of states approved such a ban, it would do little damage 
to tobacco company sales, analysts predicted, because only about 3% of 
cigarette sales are through machines. (An estimated 16% of sales from vending 
machines are to minors, said Kaplan.) 
</P>
<P>
And if the machines were banned, a large portion of the sales would probably be 
simply displaced to supermarkets and other stores, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's news was part of a spate of bad publicity for tobacco. Protests 
from Sullivan and civil rights groups about RJR Nabisco's plans earlier this 
year to target "Uptown" cigarettes to blacks forced the company to cancel the 
brand. Then word leaked that RJR planned to market a "Dakota" cigarette to 
young blue-collar women, again drawing complaints. RJR said the cigarettes were 
not targeted exclusively to young women. 
</P>
<P>
Yet analysts are hopeful. U.S. unit sales are falling, but price hikes have 
kept U.S. revenue growth at about 8% a year, says Kaplan. Overseas, unit growth 
is continuing, and U.S. tobacco companies are seizing market share. 
</P>
<P>
Those trends mean higher earnings and stock prices for industry leaders. Philip 
Morris, now increasing profits more than 20% a year, was the best-performing 
stock of the 30 Dow Jones industrials in the 1980s. Its shares grew 825% in 10 
years, versus 228% for the Dow index.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'STALIN': SETTING STAGE FOR THIS WEEK'S SUMMIT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
This week's Bush-Gorbachev summit will unite two of the best TV smilers in the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has proved that he is better even than Ronald Reagan at 
finessing the camera and massaging the media on a personal level, inevitably 
managing to dodge tough questions and dart from danger through an inky cloud of 
bright little quips. If he continues this way, Bush will go down in history as 
the laughing-gas President. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, too, has demonstrated his prowess with 
the Western press, again and again wearing his telegenic charm on a beaming 
face that can make you melt. 
</P>
<P>
The show -- which also brings together First Ladies Barbara Bush and Raisa 
Gorbachev -- starts Wednesday in Washington after TV coverage of the Soviet 
entourage's scheduled late-afternoon arrival at Andrews Air Force Base. A 
chummy little group. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the smiles, though, is history. 
</P>
<P>
What better way to approach this summit than to dig for some roots. You find 
them -- gnarled and ugly -- in the three-part PBS documentary "Stalin," 
premiering at 9 tonight on Channels 28 and 15 (and at 10 p.m. on Channel 24). 
</P>
<P>
Scholars will have to judge whether fresh insights are contained in these 
fascinating one-hour programs from Britain's Thames Television. Probably not. 
Nevertheless, they comprise a simply terrific TV survey, essential for knowing 
the underpinnings of today's Soviet Union and the sources of the economic ruin 
that summoned Gorbachev to center stage. 
</P>
<P>
Through remarkable old footage and chats with Stalin's daughter and other 
relatives and associates of past Soviet leaders, executive producer Phillip 
Whitehead and his co-filmmakers Jonathan Lewis and Tony Cash weave a memorable 
narrative that vividly shows how some epic figures, through luck and sheer 
force of personality, become the living exclamation points of their time. 
</P>
<P>
For better or -- in the case of the beastly Stalin -- for worse. 
</P>
<P>
The opening hour relives the swift rise of Stalin and other revolutionaries 
from the rubble of the fallen Czarist monarchy. We watch him ruthlessly 
undermine his political rivals by manipulating the political machine after 
Lenin's death in 1924. As a politician, his brilliance was unquestionable, but 
it was brilliance in the cause of evil. 
</P>
<P>
The concluding hour is essentially the post-World War II Stalin. On the one 
hand, he is the leader of a nation that suffered horribly while resisting the 
Nazi onslaught with almost inhuman courage. On the other, he is still the same 
sociopath, one whose murderous ways will be aborted only through his own death 
in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
It is next Monday's middle hour that is most seductive. You're seeing a 
disaster, and you're instinctively attracted to it as you would be to a 
building collapsing in flames. Here in full force is Stalin's revolution of 
terror. We see forced collectivization, the destruction of the peasant class 
accompanied by lethal famine, the perpetuation of a system that stifles 
innovation and decays from within. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly it's 1936. Narrator: "The truth was, the system wasn't working." 
</P>
<P>
Nor, in a rational sense, was its champion. One of his former comrades recalls 
seeing in Stalin "the angry, inhuman eyes of a predator." 
</P>
<P>
Given Stalin's grisly record, it was no wonder that after World War II Nazi war 
criminals would scoff at having Soviets sit in judgment of them at the 
Nuremberg trials. The Soviet Union had its own holocaust under Stalin, for no 
one there, young or old, high or low, was beyond the grip of his terror. 
</P>
<P>
If body counts are the measure of evil, then clearly the pathological Stalin 
out-Hitlered Hitler: He turned the forests into killing fields, instigated mass 
purges whose victims were often chosen arbitrarily. He had ordinary citizens 
locked away in prisons and camps, where they languished for lifetimes without 
being told their alleged crimes. 
</P>
<P>
They were tortured and left to grow old and wither before their time. One of 
Stalin's victims recalls being in a room with other relatively young prisoners 
where there was also a mirror. She looked into the mirror, but could not find 
herself. "All of a sudden I saw my mother, her eyes and her gray hair, and I 
realized it was me." 
</P>
<P>
The terrible irony of this is that amid the chaos and uncertainty of 
Gorbachevism there are still some Soviets who yearn for a return to Stalinism. 
You see them interviewed from time to time on television, and they get their 
say in this documentary. What does it all mean? 
</P>
<P>
Observes Soviet writer Lev Kopelev: "Stalinism is still alive in all kinds of 
ways, in our psychology, in our habits and, until such time as Stalinism is 
annihilated . . . by rational re-education of the people . . . there is no 
guarantee of the existence of the human race." 
</P>
<P>
The frown preceding the smiles.

THE BATTLE OVER CLOSED-CAPTIONING; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: EDUCATION GROUPS SUPPORT LEGISLATION TO AID THE HEARING-IMPAIRED, 
BUT THE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY OPPOSES IT AS A 'REGRESSIVE TAX.'

<P>
Legislation that would make closed-captioning technology a required part of 
most new televisions sold in America is winning support in and out of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
That's good news for the estimated 24 million deaf or hearing-impaired U.S. 
citizens, who now must rely on costly closed-caption decoding devices or, as is 
more common, view their favorite programs hearing only muted mumbles or nothing 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
Installing decoding circuitry would allow television sets to display captions 
without separate decoders. The bill calls for closed-caption decoding chips to 
be installed in all new TVs sold in the United States with 13-inch screens or 
larger, beginning Oct. 15. That is the minimum recommended size for viewers to 
read closed captions, which run along the bottom of the screen in the manner of 
a subtitled foreign film. 
</P>
<P>
But the electronics industry is fighting the legislation with a "read my lips" 
rationale, arguing that the bill's mandatory standard for all TVs would impose 
a "regressive excise tax" on everyone who wants to buy a television. 
</P>
<P>
The measure comes at a time when the Bush Administration and Congress are 
acting on several fronts to increase rights and access for disabled Americans. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered sweeping redesign of 
future commercial airliners to make it easier for handicapped people to fly. 
Last Tuesday, the House approved landmark civil-rights legislation aimed in 
part at gaining disabled Americans equal access to jobs, public transportation 
and restaurant service. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, however, disabled activists' calls for built-in decoders as standard 
TV technology have largely been ignored. 
</P>
<P>
In the closed-caption technology, first marketed to consumers in 1980, the 
subtitles are contained in a portion of the television signal that does not 
appear on the TV screen unless called up by a special decoding device. The most 
recent model of decoder, the TeleCaption 4000, retails for about $175 and can 
be purchased by telephone via the AT&amp;T Special Needs Center, or at Sears, 
J.C. Penney, Highland Superstores and other chains. 
</P>
<P>
But due to a combination of limited availability, spotty marketing and cost, 
the National Captioning Institute estimates that only about 300,000 of the 
machines have been sold in the last 10 years, with a roughly estimated 
viewership of 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
This suggests that only about 1 in 25 deaf or hearing-impaired people is now 
able to watch closed-captioned shows -- not much market incentive for networks 
and local affiliates to increase the hours in which they provide closed-caption 
broadcasts, the bill's advocates contend. 
</P>
<P>
"The audience for captioned programs must be enlarged," said Rep. Edward Markey 
(D-Mass.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's 
telecommunications subcommittee. He called the bill, introduced earlier this 
month by Rep. Major Owens (D-N.Y.), "an essential tool for increasing the use 
of captioning." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), the Senate sponsor of the measure, is expected to 
push for its endorsement in a June 20 Commerce Committee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The legislative mandate would come with a price tag, although each side of the 
debate offers different figures. Some proponents contend that the built-in 
decoding equipment might boost costs only $3 to $5 per TV set; the bill's most 
vocal opponent, the Washington-based Electronic Industries Assn., asserts that 
prices could rise by as much as $20 per set. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of how much it might be, the electronics group objects to any cost 
hike applied across the board to all citizens. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony this month before Markey's subcommittee, the EIA's vice president 
for its consumer electronics group, Thomas P. Friel, argued that while existing 
closed-caption decoders are too expensive, forcing everyone to pay for 
standardized in-set decoding chips is not fair. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not . . . believe it is fair to impose what amounts to a regressive 
excise tax on all purchasers of television sets in order to benefit a small, 
albeit deserving, minority," Friel told congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
Friel said the potential impact of the legislation is being exaggerated because 
those people who now can't afford decoder boxes certainly couldn't afford new 
TVs. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel very strongly that we should try to help the hearing-impaired, but 
raising the cost of all televisions sets is not the answer," said Cynthia 
Upson, EIA's director of communications. "This is unprecedented legislation to 
have this cost mandated to every television user. This country is based on 
letting consumers have choices." 
</P>
<P>
For the deaf community, "choice" is the central issue as well. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a mere luxury feature for deaf Americans," Larry Goldberg, 
director of the Caption Center at PBS affiliate WGBH in Boston, said. "Right 
now they have no options about how they can enjoy television. 
</P>
<P>
"Captions are there, through at least 390 hours of broadcast, cable and home 
videos each week," said Goldberg, whose nonprofit group is the second-largest 
supplier of captioning services to network programs in the nation. "Television 
manufacturers wouldn't think of making TVs that are, say, unable to receive 
Channel 2 or Channel 4, and yet they feel comfortable manufacturing TVs that 
are unable to receive . . . closed-captioning information." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the legislation -- who include the National Parent Teachers 
Assn., International Reading Assn., National Education Assn. and American Assn. 
of Retired Persons -- foresee benefits from standardized closed-captioning 
beyond its service to the deaf. 
</P>
<P>
Sy DuBow, legal director of the National Assn. of the Deaf Legal Defense Fund, 
points out that captioned programs can aid people trying to improve English 
reading skills -- whether they are among the estimated 27 million adult 
Americans with literacy problems, the millions of immigrants learning English 
as a second language, or children learning to read. 
</P>
<P>
"Studies have shown that closed captioning has improved literacy skills," DuBow 
said. "It doesn't matter if you're 4 or 40: It can help."

"Parallels &amp; Contrasts: Photographs From the Stephen White Collection," at 
the Museum of Photographic Arts, is making its last American stand. After the 
exhibition closes on July 8, the 124 photographs in the traveling show will go 
to their new home at the Tokyo Fuji Art Museum, along with about 15,000 other 
items in the collection. 
</P>
<P>
White sold his collection to the Japanese museum in February for an undisclosed 
sum. News of the sale, reportedly in the low millions, put a spotlight on a 
collection that had grown up quietly and gained little public recognition. 
White, who began collecting in the early '70s, has operated a gallery in Los 
Angeles since 1975, presenting dozens of important exhibitions of vintage 
photography, but the photographs he loves have been difficult to sell to his 
audience. More often than not, he squirreled away unmarketable treasures in his 
personal collection. 
</P>
<P>
When officials of the Tokyo Fuji Art Museum decided to set up a center to 
illuminate both the art and science of photography, they looked around for a 
ready-made collection and approached White. Seduced by the prospect of solvency 
after years of financial struggle, and assured that his collection would not 
only remain intact but be seen by thousands of museum visitors, he agreed to 
the proposal. One condition was that "Parallels &amp; Contrasts" -- which 
originated at the New Orleans Museum of Art -- would complete its itinerary 
with San Diego as the last stop. The show also traveled to Copenhagen, 
Frankfurt, Honolulu and Akron, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
White's entire collection covers an unfathomable breadth of material, 
predominantly from the 19th and early 20th centuries. The sampling in the 
exhibition might have been unfathomable, too, had White and curator Nancy 
Barrett not organized it along thematic lines: landscape and architecture, 
science and industry, portraiture, nudes. White's curiosity about photography 
is almost without limit, but it is not without a certain logic. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, he is interested in images, not names, and he cheerfully shows 
anonymous works alongside those of such celebrated masters as Edward Weston, 
Eadweard Muybridge and Alfred Stieglitz. For another, White is fascinated with 
the relationship between photographers and their subjects, which means that he 
is more likely to choose informal, telling portraits than traditionally posed 
pictures and that he leans toward work with social or historical ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
Those preferences produce "parallels," but they also allow for "contrasts," as 
the exhibition title indicates. Among landscapes, Carleton E. Watkins' 
photograph of a massive tree, elaborately dressed in a voluminous mantel of 
leaves, contrasts sharply with Count Olympe Aguado's pictures of naked trunks 
and branches. Watkins' image is a textured mass; Aguado's photographs are all 
lines and angles. 
</P>
<P>
Photographs of science and industry are no less varied, ranging from an X-ray 
of a child with a pin in its mouth to shots of shipyards, military troops and 
agricultural workers. These photographs betray an awe-struck attitude about 
industrialization, but machine worship is portrayed in pictures of gleaming 
trains, as well as in romantic visions of workers who toil among monumental 
smokestacks. 
</P>
<P>
Portraits portray famous and unknown individuals, royal and common family 
groups, and they encompass a full range of emotion in the shy faces of farm 
children, a scowling sailor and such romantic figures as Weston's "Ricardo 
Gomez Robelo," Lotte Jacobi's "Arhmed" and Julia Margaret Cameron's "Mrs. 
Duckworth as Virgin Mary." One startling picture, taken by Camillus S. Fly in 
1886, depicts a "Captive White Boy" among Indians in Tombstone, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
The nudes generally appear to come from an age when modesty prevailed but 
wasn't confused with Puritanical inhibition. While Bill Brandt's female nude 
with cut-off arms poses strange questions about the difference between real 
life people and sculpture, most of the nudes are suffused with near-reverence 
for the human body. Whether a subject is likened to a masthead (in the work of 
Laure Albin-Guillot), a tuberous vegetable (Weston) or theatrical characters, 
the figure is treated as a vulnerable temple of beauty. 
</P>
<P>
After wandering through the four sections of the exhibition, a comforting 
feeling about vintage photography emerges. No matter how many old pictures we 
have seen, there are still wonderful discoveries to be made among images 
printed on little sheets of photosensitive paper. Notre Dame comes alive, for 
example, in Charles Marville's surprising view of the cathedral's spires and 
gargoyles, circa 1859. No longer a mere tourist attraction, the building is an 
amazing creation that bristles with artistic detail, wit and Christian dogma. 
</P>
<P>
Museum visitors from Southern California have reason to regret the loss of this 
collection, but White has not dropped out of photography. He is hard at work on 
photography books and exhibitions. And he is still collecting, a habit that he 
admits is an incurable addiction.

Munch Exhibit Opens: The tormented inner life of Norwegian artist Edvard Munch, 
who once said that "my pictures are my diaries," is laid bare in a new 
exhibition of his prints that opened Sunday at the National Gallery of Art in 
Washington. The show's 94 prints were assembled from the holdings of Sarah and 
Lionel Epstein, who plan to give their entire collection of about 200 Munch 
woodcuts, lithographs and other graphic works to the museum. The exhibit will 
travel later this year to Los Angeles. GREG BRAXTON

New Sticker Bills: Despite the recent agreement by the Recording Industry Assn. 
of America to label explicit recordings, a new stickering proposal was 
introduced in the New Jersey Legislature earlier this month by State Sen. 
Gerald Cardinale. 
</P>
<P>
A similar bill passed the Louisiana House of Representatives at the same time 
by State Rep. Ted Haik. In a related move, Congressman Howard Nielsen (R-Utah) 
also introduced a federal resolution calling for the music industry to revise 
its voluntary stickering plan. The resolution, which carries no legal 
authority, calls for implementation of a warning label "displayed in a 
prominent and standard location in eye-catching color" that would reveal "full 
disclosure of lyrical content." GREG BRAXTON

Selleck's Dad Gets Apology: Tom Selleck's father received an apology from the 
Globe supermarket tabloid for statements it published in a 1982 article 
describing his son's alleged "love secrets." 
</P>
<P>
The apology, published in this week's edition of the weekly tabloid, and 
confidential terms reached between the Florida-based Globe and Robert Selleck, 
settles a $6-million libel suit filed seven years ago. The case involved a 
story headlined, "Tom Selleck's Love Secrets -- By His Father." Other headlines 
promised "His Father Reveals All" about "Why Tom Selleck Can Never Become a 
Happy Lover." Robert Selleck denied making any statements about his son's love 
life. GREG BRAXTON

CBS Joins CNN: In a cost-saving experiment that may be tried elsewhere 
overseas, Cable News Network and CBS News will share a bureau and satellite 
equipment in Berlin. The test will start in mid-June and is "a limited 
experiment," in which the two organizations will maintain separate news 
correspondents and producers. The Berlin bureau arrangement marks the second 
deal between CBS and cable tycoon Ted Turner, who unsuccessfully tried to buy 
CBS in 1986. GREG BRAXTON

ACCORNERO DISAPPOINTS AT BARNSDALL THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
To operate an automobile, perform surgery, cut hair, sell houses or serve food 
to the public, a license is required. To sing a recital of great art songs, all 
that's necessary is to find an available stage and get on it. 
</P>
<P>
Something is wrong with this system, as baritone Marc Accornero proved 
conclusively Saturday night in Barnsdall Gallery Theatre. If singing is like 
driving, and communicative artistry like delicate surgery, then in this case 
the car was wrecked and the patient died. 
</P>
<P>
Accornero's qualifications for his lofty responsibility include linguistic 
facility, rhythmic accuracy, admirable taste in programming, a reliable memory 
for words and music and excellent judgment in selecting his accompanist, the 
always sympathetic John Boyajy. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, three Bellini songs, Ravel's "Don Quichotte a Dulcinee, Mahler's 
"Songs of a Wayfarer," canciones by Ginastera, Guastavino and Obradors, and 
eight old Spanish songs harmonized by Federico Garcia Lorca were severely 
compromised by a voice that was throaty, constricted, tremulous and lacking 
resonance. 
</P>
<P>
The tendency to sing constantly under pitch made particularly painful moments 
of the "Amen" that closes Ravel's "Chanson epique" and the sustained "Ah!" that 
ends Obradors' "Del cabello mas sutil." 
</P>
<P>
The last straw was a prosaic, flat-as-a-pancake Serenade from "Don Giovanni." 
If the maidservant opened her window to this Don, it would probably be to throw 
something at him. BRUCE BURROUGHS

OJAI FESTIVAL KEEPS CUTTING-EDGE TRADITION -- WITH A TWIST; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: NEW DIRECTOR STEPHEN MOSKO WILL REPLACE THE OLD AND EUROPEAN STANDARDS 
WITH NEW AND AMERICAN FARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There's a change of direction for the Ojai Festival this year. In the past, the 
annual outdoor event has built a reputation for blending lesser-known music by 
Bach, Beethoven and other established masters with the work of cutting edge 
20th-Century personalities such as Igor Stravinsky, Pierre Boulez, Lukas Foss 
and Peter Maxwell Davies. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Mosko, the festival's new music director, plans to maintain the 
cutting-edge tradition, but add a pronounced twist. This weekend, the music of 
Frederic Rzewski, Morton Subotnick, John Adams and Elliott Carter (who will all 
attend) dominates the agenda, replacing any old and European fare with music 
exclusively new and American. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a celebration of the vitality of American music," insisted Mosko by 
telephone from the Bay Area, where he serves as music director of the San 
Francisco Contemporary Players. "The emphasis is not about being academic. It's 
more a fun festival than anything." 
</P>
<P>
Mosko (also known by his lifelong nickname, "Lucky") speaks at a rapid-fire 
pace about the return of tonality, and influences from rock and pop music that 
have helped shape the direction he is trying to emphasize. The conductor, 
composer and teacher, who was born the same year the first official Ojai 
Festival was held in 1947, has also included the works of younger composers 
such as Rand Steiger, Steven Mackey and Art Jarvinen. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that any of us from my generation and younger weren't influenced 
by pop culture," Mosko observed. "And world music has also been an enormous 
influence on composers of our era. I owned my first Ravi Shankar record when I 
was 12." 
</P>
<P>
The annual weekend festival in the Ojai Valley -- 90 minutes northwest of Los 
Angeles -- will present eight concerts in three days, ranging in duration from 
one to three hours. The Ojai Festival Orchestra will be appended by two other 
performance ensembles: Mosko's San Francisco Contemporary Music Players and the 
California E.A.R. Unit. 
</P>
<P>
When asked to describe more specifically what listeners might expect, Mosko 
pointed to the 1960s and '70s, when composers began to rediscover tonality. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a feeling to get back to the immediacy that music can make," he 
explained. "Back in the 1960s when the Fluxus movement was going on, the word 
'minimalism' referred to pieces like those by La Monte Young where a cello 
would play one chord for an hour. I don't know when things got turned around 
with that word. 
</P>
<P>
"The reaction by critics to what they now call 'minimalism,' or 'the new 
simplicity,' is more sociological than musical. The music simply tries to 
incorporate methods outside the longstanding European tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Mosko, who holds teaching posts at the California Institute of the Arts and 
Harvard University, has also changed his composition style since early in his 
career when outrageous avant-garde theater and music were going through a 
heyday. He defends the return of tonality in new music. 
</P>
<P>
"The myth with this type of music is that intellectualism goes away if the 
music becomes more intuitive," he said. "But if you examine the canons in Steve 
Reich's 'Desert Music' or the intricacies in the scores of John Adams or Morton 
Subotnick, the complexity is there, even if the music sounds simpler than 
something by Elliot Carter." 
</P>
<P>
Executive director Jeanette O'Conner, who has served in some capacity with the 
festival for the last 11 years, admits that the subscription rate this year is 
lower than in the past -- down 10% from last year. But she says she has no 
regrets as she leaves the Ojai Festival to become the director of development 
for Chamber Music America in New York next year. 
</P>
<P>
"After all, traditions are made to be broken," she said. "In Ojai, the locals 
have tended to view the event as crazy music plus Bach and Mozart. This year, 
the strong element will be the crazy music." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are availble by calling (800) 554-OJAI. Single ticket prices range from 
$10-$27.50 per concert, $50-$125 for the entire series of five concerts. Three 
special concerts are not included in the series price.

POP CAPSULES: SHINEHEAD ELECTRIFIES 'REGGAE SUNSPLASH' CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If the Greek was an indoor theater, Shinehead's opening reggae-rap-rock salvo 
"Unity" would have torn the roof off at Saturday's "Reggae Sunsplash" concert. 
The lanky New Yorker electrified the crowd's spirit of amiable anarchy by 
strolling through the audience (unescorted by security guards) during a 
sparkling set that again confirmed his enormous potential. 
</P>
<P>
Marcia Griffiths unintentionally built on Shinehead's energy when she invited 
audience members on stage to demonstrate the "electric slide" dance to her 1989 
hit "Electric Boogie." Bad move -- the stage was instantly inundated with fans, 
but what could have been a momentum-breaking debacle turned positive when 
everyone maintained his cool while clearing the stage. Griffiths then kept the 
fire stoked with a triumphant medley of Bob Marley's "Three Little Birds" and 
"Buffalo Soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
Headliner Burning Spear represented reggae's old school, blending blues-rock 
lead guitar, horn punctuations and bass-heavy grooves around his inimitably 
coarse, rich vocals. His trance-dance moves seemed more inspired by some 
private muse than show-biz convention, and just when the hypnotic grooves 
bordered on deadening, Spear's nine-piece band exploded into some thunderous 
dub excursions. 
</P>
<P>
Also performing were smooth singer Freddie McGregor, energetic dance-hall diva 
Shelly Thunder and U-Roy. "Reggae Sunsplash" hits San Diego's Open Air Theatre 
Thursday, Irvine Meadows on Saturday. DON SNOWDEN

MILLI VANILLI -- PLAY-ACTING IN THE ORANGE COUNTY SUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's nothing like vanquishing evil to start a show. And so pop phenomenon 
Milli Vanilli's set on Saturday at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre began with a 
pair of hooded ninja warriors taking the stage, brandishing swords at the 
audience in a vaguely menacing manner -- only to be confronted by the two 
Millis, Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan, both men of the sword, it turns out, as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
The Millis chased the ninjas up the ramp at stage rear. Time for a little 
old-fashioned fight choreography? Not really. Swords were raised, and then, 
without the slightest sign of a struggle, the black-clad warriors fell to the 
ground, cringing, and quickly disappeared from sight, while Fab and Rob assumed 
the heroes' stance. Even by play-acting standards, it seemed like an awfully 
easy victory for the dynamic duo. 
</P>
<P>
Too easy. 
</P>
<P>
Milli Vanilli has overtaken the pop charts in just the same kind of fashion -- 
quick and bloodless -- and doubters are still trying to figure out what they 
did to achieve this overnight sensation: A No. 1 hit with their first single, 
"Girl You Know It's True," followed by three more chart-toppers, all despite 
the derision of avid naysayers who claim the duo lacks any real talent. To 
serious rock fans, this achievement seems to have just been too easy, like a 
fixed fight. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not like those thousands of screaming girls at Irvine were paid off. 
It helps to cast Milli's bubble-gum act, like their exotic good looks, in the 
proper light, and it's not just brooding handsomeness that comes into focus. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh from that not-so-wearying battle conquest, Pilatus and Morvan launched 
right into "Girl You Know It's True," the kind of dance-pop confection that's 
not deceptively simple, just simple -- with a chorus so basic it's not far 
removed from a children's rhyme, and a chiming sort of synthesizer riff that 
sounds almost like a kiddie xylophone. The duo's much-loved dancing, as well, 
brought back playground associations. Bouncing back and forth from one foot to 
the other, they looked like nothing so much as hopscotchers. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, sweet innocence. But hold on. Lest the show remain G-rated for long, by the 
second number the boys were down in the push-up position, doing some fervent 
hip-thrusting in the most time-honored Prince tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Can you say music for those tender transitional years, boys and girls? We knew 
you could. 
</P>
<P>
The 75-minute Irvine show -- also scheduled for the Universal Amphitheatre on 
Sunday and tonight -- offered plenty of cute, if not precise, moves from the 
lads. Footwork aside, they projected an overwhelming blankness, which may be 
due in part to their unfamiliarity with the language of their lyrics and their 
audience. (Pilatus, the primary singer, is German, and Morvan, the rapper, is 
French; both addressed the crowd in heavily accented English.) 
</P>
<P>
What passed for chemistry between these two, meanwhile, was repeatedly running 
at each other from opposite ends of the stage and slapping hands. Their steps 
may be somewhat in sync, but they look much friendlier toward the audience than 
to each other. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of sync. . . . 
</P>
<P>
At least one state has proposed legislation that would mandate warning signs 
outside concerts that use recorded music. If such a law were on the books in 
California right now and the size of the warning were relative to the amount of 
tapes used, the sign outside Irvine Meadows would have been a billboard visible 
from the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't just Vanilli; at least some of their backup band's instrumentation 
was live, though every vocal moment sounded suspiciously perfect and 
studio-treated. But opening act Bardeux, a simpy female dance-pop duo, appeared 
to be miming every note, vocal and instrumental; and even middle-billed rapper 
Young M.C. looked to be lip-syncing on two out of his six numbers. 
</P>
<P>
All this was a subject of debate among the youthful audience, but it didn't 
seem to diminish the crowd's enjoyment an iota. Ah, innocence.

Environmentalist Mary Wiesbrock had waited for months for someone to step 
forward to challenge Madge L. Schaefer, a longtime force in Thousand Oaks 
politics and a high-profile county supervisor since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But no one did. 
</P>
<P>
So, on the eve of the March 9 filing deadline, Wiesbrock, director of the 
environmental group Save Open Space, telephoned a particularly energetic group 
member who recently had caught her eye with a well-written letter to the 
editor. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'We need a candidate,' " said Maria VanderKolk. "We talked for a 
long time. I was sort of orienting myself to this. Until that point, I don't 
think it had occurred to anybody that I might be willing to do this. They 
decided to give me a shot." 
</P>
<P>
Since then the 25-year-old VanderKolk, a manager at a Woodland Hills product 
licensing firm, has struggled to establish herself as a credible challenger to 
Schaefer, who for two decades has toiled in local and county politics. 
</P>
<P>
Name identification has been a problem for VanderKolk, a University of Colorado 
graduate who moved to Thousand Oaks only 20 months ago, and who was unknown 
even to most of her campaign workers until she filed against Schaefer. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as May 8, a VanderKolk press release highlighted her own lack of 
name identification with the headline: "Schaefer's Opponent Charges Supervisor 
With Violation of State Laws." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people say they dragged this candidate out of the woodwork," 
VanderKolk said last week. "But I think it's a noble cause, and this country 
might be a lot better if we had people getting in there with new ideas and new 
perspectives." 
</P>
<P>
The central theme of VanderKolk's campaign has been the preservation of open 
space in Ventura County, though she has declared positions on several other 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
A member of Greenpeace and the National Wildlife Federation, she has blasted 
Schaefer as pro-development, citing the supervisor's vote last year to allow 
developers to prepare environmental reports on the Jordan and Ahmanson ranches 
in the southeast county. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people have the idea that I'm parroting what other people want me to 
say," VanderKolk said. "But these are my beliefs I'm expressing, my concern 
about the Jordan Ranch issue. People support me because I'm expressing their 
frustrations." 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer, 48, a college-educated housewife elected to the Thousand Oaks City 
Council on a controlled-growth platform in 1978, has waged this race as if she 
were a poker player with an unbeatable hand. 
</P>
<P>
Of the VanderKolk challenge, she repeatedly has said: "What campaign?" 
Statements filed on Thursday showed $29,000 in Schaefer's treasury and $2,800 
in VanderKolk's. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisor spent $8,250 this spring for a poll on the concerns of her 
constituents and laughs confidently about what it shows. Yet she will not 
discuss its findings in detail because, she said, "my little friend might read 
it" and get some useful ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, Schaefer has showed signs of taking VanderKolk more 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, she angrily claimed a violation of state law when Patagonia Inc., a 
firm that backed three successful slow-growth candidates in last fall's Ventura 
city election, pledged to spend $9,000 on a series of newspaper advertisements 
backing VanderKolk. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer insisted that the Ventura-based company, a consistent contributor to 
environmental causes, had exceeded contribution limits and was using VanderKolk 
"like a pawn." She called Kevin Sweeney, the company's public affairs director, 
"a Colorado carpetbagger, an ultra-liberal Democrat dabbling in local 
politics." Sweeney, ex-press secretary to former U.S. Sen. Gary Hart, noted 
that he is from California. 
</P>
<P>
By late Friday, Schaefer had announced endorsements by Sheriff John Gillespie, 
Thousand Oaks councilmen Bob Lewis and Larry Horner, the entire City Council of 
Port Hueneme and associations representing county firefighters and deputy 
sheriffs. 
</P>
<P>
VanderKolk has been endorsed only by Save Open Space, which Wiesbrock said has 
144 members, many of them from the Thousand Oaks and Agoura Hills area. 
</P>
<P>
While VanderKolk said she expects perhaps 80 of her volunteers to knock on 
doors of frequent voters during the next week, Schaefer will reveal little 
about her strategy for the final days before the June 5 election. She will mail 
a flyer, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Pamphlets distributed by VanderKolk's volunteers will continue to hammer at 
Schaefer's positions on growth and her acceptance of contributions from real 
estate developers, the challenger said. 
</P>
<P>
One VanderKolk flyer asks voters why they should care about who is supervisor 
in the 2nd District, which stretches the length of the south county from 
Thousand Oaks to Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
"Because it's time to oust politicians who are beholden to developers," the 
pamphlets answer in bold letters above a photograph of Schaefer and billionaire 
developer David H. Murdock at a charity ball at his Hidden Valley horse ranch. 
</P>
<P>
The flyer says that Schaefer has received tens of thousands of dollars from the 
development industry and notes that a county grand jury is investigating 
Murdock's relationship with the supervisor and other county officials. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer voted for Murdock's 1,900-acre country club and luxury housing 
development at Lake Sherwood in 1987, held a 1988 campaign fund-raiser at his 
ranch and has accepted a pony auctioned for $4,000 and a $1,000 contribution 
from him. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer has said that she thinks the grand jury investigation was prompted by 
a complaint by an old political enemy from Thousand Oaks. Developer 
contributions, which are common in Southern California, in no way affect her 
vote, the supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
Most campaign debate has focused not on Murdock's Sherwood Country Club, which 
is the only major development approved by supervisors since Schaefer joined the 
board, but on a proposed land swap that would make possible the subdivision of 
the Jordan Ranch east of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the National Park Service would exchange 59 acres of 
parkland needed for an access road to the subdivision for 1,100 acres of the 
2,309-acre ranch. In addition, ranch owner Bob Hope is donating and selling 
another 4,600 acres in the Santa Susana and Santa Monica mountains to park 
agencies for a below-market $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
VanderKolk insists that the only reason for the swap is to develop the ranch 
and that approval will create so much pressure on supervisors that they will 
not be able to reject the 750-house project. 
</P>
<P>
The land swap should not be considered separate from the county board's 
approval, VanderKolk said. "There is no point in going through with this land 
swap unless they are going through with the ranch development." 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer said she favors the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"Why she opposes giving up 59 acres for 5,700 acres just totally mystifies me," 
Schaefer said. The deal does not legally obligate Ventura County to approve 
anything, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Jordan Ranch issue has created a rift even among environmentalists. For 
example, the Southern California Regional Conservation Committee of the Sierra 
Club approved the swap 18-4, but both Ventura County representatives voted 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
VanderKolk, who describes herself as a "left-wing Republican," has criticized 
Schaefer for allowing environmental studies of the Jordan and the adjacent 
Ahmanson ranches. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer, who describes herself as a moderate on growth and a "conservative 
Republican," said to refuse such studies is to strip property owners of their 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
"They must have a chance to state their case. What she is proposing with 
Ahmanson and Jordan was what the Nazis did. Just seize the property. . . . 
She's young, but hopefully she's heard about that in her history classes." 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer said that the key issue of the campaign should not be development, 
which is controlled by a county policy that requires it to be clustered in or 
near cities. Development issues are "probably one-20th of what a supervisor 
does," Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
The issue should be how well each candidate can do the job, she said. 
VanderKolk, who acknowledges never having attended a supervisors' meeting, does 
not "have a clue," Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
Even rivals acknowledge that Schaefer, though tart-tongued and quick-tempered, 
is smart and hard-working. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow supervisors said they do not endorse in supervisorial races, but 
declared Schaefer capable and direct. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a good board member because she does her homework, and she has a good 
financial head," said Supervisor Maggie Erickson, who with Schaefer is credited 
with reforms at the Ventura County Medical Center that have led to increased 
collections. 
</P>
<P>
County administrators say that through a Revenue Enhancement Committee created 
by Schaefer, the county gathered ideas from employees that saved hundreds of 
thousands of dollars from 1987 to '89. 
</P>
<P>
"She has ideas. They're popping all the time," county Chief Administrative 
Officer Richard Wittenberg said. "She's hands-on. That's her whole style." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor John K. Flynn, with whom Schaefer has had her stormiest public 
differences, said, "Madge has the characteristics of a good leader. She is able 
to articulate positions.. . . She knows where the issues are and she takes off 
after them." 
</P>
<P>
Flynn said, however: "The county didn't begin when Madge became a supervisor. 
The rest of us were doing much the same thing before Madge came along." 
</P>
<P>
VanderKolk, who claims several college academic honors, is well-spoken and says 
she is experienced beyond her years. She began to work full time in 1986 as a 
publicist for a computer marketing firm, according to her resume. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not the typical 25-year-old," she said. "I've been a professional in the 
corporate world for five years." 
</P>
<P>
But in an interview she pleaded ignorance on a number of governmental issues, 
such as the sources of water for Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"You can bring up a lot of things that I'm not familiar with right now," she 
said. "I don't pretend to be a career politician. There's an excellent staff at 
the county. Their job is to inform the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten a lot of flak because of my relative youth," VanderKolk said. "But 
this was the time to step in. If I wait another 15 years, the fight I'm 
fighting will be over. The open space will be gone."

SWAP SETS STAGE FOR RIVER EDGE PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: A DEAL BETWEEN THE COUNTY AND A CONSTRUCTION FIRM ENDS A DECADE OF 
NEGOTIATIONS OVER 265 ACRES OF PROPERTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Ventura County has agreed to swap an aging 14-acre maintenance yard in north 
Oxnard for a new facility nearby, paving the way for construction of the 
largest commercial development in the county, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The deal with River Edge Development Co. will end a decade of sometimes-bitter 
negotiations between the county and a succession of builders with grand plans 
for a prime, 265-acre site northeast of the Ventura Freeway at the Santa Clara 
River. 
</P>
<P>
Acquisition of the county yard has been critical to River Edge because it 
stands in the path of a new freeway interchange that must be completed before 
three-fourths of the company's project can be built. 
</P>
<P>
As approved by the Oxnard City Council in 1985, the $500-million project could 
have 4.4-million square feet of space and include office towers up to 24 
stories high, a low-rise business park, a large shopping mall, a hotel and a 
cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
Only the steel frame of a six-floor office building, a row of young palm trees 
and the county maintenance yard now mark the site. 
</P>
<P>
Legal documents are being drafted to seal the maintenance-yard deal, which the 
Board of Supervisors approved in concept a year ago, said spokesmen for both 
the county and the developer. 
</P>
<P>
A final agreement has been delayed by disputes about how much River Edge will 
spend to improve the 20-acre parcel off Vineyard Avenue, where the county's new 
buildings will be located, the spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
The improvements finally agreed upon, including septic tanks and perimeter 
walls, will cost between $4.5 million and $7.5 million, county Chief 
Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the developer will pay up to $6.5 million to construct a 
69,000-square-foot set of buildings for the county, Wittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The new facility, like the old one, will include the county's automotive repair 
shop, a fire station, a radio communications center, and offices for public 
works, flood control and weights and measures, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very good deal," Wittenberg said. "Instead of having a 1950s 
barracks-type facility that is literally falling down, this will give us a 
brand-new facility. But we're giving up a very, very valuable piece of 
property." 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor John K. Flynn, in whose district the project is located, 
said, "We wanted to make sure the deal added up to the market value of the land 
out there, and it does." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Denis, a River Edge vice president, said that the deal is nearly complete. 
</P>
<P>
"The papers are drawn," he said. "The issues we're still talking about are not 
substantial. It's an agreement to do all things necessary to build a new yard." 
</P>
<P>
However, during negotiations with the county, "we've had a lot of small points 
that became big ones," Denis added. "We've moved from one issue to another and 
then back again. Everybody is a little impatient about this." 
</P>
<P>
If negotiators are impatient today, they once were angry. 
</P>
<P>
Documents on file with the county show that county representatives have walked 
out of at least one meeting since 1981 to put pressure on builders to increase 
their offers for the maintenance yard. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, developers first argued that the county should donate the 14 acres as 
surplus, since taxes from the project would flow both to the county and the 
city of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
By 1985, when Oxnard approved the project, developer Robert P. Warmington Co. 
had set a value of $2 million on the county land. The same year, the company 
estimated that $5.3 million in sales, hotel and property taxes would go to 
Oxnard annually after the project is complete in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
The county also would eventually receive about $1.6 million each year in 
property taxes, and about 11,000 jobs would be created, the company estimated. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Warmington increased its appraisal of the county yard to $4.35 
million, and Flynn, in a pointed letter, accused the developer of trying to get 
Caltrans to condemn the county property so the project could move forward. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the negotiations, Oxnard officials lobbied the county to sell the 
yard, county officials said. "Yes, they have wanted to have the interchange 
built," said Richard Maggio, Oxnard's community development director. 
</P>
<P>
River Edge, which took over the project about two years ago, plans to begin 
construction on another five low-rise office buildings, a restaurant and a 
100-room hotel during the next 18 months, Denis said. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after that, construction of the first half of a million-square-foot 
shopping mall is planned, he said. By comparison, the Oaks Mall in Thousand 
Oaks has about 1.2 million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The high-rise core of the project, about 1.5 million square feet in 12- to 
24-story buildings, will be built to meet regional demand within the next 10 to 
15 years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The vacancy rate in county office buildings is about 18%, which is lower than 
some depressed parts of Los Angeles County but high when compared nationally, 
industry analysts said.

VETERANS PATROL CEMETERY TO PROTECT MEMORIAL DAY FLAG DISPLAY 
</P>

<P>
Vietnam veteran Richard Camacho stood guard duty this Memorial Day weekend -- 
at a cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
Camacho, president of Vietnam Veterans of Ventura County, and about 20 other 
members camped out Saturday night at Ivy Lawn Memorial Park in Ventura to guard 
603 American flags that had been raised for Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The flags had once been draped over the coffins of people killed in various 
wars, and their families had donated them for the cemetery's Avenue of Flags 
observance, Camacho said. 
</P>
<P>
When the Veterans of Foreign Wars organization first constructed the Avenue of 
Flags six years ago, about 30 flags were stolen, Camacho said. Since then, 
veterans and their families have been conducting unarmed patrols of the 
cemetery when the flags are flown on Veterans Day and Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"Teen-agers and kids will try to steal them," Camacho said. "Since we've 
started, we've only lost about three flags." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Vietnam Veterans group patrolled Saturday night, VFW members 
were to keep watch Sunday night and the cemetery staff patrolled during the 
day. Following a ceremony at the Ventura County Government Center today, the 
flags will be taken down and stored at the cemetery until Veterans Day. 
</P>
<P>
Using citizens band radios to keep in contact with each other, the group 
Saturday night set up watches in four areas of the cemetery, which covers more 
than 200 acres. Meanwhile, Rob Baskin and Joe DeLullo drove around the park in 
a pickup truck, looking for troublemakers. 
</P>
<P>
By 4:40 a.m., the long night was beginning to wear on Baskin, 23, and DeLullo, 
38. They had been patrolling continuously since 8 p.m. Saturday without 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
"You're staying out here all night, and you're hoping someone will be an idiot. 
. . . It's kind of a bummer that no one came over the wall," said Baskin, the 
son of a Vietnam veteran. 
</P>
<P>
DeLullo answered hopefully, "It's not over yet." 
</P>
<P>
According to DeLullo, the cemetery offers little protection against intruders. 
"It ain't nothing for someone to hop that wall," he said, pointing to a short 
brick barrier surrounding most of the cemetery, which fronts on Valentine Road. 
At the back is a large field where intruders can easily enter. The veterans set 
up camp in the field. 
</P>
<P>
To surprise any intruders, Baskin and DeLullo kept their truck's headlights off 
as they patrolled. "You don't want the brake lights to show, so you coast to a 
stop or use the emergency brake," Baskin explained. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest excitement the pair had Saturday night was spotting a fellow 
veteran who was playing a practical joke. "We saw him just leaning against a 
tree and he didn't move when he shined the spotlight on him," DeLullo said. "We 
thought he was dead or something." 
</P>
<P>
This was the first year Baskin and DeLullo patrolled at the cemetery. "It kind 
of makes Memorial Day special," DeLullo said.

5 MEN HOLD UP JEWELRY STORE

<P>
An undetermined amount of jewelry was stolen at gunpoint from a Simi Valley 
store, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Five men, one armed with a handgun, walked into Zales Jewelers, 2914 Cochran 
St., at 3 p.m. Saturday and ordered the store manager to open a safe and 
several display cases. 
</P>
<P>
They loaded the jewelry into large plastic bags, said Police Lt. Neal Rein. 
</P>
<P>
The store manager was not reported injured in the robbery. Rein said he did not 
know if any other employees or customers were present. 
</P>
<P>
A witness reported the license number of the getaway car, which police later 
learned had been stolen in Los Angeles, Rein said. 
</P>
<P>
Rein said the holdup was similar to an April 27 robbery in Thousand Oaks when 
three men walked into a Best Products store and held eight customers and 
employees at gunpoint while they took $100,000 worth of jewelry from display 
cases. PEGGY Y. LEE

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA CRUZ ISLAND; 
</P>
<P>
2 MEN RESCUED AFTER RACING BOAT SINKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men were rescued by a helicopter after their racing boat sank seven miles 
off Santa Cruz Island, U.S. Coast Guard officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Neither boat owner Joe McGowan nor his passenger, Rick Harding, both of Santa 
Barbara, was seriously injured, Coast Guard Lt. John Dagostino said. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard received a radio call from McGowan and Harding saying the 
24-foot-long boat was taking on water shortly after 2 p.m., Dagostino said. By 
the time a Coast Guard helicopter arrived about 45 minutes later, the boat -- 
the Bold Marauder -- was under water, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The men managed to put on wet suits, grab the radio and get into a life raft 
before the boat sank, Dagostino said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men had a cut elbow, Dagostino said. 
</P>
<P>
The boat, described as a customized racing boat, apparently sank in deep water 
and appeared to be unsalvageable, Coast Guard officials said. They did not have 
an estimate on the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials were still investigating the incident.

Authorities said tickets -- primarily for brake, suspension, steering and other 
mechanical violations -- were given to 254 trucks. The CHP ordered 141 of the 
vehicles out of service. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities estimate that about 1,200 truckers use the highway between Moorpark 
and Somis daily. The CHP chose California 118 as a checkpoint site because many 
truckers use the highway to avoid the Conejo Weigh Station on the Ventura 
Freeway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP holds about eight surprise inspections per year at that location, the 
spokeswoman said.

VOTERS GET A CHANCE AT RAIL PLANS, BUT IT MAY NOT MATTER; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: THE ADVISORY MEASURE IS THE WORK OF SUPERVISOR MIKE ANTONOVICH, 
WHO FAVORS A MONORAIL SYSTEM. 
</P>

<P>
After seven years of debate about what kind of rail line to build in the San 
Fernando Valley and where to build it, on June 5 voters will finally have their 
say. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't necessarily mean it will make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
The vote is strictly advisory, and transportation officials do not have to heed 
what the public says about the three rival rail plans on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, which has the 
final word, already has rejected two of the plans and voted to extend the Metro 
Rail subway westward from North Hollywood to Van Nuys. Before voting in March, 
commissioners said they could not wait for the results of the advisory vote. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ballot measure is multiple choice, and few expect a clear 
winner. A splintered vote is likely to be greeted by a Babel of conflicting 
interpretations from advocates of various plans. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory vote will be conducted in an area that includes all of the San 
Fernando Valley, Glendale, Agoura Hills, Calabasas and Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition A was placed on the ballot in February by county supervisors at the 
behest of Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who has been trying to breathe life into 
his nearly moribund plan to build a monorail along 16.5 miles of the Ventura 
Freeway from Universal City to Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich's motion listed his monorail proposal first among the rail plans in 
the ballot referendum. The second position went to the county Transportation 
Commission's approved plan to extend the downtown-to-North Hollywood Metro Rail 
subway 5.6 miles west to the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The extension would be built on the Southern Pacific railroad's Burbank Branch 
right of way, and would go underground through single-family neighborhoods of 
North Hollywood and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents say the Metro Rail extension is the only plan that will allay 
homeowner worries about noise, ground vibrations and visual blight. Although 
there is only enough money to build the line as far west as the San Diego 
Freeway, Metro Rail advocates say express buses can carry passengers to Warner 
Center and other West Valley destinations. 
</P>
<P>
The third plan -- fiercely opposed by many living along the Southern Pacific 
right of way -- is to build a 14.1-mile light-rail system in a shallow trench 
-- lined on both sides with berms -- from North Hollywood to Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
Light-rail advocates contend that fears of noise and visual blight from 
ground-level trains are unjustified. And because of its relatively low cost, 
they say, a light-rail line can be built all the way across the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Also included is a fourth option: no rail line at all. 
</P>
<P>
Since unveiling his monorail plan more than two years ago, Antonovich has been 
continually frustrated in efforts to solicit broad support. 
</P>
<P>
Few have been persuaded by his argument that a futuristic technology like a 
monorail in a high visibility setting along the freeway is needed to lure 
Valley commuters from their cars. When a 31-member citizens committee appointed 
by the Los Angeles City Council studied rail options in 1988, a monorail drew 
some interest, but members were reluctant to endorse it. 
</P>
<P>
Most were wary because monorail is largely untested in this country, and it 
would add a new technology to the two already under construction in Los Angeles 
County -- high-speed, high-capacity Metro Rail and ground-level light rail. 
</P>
<P>
Until the referendum qualified for the ballot, the monorail plan appeared to be 
dying. Fearing that the ballot measure would bring Antonovich's plan back to 
life, Metro Rail advocates went to court to try to block the measure. 
</P>
<P>
On April 8, a state Court of Appeal declined to strike the measure from county 
ballots but expressed "serious doubts about the propriety of the use of such 
alternative options in a ballot proposition." 
</P>
<P>
The court also ordered the county to take the unorthodox step of including one 
argument for and against each option on the ballot, but gave proponents less 
than 24 hours to submit the arguments. 
</P>
<P>
In the resulting rush, no one submitted an argument against the light-rail 
option, and Antonovich used the argument against the "no rail" option to pump 
again for a monorail. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the confusing nature of the ballot and the accompanying arguments, 
those whose plans do poorly seem well positioned to argue that the results 
should be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Roger L. Stanard, a Warner Center lawyer and chairman of the Campaign for 
Valley Rail Transit, which supports the Metro Rail extension, called it a 
"rigged ballot measure" that favors Antonovich's plan and would be "very hard 
to interpret." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Stanard said votes for the light-rail line and the Metro Rail line 
should be combined, "because this is really a choice between two routes -- the 
freeway and the Burbank Branch. I don't think people care about the type of 
system. They're all boxes in which people sit and get moved from one place to 
another." 
</P>
<P>
Rosa Kortizya, Antonovich's transportation deputy, said she expected a 
"splintered vote, and we'd like to get about 45% of the vote." 
</P>
<P>
But she indicated that, even if the monorail vote is smaller than that, 
Antonovich will continue promoting his plan on the assumption that "as time 
goes by, the unreasonably high cost of the Metro Rail extension will become 
obvious, and people will start to look for alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
She noted that the county Transportation Commission's plan to build the subway 
extension starting in 1996 depends on continued federal funds for rail building 
and keeping cost overruns down -- "both of which are not at all certain." 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich also contends that monorail is the only plan likely to attract 
private investors should the commission decide to save money by awarding a 
private firm a franchise to build and operate the system along the freeway. 
Rail experts say that the high cost of tunneling usually puts off private 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
Both Metro Rail and monorail advocates have been soliciting funds to finance 
radio spots to support their plans. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald A. Silver, an Encino homeowners group leader, has welcomed the ballot 
measure as a platform for his anti-rail views. He wrote two of the seven ballot 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
Silver has become a regular on radio talk shows, armed with government and 
academic studies that question the results of the 60 or more rail projects 
built or under construction in the country in recent decades. 
</P>
<P>
He said he also has mailed several pieces of anti-rail literature to residents 
along the freeway, using a mailing list that has turned out more than 100 
people at public hearings to protest any freeway rail line. 
</P>
<P>
Silver declined to predict the outcome of the voting but said he was "hopeful 
that the public will finally see what boondoggles these rail projects are." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PROS AND CONS OF RAIL OPTIONS 
</P>
<P>
Monorail along Ventura Freeway from 
</P>
<P>
Universal City to Canoga Park 
</P>
<P>
Advantages: 
</P>
<P>
* Futuristic technology and high visibility along freeway might attract more 
riders than rival systems. 
</P>
<P>
* Cost of $90 million to $110 million per mile is much less than subway. 
</P>
<P>
* Equipment manufacturers might be willing to build and operate system on a 
for-profit basis. 
</P>
<P>
Disadvantages: 
</P>
<P>
* Requires passengers to change trains at Universal City to continue to 
Hollywood and downtown. 
</P>
<P>
* Residential areas along freeway will incur visual blight, some noise, loss of 
privacy and increased congestion. 
</P>
<P>
* Some critics say that elevated structures might collapse in a severe 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Metro Rail subway along Southern Pacific 
</P>
<P>
railroad's Burbank Branch from North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
to the San Diego Freeway 
</P>
<P>
Advantages: 
</P>
<P>
* Protects residential areas along route from noise and visual blight. 
</P>
<P>
* Has wide support from business, civic and homeowner groups 
</P>
<P>
* Passengers bound for Hollywood and downtown would not be forced to transfer 
in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
* High-speed, high-capacity system. 
</P>
<P>
Disadvantages: 
</P>
<P>
* Cost of about $200 million per mile. 
</P>
<P>
* Because of high cost, can only be built as far west as the San Diego Freeway 
for now. 
</P>
<P>
* Partly because of high cost, cannot be completed until year 2001 at the 
earliest. 
</P>
<P>
Light rail in a trench/berm configuration 
</P>
<P>
along the Burbank Branch 
</P>
<P>
from North Hollywood to Canoga Park 
</P>
<P>
Advantages: 
</P>
<P>
* A complete cross-Valley system could be built for about $75 million per mile. 
</P>
<P>
* Its cost makes feasible a future extension east to Burbank and Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
* Light-rail cars can be made compatible with Metro Rail cars and the system 
could be upgraded in the future to a full Metro Rail operation, proponents say. 
</P>
<P>
* Trench and berm would protect nearby residents adequately from noise, 
advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
Disadvantages: 
</P>
<P>
* Well-organized, vocal opposition among residents along the railroad right of 
way, who contend trains would be noisy and unpleasant to look at. 
</P>
<P>
* Little public support, since most early advocates of light rail have joined 
the coalition supporting a Metro Rail extension. 
</P>
<P>
No rail line 
</P>
<P>
Advantages: 
</P>
<P>
* Taxpayer dollars would not be spent on system that critics say is inflexible 
and fails to serve most travelers. 
</P>
<P>
* Rail systems elsewhere seldom meet ridership projections and usually cost 
more than projected. 
</P>
<P>
* Rail systems cost so much to operate that they drain money from buses, 
critics say. 
</P>
<P>
Disadvantages: 
</P>
<P>
* Despite cost overruns and failure to meet ridership goals, rail lines 
elsewhere are often popular, resulting in public support for additional lines. 
</P>
<P>
* High costs for rail systems reflect reality that many commuters will not 
leave cars unless the alternative is modern and attractive, proponents say. 
</P>
<P>
* Money not spent in Valley will likely be shifted to other Southland 
communities vying for rail lines.

FOUR ARRESTED IN BURGLARY OF LIQUOR STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four burglary suspects were arrested Sunday after a resident saw a break-in at 
an El Cajon liquor store and called police. 
</P>
<P>
When Officer Michelle Hales arrived at the store in the 400 block of Jamacha 
Road about 4 a.m., she saw four people run to a pickup and speed away, a 
spokeswoman for the El Cajon Police Department said. 
</P>
<P>
A 10-minute chase by Hales and other officers followed, ending when the 
suspects crashed the truck into a guardrail at the end of El Jardin Court in El 
Cajon, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects ran from the vehicle, but were captured and taken into custody. 
During the pursuit, a drawer containing cash and a large quantity of 
cigarettes, with a combined value of $20,000, were thrown from the vehicle, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were booked into County Jail on suspicion of burglary. They were 
identified as John Huggins, 39; David Jason Brown, 34; Krystal Arlene Durio, 
25, and Lisa Williams, 29, all of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the suspects may be linked to a series of other burglaries in El 
Cajon earlier this month.

MAN, 19, KILLED AS TRUCK FLIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 19-year-old man was killed in East San Diego when the pickup in which he was 
riding was struck by a car that ran a stop sign, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Two people inside the car fled the area on foot, police said, and were still at 
large Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Richard J. Figueroa, who lived at 3868 38th Street in East San Diego, was 
pronounced dead at the scene from massive head injuries, a coroner's office 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at 11:53 p.m. Saturday at 38th and Wightman streets. The 
pickup in which Figueroa was riding was westbound on Wightman when it was 
struck by the car, said a San Diego Police Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The impact flipped the pickup on its side, crushing Figueroa's skull, police 
said. Mark Harris, 28, the driver of the truck, escaped injury, as did a second 
passenger, whose name was not released. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that Harris, although not at fault in the accident, was arrested 
for driving under the influence, in this case a misdemeanor. Had his drinking 
contributed to the death of Figueroa, he would have been booked on a felony, 
police said.

RAIN WASHES OUT AND BLESSES A WEARY SDSU BASEBALL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
STANFORD 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rain fell softly and steadily on Stanford's Sunken Diamond Sunday, causing 
the postponement of the NCAA West I Regional championship between Stanford and 
San Diego State, first until later Sunday afternoon and, finally, until noon 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The rain was welcomed by a weary SDSU team, a team that spent Saturday playing 
two emotional games, going through six pitchers, two ankles and 19 innings 
before finally arriving at the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Late Saturday night, assistant coach Gary Brown was finishing up bed checks 
when he laid out the ideal scenario. 
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the rainy forecast, and then grinned the kind of grin you use when 
you're up to something. It rains Sunday, he said, and cancels the game. Then, 
Monday, all of the Aztec pitchers are rested and ready to go. Meanwhile, 
Stanford is still without ace Stan Spencer, who threw nine innings Saturday 
morning. Perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, the Aztecs woke up to rain Sunday. First, the game was postponed 
from noon until 3 p.m. So the Aztecs arrived at Sunken Diamond a few minutes 
after 2, when the rain had stopped. Five minutes later, it started again, 
heavily, and the tarp was pulled over the field. 
</P>
<P>
See you tomorrow, tournament officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God," SDSU Coach Jim Dietz said. "We've played one extra game (due to 
being in the loser's bracket) and gotten up for two games at 6 a.m. It will 
help us. Maybe it won't have any bearing on the game, but it won't hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
To win the tournament and go to the College World Series, the Aztecs (49-21) 
must defeat No. 1 Stanford twice. Stanford (55-10), without a loss in this 
double-elimination tournament, just needs to win once. If SDSU wins at noon, it 
will face Stanford again today at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs are coming off a day, Saturday, when they lost to Stanford, 6-2, but 
turned around and defeated Southern Illinois, 4-3, in 10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
So it's easy to see why Stanford Coach Mark Marquess was disappointed with 
Sunday's rainout. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to get them today," Marquess said Sunday. "They're coming off a 
tough day (Saturday) with the doubleheader. I'd love to play them today. But 
whether this is a big advantage for San Diego State or a big advantage for 
Stanford, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
By taking Sunday off, the Aztecs were able to rest, which was particularly 
important for their pitchers and two players with injured ankles. 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Scott Dennison, the team's leading hitter with a .362 average, 
sprained an ankle Saturday and wouldn't have played Sunday. Now, he figures to 
be available today. He probably won't start, but he should be able to be used 
late in a game. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll probably be 80% (Monday)," Dietz said. "Today, he was probably 40%." 
</P>
<P>
Dennison spent most of Sunday taking whirlpool and ultrasound treatments. 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Steve Boucher also sprained an ankle Saturday, but his wasn't as 
bad. Boucher should be 100% today. 
</P>
<P>
As for the pitching staff, Dietz said, if need be, he will use all eight 
pitchers in the first game and, if the Aztecs win, turn around and use all 
eight of them in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm serious," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then he paused. The raindrops continued. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a gut feeling things will be kind of interesting tomorrow," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
The rain is supposed to let up by this morning. . . . A last case scenario in 
case the rain continues is that an NCAA committee will pick this region's 
representative to the College World Series, which begins Friday. Tournament 
director Jerry Kindall, baseball coach at the University of Arizona, said the 
championship could be played as late as Tuesday. He wouldn't speculate further, 
but Wednesday should also be possible. . . . SDSU will likely start Kevin 
Nielsen (4-3, 4.53 earned-run average) today at noon. Stanford will probably go 
with Brian Sackinsky (8-1, 5.07). . . . SDSU alumnus Joe Cusimano, who lives in 
the Bay area, took the team out to dinner Sunday night. "They're coming out of 
the woodwork," SDSU Coach Jim Dietz said. "I'd say that I've actually shaken 
hands with or talked to, conservatively, 100 people. Just alumni, or people in 
some way connected with SDSU." Former SDSU and NFL quarterback Jesse Freitas 
was one. . . . Shhhh -- the Aztecs have plane and hotel reservations all set 
for the College World Series, as well as meal money and cash advances. If they 
defeat Stanford twice today, they're scheduled to leave San Diego for Omaha, 
Neb. on Tuesday.

PADRES BRAWL AND HAVE A BALL BEATING THE METS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were scratch marks around Greg Harris' neck, and a bruise on his right 
shoulder. Abrasions were on Mike Dunne's forehead. Phil Stephenson's eye was 
red, with a contact lens missing. 
</P>
<P>
Surveying the scene in the Padre clubhouse, Padre third baseman Mike Pagliarulo 
took a swig of beer, wiped his mouth with his sleeve, and proudly proclaimed, 
"This is what it's all about, baby. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you see us out there today? I haven't had this much fun in years. Yeah, 
baby, I think things are going to be all right." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres (21-22), this same bunch of guys who were apprehensive a week ago 
just raising their voice in the clubhouse, found themselves in the middle of a 
genuine, old-fashioned, brawl Sunday afternoon, and loving every minute of it. 
</P>
<P>
The boxscore will reveal that the Padres defeated the New York Mets, 8-4, in 
front of a sellout crowd of 47,876 at Shea Stadium, but the eighth-inning brawl 
-- triggered when Harris hit Met shortstop Kevin Elster in the back with a 
fastball -- symbolized their metamorphosis. 
</P>
<P>
"We were out there today as a team," Pagliarulo said. "Everybody was fighting 
for the same cause. It wasn't just one guy, it was 25 guys, all risking their 
bodies for the good of the team." 
</P>
<P>
Yes sir, you had Harris kicking and fighting while being choked by Met 
outfielder Darryl Strawberry. You had Padre catcher Mark Parent and Met third 
baseman Howard Johnson grappling. You had Stephenson and Met catcher Mackey 
Sasser squaring off. You had Padre coaches Sandy Alomar and Greg Riddoch 
corralling Met pitcher John Franco. You had Padre outfielder Bip Roberts 
grabbing ahold of Met second baseman Gregg Jefferies. 
</P>
<P>
And somewhere in the middle of that mess was Joey Cora, all 5-feet-8, 150 
pounds of him, ready to take on the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to fight," Cora said, "because I'm not big enough do that kind of 
stuff. But when I made all those errors Saturday, and everybody picked me up, 
it was time for me to go help them. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone could have busted me up pretty good, but that was the risk I had to 
take." 
</P>
<P>
Who could blame the guys for having fun. You've got to remember, this is the 
Padres' first brawl since July 7, 1987, when Padre pitcher Eric Show beaned Cub 
outfielder Andre Dawson in Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I regret is that Jack (Clark) wasn't here," Pagliarulo said. 
"He would have loved this. He would have smoked someone." 
</P>
<P>
Clark, though, was back in San Diego, undergoing an operation at Scripps 
Hospital to repair his fractured left cheekbone. He would have been proud to 
see his boys in action, particularly the way they have come together as a team 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Twice, the Padres took leads Sunday against the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Twice, the Mets came back, the last on a seventh-inning homer by pitcher Dwight 
Gooden, his first in two years. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of succumbing, instead of saying it must be in the stars, the 
Padres put together their most explosive inning of the season, scoring six runs 
in the eighth inning. Joe Carter drove in two runs on a bases-loaded single, 
and Stephenson scored three more on a bases-loaded triple before scoring 
himself on Garry Templeton's single. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets were finished. They knew it. The Padres knew it. And certainly, Elster 
knew it. 
</P>
<P>
When Elster stepped up to the plate in the bottom of the eighth to face Harris, 
who came on in relief of Ed Whitson (4-3), he still was annoyed by his 
bases-loaded strikeout in the fifth inning. It was his strikeout that killed 
the Mets' rally in the fifth, and now, he had come to the realization that it 
cost them the game. 
</P>
<P>
Little did anyone know just how wild Harris would be. His first pitch was a 
slider, about two feet off the plate. The next pitch was a fastball inside. It 
also missed by another two feet. 
</P>
<P>
But this one caught Elster right in the middle of the back. Elster dropped to 
one knee, hesitated, then tossed aside his batting helmet while running toward 
the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Harris gestured with his hand, as if to say, 'Come on,' and lowered his body to 
the ground as Elster came in swinging. Both benches emptied, bodies started 
piling, and the bullpen ran into join the action. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I know how Craig Lefferts feels running from the bullpen," Padre reliever 
Mark Grant said. "I don't think I could do it. I was tired just getting there." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' main focus in getting to the mound was just rescuing Harris, who 
had bodies atop of him, and Strawberry's hands around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
"It was bad enough that Elster came to the mound," Harris said, "but all these 
guys started coming at me from all angles. I didn't even see what was going on 
because everyone was on top of me, and Strawberry had me around the neck. And I 
never even met Elster before today, but I sure got a warm welcome. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's nobody in the game I'm going to back up from. Nobody. If anyone 
wants to come to the mound, I'll fight them. I'll take on anyone. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It was ridiculous to think I was trying to hit him. Now, why would I be trying 
to hit him? We had a big lead. I just tried to throw a fastball in, and it got 
away from me." 
</P>
<P>
Said Padre Manager Jack McKeon: "Why in the world would we want to hit a .162 
hitter (actually .173) with an 8-2 lead. The last time up, I walked the guy in 
front of him to get to him. You're better off knocking Gooden down, he was 
hitting better than Elster." 
</P>
<P>
Elster, the only player who was ejected from the game, said: "The umpires have 
got to be stupid if they didn't think he threw at me intentionally. I don't 
mind getting hit, but I think he should have been gone, also. 
</P>
<P>
"It took some guts for Harris to throw at me. I wish some of our pitchers would 
do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, sir, it's been one wacky, zany week. It began with Pagliarulo criticizing 
an anonymous teammate, which turned out to be Tony Gwynn. Jack Clark, who 
already was on the disabled list with an inflamed disc in his lower back, 
suffered a pinched nerve in his back while putting on his socks. The Padres 
laid out their differences in the players-only portion of a clubhouse meeting, 
with Clark, Pagliarulo and Templeton ripping Gwynn; Templeton and Clark ripping 
Show; Pagliarulo ripping catcher Benito Santiago; Gwynn lashing back; and no 
one standing up for Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo and Gwynn had their own private meeting. Clark got hit in the face 
during infield practice by a ball thrown by pitcher Pat Clements. The Padres 
won two one-run games, and got bombed by 11 runs. 
</P>
<P>
And there was Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Without question, it was the weirdest, wildest, wackiest four days I've ever 
been involved in," Gwynn said. "I've seen it all. And I've seen a whole hell of 
a lot." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, along with the fact that no one stood up for Gwynn, deeply upset 
him. He couldn't sleep Thursday or Friday nights, and for the first time in his 
life, actually felt uncomfortable sitting in the Padre clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
He since has spent the past few days contemplating what his teammates said. 
Certainly, he does not agree with the assessment made by some of his teammates. 
Never has he played selfishly in his life, he says, and he's not about to start 
now. 
</P>
<P>
But at least, for the first time he thinks they had the team's best interest at 
heart, and that the purpose of the meeting was not to tear up his credibility 
as the league's finest hitter. 
</P>
<P>
'It's been tough, no question about it, it's been real tough," Gwynn said. "I 
went through the worst time in my life. There were things that were said that 
made me unhappy. I got my feelings hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing for me was to talk about it, I just had to think about it. I 
had to have time to look at everybody's point of view, not just mine, but my 
teammates', my wife's, and (agent) John Boggs'. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to ask myself, am I really like that? Am I really doing this? Maybe I 
should be more of a leader? Maybe I should talk more with the guys. 
</P>
<P>
"This is me speaking now, nobody else, and in retrospect, the meeting was good. 
It got us focused. Whatever it was, something was missing, and now we got it 
back." 
</P>
<P>
"I came here, and I didn't swing the bat well in these four games, but we won 
three of four games. And that takes precedence over everything else. I can say 
now that I feel good about myself, and I feel good about my team. 
</P>
<P>
"Now let's play ball and see if we can creep back into this thing." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ed Whitson's victory was his first at Shea Stadium since Aug, 31, 1984. "That 
was a whole lot of fun," he said. "This is a strange place, and a lot of 
strange things happen here, so it's nice to leave here feeling good for a 
change." . . . Joe Carter on his day at the plate, ending a one-for-20 slump. 
"It was my wife's birthday, and for some reason, it seems like I always hit a 
homer on her birthday. This is the fourth time I've hit one on her birthday. I 
felt good out there today, it's just a shame the brawl had to take precedence 
over everything." . . . After having four days of trade discussions with the 
Yankees, Padre Manager Jack McKeon said Sunday that the next move belongs to 
them. "They know what we want," McKeon said, "it's up to them to see if they're 
willing to do it."

BOOKS: Whether a tourist chooses Orange County this summer could depend on 
which guidebook he buys. . . . "Los Angeles Access" describes the county as "an 
earthly paradise of temperate climate, a shoreline of alternating smooth sandy 
beaches with majestic rocky promontories, green canyons, rolling hills and a 
feeling of suspended time." . . . But the "Let's Go" book blasts the county as 
"an immense grid" filled with "cookie-cutter copies: gas stations on every 
corner, supermarkets on every block, and other necessities of life provided at 
more malls, plazas, squares, centers and markets than any real city could 
handle." Steve Emmons

CAPIZZI, ENRIGHT TIED BUT TRAIL 'UNDECIDED' FOR D.A.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Appointed incumbent Michael R. Capizzi and Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. 
Enright are locked in a near-dead heat for the lead in the four-man district 
attorney's race, according to a Times Orange County poll. 
</P>
<P>
But a major factor in the race could be that nearly two-thirds of the 
registered voters polled remain undecided about which of the candidates will 
get their vote. 
</P>
<P>
Unless one of the candidates can capture a large majority of the undecided 
vote, the June 5 election for district attorney will result in a November 
runoff between the top two vote-getters. A candidate needs 50% plus one vote to 
win an office in June. 
</P>
<P>
The Times Orange County Poll shows Capizzi and Enright dead even at 12% among 
Orange County registered voters. Capizzi holds a slight edge, 16% to Enright's 
13%, among those polled who are considered more likely to vote on June 5. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Dist. Atty. Edgar A. Freeman, a close ally of Enright, was third in 
the polling at 8%, but he drops to 7% among likely voters. Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Thomas Avdeef, Capizzi's most vocal critic, was last among the candidates, at 
4%, dropping to 3% among likely voters. 
</P>
<P>
The telephone survey of 600 registered voters was conducted May 21 through 23 
by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates. The margin of error for a sample of this 
size is plus or minus 4%. 
</P>
<P>
Although Capizzi and Enright emerge at the top of the pack in the district 
attorney's race, the campaign so far is characterized mainly by the unusual 
number of voters who have no strong opinions. Sixty-four percent of the 
respondents said they did not know whom they would vote for, and even among 
those voters considered more likely to vote, 61% said they are undecided in the 
district's attorney's race. 
</P>
<P>
"Capizzi's lead over Enright among likely voters is really insignificant in 
view of the high number who haven't decided," said pollster Mark Baldassare. 
"Anyone (of the four) can still win this race." 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally in Orange County, the undecided vote has gone overwhelmingly to 
the incumbent in nonpartisan elections. But Baldassare said that may not be 
true in the district attorney's race because "Capizzi is not, strictly 
speaking, the incumbent." 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi was unanimously appointed by the Board of Supervisors on Jan. 2 to 
replace his mentor, Cecil Hicks. Hicks had already announced that he would 
retire at the end of his term in 1990 but then left early to accept a 
judgeship. Hicks gave his endorsement to Capizzi, his chief assistant, to 
replace him. 
</P>
<P>
Under the appointment, Capizzi's term of office runs through the end of 1990. 
The district attorney elected this year is to take office Jan. 1, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Avdeef, joined by Enright, tried to block the Capizzi appointment in the 
courts, claiming that the county supervisors did not have the authority to 
appoint a new district attorney. But the courts upheld the appointment. Avdeef 
claims that the appointment was a deliberate setup by Hicks and Capizzi to 
influence the outcome of the June 5 election, since the incumbent almost always 
has an edge. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi is allowed to run as the incumbent in the June 5 election but with an 
asterisk. Instead of stating on the ballot that he is district attorney, his 
ballot designation is "appointed Orange County district attorney." Some of his 
supporters fear that the distinction between Capizzi and the others may be lost 
in an alphabet soup of titles on the ballot. Enright runs as chief deputy, 
Freeman as assistant district attorney and Avdeef as a deputy. The meaning of 
those positions can be confusing. An assistant, for example, is higher in the 
office than a deputy, but lower than a chief deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Enright, who has made it clear that his realistic goal is to make it to a 
runoff with Capizzi, finds himself well-positioned as the campaign enters its 
final week. But with his sights set on a runoff, Enright's relationship with 
the other two Capizzi challengers has been paradoxical. He needs them to gather 
enough votes to make sure Capizzi comes up with less than the 50% that would 
win him the election outright in June. But Enright also needs the voters to set 
him apart from Freeman and Avdeef, to assure that he does make it to a runoff 
election. 
</P>
<P>
For Avdeef, the poll may bolster his contention that Capizzi's high spending -- 
he will probably pass the $200,000 mark, far more than all the others combined 
-- has not helped him much with the voters. But the poll also suggests that 
Avdeef's hard-hitting campaign has so far gathered very little strength of its 
own. 
</P>
<P>
Avdeef has said in speeches that morale in the office was low under the 
Hicks-Capizzi leadership. Yet in an endorsement vote by deputies in the office, 
Capizzi came in with 85%, and the other three a combined 5%. Avdeef said the 
vote was predetermined because deputies were afraid to buck the boss. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent Bar Assn. poll, Avdeef was the only candidate among the four to 
come in with more "unqualified" votes than a combination of "highly qualified" 
and "qualified" votes. By comparison, each of the other three candidates 
received the "unqualified" rating from less than 7% of the respondents to the 
Bar poll. Avdeef points out, however, that only 10% of the lawyers in the 
county responded to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
For Avdeef and Freeman to win, or make a runoff, results of the Times Orange 
County Poll suggest that they need to carve out a sizable portion of the 
undecided vote. But according to pollster Baldassare, any of the four could do 
it. "Most people don't even know who these candidates are," Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
One of those polled, Ralph L. Sasser of Anaheim, said he will look into the 
district attorney's race between now and June 5 before deciding whom to vote 
for. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone's been in office a long time, I generally vote to get him out," 
Sasser said. "But if this guy (Capizzi) hasn't been in there long, I probably 
wouldn't hold it against him. But I wouldn't necessarily vote for him either." 
</P>
<P>
For Capizzi to win the election outright in June, he has to count on voters 
knowing he is the current holder of the office, and then rely on tradition 
weighing in his favor, with voters such as R.F. Bosworth of Anaheim, one of 
those interviewed in the Times Orange County poll. 
</P>
<P>
"I like someone who keeps a low profile," Bosworth said. "This fellow (Capizzi) 
must be doing that because I've never heard of him. In a case like this, as 
long as I don't hear anything against him, and as long as he's got his ducks 
all lined up in a row, why change anything?"

How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
The Times Orange County Poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates. 
The telephone survey of 600 registered voters was conducted over three nights, 
ending Wednesday, using a random sample of listed and unlisted telephone 
numbers in Orange County. The margin of error for the entire sample is 
plus-or-minus 4%. That means it is 95% certain that the results are within 4 
percentage points of what they would be if all registered voters in Orange 
County were interviewed. For the subsample of 328 Republicans, the margin of 
error is 6 points. And for the 212 Democrats, it is 7 points.

GRIEVING FAMILY SAYS '73 LAOS CRASH DIDN'T KILL SON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kate Rothacker of Mission Viejo has had versions of the same dream off and on 
since 1973. In some, her brother Joe comes home on crutches. Sometimes, he 
comes home blind. Or, he comes home crazy. But he always comes home. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, no one knows exactly what happened to Joseph Matejov -- one of the 
2,303 American servicemen in Vietnam for whom the government has yet to 
account. 
</P>
<P>
For families of those men, today's Memorial Day remembrances only underscore 
the grief still emanating from an undeclared, unsuccessful war that left wounds 
so deep that scars have not formed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very emotional time for most of the families," said Judie Mills Taber 
of La Habra, California coordinator for the National League of Families of 
American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, an organization with a 
mailing list of 12,000. "We don't know if they've given their lives or not." 
</P>
<P>
Matejov's case is particularly difficult because his family insists that they 
have found evidence that he was captured alive -- despite a U.S. Air Force 
declaration that he had been killed when his EC47 plane was shot down Feb. 5, 
1973, over Laos. 
</P>
<P>
All nine brothers and sisters in the devoutly Catholic, military family firmly 
believe that Joe Matejov -- a handsome, popular 21-year old when he vanished -- 
is still alive after 17 years, Rothacker said. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has said he is dead," said Rothacker, 35, a homemaker and mother of 
four. She wears two POW bracelets, one with Joe's name and one for another 
missing soldier. POW signs are pasted on the windows of her home and station 
wagon. 
</P>
<P>
Her children include prayers for Uncle Joe around the family dinner table. 
</P>
<P>
Kate Rothacker remembers her brother as generous, considerate, handsome and 
hard working. "He was every mother's dream." Once, he took her shopping to buy 
himself a clock radio but kept asking which one she preferred, ultimately 
asking her to keep it for him. "In effect, he was giving me a present." 
</P>
<P>
Rothacker was 18 when a U.S. Air Force representative knocked on the door of 
their East Meadow, N.Y., home to say that Joe had been killed during an 
intelligence-gathering mission over Laos -- eight days after the signing of the 
Paris Peace Accords. The officials said he had died instantly with seven others 
when their plane was shot down and disintegrated. 
</P>
<P>
They held a memorial service. 
</P>
<P>
Then, five years later, the family began to hear other accounts -- first 
reported by columnist Jack Anderson on "Good Morning America" -- that four of 
the eight men, including Joe Matejov, had bailed out of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Because one crew member's personal effects included a letter suggesting that 
their mission broke the new peace treaty, it was hinted that the United States 
had tried to cover up a possibly illegal spy mission, Rothacker said. 
</P>
<P>
In his service record, Joe's parents, Mary and Stephen Matejov, found Air Force 
transcripts of intercepted enemy radio transmissions describing "air pirates" 
captured the day of the crash in the area and where they were being taken. 
Pentagon officials said descriptions of the prisoners described in the 
transcripts do not match Matejov or other crew members. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Mary Matejov said, she and her husband were told six or seven years 
ago by Roger Shields, who was deputy assistant secretary of defense in charge 
of POW/MIA affairs at the time of the crew's disappearance, that the four 
missing crew members were intentionally listed as dead in order to protect 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he was afraid the Vietnamese might say, 'This plane was flying; you 
broke the treaty; we don't have to return the men,' " she said from her 
Hampton, Va., home. 
</P>
<P>
Shields, now chief international economist with Chemical Bank in New York, 
denied telling the Matejovs their son was alive and was deliberately declared 
dead. He said there was no reason to cover up the flight, which was legal. 
</P>
<P>
However, based on the radio intercepts, he had opposed the Air Force 
secretary's finding that the crew died in the crash and still believes that 
declaring them dead was a mistake, he said in a telephone interview last week 
from London. 
</P>
<P>
He said he strongly suspects that they were captured because the date of the 
"air pirate" transmission was the same as the crash, there were very few planes 
in the area at the time and the broadcast was beamed directly to Hanoi from not 
farther than 60 miles from the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Air Force was wrong, but the judgment was not made out of malice. 
It was not part of a conspiracy. As far as I know, no one ever lied to her. The 
Air Force secretary has a right to make those calls. In their judgment, he was 
dead. I dispute the judgment; she disputes the judgment. A (bad) judgment does 
not amount to a lie." 
</P>
<P>
Had they been declared missing, he said, "efforts to find them might have gone 
on in a different vein." 
</P>
<P>
"She's right to feel there's more information available, but whether that means 
her son is alive is another issue." 
</P>
<P>
Shields said that he has no hope that the crew members are still alive but 
believes that families such as the Matejovs "deserve massive amounts of 
sympathy." 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Edward Lundquist said: "There is no evidence that 
any crew members survived the crash and no evidence that any crew members were 
captured by enemy forces." He said the plane plunged, bounced once, landed 
upside down and burned. 
</P>
<P>
A search party four days after the crash was not able to lift the fuselage to 
look for remains, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would not comment on the cover-up issue because facts of the case 
were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
Since the fall of Saigon in 1975, there have been 11,754 reports of POWs or 
MIAs, and the Pentagon continues to receive about a dozen reports a month, 
Lundquist said. The vast majority have been accounted for, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Only 131 of the 2,303 unresolved cases involve first-hand reports of "live 
sightings," he said. Of those, 76 were held under guard when seen and 55 were 
reported to be living in "non-captive" situations such as with a Vietnamese 
family in a village. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the government has been unable to prove that any Americans are being 
detained against their will in Southeast Asia, Lundquist said. But since 1981, 
official government policy precludes ruling out the possibility, and roughly 
100 people are employed full time to investigate cases under the assumption 
that some are still alive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an unrealistic expectation that we will be able to account for all of 
them," he said. In World War II, 78,750 servicemen (or 18% of all those who 
served) remain unaccounted for, as well as 8,177 (15%) from the Korean War. In 
Vietnam, 4% remain unaccounted for. 
</P>
<P>
Matejov is not among the high-priority cases, a ranking created to facilitate 
recovery efforts with Vietnam, Lundquist said. Those are cases of 80 Americans 
for whom there is "strong evidence that they survived their incident and were 
captured, or otherwise came under control of the Indochinese governments or 
about whom those governments should have information. Yet neither these men, 
nor their remains have been returned," Lundquist said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Matejov's name has been submitted seven times, most recently in 
February of this year, to the Joint Casualty Resolution Center, at Barber's 
Point Naval Air Station in Hawaii, which mounts investigations with Southeast 
Asian governments. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Lao government has rejected the request for unknown reasons. The 
most recent request is unanswered, said George Atkinson, chief of Air Force 
Missing Persons. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of expeditions, the Air Force retrieved the remains of 42 people 
last year -- a far greater number than in any one year so far since the war, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think families understand how much work has been done," he said. "It's 
a personal thing with them." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Matejov and her daughter, Kate Rothacker, speak on the issue, hoping to 
galvanize public opinion and spur greater government efforts to find prisoners. 
And they pray -- though Rothacker said she is sometimes unsure what to pray 
for. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect him to come home completely normal," his mother said. "I 
imagine he would be hospitalized for quite some time. I do believe they might 
have played with his mind. I'm prepared for that. . . . He may have been given 
a family. If he's got a family, bring them here. They're welcome too. 
</P>
<P>
"I want him home where he belongs. He belongs on American soil. He doesn't 
belong over there." 
</P>
<P>
One of the hardest parts for the family has been a loss of faith in a 
government to which it had been devoted. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Matejov's husband, who died in 1984, was a career Army officer. Others in 
her family have served in the Marines, the Navy and the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
But because they believe that the government lied about Joe, her two youngest 
sons said they would join the service only if drafted. 
</P>
<P>
"When we thought he was dead, we felt we were one of the families that had to 
have the pain," Mary Matejov said. "That happens in war time. We accepted it. 
It was his career. Somebody's going to be killed. 
</P>
<P>
"When we found out the truth, it was like somebody sticking a knife in and 
twisting it. At first we didn't believe it. It was hard for my husband to 
believe in the beginning, until we saw the radio intercepts." 
</P>
<P>
Said Rothacker, whose husband is a former Marine, "The feeling I have is of 
betrayal. We had faith in the government. What would you do if your mom stabbed 
you in the back?" 
</P>
<P>
Jack Anderson, whose broadcast changed the focus of the family's lives, cannot 
remember specifics of his report, other than that his information came from 
sources inside the Pentagon or the CIA. "Washington tells the public one story, 
we tried to tell a different story -- the one that has been suppressed." 
</P>
<P>
Joe's mother and sister say faith keeps them going in their efforts to bring 
live prisoners home. "Sometimes I get quite tired," Mary Matejov said. "I do 
want to quit, and yet I don't. I just can't. 
</P>
<P>
"Until my last breath I can't quit. I have to know the answer. I can't just 
leave it hanging and not know." 
</P>
<P>
Kate hasn't dreamed of Joe for several years now. The last time, she awoke less 
startled at having seen him than of having had the same dream once again after 
all these years. 
</P>
<P>
In it as in all the others, she and her mother meet Joe at the door. And she 
tells him: "I knew you'd come home."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CITY SEEKS FUNDS FOR HOME REHABILITATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council is seeking special state funding to provide low-interest loans 
to help low- and moderate-income families make improvements to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It would give an opportunity to furnish more loans for people in the city," 
said May Hui, acting director of developmental services. 
</P>
<P>
The city is applying for more than $287,000 in funds from the state's Housing 
Rehabilitation program. If approved, the money would be available for 
improvements such as room additions and new roofs. 
</P>
<P>
The money would enable the city to make about 20 loans of about $20,000 each at 
an interest rate of 3%. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the city offers loans for rehabilitation projects to only low-income 
borrowers. Hui said the city will be notified within the next 30 days about 
whether the funding has been approved. LYNDA NATALI

COUNCIL PAY-RAISE ISSUE ON JUNE BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE NICOLOSI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voters will decide June 5 whether City Council members will get their first pay 
raise in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
The council is asking voters to raise their monthly salaries from $125 to $300. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Frank Laszlo asked the council last fall to put the item on the June 
ballot, saying that council members were spending too much of their money to do 
the work required of them. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to spend your own money running the city," Laszlo said. 
"Expenses have gone up, and the salaries haven't." He estimated that it costs 
him about $300 a month to be a councilman. 
</P>
<P>
A recent survey showed that council salaries in Seal Beach rank next to last in 
Orange County. Villa Park, with a population of 7,000, is last, Laszlo said. 
</P>
<P>
Voters must decide the issue because the raise requires an amendment to the 
City Charter. The document, written in 1964, makes no provision for council pay 
raises. If passed, the initiative will amend the charter so that the council 
salaries conform with those set by the State of California Government Code. The 
code, which sets salary standards for cities without charters, states that 
cities with fewer than 35,000 residents should pay council members $300 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"All the other cities are up to a $300 minimum, many are paying closer to ($700 
or $800)," said Laszlo. 
</P>
<P>
But not all council members believe that getting a pay raise is important or 
necessary. "It would be nice," said Marilyn Bruce Hastings. "If we do, fine, if 
we don't, fine. It's not a big item to me." MICHELLE NICOLOSI

THOUSANDS OBSERVE BUDDHA'S BIRTHDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dozen Buddhist monks in gold robes filed onto a stage at Golden West College 
and stood before a makeshift altar, while one voice wailed a hypnotic 
incantation and a single drum sounded a slow, mesmerizing beat. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Vietnamese-Americans gathered Sunday on a grassy area to watch and 
pray, celebrating Ngay Hoy Phat Dan, or Buddha's Birthday Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by 27 Southland Buddhist temples and organizations, the festival was 
the first of its kind in the United States, said Le Khac Ly of Huntington 
Beach, who coordinated the event with Huu Dinh Vo, a physician from Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Festival organizers estimated that 6,000 to 10,000 Vietnamese-Americans from 
throughout Southern California attended the event in recognition of Buddha's 
2,534th birthday. Le and Huu said they hope that Sunday's event -- with 
religious rites, educational exposition, a food fair and celebration in the 
park -- will become an annual event. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had this dream for a long, long time," Le said. "We've been waiting for 
this opportunity to . . . unify all kinds of communities, for doctors, workers 
and people of all professions and political parties to meet in celebration." 
</P>
<P>
On stage, each monk lighted a candle and knelt. The ceremony symbolized the 
sharing of Buddha's light and energy. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, others bought platefuls of Vietnamese food or browsed through 
display booths featuring books, statues and plaques devoted to Buddha, while 
children played on an air mattress in the likeness of Humpty Dumpty. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Vietnamese began immigrating here en masse, each Buddhist temple has 
held individual birthday ceremonies each year. But they have never joined in a 
celebration, Le said. 
</P>
<P>
Underlying the event, Le said, is a political agenda. By staging such 
gatherings of Vietnamese-Americans, Huu and Le said they hope to demonstrate 
solidarity for the anti-communism movement in their native country. 
</P>
<P>
"Our big dream is for this to get bigger every year, and one day, we hope to 
return to our homeland in Vietnam and celebrate Buddha's birthday in our 
country," Huu said. "And this is the first step."JOHN PENNER

POLICE OFFICER HARCO HAS HAD HIS DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police Officer Keith Chang had seen his partner's retirement coming for some 
time. The first sign came when Chang had to help his partner scale a fence by 
giving him a little push over the top. 
</P>
<P>
But when the 75-pound Harco, one of Brea's first police dogs, started waiting 
at fences so Chang could carry him over, he knew it was time to hang up Harco's 
leash. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month Harco was honored by the City Council and officially 
retired. With a bad back, infected ears and weakening legs, the 10-year-old 
Harco can no longer chase suspects. 
</P>
<P>
During his 5 1/2 years on the force, Harco, a German shepherd, was responsible 
for finding $2 million in drug money, 80 kilograms of cocaine and 2 kilograms 
of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
The city also credits Harco with searching 239 buildings and being instrumental 
in eight arrests. 
</P>
<P>
But more significant, Chang said, was the dog's impact as a deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't count the number of times an incident has been avoided purely because 
of his presence," Chang said. "We've had a number of suspects give up when we 
told them we were sending in Harco." 
</P>
<P>
Harco's teeth proved to be powerful persuaders, but it is the dog's nose that 
Chang admires the most. 
</P>
<P>
"He would never cease looking until he found what he was tracking," Chang said. 
"His ability to track was incredible." 
</P>
<P>
It took Chang, an officer for 20 years, some time before he would rely on that 
ability -- and Harco's other training -- when making decisions in the field. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, Harco indicated to Chang that suspects and stolen property were 
outside the area Chang and other officers had decided to search. 
</P>
<P>
Chang ignored the dog, but after giving up the search he let Harco satisfy his 
curiosity. The suspects and the stolen property were quickly discovered. 
</P>
<P>
"I was used to working the streets alone, and it was difficult to rely on a 
dog, who you can't reason with," Chang said. "But I got better at it as the 
years went by." 
</P>
<P>
Harco was teamed with Chang five years ago as one of Brea's first two canine 
units. 
</P>
<P>
Imported from Germany, the dog was 4 1/2 years old and had undergone obedience, 
protection and tracking training since he was a puppy. 
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in Brea, Harco underwent 160 hours of training with Chang in 
Riverside. To build and strengthen the bond between the team, Harco moved in 
with Chang, where he will continue to live. 
</P>
<P>
Like many retirees before him, Harco has not had an easy time adjusting to long 
days of leisure. To make matters worse, Harco has had to watch Chang and his 
new partner, Kit, leave for work each day. 
</P>
<P>
"When he hears the (police car) start up, he wants to come with me. He's a 
little jealous of his replacement," Chang said. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

2-CAR COLLISION KILLS WOMAN, 19 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 19-year-old Buena Park woman was thrown from a car and killed when two 
vehicles collided at an intersection just south of Cal State Fullerton early 
Sunday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was identified as Heather Vigil, coroner's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Two others injured in the 3:27 a.m. crash were taken to St. Jude Hospital and 
Rehabilitation Center for treatment, police said. Kimberly Avery, 20, of 
Fullerton was hospitalized with a minor skull fracture and Ronnie Williams, 35, 
of Brea was treated for minor cuts and released. 
</P>
<P>
The collision occurred at the intersection of State College Boulevard and 
Chapman Avenue when the westbound car carrying the two women hit Williams' 
northbound car, Fullerton Police Sgt. Neal Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin said it appears likely that one of the two drivers ran a stop light. 
Investigators were still trying to determine which woman was driving at the 
time of the accident, he said.

NITRATE LEVEL UP, BOOSTS ALGAE GROWTH

NEWPORT BEACH

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Warm temperatures have brought out more than bikers and joggers along Upper 
Newport Bay this season. A new stretch of green algae has crept up, bringing 
with it a stench that has residents complaining. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the worst I've seen it," said Dan Weymouth as he stopped for 
a break from jogging along Jamboree Road where it crosses over the San Diego 
Creek Channel. Weymouth said he has lived in the area for seven years and jogs 
almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll probably find another route until this thing goes away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is not only an aesthetic one for the residents and businesses 
bordering the bay, but could also pose a health threat to the fish there, 
according to the state Water Quality Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
"It can deplete the dissolved oxygen in the water and hurt the fish and 
wildlife in the area," said Hope Smythe, an environmental specialist with the 
state agency. 
</P>
<P>
Although the algae is present throughout the year, low water levels and high 
temperatures at this time of year increase the algae growth, Smythe said. 
</P>
<P>
The most likely culprit are nurseries and other agricultural users along the 
San Diego Creek, whose runoff of fertilizers spawns the growth. Since 1986, the 
state has regulated the amount of nutrients those users discharge. 
</P>
<P>
"Our data is telling us that the nitrate concentrations are as much as 10 times 
greater than any of the other channels, and that's exceedingly high," said Lane 
Waldner, supervisor of environmental studies with the county Environmental 
Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Water samples from the upper and lower bay show that there are 100 milligrams 
of nitrates per liter, compared to the 10-year average of 60 milligrams per 
liter, Waldner said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the drastic increase in algae this year, the state and county 
agencies will team up to test the water at four different sites along channels 
of the creek for other sources of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that we're thinking is it might be rising ground water that 
is heavy in nitrates," Smythe said, adding that development in the Irvine area 
may be causing the ground water to rise. 
</P>
<P>
Waldner suggested that the problem also may stem from the rise of the perched 
water table which is just below the surface and can contain a high level of 
nitrates. 
</P>
<P>
If the source is an agricultural user, the state can enforce more 
water-efficient methods of irrigation which reduce the amount of overflow from 
the fields, Waldner said. Many nurseries and orchards along the creek have 
installed drip irrigation systems to achieve this, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Prevention is the only way to keep the high concentrations of nitrates out of 
the bay, Waldner said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing that we can really do," he said. "It's not like you have 
another chemical that you can go in there and treat it with." 
</P>
<P>
Fish and other wildlife may be threatened if the algae continues to grow at a 
high rate, dies off and becomes food for bacteria that feed off of it at the 
bottom of the bay, Waldner said. The bacteria use up oxygen that is essential 
for the fish.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / 72ND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
YUDELSON DONATIONS MOSTLY FROM L.A. COUNTY 
</P>

<P>
Jerry Yudelson, who has campaigned as the Democrat with the deepest roots in 
central Orange County's 72nd Assembly District, received most of his 
contributions over the past two months from Los Angeles County, according to 
campaign finance statements. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the money that Yudelson raised in the two-month period ended May 19 
came from the entertainment community, in which his wife has worked as an 
actress. 
</P>
<P>
Several celebrities are on the contribution list, including Leonard Nimoy, 
James Brolin, Alan Rachins, Corbin Bernson, Gary Busey and Peggy Lipton Jones. 
Rachins, who stars with Bernson on the television show "L.A. Law," hosted a 
fund-raiser for Yudelson at his home in Pacific Palisades earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just that this is not a wealthy district," Yudelson said Saturday. "If 
you get 10% of your money out of this district, or 5%, you'd be doing good." 
</P>
<P>
Yudelson reported that he received almost $15,000 in contributions of more than 
$100 each. Of that amount, less than $1,000 came from within the 72nd District. 
</P>
<P>
Yudelson said most of his contributions of less than $100 are from within the 
district. Election laws do not require a candidate to disclose the identity of 
small donors, and Yudelson declined to release his list. 
</P>
<P>
Yudelson reported $6,025 in small donations. With his larger donations and 
non-monetary contributions, he reported just over $27,000 raised during the 
two-month period. 
</P>
<P>
The major theme of Yudelson's campaign has been to compare his activities and 
ties within the district to those of his Democratic primary opponent, Tom 
Umberg. Umberg moved into the district from Irvine earlier this year to 
campaign for the seat held by Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
The predominantly Democratic district includes parts of the cities of Garden 
Grove, Santa Ana, Stanton, Anaheim and Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of carpetbagging looms as a theme that may carry through the general 
election, since Pringle has lived in Garden Grove for 22 years and Yudelson 
moved into the area shortly before his 1988 campaign against Rep. Robert K. 
Dornan (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
"You have the choice between two carpetbaggers," Pringle said. "I've lived 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Yudelson said the contributions he received from Los Angeles came largely 
because of his background as an environmentalist. He is an energy conservation 
consultant and was appointed to the state Solar Business Office in 1978 by 
then-Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest theme has been the environment, and there are a tremendous number 
of people interested in air pollution looking to pick up a vote in the Assembly 
on environmental issues," Yudelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Umberg, a former federal prosecutor, has emphasized a tough-on-crime campaign 
theme, and the bulk of his contributions in the recent two months came from 
lawyers. Umberg also received most of his money from outside the district, 
although his report included slightly more district donations than Yudelson's. 
</P>
<P>
Umberg had raised a total of about $49,000 during the period, including $1,155 
in non-monetary contributions and $4,700 in donations under $100. 
</P>
<P>
Umberg was not available for comment on Sunday.

THOMPSON REBOUNDS FOR EASY VICTORY IN IRVINE; 
</P>
<P>
BIATHLON: ENCINITAS RUNNER MAKES UP FOR LAST-PLACE FINISH IN HIS LAST RACE. 
DOWNING WINS WOMEN'S TITLE AGAIN.

<P>
Joel Thompson, after finishing last in his division in his last race, finished 
two minutes ahead of the pack Sunday when the Coors Light Biathlon Series came 
to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old professional biathlete from Encinitas, finished the 
approximately five-kilometer run, 30-kilometer bicycle course and another 
five-kilometer run in 1:09.39. Race officials thought he had broken the Series 
record until the run and bicycle courses were found to be slightly shorter than 
the standard distances. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said he was able to improve during the last week since his 
disappointing finish in Houston by "relaxing." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd done the work," Thompson said. "I just thought I was over the edge. . . . 
I was trying to do a little bit too much. I finally just rested. I knew I was 
set, based on some workouts I'd done, but after last week I was sure beginning 
to wonder." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson's time in Houston was 1:18.46. 
</P>
<P>
Liz Downing, the 1989 Coors Light Series champion from Portland, Ore., won the 
women's elite division for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Downing, who finished in 1:18.56, attributed her victory Sunday and her 
two-year dominance of the biathlon series to her ability as a cyclist. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's just that I'm a little stronger on the bike than the other 
women," she said. "Because a lot of them are pretty decent runners and I'm not 
a great runner. . . . I think it's just that I've been able to put a little 
time on them on the bike." 
</P>
<P>
Downing also said the course around the El Toro Marine Corp Air Station 
complemented her racing style. "The course, I guess, is a little bit easier 
because you can't see who's in front of you very far because you have so many 
corners," she said. "Sometimes, if you're out of sight, it helps a little bit. 
So I always run scared, try to get around the next corner." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson and Downing will each receive $10,000 for their victories. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson was followed by Brent Steiner (Tempe, Ariz.), 1:11.53; Greg Welch (San 
Diego), 1:11.54, and Matt Gary (Roseville, Calif.), 1:11.59, in the men's elite 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Steiner, Welch and Gary also finished the first run and the bicycle race fairly 
close together. "They were there all the way," Steiner said. "On the bikes, 
Matt (Gary) and I were together. Greg (Welch) kind of slipped a bit in the 
bikes, I think. But he came back in the second run great." 
</P>
<P>
Other county finishers in the men's top 40 were No. 5 Greg Brown (Balboa 
Island), 1:11.54; No. 8 Darren Wood (Newport Beach), 1:13.03; No. 9 Eric 
Squires (Laguna Niguel), 1:13.22; No. 19 Ray Webb (Anaheim Hills), 1:16.36; No. 
22 Jeff Montgomery (Huntington Beach), 1:17.29; No. 31 John Brazelton (Newport 
Beach), 1:18.37, and No. 39 Jim Van Sickle (Laguna Beach) 1:19.36. 
</P>
<P>
George Pierce, the 1989 Coors Light men's champion from Thousand Oaks, was 
disqualified for drafting. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Landerville, a Seattle runner in her second-ever biathlon, took second 
place in the women's elite division in 1:20:27. 
</P>
<P>
Landerville gave Downing a scare on the bicycle course. "That one girl who was 
in second -- I didn't know who she was," Downing said. "She wasn't very far 
behind me. I said, 'Jeez! Either she's really good or I'm really hurting.' " 
</P>
<P>
Landerville was followed by Melissa Mantak (Denver), 1:21:06; Kimberly Cohen 
(Greenwich, Conn.), 1:23:21, and Catherine Donovan (Santa Monica), 1:24:09. 
</P>
<P>
Other county finishers in the women's top 40 were No. 13 Suzanne Ferguson (Dana 
Point), 1:29.12; No. 15 Marilyn Sanahl (Orange), 1:31.14; No. 18 Jeannette 
Gueffroy (Santa Ana), 1:32.42; No. 20 Sue E. Davis (Costa Mesa), 1:33.13; No. 
23 Julie Pizzarello (Santa Ana), 1:34.10; No. 26 Christina Rudd (Newport 
Beach), 1:35.44; No. 30 Dawn Braund (Laguna Beach), 1:36.20; No. 33 Margie Dana 
(Mission Viejo), 1:37.24; No. 34 Valerie McCutchan (Costa Mesa), 1:37.33, and 
No. 35 Ursula Hill (Santa Ana), 1:38.08. 
</P>
<P>
The race was completed by 674 professional and amateur biathletes.

PREP REVIEW;

EL TORO'S DAVID FAIR HAS NEVER MET A CHALLENGE HE DIDN'T TAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He's been known to dive out of trees like Tarzan, leap over five-foot-high 
fences on a whim and hurdle the back end of pickups. 
</P>
<P>
If there was ever a competition for crazy, spontaneous stunts, David Fair of El 
Toro High School would probably win. 
</P>
<P>
Fair demonstrates his daring in the world of track and field, where he has 
performed impressively. 
</P>
<P>
Fair, a senior 300-meter intermediate hurdler, qualified for this week's state 
track and field championships by placing fourth in the Masters meet Friday. His 
time of 38.46 seconds is the fastest in the county this year. 
</P>
<P>
Most impressive, however, is the fact that until this year, Fair had never 
competed in the hurdles. Last year, he competed in the 200, 400 and high jump. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my character, pretty much," Fair said. "I got bored of the 400, so I 
wanted to try something else. . . . I thought I could hurdle, but I wasn't 
sure. My problem is that where other guys go over the hurdle with a set 
(specific) foot, and know exactly how many steps they're going to take between 
each hurdle, I'm going sometimes with my right, sometimes with my left, 
sometimes with 14 steps, sometimes with 15. . . . That part of it gets 
frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
But being new to an event is nothing new to Fair. Last May, on the advice of El 
Toro Coach Rick Hagin, Fair entered his first decathlon competition at Mt. San 
Antonio College. 
</P>
<P>
Though Fair had little experience with most of the 10 events, he won the 
competition, scoring 5,512 points (ninth-best on the county's all-time prep 
list and second-best in the state in 1989). 
</P>
<P>
"David never pole vaulted before the Mt. SAC decathlon," said his father, Jerry 
Fair. "He didn't even know (about the competition) until four days before. He 
came home and said, 'Dad, can you take me to this decathlon at Mt. SAC this 
weekend?' I said, 'Sure. But do you even know what events are in the 
decathlon?' He said no, so we went through them all that night. 
</P>
<P>
"We never had any dreams he would win it; it was crazy to even think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Fair is one of eight decathletes -- and the only one from California -- 
invited to compete in the prestigious Golden West Invitational, June 7-10 at 
Cal State Sacramento. The meet brings in the top eight seniors in the nation in 
each event for a four-day, all-expenses-paid trip. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Fair has not competed in another decathlon, nor has had time to 
practice the shotput, discus, javelin, etc., Golden West officials told him 
that his 5,512 point total was proof enough of his talent. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Mt. SAC meet, Fair had never tried the pole vault. He was given 
about an hour to practice before the competition. 
</P>
<P>
"He watched a couple of boys do it, and ended up going (10 feet 4 inches)," 
Jerry Fair said. "He hasn't pole vaulted since then, though. He's been too busy 
trying to get to the state meet in the hurdles." 
</P>
<P>
Fair, who also holds school records in the 110 high hurdles (15.02) and the 400 
(49.8), "can do anything if he puts his mind to it," Hagin said. 
</P>
<P>
"He learns quickly and isn't afraid of anything," Hagin said. "I could see him 
vaulting 14 feet in a month or two without much of a problem. That's the kind 
of athlete he is." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, he's also the kind of athlete some might describe as foolhardy. 
</P>
<P>
"He does do strange things," Hagin said. "We were waiting for our bus after 
this meet at Irvine (High School) and suddenly he just jumps out of a tree. He 
does this weird thing where he falls and grabs the branches, and then says 'O, 
I do that all the time.' " 
</P>
<P>
Said Fair: "You just climb way up in this tree and jump. You let yourself fall, 
and the boughs kind of catch you. You can get pretty scraped up, but I've never 
really gotten hurt. . . . I'm not that crazy. I make sure I can do it first -- 
or at least I make sure I think I can." 
</P>
<P>
Fair, who plays piano and guitar, won an El Toro talent show this year -- "He 
sung a song he wrote about a girl who got involved with an older man and had 
her heart broken," Jerry Fair said. 
</P>
<P>
When he found out he won, Fair was so happy he sprinted out to the school 
parking lot and hurdled the back end of a pickup. 
</P>
<P>
For Fair, a fitting celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Final meeting: In March of last year, Tim Martin, then an unheralded sophomore 
at San Clemente, upset one of the top sprinters in the Southern Section not 
once but three times during a nonleague meet at San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
The sprinters name? Erik Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
Before he moved to Los Alamitos with his family last June, Mitchell was a 
football and track standout at Mayfair High in Lakewood. At Mayfair, Mitchell 
won the 2-A title in the 100 and 200. 
</P>
<P>
Since moving across the county line, Mitchell has given Martin -- the county's 
fastest boy last year -- his share of challenges. The two have gone back and 
forth all season, including Friday night at the Southern Section Masters meet. 
There, Martin got the better of Mitchell in the 100, but just barely -- Martin 
was third in 10.70, Mitchell was fourth in 10.71. Later, Mitchell outran Martin 
in the 200, placing second to Martin's sixth, 21.34 to 21.80. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend at the state championships, the two will have one last showdown. 
Mitchell, a Colorado-bound senior, and Martin, a junior, will run against each 
other in the 100 if both make it through Friday night's qualifying heats. 
(Mitchell also will run the 200, but Martin did not advance in that event). 
</P>
<P>
Asked if it is important to finish the season as the county's fastest boy, both 
were nonchalant. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter to me; I just want to win," Martin said. "I don't want to be 
making any enemies." 
</P>
<P>
Said Mitchell: "Nah, it doesn't matter. I don't really think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Record-bound? University's Tanja Brix and Katella's Martha Pinto both ran 
personal bests in the girls' 3,200 meters at the Masters meet Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Brix, who led the county last year with a time of 10:54.64, finished third in 
10:50.10. Pinto, whose previous best was 10:55, took fifth in 10:51.29. 
</P>
<P>
Brix, a sophomore, and Pinto, a junior, are the only county girls to run under 
11 minutes in the 3,200 since Buffy Rabbitt, now at UC Irvine, ran 10:42.16 
while at Newport Harbor High in 1986. Only 25 county girls have broken the 
11-minute barrier. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the state meet -- and one of the fastest 3,200 meter fields in years 
-- coming their way Saturday, Brix and Pinto will have an opportunity to run 
even faster. 
</P>
<P>
Though breaking one of the oldest county records -- 10:29.03, set by 
University's Teresa Barrios in 1982 -- may have to wait a few more years, 
Orange County girls' distance running may be returning to the high level of 
years past. 
</P>
<P>
Bad timing: A crew from ESPN's Scholastic Sports America came to SeaCliff 
Tennis Club in Huntington Beach Saturday to film what turned out to be Jon 
Leach's final high school match. 
</P>
<P>
Leach, a junior at Laguna Beach, lost to Ari Nathan of Brentwood, 5-7, 6-3, 
7-5, in the semifinals of the Southern Section singles tournament. He plans to 
graduate from Laguna Beach in January and play for his father, Dick, at USC. 
</P>
<P>
His departure leaves a void, in more ways than one, for Laguna Beach Coach Bob 
Walton. 
</P>
<P>
In his three seasons, Leach was one of the county's most dominant players. This 
season, he won 63 consecutive sets in team play as Laguna Beach advanced to the 
semifinals of the 3-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time there will be no Leach for Walton to coach. He 
coached Jon for three seasons, sister Mindy for four and was the junior varsity 
coach when older brother, Rick, was playing for the Artists. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be weird for me next year," Walton said. "I'm probably going to 
write 'Leach' into the lineup card automatically. And there won't be a Leach 
(playing)." 
</P>
<P>
Walton and the rest of the country can watch Leach play as a high-schooler one 
last time when ESPN airs the segment some time in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Hoop horizons: Dave Zirkle, director of the Orange Holiday basketball 
tournament, has expanded the field of one of the county's top tournaments to 
include a Canadian team and two schools from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Bev Facey Composite, which won the provincial title of Alberta, has entered the 
tournament scheduled for Dec. 26-29 in Chapman College's Hutton Sports Center. 
Sammamish High of Seattle, the runner-up in Washington's state tournament, is 
also entered along with Kent Merdian of Kent, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Zirkle has also added San Francisco Archbishop Riordan, runner-up to Mater Dei 
in the State Division I tournament, and San Diego Lincoln Prep, the 3-A 
division champion in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
State champion Mater Dei and Division IV champion Santa Clara of Oxnard are the 
co-favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County high school track and field programs will be the chief 
beneficiary of proceeds raised by the Newport 5K Walk &amp; Run, Sunday at 8 
a.m. All proceeds from the race, which starts at the intersection of Jamboree 
Boulevard and Campus Drive in Newport Beach, will go toward sponsoring 
underprivileged athletes, funding summer training programs and providing

L.A. Harbor College held off a ninth-inning rally to defeat Chabot, 10-9, 
Sunday to advance to today's championship of the state community college 
baseball tournament at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor led, 10-5, to start the ninth, when Chabot's Corey Quinn led off with a 
double. 
</P>
<P>
He scored on a single by Brian Thompson. A single by Barney Dion chased Harbor 
starter Pat Ahearne, who was replaced by Chico Limas. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Ledesma lined a three-run home run off the scoreboard to cut the lead to 
10-9. Limas got Chad Burns to fly out for the first out before being replaced 
by John Ingram, who got the game's final two outs. 
</P>
<P>
Chabot (43-11) also reached today's championship game by defeating Santa Rosa, 
18-6, later Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Chabot and Harbor meet again today at 11, with Chabot having to win twice for 
the title. A second game would follow, if necessary. Harbor (50-5) last won the 
state title in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The ninth-inning home run Sunday was the 10th consecutive time Ledesma had 
reached base safely in the tournament. His streak grew to 11 when he walked in 
his first at-bat against Santa Rosa (32-19), but he flied out in the third 
inning. Ledesma is nine for 12 with two home runs, three doubles, 10 runs 
scored and 10 RBIs in three tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Rosa defeated Riverside, 11-5, earlier Sunday to eliminate the Tigers 
(32-17) from the tournament. STEVE KRESAL

<P>
Pinch-runner Dina Lopez scored on a wild pitch to give Fresno State a 1-0 
victory over UCLA Sunday night at Oklahoma City, forcing a second and deciding 
championship game at the NCAA softball World Series. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA took a 1-0 lead in the second game, which was postponed by rain in the 
third inning late Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Play is set to resume today at 10 a.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, Lopez scored from third base after Lisa Longaker (20-2) 
threw a wild pitch. Longaker had pitched a perfect game for six innings. Winner 
Terry Carpenter (22-7) gave up only two hits. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State (62-14) defeated Oklahoma State, 1-0, earlier Sunday to reach the 
finals of the double-elimination tournament. The teams played just one inning 
Sunday to complete a game rained out after nine innings late Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
After leading off the 10th inning with a walk, Carie Dever raced home from 
third when Julie Smith hit a grounder to short. 
</P>
<P>
Marcie Green (15-1) got the win for the Bulldogs. The loser was Dena Carter 
(23-7). Oklahoma State fell to 43-11. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA (61-7) entered the championship round by beating Florida State, 3-0, early 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Fernandez hit a two-run home run in the first inning, and Missy Phillips 
had an RBI single in the second. 
</P>
<P>
DeDe Weinman (13-3) was the winner. Debbie DeJohn (25-8) was the loser 
</P>
<P>
Florida State finished at 49-15.

The recent reissue of Low Rawls' first album, 1962's "Stormy Monday," makes for 
interesting comparisons with his current work. The singer's first set Saturday 
at the Coach House showed that his sweet baritone hasn't changed much in the 
intervening years; a bit of depth may have been lost, maybe some of the rich 
complexity of his tone has deserted him. But, surprisingly, the brandy-flavored 
voice that set hearts aflutter in the '60s is pretty much intact.

The major difference between that first live recording (with pianist Les McCann 
leading the backing trio) and what one hears from Rawls today is the material. 
"Stormy Monday" consists mainly of jazz and blues standards. Forget that Rawls' 
latest recording, 1989's "At Last," was hailed as a turn away from pop 
pretensions and a return to the vocalist's jazz and blues roots. The Coach 
House appearance covered the full range of Rawls' career, leaning heavily on 
past glories from the soul charts, pulling the occasional number from the new 
recording but placing a heavy emphasis on crowd-pleasing, even to the point of 
seemingly honoring a shouted request for "Tobacco Road."

After his supporting quintet, a harmonically rich blend of piano, vibes, 
guitar, bass and drums, opened with a relaxed "Sugar," Rawls came down the 
stairs and set the funky tone with "It's a Tough Job" followed by his 1971 hit, 
"A Natural Man." He filled the tunes with a warm expressiveness spiced with 
volume dramatics and the occasional growled line. Never one to show a lot of 
range, Rawls worked the middle register, occasionally sliding into a low, juicy 
tone that brought screams of encouragement from a few members of the crowd.

A longtime Las Vegas veteran, Rawls displayed some suave patter while 
introducing numbers, even claiming at one point that he, Isaac Hayes and Barry 
White invented what he labeled "that rap crap" back in the '60s -- "only we 
called it monologues." To prove his point, he went into some seductive dialogue 
during "A Natural Man" that would have made White, the master of this sort of 
thing, proud.

From the new album, Rawls pulled the relaxed title cut, "Fine Brown Frame" with 
its suggestive lyric of the kind that Rawls seems to work so well, and Lowell 
Fulson and Billy Vera's "Room With a View" (Vera not only contributed a number 
of tunes to "At Last" but also co-produced it and wrote the new liner notes for 
"Stormy Monday"). 
</P>
<P>
The quintet, led by guitarist David T. Walker, provided tight support and the 
occasional brief, spirited solo. Vibist Dwight Gassaway played a 
lightning-paced, ringing improvisation during "Tobacco Road," while Walker's 
solo on "Hoochie-Coochie Man" was a model of bluesy reserve. 
</P>
<P>
The evening's only shortcoming was the time spent involving the audience in 
"You're Gonna Miss My Lovin'." Who wants to pay good money to hear the guy next 
to you at the bar sing backup for someone the caliber of Rawls? But that -- and 
the fact that Rawls didn't do "Willow Weep for Me," the warhorse that's given 
one of its most emotive treatments on "Stormy Monday" -- were the only things 
that kept the evening from being perfect.

An anti-obscenity pledge that must be signed by artists receiving grants from 
the National Endowment for the Arts has been mandated by the NEA. In some 
editions of Saturday Calendar, it incorrectly was reported that the pledge was 
mandated by Congress.
