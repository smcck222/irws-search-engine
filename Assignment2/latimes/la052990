SUPREME COURT RULING AGAINST OPERATION RESCUE BLOCKADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I find it rather hypocritical that a law that makes it illegal for "two of more 
persons" to conspire "for the purpose of depriving any person or class of 
person" from exercising their constitutional rights is used against the one 
organization that is trying to protect someone's rights ("Justices Rebuff Foes 
of Abortion," front page, May 22). 
</P>
<P>
We have declared the yet-to-born human a non-person just as we did with the 
blacks in the mid-1800s. 
</P>
<P>
When good people put their lives and livelihood on line to defend those who 
have no voice, they are persecuted. 
</P>
<P>
It is the doctors and nurses who perform abortions who are in fact the "two or 
more persons" who conspire to grossly deny someone of their happiness, and it 
is they that should be receiving the condemnation of society. 
</P>
<P>
Anything can be justified, even the taking of an innocent life, if you redefine 
life to fit your purposes, but the truth still remains that a rose by any other 
name is still a rose and murder by any other name is still murder.

SUPREME COURT RULING AGAINST OPERATION RESCUE BLOCKADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The full effect of the Supreme Court decision to let stand the New York Federal 
District Court ruling interpreting the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act to include 
Operation Rescue's blockading of abortion clinics has yet to be felt. As 
pro-abortion forces celebrate their shortsighted victory for "privacy" and the 
"American way," you can be sure police departments, district attorneys and 
corporate lawyers are figuring out how to use it to stop other forms of civil 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
The effect will be felt on the sidewalks and public places within 50 feet of 
consulates, embassies, country clubs and corporate offices. 
</P>
<P>
The court's decision to restricting speech as to time, place and manner is 
aimed at all forms of protected speech involving acts of nonviolent civil 
disobedience, not just Operation Rescue. Had this decision been on the books in 
the 1960s, the sit-ins and civil rights movement never would have gotten off 
the ground. No lunch counter or college sit-in would have been possible because 
of the "chilling effect" criminal penalties and civil fines would have had on 
protesters. How will AIDS activists react when they are hit with triple damages 
for interfering with the "right to assemble" and "freedom to practice religion" 
for their disruption of Roman Catholic Masses? How will the ladies of Mills 
College react when they are told that their blockade of administration offices 
is a violation of the constitutional right of those who wish to do business at 
Mills? 
</P>
<P>
Today pro-abortion activists are savoring a great victory, but tomorrow they 
most certainly will feel the sting of the double-edged sword they helped to 
forge against Operation Rescue.

BOOMERANG PROPOSITION; 
</P>
<P>
THE SO-CALLED SPEEDY TRIAL INITIATIVE WOULD BACKFIRE ON CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The presence of Proposition 115 on the June ballot raises two disturbing 
questions: Has political exploitation of the public's justifiable anxiety over 
crime created a climate in which rational discussion of the criminal justice 
system is impossible? Has manipulation of the initiative process transformed 
that great reform from an instrument of direct democracy into a tool of 
misrule? 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, in this case the answer to both questions is yes. And, for that 
reason, Californians confront the possibility that their courts will be 
severely burdened and that many important individual liberties will be put at 
risk, including perhaps the right of women to obtain safe, legal abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its title -- the Crime Victims Justice Reform Act -- Proposition 115 is 
not the product of a grass-roots movement, nor even of one of our several 
victims' support groups. It actually was drafted in the early 1980s by a group 
of career prosecutors, whose most far-reaching proposals for changes in the 
criminal justice system had been rejected by the California Legislature. In 
effect, the prosecutors resolved to obtain by politics what they could not gain 
through legislative deliberation. The result was a measure they called The 
Speedy Trial Initiative, which failed to qualify for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
There the matter languished until Republican gubernatorial candidate Pete 
Wilson decided to make Proposition 115 the tactical centerpiece of his 
campaign. In essence, Wilson purchased the right to call the measure his own by 
giving its proponents the money they needed to hire enough professional 
signature-gatherers to put the initiative on the ballot. The advantages of this 
approach are clear: Not only do candidates gain identification with a popular 
issue -- in this case crime fighting -- but they also give their supporters a 
way to circumvent the legal limits on campaign contributions. The amount an 
individual may contribute to a candidate is strictly limited; there is no 
restriction on contributions to initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
The major donors to Proposition 115 are not victims of crime, but 13 insurance 
companies, two of which have contributed more than $100,000 each. Why? Perhaps 
because they suspect that passage will trigger a dramatic increase in the 
number of felony trials each year, thereby impeding California's ability to 
handle civil litigation, even at its current plodding pace. Weary plaintiffs 
will have an extra incentive to settle their claims against insurance 
companies; firms will earn millions in interest on the delayed settlements. 
</P>
<P>
The changes Proposition 115 proposes to make would eliminate the state 
Constitution as an independent source of rights for individuals accused of 
crimes. The federal courts would become the arbiters of such questions. The 
California Constitution also would be amended to create rights for the 
prosecution that do not exist in the federal system -- among them the right to 
obtain discovery of the accused person's proposed defense. The death penalty 
would be dramatically expanded, judges rather than lawyers would select juries 
and attorneys appointed to represent the poor would be compelled to prepare 
their cases more rapidly than lawyers retained by wealthy clients. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the initiative say the measure will ensure swifter punishment of 
criminals by conforming this state's criminal justice system to that of federal 
courts. But as legal scholar Gerald F. Uelmen has pointed out, "California 
currently disposes of 10 times as many felony cases per year as the federal 
courts, with only 1 1/2 times as many judges. In federal courts, only 75% of 
felony cases are disposed of by a guilty plea. In California, the rate is 95%." 
</P>
<P>
The most contentious issue raised by this initiative is the question of whether 
eliminating defendants' right to protection under our constitution's explicit 
right to privacy -- and replacing it with federal standards based on the U.S. 
Constitution's implied right to privacy -- opens the door to a 
re-criminalization of abortion. Opponents of the measure say that if the 
Supreme Court overturns Roe vs. Wade, there no longer would be a constitutional 
obstacle to passage of restrictive abortion laws. Proponents deny this, saying 
that, whatever the literal language of their proposal, they never intended that 
it apply to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Who's right? An analysis prepared by the joint staff of the state Senate 
Committee on the Judiciary and the Assembly Public Safety Committee put it this 
way: "It is impossible to state, with any certainty, how the California Supreme 
Court will rule as to this issue, if Roe vs. Wade is overturned. It can be 
concluded, however, that the right to an abortion in California is more secure 
now than it would be if the proposed initiative were enacted. For if the 
initiative is enacted, there will be a new provision in our (state) 
Constitution which arguably could be used to restrict or overturn a woman's 
right to an abortion." 
</P>
<P>
Even if Proposition 115 were otherwise worthy, that is too great a risk to run.

U.S. FACING ILLITERACY CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for the front page attention to the problem of illiteracy in America. 
It is important that the issue be recognized as central to the future of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Our productivity, our technological future and our democratic society depend 
upon a literate society -- not simply an educated elite. 
</P>
<P>
It is a time for coalition building; a time for combining efforts within our 
communities to remediate the adults and motivate the children. 
</P>
<P>
It is time to support the efforts of educators, professional and volunteer, 
working through our schools, public libraries and organizations such as Reading 
Is Fundamental, Laubach and the California Literacy Campaign. These 
organizations and many more in our communities are attempting to reach out to 
assist the poor and illiterate to help themselves and their children. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has declared 1991 as the year of the Lifetime Reader. It is not too 
soon to begin thinking about the important role that "reading" plays in our 
daily lives and to begin to support efforts to bring literacy to all.

SUPREME COURT RULING AGAINST OPERATION RESCUE BLOCKADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your story misleads the reader into believing that our nation's highest court 
is an unequivocating bastion of support for a woman's right to an abortion. 
Recent rulings and remarks by the court show this to be false. 
</P>
<P>
As the article stated, the court case that the Supreme Court let stand, Randall 
Terry vs. New York State, was based on the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which 
forbids depriving any person from exercising a constitutional right. Thus in 
letting the lower court's ruling stand, the Supreme Court is merely stating 
that this was not an appropriate opportunity to challenge Roe vs. Wade and 
issue a definitive ruling on whether women have a constitutional right to an 
abortion. However, such an opportunity will inevitably come, and only then will 
the court's true stand on abortion be revealed.

To Guy Smith IV 
</P>
<P>
Vice President, Corporate Affairs 
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris Companies Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Guy: 
</P>
<P>
So sorry I missed your speech at the Media Institute in Washington last week. I 
loved reading it, anyway. I especially liked the part when you called reporters 
the "patsies" of "quack moralists" with "bogus science." Who better to give it 
to the press than a fella from Philip Morris, corporate sponsor of the Bill of 
Rights itself? 
</P>
<P>
From what I read, your main complaint is that we here in the Fourth Estate are 
more skeptical of industry than of advocacy groups. You take us to task for 
believing naively in the people you call "the anti-tobacco industry's top 
executives." 
</P>
<P>
Well, talk about naive. I didn't even know there was an anti-tobacco 
"industry." I thought these people were public-health advocates. What do they 
manufacture? "No Smoking" signs? 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, I appreciate the warning about being too "cozy" with health researchers 
(I mean "quack moralists") and the need to stay skeptical. You never know what 
these health nuts are pushing. A clean lung could be a dangerous thing. 
</P>
<P>
But frankly, Guy, until your speech, I thought the media were the patsies of 
the tobacco industry, not to mention its $3-billion advertising budget. 
</P>
<P>
What's amazed me even more about the media is how the tobacco industry has 
secured a permanent post as "the other side" of the argument. You know the 
drill: Over here, we have the entire weight of the medical world. Over there, 
we have the Tobacco Institute. Shazam, a balanced issue. 
</P>
<P>
But what do I know? I never even realized the tobacco industry was such a 
passionate defender of science. The part where you attack the upcoming 
Environmental Protection Agency study on passive smoking was a real hummer. You 
seem righteously worried that the scientific arguments over passive-smoking 
research might be tainted by politics. Well, hush my Jesse Helms. 
</P>
<P>
EPA, one of those "special interest . . . bureaucracies pushing a party line" 
is expected to attribute 3,000 cancer deaths a year to passive smoking. In 
fact, Guy, the risks from tobacco pollution may be worse than the EPA study 
suggests and, in any case, greater than those of all the carcinogenic outdoor 
air pollutants on the EPA's list. Say, if the Philip Morris job goes sour, want 
to defend asbestos? Polyvinyl chlorides? 
</P>
<P>
Ever since you fellas stopped featuring doctors in ads, the posture of the 
pushers has been that there is a "controversy" over cigarette smoking. The 
best-documented health risk is put in the same category as eating sugar or 
drinking caffeine. 
</P>
<P>
Your pals keep telling us that nobody has proved cigarettes cause cancer. Four 
decades and tens of thousands of studies on this subject have produced no hard 
science. So light up, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Well, in the spirit of a purely scientific debate, will you field a couple of 
questions from a "skeptical, careful journalist"? What evidence would the 
tobacco companies accept as proof of the dangers of smoking? And what would you 
all do then? 
</P>
<P>
"What I am saying" you admonished us, "is that in covering science and 
industry, no more laziness, no more coziness and no more patsies." That's what 
I'm saying, too, Guy. 
</P>
<P>
Love,

Patsy.

THE GRANDEUR OF OPERA IS FELT FIRST IN THE HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA BLANDFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the middle of a night 16 years ago, Aida Monte woke up and was seized with 
the desire to be on the stage again, to sing grand opera. A violinist by 
training ("my father made us practice on pain of death"), a secretary by 
profession, she longed in her middle age for the passion and torments of the 
great prima donna roles. 
</P>
<P>
Who beyond a certain age has not known such nights? The anguish of nostalgia 
for dreams, for youth at its most hopeful? Most people sigh, go off to work 
and, wistfully, become once again their reliable, everyday, unnoticed selves. 
</P>
<P>
Since that night, twice a year, at small theaters over the city, and all at her 
own expense, Aida Monte has relived the tragedy of Madama Butterfly, the aching 
romance of Mimi and the defiant abandon of Carmen. The Hollywood Opera 
Ensemble, of which she is director, scenery-shifter, prop-collector, prima 
donna and costume maker, is in rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
Picture, first of all, the rest of Aida Monte's life: a small, stucco house on 
a Hollywood side street with a patch out front in which she has "planted" silk 
flowers, a tiny yard out back. The house had been divided in two so that she 
could offer a downstairs apartment to her parents when they moved here from the 
cold eastern winters during fading old age. "My mother was almost bed-ridden in 
her last six years, my father almost 93 when he died, but I consider myself 
very lucky. Parents are everything." 
</P>
<P>
The house is plain: sparse furniture, few gadgets, barely a trinket. It is 
homey: a simple stage, as if all the color happens elsewhere. As, indeed, it 
does. Not at work. She is a secretary in a law office: "I'm really quite good 
at it -- when you've been at it for so many years, you should be." Her husband 
is a computer engineer, "a sweet, lovely man -- however, he doesn't like 
singing." 
</P>
<P>
She saves every penny she can; each production costs $1,500. "Nobody gives me a 
dime. I don't ask; I don't get. It's always from my own pocket." Since her 
parents' deaths, the downstairs apartment has been kept empty, to use as a 
rehearsal space for the opera. "I've always rehearsed in my living room." Forty 
or so singers -- secretaries, sales clerks, a retired hairdresser with a 
hearing aid, assorted sopranos pretty and not, a tenor from Montgomery Ward, 
some who read music, some who cannot -- brought together two, even three nights 
a week, in Aida's living room, thumping out Bizet's masterpiece on the upright 
piano, nearly in tune. 
</P>
<P>
By the silk-planted flower bed outside, strangers sometimes gather to listen 
through the open door, to applaud the Gypsies, smugglers and toreadors. It is 
the magic of make-believe. "It makes me feel marvelous that I am the key. If I 
didn't do all this, all these people wouldn't be able to get on the stage. It's 
always an act of love for us. Kiri Te Kanawa doesn't have to move scenery and 
drive a truck." 
</P>
<P>
In the garden shed, the props and scenery. In the bedroom closets, the costumes 
and handmade glitter. In the drawer, the letters. The ones that bless her for 
bringing joy; the barbed one that scorned and laughed, from a writer who did 
not see the magic. But would not Bizet himself be thrilled to see, 115 years 
after his death, this ordinary sitting room transformed by passion for his 
music? 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere, perhaps half a century ago, Aida Monte saw her first "Carmen" -- was 
it in Milan at La Scala? Or in standing room at the old Met in New York? Her 
father, an Italian lawyer and composer, came to America to watch over the 
career of her brother, a piano prodigy. "We thought he was going to the moon -- 
his concert career went down the drain." Her memories swirl together: her 
brother playing with Toscanini, her parents sending away their wedding bands. 
To Italy? To family? To pawn? Her father, who named her Aida, gave music 
lessons and put her to the violin. 
</P>
<P>
A quarter of a century ago, she came to this quieter life in Los Angeles: to 
her husband, to caring for her two sons, keeping a family together and putting 
aside, like a costume, the heartbreak and delight of being young, Italian, with 
glossy black hair and shining eyes, full of life. "Gina Lollobrigida is my 
third cousin. Some people used to say I looked like her. Aaah, I wish. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
On the stage, though, as Carmen -- defying Don Jose, embracing his knife and 
fate -- she lives it all again. "Imagine how lucky I am -- in a beautiful aria, 
you are pouring your soul out. In this life, who can do that?" 
</P>
<P>
There are so few second acts: Aida Monte got up one morning and made her own.

<P>
It was a small matter, really, in the multibillion-dollar world of the Sony 
Corp. Seven shipping containers crammed with televisions, radios and electronic 
gadgets had disappeared from a terminal at the Port of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The incident happened nearly six months ago, but port officials were still 
jittery about it when they called on Sony officials here last week. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers are insignificant," said Ezunial Burts, executive director of the 
Port of Los Angeles. But Burts said he was concerned that an important tenant 
would lose confidence in the port. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the worrying had paid off. Months of apologies, assurances 
and tightened security had satisfied the Sony officials, and the Los Angeles 
delegation emerged smiling from their meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The Sony visit was one of dozens made by the seven-member group during a 
weeklong trade mission to Korea and Japan that ended Friday. Port officials 
said that attention to matters large and small has helped to push the Port of 
Los Angeles into the forefront of Pacific Rim trade. 
</P>
<P>
While part of the group headed off to make calls on port customers, Los Angeles 
Mayor Tom Bradley, who led the delegation, met with Japanese Prime Minister 
Toshiki Kaifu and had sessions with local and regional government officials. 
</P>
<P>
The trip, like dozens made by port officials in recent years, was part public 
relations, part negotiation and part intelligence-gathering.

<P>
"I've been here many, many times," Burts said. "You can't do business by fax or 
letter. You have to do business face to face and it takes time. That's what 
pays huge dividends." 
</P>
<P>
The trip comes just seven weeks after the U.S. Customs commissioner announced 
that the Port of Los Angeles has surpassed New York as the nation's busiest 
commercial gateway. Port officials said the news gave the delegation a 
strategic boost, particularly in dealing with the status-conscious Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Now a hub of international commerce, the Port of Los Angeles has undergone 
remarkable development in recent decades, and the recent milestone represents a 
significant east-to-west realignment in commerce. 
</P>
<P>
A century and a half ago, when New York was already a bustling international 
seaport, the marshlands of San Pedro were so dismal that they inspired a young 
seaman named Richard Henry Dana to describe the place as "the hell of 
California," an observation he included in his classic "Two Years Before the 
Mast." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, according to the Customs statistics, the equivalent of about 1.4 
million loaded, 20-foot cargo containers passed through the Port of Los 
Angeles. That volume established the port as the leading source of government 
revenue from commercial traffic, with annual collection of tariffs and fees in 
excess of $1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New York Ranking 
</P>
<P>
New York ranked second in terms of commercial traffic in 1989, with 1.2 million 
of the standardized containers imported or exported. The Port of Long Beach was 
a close third, with 1.17 million. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar value of the shipments passing through the Port of New York remains 
the highest in the nation, with $117.8 billion to $101.4 billion for Los 
Angeles. However, Customs officials said last month it is beyond question that 
Los Angeles is taking over from New York and predicted that the trend will 
continue through the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
In large part, the boom in the Port of Los Angeles reflects the growing 
importance of Pacific Rim trade and the tremendous population boom in Southern 
California over the last two decades. Much of the merchandise and material 
shipped to the port comes from Asia and is intended to satisfy the huge 
consumer market in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
However, the port has also developed from a regional point of entry to a major 
transshipment center. As much as 50% of the goods shipped to the port are 
transferred to destinations east of the Rocky Mountains, including Europe, said 
Burts, the port director. 
</P>
<P>
Port officials say a policy of aggressively pursuing opportunities in Pacific 
Rim trade has helped to push Los Angeles ahead. 
</P>
<P>
A key means of establishing Los Angeles as a major presence in international 
shipping is frequent trade missions to seek out potential customers and call on 
existing clients to make sure that their needs are being met, the officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's trip to Japan and Korea was a pump-priming mission with no specific 
result expected, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-member delegation consisted of Bradley and an aide from his office, 
Jeff Matsui; Port Commission Chairman Jun Mori; Commissioner Robert G. Rados; 
Burts, and two port staff members, Albert B. Fierstine, director of marketing, 
and Julia T. Nagano, public relations director. 
</P>
<P>
"What I want to leave Korea with is a kind of inside feeling about what some of 
the important people in this country think is happening to trade, politics and 
the economy," Burts said early in the week. "It's intelligence-gathering, it's 
saying, 'Thank you,' it's getting a feel for issues other than shipping . . . 
the kind of stuff that doesn't flow back and forth on telexes." 
</P>
<P>
In Seoul, the group made calls on existing customers as well as some potential 
ones who now use other West Coast ports, all of which are engaged in tough 
competition for the lucrative Pacific Rim trade. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the delegation crossed paths with a group from the Port of Oakland, 
which was on a similar mission. In marked contrast to Los Angeles, Oakland has 
been losing its share of the shipping market in recent years, especially in the 
area of containerized shipping, the chief indicator of standing in 
international commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles port officials said the presence of Bradley on trade missions gives 
them a secret weapon not available to port representatives from other cities. 
Bradley's stature as mayor of the nation's second-most populous city and now 
its busiest port opens doors in the Far East that would otherwise be 
inaccessible, they said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bradley's Role 
</P>
<P>
Bradley attends sessions with government officials and key officials of 
shipping lines that are major tenants of the port, a gesture that greatly 
impresses the executives, according to Shuji Nomura, a Japanese native who is 
the port's full-time representative in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives the customer the sense that the entire organization of the city of 
Los Angeles is interested" in his company, Nomura said. Bradley, he said, is 
thoroughly conversant in the trade issues and actively participates in the 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of Mori, the port commission chairman, also is a substantial 
asset, Nomura said. Mori, a partner in the Los Angeles office of Kelley, Dreye 
&amp; Warren, a New York law firm, speaks flawless Japanese, a fact that 
impresses both government and business officials in Japan, Nomura said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday afternoon, both Bradley and Mori were invited to meet with Prime 
Minister Kaifu, who carved out time for them on what was a highly charged day 
in Japanese politics. The grounds of the Imperial Palace were closed to 
visitors and security throughout central Tokyo was extremely tight in 
anticipation of the arrival Thursday of Korean President Roh Tae Woo. Both 
Kaifu and Japanese Emperor Akihito met with Roh on Thursday to offer 
long-anticipated apologies for Japan's harsh colonial treatment of Korea prior 
to Japan's defeat in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The significance of Bradley's reception by Kaifu on such a day was not lost on 
the 150 government and business officials who attended a reception held by the 
Los Angeles delegation Thursday evening, Nomura said. 
</P>
<P>
The reception at the elegant Imperial Hotel, just across the street from the 
Imperial Palace, was intended as a grand finale to the mission. 
</P>
<P>
Top officials of Japanese utilities showed up, including Gaishi Hiraiwa, 
chairman of the Giant Tokyo Electric Power Co. Hiraiwa's attendance was a 
particular triumph for Los Angeles, port officials said, and represented a 
public display by Hiraiwa that he supports the port's effort to put together a 
joint venture to export coal to Asian nations. 
</P>
<P>
The port is in an exploratory phase of a project to develop the venture, in 
which coal companies in the United States, as well as utility companies in 
Asia, would invest in a bulk-loading facility at the port. 
</P>
<P>
Such a venture would decrease the cost to the port, as well as the financial 
risk, if the market for coal drops off. The port has been attempting to 
interest coal-hungry Asian utility companies in such a plan for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
"This meeting tonight, I think, is one of the best indications of how 
persistence pays off," Bradley said Thursday. "Ten years ago I was here and we 
talked about developing a coal terminal. . . . Nobody was willing at that point 
to make a financial commitment." 
</P>
<P>
The response was dramatically different on Thursday, Bradley said, adding that 
he heard strong support for the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight business concerns, including American and Japanese companies, have 
contributed $25,000 each to conduct a feasibility study. If the firms decide to 
go ahead with the project, which will require the construction of a new and 
streamlined bulk-loading facility, it should be in operation within three 
years, according to Burts, the port director. The port's current annual export 
of about 1 million tons of coal could then increase by 10 or 15 times, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unusual Venture 
</P>
<P>
The venture is unusual because the port normally functions as landlord for its 
100 tenants, whose leases range from individual stalls at the fish market to 
100-acre container terminals. The joint-venture agreement would make the 
investors partners with the port, rather than just tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Port officials say their concentration on development of bulk-loading will help 
to further diversify the port, which also has developed a major cruise ship 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
The officials in the delegation last week acknowledged that their sales efforts 
come at significant expense, especially in Japan where the dollar is weak and 
rooms in the best hotels cost $500 a night. They repeatedly said they feared 
that newspaper reports would make the trip appear as a lavish junket, although 
virtually all their time was spent in meetings and business dinners. 
</P>
<P>
They said that the trips, parties and gifts (Japanese officials attending the 
reception were given key rings from Tiffany &amp; Co.) are the cost of doing 
business in the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
Although officials could not provide a cost estimate for the trip, Burts said 
that the Thursday reception cost a minimum of $15,000. It featured women in 
traditional Japanese costumes who scurried about the room, refilling glasses 
almost before they were empty, and whisking away used plates. 
</P>
<P>
Elaborate buffet tables were covered with sushi, silver trays of smoked salmon, 
beef Stroganoff, pasta, pastries and other concoctions. A large ice sculpture 
of a bird in flight decorated one table. "This is a triple-A party," said 
Burts. "If we had to spend $500,000 on one party, it would be worth it, because 
even one client can bring in $10 million in business."

STREET CRIME DEATH TOLL EXCEEDS 20 FOR WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL McGRAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the three-day Memorial Day holiday -- a weekend usually punctuated by 
tributes to the nation's war dead and tallies of highway death statistics -- 
law enforcement officers in Los Angeles County were investigating more than 20 
homicides. 
</P>
<P>
The dead included a man shot over a drug deal; a security guard gunned down in 
a parking lot, and a West Hollywood man who died at a hospital after being 
found wandering the streets with slash wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the weekend incidents were gang-related, law enforcement officers said. 
But as is often the case, innocent victims also got in the way of feuding 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of people who died," said Sheriff's Deputy Gabe Ramirez, 
reading from a long list of shooting reports that sheriff's detectives were 
investigating. "It's a real shame." 
</P>
<P>
In one incident, David Lesperance was shot early Sunday after an alleged drug 
deal apparently went sour at Aliso Village housing project in East Los Angeles, 
officers said. He drove his car several blocks before crashing into a building, 
and died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The security guard was shot in the parking lot outside a Whittier Boulevard 
night club about 10:30 p.m. Friday, deputies said. There were no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
A 9-year-old boy was critically wounded Friday night while was playing ball in 
front of his home in South-Central Los Angeles. Police did not release his 
name, but they said he "apparently got in the way of a bullet meant for a gang 
banger." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Sgt. Chuck Brown of the 77th Division in the South-Central 
area of the city said that between 6 p.m. Friday and noon Sunday, there were a 
dozen reports of shooting incidents in the area, resulting in three deaths. 
</P>
<P>
"But the count doesn't surprise me," he said tiredly. "It's like that any night 
of the week." 
</P>
<P>
Gang members were thought to be responsible for two of the deaths Saturday 
night, Brown said. At about 8:45, two men standing near 70th and Hoover streets 
were shot by assailants in a passing car. 
</P>
<P>
Five minutes later, the same suspects drove by a group of people at 80th and 
Hoover streets, killing another man and wounding three others, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In a third incident in the area, an unidentified man was shot to death Saturday 
night in in the 4500 block of Van Ness Street. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies were also investigating the gang-related stabbing deaths Saturday 
night of two youths. Ricardo Hernandez, 16, and Jesus Coronado, 15, were 
stabbed during a party in East Los Angeles on Friday night. A companion was 
hospitalized with wounds. 
</P>
<P>
A man identified as Alvaro Ortega, 26, of Willowbrook, died early Sunday at 
Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center after friends brought him into the 
emergency room with numerous gunshot wounds in the neck and torso. He had been 
shot in front of a home in Lynwood, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
In La Puente, an assailant opened fire with a semiautomatic weapon at 1 a.m. 
Sunday, killing Phillip Juarez, 20, of Valinda. Three other men were wounded, 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified West Hollywood man was found by deputies after they received an 
emergency call complaining of a man exposing himself on the street. When 
officers arrived, they found a dazed man, who had slash marks on his wrists. 
The man died later at a local hospital. Deputies said they could not determine 
his cause of death until an autopsy was conducted. 
</P>
<P>
Other incidents included: 
</P>
<P>
* A 23-year-old man killed by automatic-weapon fire early Sunday in Maywood. 
</P>
<P>
* A 21-year-old man killed in a drive-by shooting in mid-city Los Angeles early 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
* Warren Pena, 18, of Compton, killed in a drive-by shooting early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
* Roberto Nunez, 21, killed in a street shooting in West Los Angeles Friday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
* Aaron Hernandez, 23, killed in Sepulveda. A suspect was later arrested, but 
police did not disclose a motive for the shooting.

NOMURA UNHAPPY WITH $100,000 SALARY, BUT ENJOYS PORT'S SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mention the fact that Shuji Nomura is one of the highest-paid employees of the 
city of Los Angeles, and he responds with exasperation. "Yeah. So I hear." 
</P>
<P>
Nomura is paid just over $100,000 a year as the Japanese representative of the 
Port of Los Angeles. Another $159,000 is allocated each year to cover the rent 
for his office in Tokyo and to pay for some expense account lunches and 
business meetings. 
</P>
<P>
A gregarious cheerleader for the port, Nomura, 58, apparently embraces his job 
with enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
But in a city where a box of cornflakes costs $4.97, and baby-sitters charge 
$12.97 an hour, the subject of his salary turns him uncharacteristically glum. 
</P>
<P>
"I am -- what shall I say -- disgruntled?" Nomura said Thursday, glancing 
quickly at his boss, Albert B. Fierstine, director of marketing for the port. 
Fierstine responded with a sympathetic look and Nomura, emboldened, continued. 
</P>
<P>
"Never a rise in my salary for the past five years," Nomura said. "I'm trying 
to be patient because this job is a very exciting job." 
</P>
<P>
A native of Japan, Nomura operates the port's only full-time overseas office, a 
job he has had for the past six years. During that time, the dollar has fared 
poorly against the strong Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo's astronomical housing costs make it necessary for Nomura, his wife and 
three sons to live in an outlying area of the city. His daily round-trip 
commute takes three hours on packed trains. 
</P>
<P>
(A recent survey by Business International, a Swiss business information firm, 
showed that a two-bedroom apartment in a good residential area of Tokyo costs 
the equivalent of $3,243 to $12,160 a month. Purchasing a residence is 
practically out of the question.) 
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to do with the dollar," Nomura lamented. "I'm living on the 
yen." 
</P>
<P>
Nomura made the comments about his pay in response to a reporter's questions 
Thursday. The exchange was a momentary cloud in a day that turned out to be a 
particular triumph for Nomura. 
</P>
<P>
He had been the architect of an elegant reception hosted by Mayor Tom Bradley 
and the Port of Los Angeles at the Imperial Hotel, one of Tokyo's finest. Among 
the 150 people invited were the top officials of Japanese shipping, exporting 
and utility companies. 
</P>
<P>
Like the father of the bride at his only daughter's wedding, Nomura beamed with 
pleasure as he surveyed the room. All the right people had shown up and most 
stayed more than the obligatory 15 minutes. Earlier in the day, there had been 
some concern about the turnout, he said, as executives called around town to 
find out who planned to attend the affair. 
</P>
<P>
Port officials credit Nomura with helping to bring Los Angeles to the forefront 
of Pacific Rim shipping. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the best organizers to be found in this country," Bradley said 
Thursday as two days of back-to-back meetings came to an end. "He's been a 
great asset for us here in Japan." 
</P>
<P>
Takashi Takeda, editor of Shipping and Trading News, a Japanese publication, 
said, "Everybody knows Nomura-san. He's a very influential man in Japanese 
shipping circles. He's a very tough negotiator." 
</P>
<P>
Nomura courts clients and potential clients, investigates the backgrounds and 
needs of Japanese companies, and tries to keep port officials and staff from 
making blunders that could offend the protocol-conscious Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
It was Nomura who, for example, taught port officials always to carry their 
business cards in expensive leather cases and to present them in an elaborate, 
two-handed gesture, said Port Director Ezunial Burts. 
</P>
<P>
It was also Nomura who smoothed over a potentially serious flap with the Sony 
Corp. last January after seven containers packed with millions of dollars in 
electronics products were stolen from the port in San Pedro, Burts said. 
</P>
<P>
Nomura's immediate trip to Los Angeles to help assess security at the port sent 
a signal to Sony, Burts said, that the problem was taken seriously.

SURPRISE SOAKING FROM STORM TURNS THE HOLIDAY INTO AN INDOOR EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A late spring storm brought cooler temperatures and rain to San Diego County 
Monday, dampening Memorial Day barbecues, wreaking havoc on area freeways and 
driving traditional holiday crowds away from the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
The surprisingly strong rainstorm was part of a cold front that moved through 
most of California over the weekend. The U.S. Weather Service reported gusty 
winds of up to 35 m.p.h., accompanied by thunderstorms, over the mountains and 
deserts. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers' warnings were posted in the afternoon for vans and motor homes in 
the mountains and deserts east of San Diego, as the cold front made its way 
toward the Plains states. Winds of 30 m.p.h. were recorded in the desert town 
of Ocotillo Wells in Imperial County. 
</P>
<P>
As of 4 p.m. Monday, rainfall measured .40 of an inch at Lindbergh Field in 
downtown San Diego, with the temperature reaching no higher than 66 degrees, 
said Weather Service meteorologist Dan Atkin and 0.58 of an inch was recorded 
across town at Montgomery Field. 
</P>
<P>
In other parts of the county, 1.80 inches of rain fell at Mt. Laguna in East 
County, while 1.72 inches was recorded at Palomar Mountain. Cuyamaca Rancho 
State Park in the Laguna Mountains reported 1.16 inches of rain. San Diego 
County's coldest spot over the weekend was Palomar Mountain, where a 
temperature of 40 degrees was recorded Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the heavy rain fell in North County, where 0.93 of an inch was recorded 
in Fallbrook, 0.86 of an inch at Oceanside Harbor and 0.80 of an inch in 
Escondido. In contrast, Campo, near the Mexican border, reported 0.21 of an 
inch and Chula Vista in the South Bay reported only 0.18 of an inch. 
</P>
<P>
The sun broke through the clouds for a brief period in San Diego about 4:30 
p.m, but a sudden shower darkened the sky and soaked the downtown areas an hour 
later. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't expecting this much rain," Atkin said. "The storm was a bit 
stronger than we expected." 
</P>
<P>
The surprisingly high amount of rain is not expected to have any measurable 
effect on the drought that has plagued San Diego County and the state for four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, any rain will help. But this will certainly not end the drought of 
above normal yearly rainfall," Atkin added. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted warmer temperatures and sunny skies for today. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's showers did not cancel Memorial Day services at Fort Rosecrans 
National Cemetery, where tribute was paid to fallen veterans. The graves were 
decorated with the traditional miniature U.S. flags. 
</P>
<P>
Several rain-related accidents were reported by the California Highway Patrol 
and local law enforcement agencies, causing numerous injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Eight people were injured in a six-car pileup on northbound Interstate 5 at 
Poinsettia Lane at 5 a.m. CHP officials said the accidents occurred during a 
downpour. About four hours later, CHP officials called about six tow trucks to 
Interstate 805 where it connects with Interstate 8 in Mission Valley to 
untangle several vehicles involved in another rain-related freeway accident. 
</P>
<P>
Harried CHP dispatchers said they were too busy keeping up with calls of other 
fender benders on the freeways to release any details of the latter accident. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police reported one traffic fatality late Sunday night. A police 
spokesman said that Robbie Lee Reney, 22, died at 11:19 p.m. when the compact 
car he was driving went out of control on Torrey Pines Road and hit a tree. 
Five passengers in the car were ejected, and three suffered serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
According to a police report of the accident, Reney was driving 60 to 70 m.p.h. 
when he lost control of the car and hit a tree. Police reported finding several 
liquor bottles and "a strong odor of alcohol" in the car. 
</P>
<P>
The rain also drove away the annual Memorial Day crowds that flock to local 
beaches and forced the cancellation of other beach activities. The only 
beach-goers seen Monday were an occasional person, bundled up, walking at the 
edge of the surf. 
</P>
<P>
Parishioners at St. Catherine Laboure Catholic Church in Clairemont were forced 
to cancel their annual Memorial Day picnic at Crown Point. 
</P>
<P>
"It was our first cancellation in 19 years. But about 100 parishioners brought 
food and goodies to the parish hall, where we ended up having the picnic," said 
Monsignor Bill Cuddihy. 
</P>
<P>
Many people who planned on going to the beach ended up at movie theaters and 
shopping malls instead. 
</P>
<P>
"The rain didn't keep them away. That's for sure," said Karen Hurst,a customer 
service representative at University Towne Centre. "I expect it to get more 
crowded when the rain stops. The theaters have long, winding lines of people 
waiting to get in." 
</P>
<P>
"There's tons and tons of people inside and outside the theaters waiting to see 
a movie," said Donna Washington, an employee of the Sports Arena Six theatres. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you can blame the rain for this."

<P>
Border Patrol agents found 1,310 pounds of marijuana worth an estimated 
$650,000 early Monday in a pickup truck they stopped near the border. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Border Patrol report, agents from the Imperial Beach station 
stopped the truck at 3 a.m. as it drove away from the border on Monument Road. 
</P>
<P>
The driver and a passenger fled the vehicle and escaped into the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
Agents found eight duffel bags in the truck bed and a drug sniffing dog alerted 
them to the presence of drugs. Inside the bags were 312 sealed cans, labeled as 
jalapeno peppers, but which were filled with marijuana, said the report.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ESCONDIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 46-year-old Escondido man suffered second- and third-degree burns Sunday, 
when his three-bedroom home burst into flames after a propane explosion that 
destroyed the home and everything inside, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was estimated at $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Osborne Robert Milner, who lived on Stonehurst Drive in a rural area of north 
Escondido, was listed in fair condition Monday in the burn unit of UC San Diego 
Medical Center with second-degree burns to his forehead and third-degree burns 
on his arms and legs. 
</P>
<P>
Fire units from Deer Springs and San Marcos responded to the report of an 
explosion and fire at 10:23 a.m. Sunday, and upon arrival, found the home 
engulfed in flames, said Sgt. Kate Nolan, spokeswoman for the San Diego County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Milner was found lying on the ground near the southeast corner of the 
residence, Nolan said. He was taken by ambulance to Palomar Hospital and from 
there was flown by Life Flight helicopter to the burn unit of UCSD Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
After he awoke Sunday morning, Milner lit a cigarette, which triggered an 
immediate explosion and fire, Nolan said. However, an investigation into 
possible arson is continuing, she said.

Dave Stieb cooled off the Oakland Athletics with a three-hitter and Manny Lee 
tripled home the only run as the Toronto Blue Jays ended the A's six-game 
winning streak, 1-0, Monday night and moved into the AL East lead. 
</P>
<P>
Stieb (6-2) struck out three and walked one in winning for the first time in 
three weeks. It was his first complete game of the season and the 100th of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Only one A's baserunner got past first base until the seventh inning, when a 
pair of two-out errors put runners on second and third. Stieb then retired 
Terry Steinbach on a grounder back to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Moore (4-4) lost despite pitching a six-hitter. Moore is 4-13 against 
Toronto in his career. 
</P>
<P>
The victory lifted the defending East champion Blue Jays a half-game ahead of 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Lee's triple in the fifth scored John Olerud, who singled. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 4, Texas 3 -- Tony Pena hit a two-run double with two outs in the eighth 
inning at Arlington, Tex., and the Red Sox dealt the Rangers their eighth 
consecutive home loss and dropped them into the AL West cellar. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Greenwell doubled with one out in the eighth off Kenny Rogers, bringing on 
Texas relief ace Jeff Russell (1-5). Tom Brunansky grounded out and Dwight 
Evans was walked intentionally before Pena delivered. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Reed (1-1) went 1 2/3 innings and got the victory despite giving up two 
runs. Jeff Reardon pitched two perfect innings for his fourth save. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Baines singled home a run for the Rangers in the sixth, but Texas left 
the bases loaded. Boston made the score 1-1 when Carlos Quintana doubled home 
Ellis Burks in the seventh and scored on a single by Luis Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
Texas regained the lead in the bottom of the seventh when Gary Pettis led off 
with a home run and Julio Franco singled home Rafael Palmeiro, who doubled. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 2, New York 1 -- Scott Fletcher and Robin Ventura singled home runs in 
the seventh and Eric King held the Yankees to three hits in eight innings as 
the White Sox won at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, the White Sox improved the major leagues' best home record to 
16-6 and pulled within 3 1/2 games of Oakland in the West. 
</P>
<P>
King (4-0) gave way to Bobby Thigpen, who pitched the ninth for his 15th save. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher scored Chicago's first run in the fourth when he singled with two 
outs, took third on Guillen's double and came home on a wild pitch by Tim Leary 
(3-5). 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Barfield tied the score with a home run in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 4, Milwaukee 3 -- Pinch-hitter Darnell Coles hit a two-run single in 
the fifth at Seattle and the Mariners ended a four-game losing streak by 
handing the Brewers their sixth loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
After being staked to a 4-0 lead, Seattle's Erik Hanson (5-3) gave up his first 
home runs of the season, a solo homer to Dave Parker in the sixth and a two-run 
homer by Paul Molitor in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 3, Detroit 2 -- Bret Saberhagen pitched his third consecutive 
complete game victory and Kevin Seitzer hit two doubles, giving him five 
consecutive extra-base hits, as the Royals beat the Tigers at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen (4-3) gave up nine hits as the Royals equaled their longest winning 
streak of the season at three games. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen, 13-5 lifetime against the Tigers, has given up seven earned runs in 
his last 40 1/3 innings. He gave up a run-scoring single to Tracy Jones in the 
fourth and Matt Nokes' homer in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Seitzer doubled to lead off the game and scored, then doubled in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Macfarlane and Terry Shumpert hit consecutive doubles in the seventh for 
what proved to be the decisive run.

<P>
Tony Gwynn singled home the go-ahead run in a four-run ninth inning as the San 
Diego Padres blew a five-run lead but beat the Philadelphia Phillies, 9-5, 
Monday night at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies, held hitless by Bruce Hurst for six innings and trailing, 5-0, 
scored five runs on five hits in the seventh, tying the game on Len Dykstra's 
single. 
</P>
<P>
But pinch-hitter Fred Lynn drew a leadoff walk from Jeff Parrett (2-3) to open 
the ninth. Joey Cora ran for Lynn and Roger McDowell relieved Parrett. 
</P>
<P>
Bip Roberts sacrificed Cora to second and Roberto Alomar beat out an infield 
hit before Gwynn singled to right for his third hit of the game, driving in 
Cora. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Carter singled home Alomar and, after a double steal, Benito Santiago hit a 
sacrifice fly and Mike Pagliarulo singled in Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Grant (1-0) pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings after relieving Hurst 
following Dykstra's single. Craig Lefferts pitched the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 4, Atlanta 1 -- Kevin Gross pitched six strong innings of relief when 
Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd came up lame, and Mike Fitzgerald hit a two-run homer as 
the Expos defeated the Braves at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Gross (6-3) allowed five hits in six innings after a 2-hour 9-minute rain delay 
at the end of the third inning. He struck out seven and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd, who yielded a third-inning single to Ernie Whitt, was lifted because he 
strained his left hip while batting in that inning. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Lilliquist (2-6) retired the first nine Expos, but lost his stuff during 
the rain delay. Delino DeShields singled to right to open the fourth inning, 
stole his 13th and 14th bases and scored on a sacrifice fly by Tim Raines. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald homered off Lilliquist in the fifth, and Andres Galarraga hit his 
fifth homer in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 5, St. Louis 1 -- At Houston, Bill Gullickson got his 100th National 
League victory, and the Astros stretched the Cardinals' losing streak to four 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Coleman singled home the St. Louis run off Gullickson (3-3), who has won 
six of his last seven starts against the Cardinals, in the second. Gullickson, 
who pitched in Japan the last two seasons, allowed six hits, struck out four 
and walked three in 6 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Caminiti hit a two-run homer in the eighth and singled with two out to 
spark Houston's two-run fourth. Glenn Wilson and Alex Trevino followed with 
singles to score one run, and an error by third baseman Terry Pendleton sent 
home the other run. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson doubled and scored on Trevino's single in the sixth as the Astros sent 
Greg Mathews (0-5) to his sixth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 5, San Francisco 1 -- Jerome Walton drove in three runs and rookie Mike 
Harkey got his fourth consecutive victory as the Cubs beat the Giants at 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs broke a 1-1 tie on Walton's two-run triple after two were out in the 
fourth inning against Bob Knepper (3-3). 
</P>
<P>
Harkey (5-1) pitched five innings before his right shoulder stiffened. He 
allowed seven hits, walked none and struck out four. Chicago Manager Don Zimmer 
was ejected in the fourth inning after Ryne Sandberg hit what was called a 
two-run homer by third base umpire Bill Hohn. When Giant Manager Roger Craig 
objected, the umpires changed the call.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER LUKAS' STAKE SWEEP IN N.Y., STEINLEN PROVIDES ICING IN THE WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wayne Lukas' barn, which swept the three stakes at Belmont Park during the 
weekend, kept right on winning Monday at Hollywood Park as Steinlen caught 
Hawkster in the stretch to win the $500,000 Hollywood Turf Handicap by a neck 
before a crowd of 30,091. 
</P>
<P>
"This ranks right up there with the Breeders' Cup," Lukas said, referring to 
the day at Churchill Downs in 1988 when he saddled horses that won three of the 
seven million-dollar races. 
</P>
<P>
Stella Madrid won the Acorn at Belmont Saturday, Profit Key won Sunday's Peter 
Pan there and earlier Monday Criminal Type beat Easy Goer and Housebuster in 
the Metropolitan Mile Handicap. Jeff Lukas, Wayne's son and No. 1 assistant, 
saddled the three winners in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Of the four victories, only Profit Key's was expected. Stella Madrid was 
considered the lesser half of an entry with stablemate Seaside Attraction, who 
finished third; Criminal Type paid $18.80; and Steinlen, even though he was 
last year's national male grass champion, was the third betting choice in a 
six-horse field at Hollywood and paid $9.60. 
</P>
<P>
Golden Pheasant, who had won both of his American starts since arriving from 
Europe, went off the even-money favorite and finished a sluggish fourth, beaten 
by almost six lengths. Hawkster, the second choice at 5-2, set the pace as 
expected and was 3 1/2 lengths ahead at the top of the stretch. But he and Gary 
Stevens were worn down by Steinlen and Laffit Pincay in the last 60 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkster finished 5 1/2 lengths in front of Santangelo, the Argentine-bred who 
is still winless in eight American races. Still, Santangelo, the longest price 
on the board at 30-1, earned $75,000 for finishing third. Steinlen's purse was 
$275,000 and Hawkster earned $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Pincay, 43, became the first jockey to win $150 million in purses. Angel 
Cordero is next on the list with a total of more than $148 million. 
</P>
<P>
Pincay got the chance to ride Steinlen because Jose Santos, who is usually 
astride the 7-year-old son of Habitat and Southern Seas, stayed in New York to 
ride Criminal Type. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the biggest thrills, especially with a win on Steinlen," Pincay 
said. "It was something I was looking forward to the whole week. It was nice to 
do it this way." 
</P>
<P>
The Turf Handicap was Pincay's 7,385th victory, and No. 7,386 came about 30 
minutes later when he rode another Lukas horse, Le Voyageur, in the day's last 
race. Pincay, who had three winners for the day, now has a purse total of 
$150,281,039. 
</P>
<P>
On a soft turf course that was labeled good because of overnight rain, Hawkster 
sprinted to a five-length lead after a half-mile, setting moderate fractions of 
48 3/5 and 1:13 1/5 for three-quarters of a mile. The winning time was 2:03. 
</P>
<P>
"The soft turf probably wasn't to my horse's advantage," said Ron McAnally, who 
trains Hawkster. "But at the head of the stretch, I still thought he was going 
to get it." 
</P>
<P>
McAnally had heard last week that Lukas might not run Steinlen. "I was rooting 
that he wouldn't run," McAnally said. "Because I knew he was the one to beat." 
</P>
<P>
Although Steinlen won the Arlington Million last year at 1 1/4 miles, he ran at 
shorter distances the rest of the year, clinching the grass title by winning 
the Breeders' Cup Mile at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
"A mile and a quarter is certainly within his grasp," Lukas said. "In fact, I 
think he can run even farther than that." 
</P>
<P>
Steinlen has won 19 of 39 starts and Monday's victory increased his purses to 
$2.7 million. Daniel Wildenstein's horse began this year with a seventh-place 
finish in the Arcadia Handicap at Santa Anita, where he won the El Rincon 
Handicap before finishing third, two lengths behind the victorious Golden 
Pheasant in the John Henry Handicap at Hollywood May 13. Steinlen carried six 
more pounds than Golden Pheasant that day; Monday, Steinlen carried 124 pounds 
and Hawkster and Golden Pheasant carried 122. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the soft course had anything to do with the way my horse ran," 
said Chris McCarron, who was aboard Golden Pheasant. "Because he breezed over 
at Santa Anita on a course much like this one, and did all right." 
</P>
<P>
Golden Pheasant was third on the far turn, but couldn't make up any ground. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no excuse," McCarron said. "He just didn't kick in like he needed to. I 
gave him about three pumps at the head of the lane, and I knew I was in 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Lukas' early goal for Steinlen this year is another crack at the Arlington 
Million, and Lukas said he would run at least twice before then. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Lukas will bring Criminal Type back to California to run in the 
Hollywood Gold Cup June 24. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a million-dollar race," Lukas said. "As good as that horse is now, 
that's the place where you want him to be." 
</P>
<P>
Million-dollar races are not new to Criminal Type, who won the Pimlico Special, 
another seven-figure stake, in Maryland earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Lukas said that his barn earned $2 million in purses for May. . . . For 
the year, Lukas has won more than $5 million, about twice the total of Charlie 
Whittingham, second in the national trainer standings. . . . Laffit Pincay won 
the Hollywood Turf Handicap for the fifth time, breaking a tie for the record 
with Bill Shoemaker. Pincay won the stake three consecutive times -- with 
Exploded, Erins Isle and John Henry -- starting in 1981. His other winner was 
Life Cycle in 1973. . . . The only horse older than Steinlen to win the stake 
was John Henry, who was a 9-year-old when he won in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few horses who will run against Sunday Silence in the Californian 
next Sunday is Charlatan III, who hasn't won since 1988. . . . Sunny Blossom 
won Monday's Oakland Handicap at Golden Gate Fields by nine lengths, running 
six furlongs in 1:08 4/5. . . . A $60,000 race at Hollywood Park Monday was won 
by Annual Date, who had been winless since September.

TRIPLE CROWN RATINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
REMARKS: When Frank Stronach finds horses he wants, he knows how to go after 
them. Stronach, a 57-year-old Canadian industrialist, leads with his strength, 
which is an open checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
It's a method that doesn't always work. Early this year, Stronach sent 
owner-trainer Ron McAnally a contract, offering about $2 million for a 75% 
interest in Silver Ending. McAnally said no, and after Silver Ending won the 
Arkansas Derby, Stronach renewed his interest, in effect telling the colt's 
owners to name their price. 
</P>
<P>
Stronach still doesn't own Silver Ending, but his $2-million offer to Claiborne 
Farm late last year for Yonder was accepted, and on Monday, in the $500,000 
Jersey Derby at Garden State Park, the Seattle Slew colt showed for the first 
time that he might be worth his sale price. 
</P>
<P>
Yonder beat Video Ranger by a head for the $300,000 first-place purse, and it's 
likely that both colts ran their way into the Belmont Stakes June 9. 
</P>
<P>
Yonder had been trained by Woody Stephens, who won five consecutive Belmonts in 
the 1980s. But after Stephens was hospitalized last month, Stronach turned all 
of his horses over to Angel Penna Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Under Stephens' guidance this year, Yonder couldn't beat the best horses in 
Florida, Kentucky or New York. Stephens was saying that the colt's future would 
be on grass, but Yonder's victory in the Jersey Derby will keep him on the main 
track for a while. 
</P>
<P>
The Jersey Derby was Yonder's first victory since the Remsen at Aqueduct in 
November. It was shortly after the Remsen that Stronach showed up with his 
checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
Video Ranger, claimed away from Wayne Lukas for $40,000 at Santa Anita in 
January, ran second in the Santa Anita Derby and was fourth, at 60-1, in the 
Kentucky Derby. Video Ranger bled slightly from the lungs in the Kentucky Derby 
and Monday ran with Lasix, a diuretic frequently given to bleeders. In the 
Belmont, however, neither Video Ranger nor Unbridled, the Kentucky Derby winner 
who also has a history of bleeding, will be able to run on Lasix because of New 
York racing rules. 
</P>
<P>
Ian Jory, who is the third trainer Video Ranger has had, thought racing luck 
might have kept the colt out of the winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
"My horse got squeezed at the sixteenth pole and (jockey Ron) Hansen lost his 
outside rein and the horse slowed down," Jory said. 
</P>
<P>
The field for the Belmont is expected to include Unbridled, Mister Frisky, Land 
Rush, Yonder, Video Ranger, Go and Go, Country Day, Hawaiian Pass and Dotsero. 
</P>
<P>
Country Day, injured the day before the Kentucky Derby and scratched from the 
race, bounced back Sunday at Belmont Park in the 1 1/8-mile Peter Pan. He came 
from last place to finish second, 6 1/2 lengths behind Profit Key, who was not 
nominated for the Triple Crown races. 
</P>
<P>
"After he hopped in the air coming out of the gate, he really ran good," said 
Chris Antley, who rode Country Day. "I knew at the quarter pole that we weren't 
going to catch Profit Key. But I think my colt would have no trouble with the 
(1 1/2-mile) Belmont distance." 
</P>
<P>
Advisory panel for The Times' Triple Crown Ratings: Lenny Hale, vice president 
for racing at Aqueduct, Belmont Park and Saratoga; Frank (Jimmy) Kilroe, vice 
president for racing at Santa Anita; and Tommy Trotter, racing secretary at 
Arlington International Racecourse and Gulfstream Park.

INVESTORS FACE HIGH-STAKES BATTLE FOR CASINO PROFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When former California Assemblyman David Pierson set out seven years ago to 
finance construction of the world's largest card casino, he and two associates 
put up a total of $10,000 with hopes of someday turning a tidy profit. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they became sudden multimillionaires. Since 1985, financial records 
show, the Bicycle Club in Bell Gardens has produced more than $50 million in 
profits for the three investors and their limited partners. 
</P>
<P>
The casino proceeds have helped Pierson, Beverly Hills bank executive M. Dale 
Lyon and business consultant Julieann Coyne Wasson acquire luxurious homes, 
fancy foreign cars and fat bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
While attaining overnight wealth is not unheard of in some quarters of 
celebrity-studded Southern California, the Bicycle Club case is striking 
because the three investors now stand to lose their bonanza just as quickly as 
they got rich. 
</P>
<P>
When U.S. District Judge Norman C. Roettger Jr. ordered the seizure of the 
Bicycle Club in March -- making it the single largest asset ever forfeited to 
the federal government -- he also froze millions of dollars in monthly casino 
profits to LCP Associates, the partnership named for Lyon, Coyne and Pierson. 
Last week, Roettger released profits for a separate, minority group of partners 
led by the casino's general manager, George Hardie, but the profits of Lyon, 
Coyne and Pierson remain frozen. 
</P>
<P>
After growing accustomed to extraordinary wealth, the LCP investors now find 
themselves in the uncomfortable position of struggling financially to meet 
exorbitant monthly bills. 
</P>
<P>
To get their profits back, the three must prove in Roettger's Ft. Lauderdale 
courtroom that they are innocent investors who were unaware that an 
international drug money laundering operation funneled proceeds through the 
Bicycle Club. Federal prosecutors maintain that the government is entitled to 
LCP's 65% share of the Bicycle Club because the partnership arranged for the 
initial financing of $12 million in marijuana profits to build the casino. 
</P>
<P>
"The government's case is that these guys invested $10,000 and are now making 
$300,000 a month, so they must be crooks," said Richard Marmaro, a Century City 
lawyer who represents Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon, Coyne and Pierson each refused to be interviewed for this story. Through 
their attorneys and court documents, all three partners denied knowing that 
casino construction funds came from drug profits. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, none of the three LCP investors have been charged with any 
wrongdoing, nor were they suspects in the recent drug money laundering trial 
that netted the convictions of one LCP partner and three Miami associates. 
</P>
<P>
A federal civil trial scheduled for the fall in U.S. District Court in Southern 
Florida is expected to determine if the investors had direct knowledge of the 
drug profits and whether they get to keep their shares of the Bicycle Club. 
</P>
<P>
During a forfeiture hearing last month, Lyon, 60, and Coyne, 40, were singled 
out by Assistant U.S. Atty. Robert Bondi as the partners who were "going to 
have a rather rough road to hoe" in trying to persuade the court that they have 
"clean hands." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, interviews and court documents reveal that Lyon and Pierson, 55, 
often had direct financial dealings with members of the narcotics money 
laundering network. 
</P>
<P>
Marmaro said flatly in an interview that federal prosecutors do not have a case 
against the LCP investors. 
</P>
<P>
The Bicycle Club's phenomenal success can be attributed to "a lot of hard work 
and risk" taken by the partners, Marmaro said. He likened Lyon to Alexander 
Graham Bell, Henry Ford and John D. Rockefeller -- entrepreneurs who relied on 
an idea, not a large investment, to launch profitable ventures. 
</P>
<P>
"No one believed that the Bicycle Club would be as enormously successful as it 
has been," Marmaro said. 
</P>
<P>
The casino, valued at $150 million, yielded $23.4 million in net profits last 
year, and is the source of nearly half of the $21-million annual budget of the 
city of Bell Gardens. Nearly 2,000 people work there, operating 168 gaming 
tables around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
As the principal organizer of LCP, Pierson has received the largest share of 
the net profits -- $14.5 million since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
It was through the legendary developer and UCLA basketball booster Sam Gilbert 
that Pierson and his partners acquired their fortunes. Prosecutors said Gilbert 
funneled millions in marijuana profits through Southern California banks and 
businesses as part of a scheme to launder drug funds and finance the Bicycle 
Club. Gilbert died at age 74 of heart failure three days before he was indicted 
in November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, a large part of the LCP partners' case to the government will focus 
on denouncing Gilbert -- the very man responsible for their stunning financial 
success -- and denying any involvement in his dealings with drug proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
Pierson, for example, claims that he "had no reason to suspect that a man of 
Sam Gilbert's reputation, background and resources would be involved in illegal 
money laundering," his Florida attorney, Robert L. Shevin, wrote in court 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
Marmaro added in an interview: "They were dealing with a man, Sam Gilbert, who 
had an impeccable reputation, or so everybody thought. They weren't dealing 
with Al Capone. . . . No one knew at that time what we know now about Sam 
Gilbert." 
</P>
<P>
The LCP profits paid to Gilbert's three adult children and his grandchildren -- 
who thus far have received approximately $10 million -- also have been seized 
by the government pending the outcome of the forfeiture case. His eldest son, 
Michael, faces a possible 35 years in prison pending his sentencing on four 
guilty verdicts in the money- 
</P>
<P>
laundering trial. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Roettger signed an order releasing a portion of the Bicycle Club's 
monthly profits to 25 investors who own the 35% of the casino not held by LCP. 
The group is led by Hardie, the club's colorful general manager, who has 
cooperated with federal authorities from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Hardie nor his partners "have any illegal interest in the Bicycle Club 
which should be forfeited to the United States," according to a letter written 
last November by the U.S. attorney's office in Southern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
No such statement from federal authorities has cleared Lyon, Coyne or Pierson. 
</P>
<P>
The Bicycle Club was born from a dream that Pierson held since the 1970s. 
Having spent two decades as a lawyer, an Inglewood city councilman and a state 
legislator representing South-Central Los Angeles, he sought to obtain a card 
club license -- first in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials there rejected all bids, including Pierson's, and it wasn't 
until 1983 that he spotted an opportunity to finance a card casino in Bell 
Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
What follows is a chronology -- based on dozens of interviews, thousands of 
pages of court documents and extensive witness testimony given during the 
money-laundering trial -- of how the Bicycle Club was financed by the LCP 
investors with the help of Sam Gilbert and his Miami drug associates. 
</P>
<P>
It was Hardie, later to become general manager of the Bicycle Club, who first 
acquired the rights to 20 acres in Bell Gardens and a city license to operate a 
club there in 1982. Within a year, however, Hardie was having difficulty 
raising the millions of dollars he needed in construction funds. 
</P>
<P>
Hardie had met Pierson several years earlier when Hardie was promoting a 
statewide dog racing initiative. In the spring of 1983, Pierson suggested a 
plan: Hardie would contribute his club license and the site while Pierson would 
raise $12 million in financing. Pierson and his associates would get a 65% 
ownership interest in the Bicycle Club, with the remaining 35% for Hardie and 
his partners. 
</P>
<P>
All Pierson had to do was come up with the $12 million. For this, he turned to 
Sam Gilbert, a man he knew to be of significant wealth. Gilbert, after all, had 
made personal loans to Pierson totaling $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
Pierson was first introduced to Gilbert by Julieann Coyne in 1981. That same 
year, he recruited Gilbert as a founding director of Olympic National Bank, 
which Pierson organized and is headquartered in Gilbert's Trident Center in 
West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-1983, Pierson brought a Bicycle Club prospectus to Coyne and asked her 
to present it to Gilbert. Coyne and Gilbert were "very close personal friends," 
Pierson testified during the criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, after reviewing the Bicycle Club plans, agreed to supply $12 million 
in financing from an offshore trust account in return for 60% of Pierson's 
nearly two-thirds share of the Bicycle Club. 
</P>
<P>
But before the agreement was finalized, Gilbert had a sudden change of heart. 
He decided to give equal shares of his interest in the casino to Coyne and her 
former boss at Imperial Bank, Dale Lyon. Coyne had introduced Gilbert to Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
Under Gilbert's plan, he would furnish the $12 million to the Bicycle Club. In 
return, his construction firm would receive a $2-million fee to build the 
casino. 
</P>
<P>
Pierson went along with Gilbert's wishes and organized LCP Associates, which 
became the principal owner of the Bicycle Club. The partnership was formed in 
November, 1983, with an initial investment of $10,000 -- Pierson paid $4,000 to 
cover his 40% interest in LCP and Lyon and Coyne put in $3,000 apiece for their 
30% shares. The money went toward the cost of establishing the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Lyon was appointed president of CGL Investments Inc., a 
partnership Gilbert formed along with Coyne to receive the $12 million in 
laundered money, prosecutors alleged in court. They called CGL "nothing more 
than a repository for drug money." 
</P>
<P>
In late 1983, Lyon met with Miami lawyer Melvyn Kessler at the L'Ermitage Hotel 
in Beverly Hills to discuss the offshore accounts that would finance the 
Bicycle Club. Kessler was later convicted in the money laundering trial on 
conspiracy and racketeering charges. Lyon also would travel with Gilbert to 
Washington, New York and Florida to confer with Kessler and two other Miami 
drug associates, Jack and Barry Benjamin Kramer. The Kramers were found guilty 
of the same charges as Kessler; in addition, Ben Kramer is serving a life 
sentence in a related drug smuggling case. 
</P>
<P>
Within a year and a half of Gilbert forming the partnerships to fund the 
Bicycle Club, Coyne mysteriously dropped out of any further involvement in the 
casino. She gave up her work as a personnel consultant at the casino before she 
could contribute to the club's astounding success, reduced her role in LCP to 
limited partner status in 1984, and resigned from CGL Investments in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Gilbert had arranged for her to own a lucrative share of the Bicycle 
Club, he had insisted that Coyne be given responsibility for screening and 
hiring casino employees, Hardie testified. 
</P>
<P>
One of Coyne's first decisions involved the hiring of her longtime manicurist 
as a $30,000-a-year personnel director, said sources familiar with the casino's 
start-up operation. With Coyne out of the picture several months later, the 
manicurist was dismissed, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Coyne had virtually nothing to do with the Bicycle Club by 1985, she 
has collected $9.7 million in casino profits through last year. 
</P>
<P>
Her departure left Lyon, Pierson and Gilbert to oversee the club's financing 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon played a key role as the bookkeeper who handled the paper work and 
financial transactions from 1984 to 1987 among the Bicycle Club, LCP, the 
investment firm CGL and the offshore accounts. He would follow Gilbert's 
directions in dispersing and depositing millions of dollars in checks, Marmarow 
said. He was the casino's first chief financial officer and has received $13.8 
million in club profits. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1984, the Bicycle Club received $12 million in Miami drug money 
that initially was laundered in Los Angeles by Gilbert before being sent to 
foreign accounts in the tiny European country of Liechtenstein and the Virgin 
Islands, according to federal authorities. From there, financial documents 
show, the funds were wired to CGL Investments and passed on to the Bicycle 
Club. The casino broke ground on April Fool's Day in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
When the casino's construction costs incurred by Gilbert's firm soared to $22 
million in 1984, Lyon and Pierson secured an additional $10 million in loans 
from banks and business associates. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Bicycle Club opened on time in November, 1984. Within three months, 
it began making a profit and grew wildly successful later that year after it 
was permitted to introduce popular Asian card games. 
</P>
<P>
After the club was built, Lyon loaned $1.6 million in money received from the 
offshore accounts to Jack Kramer, the Miami associate who was recently 
convicted. Lyon testified that he issued the loan at the request of Gilbert, 
but Kramer failed to repay the money. The loan was one of several advances of 
laundered funds that Lyon made to Kramer at the direction of Gilbert, Lyon said 
in court. 
</P>
<P>
In what Lyon's lawyer described as "the most curious transaction" in the 
Bicycle Club case, Pierson gave $500,000 in LCP profits to Jack Kramer without 
notifying Lyon or Coyne. The money, which Pierson intended as a loan, was never 
repaid, Pierson acknowledged in court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Pierson said he made the loan in April, 1986, when Gilbert asked him to help 
one of his longtime family and business friends. "I was delighted to be able to 
do a favor for Sam Gilbert," he testified. 
</P>
<P>
Two months later, at Gilbert's request, Pierson loaned an additional $200,000 
in Bicycle Club profits to Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
By then, federal authorities were on the trail of the money laundering 
operation after receiving a tip from Scotland Yard about the suspicious nature 
of the offshore accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon and Pierson first learned of the criminal investigation in November, 1986, 
when they were contacted by federal agents for an interview. Several months 
later, the Miami drug associates demanded the return of the $12 million in 
Bicycle Club funds to yet another foreign account in Switzerland, prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, Gilbert had become fed up with the financial complications and 
withdrew from any further involvement in the casino. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Miami associates had no right under the loan agreement to demand a 
sudden repayment of the loan, Lyon and Pierson helped refinance the Bicycle 
Club, which by then was generating substantial profits. Both partners said in 
court that they did so to save $700,000 a month in interest payments. They 
denied participating in any effort to conceal the funds from authorities. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1987, a federal grand jury returned indictments against Gilbert 
and his Miami colleagues. The case attracted little attention in Southern 
Florida, where drug trials are commonplace and create scant publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bicycle Club profits continued to soar. In the past two years alone, 
the LCP partners have received more than $30 million in profits from the club. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to preserve their future monthly casino dividends, the LCP 
investors recently filed court affidavits pleading for the reinstatement of 
their profits. 
</P>
<P>
Pierson appears to be in the best position to retain his interest in the 
Bicycle Club, according to Shevin, Pierson's Miami lawyer. This is because 
unlike Lyon or Coyne, Pierson had no role in the CGL investment firm that 
interacted with the Miami drug associates, Shevin said. Pierson also agreed to 
testify at the criminal trial without demanding immunity from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Coyne refused to appear at the criminal trial, citing her constitutional 5th 
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. And Lyon testified only under 
the condition that he receive immunity from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
As the forfeiture trial nears, even those with the slightest connection to the 
casino have hired lawyers to scramble for a slice of the jackpot. These include 
Lyon's children, Coyne's husband, Pierson's ex-wife, Gilbert's two sons, his 
disabled daughter and grandchildren and even the former spouse of Ben Kramer, 
the convicted narcotics smuggler. The relatives and children of the LCP 
partners were given the ownership shares and had no involvement in financing 
the casino.

Recently, Roettger noted the high stakes involved in the case as he peered 
across a courtroom packed with attorneys charging as much as $100,000 a month 
in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never had so many lawyers in one case whose meters have been running so 
long," he said. "Clearly this is a matter of considerable interest, especially 
in the Los Angeles area, or I would not have so many distinguished lawyers here 
looking out for (their clients') interests."

The death toll grew to at least 22 in gun battles in the Armenian capital of 
Yerevan as militants armed with machine guns and Molotov cocktails fought 
Soviet troops, casting a deadly pall on Monday's ceremonies marking the 
Transcaucasian land's brief independence. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of independence day celebrations, we have a day of mourning," the 
republic's Communist Party leader, Vladimir Movsisyan, said as he went on 
television to appeal to his people for calm and to lament a "tragic day for 
Armenia." 
</P>
<P>
Word of the first shoot-out, at the train station in Yerevan, surfaced Sunday 
when state-run Soviet media reported that six armed militants had been killed 
in an attack on Soviet internal security troops. But details of a far deadlier 
gunfight outside a military base, in which at least 15 people, including a 
soldier, died, became known only later. 
</P>
<P>
Another Armenian was reported killed in Yerevan by gunfire from Soviet troops 
early Monday. Though Armenia has been locked since 1988 in an often brutal 
territorial dispute with the neighboring Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, never 
had death and violence on such a scale intruded into the city of 1.2 million, 
and many of its inhabitants were admittedly bewildered and bracing for more 
unrest. 
</P>
<P>
For Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet president, who already faces widespread 
discontent over his economic reforms and a pro-independence movement in the 
Baltic republics, it was another possible crisis to preoccupy him as he leaves 
today for Canada and a summit meeting in Washington with President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"This clash with the military is unprecedented; nothing like this has ever 
happened before in Yerevan," Levon G. Airamyants, deputy chief of the political 
information department at Armenia's Foreign Ministry, said by telephone. "The 
people are stunned." 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of nationalist Armenian groups such as the Karabakh Committee called 
the gun battles a provocation to discredit the grass-roots Armenian National 
Movement, which scored an impressive victory in recent parliamentary elections 
against Communist Party candidates and was planning this week to nominate its 
slate for municipal offices. 
</P>
<P>
But Col. Gen. Yuri Shatalin, in Yerevan to direct Interior Ministry troop units 
charged with keeping the peace, placed the blame for the violence squarely on 
Armenian authorities, saying they have long been in cahoots with the armed 
extremists whose actions they are now deploring. 
</P>
<P>
"Bloodshed in Yerevan is the result of overt connivance of the republican 
leadership and law enforcement agencies with illegal armed groups," Shatalin 
told the official news agency Tass. "They did not devote proper attention to 
the fact that a major part of the militant armed formations are concentrated in 
the capital of the republic, that they drive around the city in stolen cars, 
carrying captured weapons." 
</P>
<P>
He demanded "resolute measures" to seize their arms, but such a step would be 
politically dangerous for the Armenian leadership. The armed groups have 
flourished in the two-year feud with Azerbaijan about jurisdiction over the 
disputed Nagorno-Karabakh district, and they are regarded by many Armenians as 
a sort of national guard protecting them from Azerbaijani attack. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday afternoon, as many as 100,000 people rallied in Yerevan in a somber 
mood to commemorate the two years of Armenian independence in 1918-20, before 
Russian Bolsheviks, aided by their Armenian sympathizers, took power and 
proclaimed the rocky homeland north of Turkey a Soviet republic. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing that troops angered by the Sunday violence might attack them, 
organizers of the ceremony scratched a planned march to the grave of the first 
chairman of the Armenian Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Though accounts of what happened Sunday at the military base were still 
incomplete, versions offered by Armenians conflicted with Soviet accounts. 
Rafael A. Popoyan, a Yerevan activist who has furnished reliable information in 
the past, accused the soldiers of firing first, and apparently at random. 
</P>
<P>
"By 4 or 5 p.m., a large armored column, 16 armored personnel carriers in all, 
started to move from the interior troops' garrison on the outskirts of Yerevan 
toward the center," Popoyan said by telephone. "Residents tried to stop the 
column by putting heavy trucks in its way and hastily building barricades." 
</P>
<P>
Those actions didn't work, Popoyan said, and the convoy entered central Yerevan 
via Erebuni Boulevard, "where it suddenly started shooting at people who were 
passing by and at windows, killing many people," he claimed. His account could 
not be independently verified. 
</P>
<P>
The Armenian National Movement reported that the dead included a 13-year-old 
girl and that 30 civilians were injured in the cross-fire. 
</P>
<P>
The Tass account was completely different. It said about 50 armed militants 
blockaded the barracks of an Interior Ministry regiment by seizing a hill that 
commanded the area and climbing into the attics of nearby buildings. 
</P>
<P>
They blasted the base with firearms, including machine guns, killing the unit's 
deputy commander, a Lt. Col. Chekmarev, Tass said. In the return fire, 14 
militants were reported killed and 36 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Shakhnazaryan of the official Armenpress news agency in Yerevan said the 
Armenians were armed with Molotov cocktails and submachine guns, presumably 
stolen from military or police arsenals. State-run Soviet television news 
showed footage of armed Armenians bobbing and weaving as they ran for cover. 
</P>
<P>
After the convoy left the base, armed columns of militants converged on the 
center of Yerevan, where reinforcements of internal security troops were also 
being sent, Popoyan said. More moderate Armenians negotiated the withdrawal of 
the armed irregulars, and, according to David Motevosayn of the Armenian 
National Movement, the deputy chief of Yerevan's military garrison pledged that 
troops would not be used further under any circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
But Armenian activists accused the deputy chief of breaking his word only hours 
later. At 6 a.m. Monday, Popoyan said, "armored personnel carriers drove around 
the city at breakneck speed." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, soldiers reportedly shot up the headquarters of the Armenian 
National Movement. No one inside was hurt, but a 24-year-old man was killed as 
he slept in his parked car in front of the building, Popoyan said. "For some 
reason, the soldiers towed the car with its dead occupant to the (Armenian 
Communist Party) Central Committee building and left it there," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Though Tass repeated official contentions that the Interior Ministry troops at 
Yerevan's train station had fired only when attacked, Leon Grogoryan of the 
Armenian Foreign Ministry's press department claimed that the soldiers shot 
first. 
</P>
<P>
"An armed group entered the building and demanded the MVD (Interior Ministry) 
people hand over their arms. But the MVD people disregarded their order and 
opened fire," Grogoryan said. 
</P>
<P>
Popoyan also noted that if the militants had fired first, they must have been 
terribly poor marksmen since, according to Tass, none of the soldiers were 
killed while six Armenians were. 
</P>
<P>
However, official Soviet reports said that 10 of the soldiers were wounded, and 
Armenpress reported Monday that one had died, though that report could not be 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Popoyan said that according to the most recent information possessed by the 
Armenian National Movement, 23 Armenians were killed in Yerevan on Sunday, nine 
innocent civilians caught in the cross-fire and 14 militants carrying arms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms have unleashed fierce ethnic tensions 
in the Transcaucasus region, suppressed for decades by the Kremlin. Passions 
are running high in Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh -- a predominately Armenian 
enclave that is inside neighboring Azerbaijan and is administered from the 
Azerbaijani capital, Baku. In the last two years, hundreds have been killed in 
clashes between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over the territory. Last year, 
Gorbachev brought the enclave under Moscow's direct rule. But his later 
decision to hand it back to Baku has turned Armenian nationalist anger on the 
Kremlin.

BORDER PATROL'S DRUG WAR ROLE IS QUESTIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Agents of the U.S. Border Patrol, longstanding gatekeepers against illegal 
immigration, increasingly are taking a role in the effort to staunch the flow 
of illicit drugs through the nation's frontiers, particularly along the 
U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
From California to Texas, green-uniformed border guards are seizing more 
cocaine, marijuana and other controlled substances than ever before, a fact 
that officials say is traceable to the rising quantities of drugs entering the 
United States from Mexico via the almost 2,000-mile international boundary 
line. 
</P>
<P>
The patrol's widening anti-drug presence -- most agents have been given the 
legal authority in recent years to make drug arrests -- has sparked a debate 
about whether narcotics interdiction is an appropriate mission for an agency 
principally charged with enforcing immigration law. 
</P>
<P>
For example, on Friday a U.S. District Court judge in San Diego rejected as 
unconstitutional a proposal by federal prosecutors to expand the Border 
Patrol's legal charter to include illicit drug checks at the freeway 
checkpoints on Interstate 5 and Interstate 15 running north from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
From its birth, however, the Border Patrol has taken a contraband-fighting role 
-- starting with its Prohibition-era duties in deterring liquor traffickers. 
The agency, created by Congress in 1924 with the appointment of 450 "former 
mounted guards, policemen, sheriffs, (and) gunslingers of various types," 
according to an official history, now finds itself on the front lines of the 
nation's high-profile war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Seizure statistics reflect the trend. During the most recent fiscal year, 
border agents recorded more than 5,000 drug seizures, netting $1.2 billion 
worth of cocaine, marijuana, heroin and other prohibited substances. In fiscal 
1982, the Border Patrol made fewer than 500 seizures nationwide, confiscating 
slightly more than $5 million worth of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The burgeoning anti-drug profile of an agency that annually records almost 1 
million or more immigration-related arrests -- making it by far the nation's 
most prolific arresting body -- has generated rising concern among immigrant 
advocates and others who worry that officers trained in a host of exhaustively 
complex immigration matters are ill-equipped for the added task of narcotics 
law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
An independent study released in March by the RAND Corp. and the Urban 
Institute, two public-policy research bodies, found that "competing new 
missions" for U.S. immigration authorities -- including additional drug 
enforcement -- resulted in a reduction in manpower directed at implementing 
aspects of the sweeping 1986 immigration law reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"You're sort of boot-strapping this agency into becoming a major player in drug 
interdiction when they don't have the skills," said Charles Wheeler, director 
of the National Immigration Law Center, a Los Angeles-based immigrant rights 
group. "I have no problem with responding to drug interdiction in a major way, 
but not taking the Border Patrol and adding this to the 400 roles that it 
already has." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. authorities disagree, contending that the nation's 3,800 border guards -- 
most of whom are posted along the international boundary while some are 
assigned to inland stations -- are equal to the interdiction task. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that we are not only adequately trained but superbly trained" for 
drug-related and other responsibilities, said William L. Bonnette, acting 
assistant commissioner for the U.S. Border Patrol in Washington. He said that 
the patrol's 18-week training course included instruction in a "full range of 
police sciences," including narcotics interdiction, and that U.S. drug experts 
have provided supplemental preparation. 
</P>
<P>
In the immigrants rights community, there is mounting concern about the 
now-frequent tendency of officials and others to link two distinct 
border-related issues -- undocumented immigration, which is widely viewed as a 
victimless crime, and drug trafficking, an offense that carries a strong social 
stigma. 
</P>
<P>
The constant joining of the two issues "results in an increasingly widespread 
feeling among Border Patrol agents that all immigrants are narco-terrorist 
criminal types, when in fact the vast majority are honest, persevering and 
hard-working people, fleeing abject poverty or civil strife," said Peter Schey, 
executive director of the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, a Los 
Angeles-based advocacy group that defends immigrants rights. "It also plays 
into the hands of xenophobia and other anti-immigrant feelings." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, U.S. officials say, it is increasingly difficult to separate the 
traffic of human and drug contraband, as the two have become increasingly 
entwined in the border area. That, they say, has made the border a much more 
dangerous place, both for guards and migrants, particularly in the San Diego 
area, the most heavily traveled crossing zone. 
</P>
<P>
"The interdiction of drugs and illegals is almost synonymous," said Duke 
Austin, Washington-based spokesman for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service, parent body of the Border Patrol. "You simply don't know when you 
encounter people crossing the border whether they are carrying drugs or not. . 
. . I think there's no question that the character of the old cat-and-mouse 
game at the border has been changed because of the potential for drugs and more 
profit. The border patrolman has to be much more cautious now than he was a few 
years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Border Patrol officials reject any suggestions that their treatment of 
immigrants may be tainted by suspicions of rampant drug-trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
"We always stress that the people we deal with are guests in our country, and 
we try to treat them like guests," said Stuart Gary, a patrol agent at the 
checkpoint along Interstate 5, who spoke as he directed a drug-sniffing dog, 
Astor, to check a waiting car. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the patrol's more pronounced profile in drug enforcement, officials say 
that agents generally are not deliberately attempting to find contraband 
narcotics. While some agents have been assigned to various interagency drug 
efforts, such as the border-wide Operation Alliance, Border Patrol agents 
typically seize drugs as they conduct their normal enforcement rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Border agents are finding more drugs, authorities say, because smugglers -- 
responding to the U.S. enforcement squeeze placed on the South Florida 
trafficking corridor since the early 1980s -- are transporting more and more 
cocaine and other drugs into the United States via the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
"We're out there doing a normal job, catching people, and we essentially 
stumble on the drugs," said Ted A. Swofford, supervisory Border Patrol agent in 
San Diego, home to about 750 patrol agents, the largest contingent nationwide. 
"We don't have drug patrols." 
</P>
<P>
Added Ben Davidian, regional commissioner in Los Angeles for the INS: "We 
didn't go looking for the drug war. It came to us." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, U.S. Border Patrol agents, patrolling the often-vast open stretches of 
land between legal ports of entry, seize an estimated 60% of all contraband 
drugs impounded annually in the border area. U.S. Customs Service officers, who 
are stationed at the ports of entry and conduct aerial anti-drug patrols, are 
responsible for finding the bulk of the remaining seized contraband. 
</P>
<P>
Yet officials concede that resourceful traffickers repeatedly thwart 
enforcement efforts. Smugglers respond efficiently to pressure by finding other 
smuggling routes and methods. Despite the efforts of the drug war, authorities 
seize perhaps 10% of all illicit drugs bound for the U.S. market, according to 
an estimate by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The ingenuity of the border contrabandistas was displayed vividly earlier this 
month when authorities unearthed an extensive underground smuggling chamber 
along the boundary line between the border towns of Douglas, Ariz., and Agua 
Prieta, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
While lawmen long have discovered drugs hidden in vehicles and on the persons 
of undocumented border-crossers, officials say they have noted a recent upsurge 
in the volume of drugs being packed in by so-called "mules," hired men usually 
traveling in groups with bags strapped to their backs. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, authorities in San Diego seized 1,000 pounds of marijuana being 
brought into the United States in mule-train fashion. A year ago, Border Patrol 
agents recovered 10 duffel bags containing 950 pounds of cocaine that was being 
brought into the United States via the rugged border canyons in San Diego. 
Three weeks later, agents stationed at the Border Patrol checkpoint near San 
Clemente along Interstate 5 discovered 800 pounds of cocaine in a 1983 
Oldsmobile sedan. 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's court decision, the U.S. attorney's office in San Diego was seeking 
use of the checkpoints as "dual purpose" facilities, to be used for both 
immigration and drug checks. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems associated with alien smuggling are clearly no more important 
than the scourge of drugs," Assistant U.S. Atty. Patrick K. O'Toole explained 
in court papers. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Judge J. Lawrence Irving rejected the proposal as an unconstitutional 
infringement on constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and 
seizures. However, U.S. officials say they will probably seek the dual purpose 
authority in a future case.

<P>
Mikhail S. Gorbachev goes to Washington this week as a man beleaguered. 
</P>
<P>
Halfway into the task he set himself, reforming the Soviet Union is proving far 
bigger and more difficult than anyone had imagined, and yet there is no going 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"We can only go forward, but each step takes twice the energy of the last," 
Leonid I. Abalkin, the vice prime minister in charge of economic policy, said 
last week as he discussed the strong resistance to the government's latest 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"People are experiencing pain and think, 'It was not supposed to be like this.' 
But hard work does hurt, and it will take a lot of hard work to get us out of 
these crises." 
</P>
<P>
Perestroika, as Gorbachev's reform program is known, has run into three 
interlinked crises -- political, economic and ethnic -- that have grown 
increasingly acute in the past two years. All are at new peaks as the Soviet 
president heads for Canada and the United States today. 
</P>
<P>
As Gorbachev tries to deal with the attempts by the Baltic republics of 
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to secede from the Soviet Union, violence has 
flared again in Armenia. The Soviet Union itself appears headed at times for 
disintegration, largely because the small republics believe they would be 
better off free of the giant and its problems. 
</P>
<P>
As the government makes its first major moves to shift the Soviet economy from 
central planning and state ownership to market forces and entrepreneurship, 
panic has set in all over the country because of the higher prices and 
increased unemployment that will result. But the changes are, in the view of 
radical economists, only another set of half-measures, limited steps taken too 
late without sufficient political resolve to achieve real progress. 
</P>
<P>
As Gorbachev seeks support for further reforms in advance of a Communist Party 
congress planned for early July, the country's new, still emerging political 
structure -- based on glasnost, or openness -- seems more likely to produce 
chaos than results, and its ability to cope with the crises is very much in 
doubt. 
</P>
<P>
And, inevitably, as these crises deepen, there are questions here and abroad 
about Gorbachev's own position, about his leadership, about how long he will 
last, about threats from the conservatives and the military, about who might 
replace him. 
</P>
<P>
This questioning has created in recent months a fourth crisis -- a crisis of 
confidence, not just in Gorbachev's ability to lead but in the nation's ability 
to keep up with him. 
</P>
<P>
"Managing a revolution is never simple, and what we have undertaken is a 
revolution, a change as big and as tumultuous as the revolution of October 
itself," Arkady A. Maslennikov, Gorbachev's press secretary, said, referring to 
the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. "And it is quite true that our president is 
having difficulties now, that there are serious problems, that he is being 
criticized for the way the government is handling them. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But there should be no mistaking his commitment to perestroika, no mistaking 
of the country's concerns and fears for a weakening of will. We are going 
forward -- it is just harder and slower and more painful than we anticipated." 
</P>
<P>
The euphoria that came with the first reforms has long since faded and has been 
succeeded, as the full scope of the country's problems has become apparent, by 
a pessimism so great that many people here feel that not even a generation will 
be enough to correct them. 
</P>
<P>
Recent surveys for the country's leadership by the Soviet Center for the Study 
of Public Opinion show that three-fourths of those questioned across the 
country foresee mounting economic problems and even a "disaster" (14%) in the 
coming year. Politically, nearly 70% see mounting tensions and even a civil war 
(11%). 
</P>
<P>
Trust in the country's leadership has continued to decline, according to the 
center's surveys, and the most trusted institutions now are the churches, the 
press and the armed forces. The Communist Party is rated as "trusted" by only 
16% of the respondents, the government by 23%. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be easier for people if we could tell them, 'Do this today, and 
tomorrow you will get that,' but we cannot," Abalkin commented last week. "This 
is not because we don't know what we are doing; it is because what we are 
attempting has never been done on this scale or in these circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
When they launched the reforms shortly after coming to power in 1985, Gorbachev 
and his supporters in the Soviet leadership thought they would be largely 
corrective, a rejuvenation and re-energizing of the political structure after 
years of stagnation under the late President Leonid I. Brezhnev and a 
restructuring of the economy to give Soviet enterprises a chance to modernize 
and compete. 
</P>
<P>
"He did not come with all his ideas prepared for perestroika," Georgy 
Shakhnazarov, a leading political scientist and a presidential adviser, 
commented earlier this year. "He was prepared to the extent that he understood 
this system could not survive any longer, that we had to restructure and make 
really revolutionary changes in the system. Step by step, we go deeper." 
</P>
<P>
Yegor Yakovlev, the editor of the avant-garde weekly newspaper Moscow News, 
similarly argued in his column last week that too many people, here as well as 
abroad, are concentrating on the problems the Soviet Union faces. In their 
pessimism, he says, they have failed to analyze how far it has come in the five 
years under Gorbachev and how the political system and society have already 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
"The debates about the necessity of a market economy are over," Yakovlev said. 
"What we are arguing about is whether to introduce it next Tuesday or Thursday 
a week. The constitutional autocracy of the Communist Party is giving way to 
the multi-party system. The presidency has put an end to an omnipotent party 
bureaucracy. Where you see chaos, I perceive the dismantling of the old 
system." 
</P>
<P>
These pluses outnumber the minuses in Yakovlev's calculus, and that should be 
grounds for cautious optimism. 
</P>
<P>
Nikolai Shishlin, a senior Communist Party official briefing reporters in 
Washington on Monday in advance of Gorbachev's visit, was similarly upbeat and 
sought to calm fears that the Soviet president has been irreparably damaged. 
</P>
<P>
"For all the tumultuous political process that has developed in Soviet society, 
for all the posturing and emotion that is building up inside the country, for 
all the painful and critical nature of the period we are living through, the 
expansion of perestroika is proceeding," Shishlin said. "The position of 
Gorbachev at present is a strong position and a position of authority." 
</P>
<P>
But the scope of the multiple crises nonetheless is daunting, and top 
government and Communist Party officials do warn openly now of the danger of "a 
social explosion" because of the growing tensions within the country. 
</P>
<P>
Largely as a result of years of economic mismanagement, if not an economy that 
was "deformed" throughout its development, as Soviet officials now say, the 
Soviet Union is collapsing as a political, economic and social system. 
</P>
<P>
Not only can the country, albeit a military superpower, not feed, clothe and 
house its own people, but its old political structure and indeed Soviet society 
itself have not been able to cope with the resulting crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Boris N. Yeltsin, the radical populist, who continues to emerge as Gorbachev's 
principal rival, warns that time is quickly running out for perestroika and 
that, without major changes in the reform program as well as in the leadership, 
there will be "a revolution from below." 
</P>
<P>
"Mikhail Gorbachev has less than a year, perhaps less than six months, to make 
perestroika work," Yeltsin told members of the Russian Congress of People's 
Deputies as he campaigned over the weekend for the chairmanship of the 
congress, a post that would make him, in effect, president of the Soviet 
Union's largest republic. "The people's patience is wearing out. An explosion 
is coming." 
</P>
<P>
Conflicts that divide President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
And Washington tries to forge a policy toward the Soviets. H1.

HEART SERVICE PERFORMANCE REVIEW URGED; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS COULD BE SUBJECT TO PROBATION, SUSPENSION OR 
LOSS OF LICENSE IF THEIR MORTALITY RATES FOR CARDIOVASULAR PROCEDURES ARE TOO 
HIGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
California hospitals with high mortality rates or low volumes of cardiovascular 
procedures such as open-heart surgery and angioplasty would be subject to 
independent performance reviews and possible revocation of their permit to 
offer such services, under regulations being proposed by the state Department 
of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
The regulations would authorize the department to "place the cardiovascular 
service on probation, or if appropriate, suspend or revoke" its license to do 
certain procedures when "substantial quality of care problems are identified." 
A copy of the draft regulations was obtained by The Times last week. 
</P>
<P>
Current regulations "don't really give us any kind of clout," said Teresa 
Hawkes, the department's deputy director for licensing and certification. 
Hawkes termed the proposed regulations "a positive step forward" because they 
put facilities on notice when "there is going to be a review" and possible 
action. 
</P>
<P>
The draft regulations are in part a response to a series of articles in The 
Times in 1988 and 1989, which identified low-volume and high-mortality heart 
surgery hospitals. The articles suggested that many lives could be saved and 
complications averted if more patients were cared for at high-volume, 
low-mortality facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The Times found that about 15% of the state's approximately 100 heart surgery 
hospitals had heart-bypass surgery mortality rates at least 50% above the state 
average. In addition, about a third did not meet the 150-cases-a year minimum 
for all heart surgeries recommended by the state and the American College of 
Surgeons. The minimum is designed to maintain the skills of doctors and nurses. 
Under the proposed regulations, such hospitals would be subject to state 
review. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time in California that regulation of cardiovascular services 
has included explicit quality standards related to the volume and outcome of 
the procedures," said Jonathan Showstack of UC San Francisco's Institute for 
Health Policy Studies. Showstack helped The Times prepare its studies and 
served on an expert advisory committee that assisted the state in drafting the 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
A public hearing on the draft regulations is likely in about 90 days. If the 
process continues on schedule, the final regulations will take effect in early 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, all hospitals would report to the state annually on their 
total number of procedures and mortality rates in categories such as heart 
surgery, angioplasty, and catheterizations. Newly approved cardiovascular 
services would make quarterly reports during their first year of operation. 
</P>
<P>
(Angioplasty is a method in which a balloon-tipped catheter is used to unclog 
heart arteries and catheterization is a technique for diagnosing heart 
diseases). 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals would be required to maintain detailed data on cases. The data would 
include the reasons procedures were performed, elective or emergency status, 
all diagnoses, complications and mortality rates that are adjusted for the 
severity of illness of the patients before the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
For adults, the recommended annual minimums for each hospital are 200 
catheterizations, 100 interventional procedures such as angioplasty and 150 
surgeries. For pediatric heart services, the recommended yearly minimums are 
100 catheterizations and 50 surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals that "do not meet the recommended minimums and/or whose mortality 
rates are 50% above the state average for that year" would be reviewed by the 
state, according to the proposal. A hospital also could be required to conduct 
at its expense and forward to the health services department "an independent 
review of its cardiovascular service" by an expert group approved by the state. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed cardiovascular regulations are part of an ongoing review by the 
state of all its regulations of acute care hospitals, including nursing, 
emergency services and neonatal care.

MORE STUDENTS IN STATE AIMING TO ENTER COLLEGE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: A STATE REPORT SHOWS THAT A GREATER PROPORTION OF THE CLASS OF 1989 
QUALIFIED FOR ADMISSION TO A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY COMPARED WITH HIGH SCHOOL 
GRADUATES OF SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

<P>
More of California's high school students are setting their sights on college, 
a new state Department of Education report showed today. 
</P>
<P>
A greater proportion of the class of 1989 completed course requirements for the 
University of California, enrolled in advanced placement classes and scored 
higher on college entrance exams than did those who graduated just a few years 
earlier, the report found. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been concentrating on getting kids ready for college, and it's paying 
off," Bill Honig, state superintendent of public instruction, said in releasing 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
The report does not include information on how many of these students actually 
entered college. The state Commission on Post Secondary Education compiles 
records only on students who enter a four-year public university in California. 
It does not keep tabs on students who enter two-year community colleges or who 
go to private schools or to colleges out of state. However, its most recent 
data showed there has been some increase in the percentage of graduates 
entering four-year state colleges from 1984 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Using information collected annually from all high schools in California, the 
report compared students who graduated last June with those who graduated in 
1984 and in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
It looked at their Scholastic Aptitude Test scores, at the numbers of students 
taking so-called "advanced placement" tests to earn college credits, the 
numbers enrolled in advanced mathematics, physics and chemistry courses and at 
how many completed all of the courses required for admission to the University 
of California. 
</P>
<P>
The report found that the class of '89 topped its predecessors in all those 
areas. The number of students completing courses required for UC admission, for 
instance, climbed 20% in the state. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, 25.4% of the graduates had completed the required courses, which 
include U.S. history, four years of English, three years of math, a laboratory 
science and two years of a foreign language. By 1989, the number had risen to 
30.6%. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, the percentage of seniors finishing the UC required 
courses in 1985 was identical to the state average -- 25.4%. But 32.9% of the 
class of '89 in the county completed them, pulling ahead of the state average. 
</P>
<P>
Among the county's largest districts, the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School 
District fared the best -- 60.5% of its '89 graduating class finished the UC 
course sequence. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest strides were made by the El Rancho Unified School District in Pico 
Rivera, which saw the numbers of its seniors finishing the courses shoot from 
only 10.7% in 1985 to 61.2% in 1989. And the massive Los Angeles Unified School 
District, staggering under budget problems and explosive growth, nonetheless 
pulled off a 28% increase during that period -- rising from 29.2% to 37.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the numbers of students completing the courses increased among all 
the major ethnic and racial groups. 
</P>
<P>
"These data mean that thousands more students, representing a broader 
cross-section of the population, are prepared for higher education today than 
would have been (the case) if the 1983 status quo had prevailed," Honig said, 
referring to the year a series of reforms was initiated aimed at getting 
students to take tougher courses from a more sophisticated curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
"I am especially pleased that our minority and low-socioeconomic students are 
well represented in this growing college-bound group," said Honig. He planned 
to visit San Francisco's Mission High School today in tribute to its 
accomplishments in getting its predominantly minority, low-income students to 
college. 
</P>
<P>
Some other findings of the report include: 
</P>
<P>
* The rate of seniors passing the advanced placement tests has gone from 9.5 
per 100 students taking the test in 1983-84 to 20.3 in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
* Since 1983-84, enrollments have increased 37% in advanced mathematics, 63% in 
physics and 53% in chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
* The rate of seniors scoring at least 450 on the verbal part of the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test, used by many colleges to help decide on admissions, rose from 
15.5% for the class of '83 to 18.7% for the class of '89. The rate of seniors 
scoring at least 500 on the math portion of the SAT climbed from 16.5% to 20.5% 
in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Honig said all those numbers point to "substantial growth in the pool of young 
people better prepared to go on to college and into the work force." 
</P>
<P>
He cited various programs in several school districts that are aimed at 
encouraging students who might not otherwise include college in their plans. 
They include Project 2000 in Kern County and Advancement Via Individual 
Determination in San Diego, which Honig said have "demonstrated marked 
success." 
</P>
<P>
The Kern County program, for instance, works with 400 students in teams of 100 
each and provides special teacher training and lower class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
"They've had some fantastic results. It shows if you restructure (redesign 
school programs) with a particular objective in mind, it really works," Honig 
said. 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BOUND 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a district-by-district listing of how Los Angeles County high school 
seniors fared on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. In many districts, the 
percentage of seniors scoring at least 450 on the verbal part of the SAT and at 
least 500 on the math part increased between 1984 and 1989. Entrance exam test 
score improvement is just one indication that more students are better prepared 
for college.

ON CALIFORNIA: A NEW FACE FOR EMPIRE OF SAN JOAQUIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There may be, as the Tourist Bureau claims, many "Californias." But, in truth, 
only three really count: the empire of Los Angeles; the empire of the Bay Area; 
and the empire of the San Joaquin Valley. These are the true "Californias," and 
they have ruled the state for most of this century. 
</P>
<P>
This triad is all the more interesting because, every few decades, a tectonic 
shift takes place and the balance of power is forever altered. Since World War 
II, for example, we've seen Los Angeles overtake San Francisco and replace it 
as the imperial city of the West Coast. San Francisco has assumed the secondary 
role of getaway city and obsessive worshiper of its Victorian past. 
</P>
<P>
And now another shift has begun. The San Joaquin Valley, long the most stable 
of the empires, is being transformed from one kind of economic and cultural 
creature to another. As with San Francisco, this change started slowly and its 
outcome, at this point, is hard to predict. Already, however, the 
transformation is altering the political equation in California. 
</P>
<P>
If you drive through the San Joaquin on Highway 99, this evolution -- at first 
-- remains invisible. The highway still rolls past the richest and ugliest 
rural landscape in America. The valley was never so much a "farm" region as it 
was a place where the petrochemical industry converged with agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
These farms contain no farmhouses, no picket fences, only giant machines and 
"managers." These are farms that seem to rise out of the dreams of Henry Ford 
or Andrew Carnegie, not Thomas Hart Benton, and their purpose always has been 
profit on an industrial scale. 
</P>
<P>
And for decades, they have succeeded. The incredible production of cotton, 
grapes, almonds, broccoli, and dozens of other crops by San Joaquin farmers 
remains one of the hoariest truths of the California classroom. The San Joaquin 
Valley is the reason why agriculture is still California's biggest business. 
</P>
<P>
So it's hard to imagine this empire on the wane. But it is. Here's why: 
</P>
<P>
* From Stockton to Fresno, huge numbers of people are flooding into the valley, 
and eventually they will reduce the farmers to a minority. Stockton and Los 
Banos now serve as bedroom communities for the mega-commuters to the Bay Area. 
Fresno has become the fastest-growing, large city in the state. 
</P>
<P>
These new arrivals come with attitudes that are born of the city, not the farm. 
They have little or no connection to agriculture, and at some point their sheer 
numbers will begin to tilt the politics of the valley away from the 
farm/water/chemical axis. 
</P>
<P>
* The valley is suffering environmental decline, and this decline will pit the 
farmers against the new arrivals. Episodes such as the alleged "cluster" of 
cancer cases in the farm town of McFarland are deeply troubling to the 
newcomers, as are Fresno water wells that are being contaminated by pesticides 
on an epidemic scale. 
</P>
<P>
Already, we see some politicians attempting to exploit this potential rift. 
This spring, John K. Van de Kamp rolled into Fresno to stand at a poisoned well 
and promise that his initiative, Big Green, would force agriculture to clean up 
its act. 
</P>
<P>
Partially, this was an appeal to voters in L.A. and San Francisco, but Van ke 
Kamp was also betting that a new day had arrived for politics in the valley. It 
will be interesting to see if his gamble pays off. 
</P>
<P>
* Most incredible of all, farming itself is threatened by the changing 
economics of the valley. No one predicts farming will disappear, but new 
subdivisions rolling outward from the cities already are consuming alarming 
amounts of prime agricultural land, and no one sees an end to it. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Sokolow, political science professor at UC Davis, told an agricultural 
conference in Sacramento recently that he could foresee the day when farming is 
no longer the primary business of the valley. 
</P>
<P>
Sokolow did not think this was good news. Farming has already been pushed out 
of Southern California and the Santa Clara Valley, he said. When farmers are 
forced out of the San Joaquin, where will they go? 
</P>
<P>
No one seems to know. And there are many other questions about the 
transformation of the San Joaquin that will not be answered for years. How 
fast, for example, is the process taking place, and who will rise in local 
political arenas to challenge the boys in the John Deere hats? 
</P>
<P>
One thing does seem clear. The political contrast between the San Joaquin and 
the other two empires is fading, and the role of the valley as a counterweight 
to the coastal cities will continue to diminish. Little by little, and like it 
or not, we are becoming more like each other every day.

Photo, Weather Lets a Bit of Americana Shine Out: The rain having stopped just 
minutes before, four Marine color guards, top, lead off Canoga Park's Memorial 
Day parade. The annual two-mile procession along Sherman Way, De Soto Avenue 
and Vanowen Street attracted about 1,300 marchers and 2,500 spectators, 
including J.D. Walsh, 3, above, of Canoga Park, who came decked out for the 
day. Agnes Jensen, 100, above right, holds Old Glory as she's honored for 
reaching the century mark. Sgt. Dan Mundt, right, of the Air Force recruiting 
office pilots a replica of a jet fighter. Future Farmers of America, below 
right, march with lambs in tow. Among the onlookers are Nam Nguyen, below left, 
of Canoga Park and his children, Tommy, 8, and Christina, 10. Nguyen, who 
served in the South Vietnamese Army, wears his "tiger stripe" camouflage 
uniform. BORIS YARO / Los Angeles Times

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>

<P>
Transmittable Diseases 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 199 to 187, the House adopted an amendment permitting employers to 
switch workers with transmittable diseases such as AIDS from food-handling 
positions to other jobs atno loss of pay. This occurred as the House debated 
legislation (HR 2273) to protect the estimated 43 million disabled Americans 
against discrimination in public accommodations, on the job and in receiving 
basic services. The Americans With Disabilities Act remained in debate. 
</P>
<P>
Amendment supporter Charlie Rose (D-N.C.) said, "Don't ask me to risk the 
health of myself and my family in order to prove how unprejudiced I am about 
communicable diseases." 
</P>
<P>
J. Roy Rowland (D-Ga.) said there is no medical evidence of AIDS being spread 
by food, adding, "We should not here in the Congress be making decisions about 
what are infectious and contagious diseases." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported the amendment.

Cost to Employers 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 187 to 213, the House rejected an amendment to limit the cost to 
businesses of accommodating disabled workers under the Americans with 
Disabilities Act (above). The cost of providing for a handicapped employee was 
to have been capped at 10% of the pay for the job in question. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Bill McCollum (R-Fla.) said, "This is the small-business amendment in 
this legislation." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Bruce A. Morrison (D-Conn.) said, "Arbitrary formula limits are not 
what this legislation is about." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to cap the bill's cost to employers.

SCHOOL DISTRICTS SAY PROPOSED STATE BUDGET CUTS THREATEN PROGRAMS; 
</P>
<P>
RAISES: OFFICIALS FORM A COALITION AND APPEAL TO GOV. DEUKMEJIAN TO INCREASE 
THE COST-OF-LIVING ALLOCATION TO 4.8%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Officials from four eastern Ventura County school districts say their districts 
face a potential financial crisis that could threaten their survival if the 
state budget proposed by Gov. George Deukmejian is approved. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said if they are given a 3% cost-of-living adjustment, as the 
budget proposes, instead of a 4.8% increase reflecting the actual anticipated 
cost increases in the next year, they will have to slash funding for some 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Although some district officials said they have not decided which programs may 
have to be cut, reductions could affect some extracurricular activities, job 
training programs and those that provide help for potential dropouts. Decreased 
funding would also affect everything from class size to facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Conejo Valley, Simi Valley, Oak Park and Moorpark unified 
districts presented the bleak picture at a news conference earlier this month 
in Thousand Oaks. They were joined by a representative of the Las Virgenes 
Unified School District in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Collectively, the five districts, which represent 50,000 students, stand to 
lose more than $3.5 million in state funding next year if they receive the 3% 
cost-of-living adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
The loss in revenue comes at a time when several Ventura County districts are 
already facing budget shortfalls. The Simi Valley district has decided to lay 
off 32 temporary teachers and reassign some administrators to lower-paying 
positions to offset a projected $8.5-million shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
Budget shortfalls have not been restricted to schools. Last week, Deukmejian 
announced that the state is expecting a $3.6-billion budget shortfall for the 
1990-91 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, schools have received budgetary increases from the state that 
kept pace with the cost-of-living increases projected by the Commission on 
State Finance. This year, however, state officials have proposed an increase 
less than the inflation rate because of the projected state shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of the state's projected budget on school districts "has been very, 
very disappointing -- it's been miserable, as a matter of fact," said Helen 
Beebe, board president of the Simi Valley Unified District. 
</P>
<P>
"We had anticipated a continuance" of the statutory cost-of-living increase of 
4.8%, Beebe said. "We had anticipated funding for programs that were mandated 
upon us in prior years. We had not anticipated cutbacks in these areas. The 
erosion of funding has caused us all to suffer a budgetary crunch that is very, 
very difficult, and if it gets any worse it could be almost non-survivable." 
</P>
<P>
If the funding decline continues, some districts could eventually face 
bankruptcy, Beebe said, "and you may be looking at five of them right here." 
The five districts have formed a coalition, called the Suburban Schools State 
Budget Coalition of Ventura and Los Angeles Counties. After the news 
conference, the coalition, along with school representatives from Santa Barbara 
and San Luis Obispo counties, planned to hand-deliver a letter to Deukmejian 
expressing their concerns about the budget. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot wait until June and July to plan next year's programs and staffing," 
the letter said. "We are moving forward in a cutting mode which is disastrous 
for morale and the continuity of education. Therefore, there is an urgency in 
amending the proposed budget." 
</P>
<P>
In a position statement, the coalition urged the full 4.8% cost-of-living 
increase and recommended that existing school programs continue to be fully 
funded before any new programs are begun. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe this is possible by rearranging existing funding priorities within 
the budget and without exceeding the total dollar allotment the governor has 
already set aside for education," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was signed by representatives of the board, teachers' groups, 
management and classified employees from each district. 
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, officials also decried the use of funds from 
Proposition 98, which was intended to give schools more tax revenues in 
exchange for better accountability, and from the California Lottery. Money from 
Proposition 98, for example, which was intended to fund supplemental 
educational programs, has in some cases been used for basic expenses such as 
medical insurance, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were intended to be used as icing on the cake," said Karen Lough, a 
science teacher and president of the Las Virgenes Educators Assn. "That has not 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the lottery generates about 3% of total school revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the proposed budget cuts come at a bad time because many 
districts, including Moorpark and Oak Park, are facing enrollment increases and 
need new schools. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Park Supt. Susan Hearn said a new elementary school was built in her 
district only last year, but just this month officials had to place two 
portable classrooms on the campus to accommodate growth.

2 MEN MISSING IN 2 INCIDENTS OFF VENTURA COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Coast Guard was searching Monday for two men reported missing in separate 
incidents off the Ventura County coast. 
</P>
<P>
The names of both men were withheld pending notification of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
A 36-year-old Rincon man was windsurfing south of Punta Gorda from one to three 
miles offshore about noon when he apparently fell from his board. A witness 
called the Coast Guard after the man, an experienced windsurfer, did not get 
up, Petty Officer Michael Dooley said. 
</P>
<P>
It was uncertain if weather was a factor. 
</P>
<P>
The search was expected to continue until early this morning. 
</P>
<P>
In another incident about 30 minutes later, a 49-year-old man fell into the 
ocean while sailing about two miles off Mandalay State Beach, Dooley said. 
</P>
<P>
"The man attempted to recover a dinghy and fell overboard," Dooley said. His 
sailboat was towed in by the Ventura Harbor Patrol because a woman on the boat 
did not know how to sail, Deputy Harbor Master Leigh Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
The search for the man was suspended late Monday and was scheduled to resume 
this morning.

JACK SMITH: HEAT, DUST AND 'BUCKSHEESH' DIDN'T STOP IN LUXOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By JACK SMITH

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our tour group had a dress party on the river boat one night as we floated down 
the Nile. We were all supposed to wear Egyptian clothes, but I hadn't bought 
anything -- not even a T-shirt. So I wore my light blue seersucker suit with a 
black polo shirt. I thought I looked rather natty, but I was definitely out of 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't believe the costumes my fellow males turned up in. They had dressed 
as everything from Pharaohs to slaves. The women, of course, looked elegant in 
their long, loose djellaba, and their fake gold necklaces. 
</P>
<P>
After dinner we retired to the lounge for a gala show. I wasn't in it. I had 
been asleep in my cabin when they asked for volunteers. They had had one 
rehearsal that afternoon. Amateur theatricals being what they are, I didn't 
expect much. 
</P>
<P>
It was an absolutely stunning show. It was inventive and funny and sexy. I was 
amazed at the unexpected histrionic talents of my tour mates. And I was 
especially amazed at the performance of a woman who had been in my graduation 
class at Belmont High School, and I remembered her as being rather demure. But 
she did a belly dance that was sensational. I was reminded of the old ditty, 
"It must be jelly 'cause jam don't shake like that." 
</P>
<P>
The tone for the evening was set by Sandy Klein, who read the following poem 
(if indeed it is a poem): 
</P>
<P>
 Once onto the plains of the Nile 
</P>
<P>
 A group from L.A. did descend; 
</P>
<P>
 Unsuspecting they came to cruise and have fun, 
</P>
<P>
 Never knowing what this would portend. 
</P>
<P>
 Luxor and Karnak, 
</P>
<P>
 (Offstage) Heat and dust. 
</P>
<P>
 Pyramids and camels, 
</P>
<P>
 (Offstage) Heat and dust. 
</P>
<P>
 Edfu and Esna, 
</P>
<P>
 (Offstage) Heat and dust. 
</P>
<P>
 Pharaohs, gods and small children, 
</P>
<P>
 (Offstage) Heat and dust and baksheesh, 
</P>
<P>
 Lost in time we are reborn and with fevered brains 
</P>
<P>
 Play a history somewhat amended. 
</P>
<P>
 Join us while we cast a spell on the Nile. 
</P>
<P>
 May God Amon be totally offended. 
</P>
<P>
 If Amon was listening, I suspect he was offended. Totally. 
</P>
<P>
I should note that baksheesh is a word that means the tip one is expected to 
pay for any service, however inconsequential and unwanted that service may be. 
The temples are full of locals in robes who point out perfectly obvious works 
of art and then extend their open palms. Mark Twain noted this custom in 
"Innocents Abroad," though he spelled it bucksheesh. 
</P>
<P>
The most gross example of baksheesh I saw on the trip was in the temple of Isis 
(I believe it was Isis -- they run together) when one of the older gentlemen in 
our group was felled by heat prostration. He lay on the base of an ancient 
column, gasping for breath. Two locals came to his aid, raising his legs to 
send blood to his heart. After a minute they dropped his legs and asked for 
baksheesh. His only comment was "Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie." He was a 
tough old bird. He survived. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, Twain also took the tunnel into the inner chamber of the Cheops 
pyramid, as my wife had done, and he described it as being "not more than twice 
as wide and high as a Saratoga trunk." For days after that experience my wife 
complained that her legs hurt from walking in a crouch. A remarkable woman. 
</P>
<P>
From Luxor, EgyptAir picked us up and flew us back to Cairo. This time we 
stayed at the Semiramis Inter-Continental, a really sumptuous, world-class 
hotel. That first evening we had dinner at the nearby Nile Hilton, and once 
again serendipity played its hand. 
</P>
<P>
When we entered the hotel a band in dazzling white uniforms was blasting out a 
martial tune. Then it switched to Arabic music, sensuous and flutey. A crowd of 
extraordinarily handsome young people was gathered about. The room and 
staircase were garlanded with extravagant bouquets. Obviously, it was a 
wedding. 
</P>
<P>
We went up another floor to dinner. Suddenly people began leaving their plates 
and rushing out to a balcony that overlooked the staircase. The bride and 
bridegroom were descending. Our group agreed that she was the most beautiful 
woman they had ever seen. But the marvelous thing was that the band was playing 
the triumphal march from "Aida." It was certainly the most stirring moment of 
our trip, approached only by an experience my wife had later on the Sea of 
Galilee.

TREATING GALLSTONES

<P>
Question: What are gallstones? What are the symptoms that let you know that you 
have them? What can be done to get rid of them? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Gallstones are composed of cholesterol or calcium. The symptoms include 
pain in the upper abdomen after a meal, particularly one that includes fatty 
foods. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting and fever. 
</P>
<P>
Gallstones can be removed by surgery, dissolved with drugs, or treated by shock 
waves (lithotripsy). As many as 50% of all gallstones that are treated 
medically reappear within 10 years. Surgery is a permanent cure.

LIVELY CAJUN-ZYDECO SOUNDS DRAW ECLECTIC CROWD TO ANNUAL FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was no trouble spotting folks wearing T-shirts from such bastions of 
Louisiana music as Tipitina's in New Orleans or Mulate's in Breaux Bridge over 
the weekend at the fourth annual Cajun &amp; Zydeco Festival at Rainbow Lagoon 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
But then, anyone who's from -- or who's even visited -- southern Louisiana 
doesn't need a bit of convincing about the unique charms of its home-grown 
music. So while the presence of aficionados lent something of a stamp of 
authenticity to the proceedings, even more impressive was the sight of 
long-haired teen-agers in Iron Maiden T-shirts milling about the grounds next 
to bearded Urban Cowboys in pointy-toed boots -- next to scrub-faced 
adolescents in Depeche Mode shirts next to middle-aged black couples, all 
sharing the same cheek-to-cheek smiles. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it doesn't sell the most records or garner the most radio airplay, but 
Cajun and zydeco music undeniably rank among the happiest sounds ever wafted up 
from this quirky little planet. 
</P>
<P>
This year's festival -- promoted, like its predecessors, by Franklin Zawacki, a 
San Franciscan who operates out of his brother's house in Orange County -- was 
dominated by acts rooted to traditional Cajun and zydeco styles, more so than 
in the past when such crossover acts as Beausoleil and Wayne Toups brought 
their rock chops to the music. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionalism was most evident in the midday sets by Cajun singer and 
songwriter D.L. Menard, who endeared himself to the crowds of 2,000 on Saturday 
and 2,500 on Sunday with the contagious joy of his music-making. (The program 
was the same both days except for the openings T-Lou &amp; the Los Angeles 
Zydeco Band on Saturday, Wilfred Latour &amp; His Zydeco Goodtime Aces on 
Sunday.) 
</P>
<P>
Because Menard, like many Cajun and zydeco performers, sings the bulk of his 
material in Cajun French, some of the specifics of his old-timey tales of 
unrequited love may get lost without the translation. But the emotions always 
came through loud and clear from the yearning in Menard's voice, the soulful 
moanings of Ken Smith's fiddle and the dazzling fingerwork of accordionist 
Eddie LeJeune. (Los Lobos' accordion whiz David Hidalgo was spotted paying rapt 
attention to LeJeune's solos on Saturday.) 
</P>
<P>
And, on one of those occasions when he did sing in English, Menard showed why 
he's been dubbed the "Cajun Hank Williams," with a throat-catching rendition of 
Williams' signature "Your Cheatin' Heart." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Daigrepont's Cajun Band, which got penultimate billing, hewed close to 
the traditional core but not as strictly as Menard. Like Beausoleil, 
Daigrepont's band favors the rhythmic thrust that a tight bass-and-drum section 
can add to the basic Cajun instrumental triumvirate of fiddle, accordion and 
guitar. 
</P>
<P>
Accordionist Daigrepont also sweetened the stew with scintillating 
country-music harmonies and a witty rendition of Merle Haggard's "Okie from 
Muskogee" -- in French, naturellemente. 
</P>
<P>
Headliner John Delafose &amp; His Eunice Playboys closed each day's shows with 
performances that, in their own way, demonstrated what was missing from earlier 
sets by up-and-comer Nathan &amp; Zydeco Cha-Chas. Nathan's sets had a livelier 
look than Delafose's, thanks largely to the antics of his jellyfish-limbed 
rubboard player Mark Williams. The music also benefited from lots of 
fat-and-juicy licks from sax player Fred Charles. 
</P>
<P>
But leader Nathan Williams himself projected little sense of individuality, 
either in his vocals or in his piano-accordion work. Without that sense of 
personality, zydeco music easily can deteriorate into monotonous riffing. 
(Williams, however, is relatively young in the field, and he did display minor 
improvement over previous performances -- he actually smiled a few times. Maybe 
once he starts appearing to enjoy himself on stage, the audience might have 
more fun, too.) 
</P>
<P>
Delafose, on the other hand, had presence to spare. Alternating between three 
types of accordion -- the Cajun button type, a German button and piano 
accordions -- Delafose quipped: "It takes a special kind of fool to use three 
accordions." 
</P>
<P>
Though a generous bandleader -- he frequently gave the spotlight to other 
members of the band, including two of his sons -- Delafose clearly was in 
control. 
</P>
<P>
The festival's new location is far superior to its old one at Cal State 
Dominguez Hills in Carson -- more picturesque (it's next to a small man-made 
lake) and more comfortable because of constant breezes off the nearby ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Things ran like clockwork, yet there was no sense that things were being 
regimented by the stopwatch police. The only problem was the long lines at food 
booths set up by several local Cajun restaurants.

We Didn't Start the Rumors: Billy Joel is trying to squelch stories that his 
marriage to Christie Brinkley is in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
The reports started when Brinkley was seen with race car driver Danny Sullivan, 
and escalated with a tabloid story about Joel and another woman. "Our marriage 
is very solid," the singer told People magazine. "It always has been. I guess 
when celebrity news is slow, the press starts cooking up the old Billy-Christie 
split story. The most aggravating thing about it is that there is a child 
involved here (Alexa Ray, 4, their daughter) who is still young enough to be 
troubled by these rumors. I say enough is enough. Leave us alone." GREG BRAXTON

A Blow to the Stomach?: Heavyweight boxer Evander Holyfield is offering fellow 
pugilists James Buster Douglas and Mike Tyson easy money; easy, that is, if 
they can sit through a horror movie. "Blood Salvage," which Holyfield helped 
finance and in which he makes an appearance, tells the story of a south Georgia 
auto mechanic. The grease monkey also moonlights as a dealer in transplanted 
organs, which he extracts from, shall we say, unwilling donors. In newspaper 
ads for the movie, which opened Friday in Atlanta, Holyfield says: "This movie 
is so scary that I'm willing to donate $10,000 to the charity of their choice 
if Mike Tyson and Buster Douglas have the guts to sit through an entire 
screening on their own! Are you man enough?" GREG BRAXTON

TIME SPRINGS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 'MOUSETRAP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Next to "Twin Peaks," David Lynch's weird, funny and invigorating retooling of 
the murder mystery, Agatha Christie's "The Mousetrap" would look like a house 
cat standing alongside a drunken leopard with purple spots. 
</P>
<P>
OK, maybe that's a little strong. And it's probably not fair comparing a play 
that opened nearly four decades ago to a television series designed to kick off 
the '90s. That doesn't change the fact, though, that to a contemporary 
audience, "The Mousetrap" is likely to seem antique and predictable. 
</P>
<P>
What about venerability? Can't "The Mousetrap," now at Westminster Community 
Theatre, be enjoyed as a classic, an example of Christie's craftsmanship and 
period-perfect plotting and characters? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, by Christie die-hards at least. But others probably will find it rather 
quaint. Despite its popularity -- "The Mousetrap" remains the longest-running 
drama in London, the touristy stage equivalent of Big Ben -- the whodunit isn't 
even representative of Christie's best work. Stick with the novels for that. 
</P>
<P>
The plot is as musty as the Gothic mansion in which it is set: While a 
snowstorm gets nasty outside, a collage of peculiar people gathers at Monkswell 
Manor for the night. Eyebrows raise, and sidelong looks abound. The radio 
crackles with bad news about a deranged killer. He's among them, of course, and 
he wants revenge. Bodies are soon to fall. 
</P>
<P>
The play's best aspect is its eccentric characters, and director Jeanne Sanner 
employs them as best she can. Pumping up their as-written oddness to comic 
proportions, she has come up with a vaguely out-of-kilter, fairly amusing first 
act that almost overcomes the play's deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
But "The Mousetrap" has thuddingly dull patches where nothing much happens, and 
the time is filled by unrevealing talk and opaque red herrings. By the second 
act, this whodunit is barely moving along. Even the sometimes sophisticated wit 
of Christie's dialogue can't maintain the momentum. 
</P>
<P>
The cast tries gamely. Jim Hannah's swishy fop of an architect, Christopher 
Wren, is all fluttery mannerisms and shrieking syllables. Cliched, it 
nonetheless succeeds in eliciting laughs. A more interesting character is the 
cynical and shadowy Miss Casewell (Danielle Desmond). 
</P>
<P>
The Ralstons, the young, somewhat blank-brained owners of the mansion, are 
played with baffled good-humor by JoAnne K. Binkley and Michael O'Brien Jr. The 
ominous Sgt. Trotter is given a decent reading by Eric F. Chandler, though he 
does get a tad wiggy at the end. 
</P>
<P>

RICK DU BROW: CHANNELS THAT VIEWERS WATCH THE MOST -- AND THE LEAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW

<P>
TV or not TV . . . 
</P>
<P>
FACTS OF LIFE: In the new vast array of TV channels, what do viewers watch most 
-- and least? Well, the ratings folks have a little list. 
</P>
<P>
The old networks, of course, lead the way in prime time with 65% of TV homes in 
the season that started last September -- NBC, 24%; ABC, 21%, and CBS, 20%. 
</P>
<P>
But then. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Independent stations, cable, pay TV, superstations, the new Fox network and PBS 
now are drawing 44% of the households. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, we know, 65% plus 44% adds up to more than 100% of TV homes. How come? 
</P>
<P>
"Multiple-set households are factored in," says a network spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
PBS supporters should be most concerned because that most civilized of TV 
networks is on the low end of the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Which is why Bill Kobin, president of KCET Channel 28, has been warning that 
cable networks such as the Discovery channel and Arts &amp; Entertainment are 
wooing away PBS viewers with similar shows -- and that public TV desperately 
needs new, innovative programs to stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Los Angeles, KCET has to go increasingly local and reflect both the 
city and Southern California to separate itself from cable and develop a 
distinct image. Or else . . . well, let's not even think about it. 
</P>
<P>
SILVER LINING: What an irony that youth-crazy NBC's three most successful 8 
p.m. series -- the shows that presumably attract viewers for the night -- are 
held together by Robert Stack, 71 ("Unsolved Mysteries"), Andy Griffith, 63 
("Matlock"), and Bill Cosby, 52 ("The Cosby Show"). 
</P>
<P>
SHOWCASE: Glenda Jackson guest-stars Saturday on Carol Burnett's "Carol &amp; 
Company," playing a pop psychology radio host who doesn't give a hoot about her 
audience and who is more interested in plugging her new book. Burnett's 
successful new NBC comedy anthology recently offered a show with Robert 
Guillaume, L.A.'s new "Phantom of the Opera." 
</P>
<P>
FOX TROT: If imitation is the sincerest form of television, then CBS' "48 
Hours" should send a thank-you note to Fox's "Cops." Not long ago, "48 Hours" 
scheduled a piece about the public and private lives of Florida police -- the 
original basis of the "Cops" series. Now, this Thursday, "48 Hours" goes to 
Moscow to follow Soviet police as they go about their work. "Cops" has already 
been there and done the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
HURRICANE WILLARD: Weatherman Willard Scott of the troubled "Today" show 
addresses the Hollywood Radio and Television Society on June 6. Scott, as you 
recall, was an object of anchor Bryant Gumbel's criticism in a memo that leaked 
out last year. That was the start of an ongoing "Today" furor that now has seen 
the ratings nose-dive. I like silly old Willard because he plays straight to 
the heartland -- no excuses. 
</P>
<P>
OVERKILL: How many times is the American Movie Classics channel going to play 
"Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing" (William Holden, Jennifer Jones)? It's been 
absurd. And, oh yes, those long, repetitive coming attractions on AMC -- and 
those press-release-type mini-bios of Hollywood stars like John Wayne and Jimmy 
Stewart -- aren't going to help the channel's credibility. Just put the films 
on -- they speak for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
OUT OF THE BLUE: I wouldn't mind, though, if AMC ran "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" 
again. Never realized what a really wonderful film it is -- James Dunn as the 
alcoholic but loving father, Dorothy McGuire as the strong-willed but 
not-quite-understanding mother, Peggy Ann Garner simply spectacular as the 
child determined to better herself. Caught it right after the "Twin Peaks" 
finale. A night to remember. 
</P>
<P>
CHERRY PIE: Say, what about rerunning "Twin Peaks" starting in August and then 
climaxing things with a big two-hour season opener, directed by David Lynch, 
that solves Laura's murder and frees the series for new directions? 
</P>
<P>
COMEUPPANCE: Oh how smart we thought we were last week. "Anybody want to buy a 
network?" we asked. "Anybody want to buy the Brooklyn Bridge?" Well, we have 
been nailed. An ABC employee called to remind us that when Capital Cities 
bought the network in 1985, a new combined share of stock was worth about $220. 
Cap Cities closed Friday at nearly $600 a share. 
</P>
<P>
REMEMBRANCE: KSCI Channel 18, which specializes in programming for Asian 
Americans, marks China's student revolt of a year ago with a one-hour Monday 
documentary, "The Ceaseless Fire," which airs at 10:30 p.m. It'll be followed 
by the two-hour "Concert for Democracy in China," which features performing 
artists and was taped in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
ON TAP: Sharon Gless' planned new CBS series, "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill," 
stars the former "Cagney &amp; Lacey" headliner as a recently divorced public 
defender. Producer Barney Rosenzweig, who set up shop in a warehouse near 
downtown to shoot "Cagney &amp; Lacey," is doing the same for the new show in a 
building that's a short hop from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
BIRTHDAY: Cable News Network's 10th anniversary Friday will also be the 
publication date of the book "CNN: The Inside Story" by Hank Whittemore. CNN 
founder Ted Turner recalls that the network was such a shoestring operation 
when it started that "our L.A. bureau didn't get hooked up, I don't think, 
until about five minutes before we were on the air." 
</P>
<P>
ROOTS: There'll be a Steven Spielberg Exhibition Gallery in the new Museum of 
Broadcasting building in New York. Spielberg, who began in TV directing such 
shows as "Columbo," "Duel" and "Night Gallery," pledged $1 million to the 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
BEING THERE: "I like a wine that fights back," observed Jonathan Steed (Patrick 
Macnee) in "The Avengers."

CEREMONIES SALUTE SOLDIERS WHO MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE

Quiet emotion marked Memorial Day ceremonies in Ventura County on Monday, as 
hundreds of veterans and their families gathered to hear speeches and lay 
wreaths in honor of those who lost their lives in battle. 
</P>
<P>
In a solemn ceremony amid hundreds of American flags lining the paths of Ivy 
Lawn Cemetery in Ventura, Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) told a crowd 
of 300 that the sacrifices of America's war dead have paved the way for 
democracy in some Eastern bloc countries. 
</P>
<P>
"The countries that some of us never thought would be free are becoming free," 
Lagomarsino said. "Let's all pause to consider how much of the new democracy 
now sweeping the globe is directly attributable to the day-to-day sacrifices of 
these men and women at arms." 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of military men and women remain missing in action or may still be 
held as prisoners of war, and they too should be remembered, said Lagomarsino, 
who is chairman of the House POW-MIA Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
After Lagomarsino's speech, more than three dozen wreaths were presented by 
Ventura veterans groups, including the American Legion, the Retired Officers 
Assn. and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Many saluted stiffly after placing the 
bright bouquets before the podium. 
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony across the county, Rear Adm. George Strohsahl Jr., commander of 
the Pacific Missile Test Center at Point Mugu, addressed a crowd of about 250 
at Pierce Bros. Santa Paula Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
Erect in full white uniform, Strohsahl said although the phrases glasnost and 
perestroika seemed to signify a movement toward peace between the Soviet Union 
and the United States, "We can't count on phrases to keep the sea lanes open, 
or the skies free of enemy missiles and aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
Strohsahl saluted the ultimate sacrifice Americans made in past wars but 
cautioned: "Democracy works, but not without sacrifice or a standing, strong 
and ready military." 
</P>
<P>
While praising all Americans who have died in battle since the Revolutionary 
War, Strohsahl gave special attention to the Vietnam War, which he called "a 
bitter conflict." 
</P>
<P>
Strohsahl said although many Americans questioned the validity of the Vietnam 
War, "no cause is unjust when freedom is the price." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of each service, spectators stood at attention as a solitary bugle 
sounded taps. They then dispersed for a quiet moment at the gravesides of 
friends or relatives. 
</P>
<P>
At Ivy Lawn, Vietnam veteran Ernie Tumamait placed a bouquet next to the 
gravestone of his father, World War II medic Vernon L. Tumamait, who died in 
1955. He also placed a bouquet on the grave of a soldier buried next to his 
father, someone he never knew. 
</P>
<P>
"The ceremony was beautiful," Tumamait said. Next to him stood his wife, Anita, 
and his two young grandchildren, Johnny and Monique. The couple said they 
brought the children so they could see what Memorial Day is really about, and 
why they get the day off school. 
</P>
<P>
Said Tumamait: "I think every young person should understand the importance of 
this day."

EDUCATION: A STUDY SHOWS THAT 12TH-GRADERS IN SAN DIEGO AND THROUGHOUT THE 
STATE HAVE MADE MAJOR GAINS IN TEST SCORES AND IN COMPLETING ACADEMIC 
REQUIREMENTS.

<P>
San Diego County's 12th-graders and their counterparts in the rest of the state 
have shown strong gains during the past five years in preparing for college, 
new data from the state Department of Education shows. 
</P>
<P>
Information released today shows major gains from 1984 to 1989 at both state 
and county levels in the number of seniors whose Scholastic Aptitude test 
scores have increased, in the number of students successfully completing high 
school courses needed to apply for University of California admission, and in 
the number of students passing advanced placement high school courses for 
college-level credit. 
</P>
<P>
"California is making steady and significant gains in getting more students 
groomed for college," state schools Supt. Bill Honig said in releasing the 
information on college-bound students. 
</P>
<P>
Among the gains Honig cited: 
</P>
<P>
* Statewide, 18.7% of all 1989 seniors scored above 450 on the verbal portion 
of the SAT, compared with 15.5% in 1984, a 21% increase. In San Diego County, 
17.2% of the 1989 class scored above 450, compared with 14.3% in 1984, a 20% 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
On the math portion, 20.5% of all state seniors scored above 500, compared with 
16.5% in 1984, a 24% increase. Countywide, 18.5% of seniors were above 500, 
compared with 14.9% in 1984, a 24% increase. 
</P>
<P>
The SAT is scored on a scale of 200 to 800, with 450 verbal and 500 math 
considered minimum scores in general for application to colleges. 
</P>
<P>
* Statewide, 30.6% of California students completed the so-called "a-through-f" 
course requirements, the minimum needed to apply to UC campuses, compared with 
25.4% in 1985, a 20% increase. In San Diego County, 33.3% completed the a-f 
sequence, compared with 25.6% in 1985, a 30% increase. 
</P>
<P>
The requirements include four years of English, three years of math, two years 
of foreign language, a year of U.S. history and a year of a laboratory science, 
as well as elective courses in art. 
</P>

* Statewide, 20.3% of the 1989 seniors successfully passed advanced placement 
courses, more than double the 9.5% in 1984. In San Diego County, 15.7% of the 
seniors in 1989 passed advanced placement classes, a 91% boost over the 8.2% in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
Advanced placement exams are given in 24 academic areas, including biology, 
physics, calculus, music, and computer science, as well as in a variety of 
foreign languages. End-of-course tests are graded on a 1-to-5 scale, with a 
score of three or better considered passing so that a student can earn college 
credit for the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 11 high school districts in San Diego County, gains were recorded in 
all but Vista, according to the state information. In the four largest 
districts -- San Diego Unified, Sweetwater, Grossmont and Escondido -- the only 
decline was a slight drop in the number of students in Sweetwater successfully 
completing the a-f course sequence. 
</P>
<P>
"What this means is that over the past five years there has been a substantial 
growth in the pool of young people better prepared to go to college and into 
the work force," Honig said. He cited a variety of academic programs throughout 
the state designed to prepare students for college, including the AVID program 
begun in San Diego County which targets promising nonwhite students and offers 
them help with study skills and extra tutoring to qualify them for UC 
admission. 
</P>
<P>
Honig released statewide ethnic data -- no local figures were available -- 
showing that the number of Asian Americans completing the a-f requirements is 
more than 52%, followed by Filipinos at 39%, whites at 32%, blacks at 25% and 
Latinos at 19.5%, all substantial gains from 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Similar gains were shown in the numbers completing advanced placement courses 
successfully, although Honig said that they remain low, especially for blacks, 
at 4%, and for Latinos, at 10%. Among white seniors in 1989, 18% showed success 
in advanced placement tests and 42% of Asians received college credit.

<P>
Simi Valley City Council members Vicky Howard and Bill Davis -- the apparent 
front-runners in the race for the 4th District county supervisor seat -- have 
more than that in common. 
</P>
<P>
They both are former members of neighborhood councils. They both served on the 
city planning commission. They are next-door neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it was Howard, a former real estate broker, who sold Davis his house 
when he moved to Simi Valley from Los Angeles 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
It was also Howard who got Davis interested in politics. 
</P>
<P>
As Davis tells it, the two were out working on their lawns one day when they 
began conversing about their jobs. During their talk, Davis learned that Howard 
served on the Planning Commission and before that had been a member of a 
neighborhood council. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long before Davis, an electronics salesman, decided to join a similar 
neighborhood group. That was in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, Vicky Howard, serving as a member of the Simi Valley City 
Council, recommended Davis for a position on the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Davis was appointed to the City Council, again with the help of 
Howard. He was elected to the post in 1988, the same year he decided to sell 
his electronics business to devote more time to his job as a council member. 
</P>
<P>
During their time on the City Council, Davis and Howard have proved to be 
strong leaders. Some constituents say it will be hard to choose one over the 
other in the June 5 election. 
</P>
<P>
"I like them both," said Susan Dornblaser, a citizens group member. "They are 
very effective council members. I'd hate to lose either one of them on the City 
Council." 
</P>
<P>
Residents are not the only ones who are finding the choice difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, 62, has been endorsed by the Ventura County Firefighters Assn. and the 
Ventura County Public Employees Assn. Howard, 55, is backed by Ventura County 
Sheriff John Gillespie, Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury and the Deputy Sheriffs 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Three other candidates -- Glen Schmidt, Harold Fick, and Tom Ely -- are running 
to represent the 4th District, which stretches from Somis to Simi Valley and 
includes Moorpark. They have raised far less campaign money than Howard or 
Davis, and are given little chance of winning. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbent, Supervisor James R. Dougherty, is not seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Although Davis readily acknowledged in an interview that it was Howard who got 
him interested in politics, he dismissed any notion that he is her protege. 
</P>
<P>
"A protege?" Davis said, sounding surprised. "No, I'm my own person. I think 
people have found that out." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Greg Stratton, who has endorsed Howard, agreed that there are 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he tends to be a little bit easy with spending," Stratton said. "I 
think that's the major philosophical difference. Bill tends to go more on 
feeling . . . whereas Vicky is more analytical. She wants facts and figures in 
front of her" before she makes a decision. 
</P>
<P>
Stratton, who said he is backing Howard because he believes that she is better 
able to deal with the county's budget problems, offered this illustration: 
</P>
<P>
Davis recently supported a plan to lend the Simi Valley Public Cemetery 
District $350,000 to upgrade its deteriorated burial grounds. Stratton and 
Howard opposed the loan because district officials failed to come up with a 
plan to repay the city or to provide collateral. 
</P>

Davis, who along with Councilwoman Ann Rock worked closely with the Cemetery 
Board to come up with a way to finance the improvements, said the cemetery is a 
valuable public resource that should be maintained. 
</P>
<P>
He did not seem bothered by the possibility that the district might not be able 
to pay back the loan. "If they can't," he said at the time, "I don't think it's 
going to destroy the world." 
</P>
<P>
Davis laughed when told about Stratton's fiscal concerns. He pointed out that 
two weeks after the cemetery vote, both the mayor and Howard joined the other 
three council members in approving a plan to subsidize a new $1.5-million Boys 
and Girls Club facility. 
</P>
<P>
'What's the difference?" said Davis, who told the council he would have 
supported the club if it had cost the city another million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Candidate Howard, however, said there was a difference in supporting the youth 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an investment for our children's future, which is a lot different than 
planting grass at a cemetery," she said. Howard said another difference is that 
the Boys and Girls Club has agreed to come up with a plan to pay rent to the 
city, beginning in five years. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has been instrumental in getting the city to subsidize rent for a small 
group of seniors. He also pushed hard to get a measure on the June ballot that 
would amend the city's slow-growth ordinance to give priority to developers who 
build affordable housing for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
"He puts his nose to the grindstone and helps people," said Councilman Glen 
McAdoo, who is backing Davis. "I like his bulldog approach to problem-solving. 
He makes things happen." 
</P>
<P>
"I put people in front of government," Davis said. "If a program we're looking 
at is going to serve all of our constituents, and it's a good investment, you 
bet I'm going to support it." 
</P>
<P>
Howard, however, said keeping tabs on how tax dollars are spent means making 
difficult decisions on issues like the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
"The budget is the key to the whole thing," Howard said. "If there's no money, 
you can't do the job." 
</P>
<P>
Howard and her supporters say that she has more experience at the county level. 
The councilwoman is a member of the Local Agency Formation Commission, the 
state-established agency that oversees annexations and incorporation in the 
county. She is also the city representative on the Ventura County 
Transportation Commission and the Southern California Water Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who serves as the city's representative for the county's Animal 
Regulation Department and is a member of a county highway safety committee, 
said he does not have more county experience because he has concentrated his 
efforts on local issues and concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"I was elected to represent the constituents of this city," Davis said. "If I'm 
elected supervisor, then I'll serve at the county level." 
</P>
<P>
Development is another key issue in the campaign. The winner of the 4th 
District seat could play a significant role in determining whether two massive 
housing and commercial projects proposed for the Jordan and Ahmanson ranches in 
eastern Ventura County are approved. 
</P>
<P>
Together the developments would bring about 11,000 new residents and 240 acres 
of commercial, office and retail space to the hillsides several miles east of 
Thousand Oaks at the Los Angeles County line. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Davis nor Howard has taken a position on the two projects. Both said 
they could not decide until they see environmental reports on each proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Both, however, have been criticized for taking contributions from developers to 
fund their campaigns. Nearly half of the $34,300 Howard has collected in 
campaign contributions was from developers, construction companies and real 
estate agents. About $14,000 of the $39,019 that Davis has taken in was 
received from the same type of sources. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates maintain that the contributions mean little except that they 
have a broad range of support. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Davis and Howard said they have no ill feelings toward each other 
and that if the other is elected it will not hamper their friendship. 
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't bother me at all," Davis said, if his opponent were to win. "It 
would just mean I have a direct pipeline to a supervisor." 
</P>
<P>
Here is a look at the other candidates: 
</P>
<P>
* Glen Schmidt, 60, is a Moorpark planning commissioner who served as county 
supervisor of the 4th District between 1971 and 1975. Schmidt, who has spent 
nearly $4,000 of his own money to finance his campaign, has frequently attacked 
Davis and Howard for accepting developers' contributions. "We could end up with 
a runoff between two development people," said Schmidt, who opposes the Jordan 
and Ahmanson projects. "Wouldn't the developers love that?" 
</P>
<P>
* Harold Fick, 52, is a senior engineer for General Motors. He has never run 
for public office. "We know what all the other candidates have done. They've 
already been elected to office," Fick said. "We need new input. We need a 
business approach to some of our problems. I've been in private enterprise all 
my life, 32 years at GM. Now I'd like to do something for the community." 
</P>
<P>
* Tom Ely, 54, is a trustee of the Ventura County Community College District. 
Ely's campaign has been overshadowed by publicity about his gambling debts and 
by a district attorney's investigation into possible misappropriation of 
district funds. Ely has denied any wrongdoing, and says his 11 years' 
experience as a county official best qualifies him for the job of supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the only one of the candidates who has been elected three times by the 
people of the 4th District," Ely said.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: JAIL ROOMS CHANGED TO PROTECT PRIVACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Sheriff's Department is modifying interview rooms at the 
County Jail to make sure that deputies cannot overhear conversations between 
prisoners and their lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department decided to make the changes after a deputy 
accidentally overheard a conversation last month between a murder suspect and 
his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Bruce McDowell, a jail administrator, said his staff is studying 
alternatives to intercoms, such as windows or video cameras, that would let 
guards monitor visitors for security reasons without violating the state law 
guaranteeing lawyer-client confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
The staff will present the results of their study to Superior Court Judge 
Lawrence Storch in mid-September, McDowell said. 
</P>
<P>
The study began after a deputy in the jail's control center switched on an 
intercom monitor and overheard 10 seconds of conversation between murder 
suspect Gregory Scott Smith and his lawyers in late April. Smith, 21, is being 
held in the March 23 murder of Paul Bailly, 8, of Northridge, whose gagged, 
burned body was found in a brush fire near Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Deputy Augustine Quintero testified that he inadvertently 
monitored a conversation between Smith and one of his two public defenders. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department is conducting an internal investigation of the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Sheriff's Department and the district attorney's office say 
they do not know what Quintero overheard and do not want to know because it 
could jeopardize the case. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sheriff's Department has installed protective caps over intercom 
switches in the jail control room. The caps must be pried off the control panel 
before the intercoms can be switched on, McDowell said. MACK REED

RAIN ARRIVES, BUT DROUGHT STAYS BEHIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A surprise storm dumped up to one inch of rain in some areas of Ventura County 
late Sunday and early Monday, but local water officials said it came too late 
to have much impact on the drought. 
</P>
<P>
Gauges at the Fillmore and Ojai stations of the Ventura County Fire Department 
measured one inch of precipitation, dispatcher Cece Grives said. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks received 0.74 of an inch and Simi Valley 0.58 of an inch. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll take anything we can get," said Frederick Gientke, general manager for 
the United Water Conservation District, which serves the area between Ventura 
and Point Mugu, including the Oxnard Plains and the Santa Clara River to Lake 
Piru. 
</P>
<P>
The storm was "unusually late" in the season, Gientke said. It will do little 
to alleviate the drought because warm weather and wind will evaporate most of 
the water, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the rain is a relatively small amount, water demand will probably be 
cut back about 20% for a week, said James Hubert, a manager for the Calleguas 
Municipal Water District, which serves Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley, Moorpark, 
Camarillo and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
The storm, which originated in the southern Gulf of Alaska Friday, strengthened 
and then moved south toward California, said Steve Burback, meteorologist for 
WeatherData Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The forecast for today is for sunny skies with few clouds and a light wind, 
Burback said. Highs will reach the upper 60s to mid-70s and the lows tonight 
will be in the mid-50s. Some low clouds could form along the coast tonight.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SEASONAL WATER EXCHANGE PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Casitas Municipal Water District is expressing interest in a water exchange 
plan with an Ojai water company, pending a careful look at environmental and 
water rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
"In this water emergency we're going to have to all work together," Laurence 
Whelan, board vice president, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I appreciate Southern California Water coming to us with this offer." 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Water Co. has proposed to pump excess water in the 
winter from its four wells around the city to be stored either in the lake or 
elsewhere in the Casitas system, which supplies thousands of customers in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, Southern California Water would receive more lake water in the 
summer, when its pumps have difficulty keeping up with the increased demand in 
Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
The private utility buys about 25% of its water from Casitas in the summer, 
said Donald Twomley, company vice president of water resources. 
</P>
<P>
The company has offered to pay all costs for the pumps and pipelines to move 
water into the Casitas system from its San Antonio Creek station six miles east 
of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
But Casitas' directors are worried about the quality of the ground water they 
would receive in the exchange. They also fear that pumping more water from the 
aquifer might lower supplies for citrus ranchers and other well users. 
</P>
<P>
Casitas Board President James W. Coultas, a citrus rancher in eastern Ojai, 
questioned impacts on the valley's aquifer, and whether it is fair to let one 
water company trade its water, but not other well users. THIA BELL

FOR MANY BUSINESSES, NORTH COUNTY IS NOW THE PLACE TO BE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM STACEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
North County is hardly the Klondike, but a gold rush of sorts is on 
nonetheless. Leading the stampede are San Diego-based businesses eager to stake 
a claim in a burgeoning market for goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
Among the enterprises that have recently opened or expanded their North County 
operations are San Diego's largest law firm, a major hospital and a trendy 
Mexican restaurant chain. While they serve different markets, all say the 
prospects are good in the fast-growing communities of North County. 
</P>
<P>
Gray Cary Ames &amp; Frye, the largest law firm in San Diego, opened an office 
in the Escondido National Bank Building on April 2. The same building has 
housed the North County branch of San Diego's third-largest law firm, Higgs 
Fletcher &amp; Mack, since 1972. The two firms had similar reasons for opening 
their North County offices, which are just down the hall from each other. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time we've seen the desirability of North County," said Karl 
Zobell, of Gray Cary Ames &amp; Frye. "Some of our clients are up there, and 
we've spent a lot of time on the freeway going to North County." 
</P>
<P>
Staffed by five attorneys, the new office also gives the firm greater proximity 
to new clients, and to a growing courthouse which will be located in either 
Vista or Escondido, said Zobell. The new office also allows several of the 
firm's lawyers who already live in North County to now work in the community 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Higgs Fletcher &amp; Mack started its North County branch with two attorneys, 
now has seven, and will probably add three more soon, said J. Tim Konold, an 
attorney with the firm. Now well-positioned to meet the growing demand for 
legal services in North County, Higgs Fletcher &amp; Mack has tried from the 
beginning to avoid the appearance of carpet-bagging, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We really went up there first just to serve our existing clients better, 
rather than charge them for driving up there and back," said Konold. "We have 
learned that there are a lot of potential clients up there." 
</P>
<P>
There are even more potential patients. La Jolla-based Scripps Memorial 
Hospitals opened its Encinitas facility in 1978, and nearly doubled the number 
of beds there with a $17 million expansion completed in January, said Michael 
Dabney of Scripps Memorial. The expansion makes Scripps Memorial-Encinitas the 
first major rehabilitation facility in coastal North County, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Scripps Memorial are also planning to build a new hospital on 32 
acres of land near San Marcos Boulevard, he said. Scripps Memorial has entered 
escrow on the property, and is now in negotiations with the city of San Marcos. 
In the planning stages for at least three years, the hospital was originally 
going to be built in Carlsbad. Numerous delays by the city of Carlsbad led 
Scripps Memorial to abandon that site, said Dabney. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps Memorial Hospitals is also building a 57,000-square-foot, three-story 
office complex in North City West. The $11.3 million building, now more than 
half finished, will provide office space for 60 Scripps Memorial physicians 
when it is completed, said Dabney. 
</P>
<P>
Demographic studies preceded the expansion in Encinitas, the construction of 
the office building, and the decision to build a new hospital in San Marcos. 
The figures pointed to an inevitable increase in the demand for medical 
services. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't just jump into things capriciously," said Dabney. "The population up 
there is just going to grow very significantly in the next decade." 
</P>
<P>
Fish taco magnate Ralph Rubio also did his homework before testing the North 
County market. He knew that his two Rubio's Restaurants in Pacific Beach 
enjoyed a loyal following among surfers and other beach-goers who appreciated 
his authentic Mexican street-cart recipe for fish tacos. He also saw the 
tremendous residential growth occurring in inland North County. He wondered, 
would the fish taco play in San Marcos? 
</P>
<P>
Betting on a steady flow of traffic to and from the nearby Price Club, Rubio's 
opened a 1,400-square-foot restaurant in the food court at the Vallecitos 
Shopping Center in San Marcos. That was in the summer of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of an experience," said Rubio. "Things did not go well at the 
start." 
</P>
<P>
The shopping center was just too new, said Rubio. Business has picked up 
dramatically, however. Well enough, at least, for him to open another Rubio's 
Restaurant in Encinitas in 1989. The 3,200-square-foot Encinitas restaurant, 
formerly an Arby's, was a success from the start, said Rubio. His North County 
ventures have taught him that opening a restaurant in a new location sometimes 
requires a survivor's attitude: "You have to bite the bullet." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the instant acceptance of the Encinitas Rubio's has proven a 
pet theory about business at the beach. Rubio thinks that people along the 
coastal strip from Point Loma to Oceanside have similar buying habits -- at 
least when it comes to fish tacos. Moreover, surfers and other people who buy 
fish tacos in Pacific Beach are likely to do so in Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
"Beach traffic tends to cross," he said. "We always felt that we had a built-in 
customer base in coastal North County, and that has proved itself true." 
</P>
<P>
Rubio now sees the potential for three or four more Rubio's Restaurants in 
North County. 
</P>
<P>
"Carlsbad or Oceanside is a definite possibility in the next year or two, and 
we want to do something in Del Mar," he said. North City West, where retail 
growth has yet to catch up with the new residential base, could be a good 
location. Yet another potential site is on Carmel Mountain Road, where Ralph's 
Grocery Co. and McDonalds have both opened stores. 
</P>
<P>
At least one San Diego business has decided to move its entire operation to 
North County, lock, stock and barrel. The Fornaca Family Bakery last month 
announced plans to move from its National Avenue plant to a new location near 
Interstate 15 and Highway 78 in Escondido. Plans call for a 100,000-square-foot 
facility on 6.8 acres of land.

BELEAGUERED S&amp;L HAS THE CHANCE TO BAIL ITSELF OUT;

Just a few months ago, Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan looked like it would 
soon become just another troubled thrift on the federal dole. 
</P>
<P>
The badly undercapitalized S&amp;L was hit in January with a tough federal 
crackdown that barred it from accepting deposits larger than $100,000 and from 
making any loans. The restrictions put the Van Nuys-based S&amp;L in a limbo 
that was widely viewed as a mere stop-off before the government took it over. 
</P>
<P>
Under the restrictions, Valley Federal couldn't write home mortgages, a 
business it had curtailed anyway. It couldn't even offer its checking-account 
customers overdraft protection because the service is really just a short-term 
loan. These were bad signs: Not long after the government sent similar 
"lock-down letters" to Santa Barbara Savings, Imperial Savings and Mercury 
Savings, all were seized. 
</P>
<P>
But today it seems that Valley Federal may be different -- one of the few 
down-and-out thrifts with the chance to fight its own way out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
The change has come quickly. After losing $138 million last year, Valley 
Federal announced in April that its core operations earned $5.7 million in the 
first quarter of 1990. In fairly short order, the U.S. Office of Thrift 
Supervision approved Valley Federal's plan to boost its capital reserves in 
time to meet a June 30, 1991, deadline. And last week the agency even lifted 
the onerous operating restrictions that it imposed in January. 
</P>
<P>
Amid all these changes, Valley Federal also appointed a new chief executive, 
Scott A. Braly, when Dan E. Nelms resigned after holding the post for two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift supervision office -- which is habitually tight-lipped about its 
plans -- has essentially given Valley Federal a chance to prove it can remain 
profitable for a year. To meet federal capital standards by June 30, 1991, 
however, Valley Federal will still have to be taken over by a buyer than can 
give it millions in additional capital. 
</P>
<P>
The road to such a merger -- or any other happy ending for Valley Federal -- 
won't be smooth. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if a thrift's capital plan is approved, they're still in intensive care," 
said Bert Ely, a Virginia-based industry analyst. 
</P>
<P>
On June 30, 1991, the thrift, which has about $2.9 billion in assets, will 
still require $135 million in additional capital to meet the government's most 
stringent requirements, even if it uses earnings to reduce the capital gap 
according to its plan. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Federal also will have to rid itself of problems with its loss-plagued 
mobile home lending business. And the thrift could still face a problem in 
finding a buyer. The market for thrifts is now glutted with the most desirable 
parts of S&amp;Ls taken over and offered for sale by the Resolution Trust 
Corp., the federal agency in charge of disposing failed thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Valley Federal, right now the OTS is busy with thrifts in more 
immediate danger. "They've got their hands full of institutions that are taking 
big losses," said Michael Abrahams, an analyst with the securities firm Bateman 
Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike those institutions, Valley Federal is making money in its core business 
-- on the margin between what it pays on deposits and what it earns on loans. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Federal must keep that up. Braly declined to say what Valley Federal's 
target earnings are for the coming year according to its government-approved 
plan. If Valley Federal misses those targets, he said, the OTS could slap the 
S&amp;L with even tighter restrictions than it imposed in January. 
</P>
<P>
The plan still calls for Valley Federal to shrink its assets in order to bring 
down its capital requirements. But with its restrictions lifted, now the thrift 
can resume some "moderate" lending. That means Valley Federal can offer 
services like overdraft protection that could be important to retaining deposit 
customers and preserving the value of the S&amp;L's branch network. Valley 
Federal could also offer write a small number of mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
And even though its plan calls for Valley Federal to pay back most of its 
uninsured deposits -- those over $100,000 -- on maturity, the S&amp;L may now 
roll over a few, as necessary, to avoid a liquidity crunch. 
</P>
<P>
Although Valley Federal is for sale now, it's unlikely to find a buyer soon -- 
at least one willing to pay its stockholders a premium for their shares. "It's 
very much of a buyer's market," Ely said. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, any acquirer today would have to come up with about $78 million 
in additional capital on top of any acquisition price, just to meet the least 
stringent interim federal requirement for capital reserves. (The interim 
requirement is less strict than the final one Valley Federal must meet by July, 
1991.) But if Valley Federal keeps making money and shrinking its assets 
according to plan, that capital gap should shrink. 
</P>
<P>
Another barrier to a sale now is that buyers have plenty of assets to choose 
from. The RTC plans to sell off 141 thrifts by the end of June. The agency 
recently said it's trying to hurry up the sale of the thrifts now in 
receivership by cutting them up and marketing the desirable and risk-free parts 
-- mostly deposits -- and keeping the risky parts to sell later. 
</P>
<P>
It's impossible to say whether that situation will be any better a year from 
now. 
</P>
<P>
While it's trying to prove that it can remain profitable over the next year, 
Valley Federal will also have to definitively end the nagging problem that got 
it into trouble in the first place: its loss-plagued mobile-home loan business, 
called AVAC. 
</P>
<P>
From 1983 through 1988, AVAC made about $1 billion in mobile-home loans, 
keeping some of them as assets. The rest it sold to investors, keeping a part 
of the income stream to itself and agreeing to absorb a small part of any 
losses on the loans. 
</P>
<P>
But the loans suffered worse-than-expected defaults and repossessions, so 
Valley Federal last year began getting out of the business by writing down the 
value of its mobile-home loan assets by $119 million -- the main reason Valley 
Federal suffers from such a large capital deficit. 
</P>
<P>
And earlier this year, Valley Federal agreed to pay a Minnesota-based 
mobile-home lender, Green Tree Acceptance Inc., to service both the mobile-home 
loans Valley Federal still owns and those it sold to investors. 
</P>
<P>
But to get rid of its AVAC problem once and for all, Valley Federal must 
drastically reduce its liability for any future losses from defaults and 
repossessions under the loans. That's a complicated task. 
</P>
<P>
First, Valley Federal is working to convince investors who bought pools of the 
loans totaling about $300 million to stop holding the thrift liable for any 
potential losses. In exchange, it would offer the investors the right to take 
more of the loans' income. 
</P>
<P>
Investors who don't like that option could essentially resume full 
responsibility for the loans and have another company service them. 
</P>
<P>
Braly said Valley Federal has already reached or is about to reach such 
agreements covering a little more than half of the loans it sold to investors. 
</P>
<P>
That still leaves a portfolio of loans that Valley Federal owns outright and 
plans to sell, without any recourse, to investors. To do that, the thrift is in 
the process of taking those loans, pooling them and preparing to sell them in 
pieces as securities, much like bonds that are backed by conventional 
mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Valley Federal pulls off such a deal and reduces its mobile-home loan 
problem to a manageable size -- even if it remains profitable for a year -- 
there's still no guarantee it will find a buyer next year. And without a buyer, 
it won't meet the capital standards on June 30, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, Braly is hoping that the OTS will give Valley Federal even more 
time to prove itself.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: HOUSE OF FABRICS PROFIT RISES 60% IN 1ST QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
House of Fabrics said its fiscal first-quarter profit jumped 60% from a year 
earlier on a 9% increase in sales. 
</P>
<P>
The Sherman Oaks-based company, which operates 619 fabrics and sewing stores, 
said net income in the quarter that ended April 30 rose to $2.15 million from 
$1.34 million, while its sales climbed to $86.4 million from $79.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
House of Fabrics attributed the gains to an ongoing conversion of its stores 
from smaller, shopping-mall units to larger "superstores" that maintain higher 
profit margins and to increased demand for home-sewing products.

MEXICAN CARRIER TO BUY AS MANY AS 50 AIRBUS JETS; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: THE EUROPEAN AIRPLANE MAKER SAYS MEXICANA AIRLINES, A LONGTIME BOEING 
CUSTOMER, DEFECTED BECAUSE AIRBUS CAN DELIVER A NEW MODEL A YEAR EARLIER.

Mexicana Airlines, a longtime customer of Boeing Co., announced Monday that it 
has agreed to purchase as many as 50 jetliners from European competitor Airbus 
Industrie. The deal, including options, could be worth as much as $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Airbus and Mexicana also announced plans to create a joint venture in Mexico to 
provide training and maintenance for airlines with Latin American routes. 
</P>
<P>
"This contract was of utmost importance to us because Mexicana is the major 
airline in Latin America, based on number of passengers," said Stuart E. 
Iddles, senior vice president of Airbus. "This could influence other Latin 
American companies that plan to buy airplanes and have not yet made a 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
Airbus, a consortium of French, British, West German and Spanish state-owned 
companies, ranks second only to Seattle-based Boeing in sales of commercial 
aircraft. Along with deliveries to European airlines, the company has sold 100 
planes to Northwest Airlines and 38 to Air Canada. But previously it had failed 
to receive any significant orders from Latin American airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's deal fits in with Mexicana's announced strategy to develop an airline 
maintenance subsidiary serving other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement also came at a propitious time for Mexican President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari, who has been criticized by other Latin American officials 
for seeking a free trade agreement with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"This proves that a closer relationship with one country does not mean 
distancing ourselves from other nations, particularly those of Latin America," 
said Salinas, who attended Monday's signing of the $1.1-billion contract for 
the first 30 airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
Airbus received the order in part because it can deliver the first 16 of the 
150-passenger A320s next year, said Mexicana Chairman Carlos Abedrop. Boeing 
could not have begun delivery of the comparable 757 model until 1992, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing officials could not be reached for comment. However, Chairman Frank 
Shronz has said that achieving higher production rates on three jet programs, 
including the 757, is a key challenge for the company. Boeing has been swamped 
with orders in recent years, and at the end of 1989 it carried a backlog of 
$77.5 billion in commercial aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Mexicana is committed to buying 16 planes with options on another 14. The 
company also negotiated options to buy 20 more for $733 million if Airbus is 
able to meet Mexicana's delivery schedule. Spare parts will increase the total 
by about 15%, said Iddles. 
</P>
<P>
Airbus has contacted the export-import banks of its member European countries 
about providing favorable financing terms, Iddles said. 
</P>
<P>
Exact terms of the proposed maintenance and training joint venture are still 
being discussed, according to Iddles and Abedrop. In the plan under discussion, 
Airbus would provide the training and equipment, and Mexicana would provide the 
manpower and location, possibly an under-used service center that it owns in 
Guadalajara, in central western Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Abedrop left open the possibility that Mexicana will turn to Boeing again in 
the next three months when the company awards the contract for long-distance 
planes to supplement its six McDonnell Douglas DC-10s. However, he added, 
Airbus also is negotiating hard for that contract. 
</P>
<P>
Mexicana, which the government sold to private investors eight months ago, is 
in the process of modernizing and expanding its 48-jet fleet, which includes 37 
Boeing 727s. The company plans to buy 82 airplanes over the next 10 years.

Japan's Major Banks Post Lower Profits: Japan's largest banks reported weaker 
profits for the year ended March 31, and bank officials are predicting only a 
modest recovery for the current year, which will end next March. The banks, 
Sumitomo, Dai-Ichi Kangyo, Fuji, Sanwa, Bank of Tokyo and Mitsubishi Bank, said 
profits fell due to the strength of the yen. The banks were also hurt by losses 
from bad loans to Mexico and increases in loan-loss reserves to cover possible 
defaults by debtor nations.

Gabon Fears for Economy: OPEC member Gabon said its whole economy was in danger 
after anti-government riots led foreign oil companies to evacuate their staff. 
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Jean-Remy Pendy-Bouyiki said Gabon was losing $50 million 
a day in export revenue. "If oil production is interrupted for more than 10 
days, the whole economy will be on its knees," he said. He gave no details on 
how oil exports were affected. The government said oil companies, including 
France's Elf-Aquitaine and Royal Dutch Shell, have cut production to a trickle 
and evacuated most staff from the former French colony.

A LOT IS RIDING ON TRADE TALKS BY 104 NATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
URUGUAY ROUND: MANY FEAR CHAOS ON A GLOBAL SCALE IF ATTEMPTS AT LIBERALIZATION 
FAIL. AND SUCCESS IS FAR FROM CERTAIN.

<P>
The world's trade negotiators are heading into the home stretch of the Uruguay 
Round: a four-year, 104-nation marathon that has become the most ambitious and 
the riskiest effort in history to liberalize world trade. 
</P>
<P>
If the effort succeeds, it could open vast new markets to foreign goods, 
substantially alter world trading patterns and, for the first time, set broad 
rules for trade in agriculture, services and intellectual property. 
</P>
<P>
But if it fails, trade officials warn, it would revive protectionist pressures 
worldwide, exacerbate tensions between rich and poor nations and push countries 
into narrow trading blocs that would almost surely hurt global trade. 
</P>
<P>
"The signal we would send to the outside world would be that the multilateral 
trading system that has existed since World War II has nothing to offer any 
more," said Renato Ruggiero, Italy's trade minister. "It would be a very bad 
political signal to send." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills, who is not usually given to 
hyperbole, calls the Uruguay Round talks "the most important trade negotiations 
ever held." 
</P>
<P>
Although the trade talks are being held in Geneva, they are called the Uruguay 
Round because the negotiations were launched in Punta del Este in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Success remains far from certain. Although the negotiators have drafted texts 
for several portions of the complex 15-item agenda, they have hit serious 
impasses on some key issues. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the White House has begun a major international drive to 
jump-start the talks. Significantly, it has softened the tone of America's 
trade rhetoric, lest Japan and other trading partners take offense. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials are expected to seek ministerial-level backing for speeding up 
the talks at this week's annual meeting of the 24-country Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development, the Paris-based economic forum for 
industrialized countries. 
</P>
<P>
And President Bush plans to make reinvigorating the talks a major plank at this 
year's annual seven-nation economic summit, to be held in Houston in mid-July. 
Bush last Wednesday declared the talks to be "my top trade priority for this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
The Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the 97-country trade 
compact under whose aegis the talks are being held, is also stepping up the 
pressure on the delegates to get the negotiations off the dime. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the organization, has asked negotiators to 
complete provisional agreements on key sectors this summer, in time to begin 
final horse-trading over specifics before a formal wrap-up session in Brussels 
in December. "We have to have made the basic deals by late July," he said last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
That will not be easy. The United States and Europe still are far apart on the 
key questions of how fast to cut agricultural subsidies. U.S. officials have 
long complained that government subsidies give European farmers an unfair 
competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and its trading partners are also at odds over how far to 
relax restrictions on textile imports. If the United States does not agree to 
lower its barriers to foreign-made textiles, developing countries might 
retaliate by opposing rules governing trade in services and intellectual 
property. U.S. negotiators are seeking such rules -- none exist now -- in hope 
that they will help U.S. companies gain new markets abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Bush Administration can get the kind of deal it wants, it faces a 
skeptical Congress that seems ready to reject any accord that does not contain 
a "credible package" of trade concessions by other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Senate Finance Committee served notice earlier this month that 
they would block any accord that did not include new rules affecting 
agriculture, services and intellectual property. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers are already drafting a farm bill and textile-quota legislation that 
would toughen U.S. trade restrictions in both areas. Although the threat serves 
as a cudgel to advance U.S. interests in the international trade talks, it also 
damages America's effort to appear as a champion of free trade. 
</P>
<P>
"It's giving arguments to protectionists around the world who say, 'Never mind 
what the United States says -- look what it does,' " GATT Director-General 
Dunkel said. "It's unfortunate for U.S. trading partners to have to face such a 
discrepancy." 
</P>
<P>
By far the most formidable potential stumbling block to a successful accord is 
the U.S.-European dispute over agriculture -- a spat that has grown more 
intense and more expensive as the years have passed. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides want to reduce the cost of subsidies and open more markets for their 
exports. The Brussels-based European Community spends $119.4 billion a year to 
underwrite farmers and farm exports. The United States spends about $73.8 
billion in direct government support and rural development outlays. 
</P>
<P>
But the two sides are split by philosophy and domestic political realities. The 
United States, though hardly averse to subsidizing its farmers, generally 
favors a free-market system. Washington wants an international accord to end 
farm subsidies by a specific date. 
</P>
<P>
But Brussels contends that to do so would force too many of Europe's 20,000 
small farmers off their land and into the cities. The EC does not mind reducing 
some subsidies here and there, but it is flatly unwilling to go nearly as far 
as America would like. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is also out on a limb on textiles. Other countries want to 
phase out existing quotas on textile imports from developing nations, but 
Washington wants only to replace them with a global quota, which would be far 
more restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
With the agenda so complex and far-ranging, virtually all the major issues are 
intertwined. Failure to win approval on even one or two key items could unravel 
the entire accord. 
</P>
<P>
Washington wants Europe to lift import restrictions on soybeans, for example, 
but to get that, it may have to agree to scrap longstanding U.S. sugar and 
dairy quotas. Third World countries that want to sell fruit in more foreign 
countries will have to back new rules for services. 
</P>
<P>
For all the worry over the threat of a breakdown, the trade-liberalization 
talks have come a long way since the United States proposed them at a 
preliminary GATT ministerial session in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, even the suggestion that GATT might tackle an agenda the size of 
today's brought derisive hoots. Third World countries snubbed all proposals on 
services. The session broke up in disarray over merely placing agriculture on 
the table. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. policy-makers say Washington's strategy now is "to go for the large deal" 
-- to push for as many big-ticket items as possible in hope of making a 
successful accord a must. "The small deals can't be sold," a senior U.S. 
strategist said. 
</P>
<P>
And Washington will continue trying to intensify the pressure on Europe and 
other U.S. trading partners during the OECD meeting this week and at the 
seven-nation economic summit in July. "No agreement is better than a bad 
agreement," Bush warned U.S. trading partners last week. 
</P>
<P>
But the most immediate question is whether the United States and Europe can 
break their impasse over agriculture in time to prevent the overall talks from 
fragmenting. Even some Americans are urging Washington to be more 
accommodating. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. has to adopt a more pragmatic position, or there will be no Uruguay 
Round accord," said Harald B. Malmgren, a Washington-based trade consultant. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome remains in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a close call -- a very close call," said William E. Brock III, a 
former U.S. trade representative. 
</P>
<P>
He and other trade experts believe that the United States may ultimately have 
to settle for a pact that some GATT members refuse to sign. What Washington 
needs to do now, Brock says, is make sure that as few countries as possible bow 
out. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, U.S. officials are bracing for a frenetic summer. "The next 
couple of months are going to be fairly key," a U.S. trade negotiator said. 
"The sense of urgency has been instilled. Now comes the hard part -- getting it 
all to play out."

LABOR: THE TEAMSTERS' LONG-SHOT CANDIDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ron Carey, the militant head of a Teamsters Union local in New York City, is 
moving quickly across the country as an insurgent trying to oust the entrenched 
national leaders of the scandal-ridden Teamsters Union. 
</P>
<P>
Carey, a 22-year officer of his 6,000-member local, is a long shot. But even if 
he doesn't win, other honest candidates may come forward because, at last, a 
new democratic election system gives them a chance. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, a federal judge took control of the Teamsters after the Justice 
Department had sued all 18 members of its ruling body, the International 
Executive Board, under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. 
The government said the Teamsters had made a "pact with the devil," giving 
mobsters continuing influence over union operations. 
</P>
<P>
The judge installed a panel of three lawyer-administrators to do three jobs: 
supervise the union, continue an investigation of leaders accused of various 
crimes and set up a democratic election process. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Carey is the only officially declared candidate for president of the 
1.5-million-member union. He predicts that he will win the only secret-ballot 
election in the union's 91-year history. 
</P>
<P>
First, he must finish gathering about 40,000 signatures from supporters to show 
that he is a bona-fide candidate. Under the new election rules, the signatures 
will entitle him to some much-needed early publicity in the union's magazine, 
the Teamster. 
</P>
<P>
He also has started seeking support from many of the 650 local unions that will 
begin in September to elect delegates to the international union's 1991 
convention. Candidates need only 5% of the convention delegates' votes to get 
their names on the ballot that will be mailed to all members. That should be 
fairly easy for Carey to do. 
</P>
<P>
His biggest hurdle is to persuade a majority of the rank and file, most of whom 
have never heard of him, that he is the person to clean up the Teamsters and 
that he has a real chance of winning. Few want to back a candidate who seems to 
be a loser, even if they oppose the incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
It's never easy to oust incumbents in corporations, government or unions, but 
it is particularly difficult in an organization the size of the Teamsters, with 
locals throughout the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Just to mail one piece of campaign literature to the entire membership would 
cost an estimated $250,000, and so far Carey has raised only $150,000 for his 
entire campaign. His own income is $45,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Carey had hoped that the election rules would be more favorable to him than 
they turned out to be. Michael Holland, the court-appointed election supervisor 
who devised the rules, did battle against the political machine of late Chicago 
Mayor Richard Daley and helped Richard Trumka become president of the United 
Mine Workers of America in a successful rebellion against the old guard of that 
union. 
</P>
<P>
But the rules are generally fair, and if Holland makes sure that there are no 
abuses in local elections for convention delegates, Carey will have his shot. 
Depending on who decides to oppose him, the national referendum could be a 
clear test of the membership's desire to clean out leaders tied to the 
underworld. 
</P>
<P>
Carey has some advantages. Few candidates for office in any union have received 
as much news coverage as he is starting to get as he travels across the 
country. He is campaigning against corruption in a notorious union, and that 
makes good copy. 
</P>
<P>
The attention seems to be helping him raise funds inside and outside the union. 
While in Los Angeles last week, he met with, among others, Academy 
Award-winning film director Oliver Stone and Stanley Sheinbaum, the influential 
publisher and economist. 
</P>
<P>
Carey cannot accept campaign funds from employers, but big-name liberals who 
are employers can help him meet potential contributors and those who are not 
employers can make contributions. The bulk of the $1.5 million he hopes to 
raise must come from rank-and-file Teamsters, however. 
</P>
<P>
Another possible advantage: William J. McCarthy, the incumbent president, is 
almost certain to be a candidate. Unlike most of his predecessors, McCarthy has 
not been convicted of any crime. But he is 71, in poor health and has several 
powerful enemies among high Teamster leaders. Infighting atop the Teamster 
pyramid has been increasingly bitter of late. 
</P>
<P>
But Carey has to face the political fact that incumbent officers have long had 
ties to local and regional union leaders -- and many of those leaders are 
unlikely to suddenly sever those ties to support a long shot. But their support 
is important, if not crucial, to the success of a dissident. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean that the local and regional officers are corrupt. Most are 
honest, but they haven't revolted against unsavory top officers before, 
presumably because in a revolution everything is destabilized and their own 
reasonably secure positions might be jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
So perhaps Carey or some other dissident can incite a real revolution in the 
union, as Lech Walesa did when he created the Polish union, Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
If that fails, some of the honest incumbents could reform the union if they 
would just use the new election system to clean up their own house.

2 CARRIERS SELLING TICKETS FOR SAME FLIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: THE FLIGHT IS OPERATED BY CATHAY PACIFIC, BUT AMERICAN AIRLINES 
HAS BOUGHT 38% OF THE SEATS. THE DEAL BENEFITS BOTH.

<P>
Two airlines are running newspaper ads claiming that each will have the only 
nonstop flights between Hong Kong and Los Angeles. Which is telling the truth? 
In a sense, both. 
</P>
<P>
Any confusion is the result of a deal between American Airlines and Hong 
Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways. The planes flying the route, which will be 
inaugurated July 1, will be those of Cathay Pacific. But Cathay Pacific has 
sold 38% of the seats to American. 
</P>
<P>
American is selling the seats as if they were on its own planes. Both airlines 
say every effort is made to tell passengers that they will actually be flying 
Cathay Pacific. The American ads also say so, in relatively small type. 
</P>
<P>
Such block seat-sale arrangements, as they are called, can be good business for 
both carriers. 
</P>
<P>
"Cathay Pacific is a profit-oriented airline," a spokeswoman said. "This 
partnership helps assure that the route will be more financially secure and 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
American, which has no routes to Hong Kong, gets a presence there nevertheless. 
It also gets a chance to attract Cathay Pacific passengers to its U.S. routes. 
"It gives us a marketing opportunity," a spokesman for Dallas-based American 
said. 
</P>
<P>
American, he added, hopes one day to fly between Hong Kong and Los Angeles. But 
getting foreign routes requires bilateral negotiations between the countries 
involved, as well as approval by the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly would like to expand into the Pacific Rim as much as possible," 
the spokesman said. But the airline is putting its major emphasis on acquiring 
additional routes to Japan. American's only Japan route is between Dallas and 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Agreements such as the one between American and Cathay Pacific are not unusual. 
Airlines have purchased blocks of seats on other airlines before. It is often 
done -- as Cathay Pacific is doing -- when an airline is trying to develop a 
new market. 
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific started in 1946 with $30,000 in capital and one route -- between 
Shanghai and Sydney, Australia -- using a refurbished military transport plane. 
It is now considered a highly efficient airline. It flies throughout Asia and 
to major cities in Europe and North America.

WORLD BANK TO DISCUSS NEW CHINA LOANS

<P>
World Bank directors meet today to discuss whether to grant two new loans to 
China, and Japan's government and bankers are awaiting their decision. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo sees the World Bank as the bellwether for progress on ending economic 
sanctions against Beijing, imposed after the Chinese government sent in troops 
against student-led protesters last year on June 3-4. 
</P>
<P>
The West and Japan, shocked by the crackdown, which left hundreds, perhaps 
thousands, dead, suspended official loan credits. The World Bank, the Asian 
Development Bank and many commercial banks followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to June 4, China was a borrower favored by foreign banks and governments, 
with a low per capita foreign debt, a faultless repayment record and a 
nationwide system able to absorb large amounts of aid money. 
</P>
<P>
But the crackdown and the West's strong reaction made commercial banks nervous 
about the regime's stability, its commitment to economic reform and the 
possibility of large-scale unrest. 
</P>
<P>
Strong criticism in Congress of Beijing's human-rights record has prevented 
President George Bush from resuming normal economic ties, including loans from 
the World Bank, which has made only two new loans to China, for humanitarian 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, Beijing says it has made gestures to improve relations with the 
West, lifting martial law in Beijing and Lhasa, Tibet, freeing nearly 800 
people detained after the crackdown and resuming scholarly exchanges with the 
United States 
</P>
<P>
But it has not been enough. 
</P>
<P>
A Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman said earlier this month that it was too 
early to say if a decision to resume loans could be made at the Houston summit 
meeting of leaders of the seven major industrial democracies in July. 
</P>
<P>
"What is important is the progress of mutual efforts (by China and the West), 
not necessarily the summit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Debate over resuming the loans has been fiercest in Japan, whose banks have 
loaned more to China than those of any other country and whose official aid is 
by far the highest. 
</P>
<P>
Cheap loans promised to Beijing, totaling $5.6 billion (810 billion yen) for 
the 1990-94 period, remain frozen. 
</P>
<P>
The banking and business community is urging the government to resume the 
loans, because without them Chinese purchases of Japanese goods have been badly 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting leaders of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have heard Chinese 
leaders argue over the past two months that Japan's interests are different 
from those of the West and it should resume the loans unilaterally, 
</P>
<P>
One of them, Michio Watanabe, went to Washington last week to try to persuade 
President Bush to lift the sanctions, arguing that democratization was more 
likely if China's economy were developing than if it was stagnant. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's commercial banks sit impatiently on the sidelines, waiting for the 
government to resume lending before they do. 
</P>
<P>
"China needs new loans to buy our goods and service its foreign debt," one 
banker said. "But we can't move ahead of the West. Relations with the United 
States are more important to Japan than those with China. We can't afford to 
offend the U.S. That is the bottom line," he said.

Monsanto Chemical Co. and Exxon Chemical Co. said they have reached an 
agreement in principle for merging their respective thermoplastic elastomers 
businesses to create a new, independent company to develop, manufacture and 
market TPEs. 
</P>
<P>
The new company would combine Monsanto's technical, manufacturing and marketing 
expertise in elastomeric alloys with Exxon Chemical's expertise in olefin-based 
raw materials and fundamental polymer science. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the agreement remain to be determined. The target start-up date for 
the new company is the end of 1990, pending the successful conclusion of 
negotiations and approvals of the appropriate government agencies in the United 
States, Latin America and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
TPEs are a diverse family of high-performance rubber-like materials. Unlike 
conventional vulcanized rubber products, TPES can be easily processed and 
recycled. They are used in the automotive, medical, food, electrical and 
construction industries.

JAPAN APPROACHES LAND REFORM WITH CAUTION; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: A MOVEMENT TO CONTROL SPIRALING PROPERTY VALUES IS OFFSET BY 
CONCERN OVER THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON FINANCIAL MARKETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Japan's land prices are so inflated that many experts fear a sudden drop could 
devastate domestic financial markets and send shock waves throughout the global 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, few believe that such a calamity is likely. Although pressure for 
land reform in Japan has grown dramatically over the past year, any changes are 
expected to be slow and cautious. 
</P>
<P>
Japan is only 4% the size of the United States, but its real estate assets are 
worth $14.9 trillion -- four times the value of all U.S. real estate. 
</P>
<P>
A doubling in nationwide land values since 1984 has put home ownership out of 
reach for most Japanese and driven up business costs in city centers. This has 
led to calls for reform of what critics call a Byzantine system of taxes and 
regulation, reform that would make more land available and stop the spiral. 
</P>
<P>
High land prices also have become a trade issue. U.S. officials complain that 
high rents make doing business here prohibitively expensive for foreign 
companies, subverting Japan's claim that it is leveling the playing field for 
competitors from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Promises made by Tokyo during trade talks to increase the available land supply 
through tax and other reforms, theoretically lowering land prices, are likely 
to be carried out over a long period of time, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
But these analysts also say the cost of significantly cutting land prices would 
far outweigh the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The overheated Japanese real estate market has supported phenomenal growth in 
Japan's stock markets and overseas investment. The sense of wealth evoked by 
ballooning property values has fueled unprecedented consumer spending, 
contributing to four years of uninterrupted economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
A Bank of Japan report issued on May 9 said the government should find ways to 
cool overheated land prices gradually but avoid sudden measures that could hurt 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Experiences abroad suggest that it is important to forestall any turbulence 
which might arise from a sudden change in land prices, in order to maintain a 
safe and sound financial system," the central bank said. 
</P>
<P>
Economists here agree that a sudden drop in prices would have a disastrous 
impact on the stock market, on banks and on other lenders. 
</P>
<P>
The integration of Japan's economy with the rest of the world ensures that such 
a shock also would hit foreign financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
"The financial markets here are founded on trust in rising land prices," said 
Susumu Kato, head of economic research at Goldman Sachs (Japan). "Lots of 
borrowing for stock trading at home and overseas is based on land collateral." 
</P>
<P>
A fall in land values would generate bad debts throughout the system and 
cripple major banks and securities houses, Kato said. 
</P>
<P>
Major financial institutions would face a cash crunch as the value of 
collateral evaporated. Many would pull out of foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
That possibility could do particular damage in the United States, where 
Japanese investment has become an increasingly influential force, especially in 
the market for U.S. Treasury bonds used to finance the large federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
A drop in Japanese demand for U.S. Treasury bonds could force the United States 
to raise interest rates to attract other buyers. Some economists say that would 
set off a chain reaction that could lead to a recession. 
</P>
<P>
Most overseas investment is based on borrowing against real estate at home. 
"They don't have that kind of cash just lying around," said Ronald B. Talmage, 
assistant director in Tokyo of the British investment bank N. M. Rothschild 
&amp; Sons. 
</P>
<P>
The risk of exposure if real estate prices here fall has worsened recently. 
Commercial finance and leasing firms, for example, have ignored Finance 
Ministry warnings and increased their lending based on real estate, said David 
Pike, manager of research at UBS Phillips and Drew International. 
</P>
<P>
After real estate-related loans grew 14.1% last year to a total of $310 
billion, the ministry told banks not to let such lending grow faster than 
overall lending. 
</P>
<P>
Barring more drastic government action, there is little likelihood of a 
downward spiral in land prices because demand for land remains strong, Pike 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Land prices climbed only 2% in Tokyo last year, versus 23.8% in 1987 and 65.3% 
in 1988. But nationwide, prices jumped 17% last year as inflation spread to 
Tokyo's distant suburbs and other major cities. 
</P>
<P>
"There's demand for residential construction and a shift in preference toward 
larger homes," Pike said. "Growth in economic activity, new roads and railways, 
all these use land." 
</P>
<P>
Demand continues to rise on these islands crowded with 123 million people, but 
supply remains limited. The Construction Ministry estimates that tax laws and 
zoning regulations are preventing the conversion of 148,200 acres of farmland 
and under-utilized sites in the Tokyo metropolitan area alone to commercial and 
residential use. 
</P>
<P>
Government plans to revise tax laws to encourage development of such land are 
unlikely to bring about a sudden change, the analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
"If they puncture the land price balloon, it would shock the market, but 
they're not going to do that," Pike said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Japan report called for reforms to curb property speculation and 
encourage more efficient land use. Financial institutions should also be 
monitored, it said. 
</P>
<P>
"In our view, the report showed that the Bank of Japan was serious about the 
land-price problem," said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, senior economist at Salomon 
Bros. (Asia) Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
He said the report, which attributed some of the land-price inflation to easy 
credit, indicated that the central bank would keep interest rates high to help 
curb excessive lending to land speculators. 
</P>
<P>
The bank's discount rate, the loan fee to banks that strongly affects other 
interest rates, remained at 2.5% for nine years until last May. Since then, the 
bank has raised it four times to curb inflation and help support its weakening 
currency. It is now 5.25%. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to make doomsday statements, but I don't think the problem should be 
exaggerated. The gap (between land prices and other prices) has been growing 
for 20 years. I don't see any of that changing overnight," Schoenholtz said.

EL CAMINO FINDING OPPORTUNITIES BY EXPLOITING ITS RIVALS' ADVERSITIES; 
</P>
<P>
COMPUTERS: THE CURRENT WOES OF THE LEASING BUSINESS ARE ACTUALLY BENEFITING 
THIS NORTHRIDGE DEALER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Computer leasing is not a business for the faint-hearted. A decade ago, Itel 
Corp., OPM Leasing Services and other big lessors went broke. These days the 
industry, fiercely competitive as always, is going through another shakeout. 
</P>
<P>
But in that turbulence a Northridge company, El Camino Resources Ltd., sees 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino buys, sells and leases computers to businesses, and the company 
believes it can shed its small-time status and become a major player in part by 
exploiting the problems besetting some of its leasing rivals. 
</P>
<P>
"We're beefing up the leasing side because there's been a big fallout in 
leasing companies right now," said David E. Harmon, El Camino's president and 
co-founder. "To be honest with you, the company has always fed off of other 
people's problems." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, privately held El Camino was founded in 1979 just as Itel and the other 
lessors ran out of cash and collapsed. "We were Itel's largest customer when 
they were going down," Harmon said. "We were buying products from them like 
crazy." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino has grown briskly since then, as has the computer leasing and trading 
industry generally, despite some of its members' problems. (Computer trading 
refers to the buying and selling of equipment between computer brokers and 
dealers such as El Camino, as opposed to the manufacturers' sales directly to 
the machines' end users.) 
</P>
<P>
In its fiscal year that ended April 30, El Camino's revenue totaled $254 
million, up from $55 million four years earlier, and the company now has 172 
employees spread over nine offices. Total U.S. trading and leasing of computer 
equipment climbed to $23 billion last year from $16 billion in 1987, according 
to the Computer Dealers &amp; Lessors Assn., a Washington-based trade group. 
</P>
<P>
But El Camino's size is still dwarfed by Comdisco Inc., the nation's biggest 
independent computer lessor, which had $1.7 billion in fiscal 1989 revenue, and 
by International Business Machines Corp., which in addition to being the 
world's biggest computer maker is also a huge lessor with roughly $2 billion in 
annual worldwide leasing revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, El Camino expects to triple its annual leasing business -- which 
produced $82 million of revenue in the latest fiscal year -- because it has two 
new Japanese partners with deep pockets, Japan Leasing Corp. and Applied 
Technology Corp. Last month, they agreed to invest an undisclosed amount of 
cash in El Camino in exchange for a combined 25% stake in the company. (Harmon 
maintains a 27% interest, and four other El Camino executives own the remaining 
stock.) 
</P>
<P>
"They saw it as an opportunity to build a substantial leasing operation here in 
the U.S. working with us," Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
But with El Camino's growth has come at least one problem: The company is 
making less of a profit per dollar of revenue than it was four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1986, El Camino earned $2.4 million, giving it an after-tax profit 
margin of 4.4%. In fiscal 1990, the company's revenue was nearly five times 
higher, but its profit of $4.3 million was less than twice as big, so its 
profit margin last year was only 1.7%. By contrast, Comdisco, a Rosemont, Ill., 
concern, had a fiscal 1989 profit margin of 6.4%. 
</P>
<P>
The problem? Brian Ofria, El Camino's chief financial officer, said margins are 
slim on many of the big computers that El Camino buys and sells, mainly because 
many competitors offer the same equipment. Like most of the leasing business, 
El Camino specializes in trading IBM's products, and IBM's own sales and 
leasing efforts also have been a big factor in keeping a lid on the industry's 
profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
IBM lately has been "as aggressive as we've ever seen," said Ken Bouldin, 
president of the Computer Dealers &amp; Lessors. "IBM itself is offering steep 
discounts on its equipment that people purchase." He said IBM Credit Corp., its 
financing and leasing unit, also "is offering aggressively low rates for lease 
deals. As a result, it's difficult for some of the industry's companies to slug 
it out with IBM." 
</P>
<P>
Ofria said El Camino also takes a conservative accounting approach to valuing 
its leasing business, which hurts its profits. Specifically, it conservatively 
guesses how much the computers will be worth for resale after leasing customers 
return the machines, and it depreciates the computers' value more rapidly on 
its books. Depreciation is subtracted from a company's net income. 
</P>
<P>
Correctly guessing a computer's future selling price, or "residual value," 
isn't easy. The original value of a computer can plunge only a year or two 
after its introduction if its technology is made obsolete by a newer machine. 
If so, a lessor such as El Camino could be saddled with an antiquated computer 
that fetches far less than originally predicted when re-leased or sold. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Harmon said that with El Camino increasing its leasing business, 
the company's profit margin will get worse before it gets better. But El 
Camino's other co-founder, David Wolff, an executive vice president, said the 
increased leasing activity "means more equipment to go ahead and sell and 
remarket when it comes off lease," which should bolster El Camino's performance 
in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon is key to El Camino's performance, at least to some of its customers. 
He's "very loyal to you, which means that regardless of what the contract says, 
Dave will demonstrate flexibility," said William Strowbridge, who runs the 
computer department at Dataproducts Corp., a Woodland Hills maker of computer 
printers that leases large-scale computers. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Michigan State University, Harmon, 51, first worked for IBM for 
four years and then, in the 1970s, he was a vice president at Electronic 
Memories &amp; Magnetics, a maker of computer memory products. Wolff worked for 
Harmon at EM&amp;M before the two left in 1979 to form El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
"Was there a grandiose plan at that point? No, I don't think so," Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
Because it's privately held, El Camino has no quoted stock price to establish 
its market value. But a rough measure can come from comparing it with publicly 
held Comdisco, whose market value as of Friday was $775 million, or 46% of its 
annual sales. Using that gauge, El Camino would be worth $116 million, and 
Harmon's stake alone $31 million. (It should be noted that Comdisco's price has 
fallen recently, however. Its market value in March was $1 billion.) 
</P>
<P>
For now, Harmon claims he has no interest in cashing out by selling El Camino, 
even though he's already received at least one takeover bid. And to hear Harmon 
tell it, few would-be buyers would be interested anyway, because they would 
have to buy El Camino without Harmon at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably wouldn't stay, frankly," meaning a buyer's "prospects for making 
the maximum return are not as good," he said. "And this is a people business." 
</P>
<P>
EL CAMINO RESOURCES AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Resources Ltd. in Northridge sells and leases computers and related 
equipment, primarily to businesses. Founded in 1979, the company also provides 
emergency computer-back-up services. El Camino has 172 employees and is 
privately held.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will not make a previously announced 
visit to the Hoover Institution during his trip to Stanford University next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials decided that Gorbachev's schedule during his June 3 and 4 
visit to the Bay Area "was just too tight," Bob Freelen, Stanford vice 
president for public affairs, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
During the Stanford visit, Gorbachev will meet with University President Donald 
Kennedy; former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, now a professor of 
international economics at Stanford's Graduate School of Business, and with 
students and other faculty members at the school of business. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace, a longtime bastion of 
anti-communism, has one of the world's largest collection of material on the 
1917 Russian Revolution, including "mug shots" of known revolutionaries that 
came from the secret police files of the czarist days.

BIG RADAR STATION BEING DISMANTLED

The Soviet Union has begun to dismantle its long-disputed Krasnoyarsk radar 
station in a bid to clear the way for a strategic arms treaty, U.S. and Soviet 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told President Bush in a letter last 
September that the Soviet Union would take down the station in Siberia without 
conditions. On Oct. 23, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze conceded 
that the radar station, which is 30 stories high, was "a clear violation" of 
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. source said that only in recent days was there evidence that the process 
of dismantling the radar had actually begun.

YELTSIN OFFERS TO SHARE POWER IN NEW BID FOR RUSSIAN PRESIDENCY

<P>
Populist maverick Boris N. Yeltsin on Monday renewed his bid to become 
president of Russia, the Soviet Union's largest republic, and offered 
conservatives a share in a coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin failed to muster enough votes in the first two rounds of balloting. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest round on Saturday, he fell 28 votes short of the 531 needed in 
the Russian Congress. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Yeltsin told the 1,060-member Congress he is willing to form a 
coalition with his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
He invited members of the Communist Party bloc and others to "work out a deal 
that would please the majority of Russian deputies." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's opponents in today's contest will be the republic's current prime 
minister, Alexander V. Vlasov, and Valentin Tsoy, a little-known businessman 
from the Soviet Far East. 
</P>
<P>
In a switch to block Yeltsin's candidacy for the Russian presidency, the 
Communist Party dropped its support for hard-liner Ivan K. Polozkov and 
resurrected Vlasov's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
Vlasov, the candidate initially picked by Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, withdrew in apparent disgrace Friday after a lackluster defense of 
the Kremlin leader's policies. 
</P>
<P>
But he rejoined the contest Monday, and Polozkov, a party boss from Krasnodar 
in southern Russia, pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
Russia, the largest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics, stretches from the 
Baltic to the Pacific and includes Moscow and many major cities. It is home to 
more than half the country's population. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin called on the deputies to reject the central Soviet government's 
program for a transition to a partial market economy, which was announced last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"The Congress must take the citizens of Russia under its defense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Discontent over the economic program, which will double food prices, has 
boosted Yeltsin's chances, his backers say.

Trains were rolling again in northern Poland on Monday after Solidarity leader 
Lech Walesa intervened to stop a wildcat strike by disgruntled Polish train 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa's middle-of-the-night intercession halted a weeklong strike that pitted 
workers against the government's post-Communist economic reformers, who refused 
to negotiate wage demands of the workers. The officials argued that a 
capitulation on salary demands could lead to more strikes. 
</P>
<P>
The workers had threatened a 90-minute nationwide strike for Monday, but after 
a meeting with Walesa in the northern city of Slupsk that ended at 1:30 a.m., 
the strike was called off. The transport minister said passenger service will 
be fully restored by today. 
</P>
<P>
The work stoppage had virtually paralyzed the Baltic ports of Szczecin and 
Gdansk. 
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the management of the state-run railroads will meet 
with unions to iron out grievances. Walesa said he will meet with the workers' 
strike committee June 13. 
</P>
<P>
The Solidarity trade union never endorsed the strike, but the rival trade union 
federation, OPZZ, entered the strike in support of the wildcatters. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa first met with the strikers on Saturday night in Slupsk, but that 
meeting was unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
"On our road to democracy," Walesa said, "there are various dangerous curves, 
and the railway workers' protest was one of them. We all have to take lessons 
and draw conclusions from it." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa said the agreement suspending the strike included "no promises that 
would be impossible to fulfill later." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa holds no official government position, and, indeed, has had his 
differences with the government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, mostly 
over the impact of the government's austerity measures on Polish workers. 
</P>
<P>
Strict wage controls coupled with sharply rising prices have reduced real 
incomes by an estimated 40%, a hardship Walesa sympathized with in his 
negotiations with the workers. "Your demands are right, but the form that you 
are doing it in . . . a strike in the present situation, is anarchy on the road 
to the construction of a democracy." 
</P>
<P>
The government, wary of Walesa's past barbs, issued a muted statement. 
Government spokesman Zbigniew Augustynowicz said the ending of the strike 
"certainly makes the situation easier. . . . This is a fulfillment of what the 
government expected. The government has always said it would not talk under the 
gun of a strike." 
</P>
<P>
The settlement -- temporary though it is -- amounts to a victory both for 
Walesa and Prime Minister Mazowiecki's government. 
</P>
<P>
From the government point of view, the strike offered evidence, at least for 
the moment, that there is no widespread public support for strikes, with polls 
showing a mere 16% of the public behind the railway workers. And the 
government's economic planners may have demonstrated their resolve to other 
potential strike leaders. 
</P>
<P>
For Walesa, the settlement suggests, once again, his power as a mediator and 
bargainer. Polls have indicated that Walesa's own popularity with the general 
public has been falling, possibly as a result of the obvious friction between 
him and the popular Mazowiecki. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa's aides have said that he is preparing to run for Poland's presidency, 
possibly as early as next year, if President Wojciech Jaruzelski, the former 
Communist Party leader, steps down. 
</P>
<P>
While the government could take heart at the conclusion of the strike, 
officials were disappointed with the low turnout of 42% of registered voters in 
Sunday's local government elections. They were the first free local elections 
in Poland since before World War II, and the government had urged public 
participation as a means of rooting local Communist officials out of office. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is virtually certain that most incumbents were removed, officials 
had hoped that the turnout would at least equal the 60% recorded for last 
year's partially free parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
"The first free elections prove that democracy will not appear automatically 
together with lifting limitations on creating it," said a commentary in the 
Solidarity daily newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza.

Americans flew the flag proudly and shed unashamed tears for their war dead 
Monday, the first Memorial Day since 23 fresh graves were dug for soldiers and 
sailors killed in the invasion of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
"They never knew whether their overall mission was successful . . . . " Navy 
Capt. Ron Pearson said at a service at Ft. Sam Houston in San Antonio, Tex. 
"Freedom is ours because others paid a price for our lives." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, at a Memorial Day ceremony in his summer hometown of 
Kennebunkport, Me., also paid tribute to servicemen who died in the December 
invasion that ousted Panamanian dictator Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns at 
Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington where 214,000 servicemen and 
women are interred. 
</P>
<P>
Veterans and others streamed to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, 
adding more flowers, written messages and mementos to those already left at the 
polished black granite wall. Later Monday, an estimated 2,000 people gathered 
for a ceremony and wreath-laying at the wall. 
</P>
<P>
In Cicero, Ind., a headstone was placed on the grave of Ryan White, who died of 
complications of AIDS nearly two months ago after spending five years educating 
the public about the disease he contracted through blood products. 
</P>
<P>
The stone bears the epitaph "Kid Of Courage," written by his mother, plus 
tributes from Gov. Evan Bayh, singers Elton John and Michael Jackson and other 
relatives and friends.

In Houston, members of a crowd of about 10,000 people at a free rap concert 
turned unruly over delays and started hurling bottles. Shots reportedly were 
fired and the rest of the event was canceled. Authorities said about six people

President Bush said Monday he is awaiting a report on the reopened 
investigation into the explosion last year aboard the battleship Iowa, and that 
if Clayton M. Hartwig is shown to be innocent of any blame, the dead seaman 
deserves an apology. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he cannot reach any conclusions until he sees all the facts, but he 
said: "Clearly, I'm interested." 
</P>
<P>
It was his first comment on the matter since investigators reported new 
evidence to Congress on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Sandia National Laboratory, hired by Congress to look into the tragedy, 
challenged the Navy's conclusion that the April, 1989, blast that killed 
Hartwig and 46 other sailors was probably an act of suicidal sabotage by 
Hartwig, a gunner's mate. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred in the reconditioned World War II battleship while gun 
crews were firing the 16-inch guns in the No. 2 turret. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandia report suggested that the explosion could have been caused by 
gunners "over-ramming" the powder bags into a gun breech. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, wrapping up a four-day Memorial Day weekend at his summer home here, was 
asked if Hartwig deserved an apology. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no opinion on it," Bush told reporters before teeing off at the Cape 
Arundel Golf Club. "I really have no judgment." 
</P>
<P>
But, he said: "If the man is innocent, is proved innocent, of these 
allegations, clearly there should be a statement to that effect." 
</P>
<P>
The President declined comment when asked to assess the Navy's initial 
investigation, which critics have charged was flawed and even bent on pinning 
blame on Hartwig rather than its own equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't assess it until I get all the facts. They'll get it (the report) to 
me. . . . I don't know how long."

About 1,000 passengers on a luxury liner that ran aground in the Delaware Bay 
crossed a gangplank Monday night to a ferry that brought them back to land, the 
Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two days after the cruise had been scheduled to end, the ferry Delaware 
pulled alongside the 642-foot Regent Star, and passengers transferred to it, 
the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
As the cheering passengers arrived on shore, buses waited to take them back to 
their cars at airports and bus stations in the Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., 
and New York City areas. 
</P>
<P>
The ship got stuck on a sand bar early Sunday after a small fire knocked out 
power. It was carrying 1,360 people, about 300 of whom were crew members. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody was in danger during the two days atop the sand bar, the Coast Guard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Regent Star, sitting a mile off Fortescue, N.J., had been in the final leg 
of a seven-day cruise from Montego Bay, Jamaica, when it ran aground.

GARAMENDI, PRESS, COLLIS TAKING LOANS DOWN THE STRETCH

Reverberations continued Monday over loans taken by two big spenders in the 
race for insurance commissioner, with state Sen. John Garamendi's campaign 
refusing to disclose how the first installment of a $700,000 loan will be 
repaid, and Board of Equalization Chairman Conway Collis saying his home is 
worth enough to finance his $673,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi's campaign contribution and spending report filed last week showed 
that the first $200,000 repayment of his loan is due to the Union Safety 
Deposit Bank of Stockton, on June 18, only 13 days after the primary. 
</P>
<P>
Revels Cayton, Garamendi's campaign manager, refused to disclose Monday where 
the money would come from for the repayment. "I can't comment about the 
senator's personal finances," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Collis, answering a question about his loan, said his home is worth $1.4 
million, not $1 million as an opponent suggested Saturday, and that he was 
therefore able to obtain a $650,000 second mortgage on it from the Equitable 
Mortgage Co. The other $23,000 in loans for his campaign came from other 
assets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Television commentator Bill Press said he has taken out a $100,000 loan for his 
campaign, obtaining a second mortgage on properties he owns in Los Angeles and 
Marin counties. Press said a report on the loan, the first he has taken, will 
be made to state election authorities today. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, spokesmen for Democrats Garamendi, Collis and Press clarified their 
contribution reports of last week, pointing out that these reports did not 
include fund raising or transfers from last year, and thus the three campaigns 
are bigger than reported in The Times Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Garamendi campaign acknowledged gathering $1,417,150 overall, the Press 
campaign $1,059,264 and the Collis campaign $1,022,834. These clarified figures 
mean that Garamendi has received contributions, in addition to loans, of 
$717,150, the Collis campaign $349,854 and the Press campaign $959,264. 
</P>
<P>
Press and Collis, meanwhile, questioned who had contributed the money making up 
new Garamendi transfers of $43,689 from his Senate reelection committee to his 
insurance commissioner campaign committee, bringing the total of such transfers 
to $299,778. 
</P>
<P>
Press said he wonders if this is secret insurance industry money, but 
Garamendi's manager said there is nothing embarrassing about the donors, and he 
promised to make the names of the contributors of the $43,689 available this 
week.

MAN RESCUED AFTER NIGHT AT BOTTOM OF MINE SHAFT

<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego County man who broke his arm while exploring an abandoned mine 
shaft near this remote desert community was pulled to safety early Monday after 
spending the night at the bottom of the shaft. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Smith, 29, of Fallbrook, was airlifted by a California Highway Patrol 
helicopter to Desert Hospital in Palm Springs, where he was treated and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and two friends on Sunday night had descended by rope into the 
85-foot-deep Lorman Mine, about 140 miles east of Los Angeles, and were 
climbing out when a rock dislodged, striking Smith's arm and breaking it, 
according to Patty Furbush, a U.S. Bureau of Land Management ranger. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's partners lowered him to the floor of the shaft, intending to pull him 
out with their vehicle, Furbush said. However, the car would not start, so one 
of Smith's friends, who was not identified, set out on foot to find help. 
</P>
<P>
After walking about four miles through the desert, Furbush said, Smith's friend 
encountered members of the Twentynine Palms React team, a group of ham radio 
operators, who had set up camp at a rest area along California 62. The radio 
operators notified authorities. 
</P>
<P>
A rescue team from the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department was dispatched, 
arrived at the mine at about 5 a.m., and secured the 240-pound Smith to a 
gurney. He was lifted out and flown to Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
"He was dirty; he was talking; he was fine," Furbush said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith declined to discuss the incident.

ACCIDENTS KILL AT LEAST 45 ON ROADS

<P>
Traffic accidents killed at least 45 people in California from the start of the 
Memorial Day holiday weekend until early Monday, the California Highway Patrol 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The total, which covered the period from 6 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Monday, was 
two more than in the same period in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officials said about half of the holiday traffic deaths can be traced to 
drivers who drank, despite enforcement efforts that netted 2,322 arrests, up 
from 2,105 reported last year. 
</P>
<P>
An allegedly drunk pickup-truck driver was blamed for running a stop sign early 
Sunday in western Fresno County, causing the deaths of his four passengers, 
including a girl about 8, in the single mishap involving the most fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Diego area, a motorist celebrating his 22nd birthday and suspected 
to be drunk was killed in an auto accident in La Jolla that left five 
passengers injured Sunday afternoon, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles and Orange counties, where about 50 law enforcement agencies 
joined forces in a massive program to keep drunk drivers off the streets, at 
least 14 people were killed.

<P>
The bodies of five American servicemen killed nearly 40 years ago in the Korean 
War were returned to their countrymen Monday in an emotional Memorial Day 
ceremony marking them as heroes. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first return of U.S. Korean War dead from Communist North Korea 
since 1954. More than 8,000 Americans from the 1950-53 conflict are still 
unaccounted for. 
</P>
<P>
Five brown caskets and five small boxes containing buttons, dog tags, boots and 
pieces of uniforms were turned over to eight U.S. congressmen by North Korea, 
the enemy in the war. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell (D-Colo.) peered down at one of the caskets 
as it was opened ceremoniously to be checked and saw a skeleton beneath a white 
silk cloth. 
</P>
<P>
"All I could think was that one or two of these unidentified might have been 
one or two of my friends," said Campbell, who served 13 months in Korea in the 
Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
The return of the remains is widely seen as a North Korean gesture to improve 
relations with the United States. The countries do not have diplomatic 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. military officials said the remains will be flown to Hickam Air Base in 
Hawaii today for a hero's welcome and the painstaking process of 
identification, which could take several months. 
</P>
<P>
Pallbearers in suits and ties, wearing white gloves and lapel pins of North 
Korean leader Kim Il Sung, handed the caskets over to the congressional 
delegation in the truce village of Panmunjom inside the demilitarized zone 
separating the two Koreas. 
</P>
<P>
The caskets were draped with blue flags of the United Nations, the flag under 
which American forces fought in Korea. 
</P>
<P>
The transfer came after Rep. G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery (D-Miss.), chairman of 
the House Veterans Affairs Committee, signed a document with North Korea 
confirming that he had received the remains. 
</P>
<P>
Americans discounted speculation that there might be American prisoners still 
alive in North Korea, saying both Soviet and North Korean diplomats have 
assured them that is not the case. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel happiness, sadness, bitterness," said Lt. Col. Don Byers, the only 
active duty serviceman now stationed in Korea who fought in the war. "I want to 
know where the rest are. Why five? Why not 500?" 
</P>
<P>
The remains of the five returned Monday were unearthed in 1987. and are those 
of two U.S. All five were believed to have been prisoners of war and died in 
Hwanghae Pukto province south of North Korea's capital of Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Defense Department tentatively has identified two of the dead as Army 
1st Lt. Jack J. Saunders, 27, of Ogden, Utah, and Army Cpl. Arthur Leo Seaton, 
20, of Chester, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon lists 33,629 Americans killed during the Korean War. There are 
8,172 others missing in action and 389 prisoners of war unaccounted for. The 
two sides exchanged remains through Panmunjom until 1954, with the north 
returning the remains of 1,869 Americans, 607 South Koreans and 1,636 others 
unidentifiable. By way of comparison: 58,156 Americans lost their lives in the 
Vietnam War, with over 2,300 missing.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
BEST CHOICES FOR THE COURTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two of the toughest decisions facing voters June 5 are in the judicial contests 
for open seats in the West Orange County Municipal Court and on the Superior 
Court bench. 
</P>
<P>
What makes judicial races so difficult for most voters is that they usually 
know little or nothing about the candidates. Judicial elections are low profile 
because judges and would-be judges generally are loath to solicit money and to 
wage the kind of knockdown, spirited campaigns that typify other contests. 
Judicial candidates are concerned about being considered too "unjudicial." 
</P>
<P>
This year is no different. But in both contests, there are well-qualified 
candidates thatOrange County residents can vote for with confidence. 
</P>
<P>
We have talked with all the candidates, read their literature, checked their 
backgrounds and discussed their qualifications with attorneys and judges in an 
effort to determine who most possesses the qualities that people want to see in 
judges: honesty, knowledge of the law, sound judicial temperament, independence 
and the ability to see and understand the issue. A good dose of common sense is 
a must, too. 
</P>
<P>
In the Municipal Court race, Donald S. Macintyre, who has been a commissioner 
in the court since 1986, is best qualified. As a commissioner, Macintyre has 
been doing all the work a judge would do and has done it so well that he has 
won the support of all the judges in the West Court and endorsements from a 
variety of law enforcement, political and labor groups. 
</P>
<P>
Macintyre is a former prosecutor, and he served as a presiding judge in Lassen 
County for nine years before coming to Orange County. His experience and proven 
ability on the bench make him the best choice. 
</P>
<P>
In the Superior Court race, there are two well-qualified candidates. Robert E. 
Thomas and Glenn Mahler are both Municipal Court judges who deserve to move up 
to the Superior Court bench. But having to pick one, we give Thomas the edge 
because of his extensive activities in trying to improve the court system to 
make it speedier and more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, in addition to his courtroom duties, has been selected to lecture to 
new, incoming Municipal Court judges, and he teaches law courses. He has also 
been innovative in trying to improve the lower court system. Thomas has been a 
leading proponent of weekend arraignments to reduce jail overcrowding, of video 
arraignments of County Jail prisoners to save time and transportation costs, 
and of an "image processing" system for court records. 
</P>
<P>
Voters should make Donald S. Macintyre a permanent judge in the West Orange 
County Municipal Court and elect Robert E. Thomas to the Superior Court bench.

Children's author Lucy Boston, who didn't begin writing until she was 60, has 
died at age 97 at the 12th-Century manor that was the setting and inspiration 
for her books. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Boston, whose best-known work was "The Children of Green Knowe," suffered 
a stroke several weeks ago and died Friday, her son Peter Boston said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
He was the illustrator of most of her books. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Mrs. Boston's 18 books were translated into Japanese, Swedish, German 
and Afrikaans. "The Children of Green Knowe" was adapted into a serial for 
British Broadcasting Corp. television in 1984 while most of her tales were used 
regularly on the BBC's story-reading hour. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Boston wrote a series of Green Knowe books as well as "The Castle of Yew," 
"The Sea Egg," "Nothing Said," "The Guardians of the House" and "The Fossil 
Snake." 
</P>
<P>
In 1960, she was awarded the Carnegie Medal for children's books. 
</P>
<P>
In 1938 Mrs. Boston bought the Manor House, one of the oldest inhabited houses 
in England, and restored it. It represented a way of life to her and in her 
works became "Green Knowe," an old, haunted house. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the moated house, with gardens stretching to the nearby River Ouse, was 
built from 1120 to 1150. It is at Hemingford Grey in Huntingdonshire, 60 miles 
north of London.

<P>
Robert B. Meyner, a one-time country lawyer who overcame a dominant Republican 
Party to become New Jersey's first Democratic governor in 13 years, has died. 
</P>
<P>
It was reported Monday that he was 81 when he died Sunday in Captiva, Fla., 
where he had retired many years ago. Emma Byrne, press secretary to New Jersey 
Gov. Jim Florio, said Meyner had been in poor health since suffering a stroke 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Meyner, who was New Jersey's chief of state from 1954 until 1962, was the first 
governor to serve two terms after a new state constitution was adopted in 1947. 
He sought an additional term in 1969 and won the Democratic nomination but lost 
the general election to Republican William Cahill. 
</P>
<P>
As governor, Meyner was known as a frugal spender of taxpayer money who 
boasted, "I could pinch a penny until it hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Meyner, who had practiced law in the small New Jersey town of Phillipsburg 
since 1936, was credited with keeping a balanced state budget, and with ably 
administering basic state needs such as water supply and land management. He 
oversaw the completion of the New Jersey Turnpike in the mid-1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Running for reelection in 1957, he was challenged by multimillionaire magazine 
publisher Malcolm Forbes, a Republican, who late in the campaign had scheduled 
a program to come on television just after the end of one of Meyner's. But 
Meyner decided to end his TV appeal for votes with the national anthem and a 
picture of the American flag. Many viewers thought their station had signed off 
for the night and turned off their sets. 
</P>
<P>
His success in the state put him in demand for speaking engagements across the 
country. From 1958 to early 1960, he was considered a possibility for the 
Democratic nomination for president.

NOT EVERY CEO'S TAKE-HOME PAY IS SO AWESOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Keizo Yoshida is the top officer of Sumitomo Bank of California, a big, 
profitable institution. Yet with an annual pay package worth $210,400, he earns 
only a fraction of what executives at similar banks take home. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshida isn't destitute, of course. But neither is he unique. Even as big money 
gets all the headlines, a surprising number of top executives are paid 
relatively modestly. 
</P>
<P>
The Times took a look at the 20 lowest-paid chief executives of California's 
largest publicly held companies -- those with sales exceeding $250 million. Not 
one of the men made more than $406,000, and Yoshida was the lowest paid among 
them. By contrast, the highest-paid executives running companies with revenues 
between $250 million and $500 million earned between $940,000 and $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshida's relatively low pay illustrates the huge difference between the lavish 
pay scales for American managers and the more modest ones for Japanese 
executives. As a Japanese citizen running a Japanese-owned California bank, 
Yoshida gets paid according to Japanese practices. In the Japanese automobile 
industry, for example, a chief executive's pay on average is 20 times that of a 
blue-collar worker. In the U.S. auto industry, the ratio is 192 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Others on the low-pay list suffered because of poor profits at their companies. 
In many instances, executives take low salaries and rely on building the value 
of large equity stakes in their companies. 
</P>
<P>
Managers with large ownership stakes in the firms they run often feel that 
their interests are better served by plowing profits back into the company 
rather than pouring them into their personal checking accounts, said Donald L. 
Lowman, principal at Towers, Perrin, Forster &amp; Crosby in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, more than half the executives on the "low-paid" list own between 1% 
and 60% of the common stock in their firms. Some say their take-home pay is not 
that important. 
</P>
<P>
"I went for seven years without a raise," said Gerald Barton, chief executive 
of Landmark Land Co. in Carmel. Why? "I'm the one who recommends raises for the 
rest of the staff, and I'm obviously not going to recommend my own. I think the 
directors just forgot about me." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Landmark has seen better days. The company lost $34.9 million in 
1989, compared to a $16-million profit in 1988. And savings and loan regulators 
blocked the $967-million sale of several of the company's resort properties. 
Landmark has since hired Salomon Bros. to find a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
At Silicon Graphics, Chief Executive Edward R. McCracken's pay can be explained 
by the company's philosophy, said Mark Perry, executive vice president. The 
Mountain View, Calif.-based computer firm is one of the fastest growing in the 
nation, Perry noted. That's partly because officers take relatively low base 
salaries in exchange for stock options. 
</P>
<P>
The company then has more working capital, and the officers have the 
opportunity to reap tremendous rewards when the stock rises rapidly. So far 
they haven't cashed in. When they do, their compensation will rise 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
"Our stock was selling for $16 a year ago, and it's going for about $32 now," 
Perry said. "That would be a major element of compensation for somebody who 
owns shares." 
</P>
<P>
But not all are happy about their place on the low-pay list. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dubious distinction," muttered Hal Ellis, chairman and chief executive 
of San Francisco-based Grubb &amp; Ellis, a diversified real estate firm. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis said he's on the list because his company's performance is not up to 
snuff, and the company adheres to a pay-for-performance plan. 
</P>
<P>
"If we achieved our profit goals for the year, some of us could have earned 
incentive compensation packages that would exceed 100% of salary," Ellis said. 
"But last year virtually none of my compensation was in incentives, and the 
same holds true for the year before because the company's profitability did not 
warrant incentive pay." 
</P>
<P>
Grubb &amp; Ellis earned $521,000 on revenue of $362 million in 1989. The year 
before, it lost $1.9 million on $374.7 million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a strong upside when we can perform," Ellis said, bemoaning the real 
estate slump. "That will eventually change. But in the meantime, our 
compensation gives us every incentive to do all we can to positively affect the 
profitability of the company."

BRAZILIAN PROVES THE PERFECT TONIC AS CHANG BEGINS DEFENSE OF TITLE

On the first day of the defense of his French Open title, Michael Chang counted 
the friendly faces in the stands. One, two, three, four, five. 
</P>
<P>
"We have Team Chang," said Joe Chang, the player's father. 
</P>
<P>
From the stands of Court One, Team Chang gathered on a sunny Monday morning to 
rally around its struggling leader. In front of his parents, younger brother, 
hitting partner and physical therapist, Chang responded by beating Cassio Motta 
of Brazil, 6-1, 7-6 (7-5), 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Chang, who has taken a leave of absence from his job to travel the circuit 
coaching his son, said they have been working a lot on the service game. 
</P>
<P>
"I want him to become a thinker on his serves," Joe Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
But for the younger Chang, thinking has been a problem. The trouble is that he 
thinks about what happened to him here last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It went fast," Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the people are kind of wondering to see how I play this year. Has he 
gotten better or worse? Is he taller? Bigger? Stronger? More handsome? 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I think I might have gotten shorter because I got a new haircut." 
</P>
<P>
There were no close shaves against Motta. Chang saved seven break points in the 
first set, came back from 1-4 to win the second set and breezed in the third. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really think if I was going to win or lose," Chang said. "I just went 
out there and played. That's what I needed to do." 
</P>
<P>
Some played better than others on the first day. Andre Agassi played worse than 
Canadian Martin Wostenholme for a while, then better. 
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded and No. 5-ranked Agassi was frustrated by his inconsistency. 
He beat Wostenholme, ranked No. 122, 4-6, 7-6 (10-8), 6-0, 6-1, but seemed 
dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
He was erratic, even by his own standards. Agassi reached the second round, but 
not before he: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Broke his racket and received a warning from chair umpire Sultan Gangji. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Served underhanded once. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tried to hit Wostenholme with a ball and was heard cursing on several 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
Said Wostenholme: "I guess he's good for tennis because he brings a lot of 
controversy to the game." 
</P>
<P>
At least Agassi brought a lot of people to the interview room, setting the 
unofficial French Open record with five -- brother, agent, coach, bodyguard, 
hitting partner. 
</P>
<P>
Yannick Noah, the 1983 French Open champion, needed five sets and seven match 
points to defeat 21-year-old qualifier Francisco Roig of Spain, 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 
1-6, 7-5. Noah ended a streak of six consecutive first-match losses. 
</P>
<P>
Emilio Sanchez of Spain, seeded sixth and ranked eighth, was upset by 
19-year-old Swedish qualifier Nicklas Kulti, ranked No. 175. Sanchez lost, 4-6, 
6-4, 6-7 (7-5), 6-2, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Steffi Graf needed only 40 minutes to defeat Pascale Paradis of 
France, 6-0, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, Graf gave her assessment: "It wasn't the hardest match." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Graf's only difficulty seems to be scheduling her outings. "There are 
so many interesting old buildings, museums," she said. "It's like New York 
where you can do things at any time of the day, especially if you stay close to 
the Champs Elysees." 
</P>
<P>
Fifth-seeded Zina Garrison has time to tour, if she wishes. Garrison was the 
first upset victim, losing to Wiltrud Probst of West Germany, 6-1, 1-6, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison, who blew a match point at 5-4, 40-30, said she felt ill at ease 
playing at 11 a.m. in the first match of the day. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a morning person," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Nor, apparently, is David Wheaton, the 20-year-old U.S. clay court champion who 
reached the quarterfinals of the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
Wheaton blew four match points and lost to Milan Srjeber of Czechoslovakia in a 
first-round match that went totally downhill, 3-6, 5-7, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a strange match," Wheaton said. "What can I say? What can I do now? Go 
out and play the fourth set over?" 
</P>
<P>
Jay Berger lost, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2, to Alberto Mancini of Argentina and does not 
want to go out and play even a first set for a month. For the ninth-seeded 
Berger, ranked No. 12 in the world, it was the 17th event in the last 18 weeks, 
a schedule that took its toll. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Courier, seeded 13th, will play Srjeber after beating Jose Altur of Spain, 
6-1, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. Courier, who played a special event in Dusseldorf that 
ended Sunday, asked to play Monday so he could avoid playing back-to-back 
Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Courier drew the 22-year-old Altur, ranked No. 101. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what he looked like until I walked on the court," Courier said.

RILEY STILL CONSIDERING OPTIONS; DECISION AT LEAST A WEEK AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Pat Riley said Monday it will be at least another week before he decides 
whether he will return as the Lakers' coach. He also denied speculation that, 
because of reported player unrest, Laker management is trying to force him into 
accepting a front-office position. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he will meet with Jerry Buss, the Laker owner, again this week, and 
he said he has yet to talk with NBC about a television commentator's job, 
though he plans to explore that option. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Laker coaching job is still his if he wants it, Riley said: 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, it is. Everybody is trying to create some scenario and hypothesize about 
what hasn't happened yet. The team had a great season, and we were upset in the 
playoffs. Everybody just needs a couple of weeks to cool off." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he has not been given a deadline to decide by Jerry West, the Laker 
general manager. He said talks with West and Buss have been "amenable." 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a meeting of the (Laker) minds, but the media is trying to 
speed up the process," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
West, however, said last week he would like Riley to decide soon so that the 
team could proceed with personnel changes. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Jerry that what I'm going to do is in the club's best interest," Riley 
said. "I know there are plans to be made, but everybody needs time." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he will be in New York this week for "a number of things, including 
visiting my mother." He said no meeting with NBC is planned.

UCLA'S DRIVE TO TITLE IS OVERNIGHT SUCCESS

Heather Compton had to wait a day to resume pitching UCLA to its third 
consecutive NCAA women's College World Series championship. But she didn't let 
it bother her. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no hesitation," Compton said after UCLA defeated Frenso State, 2-0, 
Monday. "You get really nervous. You have to turn that nervousness into 
excitement, and I tried to go out there and do my best." 
</P>
<P>
Compton and UCLA led, 1-0, after 2 1/2 innings of play Sunday, but the game was 
postponed because of rain. She finished a one-hit, five-strikeout performance 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Sharron Backus said it was difficult to determine what effect, if 
any, the delay had on her team. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say. We were extremely tired. I got a couple of hours of sleep," 
Backus said. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know which team was going to wake up this morning, or whether Fresno 
was going to come in and take it away." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins (62-6) scored in the first inning on two singles and a wild pitch 
and in the third on two singles and a sacrifice.

The Bruins have won six of the last eight NCAA titles, but Fresno State Coach

"The only dynasty they have is in their own heads," she said. "When the other 
teams believe they can start the same thing, then they can do it. I thought 
this year was the year someone would do that. I think other teams allow that to 
happen."

THIS AGENT AVOIDS STING OF DEFEAT; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: FBI'S UNDERCOVER HORSE PAYS HIS OWN WAY DURING INVESTIGATION 
OF RACE-FIXING AT FINGER LAKES.

BUFFALO, N.Y.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An undercover horse the FBI used in an investigation of race-fixing at Finger 
Lakes Race Track won at least one race and finished strongly in others, much to 
the surprise of the agents. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI bought the horse thinking it would perform badly and could become 
involved in a fixed-race scheme. But the horse ran consistently well during the 
1989 racing season, Special Agent Dale Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can say he won at least one race and placed in about half of his races. The 
FBI did quite well with him. The bureau made enough money to offset the costs 
of upkeep," about $1,000 a month, Anderson told the Buffalo News. 
</P>
<P>
A jockey, two trainers and a trainer's wife face possible indictment in 
connection with a Sept. 26 race at the track in Canandaigua, about 20 miles 
southeast of Rochester. That race allegedly was fixed, but FBI agents said the 
alleged scheme was not related to their main investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI's horse was not running in the suspect race, nor were agents 
specifically watching the four persons who were arrested, Anderson said. U.S. 
Attorney Dennis C. Vacco said track officials and state regulators noticed 
jockey Joseph Badamo was riding his horse irregularly during the race. 
</P>
<P>
G. Robert Langford, special agent in charge of the Buffalo office, said the 
investigation left the FBI with the impression that few races are fixed at 
Finger Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI bought the horse for less than $5,000 and ran it at the track to 
introduce an undercover agent to the work and social circles of those targeted 
in the investigation. The FBI agent played the part of a shady trainer and 
horse owner, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Agents considered naming the horse after FBI Director William Sessions and 
having it run under the FBI's colors, but those ideas were quickly scrapped. 
The horse's name, age and sex are still being kept secret to protect the 
identities of those involved with the case. 
</P>
<P>
Now owned privately and still racing, the FBI's horse has put its law 
enforcement career behind it. 
</P>
<P>
"We wish him well. He served as a real good representative of the bureau," 
Anderson said.

EXPERTS DEBATE SAFETY, WORTH OF LIQUID DIETS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: MANUFACTURERS OF VERY-LOW-CALORIE DIETS AND THEIR CRITICS AGREE THAT 
THE DIETS CAN BE DANGEROUS IF NOT PROPERLY MONITORED. BUT THEY DISAGREE ON WHO 
SHOULD USE THEM. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Liquid diets -- which grew up quietly in the past decade as hospital treatment 
for the seriously obese and exploded in popularity in the late 1980s -- might 
be losing some of their luster. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers of such diet plans as Optifast, Health Management Resources and 
the over-the-counter protein drink, Slim-Fast, report a downturn in popularity 
after a year of soaring sales just as some lawmakers and health experts 
initiate public inquiries into the safety and effectiveness of the programs. 
Manufacturers, saying there is no clear explanation for the drop in business, 
say safety problems have not caused the decline. 
</P>
<P>
But critics contend that although today's liquid diets are much improved from 
the diet plans in the late 1970s that led to 60 deaths, even the modern diets 
have significant potential for misuse. 
</P>
<P>
They say that very-low-calorie diets, or VLCDs, which usually take the form of 
protein drinks, are often prescribed by physicians who are untrained in their 
use and are frequently marketed to people who aren't seriously overweight. They 
also charge that over-the-counter protein drinks might be misused, leading to 
severe health consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of VLCDs, which include the directors of about 1,000 hospital-based 
programs, say the diets are safe when supervised by a physician and a team of 
nutritionists and behavior therapists. They say the diets have become an 
important tool in the treatment of obesity and that regular exercise and 
behavioral modification to teach the patient new eating habits often ensures 
moderate success. 
</P>
<P>
In hearings before a House subcommittee earlier this month, health experts had 
plenty of criticism for many diet programs (including those that use 
prepackaged food), but urged special caution over liquid protein diets. 
</P>
<P>
The diet business, which caters to at least 20% of U.S. adults at any given 
time, is out of control "with too many diet programs losing the balance between 
patient safety and making a profit," said Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who chaired 
the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"The worrisome trend is away from exercise and toward liquid protein diets, 
virtually all of them sponsored by physicians and hospitals, and so-called 
'fast diets,' which ignore nutritional safety," Wyden said. 
</P>
<P>
He cited a commentary in the Jan. 5 issue of the Journal of the American 
Medical Assn. as a summary of the problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Current very-low-calorie diets that provide essential nutrients and 
high-quality proteins are unquestionably safer than their liquid-protein 
predecessors," wrote Thomas Wadden, a psychologist and obesity therapist at 
University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, and two co-authors. "But the 
recent and zealous marketing of various formula products to physicians, as well 
as the public's appetite for such diets, could lead to yet another round of 
complications and fatalities." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Vincent Felliti, director of preventive medicine at Kaiser Permanente 
Medical Group in San Diego, said he has studied thousands of patients in the 
center's Optifast program and has found minimal danger and a substantial rate 
of success. 
</P>
<P>
Optifast, which became a sensation in 1988 when Oprah Winfrey announced she had 
dropped 67 pounds on the diet, and the HMR program compose 85% of the 
very-low-calorie-diet market, said a spokeswoman for the Boston-based HMR. But 
at least one dozen different liquid protein diets are offered through 
physicians' practices and hospitals, Wyden's committee reported. 
</P>
<P>
Long-term studies on the effectiveness of the diets is scarce. But Felliti's 
study of 2,200 Optifast patients showed that of those who complete the entire 
program, including behavior modification, 60% maintained two-thirds of their 
weight loss after 18 months. That figure is widely quoted within the industry. 
Winfrey says she has gained back 17 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Taking weight off a person is a relatively safe process," said Felliti. "What 
was inconceivable a decade ago can be done reliably and routinely now." 
</P>
<P>
In general, physician-monitored VLCDs involve consuming a liquid protein drink 
made of milk or egg for about 12 to 16 weeks, followed by a period of 
reintroducing normal foods and a long-term maintenance program to learn new 
eating habits, said Dr. Jack E. Rubin, associate director of the Health 
Development Institute at Century City Hospital, which operates a 
very-low-calorie diet called Therafast. 
</P>
<P>
During the fasting phase, patients consume about 400 to 800 calories a day 
along with vitamin and mineral supplements and undergo regular blood and urine 
tests to monitor for adverse reactions to the fast, which manufacturers of the 
diets say are rare. The diets are called "protein sparing" because they are 
designed to allow the dieter to lose fat instead of protein. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically very-low-calorie diets are designed for people 30 to 40 pounds 
overweight at the very least," Rubin said. "Somebody who has 10 to 15 pounds to 
lose won't lose that much weight (because) they don't have that much fat to 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
And, he said: "These liquid diets are designed to be combined with behavior 
modification so that the patient can learn new techniques and avoid old ones 
that got them into trouble in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Friend learned his lesson well. The Los Angeles man, 28, went on 
Optifast one year ago weighing 307 pounds and has lost 113 pounds. Friend still 
attends a weekly support group to maintain his weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a struggle," Friend said. "But I've introduced exercise into my life. And 
the program has educated me about what I can eat. I like the fact that it was 
supervised by a doctor." 
</P>
<P>
But hospital and physician sponsorship is a cloak that may obscure the risks of 
very-low-calorie diets, say critics like Wadden. 
</P>
<P>
According to Wadden, very-low-calorie diets are ripe for misuse due to: 
</P>
<P>
* Consumption of the diets by people who are not severely overweight (less than 
30% overweight) and who may be more at risk for serious side effects from 
fasting. Wadden also says the diets are less successful among those with 
moderate weight problems. 
</P>
<P>
* Prescription of the diets by physicians untrained in their use. 
</P>
<P>
Criticism that physicians who manage the diet programs need better training has 
rankled many in the field. Programs like Optifast and HMR say they require a 
multi-day physician training course that is adequate to ensure safety. But 
Wadden and others say that the complex nature of weight loss requires that 
physicians have more in-depth training. 
</P>
<P>
"The training varies enormously," Wadden said. "Some (programs) say, 'yes, we 
train them,' and that means sending them audio cassettes." 
</P>
<P>
The training courses offered by the manufacturers are inadequate to prepare a 
general physician to spot the rare, but life-threatening, complications that 
can arise when the body is subject to a fast, said Dr. C. Wayne Callaway, an 
endocrinologist and diet-book author at George Washington University and a key 
critic at the Wyden hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Callaway, who represented the American Board of Nutrition at the hearings, said 
the complications include irregular heartbeat, fatigue, anemia, depression and 
gastrointestinal disturbances. Less serious side effects associated with the 
diets include temporary hair loss, dizziness, dry skin and bad breath. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a totally innocuous procedure," Callaway said. "It's hazardous to 
venture a guess on these things, but I believe very few of them have 
appropriate training, such as endocrine training and nutrition training. A 
two-day course is not long enough if you're dealing with a substantial risk." 
</P>
<P>
Wadden and Callaway claim that people are dying from the diets but that the 
incidents are difficult to pinpoint because they might be blamed on something 
else, such as a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that people probably die on these diets all the time," Wadden said. 
"The problem is determining whether the fatality was attributable to other 
problems or to the diet." 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturers of the VLCDs angrily deny safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jim Parsons, executive director of Optifast, manufacturers 
recognize the paucity of training for physicians in the treatment of obesity 
and are working with the American Medical Assn. to try and establish improved 
medical-school training and post-graduate courses in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Further, he said, Sandoz Nutrition, the manufacturer of Optifast, would like 
the physicians offering the product to be specialized in the field of obesity 
treatment, as opposed to operating a more generalized practice. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like them to be established as obesity experts," Parsons said. "But 
obesity as a disease is not even recognized as such. It's in its infancy. So 
you can't really blame the medical schools for not addressing it. It doesn't 
mean a physician shouldn't be involved, and it doesn't mean he can't safely 
administer the program." 
</P>
<P>
Little evidence exists that the diets are unsafe. A recent study at the 
University of Southern California found that people on a 650-calorie-a-day 
liquid diet had no serious physiological changes that would appear to make the 
diet unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
But, some slight changes seen in blood and urine indicate that fasting is a 
complex process and that patients should be monitored closely, says Dr. Ken 
Fujioka, director of the USC study. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree that (physicians) should look at the patient's lab values," he said. 
"A lot of physicians aren't trained in this but are doing it." 
</P>
<P>
The effects of fasting may be even more severe for an individual with less 
weight to lose, said Wadden, who claims some VLCDs are being offered to people 
without significant weight problems. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an alarming practice because the vast majority of studies 
demonstrating the safety of very-low-calorie diets have examined their effects 
only in severely obese individuals, typically 50% or more overweight," Wadden 
said in the JAMA article. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers with only a minimal amount of weight to lose like the programs 
because weight loss is rapid -- three to four pounds a week as opposed to one 
or two pounds a week on non-fasting diets, he said. But Wadden said the diet 
might prove to be "particularly hazardous" to people less overweight. 
</P>
<P>
Mildly overweight people lose more lean body mass than do the very obese, he 
said. Loss of lean mass can cause cardiac function disturbances and damage to 
other organs. Severely obese can somewhat protect against that because of their 
large fat stores and other physiological characteristics, Wadden said. 
</P>
<P>
Both the manufacturers of very-low-calorie diets and their critics agree that 
the diets can be dangerous if they are not monitored by a physician. Some 
operators of physician-monitored programs says the misuse of over-the-counter 
liquid diet products could prove disastrous for the entire field of obesity 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers of the over-the-counter diets caution individuals to eat one full 
meal a day. But unsupervised dieters might restrict their consumption of 
regular foods to a dangerous level and even use protein drinks exclusively, 
leading to complications, Wadden said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials for the over-the-counter product Slim-Fast, which advises dieters to 
drink two protein shakes a day along with one balanced meal, say the product is 
not intended to mimic the physician-monitored diets. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a very-low-calorie diets which should be monitored weekly by a 
doctor," said Jean Elliott, a spokeswoman for the Thompson Medical Co., which 
makes Slim-Fast. "We are not that program. We are a moderately low-calorie 
diet, about 1,200 calories, the majority of the calories come from food. We are 
designed for the moderately overweight person who wants to drop a few pounds. 
You can misuse anything. But it is not designed to be your sole nutrition. We 
need to make that distinction." 
</P>
<P>
Much less costly than the hospital-run programs -- which average about $3,000 
-- Slim-Fast sales soared from $10 million in 1988 to $20 million last year, 
Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of the industry is another reason it should be regulated, say 
Wadden and Callaway. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see (regulations) that anyone who puts a diet on the market 
has to be able to show the safety," Wadden said. "The second thing is to show 
long-term effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now there are no regulations whatsoever. I think the Food and Drug 
Administration considers these diets to be food, and there is nothing 
inherently dangerous about the diets just as there is nothing inherently 
dangerous about bread. The danger comes in how the diets are used." 
</P>
<P>
During the hearings earlier this month, Wyden threatened government 
intervention unless some of the safety issues can be clarified. 
</P>
<P>
But the controversy might overshadow the potential of the diets to help people 
who have a serious medical need to lose weight, said Anne McGrath, a 
spokeswoman for the HMR diet. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great that hearings are going on and a lot of information is 
getting out," she said. "If it helps alert people to any frauds or products 
where they are wasting their money, that's good. But the downside risk is 
people throw up their hands and say why should I try any weight program if it 
isn't going to work."

GRIEF, GREED AND THE LAWYERS; 
</P>
<P>
AFTERMATH: THE SCHOOL BUS TRAGEDY WAS JUST THE BEGINNING. THEN LAWYERS MOVED IN 
AND DIVIDED A TEXAS TOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
ALTON, Tex. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First, the tragedy. Then life's seamier side crept into this impoverished dot 
of a town on the Texas border. Enter the ambulance-chasers. 
</P>
<P>
This was the site of one of the worst school bus crashes in history. As a 
bright yellow bus, packed with about 80 students, was making its way to the 
nearby town of Mission last September, it was hit by a soft drink truck and 
plunged into a water-filled gravel pit. Twenty-one students were killed and 
dozens more were injured. 
</P>
<P>
As news of the accident spread across the lower Rio Valley, residents raced to 
lend a hand. 
</P>
<P>
"The day of (the accident) and immediately afterward was the community at its 
best," said Paul Rodriguez, a local bank president. "It was an incredible 
outpouring." 
</P>
<P>
But for one thing. Rene Guerra, the Hidalgo County district attorney, said 
something disturbed him about the bystanders on that terrible morning: a great 
many of them were lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to myself, 'Some of those guys are not here as onlookers,' " Guerra 
recalled in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Guerra had reason to worry. The litigation was almost certain to be very 
lucrative: The owner of the truck was Coca-Cola, a company that is almost the 
definition of deep pockets. 
</P>
<P>
As time went on, there would be stories of lawyers trying to sign up clients at 
funeral homes. There would be other stories of letters of condolence being sent 
to bereaved parents, along with a business card and a contract for them to 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the poorest regions of the nation, the smell of money, big money, 
came wafting over the land. Even some of the rescue workers -- including police 
officers and volunteer firefighters -- joined in the suit against Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the straw that broke the camel's back," said Rodriguez, referring to 
the growing disgust in the community over the plethora of lawsuits being filed. 
</P>
<P>
It broke the fire department as well. A melee broke out recently between 
volunteer firefighters who had joined the suit and those who had not. The Alton 
fire chief responded by disbanding the force. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday 16 of the 21 wrongful death suits were settled for $4.5 million 
each. One other settlement was reached some months ago and four more are still 
being negotiated. And the image of a community that gave of itself has been 
lost in the flurry of lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere is redolent with charges that lawyers violated their own code of 
ethics -- and state law -- in their efforts to sign up clients. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Guerra has charged five people -- four of them lawyers -- with 
"barratry," the legal term for ambulance-chasing, and said other lawyers may be 
charged with the misdemeanor later. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to find few people with clean hands in this mess," said Aaron 
Pena, a lawyer defending two community workers in a slander suit stemming from 
their accusation that another attorney had committed barratry. 
</P>
<P>
As a measure of what a litigious battlefield Alton has become, the community 
workers, in turn, filed a slander suit against the lawyer suing them. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is sue-happy," said Guerra. 
</P>
<P>
The bus went over the edge of the pit and into the water at 7:40 a.m. As word 
spread, the heartbreaking scene of parents learning their children were dead 
was repeated over and over. 
</P>
<P>
One mother had to be taken by ambulance from the crash site after she saw the 
bodies of her two teen-age daughters being pulled from the bus. Another blamed 
herself because she had insisted her son go to school that morning. 
</P>
<P>
At the local school, two lists of students were compiled: one for the living, 
the other for the dead. 
</P>
<P>
And almost immediately, the lawyers' contest began. The object was to get the 
parents of the dead and injured to sign on the dotted line of a contract. 
</P>
<P>
Community leaders are quick to point out that not all lawyers were 
ambulance-chasers. Nevertheless, Mauro Reyna III, one of the lawyers charged 
with barratry, says his office was deluged with calls in the aftermath of the 
bus crash, all of them lawyers looking for a piece of the action. 
</P>
<P>
"There were guys from New York to California trying to run these cases," said 
Reyna, who has pleaded innocent to the charge. ("Running a case" is lawyerly 
parlance for stealing a client.) 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of days later, we started hearing about lawyers at wakes and lawyers 
at funeral homes," said Guerra. "Some lawyers have the attitude of 'If I become 
a millionaire, I don't care if they take my license.' I think that is the 
unfortunate attitude we have now." 
</P>
<P>
Several days after the accident, Ruben Sandoval of San Antonio arrived on the 
scene as staff lawyer for the League of United Latin American Citizens. With 
110,000 members, it is the largest and oldest Latino organization in the United 
States, but also one beset by internal bickering. With him was Jose Garcia de 
Lara, the national president. 
</P>
<P>
If Sandoval is to be believed, the two men were there as do-gooders, to warn 
people about lawyers who are sharks, who will charge a huge percentage of suit 
settlements and actually do little work. The grand jury, however, later 
concluded there was evidence Sandoval had his own reasons for being there: to 
solicit business, and that he was a shark himself. 
</P>
<P>
Sandoval knows how to grab headlines. He has taken on, and won, his share of 
civil rights lawsuits. One San Antonio lawyer called him "the most courageous 
lawyer I know who takes on cases that others wouldn't." Another prominent 
lawyer, however, called him a "lawyer of modest ability" who farms out his 
cases to other lawyers in exchange for 50% of the fees. 
</P>
<P>
Sandoval and de Lara made a fairly big splash when they went to the valley. 
They warned of unscrupulous lawyers and asked where the money was that had been 
pouring in from all over the country for the families of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
At this juncture, the story takes two paths. 
</P>
<P>
In Sandoval's version, he took on a case after returning to San Antonio, but 
only after taking extraordinary measures to ensure he was above reproach every 
step of the way. His client, Carmen Cruz, whose daughter was killed in the bus 
accident, says he did nothing wrong; other family members say the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
The other version, provided by two regional LULAC officials, is that Sandoval 
came to the valley with the express intent of soliciting cases almost certain 
to make him a millionaire. One of the workers, Noe Torres, said Sandoval asked 
him point blank to help him sign up cases, something Sandoval vehemently 
denies. 
</P>
<P>
Sandoval contends that many local lawyers were intent only on lining their own 
pockets, and that they went to great lengths to prevent him and other 
non-valley practitioners from signing clients. 
</P>
<P>
As proof, he offered tape recordings of conversations that he said he had with 
local lawyer Mark Cantu. The talks occurred as Sandoval and another lawyer, 
James Perkins, were taking over the Cruz case from Cantu. 
</P>
<P>
In one conversation, the voice purported to be Cantu's said he would fight to 
keep the Cruz contract and would seek to have Sandoval indicted for barratry. 
"You're outgunned over here," the taped voice said. "You're in our country 
here." Cantu could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
So it goes in the valley, where there have been more suits and threats of 
others. The one that still rankles the community most was the suit filed by the 
rescue workers. 
</P>
<P>
In a suit filed last March, one policeman and seven volunteer firemen sued the 
soft drink company, claiming that negligence on the part of Coca-Cola has led 
to their suffering injuries, pain, loss of physical capacity and loss of 
earning power. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteer fireman Jose Gerardo Solis alleged that he was damaged as he swam to 
the bus, administered first aid to injured students and helped them to shore. 
He then dived into the bus and helped pull out those who were trapped there. 
</P>
<P>
"All have had a variety of psychological problems," said their lawyer, Steve 
Hastings of Corpus Christi. He said all knew families of the dead children and 
that they had been treated for illnesses caused by the filthy water in the pit. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings said two of the original 10 plaintiffs -- both policemen -- had 
withdrawn from the suit after being threatened with the loss of their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Alton Police Chief Javier Guerrero denied there was any threat to the two, but 
said he did point out to them that their case was somewhat weak, since one 
didn't arrive at the scene until mid-afternoon and the other's role had been 
serving Gatorade to rescuers. 
</P>
<P>
"They decided to drop it themselves," said Guerrero. 
</P>
<P>
And what of Ruben Perez, the truck driver, the young man who is the only one in 
all this to face criminal charges? 
</P>
<P>
"He's become kind of a background issue," said Rodriguez, the bank president. 
Guerra, the district attorney, agrees. "We have sort of forgotten about the 
criminal case," he said. "If you asked when we were going to court with the 
truck driver, I couldn't tell you."

A NEW ENVIRONMENT FOR POLITE BEHAVIOR; 
</P>
<P>
ETIQUETTE: LETITIA BALDRIGE SAYS THE AIM IN EVERYDAY SITUATIONS IS TO TEACH 
MANNERS WITHOUT ENDING UP IN FISTICUFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There is something new to worry about: being ecologically correct. But how do 
you get your message across in polite company without being confrontational? 
</P>
<P>
Letitia Baldrige, manners adviser to five first ladies and author of "The New 
Manners for the '90s" (Rawson, $24.95), recognizes the dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
"When somebody throws something out the car window, honk at them, but don't 
give them the finger," Baldrige says. "We've got to temper our negative 
feelings about people who desecrate the environment." 
</P>
<P>
As far as people dropping trash on the street, "I do believe in picking it up 
and saying, 'Oh, I think you dropped this,' " she says. "A lot of people do 
that now, politely and nicely, and I think it's very effective." 
</P>
<P>
Baldrige hopes the 1980s atmosphere of "acquire, possess and have the right to 
do whatever I want" is gone. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of societal problems that we have to fix in the 1990s," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think the young people are aware of this for the first time. The young 
were so apathetic in the late '70s and '80s. There was no campus activism. But 
now they're excited about many issues, and the environment is one of them." 
</P>
<P>
Some young friends of Baldrige got a chance to use written communication during 
a camping trip. 
</P>
<P>
The people in the camper next to them had departed early in the morning, 
leaving behind their trash and garbage. Her friends cleaned the campsite. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, they spotted the camper, but not the occupants. They wrote a long 
letter and left it on the windshield, explaining that they had stopped at the 
campsite and saw how messy it had been left. 
</P>
<P>
They wrote: "We know it wasn't your intention to ruin the environment or make 
it impossible for all the other campers to enjoy it. But we cleaned up your 
mess, and we want you to know we helped you out. And we know you'll do the same 
thing for somebody else some day." 
</P>
<P>
Baldrige says: "Now that's effective, and probably made those people stop and 
think." 
</P>
<P>
Aural pollution is another kind of pollution that bothers Baldrige. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you the number of times that I've been on a city street or in an 
elevator, and young women will use four-letter words and all kinds of foul 
language," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"I stop them, put my hand on their arm and say, 'I have something to tell you. 
I'm old enough to be your grandmother. You're young and beautiful, and you've 
got the whole world ahead of you, but you have no idea what that polluting 
language does to change my perception and everybody else's perception of you.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Baldrige believes in the courage of her convictions. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to speak up; you really do," she says. "But the point of all this is 
not to get into a confrontation but to convince instead. I believe in teaching 
manners without causing fisticuffs." 
</P>
<P>
If your style is caustic, Baldrige says, the message is lost. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing we can do to save the planet is set a good example for our kids 
at home," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"Revive that old tradition of napkin rings and cloth napkins and cut down on 
paper use. Give presents to new mothers of a diaper service. Recycle." 
</P>
<P>
But if you are visiting your parents, and they are not recycling, think before 
you speak. 
</P>
<P>
"Each community has different rules about this. If there isn't a setup for 
recycling, don't take this out on your parents," Baldrige says. "Instead, find 
out where to take the bottles and offer to do that for them. Show them; don't 
tell them." 
</P>
<P>
She believes that the family dinner table is a place to slip in some 
environmental messages. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't abuse drugs or alcohol in front of your kids -- or at all, for that 
matter," she says. "They will do as you do, not as you say." 
</P>
<P>
But a social dinner is not the place to be preaching. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great rudeness to give a lecture or to reject somebody else's food," 
she says. "There's such a lack of good dinner conversation that it's not the 
time to turn it into a soapbox." 
</P>
<P>
If you have decided to be a vegetarian, let the host know ahead of time. Often, 
there will be plenty of items that you can eat. 
</P>
<P>
Smoking can be another sore point. "I make it easy for my smoking friends by 
setting up a place on the patio for them," she says. "But they know not to 
smoke in the house." 
</P>
<P>
Her attitude certainly has shifted from dinner parties of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to go around polishing the sterling-silver cigarette holders and 
putting out matchboxes and silver ashtrays; I spent hours getting the smoking 
accessories ready," she says. "Now I think the only people left who smoke are 
nicotine addicts." 
</P>
<P>
Baldrige is not a smoker, "but I learned to smoke at Vassar so I could look 
like Lauren Bacall, cool and sophisticated. What's sad is some girls, at age 
11, are still picking up the habit for the same reasons I did." 
</P>
<P>
One final pollution area Baldrige would like to tackle is movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"They may smoke in Irish movie theaters, which is certainly a fire hazard, but 
we Americans leave all kinds of trash behind, plus we're always spilling sticky 
soda and throwing chewing gum on the floor," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I could make a lot of money selling recyclable plastic booties you 
could buy to save your shoes."

LIMA'S STREETS ARE BOTH MEAN AND VIBRANT; 
</P>
<P>
SIGHTS, SOUNDS, SMELLS -- A WALK DOWNTOWN, WHERE WELL-TO-DO PERUVIANS SELDOM 
GO, IS AN UNFORGETTABLE ASSAULT ON THE SENSES. JUST WATCH YOUR WALLET.

LIMA, Peru 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the first stoplight, Lima engulfs you: Dozens of vendors sprint to the car, 
proffering plastic bags of drinkable water, toilet paper, electrical plugs and 
Band-Aids, sold one by one. Aromas from chicken grilling on the sidewalks and 
pungently sauteed raw fish compete with the hawkers' chants and honking horns 
for the attention of your nose and ears. 
</P>
<P>
A stroll through downtown Lima is a riotous assault on the senses, and not 
least the eyes: a rainbow of faces, garments and wares that add up to pure 
capitalism run amok, but with its own zany order and a vibrance that often 
seems missing from the other, aristocratic Peru. 
</P>
<P>
Many well-to-do Peruvians avoid the trip these days, and increasingly 
foreigners spend their time in the five-star suburban hotels, venturing into 
Lima only on tour buses. The reputation of the mean streets of Lima is 
sometimes justified. But if you leave your passport, wallet, watches, rings and 
necklaces behind, you can still breathe and feel late-20th-Century Peru. 
</P>
<P>
The Via Expresa, a sunken four-mile-long highway that is one of Peru's few 
decent roads, is the concrete canal between the two lives that coexist in Lima. 
</P>
<P>
The road carries you inland from the new American-style suburbs of Miraflores 
and San Isidro, with their shopping malls and walled-in modern houses, and 
dumps you into a throbbing square in front of the Sheraton Hotel, right into 
the convulsed heart of the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
The City of Kings, conquistador Francisco Pizarro called it when he founded 
Lima in 1535. You have to scratch hard now to find remnants of that imperial 
heritage. 
</P>
<P>
On both sides of the square, money-changers flashing pocket calculators trot 
alongside the cars, shouting the latest exchange rate and waving wads of 
dollars and the shrunken Peruvian currency, the inti. Some drivers stop; other 
customers, wary of being robbed, make their deals on the move. 
</P>
<P>
Food stalls line the edge of the square, selling ceviche, the traditional dish 
of raw seafood steeped in lemon juice, and chicha, a rich purple beverage made 
from corn. Ice-cream sellers toot kazoo-style horns, Lima's ubiquitous, profane 
equivalent of the muezzins of the Muslim world. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people line up and wait stoically on street corners for either 
government buses or colectivos, the private buses that have largely supplanted 
the abject state transport system. 
</P>
<P>
As the state has disintegrated in Peru in recent years, people have been left 
to their own ingenuity. The city, grown from just over 1 million in 1950 to 
more than 6 million today, is a testament to its people's capacity to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Especially in and around the regal Plaza de Armas and the elegant Plaza San 
Martin, the city's two finest squares, the new Lima washes over you. 
</P>
<P>
The smells are as powerful as the visual assault of the tumult. Chunks of 
broiled chicken and beef send up a barbecue aroma on some blocks, a welcome 
change from the garbage stench pervading many of Lima's poorer areas on the 
city's outskirts. The sounds, too: An ancient man and his wife, wearing Andean 
fedoras and ponchos, play melancholy mountain folk tunes on reed pipes. A 
hawker enchants with his sung praises for the medicinal qualities of a gooey 
resin from a cactus plant. 
</P>
<P>
The descendants of the white colonial settlers have fled to the coast, 
abandoning downtown to the millions of brown-skinned highlanders who have 
spilled down from the villages of the Andes Mountains, victims of guerrilla war 
and decades of neglect. The fine old mansions are coated with soot from the 
traffic. Many now are crowded tenements, home to a dozen families. 
</P>
<P>
But this new life is found not so much within Lima's still-handsome buildings 
as on its streets and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
Since it never rains on this desert coast, the climate suits a streetside 
lifestyle. With a bureaucracy still rooted in Peru's Spanish past, the new 
Limenos have little chance anyway to move off the streets and into the 
mainstream economy. 
</P>
<P>
So the main avenues have evolved into color-splashed bazaars of hawkers 
offering all of life's necessities, tax free, and many of its pleasures. The 
government occasionally tries to sweep the streets clean of vendors, but 
strength of numbers prevails. Nowhere else in Latin America has there emerged 
such a sophisticated parallel economy, with its own chaotic hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
On the bottom rung are those ambulantes, as the peddlers are called, who sell 
only what they can carry. One vendor, bedecked with dozens of leather handbags, 
resembles a movable Christmas tree. Others tote a few shirts or cans of shoe 
polish. They sidle away if the police get testy (or seek a "fee"). 
</P>
<P>
Higher up the ladder of ambulante well-being are those with bicycle carts, 
enormous flatbed contraptions that can convey an entire fruit stand or magazine 
rack to a chosen site, and later to an informal parking lot when the day is 
done. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the full-fledged stores-on-the-sidewalk that have taken over 
every major avenue in the traffic-choked, square-mile heart of the old city. 
Block after block, these table stands pack both edges of the sidewalks, leaving 
only a narrow path for jostling pedestrians and browsers. 
</P>
<P>
The forced intimacy makes for ideal conditions for pickpockets in Lima. Packs 
of "piranhas," groups of street children as young as 7 or 8, roam and set upon 
strollers in some sections. 
</P>
<P>
Like any sensible person venturing into downtown Lima, you will leave wallet, 
watch, passport and dollars in your hotel, carrying nothing you cannot afford 
to lose. Lima's reputation has grown so bad that gringos rarely meander the 
streets any more. A pity. This walk lets you experience what Lima has become. 
</P>
<P>
Jiron Lampa, one of the major avenues, reveals the sophistication of the 
vibrant "informal" world. This is the hardware district. You can buy all you 
need to build and outfit a house. 
</P>
<P>
Stall owners offering seemingly identical stock sit idly on stools awaiting 
buyers. Electric plugs, wire, circuit breakers, copper tubing, locks, window 
frames, toilets and, yes, kitchen sinks. 
</P>
<P>
In another section, whole streets are filled with stalls selling watches, with 
watchsmiths installing new batteries and making repairs on the sidewalk. 
Elsewhere the specialty is sneakers; further on, it's used books. 
</P>
<P>
Near the government buildings, men sit behind ancient manual typewriters on 
impromptu desks, ready to type out a bureaucratically correct document for any 
formality. They are more than mere outdoor typists, since they know the 
intricacies of the moribund state and the demands of its clerks. 
</P>
<P>
The merchants in the established shops along the streets ought to be furious at 
this invasion of vendors selling goods at far below the retail cost, paying no 
taxes or rent (beyond protection money to the informal organizations that 
maintain a modicum of order). 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the street merchants often are hawking the same stuff as that being 
sold legally indoors across the sidewalk. Some merchants have consigned stock 
to the vendors for street sale in return for a cut, expanding their retail 
reach and avoiding taxes in the process. 
</P>
<P>
The street life is one reason why Peru's tax intake has plummeted from 20% or 
so of the gross domestic product a few years ago to about 4% now, further 
weakening the state. Of course, hyperinflation of 30% to 40% per month hasn't 
helped either. The informal sector accounts for nearly half of all economic 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
The police do try to maintain some order, and when on foot patrol in the 
capital they travel at least in pairs and often in larger groups. One recent 
day, they had reconquered a portion of Jiron de la Union near the Plaza de 
Armas, site of the presidential palace and therefore a security concern. 
Armored water cannon vehicles stood poised at the edge of the square. Police 
wearing riot helmets and bulletproof vests barred all pedestrians from the 
square itself. 
</P>
<P>
Peru's guerrilla war may be largely in the mountains, but it sometimes feels 
very close to downtown Lima. A few dozen blocks away, halftrack vehicles stood 
guard outside a court where a suspected guerrilla chief was being tried. Army 
and police vans filled with men holding AK-47 assault rifles cruised the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
The ambulantes had re-established their foothold higher up the Jiron de la 
Union as police looked on. People had set out scales on the sidewalk (the 
street economy has progressed into services as well as goods) and were offering 
to weigh passers-by for 1,000 intis, now worth about 3 U.S. cents. Three 
policemen weighed themselves. They did not pay, but neither did they shoo the 
scalers away. 
</P>
<P>
Some narrow, heavily trafficked streets have signs with a cross through the 
letter A, and the words No Ambulantes. 
</P>
<P>
The government once attempted to restore order by shifting all the ambulantes 
to a single open-air market a couple of blocks from the Plaza de Armas, called 
Polvos Azules (Blue Dusts). 
</P>
<P>
The block-square market is thriving, but the flood of newcomers has retaken the 
streets. The market's suddenly respectable tenants, meanwhile, have hired 
security guards -- to keep out newer ambulantes who try to wander into the 
alleys selling goods from their hands. 
</P>
<P>
A fair portion of the street life serves others in the street business. Beach 
umbrellas are a big seller, for example -- not for the beach but to provide 
shade for sidewalk stands from the midday sun. 
</P>
<P>
A man sidles up: "You want nice slender young girl?" Getting bumped and jostled 
is also part of the experience; when it happens, check your pockets. 
</P>
<P>
The financial district is informal Lima at its most advanced. It is known as 
Ocona Street (Peruvians use the English "street" rather than calle for this 
one, since it's their Wall Street). 
</P>
<P>
Along a road where exchange houses once flourished indoors, money traders with 
shoulder bags packed with currency make sometimes huge transactions, no doubt 
laundering thousands of dollars of Peru's coca dollars in the process. Some 
money dealers sit on stools under signs saying, "I Buy Damaged Dollars and 
European Currencies." An estimated $5 million changes hands here daily. 
</P>
<P>
Young men use walkie-talkies to stay in touch with the moguls who follow the 
volatile trends of the inti against the dollar. Guards hover around their 
masters, eyes scaling the crowds. This money market is not only for foreign 
exchange but for financing, since loans from banks are vanishing under the 
weight of inflation and impossible interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Ocona Street is closed to traffic, a pedestrian mall of money dealing. 
</P>
<P>
You can still escape, slipping into the splendid, faded Hotel Bolivar on the 
Plaza San Martin, cool and often darkened by Lima's constant blackouts. 
</P>
<P>
From the glassed-in terrace restaurant over a $10 fixed-price lunch, you can 
watch the swirl of Lima from a safe distance. But it's not the same as becoming 
part of the chaos, even if just for a while. 
</P>

Photo, Cuanto? -- "How much?" Broiled meat, ceviche, leather goods, watches, 
shoes -- even the kitchen sink: It's all available in the sidewalk markets of 
downtown Lima. Look long enough through the stalls of the onetime City of 
Kings, and you'll find someone offering all of life's necessities and many of 
its pleasures. VERA A. LENTZ / Black Star

HEBREW AND ARABIC PRESS VIEW ISRAELI KILLINGS WITH DIFFERENT EYES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
JERUSALEM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest surge of violence in Israel was touched off May 20 when a lone 
Israeli gunman shot to death seven Arab workers. When Palestinians took to the 
streets in protest, the violence that ensued left 16 more Arabs killed by 
troops and Jewish settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 All newspapers deplored the killings but differed widely on the cause and 
effect. Israeli commentators pondered the impact of the turmoil on Israel's 
image and tried to explore the ethical and moral issues involved. Opinion in 
the Arab press ranged from outrage to despair, with newspapers pouring a 
measure of blame on the Israeli government for failing to move ahead on peace 
talks and creating an atmosphere of anti-Arab sentiment. A sampling of the 
opinion from both sides: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"The shooting down of seven innocent workers and Arab-Israeli strife are 
unquestionably legitimate news. But when they dwarf all else in a world 
undergoing the most revolutionary changes of the second half of the century, 
when they become the central subject of U.S. presidential pronouncements and 
Washington news conferences, world press headlines and animation in dozens of 
chancelleries around the globe, one is forced to wonder if there is something 
pathological in the world's preoccupation with news about Jews. 
</P>
<P>
"Momentous events resulting from the decline of the Soviet empire; the 
desperate efforts of Eastern European countries to overcome deadly effects of 
40 years of communism and the pernicious heritage of bigotry; the Western 
betrayal of the Baltic countries, reminiscent of the abandonment of Hungary in 
1956; the indifference to China's brutal repression of its democratic movement; 
and the mass exodus, not only of Jews, from the Soviet Union, the largest 
population transfer in Europe since World War II, all take a back seat to 
murder and mayhem of local import in the Holy Land." 
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem Post (English) 
</P>
<P>
"All those who believed the intifada was dying down have been compelled to 
admit that they are mistaken. The masses, who according to the above theory are 
tiring, have now proved the opposite. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli army can re-establish order, but Israel will pay a price for this 
-- a further undermining of Israeli rule in the territories. 
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian population will no longer sit in silence, and they are 
prepared to clash with the army from time to time. This is the principal lesson 
which the military command must learn. Not only them, but the government -- 
every government, including the right-wing government Shamir is presently 
trying to establish -- must understand that Israel is not capable of 
maintaining its hold on the West Bank and Gaza, except with the use of force, 
which will result in the loss of the rest of her support from the U.S., not to 
mention the European states and, last but not least, Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli government, even if right-wing, has to understand that the days of 
Israeli rule in the territories are numbered." 
</P>
<P>
Haaretz (Hebrew) 
</P>
<P>
"The success of the insurgents yesterday was in the severe rioting that took 
place in Arab settlements in Israel. It was once again proved that as long as 
the intifada continues without solution, so it is sure to penetrate across the 
Green Line (separating Israel from the territories). The identification of 
Israeli Arabs with the intifada is full, although at this stage only a minority 
are prepared to resort to violence. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the fact that the PLO leadership (except for the Popular Front) have 
been wary over the last two years not to call on Israeli Arabs to resort to 
acts of violence, and in this way join the intifada, it seems that even among 
the Israeli Arab community the radical voices have increased in volume, and 
many have been drawn after them spontaneously." 
</P>
<P>
Zeev Schiff in Haaretz 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt that this dreadful event is a practical translation of what the 
extremist Israeli leadership is producing in the Israeli public -- starting 
with the necessity to crush the intifada and ending with the need to implement 
the transfer policy (of expelling Arabs from areas under Israeli control). 
</P>
<P>
"These voices have been able to choke the voices in the Israeli public that 
demand coexistence and ask for finding a peaceful solution. The extremist 
voices and those who wish for escalation are much higher than those who preach 
for peace.

"The government of Israel, along with all the political parties in Israel, 
including the extreme right, were in a hurry to deplore the crime and at the 
same time to try to escape responsibility for this massacre by hiding behind 
the claim that the murderer who killed these innocent people was crazy. But 
(he) . . . did this crazy thing only because of the policies of Shamir's 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"It does not matter how effective this condemnation was in the media because it 
cannot wash the crime and the massacre from this land. We want Shamir to know 
this, and we want him to also know that the policies of his extremist 
right-wing government will only harvest another tragedy and massacre if he 
continues with his policies. This is a warning of another total war."

SEPARATIST FIRES ARE BURNING AGAIN IN QUEBEC;

On a packed bus rolling through the streets of Canada's bilingual capital, 
Ottawa, the driver called out, "Please move to the rear of the bus," in heavily 
French-Canadian-accented English. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the crowd of passengers came a loud, sarcastic retort, and a sign of the 
times: "Yes, move to the back and make room for French-Canadians!" 
</P>
<P>
Separatism is back in Canada, after a 10-year time of peace. Even now, no bombs 
are going off, no effigies are being burned, no rioters block the streets -- in 
fact, it's hard even to find anti-English graffiti in the heart of 
French-speaking Montreal. Government officials are quick to argue that Canada's 
current malaise is just more of the general linguistic ill will that has long 
plagued this country. Still, many Canadians are wondering whether this year's 
language crisis will be the ultimate one, the one that blows the country apart. 
</P>
<P>
Polls show that about half the population of the French-speaking province of 
Quebec is now interested in achieving some new political arrangement with the 
rest of Canada. The leader of one of Quebec's largest labor groups, the 
Confederation of National Trade Unions, has recently come out for independence, 
harkening back to the late 1970s, when Quebec's unionists, teachers and 
intellectuals pushed for what they called "sovereignty-association," a status 
that would have kept Quebec economically linked to Canada while granting it 
political independence. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more significant, some Quebec businessmen are even talking about 
outright sovereignty -- not so much because they want political change as 
because they are tired of linguistic bickering and think a break from English 
Canada might help them get on with the real issues of profit and growth. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest of Canada doesn't give us any choice," says Claude Beland, president 
of the Mouvement Desjardins, the largest association of credit unions in the 
province. "We are kicked out of Canada. That's the way I see it." 
</P>
<P>
A D-Day of sorts will arrive on June 23, the date by which all 10 Canadian 
provinces are supposed to have ratified a package of constitutional amendments 
clarifying the relative powers of the federal and provincial governments. The 
amendments were intended to be conciliatory toward Quebec but instead have 
provoked much of today's bitterness both in the province and in 
English-speaking Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The package, which is called the Meech Lake Accord for the resort where it was 
drawn up, is the brainchild of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and he has 
mounted a tremendous 11th-hour battle for its ratification. Three provinces are 
holding out, however. 
</P>
<P>
At the 1987 Meech Lake meeting, Quebec presented what were called its "minimal 
demands." Representatives of all provinces were willing to meet them at the 
time, but since then, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Newfoundland have reneged and 
begun calling for changes in the accord. Since Quebec, having already stated 
its minimal demands, is left no room to maneuver, the amendments' chance of 
ratification seem very unlikely today. 
</P>
<P>
No one in Canada is predicting upheaval on June 24 if the package isn't 
approved on the 23rd. Instead, the date is seen here as a mere milestone -- 
albeit an important one -- in the slow but inexorable unraveling of the 
country. Even if the accord is ratified in the end, analysts say, the debate 
has left deep wounds that will take much time and diplomacy to heal. 
</P>
<P>
If the Meech Lake Accord does not pass, a look ahead: 
</P>
<P>
* For the province of Quebec itself, the immediate reaction to the failure of 
Meech Lake would be shock and a deep sense of rejection by English Canada. 
</P>
<P>
* For Mulroney and the Progressive Conservatives, the debate over the accord 
has been damaging enough; defeat would be disaster. 
</P>
<P>
* Canada's Liberal Party, which wants to run the government and may have a shot 
at the prime minister's job, is poised to capitalize on Mulroney's growing 
problems. But the Liberals have problems of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec's main opposition party, the separatist Parti Quebecois, has printed up 
thousands of pamphlets for distribution this summer, describing its own, 
radical recipe for independence. The plan calls for a nation-state with its own 
constitution, tax-collection system, foreign policy and army, and for Quebec to 
go on using the Canadian dollar and seek minority shareholder status with the 
Bank of Canada. Quebec's premier, Robert Bourassa, has taken a far more 
temperate view. He hails from the Liberal Party, but he has nonetheless been 
supporting Mulroney's Meech Lake Accord -- even though Mulroney is a 
Progressive Conservative. If the Meech Lake Accord were to fail, though, 
Bourassa would certainly feel pressure to back away from Mulroney and embrace 
Quebec "nationalism," as separatism is called here, to avoid being swamped by 
public opinion and overtaken by the Parti Quebecois. 
</P>
<P>
If the constitutional pact fails, Bourassa would at the very least feel freer 
than he has in the past to pass laws promoting French in the province. Such 
laws tend to conflict with Canada's federal Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 
since they restrict English-language minority rights; as such, they outrage 
English-Canadians. Bourassa has so far enacted one such law, banning the use of 
English outdoor signs in Quebec. He is feeling the English-Canadian backlash to 
this day. 
</P>
<P>
When Mulroney was first elected prime minister in 1984, he had two main goals: 
to sign a bilateral trade agreement with the United States and to achieve the 
ratification of the Meech Lake Accord. He succeeded in getting the trade accord 
only at a high political cost; Canadians have been complaining ever since that 
the deal sold out the nation's sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with Meech Lake, the stakes for Mulroney are even higher. The prime 
minister had merely inherited the idea of a free-trade deal; he designed the 
Meech Lake concept, promoted it in his 1984 inaugural address and conducted the 
negotiations personally. If the accord goes down in flames, Mulroney's 
authority, morale and ability to govern would be seriously shaken. And the blow 
would come at a time when Mulroney can least afford it. His approval ratings 
are a mere 15% to 16% these days, the lowest of any Canadian prime minister 
since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Even as his popular support has trickled away, Mulroney has stayed politically 
viable, thanks to the continued loyalty of both English-Canadian Conservatives 
and Quebec nationalists. But if the Meech Lake Accord is defeated, the 
Quebeckers will feel pressured to withdraw their support from Mulroney and 
rally 'round Quebec. Last week, Mulroney's minister of the environment, Lucien 
Bouchard, abandoned his prime minister: He first sent a telegram of support to 
the Parti Quebecois, then resigned. Two other Quebec members of Parliament 
broke ranks with the Progressive Conservatives last week as well. 
</P>
<P>
For Canada's Liberal Party, Mulroney's growing problems don't necessarily spell 
victory, however. 
</P>
<P>
By coincidence, the Liberals will hold their convention on June 24 -- the day 
after the accord deadline -- to select a new party leader. Under Canada's 
parliamentary system, that leader could become Canada's new prime minister the 
next time an election is called, since one must be before 1993. For now, 
candidate Jean Chretien, a Quebecker, looks to be a shoo-in within the 
Liberals. 
</P>
<P>
But does that mean Chretien can capitalize on Mulroney's problems and beat the 
Progressive Conservatives? Would the collapse of the Meech Lake Accord ensure a 
Liberal government next time around? Not necessarily. 
</P>
<P>
Chretien, a traditional Liberal, stands for a strong central government. Thus, 
he opposes the Meech Lake Accord, which promises increased powers to the 
provinces. This stance puts him squarely against Mulroney -- but also puts him 
squarely against public opinion in his own home province. If the accord is 
defeated, Quebeckers could hardly be expected to vote for someone who wanted it 
to die. And it's hard for any political party to win in Canada without winning 
in Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
Fears about the provincial economy, perhaps more than any other factor, 
frightened Quebeckers away from sovereignty when a referendum was held on the 
issue in 1980, with 60% of them voting against it. One study carried out at the 
time showed that real disposable incomes in the province would fall 5% if 
Quebec were to secede. 
</P>
<P>
Now, though, some gray-flannel types are contending that the Quebec business 
class has matured and that the province could go it alone without marring its 
international credit rating. Merrill Lynch has sent a report stating as much to 
its clients. On the downside, political uncertainty never sits well with 
investors. And economists point out that if Quebec were to let out all the 
stops and opt for separation, the new nation-state would find itself relying on 
imported fossil fuels (it now buys gasoline on the cheap from the western 
provinces) and heavily dependent on boom-and-bust-prone natural resources 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
Meech Lake Accord at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
The secessionist debate in Canada revolves around something called the Meech 
Lake Accord, a 1987 package of constitutional amendments that must be ratified 
by all 10 provinces. In a nutshell, the accord: 
</P>
<P>
Recognizes the linguistic duality of Canada and points out that within Canada, 
Quebec constitutes a "distinct society". 
</P>
<P>
Permits the provinces to opt out of certain kinds of shared-cost federal 
spending programs and requires the federal government to pay "reasonable 
compensation" to provinces that choose to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Gives provinces the right to negotiate their own immigration policies with the 
federal government (Quebec has already reached such an arrangement, at an 
administrative level). 
</P>
<P>
Puts the Supreme Court under the constitution and gives the provinces the right 
to nominate justices to fill vacancies; Quebec would have three of the nine 
justices. The accord also gives provinces a say in the selection of Canada's 
appointed Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Changes the formula by which Canada amends its constitution.

<P>
When America's cobblers got trampled by a wave of foreign-made footwear in the 
1970s, a modest, family-run shoemaker based in Dexter, Me., hunkered down, 
rationalized its operations and emerged as one of the few survivors. Now, 
Dexter Shoe Co. is doing something that might have been dismissed as next to 
impossible not too long ago -- selling shoes in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Or, at least Dexter is trying to sell shoes here. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is, its distributor is stuck with a government quota on the number 
of imported shoes it can sell at the standard 27% tariff rate: 7,312 pairs 
every six months. Above that, a punitive tariff of 60% is levied, making retail 
prices prohibitively high. 
</P>
<P>
And a Catch-22 prevents importers from expanding their quotas, which, in 
principle, are allocated on the basis of the number of shoes already being 
imported. In other words, you had to sell foreign shoes last year to import 
them again this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Dexter is not a company in a hurry," said Daniel A. Miller, president of 
Dexter's marketing division in Boston, who recently visited Japan to make the 
rounds of government officials and business contacts. "We're impatiently 
patient." 
</P>
<P>
Japan's protected shoe industry offers one of the most blatant examples of the 
kind of market barriers frequently blamed for stopping U.S. exports and 
preserving America's $49-billion trade deficit with its Asian ally. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the shoe barrier is a delicate political accommodation and a 
murky social taboo: The Japanese leather and footwear industry is ostensibly 
dominated by the burakumin, a hereditary caste discriminated against over the 
ages for engaging in "unclean" trades such as tanning and mortuary work. 
</P>
<P>
To compensate for past -- and present -- injustices, the government shields the 
leather industry from foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan is now paying the price for unequal treatment (of the burakumin) and is 
not able to apply free-market principles," said Yutaka Kosai, president of the 
Japan Center for Economic Research and a member of the Industrial Structure 
Council, a panel of prominent academics and industry leaders advising the 
government on trade policy. 
</P>
<P>
"No one wants to discuss the burakumin," said Dallas Pyle, an export agent 
based in Portland, Me., who introduced Dexter to the Japanese market. "It's an 
extremely sensitive issue -- so sensitive it doesn't exist." 
</P>
<P>
Still, by all accounts Dexter is doing everything the right way in its efforts 
to sell to Japan. After being approached by Pyle and a Japanese distributor in 
1986, the company retooled, investing $200,000 in new equipment to make shoes 
sized for Japanese feet. The goal was to export 50,000 pairs worth about $1.5 
million each year. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, nobody in the Dexter Shoe organization was export-oriented," said 
Miller. "It's sort of the bad old New England mentality, that selling overseas 
is more trouble than it's worth. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been exporting, but we were doing it more by accident than by design -- 
the hard way," he said. "God forbid if someone sent us a telex to place an 
order. We didn't know how to answer." 
</P>
<P>
Privately held Dexter, which bills itself as "America's largest independent 
shoemaker," currently has annual sales of between $250 million and $300 
million. Exports account for less than 1% of total sales. 
</P>
<P>
The scheme to sell in Japan got off to a strong start. In 1987, Dexter shipped 
35,000 pairs of shoes after its Japanese distributor acquired options on unused 
import quotas from other dealers. But last year, it was not so lucky. The quota 
was cut in half, and Dexter now has thousands of pairs of Japanese-sized shoes 
sitting in a Boston warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Dexter in a way is a model company. They've been trying very hard, but they're 
a victim of the system," said a U.S. official in Tokyo. "To their credit, 
they're not complaining about the past. They're looking to the future." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the past about which Dexter might complain is a deal struck in 1986 
between U.S. trade officials and the Japanese government. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side agreed to drop charges in a trade dispute over Japan's closed 
leather industry in exchange for limited liberalization -- from absolute quotas 
to the tariff-quota system -- and "payoff" tariff concessions for unrelated 
U.S. commodities, such as aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
"It obviously didn't help much if you were a shoe exporter," said the U.S. 
official, who spoke on condition that he not be named. 
</P>
<P>
More than U.S. shoes are at stake, however. High-priced fancy brands made in 
Europe dominate the imports, and multilateral negotiations on the restrictions 
are now pending before the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, possibly 
paving the way for further liberalization. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dexter is constantly being "shopped" by the big Japanese trading 
houses that broker in the coveted shoe import quotas. But Miller said he feels 
loyalty to the family-run distributor, Chukyo Moonstar of Nagoya, which has 
been conscientiously promoting Dexter's "image" in Japan as well as lobbying 
for an increased quota to sell the shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"We could do more business here tomorrow if we went with one of the large 
trading companies," Miller said. "But we have too much respect for the efforts 
of Chukyo Moonstar to seek alternatives. We made our deal with them, and we're 
going to stick with them."

SOCKERS SING ROOSTER SONG, WANT TITLE TO CROW ABOUT 
</P>

BALTIMORE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the song, the cow can't produce milk, the chicken can't lay eggs, and the 
elephant has no tusks. 
</P>
<P>
Before too long, a wise old rooster comes along and helps them all solve their 
problems. Wondrous what can happen in an old Irish proverb, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers' rooster is midfielder Brian Quinn, who, by the way, is Irish. With 
boosts from both his vocal leadership and his MISL-leading 17 playoff points, 
the Sockers are back where they were a year ago, playing the Baltimore Blast in 
the best-of-seven MISL championship series starting at 4:35 tonight in 
Baltimore Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn brought the rooster song to this country from the pubs of Ireland. He 
only sings it when the Sockers accomplish something significant. An important 
victory, or a championship. Nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just like a number-one single that gets sung every day," Quinn says. 
"There's more to it than that. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a story of trials and tribulations, when your team has an uphill struggle 
and then you win and it's a relief. The rooster comes through again." 
</P>
<P>
How appropriate. A more troubled team there may never have been than this 
year's version of the Sockers. For a while, it looked as if they wouldn't even 
make the playoffs, a rather amazing thought considering they have won seven 
championships in eight seasons and haven't missed the playoffs since their 
first indoor year in 1980-81. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of people counted the Sockers out this year," said defender 
Kevin Crow. "You can't blame them. But we never lost faith. We knew what we 
were capable of doing. 
</P>
<P>
"This season definitely shows we know what it takes to get there. The 
experience of the past years has helped." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers didn't dwell on their 25-27 regular-season record. In spite of six 
months of mishaps, they entered the playoffs with the attitude that they were 
once again the team to beat. Consequently, St. Louis fell, 3-1, in the Western 
Division semifinals and Dallas fell, 4-2, in the division finals. 
</P>
<P>
Now Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
The Blast had the best record in the MISL during the regular season at 32-20. 
And they have a score to settle with the Sockers after losing to them in three 
previous championship series. Who can forget last year's dramatics? 
</P>
<P>
A flashback: 
</P>
<P>
In Game 1, the Sockers watched their two-goal lead fade in the final minutes 
and wound up losing in overtime. Game 2 was won by the Sockers on a crazy goal 
in overtime by veteran forward Steve Zungul. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers won Games 3 and 4 at home and had a chance to wrap up the series in 
San Diego. But they lost Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
Back to Baltimore. The Blast, down 3-2 in the series, stomped on the Sockers, 
7-0, in Game 6. Two days later, the Sockers won the championship, 6-5, in a 
classic game in which Baltimore came back from a 6-1 deficit in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The celebration included drinks at the bar and you-know-who singing the rooster 
song. 
</P>
<P>
What are the chances for an encore? 
</P>
<P>
Quite good, if you listen to St. Louis Coach Don Popovic, who said a few weeks 
ago that the Sockers would win the title if they could get passed Dallas. The 
Sidekicks tested the Sockers' ability to endure bumps, kicks and elbows and 
they survived. This series should be decided by finesse. 
</P>
<P>
The Blast is an interesting study. At a glance, they appear to have slid 
downhill since last season. Part of their original nucleus departed when David 
Byrne was traded to Wichita, and Kai Haaskivi and Mike Sweeney were chosen by 
Cleveland in the expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
Still, what Baltimore has that Dallas was missing is diversity. Stop Tatu and 
you stop the Sidekicks. The Blast doesn't have anyone with his ability, but 
they chip away with a handful of pesky, scrappy players, including midfielders 
Billy Ronson, Paul Dougherty and Mike Stankovic, defender Tim Wittman and 
forward Domenic Mobilio. 
</P>
<P>
Mobilio, a second-year player, typifies the Blast as much as anyone. He finds 
ways to score goals but rarely does it spectacularly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to understand Mobilio," Socker Coach Ron Newman said. "He 
scores a lot of goals, and yet you don't feel threatened by him. Every time 
Tatu got the ball everybody would focus on him. Sometimes you don't do that 
with other players. I think Mobilio is one of those." 
</P>
<P>
Newman would like to exploit Baltimore's youth, though he says they are a team 
with few weaknesses. The Sockers are perhaps a bit less versatile than the 
Blast, who call on their players to fill a variety of roles. Baltimore will 
often score with defenders and defend with forwards. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers are still looking for more from midfielder Branko Segota, who 
wasn't much of a factor in the Dallas series until the final game, when he had 
a goal and an assist. Another player who could lift the Sockers is forward 
Damir Haramina, who has still only shown glimpses of the shot that made him 
such a threat two years ago in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
As for the entertainment value of this series, who knows? Without high-profile 
players such as Zungul, out with arthritic hips, Byrne and Haaskivi, interest 
will have to come from the performances of the teams. 
</P>
<P>
It has been said that each time the Sockers win a championship the MISL loses a 
bit of credibility. Maybe, but the Sockers will think about that later. 
</P>
<P>
"As a player, you can't worry about what's good for the league," Crow said. "If 
your league isn't going to make it because of a certain team winning the 
championship then, the way I look at it, it doesn't belong anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers have a lot of nicks but are all scheduled to play. On the injury 
list: Defender Kevin Crow (abdominal strain), midfielder Branko Segota (left 
hip bursitis), defender Cacho (right ankle strain), defender George Fernandez 
(right knee bursitis), forward Rod Castro (left hip flexor) and defender Ralph 
Black (shoulder strain). . . . Rookie defender Don Cogsville was not brought on 
the trip.

PIRATES ARE OLDER, WISER -- AND BETTER 
</P>

PITTSBURGH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maturity is taking on some incredibly contorted dimensions in the Pittsburgh 
Pirates' clubhouse. On one wall is a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle collage, in 
deference to Mike LaValliere, the resident ninja-like catcher. Seated at his 
locker, wearing a demonic grin, is Wally Backman, whose remarkable dexterity 
with one of baseball's most revered pranks -- the hotfoot -- is evoking awe 
from the most seasoned pranksters. 
</P>
<P>
Analgesic hot balm is being applied to underwear for the purpose of searing 
unsuspecting flesh. Raw eggs are being broken over the heads of grown men. 
Young players are being forced to walk through airports wearing platform shoes. 
</P>
<P>
It's all part of a maturation process, the Pirates say. Rest assured it's a 
level of dementia understood only by baseball players. 
</P>
<P>
"We've become a very mature team," outfielder R.J. Reynolds said. "We're mature 
in a baseball sense. We're loose, even when we lose. Guys are on each other 
constantly, which is good. Nobody on the team is immune." 
</P>
<P>
Recent developments have made it imperative for the Pirates to retain a sense 
of humor. A startlingly torrid start has been followed by a stretch that is 
threatening to become equally horrid. 
</P>
<P>
They started 22-9, and their selfless, hero-du-jour style began drawing 
comparisons with the 1960 Pirates, a team that stunned baseball by excelling at 
such unappreciated endeavors as moving runners along and throwing strikes. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a 31-day stay in first place in the National League East. They 
fell to second after Friday's 9-8 loss to the Giants but regained first 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's just late May, and that's it," manager Jim Leyland said. "We 
aren't even concerned with where we are in the standings." 
</P>
<P>
But if the clutch hits continue their sabbatical -- and if Walt Terrell (1-4, 
5.18 earned run average) keeps getting pummeled -- some concern may be 
inevitable. Maybe the "Ninja Shrine" might have its rabbit's-foot license 
revoked. 
</P>
<P>
"No way. That's brought us a lot of good luck," Reynolds said. "We bring the 
posters on the road with us. They go everywhere we go. They're always there for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Center fielder Andy Van Slyke started the craze, which has escalated to the 
point that the Pittsburgh Press published an editorial cartoon depicting a 
turtle wearing a Pirates cap with the caption: "They're young, they're strong 
and they can't be stopped. They're Teenage Mutant Ninja Pirates." 
</P>
<P>
LaValliere is a 5-foot-10, 205-pound catcher whose build -- graciously called 
"sturdy" by Van Slyke -- earned him a comparison with the gluttonous crime 
fighters. 
</P>
<P>
It is somewhat appropriate for the Pirates to ally themselves with 
pizza-eating, sewer-dwelling superheroes. The Bucs (almost universally called 
"Buccos" in these parts) are a curious mix of castoffs, retreads and young 
stars who have come together under unusual circumstances to perform beyond 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Of several off-season deals, the free-agent signing of Backman has proved to be 
the most significant. After spending last year with the Minnesota Twins, the 
former New York Met has moved in at third base against right-handed pitchers. 
The move has allowed Bobby Bonilla to take his dangerous bat (.306, 12 homers, 
38 RBI) and shaky glove (35 errors in 1989) to right field. 
</P>
<P>
Backman, who platoons with Jeff King, is leading off and hitting .340. His 
tenacious nature, complete with flying helmets and expletives, has added a dash 
of plutonium to the team chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
General manager Larry Doughty, criticized in Pittsburgh last year after taking 
over for Syd Thrift, used the skills he gained from a career in scouting to 
bring depth to the Pirates. He traded with the Yankees for catcher Don Slaught, 
who has hit .362 while playing against left-handers. He signed free-agent Ted 
Power, who has three saves in a set-up role for stopper Bill Landrum. 
</P>
<P>
In March 1989, Doughty traded pitcher Brett Gideon to Montreal for Neal Heaton, 
who had a 61-83 record coming into this season. During the lockout, Heaton 
added something called a screw-knuckle-change to his 
fastball-fastball-fastball. He is now 7-1 with a 2.84 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Backman has garnered the most attention, mostly for his, uh, fiery approach to 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds' eyes widen and his head shakes as he describes Backman's pyromaniacal 
talents. If Reynolds were on the Nobel Committee, you get the feeling Backman 
would get at least one vote. 
</P>
<P>
"He makes the best hotfoots I've ever seen," Reynolds said. "He's amazing. He 
takes a whole book of matches, ties them together and lights them with a 
cigarette. That gives it a slow burn that just sits there for a few seconds 
before BOOM!. It's almost like an M-80. That's how good they are." 
</P>
<P>
Presiding over the antics is Leyland, who doesn't come across as the type of 
guy who looks upon the game of baseball as one big belly laugh. 
</P>
<P>
He has been known to pore over a lineup card for up to three hours before a 
game. He chain smokes in the dugout, fretting over strategy decisions. More 
than once he has rearranged his office furniture after a loss. "He's an 
emotional, intense guy," Van Slyke said. "That's OK, because this is an 
emotional game. He's a great guy to play for, because you always know where you 
stand." 
</P>
<P>
Leyland's demeanor is stern and humorless, in much the same manner as A's 
manager Tony La Russa. The comparison is not random; Leyland coached under La 
Russa with the Chicago White Sox for four years. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony without question made me a big-league manager," Leyland said. "He didn't 
make me a manager, but he made me a big-league manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be compared with Tony La Russa, though. That's an injustice to 
Tony. He's won a world championship. I've won in Evansville and Lakeland." 
</P>
<P>
Pirates pitching coach Ray Miller is not conservative with his comparisons. The 
Baltimore Orioles' pitching coach from 1978-85, Miller says Leyland is on a par 
with Earl Weaver. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy will rip your rear end, then be the first one to say hello the next 
day," Miller said. "He's one of the fairest men in the game, just like Earl. I 
think he handles a team as well as Earl. He prepares as well as Earl, and I 
didn't think anybody could do that." 
</P>
<P>
Preparation has been made easier this year. The Pirates were a traveling 
infirmary last year, when they finished 74-88. This year the only injury of 
note was suffered by pitcher John Smiley, who broke his pitching hand 10 days 
ago by slamming it in a car door. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like we had three wheels last year," Reynolds said. "We used to run out 
of plays, run out of moves. Now that doesn't happen. Now we're the guys with 
the versatility, and Jim knows how to use it. That's what you need for the long 
haul, and we ARE in this for the long haul."

SAN DIEGO HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK;

<P>
TOP PITCHERS MEET IN 1-A BASEBALL FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It will be a showdown between the top two pitchers in the 1-A, not only on the 
mound but at the plate as well, when Julian and Midway Baptist meet in the San 
Diego Section 1-A Baseball Championships at 3:30 p.m. today at Grossmont 
College. 
</P>
<P>
Julian pitcher Travis Denmark (9-4) not only led the county with 149 strikeouts 
in 89 innings but finished up the regular season with a .625 batting average. 
Denmark hit his 14th home run of the season in Julian's 7-0 semifinal victory 
over Imperial, bringing his RBI total to 44. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Steve Smith (8-1). Being from a school of 55 students and a team 
which never made it past the first round of section playoffs until this year, 
Smith is like an unknown soldier. 
</P>
<P>
The Midway Baptist senior, a four-year starter, has struck out 117 batters in 
71 innings and is batting .568 with three home runs and 31 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams won their respective leagues and Denmark and Smith were their 
league's most valuable players. Midway Baptist is in the Citrus League and 
Julian in the Coastal League. 
</P>
<P>
Denmark will have a slight advantage having played in a section championship 
game before. Julian won the 1-A title in 1988, defeating Borrego Springs, 7-1. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a match-up of two very good pitchers," Midway Baptist Coach Jerry 
Webb said. "Both are power pitchers." 
</P>
<P>
Julian Coach Carl Focarelli agreed: "No team will run away (with the victory). 
The game will be won in the pitching." 
</P>
<P>
Midway Baptist, which had never won more than 13 games in a season, has 
compiled a 21-3 record. Webb, whose team is senior dominated and will have only 
two returning players next year, expected to do well this season but was 
surprised to make it to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
"The Holtville victory was a bonus," Webb said of his team's 8-4 semifinal 
victory. "We're the smallest team in Citrus League and its very satisfying to 
take a few kids and see them work together the way they do." 
</P>
<P>
The other pitchers for Midway Baptist are senior Tobin Wilkins (8-2) and 
sophomore John Taylor (4-0). Taylor, the Patriots second leading hitter behind 
Smith, is batting .516. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Midway Baptist, Julian (19-6) is far from experienced. In fact, 
Focarelli figured this would be a rebuilding year for his team. 
</P>
<P>
"No one expected us to win even eight games," Focarelli said. "I knew we had 
Denmark but you can't rely on just one guy." 
</P>
<P>
Julian starts three freshmen but Focarelli said that as the season progressed 
the seniors on the team helped the younger players mature. 
</P>
<P>
Focarelli, like Webb, was surprised to come out of the semifinals victorious. 
</P>
<P>
"Imperial is a much bigger school than us," Focarelli said. "No one had given 
us a chance to beat them. The boys are really emotional (during these playoff 
games) and are playing at a different level." 
</P>
<P>
Denmark's reliever, freshman Graham Koonce (10-2), who finished fourth in the 
county in batting with a .486 average, had struck out 80 this season. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Ormsby has been named Poway's water polo coach replacing Mark Miller, who 
retired after 16 years following his team's 13-8 loss to Coronado in the San 
Diego Section finals last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Ormsby has coached at Palomar College the past three years and is a junior high 
teacher in Chula Vista. He coached the Hilltop water polo team from 1976-81 
collecting a section title in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Ormsby worked with the national junior development water polo training camp in 
the summer of 1982 in Colorado Springs. He coached Grossmont College from 
1983-87 and has been at Palomar since. 
</P>
<P>
Ormsby, who graduated from San Diego State in 1975, was a high school 
all-American in both swimming and water polo. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Smidt is one of the few softball players in the county who can say she 
started on four consecutive section championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop's won its fourth consecutive 1-A softball title Saturday by defeating La 
Jolla Country Day, 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels great," Smidt, a catcher, said. "Each one had special meaning but 
this one is extra special because its my last." 
</P>
<P>
This is not only Smidt's final year at Bishop's but probably her last 
competitive softball team as well. Smidt, who's been on a softball team since 
she was seven, has opted not to play in college. Smidt will attend USC next 
fall and at most will play on an intramural team. 
</P>
<P>
University City's Chris Hansen, a foreign exchange student from Denmark who won 
the boys' singles and doubles titles at the section badminton championships 
Thursday, said that he didn't really know anything about the sport of football 
until he came to the U.S. In Denmark soccer and badminton are the most popular 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
When asked what he thought about American sports, Hansen said: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like baseball. It looks boring. Football sounded like a bunch of 
stupid big guys pounding each other over." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen, who finished with a 33-0 singles record, also earned a varsity letter 
in soccer at UC. 
</P>
<P>
There won't be a miniature football or a catcher's mitt next to the basinet 
after Paula Zimmerman delivers her third child. Instead, there may be a 
pint-sized volleyball waiting. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman, with a due date of June 11, coached her San Pasqual boys' volleyball 
team to a 15-4, 15-17, 15-11, 15-8 San Diego Section 2-A victory against 
University City Friday night at Southwestern College. 
</P>
<P>
Will it be a volleyball player? "I don't know," Zimmerman said. She and her 
husband, Bob, have two girls: Bonnie, 4 1/2, and Ellie, 2 1/2. "My girls are 
not too interested yet. Maybe if it's a boy." 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman said her doctors gave her clearance to coach throughout the season 
and she never got overly excitement. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our matches were pretty easy," she said. "I assumed I'd be able to 
make." 
</P>

RAIN CANCELS HOLIDAY EVENTS, CAUSES SLIDES; 
</P>
<P>
WEATHER: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, WITH 1.5 INCHES, RECEIVED THE MOST RAINFALL IN 
ORANGE COUNTY. THE RECORD MEMORIAL DAY DOWNPOUR THWARTED THE PLANS OF MANY.

<P>
An unexpected, wintry rainstorm swept through Southern California on Monday, 
dumping record rainfall that unleashed mudslides and caught Memorial Day 
celebrants unprepared and underdressed. 
</P>
<P>
The morning storm dropped more than an inch of rain in some places, washing out 
camping, picnicking and sun bathing and forcing organizers of a variety of 
Memorial Day observances to alter their programs or cancel them altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't see it coming down so far with such intensity," said Steve Burback, 
a spokesman for WeatherData Inc., which provides weather information for The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
Burback said the storm originated in the Gulf of Alaska and moved into Southern 
California at about 3:30 a.m., bringing with it below-normal temperatures and 
record amounts of rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, San Juan Capistrano received the most rainfall, collecting 
more than 1.5 inches, while Santiago and Modjeska peaks received 1.4 inches, 
Burback said. 
</P>
<P>
The high temperature in Santa Ana was 67 -- about 10 degrees cooler than normal 
for this time of year, Burback said. 
</P>
<P>
National Weather Service spokesman Jerry Steiger said that total rainfall in 
Santa Ana measured 0.52 inches and Anaheim experienced a third of an inch of 
rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
Burback said a general clearing with scattered high clouds began Monday 
afternoon and was expected to continue through today. 
</P>
<P>
In downtown Los Angeles, 1.17 inches of rain fell -- a breakaway record, since 
the best any previous Memorial Day could muster was 0.12 of an inch. "It's 
acting more like wintertime," Burback said. Snow that measured as much as four 
inches at Big Bear melted when it hit the ground elsewhere in the mountains, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
None of this put much of a dent in the drought: For example, while the 1.17 
inches brought Los Angeles' monthly total to 1.20 inches, this year's rainfall 
so far amounts to 7.38 inches, not quite half of the normal 14.82 inches. 
</P>
<P>
But the quenching rain at the same time dampened Memorial observances. 
</P>
<P>
For 25 consecutive years, Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Cypress has remembered 
the thousands of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who died in war. But 
persistent rainfall Monday morning caused mortuary officials to cancel the 11 
a.m. service, manager Darren Drabing said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all very disappointed that we had to break it off," Drabing said. 
</P>
<P>
In Fullerton, however, the Loma Vista Memorial Park observance was held in 
spite of a steady drizzle. Cemetery spokeswoman Sharon Adams said the ceremony 
lacked only the 500 large American flags that were to line the main entrance to 
the memorial park. 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 people huddled under umbrellas and white canopies to listen to 
Maj. Gen. Norris Einerston, chief chaplain of the Army, deliver a somber 
address, Adams said. Small flags and crosses were then placed on the graves of 
about 3,000 veterans buried in Loma Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the county, beaches, campgrounds and parks were mostly empty as the 
thick cloud cover and occasional downpour forced a mass exodus to warmer and 
drier activities. 
</P>
<P>
The pre-summer holiday, normally marked by sun worshiping and other outdoor 
activities, was the bleakest in memory. 
</P>
<P>
"I got only one color for you out here. That's gray," Newport Beach lifeguard 
Jim Turner said of the dismal day that looked more like mid-January than the 
start of beach season. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-morning, the only sign of life in the normally crowded beach resort was 
on the Newport Pier, where disappointed beach-goers wrapped in sweat shirts, 
jackets and blankets forlornly watched the surf. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Turner said, more than 90,000 people flocked to Newport Beach on 
Sunday. But with winds reaching 25 m.p.h. on Monday, Turner said, air 
temperatures dipped to about 48 degrees, and not a soul could be spotted on the 
stretches of sand. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the die-hards are gone," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
Camper Dick Cliver, however, counted himself as a die-hard, deciding to stick 
out his San Clemente beach vacation despite chilling temperatures, soggy 
clothes and a damp tent. 
</P>
<P>
"We found out that the tent leaked and so does the camper," said Cliver, 
sitting in an eight-foot camper atop a pickup truck at San Clemente State 
Beach. Nearby, dozens of footprints in the soft mud led to a huge nylon tent 
filled with the soaked belongings of family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not driving us out," said Cliver, a Buena Park resident. "We'll just 
sit in here and watch it rain if we have to." 
</P>
<P>
Carl and Lindy Spencer and their two children, who drove all night in the rain 
from Las Vegas, spent the first part of a week's vacation at Doheny coping with 
flooded campgrounds and the downpour. 
</P>
<P>
They managed to erect two nylon tents and tied a clothesline from their car to 
a nearby tree to dry out drenched clothes and towels. 
</P>
<P>
Interstate 5 was hit hard early in the morning, with flooding causing closures 
along the freeway at Junipero Serra Road in San Juan Capistrano and Red Hill 
Avenue in Tustin, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP was also kept busy rushing to the scenes of more than a dozen traffic 
accidents that slowed highways to a crawl in many areas. They attributed the 
majority of accidents to slick roads. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally on the first day (of rain), it's the craziest," said CHP Officer 
Bryan Duquesnel. "They are just cranking on down the road and don't pay 
attention (to water hazards)." 
</P>
<P>
A stretch of Dana Point Harbor Road leading to the Dana Point Marine Institute 
and a residential road near the intersection of Street of the Golden Lantern 
and Camino del Avion in Laguna Niguel were closed temporarily due to mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
"The water and the mud were up to my knees," said County Harbors Beaches and 
Parks worker Brian Young as he worked to clear Dana Point Harbor Road, which 
leads to the Dana Point Marine Institute. "It was a pretty big slide. 
</P>
<P>
As the rain subsided later in the afternoon, thousands of Orange County 
residents had changed their outdoor plans and opted to flock to area malls 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been busy like mad," said Mona Salameh, an employee at the May Co. 
department store in South Coast Plaza. "I went out into the mall and it's the 
busiest I've seen it since Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Typically, Memorial Day draws a fair amount of shoppers because many stores 
advertise sale prices and stay open longer hours, but today was exceptionally 
busy because of inclement weather, Salameh said.

COMING SOON? Will the library get Nixon's vice presidential papers, which he 
gave to the government in hopes of a tax write-off? . . . Now in Laguna Niguel, 
they'll probably be stored in Yorba Linda, said Hewitt, based on "our good 
working relationship with the (federal) archives." Mark I. Pinsky and Steve

THE TIMES ORANGE COUNTY POLL; 
</P>
<P>
VOTERS OPPOSE MEASURE TO RESTRICT JAILS TO SANTA ANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Voters throughout Orange County strongly oppose a June ballot measure that 
would restrict all future county jail construction to Santa Ana, favoring 
instead the idea of putting the jail in the Riverside County desert, according 
to The Times Orange County Poll. 
</P>
<P>
Measure A, or the Centralized Jail Initiative, was opposed by 58% of 600 voters 
surveyed. Only 33% of voters said they would support the measure, while 9% were 
undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Among likely voters, the measure fares no better: 60% said they oppose Measure 
A, with 33% again pledging their support. 
</P>
<P>
The measure was put on the June 5 ballot by residents of Anaheim Hills and 
Yorba Linda who oppose the county's plan to build a 6,000-inmate jail in nearby 
Gypsum Canyon. The group gathered more than 100,000 signatures in a 1988 
initiative drive to qualify the measure for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
But the group, called Taxpayers for a Centralized Jail, has apparently failed 
in its attempt to find broad-based support for the measure. A majority of both 
Democrats and Republicans expressed an apparent distaste for the proposal, as 
did voters in all parts of the county -- not just in Santa Ana, where city 
officials have blasted the measure as being tinged with racism because it would 
dump all future jails in the largely Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
Lucinda Lowry of El Toro, a participant in the Times poll, said she preferred 
to see a jail built in a undeveloped section of Riverside County, reasoning 
that it would be unjust to drop a new jail into the established neighborhoods 
of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it would be fair to signal out any particular city in the 
county," she said. "If they chose a remote area, then people who would move out 
there after the jail was built would know it was there." 
</P>
<P>
The telephone survey of 600 registered voters was conducted by Mark Baldassare 
&amp; Associates May 21 through 23. The margin of error for a sample of this 
size is plus 4% or minus 4%. 
</P>
<P>
Measure A seeks to locate all future county jails in Santa Ana without naming 
the city. It asks if all future jail sites within Orange County should be built 
in the "county seat" and if expansion of jail facilities existing outside the 
county seat should be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
While a majority of poll respondents opposed restricting jails to Santa Ana, 
they agreed with near-unanimity that current jail and court facilities are not 
sufficient. Ninety-two percent said that expanding county justice facilities is 
somewhat important or very important, while just 4% said it was not important. 
Here, too, Democrats and Republicans were nearly identical in their responses. 
</P>
<P>
But the question that has plagued county supervisors for more than a decade is 
where a new jail should be built. Each time they have focused on a site, there 
has been an outcry from nearby residents and threatened or real litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Voters who responded to the poll displayed the same "Not in My Back Yard" 
syndrome: 69% said they prefer the idea of putting the jail in the remote 
Riverside County desert, while just 12% said their first choice would be Gypsum 
Canyon. Santa Ana was the preferred jail location of just 8% of those surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
"It suggests we're actually a small county," Baldassare said, with voters 
rejecting locations in any part of the county, not just their own. "Voters seem 
to have reached a consensus on wanting (a jail) in the desert." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Don R. Roth has promoted the idea of building a jail in the desert. 
Staffs from Orange and Riverside counties are studying the proposals, but no 
details such as a site have been worked out yet. 
</P>
<P>
Poll participant Dorothy Miller of Anaheim favored putting the jail in Santa 
Ana, suggesting that transporting prisoners out to the desert would open the 
window for a wider array of security problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we have the possible expansion space right now in Santa Ana, it seems 
the logical thing to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Baldassare speculated that Roth's proposal to build a county or regional jail 
in the Riverside County desert may have hurt Measure A. With that apparently 
popular idea getting so much attention, people might think it unwise to limit 
jails to Santa Ana, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Discussion of the possibility of a jail site outside Orange County does hurt 
the initiative," Baldassare said. "It suggests to people, why should they limit 
their options . . . when there's that possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Measure A proponents claim that their proposal would not preclude the county 
from joining other counties in building a regional facility in the desert. But 
Measure A opponents have disputed that claim, leaving the issue somewhat murky. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
The Times Orange County Poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare and Associates. 
The telephone survey of 600 registered voters was conducted over three nights, 
ending Wednesday, using a random sample of listed and unlisted telephone 
numbers in Orange County. The margin of error for the entire sample is 
plus-or-minus 4%. That means it is 95% certain that the results are within 4 
percentage points of what they would be if all registered voters in Orange 
County were interviewed. For the subsample of 328 Republicans, the margin of 
error is 6 points. And for the 212 Democrats, it is 7 points.

CLASS OF '89 MADE MARK ON THE SAT; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THE COUNTY'S HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS SCORED DRAMATIC GAINS OVER 1984 
GRADUATES. THE NUMBER MEETING UC STANDARDS FOR ADVANCED PLACEMENT MORE THAN 
DOUBLED.

The number of high school seniors who achieved Scholastic Aptitude Test scores 
high enough for admission to state colleges increased dramatically in Orange 
County in the last five years, and that of seniors who passed advanced 
placement tests more than doubled, according to figures released by the state 
Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics comparing 1984 graduates to members of the class of 1989 showed that 
the number of seniors who scored 450 or better in the SAT's verbal section and 
500 or better in math increased 39% and 43%, respectively, in Orange County. 
Every district in the county for which figures were available reported gains in 
both categories. 
</P>
<P>
A verbal score of 450 and a math score of 500 makes most students eligible for 
admission to the University of California or California State University 
systems, said state Department of Education spokeswoman Susie Lange. 
</P>
<P>
Countywide, 17.8% of 1989 seniors who took the SAT scored at least 450 in the 
verbal section, or 39% higher than the 12.8% of seniors with similar scores in 
1984. In math, 21.6% of seniors reached at least 500, 43% more than the 15.1% 
of 1984 seniors with similar results. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County totals far surpassed the state averages, which showed a 21% 
rise in seniors achieving at least 450 in verbal and a 24% increase in those 
scoring at least 500 in math over the same five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
"What this means is that over the past five years there has been substantial 
growth in the pool of young people better prepared to go on to college and into 
the work force," state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
The figures were compiled as part of a state report on trends in performance by 
college-bound students. The report also studied the percentage of seniors who 
successfully completed courses required for entry into the UC system, and on 
the number of advanced placement exams passed per 100 seniors. Sharp rises were 
also reported in most Orange County districts in those categories. 
</P>
<P>
Countywide, 35% of the Orange County class of 1989 met what are known as the 
"a-f requirements," or courses required by UC for admission. That represented a 
22% increase over the class of 1985, when 28.7% of the seniors successfully 
completed the a-f course requirements, which include U.S. history, four years 
of English, three years of math, a laboratory science, two years of a foreign 
language and elective courses. 
</P>
<P>
On the advanced placement exams -- which are administered in 24 academic 
subject areas including biology, physics, French, calculus, music theory and 
computer science -- 28 of every 100 seniors who took the tests in 1989 passed. 
That was a whopping 128% increase over 1984, when 12.3 of every 100 AP students 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
The countywide average on the AP exams was significantly increased by students 
in the Fullerton Joint Union High School district, where the number of seniors 
who passed the test soared from 7.3 of every 100 in 1984 to 32.9 of every 100 
in 1989 -- an increase of 351%. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County averages were indicative of the state trend, which showed 20% 
more graduates meeting the a-f requirements and 114% more seniors passing 
advanced placement exams in 1989. Some of the increases around the state were 
eye-popping -- in the El Rancho Unified District in Los Angeles County, the 
percentage of seniors meeting a-f requirements rose from 10.7% in 1985 to 61.2% 
in 1989. In the San Leandro Unified district in Alameda County, students who 
passed AP exams rose from 0.7 to 11.6 of every 100 students from 1984 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Educators throughout Orange County attributed the huge improvements in 
college-bound test scores to greater emphasis on honors courses, development of 
preparatory courses for college entrance tests and the sharp rise in the number 
of students taking advanced placement courses, for which they earn college 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Givner, deputy superintendent of the Irvine Unified School District, 
where senior SAT scores of at least 450 in verbal and 500 in math rose 37% and 
31%, respectively, said parents and students are both placing greater emphasis 
on advanced placement courses because of the soaring costs of college tuition. 
Students and their families can save hundreds of dollars in tuition by earning 
some college credit while in free public schools, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Givner, like other administrators, also noted the increasing popularity of SAT 
preparatory courses, which some districts include in their curricula. 
</P>
<P>
"We offer SAT review-type courses in our curriculum," said William Eller, 
assistant superintendent for instructional operations in the Capistrano Unified 
District, which posted gains of 50% in the SAT verbal section and 39% in math. 
"We've also made efforts to (teach) kids on private or available (computer) 
software programs which do familiarize the students with test-taking 
strategies. We also encourage students who don't do well to retake the exam." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the SAT review courses have come under fire by critics who charge that 
educators are "teaching to the test," or reviewing specific questions that will 
appear on SATs. Most administrators, however, said the courses teach only 
"test-taking strategies." 
</P>
<P>
"Some people are real critical of preparing for a test, but there's no way to 
teach the SAT," said Clara Ingalls, an administrative assistant in charge of 
research and evaluation in the Orange Unified School District. "You can teach 
students key words to clue into, or the types of questions that most often 
appear on the test, or what kind of clues you can pick up from reading a 
question. But I don't think it's possible to teach the test." 
</P>
<P>
One such course is offered by the Princeton Review, a private firm that coaches 
students for SATs. Julio Kidder, SAT coordinator for the Review in Orange 
County, said about a third of all county students eligible to take the test 
went through the $575, six-week course. 
</P>
<P>
"Five years ago, we had 30 students," Kidder said. "Last year, 1,200 went 
through our course. That's a significant impact on the fact that the scores are 
going up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Change By Ethnic Group 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of high school students completing all courses required for 
admission to the University of California has increased for all the state's

ORANGE COUNTY'S RISING TEST SCORES 
</P>
<P>
Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT): 
</P>
<P>
The SAT includes a verbal section and a math section, each of which is scored 
on a scale of 200 to 800. The chart shows the percentage of seniors who took 
the test in 1984 and 1989 who achieved scores of at least 450 verbal and 500 
math. In general, those scores denote eligibility for admission to schools 
within the University of California and California State University systems. 
</P>
<P>
Completion of a-f Requirements: 
</P>
<P>
The a-f requirements are the courses required by the University of California 
for entrance to one of its schools. The courses include U.S. history, four 
years of English, three years of math, a laboratory science, two years of 
foreign language, and elective courses. The chart shows the percentages of high 
school students who completed the UC required course sequence upon graduation 
in 1985 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Advanced Placement (AP) Exams: 
</P>
<P>
AP exams are given in 24 academic subject areas such as biology, physics, 
French, calculus, music theory, and computer science. These tests are scored on 
a scale of 1 to 5. Generally, a score of 3 or better is considered passing. 
Students generally earn college credit on passing the exam. The chart shows the 
number of exams passed per 100 high school seniors.

FACE LIFTING PROCEEDS NEAR NIXON LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With less than two months to go before the July 19 opening of the Richard M. 
Nixon Library and Birthplace, the city is polishing its appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Changes include a $1.2-million beautification of Yorba Linda Boulevard, 
replacement of utility poles in the area with underground cables, and $103,300 
worth of landscaping to a riding trail that runs behind the library site. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Gene Wisner says the city needs to create a plan for additional 
improvements to the library area. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish there were a plan," he said. "The Nixon library is going to add a lot 
to our community. We just want to complement the library with the proper 
landscaping and so on." 
</P>
<P>
The most visible improvement is the Yorba Linda Boulevard Beautification 
Project, which began Feb. 1 and will be finished about June 15. Medians 
landscaped with small trees are being installed at intersections at Imperial 
Highway, Lakeview Avenue, Mountain View Avenue and Casa Loma Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Although council members expressed concern late last year over the increased 
traffic the library would bring, Wisner said officials are no longer worried. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people coming to the library will be tourists," he said. "They'll 
probably be staying around Disneyland, and this will be a side trip for them." 
</P>
<P>
Completion of the underground utility facilities, including buried cables to 
bring power to four houses in the area and the library complex, is expected 
later this month, Assistant City Engineer Fernando Saldivar said. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of that $10,000 project will be shared by the city and Southern 
California Edison Corp., with the city's share being about $5,000, said Roy 
Stephenson, director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
Although the project is part of a larger plan to place all the city's utility 
cables underground, Stephenson said the work in progress near the library site 
is being completed specifically to beautify the area by removing telephone 
poles within sight of the library. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the city's aversion to telephone poles goes so far that the City 
Council in March deadlocked on whether to ban the use of palm trees in 
landscaping because they resembled poles. 
</P>
<P>
Although no policy was adopted, the council directed City Manager Arthur C. 
Simonian to discourage developers from using palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing everything we can to get our utility poles underground," Wisner 
said. "Why have landscaping that looks like telephone poles?" 
</P>
<P>
The effort to beautify the riding trail behind the library began earlier this 
year and will take several years to complete because the landscaping is being 
installed one section at a time, Saldivar said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're primarily interested in making it a park setting," Wisner said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has also moved to shield the library from the effects of other 
development in the area. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the council unanimously defeated a zoning change that would have 
allowed a retirement community to be built across the street from the library. 
Several council members were reluctant to change the area's residential zoning 
out of fear that commercialization of the library might result. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a terrible thing to look across from the beautifully landscaped 
library and see storefronts with Nixonburgers and T-shirts," Councilman Mark 
Schwing said. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be the last place in the world we'd want to change our zoning," 
Wisner added. "We don't want to use the library as a draw for a commercial 
base." 
</P>
<P>
Although some Yorba Linda residents have complained about the ways the city has 
honored Nixon -- including making his birthday a city holiday -- Wisner said he 
has received only positive responses about the new library. 
</P>
<P>
"You wait for the negatives. A lot of people don't care for President Nixon," 
he said. "But that's not what we're hearing." LINDA M. HICKMAN

YOUTH SPORTS GROUPS LOOK FOR HOME FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the Ocean View Little League received word last year that it would have to 
find a new place to play its games, it was the last straw for Tom Duchene and 
Jim Ruziecki. 
</P>
<P>
Because the former Rancho View School site was scheduled to be developed, the 
league would have to move for the sixth time in its 30-year history. 
</P>
<P>
Duchene and Ruziecki, who help coordinate the league, decided that it needed a 
permanent home. And so in the last year, they organized a coalition of 12 youth 
groups facing the same problem and came up with a plan. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition is proposing a 17-acre, lighted youth sports complex in an 
undeveloped area of Huntington Central Park. The plan, which city staff 
officials have begun studying, would include six baseball diamonds and four 
soccer-football fields west of Golden West Street and Talbert Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
It would also end the roaming from place to place as former school sites are 
sold for development. 
</P>
<P>
"We have just gotten a little fed up with youth sports always winding up on the 
short end of things," said Duchene, the lead spokesman for the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the groups would lease the property from the city and split the 
operational costs. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal has the backing of Councilman Don MacAllister, and other council 
members agree such a facility is needed. But proponents of the $2-million 
complex face several major hurdles, including how to pay for the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Another worry is whether the targeted land can be developed into a series of 
sports fields. 
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, the area has twice been considered for similar sports 
facilities. Since then, City Council members have designated the region as a 
passive park, although "that could change," said Jim Engle, the city's parks 
and recreation superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
Also, if the park is used for the complex, it may be ineligible for certain 
state and federal park funds, Engle said. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Duchene said he believes that the city has "some responsibility" to 
provide a youth sports facility. 
</P>
<P>
"We're running out of places we can go to," he said. "The city has to address 
what they're going to do with all these kids running around." JOHN PENNER

<P>
COUNCILMAN URGES MORE AIDS SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the number of reported AIDS cases continuing to climb in Laguna Beach, 
Councilman Robert F. Gentry has suggested that an additional $10,000 of the 
next city budget be set aside for AIDS support organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach, where a total of 174 AIDS cases had been reported as of April 30, 
has by far the highest per capita incidence of AIDS in the county. Countywide, 
1,433 AIDS cases have been reported, or .56 cases per 1,000 people. In Laguna 
the rate is 6.66 per 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
The city has been criticized for offering so little money for AIDS services 
that agencies have become competitors for scarce funds instead of working 
cooperatively. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the city budget includes $40,000 to $50,000 in community assistance 
funds, which are split among a variety of organizations, from the Laguna Beach 
Community Clinic to the Chamber Music Society. But during preliminary budget 
discussions, Gentry said groups providing AIDS services should be set apart 
from the other groups because of the need they fill for the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than us opening up our own agency that would provide service to people 
with AIDS, it just seems smarter that we just support those that are already 
doing an excellent job for our residents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time you go to the federal government and the state government, you've 
lost people," added Gentry, whose own companion died last year of AIDS. "With 
the fact that we are in the middle of this AIDS crisis and we are one of the 
highest impacted cities in the state, it seems to me the organizations that 
take care of people with AIDS in Laguna Beach should not have to compete for 
those moneys." 
</P>
<P>
Gentry said the city should give additional financial support to the Laguna 
Beach Community Clinic, Laguna Shanti, the Ahimsa Foundation and the 
Irvine-based AIDS Services Foundation. The city's AIDS Education Task Force 
should recommend how the money is divided, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the city gave $2,900 to Laguna Shanti, $5,500 to the Laguna Beach 
Community Clinic and $1,000 to AIDS Walk Orange County, according to finance 
director Dick Reese. In addition, the education task force received $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
The final budget will be adopted during the June 19 City Council meeting, Reese 
said. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; 
</P>
<P>
SHE GIVES IT HER ALL FOR PROTOCOL 
</P>

Foreign visitors to Irvine ask the darndest things. 
</P>
<P>
Stella Cardoza knows. As the city employee in charge of protocol, Cardoza's job 
is to make visitors feel at ease. But sometimes she is asked things that make 
her feel downright on edge. 
</P>
<P>
Take the delegation from West Germany. While they were being entertained in an 
upstairs conference room with a commanding view of Irvine on three sides, they 
gazed out over miles of expensive Orange County real estate. They then asked 
Cardoza why all the homes looked alike. 
</P>
<P>
Cardoza, a budding diplomat, smiled as she recalled her answer. She cited 
economic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to develop, we have to have developed on a large scale," she said. 
"European cities developed over centuries. We developed in 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
That's not all visitors want to know. They want to know why they don't see 
people in the streets. They want to know how Irvine keeps the streets clean. 
They ask about sexism and human rights. They want to know where the blacks and 
Latinos are. 
</P>
<P>
"The Germans are really frank," she said. "They ask hard questions right away." 
</P>
<P>
Cardoza's job is unique to cities in Orange County. The county has a protocol 
office which works closely with cities to handle business meetings, tours and 
events for foreign dignitaries. But Irvine is the only city which appears to 
devote so much effort to the ever-sticky art of not offending guests. 
</P>
<P>
"Protocol? All it means is using good sense," Cardoza said. "If you're trying 
to do serious business, the effort is there not to offend." 
</P>
<P>
The work evolved into a job, Cardoza said, after she continually found herself 
setting up meetings with an increasing stream of visitors to the city. Cardoza 
was working in the Department of Planning and Community Development, arranging 
meetings with those who wanted to speak with the planners of the planned city. 
</P>
<P>
Cardoza, 51, who grew up in East Los Angeles, has arranged meetings with 
foreign emissaries and representatives of the Irvine Co. to discuss the 
intricacies of construction schedules. She has also set up round-table 
discussions with city officials and visiting political science professors, as 
well as sessions for visiting students. 
</P>
<P>
It's good for the city, she says, because it gives Irvine visibility. And 
visitors help to educate their hosts through shared experiences. 
</P>
<P>
"My position is not here to fill someone's itinerary on the way to Disneyland," 
she said. "It's a public service." 
</P>
<P>
Cardoza's job operates under the auspices of the city's International Affairs 
Program, a project pioneered by Mayor Larry Agran and criticized by his 
opponent in the upcoming mayoral election, Sally Anne Sheridan. Sheridan has 
said that the city should stop meddling in global affairs and worry about 
programs closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
Cardoza said protocol affairs take up 15% of her time, with the rest devoted to 
Irvine's sister-city programs. But she can easily tick off a few of the lessons 
she has learned. 
</P>
<P>
* Always take the business card of a Japanese visitor with two hands and treat 
it with reverence. In Japan, the business card is an extension of one's self. 
</P>
<P>
* Never give the standard Irvine present, a clock, to a visitor from China. The 
Chinese consider it an omen of death. 
</P>
<P>
* Never act in an informal manner with a visitor from Japan, unless he or she 
does so first. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't be unsettled if Japanese visitors close their eyes during a 
presentation. They are concentrating, not sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
She has had a few near-disasters, like the time a delegation of Koreans 
appeared on the city's doorstep unannounced. Cardoza said they were lucky she 
was able to throw together a meeting with a few dignitaries, including the 
mayor and an Irvine Co. executive. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, however, she knows about visits well in advance and asks visitors to 
submit their questions before they arrive, so she can find someone to answer 
them. DANICA KIRKA

TUSTIN FACES $4-MILLION POLICE-BRUTALITY SUIT; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: A MAN SAYS TWO OFFICERS BROKE HIS RIBS WHEN THEY RESPONDED TO A 
DOMESTIC-VIOLENCE CALL.

<P>
The city is facing a $4-million police brutality lawsuit filed by a man who 
claims two officers beat him with nightsticks and broke three of his ribs as 
other officers restrained his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Page, 50, claims that Officers Jeff Blair and Russell Whitehead beat 
him, resulting in a concussion and multiple bruises and scrapes. In court 
documents, attorneys for the city and Blair deny any wrongdoing. Whitehead is 
not specifically named in the lawsuit, which also accuses the city, the Police 
Department, the police chief and other officers of improper conduct. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Police Department suspended Whitehead for two weeks after the 
incident for not including in his report that he kicked Page, a police source 
said. Whitehead is appealing the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Blair and Whitehead arrived at the Page residence shortly after 5 p.m. Dec. 3, 
1989, in response to a domestic-violence call from Page's wife, Trudy. 
</P>
<P>
"He's never hit me, but he was being verbally abusive and had been drinking too 
much," Trudy Page said in an interview last week at Public Storage on Franklin 
Avenue, where the couple work as resident managers. "I hoped the police would 
come out and talk to him, calm him down." 
</P>
<P>
She said she had called police one other time within the past two years, and 
the officers talked to her husband for about 10 minutes, coaxing him to go 
upstairs to bed. 
</P>
<P>
According to police reports of the Dec. 3 incident, officers found Trudy Page 
outside on one side of the building and her husband on the other side with a 
bottle of brandy in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
Page, who admitted that he had been drinking, entered the building with the two 
officers, where he claims that he was brutally beaten on the head, ribs, back 
and legs. 
</P>
<P>
In police reports, Blair and Whitehead said that Page was yelling and that he 
resisted when they tried to search him for weapons, refusing to place his hands 
behind his back. They said they wanted to search him because Trudy Page had 
told the dispatcher that he had guns on the premises. According to police 
reports, a struggle ensued after Page refused to cooperate, and he fell against 
the wall, cutting his forehead on a metal cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Blair reported that Page then lunged toward Whitehead with his fists clenched. 
</P>
<P>
"Fearing for my safety, I drew my baton and struck Richard approximately five 
to six times," Whitehead wrote in his report. "Officer Blair immediately called 
for emergency assistance from additional units and also began to strike Richard 
with his baton." 
</P>
<P>
Page tells a different story. He said the officers forced him over a counter, 
handcuffed him and hit him on the head. But Page said they increased the force 
of the blows after he taunted them, saying, "I've got teen-age daughters can 
hit harder than that." 
</P>
<P>
Trudy Page corroborates her husband's story. She claims that she was restrained 
just outside the door by several other officers who responded to Blair's call 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
"I was screaming, 'Please don't kill my husband! Oh Lord, don't kill my 
husband!' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
After Page was handcuffed, police called for paramedics to take him to 
Healthcare Medical Center in Tustin, where he refused treatment. Officers then 
cited Page for assault and battery on a peace officer and released him. He has 
pleaded not guilty to the charge and is due back in court July 17. 
</P>
<P>
Page's civil suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, asks for at least 
$4 million in damages on grounds of deprivation of civil rights, excessive 
force and gross negligence. Page said he has been unable to work as a 
construction superintendent because a rib broken during the incident pops out 
of place if he bends over too much. 
</P>
<P>
Legal responses filed by attorneys for the city and Blair say the officers were 
using reasonable and necessary force and were acting in self-defense in their 
capacity as public employees. No one from the Police Department would comment 
on the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Because it's under litigation, we can't make any comment," Police Sgt. Brent 
Zicarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
"People who have been drinking too much and maybe have that kind of temperament 
can be pretty hard to deal with," City Atty. James Rourke said. "I'm sure if 
you listen to Mr. Page, you'd hear one story. If you listen to the officers, 
you'd hear another side." 
</P>
<P>
As for Whitehead's suspension, the police source said: "The chief indicated 
that he was suspending him for untruthfulness by omission because he didn't put 
in his report that he had kicked Mr. Page. The chief didn't say there was 
anything wrong with kicking Mr. Page, but he said omitting it from the report 
was an offense that merited a two-week suspension." 
</P>
<P>
The source said that it was unreasonable to expect an enumeration of each blow, 
kick and punch in the report.

GI KILLED IN PANAMA, OTHERS WHO GAVE LIVES HONORED

<P>
Despite overcast skies and chilling winds, more than 100 people gathered in a 
courtyard of the Civic Center Monday evening for a Memorial Day ceremony at the 
Orange County Veterans Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
Among those honored was Army Pfc. Roy Dennis Brown Jr., a 19-year-old Buena 
Park soldier who was killed last year during the first stage of the U.S. 
invasion of Panama. He was one of 23 U.S. soldiers to die in the fighting that 
led to the surrender of Panamanian dictator Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get a chance to attend his funeral so I wanted to come to something 
like this to pay my last respects to him," said Kelly Herald, a classmate of 
Brown at Magnolia High School in Anaheim. "He died for me and this country -- 
we can't forget that." 
</P>
<P>
In a welcoming address, Santa Ana City Councilman Richards L. Norton stressed 
that the 325 Orange County residents who have given their lives in wars over 
the decades did not do so in vain. 
</P>
<P>
"The price for freedom is a heavy burden for this country and the cost of the 
lives of loved ones can cast a shadow over our hearts," Norton said. "But we 
cannot measure freedom by dollars and cents. We pay the price with our hearts." 
</P>
<P>
Along with the traditional posting of the colors by cadets from the Mater Dei 
High School Air Force Junior ROTC, U.S. Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport 
Beach) read to the audience from the last letter written by Brown to his 
mother, Julie Otto. During the ceremony, Otto quietly wept as words of praise 
were spoken about her son. 
</P>
<P>
B.T. Collins, chief deputy state treasurer, said in a keynote address that he 
was dismayed with the portrayal of Vietnam veterans in the recent hit motion 
picture, "Born on the Fourth of July." Collins said the movie too often 
characterized veterans as angry, resentful and selfish. 
</P>
<P>
"It disturbs me to see that type of representation of veterans," said Collins, 
who fought there and was wounded. "Ninety percent of the men who went to 
Vietnam would do it again today. When I received my artificial leg and arm, it 
was a happy milestone; it meant I was on the road to recovery. We men weren't 
selfish -- we helped one another because we knew someone had helped us." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the ceremony a series of wreaths were laid at the memorial. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost my brother more than 20 years ago, and it still seems just like 
yesterday," said Florence Hurt of Huntington Beach. "But it's days like this 
one and events like this one that lets me know I don't cry alone."

GROWTH IS MAIN ISSUE IN GENTEEL CAMPAIGN FOR DANA POINT COUNCIL; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: CANDIDATES DISAGREE -- BUT POLITELY -- ON WHETHER OR NOT THE CITY 
SHOULD BE DEVELOPED AS A TOURIST DESTINATION.

DANA POINT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A growing dispute over the direction this small South County beach community 
should be taking as it moves into the 21st Century is perhaps best summed up by 
a campaign slogan. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you want a destination point or a Dana Point?" City Council candidate 
Thomas B. Moy asked during a recent speech to local business owners who had 
gathered to hear the seven candidates pitch their political wares. 
</P>
<P>
With a week left before voters go to the polls in the first City Council 
election since Dana Point was formed 17 months ago, the issue over whether the 
city should remain a bedroom community or become a world-class tourist resort 
has emerged as the major campaign topic. 
</P>
<P>
And, as the city is poised to begin drafting its general plan -- the blueprint 
for future development -- three of four challengers are hoping there is enough 
dissatisfaction over the city's growth to unseat at least one of the three 
incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
"Dana Point is going to look, I'm afraid, like Long Beach if we don't watch 
out," said optometrist William L. Petersen. "We moved here because we liked the 
small beach town atmosphere. The powers that be don't seem to be looking at it 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
Incumbents Mike Eggers, Eileen Krause and Ingrid McGuire face their first 
opposition since the city was incorporated in January, 1989. In addition to Moy 
and Petersen, they are being challenged by Harold Kaufman and Karen Lloreda. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one publicly acknowledges that some candidates are running as a 
slate, Eggers, Krause and Lloreda have received endorsements from the Coastal 
Taxpayers and the Dana Point Chamber of Commerce. Eggers and Krause are the 
only two to be endorsed by the South County Republican Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not running with anybody," Eggers said. "The slate is created by the 
(endorsing agencies) and not created by the candidates." 
</P>
<P>
Eggers, Orange County chief of staff for Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), is the 
only candidate to stress fiscal responsibility as the most important issue in 
the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
As such, he calls himself a "destination resort booster," saying that an 
increased emphasis on high-end tourism would bring much-needed tax dollars into 
the city coffers. 
</P>
<P>
"Out-of-town visitors are the cleanest industry we can have," said Eggers, who 
headed formation of an economic development commission early in his term as 
councilman. "When somebody comes here for a vacation, they are, in essence, 
paying for police protection, helping to pay for street maintenance. And yet 
they don't live here." 
</P>
<P>
McGuire is the only incumbent to call for strict limits on growth and tourism 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important for someone on the council to represent the majority of 
citizens," said McGuire, who has led efforts to increase the use of 
drought-resistant landscaping in the city as a way to conserve water. 
</P>
<P>
Other than the issue of growth and tourism, however, the campaign leading up to 
next Tuesday's election has been notable for its lack of major controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates have remained unusually cordial throughout the campaign, which 
has included three public forums sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce and the 
League of Women Voters. 
</P>
<P>
Even the challengers, who admit to an uphill battle for a council seat, say 
that they are proud to be running what can best be described as genteel 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always gone about our business in a very professional manner," said 
Kaufman, who lost his bid for a seat on the charter council in June, 1988, and 
now serves as chairman of the city's Planning Commission. "That attitude has 
been carried forward." 
</P>
<P>
Like Moy and Petersen, Kaufman said he believes the city has developed too 
fast. The council, he said, should have taken action, despite the fact that 
most development agreements were approved before the council members took 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman, who directs out-of-court settlements for a living, said that as a 
council member he would be able to act as a mediator between various interests. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, he would fight to keep large-scale development out of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Our density ought to be reduced," Kaufman said, adding that the city should 
allow only limited development on the Headlands, one of the last large, 
undeveloped coastal areas in the city, where several hotel complexes have been 
proposed in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have supported turning the 115-acre parcel into a billion-dollar 
resort as a way to help finance city services, including increased police 
protection, road improvements and a future City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Lloreda, president of the Capistrano Beach Community Assn. and the only 
candidate to live in that section of the city, has joined incumbent Krause in 
urging stronger anti-drug and anti-gang programs. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents in the Capistrano Beach business district, where Lloreda enjoys 
her strongest support, have complained that police have been unable to stem 
crime in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
They have complained that drugs are sold openly in alleyways, frightening 
potential customers and threatening the quality of life in Capistrano Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"These people feel that the problems have gone too far," Lloreda said. "Some of 
them are ready to close up shop." 
</P>
<P>
Lloreda, a supporter of revitalization in the aging business district, said 
that the council needs a Capistrano Beach representative to ensure that future 
redevelopment projects benefit the community. 
</P>
<P>
"Capistrano Beach can offer the city of Dana Point a lot, but it has to be 
carefully done," Lloreda said. 
</P>
<P>
Krause, the city's current mayor, said that besides developing the general 
plan, establishing a workable redevelopment project and controlling traffic, 
one of the most important issues facing voters in this election is stemming 
drug and gang activity in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
She said that the current council has been facing all those issues and will 
continue to do so if left intact. 
</P>
<P>
"We've set the tone of (the city's future) as a council," Krause said. "We have 
set the tone of professionalism. Everyone is comfortable with the way things 
are going. Even the ones that disagree with us are supportive." 
</P>
<P>
Krause said that the lack of a more vocal campaign is proof that the honeymoon 
period with the current council is continuing. Even the challengers, she said, 
have not come up with any strong criticisms of the present council. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we all want the same thing," Krause said. "We want the city to be the 
best city it can be."

BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: PARLIN ISN'T STRONGEST, BUT HE'S BEST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In an event often seen as a test of brute strength, shotputter Mark Parlin 
isn't the strongest. In fact, Parlin has two teammates on Esperanza High 
School's track and field team who are more powerful. 
</P>
<P>
But Parlin is the best shotputter in the Southern Section, and he proved it 
again Friday, winning the event at the Southern Section Masters meet with a 
throw of 60 feet 3 1/2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Parlin, The Times' Athlete of the Week, also finished fourth in the discus 
(175-4) and qualified in both events for the state championships Friday and 
Saturday at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Such success for Parlin, a junior, is somewhat of a surprise, says Esperanza 
assistant coach Bill Pendleton. Parlin won the Empire League's frosh-soph 
championship in the shotput last season, breaking the school and league records 
by two feet with his final throw. Parlin, 6 feet 1 and 220 pounds, has gained 
about 30 pounds and significant strength since football season. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton said Parlin's athletic ability -- which helped him earn second-team 
all-league honors as a running back -- his work in the weight room and a new 
spinning technique have combined to improve his throws by more than 10 feet 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he would be a good thrower, but I'd be lying if I said I thought he'd 
go 60 feet," said Pendleton, who is also the strength coach for the Aztec 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, he's throwing just about where I thought he would as a 
senior." 
</P>
<P>
In the state meet, Parlin will get another chance to compete against Brent Noon 
of Fallbrook High, who has thrown 76-2 this season, the second-best all-time 
mark on the high school level. 
</P>
<P>
When Parlin and Noon met in an invitational meet earlier this season, Noon won 
by 20 feet. Parlin has thrown 61-4, the second-best mark in the state this 
year, and though he has thrown a few feet farther in warm-ups, Parlin isn't 
expecting any surprises. 
</P>
<P>
"It's cool to see a guy throw that far when he's that young, but I'm not trying 
to beat him," Parlin said. "I'm just trying to get second in state, basically." 
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Carlson (6-9 3/4), Katella high jumper, Magnolia triple jumper Phouphet 
Singbandith (49-8 1/2) and Dana Hills discus thrower Andy Marrone (184-1) each 
won his event at the Masters meet and qualified for the state meet Friday and 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Dawkins pitched a no-hitter and hit a home run -- his second of the 
playoffs -- to lead La Quinta to a 1-0 victory over El Monte in a Southern 
Section 3-A second-round playoff game Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Hansen-Dent of Newport Harbor defeated Ari Nathan of Brentwood, 3-6, 6-0, 
6-3, to win the Southern Section singles tennis title Saturday. Mater Dei's 
Jason Harnett and Adam Jarrett won the Southern Section doubles tournament 
Saturday, defeating Sean McKenna and Derek Shinden of Thousand Oaks, 7-5, 7-6 
(7-4). 
</P>
<P>
Marc Newfield of Marina hit solo home runs in each of the Vikings' 5-A playoff 
victories last week. He homered in the third inning of a 3-1 victory over 
Esperanza Tuesday and in the third inning of a 4-0 victory over Mater Dei 
Friday.

<P>
Cecilio Guante threw 16 pitches and won the game. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Jones faced three batters and picked up his 16th save. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Black threw 132 pitches and got only the privilege of showering in the 
winning clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Black carried the Cleveland Indians for eight innings Monday before they 
climbed off the back of a tired man and finished their triumph without him. 
</P>
<P>
Black shut out the Angels for eight innings, giving up only six hits. All the 
while, Jim Abbott was shutting out Cleveland over nine innings. 
</P>
<P>
Black gave way to Guante, but Abbott stayed in the game. The scoreless tie 
lasted until the 10th inning, when Brook Jacoby singled home the winning run. 
Cory Snyder's two-run home run, the third of three 10th-inning hits Abbott 
allowed, provided the final runs in Cleveland's 3-0 victory at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Bud threw well for eight innings and kept us right in there," Jacoby said. 
</P>
<P>
Black wasn't there for the spoils, but said he didn't mind. 
</P>
<P>
"No . . . " he said, drawing out the word. "That's all part of it. You like to 
finish what you start. You'd like to get a win. But we won, and that's the 
bottom line for us. 
</P>
<P>
"Any win is a big one. I was just trying to hold 'em down." 
</P>
<P>
Black realized soon what kind of game lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"Watching Abbott, he had great rhythm and was throwing strikes," Black said. "I 
could tell early on it was going to be a tough one." 
</P>
<P>
Black, who has been the Indians' most consistent pitcher this season, faced a 
team that has averaged more than six runs in its past seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Behind him was a team that ranked 10th in the American League in scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a pitcher whose 1.94 earned-run average ranks among the major league 
leaders, as do his 76 1/3 innings pitched. But Black has four no-decisions in 
10 starts, and his record is 4-2 -- including a 2-1 loss to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the lack of action on the Indians' basepaths, he kept Cleveland 
poised to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
Five times, the Angels put runners in scoring position against Black. Five 
times, they failed to score. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a couple of situations there where I really had to bear down and 
use my head," Black said. "When guys are swinging the bat like they are, you 
can't go out and rely on stuff. You've got to make pitches in situations." 
</P>
<P>
Each time, he got the better of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Black had runners on first and second with two out in the third, and then 
struck out Johnny Ray on three pitches. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth, the Angels put runners on second and third with two out. Black 
was facing Lance Parrish, who had a .310 career average against him and had 
homered in each of his last two games. 
</P>
<P>
"A tight ball game like that, it comes down to one or two pitches," Black said. 
</P>
<P>
He got Parrish to ground out to short, ending another scoring threat. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very smart today," said Parrish, who finished the day zero for four, 
ending a five-game hitting streak. 
</P>
<P>
Black squelched another Angel attempt to score in the seventh. After giving up 
a one-out double to Donnie Hill, he got Gary DiSarcina to fly to center, 
bringing up Devon White. Black fell behind in the count 2-0. It went to 3-1, 
and then to a full count before he sent White down swinging. 
</P>
<P>
But the most critical showdown was between Black and Dante Bichette, the owner 
of a 456-foot home run off Black in Cleveland last Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Black had not forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"That ball almost landed in Lake Erie," Black said. "It was one of the farthest 
balls ever hit in Cleveland Stadium." 
</P>
<P>
Black got Bichette out on a ground ball the first time he faced him Sunday, and 
gave up a single the second time. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth inning, with two out and runners on first and second, he got 
Bichette to hit into a fielder's choice to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth, Bichette came up with two out and runners on first and second. 
</P>
<P>
Black fell behind in the count, 3-1, and then came back to get Bichette to 
strike out swinging. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to get him out," Black said. "One or two bad pitches, and 
they could score some runs." 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't Jim Abbott know it.

OPTICAL COMPUTING COULD STEP UP THE MOVEMENT OF DATA

If you imagine a freeway where cars could pass through each other and make the 
traffic jam obsolete, you would have a pretty good idea of what AT&amp;T Bell 
Laboratories researchers were raving about last week at a laser and electronics 
conference at the Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
Like congested freeways, traditional electronic computers -- which use 
electrons as the basic messenger that carries data within the computer -- bog 
down because only so many pieces of data, or cars, can pass through 
communication lanes without running into each other. 
</P>
<P>
With optical computing, a futuristic technology that is being studied by Bell 
Labs and Japanese researchers, the physical barrier creating the jams could 
vanish, said David Miller, head of AT&amp;T Bell Labs' photonic switching 
research in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Miller was one of several researchers who discussed the potential of optical 
computing at the Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics, which drew about 
7,000 scientists and technicians to Anaheim last week. 
</P>
<P>
Optical computing uses packets of light, or photons, as the basic messengers to 
carry data within a computer. Unlike electrons, light particles are not subject 
to electrical interference and can pass through each other and deliver their 
data unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
The light beams themselves can be theoretically controlled using tiny mirrors 
and prisms in ways that could mimic basic electronic components such as 
transistors and resistors. 
</P>
<P>
Used in combinations that take advantage of both electronic and optical 
technology, computers of the future could reach performance levels a thousand 
times better than current supercomputers, Miller and other researchers believe. 
Such performance levels could yield a new generation of products such as video 
phones, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, along with fellow Bell Labs researcher Alan Huang, believes that 
optical computing has gained legitimacy in the past year as a viable path 
toward creating the next generation of supercomputers. 
</P>
<P>
Once derided as hopelessly complicated, optical computers could be used to 
develop much-faster telephone switches by 1995, Miller said. AT&amp;T first 
demonstrated an optical transistor in 1986, and in January it unveiled its 
first optical microchip. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics of optical computers believe that conventional electronic-computing 
methods, when combined with new computer architectures, is a more practical 
approach to building faster computers. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Active Memory Technology Inc. in Irvine is building computers 
that incorporate a technology known as "parallel processing," in which many 
processors are linked together to perform certain calculations faster than a 
conventional computer using a single, central processor. 
</P>
<P>
With this approach, a computer can reach higher speeds by adding more "brains," 
or processors, like breaking a traffic jam at a toll bridge by adding more 
lanes and toll booths to process the traffic.

COPYRIGHT: NEWSLETTERS ARE HAVING A BIG PROBLEM WITH SUBSCRIBERS' MAKING FREE 
PHOTOCOPIES OF THEIR PRICEY PERIODICALS. ONE CORPORATION JUST AGREED TO PAY A 
$100,000 SETTLEMENT.

<P>
Don't even think about making a copy of this story to pass around the office. 
</P>
<P>
In what may be the largest settlement of its kind, an unidentified major 
corporation has agreed to pay more than $100,000 to an Arlington, Va., 
newsletter publisher for violating the publisher's copyright by circulating 
photocopies of a newsletter to its employees. 
</P>
<P>
The publisher, Washington Business Information Inc., declined Thursday to name 
the offending company. Washington Business Information publishes 11 
newsletters, including Product Safety Letter, Hazardous Materials 
Transportation, Plastic Waste Strategies and Devices and Diagnostics Letter. 
</P>
<P>
Washington Business Information also would not say which of its newsletters was 
involved nor discuss the size of the settlement, citing a confidentiality 
agreement included in the settlement. But the publisher said it had received a 
sum in six figures, and others in the industry said they couldn't remember a 
settlement that large in other, similar cases. 
</P>
<P>
Photocopying is one of the banes of the newsletter industry. Subscribers 
frequently attempt to evade subscription prices that can run hundreds of 
dollars a year by buying a single subscription to a newsletter and making 
dozens of photocopies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not unusual for major industrial companies or major law firms to take one 
copy of a newsletter and make 30 or 40 copies of it and pass it around," said 
David Swit, president of Washington Business Information. 
</P>
<P>
"It's self-evident that a newsletter consisting of relatively few pages is 
particularly vulnerable to unauthorized copying," said Arthur Scheiner, a 
Washington attorney who has handled copyright-violation cases for some members 
of the Washington area's huge community of newsletter publishers. "I'd guess 
that it's rather frequently done." 
</P>
<P>
Some publishers estimate that unauthorized copying cuts potential revenue by as 
much as one-third. Most newsletters include warnings against copying, and some 
publishers even offer rewards for information about illegal copying. Federal 
law allows statutory damages of up to $100,000 and legal fees for unauthorized 
copying, plus possible criminal liability. 
</P>
<P>
"Copying of newsletters is possibly the largest problem in the newsletter 
industry," said Albert Warren, founder and head of Warren Publishing, a 
Washington newsletter publisher whose newsletters include Communications Daily. 
Warren, who founded the Independent Newsletter Assn., a trade group, in part to 
combat newsletter copying, is awaiting the outcome of a 5-year-old, $3-million 
suit against the U.S. Telephone Assn. for alleged unauthorized copying of 
Communications Daily. 
</P>
<P>
As is common in many such cases, Washington Business Information was tipped off 
to the violation by an employee of the company that was doing the copying. Swit 
said the company was making "umpteen" copies rather than paying the 
subscription price, which is $500 for the first copy and $250 for each 
additional copy. Swit said his company negotiated a settlement without filing a 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials say most violations of copyright laws are settled, usually 
with companies making cash payments and agreeing to buy additional 
subscriptions. Warren said his company has entered into several hundred 
thousand dollars worth of settlements over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's astonishing what organizations will cheat that way," Swit said. 
"Strangely, some of the most egregious violators of our copyright are lawyers."

When Steven Spielberg brought his movie production company to the small eastern 
Washington towns of Sprague and Moses Lake for the filming of "Always," he had 
planned to stay less than a week. 
</P>
<P>
But after seeing the diversity of the landscape and the possibilities for the 
film, he wound up staying 20 days. 
</P>
<P>
The story of Spielberg's discovery of Washington is becoming a common one, and 
Hollywood moguls, television crews and producers of commercials are turning the 
state into one of the most popular spots in the country for filming. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look back at the state's history, there were some years when there was 
a lot (of film production) going on," said Lynn Murphy, assistant manager in 
the state's Department of Trade and Economic Development's Film &amp; Video 
Office. "But our reputation as a film center has really grown in the past three 
or four years." 
</P>
<P>
The Film &amp; Video Office recently released statistics showing a dramatic 
jump in the money spent by out-of-state production companies. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985 a total of $5.5 million in direct spending was generated by 
out-of-state film companies. A spate of commercials boosted that number to $12 
million -- a 118% increase -- in 1986. In 1987 and 1988 the total grew to $14 
million and $16.9 million respectively, and last year production companies 
spent $20.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Feature films such as "Always" brought the most income to the state in 1989, 
with producers spending $10.8 million. Direct spending by commercial production 
companies was $7.6 million, while documentary, industrial, television and other 
projects brought in $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
In-state production companies have also grown significantly, contributing $33.7 
million last year to the state economy, a 48% increase over 1988's spending. 
</P>
<P>
In all, last year there were 14 feature films and television movies made in the 
state; 27 video and television episodes; more than 80 commercials; and about 37 
industrial videos, documentaries and other projects. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any hard numbers right now, but I am confident we are in the top 
10 production states based on the number of film days and the dollars spent on 
production," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
In-state companies obviously know what the state has to offer, but what is the 
attraction for out-of-state producers? 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said one big plus is the availability of experienced crew staffers -- 
such as gaffers, camera people, special effects and wardrobe experts. 
</P>
<P>
"That means producers don't have to bring in a lot of people and pay for their 
housing and per diem expenses, so they can really keep their production costs 
down," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Just as important, however, is the combination of terrain that offers virtually 
any kind of landscape needed -- from seascapes to mountains to deserts, from 
small farm communities to All-American suburbs to sprawling urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past when you said Washington state people thought just of forests. But 
they're finding there's a lot more," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
" 'I Love You to Death' needed a Pennsylvania coal mining town, and it was 
filmed in Tacoma. 'The Fabulous Baker Boys' wanted seedy night spots, so we 
found them in downtown Seattle. 'The Hunt for Red October' was filmed in Port 
Angeles, Bremerton and around Puget Sound -- they needed a lot of water. 
</P>
<P>
" 'War of the Roses' wanted a New England setting but didn't want to go to New 
England, so we took them to Coupeville," Murphy said. "We do New England very 
well."

DMV TIPS STEER REFUGEES ON RIGHT PATH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Thuy Nguyen was born during the depths of the Vietnam War, reared in a land of 
unrest and squalor. She ultimately fled the Communist-held country with her 
family, arriving in the United States just a few months ago and settling in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Now the 24-year-old immigrant faces a challenge nearly as daunting to her as 
the struggles in her homeland. She is learning to drive a car. 
</P>
<P>
Through war and revolution, Nguyen never had an opportunity to turn an ignition 
key. And it shows. Though eager to get a driver's license, the bespectacled 
refugee admits to having some qualms when she straps on a seat belt and grips 
the steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
"Driving a car is very difficult," Nguyen said one recent day in halting 
English. "I am afraid of freeways. Too fast. Very fast." 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen's anxiety over encountering the highways and byways of America is hardly 
unique. Driving a car on the traffic-choked roads and freeways of Orange County 
can be trying for even the most steely nerved native, but for recent arrivals 
from places like Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, it can be a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to help such immigrants, the state Department of Motor Vehicles has 
begun a special effort to lower the language barriers and to better teach 
foreign newcomers on the laws and nuances of the highway. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed the "cultural outreach program," it features a series of videotapes and 
booklets in nearly a dozen languages covering a variety of topics, including 
basic rules of the road, the necessity of buying insurance, the evils of drunk 
driving, what to do if an accident occurs and how to negotiate the twists and 
turns of a DMV office. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these people literally stepped out of the 18th Century and into the 
20th Century when they came here," said Gary Quinliven, the program's 
coordinator. "Many of them have no idea of the rules of the road. Some have not 
even seen a car, at least never on the scale as we have it here." 
</P>
<P>
Although the program began in late 1989, DMV officials estimate it has already 
helped more than 1 million people in the state. A dozen other states, including 
New York, are studying the California program to determine if they should 
launch similar efforts. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 school districts in California use the video series in courses for 
newcomers. Among them is the Los Angeles Unified School District, which shows 
the tapes in nearly 400 English language classes. 
</P>
<P>
The series is also regularly aired in English and foreign-language versions by 
about 100 cable TV outlets in California and five Spanish-speaking commercial 
TV stations, DMV officials say. In addition, the tapes have been played at 
several refugee centers in Thailand and the Philippines for immigrants destined 
for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
While the program initially focused on Southeast Asian languages, it was later 
expanded to include Spanish, two Armenian tongues, and Mandarin, Cantonese and 
Tagalog (the language of the Philippines). 
</P>
<P>
"These people have a different language than we have, they're trying to learn 
how to get a job, get a place to live, how to shop in our markets, how to get 
along in our world," Quinliven said. "What we wanted to do was make it as easy 
as possible to get into the world of driving a car." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there exists a fundamental urgency for many of the newcomers to get a 
driver's license. With its sprawling suburbs and dearth of public 
transportation, Southern California can represent an imposing challenge for a 
newcomer without a car. 
</P>
<P>
"Learning to drive is very important for refugees," said Loc Ba Nguyen, refugee 
coordinator for the Vietnamese Community of Orange County Inc. "They know they 
need a car. Orange County is very limited as far as public transportation, so 
everyone wants to have a car." 
</P>
<P>
But the very act of driving can pose an awkward adjustment for immigrants. 
Adults who have never commanded a car must learn a whole new system of eye and 
muscle coordination. Newcomers from crowded foreign cities, meanwhile, 
sometimes import motoring habits hardly in line with the California Vehicle 
Code. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of these people just don't have a lot of experience driving," said Lt. 
Michael Schliskey, police traffic commander in Westminster, which has a sizable 
Vietnamese population. 
</P>
<P>
Although the DMV is reluctant to break down motorist information along ethnic 
lines, Schliskey said studies by his department indicate that in recent years 
nearly three of four accidents in the city involve refugees from Indochina. The 
bulk of those, he said, are in the Little Saigon section of Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows the foibles and fears of such refugee drivers quite as well as 
Michael Vo Duc Minh. Owner of the Little Saigon Traffic School and an auto 
insurance agency, Vo deals firsthand with many of the problems of the immigrant 
motorist. 
</P>
<P>
"It just takes time for them to adjust," said Vo, who came to the United States 
in 1980 and started his traffic school last summer. "It's not that the laws are 
all that much different, it's just that people's attitudes are different." 
</P>
<P>
In Vietnam, for instance, many motorists would routinely start through a red 
light when the signal on a cross street turns yellow, he said. Such a practice 
in the United States promises only to result in the refugee driver running 
afoul of the law -- or running into another car. 
</P>
<P>
Vo said his classes, which are held in Vietnamese and serve people trying to 
work traffic citations off their driving record, typically end up becoming 
sessions on rudimentary rules of the road. "Basically, we teach people from A 
to Z about traffic law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the sessions, which have been attended by more than 1,500 people, he 
regularly uses the videotapes and booklets provided by the DMV. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the program," Vo said. "It reviews all the basic law that people need 
to know and it's done beautifully in their own language." His only complaint is 
that the translator has an accent "from the extreme north" of Vietnam, making 
it sound akin to "doing a Texas accent for an instructional tape that's shown 
in New York." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Loc Ba Nguyen has found the DMV videos helpful for refugee seminars 
at the Vietnamese Community of Orange County. But he said the program is not 
nearly intensive enough for people who are driving for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Many newcomers, he said, end up trying to learn the mechanics of driving a car 
from friends who arrived before them, and the friends are typically 
ill-equipped to serve as instructors. 
</P>
<P>
Phong Nguyen, 24, knows the trials and tribulations of a driving test. He came 
to the United States earlier this year with his mother and immediately set 
about trying to get his license, taking lessons from a private instructor for 
$15 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
The written test was "no problem," he said, but the road test proved more 
difficult. He flunked three times, but the fourth proved a charm. Two weeks 
ago, Nguyen scored a 78% and got his license. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very important to have my license to find a job in the future," Nguyen 
said through a translator. "I feel joyful and happy to have my license."

REAGANS, GORBACHEVS TO MEET

<TEXT>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan, who once called the Soviet Union an evil empire 
and challenged President Mikhail S. Gorbachev three years ago to tear down the 
Berlin Wall, will meet the Soviet leader in San Francisco next Monday, Reagan's 
office said today. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's wife, Nancy, and Raisa Gorbachev, wife of Gorbachev, will also attend 
the breakfast meeting, to be held at the home of the Soviet consul general in 
San Francisco, Reagan's office said. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the Reagans and the Gorbachevs was at first expected to 
take place in the Soviet Consulate itself. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials visited Reagan aides in Los Angeles two weeks ago and 
suggested the site for a meeting. But Reagan aides were said to have regarded 
the Consulate, technically Soviet territory, as not an ideal meeting place. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting at the residence is apparently a compromise, local diplomatic 
sources said.

BRAUDE URGES TOTAL SMOKING BAN IN ALL L.A. RESTAURANTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilman Marvin Braude, in a bid to protect nonsmoking diners from 
secondhand smoke, proposed today that Los Angeles become the first major city 
in the nation to ban smoking in all restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The city, whose 3.5 million residents endure the nation's worst air, already 
has a 2-year-old law that requires restaurants with 50 or more seats to set 
aside 50% of their tables for nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a recent report at the World Conference on Lung Health, which estimated 
that 32,000 people die each year due to exposure to secondhand smoke, Braude 
said "the time has come" for a complete smoking ban at all restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most publicized prohibition against smoking in restaurants was 
adopted in 1987 by Beverly Hills, but under pressure from restaurateurs, the 
city's lawmakers later weakened the law, allowing restaurants to set up smoking 
sections for up to 50% of their customers. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred municipalities require nonsmoking areas in restaurants, but 
only the resort community of Aspen, Colo., has a complete ban, Braude said.

Norway today scrapped rules giving royal sons first rights to the throne, 
abolishing one of the last bastions of male dominance in a country that prides 
itself on equal rights for women. 
</P>
<P>
Only seven members of the 165-member Parliament voted against the amendment, 
the Norwegian news agency NTB reported. 
</P>
<P>
But the current Princess Martha Louise, 18, will not precede her younger 
brother Prince Haakon Magnus, 16, in the line of succession because the rule 
applies only to royal heirs born after 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Both the prince and princess are children of Crown Prince Harald, the son of 
King Olav, who at 86 is Europe's oldest reigning monarch. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, the Socialist Left Party revived a parliamentary proposal to 
abolish the monarchy upon King Olav's death. But only 19 votes were cast in 
favor of making Norway a republic.

U.S. CHANGES POLICY, BACKS U.N. OBSERVERS FOR GAZA, WEST BANK

The State Department said today that the United States will support sending a 
U.N. team of observers to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to 
report on the human rights situation. 
</P>
<P>
The statement, by spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, was described by her as a 
shift in the previously declared U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the United States "would 
be prepared to discuss" a U.N. delegation, without defining the size or mission 
of the group. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler said today that U.S. support will be limited to a small delegation 
under the mandate of the U.N. Security Council or the secretary general, 
similar to the mission to Israel led by Marrack Goulding, a U.N. official, in 
January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Israeli government said Israel will oppose any U.N. 
presence as an infringement on Israeli sovereignty as an occupying power. A 
spokeswoman for the Israeli Embassy in Washington said she wants to study the 
Tutwiler statement before commenting on the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N Security Council, back in New York after hearing a statement by 
Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat, is expected to take 
up the matter later today. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler also said the statements by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, in which 
he once again vowed to use chemical weapons against Israel in case of an 
Israeli attack.

HARVARD PRESIDENT BOK RESIGNS AFTER 20 YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: HE BROADENED THE UNIVERSITY'S REPUTATION AND ENDOWMENT DURING STORMY

<P>
Harvard University President Derek C. Bok, who during two tumultous decades 
broadened both the reputation and endowment at the nation's oldest university, 
today announced his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't yet had time to think about what to do next," Bok said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Bok, who became president in 1971, said that "it is time for me to step down 
and allow a new president to provide fresh energy and continuity of leadership 
through the next decade." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Costa, a spokesman for the university, said he could not elaborate on 
Bok's reasons for the resignation, which will take effect at the end of the 
1990-91 academic year. 
</P>
<P>
Bok, a Stanford University graduate, earned a law degree from Harvard in 1954. 
He joined the Harvard Law School faculty in 1958 and became dean of the school 
in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Bok, 60, is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and author 
of several books, including one on labor law that he wrote with Watergate 
prosecutor Archibald Cox. 
</P>
<P>
During his tenure as Harvard's president, Bok established both the John F. 
Kennedy School of Government and revived an undergraduate core curriculum based 
on the study of classics. 
</P>
<P>
Bok often made headlines with his conservative views on education and business, 
including a controversial stand against a movement for total divestment of the 
university's holdings in stocks of companies doing business in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Among his challenges, he headed the school during sometimes violent 
anti-Vietnam War demonstrations, and negotiated over the years with black 
students and professors arguing for better minority representation. 
</P>
<P>
But most of Bok's efforts were low-key as he worked behind the scenes to 
maintain traditions at Harvard, which celebrated its 350th anniversary in 1986 
and has one of the nation's richest endowments. 
</P>
<P>
There had been wide speculation in academic circles that Bok would step down 
following the celebration marking the Cambridge institution's founding. 
</P>
<P>
Bok is the son of a Pennsylvania Supreme Court judge, and his grandmother was 
the daughter of H. K. Curtis, founder of Curtis Publishing Co., which published 
the Saturday Evening Post. 
</P>
<P>
He married Sissela Myrdal, the daughter of Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal, 
in 1955. He and his wife, who has a doctorate in philosophy from Harvard and 
teaches at Brandeis University, have three children.

Vandals destroyed and splattered blood on portions of an anti-abortion display

About 1,500 crosses had been constructed and placed in the field by about 40 
people who wanted passing motorists traveling during the Memorial Day weekend 
to think about why legal abortions should be halted. 
</P>
<P>
Doris Johnson, the field's owner, said today about 300 crosses had been either 
pulled up or destroyed and a sign containing anti-abortion messages in the 
middle of the display had been partially uprooted and splattered with blood. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was alerted to the vandalism by passing veterans, who were upset with 
the vandalism because they thought it was a Memorial Day display.

The Justice Department today asked the independent counsel investigating former 
Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. to expand his investigation after fresh 
allegations of political favoritism at the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh made the request in a May 25 letter to independent

A copy of the letter was released today by the Justice Department after it was 
received by Adams.

In his letter, Thornburgh asked the court-appointed independent counsel to 
review allegations of favoritism in the operation of the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development's Urban Development Action Grant Program and the 
Secretary's Discretionary Fund for technical assistance and special projects. 
</P>
<P>
The request was based on a review of testimony recently given to a House 
subcommittee by DuBois Gilliam, former deputy assistant HUD secretary for 
program policy development and evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
Adams was appointed by a special court earlier this year to investigate 
allegations that Pierce and top aides defrauded the government by awarding 
grants on the basis of political favoritism between 1984 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats in Congress have repeatedly asked Thornburgh to expand the scope of 
Adams' jurisdiction.

DE KLERK DELAYS VISIT TO U.S.; BLAMES TIMING

President Frederik W. de Klerk said today he has postponed his visit to the 
United States next month because of a controversy over the timing of his 
meeting with President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the White House nor the South African government had announced a date 
for the meeting, but it reportedly had been set for June 18. 
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress and others complained a meeting on that date with 
De Klerk would be a snub to ANC leader Nelson R. Mandela, who is due to arrive 
in the United States on June 20. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk and Mandela have said they don't care which one meets with Bush first. 
But many ANC representatives and some black American leaders have said Bush 
should not meet with De Klerk at all until South Africa's apartheid system is 
dismantled. It has been more than 30 years since a South African head of 
government has visited the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela has criticized De Klerk's handling of violence in the province of 
Natal, saying the government has not done enough to stem the violence. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk's move today appeared aimed at staving off friction on another front. 
</P>
<P>
"Due to a controversy that has arisen in the United States as regards the 
possible timing of my visit in June, and also because certain important matters 
would require my personal attention during the next few weeks, I have decided 
to postpone my visit to the United States," he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush made it clear that I would be welcome at any time. He stands by 
his invitation and I will follow it up later, at a time when it can make a 
positive contribution to our mutual relations," De Klerk added. 
</P>
<P>
The South African president returned Saturday from an 18-day visit to nine 
European nations, where he met with leaders and explained his plans to end 
apartheid and give the voteless black majority a voice in running the 
government.

Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. said today Chairman William Jovanovich has 
resigned and former U.S. Energy Secretary John S. Herrington has been elected 
to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
The 70-year-old Jovanovich had guided the development of the Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
-based publishing company during a career that spanned more than 43 years and 
saw the company's revenue grow to $1.3 billion from $8 million in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
He engineered a costly recapitalization of Harcourt in 1987 that enabled the 
company to avoid a takeover by British media baron Robert Maxwell. 
</P>
<P>
But the resulting heavy debt prompted the company to sell its theme park 
business a year ago for $1.1 billion, which was below what some analysts had 
thought it could get for the business. 
</P>
<P>
The company recently acknowledged it was in talks to sell unspecified 
additional assets. It announced May 9 that those talks had been terminated. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its publishing operations, Harcourt has interests in the 
insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
The company said in a statement that Jovanovich also had submitted his 
resignation as chairman of the company's executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
He will be replaced in that position by his son, Peter Jovanovich, who became 
chief executive and president of the company last December. 
</P>
<P>
Herrington has served as a member of the Harcourt board since May, 1989, and 
has served on its executive and finance committees. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Jovanovich was quoted as saying, "Forty-three years is enough, 
especially since I now can devote my time to editing books and writing them." 
</P>
<P>
Herrington called Jovanovich "an American publishing legend, a pioneer in 
educational technology and an industry giant who built the best independent 
publishing house in America." 
</P>
<P>
"While I cannot replace this Renaissance man, I intend to work to build upon 
HBJ's outstanding successes," he said.

EC, JAPAN MEET TO DISCUSS TRADE DEFICIT

The European Community and Japan met today at a high level for the first time 
in 3 1/2 years to try to clear the air between the two trading giants, EC 
officials and diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
The community is running a huge and persistent trade deficit with Japan, its 
second-biggest supplier after the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The deficit of the community can only be reduced significantly if EC exports 
to Japan grow 2 1/2 times as fast as Japanese exports to the EC," an EC 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of 1989, EC exports to Japan amounted to just 44.9% of 
its imports -- still worse than the whole of 1979, when the ratio stood at 
45.5%. 
</P>
<P>
The community is also concerned about the quality and quantity of Japan's 
investment in its 12 nations. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese have been investing heavily in both manufacturing capacity and 
financial services in the community to guarantee themselves a springboard for 
reaching 320 million consumers in the post-1992 EC single market. 
</P>
<P>
Figures from Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry put Japan's 
investment in the EC at the end of March last year at $30.164 billion, against 
only $3.013 billion for the community in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The world's three mighty trading powers have recently been conferring in pairs 
to try to defuse trade tensions. The United States and the EC recently set up 
formal structures to guarantee a closer working relationship, with twice-yearly 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-EC alliance was actually behind what Japan and the EC had set up on 
similar lines long ago. But Japan has been unable to keep its dates with the 
community since 1986 because of internal political wrangling. 
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting, bringing together Japanese International Trade and Industry 
Minister Kabun Muto and Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama with the EC's 
commissioner for trade, Frans Andriessen, is symbolically important, whatever 
it yields. 
</P>
<P>
"It's symbolic of a new, close relationship, though in technician's terms, it 
won't necessarily cut much ice," one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said the talks are likely to focus on the potential for changing 
the situation to the community's advantage. But the most sensitive issue of all 
-- terms for Japanese car imports after 1992 -- is unlikely to be explored in 
depth.

An agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union that could triple 
the number of airline passengers between the two countries will be signed at 
this week's summit meeting, a U.S. official said today. 
</P>
<P>
About 140,000 passengers flew between the two countries in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
With increasingly flexible Soviet travel restrictions under President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev, Soviet travelers on the U.S.-Soviet route now outnumber Americans 
two to one. 
</P>
<P>
The central issue in the negotiations, which have been under way since last 
year, was the percentage of tickets on American carriers outbound from the 
Soviet Union that can be paid for in Soviet rubles. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets initially asked that ruble-paying fliers be limited to 2% of the 
total. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, hoping to open the market further to Soviet travelers who 
must pay in rubles, had pressed for 15%. 
</P>
<P>
At a bargaining session Sunday, a compromise was reached when the two sides 
agreed that up to 8.75% of the seats on U.S. carriers could be paid for in 
rubles, said the U.S. official, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Pan American and Aeroflot, the sole airlines now offering the service, make 
limited weekly flights to and from Moscow, Leningrad, New York and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The new agreement will let up to six additional U.S. airlines fly between the 
two countries and will let a second Soviet airline join the competition if one 
is formed, the U.S. official said.

DOW SOARS 49.57 TO NEW ALL-TIME HIGH

Prices surged higher in light trading on Wall Street today as technology stocks 
rebounded from Friday's sharp losses and helped propel the Dow Jones industrial 
average to another closing high. 
</P>
<P>
The industrials gained 49.57 to close at 2,870.49, surpassing the index's 
previous high of 2,856.26, set just last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 11 to 4 on the New 
York Stock Exchange, with 1,107 up, 427 down and 454 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 137.41 million shares, against 120.25 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 2.86 to 196.57. 
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 2.72 to 362.56. 
</P>
<P>
Technology issues had pulled the market sharply lower on Friday after Adobe 
Systems, a computer software company, said its earnings for the second quarter 
and full fiscal year were likely to fall short of analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
But the high-tech stocks did an about-face today, in part because of a Barron's 
article that said International Business Machines was on an upward course after 
several laggard years. 
</P>
<P>
IBM was among the big gainers today. 
</P>
<P>
Rising bond prices, which often help support the stock market by easing 
concerns about interest rates, did so again today. The Treasury's bellwether 
30-year bond was up about $4 for each $1,000 in face value by late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the stock market sentiment appeared positive despite Friday's 
35-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average. They said early signs of 
weakness brought buyers back into the market. 
</P>
<P>
Some computer-program buying was reported today, and prices surged higher late 
in the session as investors who had been on the sidelines jumped in to avoid 
being left out of the rally. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted, however, that with a light volume, it remained to be seen if 
the gains would hold up. 
</P>
<P>
The financial markets were closed Monday for Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
John V. Sebastian, executive vice president at Clayton Brown &amp; Associates 
in Chicago, said bonds were benefiting from the dollar's strength against the 
Japanese yen in foreign exchange today. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, "There's not a whole lot going on. It's post-holiday recouping," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
rose 1/16 point, intermediate maturities rose from 1/16 point to 3/16 point, 
and long-term issues rose as much as 1/8 point, according to Telerate Inc., a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8 1/4%, down from 8 5/16% late Friday.

TONY AWARDS WILL BE TONED DOWN, TUNED UP

There will be some changes made when they give out the Tony Awards this year if 
Joseph Cates has his way -- he wants to take out the glitzy variety numbers and 
all those boring thank-you speeches. 
</P>
<P>
Cates, who has a couple of Emmys on his shelf for past musical programs, is 
likely to prevail since he's the executive producer of "The 44th Annual Tony 
Awards" special to air on CBS Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Cates -- brother of Gil Cates, who did last year's Academy Awards show, father 
of actress Phoebe Cates and therefore father-in-law of Kevin Kline, has never 
done a Tony show before. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I did was to screen the last six of them," he said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
He said the heart of the program are the scenes from eight Broadway shows, four 
musicals and four straight plays. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a cut above what television accomplishes, since they have been 
rehearsed for seven weeks out of town and in regional theater and then are 
performed on Broadway. A very high degree of performance is achieved. 
</P>
<P>
"So I eliminated the TV variety numbers. Variety hasn't worked on television 
for a long time. There will be no opening number, no middle number, no salute 
or closing number. I also eliminated the awkward exchanges between the 
presenters and the winners." 
</P>
<P>
He said he tried to group things differently -- for instance putting together 
the three big awards for director, actor and actress in a play. 
</P>
<P>
Five times during the evening the stage will go dark except for a single 
spotlight that will play on a single actor. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the essence of theater -- the single actor who commands you with his 
personality, charisma and talent." 
</P>
<P>
The single spot will shine on Morgan Freeman performing "All the world's a 
stage" from "As You Like It," Kevin Kline instructing the players from 
"Hamlet," Geraldine Fitzgerald doing a scene from "The Royal Family," Len 
Cariou as James Tyrone in "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and Philip Bosco 
reciting "Our revels now are ended" from "The Tempest." 
</P>
<P>
He also has tried to bring in big stars from film and television who still 
return to the theater -- Kathleen Turner as host, along with Matthew Broderick, 
Jessica Tandy, Christopher Reeve, Michael Crawford, Bernadette Peters, James 
Earl Jones, Sandy Duncan, Linda Lavin, Tyne Daily, Lily Tomlin, Timothy Hutton 
and Dixie Carter.

Universal Pictures has paid $2 million for screen rights to Michael Crichton's 
new science-fiction novel "Jurassic," which will not be published until the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
The record-setting price for the novel will be more than matched by the 
studio's estimated $40-$50 million budget for the movie, which will be directed 
by Steven Spielberg and produced by his Amblin Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Three other studios, 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros. and Columbia, were in the 
chase for "Jurassic" with bidding opening at $1.5 million. Crichton will write 
his own screenplay.

THIRD-PLACE CBS UNVEILS FALL LINEUP;

CBS' fall schedule features a revamped prime-time lineup with seven hours of 
new programming and a first-run movie package, the network's top entertainment 
executive said today. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a strong, first step in the process of rebuilding our prime-time 
lineup," said Jeff Sagansky, president of CBS Entertainment, introducing his 
first full schedule since taking the job last year. 
</P>
<P>
CBS has been in third place for three consecutive seasons but came close to 
beating front-runner NBC in the just-completed May sweeps -- although it did so 
with a mix of specials and movies that preempted its regular programs. 
</P>
<P>
CBS offers four new half-hour situation comedies -- "family comedies with 
breakout star potential" -- and five hourlong dramas aimed at attracting more 
family viewing in the 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. time period, Sagansky said. 
</P>
<P>
Fox Broadcasting Co. was expected to announce its fall schedule late today. 
</P>
<P>
Sagansky said CBS will have new shows in the 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. slots on five 
nights. The first-run package of movies that have not run on cable includes 
such hits as "Born on the Fourth of July" and "Field of Dreams," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The new sitcoms are the movie spinoff "Uncle Buck," with Kevin Meaney taking 
over the role created by John Candy; the blue-collar "Lenny"; Burt Reynolds in 
"Evening Shade," as a former pro football star who coaches a high school team, 
and "Four Alarm Family," starring Gregory Harrison as a widowed firefighter 
raising his four children. CBS also will pick up "The Hogan Family," formerly 
of NBC. 
</P>
<P>
The five hourlong series include "The Flash," adventures of the high-speed 
super-hero; "WIOU," about the cutthroat world of local television; "The 
Hammersmiths," a "comedic and poignant" family saga, and "Over My Dead Body," a 
murder mystery with Edward Woodward and Jessica Lundy. There also will be 
network television's first prime-time pro-environment series, "The Green 
Machine," about a team of experts who right ecological wrongs. 
</P>
<P>
Shows getting the ax included "Tour of Duty," "Falcon Crest," "The Amazing 
Teddy Z," "City," "Sydney," and "Sugar &amp; Spice," but Sagansky said 
"Paradise" may be renewed. Shows returning include Monday night comedies 
"Murphy Brown," "Designing Women" and "Major Dad." 
</P>
<P>
"Wiseguy," a crime series, has been relegated to backup status. Ken Wahl will 
return in the first few episodes when the show returns to the air, but a new 
actor, Stephen Bauer, will replace Wahl as a new undercover agent. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' news shows "60 Minutes" and "48 Hours" return to the fall schedule, along 
with what was "Saturday Night with Connie Chung." Her show was given a new 
format and shifted to Monday night as "Face to Face with Connie Chung." The 
show in that incarnation got two test-runs during the May sweeps and scored 
high ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Sagansky played down suggestions that the CBS schedule is not as unconventional 
as that of its two major rivals, each of which have music-drama shows and, in 
ABC's case, the return of the quirky "Twin Peaks." 
</P>
</TEXT>
<GRAPHIC>
<P>
Photo, "Murphy Brown," starring Candace Bergen, will be back on CBS' this fall. 
"Wiseguy" hasn't found a permanent home on the schedule yet, and neither has 
actor Ken Wahl, right. Wahl will appear in the first few episodes, then be 
replaced by actor Stephen Bauer.

At the weekend box office, the diminutive hombre also faced a square-off -- 
against an Apache attack helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
When the dust had settled, McFly -- and Universal Pictures' "Back to the Future 
III" -- was left standing. 
</P>
<P>
With ticket sales of nearly $25 million over the four-day Memorial Day Weekend, 
the sequel virtually blasted Touchstone Pictures' latest release, "Fire Birds," 
off the screen. 
</P>
<P>
Starring Nicolas Cage, Tommy Lee Jones and Sean Young as chopper pilots hunting 
a drug cartel, "Fire Birds" had receipts of about $6.7 million, for fifth place 
at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "Bird on a Wire" proved it had wings. In its second week, the Mel 
Gibson-Goldie Hawn action comedy had ticket sales of an estimated $13 million, 
for the No. 2 spot. The Universal Pictures' title, which was largely critically 
lambasted, has now grossed about $28 million. 
</P>
<P>
Third place went to Touchstone Pictures' still-formidable "Pretty Woman," which 
had receipts of about $8 million. It has now grossed nearly $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
In fourth, fueled by the star-power of Robin Williams, was the Orion Pictures' 
comedy, "Cadillac Man," which had ticket sales of about $6.8 million.

Mother Teresa today was presented with the keys to a former army villa as a

The report did not say what the Prague villa would be used for, but stated it 
would "be available to those who need help . . . the old and the helpless, sick 
children or other disadvantaged groups."

Mother Teresa, a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, met with President Vaclav

One month after his 84th birthday, Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr. 
says he has no plans to slow down. 
</P>
<P>
"Retirement for me is no consideration," the 33-year veteran of the nation's 
highest court says in the June issue of Irish America Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not know what to do with myself that would give me what I get and the 
satisfaction I get here staying on the court." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that he doesn't have "many more years left," Brennan said he's 
trying to let the American people know exactly how the Supreme Court works. One 
way of accomplishing that would be televising court sessions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would love it. I'm the only one presently of the nine who would allow 
television broadcasts of our actual proceedings," said Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he thinks the day is inevitable that Supreme Court sessions will 
be televised.

LIZ SMITH: CHRISTMAS EVE PROVES PUZZLE TO TRUMP'S LAWYER

PEOPLE ARE talking about Donald Trump's attorney, Stanford Lotwin, who appeared 
a few days ago on the Phil Donahue panel with fellow lawyers Marvin Mitchelson, 
Raoul Lionel Felder and Melvin Belli. Lotwin was a voice crying in the 
wilderness as his peers, more or less, took him to the cleaners in the 
discussions about prenuptial agreements. 
</P>
<P>
Lotwin came a cropper when he said that his client, Donald, has two children. 
Even Donald -- and the most ill-informed tabloid reader -- knows that Trump has 
three children with Ivana. And Lotwin also failed to see any irony in the fact 
that Trump had Ivana sign their nuptial money contract on a Dec. 24. Lotwin 
didn't seem to know WHAT Dec. 24 signifies!! The Donahue audience was 
dumbstruck. 
</P>
<P>
THEY DO say the first rushes of the Matt Dillon-Sean Young thriller, "A Kiss 
Before Dying," are sensational. The love scenes are reportedly especially hot. 
Insiders think this movie, now filming in New York, will cap the career of 
young Matt. It will add to the acclaim he won from critics for "Drugstore 
Cowboy" and move him into the top echelons at last.

MUCH YAKKING from the District of Columbia about remarks made by comic Sandra 
Bernhard and fashion designer Isaac Mizrahzi at the Art Against AIDS gala. They 
were the talk of the staid old capital, according to reporter Martha Sherrill. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra: "I'll do anything I can to draw attention to the cause. Especially in a 
town like Washington -- which has chosen to ignore the disease, frankly. The 
government seems full of people who are enjoying the genocide of homosexuals. 
And please don't hesitate to quote me." 
</P>
<P>
Isaac: "I'm just here accompanying Sandra and trying to temper her. And being 
supportive, of course. Let's find a senator to influence." 
</P>
<P>
Sandra: "To offend!"

TALK, TALK, talk! Michael J. Fox is now shooting "The Hard Way" on New York's 
mean streets. In this, he portrays a young actor studying to play the role of a

<P>
Michael should be on a high. His latest, "Back To The Future III," has been 
seen by people in my office and they, along with many others, say this movie is 
much better than the rather mean-spirited "Future II." Number III recaptures 
the original's playfulness and good-natured sense of fun.

Portland Trail Blazers' rookie Cliff Robinson pleaded guilty today to punching 
a policewoman outside a Portland bar. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, 23, was sentenced to a year of probation and fined $250 for 
fourth-degree assault, a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
Multnomah County District Judge Nely Johnson also ordered him to perform 50 
hours of community service and to undergo counseling for anger management. A 
disorderly conduct charge against him was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, a second-round draft choice from Connecticut, was arrested about 3:30 
a.m. April 29 after striking the officer during a fight. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Robinson struck officer Elaine Slone as she and her partner tried 
to break up the fight outside Goldie's Restaurant and Lounge. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-10, 225-pound Robinson was a key reserve forward during the regular 
season for Portland. 
</P>
<P>
He took over the starting center's spot after Kevin Duckworth broke his hand in 
the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to say I'm sorry for this unfortunate incident and I want to 
apologize to the Portland Police Department, the Portland fans and Elaine 
Slone," Robinson said in court today. "I never intended for anyone to get 
hurt."

The eagerly awaited return of Nolan Ryan to the pitching mound for the 
struggling Texas Rangers will be delayed an additional six days, team officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan had been placed on the 15-day disabled list and the team originally 
planned to bring him off the list in time to start next Saturday night against 
the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
But Ryan had more problems with his back spasms Monday while pitching during a 
15-minute session at Arlington Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"When Nolan pitches again, I want him to feel confident this has been taken 
care of," Manager Bobby Valentine said. "I don't want him to try to pitch 
through it and have it be a continuing situation." 
</P>
<P>
A back injury is something he has not endured before, Ryan said. He added that 
he is frustrated at not being able to help. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers said Ryan will be transferred to the 21-day disabled list, making 
him eligible to return on June 8.

Antonio McKay, a two-time Olympic relay gold medalist suspended by The 
Athletics Congress for three months for using stimulants, has been cleared by 
an appeals panel of TAC. 
</P>
<P>
McKay tested positive in January for the banned stimulant phenylpropanalomine 
at a level of 29 micrograms per milliliter. 
</P>
<P>
Any level above 1 is considered positive. 
</P>
<P>
Charles DesJardins, chairman of the three-person panel, was quoted in USA Today 
as saying part of McKay's defense was that neither he nor his doctor realized 
that medication prescribed for the flu contained the banned substance. 
</P>
<P>
New rules adopted by the sport's national governing body contain a provision 
that such ignorance is not a valid excuse. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot understand how they overturned the decision to suspend," TAC 
President Frank Greenburg was quoted by the newspaper. "This would set a very 
bad precedent." 
</P>
<P>
But DesJardins said, "We don't believe we're setting a precedent. We made a 
decision on facts that are unique and that we thought were not sufficient to 
find McKay guilty."

A REVOLT THAT'S NOT NEEDED; 
</P>
<P>
OWENS VALLEY PARTISANS PICK A FIGHT JUST AS THE TIDE IS TURNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A nasty little rebellion is under way up in the Owens Valley that unhappily 
revives ugly memories of water wars of yore. 
</P>
<P>
The vigilantes in Inyo county, who call themselves People Who Love the Valley, 
are out to recall three members of the Inyo County Board of Supervisors, dump 
the county's talented water department director and -- supposedly -- attempt to 
seize the valley back from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. But 
those actions would not serve the valley well. This misguided venture actually 
threatens to do severe damage to long months of constructive cooperation 
between Los Angeles and Inyo County. 
</P>
<P>
This disruptive movement comes just as the two sides finally are prepared to 
write an environmental impact report that will set realistic limits on 
ground-water pumping in order to protect the valley environment. To make sure 
that Inyo County's interests are protected, the pact must be reviewed and 
approved by the state Court of appeal before the pumping plan can proceed. And 
to make the dissidents' timing even worse, their uprising coincides with the 
appointment of two strong environmentalists -- former Deputy Mayor Mike Gage 
and Dorothy Green -- to the Los Angeles Board of Water and Power Commissioners, 
which oversees the DWP operations, including the Owens Valley water-export 
program. 
</P>
<P>
These helpful appointments already are having a major impact on the city's old 
colonial attitude toward the Owens Valley. Because of this fourth year of 
drought, the city has agreed to suspend all ground-water pumping in Inyo County 
for export to Los Angeles. Any pumping will only be for in-valley use such as 
irrigation of local ranches. One Owens Valley old-timer said recently that he 
was astounded that the city would volunteer to give up its supply of Inyo 
County well water, which is of course pumped from land owned by the city of Los 
Angeles. He never thought this could happen without dragging Los Angeles 
through the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Given all this progress, it's too bad that some DWP employes have been less 
than forthcoming in sharing environmental information with Inyo County and are 
not working to implement the tentative water management agreement with 
appropriate alacrity. One would have thought that the heightened sensitivity to 
Owens Valley environmental concerns by the top water and power commissioners 
would have caused the agency's rank-and-file bureaucrats to find some 
enthusiasm of their own. And people who really love the valley should ignore 
the mean-spirited attacks on water chief Greg James and Supervisors Keith 
Bright, Paul Payne and Robert Campbell.

ARCHITECTURE: THE VILLAGE GREEN, ITS DESIGNER BOTH STAND TEST OF TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a young architect struggling to survive the Great Depression, Robert 
Alexander had a very personal understanding of the need for affordable housing: 
He couldn't find any. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1930s were like the 1980s in the terrible shortage of affordable places to 
live," Alexander said. "People were truly desperate." 
</P>
<P>
That sense of desperation led Alexander to the drawing board where the idea for 
a new community of affordable housing was born. 
</P>
<P>
This year, that community -- The Village Green -- celebrates its 50th 
anniversary by seeking inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. 
The prestigious designation would protect the community from haphazard 
alterations or intensified development. 
</P>
<P>
The Village Green began as a model community that was to be called "Thousand 
Gardens," reflecting its designers' great regard for green space. The young 
Alexander had teamed with another architect, Reginald Johnson, a local designer 
with a prosperous practice of wealthy homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
The community the men dreamed of would be not only affordable -- the highest 
rent was $80 per month when it opened -- but the community also would find new 
ways of addressing the already difficult problem of city traffic. 
</P>
<P>
By 1940, after years of trial and error, the architects had designed Baldwin 
Hills Village, now known as The Village Green. The 629-unit community on Rodeo 
Road in Southwest Los Angeles was carved out of a bean field on the northern 
slopes of Baldwin Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Almost since its opening, the Village has been the subject of recognition. In 
1946, the Museum of Modern Art called it "one of the most significant works of 
architecture in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, the American Institute of Architects gave the Village its prestigious 
25-year award as "a notable landmark of innovative planning and design for the 
automobile age . . . (that) gives the project a clarity, serenity, and a 
harmonious unity rarely found in 20th century urban development." 
</P>
<P>
From the outset, the Village's designers determined that the car would be a 
servant, not a master. And Alexander, now a sprightly 82 and retired in 
Berkeley, still flashes fire from bright blue eyes when he speaks of that 
radical, pro-pedestrian bias. 
</P>
<P>
"To tame the car, we took our inspiration from the 'superblock' concept derived 
from turn-of-the-century British Garden City planners such as Ebenezer Howard," 
he said. "The basic idea was to keep the 64-acre estate intact, not sliced up 
by streets. Within this superblock we created a series of garden 'commons' 
meant for walking and relaxing and getting together." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander and Johnson enlisted the expertise of noted East Coast planner 
Clarence S. Stein in designing the Village's model layout. Stein, together with 
his partner Henry Wright, were responsible for the design of several 
pace-setting East Coast new towns. 
</P>
<P>
Today, The Village Green, remains a serene haven for its 1,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Shaded by giant sycamores, maples, olive trees and Chinese elms, the lawns that 
link the Village's one- and two-story apartment blocks are cool and spacious. 
At a density of 10 units to the acre -- three times that of a standard suburban 
development -- the Village seems as gracious as a gated enclave many times more 
affluent. 
</P>
<P>
The design of the blocks that house the one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments 
is a bare-bones International Style whose plain off-white stucco walls, metal 
windows and low-sloped roofs have weathered the decades with grace. 
</P>
<P>
Converted to condominiums in 1973, each unit has a private garage and a small 
patio walled off from the common greens. The rooms are simple without being 
mean and the finished surfaces are unfancy and long-wearing. 
</P>
<P>
Construction costs, subsidized by the fledgling Federal Housing Administration, 
were minimal. This allowed the original rents to be fixed at a modest $80 a 
month for the largest, three-bedroom apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander says the Village was, and has remained, economically and physically 
attractive because it was created in a spirit of investment, not speculation. 
"We were investing in the common good, in architectural innovation, in the 
future of Los Angeles," he said. "We weren't out to turn a gigantic profit." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander become a temporary partner of Richard Neutra in the 1950s, and 
collaborated with the modernist master in the design of the UCLA University 
Elementary School and adjacent Nursery-Kindergarten School. His architecture 
was always distinguished by a lack of pretension and a humane sense of scale. 
</P>
<P>
These modest architectural virtues were recognized in the citation accompanying 
the AIA award, which declared that the Village buildings' "very lack of 
stylistic distinction has made them wear well, and the passage of time has 
given substance to their most positive virtue: a consistent simplicity of 
massing and detail." 
</P>
<P>
Another virtue the Village developed, by accident of location rather than 
intention, is its unusual ethnic mixture. 
</P>
<P>
"The Village is one of the few areas in Los Angeles where we have total and 
peaceful integration," said 49th District Assemblywoman Gwen Moore. "The 
mixture -- equally white and black with a percentage of Asians -- is unique in 
this section of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Wong, a teacher who has lived in the Village for 11 years and now heads 
its Design Review Committee, said she chose the place for its easy racial 
mixture, its environmental serenity and its affordability. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the people who live here now -- whether white, black or Oriental -- 
tend to be professionals with limited means, like teachers and young 
architects," she said. "The price of the condos, now starting at about $110,000 
for a one-bedroom unit, is moderate by current standards. Where else in L.A. 
would you get so much green space so cheaply?" 
</P>
<P>
Visiting the Village for the start of its 50th anniversary celebrations, 
Alexander remarked upon the relative absence of young families compared to the 
time he lived there with his wife and baby daughter when it first opened in the 
early 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
"The place was designed to include a large percentage of children," he said. 
"We created several kidlots that've now vanished. I think that's a pity -- 
though I see that some young families have begun to move back in." 
</P>
<P>
As the surrounding neighborhood became more socially tense and drug-ridden in 
the 1970s and early 1980s, the Village went through some difficult times. 
</P>
<P>
Elderly residents, many of whom have lived in the Village since the 1940s, were 
frequently attacked by teen-age muggers racing through the pathways on 
bicycles. And in the early 1980s, there was a series of rapes. 
</P>
<P>
Today, security guards patrol the grounds and escort residents from their 
garages to their condos after dark. A Village homeowners' association oversees 
the pristine upkeep of the commons and enforces a set of rules governing such 
issues as exterior painting and planting in private areas. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel we've reached a good balance across the board," said architect Bernie 
Altman, a 13-year resident. "We have a balance between black and white, young 
and old, security and freedom, private rights and public good. In every way -- 
social and architectural -- the Village remains a model for multiple housing 
complexes in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"If we achieve the listing we seek on the National Register, The Village 
Green's next 50 years should be as interesting as our first half-century."

PATRIOTS' WOES HAVEN'T SACKED KIAM'S SPIRIT

<P>
Victor Kiam once got so excited watching a football play that he knocked 
himself unconscious and speared his hand on a tennis trophy. He probably won't 
be doing that again. 
</P>
<P>
The New England Patriots' owner and entrepreneur, known for trying to buy 
businesses he likes, says he's still enthusiastic about his favorite spectator 
sport and the team he acquired two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But after last year's dismal season, he's containing his expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not counting one single chicken until it's in the broiler," said Kiam, 63, 
whose hapless Patriots had five victories and 11 losses and missed the National 
Football League playoffs for the third straight time last year, his first full 
year as owner. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just as enthusiastic about winning, but I think I have tempered my 
anticipation," Kiam said in an interview. "I'm saying, 'OK, it looks good, 
let's see what happens now.' " 
</P>
<P>
Kiam is perhaps best known as that gravelly voiced guy in the bathrobe who has 
appeared on television pitching the shaver made by his Remington Products Inc. 
As he reminds TV viewers and others who meet him, he loved the shaver so much 
he bought the company. 
</P>
<P>
Well, he likes football so much he bought the Patriots in 1988 from team 
founder Billy Sullivan, an accomplishment that Kiam at the time called "the 
ultimate football fanatic's dream." 
</P>
<P>
His purchase was especially notable because other big-time takeover 
entrepreneurs such as Marvin Davis and Donald J. Trump had unsuccessfully 
attempted to buy the Patriots earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Growing up, Kiam concentrated on tennis and eventually earned a national 
ranking. He was too skinny to play football but came to love its strategy and 
unpredictability. He admits that he knocked himself cold once in his living 
room when running along with a play on "Monday Night Football." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Kiam and Patriots fans, the team isn't nearly as successful 
as its owner. New England finished fourth in its division and hurt for a 
quarterback. Important players suffered untimely injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we had three of our key players out for the last exhibition game. 
You go home exceedingly depressed -- absolutely destroyed -- and say, 'How do 
we recover?' That was so damaging. It's a tough one to come back from," Kiam 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that owning a football team is different from owning Remington 
or the Friendship Collection, his wife Ellen's jewelry company. There's a lot 
more media attention and more focus on short-term results, similar to the 
pressure faced by companies answerable to stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
Kiam hated that when he was president and chairman of Benrus Watch Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like the fact that we were constantly saying, 'If we do this now, 
what's it going to do to our earnings in this quarter?' You can't have two 
masters. You can only have one master, and that's the business," said Kiam, who 
left that company 12 years ago to buy Remington from Sperry-Rand. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does he relish the fact that the bounce of a ball can change the outcome of 
a football game. 
</P>
<P>
"In business, you can catch these miscues," he said. "It takes a real letdown 
in the organization, or a screw-up, when your product gets affected. But the 
nature of athletics is they don't have the systems built into the structure and 
at any moment something can go wrong, and that is something you cannot 
control." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Kiam said he's mesmerized by those very uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I got into this is to be part of a football adventure," he said. "I 
don't think I'll ever give up the ghost, now that I'm into it." 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots will improve, if Kiam gets his way. 
</P>
<P>
After suffering large losses last year, the franchise already has strengthened 
financially, partly because of a $9-million increase in its share of the NFL's 
network TV contract. Kiam said the team could come close to breaking even. 
</P>
<P>
He also expressed confidence that he could make the Patriots more successful on 
the field, with the same kind of perseverance he used to revitalize Remington, 
which, when he bought it, was a comatose business that Sperry-Rand was eager to 
unload. 
</P>
<P>
In what became one of the first successful debt-financed takeovers, now 
commonly called leveraged buyouts, Kiam borrowed the money to buy Remington, 
repaying the debt partly by trimming the fat from his acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
He started by cutting 79 executive positions, eliminating perks such as country 
club memberships and consolidating operations at the company's headquarters in 
Bridgeport, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
He also cut the price of the shaver, streamlined its packaging and improved 
quality control, eventually increasing sales from $43 million in 1979 to an 
anticipated $350 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at the Patriots like a business -- how are we going to do five, 10 
years down the pike?" Kiam said. "When you get married, you don't say, 'Well, 
I'm going to have a nice honeymoon,' and then move on to happy hunting 
grounds." 
</P>
<P>
Kiam spent his first five years working on the company's shaver but has since 
branched into a wide range of household goods, from an instrument that sucks up 
bugs to a device that keeps nose hairs out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing, I think, is going to be a zinger," he said at his desk, holding up 
the latest gizmo, a hand-held tanning wand, which he demonstrated on his arm. 
"This is a revolutionary new product. It certainly fills a need." 
</P>
<P>
He's also keeping busy selling belts, men's ties, travel accessories, precision 
instruments and a monthly magazine for day-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
Kiam's satisfaction at turning Remington around is so big he has written two 
books about his business triumphs and lessons learned along the way: "Going for 
It" and "Live to Win." 
</P>
<P>
In the latter, published last year, he describes his fateful, self-inflicted 
knockout while watching the Monday night game. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I recovered my wits all I wanted to know -- gore and all -- was, 
'Did they win?' . . . We zealots are a breed of die-hards."

COLLEGE BASEBALL: ARIZONA STATE COACH JIM BROCK, FAMILIAR WITH DESPAIR AND 
EUPHORIA, SEEKS A WINNING BALANCE.

TEMPE, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His Arizona State teams have won 942 games, including two national 
championships, appeared in 11 College World Series, sent 135 players to pro 
baseball and earned him four national coach-of-the-year awards. Yet Jim Brock 
says if he has two consecutive losing seasons, he is a pink slip candidate. 
</P>
<P>
This from the man who recently signed a four-year contract and whose team, 
ranked No. 2 in the country last week, missed a 12th trip to Omaha for the 
College World Series when it was eliminated by Oklahoma State, 10-5, Monday. 
</P>
<P>
This from the man who was born and raised in Phoenix, earned two degrees and a 
doctorate at ASU, coached at nearby Mesa Community College and has spent the 
last 19 seasons as the Sun Devil head coach. A pink slip? A record like Brock's 
usually means they name a dorm in your honor. 
</P>
<P>
But success exacts its own price and the self-critical Brock, 53, has the sales 
receipts to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
Depression and an inferiority complex as wide as the Packard Stadium power 
alleys once drove him to consider suicide. Instead, he became a born-again 
Christian and embraced organized religion with a bear hug, squeezing it until 
it had nothing left to give him. 
</P>
<P>
During dark times in the mid-1980s, when his program was at its lowest and his 
job security at its most tenuous, Brock sought the help of a psychiatrist. He 
took antidepressants. At one point, he nearly announced his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
By his own admission, he was an angry, unforgiving, impatient man, not easily 
understood. He was hard on those teams, but even harder on himself. Now, after 
spending the last 25 seasons as a coach, Brock knows the years have only 
softened the edges, nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
Brock has waded knee-deep in controversy since he was hired by Arizona State in 
1972. He has battled the legacy of Bobby Winkles, the father of ASU baseball 
and the man Brock succeeded. He has sparred with university presidents, 
athletic directors, boosters, the NCAA, Phoenix newspapers, other coaches and 
his own players. Depending on the day, Brock is admired or tolerated. Sometimes 
he is simply despised. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never thought of myself as a popular folk hero," he says. "I'm a little 
fun to love, but a little more fun to hate." 
</P>
<P>
This might explain why Brock, despite owning the eighth-best record among 
active Division I baseball coaches, still finds himself glancing over his 
shoulder at times. He frets over failure. He said the only reason he might be 
safe from unemployment is that his new contract would cost too much to buy out. 
</P>
<P>
This is the way Brock thinks. Some coaches would bask in the glory of their 
accomplishments. Brock fidgets. The day before the West Regional II in Tempe 
began, a nervous Brock walked the six miles from his home to his ASU office. He 
does this sort of thing often. He said it helps relieve tension, a frequent 
Brock visitor. 
</P>
<P>
Brock worries all the time. He said, only half jokingly, that he wonders if he 
will be invited to his own going-away banquet. Good question. It is no secret 
Brock has angered past and present ASU administrations with his stubbornness 
and outspokenness. It is also fact that he has upset his coaching peers with 
his on-field theatrics and his refusal to take a more active role in the 
politics of the profession. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rod Dedeaux, the legendary former USC coach who counts Brock among 
his friends, the opposition never took kindly to Brock's leisurely paced 
shuffles to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
"He was trying to build up the drama a little bit," Dedeaux said. "I always 
thought he was a candidate for the Oscars." 
</P>
<P>
But more than anything, Dedeaux said, Brock has been punished for his wins 
rather than his style. "(His unpopularity) is probably more attributable to 
many things, not the least of which is his success," Dedeaux said. "It's always 
a little tough when you're on the top." 
</P>
<P>
Brock knows this better than anyone. When he was hired as Winkles' replacement, 
the program already had two national championships. His job wasn't so much to 
improve its standing as it was not to botch it. In fact, ASU officials 
considered Brock an interim coach. They told Winkles, who was leaving to the 
join the Angels' staff, that he could return to his old position in a year's 
time. Not exactly a vote of confidence for Brock. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did it help when word leaked that Brock wasn't even Winkles' first choice 
as his successor. 
</P>
<P>
"Winkles was so popular that my greatest fear was that nobody would come watch 
us," Brock said. 
</P>
<P>
But first, Brock had to gain the trust of his own team. So in his first meeting 
with the squad, Brock handed out 3x5 cards to each player and told them to 
write any questions they had about him. That done, Brock answered each 
anonymous inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
The Sun Devils finished 64-6 that first year. And attendance was up. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the gaudy season records, however, was Brock's struggle with himself. 
His high school playing career was undistinguished, as were his coaches. He 
never played in college or in the pros. He was self-taught and at times it 
showed. 
</P>
<P>
Brock considered his inexperience a weakness. So he overcompensated. He decided 
discipline could hide his lack of formal baseball training. When in doubt, 
Brock would resort to rules and drills and, on occasion, rage. 
</P>
<P>
One day during the 1974 season, Brock grew angry with his team during a 
workout. He ordered his players to run from first base to third, finishing with 
a textbook slide. 
</P>
<P>
Bump Wills, the son of Dodger great, Maury Wills, was on that team. Wills 
rounded second base that day and then, while sliding into third, hooked his 
spikes on the bag and suffered a broken leg. 
</P>
<P>
Brock was distraught. He blamed himself for the injury. "Totally," he said. "I 
felt what I had done was out of anger, out of punishment and for all the wrong 
reasons." 
</P>
<P>
That night, Brock couldn't sleep. The next morning -- Good Friday -- Brock got 
up and drove his car around the Phoenix area for five hours before passing a 
church he had once visited. It was there that Brock told a minister that life 
wasn't worth living. It was also there that Brock underwent what he calls "a 
typical conversion experience." 
</P>
<P>
For about the next four years, Brock dedicated himself to his new-found 
beliefs. He was a guest on Jim Bakker's PTL ministries television show. He was 
a guest on the 700 Club telecast. A book was written about his experiences. A 
movie, "The Devil's Coach," was made. He stopped drinking. He even thought 
about quitting his coaching position and becoming a full-time evangelical 
speaker. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Brock grew weary of it all. He counts himself a Christian, but now 
one of moderation. No longer does he fly to North Dakota to address a women's 
religious convention and then back to Tempe to coach a game. Those days are 
over. 
</P>
<P>
"I got really burned out," he said. "I don't know how I coached as well as I 
did during those years. It was a sudden experience and then it kind of faded 
back." 
</P>
<P>
As his fervor for religion subsided, his program's success increased. In 1977, 
Brock won his first College World Series. Hubie Brooks, Bob Horner and Chris 
Bando were on that team. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, ASU won another national championship, led this time by Alvin Davis, 
Donnie Hill, Kevin Romine and Kendall Carter. Brock had done what no one 
thought possible back when he was hired in '72: maintain and then gain. 
</P>
<P>
But four years later, Brock's baseball empire began unraveling like the 
stitching on a wet baseball. The Pacific 10 Conference placed 
</P>
<P>
his ASU team on probation for two seasons and stripped it of its 1984 
conference title because of violations involving the work-study program. Then 
came NCAA sanctions, which reduced Brock's scholarship pool by 12 over a 
four-year period. In college baseball, where only 13 scholarships are awarded 
to each program, the penalty was especially severe. 
</P>
<P>
Brock appeared in front of the NCAA's Infractions Committee, arguing that he 
had questioned the university's interpretation of the work-study rules, but was 
told all was well. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting near the hotel meeting room that day was Brock's wife, Patsey, who is a 
professor of business at Scottsdale Community College. As she sat there, an 
elderly woman, perhaps 80 or so, took a seat nearby. They exchanged smiles. 
Moments later, the elderly woman tipped forward and died. 
</P>
<P>
An ambulance was summoned to the hotel. Paramedics administered CPR and in the 
process, broke some of the woman's ribs. Nothing worked and the woman was taken 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel workers promptly rearranged the furniture and before long, a couple was 
sitting in the same love seat that the elderly woman had occupied. 
</P>
<P>
It was then that Jim Brock emerged from the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, what have you been doing?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't even ask," his wife said. 
</P>
<P>
But this much was sure: an NCAA inquiry no longer struck the same dread in 
their lives. Patsey Brock, often the glue in their 34-year marriage, wouldn't 
allow it. Not after what happened in that hotel lobby. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing made me think we're all so impermanent," Patsey Brock 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Brock was cleared of any involvement regarding the work-study abuses, but that 
wasn't the end of his troubles. Three months later, the Arizona Republic 
reported that an ASU team psychiatrist, Dr. James Gough, had prescribed Nardil, 
an antidepressant, to several baseball players. Gough, it turns out, also had 
seen Brock as a patient and, on occasion, prescribed Nardil to him, too. 
</P>
<P>
An athletic director resigned shortly thereafter. Meanwhile, Brock was 
portrayed in at least one cartoon as a pill pusher to his team. 
</P>
<P>
Brock said he did indeed visit Gough for about four months and that Nardil was 
prescribed to help him handle his own bouts of depression. "But (Gough), 
certainly more than Nardil, got me through a tough time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the allegations of improper prescriptions to his players, Brock reminds 
everyone that a panel of medical experts found the charges to be unfounded. He 
said he knew of two ASU players who were seeing Gough at the time, but he 
wasn't aware if they were prescribed Nardil. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Brock leaned toward retirement. "I had made up my mind that the 
program would never be the same," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A friend convinced him otherwise. So made bold by beers that night, Brock said 
he appeared on a local television station to announce his intentions to stay 
put and to call the Republic "a yellow rag." So much for public relations. 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 team finished 31-35, Brock's first losing season at ASU. The next 
year, armed with only eight scholarships, his team went 34-28. In 1987, again 
with only eight scholarships, ASU somehow beat UCLA to advance to the College 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the worst club I ever took to Omaha, there's no doubt about that," 
Brock said. "But it was the high point in my coaching career. I sat in the 
dugout and cried my eyes out. I couldn't go out and congratulate the pitcher. I 
had to get a towel and clean up. It was a half hour before I could talk to 
reporters." 
</P>
<P>
The Sun Devils finished second in the 1988 series. That was the year Brock, 
faced with fielding a starting lineup that sometimes included five or six 
freshmen, placed large signs about his office that read: PATIENCE. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps he should have done that decorating 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
This, however, is the Brock way. Trial and lots of errors. As Patsey Brock 
said: "Life is full of problems. They say when we don't have problems, we're in 
the box." 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake, her husband is alive and kicking. Has he mellowed? So it 
seems. Brock cried when his team was eliminated in last year's regionals at 
Waterbury, Conn. He said he felt bad for his seniors. 
</P>
<P>
He cried, for goodness sakes, when the message strip on the old stadium 
scoreboard began flashing goodbyes such as, "I'm so sad this is my last game. . 
. . This is a special day for me. . . . It would mean so much to me if you gave 
me a standing ovation." 
</P>
<P>
The last message sent a weeping Brock to the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to understand," said Scott Dupree, ASU assistant sports information 
director and the man responsible for the message strips this past April, "that 
the only two things that have been here since this stadium was built was Brock 
and that scoreboard (since replaced)." 
</P>
<P>
But there are also times -- for instance, three days before the West Regional 
opener against Pennsylvania -- when Brock will unleash a vintage tirade to 
match those of yesteryear. Upset with the way a workout was going last week, 
Brock screamed at his players. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a spontaneous kind of fellow," said third baseman Todd Steverson. "He has 
an aura about him," he said. "He lets people know how he feels, basically." 
</P>
<P>
Brock's emotions have only changed in degrees. Improved, yes. New, no. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any trouble with me," he said. "I just think there are times when 
I think it would be easier and prettier to be somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
It might. Then again, that's never been the Brock way. Never has. And by the 
look of things, never will.

BRANDO CASE IS A NATURAL FOR KUNSTLER; 
</P>

The 2 a.m. telephone call jarred William M. Kunstler out of a deep sleep in his 
West Village apartment in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Marlon Brando, an old friend, was on the line. According to Kunstler, the famed 
actor called on May 18 even as homicide detectives were searching Brando's 
12-room house in the Santa Monica Mountains. They were combing for evidence to 
use in a murder case against the actor's son, 32-year-old Christian Brando. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill, something terrible has happened," Brando said. "You've got to help me." 
</P>
<P>
The well-known civil liberties lawyer had a court appearance later that day in 
New York on behalf of 200 protesters arrested during an Earth Day demonstration 
on Wall Street. But Kunstler rescheduled the arraignment and flew to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, say those who know Kunstler, the 71-year-old courtroom legend was 
being tugged by two consuming, and sometimes competing, passions -- his ardent 
desire to defend the rights of those he sees as underdogs and his love for the 
spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
"He really does have a good reputation as a lawyer, but he really is a show 
person too," says former California Supreme Court Justice Cruz Reynoso, echoing 
the sentiments of many who know Kunstler. 
</P>
<P>
"Incidently, that's not a bad thing for a lawyer," Reynoso added. ". . . 
Knowing how to deal with the press is part of your job as a lawyer if you are 
going to handle high-visibility cases." 
</P>
<P>
To his admirers, Kunstler, who has led the defense in nearly 100 homicide 
trials, is a folk hero, a believer in justice and a brilliant cross-examiner 
who has honed his skill in rough-and-tumble New York courtrooms. His detractors 
depict Kunstler as an egotist who belittles judges and plays to the media more 
than to the juries and judges who pass judgment on his clients. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard the same criticisms about F. Lee Bailey," Kunstler replies. "When 
you are a little prominent you get sniped at a little -- but that is part of 
the turf. I don't take it too personally." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that he said: "Martin Luther King taught me one great lesson. Never 
answer criticism. It's stupid to do that. If you are a good lawyer, you'll do 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after he had arrived in Los Angeles last week to defend Christian Brando 
on charges of fatally shooting his half-sister's boyfriend, Dag Drollet, 26, 
Kunstler had already stirred up controversy. After a Municipal Court judge in 
West Los Angeles dismissed his plea for bail for the jailed Brando, Kunstler 
chastised Judge Rosemary Shumsky for "sitting up there like a toad without 
taking a single note and then saying there is no basis for bail." 
</P>
<P>
Then, on Friday, Kunstler took time off the Brando case to appear in a movie 
directed by Oscar-winner Oliver Stone about the renegade 1960s rock group, The 
Doors. In the film, Kunstler plays the role of an attorney who defends the 
group's lead singer, Jim Morrison, against charges of indecent exposure. 
</P>
<P>
That should be a natural performance for an attorney who has been defending 
seemingly hopeless cases and skewering judges -- most famously in the Chicago 
Seven conspiracy trial 20 years ago, when he mocked the late federal judge 
Julius Hoffman's reading of indictments. Hoffman, Kunstler said, sounded like 
"Orson Welles reading the Declaration of Independence." 
</P>
<P>
"He shoots from the hip, well, maybe the lip, but he tells it like he sees it 
and never minces words," said private investigator Pat Richartz, who worked 
with Kunstler on the Chicago Seven trial, which followed the Democratic 
National Convention in 1968. "When I heard about the Brando case I knew Bill 
would be there unless he was in the hospital connected to tubes." 
</P>
<P>
Kunstler, whose eyeglasses propped up over his shock of wiry gray hair became a 
familiar television news image in the late 1960s and early 1970s, first met 
Marlon Brando, whom he describes as a fellow "movement person," when they 
crossed paths at an American Indian uprising at Wounded Knee, S.D. 
</P>
<P>
"I first met Marlon at Wounded Knee in 1973," Kunstler said. "I only see him 
during very intense periods." 
</P>
<P>
"Marlon Brando has been one of the few people in Hollywood who has consistently 
supported civil rights causes at great risk to himself when they weren't 
popular and where the threat of violence was great," added Ron Kuby, Kunstler's 
associate in the case. "We would come to the defense of anybody with that track 
record." 
</P>
<P>
Kunstler, who received a Bronze Star from the U.S. Army for his service in the 
Southwestern Pacific during World War II, has gone to the mat in similar 
situations throughout his 42 years of practice. 
</P>
<P>
These cases -- and Kunstler's penchant for publicly challenging authority 
figures -- have thrust him into the ranks of such celebrated defense attorneys 
as Bailey, Melvin Belli, Clarence Darrow, Marvin Mitchelson and Richard 
"Racehorse" Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
He has been a special trial counsel to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., 
defended Freedom Riders and Black Panthers and was involved in negotiations 
after a bloody shoot-out at the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota between 
militant American Indians and federal agents. More recently, he defended 
Clayton Lonetree, a Marine sergeant accused of espionage, and Revolutionary 
Communist Party members accused of burning an American flag. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in a rare break from defending "movement people," Kunstler has taken up 
the cause of Marlon Brando's son, who claims he was drunk when he confronted 
Drollet with a gun over alleged mistreatment of his half-sister, Cheyenne 
Brando. 
</P>
<P>
Brando, a part-time welder, has pleaded not guilty to one count of murder, one 
count of illegal possession of an assault rifle and one count of illegal 
possession of a silencer. 
</P>
<P>
Kunstler says that the fact that Brando's blood-alcohol level was 0.19% -- more 
than twice California's legal limit of intoxication for motorists -- bolsters 
his argument that the shooting was an accident. 
</P>
<P>
"The highest charge I can think of in this case is manslaughter," Kunstler 
said. Such a charge, he added, requires bail. Brando was denied bail on the 
murder charge despite sworn declarations about his good character filed with 
the court from 18 supporters, including actor Jack Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
Kunstler's public anger over Judge Shumsky's decision to deny bail to the 
younger Brando drew shrugs from the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what he says. He is of no consequence to me," said Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Steven Barshop. "The people intend to prosecute this case with dignity 
and class." 
</P>
<P>
But to Kunstler, it was another judge who needed to be taken on. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good for these judges," he said. "I don't think you get anywhere by 
bending a knee to them. I believe in attacking. . . . They are dealing with 
human rights and they can't expect to avoid criticism."
