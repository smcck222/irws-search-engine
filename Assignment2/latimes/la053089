GOING FOR THE GOLD AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five years after the Olympic spirit captivated Los Angeles, a new group of 
Californians has dreams of the five encircled rings in its future, not to 
mention the prospect of big dollar signs. Lake Tahoe officials from both 
California and Nevada have joined with the Reno area to bid for the 1998 winter 
Olympic Games. One of the ski areas involved is Squaw Valley, the site of the 
1960 games in which the United States won the ice hockey gold medal and skiers 
Billy Kidd and Jimmy Heuga made stunning medal-winning runs. 
</P>
<P>
More is at stake than just the opportunity to host the 1998 games. When the 
U.S. Olympic Committee selects the American competitor for the games in Des 
Moines early next month, it also will be considering establishment of a 
permanent winter sports training center. The competition from Denver, Salt Lake 
City and Anchorage will be intense, but the Reno-Tahoe bid deserves the edge on 
a number of counts, including the excellence of its developed ski areas and 
proximity to a massive spectator population. With its casino industry, the 
Reno-Tahoe area has the lodging. It also knows how to handle crowds and 
entertain them. 
</P>
<P>
Reno, the Olympic center, would host the Opening and Closing ceremonies, hockey 
and ice skating. Alpine skiing would be in California, at Squaw Valley just 
northwest of Lake Tahoe and at Heavenly Valley at South Lake Tahoe. The Tahoe 
region also has some of the finest Nordic skiing in the world. The major 
construction required would be ski jumps, luge and bobsled tracks, an ice rink 
and speed skating oval. Start-up money would be provided by a 1% hotel room 
surtax and a .01% increase in the sales tax in Washoe County, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
There should be concern about what permanent effect the games would have on an 
already-congested mountain environment, particularly the California shores of 
Lake Tahoe. The major impact would be transportation improvements needed to get 
contestants and spectators into and out of Lake Tahoe and Reno. 
</P>
<P>
The California-Nevada Tahoe Regional Planning Commission would have to have a 
critical role in such preparations. The prospect of the 1998 games could 
present the Tahoe region with the opportunity for development of a 
non-polluting public transportation system that would actually reduce auto use 
in the Tahoe basin, where air pollution is a major problem. One major advantage 
is that Amtrak passenger trains now run between Oakland and Reno via Donner 
Summit and Truckee, on the north edge of the Tahoe basin. 
</P>
<P>
If Reno-Tahoe wins the USOC endorsement, the state of California should begin 
an assessment of the organizing committee's plans and projections to see what 
transportation improvements can be made without tearing down mountains to build 
freeways. Modern transit facilities will be needed to meet future demand 
whether or not the Olympics come to the Reno-Tahoe area. 
</P>
<P>
With the proper environmental protection and transportation planning, 
Californians should be enthusiastic supporters of the Reno-Tahoe bid for the 
1998 winter Olympic Games.

GOOD HEALTH-CARE NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than half the doctors in California have agreed this year to accept the 
government-fixed fees for all of their Medicare patients. That is good news for 
older Americans who depend on the program for their basic health care. 
</P>
<P>
There has been a remarkable increase in doctor participation in recent years, 
rising to 38.9% in 1987 to 48.5% in 1988, and to 54% this year, according to 
the Health Care Finance Administration. That increase was consistent with a 
national trend. This year 40.7% of the nation's doctors are accepting 
assignment, compared with 37.3% a year ago. Even more significant is the fact 
that more than 80% of all Medicare physician spending is now at the approved 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
This assures Medicare participants the largest selection of doctors accepting 
fixed fees since the program was launched. With these doctors, the patient 
makes only a 20% co-payment. 
</P>
<P>
Nonparticipating doctors have two choices. They can charge what they like and 
ignore the Medicare system, in which case the patients pay the entire charge. 
Or they can selectively honor the Medicare insurance, collecting their own 
fees, but accepting an agreed ceiling on their fees if they are in excess of 
the regular Medicare fees. 
</P>
<P>
For four years, through incentives, the federal government has been trying to 
encourage more doctor participation as a means of controlling spiraling costs. 
The effort to enlist more participating physicians is apparently successful. 
But cost controls remain elusive in the face of a pattern of increased 
utilization of both doctors' services and costly diagnostic procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The burgeoning demand for physician services is reflected in a new study, 
published in the current issue of Health Affairs, delineating trends from 1983 
to 1986, when Medicare had a freeze on physician fees in place. Medicare 
expenditures to some physician specialties, calculated on a per beneficiary 
basis, showed remarkable increases, up 73% in those three years for 
gastroenterology, up 57% for ophthalmology. The rate of cataract surgery 
increased 50%, and, among diagnostic procedures, there was a 216% increase in 
sigmoidoscopy and a 120.5% increase in colonoscopy. 
</P>
<P>
Even more stringent controls on doctors fees are now being developed upon 
recommendation of the Physician Payment Review Commission, appointed by 
Congress. A new payment plan is being developed, based on the relative value 
scale developed through federally mandated research led by William C. Hsiao at 
Harvard University. It will increase compensation for evaluation and management 
of health care, as in the diagnostic efforts of primary care physicians, 
including pediatricians, and reduce compensation for procedures, such as 
surgery, which currently consumes about one-third of the Medicare physician 
payments. The commission has concluded, however, that, in addition to fee 
reforms, controls will be needed on utilization of health care if costs are to 
be effectively contained. 
</P>
<P>
Those on Medicare in Southern California can obtain a current listing of the 
doctors who accept assignment by calling (800) 381-6361.

CHARGES DROPPED AGAINST DEPUTY

<TEXT>
<P>
In the May 24 article about Ross' arrest ("Ross Described as 'Shaking' in 
Prostitute's Account of Arrest," Metro), his lawyer, Jay Jaffee, states "there 
was no use of drugs" (by Ross) that night, and all the chemical tests confirm 
that," but then he declined to comment on whether his client had been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
I believe our society must include alcohol as a drug when we describe 
investigations of criminal activities. 
</P>
<P>
Alcohol and nicotine are gateway drugs that have been identified as substances 
that predispose our youth to crime. Alcohol certainly is the most abused drug 
in our society. It is time to treat it with caution and respect.

FAIR TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bernard Waterhouse's suggested "net worth tax" (letter, May 20) would not only 
have a destructive effect on the production of wealth and business development, 
but would quadruple the "mountain of complex laws, the bureaus, the offices, 
the agents, etc." referred to in his letter. We would all be subjected to 
hordes of IRS agents invading our homes, demanding entrance to appraise our 
furniture, pictures, stocks, bonds, money supply etc. And the opportunity for 
corruption would be enormous. 
</P>
<P>
A far more equitable plan is to tax according to benefits received from the 
government. As a direct result of government expenditures for roads, schools, 
police protection, fire protection, huge fortunes in the form of windfall 
increases in land values have been created. This "unearned increment" is wholly 
due to societal expenditures, yet very little of such values is recouped by 
society in taxes. Much of it goes into the pockets of foreign and out-of-state 
corporations who are taking over so much of our common heritage in land and 
natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
A net worth tax would take us only another step towards destruction of 
individual initiative and free enterprise. Taxes on land values, excluding 
homes, buildings and improvements, encourage better use of land, and return to 
society a portion of the unearned benefits received due to governmental 
expenditures.

GOODWIN ON ALIENATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times is to be commended for publishing Richard N. Goodwin's 
thought-provoking column on the alienation and sense of powerlessness that is 
endemic among even our educated population ("Must a Sense of Impotence Keep Our 
Masses Silenced?," Op-Ed Page, May 19.) 
</P>
<P>
Goodwin's articulate call to somehow overthrow our present smoke-and-mirrors 
"political" system (really a Reaganized social advertising and deception 
system) is marred only by his assertion that our own political leaders are 
"more tenuously ensconced" than those in the Soviet Union and China, and thus, 
more likely to heed to call of the people and enact significant reforms. 
</P>
<P>
By now it is clear that there is more change occurring in the Politburo, in 
terms of percentage of incumbents ousted, than here in our own Congress. Why, 
in the 1988 election, more than 96% of the incumbents who ran for reelection 
won. As long as corporate America can buy the incumbents, and as long as the 
majority of Americans either don't vote at all or reelect these tools of 
concentrated capital, the system will not change very much. 
</P>
<P>
The remarkable thing is that this is what we want. For in a democratic republic 
such as ours, the people get the government that they deserve.

CHARGES DROPPED AGAINST DEPUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to " 'Tarnished' LAPD Seeks Outside Check of Crime Laboratory," 
Metro, May 17: 
</P>
<P>
While I'm certain that the reputation of the Los Angeles Police Department may 
have suffered as a result of the Ricky Ross incident, it seems to me that the 
greater injustice has been suffered by Ross. 
</P>
<P>
The career and reputation of an 18-year veteran of the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department with an exemplary record has been permanently blemished. 
</P>
<P>
The recent phenomena of guilt by association has created an atmosphere wherein 
entire lives can be destroyed by rumor and innuendo. 
</P>
<P>
With no facts pointing to his guilt other than an "iffy" make on ballistics 
test run on a rusted gun found in the trunk of his car, a working peace officer 
was arrested, jailed, and subsequently charged with three counts of murder in 
the first degree. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint press conference, both LAPD Chief Daryl Gates and Sheriff Sherman 
Block indicated that it was a sad day for law enforcement when Ross was 
arrested. Well it turns out that they were absolutely correct but not for the 
reasons originally stated. 
</P>
<P>
The damage that has been done as a result of what must now be construed as a 
premature arrest based upon inconclusive evidence is irreparable. 
</P>
<P>
While the LAPD is willing to do anything to re-establish its reputation, and 
the Sheriff's Department has fired Ross, one can't help but wonder how Ross and 
his family must feel. Who is going to help him re-establish his reputation, 
career and life?

LADY LIBERTY IS DOING FINE ON HER OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEN WATTENBERG, Ben Wattenberg is a syndicated columnist in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In China, the massed students carried a replica of the Statue of Liberty, 
quoted Thomas Jefferson and demanded democracy. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, in political salons here, it was being said that America is 
losing the public-relations offensive because George Bush is a standpat person 
while Mikhail Gorbachev is a wizard in the great media contest of ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Can both of these situations be simultaneously correct? 
</P>
<P>
No. Trust the verdict of the kids with Lady Liberty in the street, not the 
pundits who cite polls about how very popular Gorby is in Europe. Gorbachev is 
popular precisely because America and the West are winning the contest. 
Gorbachev is saying that totalitarianism is a disaster and that democracy is 
wonderful. If memory serves, that is the point that the United States has been 
making for many decades. If Gorbachev now agrees, he's plenty popular with me, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
So much of this is so new and so untested that it makes Bush's cautious 
attitude quite wise. Anyone who claims to know what will happen regarding the 
democracy wave in the communist countries doesn't understand the situation. 
</P>
<P>
I recently heard a leading East European scholar describe what is taking place 
in Hungary as "the purposeful dismantlement of a communist government by a 
communist government." Indeed, if the Hungarian government is to be believed, 
it is possible that within a year it will hold true multiparty democratic 
elections. A few years ago survey research conducted by Radio Free Europe 
showed that if a real election were held in Hungary, the Communist Party would 
get less than 10% of the vote! 
</P>
<P>
Will such an election be held? Will the Communist Party successfully make 
radical changes to gain popular appeal? Would the Soviets live with a 
non-communist victory or try to reverse it? If a new free Hungarian government 
should choose to secede from the Warsaw Pact, what would the Soviets do then? 
</P>
<P>
We do not know the answers to these questions, or the answers to similar ones 
at almost every spot in our adversary's empire. In the Baltics, the Ukraine and 
Poland, the cry for democracy is now heard, but we do not know if it will be 
heeded. It is easy to demand a bold, new, active policy from President Bush. 
But when a potential tidal wave may be transforming the terrain upon which 
policy would be made, such a call is naive. 
</P>
<P>
The potency of the democracy movement cannot even be gauged because it may be 
more than a tidal wave; it may also be a blessed and long-running journalistic 
fad. The heavy artillery pieces in the struggle for global democracy are 
television cameras. Since the incredible political events in the Philippines in 
1986, it has become clear that the most dramatic and fulfilling story for a 
journalist to cover is one about democracy, or even partial democracy, coming 
to a place where democracy wasn't before: Chile, South Korea, Poland, even the 
Soviet Union, and now China. 
</P>
<P>
The video trendiness of the story makes it yet bigger. Because television is 
everywhere, and satellites send pictures everywhere, the pictures of democracy 
are everywhere. Democracy is contagious. People who see it and don't have it, 
want it. And people who do have it and see it being denied elsewhere, want 
their governments to get tough with the governments that are doing the denying. 
If that thought isn't troubling Nicaraguan dictator Daniel Ortega as he 
contemplates the Nicaraguan elections next February, then Ortega is not only a 
communist thug, but also a dope. 
</P>
<P>
As recent events tend to reveal, the world is spinning in our direction, 
replete with replicas of the Statue of Liberty in recently totalitarian China. 
For the time being, Bush's response is the right one: Let it keep spinning our 
way.

<P>
ISIS FOUNDER HAD NO TROUBLE LURING BACKERS TO AN UNEXPLORED FRONTIER OF 
BIOTECHNOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, San Diego County Business Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As ISIS Pharmaceuticals President Stanley Crooke walked through his company's 
newly leased Carlsbad facility, he took pains to point out that, despite the 
mostly vacant office and laboratory space, his new biotechnology firm is hard 
at work developing products at a temporary lab in Sorrento Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But the nearly empty building in the Carlsbad Research Center symbolizes 
Crooke's formidable task of building a company from scratch, of being a pioneer 
in an unexplored frontier of biotechnology and of having to translate the 
as-yet-undeveloped technology into marketable products. 
</P>
<P>
Crooke, 44, formed ISIS two months ago after an illustrious career heading up 
product research operations at two major pharmaceutical firms, SmithKline 
Beckman and Bristol-Myers. Crooke, who holds a medical degree as well as a 
doctorate in pharmacology, oversaw the introduction of 17 new drugs during his 
14 years at the two firms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cheaper Than Boston 
</P>
<P>
He selected San Diego County for ISIS headquarters so it could be near the 
growing biotechnology community clustered around UC San Diego and Scripps 
Clinic and Research Foundation. Although housing is expensive in San Diego, 
Crooke said it's cheaper than in Boston and the San Francisco Bay area, two 
other headquarters sites he considered. Carlsbad was chosen over other county 
locations because of favorable lease rates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Crooke is one of the three or four best drug developers in the world, based on 
his success at SmithKline and Bristol-Myers," said Christopher Gabrieli, 
general partner of Bessemer Venture Partners, a Menlo Park-based venture 
capital firm with investments in eight biotechnology companies, including ISIS. 
He described drug development as an enormously complex, drawn-out and expensive 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Before resigning last summer, Crooke was vice president in charge of 
SmithKline's research and development operation, where he had a $300-million 
budget. At Bristol-Myers, which he left in 1980 to join SmithKline, Crooke 
helped develop an array of chemotherapy drugs for cancer patients that put 
Bristol at the forefront of cancer treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Trading on his visibility in the pharmaceutical industry, Crooke has moved fast 
since starting up ISIS in March. He has raised $5.2 million in venture capital 
and hired 20 employees, many of them research "stars" with strong track records 
in pharmaceuticals and academia. 
</P>
<P>
Crooke was able to raise the money from five venture capital firms, including 
Bessemer, plus obtain commitments for up to $10 million next year, even though 
ISIS may be years away from successful technology, much less U. S. Food and 
Drug Administration approval of products. The company's payroll will grow from 
20 to 30 employees by year's end and to as many as 90 in 1990, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long, long time since I've seen an initial venture funding for 
$5.2 million," said Ray Dittamore, managing partner of Arthur Young &amp; Co., 
a firm whose clients include more than a quarter of San Diego's 70 
biotechnology companies, including ISIS. "That by itself tells a lot about what 
the investors and the biotech community think of (Crooke) and the team he's put 
together." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from Crooke, the venture capitalists' interest revolves around the 
technology ISIS is trying to develop called anti-sense oligonucleotides. The 
"oligos" are bits of DNA that bind to "messenger molecules" sent out by DNA 
that cause the production of disease-bearing proteins. 
</P>
<P>
By binding to disease messengers, which are called messenger-RNA, the oligos 
theoretically prevent the disease "message" from being passed on and thus from 
ever being produced, Crooke said. 
</P>
<P>
"Anti-sense oligonucleotides is a method that lots of (drug) companies think is 
going to work, and ISIS is one of those companies," said Ignacio Tinoco, a 
professor of chemistry at University of California, Berkeley, who is on ISIS' 
scientific advisory board. "The idea is that, instead of attacking the diseased 
proteins, you target the RNA that causes them to be synthesized." 
</P>
<P>
Crooke said the potential for anti-sense drugs is enormous because they could 
be manufactured as therapeutic agents for virtually any disease since virtually 
all diseases start as aberrant proteins set in motion by messenger-RNA 
molecules. ISIS plans to develop its anti-sense drugs using so-called "rational 
drug design," or the computer-aided process of designing drugs "by force of 
thought," Crooke said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$2-Billion Market 
</P>
<P>
Citing competitive concerns, Crooke refused to disclose which diseases ISIS has 
targeted for its first set of products. He did say, however, that the company 
is pursuing "four markets with aggregate sales potential of $2 billion." He 
declined to say whether AIDS is one of the diseases targeted. 
</P>
<P>
ISIS' competition so far includes San Diego-based Genta, a company that was 
spun off recently by Gen-Probe, a publicly held manufacturer of DNA-probe 
diagnostic products. (Genta President Thomas Adams was unavailable for comment 
Friday.) Crooke said he expects major pharmaceutical firms to join the field in 
coming years as well. 
</P>
<P>
Although Crooke had studied anti-sense oligonucleotides for the better part of 
two decades, he said he became convinced they could be used as therapeutic 
drugs three years ago. That conviction sprang from advances in molecular 
biology research that have enabled scientists to clone or synthesize DNA 
molecules. 
</P>
<P>
Crooke was also encouraged by scientists' increasing ability to modify or 
manipulate those molecules through a process called hybridization, or the 
binding of one molecule to another. It's that binding process by which ISIS' 
anti-sense nucleotides will someday "kill" the disease-causing RNA molecules, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Crooke said he was unable to generate much enthusiasm among his SmithKline 
colleagues for pursuing the technology, perhaps because the approach was so 
revolutionary. That, combined with SmithKline's financial problems last year 
and the resulting impact on the 3,000-scientist research program in Upper 
Merion, Pa., he directed prompted Crooke to resign. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Return to Academia 
</P>
<P>
At first, Crooke's plan after leaving the drug company was to return to 
academia, specifically to Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, where he has 
been a faculty member on and off for the past 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
But Crooke soon realized that he was too enamored of the high-stakes game of 
producing new drugs and the social benefits that successful drugs represent. A 
turning point in his medical career came when, as a young doctor in Houston, he 
watched a 24-year-old man die of testicular cancer, a disease that is now 
largely curable with drugs developed at Bristol-Myers during Crooke's tenure 
there. 
</P>
<P>
In March, ISIS signed an agreement with Applied Biosystems, a publicly held 
biotech company in Foster City that is a leading manufacturer of instruments 
that produce DNA. The deal calls for the two companies to share rights to 
products developed. ISIS expects Applied Biosystems to help it surmount a 
formidable problem: how to produce anti-sense drugs in adequate quantities. 
Producing DNA and its derivatives is exceedingly difficult in anything but 
trace amounts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like going to the moon to consider making clinical kilograms of 
DNA," said Timothy Geiser, senior scientist at Applied Biosystems. Because of 
the difficulty, the products that will be developed by ISIS and Applied 
Biosystems instead will be derived from substitutes called DNA analogs. 
</P>
<P>
Geiser said his company expects to sign similar agreements with other 
anti-sense manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-sense drugs are "a brand-new field with no clear leader yet,"' Geiser 
said. "But we are impressed with ISIS because Crooke and several of his people 
have experience in drug development. I wouldn't say they have technology that 
gives them an exclusive edge, but in terms of smarts, they are way ahead of the 
pack."

VERDICT STILL OUT ON MICRO D, INGRAM INDUSTRIES MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the beginning, it seemed like an arranged marriage of two unlikely 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 2 months after Ingram Industries Inc. and Micro D Inc. made it official, 
the question remains: Can a conservative Tennessee barge operator and an 
aggressive Southern California computer company find happiness together? 
</P>
<P>
Company officials insist that so far, the combination is working out just fine. 
They say the complicated task of merging Ingram's Buffalo, N.Y., distribution 
business with Micro D's Santa Ana operations is going smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
But industry observers and company insiders wonder whether Micro D can maintain 
its past momentum now that Ingram is calling the shots. They point to some 
troubling signs, including a mass exodus of top managers and the loss of a 
major customer. 
</P>
<P>
Ingram and Micro D, it seems, have become the odd couple of the personal 
computer distribution business, a fast-paced, $4-billion-a-year industry in 
which customer service and consistency are critical to success. 
</P>
<P>
"Our marriage is working out wonderfully," said Linwood A. (Chip) Lacy, the 
former chairman of Micro D who was picked to be chairman of the combined 
company, renamed Ingram Micro D and headquartered in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
In later comments, though, Lacy was more candid. "I know we'll have some 
screw-ups," he acknowledged. "But I'm sure in the end it will go smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
Ingram Micro D is the biggest player in the PC distribution industry, which has 
grown from $1.6 billion in 1985 sales to an estimated $4.8 billion in 1989, 
outpacing the growth rate of the personal computer market itself. 
</P>
<P>
Distributors like Ingram Micro D serve as computer industry middlemen, 
supplying retailers with a variety of machines, accessories and software 
products. Manufacturers, particularly smaller ones, rely on distributors 
because they can move products onto store shelves faster and more efficiently, 
using their own shipping networks, financing programs, and sales and marketing 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
Since it was founded a decade ago, Micro D has become one of the distribution 
industry's top performers. The company stumbled in late 1984 and 1985, posting 
losses of several million dollars. A new management team including Lacy and the 
recently departed Harold Clark was brought in. Clark was Micro D's president 
and chief operating officer. Micro D's financial results and market share have 
grown steadily ever since, with sales soaring from $119 million in 1985 to $553 
million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Based in Nashville, Ingram Industries is a private, family-owned holding 
company involved in the distribution of books, magazines and videotapes as well 
as computer products. The firm also has interests in marine transportation, oil 
and gas exploration and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Ingram, which had been Micro D's majority owner for 3 years before the merger, 
once criticized Micro D's managers for concentrating on growth at the expense 
of profits. Industry observers are watching to see how the combined companies 
will fare now that Ingram is in the driver's seat. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the road has been a little rocky. 
</P>
<P>
Since the acquisition, Ingram Micro D has lost the services of, in addition to 
Clark, David Blumstein, vice chairman; Godfred Otuteye, senior vice president 
and chief financial officer; Carol Miltner, senior vice president of sales, and 
Judy Roseth, director of major accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Blumstein, formerly president of Ingram Computer, was lured away by an offer to 
become president of Peter Norton Computing, a Santa Monica software company. 
Miltner and Roseth defected to rival Softsel, an Inglewood firm. Clark and 
Otuteye's departures were described as voluntary resignations that had been 
planned before the merger. 
</P>
<P>
Ingram Micro D suffered another blow when a major customer, Toshiba America, 
abruptedly dropped its 3-year-old distribution contract with the company 
shortly after the merger was completed. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Lotus Development, a large software company, decided to take some of its 
business away from Micro D and give it to another distributor, MicroAmerica, 
which had long been trying to land Lotus as a customer. 
</P>
<P>
A Toshiba official said the cancellation of the Micro D contract, which was 
worth between $25 million and $35 million annually, was unrelated to the 
merger. "We just perceived that Micro D was going in a different direction than 
was our strategic planning," said Philip J. Vertin, a vice president at 
Toshiba's computer division. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Anastasi, a technology analyst, said it has traditionally been difficult 
to merge two companies whose success relies heavily on customer service. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always difficult to put two service companies together," said Anastasi, 
who follows the industry for the investment firm Robinson-Humphrey Co. in 
Atlanta. "They've lost some key people and a couple of vendors. But the initial 
damage report is not too bad." 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said Ingram and Micro D face a big challenge in trying to 
combine their operations. Such tasks as merging sales forces and computerized 
order-entry and inventory systems haven't been easy. 
</P>
<P>
But if those obstacles can be overcome, analysts said, the merger could help 
Ingram Micro D solidify its role as the nation's largest wholesaler of PC 
products. 
</P>
<P>
The merger gives Ingram Micro D an estimated 20% of the personal computer 
distribution market, about twice the share of its nearest competitors, Softsel 
in Inglewood, and MicroAmerica, a Massachusetts company. 
</P>
<P>
Ingram Micro D expects to post close to $1 billion in sales in 1989, putting it 
in competition with Irvine's Western Digital Corp. for the honor of being 
Orange County's largest computer-related company. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can keep our market share and do things more efficiently, we'll make a 
great deal of money," Lacy predicted. 
</P>
<P>
According to analysts, a company's size and financial clout are becoming more 
important in the PC distribution industry as major manufacturers reduce the 
number of distributors carrying their products. More consolidations are likely 
as distributors are forced to spend more for computer systems, advertising and 
telemarketing to stay ahead of competitors. 
</P>
<P>
The merger "gives our customers and vendors a deeper sales organization, and an 
ability to give more specialized attention to the vendors and their products," 
Ingram Industries President E. Bronson Ingram said. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual relationship between Ingram and Micro D dates back to early 1986, 
when Ingram purchased a controlling interest in the Santa Ana firm from 
Lorraine Mecca, who co-founded the company with her husband, Gene Csige. 
</P>
<P>
Mecca founded Micro D in a small Fountain Valley warehouse in 1979. The company 
had grown to more than $100 million in sales when she sold her 50% stake to 
Ingram for $6.7 million. Mecca and Csige left Micro D in July, 1985, to pursue 
business ventures in Hawaii. Later that year, Ingram purchased an additional 
10% of the company from private investor Frederick R. Adler. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Ingram's obvious clout as Micro D's majority owner, the two firms' top 
executives didn't see things eye-to-eye. 
</P>
<P>
One source of tension between Bronson Ingram and Lacy had been the Tennessee 
firm's ownership of Ingram Computer in Buffalo, a competing distributor about 
half Micro D's size. 
</P>
<P>
Micro D's management had maintained that Ingram had a conflict of interest 
because of its ownership of two rival companies. And, a few years ago, Micro D 
accused Ingram of trying to steal business from Micro D by spreading rumors 
about the stability of the Santa Ana company. Ingram management denied the 
allegations and agreed to the establishment of a special committee to 
investigate the conflict of interest issues. 
</P>
<P>
Following that tiff, Ingram agreed to changes in Micro D's board of directors 
that significantly reduced its influence over the firm. Instead of Ingram 
representatives holding six of 11 director slots, the board was reduced to five 
members, of which only two were selected by Ingram. 
</P>
<P>
During the next few years, Ingram and Micro D continued to have disputes on 
various issues, including the use of stock options as compensation for senior 
management and the amount of access the Ingram directors would have to 
confidential Micro D information. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ingram's management was said to be frustrated by the fact that it 
owned nearly 60% of Micro D but had little say in how the company was run. 
</P>
<P>
Ingram decided that the easiest way to resolve the bickering would be to simply 
buy the rest of Micro D. So, last December, it launched an unsolicited bid to 
purchase the Micro D stock it didn't already own for $12.50 per share, or about 
$37 million. 
</P>
<P>
When Micro D rejected Ingram's initial offer, Ingram upped its bid to nearly 
$44 million. Micro D found that proposal more to its liking. A deal was struck. 
</P>
<P>
Bronson Ingram said he sees no signs that the sometimes tense relations that 
developed between the two firms would continue after the merger. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there was ever that much friction," Ingram said. "Chip (Lacy) 
was insistent that Micro D was still a public company and that he was 
responsible to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
"From time to time, we did look at things differently," he said. "But now that 
we own all the shares, Chip has only one entity to please."

VALLEY ROUNDUP: PERCEPTRONICS SELLS FAAC UNIT FOR $1.33 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perceptronics in Woodland Hills has sold its FAAC Perceptronics subsidiary to 
FAAC's management for $1.33 million. 
</P>
<P>
The management group paid $800,000 in cash and issued a note for the rest. 
FAAC, based in Ann Arbor, Mich., had a pretax loss of $220,000 on sales of $3.5 
million in the year that ended March 31. The subsidiary develops software 
related to air warfare. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Perceptronics, which develops simulators used by troops operating 
tanks, armored vehicles and helicopters, said it expects its loss for the 
fourth quarter that ended March 31 to be from $3.8 million to $5 million, which 
will expand the loss for its fiscal year to between $6.3 million and $7.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The company blamed its loss on cost overruns and writedowns, which are an 
accounting adjustment that reduce the value of an asset on a company's books.

MAMET'S 'EDMOND' LANDS A SOFT PUNCH ON THE BEAST WITHIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Mamet's taut "Edmond" is getting a not-so-taut workout at the Powerhouse 
Theatre in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
This is a short play, but it ought to pack a wallop. Mamet's meek hero, Edmond, 
is as faceless as the hero of "Everyman." All we know about him is that he is 
37 and has decided, with the help of a Gypsy fortuneteller, that he is "in the 
wrong place." 
</P>
<P>
He leaves his unexciting wife, starts sniffing around massage parlors, gets 
bilked in a street game, buys a knife at a pawnshop, kills a girl and ends up 
servicing his black cellmate in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Is Edmond horrified? At first. He thought that if he said he was sorry and had 
learned his lesson, he could go home. 
</P>
<P>
But "that is not the transaction." And Edmond finds himself strangely 
contented. He has demonstrated that warrior blood runs in his veins; he has 
discovered that conventional morality is a fiction; and he has found safe 
harbor behind bars. He is in the right place at last. 
</P>
<P>
"Edmond" plays to the fears of the solid citizen about what would happen if 
"the beast in me" got loose. It is a bit pretentious, in its brusque way, but 
it is also onto something. In production, it ought to have the unanswerability 
of a nightmare. That is not the effect at the Powerhouse, despite some decent 
individual performances. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Landers' Edmond, for example, has the round-eyed innocence of a Charlie 
Brown. Combine that with a receding hairline, and we see very much the sort of 
American boy-man that Mamet has in mind, at once gullible and a potential 
killer. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the street people that Edmond runs up against are also true to type, 
without being types. Midori Meyer's peep-show girl is about business as well as 
pleasure. Carolyn Purdy-Gordon's brothel manager is upset with herself today 
for some reason. Hakim Sulayman's card sharp makes us feel the precariousness 
of running a sidewalk game. 
</P>
<P>
What's lacking is a stylistic frame for the show. Two directors are credited -- 
Lionel Mark Smith and Gwenn Victor -- but there's no sense of an overall 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
The individual chapters in Edmond's descent into hell play well enough, but 
there's too much dead air between them while the furniture gets shifted into 
place for the next scene. These scene changes could have been subtly 
choreographed, so that the beat of Edmond's fate didn't get lost. It does get 
lost and we are left with a succession of naturalistic short takes that tell us 
something about the way a man can activate his own worst fears, but not enough. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than never letting us go, the production is constantly letting us go. 
The design is no help. Less isn't necessarily more in theater: not unless it's 
presented with imagination. The design here is rudimentary rather than austere. 
(Robert Mellette did the lights, Mark Fite the set and Kate McDermott the 
costumes.) Not enough. 
</P>

Controversial director and writer Charles Marowitz is expected to replace the 
recently resigned Richard Stayton as theater critic at the Los Angeles 
Herald-Examiner, beginning next week. Except for two previously contracted 
directing jobs, Marowitz will suspend his work in the theater while serving as 
the newspaper's critic, he said. A resident of Los Angeles since 1981, he is 
best known locally for his work at Los Angeles Theatre Center and its 
predecessor, Los Angeles Actors' Theatre; he resigned in March as the theater's 
associate director in charge of dramaturgy and editor of its magazine Alarums 
&amp; Excursions. Claudia Puig

Singer Connie Francis, whose meteoric career in the 1950s and '60s crashed in a 
series of personal tragedies, returned to the Las Vegas stage last weekend and 
thanked fans who have stood by her over the years. "You've always let me know 
you were there, in good times and bad, and for that I'll always love you," 
Francis, 50, told a cheering crowd. The audience at the Aladdin Theatre gave 
her several standing ovations. In 1974, Francis was raped and terrorized at 
knifepoint in her motel room. In 1977, she underwent surgery that ruined her 
singing voice until the problem was corrected years later. Career problems, 
three failed marriages and the death of her brother, who was gunned down 
outside his New Jersey home, led to emotional problems that required 
hospitalization on occasion until six months ago. Claudia Puig

Super star Michael Jackson was one of the few winners present at the Black 
Radio Exclusive awards show Sunday at the Universal Amphitheater. Jackson 
accepted an award for outstanding achievement in pop, rock and soul, and his 
appearance turned out to be the high point of the evening. The big 
disappointment to the packed house was that hot young star Bobby Brown didn't 
show up. In fact, the Brown-oriented crowd booed when Karyn White's 
"Superwoman" was named best song over Brown's "My Prerogative." Brown was named 
best male artist, and another no-show, Anita Baker, was picked as best female 
artist. Two teen favorites -- New Edition (best group) and Guy (best new group) 
-- did show up for their awards. Claudia Puig

FIVE NEW WORKS PRESENTED BY JAZZ DANCERS INC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dennon and Sayhber Rawles don't often turn out thought-provoking works for 
their 10-year-old company, Jazz Dancers Inc. But whether intentional or not, 
there was at least one such work among five new pieces introduced over the 
weekend in the Gallery Theatre at Barnsdall Park in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"Sister Moon," seen Sunday, showed three stages in the growth and development 
of a woman. Angie Sherman was the teddy-bear hugging child; Karla Cottis the 
gum-smacking, smart-alecky adolescent; Adrienne Parker the glamorous, dreamy 
lover. 
</P>
<P>
Each stage seemed to be ambiguously exalted musically by Sting (on tape), and 
was strongly danced by the women. But taken together, when the three return at 
the end, questions invariably arise -- and not only for feminists. Is this all 
there is? Are these a woman's choices? 
</P>
<P>
On the evidence of the other new pieces, maybe so. 
</P>
<P>
"One Way" (music by Al Jareau) was full of lyric, but anonymous flowing wave 
patterns. In "Busted for Boppin" (music by Full Swing), Cottis, Karen Sefton 
and Nela Fry were similarly faceless but sassy adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
A similar theme attached to one of the two other new pieces, appended to 
pre-existing works. "Fragile," a solo for Sayhber Rawles, begins "Tango 
Apasionado" with the woman set up as riddle for the ensuing reconciliation 
duet. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatcha Gonna Do?" -- a trio for the Rawleses and Fry -- was added at the end 
of the group suite, "Latin in Vogue," continuing its partnering explorations. 
</P>
<P>
Here, as elsewhere, the Rawleses danced with strength and technical prowess. 
The company overall looked crisp and sharp. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing as guests were mime-tapper Lorene Yarnell; the cello-Chapman Stick 
duo Daniel Ross Bortz and Randy Strom; and pianist Michael Roberts, who 
provided accompaniment for a series of sometimes tongue-in-cheek dance 
vignettes to classic pop tunes. CHRIS PASLES

NEW PRINCIPALS IN HARLEM TROUPE'S 'JOHN HENRY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two attractive young Dance Theatre of Harlem soloists took over the charismatic 
principal roles in Arthur Mitchell's dance drama "John Henry" on Sunday 
afternoon at Pasadena Civic Auditorium. Each gave a likable performance that 
ultimately proved too soft to galvanize the masses in this saga of a 
steel-drivin' man and his indomitable wife. 
</P>
<P>
More credible as lovers than leaders, both Hugues Magen (John Henry) and Lisa 
Attles (Polly Ann) looked their best in the slinky, hip-rolling mating duet. 
Elsewhere, Magen projected great dignity as the ultimate working-class hero, 
but he only approximated the heroic bravura of the solos defining the 
character's prowess and legendary domination over the steam drill. 
</P>
<P>
A delightful tease in her entrance solo, Attles always danced vivaciously but 
didn't achieve much depth or authority. Admittedly, Mitchell sweetens the 
character compared to some of the classic folk ballads (for instance, we never 
see her driving steel "like a man"). But the moment when she changes mourning 
into celebration should have more spiritual power than it did Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
New casting for "Serenade" found Karen Brown intense but far from ideal in 
classical line as the fallen, abandoned ballerina, and Augustus van Heerden 
undistinguished as her first partner. However, Stephanie Dabney and Ronald 
Perry brought impressive technical suavity and emotional weight to the episode 
involving the "winged" woman and her "blind" consort. Cassandra Phifer danced 
capably as the leader in the apotheosis. 
</P>
<P>
In "Billy the Kid," Christina Johnson's limpid, serenely executed solos as the 
Sweetheart created implications more poignant than the ballet's scenario. 
Contrary to the synopsis, Billy can't be dreaming of a former sweetheart, for 
he never would have known this kind of woman. She's pure fantasy -- a mirage of 
the purity totally beyond his reach.LEWIS SEGAL

LEVERT BRIEF BUT INTENSE IN FREE R&amp;B CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Time got so tight from drawn-out equipment changes at the Miller Sound Express 
concert Sunday afternoon that members of the vocal trio LeVert, the headliners, 
were warning the crowd about "having to cut it (the set) short" during the 
introduction to the group's second song. But that logistical problem was the 
only real drawback to the free event before about 10,000 contemporary R&amp;B 
fans at Jackie Robinson Stadium near Dorsey High in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
This appearance was the second in a summer-long series of weekend concerts 
scheduled to bring the Sound Express semi-truck (which contains the stage) to 
outdoor locations around the country. It was a relaxed afternoon for the 
casually dressed crowd that ranged from toddlers to the middle-aged to sprawl 
on the football field, stroll around and check out a handful of T-shirts and 
food booths. 
</P>
<P>
But much of the audience had left by the time LeVert reached the stage for a 
20-minute set that compensated in intensity for the brevity. The blend of 
forceful hip- hop rhythms and the gruff Philly soul vocals of lead singer 
Gerald LeVert was a strong, crowd-pleasing combination. It helped that the 
trio's four-song performance included "Casanova," one of those classics that 
appeal to head, heart and hips in equal measure. 
</P>
<P>
Second-billed Cherrelle miscalculated by including three ballads in her 
five-song, 30-minute set. The Minneapolis-based vocalist's singing soared 
soulfully and her 10-piece backing band offered the day's most sophisticated, 
ornate arrangements but the crowd was more eager to clap along to harder-edged 
funk tracks. Radiant realized that and made a favorable impression with an 
uptempo blend of go go-influenced funk spiced with limber dance moves. DON

TUNING IN TO THE MUSIC OF CENTRAL AVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fourth and last installment in KLON's "Jazz West Coast" series presented 
Sunday at the John Anson Ford Theater was subtitled "Central Avenue Revisited." 
Producer Ken Poston came up with several reasonable facsimiles of the tail end 
of those days. 
</P>
<P>
Marshal Royal's alto sax and Snooky Young's trumpet reached heights that were 
hard to top. Though their pianist and drummer, Tom Ranier and Greg Field, were 
born long after Central Avenue faded, they and the bassist Richard Reid were 
strongly supported in this most professional set. 
</P>
<P>
Professionalism was in short supply when the so-called Central Avenue All-Stars 
were on stage. With 11 musicians and no charts, five tenor sax men vying for 
attention, mediocre vocals and endless blues-blowing, the band gave the lie to 
a claim by its nominal leader, trumpeter Clora Bryant, that there had been a 
rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
After a bland but adequate offering by clarinetist Jack McVea's Quartet, on 
came the original squealer of the sax, Big Jay McNeely, a sort of prehistoric 
Kenny G, with overtones of Al Jolson -- yes, he did get down on his knees and 
sing, after which his applause-milking tour of the theater, with a mike tucked 
in his tenor, drew the predictable noisy ovation. 
</P>
<P>
More deserved was the show-stopping reaction to Ernie Andrews, who has better 
audience control than ever. His impressions of other blues singers were dead to 
rights, and his backing, by the superb trio of Gerald Wiggins, Larry Gales and 
Paul Humphrey (who had just played a flawless set on their own) left nothing to 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
The Stars of Swing, led by Buddy Collette, fielded some spry solo work by Oscar 
Brashear on trumpet and Britt Woodman on trombone. Collette's "April Skies," a 
bop variation of "I'll Remember April," had an almost quaint feeling, but was 
true to its period, the mid-1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Art Farmer brought on his trumpet, his fluegelhorn and his co-leader, the 
incomparable alto saxophonist Frank Morgan, aptly recalling the past with two 
originals by the late pianist Sonny Clark. Because the show by now had run 
close to seven hours, too few listeners were on hand to realize that Poston had 
saved the best for last.

Federal authorities are conducting preliminary investigations into charges of 
sexual misconduct by at least five members of the House, the Washington Times 
said. It said the investigations by the Justice Department, the Capitol Police 
and at least one House committee involve minors and male prostitutes. Justice 
Department and Capitol Police declined to comment on the paper's report. The 
Washington Times, which did not name those being probed, said the probes also 
extended to current and former congressional staff members. It quoted anonymous 
sources as saying the inquiries were started earlier this year. It said Ohio 
Republican Rep. Donald E. (Buz) Lukens, found guilty last week on charges of 
contributing to the delinquency of a minor, a 16-year-old girl with whom he had 
sexual relations, apparently was not among those being investigated.

An abandoned copper mine is polluting nearby water supplies with copper sulfide 
and other toxic compounds that are threatening vacationers and aquatic life in 
the Spenceville Wildlife and Recreation Area about 50 miles north of 
Sacramento, Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board officials said. 
The Spenceville Mine was first mined in the late 1860s and remained in 
production until 1918. Steve Bond, a control board geologist, said vacationers 
often camp in areas polluted by hazardous tailings from the mine.

BUSH OFF TO SLOW START, MOST IN POLL SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Bush is off to a slow start in his four months as President, say 59% of 
Americans surveyed by ABC News and the Washington Post. The survey also 
determined that slightly more than half of the respondents felt Bush was 
lacking "clear goals where he wants to lead the country" or were uncertain 
whether he has a plan. According to the survey, 47% felt Bush had clear goals, 
43% said no, and 10% said they did not know. Of those who said Bush was off to 
a slow start, 79% said they were concerned about it. Still, two in three people 
approve of the way Bush is doing his job, the survey said. The telephone survey 
of 1,009 Americans was conducted May 12 to 16 by ICR Survey Research Group of 
Media, Pa., and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

LIZARDS ON BORDERLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The battle against illegal drugs and aliens has left unexpected casualties near 
the Mexican border: flat-tailed horned lizards flattened by off-road U.S. 
Border Patrol vehicles. Bureau of Land Management officials allege that Border 
Patrol agents not only kill the lizards but disregard off-limits signs and 
barriers, destroying archeological finds up to 10,000 years old in the Yuha 
Basin. The Yuha area, 25 miles north of the Mexican border, is one of four 
desert areas where the lizards live. The lizard, which grows to be five inches 
long, is a protected species under California and federal law. Border Patrol 
officials say too much fuss is being made over the reptiles. "Is the plight of 
the flat-tailed horned lizard so critical that it overrides the prevention of 
potential loss of lives or the scourge of drugs being introduced into this 
country? I think not," said Dale Musegades, El Centro's chief patrol agent.

A medical report on the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said Iran's 89-year-old 
leader is recovering well from surgery to stop internal bleeding, and he was 
shown on Iranian television sitting in his hospital bed, being fed soup and 
playing with a grandson. Iranian opposition sources said, however, that 
Khomeini's condition may be much worse than officially reported. A statement 
from the Baghdad-based Moujahedeen organization, released in Bahrain, said 
Khomeini had suffered a heart attack since the operation last week and that he 
previously had required prostate surgery. Iranian television mentioned a slight 
heart complication on Saturday but gave no details.

A small wooden boat carrying 107 Vietnamese refugees landed on an uninhabited 
island in southwestern Japan after a 40-day voyage, officials said. It was the 
first time since 1977 that a Vietnamese refugee boat had reached Japan directly 
from Vietnam, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Japan 
said. An official of Japan's Maritime Safety Agency said 71 men, 22 women and 
14 children were aboard the boat that landed at Biryo Island, 48 miles west of 
Sasebo. All of the refugees were reported to be in satisfactory condition. The 
refugees told officials that they left Vietnam on April 20 and that their boat, 
only 77 feet long and 18 feet wide, had drifted for the last week after its 
engine failed.

A Vietnam War memorial in Philadelphia was splashed with white paint, upsetting 
veterans paying a Memorial Day visit to the granite monument, police said. 
Police said they believed only one person was involved in the early-morning act 
of vandalism. A paint can and a straw hat draped with an American flag were 
found nearby. Firefighters removed the latex paint from smooth surfaces on the 
monument but were unable to remove it from a more porous surface that is 
engraved with the names of more than 600 Philadelphians who died in Vietnam. 
The memorial was erected 18 months ago through the contributions of Vietnam-era 
veterans and others who raised $800,000 for its construction and maintenance.

SKIES CLEAR FOR WINDUP OF HOLIDAY FESTIVITIES 
</P>

After overcast skies over the weekend gave way to a clear and sunny Memorial 
Day, more than 400,000 Southern Californians marked the traditional start of 
the summer season by heading to local beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Although winds hovered around 20 m.p.h. and temperatures failed to rise above 
70 degrees in some places, visitors sunbathed, picnicked and roamed the piers 
and beach bicycle paths. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a perfect beach day," said Los Angeles County Lifeguard Lt. Wally 
Millican at Hermosa Beach, "but it's the perfect way to end the weekend." 
</P>
<P>
The final day of the long holiday weekend saw other time-honored Memorial Day 
activities, including a ceremony at the Los Angeles National Cemetery in 
Westwood -- this one marking its 100th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 veterans and family members gathered to hear Sen. Pete Wilson 
(R-Calif.) remember servicemen and women who have died in American military 
conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cannon Fired 
</P>
<P>
"What we owe to the men and women in this garden of stone is that their 
sacrifice was not in vain," Wilson said. The ceremony included the firing of a 
Civil War cannon that was damaged by vandals eight years ago but was recently 
refitted. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere as the tourist season unfolded, thousands of visitors jammed into 
Yosemite National Park, claiming all available campground and hotel space. 
Heavy traffic forced some motorists in the park to spend more than two hours in 
their vehicles, rangers said. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic fatalities across the state, meanwhile, claimed the lives of at least 
43 people, the California Highway Patrol reported. At least five of the 
fatalities were in Los Angeles County, the coroner reported. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, nearly 1,000 motorists had been arrested in the county as of 
Monday morning for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs during the 
holiday weekend. About 400 of the arrests were made Saturday night in a 
coordinated effort by 33 law enforcement agencies at 16 sobriety checkpoints, 
according to Gardena police, who tallied results of the effort. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Statewide Totals 
</P>
<P>
An additional 577 people were arrested in the Los Angeles area by the CHP, 
which made a total of 2,105 such arrests statewide. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP statistics, which covered the period from 6 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. 
Monday, were running higher than a year ago, Officer Andy Gutierrez said, with 
10 more traffic deaths and 334 more arrests than over the same period of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The holiday weekend also was marked by tragedy and violence. An 11-month-old 
Lennox girl, Roxanne Diaz-Molina, died Monday of head injuries inflicted by her 
mother's boyfriend, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said. The baby was 
injured early Sunday morning in a quarrel between her mother, Rosa Molina, and 
Jacinto Peres, 31, of Lennox, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"Peres is being charged with murder and will remain in custody without bail," 
Sheriff's Deputy Bill Wehner said. The infant's mother, who also was injured, 
was treated at County-Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and released. 
</P>
<P>
An 8-year-old Lancaster girl, Saquita Marie Simons, apparently drowned about 
noon Monday when the 19-foot ski boat in which she was riding sank after it was 
was swamped by high winds and waves in Lake Isabella in Kern County. 
</P>
<P>
Two 19-year-olds from Lancaster, who also were in the boat, were pulled to 
safety by another boater. But the child, who was not wearing a preserver, sank 
with the boat, the Kern County Sheriff's Department said. A two-hour search 
failed to find the body. 
</P>
<P>
There were no casualties, however, when a 50-foot yacht sank in heavy seas 
Monday while returning to Santa Barbara from a holiday trip. Two couples aboard 
the mahogany-hulled Royal Caprice, heading back from Santa Cruz Island about 
3:40 p.m., were rescued when a fleet of boats responded to its distress call, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the rescue boats arrived, the four passengers "got into a skiff, but it 
quickly capsized," tumbling them into 62-degree water, said Steve Lewis, harbor 
master with the Santa Barbara Harbor Patrol. One of the women was treated for 
hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drowning Victim 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a Huntington Park man drowned while swimming in Lake Mead, Nev., the 
National Park Service reported, as winds gusted up to 60 m.p.h. and caused 
choppy water. The victim, who was not identified pending notification of 
relatives, "had been drinking" and then decided to swim, Park Service spokesman 
Don Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
"He went into an area six to eight feet deep," Hamilton added. "His friends 
stated he was yelling in Spanish and waving his hands, but didn't appear in any 
difficulty. For some reason he went underwater and did not come back up." 
</P>
<P>
Over the long weekend, authorities reported that at least 13 people were killed 
in the Los Angeles area in shootings and other violence. 
</P>
<P>
In an apparently gang-related incident in South-Central Los Angeles, five 
people at a back-yard barbecue near 78th Street and Stanford Avenue were shot 
by an unknown number of assailants about 1 a.m. Monday, Los Angeles Police Lt. 
Frank Valdez said. 
</P>
<P>
The victims, three males and two females aged 15 to 24, never saw their 
attackers, he said, because "their backs were to the street." One victim was 
hospitalized and listed in serious condition, Valdez added, while the others 
were treated and released. The attackers fled on foot, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In a second gang-related incident Monday, a 17-year-old youth was shot in the 
abdomen in a drive-by shooting at 62nd Street and Vermont Avenue, Valdez said. 
He was listed in critical condition at Martin Luther King General Hospital.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TEEN CHARGED WITH MURDER IN RAMPAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A teen-age gang member who allegedly killed a student and critically wounded a 
man picking up his daughter during a shooting rampage near a South-Central Los 
Angeles junior high school has been charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
Eliazar Bivian, 15, was shot twice in the head Friday and died outside George 
Washington Carver Junior High School last week. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-old suspect, whose name was not released because of his age, also 
allegedly shot and critically wounded Jose Luis Mendez, 41, who was meeting his 
daughter near a sports field at the rear of the school. The suspect was 
expected to be arraigned today. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager, who also allegedly fired off a round at two 13-year-old boys but 
missed, was charged at Eastlake Juvenile Court with one count of murder and 
three counts of attempted murder, Deputy Dist. Atty. Barry Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
He was also charged with one count of shooting into an inhabited dwelling, for 
firing a shot that barely missed a mother and her infant child at the start of 
his rampage, and felony cruelty to an animal, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
The youth also had shot and killed a chicken in an alley near 45th Street and 
Wadsworth Avenue.

AL MARTINEZ: DEALING WITH MISS ETHEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My wife was in the hospital recently for some relatively minor surgery and it 
made a nervous wreck out of me. 
</P>
<P>
I do not say that lightly. The only obvious genetic traits passed down by my 
parents were my father's short legs and my mother's towering ability to worry. 
</P>
<P>
So I paced the lobby of Tarzana Medical Center on my little short legs all 
during my wife's surgery and worried myself into a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
Mom, had she not worried herself to death, would have been proud. 
</P>
<P>
It occurred to me, however, on the fifth circle of the lobby that I had to do 
something to alleviate the stress. It isn't easy pacing on short legs. 
</P>
<P>
I thought about having a martini, but that probably wasn't a good idea at that 
time of the morning and under those circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital did not provide a cocktail lounge and I will not drink in bars 
that open at 6 a.m. I have principles. 
</P>
<P>
My second response to stress is to read. So I went into the hospital gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital gift shops, for those who have not visited them lately, are the 
province of old ladies with time on their hands. I met one of them on this day. 
</P>
<P>
I could not quite read her name tag, so I am guessing when I say her name was 
Ethel. She was somewhere in her mid-70s, maybe older. 
</P>
<P>
When I selected a book, a pot of flowers and some newspapers, Ethel said, 
"That's all you want?" There was a tone of incredulity in her voice. 
</P>
<P>
"Is there something else I ought to be buying?" 
</P>
<P>
"Suit yourself," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Worry makes me snappish. Ethel was maybe 4-feet-9 and nearsighted. I could have 
taken her in a fair fight, but it wouldn't have been right. 
</P>
<P>
"What credit cards do you take?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Cash," Ethel said firmly, "I need cash. This isn't the Miami Hilton." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have cash," I said. "I have credit cards. Everyone takes credit cards. 
Cash is going out of style." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have change," Ethel said. 
</P>
<P>
That was my first indication that Ethel and I were operating on different 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't need change with credit cards," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"I shouldn't even be here," Ethel said. "It's not my day. I don't know why I'm 
here." 
</P>
<P>
I took it Ethel was a volunteer and had been brought in on an emergency basis. 
She wasn't happy about it. 
</P>
<P>
"How about a check?" I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it good?" she asked. "Don't get me into trouble." 
</P>
<P>
"It's good," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't get me into trouble," she said again. 
</P>
<P>
I wrote the check and handed Ethel my driver's license and a Citibank Visa as a 
matter of habit. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't take credit cards," Ethel said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's for identification." 
</P>
<P>
"My son works for Citibank," Ethel said. "He's only 42 and he's a vice 
president." 
</P>
<P>
She studied me in the manner of someone looking at a man who is over 42 and not 
a vice president. What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
Then she said, "This card's no good. It expired in March." 
</P>
<P>
"No," I said, "that's when the period started. See?" I pointed. " 'Valid from 
03/01/89 to 02/91.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Don't get me into trouble," she said. "I'm not even supposed to be here." 
</P>
<P>
"The check is good," I said. "You're in safe hands." 
</P>
<P>
"Your driver's license has expired!" she said suddenly. "It hasn't been good 
for four years!" 
</P>
<P>
I handed her a renewal card that indicated the expiration date had been 
extended. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good until July," I said triumphantly. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," she said, "the picture doesn't look like you." 
</P>
<P>
"Ethel," I said, impatience creeping into my voice, "how long have you been 
doing this?" 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows?" she said. "Forever. I need some other identification. I'm 
suspicious about the picture." 
</P>
<P>
I handed her my L. A. Times ID card. It is a card I use rarely as ultimate 
proof of my worth and my existence. Only a media pass to Vatican City is more 
impressive. 
</P>
<P>
"Most doctors read the Herald Examiner," Ethel said, studying the card. "It has 
more bad news. Doctors like bad news. What do you do?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a nude model," I said. "Just OK the check so I can get out of here." 
</P>
<P>
About then, I heard myself being paged. I left the gift shop with Ethel 
watching me suspiciously. 
</P>
<P>
"Where've you been?" an angry old man at the front desk demanded. "This is the 
third time you've been paged." 
</P>
<P>
Ethel had followed me across the lobby. "You didn't sign your check," she said. 
"I knew there was something wrong!" 
</P>
<P>
My wife was fine. I was exhausted.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SEX HARASSMENT AT POLICE DEPT. ALLEGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two women Long Beach police officers have sued the department, contending that 
the stress of persistent sexual harassment forced them to take disability 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey Allison of Garden Grove, the first female officer in Long Beach's 
police dog detail, and Melissa Clerkin of Long Beach, who was assigned to the 
patrol division, seek unspecified damages in their federal lawsuit against the 
city, Police Chief Lawrence Binkley and 18 other police officials. 
</P>
<P>
Binkley declined to discuss the lawsuit, which was filed Friday, and lawyers in 
the Long Beach city attorney's office could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Allison left on stress disability in September, 1988, the suit said. Clerkin 
left on stress disability in May, 1988, and was placed on permanent retirement 
in December, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
Both women contend that they complained to superiors about harassment from 
their supervisors and other officers but nothing was done.

FASCINATION WITH L.A. IS TURNED TO FEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARITA HERNANDEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alexis de Vilar would occasionally raise his head from his reading to look out 
the bus window for the landmark Pacific Design Center on Santa Monica Boulevard 
near his stop. 
</P>
<P>
It was a sunny day and the novelist, visiting from Spain, was looking forward 
to returning to his West Hollywood apartment in time to get in some tennis. 
</P>
<P>
His head was down when he noticed an approaching shadow. Then came the stunning 
blow to the back of his head. 
</P>
<P>
When de Vilar looked up, he peered directly into the crazed and frightened eyes 
of a disheveled man, as the stranger pulled a five-inch blade out of the side 
of de Vilar's head. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friend Murdered 
</P>
<P>
"Why?" de Vilar recalls asking his attacker. "I have done nothing to you." 
</P>
<P>
The terrifying attack aboard an RTD bus last week came in the wake of the 
unrelated but equally senseless murder of one of de Vilar's close friends in 
April. The spate of random violence has stunned the writer and world traveler. 
De Vilar is afraid to be alone and seldom leaves the friend's apartment where 
he has taken refuge. 
</P>
<P>
And he feels the attack reveals a hideous side of this city. Although he has 
worked as a war correspondent in Uganda and a free-lance writer in Thailand and 
China, de Vilar said he has seldom been afraid. "But here there's a kind of 
insanity . . . you can feel the danger in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a kind of monster that is being built here." 
</P>
<P>
His numerous projects, including adapting two of his books to the screen and 
finding a publisher to translate his works, have all come to a standstill, said 
de Vilar, 40, whose novels have received several literary awards in his native 
country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans to Leave 
</P>
<P>
Although he came to Los Angeles three months ago with the intention of staying, 
all de Vilar can think of these days is catching a plane back home. He said he 
will stay only as long as required for court appearances. A 38-year-old man 
with a history of violence has been charged in the assault. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles is a fantastic place to have an office and to come with projects 
to sell, but not a place to live," said de Vilar. The novelist and free-lance 
writer said he had planned to establish offices in Paris and Los Angeles, and 
divide his time between the two cities. He had even considered bringing his two 
small children to spend time here with him, he added, but not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"This is no Disneyland," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police described the man suspected of assaulting him as a transient with a 
history of mental problems who, according to witnesses, had been babbling 
incomprehensibly before pulling the knife on de Vilar. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the writer's anguish was the slaying of his friend, Charles 
Washington, who befriended him soon after his arrival. Washington, 61, a Los 
Angeles car salesman, disappeared after taking a prospective buyer on a test 
drive last month. A 21-year-old drifter, apprehended while driving the stolen 
car in Nebraska about a week later, is said to have told authorities he shot 
Washington and dumped his body on a highway on his way to Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tribute to a Friend 
</P>
<P>
While riding the bus last week, de Vilar was touching up a free-lance piece he 
had written about the murder. In it, he referred to his friend as an oddity in 
Los Angeles, "a Renaissance man" of broad interests, whose spirituality and 
sweet disposition ran counter to the city's flagrant materialism. 
</P>
<P>
De Vilar is concerned that in his own case, his attacker may get away with only 
a minimum sentence. The suspect, Harold Bevoid White, who was arrested as he 
walked away from the bus after the attack, has pleaded not guilty to a charge 
of attempted murder. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for the end of the 
month. 
</P>
<P>
According to investigators, White served time at Patton State Hospital for the 
criminally insane in San Bernardino in 1987 after he was convicted of cruelty 
to animals in a case involving the killing of dogs. 
</P>
<P>
On the bus, witnesses said he was talking to himself and railing about not 
being the anti-Christ, said Detective Joel Brown of the West Hollywood 
Sheriff's Department Station. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt the guy is not normal, but how crazy he is," Brown added, has 
yet to be determined by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Near-Fatal Wound 
</P>
<P>
Doctors who treated de Vilar said that the stabbing would have been fatal had 
the knife struck the jugular vein, which it missed by an inch, Brown said. The 
wound required 20 stitches but de Vilar did not require hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
De Vilar's attorney said he plans to file a claim against the RTD, charging 
negligence on the part of the transportation agency in not taking the necessary 
precautions to prevent the attack. De Vilar, who said he has lingering pain 
from the head wound, added that his main concern is any long-term neurological 
disability from the injury. 
</P>
<P>
De Vilar, who said he has been "fascinated" by America since first traveling 
here in 1973, said he plans to write a novel about Los Angeles. He will not 
paint a rosy picture. De Vilar said he will write about the absence of family 
ties, the uprootedness and isolation of the city's inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
"It's strange because in many parts of the world, California is seen as the 
last hope, a place to start a new life," he said. "But the reality has nothing 
to do with the dream." 
</P>
<P>
For de Vilar, the dream ended abruptly aboard an RTD bus last week.

TRIAL SET IN PALME SLAYING

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christer Pettersson, a 42-year-old Swede with a record of crime and drug abuse, 
was charged with the premeditated 1986 murder of Prime Minister Olof Palme and 
will go on trial on June 5. Pettersson, under arrest since Dec. 14, has denied 
killing Palme, and the material presented by prosecutors to the Stockholm 
district court made clear their case is based almost entirely on circumstantial 
evidence. Pettersson was also charged with the attempted murder of Palme's 
wife, Lisbet, who was grazed by a bullet. The Palmes were walking home at night 
from the movies when an assassin opened fire from point-blank range before 
fleeing up an alley. Lisbet Palme, who said she saw the accused at the scene, 
is expected to be the key witness. Officials concede no one actually saw 
Pettersson with a gun in his hand.

A 27-year-old woman who spent a record 130 days isolated in a New Mexico cave 
began undergoing a weeklong series of tests in Houston that could yield clues 
about the medical effects of long-term space flight. Early indications are that 
Stefania Follini, an interior decorator from Ancona, Italy, who volunteered for 
the experiment, is faring well despite losing 17 pounds and showing signs of 
lethargy and inattentiveness during her latter days in the underground 
plexiglass home. Dr. Andrea Galvagno, one of two Italian researchers in Houston 
who have monitored her health, said it is still too early to tell what specific 
effects the long-term isolation had on her immune system. Follini, whose sense 
of time became disoriented during isolation, said at a news conference at HCA 
Gulf Pines Hospital that she is still having a hard time adjusting again to a 
24-hour day.

BUSED STUDENTS MAY SOON TAKE FEDERAL, STATE FUNDS WITH THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego youngsters who are bused to schools away from their inner-city 
neighborhoods may soon for the first time be taking federal and state funds 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego city schools have long received as much as $12- million a year in 
special federal and state aid for use at schools with large numbers of students 
from low-income families. Most of those students are members of minorities and 
some need help to master basic skills. 
</P>
<P>
But there's a hitch. Several thousand of those students take part in the San 
Diego Unified School District's voluntary integration plan. 
</P>
<P>
And when they get on the bus, the funds remain behind at their neighborhood 
schools. However, that may soon end because of changes Congress made last year 
in federal law governing use of these funds. The changes allow schools to use 
5% of the funds for innovative programs. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Education is today expected to approve setting aside $300,000 from 
those funds for schools attended by students under the integration program.For 
example, La Jolla and Bird Rock elementary schools would receive thousands of 
dollars beginning next fall to assist in paying for extra instruction or 
counseling to help students bused from Southeast San Diego neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
While the amount of money is relatively small part of the total program, 
principals say any extra help will be gladly received. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll spend every penny I get," promised Principal Patricia Tisdale at Toler 
Elementary in Clairemont, which could receive $6,400 in extra funds under the 
proposal. "We probably will put it into more teacher assistance, into more 
counseling, into perhaps more parent communication -- there are a lot of 
possibilities," said Tisdale, whose school receives many Latino students from 
Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
At present, funds are distributed only to schools with high numbers of 
low-income family students and low individual standardized test scores. Schools 
get $270 a year for each of those low-income student who scores low on math or 
reading tests, and $540 if they fall into the bottom quarter on both tests. 
Students whose native language is not English also qualify the school for $540. 
The total number of eligible students is almost 33,000. 
</P>
<P>
Under the district's voluntary integration program, parents in low-income, 
minority neighborhoods are encouraged to send children to schools in 
predominantly white areas. About 2,170 of these children are bused to 55 
elementary, middle and junior high schools in the San Diego Unified district. 
</P>
<P>
But these schools receive only $150 in district money for each student 
attending under the integration plan, no matter now much additional instruction 
and counseling they need. District administrators now propose to give the 
elementary, middle and junior high schools another $79 for each low student 
test score -- or a maximum of $158 per student -- for a total of $297,909 for 
55 schools. The proposal recommends against providing money for 500 bused high 
school students because funds are limited and the impact of compensatory 
education is greater with students in early school years. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego could spend up to $600,000 under for bused students. But 
administrators want to reserve $300,000 for new classroom ideas by teachers for 
getting better results out of the compensatory program. 
</P>
<P>
The program to aid low-income family and minority students over the past 20 
years has been less successful than hoped for when measured by student gains, 
according to Frank Till, assistant superintendent for educational services. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Till wants some discretionary money available for teacher 
experimentation, which if successful could be applied to the larger program.

JULIAN GUNFIGHT LEAVES TWO DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two people were shot and killed Monday night in a gunfight that sent sheriff's 
homicide detectives to the east side of Julian. An unknown number of suspects 
were still at large, and the motive for the shooting was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's dispatcher Leslie Roeder said one of the victims was dead before 
authorities reached the scene about 7 p.m., and the other was pronounced dead 
by the Life Flight medical crew after it arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Roeder said the shooting occurred along the highway about a quarter of a mile 
west of the Banner Store in the 36300 block of Banner Grade Road, near the 
bottom of the grade as California 78 winds eastward from Julian. 
</P>
<P>
Roeder said further details were unknown because of poor radio communications 
between detectives at the scene and sheriff's dispatchers.

L.A. COUNCIL RACE: BERNARDI VS. HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilman Ernani Bernardi and challenger Lyle Hall are in the final stretch of 
their runoff race for the northeast San Fernando Valley seat on the Los Angeles 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Voters will decide next Tuesday whether Bernardi, a 28-year council veteran, 
will retain the 7th-District post for another four years. 
</P>
<P>
His opponent, Hall, 49, a city Fire Department captain, placed second to 
Bernardi out of a field of eight candidates in the April primary. His campaign 
motto has been, "It's time for a change." 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, 77, has vowed that if reelected, he will retire after his next term. 
Most of the candidates he and Hall topped in the primary have endorsed him; so 
has a new coalition of Latino leaders. He has characterized Hall as a 
"Johnny-come-lately." 
</P>
<P>
The two have attended eight public forums since the primary. In interviews with 
The Times, they were asked these questions: 
</P>
<P>
Q What new ideas do you have to combat graffiti? 
</P>
<P>
 BERNARDI: We now have six sandblasters in my district, and I was involved 
financially in four of them. I also provided the Sylmar Graffiti Busters $1,000 
to hire professional help to train them. There's an ordinance of mine that 
should be in committee soon that's going to place the responsibility on the 
industrial and commercial property owners to notify us immediately when 
graffiti appears on their facility. We'll take it off with the organizations 
we've got, but those organizations will now be paid. 
</P>
<P>
HALL: Generations of kids are being raised with no regard for the rights of 
other people or responsibility for themselves. We've got to teach morality and 
ethics in the schools right from the start. We need to educate people that kids 
aren't allowed to have spray paint. We have developed with the Sylmar Graffiti 
Busters a good program that should be replicated. The council office should be 
identifying concerned citizens willing to start that kind of operation. We've 
been getting a piecemeal approach: We're getting wet-blasters bought and put in 
different areas, but without the program in place it's not successful. 
</P>
<P>
Q How could the city's effort to remove abandoned cars from streets be 
improved? 
</P>
<P>
 BERNARDI: The quickest way is to eliminate the 72 hours that we're required to 
post before towing. If we start acting in a shorter time period, then these 
people that park them on the street, and once they're tagged then move them to 
the next block, that will stop. The Department of Transportation is improving 
substantially, at least in my district, but we've got to get the people in the 
city government tuned in with the public, that the public doesn't want to 
tolerate this anymore. 
</P>
<P>
HALL: If the city's program was working properly, then I wouldn't find them 
when I was walking precincts. We could establish a bounty for each car that is 
picked up. It could be used by the Boy Scouts, by the Rotary, the YMCA, the 
different groups. If we had a more responsive council office, one call to the 
council office would take care of those things. If there was an abandoned-auto 
form that was given to any city employee that's going to be out driving around, 
that could be a method of identifying more. 
</P>
<P>
Q Drug dealing and gangs continue to be major problems in the northeast San 
Fernando Valley. How can they be stemmed? 
</P>
<P>
 BERNARDI: Drugs and gangs are interlocked, no question about it. I know 
everybody's first logical answer is that you've got to provide jobs, but first 
you've got to take the profit out of the drug dealing. That means a more 
aggressive effort's going to have to be made with respect to the customers. 
We've been successful, in a limited length of time, by making our office budget 
available to bring back police officers who are off duty because we won't pay 
them overtime. But it's going to require more police officers, more 
prosecutors, more courts and more jails. 
</P>
<P>
HALL: Technology has made crack the fast-food drug of the '80s. Each and every 
hoodlum out there can augment his or her income by selling this drug. I think 
we have to reduce the demand for drugs. DARE is a super program, but DARE 
starts in the fifth grade. By the fifth grade, we've lost many of them. It's 
important to have athletic events, for teamwork and cooperation, but you've got 
to couple that with education, a support system. It also takes more police. If 
we took those double-officer cars and made one of them police reserves instead, 
we would have a dramatic increase in the availability of police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Q Residents frequently complain about police response time. How would you 
improve that? 
</P>
<P>
 BERNARDI: You've got a territory up in the northeast Valley that's more than 
60 square miles. When they make an arrest, then they're not available. We have 
to improve the arrest techniques, requiring them to be involved in less paper 
work. The formula for numbers of officers is predicated on the crimes -- 
they've also got to crank in the distance that officers have to travel. We 
ought to also expand our one-man car program. For normal patrolling in the 
neighborhood, a one-man car is enough. 
</P>
<P>
HALL: The Foothill Division has made tremendous gains. They've reduced the 
average hot call response time from 9 minutes to about 7 1/2. But if somebody's 
pounding on your door, if somebody's breaking in, that's a long time to wait. 
That can be minimized not only by adding the extra officers, but by bolstering 
the reserve program and looking at the 
</P>
<P>
deployment policies. Satellite offices also can be effective. 
</P>
<P>
Q What should be done about the scores of substandard, illegal dwellings such 
as garage conversions and add-ons -- throughout the northeast Valley? 
</P>
<P>
 BERNARDI: We have an ordinance that will deal with that, that will make money 
available to people who are living under these unfortunate conditions, that 
will impose heavy fines on the people who are feeding off them. At least we'll 
give them enough money to try to find an apartment. We're trying to figure out 
means of maybe upgrading the kind of housing that they're living in -- garages 
and trailers. 
</P>
<P>
HALL: The concept that was approved needs to be pushed. We need a task force of 
building and safety, fire, health department, city attorney. We need to go 
street by street through the community and make sure that people are living in 
adequate and healthful surroundings. We've not been developing our housing 
market. That's another criticism I have of Ernie: He came out with this blanket 
ban on large apartment developments. The city of Los Angeles is so diverse you 
can't come up with a policy that will be right in all instances. 
</P>
<P>
Q The lack of affordable child care, especially in the northeast Valley, has 
reached crisis proportions. What should the city do to help? 
</P>
<P>
 BERNARDI: Particularly in the low-income areas, child care is desperately 
needed. There are other ways that the city can get involved. Recreation and 
Parks is now starting a program that will take these youngsters after school. 
If it requires more funds to expand that program, we ought to do it. Now we're 
starting to use computer terminals so mothers can stay home with their 
youngsters. I've been trying to get the city to embark on that program for 
seven years, and now they're finally developing a pilot program. 
</P>
<P>
HALL: There are at least 50,000 kids out there right now who are in need of 
child care. The city of Los Angeles is a major employer, and it's disappointing 
that until this past year the city didn't provide any kind of child-care 
assistance for its people. The city needs to encourage through the business tax 
and the licensing procedures a requirement that major employers include some 
means of addressing the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Q You both oppose keeping Lopez Canyon Landfill open beyond 1992. But what are 
the alternatives? Would you push to close the dump immediately? 
</P>
<P>
 BERNARDI: The public ought to know what the alternatives are. There's strong 
resentment of dumping rubbish in canyons, but if we don't want to use canyons, 
then the additional cost could run in the millions of dollars. The other 
alternatives are going to the canyons outside the city and recycling. There's 
also the burning process, and we're going to have to utilize that. I sure would 
like to close the dump immediately. But realistically, the other members of the 
council know that as long as that's kept open, the heat's going to be off their 
district. That's why we're facing a tough problem. 
</P>
<P>
HALL: That dump should be shut down immediately. Instead of being the leader, 
instead of setting an example for the private dumps, we broke the law. At least 
two people were injured because of it, and local people are suffering. I 
advocate expanding Sunshine Canyon Landfill. It will expand away from people, 
into a new canyon that is geologically separated. It would give us 30 to 50 
years of time to deal with our problem in a more substantive way. 
</P>
<P>
Q What is the best route for light rail to take through the Valley? What other 
solutions would you propose to Valley traffic congestion? 
</P>
<P>
 BERNARDI: What could serve the people who need it the most would be that line 
that follows the Southern Pacific, from downtown all the way through Sun 
Valley, Pacoima and San Fernando. But if we're going to have fixed rail, then 
it ought to be subway. The best way to make public transit more available is to 
expand the bus service and to reduce the fare. We have to do a better job of 
balancing our growth, not permitting anymore development that goes beyond the 
city's transportation system's ability to accommodate it. 
</P>
<P>
HALL: The obvious best route is the east-west route that ties major employment 
and commercial centers. It's going to have to be grade-separated -- raised or 
lowered. But our whole transit policy is geared on the outdated premise that 
everybody goes to a central point to work. We need a meaningful grid system so 
public transportation goes somewhere near where you want to go. We need to do 
more to encourage van-pooling and ride-sharing. We need to have a planning 
policy that tries to match jobs and housing and commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Q Many northeast Valley residents say they get the short end of city services. 
Why do they feel that way? What can be done about it? 
</P>
<P>
 BERNARDI: When I first moved up there, nothing was being done about all the 
graffiti, the cars on the street, the traffic lights that they badly needed and 
stop signs. It's kind of a helter-skelter zoning. There's no question that they 
were being shortchanged. There have been changes in that. We're getting more 
stop signs, we're getting more traffic lights, we're getting streets paved, 
we're getting graffiti removed, we're moving cars off the street much more 
quickly. We've asked for a new community plan and they'll be starting on that 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
HALL: The haphazard development of Foothill Boulevard, the Lopez Canyon 
landfill, the potholes, the lack of tree-trimming, the abandoned cars -- all 
point to neglect. We need to have a more responsive elected official and a 
better-controlled staff. People say they call in, time and time again, and get 
no relief. It's nice to trumpet the Band-Aid explanation that $50,000 was 
donated by his office to the Police Department, but what that means is $50,000 
in constituent services weren't delivered. That's at least two full-time staff 
people who could be taking care of problems before they become problems. 
</P>
<P>
Q What are major differences between you and your opponent? 
</P>
<P>
 BERNARDI: My concern is with the people in the community. I've been 
independent, recognized as an independent, and I'm going to maintain that. I'm 
accessible. I go to the meetings. I have a record. All he has is promises. 
</P>
<P>
HALL: I care about the district and its people on a much more emotional and 
personal level. I'm a lot more aggressive in dealing with problems and their 
resolutions. I'm a lot less confrontational, more willing to work with people 
toward a solution and put aside my ego.

An autopsy has determined that a 74-year-old Tarzana man, whose body was found 
in his apartment on Friday evening, died of strangulation, the coroner's office 
reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Harry Simon of 18375 Collins St. was already decomposing when it 
was found, said Michael Riddle, an investigator with the Los Angeles County 
coroner's office. This made it difficult to determine the cause of death 
without an autopsy.

Los Angeles Police Department homicide detectives were investigating.

BUSH OFFERS PLAN FOR DRASTIC CUTS IN EUROPEAN FORCES

<P>
President Bush, in a sweeping arms reduction proposal he declared would 
"transform the military map of Europe," proposed on Monday deep cuts in 
manpower and aircraft to be negotiated within six months to a year. 
</P>
<P>
And early this morning, after meetings that stretched late into the night, NATO 
foreign ministers reached agreement on the divisive issue of whether to cut 
NATO's short-range nuclear forces, senior U.S. officials confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which must still be ratified by the NATO heads of government 
before it is officially announced, is a compromise between positions taken by 
the United States and Britain on the one hand and West Germany on the other. It 
would leave several aspects of the dispute sufficiently vague to allow both 
sides to claim at least a partial victory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cuts by 1992 or 1993 
</P>
<P>
When the summit meeting opened Monday morning, Bush, seeking to seize the 
initiative on arms control from Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, told the 
leaders of the other 15 North Atlantic Treaty Organization nations here that 
his proposed reductions could be accomplished by 1992 or 1993. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason why a five- to six-year timetable" suggested by Gorbachev 
in the Soviets' earlier arms reduction proposal is necessary, the President 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
"We may be on the verge of a revolutionary and more ambitious arms control 
agreement than anyone considered possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Agreement on compromise language on short-range missiles was the final step 
needed to allow NATO to conclude its 40th anniversary summit with a 
comprehensive statement of the alliance's strategy for negotiations with the 
Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
Although compromise language was worked out by Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III and his fellow foreign ministers, it must still be reviewed by Bush 
and the other NATO chiefs. And, a senior European diplomat warned, the 
hard-line position of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher might yet prove 
to be a stumbling block. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany has been pressing for "early" negotiations with the Soviets over 
the short-range forces. In addition, the Bonn government, particularly Foreign 
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, has pushed for NATO to declare that total 
elimination of short-range weapons is the alliance's ultimate goal. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain, by contrast, have insisted that negotiations 
over the short-range forces can begin only after a treaty on limiting 
conventional, non-nuclear forces has been negotiated. And both Bush and 
Thatcher have insisted on ruling out the possibility of eliminating the weapons 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Washington and London have feared that eliminating short-range forces would 
open the door to eventual total "de-nuclearization" of Europe, a step that 
would leave NATO vulnerable to the far-larger non-nuclear forces of the Soviet 
Union and its allies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Work for 'Partial Reductions' 
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise worked out this morning, the alliance would agree to work 
toward "partial reductions" in short-range weapons. The statement does not 
explicitly rule out the German request for a total reduction, as Thatcher has 
wanted, but U.S. officials say the language satisfies them. 
</P>
<P>
"It is certainly consistent with an American position," one senior negotiator 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations over the short-range forces would begin as soon as a conventional 
arms agreement is implemented, sources said. But because Bush is calling for 
completing those negotiations within a year, that schedule apparently will meet 
the German demand for "early" talks. 
</P>
<P>
But completing a conventional accord along the lines of Bush's new proposals 
will be extraordinarily complex, and it may be difficult to meet the 
President's timetable, Administration officials conceded. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes strategic arms talks look simple by comparison," said a senior 
official, referring to the negotiations on long-range nuclear missiles. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush proposals, embraced warmly by the other NATO leaders, would require 
the Warsaw Pact to make much deeper cuts in all categories of manpower and 
equipment because of their current overwhelming superiority in conventional 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overall Ceiling of 275,000 
</P>
<P>
Bush proposed an overall ceiling of 275,000 troops each for the United States 
and the Soviet Union in Europe. That would require the United States to cut its 
combat forces by 30,000 men and the Soviets to cut 10 times that number. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush told the allied leaders, bringing the Soviets to a "fair and balanced 
level of strength would compel the Soviets to reduce their 600,000-strong Red 
Army in Eastern Europe by 325,000." 
</P>
<P>
Based on NATO figures, the Bush proposals would require the Warsaw Pact to 
destroy eight times more planes and four times as many helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, responding to a series of Soviet proposals for reducing conventional 
forces, agreed for the first time to include manpower, helicopters and 
land-based military aircraft in the Conventional Forces in Europe talks in 
Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher declared that the Bush proposal had "transformed the summit" but 
warned against excessive optimism. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers of the Netherlands said that accelerating the 
timetable for a treaty and implementing the reductions were the most 
significant parts of the Bush plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The experts may not be happy with this, but as a politician, I think it's the 
right thing to do," he said, in a reference to the complexity of negotiations 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Fitting Legacy' 
</P>
<P>
Laying out his bold proposal at the opening session of NATO's two-day summit 
here, Bush told the other leaders, "It would be a fitting legacy to our 
grandchildren that, at NATO's 40th anniversary, we launched NATO's new agenda 
that broke down the military, political, and economic barriers that have 
separated East from West for most of our lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
The four-point Bush proposal, which builds on earlier negotiations at Vienna, 
includes: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Locking in" the Warsaw Pact's earlier acceptance of a NATO proposal that 
would set ceilings on each side's numbers of tanks and armored troop carriers. 
The Warsaw Pact would have to destroy 15 times more tanks and eight times more 
personnel carriers than NATO. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also proposed that NATO seek an agreement on a similar ceiling for 
artillery, provided questions of defining the artillery involved can be 
defined. All of the equipment reduced would be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Expanding the current NATO proposal so that each side would reduce its 
stocks of military planes and helicopters to 15% below current NATO levels. 
Again, all of the reduced equipment would be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Setting a 275,000 ceiling on U.S. and Soviet ground and air force personnel 
stationed outside their national territories. The United States would make its 
cut by reducing its combat troops -- roughly 150,000 of the total 305,000 U.S. 
force in Europe -- by 20%. Withdrawn service personnel on both sides would be 
demobilized, making it difficult for either side to conceal attempts to evade 
the limits. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Accelerating the timetable for reaching a Vienna agreement and implementing 
the required reductions. 
</P>
<P>
As previously reported, Bush also told the NATO allies that the United States 
would agree to ease trade sanctions imposed in 1980 on the East Bloc after the 
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that it should be possible to reach such agreement in six months or 
maybe a year, and to accomplish the reductions by 1992 or 1993," Bush said at a 
brief press conference shortly after spelling out his proposals to the NATO 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The President, nettled by criticism that he had been too slow responding to 
Gorbachev's initiatives, said that he had deliberately taken his time to study 
the situation. "We knew exactly what we were doing all along," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged his Administration "has taken a little bit of a hammering for 
not engaging in the public relations battle" with Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
But "the safety and security of American forces, for which I have direct 
responsibility as commander in chief, is too serious to be jeopardized by 
feeling we always have to be out front on some public relations gambit," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BALANCE OF POWER -- Present Nato and Warsaw Pact forces, compared to Bush's 
proposed cuts. Personnel figures for U.S. and Soviet forces only; weapons 
figures include NATO and Warsaw Pact.

LIBERALS ENSURE YELTSIN SEAT IN SUPREME SOVIET; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATIVES OUTFLANKED IN SKILLFUL MANEUVER AS LAW PROFESSOR'S RESIGNATION 
CREATES OPENING

<TEXT>
<P>
Boris N. Yeltsin, the populist politician who was denied a seat in the new 
Supreme Soviet over the weekend, became a member of that body Monday as liberal 
members of the Congress of People's Deputies fought the conservatives' 
domination of the legislature. 
</P>
<P>
After a day of heated debate that sharply divided the new Soviet lawmakers into 
liberal and conservative wings, the liberals managed a skillful but dramatic 
maneuver -- over the initial protests of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev -- to 
include Yeltsin in the Supreme Soviet, the country's restructured full-time 
legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, dismissed last year as an alternate member of the Communist Party's 
ruling Politburo for his radicalism, will take the place of Alexei I. Kazannik, 
a Siberian law professor who gave up his seat, saying that his conscience would 
not permit him to sit in the legislature if Yeltsin were excluded. 
</P>
<P>
When a surprised Gorbachev suggested that Kazannik's offer be referred to a 
legal commission for study, hundreds of deputies objected with a roar of 
protest that reverberated through the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses, and the 
liberals had two lawyers ready to explain how Yeltsin could be seated, quickly 
and neatly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moderates Join Rumble 
</P>
<P>
"All right, all right, all right," Gorbachev said, holding up his hands in 
surrender, as even moderates, loyal party members, joined the rumble of 
discontent. "I rely on the deputies' judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Calling for a vote on Yeltsin's inclusion in the Supreme Soviet, Gorbachev was 
then the first to raise his hand in support of the liberals' motion. While a 
majority endorsed the motion, many deputies -- presumably conservatives opposed 
to Yeltsin's calls for faster and broader reforms -- did not participate in the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Monday, the fourth day of the congress, liberal deputies had 
hammered away at the conservative majority, denouncing its "moronic 
acquiescence" in "all the plans and plots of the party apparatus," as one 
speaker put it. They declared that the exclusion of Yeltsin, probably the most 
popular politician in the country after Gorbachev, had shamed them all. 
</P>
<P>
Thanking Kazannik for his "political courage," Yeltsin told reporters after the 
session: "The congress is becoming more and more democratic. If this process 
continues, the hopes of the people in this Congress of People's Deputies may be 
justified." 
</P>
<P>
There were immediate celebrations on the streets of Moscow, nearly 6 million of 
whose voters had elected Yeltsin in a landslide in the March elections for the 
city's deputies in congress. 
</P>
<P>
The congress has 2,250 members, meets once or twice a year to discuss and 
decide broad policies and elects and oversees the Supreme Soviet, which has 271 
members in each of its two houses and will be in session for as much as eight 
months a year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impromptu Victory March 
</P>
<P>
Greeted by shouts of "hurrah!" from jubilant supporters at the Kremlin's 
Troitsky Gate as he left the congress, Yeltsin led an impromptu victory march 
down Gorky Street, one of the capital's main thoroughfares, to Pushkin Square, 
often the site of dissenters' protests. There, he thanked the deputies who had 
reversed the original move to exclude him from the Supreme Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
The sharp conservative-liberal division in the congress became increasingly 
apparent through the day as deputies debated Gorbachev's nomination of Anatoly 
I. Lukyanov, 59, a constitutional lawyer and a close friend since their days at 
university more than 30 years ago, as the first vice chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet and his deputy for day-to-day legislative affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Liberals, pushing hard for faster and broader reforms of the political system, 
asserted the authority of the Congress of People's Deputies as the embodiment 
of supreme state authority. Conservatives deferred to the Communist Party's 
leadership of the country, placing their trust in the party to set the pace and 
scope of reform. 
</P>
<P>
There were also direct and repeated challenges to Gorbachev's authority, both 
in his role as the Communist Party leader and in his conduct of the meeting. He 
was accused of manipulating the debate to assure himself what one liberal 
called "a comfortable result . . . with the veneer of democracy." 
</P>
<P>
The debate is certain to grow today after Gorbachev delivers a lengthy speech 
on the country's future policies at home and abroad -- and the proposals are 
then publicly debated. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict, however, is not only about the course of reform but also about 
the roles that the congress, a broad-based assembly that will meet only once or 
twice a year, and the Supreme Soviet, a full-time legislature, will have and 
what their relationship with the Communist Party will be. 
</P>
<P>
While Lukyanov's election was never in doubt -- he eventually won with only 179 
of the deputies voting against him and a further 137 abstaining -- he was asked 
tougher questions than any leading Soviet politician has had to answer in 
public for many years. 
</P>
<P>
Noting an upsurge in crime in recent years and Lukyanov's past responsibility 
within the party secretariat for law enforcement, a top investigator of 
official corruption, Telman Gdlyan, asked, "How do you assess . . . your 
responsibility for the failure of the departments entrusted to you?" 
</P>
<P>
Organized crime was spreading, law enforcement agencies were demoralized, some 
investigations into corruption had been slowed, diverted or halted, Gdlyan 
charged, and now there were more and more cover-ups, largely for political 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How Different From Ligachev? 
</P>
<P>
Another deputy asked whether he differed in any way with Yegor K. Ligachev, who 
is widely regarded as the leader of the Politburo's conservative faction. What 
had his role been in formulating controversial legislation restricting 
political meetings, in making it a crime to "insult" the government or any of 
its institutions and officials and in giving the police increased authority to 
pursue those suspected of political wrongdoing? 
</P>
<P>
There were other sharp questions -- about the poor, sometimes chaotic 
organization of the congress, which was Lukyanov's responsibility; about what 
he knew about the police action in suppressing a nationalist demonstration last 
month in Tbilisi, the capital of Soviet Georgia; about the rehabilitation of 
ethnic minorities persecuted in the past; about the Soviet Union's pact with 
Nazi Germany to divide Eastern Europe between them; about plans for a broad 
legislative program. 
</P>
<P>
So fast and furious were the questions as liberal deputies sought to recover 
the initiative they had lost in Friday's voting for members of the Supreme 
Soviet that conservatives complained. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev came to the rescue of his beleaguered deputy several times. "Comrade 
deputies, please do as I suggested," he said at one point when the debate 
became sidetracked in procedural matters. "People should not put a monkey 
wrench in the works." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, however, the most telling argument in Lukyanov's favor was that of 
Roy A. Medvedev, a longtime dissenter who was recently accepted back into the 
Communist Party. He said that Gorbachev needs a deputy who thinks as he does 
and on whom he can rely. 
</P>
<P>
For too long, Medvedev said, policies had changed -- "as much as 180 degrees" 
-- every time Gorbachev left Moscow, either on a trip abroad or on holiday. The 
implication was that Ligachev, as the second-ranking Politburo member, had made 
serious shifts in party policies in Gorbachev's absence. 
</P>
<P>
Lukyanov eventually won overwhelming support, but it was far from easy, and 
there were still doubters.

PEANUT BUTTER OBSESSION SPREADING ACROSS COUNTRY 
</P>

<P>
Every other day as part of his personal fitness program, Frank Beltran dons his 
running gear and jogs home after work from his downtown law office. 
</P>
<P>
He used to fortify himself for the 7.5-mile jaunt with honey. But six months 
ago, he switched to peanut butter -- something that up to then he had dismissed 
as "kid stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he says, he cannot get enough of the sticky spread. He eats it with 
crackers before setting off on his run and then snacks on it again with a spoon 
out of the jar after arriving home. "I've gone nuts over peanut butter," said 
the 38-year-old trial attorney. 
</P>
<P>
He's not the only one. Americans have long had a love affair with peanut 
butter, slathering it on bread for sandwiches, spreading it on crackers for 
snacks or mixing it with other ingredients to make cookies, cakes, sauces and 
souffles. 
</P>
<P>
"Peanut butter is right up there with mom and apple pie," says Don Koehler, 
executive director of the Georgia Peanut Commission. 
</P>
<P>
But now, in a phenomenon sweeping the nation, that love affair is turning into 
an obsession as Americans have gone on a peanut butter binge unprecedented in 
the 99 years since the product was invented by a St. Louis physician as a 
protein substitute for his elderly patients who had trouble chewing meat. 
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of the current peanut marketing year, which began 
last August, Americans have consumed a record 575 million pounds of peanut 
butter -- an astonishing 18% increase over the amount consumed in the same 
eight-month period a year ago, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
That is enough peanut butter to make more than 8 billion average-sized 
sandwiches, with enough left over to spread on a few million saltines. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, it seems, peanut butter is not just kid stuff any more. Americans of 
all ages and throughout the country are part of this new burst of peanut 
butter's popularity. And their appetites seem to be insatiable. 
</P>
<P>
"I eat more peanut butter than Jimmy Carter," said David Novak, 34, purchasing 
agent for a textile importing firm in New York City, referring to the former 
President whose family was noted for growing peanuts in Georgia. "I like peanut 
butter better than I do meat." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On the Cutting Edge 
</P>
<P>
Novak, like Atlanta lawyer Beltran, is typical of those on the cutting edge of 
the trend: health-conscious baby boomers who exercise regularly and watch their 
diets, avoiding foods high in saturated fats, cholesterol and sodium. 
</P>
<P>
Along with those who are turning to peanut butter largely for health reasons 
are those who are rediscovering peanut butter as a "comfort food," one that 
brings back warm and wonderful memories of childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I get sweets cravings and . . . I'll go foraging (in the kitchen) and get out 
the peanut butter," said Lisa Paikowski, Houston editor of Adweek. "I take a 
piece of bread and slap it on. Sometimes it's peanut butter with jelly." 
</P>
<P>
Also bolstering the trend are the legions of unabashed peanut butter lovers who 
have never been able to do without the product and are happy to see so many 
others discovering what they have long known. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
40-Ounce Containers 
</P>
<P>
Robert Reed, 58, a retired school teacher in Redding, Calif., buys his peanut 
butter in 40-ounce containers and says that he keeps a half-dozen in stock on 
his kitchen shelf. "Just in case we have a peanut blight in our country," he 
joked. 
</P>
<P>
"I eat it in the morning on toast or muffins or pancakes; in the afternoon on 
crackers, graham or saltine; and in the evening, usually right after dinner, I 
like a piece of white bread with peanut butter and butter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The only way Reed doesn't like peanut butter is mixed in milkshakes: "It's 
really yuk!" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Stridde, grocery manager at Alfalfa's Market in Boulder, Colo., says sales 
of peanut butter at his store are up 20% over last year. "I've noticed that as 
more and more people are learning about natural foods, peanut butter is one of 
the first they learn about as a good, all-around food," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Producers Happy 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps no one is happier with the peanut butter mania than the nation's peanut 
growers and processors, who have been faced with a relatively slow growing 
market for years. 
</P>
<P>
"It tickles me to death," said Derris Jones, a peanut farmer in the rural, 
southern Georgia agricultural community of Chula. "It's the best food anywhere 
to eat if people only realized it." 
</P>
<P>
That may be a slight exaggeration. Although peanut butter is high in fats and, 
therefore, high in calories -- about 188 calories in the average two-tablespoon 
serving -- it has no cholesterol, plenty of protein, lots of vitamins and 
minerals and a fair amount of fiber. 
</P>
<P>
But even most of the fats in peanut butter are of the monounsaturated or 
polyunsaturated variety, which some researchers say may help to reduce 
cholesterol in the body, said David Haytowitz, a U.S. Department of Agriculture 
nutritionist. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On Cancer List 
</P>
<P>
(Peanut butter also contains minuscule amounts of aflatoxin, a naturally 
occurring chemical that appears on California's list of cancer-causing 
substances under the state's Proposition 65, but this obviously has not 
deterred the food's fanciers.) 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, peanut industry spokesmen are fond of pointing out, peanut butter is 
still a bargain. According to the latest consumer price index, an average 
18-ounce jar costs $1.79 -- which the Georgia Peanut Commission's Koehler says 
is cheaper pound for pound than "bologna or hot dogs or almost any other 
protein source." 
</P>
<P>
Capitalizing on peanut butter's new-found acceptability among adults, Skippy 
peanut butter launched an advertising campaign in May that is a radical switch 
from previous ads showing mothers drawing hearts in the peanut butter on their 
children's sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dipping Snacks 
</P>
<P>
The fun of "Skippy Dippin' " is the new theme, and the commercials show people 
dipping snacks, such as pretzels, in peanut butter. 
</P>
<P>
Until five years ago, according to Advertising Age, Skippy was the leader in 
the $959-million-a-year peanut butter market. Now it is second, with a 17% 
market share behind No. 1 Jif's 32%. 
</P>
<P>
One of the industry's most successful promotional campaigns has been the 
Adults' Peanut Butter Lovers' Fan Club, sponsored by the Atlanta-based Peanut 
Advisory Board, an organization of peanut growers from Georgia, Alabama and 
Florida -- the heartland of the nation's "peanut belt." 
</P>
<P>
"We started the club about four years ago," said Mitch Head, the board's 
executive director. "We printed up 5,000 membership cards and said: 'That ought 
to hold us for a few years.' But four months later we were out, and now we have 
more than 40,000 members." 
</P>
<P>
The federal government also has played a role in the upsurge of peanut butter 
consumption through food programs for the poor and needy as well as for 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
"We produce about 1 million pounds a week when we're successful on the bids," 
said W. P. Smith, vice president of Stephens Industries in Dawson, Ga., a 
peanut processing company dealing exclusively in government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic 18% increase in peanut butter consumption for the first two-thirds 
of the current marketing year was accompanied by an impressive 7.2% jump in 
snack peanuts consumption and an encouraging 1.2% rise in peanut candy 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
"At that kind of growth rate, we could be looking at $85 million in added sales 
for producers nationwide," Koehler said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Bar Consumption 
</P>
<P>
He added that the increased consumption of snack peanuts appears to be taking 
place in the home -- and not in bars, where, for various reasons, peanuts have 
become a kind of endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
"They used to think that salty peanuts sold more beer," said Genevieve Clark, 
manager of the Union Bar and Grille on Chicago's fashionable North Side. "Now 
they think hot spicy chicken wings do it." 
</P>
<P>
But in Denver, the Boiler Room restaurant and bar that opened last August to 
overwhelming success, peanuts are an integral part of the atmosphere -- from 
the giant barrel inside the front door from which customers scoop up their own, 
to the mounds of empty peanut shells that litter the floor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Good Times and Fun 
</P>
<P>
"Peanuts help our beer consumption," said Gary Kortz, one of the Boiler Room's 
owners. "They're synonymous with good times and fun. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
How long Americans will remain on this binge of peanut butter and other forms 
of the humble legume is a big question. Peanut industry spokesmen say that they 
do not expect future increases to be so dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
However, as Koehler sees it: "I think we've reached a new threshold and, while 
it's not likely that we'll see increases of the magnitude in the 1988-89 
marketing year, I think we can maintain the high side and will have a strong 
market for years to come."

Romaine in Denver, Rhona Schwartz in Houston, Tracy Shryer in Chicago and Aleta 
Embrey in Washington.

FOR VIETNAM VETERANS, OLD HOTEL IS A HEALING PLACE

<P>
On July 4, 1976, the night of the American Bicentennial, Vietnam veteran Bill 
Leed drove his pickup truck onto the railroad tracks and headed toward the 
white light of the oncoming train. 
</P>
<P>
Leed had left Vietnam in 1969, a decorated combat veteran, but for the next 
seven years he kept his war record a secret. He burned his uniform. He did not 
tell friends he had been in the service. He tried to bury all thoughts about 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
But the patriotic fervor of the Bicentennial celebration, the drinking and the 
fireworks, brought back many painful memories. That night he headed for the 
train, "because I couldn't take it anymore . . . all this anger I had at my 
country, all these problems I had got totally out of control." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hitting Bottom 
</P>
<P>
He ended up parking on the tracks and hopping out just before the train 
obliterated his truck, but his life "bottomed out" after that July 4. He became 
an alcoholic and a drug addict. He could not hold a job. He served time in 
jail. Finally, like tens of thousands of other Vietnam combat veterans, Leed 
became homeless. 
</P>
<P>
But while many others have nowhere to turn but the local rescue mission, Leed 
heard about a shelter for homeless Vietnam veterans in Santa Barbara, the only 
one of its kind in the country, according to the local Veterans Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Leed, 40, was living in an abandoned trailer and drinking heavily. 
Today he is sober, living in a renovated hotel with other Vietnam veterans and 
working for the city's parks department. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to drink myself into oblivion to feel some sense of safety," Leed said. 
"But I feel safe here, like a tremendous burden has been lifted off my 
shoulders. There's a lot of people around here who know what I'm going through, 
who I can ask for help." 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit hotel, which opened earlier this month, is operated by the Santa 
Barbara chapter of the Vietnam Veterans of America. John Darlington, president 
of the local VVA, said projects like the hotel can redress some of the wrongs 
Vietnam veterans have endured during the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways, programs like this are 20 years too late," said Darlington, who 
manages the hotel. "Guys left Vietnam changed forever, but society didn't give 
a damn. Because so many weren't helped then, we're seeing them on the streets 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Vietnam veterans returned home, the American public began hearing 
about the "flipouts and arrests" of maladjusted veterans, Darlington said. Then 
came reports of alcoholism, drug abuse and mental disorders. 
</P>
<P>
Now the problem of homeless veterans is finally being recognized, Darlington 
said. About one third of all homeless people are veterans, with Vietnam-era 
veterans making up the largest single group, national studies indicate. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the veterans have had the whole range of problems and ended up on the 
streets, but this is where we want to stop it," said Darlington. "We've lost 
two members of the VVA in the last year to suicide. We don't want to lose any 
more." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reaction to Trauma 
</P>
<P>
There are a handful of homeless shelters for Vietnam veterans throughout the 
country, but the Santa Barbara program is the only one designed for veterans 
suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, said Denver Mills, director of 
the local Veterans Administration center. 
</P>
<P>
The disorder is a delayed emotional reaction to the trauma of combat and 
symptoms include flashbacks, nightmares, emotional numbing, panic and 
depression. Many with the disorder also have histories of alcohol and drug 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of those who served during the Vietnam era have long ago 
readjusted to civilian life, a significant number are still struggling. Vietnam 
combat veterans are widely believed to suffer from higher psychological 
casualty rates than in any other modern American war, said Jack Crane, head of 
the Homeless Veterans Project, a local referral and service group. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers in Vietnam were younger than American veterans of other modern 
wars, Crane said, faced a higher percentage of combat situations, were forced 
to fight a guerrilla war and had little time to adjust to civilian life. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the Santa Barbara hotel receive counseling for stress disorder or 
drug and alcohol problems. Those with serious substance abuse problems can be 
treated at VA hospitals and then return to the hotel. Job counseling and 
referrals are provided by a variety of local agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"We've found that homeless veterans seem to fare better when they're living 
with other veterans than those who live alone," Crane said. "There's a certain 
healing process for them in that community life." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Landmark Saved 
</P>
<P>
The program is a success on many levels. In addition to aiding the veterans, an 
important architectural landmark was preserved. The hotel where the men live is 
not just another grim downtown shelter. Designated by the city as a "structure 
of merit," the Hotel de Riviera, built in 1915, is a quaint redwood and stone 
structure with large bay windows looking out onto rose gardens, winding stone 
pathways and arbors covered with bougainvillea. 
</P>
<P>
When the property was offered for sale last year, many local residents feared 
for the future of the landmark hotel. But this is a city that has a tradition 
of architectural preservation. The Santa Barbara Community Housing Corp. raised 
enough local, state and private funds to purchase the hotel and then leased it 
to the VVA. 
</P>
<P>
Residents, who are accustomed to sleeping in bushes or on cots at rescue 
missions, say they appreciate the landscaped gardens and elegant environs of 
the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"This ain't some flophouse," Leed said. "It feels like home." 
</P>
<P>
Leed, like many veterans at the hotel, adjusted fairly well immediately after 
leaving the Army, but years later began having problems related to his Vietnam 
experience. Leed, who earned eight Air Medals, a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star 
as a helicopter door gunner, attended college for a few years after leaving 
Vietnam and then worked as a roofer. 
</P>
<P>
But one afternoon, as a neighbor was burning trash in a 50-gallon drum in his 
back yard, Leed grabbed his uniform from his closet and tossed it in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it was some vain attempt to bury something I felt I could never 
explain to anybody," Leed said. "I wanted to forget the whole insane experience 
in Vietnam and pretend I was normal." 
</P>
<P>
For seven years, Leed said, he succeeded. But after the night of the 
bicentennial, Leed, who was living in Michigan at the time, realized "I 
couldn't bury it anymore." The images of friends being killed or maimed and the 
atrocities he had seen began to plague him. His nightmares became more frequent 
and more grotesque. He began waking every night in terror, screaming, punching 
the walls. 
</P>
<P>
Leed became afraid to sleep, so he took amphetamines to stay awake. Eventually 
he began injecting methamphetamines and developed a serious drug habit. Leed 
could not hold a job and lost his apartment. He began sleeping in his car or 
spending all night nursing coffee at Denny's. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what was wrong with me," Leed said. "I didn't want to live, but 
I was too scared to die." 
</P>
<P>
He checked into a Veterans Administration hospital, where doctors eventually 
diagnosed him as being 50% disabled as a result of post traumatic stress 
disorder and awarded him a $426-a-month pension. 
</P>
<P>
Many Vietnam veterans are critical of the VA for refusing for years to 
acknowledge the high incidence of psychological problems among Vietnam 
veterans. It was not until 1980 -- seven years after major American involvement 
in the Vietnam War had ended -- that the Veterans Administration and the 
American Psychiatric Assn. approved criteria for diagnosing post traumatic 
stress disorder. 
</P>
<P>
"The Army discharged my ass 20 years ago and that was that," Leed said. "They 
didn't recognize my problems, and, for a long time, neither did I. So I wasted 
years of my life. It's pathetic." He shakes his head and briefly closes his 
eyes. "I'm 40 years old and I'm just learning how to take care of myself." 
</P>
<P>
But those who run the veterans hotel hope that many of the residents will be 
self-sufficient within a year, move into their own apartments and turn their 
rooms over to other veterans. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel can accommodate about 50 people, and the monthly cost of a double 
room is $260 a month. Funds are available for veterans while they are looking 
for work or awaiting social service benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Because the hotel receives state funding, it is prohibited from turning away 
non-veterans, but the majority of the beds are designated for Vietnam veterans. 
The hotel is expected to be full within a month; currently there are 30 
residents, 25 of them veterans. 
</P>
<P>
The huge number of Vietnam veterans among the homeless is helping change the 
perception of homeless people as simply bums and winos. Of about 2 million 
people who are homeless at some time during the year, up to 700,000 have served 
in the armed forces. About 40% of these veterans served during the Vietnam era, 
VA surveys show. 
</P>
<P>
When servicemen returned from Vietnam they faced scaled-back GI educational 
benefits and a stagnant economy. Because many veterans were poorer and less 
educated than those who avoided the war through student deferments, they were 
more vulnerable during the 1980s when many industrial jobs were eliminated and 
federal funding was sharply cut for low-cost housing. And those veterans with 
drug and alcohol problems and psychological disorders had an even harder time 
staying off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Veterans' advocates argue than many of these men made great sacrifices for 
their country and deserve some compassion and assistance in return. But many 
homeless veterans do not qualify for the narrow pensions and health programs 
offered by the VA. A Los Angeles study several years ago found that only 2% of 
the homeless veterans were receiving veteran's benefits, although many could 
qualify if they applied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fighting Bureaucracy 
</P>
<P>
"The VA seemed inaccessible to a lot of veterans when they returned from 
Vietnam," said Crane of the Homeless Veterans Project. "There was so much 
bureaucracy and red tape, and the people who worked there acted so patronizing. 
A lot of the troubled vets couldn't get the help they needed." 
</P>
<P>
In response to these complaints, VA officials say, the agency has established 
outreach centers, known as Vet Centers, throughout the country for Vietnam 
veterans. The Vet Centers offer counseling, group therapy and job referrals, 
said Denver Mills, head of the local Vet Center. The Santa Barbara center, 
Mills said, now works closely with the veterans' hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past it was very difficult for us to offer homeless vets any real 
counseling," Mills said. "If a guy comes in with no food and no job and no 
place to sleep, we're not going to say to him: 'Tell me about Vietnam.' But now 
that we have a safe place to send them we can begin talking about the traumatic 
experiences that led them to the streets. . . . We can begin talking about 
Vietnam."

VINDICATION COMES TO FUSION'S SILENT MAN; 
</P>
<P>
WHILE OTHERS GOT PUBLICITY, BRIGHAM YOUNG PHYSICIST WON SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT

<P>
Steven Jones is the other fusion scientist, the one who stood offstage as the 
drama involving B. Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann unfolded in the last two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
The Brigham Young University physicist has gone virtually unnoticed as his 
competitors at the nearby University of Utah grabbed the attention -- for 
better or worse -- after their startling claim that they had achieved nuclear 
fusion in a flask, thereby solving the world's energy problems. 
</P>
<P>
But now Jones has stepped quietly into the spotlight. And last week was his 
time of vindication. 
</P>
<P>
As Pons and Fleischmann have weathered a torrent of criticism over their 
increasingly shaky claims, Jones' finding of much lower rates of fusion has 
gained new support. Four groups of researchers from Italy and one from the Los 
Alamos National Laboratory reported at a symposium here that they had confirmed 
his findings, bringing the spotlight back in his direction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Happy About Support 
</P>
<P>
Jones said that he was "very happy" about the new support, particularly the 
results from Los Alamos. "There's no question in my mind that we are seeing a 
small but very significant scientific effect." 
</P>
<P>
Jones is happy now, but most of this year has been rather painful for him. The 
low-keyed 40-year-old physicist has been falsely accused of stealing ideas and 
of sloppy experimental work. In the rush for scientific acclaim, his 
once-friendly relationship with his two competitors has degenerated into a 
series of misunderstandings and angry phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
He has traveled the world defending his research and his claims of priority, 
and at nearly every stop he has been treated as an intruder trying to ride the 
coattails of Pons, of the University of Utah, and Fleischmann, of the 
University of Southhampton in England. Jones says the pace of the last few 
months has cost him 13 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, he has kept his composure, distanced himself from the wilder 
claims of his colleagues, and generally impressed other researchers with his 
levelheadedness and persistence. Now, whether cold fusion is eventually proved 
or disproved, some people believe that he is the only Utah researcher who will 
emerge with his reputation intact. 
</P>
<P>
The rivalry between Jones and the Pons-Fleischmann team is widely credited -- 
or blamed -- for forcing them to prematurely make their fusion claim two months 
ago. Pons and Fleischmann announced at a press conference that they had 
developed a simple technique for producing sustained nuclear fusion at room 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Using a simple cell in which palladium and platinum electrodes were immersed in 
heavy water (water in which hydrogen had been replaced with deuterium, which 
has an extra neutron), they said they were able to get out more energy than 
they were putting in. 
</P>
<P>
An electric field generated by the electrodes, they said, forced deuterium ions 
into the palladium electrode, where they fused, releasing energy in the 
process. As evidence that fusion was occurring, they cited the production of 
neutrons and tritium, both of which are byproducts of fusion. And the excess 
energy, they said, promised the world a safe, inexpensive source of energy that 
would relieve society of its dependence on fossil fuels. 
</P>
<P>
In the uproar that has followed their announcement, however, Jones has been 
largely ignored because in his own experiments he has not made extravagant 
claims for energy production. In an analogy Jones frequently uses, the energy 
he is claiming is equivalent to a dollar bill, while that claimed by chemists 
Pons and Fleischmann is equivalent to the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' work was superficially similar to that of Pons and Fleischmann, but he 
used slightly different materials. He found that this apparatus produced a 
small number of neutrons when a current was passed through the electrodes -- 
indicating that fusion was occurring. 
</P>
<P>
His results were frequently cited as a confirmation of the Pons-Fleischmann 
results, even though he was producing less than one-billionth of the energy 
they were claiming. Positive results from a number of laboratories around the 
world were also cited as supporting the University of Utah experiment, even 
though in most of the cases, the researchers were observing the same number of 
neutrons observed by Jones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Work of a Decade 
</P>
<P>
Although the public has known about cold fusion for two months, the 
behind-the-scenes story began early in the 1980s. Jones, who is a dead ringer 
for Father John Mulcahy of the "MASH" television series, spent most of the 
decade studying cold fusion triggered by muons, atomic particles about 200 
times as large as electrons. He had found that muons were very efficient at 
producing fusion. Unfortunately, the production of muons is so difficult and 
expensive, he said, that muon-catalyzed fusion is unlikely to ever be a 
commercial energy source. 
</P>
<P>
Casting about for other approaches, Jones ultimately reached the same 
conclusion as Pons and Fleischmann, that electric fields could be used to force 
deuterium ions into palladium and other metals, where they could undergo 
fusion. Jones applied to the U.S. Department of Energy for financing and got it 
in May, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
He learned about Pons' and Fleischmann's work in September, 1988, when Ryszard 
Gajewski of the Department of Energy asked him to referee a grant request from 
the University of Utah. It is customary for researchers in any given field to 
serve as referees for grant proposals, helping the funding agencies decide on 
their merit. That role came to haunt him. 
</P>
<P>
In February, a lawyer for the University of Utah called Jones and, in effect, 
accused him of stealing Pons' and Fleischmann's ideas from their grant 
proposal. Jones called Gajewski for help, Gajewski called the University of 
Utah to assure them that Jones was already working in that area, and Pons 
called Jones and apologized. "I thought we had everything worked out," Jones 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But rumors that Jones had stolen the Utah ideas started up again about the time 
Pons and Fleischmann made their public announcement. One individual even 
approached Jeffrey Holland, president of BYU, at church to broach the rumor. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really hurt. . . . That was one of the few times in my life that I have 
cried," said Jones, who was told of the incident. "I called Stan (Pons) about 
it, and he hung up on me -- although he and Martin eventually called back and 
apologized again." 
</P>
<P>
Early in March, the two groups had agreed to submit papers to the British 
journal Nature simultaneously, even though Pons and Fleischmann had argued that 
they needed another 18 months of work to confirm their results. Shortly 
thereafter, to Jones' surprise, the Utah press conference was called, the day 
before the papers were to be sent off. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agreement Denied 
</P>
<P>
He also learned that they had already sent a paper to another journal, contrary 
to their agreement with him. Various officials at the University of Utah have 
consistently denied the existence of such an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' paper was eventually published, but Pons and Fleischmann withdrew their 
Nature magazine paper when referees asked for more information. In the same 
issue of Nature that Jones' paper appeared, Nature editor John Maddox wrote a 
scathing editorial accusing both groups of failing to carry out a simple 
control experiment by performing the same experiment in normal water. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, however, had done the experiment, and it was discussed in the 
manuscript, but somehow missed by Maddox. "That hurt also," he said. Nature 
eventually ran "a very small" retraction, but Maddox never called to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Pons-Fleischmann press conference in March, Jones' life has been "a 
little crazy," he said. "I've been trying to talk whenever I can at scientific 
meetings," and he has also been visiting with other scientists to talk about 
his technique. He estimated that he has been out of town for about 90% of the 
weekdays since the press conference, "and I've lost 13 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
But so far, he has managed to make it home for every weekend but one -- an 
important consideration, he said, for a devoted family man. Jones has six 
children ranging in age from 3 to 13, and is clearly distressed by the amount 
of time he has spent away from them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expecting Seventh Child 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Lezlee, is expecting the couple's seventh child in June and, after 
one more speaking trip to Hawaii and Japan, "I'm going to stay home for a 
little while," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But his travel so far has been very productive. One trip was to Italy's 
National Institute for Nuclear Fusion, which is located in the middle of a 
superhighway tunnel through the Gran Sasso Massif, part of the Alps, to shield 
it from cosmic rays. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, physicist Antonio Bertin of the Gran Sasso laboratory told the 
fusion conference that he and his colleagues had repeated Jones' experiments 
and were obtaining a low level of neutrons, evidence that fusion was occurring. 
Bertin also reported confirming results from two other Italian labs. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Jones visited Los Alamos to begin another collaboration. Physicists 
there had been trying unsuccessfully to reproduce the Pons-Fleischmann results 
for a month and "were getting a little frustrated," Jones said. When they 
adopted his approach, however, they saw results in a few days. "I was so 
relieved we were able to get that accomplished," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Physicist Howard O. Menlove of Los Alamos reported last Wednesday that, in two 
separate types of experiments, he and his colleagues had seen the same amount 
of neutrons observed by Jones. It was the first confirmation of cold fusion by 
a U.S. government laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Jones cautions that, based on his results, "Cold fusion is hopeless as an 
energy source." But he believes that his discovery can solve many scientific 
mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
Geologists have long known, for example, that emanations from volcanoes contain 
abnormally high quantities of helium-3, an unusual form of helium that is 
formed by fusion processes. Above-normal quantities of helium-3 are also found 
in the air over the regions of Earth where the massive tectonic plates that 
support the planet's continents are separating. The source of this helium-3 has 
not been known. 
</P>
<P>
Jones believes that the helium-3 is produced by cold fusion occurring at the 
very high pressures encountered at the center of the Earth.

Similarly, astrophysicists have observed that the sun does not emit as many 
neutrinos as it should if all its energy were produced by conventional fusion. 
Jones argues that a process similar to cold fusion could be occurring in the 
cooler areas of the sun's surface. Cold fusion might be occurring on Jupiter, 
he said, which would account for the planet's mysteriously high temperature. 
</P>
<P>
But a lot of work remains, he added. "Now we know that we've seen something, we 
need to ask: What is it? What does it mean?" He concedes that the road will be 
hard. "Ultimately, we're after the truth, but sometimes there is quite a 
gauntlet you have to run to come out with it."

Eight scientific adventurers packed the last of their food and arctic gear 
Monday and tested their high-tech equipment before setting out to climb Mt. 
McKinley and find out exactly how high North America's tallest peak really is. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone says we better make the mountain larger," Jeff Yates, assistant 
project coordinator, said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to hear it's (smaller)," project leader Ron Cothren added. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect it will be different," surveyor Peter Richter said. "I'm guessing 10 
feet." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the results of the survey expedition, Mt. McKinley will remain the 
biggest thing on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
But, whether its huge hulk will grow from the generally accepted 20,320 feet or 
whether it will shrink depends on the data to be collected by the 1989 Mt. 
McKinley Global Positioning System Survey. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome probably will mean a new page in geography texts dealing with the 
mountain. But the results, which will not be known until fall after computers 
analyze all the data, depend on the team's reaching the summit.

Anselmo, Calif., depart Wednesday for Talkeetna, a town north of Anchorage, 
where they take a ski-plane to the 7,000-foot base camp on Thursday.

WAXMAN MAY ENTER RACE FOR NO. 3 POST OF HOUSE WHIP 
</P>

<P>
With House Democrats possibly facing a complete overhaul of their leadership 
team this week, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) said Monday that he may 
jump into the contest for the No. 3 post of majority whip. 
</P>
<P>
The current whip, Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Merced), announced Friday that he is 
resigning from Congress rather than go through a prolonged ethics inquiry into 
a $100,000 junk bond investment. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman, an influential leader on health and environmental issues, said that he 
is getting a "favorable response" to the idea of joining what is now a 
three-way race for whip and will make up his mind within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites Geographical Balance 
</P>
<P>
The Californian, a liberal from the largest state delegation in the House, 
argued that he would give "ideological and geographical balance" to a 
prospective new House Democratic leadership team headed by moderates from 
Washington state and Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
With House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) expected to resign, possibly Wednesday, 
in an ethics scandal over his finances, Rep. Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) is 
regarded as certain to move into the job. Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) is 
considered likely to succeed Foley as majority leader. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman, explaining his contention that he would provide geographical balance as 
whip, said in an interview: "Although Washington state is on the same coast as 
California, no one thinks of them as the same. California is unique." 
</P>
<P>
When reminded that Southern Democrats are insisting that their region continue 
to be represented in the leadership after Wright's departure, Waxman asserted 
that Gephardt could fill the role because "Missouri is, in some sense, 
Southern." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big State Delegation 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Waxman said, it is important for California to hold onto a 
leadership post because its 27 Democrats make up more than one-tenth of the 
House total of 260. 
</P>
<P>
Already seeking the whip post are Reps. Beryl Anthony Jr. (D-Ark.), David E. 
Bonior (D-Mich.) and William H. Gray III (D-Pa.). 
</P>
<P>
Coelho, who became whip in 1986, faces a preliminary criminal investigation by 
the Justice Department concerning the purchase of a $100,000 junk bond, 
underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., with the help of a $50,000 loan 
from Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn. 
</P>
<P>
If he runs for whip, Waxman may run into questions about his own involvement 
with Drexel, which is facing federal charges of securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a Drexel representative enlisted Waxman to write to the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, demanding that the agency abandon efforts 
to force Drexel to move its high-yield junk bond department from Beverly Hills 
to the firm's headquarters in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Signing the letter with Waxman were six other Los Angeles area congressmen, 
including House Ethics Committee Chairman Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Senators Also Sent Letters 
</P>
<P>
California Sens. Alan Cranston and Pete Wilson wrote similar letters -- 
Cranston at the request of Coelho, who had been contacted by Los Angeles Mayor 
Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman, who received $5,000 in speech honorariums and $500 in campaign 
contributions from Drexel in 1987, said Monday that he did not expect the 
letter to create problems because "I was only helping constituents" who work at 
the Beverly Hills office. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Waxman captured the chairmanship of the House Energy and Commerce 
subcommittee on health and the environment in a brilliant but controversial 
election coup. Opponents charged that Waxman had bought the plum post by making 
campaign contributions to colleagues from a personal political action committee 
financed by special interests. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman acknowledged Monday that the contributions "did help me because the 
people I gave to at that particular time would not have returned to office if 
they had not had that support." 
</P>
<P>
Like other ambitious House members, Waxman still contributes to numerous 
Democratic candidates from his personal PAC -- a fund that is separate from his 
campaign committee. As in 1978, the PAC contributions could provide crucial 
support for Waxman if he decides to run for whip. 
</P>
<P>
In commenting on the ethics uproar that has distracted Congress from most other 
business, Waxman said that "we need to get an ethics bill passed that clarifies 
some of the loopholes that seem to be in the law. We have to try to restore 
some of the public confidence in government." 
</P>
<P>
He supported ethics investigations into "legitimate problems," noting the 
Wright case specifically, but deplored indications that both Democrats and 
Republicans may seek further partisan inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
"The House has a lot of important issues to fight about, but not this (ethics) 
on a partisan basis," he said.

GORBACHEV PLAN FOR DEEP CUTS IN FORCES SPARKED BUSH'S ARMS POLICY INITIATIVES 
</P>

<P>
The Bush Administration spent nearly four months on a slow, cautious analysis 
of foreign policy and then, in a flurry of meetings, produced one of the 
biggest U.S. foreign policy initiatives of the decade in barely two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The impetus, Administration officials said Monday, came early this month, when 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev outlined the latest Soviet arms proposal 
to Secretary of State James A. Baker III in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials, who had been sharply critical of Gorbachev, now say 
that the Soviet leader's proposal -- offering to make deep cuts in Soviet 
forces -- was a major breakthrough that convinced them he is serious about arms 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
In the days following Baker's meeting with Gorbachev, both critics of the 
Administration and many of its allies fretted that the United States was doing 
little to respond to the Soviet peace offensive. In fact, however, the 
Administration was moving rapidly and in secret to prepare a response. 
</P>
<P>
When Baker returned from Moscow in early May, a senior White House official 
said Monday, the President directed the Pentagon to prepare a series of options 
that he could propose at the NATO summit. 
</P>
<P>
A week after Baker's return, as Bush vacationed at his summer retreat in 
Kennebunkport, Me., his top defense advisers traveled there to outline several 
ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Undersecretary Paul G. Wolfowitz, 
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and his deputy, Robert M. Gates, 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. and his vice chairman, 
Gen. Robert T. Herres, and Chief of Staff John H. Sununu briefed Bush for 
several hours over lunch in the President's seaside home. 
</P>
<P>
Although no details of the meeting leaked to the public, one effect of the 
session was noticeable within days. When Bush traveled that Sunday, May 21, to 
Boston University to deliver a speech on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
and its relations with the Soviets, his tone toward Gorbachev was far warmer 
than he and his aides had used only days before. 
</P>
<P>
When Bush returned to Washington, meetings on the proposals continued, 
Administration officials said. On Tuesday, May 23, with the package taking 
final shape, the Administration dispatched Gates and Undersecretary of State 
Laurence S. Eagleburger to Europe to begin briefing the NATO allies. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, Rome, Bonn, London, Brussels and Amsterdam, Eagleburger and Gates 
described a series of options that were under consideration, European officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Option for 50% Cut 
</P>
<P>
Among them were the proposals that Bush offered Monday and some that would have 
gone even further, including one option for a 50% reduction of U.S. combat 
forces in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
So closely held were the deliberations that followed, however, that the NATO 
officials heard nothing of the reactions to the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
The same day the two left, Soviet officials at the conventional arms reductions 
talks in Vienna formally presented the proposal that Gorbachev had outlined to 
Baker. The proposal accepted many of NATO's ideas for control of non-nuclear 
weapons and confirmed the Administration in its belief that Gorbachev meant 
what he said about arms control, an Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Wednesday, May 24, Bush flew to New London, Conn., to speak on 
East-West relations. Displeased with the tone of his prepared text, Bush tore 
it up and substituted language that praised Gorbachev's initiatives even more 
clearly than he had done three days earlier in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the day before Bush departed for Europe, the President signed off 
on the final package. That afternoon, when reporters asked if the 
Administration had any dramatic, last-minute proposal to unveil at the NATO 
meeting, a senior Administration official smiled enigmatically and said: "Wait 
and see." 
</P>
<P>
Alton Keel, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, and Stephen Ledogar, the chief U.S. 
representative to the arms reduction talks in Vienna, were briefed on Bush's 
proposal only hours before the President described it to a closed meeting of 
NATO allies in a speech that took roughly twice his alloted 10 minutes and 
seized center stage at the alliance's 40th anniversary summit.

ALLIES UNANIMOUS IN HAILING BUSH INITIATIVE

America's allies at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit meeting here 
reacted with unstinting praise Monday for President Bush's surprise arms 
reduction proposals. 
</P>
<P>
As West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl put it: "With his great initiative for 
rapidly reducing conventional arms, President Bush has today paved the way for 
further success of our alliance. 
</P>
<P>
"I congratulate him on this far-sighted step, with which he has once more 
impressively affirmed the United States' leadership." 
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was reported by aides to have said 
that Bush's proposals for cutting conventional arms in Europe had "transformed" 
the summit. 
</P>
<P>
All other national leaders praised the Bush initiative, even French President 
Francois Mitterrand, who is loath to see any major troop reduction in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The French, while not participating members of NATO's military structure, have 
been the most hawkish in maintaining a large standing army -- 50,000 troops in 
West Germany -- and an independent nuclear weapons force. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's impressive," said Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of 
Bush's initiative. "It is worthy of very serious consideration, which is what 
it's receiving." 
</P>
<P>
Asked for her reaction, Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Haarlem Brundtland 
responded: "Very positive," the same words used by Spanish Prime Minister 
Felipe Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
"Good proposal," said Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens, and Danish 
Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen called Bush's ideas "excellent" and "very 
positive." 
</P>
<P>
"It will give NATO the initiative in the conventional arms talks in Vienna," he 
added.

The following are excerpts from President Bush's speech delivered Monday at a 
closed-door meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization's North Atlantic 
Council: 
</P>
<P>
The fact of change in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe is unmistakeable. In 
fact, the change is revolutionary. We want to see it continue. We want it to 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
While the outside world cannot determine the ultimate success of (the Soviet 
reform movement known as) perestroika, we can and must be creative in 
encouraging positive trends toward greater reform and more freedom. We can look 
for ways to promote the institutionalization of change in human rights, in the 
economy, in the military. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Conventional forces alone have not guaranteed peace in Europe, and nuclear 
weapons continue to play a key role in demonstrating to any aggressor that war 
in Europe is unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
The proof that this alliance has followed a wise course is that the Soviet 
Union is now rethinking its pursuit of a clear military superiority that has so 
long compelled us to devote our valuable resources toward a necessary defense. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
We may be on the verge of a revolutionary and more ambitious arms control 
agreement than anyone considered possible. Thus, I believe the alliance should 
now act decisively and creatively. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, I am proposing that NATO countries consider the following 
initiatives: 
</P>
<P>
First, we should lock in the Eastern agreement to Western-proposed ceilings on 
tanks and armored troop carriers. We should also seek agreement on a common 
numerical ceiling for artillery in the range between NATO's and the (Warsaw) 
Pact's numbers, provided definitional problems can be solved. All reduced 
equipment should be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Second, we should expand our current proposal to include all land-based combat 
aircraft and helicopters, by proposing that both sides reduce in these 
categories to a level 15% below the current NATO totals. Given the Warsaw 
Pact's advantage in numbers, the Pact would have to make far deeper reductions 
than NATO to establish parity at these lower levels. As with the other 
reductions, the equipment should be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Third, we should propose a 20% cut in combat manpower in U.S. "stationed 
forces," and a resulting ceiling on U.S. and Soviet ground and air forces 
stationed outside of national territory in the Atlantic-to-Urals zone at 
approximately 275,000 each. This reduction to parity, a fair and balanced level 
of strength, would compel the Soviets to reduce their 600,000-strong Red Army 
in Eastern Europe by 325,000. These reduced forces would be demobilized. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, but very important, we want to accelerate the timetable for reaching 
and implementing such an agreement. Given Warsaw Pact movement toward the 
Western approach, there is no reason why a five- to six-year timetable as 
suggested by General Secretary (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev is necessary. I believe 
that it should be possible to reach such an agreement in six months to a year 
and to accomplish the reductions by 1991 or 1992. 
</P>
<P>
And so, I call on General Secretary Gorbachev to join us in accelerating the 
timetable for agreement and implementation of these proposals. With these 
ambitious new initiatives, NATO can create a further opportunity for the 
Soviets to demonstrate their new thinking and reduce their military burden. 
Indeed, if Moscow accepts this fair offer, the results could dramatically 
increase stability on the Continent and transform the military map of Europe.

TASS SALUTES BUSH TROOP PLAN AS 1ST ANSWER BY U.S. TO SOVIET OFFERS

Although the Soviet government had no immediate comment on President Bush's 
proposal for across-the-board, East-West troop and arms reductions in Europe, 
the official Soviet news agency Tass welcomed it as "the first answer of the 
new American Administration to concrete proposals put forward earlier by the 
Soviet Union and the Warsaw treaty organization." 
</P>
<P>
Tass noted that, "for the first time, helicopters and combat aircraft are 
mentioned, both of which the United States refused to negotiate on before," 
thus meeting a major Soviet demand. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Gen. Nikolai Chervov, a member of the Soviet general staff, said before 
the Bush speech that Moscow and its allies were waiting for the United States 
and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to respond to recent Soviet 
"constructive steps" intended to move arms control negotiations ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"The world public has the right to expect the leaders of the NATO countries not 
to modernize their short-range nuclear forces in Europe," Chervov told Tass, 
"but to take specific measures to reduce NATO armaments in response to the 
good-will of the Warsaw Treaty Organization."

<P>
This city's dance card has never been busier or more diverse than it is this 
season. And though the local dance community continues to grow, only a portion 
of the action on local stages has been generated by home-grown troupes. 
</P>
<P>
Two major presenters -- the San Diego Foundation for the Performing Arts and 
San Diego Performances, the new kid on the block -- packaged 1988-89 seasons 
featuring a spectrum of internationally known dance troupes. 
</P>
<P>
And filling in most of the cracks left by these two groups are UCSD's 
University Events and Sushi, a downtown arts organization committed to 
cutting-edge dance and performance, emphasizing lesser-known but widely 
acclaimed dance ensembles and non-mainstream artists. 
</P>
<P>
These four presenters alone will have brought San Diego aficionados a bumper 
crop of nearly two dozen imported dance events by the time the season comes to 
a close in June. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the events have come in clusters, with one troupe arriving right on the 
heels of another, or even overlapping, as did the Joffrey Ballet and the David 
Gordon Pick Up Company concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Can the local community support such an explosion of big-league dance? Even the 
folks in the front lines of the dance revolution have their doubts. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if we can support it all," said Suzanne Townsend, founding 
director of San Diego Performances. 
</P>
<P>
"But one thing is sure, if you're going to have this many attractions, the 
spacing of the events has to be better." 
</P>
<P>
Until Townsend teamed up with arts angel Danah Fayman to sponsor the first full 
season of brand-name dance in 1983, San Diego was only an occasional stop on 
the dance trail. Their maiden effort, with Joffrey Ballet as its centerpiece, 
was a smash. 
</P>
<P>
The two gurus continued to expand dance horizons on the home front until they 
parted company about five years later. Each carved her own niche, and for the 
1988-89 season alone, they had booked 15 attractions between them. 
</P>
<P>
Townsend brought the big-name dance companies, under the San Diego Performances 
banner, while Fayman held the fort with the foundation. Instead of fighting it 
out with Townsend for the high-profile ballet troupes, Fayman forged a path for 
top-notch but fringe-level modern dance. 
</P>
<P>
But the growth and success did not continue. 
</P>
<P>
Even troupes with household names, such as American Ballet Theatre and Joffrey 
Ballet, fell short of sell-out crowds in San Diego this season, Townsend 
acknowledges. And Fayman -- with a heavy roster of unfamiliar attractions -- 
found herself unable to fill houses or sustain the full season. 
</P>
<P>
Last winter, to avoid fiscal disaster, Fayman lopped off two of the events 
scheduled for 1989, drastically cut back her administrative staff and embarked 
on a major fund-raising effort. 
</P>
<P>
Those actions turned things around for the organization in a hurry, according 
to the foundation's interim director Fred Colby. 
</P>
<P>
"We're deficit-free for the first time in our career, and we're planning for a 
new season," he said. "But we learned that San Diego is not ready for an all 
avant-garde season. I think next year will probably be a period of adjustment 
to reestablish a base of strength, but we still have a commitment to bring in 
some avant-garde events." 
</P>
<P>
Fayman is convinced the dance scene has reached its saturation point. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's too much to expect the community to absorb all this dance," she 
said. "We're going to cut back to four events next year, and only two of them 
will be dance. I love dance and I always have, but the main idea of the 
foundation is to expand the picture here. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time we started, there was a big hole. No one was bringing in dance. We 
want to introduce new things, quality things, that aren't being brought into 
San Diego, and we'll continue to do that. They just may not all be dance." 
</P>
<P>
Though Townsend expects her 1989-90 season to be down to six events from eight, 
she blames logistics not economics. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm cutting back a little next season, but it won't be a major cutback," she 
assured. "We still want to bring in things that should be seen in San Diego on 
an annual basis, like the Joffrey and the ABT. 
</P>
<P>
"It's rare when you have this much dance available," she said. "You're at the 
mercy of the marketplace, and this year every company we wanted was touring. 
Some only do the West Coast every other year, so you have to take them when 
they're available." 
</P>
<P>
"I think we went too far too fast," said California Ballet's Maxine Mahon. "The 
ticket-buying public can't afford to attend everything, and they don't have 
time for it all, either. We did OK with our 'Romeo and Juliet,' but we had to 
spend a lot more money promoting it. We knew it would be a busy spring, so we 
concentrated more on pre-sale (subscriptions). The door sales were not as 
good." 
</P>
<P>
At Sushi, the dance calendar will continue to expand next season, according to 
director Lynne Schuette. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had very good attendance for our dance events, and we're getting more 
dance proposals for this year. Since we're happy with the work and the 
audiences are responding, we'll keep at it. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems we've had better dance audiences than ever this year," she continued. 
"All the publicity for other dance concerts hasn't hurt us. If they like dance, 
people are trying (Sushi). We have several dancers booked already for the fall 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's a gap between the really big presenters and the really small -- 
like us," she noted. "We need more medium-sized presenters. We're doing Stephen 
Petronio (in association with the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art), but I 
don't know how much of that we can do on our budget." 
</P>
<P>
Though the two big budget powerhouses, Townsend and Fayman, have different 
philosophies as presenters, both agree that their ultimate survival depends on 
prudent business practices. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to operate in a cold-blooded, business-like manner," Fayman said. "I 
believe you can slip in a couple of (esoterics), but you can't keep asking for 
charitable support when attendance is low. We may do more commercial 
programming to help pay for the others. Although we actually raised more money 
this year than ever, people were reacting to the emergency. We don't want to be 
in that position again." 
</P>
<P>
"It's an uphill battle all the way," Townsend said. "Dance tends to be the 
least subscribed compared to the symphony or the opera. You have to have the 
name brands to introduce them to dance." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to cut costs, the foundation and San Diego Performances have begun 
to try different approaches. The foundation collaborated with UCSD's University 
Events program to sponsor Gordon's Pick Up Company, and that alliance may be 
repeated again next year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an experiment," Colby said. "We'll find out how we can cooperate in 
the future. But we definitely complement each other. We substantially reduced 
our administrative budget, because UCSD helped with the promotional side." 
</P>
<P>
As Lynne Peterson of University Events pointed out, "it enabled us to get a big 
project on campus. Since we don't have the resources to fund anything like 
David Gordon on our own budget, it's a nice merger. As presenters, we try to 
bring audiences and companies together, so I was tickled to death with this 
arrangement. We're always looking for new projects." 
</P>
<P>
Townsend is toying with the idea of joint-producing with the university next 
season as well. But her organization is already part of a major network 
designed to reduce the cost of presenting internationally known dance troupes. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of encouragement (from major grant-givers) for collaborative 
work," she said. "As a member of the International Presenting Network, we share 
the expense of bringing in touring companies with other presenters. It's a lot 
more work and a lot of negotiations that way, but you get a good fee, and the 
overall cost is much lower." 
</P>
<P>
One of the ongoing problems plaguing local and imported dance alike, is the 
programming overlap that puts presenters in direct competition with each other 
for the same audiences. Though the San Diego Area Dance Alliance acts as a 
clearing house for dance events, conflicts continue to cause concern for 
audiences and promoters. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Corcoran, executive director of the alliance, acknowledges the need for 
more monitoring of dance schedules, but noted, "There wasn't much interest from 
members in clearing dates through the alliance." 
</P>
<P>
When availability of space and artists is on a catch-as-catch-can basis -- as 
it so often is in San Diego -- clearing dates with the competition is often a 
luxury presenters can't afford, as Fayman pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
"There are already very few dates left in the Civic and Symphony Hall," she 
said, referring to the fall season. "And there just aren't enough theaters for 
dance, so we won't have much choice by the time we get our season ready."

Actress Kelly McGillis is working hard to increase awareness on the subject of 
rape. McGillis, a rape victim herself, recently hosted "Against Her Will," a 
documentary on the Lifetime cable network about rape on college campuses. "The 
fact that so many men (1-in-13) admitted to forcing women into sex was amazing 
to me," she said. "I thought it was incredibly high. The number of women who 
had been forced into sex and didn't know it (73%) at the time was amazing, 
too." McGillis also recently worked with a Santa Monica rape crisis center to 
make a video that will be distributed on college campuses and she and her 
husband are working on another video for victims of violent crimes. Claudia

LEWITZKY, DOYENNE OF DANCE, GIVEN ROLE IN ARTS FESTIVAL

UC San Diego's annual Undergraduate Arts Festival features prominent figures in 
literature and the arts. But it has yet to name someone from the world of dance 
to the prestigious post of Regents Lecturer -- at least not until this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The committee decided to dedicate the festival to Danah Fayman (founder of the 
San Diego Foundation for the Performing Arts and patron saint of dance in San 
Diego) for her contributions to the community and the university," said 
Patricia Rincon of the festival committee. "That sparked our interest in 
getting a dance artist." 
</P>
<P>
Without hesitation, they selected Los Angeles-based Bella Lewitzky, the most 
respected dancemaker in the country without a New York address. A trailblazer 
in modern dance for five decades, Lewitzky has earned a litany of honors for 
choreographic achievement. Her residency on campus, today through Saturday, 
will include intensive workshop sessions and a free public lecture Wednesday at 
8 p.m. at Peterson Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Bella is a wonderful spokesperson to bring here," said Rincon. "She has the 
knowledge in choreography and dance to share with other university artists. She 
has done a lot of experimental work in the field, and she has the ability to 
explain things very well, which is quite rare. She's also an excellent 
instructor, and she'll spend a lot of time lecturing and teaching classes 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Lewitzky is ecstatic about "penetrating the citadel of the university," she 
said by phone from Phoenix. "You don't get a lot of interchange among 
departments in other residencies, and I think the opportunity to be a scholar 
in residence -- where I can address my favorite subject without (departmental) 
barriers -- is wonderful. I've never done it before, and I don't know of any 
other program like this anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"My mission is to help dance receive recognition for its value as a serious 
subject. People still think of it as entertainment or athleticism. They don't 
accept it as a form of communication, like a novel or a symphony. There's a 
limit to how much you can do in a short period of time, but this is a lever, 
and without question it should help local dance." 
</P>
<P>
Lewitzky's lecture on Wednesday, titled "Why the Arts?" is free, and as Rincon 
noted, "we're really trying to open these events to the public." 
</P>
<P>
Typically, dance companies are reflections of their directors, in more ways 
than one. If you take a close look at all the local troupes, just about every 
one is anchored to the choreography as well as the artistic vision of its head 
honcho. The one glaring exception is Stage Seven Dance Theater, led by Kathryn 
Irey. 
</P>
<P>
Irey not only maintains the lowest public profile of any company captain, but 
she also exerts the least stylistic influence on her dancers. In fact, not one 
work in the company's repertory bears her choreographic stamp. 
</P>
<P>
"I tend to stay in the background," she acknowledged in a recent break from 
teaching company class. "Many times, egos get in the way of art, and some day 
my ego may loom large as well. But for now, I'm just happy to leave a lingering 
image in the audience's mind and to foster the development of my dancers. I 
have no desire to choreograph for them." 
</P>
<P>
Irey credits an eclectic dance background for her focus and notes, "It's very 
stimulating to work with different choreographers. It's my job to create an 
atmosphere where people are comfortable enough to create. And it's my 
experience that offering audiences variety can fill houses." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the formula has worked well enough for Irey and her company of 12. They 
have survived on little more than a shoestring budget for years. And they 
manage to attract respectable houses, despite a penchant for scheduling their 
infrequent appearances in direct competition with other dance groups. 
</P>
<P>
Good Timing: It's just a coincidence, but the Lewitzky residency at UC San 
Diego dovetails with the Dance Program's annual faculty concert. The 
performance takes place at Mandeville Auditorium at 8 p.m. on June 3. Lewitzky 
won't be contributing any dance designs, but as Rincon noted, "She'll be very 
much involved with the dancers, so she should have a lot of influence on the 
concert." 
</P>
<P>
Although Jean Isaacs was listed among the contributing choreographers to the 
San Diego Area Dance Alliance's Performing Arts Lab on May 21, her work never 
made it to the stage. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to show a new piece so I could get some feedback on it before we take 
it to Europe," said Isaacs. "But after the New York trip and everything else, I 
was too wiped out to get it ready in time. I guess we'll just have to wait 
until we get back and do it at one of our own low-techs." 
</P>
<P>
Isaacs and a few of her Three's Company dancers will depart on June 9 for three 
weeks of performances and workshops throughout Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Herman is on vacation. His regular Spotlight column will resume upon his 
return.

Jimmy Stewart hasn't acted in about 5 years, but the 81-year-old actor says 
he's ready for another movie, if the right script comes along. "Can't play 
cowboys anymore," he adds, however. After he came back from the Army in 1941, 
he returned to Hollywood fearful of his future, with his contract expired and 
wondering if the public would still remember him. "That's why I thank 
(director) Frank Capra in prayers every day," he said. " 'Cause he just, out of 
the blue, called me up and said, 'I got an idea for a story, and why don't you 
come down to the house?"' The result was "It's a Wonderful Life" which was not 
successful when it came out but has since become a much-loved Christmastime 
perennial. "Looking back over it, I can just see that the picture meant more to 
me than any other," Stewart said. Claudia Puig

ANGELS EXERCISE INSANITY CLAWS, DEFEAT BREWERS, 12-3

Not only are the Angels winning -- Monday's 12-3 victory over the Milwaukee 
Brewers moved them 16 games over .500 -- but they're laughing and cutting up 
while they do it. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the short life of Skippy the lobster. 
</P>
<P>
Skippy was a New England crustacean purchased by one Glenn Hoffman in Boston's 
Logan Airport Sunday night and slipped into the handbag of one Bert Blyleven. 
This was to be a measure of payback for Blyleven, who this year has introduced 
the art of the practical joke to the Angel clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"I put my bag down and somebody took it," Blyleven said. "I went off looking 
for it and when I came back, the bag was right where I'd left it. But all of a 
sudden, I had an extra friend." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven brought the lobster, still alive, aboard the team charter to Milwaukee 
and kept it in a small bucket of water. Occasionally, Blyleven would lift 
Skippy out of the water and perch him on his shoulder, like a pirate and his 
parrot. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven reported that Skippy survived the flight but not the bus ride to the 
team's downtown hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"He started snapping at me," Blyleven said. "I had to break his legs." 
</P>
<P>
After Blyleven came back the next day to pitch seven innings for the victory 
against the Brewers, Angel Manager Doug Rader couldn't resist a final few 
one-liners over the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's win one for Skippy," Rader said, smiling. "We're going to bury him at 
sea, I think. First, he'll be cremated in drawn butter, then buried at sea." 
</P>
<P>
Loose baseball teams usually are successful teams. Right now, the Angels fit 
the description. They moved into first place, .007 percentage points ahead of 
the Oakland Athletics (.660). Monday afternoon, they won for the 22nd time in 
their last 28 games -- that's a .786 winning percentage -- and did so by 
getting a season-high 18 hits against four Milwaukee pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Every member of the Angels' starting lineup had at least one hit, with Lance 
Parrish going four for four with a home run, Wally Joyner scoring three runs on 
three hits and Dick Schofield driving in three runs with a single and a triple. 
</P>
<P>
Chili Davis and Claudell Washington also drove in a pair of runs apiece, Devon 
White made a spectacular diving catch in center field and Blyleven won for the 
fifth time in seven decisions. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, it all looked easier than it had looked in the beginning, as 
Blyleven gave up four hits and two runs in the first two innings. The victim of 
Saturday's rainout in Boston, Blyleven seemed out of sorts early on, yielding 
two doubles and a walk in the first inning and two more singles in the second. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of think (the rainout) affected him," Rader said. "To get yourself 
ready, emotionally and physically, to pitch one day, and then put it off, I'm 
sure it did take its toll. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying I'm surprised, but I was pleased he could go seven. When the 
game began, five innings seemed a more realistic goal." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven gave up a run-scoring double to Jim Gantner and a run-scoring single 
to Paul Molitor and the score was 2-2 after two innings. The Angels then sent 
10 batters to the plate in the third inning, scoring five times to turn the 
game into a runaway. 
</P>
<P>
The key hits in the inning were run-scoring singles by Davis and Jack Howell 
and a two-run single by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels scored two runs in the fourth inning, two in the sixth and saw 
Parrish cap the scoring with a titanic eighth-inning home run off reliever Jay 
Aldrich. The home run, Parrish's seventh of the season, was his fifth in nine 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody else seems to be hitting the ball well," Parrish said. "I'm just 
trying to chip in. I've had streaks like this before, but it's been a while. 
When I was in Detroit, I was streaky as far as home runs were concerned. It 
didn't happen as often in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"But I feel better at the plate now than I ever remember in Philadelphia. We're 
winning, we're having fun and that takes all the pressure off. Now, I'm making 
a contribution and that adds to the fun." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven, another new Angel on the comeback trail, was appreciative of the 
support. In three of Blyleven's five victories, the Angels have scored 10 runs 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
Bring the noise, Blyleven says. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it," Blyleven said. "I need a lot of runs to win. Maybe when I was 19, 
I liked to win, 1-0, but I'd rather win, 20-2, right now." 
</P>
<P>
That tends to lessen the strain on 38-year-old muscles. After the third-inning 
Angel outburst, Blyleven gave up only five more hits -- including a home run to 
Yount in the fifth -- before giving way to relievers Greg Minton and Bryan 
Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
Next up for Blyleven: revenge. As he dressed in front of his locker, Blyleven 
cast a wary eye toward Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
"His time's coming," Blyleven whispered. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants of Milwaukee, lock up your lobsters. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
To dive or not to dive is seldom a question for Devon White, who rarely leaves 
his feet in the pursuit of fly balls because, as he puts it, "I just get to a 
lot of balls without having to dive for them." Monday, however, he stretched 
out in right-center field to take away an extra-base hit from Glenn Braggs -- 
and the breath away from Angel Manager Doug Rader. "Sheesh," Rader said. "He's 
phenomenal. Every day he does something that either amazes you or astounds you 
or whatever adjective you can think of." White made the catch in the bottom of 
the eighth inning, with the Angels already ahead, 12-3. "I'm not going to run 
into a wall in that situation," White said, "but when I went after that ball, I 
realized I could get to it. I think Claudell (Washington, Angel right fielder) 
was thinking the same thing. I thought we were going to bump heads." Instead, 
Washington backed up White and wound up with what he called "the best view in 
the house." 
</P>
<P>
Reserve outfielder Dante Bichette prompted a few extra smiles in the Angel 
clubhouse by playing catch with a batboy during the seventh-inning stretch -- 
while teammates and spectators stood at attention as "God Bless America" played 
over the County Stadium sound system, in accordance with Memorial Day. 
Bichette, warming up in left field, eventually turned around to survey the 
scene, then quickly ripped off his cap and spun again to face the flag. "Kate 
Smith was into her 15th verse, and Dante's still playing lob-toss with the bat 
boy," Rader said. Bichette, in his defense, claimed not to have heard the 
music. "I didn't even know it was happening," he said. Then, smiling, he added, 
"Why don't you guys get on the batboys? I'm sure they saw everybody else 
standing at attention." Bichette probably can't wait for the next session of 
the Angels' kangaroo court. "Well, at least I got some press today," he said.

This was a day when basketball fans from both the winning and losing sides must 
have felt like chanting: "Can't Beat L.A.! Can't Beat L.A.!" 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit Pistons were held to 86 points, made a miserable 36% of their 
shots, messed up 15 free throws, got just three field goals from their starting 
front line -- and still defeated the Chicago Bulls, 86-80, Monday afternoon at 
Chicago Stadium, to tie the National Basketball Assn.'s Eastern Conference 
finals at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Best thing Detroit had going for it was its bench, which outscored Chicago's, 
36-2. Dennis Rodman was particularly mean and hungry, ripping down 18 rebounds 
and taking turns hounding Michael Jordan, who, during the last three periods, 
managed only two baskets. Jordan scored 23 points, half of what he got in 
Saturday's Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
With the Lakers obliged to wait until June 6 to begin rumbling with one of 
these teams for the NBA championship, it might be wise for them not to study 
these latest game films. 
</P>
<P>
It was an ugly but not totally uninteresting little game, made uglier by a 
pint-sized rum bottle, flung from the stands, that smashed onto the court early 
in the fourth quarter, scaring the wits out of several players. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's 90th consecutive sellout crowd of 18,676 came hoping for more of 
Michael Python's Flying Circus, but instead saw Jordan and the Bulls yield 
their home-court advantage. Game 5 will be played Wednesday night at Auburn 
Hills, Mich., where the Pistons have won 26 of their last 27 games. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly out of desperation, due in great part to Detroit's slam-dance defense, 
the Bulls fired up a club-record 20 three-point shots, missing 14 of them. They 
made only 27 baskets from any distance, a new low for the franchise in 
postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Pistons, they didn't make any more baskets than the Bulls did. 
That's how feeble both of these offenses were. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit's domination was on the boards, 56-40, and at the free-throw line, 
where it had 19 more chances than Chicago did. For most of the second half, 
Coach Chuck Daly completely abandoned his starting center and forwards, playing 
James Edwards, John Salley and Rodman -- "Buddha," "the Spider" and "the Worm," 
as known to their friends -- instead. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Laimbeer scored two points, giving him six in the last two games. Mark 
Aguirre spent only 15 minutes on the court, donating six points. Rick Mahorn 
played a minute less, pointlessly. Detroit's Front Line II was far more 
productive, and Daly intends to use this unit more and more. 
</P>
<P>
Laimbeer injured his left hand slightly, another reason he played only nine 
minutes of the second half. The Pistons hardly missed him, though, what with 
Edwards scoring 13 points, and Laimbeer returned for the game's final 82 
seconds, in time to block a Horace Grant shot and snuff Chicago's last hope. 
</P>
<P>
Isiah Thomas also was a factor for Detroit, as he has been -- one way or 
another -- throughout this series. Thomas had 27 points Monday to top all 
scorers. In Detroit's two victories, he has scored 60 points. In the two 
losses, he scored 14. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the easy way out, to make that the reason we win or lose," Thomas said. 
"The key to our winning is our defense, not my scoring. Our team goes beyond my 
leading them every night." 
</P>
<P>
Any team that can afford not to start Rodman is no one-man team. Eight of 
Rodman's 18 rebounds were on offense, and Chicago only had nine offensive 
boards as a team. 
</P>
<P>
"Rodman was everywhere," Chicago guard John Paxson said. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit needed him to be. At halftime, Thomas and guard partner Joe Dumars had 
all but two of Detroit's baskets. Nobody on the starting front line had a hoop. 
The Pistons made only a dozen field goals in 24 minutes, and the only reason 
they broke the 40-point barrier was that Thomas hit a three-pointer at the 
horn. 
</P>
<P>
It was a truly gruesome half of basketball. The Bulls made one-of-17 shots over 
one span, succeeding only on a Scottie Pippen breakaway dunk. The Pistons 
answered with an equally pitiful two-of-19 stretch, from the middle of the 
first period to midway through the second. After 18 minutes, Detroit had 28 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago led early by as many as seven points, but the last edge it held in the 
game was at 56-55, late in the third period. It was then that Edwards got hot, 
twice sinking turnaround jumpers in the lane, with Salley adding a dunk and 
Thomas two long jumpers. After three periods, the Pistons led, 64-60. 
</P>
<P>
With 9 1/2 minutes to play, Pippen faked two Pistons out of their shoes, but 
not Rodman, who planted himself and took a charge, nullifying Pippen's dunk. A 
presumably angry spectator hurled an empty pint of rum that landed near 
Detroit's free-throw line, no less than 15 or 20 feet from the nearest player. 
No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden I saw some white thing flying toward us," Rodman said. "Then 
it smashed. I said, 'Omigod, I hope that's not a bottle.' And sure enough, it 
was. 
</P>
<P>
"People are scary, man." 
</P>
<P>
Four more points by Edwards quickly put Detroit up by eight, and after a 
three-pointer by Chicago's Craig Hodges, the Pistons got a corner shot by 
Vinnie Johnson and a layup by Rodman for their largest lead to that time, 
76-67. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls never threatened thereafter. Jordan did get a dunk -- only his second 
in three games -- but Laimbeer's rejection of Grant with 32 seconds remaining 
cost Chicago a chance to cut Detroit's advantage to four, and the Pistons had 
the game they needed so desperately. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is, we're alive," Daly said. "That's all we are is alive. We 
know the Bulls believe they can win another one in our building. But at least 
we've got our heads above water again." 
</P>
<P>
Rodman, too, was properly respectful. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't realize that Chicago is a great team," Rodman said. "If you 
forget that, they'll be all over you. Especially with Jordan. You've got to use 
two or three guys on him, just to keep him under control. Any time you hold 
Michael Jordan somewhere around 20 points, you're doing a great job." 
</P>
<P>
Arguably the NBA's top defensive player, Rodman does not draw Jordan on defense 
more of the time partly because he is not in Detroit's starting lineup and 
partly because guard Joe Dumars, who does guard Jordan, does not match up with 
Bull forward Scottie Pippen. The Pistons threw Rodman, Dumars and even Vinnie 
Johnson at Jordan in Monday's game, keeping fresh legs on him whenever 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"My own shots weren't falling, so I tried to spread it around to the other 
guys," Jordan said. "But, as a team, we couldn't hit baskets when we needed 
them. And we didn't get second shots. They were faster and more aggressive over 
every loose ball than we were." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bull Coach Doug Collins: "They make Michael work every time down the 
floor. But it's their second team that really beat us. Rodman, Salley and 
Edwards and those guys. We just ran out of juice." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Conference Notes 
</P>
<P>
Even if this series ends by Friday in six games, the NBA championship series 
will not begin until June 6 at 6 p.m. (PDT). The Lakers either will visit 
Detroit or play host to Chicago in Games 1 and 2. . . . Bill Laimbeer's hand 
injury is not serious, and he should be able to start Wednesday.

MIKE SCHMIDT DECIDES TO QUIT; 
</P>
<P>
UNHAPPY WITH HIS PLAY, HE BIDS AN EMOTIONAL FAREWELL

<P>
In a emotional announcement punctuated by frequent pauses and finally ending in 
uncontrollable sobbing, eight-time National League home run champion Mike 
Schmidt announced his retirement from baseball Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt, reading from a three-page handwritten statement, said he had become 
convinced his skills had deteriorated to the point that it was time to end his 
17-year major league career, all with the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years I've set high standards for myself as a player," Schmidt said. 
"I've always said that when I don't feel I can perform up to those standards it 
would be time to retire. My skills to do the things on the field, to make the 
adjustments needed to hit, to make the routine plays on defense and to run the 
bases aggressively have deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I could easily ask the Phillies to make me a part-time player, to 
hang around for a couple of years to add to my statistical totals. However, my 
respect for the game, my teammates and the fans won't allow me to do that. For 
that reason, I have decided to retire as an active player." 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt, 39, made the announcement at a hastily called news conference at San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium before a scheduled game between the Phillies and San 
Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something I have been mulling over for about a week," Schmidt said. 
"It's been a week, maybe a little bit longer that I felt a deterioration of my 
skills. I prayed about it, thought about it, talked to my family and my 
advisers about it. I gave it a period of time to turn around. On the field, I 
looked for signs. Every night, I looked for reasons to continue as an active 
player, and they weren't there." 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the announcement caught many of the Phillies off guard. Team 
president Bill Giles said that he had hoped the news could be held long enough 
for Schmidt to play a farewell game in Philadelphia, but once word leaked out, 
that was impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to him a little bit (Sunday) after the game," said third base coach 
Larry Bowa, who played with Schmidt for parts of 10 seasons, "and he said, 
'That's it.' I said, 'What do you mean that's it?' 
</P>
<P>
" 'I can't play up to my standards, and that's it.' He said, 'Don't try to talk 
me out of it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt told Phillie Manager Nick Leyva of his decision Sunday night as the 
team traveled to San Diego after a game in San Francisco. The players were 
informed of the decision in a meeting Sunday night in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The news conference was held in a dimly lit locker room, now used by San Diego 
Charger rookies. Schmidt's teammates and coaches had all gathered around the 
room by the time Schmidt, dressed smartly in a blue blazer with a red 
handkerchief stepped nervously to the rostrum. 
</P>
<P>
He pulled out his statement and began reading, but it some became clear that 
Schmidt would have trouble finishing. 
</P>
<P>
He stopped several times to compose himself, but he could not hold back the 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
"I only cry at funerals and weddings, and this isn't either," he said, trying 
to break the tension. "I figured I would (cry), but I didn't know it would that 
bad. It makes it tough to do something like this when your teammates are 
around." 
</P>
<P>
Standing nearby was Chris James, who took over for Schmidt at third base Monday 
night. He, too, had tears in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me, this is the beginning of a new era for me," James said later, his 
eyes still teary. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt, who underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder in the 
off-season, started the season well, hitting .261 with five home runs and 21 
RBIs in April. But a series of nagging injuries that have bothered him for much 
of the past few seasons finally caught up to him. 
</P>
<P>
He slumped in May, batting .117 (seven for 60) with seven RBIs, and he had not 
hit a home run since May 2. For the season, he was batting .203 with six home 
runs and 28 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt broke in with the Phillies on Sept. 16, 1972, and wasted no time 
establishing his reputation as a slugger. He hit a home run in his first game 
-- against Montreal's Balor Moore -- and went on to hit 548, more than any 
third baseman in history and seventh on the all-time list.

NBA PLAYOFFS;

<P>
TIME TO KICK BACK? NOT FOR LAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In a congested corner of the visitors' locker room in Phoenix on Sunday, 
somewhat ignored by other celebrants of the Lakers' Western Conference finals 
sweep of the Suns, Coach Pat Riley grabbed Magic Johnson by the neck and 
planted a kiss that landed somewhere near his collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, however, has vowed not to be so affectionate when the Lakers, 11-0 in 
the playoffs, resume working out this week while awaiting their opponent in the 
National Basketball Assn. championship series. 
</P>
<P>
Fearful that the Lakers will lose something with a layoff that will extend 
until at least next Tuesday, Riley said he has planned long practices, possibly 
a simulated game and, if necessary, a trip to Santa Barbara later in the week 
for what Riley called a mini-training camp. 
</P>
<P>
Some reward for sweeping three playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
"They are going to wish they got beat (in Game 4)," Riley quipped after 
Sunday's victory over the Suns. "They will wish that they extended this series 
longer to avoid what I've got planned." 
</P>
<P>
Riley does not want a week's inactivity to erode the Lakers' intensity. 
</P>
<P>
"Workouts have to be as intense as ever," Riley said. "We can learn from 
Detroit. They went into (the Eastern Conference finals) after a long layoff, 
and (Coach Chuck) Daly said they weren't as strong in that first game." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, however, are adept at playing the waiting game. They endured 
extended breaks after both the Portland and Seattle series, but this will be 
their longest layoff of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
And the Lakers aren't looking forward to it. 
</P>
<P>
Said Michael Cooper: "It will be pure hell." 
</P>
<P>
Said Mychal Thompson: "You know Riley's already rubbing his hands devising 
tortures for us. I tell you, it's like punishment for winning in four." 
</P>
<P>
And from Johnson: "We're going to go into hibernation and (Riley) will work us 
twice a day to get us ready. But you know me, I want to play tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
For now, the Lakers are merely interested observers in the Chicago-Detroit 
series. 
</P>
<P>
However, should they play the Bulls in the finals, they would have the 
home-court advantage because they finished the regular season with a better 
record than Chicago. If the Pistons were to advance for a rematch in the 
finals, the Lakers would have to make two trips to Detroit under the 2-3-2 
format. 
</P>
<P>
Said Riley: "I would say only that I would prefer Chicago because it gives us 
the home-court advantage. It's not as if we feel we can beat them easier." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to compare the Pistons and Bulls, Riley said: "Detroit's got the defense 
and the matchups. They match up against us maybe better in key positions than 
anyone in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"Chicago has enthusiasm, a sense of destiny and Michael Jordan." 
</P>
<P>
When he accepted the NBA's most valuable player award in Los Angeles last week, 
Johnson talked with excitement about a possible meeting with Jordan in the 
finals. After Sunday's game, however, he hedged. After all, two of his closest 
friends, Isiah Thomas and Mark Aguirre, play for the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter who we play as long as we're there," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Thompson: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a basketball fan, and I'd like to see Michael Jordan play in the finals. I 
told Magic that, if (the Bulls) made it, we'd all go home and let him and 
Michael go one-on-one. Play to 21. Make it, take it. 
</P>
<P>
"But we still respect Detroit, and we'd like to see them in a rematch from last 
year, too." 
</P>
<P>
Either Byron Scott or James Worthy probably would have to guard Jordan, with 
relief off the bench from Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't going to think about it right now," Scott said. "I'm not surprised 
(by the Bulls) at all, not with Michael there. They are a very different team 
than they were in the season. But we just want to go home and relax a while." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers might be home, but Riley will make sure that they won't relax. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
James Worthy continued his strong playoff performance in the Phoenix series. 
Worthy led the Lakers in scoring in the four games with a 25-point average. In 
11 playoff games, Worthy has averaged 24.6 points and made 60.3% of his shots. 
. . . With his 35-point effort in Game 4, Byron Scott finished the Phoenix 
series with a 24.8 average. Scott made 57.8% of his shots against the Suns. . . 
. A.C. Green led the Lakers in rebounding with an 8.8 average, followed by 
Worthy (8.3). . . . 
</P>
<P>
All Magic Johnson did in the Western Conference finals was average 20.3 points, 
14.5 assists and 6.8 rebounds. . . . Johnson broke the playoff record for most 
assists (57) in a four-game series. The record of 51 was reached by Bob Cousy 
(against Minneapolis in 1959), Walt Frazier (against Baltimore in 1969) and 
Phoenix's Kevin Johnson (against Golden State in the Western Conference 
semifinals). . . . In case you're wondering, no NBA team has gone undefeated 
throughout the playoffs. The 1983 Philadelphia 76ers have the best playoff 
record at 12-1.

AWE INSPIRING WINS JERSEY DERBY, EARNS A SHOT AT SUNDAY SILENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Awe Inspiring earned a start in the Belmont Stakes and another shot at Sunday 
Silence by winning the $500,000 Jersey Derby by 3 1/4 lengths Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll certainly be there if he is right for it, and I hope he will be," owner 
Ogden Mills Phipps said after Awe Inspiring covered the 1 1/4 miles at Garden 
State in 2 minutes 3 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Phipps said he would discuss Awe Inspiring's status with trainer Shug McGaughey 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Awe Inspiring finished third in the Kentucky Derby, a little more than 2 1/2 
lengths behind winner Sunday Silence and only a head behind stablemate Easy 
Goer. 
</P>
<P>
Awe Inspiring ran fourth as Halo Hansom and A.M. Swinger took the field through 
the opening six furlongs in 1:11 1/5. Craig Perret started moving Awe Inspiring 
on the backstretch, drawing even with leaders Faultless Ensign and Halo Hansom 
with a four-wide move on the stretch turn and then drew away at the eighth 
pole. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the fifth in seven starts this year for Awe Inspiring and 
earned $300,000 for Phipps. The colt paid $2.60, $2.40 and $2.10. Halo Hansom 
paid $12.20 and $2.10 and Faultless Ensign returned $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
Proper Reality, staying on the rail through the stretch, won the $589,000 
Metropolitan Mile in a three-horse photo finish at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
Proper Reality held off the favored entry of Seeking the Gold and Dancing Spree 
to win $353,400. Seeking the Gold finished a nose behind Proper Reality and a 
nose ahead of Dancing Spree. 
</P>
<P>
Proper Reality covered the mile on the fast track in 1:34 and returned $10.80, 
$3.80 and $3.40. Seeking the Gold, owned by Phipps, paid $2.40 and $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a nice horse, a good sprinter," said Robert Holthus, trainer of Proper 
Reality. "He ran into a little traffic at the head of the stretch, but when he 
finally did get through, he just came right on." 
</P>
<P>
Holthus said Proper Reality, who finished second in his last start at the 
Pimlico Special, will leave Tuesday to run in the Hawthorne Gold Cup.

<P>
METS' WOES CONTINUE WITH 3-2 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manager Davey Johnson of the New York Mets learned he might need back surgery 
and could be out several weeks when his team is struggling. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson learned Sunday, according to Newsday, that he has two ruptured disks in 
his back. He will find out this week if surgery is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets also are having problems on a trip to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Since Johnson became manager in 1984, the Mets have been successful in 
California. Often they have used the trips to send them winging to the pennant 
in the National League East. 
</P>
<P>
With their 3-2 loss Monday to the Giants at San Francisco, the Mets fell to 2-5 
on the trip, assuring them their first losing trip to the West Coast since 
Johnson took over. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he had surgery on two disks in 1979 and was not sidelined too 
long. He said the back has bothered him most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets' play has bothered him, too. Before the season, Johnson and his 
players predicted the team would breeze to the pennant. The Mets' power-packed 
lineup has failed to produce and the team is 24-23. 
</P>
<P>
An unusual hit by pitcher Don Robinson (3-4) was a key to Monday's loss. 
Robinson came up in the sixth with two on and one out in a 1-1 tie. Robinson, a 
good hitting pitcher, hit a chopper in front of the plate that bounced 50-feet 
high and came to rest a foot inside the foul line, 20 feet from home. Brett 
Butler then hit the first of two sacrifice flies. Earlier, Butler walked and 
scored the first Giant run on Will Clark's bloop double. 
</P>
<P>
"Not much of anything is going right for us except pitching," Johnson said. 
"And we're wasting that." 
</P>
<P>
The Mets' unearned run in the ninth left them one short, a trend on their 
western swing. All five losses in California have been by a run. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 12, Cincinnati 3 -- A day off did wonders for the slumps of the 
Pirates' Barry Bonds and Bobby Bonilla. 
</P>
<P>
Before taking Sunday off at Pittsburgh, Bonds was one for 25 and Bonilla was 
one for 16. They snapped their skids at the expense of the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds was two for three with a home run and four runs batted in, and Bonilla 
was three for five with a home run and double. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Jim Leyland was criticized for resting Andy Van Slyke as well as Bonds 
and Bonilla. But the 14-hit attack ended a three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 2, Chicago 1 -- Derek Lilliquist is too young and inexperienced to be 
concerned about the Cubs' success against left-handers. Chicago had beaten the 
last eight left-handers it faced. 
</P>
<P>
The rookie left-hander from Georgia held the Cubs to a run and seven hits in 
seven innings at Atlanta to even his record at 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
The run Lilliquist gave up in the seventh after Darrin Jackson led off with a 
double, was his first earned run in 22 innings. 
</P>
<P>
The light-hitting Braves didn't make it easy for Lilliquist. They had only 
three hits off Scott Sanderson, all in the fourth inning to score two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 3, St. Louis 2 -- The Astros are different from most clubs. They 
struggle at home, but are just about unbeatable on the road. 
</P>
<P>
They won this one although rookie Ken Hill held them hitless until the seventh. 
The Astros, who have won eight in a row away from the Astrodome, already had a 
run on an error by first baseman Pedro Guerrero. 
</P>
<P>
Hill has been a victim of nonsupport. In his four losses, the Cardinals have 
scored four runs. The first hit he gave up in this one was an infield hit by 
Terry Puhl. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Knepper improved his record to 3-6 with a strong seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 1, Philadelphia 0 -- Bruce Hurst and Mark Davis combined on a 
four-hitter as the Padres beat the Phillies in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst, a left-hander, allowed four hits and struck out six in 8 2/3 innings to 
improve his record to 5-3. It was Philadelphia's sixth straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Jordan singled and Von Hayes walked with two outs in the ninth and Mark 
Davis came on to retire Chris James on a grounder to third for his 16th save in 
as many opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst's previous best outing with San Diego was a one-hitter on April 10 
against visiting Atlanta. But in that game, his first victory, he allowed a 
two-run homer to Lonnie Smith. DAN HAFNER

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
ALEXANDER DELIVERS AGAIN AS TIGERS WIN, 4-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a career that began with the Dodgers way back in 1971, Doyle Alexander has 
had his ups and downs. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander, who will be 39 in September, has pitched for eight different major 
league teams, and has won 17 games three different times. 
</P>
<P>
But he may now be pitching as well as he ever has. 
</P>
<P>
Although he only improved his record to 4-4 by holding the White Sox to three 
hits in seven innings in the Detroit Tigers' 4-2 victory Monday at Chicago, 
Alexander has been outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
This was the big right-hander's 11th start. He has had only one bad outing, 
against the heavy-hitting Angels when he was hammered out in the fourth inning 
May 8. 
</P>
<P>
In all the others except the start on May 19, he pitched at least seven innings 
in each and never gave up more than three runs. On May 19, Alexander had a 
two-hit shutout until he was hit in the face by a line drive in the sixth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander suffered a hairline fracture of the jaw, but he hasn't missed a turn 
and has given up only one run in 14 innings since the injury. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to come out after seven today," Alexander said. "My lower back stiffened 
because in the last two games, I was pitching more straight up than I normally 
do. 
</P>
<P>
"Up to this point this season, I've probably pitched as well as I ever have 
before. Except for the one poor start I've pitched pretty doggone well." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander impressed Chicago Manager Jeff Torborg for one. 
</P>
<P>
"He was outstanding," Torborg said. "He obviously didn't have his best stuff 
today. He finessed his way through and got a lot of outs with his fastball. If 
he makes a mistake, it's with his fastball." 
</P>
<P>
The Tiger offense was confined to a grand slam by Matt Nokes in the fourth 
inning with two out. He hit the third of his career to make a loser of Eric 
King (4-4). 
</P>
<P>
After Alexander said he was too weary to continue, Mike Henneman took over. 
Guillermo Hernandez had to get the final out. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 6, Texas 1 -- The upstart Orioles have no respect for their elders. 
They treated Nolan Ryan, 42, in a most shabby manner at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Tettleton, Larry Sheets and Cal Ripken hit home runs off Ryan (5-3) and 
enabled Brian Holton to get his first victory as a starter in his sixth 
attempt. The former Dodger gave up no runs on five hits in 5 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Ripken's home run, just his third on the season, was his first in 40 games. It 
is the longest he went without a home run in his career. 
</P>
<P>
Although he had his home run ball working, Ryan struck out 10 in six innings. 
He gave up only two other hits besides the home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 5, Toronto 3 -- Jerry Browne is becoming the Indians' most consistent 
clutch hitter, but he still finds a run batted in something special. 
</P>
<P>
Browne had three hits and drove in two runs in this victory at Cleveland. 
Although he's batted in the No. 2 spot most of the season, Browne has driven in 
22 runs. 
</P>
<P>
He's wasted few opportunities. His .405 batting average with runners in scoring 
position is best on the team. He has hit safely in 13 of his last 14 games and 
has raised his average to .273. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm no big RBI guy," the second baseman said. "It just happens that this year 
I've come up often with men in scoring position." 
</P>
<P>
Browne's hitting helped Tom Candiotti, who gave up two earned runs in seven 
innings, improve his record to 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Flanagan (3-5) of the Blue Jays left after two innings because of a sore 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
New York 6, Seattle 3 -- Just a couple of weeks ago, it seemed Richard Dotson 
was in more danger of being dropped by the Yankees than Tommy John. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, though, Dotson is beginning to resemble the guy who won 22 games for 
the White Sox in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Dotson (2-2) beat the Mariners for the first time in five years in this game at 
New York. He gave up nine hits in 6 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees made it easy for Dotson by scoring five times in the first four 
innings off Dennis Powell. Powell, normally a reliever, was a late replacement 
for Erik Hanson, who had a stiff shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Dotson didn't learn about the pending release of John until after the game. "I 
think he could still pitch," Dotson said. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 3, Oakland 2 -- Marty Barrett celebrated the signing of a new contract 
by delivering a game-winning single in the 10th inning at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett signed an extension through the 1991 season with an option for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
With one out and Randy Kutcher on second, Barrett rapped a single to beat Bob 
Welch (6-4). 
</P>
<P>
The absence of bullpen ace Dennis Eckersley with a shoulder problem has forced 
Oakland Manager Tony LaRussa to change some plans. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, Welch, who gave up only five hits in nine innings, would not have 
gone out to pitch the 10th. Eckersley would have. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 7, Minnesota 1 -- Bo Jackson doubled and tripled to lead the 
Royals' assault on Frank Viola at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals pounded the Cy Young Award winner for seven runs and 12 hits in just 
five innings. Viola's record fell to 3-7 and his earned-run average soared to 
4.63. After a rocky start this season, Viola had won three of his previous four 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, stretching his hitting streak to nine games, doubled home two runs in 
the third and from then on Viola was no mystery. 
</P>
<P>
Bret Saberhagen held the Twins to five hits in five innings, but had to leave 
because of stiffness in his right shoulder. DAN HAFNER

CS LONG BEACH TAKES WEST I TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
On the first chance it had, Cal State Long Beach clinched a berth in the 
College World Series, defeating Arizona, 10-3, Monday for the West I Regional 
baseball championship at Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach (50-13) won all four of its games in the tournament, including two 
over the regional host Wildcats. If the 49ers had lost Monday's first game, 
they would have played Arizona one more time to determine the champion. The 
College World Series begins Friday in Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman right-hander Andy Croghan (12-0) scattered eight hits and allowed just 
one run through eight innings as Long Beach built a 10-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Deryk Hudson drove in four runs with a two-run double, a sacrifice fly and a 
grounder, and Perry Sanchez went four for four with two RBIs to lead Long 
Beach's 16-hit attack. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Erickson (18-3) was the loser for Arizona, which finishes the season 
45-18-1. 
</P>
<P>
Wichita State 3-9, Michigan 2-5 -- The Shockers had to win twice and did to 
take the West II Regional title at Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game, Wichita State (63-15) hung on after taking a 6-0 lead in 
the fourth inning. P.J. Forbes belted his 13th triple of the year, and Bryant 
Winslow, who hit his 11th double. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan, which finished 49-16, had pitching problems as starter Kirt Ojala 
(3-2) threw four wild pitches, gave up seven hits and five runs. Jason Pfaff 
relieved Ojala in the fourth and also threw a wild pitch to allow a Wichita 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Giaudrone (5-1) gave up all five runs on four hits and pitched into the 
sixth to earned the victory for Wichita. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan (49-16) scored four in the sixth inning to make it 8-5. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 9, New Orleans 3 -- The Longhorns scored four runs in the first inning 
and that was enough for starter Kirk Dressendorfer, who struck out 11, en route 
to the victory at Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
By winning the Midwest Regional title, Texas (51-17) earned its 25th trip to 
the College World Series. Dressendorfer, a sophomore whose record improve to 
16-2, took a perfect game into the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas 6, LeMoyne 5 -- Troy Eklund hit a grand slam in the seventh inning to 
give the Razorbacks their second victory of the day, clinching Northeast 
Regional title at Waterbury, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Eklund also had a run-scoring single before his home run gave Arkansas a 6-2 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
LeMoyne battled back with three runs in the eighth and had the tying run on 
second base, but Arkansas reliever Phil Stidham ended the inning. LeMoyne also 
had the potential tying run on second base in the ninth with two outs, but 
Stidham got Pete Stoyan to bounce out. The save was Stidham's 13th of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
In Arkansas' first game, Stidham gained his 12th save when the Razorbacks 
eliminated Arizona State, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State finished 42-19. Arkansas is 50-14.

LINCOLN S&amp;L OWNER SPENT LAVISHLY TO GAIN POLITICAL INFLUENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI and CLAUDIA LUTHER, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles H. Keating Jr. doesn't flinch when asked if his financial support of 
politicians is intended to influence them to take up his cause. "I want to say 
in the most forceful way I can, I certainly hope so," Keating recently 
proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
Keating practices what he preaches. A review of campaign records by The Times 
shows that Keating, his companies and a circle of about 75 family members, 
associates and employees have showered more than $700,000 in campaign 
contributions on three dozen federal and state politicians over the last six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's contributions have come under increased scrutiny since his company, 
American Continental Corp. of Phoenix, filed for protection from creditors in 
U.S. Bankruptcy Court on April 13 and Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, its principal 
subsidiary, was seized by federal regulators the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Critics charge that Keating and associates have coordinated their contributions 
in a deliberate effort to buy influence with powerful politicians. As evidence, 
they cite donations of about $300,000 to five U.S. senators who went to bat in 
April, 1987, for Keating in two unusual private meetings with savings and loan 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Concerned' About Seizure 
</P>
<P>
And one of those senators, Democrat Alan Cranston of California, said Friday 
that he intervened again a month ago by urging federal regulators to allow 
Keating to sell his embattled S&amp;L to a group headed by former Republican 
Rep. John Rousselot of San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said he was concerned that the seizure would adversely affect the 
Arizona economy and hurt American Continental bondholders, most of whom are 
Californians. He and the other senators denied that Keating's contributions 
influenced their actions on behalf of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
But others are not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"It's absolutely clear to me that Mr. Keating and his cohorts had lots of help 
from the highest quarters, both financially and politically," said Joseph W. 
Cotchett Jr., an attorney representing American Continental bondholders who may 
have lost $200 million as a result of the bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't show any favorites when it came to political parties," Cotchett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the recipients of Keating's largess have been in positions to help him 
in his business affairs and his escalating encounters with savings and loan 
regulators. And Keating is certainly in need of help these days. 
</P>
<P>
As chairman of American Continental, a Phoenix real estate development firm, he 
acquired Lincoln, which is based in Irvine, in early 1984 and began 
transforming it from a traditional thrift into a more freewheeling S&amp;L. 
Keating supplemented Lincoln's traditional home loans with investments in 
high-yield securities and riskier real estate ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators, outraged by losses at similar S&amp;Ls across the country, 
spent much of the last three years poring over the books of Lincoln and 
American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
On April 13, apparently sensing an imminent showdown, American Continental 
filed its bankruptcy petition. The next day, federal regulators seized Lincoln, 
claiming that Keating and American Continental were operating the S&amp;L in an 
unsafe and unsound manner. 
</P>
<P>
The recipients of contributions from Keating's circle include liberal Democrats 
like Cranston and former presidential hopeful Walter Mondale. But most of the 
money went to the Republican Party and GOP stalwarts like Sen. Orrin Hatch of 
Utah, who shares Keating's brand of staunch conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
For Keating, campaign contributions are one way that the American political 
system is made more responsive to its constituents. It is practiced by 
executives at major corporations across the land. It is something he has been 
doing since the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outspoken Critic 
</P>
<P>
In 1957, Keating plodded through the halls of Congress in search of allies in 
the war on pornography, a personal political crusade that he still pursues. In 
1980, he briefly ran the 1980 presidential campaign of former Texas Gov. John 
B. Connally. Connally's son, Mark, now is American Continental's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Keating contends that his contributions merely give him a fighting 
chance against hostile regulators who drove American Continental into 
bankruptcy proceedings because they didn't like his unconventional business 
strategies and his outspoken criticism of the regulatory structure. Elected 
officials, he has claimed, ought to come to his aid when the government 
bureaucracy runs amok with its regulatory authority. 
</P>
<P>
"We support and campaign for the political leaders we believe will represent 
the best of American virtues," he told reporters last month. "In the contract 
between the voter and the politician, we have the right to seek their help when 
needed and demand it when justified. This I have done." 
</P>
<P>
And he has done it in a big way, with the help of his firms, family members, 
business associates and employees. In the last five years, state and federal 
campaign records show: 
</P>
<P>
* More than $100,000 has gone to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and more than 
$55,000 to Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), both of Keating's home state. 
Congressmen from Arizona also have fared well, including Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), who 
has received $20,950 while representing the district Keating lives in. 
</P>
<P>
* More than $52,000 has gone to the two California senators -- Cranston and 
Republican Pete Wilson -- who represent Lincoln's home base. Sen. John Glenn 
(D-Ohio) has picked up $34,500 from Keating's circle. Keating was born in Ohio, 
and American Continental is incorporated there. 
</P>
<P>
* Nearly $166,000 has gone to 11 members of the Senate and House banking 
committees, where deregulation of the savings and loan industry was conceived 
and implemented in recent years, much to the dismay of some regulators. The 
largest amount, more than $70,000, was given to the Senate panel's current 
chairman, Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.). Other members who received donations 
are Cranston, who got $39,100; Jacob (Chic) Hecht (R-Nev.), $19,000; Timothy E. 
Wirth (D-Colo.), $8,000; William L. Armstrong (R-Colo.), $7,000; Phil Gramm 
(R-Texas), $1,000, and Jacob Garn (R-Utah), $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
House committee members were Reps. Doug Barnard Jr. (D-Ga.), $16,000; Frank 
Annunzio (D-Ill.), $1,000; Stephen L. Neal (D-N.C.), $1,000, and Fernand J. St 
Germain (D-R.I.), $500. 
</P>
<P>
* At the California Statehouse, where gubernatorial appointees oversee Lincoln 
operations, Keating money has added $41,000 to Gov. George Deukmejian's 
campaign coffers in the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
* Keating and associates pumped $80,000 into the California Republican Party 
last fall alone. Altogether, he has given the state GOP $97,500 in the last 
four years and has given $3,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee. Such "soft" donations allow contributors to get around federal 
individual contribution limits of $1,000 per candidate per election. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last five years, there's no question that it has been important that we 
help those who supported the business areas we were in," Keating said in an 
interview last week. "I've always contributed across a broad spectrum of 
philosophical and political boundaries. But from my background, to do business 
(throughout) America, you need to be politically aware." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doesn't Recall Mondale Gift 
</P>
<P>
With so much money flowing to so many candidates over so many years, Keating 
apparently cannot keep track of the politicians who benefited from his 
fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
He does not recall -- and acted surprised when reminded -- that he and his 
family gave $2,500 to Mondale's 1984 presidential campaign. Mondale "definitely 
has diverse views from me," said Keating, a conservative Republican. He said he 
probably responded to someone raising money for Mondale's campaign in the hope 
that he could solicit that person later for funds for one of his own favored 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, Keating made no direct contributions in 1984 to one candidate 
who seemed to embody his conservative politics: President Ronald Reagan. 
Likewise, four years later, Keating did not contribute to President George 
Bush's campaign, although American Continental gave $80,000 to the California 
Republican Party. This money, which does not come under federal or state 
contribution limitations, was used for voter-registration and get-out-the-vote 
efforts that benefited Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Keating has never been bashful about his political persuasion. And he has not 
hesitated to encourage employees to contribute to candidates who support 
deregulation of financial services, the bulwark upon which his business empire 
is built. 
</P>
<P>
One former executive of an American Continental subsidiary who requested 
anonymity said he made his only political donation ever -- $500 -- in 1987 
because he was made aware by Keating that Sen. Riegle was "in line 
philosophically with the business we were running." Riegle also was second in 
line at the time to take over as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, 
which he now heads. 
</P>
<P>
Keating frequently invited employees into the company's dining room to hear 
various politicians, said Deborah Karbo, a former vice president of another 
company subsidiary. After Riegle stopped by for a quick visit in March, 1987, 
she contributed $500 to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Pressure 
</P>
<P>
Both former employees said their gift-giving was "entirely discretionary," as 
Karbo put it. The other former executive said there was "never any pressure" to 
contribute. 
</P>
<P>
Keating said he "never put the arm" on anyone to make contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Although the donors may have reached independent decisions, they tended to 
reach them at the same time. For example, 51 donations from Keating, family 
members and associates were made to McCain on the same day: March 17, 1986. And 
a March 23, 1987, fund-raiser for Riegle netted 86 checks from Keating's 
circle. More than a third of those checks were executed on one day, March 12, 
and all but two of the rest were written on one of two other days that month. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Zelman, executive director of California Common Cause, said it isn't 
uncommon to see a large number of executives at a major firm contributing to a 
number of politicians. 
</P>
<P>
But, Zelman noted, "when the numbers get real large, there's a question of 
whether individuals are coerced or even encouraged to contribute." He said that 
encouraging contributions "gets borderline illegal really fast." 
</P>
<P>
Keating lashed out at those who would criticize him for legitimate fund-raising 
activities, saying the public is being "bullied into not contributing" to 
political campaigns by people who question every donation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Timing of Contributions 
</P>
<P>
In his case, he said, regulators are raising the campaign contribution issue to 
hold senators and congressmen in check while the federal agencies deal with 
Lincoln Savings. 
</P>
<P>
But critics contend that Keating has simply used donated dollars to get 
politicians to do his bidding. And the timing of the contributions raises 
questions about his motives. 
</P>
<P>
Riegle and Keating, for instance, met in Detroit on March 1, 1986, when Riegle 
attended the reopening of the renovated Pontchartrain Hotel, which Lincoln 
owned. A fund-raiser on March 23, 1987, netted Riegle more than $70,000, which 
Riegle returned a year later after Keating's contributions became a public 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Riegle was one of five senators who met with regulators on April 9, 1987, to 
find out why a routine examination of Lincoln's financial condition was taking 
more than a year instead of the normal two to three months. Riegle's closest 
aide, Kevin Gottlieb, said the senator attended only at the written request of 
two colleagues, DeConcini and McCain. Cranston and Glenn also were at that 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Never before, top regulators say, had they seen an S&amp;L owner who had enough 
political pull to get five U.S. senators to meet with federal examiners about a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
At an earlier meeting, Cranston, McCain, DeConcini and Glenn had met with Edwin 
J. Gray, head of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Gray later claimed that the 
four senators tried to cut a deal for Keating. He termed the effort a "gross 
violation of the integrity of the regulatory process . . . for the benefit of 
one person who happened to be a friend and contributor." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deny Impropriety 
</P>
<P>
The senators or their aides denied that any deal was offered or discussed. 
Glenn said he met only to find out why a constituent was having a problem with 
an unusually long regulatory examination. DeConcini's press secretary, Bob 
Maynes, said Gray "has a terrible memory or he's a liar." 
</P>
<P>
All of the senators involved said there was no impropriety in taking money from 
Keating and his fund-raisers and then representing him in a dispute with agency 
officials, something they said they do for all their constituents. Gottlieb 
said Riegle returned the money in March, 1988, only because local papers had 
written about it and the senator did not want it to become a campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
An individual "does not suddenly become ineligible for any kind of constituent 
help because he's made a political contribution," Maynes said. 
</P>
<P>
In an Orange County Superior Court lawsuit, however, bondholders who purchased 
$200 million in apparently worthless American Continental debt securities claim 
Keating used his political connections to cover up an alleged fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Keating used politicians -- as well as former government 
employees he hired or retained -- to keep regulators at bay while he continued 
to sell junk bonds to unsophisticated depositors. 
</P>
<P>
Keating vehemently denies the claims in the suit, one of several class actions 
filed in Southern California and Arizona. He said the bondholders' only chance 
at getting any money back is if control of Lincoln is returned to him. 
Regulators have never saved an institution they have seized, he said.

BRUCE HOROVITZ / MARKETING: HOT SHOPS; 
</P>
<P>
WITH 250 AD AGENCIES IN THE L.A. AREA, GETTING STARTED IS TOUGH. OF NEWER 
FIRMS, JUST A FEW ARE MAKING A SPLASH. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The room got strangely quiet. At most advertising agencies, that is usually a 
sign that a client had been lost. 
</P>
<P>
But that was hardly the case at the tiny ad firm Stein Robaire Helm. The Los 
Angeles agency was just weeks old and operating out of a converted apartment 
with a kitchen that doubled as a conference room. 
</P>
<P>
On the kitchen table, Jean Robaire and John Stein had just completed an 
advertisement for their first client, a wheelchair maker. The unusual ad -- 
which has since appeared in several specialty magazines -- has text that winds 
around everyday obstacles to show the sort of barriers people in wheelchairs 
face each day. As the two creators stared at the ad, Greg Helm, the agency's 
president, walked into the room. "The guys turned to me and asked who to show 
the ad to for approval," Helm recalled. "We all realized, there was no one." 
</P>
<P>
After years of reporting to the top brass at the giant Los Angeles advertising 
agency Chiat/Day, these three ad men are just getting accustomed to reporting 
to themselves. They broke off from Chiat/Day nearly a year ago and decided to 
test the Los Angeles ad market on their own. Already, many in the advertising 
industry recognize them as one of Southern California's few "hot" ad shops. 
</P>
<P>
To say the least, that is an elite status. The Los Angeles area has more than 
250 advertising agencies, but in recent years only a sprinkling of new ad firms 
have created many ripples -- let alone waves. Some say the fierce competition 
for business here has somehow stifled creativity and discouraged some of the 
most creative ad folks from starting their own agencies. But several newer 
agencies, such as Stein Robaire Helm, are beginning to turn some heads. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's wheelchair ad, for example, helped push sales out of the doldrums. 
On one particular line, "we've quadrupled the base of our business since the ad 
ran three months ago." said Robert Ladendecker, manager of marketing services 
at Everest &amp; Jennings, the Camarillo-based wheelchair maker. 
</P>
<P>
But it takes more than one good wheelchair ad for an agency to leap out of the 
pack in the competitive Los Angeles ad market. It can be especially difficult 
for the newer and smaller ad firms, whose clients have relatively small 
advertising budgets -- often less than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some advertising experts say they are bewildered by the 
apparent dearth of talented young ad firms in the Los Angeles market. 
</P>
<P>
"For all of its spunk, vigor and life on the creative edge, Los Angeles has 
never been a great creative town for advertising," said Hal Riney, president of 
the San Francisco ad firm Hal Riney &amp; Partners, which created the original 
Bartles &amp; Jaymes ads. "You'd think there'd be great creative boutiques 
opening up all the time here," Riney said. "Maybe everyone's home writing movie 
scripts." 
</P>
<P>
Well, not quite everyone. At least a handful of young Southern California ad 
agencies are raising industry eyebrows. And for prices often far less than 
big-name firms, they can sometimes deliver fresh advertising. Although no one 
can definitively say which are hot -- and which are not -- several young ad 
firms were mentioned repeatedly in interviews with top Los Angeles advertising 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Stein Robaire Helm -- which also creates ads for Foster Farms 
Restaurants -- executives point to two other Los Angeles ad firms and one 
Orange County agency as hotbeds of talent. In Los Angeles, the year-old Shalek 
Agency, which creates ads for Ocean Pacific Sunwear, and Suissa &amp; 
Associates, which devised those pun-filled slogans for Marie Callender 
billboards, are viewed as two young agencies to watch. And in Irvine, the ad 
agency deYong Ginsberg Weisman Bailey, which creates ads for the Orange County 
Transit District, is also considered a rising star among the small ad shops. 
</P>
<P>
Getting hot doesn't happen by accident. It requires a willingness to take lots 
of risks. At Chiat/Day, where salaries for talented employees can quickly edge 
into the six-figure bracket, Stein was a copywriter, Robaire was an art 
director and, as office general manager, Helm was their boss. "We pulled Greg 
aside one day and told him about our idea to start an ad agency," Stein said. 
"We knew we'd either have a partner -- or we'd get fired." 
</P>
<P>
For several weeks, the agency operated out of Helm's apartment. It has since 
moved, but even today -- nearly a year later -- much of the furniture in the 
agency's new office has been hauled in from its founders' homes. Clients know 
not to ask the guys who run the agency for goodies such as tickets to Lakers 
games. Said Helm, "We don't have any." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, not all clients expect skyboxes at the Forum. Some are satisfied 
with good advertising that doesn't cost a lot of money. "Our clients don't have 
a lot of money, and neither do we," Robaire said. The agency has six clients 
that in total will spend about $7 million in advertising over the next year. 
(At Chiat/Day, a single client could conceivably spend that much in a few 
weeks.) 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most visible risk taker among the smaller ad shops in Los Angeles 
is the Shalek Agency. "The Los Angeles ad market is at the tip of a new life 
cycle," said Nancy G. Shalek, president of the year-old agency. "The window is 
right now for upstart ad agencies to step in." 
</P>
<P>
Some say television's top-rated TV show, "Roseanne," grew out of commercials 
that the Shalek Agency created several years ago for the former Giant grocery 
chain. The satirical ads featured Roseanne Barr, who was then a nearly unknown 
comedienne. Others credit the Shalek Agency with completely changing the look 
of surf-wear advertising. Its offbeat ads for Gotcha and Ocean Pacific may say 
next to nothing about surfing, but they say plenty about surfing life styles. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean Pacific may be Shalek's wildest gamble. The giant surf-wear maker 
alienated many surfers when its clothing -- once exclusively sold in surf shops 
-- was suddenly available in department stores. Ocean Pacific's mistake, said 
Shalek, "was growing without seeking permission to be big." So now, the current 
billboard and print campaign uses bold lettering that intentionally resembles 
Russian graphics. "It's sort of a feeling of solidarity," said Shalek, "you 
know, like 'come join our cause.' " 
</P>
<P>
If there is one cause attracting advertisers to smaller ad agencies in Los 
Angeles, it is the search for advertising talent that stands out. "You can't 
try to 'out big' the big agencies," said David Suissa, president of Suissa 
Associates in Santa Monica. "You have to fess up to who you are." 
</P>
<P>
His 4-year-old ad firm, which has about $20 million in annual billings, may be 
best known for its Marie Callender campaign, which features billboards with 
pun-laden slogans such as, "Hello, Good Pie." In fact, consumers have sent 
dozens of letters suggesting food puns for future Marie Callender billboards. 
</P>
<P>
"That campaign was a gutsy thing to do," Suissa said. "We took every nickel out 
of television and put it all into billboards. But we figure we reach nearly 10 
times more people for the same money." 
</P>
<P>
But just as small ad agencies take risks, so do their clients. Take, for 
example, the Orange County Transit District. Last year, OCTD plastered posters 
on the sides of its buses that showed bus illustrations below the headline "Be 
a Coach Potato." 
</P>
<P>
The ads, created by Jim deYong, executive creative director of deYong Ginsberg 
Weisman Bailey, won several industry awards. And the campaign has since helped 
the year-old agency win plenty of new business. But it didn't win the praise of 
many bus drivers. Some riders took the "Coach Potato" ads to heart and started 
calling the bus drivers coach potatoes. Three days after the bus posters went 
up, they were quietly removed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Magazines Split Over Ad Picturing Dukakis 
</P>
<P>
Fortune magazine said no. Newsweek said yes. But no one asked Massachusetts 
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
Dukakis -- or at least an unflattering photo of him -- is featured in a 
provocative new print ad for a personal computer accessory that allows people 
to make color slides with their personal computers. Under a large photo of 
Dukakis, the headline says, "There are some people even we couldn't make more 
persuasive." 
</P>
<P>
The ad, for Presentation Technologies, was created by the year-old San 
Francisco advertising agency Mandelbaum Mooney Ashley. Fortune magazine 
rejected the ad, a Fortune spokesman said, because it was "demeaning to 
Dukakis." But it will appear next week in the California edition of Newsweek 
and Inc. magazines. 
</P>
<P>
The agency never asked Dukakis for permission to use his photo in the ad. "We 
were working under the assumption that if we asked, they'd say no," said Ken 
Mandelbaum, president of the ad firm. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not intend the ad as an attack on Dukakis," Mandelbaum added. After 
all, he said, the ad agency's creative director, Cathi Mooney, was a Dukakis 
volunteer in the San Francisco area. "She still has a 'Dukakis for President' 
bumper sticker on her BMW." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sterling Wants to Bond Itself to Car Buyers 
</P>
<P>
James Bond has driven all kinds of fancy foreign cars -- but he's never driven 
a Sterling. So what's the big idea of this British car maker, Sterling, using 
Bond's familiar musical theme in its commercials? 
</P>
<P>
"We went through extensive research and found the results remarkable when we 
put our car on the screen with that music," said Tony Cumming, director of 
marketing communications at Miami-based Sterling Motor Cars, the U.S. importer 
and distributor of the upscale car. 
</P>
<P>
In the commercial, an unseen Patrick MacNee, the star of the 1960s TV spy 
series "The Avengers," drives a Sterling around harrowing turns while the Bond 
theme plays. When he finally steps out of the car, he asks, "You were expecting 
someone else?" 
</P>
<P>
"This is how American consumers see the British," said Cumming. "People who 
retain their grace under pressure." Not only has the company purchased the 
rights to use the Bond theme song, but it has also signed a deal with MGM/UA 
Communications for a Sterling car to actually appear in a yet-to-be-written 
Bond screenplay -- tentatively scheduled for release in two years. 
</P>
<P>
But you won't see a Sterling in the newest Bond film, "License to Kill." The 
company that paid for that privilege was American -- Lincoln Continental. 
</P>
<P>
"Car companies always want to be involved in James Bond movies," said Andrea 
Hein, vice president of merchandising at MGM Pictures. "They like his life 
style." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Director of TV Spots Makes Big-Screen Film 
</P>
<P>
He may be best known for directing Pepsi's ad featuring Madonna that was 
recently yanked from the airwaves. Or perhaps for directing that Michael 
Jackson spot for Pepsi in which the singer's hair accidentally burst into 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
Soon the public will also know TV commercial director Joe Pytka as a film 
director. He just completed his first feature film, "Let It Ride," starring 
Richard Dreyfuss. The film, about a day in the life of a race track bettor, is 
scheduled to premiere Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really nervous about it yet," Pytka said. "I'm too busy working on 
it." Although the filming is mostly complete, Pytka said he is still working 
with film editors and musicians composing a score for the film. And he is also 
negotiating for a second movie contract. 
</P>
<P>
Pytka, considered one of the most highly paid commercial directors in the 
business, is also regarded as among the most high strung. Pytka said he greatly 
admires Dreyfuss' acting talents but acknowledged that there was plenty of 
tension between them on the set. "We're both Scorpios, so you can imagine the 
sparks," Pytka said. "I'd say he's a double Scorpio, but I'm a triple."

BRUSH WITH GANGSTERS PROVES AS VALUABLE AS A GREAT CHEF OR AMBIENCE

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bankers and Brokers Ristorante became one of Larry Branch's regular lunch 
spots when he discovered it had three features he cherishes in an Italian 
eatery: a creditable pasta, a solid wine list and a history entangled with the 
Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact there's a mob shooting connected with the place does sort of add 
excitement," Branch, a Wall Street currency trader, said after a recent lunch 
at the lower Manhattan restaurant. "You feel like you're in the middle of it 
all." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the 1986 attack on John O'Connor, a union official who was 
plugged in the buttocks by gunmen in a dispute over control of the restaurant. 
These days, as prosecutors try to put the accused wrongdoers behind bars, the 
restaurant is getting publicity that has drawn other customers as well. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a brush with the Mafia can be as valuable as a great chef or a unique 
ambience in New York's impossibly competitive restaurant market. In a city 
fascinated with the Cosa Nostra, almost nothing packs them in like word that 
mobsters are habitues, or better yet, that there's been a shooting on the 
premises. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Good for Business 
</P>
<P>
The top-rated Sparks Steakhouse has drawn even bigger crowds than usual since 
Gambino family boss Paul (Big Paul) Castellano was gunned down in front of its 
doors in 1985. The slaying of mob bagman Irwin (Fat Man) Schiff in 1987 helped 
business at Bravo Sergio on the Upper East Side, and some restaurateurs wonder 
if Umberto's Clam House could have even survived without the 1972 slaying of 
Joseph (Crazy Joey) Gallo that made it a must-see for Mafia mavens. 
</P>
<P>
These days, a long list of tony Manhattan restaurants seem to benefit from the 
visits of alleged top mob boss John Gotti, the "Dapper Don" whose 
peregrinations draw nearly as much attention in New York as those of real 
estate tycoon Donald J. Trump. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad but true that shootings are good for the restaurant business," said 
Tim Zagat, publisher of the Zagat Survey restaurant guides. "It's more 
publicity than a restaurant would ever get through reviews; it's worth 
millions." 
</P>
<P>
Though they may be reluctant to admit it, many of these restaurants may be 
particularly grateful for the added patronage just now, as overexpansion and 
Wall Street's slump have sent the Manhattan restaurant trade into a nose-dive. 
</P>
<P>
New Yorkers' imaginations have long been inflamed by mob rub-outs, real and 
fictional. In his "Billy Bathgate," novelist E. L. Doctorow chronicled the cafe 
killing of 1920s gangster Dutch Schultz; one of the most famous scenes in the 
film "The Godfather" is a Corleone family slaying of a corrupt police officer 
and a mob rival at an old-style Italian neighborhood restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, many people are turned off by crime and criminals, and would avoid 
restaurants that have been the site of violence. But, as Zagat points out, 
"even if 80% of the public is turned off, the 20% that's intrigued is enough to 
fill up all the seats in your restaurant for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
The Castellano murder put Sparks Steakhouse in headlines across the country for 
weeks. Allegedly directed by Gotti in his bid for control of the Gambino crime 
family, the killers met Big Paul with a fusillade of bullets as he prepared to 
step into his long black limousine. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Cella, who owns Sparks with his brother Mike, did media interviews for much 
of the following day on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant, all the while 
deploring the idea that anyone would be drawn to his restaurant by the tragedy. 
"Sparks never had many empty seats and, if anything, that (episode) made it 
more crowded," Cella said recently. 
</P>
<P>
"It had an unbelievable effect on his business," said David Liederman, owner of 
nearby Chez Louis restaurant, with unconcealed envy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Picture in Tabloids 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the crowds flocked to Bravo Sergio after a gunman in a dark suit shot 
the 400-pound Schiff in the back of the head as he sat with a blond companion 
after a meal of veal rollatini. Schiff was little known at the time, but his 
picture was plastered across the New York tabloids for weeks as they chronicled 
the life and many loves of the "Ton Juan." 
</P>
<P>
"Bravo Sergio would have dropped totally out of sight without the shooting, 
because they had no claim to great cuisine," Zagat said. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurant owner Mario Lazzinnaro, who authorities have alleged has ties to 
organized crime, did not return calls to his Brooklyn construction company 
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers and Brokers Restaurant made its way into history after the development 
of Battery Park City, the sleek new financial and residential center at the 
southern tip of Manhattan. Plans for the development hugely increased the 
property's value, and set off a battle for its control. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, connected with one rival faction, was allegedly shot on Gotti's 
orders in retaliation for vandalizing the restaurant. Prosecutors have alleged 
that the restaurant has mob ties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hasn't Hurt' Business 
</P>
<P>
In a phone interview, a woman who gave her name as Rosemarie and identified 
herself as the restaurant's manager said the shooting "definitely hasn't hurt" 
business. Then she hung up. 
</P>
<P>
A brush with the mob evidently doesn't have to be violent to benefit a 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The Second Ave. Deli, widely held to be one of the city's best Jewish 
delicatessens, has attracted wide notice as the place where both Gotti and 
Castellano bought their sandwiches and cold cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Post once carried a picture of a muscled Gotti associate carrying 
a "Second Ave. Deli" shopping bag as he trailed behind the alleged mob boss. 
</P>
<P>
"I only wish that if they had to shoot my customer, they would have done it in 
front of my place," joked Abe Lebewohl, the deli's owner. "These places like 
Umberto's Clam House become like tourist attractions." 
</P>
<P>
As Gotti's celebrity has grown (he made the cover of People magazine earlier 
this year), his visits to New York restaurants are closely followed in local 
papers. On a partial list of his favorites are: Taormina, SPQR, Caffe Biondo, 
La Camelia, Sistina, Regine's, San Domenico, and Teresa Mimmo's. 
</P>
<P>
One restaurateur, who asked not to be identified, said owners "all want some -- 
but definitely not too much" publicity from the visit of mob bigs. "You don't 
want the world to think they're the only celebrities who come by," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Diners' fascination with the mob is reflected in the Zagat New York City 
Restaurant Survey, which rates restaurants every year by soliciting the opinion 
of scores of regular restaurant-goers. 
</P>
<P>
In their rating of Sparks, the Zagat volunteers often make comments that allude 
to Castellano's demise: "a real 'mob' scene," "a 'family' restaurant," "the 
special of the day is, 'Duck!'," "ask for a bulletproof booth." 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, even the appearance of a mob connection can sometimes be enough to 
draw crowds of New Yorkers. One of Manhattan's trendiest restaurants, Rao's, is 
an old-style, storefront establishment that law enforcement sources say has no 
mob connections. 
</P>
<P>
But the restaurant stands in East Harlem on an immaculate block that is 
surrounded on all sides by burned out buildings -- suggesting to the casual 
onlooker that the area has some kind of Mafia protection. That may be one 
reason Rao's is one of the toughest places in New York to get a reservation. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if it has no mob tie whatsoever, a place like this can have the aura that 
will attract people," said Edward Giuliano, chief restaurant critic for the 
Gault Millau Best of New York travel guide. 
</P>
<P>
In Giuliano's view, diners seek out such an atmosphere because it "recalls a 
romanticized, earlier America . . . You may have heard the story of Joey 
Gallo's shooting 50 times, but you still want to go down there yourself, to see 
where it took place." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the source of the attraction, some New York restaurateurs are 
evidently grateful to the reputed mobsters for any boost their presence may 
give the establishment. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks owner Cella remembers Castellano as "a fine gentleman." Lebewohl of 
Second Ave. Deli agrees, saying moreover that he's never had a problem of any 
kind with the alleged mobsters set. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, they're nice people," Lebewohl said. "They sit, they 
eat, they pay, they leave -- and there's no screaming."

MAYTAG AND HOOVER: HEAVEN FOR HOUSEKEEPING AND APPLIANCE MAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NORTH CANTON, Ohio 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Maytag bought Hoover earlier this year, it was a homemaker's dream -- the 
marriage of two businesses that started out producing appliances to make 
housekeeping tasks easier in the early years of this century. 
</P>
<P>
The two are similar in other ways as well. 
</P>
<P>
In 1907, Frederick L. Maytag, owner for many years of a farm implement business 
in a small Iowa town, began manufacturing the Pastime, a wooden, hand-cranked 
washing machine. 
</P>
<P>
In 1908, William H. Hoover, owner for many years of a leather goods and harness 
factory in a small Ohio town, started making the Model O electric suction 
carpet sweeper. 
</P>
<P>
The Maytag washer and the Hoover vacuum cleaner soon became household words -- 
Maytag in this country, Hoover throughout the world as well. Hoover opened its 
first foreign plants in Canada in 1911 and in England in 1917. 
</P>
<P>
It was J. Murray Spangler, a cousin of Hoover's wife, Susan, who invented the 
Hoover vacuum cleaner. Spangler, a janitor who suffered from asthma, was 
troubled by dust when he swept carpets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Models for $450 
</P>
<P>
So he mounted an electric fan on a floor sweeper and twisted the fan's blades 
to create suction. He put a pillowcase around the contraption to catch the dust 
it sucked up. Spangler patented the device and sold the patent to Hoover. 
Hoover improved on the design and made Spangler the production manager of his 
new company, Electric Suction Sweeper Co. 
</P>
<P>
The first Hoover vacuum cleaner weighed 40 pounds and sold for $59. Today, the 
most expensive models sell for about $450. Hoover's newest machine -- the Elite 
300 upright -- weighs less than 12 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
According to Brian Gridlestone, Hoover North America's 42-year-old president, 
Maytag wanted Hoover "because Hoover is one of the world players in the 
appliance industry." Maytag paid Chicago Pacific Corp. $961.5 million to 
acquire the Hoover operation and five furniture companies, although it later 
said it would sell the furniture companies to pay off part of the long-term 
debt it assumed as a result of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
Maytag, with record sales of $1.9 billion last year, was looking for a company 
such as Hoover so it could become a global player, explained Daniel J. Krumm, 
62, Maytag's chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
"This is particularly important to us," he said, "because it is our first major 
step in expanding Maytag's strategy for appliance growth to overseas markets. 
Appliance companies here and abroad are actively developing ways to play on 
each other's turf. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed to position ourself . . . for the upcoming changes in the European 
market in 1992, when all trade barriers between countries in Europe are 
scheduled to be dropped, making Europe an even bigger appliance market than the 
U.S." 
</P>
<P>
Hoover, whose sales exceeded $1 billion for the first time last year, is the 
largest company in the $2.5-billion U.S. floor-care industry through its 
production of vacuum cleaners and other home products. Overseas, where 69% of 
its revenues are generated, Hoover is big not only in vacuum cleaners, but also 
in washers, dryers, refrigerators, dishwashers and microwave ovens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Microprocessors, Robotics 
</P>
<P>
Hoover has 14 manufacturing facilities in the United States and abroad with a 
total of 15,100 employees, including 3,000 at its headquarters and factory 
here. It also has factories in Scotland, Wales, Canada, Australia, France, 
Mexico, Portugal and Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover's North Canton plant has undergone a $38-million modernization during 
the past two years, with the installation of robotics and microprocessors 
throughout -- part of a $130-million improvement program that Hoover has 
conducted at its plants throughout the world during the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Maytag, based in Newton, Iowa, had 13,000 employees in 12 U.S. divisions before 
the merger on Jan. 26. The Maytag companies now are Admiral, Ardac, 
Dixie-Narco, Domicor, Heatube, Hoover, Jenn-Air, Magic-Chef, Maycor, Maytag, 
Maytag Financial Services, Norge and Warwick. 
</P>
<P>
Maytag is the nation's third-largest washing machine company -- after Whirlpool 
and General Electric. Other Maytag products include refrigerators, clothes 
dryers, kitchen ranges, soft drink vending machines and garbage disposals. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover and Maytag pride themselves on their ability to make high-quality 
products for reasonable prices, which has helped keep Japan and other foreign 
nations from getting a foothold in the highly competitive American appliance 
marketplace.

DEPOSIT GUARANTY BUILDS ON THE RUINS OF TEXAS BANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Deposit Guaranty Bank didn't exist 15 months ago. Now it has $600 million in 
assets and is a privately owned financial institution built mostly from the 
ruins of failed banks. 
</P>
<P>
Deposit Guaranty is the sole holding of TexOp Bancshares Inc., which still has 
a fund of $30 million it may use to buy additional banks -- enough capital to 
become a $1.5-billion-asset bank without additional financing. 
</P>
<P>
Given the troubles of the Texas financial community, with banks and thrifts 
failing almost weekly -- some resulting in multimillion-dollar federal bailouts 
-- Deposit Guaranty is swimming against the tide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Survival Plan 
</P>
<P>
But Chairman Ron Steinhart and President Terry Kelley figure they have a sound 
plan to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
"The mission is to build a profitable, healthy Texas banking organization and 
to take advantage of the problems, which are opportunities for somebody," 
Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some management in place in various banks that had no capital, and 
some capital was available if you could find management. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt like it was a rare opportunity if we could provide the capital and the 
management at a time when things were as they were." 
</P>
<P>
Timing was also important, he said, because he and Steinhart believed the state 
was returning to economic health. 
</P>
<P>
"Five years ago we'd never have tried it," Steinhart said, "and I don't think 
three years from now we'd try it because the opportunity would have passed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking at Larger Banks 
</P>
<P>
While the building blocks so far have generally been small, often one-branch 
institutions, Deposit Guaranty executives still toy with the idea of going 
after some large Texas banks that remain on the block. 
</P>
<P>
Steinhart, a veteran of buying and selling Texas banks, admits to continuing 
interest in Texas American Bancshares Inc., one of the largest remaining 
problem banks. 
</P>
<P>
Since it was formed Feb. 8, 1988, Deposit Guaranty has purchased 13 banks, 11 
of them in federally assisted transactions that leave it with what Kelley calls 
"sterilized assets." 
</P>
<P>
The money came from a pool of private capital raised by Goldman, Sachs &amp; 
Co. -- $8.8 million to buy the first bank and then $62 million more to finance 
other purchases. 
</P>
<P>
In its first 11 months of operation, Deposit Guaranty earned $1.27 million for 
its investors, the largest of which is the Harvard University endowment, with 
Goldman Sachs and brothers Robert and Richard Strauss as other principals, plus 
Steinhart and Kelley. 
</P>
<P>
Deposit Guaranty has the advantage of obtaining its banks without the 
encumbrances of past problems and the burdens of Texas' old banking laws, which 
until last year virtually blocked statewide banking. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Costs 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the old laws, many banks, even those owned by the same holding 
company, were operated separately within each county, leading to high 
management and real estate costs. 
</P>
<P>
"We can look at what's the most efficient way to operate a bank today and not 
be encumbered by an existing organization that may be operated in a more 
traditional basis, which may not be cost-effective and efficient in the 
future," Steinhart said. 
</P>
<P>
But more important is that all 11 of the failed banks have been purchased in 
closed bank transactions, meaning Deposit Guaranty is left with few of the 
obligations of the former bank. Even when Deposit Guaranty acquires troubled 
assets, it is protected from losses by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
"We're buying essentially with problems fully reserved, so that the large 
proportion of our people can direct their energies to building a bank and 
building a customer base," Steinhart said. 
</P>
<P>
Steinhart and Kelley see a highly competitive future in Texas banking, as 
problems are solved and the new owners -- many of which are aggressive, 
out-of-state banks -- turn their attention to the market. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially they're sorting out the good loans, the bad loans; who are the key 
people to keep and who are the key people to get rid of, those kind of things," 
Kelley said. "One of these days that'll all be history, and they'll be focused 
on the market."

AWARD COVERS SOME FUNDS LOST BY EX-U.S. TREASURER

<P>
A retired record producer who lost more than $200,000 after a former U.S. 
Treasury secretary put her retirement check in a shaky offshore bank has won 
partial restitution from a lawyers' fund, its director said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Ethel Gabriel of Pocono Pines, Pa., was awarded $100,000 from the Client's 
Security Fund to make up, at least in part, for the $251,000 she entrusted to 
Robert B. Anderson, a Treasury secretary under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 
said Frederick Miller, executive director of the state-created fund. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who also served as President Richard M. Nixon's chief negotiator on 
the Panama Canal Treaty talks, placed Gabriel's money in a British West Indies 
bank that subsequently collapsed, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pleaded Guilty 
</P>
<P>
Anderson pleaded guilty to income tax evasion in March, 1987. He was sentenced 
later that year to one month in prison and five years' probation on condition 
that he make restitution to his wronged clients, Miller said. Anderson was 
disbarred earlier this year. Owing to the fund's $100,000 cap on awards, 
Gabriel will not receive full restitution, Miller said. She is also receiving 
$100 a week from Anderson's Social Security account. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was acting as Gabriel's adviser when she asked him in 1984 to manage 
her lump-sum retirement check from RCA Records, where she had worked for 43 
years. She had hoped to use the money to finance her own recording and 
entertainment business, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson told her that he would deposit the check and promised that it would 
never leave the United States. But he put the money into the Commercial 
Exchange Bank and Trust Ltd. of Anguilla in the British West Indies, Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'He Falsified Records' 
</P>
<P>
"I gave him my money in 1984 and a year later he called me to say he lost it 
all," Gabriel said. "My money was supposed to be in a six-month time deposit 
with the Bank of America. Anderson said we were buying time to see where the 
economy was going. Meanwhile, he falsified records. He even showed me papers 
which showed my money was insured." 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors said the offshore bank where her money was placed failed to 
register with either state or federal banking authorities. It ultimately lost 
$4 million in depositors' funds.

U.S.-INDUSTRIAL PARTNERSHIP SPLIT ON HOW TO PAY FOR EFFORT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders in high-tech manufacturing are full of praise for Commerce Secretary 
Robert A. Mosbacher's endorsement of a new industry-government partnership to 
improve American competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
But they acknowledge, tongue in cheek, "minor" differences over one point: 
Money. 
</P>
<P>
The industrial officials say that, like Mosbacher, they oppose a heavy-handed 
program of federal bureaucrats dictating industrial policy. The government's 
past tries at picking winners have typically been expensive flops such as the 
effort to create a synthetic fuels industry in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the manufacturers want an "industry-led" policy where the private 
sector judges the market and chooses products and research programs worthy of 
special backing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cooperation Endorsed 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a bunch of guys in Washington sitting in a closet saying this is the 
way it's going to be," said Robert Costello, a former undersecretary of 
defense, now at the Hudson Institute, a private research group. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher, in a major departure from the free-market views of the Reagan 
Administration, endorsed that concept -- which involves cooperation rather than 
competition among companies -- in a speech earlier this month to the Economic 
Club of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
The commerce secretary and the manufacturers diverge, however, on who should 
pay. Mosbacher wants an industry-led and mostly industry-financed effort, while 
the manufacturing executives say government must match private funding. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel it is imperative that we communicate to the Administration that at some 
not too distant point more government funding is needed," said Rep. Mel Levine 
(D-Calif.), who led an industrial policy conference last week attended by such 
high-tech superstars as Robert Noyce, co-inventor of the microprocessor. 
</P>
<P>
But Mosbacher, speaking of the most likely candidate for a public-private 
partnership, high-definition television, warned at a congressional hearing that 
electronics companies asking for $1.35 billion in federal aid shouldn't expect 
Uncle Sam to act like "Uncle Sugar." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said industry can look to government to encourage research through 
such methods as loosening antitrust restrictions and providing tax incentives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposition Within Cabinet 
</P>
<P>
Levine and other participants in last week's conference are down-playing the 
money fight and lauding Mosbacher's step away from the doctrines of the 
previous Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher's statements are "a very significant step in the right direction," 
Levine said. "I don't want to underestimate the differences we have with the 
Administration at this point, but I think they can be bridged." 
</P>
<P>
However, it probably won't be enough to convince Mosbacher, even though he 
enjoys great influence with President Bush, an old friend. The commerce 
secretary reportedly faces opposition within the Cabinet from chief economic 
adviser Michael J. Boskin and budget director Richard G. Darman.

INSURANCE INDUSTRY TARGET IN RISING SPATE OF LAWSUITS

<P>
When George A. McKeon started working as a lawyer for Travelers Corp. nearly 
two decades ago, there were a trickle of lawsuits against the company. 
</P>
<P>
Today, it's a torrent. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon, now the company's general counsel, says the number of lawsuits has 
soared from about 20 when he started to more than 2,000 now pending. His yearly 
budget to handle litigation has also skyrocketed, from $21 million in 1967 to 
about $270 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers -- and much of the insurance industry -- is facing a new legal 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Not only has the number of normal claims-related lawsuits increased, but the 
industry itself is embroiled in high-stakes legal battles that pit it against 
the government and private industry. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Ostrager, a New York lawyer involved in much insurance industry 
litigation, has dubbed these cases "bet the company suits" because of their 
potential costs to insurers. 
</P>
<P>
For example: 
</P>
<P>
* Insurance companies have been sued by more than 200 manufacturers, including 
many Fortune 500 companies, over who will pay the bill for cleaning up 
America's toxic waste sites. The cost of cleaning up these sites has been 
estimated at $300 billion to $700 billion. 
</P>
<P>
* A sweeping antitrust lawsuit has been filed by 19 state attorneys general, 
accusing leading insurers of conspiring to restrict liability coverage for 
businesses and municipalities nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
* The Department of Justice has sued three leading insurers, including 
Travelers Corp., claiming that Medicare erroneously paid millions of dollars in 
claims that the three companies should have covered. Government lawyers say 
similar lawsuits against other insurers are likely in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Americans in general are increasingly turning to the courts to settle disputes 
of all types. And lawyers say there is a growing realization that the insurance 
industry has vast financial resources that can be tapped. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seen as More Vulnerable 
</P>
<P>
Also, there is anger in many quarters toward the industry. Some of it stems 
from problems that businesses and municipalities had finding insurance policies 
in the mid-1980s, and some stems from rising insurance costs. All of this has 
combined to create a political backlash against the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's beginning to feel more powerful vis-a-vis the insurance industry," 
said Robert Hunter, president of the National Insurance Consumer Organization, 
which promotes insurance industry reform. "Invisible and invulnerable they are 
no longer." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the industry has faced large potential problems before from product 
liability lawsuits involving asbestos and Agent Orange. But, lawyers say, the 
recent environmental lawsuits have upped the ante. 
</P>
<P>
A notable example was a recent legal battle between Shell Oil Co. and about 240 
of its insurers over who should pay the bill for cleanup at a toxic waste site 
near Denver. Cost estimates for cleaning up the site ranged from $750 million 
to about $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Ostrager, who represented Travelers and was the lead industry counsel in the 
Shell case, said the insurers spent tens of millions of dollars in the yearlong 
trial and that Shell spent about $50 million. A jury ruled in favor of the 
insurers this spring, saying that Shell's pollution at the Rocky Mountain 
arsenal facility was not an accident but the result of its normal business 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Politics Is a Factor 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers say court rulings in recent years have been fairly evenly divided 
between insurers and manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
While many lawyers believe that the industry's deep pockets have spurred the 
toxic waste lawsuits, George Bernstein, a Washington lawyer and former federal 
insurance administrator, said political motivations are driving the antitrust 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think one of the key motivations behind the lawsuits was to speed repeal of 
McCarran Ferguson," Bernstein said about the congressional act passed in 1945 
that provides insurers major exemptions from antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry analysts, say the effect of the antitrust lawsuits is in some 
ways potentially larger than that of environmental litigation. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits, most of which were filed in March and June, 1988, claim that four 
major insurers -- Allstate Insurance Co., Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., 
Hartford Fire Insurance Co. and Cigna Corp. -- conspired with two trade 
associations, brokers and reinsurers to limit the availability of liability 
insurance for dozens of towns and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
If the state attorneys general, including Connecticut's, win the case, it would 
have a profound effect on the insurance industry, including its long-held 
exemption from some antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
The insurance industry has also recently become a target of federal lawsuits. 
Government lawyers and investigators involved in the investigation of alleged 
Medicare payments say private insurers might be liable for as much as $10 
billion in claims that Medicare has paid erroneously. Besides Travelers Corp., 
the Department of Justice has sued Michigan Blue Cross Blue Shield and 
Provident Life &amp; Accident Insurance Co. of Chattanooga, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits were spurred by 1982 changes in the Medicare law that made private 
insurers the primary insurer for about 2 million older Americans who continue 
working after 65. 
</P>
<P>
Medicare was designated the secondary payer -- it is supposed to pay only what 
the primary insurer does not cover. 
</P>
<P>
The three lawsuits contend that Medicare has paid millions of dollars in claims 
that the private insurers should have covered under the new guidelines.

YOUR BODY: GOT THOSE VACATION EXPECTATION BLUES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today's the unofficial beginning of summer vacation season, when job-weary 
workers dream of getting on a plane and going . . . anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
But, if experience is any teacher, most of us will expect too much from our 
vacation, feel at least a little disappointed and return to work wondering why 
life's not wonderful, psychologists say. 
</P>
<P>
Vacations improve some parts of our lives but have little effect on others, 
said Linda L. Hoopes, an assistant professor of psychology at Colby College in 
Waterville, Me., who surveyed 140 vacationers and published the results 
recently in the Journal of Community Psychology. 
</P>
<P>
Vacations usually increase our overall satisfaction with life at least 
slightly, but they have special impact on marriage and family relationships, 
she found. Time off has the least effect, she said, on how we view our jobs and 
our feelings about our standard of living. Vacationers with troubled family 
relationships tend to return less satisfied, while those with satisfactory 
relationships say time off enhances the bonds even more. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consider Staying Home 
</P>
<P>
Besides believing a vacation will solve most of life's problems, many of us 
feel "we're supposed to go away, preferably to someplace glamorous." In lieu of 
living out that stereotype, Hoopes tells people to decide what they need from a 
vacation. "You may decide on holing up at home and unplugging the telephone." 
</P>
<P>
Other ways to maximize the benefits of time off, suggested by Hoopes and Kenyon 
Chan, a West Los Angeles psychologist: 
</P>
<P>
* Before taking family vacations, schedule planning meetings to set up rules 
and address "style" differences, Chan suggested. Family members should decide 
in advance, for instance, how they'll handle differences in driving styles or 
conflict between the family's "plan-ahead" and "spontaneous" personalities. 
</P>
<P>
* If a family vacation is longer than two weeks, members need to schedule some 
time alone, Chan suggested. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't feel you have to forget about work entirely. "People highly involved in 
their work in a positive way may not be comfortable abandoning it totally," 
Hoopes said. "I don't think it's unhealthy to be thinking about work on 
vacation, or even to call the office occasionally." 
</P>
<P>
* Don't try to do too much. Most vacationers overschedule activities and 
overestimate how many different places they can see, Hoopes said. "People 
schedule their vacations the way they schedule their work lives." 
</P>
<P>
* Solo travelers can boost vacation enjoyment by writing about their activities 
in a diary or sending postcards, Chan said. The activity is a nice substitute 
for the conversations couples and families enjoy during trips and can make 
mealtime seem less lonely, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Tests May Be Redone 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles area women whose Pap tests were analyzed at a Tarzana medical 
laboratory recently closed by the state may be hearing from their doctors soon. 
Responding to Department of Health Services demands, Central Diagnostic 
Laboratory last week sent letters to 15,000 California doctors, advising them 
that free reanalysis of existing smears is available for their patients who 
want it. 
</P>
<P>
It will be up to doctors, in turn, to notify patients if they believe 
rescreening is needed. The laboratory was closed in April after a state 
inspection found an unacceptably high error rate of 21% -- about seven times 
the error rate of the best labs. 
</P>
<P>
Women who are advised to have their Pap tests reanalyzed should be sure to 
check back with their doctors about the results within four to six weeks, said 
Dr. Richard H. Nalick, director of gynecologic oncology at the Hospital of the 
Good Samaritan and USC clinical associate professor of gynecologic oncology, 
since the reanalyzed smears could be as much as five years old. Nalick added 
that women who are advised to have their Pap tests reanalyzed should also 
undergo new ones, although he concedes not everyone agrees with that 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Various Risk Factors 
</P>
<P>
Nalick also believes that women with a history of abnormal Pap smears and those 
with human papillomavirus (HPV) -- or genital warts -- should have a Pap test 
every six months, rather than the annual test recommended by many. Other than 
previous abnormal Pap tests and genital warts, risk factors for cervical cancer 
include first intercourse before age 18 and multiple sexual partners. 
</P>
<P>
Recent studies suggest that cervical cancer may develop more quickly than 
experts previously believed. In one study, 37% of women with cervical cancer 
had a normal Pap test three years before the diagnosis. And the presence of 
genital warts may speed the development of cervical cancer, Nalick said. 
</P>
<P>
Low-cost Pap testing is now available for $10 at five county Comprehensive 
Health Centers: Edward R. Roybal, (213) 260-3354; H. Claude Hudson, (213) 
744-3672; Hubert H. Humphrey, (213) 235-7215; El Monte, (818) 579-8463; Long 
Beach, (213) 599-2153. 
</P>
<P>
Tending Toddler Toes 
</P>
<P>
Shoe-shopping parents should ignore traditional advice to buy sturdy leather 
shoes for toddlers, according to a USC physical therapist. 
</P>
<P>
"Toddlers seem to do better without any shoes or with flexible tennis shoes," 
said Michelle Larson, an assistant professor of physical therapy, who bases her 
recommendation on clinical observations and her recent study of 36 children, 
ranging in age from 18 to 30 months. In the study she evaluated the children's 
stride, step length, angle of foot placement and other indications of gait 
maturity and general stability. She tested them barefoot and wearing canvas 
sneakers, leather high-tops with rigid soles, and their own shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Kids performed best while barefoot and in sneakers, said Larson, who emphasizes 
her finding applies only to healthy children without orthopedic problems. Going 
barefoot -- on safe surfaces -- may also help develop the arches, she believes. 
Outdoors, she recommends low-cut sneakers or high-top sneakers made of soft 
material. 
</P>
<P>
Such shoes allow free movement of the ankles, important while kids are 
developing their gait. "Children don't attain their adult gait until age 3 or 
4," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
Many podiatrists agree with Larson's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
"That's exactly what I tell my patients," said Herschel Rosenblum, a Glendale 
podiatrist. "Forget leather shoes. Inexpensive shoes are OK. Athletic-type 
shoes are preferable for little kids." 
</P>
<P>
Franklin Kase, a Burbank podiatrist and president of the Los Angeles County 
Podiatric Medical Society, offered some additional advice for children's 
shoe-shopping: "The arch support is not that critical. Look for a shoe that 
fits well around the heel and that allows freedom of movement in the front of 
the shoe." As for length: "A child's shoe should be one finger width longer 
than the longest toe."

CRITIC AT LARGE: RETURN OF INNOCENCE SIGNALS A SWITCH IN HOLLYWOOD'S FOCUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are signs, not much brighter than the gleam in a writer's eye, that 
innocence could be making a comeback as a viable film commodity. 
</P>
<P>
Innocence and goodness were staples of the movies from the start. Chaplin's 
tramp could be sly and even mischievous, but his targets were always the 
bullies and the stuffed shirts and there was never any doubt that his heart was 
utterly pure. 
</P>
<P>
As you thrilled to the silver screen, you knew -- and it was comforting -- that 
as bad as things got the good people would win; the guys in the white hats 
might be outnumbered but they had righteousness on their side. The results were 
only temporarily in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the innocent suffered casualties along the way, you also knew that the 
bad people wouldn't get away with it in the end; there would be retribution, 
from the law or from the hand of divine Providence. 
</P>
<P>
The happy, justice-is-served ending was practically mandated by the Hays Code 
that shaped mainstream American movies for more than 30 years. It was all very 
simple and it had more to do with dreams than with reality. Hollywood was not 
called the Dream Factory for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
In the postwar years, there was increasing resistance among film makers as well 
as audiences to the arbitrary presumption that goodness had to win on screen. 
The gulf between ideal life as the movies portrayed it and life as it was lived 
was often a yawning chasm. "The Grapes of Wrath" is still awesome not only for 
its artistry but for its unvarnished social realism. 
</P>
<P>
One of the consequences of the new latitudes possible under the so-called 
Valenti ratings adopted late in 1968 was that the old presumptions about the 
inevitable triumph of virtue were cast aside. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, all you could be sure of was that the good guys probably wouldn't 
win, that even John Wayne would get shot down by the bad guy halfway into the 
film, as he was in "The Cowboys." 
</P>
<P>
In other genres, the bad guys would pull off the caper and fly happily away to 
Majorca or Maui, leaving the cops shaking their fists impotently at the airport 
gate. 
</P>
<P>
A knowing cynicism replaced innocence as an operative tone in a lot of film 
writing. As I once noted, the movies spent 50 years saying they lived happily 
ever after, and then began saying the couple would be lucky to make it through 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
It was a refreshing change, especially in the first years, from the pat and 
artificial tidying-up of the imposed happy endings. The astringency was like 
uncut lemon juice, and it gave movies a new sharpness. 
</P>
<P>
But cynicism is its own kind of artifice, and in time it can be as wearying as 
the final clinch and the walk into the sunset. 
</P>
<P>
Not only that, cynicism goes against what most moviegoers still hope or 
subconsciously expect to find at their neighborhood cinema. The wide audience 
presumes to have an uncommon and diverting experience, but -- at one level or 
another -- to have a reassuring and satisfying experience. 
</P>
<P>
The reassurance is either that things really can work out OK or, if something 
went tragically wrong, that it was because certain agreed rules of behavior 
were broken. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy enough to paint a convincingly real world in which guile, cynicism, 
betrayal and all the deadly sins are prevalent. What is not so easy is to 
portray a convincing innocence (or goodness, honesty or any combination of 
heroic traditional virtues) and not have it seem a combination of stupidity and 
naivete. 
</P>
<P>
But there is more innocence around than the movies have been eager to admit in 
recent times, more of a wish for real love than passing fancies. 
</P>
<P>
The recent English film, "Getting It Right," looks at a contemporary London 
world that is anything but innocent. It seems, if anything, feverishly amoral, 
though with only the most fleeting pleasure derived from the soiled goings-on. 
Hypocrisy runs through this small segment of society like wall-to-wall 
carpeting. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in Randal Kleiser's film, written by Elizabeth Jane Howard from her own 
novel, the relatively innocent protagonist makes the absolutely right choice 
among the available ladies, picking the relatively innocent young mother, a 
single parent who, like the hero, has survived a disillusioning world with her 
hopes intact. And there are intimations in another character's life that the 
absence of love is a formula for despair. 
</P>
<P>
"Field of Dreams" is the most explicit encounter of innocence versus cynicism 
in recent movies. The cynics might argue that the only way you can show 
innocence is to create a fantasy, as "Field of Dreams" undoubtedly was. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Kevin Costner's act of faith in turning his corn field into a ball diamond 
is not a great deal more visionary than Preston Tucker's search for the perfect 
car. It's just that the Costner character listened to a different voice. The 
faith is the point. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals of "Rain Man" are various, and it continues to be one of the 
best-attended films in the country. But part of the appeal (felt if not 
consciously thought about) may just be that Dustin Hoffman's autistic savant is 
really the perfect innocent -- the diametrical opposite of his worldly, cynical 
and conniving brother. The savant is so completely true to himself that his 
innocence is inviolable. 
</P>
<P>
For all the excesses that have come along with it, the freeing-up of the screen 
over the last 20 years has been invaluable to film as an art form. The movies 
can see life as it is, without the necessity of softly diffusing filters or the 
handcuffs of a very specific code. 
</P>
<P>
But innocence is as much a part of life as a cynical worldliness. The pendulum 
having swung far into the smoggy airs of cynicism, it may be dropping back a 
little, to a more balanced position, where the movies can rediscover that 
there's another way to tell it.

PAINTER BLENDS, TRANSCENDS CULTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN TAYLOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li Huai once thought she would never have the artistic opportunities she has 
today. Seven years ago the Chinese painter, living in Beijing, was struggling 
to express her feelings about Mao Tse-tung's Cultural Revolution through 
abstract paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Now Li Huai, 34, no longer has to struggle to express her creativity. After her 
1983 marriage in China to Paul Pickowicz, a UC San Diego Chinese history and 
film professor, she took 500 completed paintings and her dreams to the United 
States. Since then, Li Huai has been working out of a studio in La Jolla and 
from June 10 to July 23, 60 of her works will be exhibited at the San Diego 
Museum of Art in a show titled "Li Huai: An Artist in Two Cultures." 
</P>
<P>
In the show Li Huai (her friends call her Li but professionally she uses her 
full name) will offer visitors a contemporary perspective of the contrast 
between Western and Chinese artistic cultures. The paintings reflect the impact 
of the Cultural Revolution, which stifled her modern, avant-garde style 
paintings, as well as her classical Confucian training, which she began at age 
7 with traditional Chinese calligraphy lessons. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifty of the 60 paintings were done in China. They were all banned during the 
Cultural Revolution," said Li Huai. Five of the paintings are a series of nudes 
done 10 years ago. "Even now these would be considered immoral," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were thought of as bourgeois -- decadence," said Pickowicz. 
</P>
<P>
Li Huai, her husband and their 4-year-old daughter, Natasha, now live in 
Valencia, where she is in the Master of Fine Arts program at CalArts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's rare to see someone come out of one culture and adapt so readily to 
another. But Li made an incredible adaptation to art in the U.S.," said Millie 
Wilson, director of programs and art at CalArts. "She is a phenomenal painter 
even without her bicultural background -- and produced an amazing art 
installation." If she was not in the United States, she would be doing 
remarkable things in China, she said. 
</P>
<P>
As Li Huai sat in her Valencia home, she remembered what it was like when she 
first arrived in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I had so much energy. Suddenly I could use color, form and content I never 
could use before. Suddenly I could work on problems that I wanted to paint 
about while I was still in China." 
</P>
<P>
"Li was like a person dying of thirst," said Pickowicz, also remembering those 
first few years. Except it was a thirst that could not be quenched in just a 
few days -- it took three years. Li worked day and night to finish up the 
agenda that she could not complete in China." 
</P>
<P>
The best example of this "burst of energy" is work No. 51 in the exhibit, said 
Pickowicz. The painting, "Ferule," consists of 52 individual panels. Each panel 
tells a separate tale of the human holocaust of the Cultural Revolution, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Many people think that Chinese artists come to America and immediately paint 
American things, said Pickowicz. Not Li Huai -- she had too much else on her 
mind, he said. "She had to come to terms with the Revolution first." 
</P>
<P>
Other people think that all Chinese artists either paint bamboo and birds, 
exotic landscapes, or 19th- and early 20th-Century art being produced in China. 
It is much harder to be judged in terms of global art, he said. 
</P>
<P>
And Li Huai does not want to be stereotyped as a Chinese artist or an American 
artist for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to be regarded as part of the critical art world," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly all preconceptions about Li Huai are dropped as soon as visitors 
enter her studio. 
</P>
<P>
"They may walk in hoping to see only charcoal drawings of exotic landscapes 
done on rice paper," said Pickowicz. "And they do see this. But they also come 
out of her studio shaken up -- for the better." 
</P>
<P>
"Salted Fish," for instance, brings together traditional Chinese culture and 
the struggle to reach beyond the Chinese social context, the artist said. In 
the painting Li Huai uses dark grays, blacks and hand-painted white words, 
telling the ancient folk story about Chinese salted fish. She said the 
painting, different from anything she has created before, is her way of showing 
the complex web of connections among people in China. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese do not just have to learn from Americans, but Americans have to 
learn from the Chinese, said Li Huai. "It's a two-way street." 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese are now becoming interested in Modernism, but they are still way 
behind Western art. They have no idea about Postmodernism," she said, pointing 
out that when she finishes her studies at CalArts she wants to actively help 
inform Chinese artists and art students about what is going on in the art world 
outside China. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the artist and her husband are planning to take 20 American art and 
film students to China next summer. Through an agreement with the University of 
California and the Beijing Film Institute, where Li Huai did her undergraduate 
studies, the couple are planning to lead a four-week seminar on the resurgence 
of Chinese cinema in the '80s and the extent to which it draws inspiration from 
traditional and foreign themes.

A MAJOR STUDIO PLAYER;

<P>
COLUMBIA PROFITS RAZOR-THIN, BUT ALLEN MAKES BIG-TIME GAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Upstairs, on the 11th floor of 711 Fifth Ave., is the corporate headquarters of 
Columbia Pictures Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
It is a problem child of the movie industry, plagued by films that don't sell 
("Slaves of New York," "Chances Are," "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen," 
"True Believer"), and managers who don't stick (David Puttnam, Francis "Fay" 
Vincent, Guy McElwaine, Frank Price, Alan Hirschfield, David Begelman). 
</P>
<P>
Downstairs, on the 9th floor, are the offices of Big Investor Herbert A. Allen, 
a one-time Columbia chairman who has held stock in the studio since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, the 49-year-old Allen and other long-term shareholders have 
profited hugely from Columbia, no matter how badly some of its movies and 
managers have done. 
</P>
<P>
When Coca-Cola Co. bought what used to be Columbia Pictures Industries in 1982, 
Allen swapped his firm's 600,000 Columbia shares, purchased for around $4 a 
share, for $42 million in cash and Coke stock. 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, Coke merged its studio with Tri-Star Pictures to form a 
49%-owned subsidiary, Columbia Pictures Entertainment. Allen, a director of 
both Coke and the new Columbia, quickly scored again. He kept his Coke stock, 
now worth $65 million, and augmented his extensive Columbia holdings with an 
additional 1.8 million Columbia shares purchased at prices under $10, which 
helped push that stock toward $20 amid rumors that Coke would sell the studio 
to a big foreign buyer like Sony Corp. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, the buyout hasn't come and Columbia's profits remain razor-thin. 
But the rumors persist -- and Allen is still counting gains on the 9th floor, 
while Columbia executives, led by president and CEO Victor Kaufman, scratch for 
success just two stories up. 
</P>
<P>
Entering its 17th year, Allen's upstairs-downstairs relationship with Columbia 
remains one of Hollywood's most closely watched, and least understood, 
corporate marriages. Allen and Kaufman have declined to discuss it, although 
Kaufman said: 
</P>
<P>
"Herbert is a very close friend and we've been business associates for a long 
period of time. Herbert's made very significant contributions to Columbia -- 
both as a member of the board and as an investment banker. In my view, he has 
one of the broadest bases of knowledge about the entertainment industry, a 
tremendous amount of experience, and he brings a lot to the company as a 
result."

Some friends say Allen, the poker-faced scion of a rich investment banking clan 
that once controlled Warner Bros., stays with Columbia less from love than from 
fascination with its lucrative intricacies. "Herbert does it because he has 
found not a solution to the conundrum, but a rationale that makes it very 
profitable," says John Heyman, a British film financier and Allen intimate. 
</P>
<P>
Heyman adds: "He's not married to the film industry, so becoming uninvolved 
with Columbia would not be a painful divorce. If an offer was received 
acceptable to Coke and advantageous to the other shareholders, he would sell in 
an instant and find lots of other equally fun investments." 
</P>
<P>
Fay Vincent, a former Columbia chairman who remains close to Allen in Vincent's 
new position as deputy commissioner of Major League Baseball, tends to agree. 
"I don't think Herbert's sentimental. . . . He has shown that he's willing to 
sell things at the right price," says Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
That presumed willingness to sell could be a critical factor in Columbia's 
future, since Allen wields enormous influence as a member of the Coke board's 
finance, executive and compensation committees. Allen &amp; Co. Inc., a 
securities firm founded by Allen in 1964, has also served as investment banker 
and adviser to Columbia, Tri-Star and Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
One of Hollywood's more exotic recent rumors claimed that Allen was trying to 
lure Michael Ovitz, president of the powerful Creative Artists Agency, into an 
arrangement under which Ovitz would run all or part of Columbia in return for a 
major ownership stake in the studio. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Ovitz declined to comment, and one friend of Allen privately 
maintains that the investor is only casually acquainted with the agent. In any 
case, Kaufman and his movie chief, Dawn Steel, have clearly mended fences with 
CAA since Columbia's disastrous battle with the agency under the short regime 
of Englishman David Puttnam. Release schedules for both the Tri-Star and 
Columbia units, led by "Ghostbusters II," which is scheduled to open June 16, 
are heavy with CAA's projects and stars. 
</P>
<P>
(One theory has it that Columbia and Allen are only waiting for profits from 
"Ghostbusters" to make their move. "Everybody knows companies sell better with 
big earnings. There are no earnings at Columbia right now," says one Hollywood 
attorney with ties to the studio.) 
</P>
<P>
In New York, buyout speculation has continued to center on large corporate 
players. Columbia stock recently peaked at 21 1/4 -- despite reported profits 
of just $21.7 million, in keeping with a previously announced company 
expectation of low earnings -- partly on rumors that L'Oreal, a French 
cosmetics firm, had been buying Columbia stock. 
</P>
<P>
"The worse the earnings are, the more the Street believes Coke will want out," 
says one Wall Street securities analyst, who declines to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
A Coke spokesman didn't return calls seeking comment on the buyout talk. 
</P>
<P>
Allen played a principal role in brokering Columbia's sale to Coke, at a time 
when the studio was still recovering from a takeover battle with investor Kirk 
Kerkorian and the taint of David Begelman's financial misdeeds when he headed 
Columbia's movie operations. The wisdom of that stroke has provoked debate. 
"Was it a plus or a minus? It made a lot of people a lot of money. But the 
company was not thereafter independent, and went through a lot of thrashings," 
says Vincent, who was pushed aside as Columbia's chief in the 1987 combination 
with Tri-Star. 
</P>
<P>
During the Coke years, Columbia built a massive television presence, largely by 
acquiring Embassy Television and Merv Griffin Enterprises, which produces 
"Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy." Kaufman credits Allen with engineering the 
purchase of both Embassy and Loews Theatre Management Corp., which gave 
Columbia a major presence in theatrical exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
But the movie operation, the yardstick by which Hollywood tends to measure 
success, never stabilized, despite -- or because of -- Allen's complex 
loyalties to various executives. 
</P>
<P>
When Begelman, then Columbia's film chief, was discovered to have 
misappropriated about $100,000 in 1977, Allen backed him to the hilt against 
studio chairman Alan Hirschfield, who eventually lost his own job in the fight. 
As recently as 1987, Allen told Institutional Investor in a rare interview that 
his major mistake was not to have dismissed Hirschfield sooner. "I should have 
fired Alan Hirschfield the first day I found that he was negotiating with 
(British investor) Jimmy Goldsmith to take over the company. But I didn't want 
to; I had known him too long. I was too soft on him. In those days I think I 
was easier to push around," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Allen developed a close bond with movie chief Frank Price, who scored 
heavily for Columbia with "Tootsie" and other films. Yet his ultimate loyalty 
went to Vincent, an old Williams College schoolmate who let Price defect to 
Universal rather than accede to demands for fuller authority. 
</P>
<P>
(Price, now an independent producer, has persistently been rumored as a 
potential player in some future Columbia regime, should present movie chief 
Dawn Steel fail. Allen has done his share to keep the rumors alive. "If I had 
my way, Frank Price would still be running Columbia," he told one acquaintance 
last year.) 
</P>
<P>
According to several accounts, Allen became sufficiently detached from 
Columbia's day-to-day dealings under Coca-Cola that he never even met David 
Puttnam until several days after Vincent's decision to hire the British 
producer as movie chief in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Within a year, however, he became bitterly angered by what he believed were 
Puttnam's excessively close dealings with British cronies, to the exclusion of 
Hollywood's major stars. And when Puttnam left in the 1987 restructuring, Allen 
threw his weight behind Tri-Star president and former Columbia general counsel 
Kaufman -- to whom he has been staunchly loyal over the years, despite 
widespread criticism of Tri-Star's creative record ever since Kaufman, Vincent, 
Allen and others helped create the new studio as a joint venture of Columbia, 
CBS and Time Inc. in 1982. "Victor is inclusive. Puttnam is exclusive," Allen 
once explained. 
</P>
<P>
Allen's closest friend in Hollywood remains Ray Stark, the 73-year-old producer 
who helped broker his initial investment in Columbia when the studio was 
teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, and it owed Stark money. 
</P>
<P>
"Herbert had a certain intuition when we bought the stock," Stark said during a 
recent interview. "I had more than one reason for wishing Columbia to succeed, 
since it owed me quite a bit of money which I would have lost if the company 
had gone bankrupt. But it was different with Herbert. He just believed in 
Columbia's future." 
</P>
<P>
The quintessential New Yorker, Allen lives at the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan, 
and has homes in Southampton and Sun Valley. He counts novelist Tom Wolfe among 
his friends -- "The Bonfire of the Vanities," about the fall of an investment 
banking giant, cribbed episodes from Allen's life -- and he maintains a 
museum-class collection of American Impressionist paintings, although he 
stopped buying, on principle, when art prices pushed beyond levels he found 
reasonable in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Allen's second marriage, to actress Anne Reinking, broke up last year. Friends 
say he remains cool as ever toward the film community and its trappings; yet 
his firm has extended the Hollywood side of its business far beyond Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
(Non-entertainment interests have ranged from MCI in telecommunications and 
Northwest Energy in natural gas, to the now defunct Washington Airlines, a 
commuter carrier that Allen has numbered among his worst investments.) 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Shuman, an Allen &amp; Co. partner, has been financial adviser to 
Rupert Murdoch for more than a decade, and sits on the board of News Corp., 
through which Murdoch controls Fox Inc. In the last several years, moreover, 
Sydney Pollack, Ron Howard, Brian Grazer, Barry Diller, Jeffrey Katzenberg, 
Terry Semel and other Hollywood insiders have become regulars at the Allen 
firm's annual investment seminar, held every July in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Invitations to the weeklong event are limited for the most part to about 100 
major money managers and corporate chief executives. Power brokers and their 
spouses golf, play tennis, shoot skeet and discuss the future of American 
business. But a major attraction, maintains Grazer -- whose Imagine Films 
Entertainment was launched by Allen &amp; Co. -- is Herbert Allen's personal 
magnetism. 
</P>
<P>
"He has an aura of power, control, and class," says Grazer. "You want to stand 
in that aura." 
</P>
<P>
Less enamored of Allen are a small group of shareholders in the former 
Tri-Star, who filed three lawsuits in Delaware's Chancery Court challenging the 
combination with Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
A key contention in the complex dispute is that Allen -- who is not named as a 
defendant -- wasn't an impartial adviser when his firm rendered a fairness 
opinion to Columbia Pictures Entertainment directors on the transaction, and 
received $5 million in fees, because he was intimately involved with the 
business of both Tri-Star and Coke. 
</P>
<P>
Allen &amp; Co. received an additional $2.5 million in fees for advising 
Columbia on the sale of assets in 1988. Another company owned by Herbert Allen 
got $2.5 million from Columbia in return for an interest in an airplane he had 
previously co-owned with the studio. In previous years, moreover, Allen &amp; 
Co. received substantial income from co-underwriting a major Coke securities 
sale, and from its involvement with various Delphi Film Associates 
partnerships, which raised movie funds for Columbia and Tri-Star. 
</P>
<P>
One suit, in which Columbia's motion to dismiss was denied earlier this month, 
specifically charges that the merger terms unfairly favored Coke stockholders 
because they were based on the relative book value of Tri-Star and Columbia 
assets -- and no sooner was the new company formed, than it wrote down Columbia 
assets by $200 million, or more than 25%, to reflect losses on David Puttnam's 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia has contested the claims, maintaining, among other things, that the 
terms were based on more than just the book value. A Columbia spokeswoman says 
company policy prohibits comment on pending litigation.

IRVINE PLANS LAW TO RESTRICT MATERIALS THAT DESTROY OZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trying to do their small part to save Earth's protective ozone layer, Irvine 
city officials today will propose a model ordinance that bans or severely 
restricts the use of chlorofluorocarbons in packaging, air conditioning, home 
insulation and solvents. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Mayor Larry Agran said the draft ordinance appears to be more 
comprehensive than any in the United States that aims to limit the use of 
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs -- synthetic chemicals that destroy ozone. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can make a dent in the problem and also set an example and inspire 
other localities -- state and national governments to move more quickly" on 
this environmental issue, he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recycling CFCs 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance would require any business that repairs refrigerators or 
air-conditioning units containing CFCs to capture them for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
It also would require builders to find a substitute for insulating materials 
made with CFCs and to dispose of any CFC-laden materials "properly." And it 
would forbid supermarkets and fast-food restaurants from using any packaging 
material made with CFCs, such as plastic foam containers and cups. 
</P>
<P>
Violators would face fines of $50 for the first offense, $100 for the next 
offense and possible civil litigation, according to draft language in the 
proposed ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Several cities, including Berkeley, already have imposed a ban on packaging 
materials made with CFCs. In early May, the Vermont legislature passed a bill 
banning automobile air conditioners that use CFCs. That legislation becomes 
effective for cars registered or sold in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Irvine's proposed ordinance includes provisions similar to the other 
laws but goes beyond them, Agran said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
June 29 Public Hearing 
</P>
<P>
Although the proposal may be unprecedented, Agran said he doubted that it would 
be controversial. Business leaders may have questions about it, he said, but 
every business in Irvine will get a copy of the proposed ordinance before June 
29 when a public hearing on the issue is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the ordinance would become effective July 1, 1990, giving 
businesses time to adjust to the new restrictions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a "Dear Irvine Business Owner" letter accompanying the proposal 
suggested that some businessmen might at least have reason to be concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"Some limitations will occur for businesses that use CFCs or products 
containing CFCs," the letter said. But, it added, "By participating 
enthusiastically, all residents of Irvine will garner the satisfaction 
</P>
<P>
that comes from doing the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, alarmed scientists have discovered a gaping hole in ozone over 
the antarctic as well as increasing losses of ozone around the world. Ozone 
shields the Earth from ultraviolet rays that can cause skin cancer. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of measurable ozone losses and proof that CFCs were to blame, 31 
nations including the United States, pledged in 1987 to reduce consumption of 
CFCs by 50% by the end of the century. Last year, American CFC manufacturers, 
including the Du Pont Co. of Wilmington, Del., promised to phase out production 
of the compound. 
</P>
<P>
Agran said a newly created city of Irvine Science Advisory Task Force spent 4 
months studying ways to regulate CFCs. 
</P>
<P>
"In most cases there are suitable substitutes" to materials made with CFCs, he 
said. "I think we've been careful not to require the impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Interested in Irvine's approach was UC Irvine chemistry professor F. Sherwood 
Rowland, who, with researcher Mario Molina, discovered in 1974 that CFCs were 
destroying ozone. 
</P>
<P>
That research was accepted by the National Academy of Sciences, and in 1978 it 
led to a ban on nearly all aerosol sprays containing CFCs. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, however, CFC manufacturers disparaged Rowland and Molina's 
findings, claiming that they were theoretical and that there was no proof that 
CFCs were destroying atmospheric ozone. However, with the discovery of the 
growing hole in ozone above the antarctic and other ozone losses, even CFC 
manufacturers now concede there is a problem.

A 51ST YEAR OF FLAGS, CROSSES, REMEMBERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The youth band never showed up. And when the somber-faced color detail from 
Fullerton High School's Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps raised the 
American flag to half-staff, it twisted and stuck and had to be hoisted again. 
</P>
<P>
But minor snafus were beside the point for the more than 200 people who proudly 
ushered in Memorial Day at Fullerton's Loma Vista Memorial Park with patriotic 
songs, prayers, speeches and, at the close of Monday's 75-minute ceremony, a 
deafening rifle salute. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 51st year of the service -- and the 51st year that Fullerton 
residents had placed a small flag and a white wooden cross beside the grave of 
every military man or woman buried in the memorial park, said Fullerton City 
Councilman A.B. (Buck) Catlin, who was master of ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5,000 Flags and Wooden Crosses 
</P>
<P>
Resplendent in a red, white and blue striped tie, Catlin spoke against a 
dramatic backdrop of 5,000 flags and wooden crosses that dotted the wide green 
cemetery lawn. 
</P>
<P>
"Tradition is what all these things are like," he said. "And Fullerton in north 
Orange County is definitely traditional Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the style of this Memorial Day 
</P>
<P>
ceremony was traditional. 
</P>
<P>
Soloist Delores Brown led the crowd in several choruses of the National Anthem 
and "God Bless America." 
</P>
<P>
Msgr. John Sammon of the Diocese of Orange prayed for freedom and warned that 
"we cannot take (liberty) for granted." 
</P>
<P>
And Rear Adm. Robert B. Halder, commander of the Naval Medical Command 
Southwest Region in San Diego, gave the keynote speech honoring "a special 
American -- the military medic." 
</P>
<P>
Working out of modern hospitals, MASH units and submarines, military medics 
perform vital and "altruistic" services every day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not only have thousands of medics "paid the final price for our freedom," 
Halder said, but "a medic's comforting arms were the last memory of many of 
those who rest in peace here today." 
</P>
<P>
After Halder's speech, the crowd was silent as Kiwanis Club leader Carl Goodman 
and Bette Freeman of the Santa Ana chapter of American Gold Star Mothers read 
names of some "departed veterans." 
</P>
<P>
Then men and women representing 19 local groups stepped forward for the annual 
placement of the wreaths. Escorted by a young Marine Corps officer, each walked 
slowly to a gray concrete obelisk commemorating fallen veterans, then stooped 
and gently placed their flowers at the base of the column. 
</P>
<P>
The names of organizations participating in this ritual read like a list of 
patriots. Gold Star Wives of America were there. So were officials from the 
American Legion Auxiliary, the Air Force Sergeants Assn., the B-17 Combat 
Crewmen and Wingmen and 15 other groups. 
</P>
<P>
After another prayer by Sammon, half a dozen Fullerton police officers pointed 
their rifles at the sky for a final salute, and the program was over. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'See You Next Year' 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you very much for coming," Catlin said. "We'll see you next year." 
</P>
<P>
All in all, it was a great Memorial Day observance, Sharline McDaniel said. "I 
love it, I love it," she exclaimed as she paused to photograph a veterans' 
plaque. 
</P>
<P>
But with the service over, McDaniel said, her work was about to begin. In 
several days, she and other volunteers from a patriotic group called the 
Fullerton Emblem Club plan to visit the cemetery again and pick up 2,300 flags. 
</P>
<P>
They will cart the flags to a member's home, bring along several ironing boards 
and then "we'll go and press every one of them," McDaniel said. 
</P>
<P>
When the ironing is done and the flags are rolled and put away for next year, 
this Memorial Day will truly be over, McDaniel said.

<P>
MINIATURE GOLF COURSE HOLDUP NETS $11,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two armed men in ski masks forced their way into the office at a miniature golf 
course Monday morning, tied up the assistant manager and made off with $11,000 
in cash and the assistant manager's pickup truck, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
The assistant manager, Steve D. White of Fountain Valley, was released by other 
employees, who found White bound to a post in the video arcade at the Family 
Fun Center on Magnolia Street at the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The holdup occurred shortly after 7 a.m., when White arrived at work, police 
said. They quoted White as saying he heard knocks at the door, thought they 
came from employees appearing for work and opened the door. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, there were two disguised men armed with handguns who forced White to 
open the office safe.

MISSION VIEJO MEETS RAMONA IN SOFTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mission Viejo High School's softball team must feel as if it has a fairy 
godmother, because just when everything was going wrong, the team was granted 
its most desperate wish -- a berth in the Southern Section 3-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo (17-8) has made the most of its at-large berth, upsetting 
top-seeded La Mirada on the way to today's semifinal against Ramona (22-7) at 
3:15 p.m. at Alicia Park in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
But things looked bleak three weeks ago. The Diablos struggled through the last 
half of South Coast League play and finished fourth at 14-8. 
</P>
<P>
During that stretch, the Diablos lost starting pitcher Erin Fitzgerald (0.58 
earned-run average). She was trying to get into her home after school and 
banged on the front door just a little too hard. 
</P>
<P>
"That's all it took," Fitzgerald said. "My hand swelled up the size of a 
balloon and it was all blue and it had to be casted right away." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the hand was not broken, even though Fitzgerald was lost for the 
last half of league play. 
</P>
<P>
Diablo Coach Jeff Cunningham told his team that it had to beat El Toro in the 
team's final league game to have a chance for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo lost. 
</P>
<P>
"The seniors went through the emotion of thinking that was their last game," 
Cunningham said. "I had not even looked at the possibility of an at-large 
berth." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo's luck was about to change. The Diablos were granted an at-large 
berth, and Fitzgerald healed just in time to take the mound for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the draw, I told the girls I didn't know that we would be selected," 
Cunningham said. "I felt we deserved to be because we had been rated in the 
(Southern Section) 3-A division up until the last week. We played a very good 
preseason, scheduling teams like Marina, Mater Dei, Canyon, Tustin, Foothill. 
There were only two teams on our schedule that didn't make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Our record came against quality teams, so I told the girls we deserved to be 
in and if we got in, we could compete with just about any team in the 3-A." 
</P>
<P>
In the playoffs, Mission Viejo has defeated South Torrance, 4-1, La Mirada, 
2-1, and Montclair, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-A division:

Servite High School running back Derek Brown, who established a county 
single-season rushing record last fall, has been added to the North squad for 
the 30th Orange County All-Star football game scheduled for June 30 at Orange 
Coast College's LeBard Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was originally selected to play in the charity game in April but declined 
the invitation and was replaced by teammate Chris Johnson. Brown told game 
officials last Thursday that he had changed his mind and wanted to play. 
</P>
<P>
Game officials agreed to add Brown to the North's 36-man roster, and in return, 
the South added University running back Jim Roberson.

Charles Beatty Jr. hasn't been to the movies alone in 20 years, since he lost 
most of his hearing to a case of the mumps. With the help of two hearing aids 
and a decent seat near the middle of a cinema, he can understand the sound 
track pretty well. 
</P>
<P>
"But if my wife or sons can't go, I don't go," says Beatty, an audiologist and 
president of Audiometrics Inc. of Longview, Tex. "I miss enough so that if my 
wife weren't there to ask, say, why the actors are laughing, it would take out 
much of my enjoyment." 
</P>
<P>
Audiometrics Inc. is one of a small number of firms putting the enjoyment into 
movie-going for the nearly 20 million hearing-impaired children and adults in 
the United States, through the use of infrared Audex systems that transmit 
sound to a headset and portable receiver worn around the viewer's neck. 
</P>
<P>
Infrared sound transmission was first used in theaters in the 1979 Broadway 
production of Peter Pan in Manhattan, but it did not hit the movies until the 
late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enjoy All the Nuances 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to companies such as Beatty's and cinemas such as the Mann Theatres 
chain, the hearing-impaired can now go to selected theaters and enjoy all the 
nuances of a feature film, from the crunch of feet over gravel to the staccato 
gunfire of a gang battle. 
</P>
<P>
On June 23, Mann Theatres will open eight screens in Laguna Niguel, complete 
with an Audex system, bringing the chain's number of enhanced screens to 33. 
This Christmas, the company opened a nineplex in San Diego that uses Audex. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Cineplex Odeon chain has several theaters with infrared 
systems made by other companies. And United Artists has started a pilot program 
that uses a system created by Nady Systems Inc. of Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The expense can be great, but theaters are starting to shell out up to $10,000 
per screen to make movies accessible. The reasons are simple: The cinema 
business is so competitive that a market of millions cannot be ignored. And 
state governments are starting to insist on accessibility for the handicapped, 
even when it comes to private businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Mann installed Beatty's Audex system, says Mann ad director Rich Given, because 
"we consider this to be the future of the business. It's highly competitive, 
both from other theaters and home video." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
California, Florida Lead 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts say California and Florida are the first two states to adopt 
building regulations demanding that assembly halls open to the general public 
be equipped with so-called "assistive listening devices." 
</P>
<P>
But it has not been an easy battle for the hearing-impaired. William Cutler, 
national president of Self Help for Hard of Hearing People, says 3 years of 
intensive lobbying was needed before California's regulations were adopted in 
January. The regulations will go into effect on Jan. 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses were hard to persuade "because they are paying the bill," Cutler 
says. "Our biggest block during the 3 years it took to get California's code 
change were the hotels. They have a good lobbyist, and it took a lot of 
persuasion to make them realize that an assistive listening system is peanuts 
compared to the total cost of developing a property." 
</P>
<P>
Movie theater owners were not easy sells, either. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems we're having is convincing theaters that if they put this 
in they'll get an increase in customers," says Beatty, who still cannot attend 
the theater alone in his home of Longview because "we have had a difficult time 
getting the movie chains in our areas interested." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Owner Group's Chief Skeptical 
</P>
<P>
Robert W. Selig, president of the National Assn. of Theatre Owners of 
California, is slightly dubious about the power of listening devices to 
increase audience size. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping that the accommodation will bring in people who do have a hearing 
deficiency," Selig says. "But there are no statistics developed yet." 
</P>
<P>
Even though public places have been equipped for wheelchair access for a 
considerable time, Selig says, "we do not have evidence that all of a sudden 
people in wheelchairs are rushing to theaters because there is accommodation." 
</P>
<P>
California's regulations say that all public assembly rooms with public address 
systems, opening after Jan. 1 and seating 100 or more spectators must be 
equipped with some such listening system. 
</P>
<P>
Existing buildings are exempt unless they are remodeled, says Jud Boies, 
accessibility and compliance director for the Office of the State Architect. 
</P>
<P>
Boies says his office had hoped to make an even broader sweep through 
California's assembly rooms but backed off temporarily "because it's kind of a 
new idea and a new technology." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Letters to Office 
</P>
<P>
"We had more people write us who were hearing impaired and had them tell us 
they want this more than anything we've ever done," Boies says. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so amazing to see the excitement in these people. . . . It was a 
wonderful thing to see. It opens up a whole new world for people with hearing 
impairments. It changes their lives." 
</P>
<P>
While the California codes do not state what kind of system should be 
installed, they do suggest three sorts, including infrared systems such as 
Beatty's. 
</P>
<P>
The Audex system provides hearing assistance through a portable personal 
receiver available free at box offices. A transmitter is tied to the theater's 
sound system. The transmitter amplifies the signal as it changes it into 
infrared light and beams it across the theater. 
</P>
<P>
The infrared light is invisible to the human eye and stays within the theater 
walls, which keeps it from interfering with other presentations in multiplex 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
The beam is intercepted by a small portable receiver equipped with a lens. The 
lens converts the light to electrical energy so it can be amplified and 
delivered to the ears via headphones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Audience Size Increased 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Singleton, manager of the Mann Grove 9 Theatres in San Diego, is one 
movie man who does not have to be convinced that the Audex system has increased 
his audience size. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt very much that there's ever a day that goes by that we don't check 
them out," Singleton says. "On certain days we'll check out anywhere from five 
to 15 a day. When it's busy we check out more of them." 
</P>
<P>
And his patrons are "very excited" about the chance to see a first-run movie 
when it comes out -- instead of waiting 6 months to get a close-captioned video 
for the VCR. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't look funny wearing them," Singleton says. "They're like wearing a 
Walkman -- a small set of headphones and a small receiver. And it sounds 
great."

Chinese authorities today announced the first arrests connected with 
anti-government protests in Beijing as up to 100,000 people crowded the city 
center to see a 33-foot Statue of Liberty replica put up by defiant students. 
</P>
<P>
On the 10th day of martial law, the official New China News Agency said that 
demonstrating motorbike riders had been arrested for disturbing public order 
and that 11 people were in custody while further investigations were carried 
out. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known if the 11 included three leaders of a new, illegal trade union 
organization that backs the students. Hundreds of workers and students camped 
outside the police station demanding information about the three. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Convoys of Motorbikes 
</P>
<P>
Convoys of motorbike riders scorched through Beijing at the height of 
pro-democracy demonstrations earlier this month when a student hunger strike 
sparked the biggest protests against the government since the Communists took 
power in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted a leader of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau 
as saying the riders had distributed leaflets, spread poisonous rumors, incited 
workers to strike and prevented military vehicles from entering Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people crowded the center of Beijing meanwhile to see the 
Statue of Liberty replica that defiant students unveiled in Tian An Men Square, 
the symbolic heart of Chinese communism. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses estimated that by mid-evening up to 100,000 people had poured into 
the square in a dramatic resurgence of popular interest in the democracy 
protests that had lost support on the streets after fears of a government 
crackdown. The numbers fell back to about 20,000 by midnight, the witnesses 
said. 
</P>
<P>
State television quoted officials as saying the "Goddess of Democracy" statue, 
made of polystyrene and plaster, had been erected illegally and was a 
"humiliation of the Chinese nation in such a solemn place." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'This Is China, Not America' 
</P>
<P>
It quoted a letter from an unnamed official demanding immediate action to stop 
the erection of the statue and said: "This is China, not America." 
</P>
<P>
People pressed around the replica taking photographs.

TRANSIENT, 42, ADMITS SETTING FIRE AT PAN PACIFIC, CITY OFFICIALS SAY

<P>
A man who was arrested Sunday has confessed to setting the fire that gutted the 
historic Pan Pacific Auditorium last week, city officials announced today. 
</P>
<P>
But Fire Chief Donald Manning and Mayor Tom Bradley said the man, whose name 
they would not reveal, may be released if they cannot gather enough evidence by 
this evening to persuade the district attorney's office to file charges. 
</P>
<P>
Manning described the suspect as a 42-year-old transient who had been living 
out of his car. 
</P>
<P>
Two security guards saw the man loitering around the auditorium before the 
$3-million blaze that erupted last Wednesday night in the vacant structure on 
Beverly Boulevard. The man was arrested outside the building, Manning said.

BUSH EXULTS IN 'DOUBLE-HIT' SUCCESS AS NATO TALKS END; 
</P>
<P>
HE CALLS ARMS PLAN 'A VICTORY'

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush exulted today over what he called the "double-hit" success of a 
NATO summit that produced a united Western front on both conventional and 
nuclear weapons and smoothed over a dispute with West Germany in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Bush flew to Bonn from Brussels, where the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization had just forged a compromise on short-range nuclear missiles. The 
deal will keep some of the NATO weapons deployed indefinitely while providing a 
framework for eventual negotiations with the Soviets to reduce the stockpiles 
once conventional weapons in Europe are cut. 
</P>
<P>
Bush met one-on-one in Bonn with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who called 
the President "a friend among friends." Bush said he was "very pleased with the 
reaction to the NATO decision." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Triumphant Mood 
</P>
<P>
In a triumphant mood, Bush said the alliance had scored a "double hit" with its 
decision on the nuclear issue and its endorsement of his proposal for 
widespread reductions in troops and conventional weapons based in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The communique winding up the 40th anniversary summit meeting specified that 
only a "partial reduction" in battlefield nuclear weapons would be pursued. 
</P>
<P>
That was a setback for Kohl, who had sought swift U.S.-Soviet negotiations with 
the possible aim of eliminating short-range nuclear missiles both in NATO and 
the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no third zero," Bush said in a reference to arms control jargon 
for scrapping the missiles. "Partial means partial." 
</P>
<P>
The two other "zeroes" were in the 1987 U.S.-Soviet treaty banning two 
categories of intermediate-range missiles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
West Germany's Gains 
</P>
<P>
But despite the tilt toward the U.S. position, Kohl did not leave the summit 
empty-handed. On a related issue, Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher agreed to postpone modernization of the U.S.-built Lance launchers 
that are deployed mostly in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, discussing the compromise at a news conference, said: "I don't view it as 
a victory for the United States. I view it as a victory for the alliance." 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Thatcher had wanted to more than triple the range of the Lances, but 
at West Germany's urging the allies decided to postpone any modernization until 
1992. At that point, the communique said, "the introduction and deployment of a 
follow-on system for the Lance will be dealt with . . . in the light of overall 
security developments." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Package Deal' 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference later today, Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
cautioned the Soviet Union that the NATO proposals were a "package deal." 
</P>
<P>
"This is not something we have put on the table, the idea that the East can 
come in and pick what they like and leave what they don't like." 
</P>
<P>
The NATO leaders also gave a green light to the U.S. Congress to finance the 
development of a more powerful short-range missile in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl, under intense disarmament pressure at home, praised the United States for 
breaking the impasse over when and whether to negotiate cuts in the short-range 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"I now see a historic chance for realistic and significant arms control 
progress," Kohl said. "We are ready to make use of this chance."

Ariel Mayor Ron Nachmann said the Palestinians will undergo a daily security

A Woodland Hills man was arrested on suspicion of murder after he allegedly 
caused a fatal accident while driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol, 
El Monte police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Tobar, 25, was being held without bail at the El Monte jail. Detective 
Richard Williams said Tobar was driving eastbound through El Monte on Garvey 
Avenue at 9 p.m. Monday when he used a parking lane to speed around several 
cars stopped at the intersection of Central Avenue. As Tobar tried to drive 
through the intersection at 60 m.p.h. he crashed into a car driven by Lorenza 
Bernal, 36, of Asuza, who was turning onto Garvey Avenue, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
A passenger in Bernal's car, Hermanino Correa, 30, of El Monte, was killed by 
the impact of the collision. Police said Bernal, Tobar and Tobar's passenger, 
Carlos Hernandez, 25, of La Puente, all suffered minor injuries.

Barbara Bush, visiting the world's oldest Roman Catholic university, admitted 
she was a "terrible student." 
</P>
<P>
While her husband and other NATO leaders were debating world issues Monday, the 
First Lady toured the central library of the Catholic University of Leuven, 
founded in 1425. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a terrible student. I was what they call a late bloomer," she told 
reporters after receiving a bound volume of the history of the city from Mayor 
Alfred Vansina. 
</P>
<P>
The library, burned down by the Germans in World War I, was rebuilt with money 
from U.S. schools and universities. The United States also gave money when the 
library was gutted in a fire during World War II.

U.S. SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS BAN ON PRAYERS AT SCHOOL FOOTBALL GAMES 
</P>

<P>
The Supreme Court today let stand a decision banning organized prayers at the 
start of high school football games. 
</P>
<P>
The court, without comment, refused to review a ruling in a Georgia case that 
such pregame invocations impermissibly promote religion. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, by a 2-1 vote Jan. 3, said prayers 
carried over the public address system before Douglas County, Ga., High School 
home football games had to stop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Separation of Church, State 
</P>
<P>
In a ruling affecting all public schools in Georgia, Alabama and Florida, the 
appeals court said the organized prayers violated the separation of church and 
state required by past Supreme Court decisions. 
</P>
<P>
But lawyers for the Douglas County school board told the justices that pregame 
prayers have become "as much a part of the tradition of high school football as 
the national anthem, marching bands, cheerleaders and baton twirlers." 
</P>
<P>
The school board's lawyers noted that the Rev. Billy Graham delivered a prayer 
and benediction at President Bush's inauguration in January and that each 
Supreme Court session begins with an invocation for divine assistance: "God 
save the United States and this honorable court." 
</P>
<P>
The appeal acted on today argued that the Douglas County football invocations 
should be reinstated on the same "traditional" grounds used by the justices 
when in 1983 they upheld the practice of opening state legislative sessions 
with prayers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Argument Rejected 
</P>
<P>
The 11th Circuit court rejected that argument. Noting that although state 
legislatures have conducted prayer sessions for more than 200 years, the 
appeals court said, "Invocations at school-sponsored football games were 
nonexistent when the Constitution was adopted." 
</P>
<P>
In another case today, the justices barred divorced spouses of military 
veterans from sharing in retirement pay the veterans have converted into 
disability benefits. 
</P>
<P>
In a 7-2 ruling in a California case, the justices said a 1982 federal law does 
not permit state court divorce decrees to divide the disability benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the court, said, "We realize that 
reading the statute literally may inflict economic harm on many former spouses. 
But we decline to misread the statute in order to reach a sympathetic result 
when such a reading requires us to do violence to the plain language of the 
statute and ignore much of the legislative history." 
</P>
<P>
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in a dissenting opinion, said, "The harsh reality 
of this holding is that former spouses . . . can, without their consent, be 
denied a fair share of their ex-spouse's military pension simply because he 
elects to increase his after-tax income by converting a portion of that pension 
into disability benefits." 
</P>
<P>
In other action today, the Supreme Court: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Refused to lift strict advertising limits imposed on a Texas counseling 
center that authorities called a "fake abortion clinic" run by anti-abortion 
activists. The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that ads run by the 
Problem Pregnancy Center in Ft. Worth violated a state law banning deceptive 
trade practices. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Set aside a $157,500 award won by the mother of a Los Angeles County man 
who committed suicide in jail. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, by a 7-2 vote, told a federal appeals court to restudy its ruling 
that the inmate's rights were violated because he was not given adequate 
psychiatric care. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Refused to reinstate the conviction of a California man, Stephen Edward 
Leichty, who admitted he tried to illegally ship a drug via air freight. 
Without comment, the court left intact a ruling that police unlawfully searched 
the shipment without a court-issued search warrant.

Villagers demanding that a U.S. Air Force bombing range be closed scaled fences 
and stormed the range, injuring 10 airmen, military officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 farmers and villagers attacked the Kooni range about 70 miles 
southwest of Seoul on Monday night, said Sgt. Will Baker, an Air Force 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters assaulted military guards with clubs and rocks, slightly 
injuring the airmen, he said. A Korean civilian worker was also beaten. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retreat to Dormitory 
</P>
<P>
Baker said Air Force personnel retreated to a dormitory after one attacker 
pulled out a knife. The villagers then hurled rocks through windows, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters also damaged 22 military vehicles and looted and ransacked 
administrative buildings. 
</P>
<P>
About 450 South Korean riot police arrived about two hours after the attack 
began and drove the protesters out. Twenty villagers were arrested, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The attack came after villagers were stopped for safety reasons from working in 
fields on the edge of the range during a bombing practice, officials said. 
Farmers are allowed to use government land around the range.

Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter warned today against over-reacting to 
southern Iowa's drought, but said he understands the long-range problems caused 
by "a very strange" weather pattern this year. 
</P>
<P>
The National Guard has hauled 300,000 gallons of drinking water to several 
parched southern Iowa towns and "we don't see an end to it," National Guard 
Adjutant Tommy Thompson told Yeutter. 
</P>
<P>
In some sections of the state, wells must be drilled to 2,500 feet before 
reaching water. 
</P>
<P>
Yeutter was briefed by state officials and Iowa's congressional delegation 
during a tour of several southern Iowa towns and farms.

HONG KONG MOVES 350 REFUGEES TO ISLAND;

Hong Kong, saying its resources for housing Vietnamese boat people have been 
overwhelmed, today moved 350 men, women and children to an island with only 
basic rations and no shelter. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese, the latest of the 2,300 boat people who have arrived in the 
British colony over the last three days, were taken by police launch and left 
under guard on Tai A Chau, the main island in the Soko group. 
</P>
<P>
"They will be provided with food and water, but we are not able to provide them 
with shelter," said government refugee coordinator Mike Hanson. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply have no accommodation left. I think it is important that people in 
the camps and in the northern part of Vietnam understand that we have no 
accommodation for boat people," Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson added that any new arrivals will be towed out to the Sokos if their 
boats are seaworthy but will have the option of continuing their voyage if they 
wish. 
</P>
<P>
The Sokos, among Hong Kong's 236 islands, are inhabited by only one elderly 
Chinese couple. There is no running water and there are no facilities except 
for a run-down former school. 
</P>
<P>
There are now nearly 38,000 Vietnamese boat people jammed into Hong Kong's 
camps, prisons and detention centers. 
</P>
<P>
About 24,000 of them, who arrived after the British colony introduced a tough 
new screening policy last year, are regarded as illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
They are being held pending repatriation unless they can prove that they are 
genuine refugees under U.N. criteria and not just economic migrants.

1 IN 10 BAY AREA HOUSEHOLDS CAN AFFORD A HOUSE

<P>
Only one in 10 households in the San Francisco Bay Area could afford a 
median-priced, single-family detached home in April, the lowest figure since 
records started being kept and the worst in the state, the California Assn. of 
Realtors reported today. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for a mortgage loan on a median-priced home of $261,520 in April, a 
Bay Area household needed a minimum annual income of $85,904 and faced monthly 
payments of $2,148, assuming a 20% down payment, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco's affordability index was down slightly from March, when 11% of 
households could afford a median-priced home of $249,508. In April, 1988, 22% 
of local households could afford a median-priced home, then $195,598. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Market ... Crippled' 
</P>
<P>
The area's housing crunch mirrors an affordability drop statewide. For the 
state as a whole, only 17% of households could afford a median-priced home of 
$200,784 in April, down from 18% in March. 
</P>
<P>
"The entry-level homeownership market has been crippled by more than a year of 
escalating home prices and six months of rising mortgage interest rates," said 
Joel Singer, the association's chief economist. 
</P>
<P>
Following close behind San Francisco as a house-hunter's nightmare was the 
Ventura area, where only 11% of households could afford the median-priced home 
of $249,847. In Los Angeles and Orange counties, just 14% of households earned 
enough to qualify for a median-priced home of $215,871 and $243,485, 
respectively.

Avon Products Inc. today snubbed a merger overture by Mary Kay Cosmetics Inc., 
a rival door-to-door cosmetics company, with Avon's chairman -- in a now 
familiar refrain -- stating the company is not for sale. 
</P>
<P>
"We see no advantage to combining our operations through some form of leveraged 
buyout or other arrangement," Avon Chairman James E. Preston said in a letter 
to Mary Kay's vice chairman, John Rochon. 
</P>
<P>
Rochon wrote to Avon last week on behalf of an investment group expressing an 
interest in acquiring Avon, although a price was not named. 
</P>
<P>
"Avon's board has said that the company is not for sale and that this would be 
the worst time to sell -- just when Avon is in a strong turnaround," Preston 
said in the letter released by Avon. 
</P>
<P>
Senior managers of Avon, which rejected a $2.1-billion proposal from Amway 
Corp. two weeks ago, unveiled a plan May 19 to boost earnings per share by 20% 
a year over the next few years.

INTEREST HIKE FAILS TO STEM DECLINE OF YEN; 
</P>
<P>
DOLLAR GAINS IN WAKE OF MOVE BY BANK OF JAPAN

<P>
The Bank of Japan today raised its central discount rate by 0.75% to 3.25%. It 
was the first such increase in nine years and signaled the end of an era of 
super-low interest rates but not the end of the dollar's rise against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
For the second straight trading day after word of the rate increase was leaked 
to the Japanese press Friday, the dollar moved up today on the Tokyo Foreign 
Exchange Market, gaining 0.22 yen to close at 143.10. On Monday, the dollar had 
gained 2.48 points, or nearly 2%. 
</P>
<P>
Satoshi Sumita, governor of the central bank, described the interest rate 
increase as a move designed to nip inflation in the bud. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lowest Ever in Japan 
</P>
<P>
Since February, 1987, the central discount rate, which the bank charges on 
loans to commercial banks, had been 2.5%, the lowest ever in Japan and the 
lowest among advanced Western nations. 
</P>
<P>
Increases in the relative value of the dollar have forced Japanese to pay more 
in yen for imports, driving up prices of oil and other imports in recent 
months, Sumita noted. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama said the central bank was following a trend in 
the market where rates have been rising. He insisted that the measure "will 
continue the maintenance of domestic-led growth . . . in line with the tenor of 
international coordination" and Japan's promises to spur imports and reduce its 
trade surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
Higher interest rates usually dampen growth, but Sumita said personal 
consumption and equipment investment were strong enough so that "if price 
stability is preserved, economic growth will continue." 
</P>
<P>
He said the central bank will start checking commercial banks' loan plans in 
order to prevent excessive lending of the sort that has contributed to an 
explosion of land and stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
Business leaders were divided in their reaction. Eishiro Saito, chairman of the 
Federation of Economic Organizations, said, "Economic conditions are 
extraordinarily smooth. There was no need to change policy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Overdue 
</P>
<P>
But Takashi Ishihara, head of the Japan Assn. of Business Executives, said the 
move was overdue. 
</P>
<P>
The action came after wholesale prices for the first 10 days of May rose 3.1% 
compared with the same period last year. Prices had risen 2.5% in April, and 
the 10-day May increase was the largest since January, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The central bank said the erosion of the yen's value had pushed up import 
prices in yen by 8.8%, compared with the same period last year. Sumita also 
complained that price stability was being threatened by a tightening supply of 
labor.

Broncos Coach Dan Reeves has received a four-year extension on his contract 
that will carry him through the 1992 season, owner Pat Bowlen announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the contract were not disclosed, but sources said Reeves will be paid 
$785,000 annually, making him one of the five or six highest-paid coaches in 
the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm one of the top five or six coaches in the league, and I think this 
contract is in line with that," Reeves said at a press conference. "I wasn't 
looking for the biggest salary in the league; I didn't think I deserved that. 
But I felt I was one of the top coaches in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
Reeves, 45, is entering his ninth season as head coach of the Broncos, during 
which he has compiled a 74-45-1 record, including back-to-back Super Bowl 
appearances after the 1986 and 1987 seasons. The Denver team slipped to 8-8 
last season.

South African heavyweight champion Pierre Coetzer knocked American 
cruiserweight Mike Greer down twice, then stopped him in the sixth round of a 
scheduled 10-round bout Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Greer, of Memphis, Tenn., was booed by the crowd from the outset as he went 
straight into clinches and held on, hardly throwing a punch. Greer, ranked 
fourth by the International Boxing Federation, fifth by the World Boxing 
Council and sixth by the World Boxing Assn., was the highest-rated opponent 
Coetzer has faced in his bid for a chance at the world heavyweight title. 
Coetzer improved his record to 26-2.
