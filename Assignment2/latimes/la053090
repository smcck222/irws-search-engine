S.D. SCHOOLS CHIEF WINS PRAISE, 54.5% SALARY HIKE 
</P>

City schools Supt. Tom Payzant received an "outstanding" mark on his 1989-90 
evaluation Tuesday and was rewarded by school trustees with a contract 
extension and a four-year 54.5% salary increase to $170,000 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Payzant's contract was extended from Oct. 31, 1992, until June 30, 1994, and 
his present salary of $110,000 will be boosted by $15,000 annually beginning 
July 1, until it reaches $170,000 on July 1, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The board also enhanced Payzant's car allowance of $9,600 a year with a 5% 
annual increase and his $7,000 annual expense account with a $500 yearly boost. 
His current life and disability insurance policies continue without change. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the generous enhancements, school board President Kay Davis said 
that the action of trustees stemmed from Payzant's consideration in March by 
Miami-Dade County, Fla., for that district's top post. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of Payzant's departure upset the board at a time when San Diego 
-- the nation's eighth-largest urban district -- has a host of innovative 
educational reforms in the experimental stage. Payzant, 50, has been San Diego 
superintendent since November, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"We realized how important it is to keep him in San Diego," Davis said, citing 
the challenge of making the district's ongoing restructuring program work. 
</P>
<P>
That effort is intended to give teachers and principals more responsibility to 
decide on curriculum and on ways of improving student performance. The board 
credits Payzant with laying the foundation for the program when he negotiated a 
four-year labor contract with teachers in the fall of 1988 that includes joint 
efforts for speeding reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"An urban superintendency is one of the most challenging jobs in America," 
Davis, an eight-year veteran trustee, said in speaking for the five-member 
board. "And despite changes we have had on the board, we have always been 
candid in (discussing) with Tom the struggles that we face and the ways we want 
to tackle problems . . . someone like Tom is what we want in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, conscious of the size of the salary boost in light of an anticipated 
tight budget for fiscal year 1990-91 and possible program cuts, released 
information showing that Payzant now is only the third-highest paid 
superintendent in the county despite the district's 120,000 students. The 
superintendent of the 27,000-student Sweetwater high school district in South 
Bay makes $116,000 and the head of Poway's Unified School District, with 23,000 
students, makes $111,000. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, Payzant is the 10th highest paid superintendent among the nation's 
largest 15 school districts, data from the board shows. Under his former 
contract, Payzant's salary would have risen to a maximum $129,000 in November, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
A Times survey in 1988 showed that Payzant was the fourth highest paid public 
official in the county. 
</P>
<P>
While educators in San Diego have said that Payzant is underpaid, the timing of 
the raise may cause public relations problems. Gov. George Deukmejian has 
proposed that automatic cost-of-living salary adjustments (COLAs) in the state 
budget for 1990-91 be smaller than allowed for under inflation. Salary 
increases for San Diego teachers are tied to the final state budget COLA. 
</P>
<P>
The move to boost Payzant's salary came after the board determined that an 
earlier plan, triggered by the Miami recruitment, to set up a tax-deferred 
retirement plan for him could not be done. Because Payzant had moved from job 
to job frequently during his career before coming to San Diego in 1982, he does 
not have strong existing pension benefits and the board intended to give him a 
lump sum of several hundred thousand dollars to invest for use after 
retirement, when he would then pay taxes on it. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis told The Times that 1986 changes in federal tax laws meant that the 
board could not give a public employee a new tax-shelter annuity plan. "So we 
decided to give (Payzant) a raise and bring up his allowances," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In calling his overall performance "outstanding," the board praised Payzant for 
increasing parent involvement with schools, for drawing up a proposal to 
improve black and Latino student achievement, and for success in gaining 
federal and private foundation grants for the district through his many 
contacts resulting from memberships on numerous national educational policy 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
But trustees called on Payzant to work on improvements in several areas. Among 
them: 
</P>
<P>
* Improve collaboration further with teachers and other employee groups to 
avoid acrimony otherwise possible during 1992 contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
* Draw up a plan for gradual funding increases for the district's maintenance 
program, which has come under harsh criticism this year for letting a majority 
of the district's 170 school sites deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
* Target dropout prevention at the eighth grade next year and put a pilot 
program into effect to reduce the adult-child ratio in elementary school 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
* Consider a "newcomers program" to allow the district to cope better with an 
increasing influx of foreign students, mostly Latino, who come as teen-agers 
without knowing English or having schooling even in their native countries. 
</P>
<P>
* Get more teeth into the way teachers and principals are evaluated as a way of 
improving accountability of educators for boosting student achievement. In 
return, individual schools would get more power in determining how they 
operate. 
</P>
<P>
Payzant said later that he was "very pleased, obviously," with the salary 
increase and the contract extension, adding that he has a "gentleman's 
agreement" with the board not to seek another position for at least two years. 
Payzant said he was surprised to learn only last month that he was not the 
highest paid school official in San Diego County, explaining that smaller 
suburban districts across the country often have been able to offer higher 
salaries during the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
He said that after 21 years of working with various boards of education, "there 
is always room for improvement and I'm willing to receive recommendations for 
doing so." 
</P>
<P>
As evidence of his willingness, Payzant pointed to the new list of two-year 
district goals and objectives presented to the board Tuesday for approval on 
June 19 after review and comment by principals, teachers and parents. 
</P>
<P>
The two major goals, the outlines of which trustees discussed at a special 
retreat last month, call for: 
</P>
<P>
* Improving standardized test scores at all schools where the scores are below 
state averages in reading, direct writing, and mathematics. By June, 1992, a 
school will be asked to reduce the gap by one-half between scores of its 
students and the overall district test averages, which are higher than those of 
the state. The goal will use the California Achievement Program tests (CAP) 
because those state tests measure a student's ability to reason and manipulate 
skills better than other tests which emphasize more the recitation of basic 
skills, Payzant said. 
</P>
<P>
* Reducing the dropout rate by June 1991 by 10% at all schools with grades 9-12 
compared to the previous year. Schools with grades kindergarten-through-eighth 
grade will be asked to aim for a 15% decrease. And the district's numerous 
dropout recovery programs will be asked for a 16% cumulative gain in the number 
of dropouts returned to district schools.

AMERICA'S CUP PANEL FAILS, FOR NOW, TO GET $10 MILLION FROM PORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Unified Port District agreed "in concept" Tuesday to enter into a 
three-year "public-private partnership" with the America's Cup Organizing 
Committee but stopped short of giving the sponsors of the international sailing 
regatta any of the $10 million in public money they say they need. 
</P>
<P>
Milford Portwood, chairman of the Board of Port Commissioners, opened the 
meeting by pointing to the America's Cup trophy and saying to Malin Burnham, 
president of the organizing committee: "Mr. Burnham, we at the port appreciate 
your turning the Cup over to us." 
</P>
<P>
Burnham's immediate retort was: "There's a price to be paid." 
</P>
<P>
Burnham and three other speakers took turns extolling the benefits that three 
years of preparing for and staging the event will mean to the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham said the regatta would bring the city $43 million "in tax revenue 
alone" and that the port would make $90 for every $1 it spends in funding the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
An economist from the University of San Diego estimated the countywide economic 
impact as $911 million, which Burnham said would not be realized without the 
best effort possible. 
</P>
<P>
"The finals of this race are in May of 1992, and I submit to you that after 
that time, this community will never again be the same," Burnham said. "We can 
make it work for us, or we can fall flat on our face." 
</P>
<P>
Burnham said the $10 million needed from the port will go toward a media center 
(to accommodate 4,000 journalists), an international broadcast center, race 
headquarters, an America's Cup village (for shoreside viewing) and an America's 
Cup museum. He said part of the $10 million will go toward youth educational 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
But the item that seemed to surprise and confound some of the commissioners was 
Burnham's request for another $5 million to refurbish and develop the 10th 
Avenue Terminal -- if needed -- for three to five racing syndicates that 
private boatyards may be unable to accommodate. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, members of the organizing committee had said private shipyards and 
marinas could probably accommodate all teams entered in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham said that 20 international challengers from 15 countries and 10 
American defenders had entered the competition. Eight of those teams have never 
before sailed in America's Cup events. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wonderful to see all this enthusiasm," said Commissioner Lynn Schenk. 
"But we have to set enthusiasm aside. We have to set boosterism aside. I read 
somewhere that a member of the organizing committee said Port money was 
'quasi-public money.' I suppose he said that because it isn't tax money, but it 
is public money. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to look at this thing in a hard, businesslike way and ask a lot of 
questions about how the money's being spent." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize when I was cheering you on the past two years," Commissioner 
Delton Reopelle said to Burnham at one point, "that you'd then turn around and 
dig so deeply into our pockets." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Mitchell, a spokesman for the organizing committee, said the sponsors need 
$10 million from the port "to do the job correctly, but when we sit down with 
the commissioners and the port (staff), we may find the figure going up or 
down. Maybe the port will want to spend more than the $10 million we're asking 
for. Our budget is very, very fluid, simply because it has to be. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't like a Super Bowl, where you have a set number of teams and 
players, and that's that. At this point, we can't just establish a firm figure 
for what race preparations will cost." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why corporate or private donors couldn't come up with the $10 million, 
Burnham said he preferred to use the money from "the Coca-Colas and Marlboros 
of the world" to fund the syndicates attempting to defend the Cup for the San 
Diego Yacht Club. 
</P>
<P>
"My No. 1 priority is a successful defense of the Cup," Burnham said. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham said the America's Cup will be of paramount value to San Diego in 
making the city known to the rest of the world. He compared its impact to that 
of two other international sporting spectacles, the World Cup soccer 
competition and the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
He said the America's Cup would have "no less an impact on San Diego" than the 
1984 Olympics did on Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Portwood seemed to agree, saying, "This is the kind of publicity 
this community just can't buy. The benefit will be great and far-reaching, so 
much so it's difficult to quantify. 
</P>
<P>
"If we tried to match this event by promoting the port on our own, I don't 
think we could do it for $100 million, let alone $10 million." 
</P>
<P>
Port District Director Don Nay said recently that, although port revenues now 
exceed expenditures by more than $40 million a year, making the port a target 
for groups needy of public money, the port faces litigation from several groups 
that may end up in losses of several million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Nay alluded to a $200-million complaint by homeowners in Point Loma upset over 
airport noise and to ridding San Diego Bay of toxic pollution, which may cost 
$100 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure people will turn to us," Nay said in a recent interview, "but we have 
many more demands than resources." 
</P>
<P>
But Burnham, who Tuesday enlisted the president of City College and an outgoing 
Australian to extol the benefits of regattas, said cleaning up the bay could be 
just "one of the many benefits" the race brings to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"We can also spotlight the 500th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of America 
(in 1992) and San Diego's significance to the Pacific Rim," he said. "But time 
is precious, and whatever time we lose today can't be made up in the future."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: GINGER BROWN CASE BECOMING A CULT FAVORITE IN THE COURTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just what the Ginger Brown deprogramming case needs: Another trip to the 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, a jury in Vista acquitted Brown's mother and father and three 
co-defendants of false imprisonment and battery. 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, the judge dismissed the kidnaping charges, saying the whole mess was 
a family feud that should never have come to trial. 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, yes, Brown dropped her $2.75-million civil suit against her heartsick 
parents for trying to force her to forsake the religious group Great Among the 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
But now the case has spawned yet more legal action. 
</P>
<P>
Nan Erler, whose rural Escondido home was used for Brown's unsuccessful 
deprogramming, has filed a $500,000 civil suit against the tabloid television 
show "Inside Edition" and Graciella Guzman Altschul, wife of Great Among the 
Nations leader Benjamin Altschul. 
</P>
<P>
Erler says Mrs. Altschul and an "Inside Edition" camera crew scared the 
bejabbers out of her by coming to her door unannounced on Jan. 18, just five 
days after the end of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Erler, 59, says that when she looked up and saw Mrs. Altschul and several 
strange men peering in her front window, she immediately figured they were 
hellbent on revenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the cult was coming to get us," Erler said. "I saw Altschul standing 
by a strange van in my driveway, and I knew Great Among the Nations always 
travels in vans. I was scared." 
</P>
<P>
She says it was several hours before the mix-up was straightened out. Even 
then, she had to see a doctor for nerves and high-revving blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"It was horrendous," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Inside Edition," a syndicated show based in New York, says its crew mistakenly 
thought Erler's house was empty -- an explanation that Erler does not buy. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking into the matter," said "Inside" publicist Marcy Baron. 
</P>
<P>
One final question: Is Erler ready for a prolonged fight, with First Amendment 
overtones? 
</P>
<P>
"It's not something I'm looking forward to," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adding Weight to His Words 
</P>
<P>
Show and tell. 
</P>

<P>
He's only dragging a 24,965-page, nine-foot-tall transcript of the four-year 
Los Angeles "Nightstalker" trial to press conferences around the state. 
</P>
<P>
* Workers for Assistant Sheriff Jack Drown are leaving nothing to chance. 
</P>
<P>
One of them left a Drown-for-sheriff pitch on the answering machine of a home 
in Carlsbad. It was the home of Drown rival Vince Jimno. 
</P>
<P>
Jimno heard it after a long day of campaigning: "I took my tie off and laughed 
like hell." 
</P>
<P>
* Workers for John de Beck, a business education teacher running for San Diego 
school board, are asking his fellow teachers to put campaign signs on their 
lawns. 
</P>
<P>
One called Terri Harvey, a sixth-grade teacher at Grant Elementary School in 
Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry. She's backing another candidate: her husband, Scott, a governmental

CANDIDATE GETS CAMPAIGN HELP HE DOESN'T WANT; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: DEVELOPER PERSISTS IN RUNNING SEPARATE CAMPAIGN FOR COWAN DESPITE THE 
ESCONDIDO COUNCILMAN'S THREAT TO WITHDRAW BACKING FOR A LARGE HOUSING PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Shea Homes, partner in a 3,000-acre Escondido residential development, has 
spent about $24,000 in an independent campaign to get Escondido Councilman 
Ernie Cowan reelected June 5. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan, a supporter of the Daley Ranch development in northeastern Escondido, 
said he wants no part of Shea's help and has asked Shea President Tom Noon to 
halt his campaigning. Noon has refused, Cowan said. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know about it, I don't want it, I had no part in it and I'm trying to 
stop it," Cowan said Tuesday about the Shea Homes campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the old good-news, bad-news political joke," Cowan said. "The good news 
is that I received an endorsement. The bad news is that it was from Attila the 
Hun." 
</P>
<P>
Cowan said that he "would have put a stop to this long before if I had known 
about it," and threatened to withdraw his support of the massive Shea housing 
project if Shea does not stop its campaigning efforts on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Shea Homes, a subsidiary of the J.F. Shea Co., builder of the Golden Gate 
Bridge and Hoover Dam, filed a report on its independent campaign with the city 
clerk's office last week, detailing expenditures of about $24,000 including 
$14,000 on a pro-Cowan telephone campaign and $7,000 on a poll. 
</P>
<P>
June Rady, chairwoman of the Escondido Planning Commission and a candidate for 
Cowan's council seat, said she was "angered and appalled" at the magnitude of 
Shea's support of her opponent. The firm's spending for Cowan is nearly equal 
to the combined spending reported by Rady ($10,200) and a third council 
candidate, Sid Hollins, an elementary school board trustee, who spent $15,200. 
Cowan's campaign has spent about $33,000. 
</P>
<P>
One day before the deadline for filing for city office, Rady said she was asked 
Noon and political consultant Lynn Wessell to run for mayor against slow-growth 
Councilman Jerry Harmon. 
</P>
<P>
"They showed me the poll they had done," Rady said. "It had a number of 
scenarios and one was that if I opposed Ernie (Cowan), he would win, but that I 
could beat Jerry Harmon (for mayor). There was an inference that there would be 
support for me if I ran for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"I refused because I do not feel prepared to take on the duties of running a 
council in a city of this size," Rady said. "I am qualified to perform the 
duties of a city councilman." 
</P>
<P>
After she turned down offer, she said, "I just got up and walked away." 
</P>
<P>
Cowan said he also received a pitch from Shea officials to run against Harmon 
in the mayoral race. He also refused. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me that their polls showed I would be a strong candidate for mayor," 
Cowan said, "but I've already been mayor (under former procedures when council 
members appointed the mayor) and I didn't want to take it on again," Cowan 
said. "I also didn't want to be a minority mayor." 
</P>
<P>
Cowan and outgoing Mayor Doris Thurston, who is not seeking reelection, have 
been a minority voting bloc on the council since the June, 1988, when voters 
returned Harmon and slow-growth newcomers Carla DeDominicis and Kris Murphy 
over pro-growth incumbent Doug Best and nine other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Best, the lone Harmon challenger in this first citywide mayoral race, admits 
that Shea support "may have just shot Ernie in the foot." 
</P>
<P>
He said he was surprised that Shea disclosed its support of Cowan right before 
the June 5 election and "would have supported him to that extent." 
</P>
<P>
Best, who served 12 years on the council before his defeat in 1988, was a 
planning commissioner's when the city's General Plan was created in the early 
1970s. The plan called for an ultimate city population of about 300,000 and 
allotted 3,200 homes to the Daley Ranch property. 
</P>
<P>
Since the slow-growth majority has held power, the city's General Plan has been 
revised to cut the ultimate Escondido population to half of the original plan. 
Daley Ranch's 3,200-home allotment was halved to 1,700 homes under the new 
General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Murphy questioned whether Shea Homes and Cowan were working 
independently of each other in Cowan's reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be hard to prove that Ernie, by accepting polling information from 
Shea, received an illegal campaign contribution," Murphy said. "But this 
certainly proves that he is in the pocket of the developers, something that 
most of us have known for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Harmon also questioned the relationship between Shea officials and Cowan's 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I have thought all along there were shenanigans going on, that communications 
were taking place between Cowan and his campaign staff and Shea Homes and Lynn 
Wessell (the political consultant for Shea). 
</P>
<P>
"Ernie made a telltale comment sometime before Christmas that he would base his 
decision on whether to run on a survey being done. Now it has become clear that 
the survey was being paid for by Shea Homes," Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Michioku, spokeswoman for the state Fair Political Practices Commission, 
said that there are no provisions in the California Political Reform Act that 
restrict an independent that expenditures be reported and that the campaign be 
neither used nor influenced by the candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be other state laws which pertain to this situation but I can 
address only the Political Reform Act," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Shea Homes and Daley Corp., partners in the Daley Ranch project, have filed 
suit against the city and the three slow-growth council members -- Harmon, 
DeDominicis and Murphy -- asking the court to restore the original development 
density allotted to the property and seeking damages, including $40 million

<P>
PATAGONIA TO LEAVE VANDERKOLK OUT OF ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Patagonia Inc. announced Tuesday that it will not mention county supervisorial 
candidate Maria VanderKolk in $9,000 worth of pre-election newspaper 
advertisements because it fears a county investigation into the legality of the 
ads could hurt her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office confirmed that it began an inquiry Friday into a 
complaint by VanderKolk's opponent, Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer, who alleges 
that Patagonia's ads endorsing VanderKolk would violate a state law that 
generally limits corporate donations to a candidate to $1,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Sweeney, Patagonia's public affairs director, said in an interview that 
the ads would have been legal, but that they might have generated bad press for 
VanderKolk. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize that in politics perception is reality," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia, a politically active Ventura clothing company, pledged last week to 
spend $9,000 on a series of ads backing two slow-growth candidates -- 
VanderKolk in the 2nd District and Glen Schmidt in the 4th District -- for 
seats on the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer immediately claimed that the ads would be illegal, citing a state law 
that places a $1,000 limit on ads that support a candidate if they are placed 
after consulting with the candidate or in coordination with the overall 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer argued that because Sweeney admits to having acted as a strategist for 
the VanderKolk campaign, he could not legitimately claim that his company's ads 
are independent of that campaign. 
</P>
<P>
There is no legal monetary limit on ads placed independently of a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer confirmed Tuesday that her attorney, Vigo G. Nielsen Jr. of Mill 
Valley, sent a letter of complaint to Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to take away anybody's right of free speech, but I play by the 
rules," Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
The letter by her attorney requested that Bradbury ask Patagonia not to run the 
ads, and threatened to go to court to block their publication if it would not 
withdraw them. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer's attorney argued that Sweeney, who has insisted that Patagonia's ads 
have nothing to do with his advice to VanderKolk on his own time, does not 
understand the law. 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia "simply cannot legally pay any amount for that support of VanderKolk 
after it has become knowledgeable about the needs of the VanderKolk campaign 
through its officer's volunteer services as a VanderKolk strategist," Vigo said 
in his letter to Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
Special Assistant Dist. Atty. Donald D. Coleman said his office called Sweeney 
on Friday and again Tuesday to question him about his involvement in the 
VanderKolk campaign. An investigator also called VanderKolk. 
</P>
<P>
"I've committed to a factual inquiry to find out what occurred because it's a 
matter of statewide interest," Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
The issue raised by Schaefer is significant, the prosecutor said, because the 
campaign this spring is one of the first to test the provisions of Proposition 
73, a 1988 ballot initiative that for the first time limited how much money 
contributors could give to candidates for state and local offices. 
</P>
<P>
"Absent a clear violation of law, I prefer to refer the matter" to the state 
Fair Political Practices Commission, Coleman said. "That's the direction I'm 
leaning in right now." 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia still intends to run a series of ads before the Tuesday election to 
advocate the preservation of open space in Ventura County, Sweeney said. But 
the ads will not mention any candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll be ads that could have run in an election two years ago or could run 
two years from now," Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer's attorney said the legality of the Patagonia ads will hinge on 
whether they imply that voters should support VanderKolk over Schaefer. That 
could occur even if they do not specifically mention the candidates by name, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In a press release, Sweeney acknowledged that he has assisted VanderKolk by 
giving her advice on campaign strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked during my free time with one of the candidates about how to frame a 
message and how to run a canvass," he said in the release. "While I am certain 
that, if the ads had run, they would clearly have been independent, we 
recognize that in politics, appearances matter almost as much as legality." 
</P>
<P>
VanderKolk, responding to withdrawal of the ads, said, "It's a disappointment, 
but I have to respect their decisions and I certainly understand." 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia, which employs 350 workers at its Ventura headquarters, turns over 
10% of its profits to environmental causes each year, Sweeney said. The company 
is involved in the supervisorial campaigns because it thinks the preservation 
of open space is an important countywide issue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer maintained that Patagonia is attacking her because she is a 
conservative Republican who is a moderate on growth issues.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;

<P>
NEW ENVIRONMENTAL REPORT IS ORDERED

<P>
An Ojai couple who want to build seven houses in a citrus grove will have to 
redo an environmental impact report on the project to take into account a 
one-year moratorium on new water hookups, city officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph and Josephine Macaluso have already spent more than $25,000 on an 
environmental report on their proposal to build seven houses in a 10-acre 
orange orchard near Nordhoff Cemetery on Cuyama and Del Norte roads. 
</P>
<P>
But Ojai Planning Director William Prince said that because of a one-year 
moratorium on new water hookups instituted by the Casitas Municipal Water 
District on April 11, the report needs to be revised to indicate that providing 
water to the seven houses would have an "unavoidable but significant impact." 
</P>
<P>
Prince said that a hearing set for tonight on the project will be held as 
planned and that a second session will be held July 18 after the new report is 
completed. A prior hearing on the project drew a large crowd opposed to the 
project because of traffic and air quality concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Macaluso said he should not have to redo the report because the orange 
trees he plans to remove from the land use more water than the houses would.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: FIRE DANGER CLOSES 2 'BACKCOUNTRY' AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two remote areas in Los Padres National Forest will close Friday -- about six 
weeks earlier than usual -- because of severe fire danger, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
About 175,000 acres of "backcountry" forest land will be closed to the public 
until the first significant rainfall this autumn, said Earl Clayton, a 
spokesman for the forest. 
</P>
<P>
There are no paved roads or campsites in either of the two regions, which are 
in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, Clayton said. The areas are accessible 
only on foot and by off-road vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"Vehicle exhausts can cause fires very easily," Clayton said. 
</P>
<P>
This year, there have been 17 fires in the forest, including a 625-acre blaze 
in one of the areas to be closed. Clayton said there have actually been more 
fires, but the forest service does not count fires that burn less than two 
acres because they are so common. 
</P>
<P>
Also beginning Friday, campfires and petroleum camp stoves will be prohibited 
outside of maintained campgrounds, and smoking will be prohibited except in 
campgrounds and enclosed vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Violators of the rules are subject to fines that range from $50 to $500, 
Clayton said. KIM KASH

STATE SEEKS TO BLOCK EL CAJON'S WITNESS ON EFFECTS OF MALATHION; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE CITY'S LAWSUIT TO HALT AERIAL SPRAYING AGAINST THE MEXFLY GOES 
TO TRIAL TODAY, BUT NOT BEFORE A HEARING THAT COULD EFFECT TACTICS IN THE CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of El Cajon's lawsuit to halt aerial malathion spraying goes to trial 
today. But before it does, the city's attorney is expecting the state of 
California to try to blow a hole in his case. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen M. Eckis, El Cajon's deputy city attorney, said the state attorney 
general's office told him Tuesday that it plans to file a motion to prevent him 
from calling witnesses to testify on malathion's effects on human health. A 
hearing on the motion is scheduled for 8:30 a.m., just before the 10 a.m. 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Municipal Judge J. Michael Bollman, sitting in Superior Court, decides 
in the state's favor, Eckis predicted that El Cajon still will have a fighting 
chance. However, Eckis fears that such a decision could reduce El Cajon's case 
to a series of legal technicalities. In a trial brief filed Tuesday, Eckis 
asserts that the state agriculture director Henry J. Voss violated state law 
when he decided to use the pesticide to wipe out a suspected infestation of 
Mexican fruit flies, or Mexflies. 
</P>
<P>
"The specific purpose is to convince the judge that there is substance to our 
legal challenge, and it's not merely technical," said Eckis, who said he has 
retained an expert witness from the University of Illinois to testify on how 
malathion affects people. "Simply because the director violated the law does 
not mean that the judge is going to issue an injunction" to stay the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the public is concerned about the effects on themselves and their 
families," Eckis said, adding that the state's motion would "prevent the public 
from receiving an airing of this issue of whether or not the spraying of 
malathion does present a health hazard. So far that's been a pretty closed 
discussion. The court process is the process by which we allow the public to 
examine it." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, on May 21, attorneys for the city lost battles in two different 
courts as they attempted to prevent helicopters from administering the first of 
three malathion doses over a 16-square-mile area. In swift succession, Judge 
Bollman and then two judges from the state Court of Appeal ruled that state 
officials had not overstepped their authority in declaring a state of emergency 
in San Diego County and ordering the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Eckis is hoping to persuade Bollman to issue an injunction to prevent the 
second application, which is scheduled for June 4. In a 37-page trial brief 
that called the spraying an "indiscriminate, intrusive and most injurious 
attack" upon El Cajon, Eckis alleged that Voss violated pest eradication 
statutes and the California Endangered Species Act. He said the spraying 
constituted a nuisance and questioned whether the discovery of three Mexflies 
constituted an infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the brief inquires as to how state officials decided the size of the 
spray area and the frequency of the applications. And it questions whether all 
non-pesticide options were exhausted before the spraying was initiated, as is 
required by the Food and Agriculture code. 
</P>
<P>
"While it is important to contain or eradicate the Mexfly, it is more important 
that governmental decisions be based upon a rational analytic process 
articulated in written findings," the brief said. " . . . Only if that is 
achieved will the citizenry have confidence in its government. The public's 
confidence in its government is far more important than the Mexfly project at 
hand." 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general's trial brief counters all of Eckis' claims, 
asserting that the state has been entirely lawful and proper and calling El 
Cajon's legal challenge "rather vague." 
</P>
<P>
"It is most important for the court to understand that California simply cannot 
live with the Mexican fruit fly," wrote Deputy Atty. Gen. Charles W. Getz IV. 
"Its impacts would be devastating both to the economy of the state and to the 
health of its citizens. . . . Any delay is tantamount to admitting that Mexican 
fruit fly is in California to stay." 
</P>
<P>
Getz also points out that during a state of emergency, the state's powers are 
greatly increased. Ideally, he writes, there will be no adverse impacts on 
endangered plant or animal species. 
</P>
<P>
"However, even if there were evidence of such secondary impacts . . . the fact 
that this is an emergency renders such impacts unfortunate but necessary," the 
brief states. "Increased use of pesticide, increased food prices and the 
attendant economic distress for all of California is a high price to pay for 
the rather vague environmental concerns expressed by the petitioners herein."

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: 10 MORE BEDS OKD FOR JUVENILE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Board of Supervisors Tuesday approved the addition of 10 
beds for females and new administrative offices at the Colston Youth Center, a 
juvenile detention center at 375 N. Hillmont Ave., Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the expansion, which is expected to cost about $635,000, will be paid 
for by Proposition 52, a state bond act approved in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Wittenberg, the county's chief administrative officer, said the state 
will pay $411,000 of the cost and the county will make up the rest. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion will ease crowding in the Clifton Tatum Center by allowing 
juveniles now housed there to be moved to the new facility, Wittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a precursor of what we're going to have to do in dealing with 
overcrowding in the adult jail system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the expanded facility is due to begin in October, with 
completion scheduled for April, 1991. JACK SEARLES

TEACHERS, DISTRICT AGREE ON CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN McKEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura Unified School District ratified a three-year contract Tuesday with 
its 660 teachers, ending a year of bitter negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers voted last week to accept the contract, which will be retroactive 
to July 1, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The new agreement calls for teachers to receive 50% of the district's revenue 
for salaries, down from the 58% they received under the last contract. The 
teachers took the cut to retain their health benefits, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The difference will be pooled with other district funds to pay for health 
benefits for all district employees, including retirees. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the teachers had turned down a contract that called for them to help 
fund benefits for retirees. Jerry Mittelholtz, president of the Ventura Unified 
Educators Assn., said the teachers changed their minds because of "a desire to 
get it over with. They looked at the contract and saw it was the best thing 
they could have." 
</P>
<P>
Under the new contract, the teachers will receive a one-time $1,000 bonus for 
the 1989-90 school year. District officials said the question of whether 
teachers' salaries will be raised depends on the amount of state funds 
received. 
</P>
<P>
District officials have projected a $1.2-million shortfall and have proposed a 
series of cutbacks. KAREN McKEAN

CONGRESSMEN ACCEPT TRIPS AND $161,750 IN HONORARIUMS

<P>
San Fernando Valley-area lawmakers received a total of $161,750 in honorariums 
from special interest groups in 1989 and accepted expense-paid trips to such 
destinations as Tokyo and Mexico City, according to annual financial disclosure 
reports made public Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) led the way with $60,300 in speaking fees, 
followed by Reps. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands), $31,000; William M. Thomas 
(R-Bakersfield), $28,500; Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), $22,700, and 
Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale), $19,250. 
</P>
<P>
Reps. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) and Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) 
accepted no honorariums or trips funded by special interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with growing criticism that special interests were buying influence with 
honorariums, the House voted to prohibit the appearance fees, beginning in 
January, 1991, as part of a pay-raise measure passed last fall. The Senate has 
not adopted such a ban. 
</P>
<P>
Current House rules permit a lawmaker to retain a maximum of $26,850 in 
honorariums annually. Waxman kept $26,808, gave another $31,296 to charity and 
used $2,196 to cover unreimbursed expenses incurred while earning the 
appearance fees. Lewis gave $4,500 of his fees to charity and pocketed $26,500. 
</P>
<P>
In many instances, the interests of the group providing the honorarium 
corresponded to the lawmaker's committee assignments and legislative influence. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman, chairman of a House subcommittee on health and the environment, 
received most of his fees from health industry associations. This included 
$5,000 each from the American Health Care Assn., Merck Pharmaceutical, the 
National Council on Prescription Drugs and the American Veterinary Medical 
Assn. He also got $4,000 from the Illinois Hospital Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, a member of the House Republican leadership who sits on the 
Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, export financing and related 
programs, received $2,000 each from the Tobacco Institute, Connell Rice and 
Sugar, the International Sweetener Colloquium and the National Beer Wholesalers 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, whose 35th District includes part of Palmdale in Los Angeles County, 
also accepted transportation, food or lodging for 11 trips, including a 
weeklong sojourn to San Diego and Mexico City and Guadalajara, Mexico, to meet 
with business and government leaders. The tab was picked up by the 
Congressional Economic Leadership Institute, a business-funded nonprofit 
organization in Arlington, Va., that seeks to educate lawmakers on trade 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, whose 20th District includes Lancaster and the northern Antelope 
Valley, sits on the Ways and Means Committee, which writes tax legislation. His 
honorariums included $2,000 each from the Securities Industry Assn., Mobil 
Corp., the National Assn. of Real Estate Investment Trusts and the Employees 
Council on Flexible Compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Berman, who is involved with communications issues on the House Judiciary 
Committee, received $2,000 from the California Cable TV Assn., $1,500 from the 
National Cable TV Assn. and $1,500 from the National Assn. of Broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Berman also accepted an 
expense-paid trip to Tokyo from the Japan Society. He attended the U.S.-Japan 
Parliamentary Exchange Conference, a weeklong meeting of American and Japanese 
lawmakers to discuss mutual concerns, said Gene Smith, Berman's administrative 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Moorhead, who is active in cable television regulation as a member of a House 
subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance, received speaking fees of 
$1,500 each from the National Cable TV Assn. and the National Assn. of 
Broadcasters. The veteran lawmaker, who is also a member of a subcommittee on 
Energy and Power, accepted another $2,000 from the Interstate Natural Gas Assn. 
and $1,000 from the Keystone Center Energy Project. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson has long eschewed honorariums, which he has criticized as tantamount 
to legalized bribery. Gallegly, who had received a small number of speaking 
fees in previous years, said through a spokesman that he made a decision not to 
accept any honorariums last year.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: EL CAJON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 31-year-old woman was arrested Tuesday on charges of writing $25,000 worth of 
forged and counterfeit checks. 
</P>
<P>
Paula Ann Bellin, a resident of San Diego's Encanto neighborhood, was charged 
with numerous counts of forgery and possession of counterfeit checks, said a 
spokesman with the El Cajon Police Department. She was being held at the Las 
Colinas jail for women in Santee. 
</P>
<P>
After a four-month investigation by the El Cajon and San Diego police fraud 
units, authorities searched Bellin's home and business Tuesday and found what 
investigators believe were stolen checks, mail, pieces of identification and 
discarded records from the Department of Motor Vehicles, the spokesman said.

A 25-year-old man who was shot Monday after reportedly confronting police with 
a hammer outside a grocery store remained in critical condition Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Carter, address unknown, was being treated at Mercy Hospital for 
multiple gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, Carter was "acting agitated and hostile" as he waited 
outside the Ralphs store on South Euclid Avenue with a large claw hammer tucked 
into the back of his pants at about 5:50 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Police had received a call of a man with a gun in the store's parking lot, a 
police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Carter told police he was waiting to confront a customer with whom he had 
argued earlier in the store when Officer Mike King approached at 5:55 p.m., the 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
King saw the hammer's handle sticking from Carter's pants and thinking it was 
the butt of a gun, King told him twice to freeze. Police said that Carter 
reached for the hammer and that King fired several shots, hitting him in the 
torso and legs. 
</P>
<P>
Carter later told police that he had heared King's warnings to freeze but 
reached for the hammer anyway, the Police Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
King has been put on routine paid administrative leave pending completion of 
the investigation, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The store was crowded, but no other injuries occurred. No charges have been 
filed against Carter pending the investigation's outcome.

<P>
After allegedly robbing an East San Diego home, a 35-year-old man stuck his 
handgun in his waistband and inadvertently shot himself in the groin, San Diego 
police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Manuel Guillen and two alleged accomplices were arrested by San Diego 
police after a robbery was reported in a home on South Bancroft Street. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with knives and a .22-caliber handgun, the three men forced their way 
into a home and demanded drugs and money, Sgt. Fred England said. 
</P>
<P>
They fled in a brown car, taking a television and cable television box, England 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting victim apparently shoved the handgun into his waistband, where it 
accidentally discharged, England said. Guillen, wounded in the testicles, made 
no mention of his injury when the three men were apprehended by police. But a 
detective noticed the blood on Guillem's pants before he began questioning him, 
England said. 
</P>
<P>
Guillem was taken to UC San Diego Medical Center, where he underwent surgery, a 
hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Valencia, 25, and Javier Hernandez, 25, were arrested and charged with 
robbery and burglary in connection with the incident. Guillem will be jailed 
when he is released from the hospital, England said.

A young man convicted of killing his mother and grandmother was sentenced 
Tuesday to life in state prison without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Newsome, 21, of San Diego, was convicted of the Sept. 5 slayings of 
Marsha Newsome, 49, and Mamie Newsome, 67, in their house on Sychar Road. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony from his trial in April indicated that the grandmother had argued 
with Newsome over his use of her credit card, on which he had charged a 
television and a video cassette recorder. 
</P>
<P>
Mamie Newsome was found strangled with an extension cord, and her daughter came 
home minutes later and found her body on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
According to a witness, who was one of Newsome's friends in the house at the 
time, Marsha Newsome argued with her son before she was stabbed to death.

MURDER TRIAL OF GLENDALE DOCTOR OPENS

<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Richard Pryde Boggs murdered a stranger, planted false identification on 
his body and reported the death as a heart attack to collect $1.5 million in 
insurance, a prosecutor told jurors Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Al MacKenzie didn't say in his opening statement what 
caused the death of Ellis Henry Greene other than that it was "not of natural 
causes." 
</P>
<P>
Greene's death remains a mystery. His body was quickly cremated in what 
prosecutors say was a deadly conspiracy to switch Greene's identity with that 
of Melvin Eugene Hanson, an Ohio businessman whose Columbus-based athletic 
clothing firm was in bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs, 56, a Glendale physician, is charged with Hanson, 47, who is awaiting a 
separate trial, and James Hawkins, 25, who collected $1 million in death 
benefits and remains at large. Hawkins was Hanson's partner in the Just Sweats 
clothing company. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not realize until some time after a dead man was cremated as Hanson 
that the thumb print on the corpse did not match the one on Hanson's California 
driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
The body eventually was identified as that of Greene. MacKenzie contended that 
Boggs met Greene at a North Hollywood bar, lured him to his medical office and 
killed him. He said Greene was "alive and well" until he met Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
But Boggs' attorney, Dale Rubin, told jurors that the man who died in Boggs' 
office had tested positive for the HIV virus associated with AIDS and had 
infections of the heart and lungs as well as liver disease. 
</P>
<P>
"This individual was not very well in the first place," he said, indicating the 
death may have been natural. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is as black and white, as positive as the district attorney made it 
sound," he told jurors. But he did not explain how Hanson's birth certificate 
and credit cards came to be on the body. 
</P>
<P>
MacKenzie said he would use circumstantial evidence to prove that Boggs, Hanson 
and Hawkins conspired to commit "the perfect murder" for money. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence will show you that Dr. Boggs manufactured a medical file in the 
name of Melvin Hanson to make it appear that Mr. Hanson had a long history of 
heart disease," said MacKenzie. "He also manufactured a false EKG strip." 
</P>
<P>
He said crime lab experts would testify that three differently dated 
electrocardiogram readouts in Hanson's file were found to have been created on 
the same day. "The edges of the paper on all three strips matched perfectly," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
With the cause of death in dispute, MacKenzie said he would call medical 
experts including well-known former New York coroner, Dr. Michael Baden, to say 
that the death was not natural. 
</P>
<P>
But Rubin said the experts would testify that "there is no such thing as the 
untraceable death." 
</P>
<P>
Other pieces of the circumstantial puzzle, MacKenzie said, would be a 
conversation Boggs had with his roommate about how to commit "the perfect 
murder," phone records showing a series of calls among Boggs, Hanson and 
Hawkins and an alleged stun gun attack by Boggs on another man. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs, who could receive the death penalty if convicted, has claimed he thought 
the man who died in his office was Hanson.

TRIAL STARTS IN ALIEN DETENTION CASE; 
</P>
<P>
COURT: TWO CARLSBAD STORE EMPLOYEES ARE CHARGED WITH UNLAWFUL IMPRISONMENT IN 
AN INCIDENT INVOLVING THE HANDCUFFING OF A MIGRANT LABORER OUTSIDE THE STORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
On the day they handcuffed a farm worker to a railing behind a Carlsbad store, 
two store employees were making a legitimate citizen's arrest, defense 
attorneys said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The argument was made during opening statements of the trial for Randy Ryberg 
and William Zimmerman in Vista Superior Court. The two are charged with a 
misdemeanor count of unlawful imprisonment in the Jan. 3 incident at the rural 
Country Country. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn A. Behymer told the jury that one of the jobs of his client, Ryberg, was 
to drive off the scores of migrant workers who sometimes blocked the entrance 
to the store as they sought day labor along El Camino Real, a few miles south 
of California 78. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike his brother Rick Ryberg, the owner of the store, Randy Ryberg had never 
before made a citizen's arrest but he decided to give it a try after Candido 
Gayosso Salas, 27, ignored several warnings to leave the property, Behymer told 
jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman, an independent meat cutter working at the market, assisted in making 
the citizen's arrest, and he and Ryberg handcuffed Gayosso to the rail for more 
than two hours, according to his attorney, Robert L. James. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities allege that the pair attacked the undocumented worker in an attempt 
to send a message to the great numbers of workers who gather in front of the 
store each morning. 
</P>
<P>
Gayosso, a slight man wearing blue jeans and a T-shirt, testified that he was 
grabbed about 7:45 a.m. by Ryberg, who stands about 6-foot-6, and dragged to 
the back of the store, where he was handcuffed to the rail. 
</P>
<P>
Before being released, he told the court, his hands and legs were bound with 
silver duct tape and a bag was placed over his head with a phrase reading "No 
Mas Aqui," an ungrammatical Spanish warning to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. George McFetridge said Tuesday that the attack on Gayosso 
was anything but a lawful citizen's arrest. "This was never a proper citizen's 
arrest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no excuse, in any event, for bagging a person like that, no matter 
what point they were trying to make." 
</P>
<P>
The Country Store case illustrates the tensions that have grown throughout 
North County, where perhaps thousands of documented and undocumented day 
laborers from Mexico and Central America live in makeshift encampments, often 
within sight of new housing developments. 
</P>
<P>
At least one community has recently passed an anti-hiring ordinance to stem the 
impromptu practice of hiring workers from city street corners. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, store worker Katey Dann testified that she saw Gayosso inside the 
store earlier that morning and said she heard Randy Ryberg yell several times 
for Gayosso and others to leave the market parking lot, where they were 
apparently blocking traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"He wouldn't leave the premises," she said. "If he did, he'd leave for a few 
minutes and come back after Randy left." 
</P>
<P>
Gayosso testified that he was not inside the store that morning and that he did 
not hear Ryberg say anything before being grabbed. While he was being dragged 
to the back of the store, Gayosso testified that Zimmerman held him face down 
as Ryberg chased off two other migrants who had come to his aid.

ARREST MADE OF ALLEGED 'DOCTOR' IN CHECK SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Canadian man hunted by law enforcement authorities from several states was in 
the San Diego County Jail Tuesday on charges of posing as a wealthy doctor to 
pass as much as $1.6 million in bad checks for jewelry, watches and coins. 
</P>
<P>
John Compton Harvey, 58, is suspected of running a multi-state scam for the 
past several years in which he posed as a distinguished physician and altered 
cashier's checks to buy from $800,000 to $1.6 million worth of goods, said Bill 
Robinson, a spokesman for the San Diego police. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a big tipper and led an affluent lifestyle, making sure people thought 
he had a lot of money," Robinson said. "He was well-dressed, gray hair, blue 
eyes and distinguished looks. He fooled a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey was being held in County Jail on $15-million bail. He was charged with 
two counts of burglary and three counts each of forgery and grand theft 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement authorities from 10 counties in California, Arizona and Utah 
have arrest warrants pending against Harvey for a variety of fraud, forgery, 
embezzlement and stolen property charges, and he is wanted for questioning in 
Georgia, Florida, Kentucky and Nevada, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Police are hoping that publicity about Harvey's arrest will prompt additional 
victims to come forward, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, Harvey would arrive in a city and obtain doctors' business 
cards and assume their identities, including establishing bogus answering 
services. 
</P>
<P>
He then answered classified advertisements from private parties selling 
expensive jewelry, watches and coins, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the sellers and persuading them to accept cashier's checks, 
Harvey would buy $10 cashier's checks, erase the amount, substitute a higher 
figure, and purchase the merchandise with the false check, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
He would make up to six purchases over three to five days in a given city 
before moving on, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police became involved nine months ago when Detective Dennis Sadler 
was assigned the case after Harvey apparently purchased merchandise with bad 
cashier's checks here, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Sadler) followed Harvey's track from city to city" and finally tracked him 
to a Palm Springs restaurant where he was arrested at 11:45 p.m. Saturday by 
U.S. marshals and police from Long Beach and Palm Springs, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey's activities were attracting a growing amount of attention -- the TV 
program "Unsolved Mysteries" planned to broadcast a segment on the scam -- as 
the number of his victims increased, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Additional arrests are expected, but police would not release additional 
information.

KELLY'S PUB BECOMES FOCAL POINT FOR JAZZ 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
This city's newest jazz hot spot is an unlikely candidate for the role. At 
Kelly's Pub in Old Town, a glittery disco ball shares the ceiling with a 
country-style fan. Shamrocks are painted on the walls. Some patrons are there 
for the pints of ale and the dart boards in the back. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly's isn't trendy or chic; there are no exotic, expensive drinks and no 
cover charge. 
</P>
<P>
A twisted trumpet mounted on one wall is a small sign of what's important. 
</P>
<P>
For local musicians and their fans, Kelly's Friday and Saturday jazz jam 
sessions recapture some of the spontaneity that was the original essence of 
jazz. Smiles predominate. Listeners shout encouragement to musicians when they 
unleash especially fine solos. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere may be loose, but the music is serious. Musicians say the smoky, 
low-key setting and appreciative audiences prompt some of their best work. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, very definitely," said San Diego jazz educator and trombonist Oliver 
Luck, who, on a recent Saturday night, shared the band's corner of the bar with 
pianist Jack Besta, saxophonists Joe Marillo and Tony Ortega, bassist Les 
Boynton, drummer Bob Deputy, vocalist and flutist Judy Garcia and Ortega's 
wife, Mona Orbeck, on vibes. 
</P>
<P>
At 10:30, the group was sweaty and swinging. Orbeck's mallets blurred as she 
spun out strings of improvisations, a compact, grandmotherly woman behind a 
large 
</P>
<P>
vibraphone. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Garcia belted out "Autumn Leaves," with Marillo's tenor and Ortega's alto 
melding together on moody sax lines as the horn players made eye contact from 
opposite sides of the "stage." 
</P>
<P>
Local saxman Gary LeFebvre had already played a set with the group. He sat on a 
stool at the bar, listening appreciatively. As the evening progressed, 
musicians left. New musicians arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Seven-string jazz guitarist Art Johnson walked in wearing a tuxedo and bow tie, 
ready to unwind after an evening backing singer Eartha Kitt at a Hillcrest 
nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
When the group took a break, the musicians mingled. These functions also serve 
social and business purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to sit down, find out what's going on, who's playing where, what's 
going on," Luck said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the time, such talk is more than idle gossip. Luck said conversations 
lead to new musical combinations and job opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the listeners at Kelly's are longtime jazz fans. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't heard one of those in so long, not since Red Norvo," marveled a 
gray-haired man who shook Orbeck's hand. "It sure brings back the memories." 
</P>
<P>
Several other Benny Goodman-era listeners smiled and nodded knowingly as the 
music unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly's is the latest in a line of San Diego clubs to serve as a musicians' 
hangout. Years ago, there was The Crossroads downtown, followed by Our Place in 
Hillcrest. At one time, the local musicians' union held Sunday jams at its 
union hall, but that now features established groups instead. 
</P>
<P>
There are other weekly jazz jams -- at Croce's downtown, the Salmon House on 
Mission Bay and the Fish House West in Cardiff, to name a few -- but for the 
musicians, Kelly's has a certain something that's hard to define. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got a nice vibe, a good location and plenty of parking," Johnson said. 
"Jazz players need a place to hang out, and this is about as relaxed as it 
gets. The place just has a certain flavor, it's a very hard thing to describe. 
Someone in the parking lot asked me what I thought this could become, and I 
said, 'The Donte's (a Los Angeles club, now closed) of San Diego, a place for 
musicians to hang out, their social network. 
</P>
<P>
"If you see each other all the time, you're more likely to get together and 
play. Unfortunately, in our time, a lot of people sit home with their VCRs. I 
see a lot of potential in it. George is is gracious gentleman who appreciates 
the musicians. He started with no one and packed the place in two weeks. 
There's no cover, you don't have to buy a million drinks." 
</P>
<P>
George is George Hawkins, who manages the pub and does all the cooking in a 
tiny kitchen at the back. He serves up fish and chips, burgers, fries and other 
snacks. But he is also responsible for dishing up the music. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins formerly worked at a tiny fish house on the Ocean Beach Pier that was 
host to regular jazz jams for several months until it closed last year. When 
Hawkins went to work at Kelly's, he revived the weekly sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Besta serves as Kelly's musical coordinator, phoning around to make 
sure a minimal band is on hand. Musicians who frequent the club also do their 
own phone networking. If someone plans on stopping by, he calls several musical 
friends and they show up too. 
</P>
<P>
"Call me the magnet," Besta said. "George accosted me, and I said, 'I'll look 
over my list of friends and invite them.' I came out of retirement. I quit 
playing in 1983 after I got tired of playing elevator Muzak in hotels. 
Mainstream jazz needs to be preserved. That is the impetus of my effort. The 
jam sessions, what we are dealing with is not the compositions of new 
composers, which remind me of Top 40 songs. Who wants to listen to those? 
</P>
<P>
"Our improvisations are based on classic songs, great American composers: 
George Gershwin, Jerome Kern. I've gotten so much out of music, I'd like to 
give something back." 
</P>
<P>
Like several other musicians, Luck said Kelly's offers the perfect escape. 
</P>
<P>
"With me, jamming is just a total release. When I'm working all day, teaching 
in the school, going out to play my horn is just a release of all the 
frustrations and anger that build up." 
</P>
<P>
By the time musicians play their regular dates and also stop in at Kelly's, 
many of them work seven days a week. Jazz can take its toll on relationships. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether there was such a thing as a jam-session widow, Luck said he's 
been married four times. He laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been a couple of jam session widows." 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend and next, Kelly's Pub will take a one-week break from open jams 
to feature jazz guitarist Peter Sprague Friday and the Bobby Gordon-John Best 
Quintet Saturday. On June 8, saxophonist Steve Feierabend will lead a quartet. 
The jams return at 9 p.m. June 9.

Phoebe Nora's blood would boil when she used to watch the man in the sleeveless 
jacket work the pay telephone around the corner from her Crenshaw District 
home. 
</P>
<P>
The routine was always the same. He would make and take a few phone calls, then 
slip away. When the man returned, his pockets were stuffed with drugs and the 
sidewalk was buzzing with customers. 
</P>
<P>
"It had gotten terrible," said Nora, a determined great-grandmother who would 
spy on the man from her car. "He kept calling and getting more pickups. He had 
a wad of money that was big enough to choke a horse on." 
</P>

Thanks to Nora and her neighbors, the man is now gone. Not incidentally, so is 
the pay telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in drug-plagued neighborhoods from New York City to San Diego are 
enlisting Ma Bell as a trenchant ally in their struggles to disconnect drug 
dealers who use pay phones to market their merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say many dealers prefer the curbside phones to cellular or home 
versions because they remain anonymous and calls are difficult to trace. The 
dealers, they say, essentially are using public phones as business offices. 
They receive phone calls from customers and call their suppliers to arrange 
deliveries of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
At the insistence of neighborhood groups, police and an occasional politician, 
telephone companies have removed pay phones from troubled communities or have 
altered them so that they cannot receive incoming calls. In rare instances, 
they have even taken a technological step backward by replacing push-button 
dials with rotary ones to make it more difficult for dealers to use pagers 
activated by touch-tone signals. 
</P>
<P>
"If it is necessary, we will do it," said Michael Breda of U.S. West 
Communications, which recently converted 18 push-button pay phones in St. Paul, 
Minn., to rotary dials. "We want to do anything we possibly can to curb drug 
trafficking." 
</P>
<P>
Although telephone company officials estimate only a small fraction of the 
nation's 2 million pay phones have been affected by the changes, some community 
leaders and law enforcement agencies say the restrictions are becoming an 
increasingly attractive weapon in the block-by-block assault on drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a great tool," said Sonja Richter, who organizes neighborhood 
crime watch groups in Seattle, where about 10% of pay phones have been limited 
to outgoing calls to prevent customers from calling dealers. "The dealers on 
the street are the lower-end ones, and they cause the greatest damage in the 
neighborhood. Psychologically, doing something about the phones makes people 
feel they have empowered themselves." 
</P>
<P>
In Oakland, where an estimated 100 pay phones have been removed or altered over 
the past three years, police said frustrated residents have vandalized other 
phones in neighborhoods where they believed telephone companies were not 
responding quickly enough to complaints. In at least one case, drug dealers 
retaliated by destroying a pay phone that had been used heavily by residents, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are talking about neighborhood issues, you are talking about things 
like stop signs, why people congregate in certain areas and things like that," 
said Oakland police Sgt. Bob Crawford. "Phones are all part of that." 
</P>
<P>
Next week a Los Angeles City Council committee is scheduled to hold a hearing 
on a proposed ordinance to prohibit pay phones in areas of Los Angeles where 
police believe their removal "would provide an overall benefit to the public by 
reducing the incidence of crime." Another proposal would keep the pay phones 
but eliminate incoming calls. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time to bring some order to our neighborhoods," said Councilman Nate 
Holden, author of the proposal to remove the phones. "These telephones have 
become a real nuisance. Some of them are being used 99% of the time for drug 
dealing and nothing else." 
</P>
<P>
Telephone company officials say they have done their best to cooperate with 
neighborhood groups, but many are not convinced that removing or altering pay 
phones is the solution to curbside drug dealing. In some cases, they say, 
telephone companies are being unfairly singled out by residents desperate for 
easy answers to deeply rooted neighborhood crime problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize it certainly can be a problem, but there is an element here of 
killing the messenger who brings the bad news," said Thomas Keane, president of 
the California Payphone Assn., whose members own most of the 30,000 private pay 
phones that have popped up statewide since regulators opened the pay phone 
business to competition five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This issue was a little pebble on top of the hill a year ago, and it is now a 
half-blown avalanche," Keane said. "We are worried that we will get caught in, 
'Let's run the pay phones off this block, and next month let's run them off 
another block.' " 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, officials from Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone, the city's 
largest pay phone operator, have tried to persuade community groups that pay 
phones need not be removed to address complaints about drug dealing. The 
company recommends that phones be restricted to outgoing calls. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said the strategy has been motivated in part by economics. 
C&amp;P removed 37 pay phones in 1988 in various Washington neighborhoods that 
had generated more than $120,000 a year in revenue for the company. By 
contrast, the company does not make money at pay phones on incoming calls, so 
it did not lose revenue by restricting an additional 113 phones that same year 
to outgoing calls. 
</P>
<P>
"We strongly prefer not to just take the phones out," said C&amp;P spokesman 
Michel Daley. "They are a significant form of revenue. . . . Also, pay phones 
are put in to meet a public need, and that is really to help people out, 
particularly in an emergency, anything from a flat tire to someone having a 
heart attack." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Hirsch, spokesman for Pacific Bell, which operates 120,000 of the 200,000 
pay phones in California, said the telephone company has blocked incoming calls 
on about 1,000 phones statewide. But he characterized the modification as a 
"disservice to the people in the community" who depend on phones for legitimate 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"We have gotten complaints from the community asking, 'Why are you shutting us 
out?' " Hirsch said. "There seems to be a connection between where telephones 
are used by pimps and drug pushers and where telephones are used by people who 
might not have access to a private telephone." 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch and officials from other telephone companies complain that there is no 
evidence that removing or altering pay phones actually reduces drug sales. In 
fact, Hirsch said, an informal polling of law enforcement agencies by Pacific 
Bell revealed that the changes to the pay phones have had little impact. At 
best, officials from several companies said, the restrictions have merely 
shifted crime problems to different neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't addressing the issue," said Patrick Doherty, customer service 
manager for GTE California. 
</P>
<P>
Police from Seattle to New York said it is virtually impossible to quantify the 
effect of pay phone restrictions on crime, but they agreed it is highly 
unlikely that overall drug sales have dropped significantly because of them. 
They said, however, that the restrictions have had a major effect on individual 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives drug dealers one less thing to hide behind," said Los Angeles Police 
Capt. Valentino Paniccia, who helped get about a dozen pay phones removed along 
Van Nuys Boulevard in Pacoima over the last year. "The total solution cannot be 
removing all of the phones in the world. But combined with other efforts, it 
can be very effective. Visible drug sales in this area are down 80% or 90%." 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach, where police once estimated as many as three quarters of all 
drug deals were arranged on pay phones, beat officers have detected an 
immediate drop in crime in neighborhoods where pay phones have been removed or 
altered. In addition to the obvious reduction in drug sales, other crimes -- 
such as assaults, robberies and car thefts -- have dropped in those areas, 
officers said. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is just to make it tougher for them to street deal," said Deputy 
Police Chief David Dusenbury. 
</P>
<P>
Richter, the community organizer in Seattle, said neighborhood victories -- 
even when they come at the expense of other neighborhoods -- are important for 
communities that have grown weary fighting crime. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a Band-Aid displacement kind of thing, but it relieves pressure," 
Richter said. "If you have not been able to sleep at night because of all the 
cars coming by, you don't care where they went. You just want to be able to 
sleep." 
</P>
<P>
In taking on the issue, Los Angeles joins a small but growing list of municipal 
governments looking for ways to support police and community groups. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council hearing is expected to spur debate among council members, 
telephone company officials and police about the effectiveness of pay phone 
restrictions. Several council members already have expressed reservations, 
saying the restrictions would punish law-abiding residents in high-crime areas. 
</P>
<P>
"The answer can't always be take away the things that all the good people need 
because the bad people abuse them," said Councilman Joel Wachs. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, several other cities, including Inglewood, Compton, 
Hawthorne, Long Beach and San Diego, have launched trial programs in recent 
months aimed at ridding pay phones of drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
One of the earliest government efforts came in 1987, when state and city 
officials in New York City teamed to restrict incoming calls on phones in 
drug-infested areas of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Sacramento enacted a far-reaching law that allows the city to 
declare troublesome pay phones as public nuisances. The city now can remove 
phones if other efforts to deter drug sales -- such as increased lighting and 
blocked incoming calls -- fail. 
</P>
<P>
The Sacramento ordinance also addresses an increasingly sensitive issue among 
pay telephone companies by prohibiting competing vendors from replacing phones 
that have been removed. Pacific Bell and GTE, the largest pay telephone 
companies in California, have complained bitterly to authorities that their 
private competitors have installed new phones in drug-plagued areas where the 
two companies have cooperated with police. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time we are asked to remove a phone, and then we investigate the matter 
later, it is common to find a privately owned pay telephone has followed ours," 
said Hirsch of Pacific Bell. 
</P>
<P>
In the northeast San Fernando Valley, Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) 
intervened last year to help resolve problems between GTE and several private 
telephone companies that had installed phones at locations where GTE had 
removed phones at the request of police and community groups. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said some of the private telephone companies "initially did not understand 
the seriousness" of the problem and have since agreed to cooperate. Los Angeles 
Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who represents the area, characterized the private 
telephone companies as "scavengers" and said they have impeded efforts to clean 
up portions of his district. 
</P>
<P>
Keane, president of the California Payphone Assn., said his members are 
struggling to find ways to stay in business while addressing demands from the 
community. In Berkeley, his company, Pay-Tel Phone System, installed flood 
lights around one troublesome pay phone and even turned it off during 
late-night hours but police still insisted that it be removed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In our business, the value of location is very, very important," Keane said. 
"The best phone in the world is useless if it is in your warehouse." 
</P>
<P>
One answer to the problem, Keane said, may lie in technology. New pay phones 
installed by private vendors, he said, can be programmed to track calls so that 
detailed records -- similar to consumer phone bills -- can be compiled for 
police investigations. He said the technology could act as a deterrent by 
making pay phones less attractive to dealers concerned about leaving a trail 
for police. 
</P>
<P>
Keane and others say that turning back the clock by converting push-button 
phones to rotary dials is not the answer. Not only can dealers bypass the dials 
with inexpensive converters, but the rotary dials prevent legitimate callers 
from having access to answering machines, voice mail and other 
touch-tone-activated telephone services, they say. 
</P>
<P>
However, Margaret McCrary, president of the Mansfield-21st Street Block Club in 
Los Angeles, said residents in her neighborhood want the phones removed or 
restricted to 911 calls. McCrary and her neighbors fought several years ago to 
have pay phones removed from their neighborhood. The phones are back, she said, 
and so are the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody relies on these phones for their livelihood or business except the drug 
dealers," said McCrary. "I have been in this neighborhood for 25 years. It is a 
nice neighborhood. We don't want the phones here."

<P>
Bolstered by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's opposition, Communist 
radical Boris N. Yeltsin finally got what he wanted Tuesday, the presidency of 
Russia, by promising the republic's Congress he would consult with all 
political points of view before forming a government. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the Kremlin's brick walls, Yeltsin backers cheered and wept with joy at 
news of the silver-haired maverick's victory which reportedly came despite a 
final appeal from Gorbachev. Their 59-year-old hero, the best-known critic of 
Gorbachev's reforms on the political left, beat out the Soviet leader's favored 
candidate, Alexander V. Vlasov, the huge republic's prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
It was a clear loss of face for Gorbachev, who had flown out of Moscow earlier 
in the day to Ottawa and a two-day visit before going on to his Washington 
summit with President Bush. Last week, in a stop-Yeltsin maneuver, Gorbachev 
took the floor at the republic's Congress to accuse him of advocating the 
breakup of the Soviet Union, but many deputies said the Soviet leader's 
criticism only boosted Yeltsin's chances. 
</P>
<P>
Asked on arrival in Ottawa about Yeltsin's victory, Gorbachev said the radical 
firebrand had moved closer to mainstream party positions and credited his 
election to that shift. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not just a political game he plays," Gorbachev said. "He has had to 
adjust his policy very seriously over the past few days, and he has adjusted it 
to the better. If he is playing political games, then maybe we are in for 
difficult times. We will have to see." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's triumph gives the once-disgraced populist a high-profile post he can 
exploit to press his demands for faster, more radical change, and it makes him 
the No. 1 government official in the vast expanse of the Russian Federation, by 
far the Soviet Union's biggest, richest and most populous republic. 
</P>
<P>
The son of Ural Mountain peasants assumes the presidency -- formally called the 
chairmanship of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet, or legislature -- as 
popular disgruntlement with the meager fruits of Gorbachev's social and 
economic reforms reaches a peak and something akin to panic is in the air over 
the Kremlin's plan to create a "managed market economy." 
</P>
<P>
In Yeltsin, millions of Soviet citizens will see a savior. But whether the 
former construction engineer who has made his political fortune by criticizing 
privileges of the powerful and Kremlin policy from the outside can deliver in 
his new office remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
"I pledge not to spare anything -- health or time -- to do everything to get 
out of this crisis and lead Russia to better times," he said from the dais of 
the Grand Kremlin Palace after his election was announced. 
</P>
<P>
His booming baritone filling the hall, Yeltsin called his election by the 
Congress "the beginning of the road to Russia's social, economic, and spiritual 
rebirth, the way out of the crisis and toward the blossoming of Russia." 
</P>
<P>
The broad-shouldered Siberian had been the top vote-getter in two previous 
rounds of voting in the Congress, but he had failed to garner the 531 votes, or 
one more than half the membership of the 1,060-seat body that were needed for 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, he was nominated again to face Vlasov and Valentin Tsoi, an ethnic 
Korean and a businessman from the city of Khabarovsk in the Soviet Far East. In 
the balloting, Yeltsin got 535 votes, or only four more than needed. Vlasov, 
who is also a non-voting member of the Politburo, received 467, and Tsoi 11. 
</P>
<P>
In a last-minute tactic that failed, the Communist Party had reinstated Vlasov 
as its candidate on Monday, three days after dropping him in favor of a 
hard-liner, Ivan K. Polozkov, the party chief from Krasnodar, in southern 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin offered conservatives a share in a future coalition government on 
Monday, saying he would hold negotiations with all factions in the Congress on 
nominees for prime minister and other key posts. That proposal made the 
apparent difference from the previous two rounds of voting. 
</P>
<P>
A "conciliation commission" representing the Parliament's more than 20 
organized factions was to meet at 10 a.m. today in the Kremlin's St. George 
Hall to begin talks immediately about the formation of the Russian Republic's 
new government. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Ottawa, Gorbachev noted how divided the Russian Congress became in 
its "epic struggle" for a new leader and said that in the face of Russia's 
pressing problems, "the most important challenge is to consolidate the efforts 
of everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said that the situation caused "concern" among the people because 
"Russia is facing very difficult challenges. There is a need for cooperation, 
for working together. Instead, there was a confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was mobbed as he left the Kremlin by several hundred joyful and 
misty-eyed well-wishers shouting "Victory! Victory!" He told state-run 
television that for Russia he wanted "sovereignty from the bottom to the top . 
. . such independence under which Russian laws and the constitution have a 
priority over those of the (Soviet) Union." 
</P>
<P>
But the extent of the Russian Federation's powers, like those of Yeltsin 
himself, have yet to be precisely defined in the shifting realities of Soviet 
politics and Gorbachev's quest to maintain a strong national government while 
devolving more powers to local officials. At any rate, the outgoing Russian 
president, Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, was an almost invisible figure. No one expects 
Yeltsin to follow his example. 
</P>
<P>
With Yeltsin's victory, the sort of relations he will have with Gorbachev, his 
former mentor, immediately became a topic of speculation. According to the 
independent Interfax news service, Gorbachev renewed his criticisms of Yeltsin 
at a meeting attended by secretaries of the party Central Committee and 
legislators Monday night, but obviously to little avail. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Yeltsin vowed to put aside "everything that's personal" in his 
relations with Gorbachev, who in 1987 engineered his ouster from the post of 
Moscow party boss, to which he had named him two years earlier. The break 
between the two men was over Yeltsin's criticisms that the perestroika reforms 
designed by Gorbachev were proceeding too slowly. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever his intentions, however, Yeltsin is on record in his autobiography, 
"Against the Grain," as calling Gorbachev "my perpetual opponent." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such opposition, Yeltsin staged a stunning political comeback without 
parallel in Soviet politics by scoring a landslide victory in elections to the 
national Parliament last year, and he easily won a seat in the Russian Congress 
of People's Deputies this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with Yeltsin's latest victory, considered a long shot last week when the 
nominating process in the Congress began, Soviet officials worked hard to put 
the best possible spin on things. Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. 
Gerasimov said it could be a boost for Gorbachev's drive for change. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union is a democracy, so we accept what the Russian Parliament has 
decided," Gerasimov told reporters at the United Nations in New York. "It may 
be a blessing in disguise. President Gorbachev has his critics from both the 
left and the right, and possibly it is better to have the election of a critic 
from the left." 
</P>
<P>
And Vitaly Churkin, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze's principal 
adviser on foreign affairs, said in an interview with NBC television that the 
election could strengthen Gorbachev's campaign for economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"I think . . . the election of Mr. Yeltsin . . . might actually help Gorbachev 
because Gorbachev is for radical reform, and he needs more popular support for 
that," Churkin said in Washington, where he is helping to prepare the summit. 
"And Mr. Yeltsin has assured people that if elected he is going to cooperate 
with Mr. Gorbachev. That might generate more popular support for more radical 
economic reform, which President Gorbachev has been advocating." 
</P>
<P>
A Communist Party official, Igor Malashenko, added that Yeltsin, seen by many 
Soviet citizens as the solution to the country's woes, would now be viewed as 
part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, many people blame Gorbachev for problems, and now they have another 
person to blame," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In other developments, the Soviet Union's national legislature, which is 
heatedly debating the government's proposals for economic reforms, voted down a 
request by radical lawmakers to submit Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov to a 
vote of no-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Radicals say Ryzhkov's proposals don't go far enough to end the centralized, 
bureaucratic restraints on economic activity that have been part of the Soviet 
system since the days of Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing before the Supreme Soviet, Ryzhkov vigorously defended the program, 
which will lead to an average doubling in the prices of foodstuffs, now 
subsidized by government expenditures of tens of billions of rubles yearly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE QUOTABLE YELTSIN 
</P>
<P>
ON THE NATION -- "(The Soviet Union) now is crumbling under growing 
dissatisfaction of the people." 
</P>
<P>
"Although 48 million Soviet citizens are living below the lowest standard of 
living, the leaders are indulging in the most unnecessary luxuries." 
</P>
<P>
ON GORBACHEV -- "(He) has lost control of himself and lost political control of 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
"While Thatcher rides in a car with two other people, Gorbachev uses a 
procession of four luxury cars plus an escort." 
</P>
<P>
ON GOVERNMENT -- "I am not for socialism for socialism's sake. I am for a 
government the people respect and for a government that respects the people." 
</P>
<P>
ON RUSSIA -- "It's time the central government stopped biting pieces off 
Russia." 
</P>
<P>
ON COMMUNISTS -- "There must be no monopoly of power. Down with the 
Communists!" 
</P>
<P>
"The transition to a multi-party system is just a question of time." 
</P>
<P>
ON ETHNIC UNREST -- "It is a mistake to dispatch troops and suppress ethnic 
problems by armed force." 
</P>
<P>
ON REFORM -- "Perestroika at present is going round and getting nowhere."

COURT TO DECIDE IF CLINICS MAY TALK ABOUT ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to rule on whether the Bush Administration can 
prevent health care workers at federally funded family-planning clinics from 
mentioning abortion to their poor patients. 
</P>
<P>
The case, to be heard in the fall, is a test of the court's views on free 
speech as well as abortion. At issue is the medical advice given to about 5 
million poor women and teen-agers each year. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1970, Congress has funded family-planning clinics for low-income women 
but prohibited using federal money to pay for abortions. In February, 1988, the 
White House went one step further by forbidding clinic employees from 
discussing abortion or referring patients to abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Challenged in federal court the same day they were issued, the regulations have 
not yet been put into effect because of the litigation. 
</P>
<P>
The regulations stipulate that clinic workers may not "encourage, promote or 
advocate abortion as a method of family planning" or distribute written 
materials on abortion. The rules, according to government lawyers, mean that it 
would be illegal, for example, to show a pregnant woman a list in the Yellow 
Pages of doctors who perform abortions. 
</P>
<P>
If a woman visiting a federally funded clinic asks about abortion, workers are 
supposed to say that the program "does not consider abortion an appropriate 
method of family planning." The federal rules add that clinic employees "must" 
provide a pregnant woman "with information necessary to protect the health of . 
. . the unborn child." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Ronald Reagan and Bush administrations, in keeping with their 
anti-abortion policies, have said the government has no duty to promote 
abortion and may limit how federal money is spent. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the rules argue that the government should not be allowed to 
"censor" what a doctor tells a patient. Moreover, they contend, many poor women 
and teen-agers cannot afford to raise a child and would be given "incomplete 
and misleading information" about their health care options. 
</P>
<P>
"If a woman came in with an ectopic (or tubular) pregnancy, which can be life 
threatening, we couldn't refer her to a hospital for abortion," said Thomas 
Kring, executive director of the Los Angeles Regional Family Planning Council. 
</P>
<P>
The federal courts are split on whether the regulations are constitutional. On 
Tuesday, the Supreme Court in a brief order said that it would hear the case 
(Rust vs. Sullivan, 89-1391) and resolve the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The issue in this case is similar to the recent controversy over federal 
funding for the arts and obscenity. Some First Amendment lawyers say that once 
the government chooses to fund the arts, it cannot limit the free expression of 
artists. But others say that the government can set any limits on how its money 
is spent. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York took the latter 
approach and upheld the abortion-clinic regulations. It said that, while 
government cannot stop abortion, it can dictate how its money is spent in 
family planning clinics without violating anyone's constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
"The government has no constitutional obligation to subsidize an activity 
merely because the activity is constitutionally protected," the appeals court 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But a few weeks later, the U.S. 1st Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston struck 
down the regulations as a violation of a woman's right to privacy and a 
doctor's right to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
The high court's past rulings give some hope to both sides in this controversy. 
In the 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling, the court said the Constitution gave women a 
right to get an abortion without government interference. It has also ruled, 
separately, that the First Amendment does not allow government officials to 
promote an official point of view while stifling differing views. 
</P>
<P>
However, in rulings in 1977 and 1980, the court said the government need not 
pay for abortion and may "make a value judgment favoring childbirth over 
abortion." 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer opposing the regulations said that the family-planning clinics are 
"health care outposts" in some of the nation's poorest neighborhoods. They 
offer advice on contraception or prenatal care and testing for pregnancy, AIDS 
or venereal diseases as well as routine physical exams. 
</P>
<P>
"For many women, this is their only point of contact with a doctor and the 
health care system," said Rachel Pine, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer 
in New York, who challenged the regulations on behalf of the Planned Parenthood 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
The National Right to Life Committee urged the court to uphold the regulations. 
"Most Americans do not believe that unborn children should be killed as a 
method of birth control," said Douglas Johnson, NRLC legislative director. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, 4,500 family-planning clinics are supported by federal spending of 
$132 million a year. In government jargon, they are known as "Title X" clinics 
because they are funded under Title X of the Public Health Service Act. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles area, clinics are located at the county hospitals, at the 
UCLA Medical Center and in neighborhood health centers, said Kring, who also is 
president of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Assn. 
</P>
<P>
If the Supreme Court were to uphold the federal regulations next year, the 
California clinics probably would refuse the federal money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The state provides $32 million a year to the family planning clinics, while the 
federal government adds $13 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, state law requires doctors to inform patients of their medical 
options. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we would be in violation of the state law if we withheld information 
on abortion as an option. So we would be forced to turn down the federal 
funds," Kring said. 
</P>
<P>
The court also agreed Tuesday to decide whether the Constitution's ban on 
"cruel and unusual punishment" forbids sentencing a Michigan man to life in 
prison for possessing about 1 1/2 pounds of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
In the war on drugs, state legislatures and Congress have been imposing 
ever-tougher sentences for selling or using drugs. In 1988, Congress said that 
people convicted three times in federal court of selling illegal drugs will be 
given a mandatory life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan went even further by setting a mandatory life sentence for possessing 
a large amount of an illegal drug. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Ronald Harmelin was arrested by Oak Park, Mich., police, who found 650 
grams of cocaine and a gun in his car. Although Harmelin had no previous 
record, he was convicted and sentenced to life in state prison. His appeals 
were dismissed by the state courts. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, while in prison, he filed his own petition with the Supreme Court 
(Harmelin vs. Michigan, 89-7272). 
</P>

RESTITUTION RULING -- Criminals may file for bankruptcy to avoid restitution.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court in 1973 ruled that women had a right to an abortion without 
government interference. But in 1980 the court said the government need not pay 
for them. In 1988 the White House imposed regulations that prevent workers in 
federally supported family-planning clinics from mentioning abortions as an 
option for low-income clients. The regulations were challenged and have not 
been put into effect. The court agreed Tuesday to rule on the issue that 
affects 5 million low-income women and teen-agers who visit the clinics each 
year.

VAN DE KAMP: BOLSTERED BY HIGHEST RANKING FROM CONSERVATION GROUP, HE PROMISES 
MORE FUNDING FOR COASTAL COMMISSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bolstered by a laudatory review of his environmental record, John K. Van de 
Kamp took an aerial tour of the Santa Monica Mountains on Tuesday and said that 
if elected governor he would increase funding to the California Coastal 
Commission to aid the agency's battle against illegal developments. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to capitalize on a report by a conservation group that gave him the 
highest marks among the gubernatorial candidates, Van de Kamp viewed two 
allegedly illegal developments in the mountains along the Malibu coastline and 
vowed to crack down on those who have defied state building laws. 
</P>
<P>
"Developers are waging an illegal war of attrition against this section of the 
California coast," the Democratic candidate said at a press conference shortly 
after his helicopter touched down in Corral Canyon State Park in Malibu. "And 
the coast is losing." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp proposed doubling the commission's $9-million 1989-90 budget and 
advocated strengthening the agency's enforcement powers so it could levy 
administrative fines and force violators to pay all legal costs. He said he 
also would increase the number of regional investigators to monitor 
developments along the state's coast. 
</P>
<P>
"All that stands between the beach right over here and the bulldozer is the 
California Coastal Commission," he said. "But their budgets are so small, and 
their powers so weak, that it's good business for developers to ignore the law 
and chew up the coast." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp toured and cited two developments in Malibu that are testing the 
limits of the Coastal Commission. Officials said developer Charles Tarrats 
illegally built a 2 1/2-mile-long road in Upper Ramirez Canyon and is being 
sued by the state for more than $500,000. In the other example, developer 
Sheldon Gordon received a permit to grade 40,000 cubic yards of earth and then 
allegedly graded more than 560,000 yards of dirt. Gordon faces a permit 
revocation hearing and possible fine next month. 
</P>
<P>
The California League of Conservation Voters on Tuesday gave Van de Kamp the 
highest rating among gubernatorial candidates, citing his "leadership" on 
coastal protection, water quality and toxics regulation issues. 
</P>
<P>
The group gave favorable marks in four areas to Dianne Feinstein, Van de Kamp's 
challenger for the Democratic nomination, but said that she had not taken 
leadership roles in any category. Feinstein received mixed reviews in the areas 
of transportation, growth management and toxics. 
</P>
<P>
Republican candidate Sen. Pete Wilson was given high marks for leadership in 
the areas of coastal protection and air quality, but the league said Wilson had 
a mixed record on parks and wilderness, toxics and energy issues. 
</P>
<P>
Although the league is a nonpartisan group, it screens candidates for office 
and campaigns for preferred candidates and ballot measures. Lucy Blake, the 
group's executive director, said that the league would not endorse any 
candidate until after the June 5 primary, but Van de Kamp touted his high marks 
and criticized Feinstein's environmental views. 
</P>
<P>
"This report shows that she has not been involved heavily in state 
environmental issues," Van de Kamp said. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said she was not surprised by the league's assessments, although she 
disagreed with the conclusions. She said the league's questionnaire was "really 
skewed against me" because she was not a sitting elected official like Van de 
Kamp and Wilson, and as such has had no post from which to initiate or react to 
environmental issues.

STRANDED HIKER RESCUED AFTER CHILLY NIGHT IN CAVE; 
</P>
<P>
OUTDOORS: MAN WAS LEFT ALONE NEAR TOP OF MT. BALDY AFTER SENDING COMPANIONS FOR 
HELP. THEY ALERTED SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT, WHOSE HELICOPTER FOUND HIM.

<P>
An exhausted hiker, stranded in two feet of snow near the top of Mt. Baldy in 
Angeles National Forest, found a cave and survived a stormy night before he was 
rescued in good condition by the crew of a sheriff's helicopter Tuesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Quinn, a 37-year-old truck driver from Long Beach, had sent his two 
companions for help Saturday morning after his legs began to cramp and he 
started losing his balance as the trio struggled up San Antonio Ridge in the 
worsening storm. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect to see them again," Quinn said Tuesday. "I thought I was going 
to die. We didn't talk about that. But I figured that, at least, the two of 
them could make it." 
</P>
<P>
Quinn's companions, Ed Kinghorn, 37, and Nancy Carroll, 34, climbed the 
remaining 500 feet to the top of the 10,000-foot mountain. Within four hours, 
they had found their way down to a cabin and telephoned for help, sparking a 
massive air and ground search. 
</P>
<P>
About 16 hours later, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department helicopter 
equipped with an infrared heat-seeking device spotted Quinn in the bottom of a 
canyon. A crew member dropped down with a sling, and Quinn was airlifted to 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn, who considers himself an experienced hiker, said the adventure began 
Saturday morning when the three set out from the East Fork Ranger Station, 
north of Glendora, for an arduous trek through about 10 miles of rugged back 
country to the top of Mt. Baldy, the tallest peak in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured the hike to take about 2 1/2 to three days," Quinn said. "But the 
going was steep and difficult, and we started getting behind schedule. . . . By 
Monday morning, it was snowing and cold. We really weren't prepared, 
clothes-wise. I was wearing shorts." 
</P>
<P>
As the morning wore on and the hikers made their way slowly up the ridge 
between 8,007-foot Iron Mountain and 9,988-foot West Baldy Summit, the weather 
worsened and Quinn began to weaken. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't go back the way we'd come -- that was too dangerous," Quinn said. 
"Because we had to climb higher to find the trail that would take us out, we 
knew the snow would get worse." 
</P>
<P>
Quinn said that about 10 a.m., he began to develop symptoms of hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
"My legs began to cramp, and I started losing my balance," he said. "I stopped, 
got into my sleeping bag and we agreed that the two of them should go on for 
help." 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like the best choice," Kinghorn said later. "I didn't think Nancy 
would last up there, and I didn't think she could find her way out alone. . . . 
But when we left, I didn't think I'd see Steve again." 
</P>
<P>
Kinghorn and Carroll set off up the ridge, leaving Quinn behind. She said the 
West Summit and the 10,064-foot main summit of Mt. Baldy were closer than they 
expected, and within a few minutes, they found a sign directing them down the 
mountain to Bear Flat. 
</P>
<P>
"After a while, we found some cabins," Carroll said. "There were people there . 
. . and we dialed 911." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies said they received the call shortly before 3 p.m. on Monday, 
and within a couple of hours, about 50 members of five volunteer 
search-and-rescue teams had begun working their way up the slopes of Mt. Baldy. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, near the mountaintop, Quinn had discovered that after a two-hour 
rest inside his sleeping bag, he had regained much of his strength. Crawling 
out of the bag, he resumed his climb. 
</P>
<P>
"I went right over the top of Baldy, but I missed the trail coming down," he 
said. "I figured out which way was south, and I started down. By then, it had 
started to rain, and I was getting soaked and chilled. 
</P>
<P>
"At about 2 p.m., I found a cave and I crawled in there and spent the night," 
he said. "I had some food with me." 
</P>
<P>
The ground search for Quinn was suspended at midnight. It resumed at dawn 
Tuesday, assisted by two helicopters from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department and another from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn said that when he awoke on Tuesday morning, "The sky was blue and I felt 
my troubles were over." 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, he said, he was spotted by the helicopter.

WATER RATIONING GETS LUKEWARM SUPPORT; 
</P>
<P>
CITY COUNCIL: PANEL SAYS IF VOLUNTARY CONSERVATION IS SAVING ENOUGH, MAYOR'S 
MANDATORY PLAN MAY NOT BE NEEDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A skeptical Los Angeles City Council committee Tuesday gave conditional 
approval to Mayor Tom Bradley's plan to impose mandatory 10% water rationing 
this summer, while calling for a report on the effectiveness of ongoing 
voluntary conservation. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources Committee agreed that if a study 
finds Los Angeles residents are collectively cutting water use voluntarily by 
7% or more, the rationing plan would not be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
"If Los Angeles is only 2% or 3% away from its goal, it doesn't make sense to 
go to mandatory rationing at this time," said committee chairwoman Joan Milke 
Flores. 
</P>
<P>
Flores asked officials with the Department of Water and Power to prepare 
statistics that would show how effective voluntary conservation efforts have 
been in curbing water use. She asked that the DWP measure use in the past 12 
months against usage in the comparable 12 months of 1986 -- before the current 
four-year drought began. 
</P>
<P>
DWP officials had earlier reported that overall water use was down 14% in 
April, compared to the same month last year, and that 8% of that was because of 
water conservation efforts. So far this month, preliminary figures show water 
usage down about 9%, though officials are unsure how much of that is the result 
of conservation and how much is because of changes in weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor has called for a mandatory 10% cut in every resident's water use from 
their pre-drought consumption level in 1986. Bradley proposed the rationing 
plan on May 2 in a move to deal with the four-year statewide drought and the 
apparent failure of the city's water users to voluntarily curb their use by 
10%. 
</P>
<P>
The Water and Power Commission last week recommended adopting Bradley's plan, 
under which residents and businesses would face stiff financial penalties for 
failing to cut back water use by 10% from 1986 levels. 
</P>
<P>
The committee voted to send the measure to a hearing of the full City Council 
on June 15.

WITNESS CONTRADICTS SELF IN CAMARENA MURDER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A key prosecution witness in the trial of four men accused of involvement in 
the murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena was caught in several 
significant contradictions Tuesday while under cross-examination by defense 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Hector Cervantes Santos, a former Mexican police officer who said he once 
served as the security chief at a drug baron's "safe house" in Guadalajara, 
testified that he saw defendant Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros at one meeting in 
1984 where Camarena's abduction was planned. 
</P>
<P>
However, defense attorney Martin R. Stolar pointed out during cross-examination 
that Cervantes had at various times told Drug Enforcement Administration agents 
that Matta was present at three meetings where drug traffickers and Mexican law 
enforcement officials planned Camarena's 1985 kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
On the witness stand Tuesday in federal court here, Cervantes said that Matta, 
a convicted Honduran drug kingpin, attended a meeting in October, 1984, to 
discuss the Camarena kidnaping but the witness contradicted his earlier 
statements to DEA agents by saying Matta was not at two other meetings. 
</P>
<P>
In another apparent contradiction, Cervantes, while on the witness stand, said 
there were four meetings where the kidnaping was planned. However, in 
interviews with DEA agents and in grand jury testimony, he referred to a total 
of six planning meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena was abducted off a Guadalajara street in February, 1985, and then 
tortured and murdered. His mutilated body was found at a ranch 65 miles from 
Guadalajara a month later. 
</P>
<P>
This is the third week of what is expected to be a two-month trial before U.S. 
District Judge Edward Rafeedie. The DEA has conducted an unprecedented 
five-year investigation in an attempt to get to the bottom of Camarena's 
murder. Their aggressive tactics have come under fire from the Mexican 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The DEA has made payments to 17 individuals in return for their testimony at 
the trial, according to U.S. government documents. 
</P>
<P>
Among them is Cervantes, 30, who has been paid more than $36,000 since he 
decided to become a government informant last November. Cervantes and his 
family have been relocated to the United States for their safety, he testified. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers have tried to discredit Cervantes by repeatedly pressing him 
about his contradictory accounts of the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
A jury of six men and six women have had to keep track of a lengthy list of 
Spanish-surnamed individuals who Cervantes said attended the various meetings. 
His testimony, through an interpreter, has been complicated and frequently 
confusing. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes said he worked for Javier Barba Hernandez, a Guadalajara lawyer 
turned drug trafficker, from 1982 to 1985. Barba was killed in a shoot-out with 
Mexican police in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes said that he had been present at all the meetings where Camarena's 
kidnaping was planned and that he never left Barba's side during the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
However, Cervantes had earlier told a federal grand jury in Los Angeles that 
there were times that he had to leave the meetings to get refreshments for 
people at the gatherings, which were held in the living room of Barba's house. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes also acknowledged on cross-examination that Camarena's name was never 
mentioned during any of the meetings. What was stated, he said, was that there 
was a troublesome DEA agent, who participants in the meetings wanted to "pick 
up" and question. 
</P>
<P>
Questions were also raised by defense lawyers about the manner in which 
Cervantes identified the defendants in court. They asserted Tuesday that he 
only had been able to identify the defendants because he had been shown photos 
of them shortly before the trial by prosecutors and DEA agents. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes, however, said that he had been able to identify the defendants 
through his own recollection, but he acknowledged Tuesday that he had been 
shown photographs on numerous occasions over the last six months. However, last 
Friday, he denied that he ever had been shown any photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers expressed dismay that they had not been given information 
earlier about what photos Cervantes had been shown and when. 
</P>
<P>
Rafeedie criticized the government for not disclosing such information earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"This caginess that has occurred is what is causing all these problems," 
Rafeedie said. "The defendants should know what photos this witness has seen 
and when." 
</P>
<P>
The witness's testimony has ranged from complicated to, at times, bizarre. He 
said that his boss, Barba, walked around his mansion carrying a hand grenade on 
his belt and also kept a lion in his house. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes also described parties where a Mexican police commander, Federico 
Castel del Oro, "got loaded" on cocaine. Castel del Oro is now serving as a 
government informant in the case, according to court documents, but he is not 
expected to testify. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes is scheduled to return to the witness stand today.

CARWASHES REAP A BOUNTY FROM DROUGHT, MEDFLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The twin scourges of life in Southern California this summer -- the worsening 
drought and continued malathion spraying -- are proving to be a bounty for at 
least one sector of the economy: carwashes. 
</P>
<P>
Sticky malathion sprayed from the skies over much of Southern California to 
combat the Mediterranean fruit fly has driven business up at carwashes by an 
estimated 20% to 40% as drivers wash their cars after each spraying, carwash 
operators report. 
</P>
<P>
And as California communities consider water rationing and other curbs on 
household consumption in the fourth year of drought, more residents are 
expected to turn to the local carwash as they try to cut water use at home. 
</P>
<P>
Carwashes also have received a boost from Metropolitan Water District 
officials, who through their literature are encouraging car owners to go to a 
carwash rather than washing cars on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Water officials say that carwashes, despite their conspicuous use of water, 
actually consume a small fraction of water per wash of what the average 
motorist would use with a hose and bucket in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not the problem, we are part of the solution," said Roger Woodyard, 
president-elect of the California Car Wash Assn. But carwashes "have the 
misfortune of being very visible" users of water, which leads to some 
misconceptions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
So carwash operators are taking the offensive, hoping to capitalize on their 
efficient use of water to lure patrons and stave off any possible restrictions 
on access to water supplies during the drought. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Kennedy, owner of a Placentia carwash, posts his water bills for customers 
to see. One recent bill showed Kennedy used 217,000 gallons of water in a 
month. "But I washed 14,000 cars," consuming about 15 1/2 gallons of water for 
each car, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Wimmer, who operates a dozen carwashes in the Southland, has a series of 
posters and banners in his Eagle Rock area carwash that proclaim, "Because we 
care, we recycle up to 85% of our water." 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials estimate that there are about 1,000 to 1,500 carwashes in 
Los Angeles County, each handling 12,000 to 18,000 cars a month. That means an 
estimated 18 million cars will be washed in Los Angeles County in each of the 
coming hot summer months when residents are being asked to cut water 
consumption by 10%. Statewide there are an estimated 2,500 to 3,000 carwashes, 
about 10% of all carwashes in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Not all carwash owners are convinced that they are about to reap a windfall. 
But the numbers seem to support those operators who see a substantial increase 
in business around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 24 million registered vehicles in the state, and "even in a 
drought, people will still wash their cars," said Wimmer. "People like clean 
cars." 
</P>
<P>
Especially people like Pat Sukove, a chiropractic assistant from North 
Hollywood, who was having her red Acura Integra cleaned at the Panorama Car 
Wash last week. "I bring it in every week, sometimes twice a week. I can't 
afford not to take care of it. I waited a long time for this car, it's my pride 
and joy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The enthusiasm Californians have historically displayed for their vehicles will 
make it tough to break habits like Sukove's, said Mark Dymally, a senior water 
district analyst who works with water-sensitive industries. 
</P>
<P>
The giant MWD has called on Southern Californians to cut water use this summer 
by 10%, and has encouraged 300 communities to adopt water-conservation laws, 
including encouraging residents to use carwashes. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it is symbolic," Dymally said about the effort to steer motorists to 
carwashes. "But we shouldn't minimize the symbolism. We already know that water 
use is inelastic. By that I mean if we raise your water rates by 25%, you won't 
cut use by 25%. So the important thing is behavior modification." 
</P>
<P>
If Californians can't be persuaded to drive dirty cars, they at least can be 
directed to the most efficient means of cleaning them, Dymally said. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the drought of 1977, these guys have improved their efficiency 
immensely," Dymally said about carwash operators. 
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 to 15 years most of the state's carwashes have installed 
high-pressure, low-flow water jets to reduce the total amount of water used, 
and have adopted recycling systems to capture and reuse the water. 
</P>
<P>
Operators say they turned to recycling as a simple matter of economics. "As 
businessmen, carwash folks feel very strongly about water because it is the 
lifeblood of their industry," said Sam Olivito, executive director of the 
California Carwash Assn., an industry trade group. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling allows operators to reuse relatively low-cost water. But more 
significantly, it holds down commercial sewer charges that continue to soar in 
Southern California. A $50,000 to $70,000 recycling system can pay for itself 
in a few years through lower operating costs, said Wimmer and other operators. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and water experts say the entire community benefits when 
water is conserved and harmful pollutants washed from cars are captured in the 
recycling systems rather than being dumped down the storm drains and into 
streams, rivers, and ultimately the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Green, a Los Angeles Department of Water and Power commissioner who 
also is president of the environmental group Heal the Bay, expressed concern 
about car owners hosing malathion off their vehicles and into the gutter. "Each 
car (has) a minor amount," she said. "But when you multiply it by all the cars 
in Los Angeles, boy!" 
</P>
<P>
The issues of drought and malathion spraying are becoming entwined. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, City Councilman Joel Wachs called for a special exemption in the 
city's water conservation law to allow residents whose homes are sprayed with 
malathion to wash the pesticide off their homes, cars and property. 
</P>
<P>
Carwash operators are keeping a close eye on that Los Angeles legislation and 
other proposed drought laws statewide. Since the last drought, industry 
officials made an effort to educate water officials and legislators about their 
business practices. "After the 1977 drought, the fear was that (our water use) 
was very visible, and there was a perception that we weren't saving water," 
said Olivito. 
</P>
<P>
Dymally, of the MWD, said surveys show that carwashes had the second-highest 
negative rating among Californians who were asked to rank perceived water 
wasters. Carwashes were second only to golf course operators in the surveys, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But as a result of their recycling efforts, most carwash operators have cut 
water use to about 14 to 20 gallons per car, several times below what they were 
using before recycling. 
</P>
<P>
The average car owner with time on his hands and a dirty car in the driveway 
may use upwards of 50 gallons, even if he's careful and uses a bucket and hose 
with a shut-off valve. Those who aren't careful and leave the hose running, can 
use more than 150 gallons on a simple car wash, according to figures compiled 
by the water district. 
</P>
<P>
Some carwash operators claim to have reduced usage to just seven gallons. 
Wimmer says that after a year of experimenting, he has recently perfected a 
water reclamation system that reuses 100% of the water, except for about five 
gallons per car that is lost to evaporation. 
</P>
<P>
Some skeptics, including the MWD's Dymally, question if that is possible. 
</P>
<P>
But Wimmer's carwash in the unincorporated area of San Bernardino County near 
Upland does not even have a sewer connection. Like most recycling systems, 
Wimmer's unit captures the water and ships it through a series of tanks in 
which the particles and pollutants are sifted out. The sludge is then vacuumed 
out every month or so and generally carted to a toxic waste dump. 
</P>
<P>
In Wimmer's new system, the water is also pressed through charcoal filters at 
night to remove virtually all other unwanted material. 
</P>
<P>
Wimmer said one of his biggest challenges was achieving a consistently clear 
color. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't get the colors out. Sometimes it came out green," he said. "It 
didn't hurt the car, but it was a psychological problem. Customers thought we 
were washing their cars with dirty water . . . and they complained." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the concern that customers will object to having their cars washed with 
"reused" water, hundreds of carwash operators said in a recent series of 
meetings that they plan to advertise their recycling efforts this summer, said 
Olivito of the carwash organization. 
</P>
<P>
And many consumers are catching on. 
</P>
<P>
"Not a day goes by that someone says to me, 'This is recycled, isn't it?' " 
said John Belgiorno, owner of the Panorama Car Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Just how much additional business operators will get is unclear, though most 
agree that some increased level of business is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Wimmer said business could increase 15%. Belgiorno said the increase will be 
commensurate with the amount of water people are being asked to conserve, so he 
pegs the anticipated boost in business at 10%. 
</P>
<P>
The incentive is large. The 100 to 150 gallons that a driver uses to wash his 
own car is equal to the average total daily use for an individual in Southern 
California, according to MWD figures. The average household of three uses an 
estimated 300 to 400 gallons of water a day. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting out a weekly at-home car wash could save several days' worth of water 
and go a long way toward helping residents make the 10% cut in water use that 
may be required under pending legislation in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But Ray Shouhed, owner of the Valley Car Wash, said he is not convinced that 
there will be much of an increase in business. Car washing is the first thing 
people cut out of a tight household budget, he said. The basic charge for a car 
wash in Southern California generally ranges from $3.50 to $6.50. 
</P>
<P>
Dymally also said he did not expect significant growth in the near term, but 
predicted "an increasingly healthy growth rate over the long term as the public 
conscience is raised."

Driving Up Business -- Business at Southland carwashes is booming, thanks in 
part to the drought and continued malathion spraying for Medflies. Some 
operators report a jump of 20% to 40%. Officials say that carwashes -- like 
Jack Beaver's in Encino, above -- actually consume a fraction of what the 
average motorist would use with a hose and bucket in the driveway. B1 DOUGLAS

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUPERVISORS TO CONSIDER $9 MILLION FOR AIDS 
FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, acting after the start of their 
meeting Tuesday was held up by militant AIDS activists, voted to study a 
recommendation by the county's advisory AIDS commission to add $9 million to 
the county budget to augment AIDS-related services. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, members of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power-Los Angeles disrupted 
the supervisors' meeting in a half-hour protest that resulted in 27 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the demonstration lasted less than five minutes and no arrests were 
made. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors left the room briefly after the protest began. When they 
returned they voted unanimously to instruct the Department of Health Services 
and Chief Administrative Officer Richard Dixon to report back within three 
weeks on the recommendation.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 120-DAY BAN ON CROAKER TAKES EFFECT TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Starting today, commercial fishermen who catch white croaker off the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula will face penalties of up to $1,000 and six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
The state Office of Administrative Law on Tuesday approved a 120-day emergency 
ban on commercial harvesting of the fish in the state waters from Point Vicente 
south to Point Fermin. 
</P>
<P>
John Smith, chief counsel for the administrative law office, said the measure 
would take effect today. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Fish and Game proposed the prohibition following the 
release of a state study showing that white croaker in that area pose an 
unacceptable cancer risk to those who eat the fish regularly. 
</P>
<P>
DDT and PCB chemicals were discharged through the Los Angeles County Sanitation 
Districts' sewage outfalls off White Point in the 1950s, '60s and early '70s, 
contaminating ocean sediment where white croaker feed.

<P>
A man shot and killed his estranged wife and daughter, wounded a second 
daughter, and then killed himself at a Hollywood apartment Tuesday, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the apartment on North Ardmore Avenue, police found the bodies of Jose 
Osorio, 40, and his estranged wife, Maria, 34, and their daughter, Gisela, 14. 
</P>
<P>
Each was shot once in the head, Lt. Bob Ruchhoft said. Another daughter, Maria, 
13, shot in the mouth by a bullet that lodged in her shoulder, was in stable 
condition at Childrens Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
A .38 caliber revolver was on the floor close to the body of Jose, he said. The 
location of the revolver and information from a girlfriend of the daughters, 
who witnessed at least one of the shootings, led police to believe that the 
father fired the shots, he said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUIT SEEKS TO BLOCK JAILS IN MINORITY 
NEIGHBORHOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legal aid attorneys joined the city of Los Angeles and two state legislators 
Tuesday in filing suit to prevent the county from building new jails in heavily 
minority neighborhoods in downtown, East and South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Superior Court suit contends that a jail master plan recently approved by 
the Board of Supervisors violates state law requiring counties to avoid an 
over-concentration of detention facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also accuses the county of failing to assess the environmental impact 
of the plan, which would boost the county's jail capacity to 43,230 beds over 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't for a minute contest that the county needs to build some additional 
jail beds, but the question is how many and where you build them," said Lisa 
Foster, an attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Other plaintiffs in the suit include state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), 
Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles) and the Concerned Citizens 
of South Central Los Angeles.

IT'S NO FAST-LANE LIFE, BUT 200 TURTLES KEEP OJAI COUPLE ON THE GO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
On a warm afternoon in the Ojai Valley, 77-year-old Lillian Greene is busy 
outside her home making the daily head count of her turtles. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 200. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Max, 85, is about to make his daily trip to what he jokingly calls 
the "big wicked city" of Ojai to pick up the vegetable cuttings that Bayless 
Market saves for him. 
</P>
<P>
The tortoises eat a diet made up primarily of lettuce, oranges, mangoes, corn 
on the cob, grape leaves and frozen string beans, but they also love cactus and 
wild mustard from the fields. 
</P>
<P>
"Grass is better for them than lettuce," says Lillian as she smashes apples 
with a heavy rock for two huge Sulcata tortoises from the Sahara, with shells 
nearly two feet across. 
</P>
<P>
Though toothless, the large turtles chomp through the apples in seconds. Their 
razor-sharp jaws are so strong that during battle they can rip through an enemy 
tortoise's shell and flip it over on its back. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't dare turn my back on them or they'll butt me," Lillian said. Some 
tortoises are extremely aggressive and will butt anyone on their territory. 
Lillian bought this pair, but the majority of their turtles were gifts. 
</P>
<P>
The Greenes' property, blooming with purple and yellow climbing roses and blue 
rosemary, resounds with grass-chomping and scraping of shells against obstacles 
as the tortoises crawl slowly around. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, they are not silent: Lillian says they make sounds like a baby 
doll or a jackhammer when excited or during mating. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the tortoises or turtles (the terms are used here interchangeably, 
although technically tortoise designates the terrestrial varieties and turtle 
the aquatic) at the Greenes' Turtletown are grandparents and are up to 100 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
It is an international mix of Mojave tortoises, Hermanns from England and 
Germany, tiny Israeli Terrestras, box turtles, little Horsefield turtles from 
the steppes of Russia and more. 
</P>
<P>
There are numerous sheds with cardboard cartons that serve as the tortoises' 
beds, a small "gingerbread" cottage and low "houses" of cinder-block, boards 
and blankets. Constantly underfoot, the turtles have free reign under the shade 
of large patio umbrellas and mesh awnings. 
</P>
<P>
"We get up each day at 7 to open everything up," Lillian Greene said. They then 
feed, doctor and clean up after the tortoises. After lunch, school classes or 
curious visitors often line up for tours. 
</P>
<P>
The Greenes put the tortoises away for the night by 4 p.m., boarding up the 
small huts to keep out raccoons and the bear that once menaced their brood. 
</P>
<P>
The Greenes moved to the Ojai Valley in 1930 as newlyweds and still live in the 
same house. About 20 years ago, they heard something eating their squash. It 
turned out to be a tortoise attached to a large chain and ring, which they 
promptly removed. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to find its owner, the Greenes adopted Speedy; someone gave them a 
female, and nature took over. People started bringing them sick, injured or 
lost tortoises and eventually the animal shelters brought them more, Lillian 
Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
Now they have a permit to care for turtles from the California Department of 
Fish and Game that they proudly display with their awards from the Desert 
Tortoise Council, the Optimist Club and the Ventura County Humane Society.

MCMARTIN PRE-SCHOOL REDUCED TO RUBBLE; 
</P>
<P>
BULLDOZED: THE MANHATTAN BEACH FACILITY, AT WHICH SOME FORMER STUDENTS INSIST 
THEY WERE MOLESTED, WAS TORN DOWN TO MAKE WAY FOR AN OFFICE BUILDING.

<P>
The infamous McMartin Pre-School was bulldozed into history Tuesday, existing 
now only in the memories of former students, some of whom insist they were 
molested there, and former teachers, who insist they provided loving care. 
</P>
<P>
The sun broke through the haze and parents cheered as heavy equipment lifted 
the roof off at about 11 a.m. By day's end only three green walls were still 
standing, one of them boldly emblazoned in large spray-painted letters: "We 
believe the children." 
</P>
<P>
None of the alleged victims who attended the once-prestigious Manhattan Beach 
nursery school were on hand. But a handful of parents and volunteers -- their 
faces caked with dirt and streaked with tears -- watched as the building came 
down. They had been digging since April 13 for evidence of a trapdoor, tunnel 
or secret room that more than a dozen former students have talked about. 
</P>
<P>
The busy Manhattan Beach Boulevard site will soon contain a three-story office 
building with underground parking. It was sold in February for $320,000 by 
defense attorney Danny Davis -- who acquired it as part of his legal fees -- to 
Arnold Goldstein, a Hermosa Beach real estate broker. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a whole lot of peace of mind now. I feel satisfied," said a 
mother who believes her teen-ager was sexually abused. "My son says it's all 
over for him; that he's going to lead his life. But I think I'm worse than he. 
I think it's very therapeutic to see it down." 
</P>
<P>
The demolition began just as experts hired by parents unearthed what they say 
may once have been a maze of subterranean tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel wonderful and confident that we found it for the kids," said Stan 
Ibrao, a volunteer who lives nearby and provided meals to tired parents who 
have been frantically excavating the site since April 13. 
</P>
<P>
Curious passers-by, some with cameras slung around their necks, others carrying 
surfboards, peered at the dig, asking, "Did you find anything?" 
</P>
<P>
The parents believe that they have. An investigator from the district 
attorney's office was shoulder-deep in one of the holes when word came that 
only one hour remained for the searchers. 
</P>
<P>
However, a district attorney's spokesman said neither the investigator nor 
prosecutors would comment on the findings, except to say that they are 
unrelated to the case now being prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
Charges against five of the seven teachers originally charged in the massive 
molestation case were dropped in 1986. Then last January, after a three-year 
trial, Peggy McMartin Buckey was completely acquitted and her son, Ray Buckey, 
was found not guilty of most of the charges against him. He is being retried on 
eight of the counts, involving three girls, that left an earlier jury 
deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't doing this for the court case," explained Jo Anne Farr, one 
McMartin parent. "We were trying to validate what the kids said." Another, 
Marilyn Salas, was critical of the prosecution's handling of the case. "The 
district attorney's office drilled down six inches," she said. "We went down 
seven feet!" 
</P>
<P>
The early days of the dig were conducted by parents, who were soon literally 
over their heads in dirt and debris. Ted Gunderson, former Los Angeles FBI 
chief and close friend of one of the McMartin parents, agreed to oversee the 
search. He turned to Gary Stickel of Environmental Research Archeologists for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a tunnel to me," Stickel said, adding that he has no vested 
interest in the outcome of the dig. "It's too bad we don't have more time to 
explore the thing. There are still artifacts in there, and they may be key 
ones." 
</P>
<P>
The archeologist said that after eliminating those subterranean excavations 
that can be explained as having been made for pipelines or other purposes, two 
"probable tunnels" remain: one under a bathroom in the first classroom and the 
second under the third and fourth classrooms. Objects dating from the 1970s and 
early 1980s were found in soft fill dirt and debris. 
</P>
<P>
Gunderson said the larger opening is 45 feet long, 4 feet high and increases 
from a width of 2 1/2 feet to 9 feet. Parents believe the chamber may be the 
"secret room" where molestations allegedly took place. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys could not be reached Tuesday. But parents said the Buckey 
family and former teacher Betty Raidor were seen outside the school in recent 
days.

Gina MacAndrew was watching fancy speedboats and Jet Skis race across a lake in 
San Dimas when a line of vehicles rolling across the beach caught her eye. 
</P>
<P>
They were wheelchairs that were slowly being maneuvered through the deep sand 
by a half-dozen paraplegics. They pulled to a stop at the water's edge. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought to myself, 'What are they doing out here?' " said MacAndrew, 20, a 
clerk from Fontana who had stretched out on the beach at Puddingstone Reservoir 
to sunbathe. 
</P>
<P>
The paralyzed young men had come to water-ski, visitors to the lake at the 
eastern edge of the San Gabriel Valley would soon learn. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, the men pulled themselves out of their chairs and eased into the 
68-degree water. Then they struggled into canvas seats bolted to a single ski 
the size of a narrow surfboard. 
</P>
<P>
At the cry of "Hit it!" they clutched a tow rope, and a 20-foot powerboat 
lurched forward for a fast couple of laps around the 250-acre reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
At first, most of the skiers only made it a few yards before losing their 
balance and toppling into the water. But a championship skier -- himself a 
paraplegic -- was in the boat to shout out instructions and encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
Lean into turns, yelled Bill Bowness, who holds a world record for handicapped 
water-skiing. Like most of the men he was teaching, Bowness, 31, of Chico, is 
paralyzed from the waist down. His back was broken 13 years ago in a car 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
There were more than a few false starts. But each skier eventually figured out 
how to balance on the 20-inch-wide board and how to ride it over waves being 
kicked up by other boats and Jet Skis. 
</P>
<P>
Apprehensive looks gave way to huge grins as each skier glided back toward the 
shore after his turn around the lake. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a scary feeling at first, but I figured I'd give it a try," said Danny 
Hendrick, 23, of Chino, who often water-skied before a forklift toppled on him 
and broke his back. "This takes a lot of arm strength." 
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Jimenez, 28, of San Bernardino, hooked the tow rope to the front of the 
82-inch-long ski and held tightly to the sides of the ski seat with his hands. 
"I'm nervous. I'm scared because of the impossibility of moving my legs," 
admitted Jimenez, crippled by a fall from a roof eight months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Scanlon, a muscular 33-year-old wheelchair kung fu expert, took his turn. 
So did Chad Greenfield, 21, of Riverside and Mark Granger, 33, of La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tuckered out. I used every muscle in the body," said Granger, who 
frequently water-skied before a construction accident paralyzed his legs seven 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
There were whoops of joy and applause from the boat when Chad Bowser, 17, of 
Mission Viejo completed his loop around the lake. The cheering was led by Robin 
Butler, 25, a therapist from Pomona's Casa Colina Rehabilitation Centers who is 
helping Bowser recover from head injuries suffered in a car crash last year. 
</P>
<P>
The boat used during last week's outing was operated by Tee Broussard of Alta 
Loma. He said he volunteered use of his craft after becoming acquainted with 
Casa Colina when his 16-year-old son, Scott, broke his back in an 
all-terrain-vehicle accident a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
As they toweled dry, the excited skiers talked about their next visit to the 
lake. Excursion leader Jim Miller said another trip would be planned when the 
use of a boat could be arranged. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, beach-goers watched respectfully as the skiers folded their towels and 
then laboriously rolled their wheelchairs off the sandy beach. 
</P>
<P>
"What they're doing is awesome," said speedboat owner Joe Lovas, a Rancho 
Cucamonga plumber. "Your legs are the most important part of skiing. They are 
shock absorbers. They give you balance. What they're doing is tough. I'm 
impressed." 
</P>
<P>
Call him next time, Lovas said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be happy to pull them behind my boat if they wanted me to." 
</P>

group of paraplegics, including Danny Hendrick of Chino, found a new world to

the end they were happily talking about their next visit to the lake.

After a bunch of scientists had worked for 15 years and spent billions of 
taxpayer dollars to develop the cameras and other gear, what do they get but a 
couple of white spots on film? Any of us, without a penny spent by the National

of light bulbs and accomplish the same thing.

In my opinion, shared by an untold number of others, it is time to put a stop 
to this kind of money wasting. If people in Washington want to spend money, why 
don't they aim it at schools, hospitals, housing, roads and reduction of the 
national debt that would directly benefit everyone in this country?

SHERIFFS: MORE FORCE THAN NEEDED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Years ago, comedian Richard Pryor performed a routine about what it was like to 
be pulled over by the police. His character made loud announcements of every 
planned movement -- such as "I am about to reach for my wallet" -- so that no 
officer could misread a movement as threatening. It was funny but sad, because 
the fear of being shot or beaten by the police was real to many minority 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, the Los Angeles Police Department bore the brunt of such jokes 
locally. But the LAPD has a better standing now with various segments of the 
community. That didn't happen by accident. The department, under tremendous 
political pressure, instituted better management controls on the use of 
unnecessary force. Most important, LAPD brass began to set a tone in word and 
deed -- still not perfect, but much improved -- that said that use of 
unnecessary force was not only unacceptable, but would be a hindrance to 
officers' careers. 
</P>
<P>
Has that message gotten through in the county's other major law enforcement 
agency? Sheriff Sherman Block says his department policies are adequate to 
prevent the use of excessive force. Maybe not. Excessive-force lawsuits against 
the department have almost doubled in the past five years. The names of some 
accused deputies show up with regularity; some even get promotions. What should 
have been a routine parking violation turns into a $150,000 taxpayer-financed 
lawsuit after deputies beat up a trucker. Stops for traffic violations turn 
into fatal shootings. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in such incidents cannot be attributed simply to chronic 
complainers and overzealous attorneys -- or even to the increased violence of 
our time. Something else may be going on. The county should start tracking 
excessive-force lawsuits against deputies and coordinate that information with 
public misconduct complaints so that deputies with a pattern of complaints 
could be red-flagged. The Board of Supervisors, exercising budget-strings 
pressure if need be, must demand greater accountability from this often 
excellent but increasingly worrisome Sheriff's Department. The problem can, and 
must, be solved.

YES -- GERMANY IN A TRANSFORMED NATO; 
</P>
<P>
BUT CAN GORBACHEV BE PERSUADED TO SHARE THE VISION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until recently, relaxing tensions between the United States and the Soviet 
Union seemed to mean dismantling nuclear armaments. No longer. At this week's 
summit meeting, Presidents Bush and Gorbachev must turn to the future, drafting 
plans for a system of peace in Europe to replace the system of nuclear 
deterrence of the past. No matter how proudly the two leaders may display new 
arms treaties in the next few months -- or days -- peace in Europe now has more 
to do with the reunited Germany question than with cuts in nuclear and chemical 
weapons. So this summit is mainly about Germany's relations with its neighbors 
to the East and West. It is the thorniest issue imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
The summit would be a total triumph for Bush if he could persuade Gorbachev 
that a unified Germany belongs in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, whose 
sole purpose for more than 40 years was to stand off the Soviet Union. The 
short version of Gorbachev's reaction is, "No way." Not an irrational reaction 
at all, given how the Soviet people suffered in fighting Germany during World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush needs to make his best pitch anyway. The most compelling argument is 
that the 19th- and 20th- Century Germany that twice nearly destroyed Europe had 
no philosophical anchor and no political commitment to a peaceful Continent. 
Whatever Gorbachev thinks of NATO, it has such a commitment and would provide 
such an anchor. 
</P>
<P>
But without the United States as a member, it would not have enough clout to 
counterbalance the behemoth of a united Germany. NATO is a good way to bind the 
United States to Germany and the rest of Europe. Without some kind of NATO, 
Washington would be hard put to justify a major presence in a Europe that will 
merge to become a more challenging economic force in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Americans and Germans are not alone in pressing the case for keeping Germany in 
NATO. Many of NATO's 16 member nations agree, as do Poland and Czechoslovakia 
in Eastern Europe. For now, this reflects Europe's collective sense that it 
needs to keep a close eye on Germany and its military plans more than it needs 
to keep a weakened Soviet Union at bay. 
</P>
<P>
Bush probably is in a better position to give up points than Gorbachev. Some 
elements in Moscow accuse Gorbachev of giving away the store. Moscow may have 
made all the easy concessions it can afford. If NATO were somehow reconfigured, 
even the Soviet armed forces, some of whose leaders can remember the German 
siege of Leningrad and leveling of Stalingrad, might see the appeal. After all, 
they won't want to gamble that Germany will behave, and their army is perhaps 
in as bad a shape as the civilian economy, with draftees refusing to show up 
for service and nearly 200,000 soldiers and their families without decent 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
Still, until the German question is settled, Gorbachev will not rush to cut his 
forces and may even balk at withdrawing more Soviet troops from East Germany. 
The danger in agreeing to disagree for a month or a year is not great. Bush can 
bide his time. But that time must be used to figure out the shape and mission 
of the new NATO. Bush already plans to meet this summer with the West European 
allies to discuss a new role for the alliance, less military and more 
political. He and Gorbachev should use this summit to make certain that each 
understands the other's needs for a role in the European future. If that 
happened, it would provide a base for Bush's summer talks on NATO's new role 
and make this summit memorable.

DEALING WITH THE TRAGEDY OF NO-CARE MOMS, NO-HOPE BABIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Freedman wrote an excellent column (May 15) on the needs of children. 
</P>
<P>
He eloquently builds a case for "preventive investment" and "preventive 
legislation." Nowhere is the immediate devastation of failed policy and 
ignorance greater than with the growing number of our children living in 
poverty and without hope. 
</P>
<P>
He recommends starting with our state Constitution. " . . . We can amend the 
California Constitution to guarantee that every mother and child has the right 
to health care. We can . . . halt the cycle of no-care babies becoming no-care 
mothers. We can make California the first state . . . to achieve universal 
prenatal care."

PANEL OKS BILL TO PUT TEETH INTO RESTRAINING ORDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An Assembly committee on Tuesday approved legislation intended to prevent 
domestic violence by requiring police to respond quickly to threats against 
people who have restraining orders protecting them from harassment. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved by the Public Safety Committee, was prompted by the killings 
of Maria Navarro and three other women in East Los Angeles last year. The women 
were slain minutes after Navarro called the 911 emergency line to request 
police protection because she had been warned that her estranged husband was on 
his way to her home and had threatened to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's dispatcher told Navarro that there was nothing police could do 
until the man arrived at her house. The next call from the home was from 
someone reporting that four women, including Navarro, had been fatally shot. 
</P>
<P>
The intent of the bill is to give teeth to the court-approved restraining 
orders that women such as Navarro obtain to protect themselves from others, 
usually husbands or boyfriends, who have threatened them, Assemblyman Patrick 
Nolan (R-Glendale) said. 
</P>
<P>
"Women receive these orders thinking they are receiving protection, but they're 
only worth the paper they're printed on," said Nolan, author of the Assembly 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
There are 40,000 restraining orders outstanding in Los Angeles County alone, 
said CarolAnn Peterson, a consultant to the California Assn. of Business and 
Professional Women. But Peterson said police in Los Angeles and elsewhere do 
not do enough to enforce those orders. 
</P>
<P>
"Victims of violence have been abandoned by the legal system that was designed 
to protect them," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Under Nolan's bill, police and sheriff's departments would have to prioritize 
the kind of calls received and rank among the most important domestic-violence 
calls from women who have protective orders. "This is not just someone calling 
and saying, 'Gee, I think I'm in danger,' " Nolan said. "This is someone who 
already has convinced a court that they are in danger." 
</P>
<P>
Nolan originally proposed requiring departments to give domestic violence calls 
priority "over other requests for assistance where violence has occurred." But 
on Tuesday he amended the bill to allow police to delay their response if other 
calls they are handling are more important. 
</P>
<P>
The amendments were aimed at winning support from the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department, which has defended its action in the Navarro case and 
opposed Nolan's bill. The department has said it would be overwhelmed if it 
responded to every call it gets from people who feel threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Sheriff John T. Cleary said the department may support the amended bill. 
"We just felt that (the original bill) took a lot of discretion away from us," 
Cleary said.

Prosecutors said Tuesday they will wait at least two weeks before deciding 
whether to formally charge two environmental activists accused by police of 
causing an explosion that nearly killed the pair last week. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the two said the delay indicates police have a weak case and 
renewed their charge that someone tried to assassinate the activists to stop 
their efforts to preserve old-growth redwoods. 
</P>
<P>
One of the activists, Darryl Cherney, 33, of Piercy, remained free on bail 
Tuesday. The other, Judi Bari, 40, of Redwood Valley, was still hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Dist. Atty. Chris Carpenter said formal charges will be delayed until 
the FBI finishes testing physical evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"We just like to have all the evidence in front of us before we file any 
charges," Carpenter said. He declined to discuss the evidence taken from the 
remains of Bari's car, which exploded Thursday in Oakland with Bari and Cherney 
inside, and from Cherney's van and their Mendocino County homes. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental activists who witnessed the raids said they saw agents seize 
wire, nails, duct tape and light bulbs.

COUPLE PULLED FROM WRECKAGE OF PLANE; 
</P>
<P>
RESCUE: PILOT'S USE OF HAND-HELD RADIO HELPS TEAM TO SITE IN SAN GABRIEL 
MOUNTAINS, ENDING A DAYLONG SEARCH. VICTIMS ARE IN STABLE BUT GUARDED 
CONDITION.

<P>
Guided by a downed pilot using a hand-held radio, rescuers pulled a couple from 
the wreckage of their small plane Tuesday after a grueling, daylong search 
through rugged, cloud-shrouded terrain in the San Gabriel Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at San Antonio Community Hospital in Upland identified the couple as 
James Thomas, 39, of Covina, and his wife, Becky, 36. They were in stable but 
guarded condition, both with multiple fractures and lacerations, said nursing 
supervisor Joanne Tarbell. 
</P>
<P>
The Thomas' four-seater Cessna 182 was en route to Ontario International 
Airport from Blythe when it crashed at about 10 a.m. Tuesday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A team of about 15 rescuers from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department 
was dropped by helicopter on a peak above the crash site and worked its way 
down through the clouds to the plane, which was upside down in a rugged canyon 
above Rancho Cucamonga, said Capt. Don Belter. Another team made its way to the 
wreckage from below in trucks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The ground team reached them first shortly before 7 p.m.," Belter said. "We 
got a break in the weather when the cloud cover lifted, and we were able to 
send a large helicopter in to bring them out." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Bryant, a spokesman for the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, 
said the plane was on approach to Ontario at about 10 a.m. when its radio 
communication with the control tower abruptly broke off. 
</P>
<P>
Later, officials at TRACON, the regional air traffic control center in 
Palmdale, heard Thomas calling for help on his hand-held radio. The sheriff's 
aerial rescue team was dispatched, and a helicopter picked up Thomas' radio 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy said he was upside down and trapped in the rear of the plane," Bryant 
said. "He was disoriented." 
</P>
<P>
By talking with Thomas, rescuers flying in a constantly circling helicopter 
were able to determine the general location of the wreckage, about 12 miles 
northeast of Chaffey College. 
</P>
<P>
Because the crash site, between Deer and Day canyons was shrouded by thick 
clouds, the sheriff's aircraft was unable to spot the wreckage or drop rescuers 
in the immediate vicinity. The rescuers were forced to drop into a clearing and 
hike through the rugged terrain toward the wreckage, about 6,300 feet above sea 
level. By late afternoon, they had fought their way through the brush and were 
able to hear Thomas banging on the wing of the plane, Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities initially believed that four people were aboard the plane and did 
not learn otherwise until rescuers reached the couple.

HARRELSON IS MET MANAGER; JOHNSON OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Mets, an organization swiftly beginning to resemble the cross-town 
Yankees in style and substance, fired Manager Davey Johnson Tuesday and named 
coach Bud Harrelson as his successor through the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
Harrelson's debut at the Mets' helm was spoiled by the host Cincinnati Reds, 
who won, 2-1, Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was fired with a 1990 record of 20-22 after compiling the best record 
(575-395) in baseball during six full seasons as the Mets' manager, an average 
of 96 victories per year and the fourth best percentage (.5927) ever. 
</P>
<P>
However, General Manager Frank Cashen said the team had not played to its 
potential since the start of the 1989 season, when it ultimately finished 
87-75, six games behind the Chicago Cubs, who won the National League East 
title. 
</P>
<P>
"The club was underachieving and needed to go in a new direction," Cashen said. 
"Part of the blame is certainly mine. Part of the blame has to be with the 
organization and part of the blame has to be with the team. It's not all 
Davey's." 
</P>
<P>
Said infielder Dave Magadan: "I'm surprised they didn't fire everybody on the 
team and bring up our (triple-A) Tidewater team, considering the way we played. 
It's unfortunate, but we definitely had a hand in his firing." 
</P>
<P>
On a recent 3-5 trip to the West Coast, several Mets had criticized the club's 
impassive performance and attitude, prompting Howard Johnson to hold a players' 
meeting in Los Angeles. The suddenly inspired Mets emerged to rout the Dodgers 
twice, but that momentum couldn't be sustained, and Johnson told writers 
traveling with the team that his firing was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
"Davey seemed a little bit relieved when I told him," Cashen said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Johnson, after his arrival at the Orlando, Fla., airport en route to his 
home in Winter Park, Fla.: 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't given a reason and I didn't ask for one. I would have liked to have 
met with the players to say goodby, but Frank didn't want me to stay around. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry I won't be part of it when the Mets get straightened out, but I have 
no regrets. I have to think my record speaks for itself." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has been criticized some for a laissez-faire approach to club rules 
that Harrelson said will now be strictly enforced, and criticized more for his 
handling of a touted pitching staff that has been surprisingly inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
Under Johnson, only Frank Viola, Dwight Gooden and Sid Fernandez started 
regularly this year, and Ron Darling, David Cone and Bob Ojeda were openly 
frustrated by their uncertain status and occasional bullpen employment. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson escaped firing at the end of last season only because Cashen and vice 
presidents Al Harazin and Joe McIlvaine, who form what Johnson liked to call 
the "three-headed monster" that runs the Mets, couldn't agree on it. 
</P>
<P>
That divisiveness, then and now, was compounded reportedly by dissension 
between owners Nelson Doubleday and Fred Wilpon regarding the Mets' direction. 
</P>
<P>
It is no longer clear, in fact, as to who is in charge of the organization. 
Johnson, in some ways, paid the price for a series of moves that stripped the 
club of character and much else. 
</P>
<P>
Since the World Series victory of 1986, Kevin Mitchell, Len Dykstra, Mookie 
Wilson, Roger McDowell, Gary Carter and Keith Hernandez have all departed, 
along with a variety of top prospects. 
</P>
<P>
The minor league well appears to have run dry, and the Mets rank near the 
bottom of the National League in offense, as well as leading the majors in 
errors.

DODGERS DIG HOLE DEEPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Fernando Valenzuela threw three consecutive pitches at Andy Van Slyke's head. A 
man charged the mound. Two Dodger relievers were beaten up. 
</P>
<P>
Another brawl between those bosom buddies, the Dodgers and the Pittsburgh 
Pirates? 
</P>
<P>
No, it was just the Dodgers beating themselves again in a 9-5 loss to 
Pittsburgh Tuesday night before 10,252 at Three Rivers Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Those hoping for another round of pushing and shoving, as promised by both 
teams after Monday's incidents here, were disappointed. The Dodgers obviously 
were not looking for a fight. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, hit for six runs in 4 1/3 innings, was throwing at Van Slyke's head 
because he just couldn't get it over the plate. He walked six, the most of any 
Dodger pitcher in one game this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Van Slyke knows me, he knows I don't do that kind of thing," Valenzuela said 
of their fifth-inning encounter, which resulted in a stream of boos from the 
fans but just a shrug from Van Slyke. "Today, I have no idea what I was doing." 
</P>
<P>
The man charging the mound was pitching coach Ron Perranoski, who removed 
Valenzuela from the game with the Dodgers trailing, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
The beaten relievers, Mike Maddux and Pat Perry, were bruised only in the box 
score. With them on the mound, the Pirates' six runs became nine runs. That was 
unfortunate for the Dodgers, because in the meantime they pulled off a five-run 
seventh inning that should have put them back in the game. 
</P>
<P>
After Valenzuela and a brief appearance by Jim Gott, Maddux gave up a run on 
two hits in the sixth inning to make it 7-0. The Dodgers closed the gap to 7-5. 
Then Perry gave up two more runs to seal it for the Pirates, who lead the 
National League East by three games. The Dodgers have followed their five-game 
win streak with two consecutive losses here, and have fallen 8 1/2 games behind 
the first-place Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
"In those situations, we have to hold them," Dodger Manger Tom Lasorda said, 
referring to his middle relievers. "We still had a couple of at-bats to catch 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Perry, who gave up a run in the seventh and eighth innings, was the chief 
offender for a second consecutive game. He allowed a run-scoring double by Don 
Slaught in the seventh after a wild pitch, and a run-scoring fly ball by Gary 
Redus in the eighth after Perry's wild throw on a pickoff play at second base. 
</P>
<P>
In five appearances during his first week on the active roster after last 
winter's shoulder surgery, Perry has an 9.00 earned-run average with two wild 
pitches in five innings. That's one more wild pitch than Ramon Martinez has 
thrown in 58 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Is this another case of a rehabilitating Dodger pitcher who says a heavy 
workload has been heaped upon him too quickly? Well, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a little soreness in my shoulder," Perry said. "I have been tested as 
much as anyone in the last week. . . . I've pitched five of eight days right 
off the bat. . . . I have been tested a lot, but that's fine, I want to keep 
pitching." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, who fell to 4-4 while his ERA rose to 4.09, offered different 
reasons for his failings. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm throwing, not pitching," Valenzuela said. "I just go to the mound and 
throw the ball, I have no idea what is happening. I have to think out there. I 
don't think, I'm in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
While starters Mike Morgan, Tim Belcher and Martinez have been consistently 
decent, and starter John Wetteland has been consistently poor, Valenzuela 
remains the staff puzzle. He has won consecutive starts only once this season, 
alternating tough performances with games like Tuesday's. 
</P>
<P>
The big hits against him were a two-run double by Van Slyke in the second 
inning, and a two-run single by former Dodger R.J. Reynolds in the fifth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
But Valenzuela was nearly taken off the hook in the seventh, when Pirate 
starter Bob Patterson, with a 5.58 ERA in 59 career games, finally tired. The 
Dodgers managed six hits and batted through the order in that inning for the 
seventh time this season. The big hits were a two-run pinch double by Mickey 
Hatcher, and run-scoring pinch-single by Lenny Harris. It was Harris' first 
pinch-hit in nine pinch at-bats this season. 
</P>
<P>
The inning ended when Kal Daniels, one of the best selective hitters in the 
league, watched three straight strikes on curveballs from reliever Scott 
Ruskin, the final strike being far enough outside the plate to cause Daniels to 
momentarily argue with home plate umpire Steve Rippley. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson increased his playing time in center field to seven innings Tuesday 
for triple-A Albuquerque while showing that his legs are in shape enough to 
steal third base. In seven innings against Edmonton in his fourth 
rehabilitation game, he went one for three with an RBI and his first steal. He 
is still adjusting to center field, as he made a three-base error. "He is 
giving it a good test, and he is feeling good about it," said Pat Screnar, 
Dodger therapist. "He was stiff and sore at first, but that has subsided." 
Gibson's return to the Dodgers' active roster could be as soon as a week. . . . 
The Dodgers and Pirates were given official warnings before Tuesday's game, 
meaning automatic ejections with the first perceived brushback pitch. There 
were no such pitches. . . . John Wetteland will be given another chance Friday, 
as he has been told he will start against the Cincinnati Reds. . . . Third 
baseman Jeff Hamilton said he could be throwing a baseball within a week, 
despite continued shoulder pain because of tendinitis. . . . Before Tuesday's 
game, the Pirates were still mad at the Dodgers because of Monday's beanball 
incidents. Said Pirate Manager Jim Leyland: "I'm tired of the Dodgers being 
made out to be the good guys all across the country. The Dodgers created the 
problem, let them live with it. And I don't care who over there likes it." 
Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda didn't like it. "Why do they keep bringing it up?" 
he said. "As far as I'm concerned, it's dead. I've got no more comment."

TEENS SHOW EDBERG, BECKER THE WAY OUT; 
</P>
<P>
FRENCH OPEN: FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A GRAND SLAM EVENT, THE TOP TWO SEEDED 
PLAYERS BOTH ARE ELIMINATED IN THE FIRST ROUND.

<P>
So, Stefan Edberg, who is going to win the French Open? 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea," Edberg said. "I know I'm not going to." 
</P>
<P>
And you, Boris Becker? 
</P>
<P>
"Someone besides Boris Becker," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some heavy timber fell unexpectedly at the French Open on a sunny Tuesday when 
Edberg and Becker, the two top-seeded players, lost in the first round in a 
shocking tennis double play of record-breaking proportions. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg is the No. 2 player in the world, the 1988 Wimbledon champion, the 1989 
Wimbledon runner-up and the 1989 French Open runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
Becker is the No. 3 player in the world, the 1989 Wimbledon champion, the 1989 
U.S. Open champion and the 1988 Wimbledon runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
They're both gone. 
</P>
<P>
The defeats of Edberg and Becker marked the first time that the No. 1- and No. 
2-seeded players lost in the first round of a Grand Slam event. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg became the first No. 1 in the 99-year history of the French Open to take 
the court and lose in the first round, a shocking 6-4, 6-2, 6-1 defeat by 
19-year-old Spaniard Sergi Bruguera. 
</P>
<P>
About four hours later, Becker joined Edberg to form an entry in the record 
book. Goran Ivanisevic, an 18-year-old Yugoslav with a devastating serve, 
ousted Becker, 5-7, 6-4, 7-5, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
It was Becker's first first-round defeat in 22 Grand Slam events. Edberg's only 
other first-round defeat in 28 Grand Slam events was in the 1983 U.S. Open when 
Aaron Krickstein beat him. 
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic, who is 6 feet 4, served 19 aces, an extraordinary feat on the slow, 
red clay. Ranked No. 51, he reached the round of 16 in last year's French Open 
after appearing on the scene as a qualifier in the quarterfinals of the 1989 
Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just playing out of his mind," Becker said. "I was hoping he would get 
tired, but it was the other way. He was getting better and better. 
</P>
<P>
"He just kept serving and hitting and hitting. And in the fourth set, nobody in 
this world could stop him." 
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic agreed: "In the fourth set, there is no chance for him." 
</P>
<P>
He said he felt no pressure because he believed that Becker would not yet be at 
his peak in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the matter of Bruguera's upset victory over Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
"I say, 'Bruguera beat Edberg, why cannot I beat Becker,' you know," Ivanisevic 
said. "I say, 'Come on, (it) is your chance. He is not playing well, he is not 
confident.' " 
</P>
<P>
Edberg's record-setting departure looked as if it would stand alone for a 
while. In the 1965 French Open, top-seeded Manuel Santana defaulted in the 
first round, but he never made it to the court. 
</P>
<P>
Up an early break, Edberg gave it back in a hurry and deflated quicker than you 
can say souffle. 
</P>
<P>
For the Swede, everything went wrong. He came in when he shouldn't have, he 
stayed back when he should have come in, he couldn't keep his backhand on the 
court and he couldn't even toss the ball up straight on his serve. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Picard, Edberg's coach, found the defeat so upsetting, he was ready to 
take it out on his client. 
</P>
<P>
Question: What is your reaction? 
</P>
<P>
Picard: It isn't printable. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What are your plans? 
</P>
<P>
Picard: Apart from kicking his butt? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Bruguera already did that for him. The 6-1, 160-pound former Spanish 
junior champion who is ranked No. 46, last made his presence felt in the 1989 
Italian Open, in which he beat Jimmy Connors and reached the semifinals, and in 
the 1989 French Open, when he made the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
Down, 4-2, in the first set, Bruguera lost only three more games. "I didn't 
think it would be that easy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coached by his father, Luis, Bruguera lost to Edberg, 6-0, 6-3, this spring at 
the Newsweek Champions Cup, but that was on a hard court. Bruguera credited his 
victory to playing on clay, as well as a change of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
"In my head, I had to be very calm," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Becker accepted his defeat by Ivanisevic calmly. 
</P>
<P>
Neither he nor Edberg had an easy draw. Bruguera and Ivanisevic are both 
accomplished clay-court players. Such luck of the draw is one of the pitfalls 
of Grand Slam events, Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly, but it is now certain that Ivan Lendl will keep his No. 1 ranking. 
Lendl, who skipped the French Open to practice on grass for Wimbledon, would 
have lost No. 1 to Edberg or Becker if one of them had won here. 
</P>
<P>
Becker was asked if he might change his plans -- start practicing on grass and 
erase Lendl's head start. 
</P>
<P>
"Until 30 minutes ago, I was thinking I would win a few matches here," Becker 
said. "I tell you this, I'm not going to Wimbledon tomorrow. Lendl is safe."

MORNING BRIEFING: DR. J HAD THE STYLE, BUT JORDAN HAS THE INTENSITY, KERR SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARLEY TINKHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the general manager of the Virginia Squires, John (Red) Kerr signed Julius 
Erving out of the University of Massachusetts. As an announcer for the Chicago 
Bulls, he has watched Michael Jordan ever since Jordan left North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no comparison," Kerr told Steve Jacobson of Newsday. "Michael is a 
vicious offensive player. Doc was never a vicious player. He was a finesse 
player. 
</P>
<P>
"Doc didn't establish the outside shot. Michael scores from the outside. He's 
even displayed a three-point weapon." 
</P>
<P>
As for Jordan's artistry, Kerr said, "Elgin Baylor could do things in the air. 
Dave Bing could also do a little. Connie Hawkins could. Michael does even more. 
I've seen all his games in the league, and he still does things that bring me 
out of my seat." 
</P>
<P>
Keystone kings: Said Hall of Fame second baseman Joe Morgan, when asked to rate 
the best at his position: "Bill Mazeroski was the best I ever saw. Jose Lind 
has more range than anyone I've seen, and I guess that Ryne Sandberg is the 
steadiest." 
</P>
<P>
Add keystoners: Said the Oakland Athletics' Mike Gallego after Willie Randolph 
came to the A's from the Dodgers: "It's going to be tougher for me to get a 
table at a nice restaurant now, saying, 'I'm Mike Gallego, extra infielder.' " 
</P>
<P>
Add A's: ESPN's Norm Hitzges, on the Oakland Coliseum: "You could graze 300 
sheep in foul territory of this ballpark, and they would never go hungry." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Bob Klapisch, baseball reporter for the New York Daily News, is 
the answer to what trivia question? 
</P>
<P>
Dying to play: Lee Trevino told Dave Anderson of the New York Times the one 
about the duffer who slashed his wrists after a horrendous round. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino: "The guy's sitting there, bleeding, when a friend walks in and says, 
'Why did you slash your wrists?' The guy says, 'I hate this game.' The friend 
says, 'That's too bad, I was going to ask you to play tomorrow.' And the guy 
looks up and says, 'What time?' " 
</P>
<P>
Raiders respond: Steve Ortmayer of the Raiders, on Tuesday's item from the St. 
Paul Pioneer Press, which reported the rumor that the Raiders mistakenly 
drafted defensive end Anthony Smith instead of Arizona teammate Chris 
Singleton: "That's so silly it defies description. We went all the way back 
with Smith and Singleton to when they were 4 years old. I assure you, we 
checked out everything thoroughly. And the player we wanted was Smith." 
</P>
<P>
Culture shock: Cornerback Tim McKyer, on the difference between the facilities 
of his new team, the Miami Dolphins, and those of his old team, the San 
Francisco 49ers: "I've definitely got something to get used to. I left a 
Cadillac and now I'm in a Chevy." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: He was the ghostwriter for New York Met pitcher David Cone, who 
stirred up the Dodgers with derogatory remarks about their pitching in the 
Daily News during the 1988 National League playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: A's Manager Tony La Russa, after saying of Jose Canseco, "I probably 
think he's better than he thinks he is," adds: "And you know he thinks he's 
very good, right?" HARLEY TINKHAM

TRACK AND FIELD: NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS; 
</P>
<P>
TOP-10 FINISH WOULD MEET UCLA GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Great expectations have dwindled to modest goals for the UCLA men in the NCAA 
Track and Field Championships, which begin today in Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
"Realistically, we're looking at a top-10 finish," UCLA Coach Bob Larsen said. 
"I don't think we're in the running for the top five." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, who won the NCAA meet in 1987 and '88 with overwhelming totals of 
81 and 82 points, respectively, have been hampered by injuries this season. 
</P>
<P>
Depth, however, isn't the determining factor in the NCAA meet, as it is in a 
dual meet or in the Pacific 10 Conference championships. 
</P>
<P>
To win at the NCAA level, a team must have athletes who are capable of 
finishing in at least the top three, taking advantage of the 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 
scoring formula. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins had such athletes -- Danny Everett, Kevin Young, Steve Lewis, Henry 
Thomas and the relay teams -- when they won those successive titles. 
</P>
<P>
Now, only Lewis, the gold medalist in the 400 meters at the 1988 Seoul Olympic 
Games, remains from that group. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis missed last year's NCAA meet and some earlier meets this year because of 
a hamstring injury. However, he won the 400 meters at the Pac-10 meet in 46.10 
seconds in windy conditions and is close to regaining his top form. 
</P>
<P>
Other Bruins with a reasonable chance to score are Brian Blutreich in the 
discus, John Knight in the hammer throw, Derek Knight in the 110-meter high 
hurdles, Mark Dani in the 5,000 meters and Mike Stevenson in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA did not qualify a relay team. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruin women have one of the favored teams. Janeene Vickers is the defending 
NCAA champion in the 400-meter hurdles and figures to score in the 100-meter 
hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Tracie Millett is favored to win the discus with a best mark of 190 feet 2 
inches and probably will be among the top three in the shotput. The Bruins are 
also favored in the 400-meter relay if Caryl Smith recovers from a hamstring 
injury she suffered in the Pac-10 meet. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman sprinter Angela Burnham could score in the 200 meters, as could Tonya 
Sedwick in the 400 meters and on the 1,600-meter relay team. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see it come down to the mile (1,600) relay with a healthy Caryl," 
Coach Bob Kersee said. "Then I would be as happy as anybody." 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA women finished second the past two years and haven't won since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
USC will have only five athletes in the men's competition. However, the Trojans 
could have a shot at finishing in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
George Porter is the defending champion in the 400-meter intermediate hurdles. 
Quincy Watts and Travis Hannah are capable of scoring in the 200 and 400 
meters, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Dietmar Haaf of West Germany also has a shot in the long jump if he regains the 
form he showed in winning the European Indoor championship last February with a 
jump of 26 feet 7 1/4 inches. However, he has had only one legal jump (25-2) 
during the outdoor season and fouled on all of his jumps in the Pac-10 meet. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Crear is considered one of the nation's top collegiate high hurdlers with 
a wind-aided time of 13.51 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The USC women will be represented by javelin thrower Ashley Selman and Leslie 
Maxie in the 400. Selman has the second best collegiate mark this year with a 
throw of 184-10. 
</P>
<P>
Maxie, an Olympian in the 400 hurdles, hasn't been able to compete in her 
specialty because of a hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
Houston's Leroy Burrell is regarded as the top individual performer in the meet 
at Wallace Wade Stadium on the campus of Duke University.

<P>
He has wind-aided times of 9.94 in the 100 meters and 19.61 in the 200, the 
latter the best-ever time under any conditions. He also has a 27-foot long 
jump. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana State, Texas A&amp;M, Florida, Arkansas, Baylor and Oregon are the 
favored teams in the men's division. UCLA's women will be challenged by 
Louisiana State, Texas, Arizona State and Florida. LSU's men and women are the 
defending champions. 
</P>
<P>
Track and Field Notes 
</P>
<P>
Qualifying begins today, with the first final, the women's 10,000 meters, 
scheduled Thursday night. . . . If there aren't enough athletes meeting an 
event's automatic standard or better, the field will be filled by those with 
the best provisional marks. For example, among UCLA's eight-man team, two 
athletes -- Eric Bergreen in the shotput and Peter Thompson in the discus -- 
are provisional qualifiers. 
</P>
<P>
Travis Hannah, in the 400, is the only provisional qualifier for USC. . . . The 
Trojans won the 1943 NCAA championship with only four athletes. USC has won a 
record 26 NCAA titles, the last in 1976. The Trojans finished first in 1978 but 
were stripped of the team title for using ineligible athletes. . . . UCLA is 
the runner-up in NCAA track and field titles with eight. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Barnes will make his next assault on his world record in the shotput next 
Tuesday in Milan, Italy. He has the two best throws ever, 75-10 1/4 and 75-9 
1/2. . . . Miler Steve Scott has abandoned plans to move up to the 5,000. "I 
don't like it, or the time it takes to train for it," Scott said. 
"Economically, it's better to be the 10th-ranked miler than being ranked second 
in the 5,000. More people relate to the mile."

Cal State Northridge's record for most hits in an NCAA Division II World Series 
game didn't last very long. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors established a record with 23 hits in their opener on Sunday and 
had 26 more Tuesday night in beating New Haven, 18-5, in a second-round game. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved Northridge to within two games of a championship. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge and Jacksonville (Ala.) State are the only undefeated teams left in 
what was an eight-team field. Four teams each have one loss. 
</P>
<P>
The University of New Haven and Lewis College will play today for the right to 
meet Northridge Thursday. Should Northridge (38-21) win that game -- it has 
already defeated each team by identical scores -- it would move into the 
championship game on Saturday at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Jacksonville is in a similar position in the other bracket. The 
Gamecocks defeated Tampa, 10-8, in Tuesday's early game. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Sims, Northridge's freshman catcher, had five hits, a career-high. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Clayton and Mike Solar each had four hits, two of Solar's being home 
runs. He has three homers in the two Northridge World Series Games. 
</P>
<P>
Denny Vigo and Kyle Washington had three hits each. MIKE HISERMAN

FOR NOW, JAY HOWELL GIVES UP STOPPER ROLE

Jay Howell temporarily relinquished his role as the Dodgers' bullpen stopper 
Tuesday after a meeting with Manager Tom Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
Howell said an agreement was reached that the Dodgers would not rush his 
comeback as long as he kept them informed of his ability to pitch. Howell had 
knee surgery April 24, then had 27 days of inactivity, and has been trying to 
come back ever since. The hastened comeback has resulted in stiffness in his 
right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Howell will probably remain on the major league roster and be used as the 11th 
pitcher until his strength returns. 
</P>
<P>
"It might take five innings, it might take 10 innings, I'm close, and I can 
finish this rehabilitation program on the major league level," Howell said. "I 
just wanted them to know that I'm not 100% yet; and to put me into the kind of 
situations that I have been put into lately . . . it's like asking somebody to 
drive while they are blind." 
</P>
<P>
Howell has pitched four times, all in pressure situations, since returning to 
the active roster May 18. He has two losses during that time while leaving one 
game after only two-thirds of an inning because of shoulder stiffness. Summoned 
from the bullpen to get the final out Monday, he allowed a walk and a 
game-winning single in a 6-5 comeback victory by the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
After that game, he complained that his shoulder wasn't ready for such an 
appearance. Tuesday, Lasorda heard those complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"I will never, ever subject a player to a situation that he doesn't feel 
physically comfortable in," Lasorda said after their meeting. "Even as bad as I 
want to win, I will never put a game ahead of a player's health." 
</P>
<P>
Howell admitted that, because of his love for pitching, he may have failed to 
properly inform the Dodgers of his inability to pitch at 100%. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a competitor, I want to be out there, so I'm as much at fault as anybody," 
Howell said. "I'll accept that."

CLIPPERTON ISLAND FISHING IS WORTH THE EXTRA MILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many in the business of long-range fishing believe that Clipperton Island is 
too unpredictable as a fishery and, given its distance of about 1,700 miles 
from San Diego, not worth the trip. Frank LoPreste is an exception. 
</P>
<P>
LoPreste, the only skipper to make the journey on a regular basis -- he has 
done so once a year for the last 10 years -- says the island's reputation is 
unjustified. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, there might be more sharks, which can devastate a tuna bite, at 
Clipperton than at another long-range destination of choice -- the 
Revillagigedo Islands, 550 miles to the north. And the chances of catching a 
300-pound yellowfin tuna, the objective of most fishermen, might not be as 
great. 
</P>
<P>
But judging by LoPreste's success, it would appear that some of San Diego's 
other boat operators have not given Clipperton a fair chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Clipperton is one of the most unusual places in the world -- a unique place to 
fish," LoPreste says. "Clipperton is different from most of your other islands. 
When you're at Clarion (one of the Revillagigedo chain) and you're catching 
fish from 80 to 250 pounds, you won't catch a 30-pounder. Whereas at 
Clipperton, you'll catch a 25-pounder and the next guy will catch a 
200-pounder." 
</P>
<P>
One fisherman on LoPreste's Royal Polaris, which returned from Clipperton 
Sunday, was dragged up and down the rail by what was believed to be a large 
tuna. When he finally got it to the boat, it turned out to be a 30-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't know it until they go, but Clipperton tuna are much tougher than 
the Revillagigedo tuna," LoPreste says. "They're not as oval-shaped as most 
yellowfin tuna are. They're much longer and leaner. The fat ones don't do as 
much of a job on you, not that they don't still hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica's George Jennings has made several trips to the Revillagigedos and 
has been on eight of LoPreste's 10 trips to Clipperton. 
</P>
<P>
"My experience has been that the fish seem to fight a lot harder than the ones 
up north," Jennings says. "A 100-pound fish at Clipperton is the equivalent of 
a 200-pound fish at the Revillagigedos." 
</P>
<P>
The Royal Polaris dropped off most of its passengers in Cabo San Lucas and 
pulled into Fisherman's Landing Sunday with its holds full for the seventh time 
in 10 visits to Clipperton. 
</P>
<P>
Its 22 passengers had accounted for 460 yellowfin tuna, many weighing more than 
100 pounds and several closer to 250. Also in the holds: 208 wahoo, 32 blue 
star jacks, 15 pargo, 217 rainbow runners, 38 Chinese masks (a seldom-caught 
member of the grouper family), 148 grouper and two amberjack. 
</P>
<P>
"We got back to Cabo San Lucas two days early," LoPreste said. "Some of the 
passengers flew home, and the others stuck around, using the boat as a hotel." 
</P>
<P>
The fishing industry is concerned about proposed federal legislation aimed at 
reducing the dangers of lead poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was introduced earlier this month by Sens. Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), 
Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.). The bill would ban the 
use of lead in the manufacture of products widely marketed and used by the 
sportfishing community, including sinkers, weights and other fishing tackle. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing weights containing 0.1% or more lead would be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
"That's all of them. We're almost pure lead," said Paul Moser of Woody 
Manufacturing in Gardena, which makes sinkers and weights for the fishing 
industry. "We'd be out of business." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dallas Minor of the Washington-based American Fishing Tackle Manufacturers 
Assn., which is fighting the legislation: "The way the bill is written, 
manufacturers would have just 12 months to remove their products from the 
market or find a substitute, and that's the killer. Some (in the fishing tackle 
industry) say if this bill passes, it's going to put them out of business. 
Other guys say that given the right kind of lead time, they would be willing to 
retool and find some substitute products. 
</P>
<P>
"Having a clean-water environment is in our best interest, too, but frankly 
there is no demonstrable evidence that I'm aware of that the odd lead sinker or 
jig or whatever that gets down to the bottom of the lake is going to end up in 
some kid." 
</P>
<P>
Lieberman expressed more concern over the dangers of lead in a recent news 
release, in which he said, "Lead is a persistent threat to generations of 
American children, and the sooner we act to eliminate the amount of lead that 
gets into the environment, the sooner we can improve the quality of life for 
millions of our citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Sportfishing boat operators are offering free trips to anyone turning in 
Department of Fish and Game tags from fish caught during a halibut research 
program in progress in the Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Landings at Redondo, Marina del Rey and Malibu will give half-day trips, and 
the First String at 22nd St. Landing in San Pedro will give full-day trips. 
Anglers are asked to tell when and where they caught the fish. 
</P>
<P>
The DFG also will redeem any tag for $5. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Frumkes is an independent biologist working with Prof. John Stephens of 
Occidental College on the Vantuna project, which has a grant from the Los 
Angeles County Fish and Game Commission to study halibut mortality in the bay. 
They hope to determine the effect of commercial gill-nets on sportfishing. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Frumkes' team, working with the DFG and volunteers, tagged 
more than 2,000 halibut caught and released into the bay. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
Recently approved as an all-tackle world record: an 11-pound 2-ounce vermillion 
rockfish, caught last October by La Habra's Steve Walker near San Nicolas 
Island. . . . Richard A. (Dick) Weaver of Loomis has been selected by the 
Outdoor Writers Assn. of California to receive its first Outdoor Californian of 
the Year award. Weaver, 64, performed important work with bighorn sheep and 
mountain lions during his 40 years as a wildlife biologist with the DFG. He 
retired last year. 
</P>
<P>
The first of California's two free fishing days -- no license required -- will 
be June 9, the second Sept. 22. . . . The Northeast Orange County Chapter of 
Ducks Unlimited will hold its eighth annual dinner fund-raiser -- including an 
auction and raffle of wildlife-related items -- June 6 at Los Coyotes Country 
Club in Buena Park. Information: (714) 738-5853. 
</P>
<P>
Whitbread Round-the-World Race highlights will be shown during an appearance by 
America's Cup sailor/TV commentator Gary Jobson at the Long Beach Marriott 
Hotel Thursday night at 7. Cost: $15. . . . New and used powerboats and 
sailboats will be displayed at the Marina del Rey Boat Show June 6-10 at Burton 
Chace Park.

L.A. RIVER COULD BECOME VITAL SOURCE OF RECREATION, ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As the setting sun sprays streamers of gold on the water, Red Cross boating 
instructor Denis Schure slides his 15-foot canoe into a Class 1 stream. 
Barreling downriver, Schure sees a mallard beat its wings before flying noisily 
out of a willow thicket. Overcome by the scene, Schure momentarily forgets that 
he is rolling on the . . . Los Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't this hard to believe?" he says. 
</P>
<P>
Hard indeed. The L.A. River isn't known as a nature lover's paradise. Most 
Angelenos regard it as nothing more than a junk-strewn sewer that meanders 
under smog-choked freeways. There is also widespread conjecture about the 
precise contents of the water -- when there actually is any water -- but 
officials do concede this: It won't kill you. 
</P>
<P>
As his canoe slices through the dark effluent, Schure is worried less about 
drinking the water than riding on it. His unauthorized canoe trip -- 
technically, he is trespassing -- is intended to demonstrate the viability of 
the river for water sports. Contrary to the river's image, he says, "It's 
feasible to have a satisfactory" boating experience on parts of the 
51-mile-long man-made drainage channel. 
</P>
<P>
Schure and other environmentalists are currently engaged in a three-way battle 
to determine the future of the river. They are backing a recent proposal by 
Mayor Tom Bradley to open the river for recreation and turn its concrete banks 
into tree-lined public parks. Bradley has appointed a task force to come up 
with a plan. 
</P>
<P>
On the opposite shore is Assemblyman Richard Katz, who wants to convert the 
river to an alternative freeway. He has a $100,000 grant from the L.A. County 
Transportation Commission to study the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Adrift in the middle of these warring forces is the Army Corps of Engineers, 
which built the river in the 1930s to control flooding. The engineers don't 
much like anyone tampering with their ditch -- if anything, they say, it needs 
upgrading -- and probably will have the final say on any project. 
</P>
<P>
It will take years of political and legal wrangling before any plan gets the 
green light. In the meantime, says Schure, an adviser with the mayor's task 
force, why not test the river's recreational potential right now, for very 
little money? Certain stretches of the river, he says, need nothing more than 
cosmetic improvements to resemble a real river once again. And there's a 
mile-long section in the Sepulveda Basin that can easily be dammed, he says, 
and turned into a lake. 
</P>
<P>
"All this could happen right away if we got official approval," says Schure, a 
45-year-old graphic designer who works for the city's Department of Planning 
and lives in Highland Park. 
</P>
<P>
Paddling under the Los Feliz Bridge, Schure is floating perhaps the prettiest 
part of the river -- the six miles or so between the Burbank end of Griffith 
Park and Dodger Stadium called "Frogtown." While most of the L.A. River is 
covered over by concrete -- about three million barrels -- the Army engineers 
had to leave Frogtown alone because of high levels of ground water. Today, the 
water runs deeper (two to three feet) and swifter (3 m.p.h.) than most people 
realize, even in times of drought. White boulders placed in the river by the 
engineers create riffles and atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the Kern, but it's still amazing, considering we're right in the 
middle of the city," Schure says. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the drought, surging water has been a rarity in recent years, 
allowing vegetation to gain a firm foothold in the sandy bottom of Frogtown. 
Willows, sycamores and even palms, 15 to 20 feet high in some spots, are here 
to stay. The trees provide cover for thousands of migrating birds and are home 
to great blue heron and snowy egrets. And with the rushing current, it's almost 
difficult to hear the rumbling Golden State Freeway, which runs parallel to the 
river through most of Frogtown. 
</P>
<P>
While nature has treated Frogtown well, man has violated it. Broken glass, 
Styrofoam cups, high-tension wires and huge graffiti tableaux are everywhere, 
painful reminders that the river runs through an urban wilderness. Debris -- 
tossed in the water upstream or discharged through some of the river's 700 
unregulated storm drains -- get caught up in the vegetation. Barbed wire keeps 
the public out. 
</P>
<P>
But man, Schure says, can also undo the damage. Frogtown -- as well as the 
Sepulveda Basin, which also has a sandy bottom -- could be cleaned by volunteer 
workers. "Controls for access and safety could be put in place quickly," he 
says, adding a warning: "But right now, it's totally inappropriate for kids to 
be on the river." 
</P>
<P>
Schure also says there is no shortage of volunteers. He belongs to several 
environmental groups, including Friends of the L.A. River, a five-year-old 
organization that has been spearheading the river-greening movement. 
</P>
<P>
"We look at it as a living river," says filmmaker Lewis MacAdams, a founder the 
Friends. "Much of it has been neglected for so long. And it's an aberration 
that people hate a river." 
</P>
<P>
Last Earth Day, the Friends held the "first annual L.A. River Regatta" in 
conjunction with the Sierra Club and the San Francisco-based Friends of the 
River. A flotilla of dinghies, canoes and rafts floated from Riverside Drive in 
Burbank to Griffith Park. Participating were more than 200 people, including 
State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), an advocate of using the river for 
recreation. 
</P>
<P>
Before being issued a permit by the city, organizers of the regatta had to 
obtain $1 million in liability insurance. And that's another problem in putting 
people on the river: Who's responsible if they drown or become sick by 
accidentally ingesting the water? The answer is somewhat murky, although it 
will probably become clearer as studies are done and hearings are held. 
</P>
<P>
The river begins in the southwest San Fernando Valley where Bell and Calabasas 
creeks converge. Runoff from mountains, including 5,000-foot Mt. Lukens above 
Verdugo Hills, also contributes to the flow and gives the river what Schure 
calls "a respectable vertical drop." But except when it rains, the bulk of the 
river's water in the Valley comes from the Tillman Water Reclamation Plant in 
the Sepulveda Basin. The plant releases 40 million gallons a day, a quantity 
that will double in a year, increasing the current. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the recreation plan point out the dangers to boaters of 
flash-flooding brought on by a heavy rainstorm. Even Schure concedes, "If it 
rains, the river is a deadly place to be." But major flooding is rare. 
According to a spokesperson for the Department of Water and Power, the last 
major flash flood occurred in 1980; at one location on the river, the channel 
was at 88% of capacity, the water level reached 17 feet and the flow hit 17 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to go down the river in a flood," MacAdams says, "but most of 
the time, the river is pretty benign." 
</P>
<P>
As the sun slips behind a mountain in Griffith Park, Schure finishes his river 
trip and portages his canoe over the concrete embankment to his car. He shakes 
his head. "Like a lot of people," he says, "I've been driving across the L.A. 
River for years, wondering, What are the possibilities (for recreation)? 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I see that it's very possible."

MISTER FRISKY DOUBTFUL FOR THE BELMONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Baltimore Sun 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mister Frisky has developed a respiratory problem that probably will keep him 
out of the Belmont Stakes June 9, trainer Laz Barrera said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky, who went into the Kentucky Derby unbeaten, ran eighth to 
Unbridled as odds-on choice and then ran third to Summer Squall as third choice 
in the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
"He's had a temperature and he's been sick over the weekend," Barrera said. 
"We're going to bring in a specialist in respiratory problems to look at him 
tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't think he could run in the Belmont even if he's OK tomorrow. He's 
been treated with medication that has Procaine in it and that stays in a 
horse's system sometimes for 15 days." 
</P>
<P>
It is illegal for a horse to race with such medication in its system. 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky, whose winning streak had included the Santa Anita Derby, 
probably will go to California for a rest, Barrera said. 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky was expected to be one of three starters in the Belmont with 
eligibility to earn a $1 million bonus for the best performance in the Triple 
Crown. But with Mister Frisky apparently sidelined, that means only Unbridled 
and Land Rush could earn the bonus, which is decided on a 5-3-1 point basis. 
Unbridled needs only to start and finish to earn the prize. For Land Rush to 
earn it, he would have to finish third to earn at least one point and Unbridled 
would have to skip the race. 
</P>
<P>
Land Rush, seventh in the Derby and sixth in the Preakness, probably will be 
the only Belmont Stakes starter for trainer Wayne Lukas, who is on a winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas won major races on both coasts Memorial Day. His son, Jeff, saddled 
Criminal Type to win the $595,000 Metropolitan Mile at Belmont Park over 
Housebuster and Easy Goer, and Lukas himself was with Steinlen, who won the 
$500,000 Hollywood Turf Handicap over Hawkster at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
So far in 1990, Lukas-trained horses have earned $6.7 million. He is on a pace 
to beat his record of $17.8 million, set in 1988. Lukas has led the nation's 
trainers, based on money earned by their horses, for the past seven years.

HARBOR BEATS CHABOT FOR THIRD STATE TITLE 
</P>

Harbor College won its third state title Tuesday by defeating Chabot, 5-2, at 
the California Community College Baseball Championships. The Seahawks went 
undefeated in the four-team, double-elimination tournament at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"We put a lot of pressure on ourselves from Day 1," said Harbor Coach Jim 
O'Brien, who has led the Seahawks to the state tournament eight times in 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"We had one goal in mind, to win state, and we would not have been happy with 
anything less." 
</P>
<P>
Harbor left-hander John Ingram (8-0) went the distance, giving up eight hits 
and one earned run. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor (51-5) scored two runs in the fifth inning, on a sacrifice fly by Mike 
Berry and shortstop Aaron Ledesma's throwing error. Ledesma, an All-American 
freshman, made three of the Gladiators' six errors. 
</P>
<P>
Ledesma's error in the seventh inning allowed Berry to get on base and 
eventually score on an error by catcher Corey Quinn. Harbor scored its last two 
runs against reliever John Harris in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Chabot's Norm Montoya (7-1) pitched seven innings, giving up five hits and one 
earned run. Chabot finished at 43-12-1.

NEWSWIRE: N.C. STATE TOLD TO PAY $365,180 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
North Carolina State has been ordered to repay $365,180 to the NCAA because 
Charles Shackleford, a former Wolfpack basketball player, accepted money while 
playing for the school. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of the repayment is 90% of N.C. State's net earnings from the 1987 
and 1988 NCAA tournaments, played during Shackleford's sophomore and junior 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Repayment to the NCAA will come from money raised by the athletic department, 
such as revenue from ticket sales and television contracts, said Harold B. 
Hopfenberg, N.C. State athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Shackleford admitted accepting more than $60,000 from two men 
during his final two years at N.C. State. He said one payment had been from a 
sports agent seeking to represent him, and the other a loan that he since has 
repaid.

But SDSU catcher Eric Christopherson, expected to be a first-round draft choice 
in June, was not named to the first team. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU's Jeff Barry was one of only three repeat choices. Barry, a junior 
outfielder from Medford, Ore., batted .320. He was joined by shortstop Brian 
Grebeck (.332) and pitcher Kurt Archer (9-2, 2.13). 
</P>
<P>
Christopherson and infielder Scott Dennison and outfielder Anthony Johnson were 
named to the second team. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Aztec baseball team finished 17th in the national top 25 selected by 
Baseball America. SDSU (49-22) moved up from 22nd the previous week. Stanford, 
which defeated SDSU for the championship of the NCAA West I Regional, remained

GROSSMONT HAS RECORDS, WANTS 2-A TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Grossmont High is preparing more than two pages of statistics from its 1990 
season for the San Diego Section record book. 
</P>
<P>
The Foothillers have set single-season records for runs scored (309), hits 
(318) and victories (28) and are close to setting season marks for on-base 
percentage, batting average, RBIs and stolen bases. Grossmont catcher Todd 
Cady, only a junior, has shattered the single-season RBI record with 61 -- the 
old mark was 47 by Jeff Meyers of Carlsbad -- and barring injury is sure to set 
career records in RBIs, homers and hits. 
</P>
<P>
But Coach Jeff Meredith and his team would undoubtedly give all of this up for 
a place on page 2, where the 2-A team champions are listed. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Grossmont earned a spot there but under the heading "runner-up" -- 
the Foothillers lost to Carlsbad in the section final, 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, when we got there, nobody thought we'd be there," Meredith said. 
"We were up-tight and lost." 
</P>
<P>
This season, Grossmont has lost but two games and has been ranked at or near 
the top of every poll since mid-eason. So it would seem the Foothillers would 
have a tendency to be up-tight again. Meredith says no. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the pressure is on us," he said. "We already handled the 
pressure in coming from behind our last two games (against Escondido and San 
Pasqual). We've got an experienced team. Most of these guys have now been 
through two years of this." 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont's opponent at 3:30 p.m. today at the University of San Diego -- 
third-seeded San Diego -- also knows pressure. Its past six games, including 
three in the playoffs, have been must-win. The Cavers had to win their last 
three regular season games to take the City Central League title. They have won 
nine of their past 11. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego came back from an 8-0 deficit to defeat Madison, 9-8. It also 
rebounded from a 4-1 fifth-inning deficit to beat Coronado, 5-4, in the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
The key to Grossmont's season has been its bats (.367 average) and an 
underrated pitching staff (2.96 ERA). San Diego (20-7) has won on experience -- 
seven senior starters -- and togetherness. 
</P>
<P>
Josh Stepner, San Diego's top hitter and pitcher -- .386 average, seven homers, 
7-1 record -- said this year's team has been a happy family compared to last 
year's. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we had guys sitting on the bench talking about other things -- not 
even thinking about baseball," Stepner said. "This year, there are no selfish 
players on the team." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Tom Lopez said improvement personally is one reason for San Diego's 
turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't a very good coach last year," he said. "I had some personal problems, 
and I let it affect my coaching. I made up my mind to change things this year, 
and I've had my best coaching year." 
</P>
<P>
Stepner is expected to get the pitching start today against Grossmont's Dan 
Lennon (10-1, two saves, 3.25 ERA). 
</P>
<P>
The last time Stepner faced Grossmont, he was knocked around for five runs, but 
he came back to beat the Foothillers with his bat -- hitting a three-run homer 
in the bottom of the seventh that gave San Diego a 6-5 victory in the second 
game of the Lions Tournament. It was Grossmont's last loss. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont will be without first baseman Jim Earley (.436, 5 homers, 24 RBIs), 
who broke his foot before the playoffs began, and Lenny Van Every (.414, 14 
stolen bases), who was ruled academically ineligible three weeks ago. But 
outfielder Jason Eckridge (.328), who was suspended for a game after running 
into Escondido's catcher, will be back.

Bad Signs: The stars won't shine on the upcoming summit, predicts Joan Quigley,

President Ronald Reagan's jet to take off and his meetings with Soviet

King Olav, 86.

No Hate: Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) has clarified his views about homosexuals. 
"I was taught from the time I was a little boy to hate the sin and love the

conduct themselves makes the second half of that mighty difficult sometimes." 
He objects to the use of the word gay to describe homosexuals, saying, "I 
resent the corruption of a very fine word." Compiled by YEMI TOURE

JACK SMITH: SNAKING THROUGH CAIRO'S CHURCHES AND TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our tour group was taking a side trip to Alexandria. I decided to stay in 
Cairo. Since the famous library of ancient Alexandria had been destroyed, I had 
no interest in what was, essentially, a modern city. 
</P>
<P>
I spent the morning going about Cairo by taxi, which didn't get me into too 
much trouble. As good a group as we were in, I had to go out on my own now and 
then to have a sense of adventure. 
</P>
<P>
It was a three-hour bus ride to Alexandria. The minute my wife walked into our 
hotel room she was sick. They had had an Egyptian lunch aboard a boat in 
Alexandria; I suspected it was something she ate; either that or it was the 
Coke we had drunk at King Tut's tomb. There might be something in that famous 
King Tut's curse. 
</P>
<P>
Some friends on the tour had Egyptian friends, and we had been invited with 
them to dinner in a private apartment. We didn't want to miss it. Our Egyptian 
friends were most gracious. According to custom, the sumptuous buffet was not 
served until about 11:30. My wife was too ill to eat and we had to be driven 
home. Our host, a medical doctor, had given her a pill, and by morning she was 
OK. 
</P>
<P>
We went shopping the next day in Khan El Khalisi Bazaar, a labyrinthine quarter 
of shops in which I was afraid of getting lost. My wife bought five T-shirts 
for our grandchildren, a transaction that took at least half an hour and 
involved the unfolding and display of dozens of shirts. We had lunch in the 
bazaar, which was notable by the fact that, in keeping with Muslim tradition, 
they did not serve wine or beer. Fortunately, my health did not suffer. 
</P>
<P>
The next day we went to the Coptic museum. I was not in the mood for another 
museum. The Copts are members of an ancient Christian sect that still practice 
their faith, though a minority, in Egypt. The museum was full of fine reliefs 
and frescoes reflecting the Coptic theology. 
</P>
<P>
I was especially engaged by a fresco of Adam and Eve. It showed them before and 
after the fall. In the first version Eve was naked. So was Adam. Standing 
beside them the two were depicted after the fall. Both were covered by leaves. 
A snake was whispering into Eve's ear. Oddly, her eyes now looked like 
Elizabeth Taylor's in "Cleopatra." 
</P>
<P>
I tired of Coptic art, though, and we decided to take a cab back to the hotel 
with a woman in our group who wanted to go. It was a cab ride not to be 
forgotten. There seem to be no rules. It is every man for himself. Drivers miss 
one another by inches. There are no lanes. Major intersections were locked 
tight. There are few traffic lights, and they evidently are hand operated. A 
traffic officer in the usual white uniform stood on a corner, regarding one 
massive traffic jam with what appeared to be bland curiosity. Finally he 
stepped out into the morass, put up a hand, and gradually made order out of 
chaos. The cab had no seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
If one reason for traveling is a thrill, we had had it. 
</P>
<P>
That evening at dinner we got good news. Our bus would leave for the airport at 
7:15 p.m., our El Al flight to Tel Aviv would be at 9:45. It would take an hour 
or so. We looked forward to an early bed. 
</P>
<P>
El Al is noted for its security, and one cannot blame them. When we cleared our 
bags at the airport they did not body search us, but they questioned us 
aggressively, and hand-searched each of our bags. They asked if we had left our 
bags alone at any time; if we had received any gifts. I worried about the time 
our bags were untended in the hotel hallway. But the hand-search reassured me. 
My wife remembered that she had left her carry-on bag untended for a few 
minutes. Conscientiously she searched it. 
</P>
<P>
The strenuousness of the search reminded us that we were entering a country 
that is surrounded by enemies, and lives in constant tension. 
</P>
<P>
We got to bed late and got up early. The next day we were to visit the Dead 
Sea, Massada and Jerusalem, among other stops. On the road we passed several 
combat vehicles. And soldiers, men and women both, were often in evidence, 
though there seemed to be no emergency. 
</P>
<P>
The Dead Sea was serene and blue in its desert valley west of the Jordan Hills. 
We had lunch at the Hod Hotel and some went swimming in the sea. 
</P>
<P>
I was content to lie in a deck chair at the end of the little pier and wonder 
what I was doing there.

ITALIAN FARE WITHOUT THE SPICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everything pointed to an evening of happily ever after: Eduardo de Filippo's 
very funny Neapolitan play "Filumena" (on which was based the very funny movie 
"Marriage, Italian Style"), staged by savvy director David Galligan, with the 
unflappable Karen Kondazian terrorizing the neighborhood in the title role. A 
confluence of talents made in heaven? 
</P>
<P>
More like purgatory. The ingredients certainly are there at the Court Theatre 
(where the show is running, and which also happens to be one of Los Angeles' 
more attractive smaller houses), but someone neglected to mix and stir. Or at 
least didn't mix and stir enough. 
</P>
<P>
We start with Filumena and her lover of 25 years, Don Domenico, quarreling over 
the fact that he wants to throw her over for a younger woman -- unleashing 
World War III. It takes them all three acts to resolve their differences and 
the production, not unlike the warring partners, takes at least as long to hit 
its stride. 
</P>
<P>
Let's face it: There isn't much there to begin with. Filumena, the 
ex-prostitute with the big mouth and the heart of gold, is about to be 
discarded like an old shoe by her chauvinistic common-law husband, Don Domenico 
(Jorge Rivera). She must think on her feet. How can she win him back and make 
sure she keeps him? Partly by exercising squatters' rights and mostly by 
dangling an unexpected carrot under his turned up nose. 
</P>
<P>
Filumena may not have personal property beyond her well-endowed physical 
attributes, but she does have three sons Don Domenico knows nothing about, one 
of whom -- as she now delights in telling him -- is his. Which one? That's 
Filumena's trump card. The rest of the play is dedicated to tormenting Don 
Domenico until he decides to take on all three by marrying their mother. 
</P>
<P>
It's a sweet, simple, exasperating idea, that De Filippo embellished by 
drenching it in a boisterous Neapolitan atmosphere, milking the fiery Southern 
Italian temperament for all its worth, and giving the wily underdog -- Filumena 
-- the distinctly upper hand. Guess who wins in the end. 
</P>
<P>
The "seconds" in this duel of wits and vocal chords are Don Domenico's huffing 
and puffing henchman, Alfredo (Ernest Sarracino, who created the role on 
Broadway in 1980), and Filumena's trouble-shooting elderly protegee, Rosalia 
(Argentina Brunetti). The sworn villains are Don Domenico's younger intended, 
Diana (an insinuating Gina Gallego), and her untrustworthy lawyer (Milton 
James). They lose. 
</P>
<P>
It all should have worked like gangbusters in the niftily overstated Italianate 
setting by Deborah Raymond and Dorian Vernacchio -- an expansively 
high-ceilinged circular room that opens onto the Court's natural courtyard. But 
from the start, the timing keeps missing its beats, the angers are overworked, 
the Neapolitan fire keeps needing to be fanned and, time and again, this comedy 
slides off the track. 
</P>
<P>
Just why this happens lies in a misplaced gentility that grips the cast. 
Sarracino and Brunetti go through the right motions without the right spirited 
emotions. Rivera is too distinguished for the philandering Don and his yelling 
and screaming remain inappropriately dignified. Kondazian, too, is 
uncharacteristically subdued -- not quiet, but not brash or comfortable in 
Filumena's skin. Where is this woman's bravura or her checkered past? 
</P>
<P>
Only when the three grown sons enter the picture do things begin to pick up. 
These are gentle, motivated young men who quite undo the hopelessly flustered 
Domenico. And the actors playing them give distinct and winning performances: 
Tom Astor as the elegant Umberto, Joseph Fidelibus as the shy Riccardo and 
Nathan Holland as the married Michele. Rivera, too, is better equipped to 
handle the transformation and torment that overtake their "father," as he 
wonders which of the three is his own flesh and blood. 
</P>
<P>
But the production has trouble shaking a superimposed sense of travelogue ("And 
now, folks, here we are in Naples . . . "). It is as if director Galligan went 
for the trappings when he couldn't quite get the performances out of his 
principal actors. Is it that Americans, however much descended they may be from 
Europeans, cannot match them, rowdiness for rowdiness? Unlikely. For one thing, 
the production does come together in a noisy third act exchange between 
Filumena and her dressmaker/confidante, Teresina (played on all the right notes 
by Francesca Vetrano, whose name suggests she knows a thing or two about being 
Italian). Vetrano finalmente breaks the ice. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, it's very late by then. Comedy is a fragile thing, farcical 
comedy even more so, and ethnic farce -- which is so dependent on flavor -- 
nearly impossible. This is apparently a case in point. Perhaps as the actors 
warm up to their roles. . . ? Perhaps. But that's pure speculation.

'BACK TO FUTURE III' A FAST DRAW AGAINST 'FIRE BIRDS'; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: MEMORIAL WEEKEND OPENING IS NO CONTEST. 'FUTURE III' TAKES $23.7 
MILLION, WHILE 'BIRDS' TAKES $6.3 MILLION.

<P>
In the third installment of the adventures of time-traveling teen Marty McFly, 
the pint-size hero -- played by Michael J. Fox -- winds up in the Old West 
where he puts his sharp shooting skills (honed on video games) to use against 
villainous varmints. 
</P>
<P>
At the weekend box office, the diminutive hombre also faced a square-off. But 
it was no contest: When the dust had settled, McFly -- and Universal Pictures' 
"Back to the Future III" -- had easily taken down Touchstone Pictures' "Fire 
Birds," an action-drama about Apache attack helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
"Back to the Future III," had ticket sales of $23.7 million over the four-day 
Memorial Day weekend -- the official blast-off of the high-stakes summer movie 
sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Fire Birds," the week's only other major new title, earned $6.3 million, for 
fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
"Bird on a Wire," in its second week, proved it has wings. Starring Mel Gibson 
and Goldie Hawn, the critically lambasted Universal Pictures action-comedy 
earned another $12.7 million in ticket sales -- following a startling 
$15.3-million opening weekend. 
</P>
<P>
And "Pretty Woman" continues to show great legs: In its 10th week, Touchstone 
Pictures' romantic comedy about love with the proper hooker earned another $8.1 
million. It has now grossed more than $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, despite its critical drubbing, Orion Pictures' "Cadillac Man" is 
staying on course -- fueled by the star power of Robin Williams -- with ticket 
sales of $6.4 million, for fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
The "Back to the Future" opening -- among the top 10 in the Memorial Day record 
books -- was an auspicious kick-off for what is presumably the final 
installment in the Steven Spielberg-produced series, which was launched in 1985 
and later continued in November, 1989. ("Back to the Future II" and "III" were 
filmed back-to-back. "Future II" ends with coming attractions scenes from 
"Future III.") 
</P>
<P>
Domestically, "Back to the Future" and "Future II" have grossed $324 million, 
with "Future I" significantly out-earning "Future II." ("Future I" had receipts 
of$208 million; "Future II" grossed $116.4 million.) 
</P>
<P>
But "Future II" had a bigger opening weekend than both "Future I" (which earned 
$14.9 million over five days, when it was released on July 3, 1985) and the 
just-out "Future III." Released on the Wednesday preceding Thanksgiving, 1989, 
"Future II" had a five-day total of $43 million. But a critical clobbering and 
poor word-of-mouth took a toll. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry analysts are predicting that "III," which opened with much more 
positive reviews, may go on to out-earn "II." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the opening weekend performance of "Future III" pales compared to last 
year at this same time, when "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Paramount 
Pictures' third and final installment in its hit series, opened with ticket 
sales of $46.9 million in its first six days. 
</P>
<P>
But, noted John N. Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Inc., which 
tabulates box office figures, "this doesn't mean that the current box office 
isn't up to par with last year's." To the contrary, stressed Krier, "there are 
presently more titles performing well -- rather than a single, dominating 
title." 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the week's Top 10: "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" (New Line 
Cinema), $2.9 million, $118 million cumulative; "The Hunt for Red October" 
(Paramount Pictures), $2.1 million, $110.8 million cumulative; "Tales From the 
Darkside" (Paramount Pictures), $1.6 million, $14.5 million cumulative; "Joe 
Vs. the Volcano" (Warner Bros.), $821,125, $37.5 million cumulative; "Spaced 
Invaders" (Touchstone Pictures), $734,724, $13.6 million cumulative. 
</P>
<P>
In limited release at only two theaters in Los Angeles, Castle Hill's romantic 
drama, "Torn Apart," earned $25,120. 
</P>
<P>
As for the future of "Back to the Future III," it will depend, in part, on the 
box office muscle of Tri-Star Pictures' futuristic saga, "Total Recall." 
Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, it opens on Friday.

Pit Bull News: Executives at a Denver television station have defended their 
staff's videotaping of an illegal pit bull fight as "legitimate news-gathering 
activities." KCNC-TV General Manager Roger Ogden said station employees who 
attended and videotaped a fight in September didn't realize at the time that it 
was illegal. The station and police agencies began an investigation this month 
after allegations were made by anonymous sources that KCNC staged a fight 
between two dogs for reporter Wendy Bergen's series. GREG BRAXTON

NEA Study Commission Meets: The belated first meeting of the Independent 
Commission on the Arts and Humanities -- established by Congress last year to 
conduct a broad inquiry into procedures of the National Endowment for the Arts 
and National Endowment for the Humanities -- will be held next Wednesday in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-member commission, which does not yet have a staff, originally was to 
have completed its work by now when it was set up last fall. Delays in the 
naming of its members by the White House caused the commission to fall badly 
behind schedule. No revised timetable for its recommendations has been set.

Henson Film Applauded: The late Muppet creator Jim Henson's movie "The 
Witches," about a dastardly scheme to turn children into mice, won him 
posthumous plaudits Thursday from London critics. 
</P>
<P>
The movie stars Anjelica Huston as the head witch. "It leaves us a testament to 
the glory that was Jim Henson," Nigel Andrews wrote in the Financial Times. 
Annabel Llywelyn-Cowper, who described herself as high priestess of two English 
covens, wrote in the Independent that the film's effects were admirable but 
that it perpetuated the "tired old theme (of) the witch as loathsome creature 
hellbent on destroying young lives." It opens in the United States in the fall.

Freed hostage Frank H. Reed urged a crowd of several thousand in Malden, Mass., 
to remember those still held captive in the Middle East as he spoke at a 
homecoming celebration. He was joined by his wife and other relatives in front 
of City Hall. Reed, 57, head of the Lebanese International School when gunmen 
abducted him in 1986, said he was torn between the desire to stay close to home 
and the urge to publicize the plights of the remaining 16 Western hostages.

CITY SECTION 4-A DIVISION BASEBALL CHAMIONSHIP; 
</P>
<P>
IN THE GROOVE FOR 18 YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
TITLES: CHATSWORTH OR EL CAMINO REAL WILL EXTEND THE VALLEY'S LONG-PLAYING 
RECORD OF CITY BASEBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 18 years, Valley teams have made an extended Victory Tour out of the City 
Section 4-A Division baseball final. And the smash hits keep coming, as fresh 
and exhilarating as ever, live from Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a different band of Valley ballplayers every year since 1973, but 
they never miss a beat. They usually provide heavy metal and rap but some years 
deliver only soft pop. Good old country hardball is often part of the set. 
</P>
<P>
The only certainty is the encore, a spirited rendition of "We Are the 
Champions." 
</P>
<P>
Either El Camino Real or Chatsworth will pick up the chorus tonight. 
</P>
<P>
A look at the previous 17 championships, accompanied by hit songs that help 
bring back memories of each year: 
</P>
<P>
1973: Sylmar 3, Kennedy 2 
</P>
<P>
LIVING FOR THE CITY (Stevie Wonder): Sylmar was down to its last gasp. Kennedy, 
which had defeated the Spartans three times in the regular season, led, 2-1, 
with two out in the seventh, no one on base and two strikes on pinch-hitter 
Gary Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence drew a walk, however, and pinch-runner Dale O'Brien stole second. 
Chuck Lyon drilled the next pitch into right-center to force extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, John Syers' arm was dying. The Sylmar pitcher had won all three 
previous playoff games in relief, and he went all the way in the final. "He was 
telling us in the dugout, 'Guys, score some runs because I'm not going to make 
it much longer," recalled Lyon, Sylmar's center fielder. 
</P>
<P>
Upstart Kennedy, in only its second year of existence, was riding the arm of 
pitcher Jeff Jens and the glove of shortstop Jim Anderson, who went on to play 
for the California Angels. Jens tired before Syers, however, and Rich Kochie's 
run-scoring single in the ninth won it for Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
1974: Monroe 9, Taft 8 
</P>
<P>
DIAMOND DOGS (David Bowie): As he had with his City champion 1971 team, Monroe 
Coach Denny Holt took a collection of mangy mongrels and turned them into a 
fierce pack of win-hungry wolves. They had no fear of favored Taft, which had 
future major leaguer Kelly Paris at shortstop and fireballing Dave Aronow on 
the mound. 
</P>
<P>
"Monroe had no huge stars, but they were fundamentally sound. They did not make 
mistakes," recalled Harry Frum, Monroe's football coach at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Aronow had pitched a no-hitter in the quarterfinals but he could not hold down 
a Monroe lineup that included All-City catcher Roger Slater, shortstop Don 
Kuhnhoff and outfielder Keith Walker. 
</P>
<P>
1975: Granada Hills 4, 
</P>
<P>
Westchester 3 
</P>
<P>
NEW KID IN TOWN (Eagles): Coach Darryl Stroh won his first of five 
championships in bold fashion. Squeeze bunts with two strikes tied the score in 
the sixth and won the game in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"With two strikes, your average drops 100 to 150 points, but our guys could 
bunt eight out of 10," Stroh reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
Duane Rice, who scored or drove in all four Granada Hills runs, laid down the 
squeeze in the sixth and opened the eighth with a single. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Fuentes followed with a bunt single, Dave Schmidt (now with the Montreal 
Expos) advanced the runners with a sacrifice bunt and, after an intentional 
walk to Pat Rubino, Bill Douglas executed the winning squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
1976: Granada Hills 2, Monroe 1 
</P>
<P>
BACK IN THE SADDLE (Aerosmith): Dave Cicero pitched a two-hitter to outduel 
Scott Olshane and give Granada Hills its second title in a row. It was no sure 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders began the season 1-6 before winning eight in a row to qualify 
for the playoffs. "We squeaked in," Stroh said. 
</P>
<P>
Olshane gave Monroe a tremendous performance, but a two-run single by second 
baseman Ron Oddo in the fourth inning was all the cushion Cicero needed. 
</P>
<P>
1977: Cleveland 5, Carson 4 
</P>
<P>
NIGHT MOVES (Bob Seger): The score was tied, 4-4, in the bottom of the seventh 
and Cleveland's Paul Romero hesitated rounding third. There had been a passed 
ball with Romero on second, and, realizing the distance from the backstop to 
home plate, Coach Dave Preciado frantically waved Romero home. 
</P>
<P>
The pitcher covered the plate and caught the throw before Romero got there. 
There was a collision . . . 
</P>
<P>
Good thing for Cleveland that Romero was a 5-foot-9, 197-pound catcher who had 
been an All-City linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
"He made a headfirst rolling block," recalled Marty Siegel, a Cleveland 
assistant. "The ball was lying on the ground and the umpire called him safe." 
</P>
<P>
Nine of the 13 Cleveland players also were members of the football team that 
had been demolished by Banning, 34-0, in the City 4-A final the previous fall. 
"Our idea was, we blew the football title, but we won't blow the baseball 
title," Siegel said. "That determination made the difference." 
</P>
<P>
1978: Granada Hills 4, Poly 2 
</P>
<P>
RUNNING ON EMPTY (Jackson Browne): Poly (23-2) was unable to use ace Matt Elser 
(13-0), who had pitched a complete game two days earlier in the semifinals. 
Granada Hills (21-1) had more depth -- nine Highlanders went on to play college 
or professional ball. 
</P>
<P>
Stroh gave the start to Mike DiGiacomo, an excellent control pitcher, because 
he had pitched a no-hitter against Poly earlier in the season. "He had elbow 
problems, though, and just gutted it out," Stroh said. 
</P>
<P>
Poly loaded the bases in the sixth but a sharp ground ball by Randy Ebersberger 
was flagged by third baseman Bernie Forbes, who stepped on third and threw home 
in the dirt. Catcher Jim Tognozzi dug the ball out and applied the tag for a 
double play. 
</P>
<P>
1979: Granada Hills 10, 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw 4 
</P>
<P>
STOP YOUR SOBBING (Pretenders): There sat Crenshaw pitcher Darryl Strawberry, 
red-faced from slipping while fielding a squeeze bunt. "While he laid there 
pounding his glove on the ground, our runner from second scored too," recalled 
Stroh, who secured his fourth City title in five years. 
</P>
<P>
Highlander starter John Stevens appeared to run out of gas in the third inning, 
and when he visited the mound, Stroh could not avoid the glare of his third 
baseman, John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
"John gave me a look like, 'What are you waiting for?' " Stroh recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Elway had not pitched since an early-season outing in which he walked six and 
hit three batters. Yet he allowed Crenshaw only two hits the rest of the way 
and struck out future major leaguer Chris Brown for the final out. 
</P>
<P>
1980: Sylmar 6, 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood 2 
</P>
<P>
HUNGRY HEART (Bruce Springsteen): A group of Sylmar players who had advanced to 
the Pony League World Series four years earlier combined to win a championship 
in their final year together. The Sylmar coach, Denny Thompson, had played in 
the same youth league -- Sylmar Independent -- as had most of his players. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Salazar did the pitching -- hurling a three-hitter -- and Oscar Mejia did 
the hitting -- going three for four. 
</P>
<P>
1981: Kennedy 4, Banning 2 
</P>
<P>
START ME UP (Rolling Stones): Like so many pitchers in the City playoffs, 
Kennedy's Jeff Wetherby was virtually spent by the time the team reached the 
final. Still, coaxed on by catcher Phil Lombardi, Wetherby allowed only one hit 
before his control gave out in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Don Tamburro brought on Jack McDonnell, a seldom-used pitcher, to save 
Wetherby's victory and give Kennedy its first championship. 
</P>
<P>
1982: Cleveland 13, Palisades 0 
</P>
<P>
FREEZE-FRAME (J. Geils): Tom Brandt is finally off the hook. All these years 
the Cleveland second baseman has been saddled with the indignity of ruining 
Bret Saberhagen's perfect game by committing a first-inning error that allowed 
the only Palisades batter to reach base. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Brandt preserved the no-hitter with the play, diving to his left to 
smother the ground ball and making a throw to first in time for the out. First 
baseman Mark Markland, however, dropped the throw. "Markland said in the 
dugout, 'Coach, I just missed it,' " recalled Leo Castro, the Cleveland coach. 
"For some reason, the official scorekeeper gave the error to Brandt." 
</P>
<P>
Two defensive gems were needed later in the game. The first batter in the 
seventh smacked a ground ball to the right of left-handed John La Rosa, who had 
replaced the right-handed Markland at first. La Rosa dived to stop the ball and 
threw to Saberhagen covering the bag. 
</P>
<P>
"Putting La Rosa in there looked like a genius move but actually I was just 
emptying the bench," Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
The next batter laid down a bunt. Catcher Glenn Newhouse pounced on the ball 
and threw out the runner by a step. "That was the play of the game," Castro 
said. 
</P>
<P>
1983: Chatsworth 8, Sylmar 7 
</P>
<P>
SWEET DREAMS (ARE MADE OF THIS) (Eurythmics): Chatsworth was carried to the 
final on the arms of pitchers Keith Nicholson and Steve Reed. Two-run doubles 
by Pete Kuld and Nicholson staked Chatsworth to a big lead, but Sylmar rallied 
from an 8-2 deficit against Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans closed to 8-7 on a double by Dana Ridenour in the fifth before 
Chatsworth Coach Bob Lofrano summoned Reed with two out. "He shut the door," 
Lofrano recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, who had 29 saves last year in the Class-A Midwest League, retired seven 
of the nine batters he faced to preserve the win. 
</P>
<P>
1984: Granada Hills 15, 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real 4 
</P>
<P>
JUMP (Van Halen): The Highlanders won their fifth title under Stroh and set a 
championship-game record for runs. Four sophomores -- Greg Fowble, Dan 
Takahashi, Rob Tosti and Bob Allen -- played major roles. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Halcovich and Fred Riscen alternated between pitcher and right field all 
year. Halcovich started the final but struggled early and gave way to Riscen. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of hits," Stroh recalled. "It was a big night." 
</P>
<P>
1985: Kennedy 10, Banning 9 
</P>
<P>
DON'T YOU FORGET ABOUT ME (Simple Minds): Kevin Farlow, a Kennedy sophomore, 
provided one of the most memorable finishes by smacking a two-out home run 
barely inside the left-field foul pole with two out in the bottom of the 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
"He hit it high, so we weren't sure if it was going out," recalled Dick 
Whitney, the Kennedy coach. A bases-loaded double by George Gonzalez gave 
Kennedy a 6-1 lead in the second inning. Banning pecked away, however, and the 
Golden Cougars needed a gutty relief effort from Sandy Sreden to set the stage 
for Farlow. 
</P>
<P>
1986: Grant 5, Granada Hills 1 
</P>
<P>
ON MY OWN (Patti LaBelle and Michael McDonald): Grant right-hander Rodney Beck 
turned the final into his personal showcase, pitching a three-hitter and 
striking out seven. "We couldn't hit that slider on the outside corner," Stroh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Beck's effort spoiled the last game for a talented group of Granada Hills 
seniors who had won the title as sophomores. Stroh said the Highlanders 
attempted six squeeze bunts but executed only one successfully. 
</P>
<P>
1987: Canoga Park 5, Poly 4 
</P>
<P>
DON'T GIVE UP (Peter Gabriel): In his 37th and last season, Coach Doug 
MacKenzie posted his first championship and his 300th career victory in the 
same game. 
</P>
<P>
The Hunters survived a three-run home run by Danny Gil with one out in the 
seventh. Mike Roberts relieved Adam Schulhofer after the homer and, after 
striking out a batter, allowed consecutive singles to Luis Garcia and Rodrigo 
Fuentes. Roberts finally recorded a strikeout to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I was awfully scared," MacKenzie said. 
</P>
<P>
A home run by Mike Kerber, triples by Mike Urman and Kasey Fink, and a double 
by Schulhofer were the big Canoga Park hits. 
</P>
<P>
"We did it for ourselves, of course, but in the end we did it for Mac," Urman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
1988: Monroe 3, San Fernando 2 
</P>
<P>
DESIRE (U2): Monroe became an improbable champion after going 5-10 in league 
play. "Monroe was like a fairy tale," San Fernando Coach Steve Marden said. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Sean Henson struck out 10 for the Vikings and Tim Costic doubled home 
Joey Marquis with the winning run in the top of the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom of the seventh, Albert Torres reached base and stole second with 
two out. A line drive down the left-field line by Richard Ortiz landed a few 
inches foul and two pitches later, he popped to third. 
</P>
<P>
1989: Kennedy 4, Palisades 3

BUSTA MOVE (Young M.C.): A weary Mitch Cizek gallantly went the distance for 
Kennedy just two days after pitching the final four innings of the semifinal 
and eight days after slicing an artery in his forearm trying to open a window. 
</P>
<P>
Cizek surrendered a ground-rule double with two out in the seventh but retired 
the next batter. "I thought he would fall," Palisades Coach Russ Howard said. 
"He seemed like he was teetering." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Palisades fell, giving a Valley team a City championship for the 17th 
consecutive season.

TREEND GAINS CONTROL OF HIS FASTBALL, FOES

<P>
Pat Treend prefers heavy-metal music. Treend prefers metal bats. Treend's 
targets prefer armor. 
</P>
<P>
Well, targets might be a slight exaggeration, but anyone who has been plunked 
by one of the El Camino Real High pitcher's bone-busting fastballs might feel 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
When Treend was a kid, his size, not to mention his wayward fastball, was cause 
for concern. At age 13, Treend was already 6 feet tall. Many a mother fretted 
that Treend would send her child home from the game with a Mr. Spalding spot 
welded to his left temple. 
</P>
<P>
"Moms would walk up to Pat and say, 'Oh, please don't hit little Johnny today,' 
" said Chuck Treend, Pat's father. "Others would say, 'Hey, check the birth 
certificate of that big oaf.' " 
</P>
<P>
Treend's wildness is well-documented. From his first day of ball at El Camino 
Real, it was obvious that if Treend wasn't raising eyebrows, he was parting 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time, I think they were afraid to let Pat pitch B. P. because they 
thought he'd kill somebody," said Jason Cohen, an El Camino Real outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it might have something to do with the first guy I pitched to at my 
first varsity tryout," said Treend, who has signed to play next season for UC 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
As a wild-eyed, wild-winged freshman, Treend took the mound to face Leo Matsuda 
as dozens of players looked on. Offering No. 1 was a strike, Treend recalls. 
Offering No. 2 was a ball, Treend recalls. Offering No. 3 hit Matsuda in the 
face. Treend recoils. 
</P>
<P>
"I got him right in the jaw," Treend said. "He hit the ground like a sack of 
potatoes, he was out cold. . . . All the older guys were going, 'God, he isn't 
moving. He's dead.' 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared to death. I mean, I was a big kid, but mentally, I'm 15 years 
old. So the next guy climbs in and he's quaking in his boots. I'm so scared I 
start throwing 'em in there at about 25 or 30 miles an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's when (Coach Mike) Maio decided I wasn't quite ready (for the 
varsity)." 
</P>
<P>
Matsuda recovered. So did Treend, sort of. In his first junior varsity start, 
which ended in a 1-1 tie, Treend struck out 15 in seven innings -- and walked 
11. 
</P>
<P>
He made the varsity as a sophomore and showed promise, although wildness 
stalked him until the middle of last summer. As a junior, Treend walked 35 in 
49 1/3 innings and finished 4-3. His earned-run average of 5.96 was high enough 
to melt a solar-powered calculator. 
</P>
<P>
He seemed to snap out of the walk-one-whiff-one funk while helping pitch 
Woodland Hills West to an American Legion World Series title last August. 
Coincidentally or not, Treend has dropped 25 pounds from his 6-foot-4 frame 
since last summer and is down to 195. 
</P>
<P>
But Treend says the idea that it might be healthier to throw strikes crossed 
his mind well before Legion play started. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I got the idea after a few seams got scraped across my forehead last 
year by Chatsworth and Kennedy guys," he said. "I got mashed last year." 
</P>
<P>
Treend always has had rifle-arm velocity -- his fastball has been clocked in 
the mid-80s -- but his spray pattern was more akin to a shotgun blast. As a 
senior, however, his wildness has essentially been muzzled. 
</P>
<P>
Treend (12-0) has struck out 100 in 84 2/3 innings with 47 walks. He has 
allowed 61 hits, has an earned-run average of 1.24 and has completed 11 of 12 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
More important, he no longer has had to endure teammates' plaintive pleas to 
just throw strikes. 
</P>
<P>
"Position players think it's that easy -- just walk up there and throw 'em over 
the plate," Treend said with a sniff. "Heck, if they come within a few feet of 
a guy on a cutoff play, that's pretty good. In pitching, it all comes down to 
about two inches." 
</P>
<P>
His talent, it seems, now matches his proportions. In a City Section 4-A 
Division semifinal game against San Fernando on Friday, Treend threw a 
one-hitter, struck out 11 and walked five to lead El Camino Real to a 3-1 
victory and a date with Chatsworth in the championship game tonight at Dodger 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've ever seen Pat throw better than that," Maio said. "He had 
such a rhythm, he was in such a groove." 
</P>
<P>
But it has been a learning experience. 
</P>
<P>
"(When) I came into high school, I was basically a thrower," Treend said. Maio 
points to Treend's improvement in "maturity and concentration." 
</P>
<P>
Either way, his teammates are thankful. Cohen and Treend were teammates as 
14-year-olds, and Cohen was the catcher. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes he'd throw about five balls in a row right off the plate," Cohen 
said. "Imagine what my body looked like after the game." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he once was crossed up and tried to barehand a Treend heave that 
caromed off the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"Dislocated three of my fingers," Cohen said. "I swear, they were purple and 
blue within 30 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
There were times when Treend also took his lumps. 
</P>
<P>
When Treend was 9, his father coached a team of all-stars from the West Hills 
Mustang program. The team included Ryan McGuire, now a senior at El Camino 
Real, and 1989 graduate Paul Geller. 
</P>
<P>
Pat didn't make the squad -- he wasn't good enough. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard to do, but I didn't want anybody saying he was on the team just 
because he was my kid," Chuck Treend said. "At that age, he just hadn't grown 
into his body yet. 
</P>
<P>
"He sure didn't start out as an all-star, but he's always had an incredible 
desire to be a ballplayer." 
</P>
<P>
Is he a late bloomer and a late boomer? Treend has amazed many with the bat 
this season -- his coach included -- rolling up a .371 average and driving in a 
team-high 27 runs. But some aren't as wide-eyed. 
</P>
<P>
As a 13-year-old, Treend broke an ankle while backpacking in the mountains -- 
climbing around in the boonies is nothing rare for this Eagle Scout -- and 
missed half of the West Hills season. 
</P>
<P>
"When he came back, he must have hit about 11 homers in the last seven games," 
Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Some say Treend is borderline wicked. 
</P>
<P>
The enigmatic right-hander listens to heavy-metal bands such as Slayer and 
Anthrax, but gravitates toward Beethoven on game days. Treend often wears a 
Metallica T-shirt under his jersey. 
</P>
<P>
"Metallica?" said Chatsworth pitcher Reed McMackin, Treend's opposite number 
tonight. "Maybe he made a deal with the devil. He's been pitching like he might 
have." 
</P>

TOP-RANKED WESTLAKE FALLS TO MARINA, 4-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rich Herrera never was comfortable with his team's habit of flirting with 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
And for good reason. Westlake High repeatedly had escaped adverse situations 
with clutch performances. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors' strong pitching and tight defense came to the aid of the offense 
when it struggled. And, if pitching struggled and defense weakened, Westlake 
somehow produced enough runs. 
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday, that magic ended when Marina handed the top-seeded Warriors a 4-1 
loss in a Southern Section 5-A Division baseball semifinal game at Blair Field 
in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Westlake's stingy defense wasn't so stingy. The Warriors' hitting 
wasn't so pesky. And their pitching, their plug in the drain all season, 
finally faltered. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been catching up with us," said Herrera, whose team is ranked No. 1 
by USA Today. "We've managed to come up with something just about every game." 
</P>
<P>
Not Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Two mistakes allowed Marina to tie the score, 1-1, in the fourth. Another 
erased a valuable leadoff walk in a the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
And, after James Clark limited Marina to two hits through five innings, Marina 
(16-12-1) battered Clark and Mike Eby for four consecutive hits and three runs 
in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't do what we needed to do," Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake's misfortunes began when it loaded the bases with one out in the 
first, and Eby hit into an inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
"That turned the whole ballgame around," Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
And left Marina Coach Paul Renfrow breathing a sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
"You just cannot let (Westlake) get a lead, because you'll never catch them," 
Renfrow said. 
</P>
<P>
In the second, Todd Preston hit his second home run in as many games to give 
Westlake (28-2) a 1-0 lead. Clark (7-1), a junior left-hander, retired the 
first eight batters. 
</P>
<P>
But Marina, the No. 3 team from the perennially-strong Sunset League, tied the 
score in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Newfield walked and reached second when second baseman Rick Wolters 
dropped catcher Mike Lieberthal's throw on a stolen-base attempt. David Schultz 
then grounded to Wolters, but Eby dropped Wolters' throw to first, allowing 
Newfield to score. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake, meanwhile, couldn't advance a runner past first base against Schultz 
(7-2). The Warriors had an opportunity to do so when Wolters led off the sixth 
with a walk, but he was thrown out at second on a sacrifice-bunt attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"The pitch to (Rob) Neal was high, but Wolters went anyway," Herrera said, 
shaking his head. "A costly mental mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Marina finally reached Clark in the sixth for consecutive singles by Robin 
Lindsey and Newfield. Eby, a senior left-hander with an 11-0 record, replaced 
Clark and gave up Schultz's two-run triple. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Valencia followed with a run-scoring double that extended Marina's lead to 
4-1 and chased Eby. Sophomore right-hander John Snyder struck out two of the 
three hitters he faced, but the damage was done. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz, a 6-foot-4 senior right-hander who allowed only three hits, retired 
Westlake in order in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
"Three hits aren't going to score many runs," Herrera said. "You have to give 
their kid credit, but a lot of times we beat ourselves at the plate." 
</P>
<P>
The top of Westlake's order, which scored 97 runs during the regular season, 
was zero for seven and finished five for 36 in the playoffs. Lieberthal, who 
hit .500 with 13 home runs and 42 runs batted in, was one for 12 in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Things like that are bound to catch up with you," Herrera said.

MOUNTIES' 'PISTOL' WHIPS PARACLETE; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL: ORTIZ LEADS MONTCLAIR PREP INTO SOUTHERN SECTION 1-A 
FINAL WITH 2-0 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Against a Montclair Prep pitcher nicknamed Pistol and a surly, territorial 
catcher, Paraclete baserunners Wednesday faced a predicament as bleak as the 
gray sky that hung over Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
In the first four innings, five Spirit runners were erased on the basepaths. 
Three who attempted to steal on Montclair Prep catcher Brent Polacheck were 
strong-armed back into their dugouts. Another was picked off second base by 
pitcher Russell (Pistol) Ortiz. Yet another was tagged out in a rundown after a 
ground ball. 
</P>
<P>
These plays made matters easier for Ortiz, who faced just two batters over the 
minimum in Montclair Prep's 2-0 win in a Southern Section 1-A semifinal 
baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep (23-3) thus advanced to its first Southern Section title game 
since 1982, when it won the Small Schools championship. The Mounties will face 
Alpha League rival Village Christian, which defeated Fillmore, 12-5. The 
finalists will clash for the third time this season Friday at 7:30 p.m. at 
Blair Field in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz's timely complete-game effort was a boon to Montclair Prep Coach Walt 
Steele. 
</P>
<P>
"This leaves the whole staff for Friday," said Steele, who indicated that 
senior ace Kevin Grant (12-2) will get the start. "We've been going with the 
same rotation the whole year and we were just real confident that we were gonna 
get a good performance out of Russell." 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz, a 15-year-old sophomore, showed a fastball worthy of his varsity status 
in striking out six and allowing just three singles. 
</P>
<P>
"When I pitch, I don't really get nervous," Ortiz said. "Coach told us they 
were a swinging team that tries to hit the ball. So I just kept the ball low." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he kept Paraclete from an uprising. Ortiz (7-1) walked just one 
batter; the only baserunners Paraclete (15-8) stranded were those on first and 
second in the seventh inning. Others found themselves headed to the dugout 
early. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like baserunners trying to run on me at all," Polacheck said. "With 
Russell pitching like he was today, his delivery helps me. He hums it real 
quick and I can get a good release." 
</P>
<P>
Paraclete pitcher Derek McMurtry (4-2), meanwhile, was weaving a tidy 
one-hitter of his own heading into the fifth inning. With the game scoreless, 
Montclair Prep right fielder Jared Baumblatt walked and went to second on 
Ortiz's single to left. 
</P>
<P>
Mountie first baseman Andy Shaw turned on a McMurtry offering, driving a long 
single to the fence in right field to score Baumblatt and move Ortiz to third. 
Leadoff hitter Leland Sparks knocked a sacrifice fly to center field to score 
Ortiz. 
</P>
<P>
A 2-0 cushion was more than sufficient for Pistol, so nicknamed by Mountie 
shortstop Keyaan Cook for his unusual arm strength. 
</P>
<P>
"For a No. 2 pitcher," Steele beamed, "he's one of the best around."

PITCHING ACES ENTER FINAL ON A ROLL

<P>
It might go down as the most interesting outing of Reed McMackin's high school 
baseball career. But then, some guys go to Indy just for the crashes. 
</P>
<P>
On March 28, the Chatsworth High right-hander was pitching a no-hitter against 
San Fernando. True, he was removed from the game in the first inning, but it 
wasn't because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
The catch? Ask the catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Zero outs. Zero official at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember it distinctly," said Chatsworth catcher Mike Mancuso. "He walked 
the first three and took a break -- he hit the next guy -- then he walked 
another four." 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth lost, 9-2, and McMackin's record fell to 3-2, hardly the numbers 
expected from one of Chatsworth's two returning regulars. But punishment, even 
self-inflicted, carried a lesson. McMackin's earned-run average wasn't the only 
thing that grew. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the best thing for Reed was losing that game, even though it was bad 
for the team," first-year Chatsworth Coach Tom Meusborn said. "I think he 
matured. He's really led the way ever since." 
</P>
<P>
Since the San Fernando start, McMackin has rolled off nine consecutive 
victories to lead Chatsworth (23-5-1) into the City Section 4-A Division final 
against El Camino Real (21-2-1) at Dodger Stadium tonight at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a humbling experience," said McMackin, a 6-foot, 190-pound senior. "I 
thought I was God's gift to the pitching world." 
</P>
<P>
Ever since, McMackin's numbers have been wholly rolling. In his nine-game tear, 
he has thrown three shutouts. Included in the stretch are three five-hitters, a 
four-hitter, a three-hitter and a one-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
The three-hit, six-strikeout performance came in a 9-3 victory over El Camino 
Real on April 24, the Conquistadores' only loss to a City team this year. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real is expected to counter with a streak shooter of its own in 
senior right-hander Pat Treend (12-0). 
</P>
<P>
In the teams' first meeting on March 13, Ryan McGuire defeated Chatsworth, 6-2, 
with Treend pitching the final 1 2/3 innings to earn a save. McMackin, who 
started and was removed in the fifth, took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
In the third meeting between the two West Valley League rivals, Treend defeated 
Chatsworth, 11-8, on April 26, two days after McMackin's win. In short, each 
team won once in decisive fashion, with the wild rubber game going to El Camino 
Real -- a win in which Treend threw 143 pitches over seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
Treend, who tossed a one-hitter in a 3-1 semifinal defeat of San Fernando last 
Friday, has struck out 100 batters in 84 2/3 innings and has an earned-run 
average of 1.24. McMackin has 71 strikeouts in 79 innings and an ERA of 1.95. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the battery carries a charge too. Each team's catcher bats in the 
cleanup position. El Camino Real's Bobby Kim is batting .375, has three home 
runs and has driven in 26 runs. Mancuso is batting .333 with 29 RBIs and has 
four hits in his past five at-bats against Treend dating to last season. 
</P>
<P>
Kim and Mancuso could be the best defensive catchers in the City. Given each 
team's lack of speed -- Jeff Marks leads El Camino Real with five stolen bases 
and Scott Carpenter leads Chatsworth with 10 -- offenses may rely on the 
sacrifice bunt as their chief weapon in a tight game. 
</P>
<P>
Mancuso and No. 3-hitter Nestor Martinez (.426, 38 runs, 12 doubles, 24 RBIs) 
have cooled in the playoffs -- Martinez, a second baseman, is hitless in his 
last three games -- but Chatsworth has received help from other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder Mitch Root, who bats sixth, is batting .404 with team highs in 
home runs (three) and RBIs (35). In three playoff games, Root is six for nine 
with three triples and a home run. McMackin, who bats fifth and is the 
designated-hitter when not pitching, is batting .400 with 28 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real is equally solid through the batting order, especially in the 
top six places. McGuire, who also plays first, has five home runs and 23 RBIs 
in the No. 2 position, followed by left fielder Jason Cohen (.368, 23 RBIs), 
Kim, third baseman Greg Lederman (.493, 23 RBIs) and Treend (.371, 27 RBIs). 
</P>
<P>
Senior left-handers McGuire and, for Chatsworth, Danny Rodriguez are the 
probable relievers should Treend or McMackin falter. Rodriguez is 6-2 with an 
ERA of 2.62. McGuire, who will attend UCLA in the fall, is 7-1 with a 1.84 ERA 
and 91 strikeouts in 57 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Meusborn is seeking to become the second consecutive rookie coach to win a City 
title. Kennedy's Manny Alvarado won in his first season in 1989. Chatsworth, 
which features four juniors in the starting lineup, last won a City title in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real, which has never won a baseball championship, actually started 
to jell midway through the 1989 season when it won nine of its last 10. 
Furthermore, eight starters played last summer on the Woodland Hills West team 
that won the American Legion World Series and finished 38-7. 
</P>
<P>
That's a cumulative record of 68-10-1 over the past 14 months for the core 
Conquistadore players. Additionally, Treend was 13-1 for West last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're definitely beatable," Mancuso said. "But it's going to take a 
terrific game with no mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real also might have a slight edge in big-game hunting: En route to 
the Legion title, Woodland Hills West played several games in three different 
cities before large, often partisan crowds. A handful were night games. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that was a learning experience for them," said El Camino Real Coach 
Mike Maio, who took the Conquistadores to the final in 1984 when they lost to 
Granada Hills. "But I don't think anything compares to walking into Dodger 
Stadium." 
</P>
<P>
Now that's the kind of walk McMackin has in mind.

The rising star that is 19-year-old featherweight Rafael Ruelas ascended higher 
Tuesday night at the Country Club in Reseda, where Ruelas stopped Vicente 
Gonzales of Bell by technical knockout after five rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales failed to answer the bell for the sixth round, saying that he could 
not see out of his swollen right eye. 
</P>
<P>
The win was the 17th against no defeats for Ruelas of Arleta and represented 
the first time in his career that he has had to fight past the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have kept on going, I wasn't tired," a smiling Ruelas said. "I was 
feeling good, hitting him inside with short chopping uppercuts. I was hoping to 
wear him out." 
</P>
<P>
Ruelas not only wore Gonzales (13-8-2) out, he beat him like a drum from the 
first round on. Ruelas, a lanky 127 pounds, showed a whipping force to his 
punches that afforded Gonzales little relief. Ruelas, the 30th-ranked contender 
in the world by the World Boxing Council, won every round handily and emerged 
from the fight with his face, for the most part, untouched. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw that he was hurt a couple of times," Ruelas said. 
</P>
<P>
Ruelas also said that he was looking forward to a possible match with Jeff 
Franklin, a touted contender who recently defeated Rafael's brother, Gabriel, 
in a controversial fight in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Ruelas' bout followed four undercard fights. In the most notable preliminary, 
the comeback trail of Kennedy McKinney, 24, continued on a positive note as the 
featherweight disposed of Chilo Guzman of Mexico by technical knockout at 1 
minute 44 seconds of the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the third in a row for McKinney (8-0-1), who is coming back 
from drug rehabilitation after winning a bantamweight gold medal in the 1988 
Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
McKinney toyed with Guzman early before repeatedly unleashing a rapid and 
painful jab on his opponent. Guzman, though a noted survivor, could not take 
much of the punishment. 
</P>
<P>
After being knocked into the ropes, Guzman was dazed and the fight was called. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm about 75%, I'll give you that," said McKinney, who is on a 
two-fights-a-month schedule. "In three or four fights, I'll be 100%." 
</P>
<P>
In a four-round welterweight bout, Alan (Papa Doc) McMasters of Raleigh, N.C., 
took a unanimous decision in his professional debut from a tough Lauro Guerrero 
of San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Lightweight Larry Loy of Van Nuys also won his professional debut in a 
punch-packed four-round unanimous decision over Tony Rivera of San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
The quicker Loy, 132 1/2, who had compiled a 186-11 record as an amateur, was 
alert throughout the fight, damaging both of Rivera's eyes in the second round. 
Two judges gave Loy all four rounds as he consistently landed head and body 
blows. 
</P>
<P>
In a four-round lightweight bout, Charles Hawkins (6-3) of Phoenix won a 
unanimous decision over Mario Camacho.

<P>
SECTION COMMISSIONER AWAITS RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION ON BRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Section Commissioner Kendall Webb is waiting for the results of a Patrick Henry 
investigation into Saturday's brawl, which erupted after Monte Vista took a 9-7 
victory over Henry in a 3-A semifinal baseball game, before deciding whether 
the Section will get involved. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary reports indicated the fight began when Henry's Luke Lowrey punched 
Monte Vista's Curt Howard in the face during postgame handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
Pending the school's investigation, Webb said he will decide whether Lowrey, a 
junior, will be punished by the Section. 
</P>
<P>
Webb said that because of the newly instituted ethics in sports policy, Lowrey 
could be ruled ineligible for his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
"We would prefer to let Patrick Henry deal with this matter," he said. "But 
certainly a person who violates the policy, and the indications are this young 
man did, would not be a person we want representing the San Diego Section in 
athletics." 
</P>
<P>
Henry Athletic Director Chris Miller, however, indicated Lowrey might not have 
been the instigator. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point in time we've started our preliminary investigation and some 
very interesting things have come up," Miller said. "An administrator from 
another school who was at the game said he saw a Monte Vista kid throw an 
elbow, and two parents came in today independently of one another and said they 
saw the same thing." The administrator is Jerry Webb, baseball coach and 
athletic director at Midway Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
"(Lowrey) was the second one in line to come up for the handshakes and his hand 
was up like everybody else's and as soon as that elbow came up, that's when it 
happened," Jerry Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Lowrey finished as the second-best passer in the county, completing 
144 of 264 passes for 11 touchdowns and 2,126 yards, or 212.6 yards per game.

EC Adopts VDT Safety Regulations: The 12-nation European Community adopted 
sweeping safety regulations for workers who use video display terminals, 
including periodic breaks and the right to regular eye examinations. The rules 
also call for glare-free and swiveling screens, "adequate spacing" between 
characters and lines, and adjustable seats with a footrest if requested. VDTs 
put into service after Dec. 31, 1992, must meet the new regulations, and 
existing equipment must be modified by the end of 1996.

Nova Corp., a Canadian energy and chemical firm, said it is selling its Polysar 
rubber division to the West German firm Bayer AG for $1.06 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Nova will use the proceeds from the sale to reduce its debt, the company said 
in a statement from its Calgary, Alberta, headquarters. The rubber business is 
part of Polysar Ltd., a firm acquired by Nova in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Bayer said the acquisition would supplement its rubber business, giving it 
plants that produce synthetic rubber primarily for tire and industrial uses. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction, which must be approved by government officials in the United 
States, Canada and Europe, also provides for Bayer to assume Polysar's 
outstanding debt.

LINEN TO HEAD SHEARSON BROKERAGE UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. has named Jonathan Linen, an executive from parent 
American Express Co., to head Shearson's brokerage and money management 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The move appears to confirm American Express' plan to split Shearson in two as 
part of a restructuring of the troubled financial services company. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based Shearson, the nation's second-largest securities firm after 
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said Linen will become president and chief executive 
of its Private Client Group, which is its brokerage unit, and asset management 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Linen was most recently head of the travelers checks and direct marketing group 
of American Express. He has been with the firm for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The move reaffirms American Express' commitment to developing the tremendous 
potential of Shearson's retail franchise," said James Robinson III, chairman 
and chief executive of American Express. 
</P>
<P>
Hardwick Simmons, who was president of the brokerage group, has resigned, 
Shearson said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the reorganization, American Express plans to buy the Shearson stock 
that it does not already own, about 39% of its shares. 
</P>
<P>
It has already installed new senior management. In January, Shearson Chairman 
Peter Cohen was ousted and replaced by Howard Clark Jr., who was American 
Express' chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
Clark has since announced that the firm would overhaul its business, resulting 
in about 2,000 layoffs. The cost of these and other changes contributed to the 
firm's first-quarter loss of $915 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sources at Shearson and on Wall Street have indicated for weeks that the firm 
was planning to split itself into two businesses, combining the brokerage and 
money management areas and forming a separate unit from investment banking and 
capital markets. 
</P>
<P>
In its brokerage business, Shearson has 10,000 brokers at 450 offices around 
the country managing about $90 billion for pension funds and other institutions 
and $180 billion for private clients. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson said Joseph Plumeri Jr., who heads the domestic branches, and Henry 
Gottmann, head of sales and marketing for individual retail accounts, will 
continue in their current roles. In addition, Jerome Miller will continue to 
direct the asset management business, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Linen, 46, joined American Express in 1969 as assistant to the chairman. After 
holding several domestic and overseas posts, he was named a senior vice 
president in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
From 1980 through 1986, he served as president of the domestic Travel Services 
division and then became president of direct marketing in the United States.

Pic 'N' Save Sues Girard Partners: Pic 'N' Save filed a federal suit accusing

Pic 'N' Save said, without elaborating, that Girard "has made false and 
misleading statements" in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
La Jolla financier David Batchelder, who heads Girard, called the suit an 
effort to slow his group's efforts to win a majority on Pic 'N' Save's board 
and said he expects to prevail in court. Dominguez-based Pic 'N' Save is a

PRICING OF INFANT FORMULA STUDIED; 
</P>
<P>
ANTITRUST: THE FTC WANTS TO KNOW WHETHER A LACK OF COMPETITION HAS ALLOWED THE 
THREE MAIN PRODUCERS TO ARTIFICIALLY INCREASE PRICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday that it has opened a preliminary 
investigation of the infant formula business to determine whether a lack of 
competition has artificially raised prices. 
</P>
<P>
The FTC responded to a complaint from Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), who 
said: "American women may be paying millions of dollars more than they should 
for infant formula because there is no competition." And that, he said, results 
from "an alarming pattern of lock-step pricing." 
</P>
<P>
Prices rose more than 150% during the 1980s, a period when the price of milk -- 
a major ingredient in the formulas -- rose 36%, said Metzenbaum, chairman of 
the Senate Labor Committee's antitrust subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
The three major competitors in the industry are Ross Laboratories, a unit of 
Abbott Laboratories, which makes the Similac brand; Mead Johnson Nutritionals, 
a unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., with Enfamil; and Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories 
division of American Home Products Corp., with SMA, according to Metzenbaum. 
</P>
<P>
The FTC's Bureau of Competition has begun a preliminary inquiry, Kevin Arquit, 
the bureau's director, said Tuesday at a hearing held by the antitrust 
subcommittee. The bureau will gather information and then recommend whether a 
full-scale investigation is justified. 
</P>
<P>
State agencies that buy large amounts of formula distributed under a federal 
program for poor families "have voiced concern about the pricing and bidding 
practices in this industry," Arquit said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have insufficient information about these practices to assess them, but 
when such concerns are voiced by sophisticated buyers we take them very 
seriously," Arquit said. 
</P>
<P>
In an industry where there are just a few companies, "efforts to collude . . . 
are more likely to be successful," the FTC official said. 
</P>
<P>
Arquit said the FTC is surprised by "the lack of advertising directed at the 
ultimate consumer of infant formula." Doctors and hospitals usually recommend 
infant formula to mothers, Arquit said. 
</P>
<P>
But most nutritional products and nonprescription drugs "also rely on consumer 
advertising as a means of competition," Arquit noted. "Our inquiry will seek to 
determine whether infant formula manufacturers have decided to eschew this form 
of competition and, if so, whether this has resulted in higher prices for 
consumers." 
</P>
<P>
John C. Kane, president of Ross Laboratories, said infant formula is modestly 
priced despite an exacting and costly production process. 
</P>
<P>
"Every batch of formula produced by Ross employees is subjected to over 2,000 
quality checks," he told the subcommittee. Special health and safety rules 
produce a "distinctive need for near perfection," he said. "Yet the retail cost 
to feed a baby formula is less than $2 a day." 
</P>
<P>
The mother of a newborn baby and the doctor "must work as a team to ensure that 
each baby is receiving the formula most compatible with its needs," Kane said. 
"For this reason, we promote our products only through health-care 
professionals. We do no consumer advertising." 
</P>
<P>
Metzenbaum said costs to consumers may be high because Ross and the two other 
major producers play "follow the leader" in setting prices.

Varity is considering moving its headquarters from Toronto to Buffalo to make

PENSION FUND URGES FIRMS TO SPURN ANTI-TAKEOVER LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a new sign of the increasing militancy of large pension funds, the 
California Public Employees Retirement System on Tuesday asked 22 of the 
largest companies incorporated in Pennsylvania to withdraw from that state's 
far-reaching anti-takeover law. 
</P>
<P>
CalPERS, the nation's largest and most influential public pension fund, with 
about $57 billion in assets, said the recently passed law placed radical 
restrictions on the right of shareholders to change management. 
</P>
<P>
The law essentially makes it harder for hostile parties to buy a company 
incorporated in the state and for disgruntled stockholders to change management 
through proxy fights aimed at ousting the board and other tactics.

<P>
The pension fund sent a letter dated May 11 to the companies. It said it has 
not yet received any direct responses. 
</P>
<P>
Large pension funds, which can own million of shares of publicly held 
companies, are increasingly taking a more active role in corporate affairs in 
order to ensure that their investments remain profitable. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a growing trend to militancy" among the once-passive trustees of large 
pension funds, said Richard Koppes, general counsel to CalPERS. 
</P>
<P>
CalPERS may completely divest its stock holdings in Pennsylvania companies, 
which total $500 million, and the fund has already joined a lawsuit to overturn 
the controversial legislation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pennsylvania anti-takeover law has galvanized pension funds into protecting 
their own interests more aggressively, Koppes said. CalPERS is currently 
weighing plans to lobby for change in the law, and may freeze any further 
investments in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to urge more federal intervention" against state anti-takeover 
laws, such as the law passed by Pennsylvania last month, Koppes told Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
The Pennsylvania legislation, which is considered the nation's toughest 
anti-takeover measure, was signed into law on April 27. It allows companies 90 
days to decide whether they want to be included under its provisions. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pennsylvania law is a real problem for pension funds in general, both 
public and private," Koppes said. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was supported by many major Pennsylvania corporations and labor, but 
it was opposed by Canada's Belzberg family, whose takeover overtures to a 
company in the state prompted the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Already, PNC Financial Corp., the state's biggest bank holding company, has 
recommended that it not be covered by the bill. But PPG Industries Inc., a 
large building materials company, said it wanted to be included under the 
bill's provisions. 
</P>
<P>
CalPERS said the anti-takeover legislation impairs the ability of U.S. 
companies to compete in a global market while diminishing the rights of 
stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the new law have said that it would serve to protect entrenched 
management's interests, and make U.S. companies less competitive by making it 
hard to oust incompetent managers.

OPPOSITION'S LEADER STIFLED IN MYANMAR;

SOUTHEAST ASIA: THE END OF MILITARY RULE MAY HINGE ON THE STATUS OF THE

Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader whose party is claiming a landslide 
election victory, remained under house arrest Tuesday despite being the pivotal 
figure in a pending delicate transfer of power between army and civilian 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
As votes from Sunday's election were counted, many said they see the 
44-year-old academic as their only hope for a change of leadership free of 
bloodletting and revenge in Myanmar, formerly Burma. 
</P>
<P>
"Without Aung San Suu Kyi, we cannot carry the people," said Khin Maung Swe, 
committee member of the National League for Democracy. "She is a symbol of our 
fight for democracy." 
</P>
<P>
The elections were the climax of 20 months of army rule, imposed after troops 
gunned down hundreds of demonstrators to end nationwide demands for political 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
The government-approved National Unity Party has so far won only a fraction of 
the vote. Until all the votes are counted, a process the army has said may take 
up to three weeks -- or one side makes a move -- Myanmar remains in limbo 
between army rule and parliamentary democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The army, which officials said had been caught off guard by the landslide, has 
promised to hand power to a government formed after a new constitution is 
adopted. 
</P>
<P>
Acting league president Kyi Maung said Tuesday that his party would refine 
Myanmar's 1947 constitution within two months after Parliament convenes. 
</P>
<P>
He said his party -- which says it already has a majority in Parliament -- will 
meet Thursday to work out how to set up a government. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment we can't talk about the future. We will sit down together and 
come up with a nice list of priorities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But few expect much to happen until the dynamic, British-educated Aung San Suu 
Kyi and party chairman Tin Oo, both detained last July after making fiery 
anti-government speeches, are released. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her arrest, the slender daughter of assassinated independence hero Aung 
San dominated the elections and is seen as the main reason for the league's 
overwhelming victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The army has to release them. They just need a face-saving way out," said one 
official. 
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi's home, by Yangon's Inya Lake, is still guarded by a battalion 
of soldiers who politely but firmly turn away visitors. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the lake is the house of Gen. Ne Win, until 1988 the 
leader of Burma and still believed to be the power behind the military 
government.

DE KLERK POSTPONES HIS JUNE WASHINGTON VISIT; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AFRICA: SOME COMPLAINED THAT HIS MEETING WITH BUSH WOULD HAVE BEEN A SNUB 
TO NELSON MANDELA.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Frederik W. de Klerk said Tuesday he has postponed his visit to the 
United States next month because of a controversy over the timing of his 
meeting with President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the White House nor the South African government had announced a date 
for the meeting, but it reportedly had been set for June 18. 
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress and others complained that a meeting on that date 
with De Klerk would be a snub to African National Congress leader Nelson 
Mandela, who is to arrive in the United States on June 20. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk and Mandela have said they do not care which one meets with Bush 
first. But many ANC representatives and some black American leaders have said 
that Bush should not meet with De Klerk at all until South Africa's apartheid 
system is dismantled. It has been more than 30 years since a South African head 
of government has visited the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that "Mr. De Klerk 
has notified us that he would prefer to wait until another time" for his visit. 
"We are ready to see him whenever he wants." 
</P>
<P>
He said the change of schedule "will have no impact" on Mandela's visit. 
</P>
<P>
The South African president returned Saturday from an 18-day visit to nine 
European nations, where he met with leaders and explained his plans to end 
apartheid and give the voteless black majority a voice in running the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk is under pressure from white rightists for conceding too much to 
blacks and he needs to demonstrate to his voters that his reforms are winning 
support abroad for isolated South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said the last thing he wants are television pictures of noisy, 
possibly violent, anti-South African demonstrations in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mandela underwent minor surgery to clear up a complication 
discovered during a routine checkup and will stay in the hospital for another 
day or two, his doctor said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
He would not disclose the nature of the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's wife, Winnie, visited him briefly at a private Johannesburg clinic 
Tuesday and told reporters he was in excellent spirits. 
</P>
<P>
She said his tour of European capitals, scheduled to start next week, will not 
be affected by his longer-than-expected stay in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, 71, was admitted in secrecy to the Park Lane clinic late Sunday. There 
was speculation that he was being treated for a recurring prostate complaint.

PARK CONCESSIONAIRE FEES CRITICIZED

The largest 14 licensed businesses in the nation's parks sold more than $255 
million in goods and services in 1988 but paid only $5.6 million for the 
privilege, an Interior Department report found Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The taxpayers are getting a very bad deal. 
</P>
<P>
They're getting gouged," said James R. Richards, the department's inspector 
general, in a phone interview. 
</P>
<P>
The audit recommended increasing licensing fees for those who operate stands, 
tours and other services in national parks. Failing do so meant that the 
government lost $83 million in revenue from 1984 to 1988, the report found, and 
would cost the government another $109 million by 1993 if licensing fees are 
not raised dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
The government's central contention was that concessionaires are operating as 
monopolies inside park grounds, able to earn huge profits while paying low 
licensing fees to the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
The report, based on audits of 14 of the nation's largest park concessionaires, 
indicates the operations are paying an average 2.5% of their gross receipts to 
the National Park Service. Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. has said that he 
hopes to increase fees beyond 20%.

PRIME MINISTER OKD IN TAIWAN AMID PROTESTS

The legislature confirmed a top general as Taiwan's new prime minister during a 
raucous session Tuesday, and hundreds of opponents fought in the streets with 
police, burned buses and tossed firebombs at government buildings. 
</P>
<P>
At least 40 people, including 10 officers, were reported injured. 
</P>
<P>
Police detained 10 people in the rioting, which paralyzed downtown traffic for 
more than 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Two police officers were hospitalized with serious burns from firebombs, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of the clashes, about 600 demonstrators, many wearing headbands 
with the slogan, "Oppose Military Intervention in Politics," fought roving 
battles with about 5,000 riot police near the Legislative Yuan building. Police 
used water cannons to try to subdue them, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
What touched off the unrest was the approval of Defense Minister Hau Pei-tsun 
as the next prime minister. Legislators approved him by a vote of 186 to 27. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was delayed seven hours as 21 members of the opposition Democratic 
Progressive Party stormed the podium, threw the Speaker's chair from the dais, 
kicked their seats in disgust and grabbed microphones from lawmakers of the 
ruling Nationalist Party. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition lawmakers, all wearing vests with Chinese characters reading, 
"Oppose a Soldier Leading the Cabinet," occupied voting booths for an hour to 
prevent Nationalist lawmakers from casting ballots. Several replacement voting 
booths were torn down. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, legislature Speaker Liang Su-jung called in 100 police officers 
to restore order. 
</P>
<P>
Hau, 70, the nation's only four-star general, was selected by President Lee 
Teng-hui earlier this month to head the Cabinet.

Arab League leaders extended their summit into a third day, to this morning, 
amid wrangling between moderates and radicals over how strongly to criticize 
U.S policy in the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
The summit was called at the urging of the Palestinians to discuss the recent 
influx of Soviet Jews into Israel. Arabs fear that the immigrants may be sent 
to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, dampening hopes for a 
Palestinian state there. 
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday, a compromise was reported on drafts of summit resolutions that 
would allow criticism of U.S. policy but in measured tones.

BALTIC SECESSION A TOUCHY ISSUE FOR MULRONEY;

CANADA: THE PRIME MINISTER MUST TREAD LIGHTLY, SINCE HE'S FACED WITH HIS OWN 
THREAT OF A BREAKAWAY BY QUEBEC.

When embattled Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev landed here Tuesday, 
protesters in the Canadian capital took advantage of his two-day visit to call 
for a tough stance opposing the Soviet economic blockade of the breakaway 
republic of Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
But Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney seems unlikely to give them much 
satisfaction, for recent weeks have brought him face to face with a growing 
secessionist threat of his own, in the province of Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
The Mulroney government has kept its language on the Baltic republics subdued 
in the days leading up to Gorbachev's arrival, not only to show support for 
Gorbachev's reforms but also to avoid sending the wrong signal to Canada's 
restive French-speaking province. 
</P>
<P>
"He's probably aware that if you encourage this issue there, you can have the 
same thing here," said Gerald LeBlanc, a Quebec nationalist newspaper columnist 
in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
No Canadian has forgotten what happened when a head of state visited Canada 
during an earlier bout of Quebec separatist sentiment: In 1967, French 
President Charles de Gaulle unexpectedly took to a balcony in Montreal and 
called out "Long Live Free Quebec!" to the crowd, igniting French-Canadian 
passions and shocking English Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
Turbulence in the Soviet Union makes Mulroney's domestic problems look small. 
Still, the two leaders are meeting at a time when Mulroney's approval rating in 
the polls is the lowest of any prime minister in Canada's postwar history. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Gorbachev visit began just as Mulroney was trying to 
orchestrate a week of whirlwind "diplomacy" among Canada's 10 provinces, 
sending an emissary across the country and holding an unusual series of 
one-on-one meetings of his own in the capital with the all-powerful provincial 
premiers. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations are a last-ditch attempt to save a package of constitutional 
amendments intended -- when written three years ago -- to appease dissatisfied 
French Canadians in Quebec. Three English-speaking provinces have been fighting 
the package, known as the Meech Lake Accord, and the divisions have grown so 
deep that numerous Ontario municipalities have voted themselves "English-only" 
towns. And Quebeckers are concluding that English Canada will never understand 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts are predicting that if the accord isn't ratified by the June 23 
deadline, the failure will prompt Quebec to set in motion a process of 
separation from English Canada. 
</P>
<P>
In light of this prospect, the plight of the Baltic republics has captured the 
close attention of political observers in Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the day I heard that Lithuania had declared independence -- I was 
glad," said Stephanie Martin, a 23-year-old graduate student in Quebec 
literature whose deep but non-militant nationalism represents the thinking of 
many young Quebeckers. "I was thinking about (the Lithuanians), but I was also 
thinking about Quebec." 
</P>
<P>
But, while English and French Canadians have bickered, Canadians of Ukrainian 
and Baltic heritage have expressed deep resentment at any parallels drawn 
between Quebec and the restive Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
"If Quebec had been treated since the 1700s the way Ukraine has been treated, 
there would be no Quebec," said Lubomyr Luciuk, a Canadian professor of 
geography whose ancestry is Ukrainian. He pointed out that Quebec entered the 
Canadian confederation of its own free will, while the Baltic states were 
forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
And Quebeckers are allowed to choose their representatives from an assortment 
of political parties and enjoy as-equals negotiations with English Canada, 
rather than economic strangulation. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no intention of spending my life in an outpost in Quebec suppressing my 
friends, who happen to be Quebecois, who want independence," Luciuk said. 
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a "Baltic Freedom Days" luncheon staged by Canadians of 
Ukrainian, Baltic and East European descent to coincide with Gorbachev's 
arrival. Canadians from these ethnic groups number more than 1 million, and 
they make up a sizable force in a country with a population of about 25 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Citing Canada's reputation for following a foreign policy based on morality and 
acting as peacekeeper in world trouble-spots, they have been calling on 
Mulroney's government to extend diplomatic recognition to Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters also are staging a round-the-clock vigil at the Soviet Embassy 
during Gorbachev's visit. They will hold a rally in front of the Canadian 
Parliament today, where the Soviet leader is scheduled to have a private 
session with Mulroney. 
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that Gorbachev canceled a previously planned speech 
before Parliament because of the protesters, but some say he simply wished to 
save his message for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Amid pressure to grant diplomatic recognition to Lithuania, Canadian External 
Affairs Minister Joe Clark has promised only to seek "international guarantees" 
by which Lithuania could achieve a negotiated independence, one that wouldn't 
endanger Gorbachev's imperiled reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Clark has said that Canada would be willing to help the breakaway republic 
establish government ministries and train bureaucrats, and he said the 
government is considering ways of shipping livestock feed into Lithuania via 
Poland to combat Moscow's economic blockade. But he rejected suggestions that 
Canada break the embargo on oil and gas by sending in Canadian fuel. 
</P>
<P>
"How sad it is that Western governments are intent on shoring up the last 
remaining empire," said Father Sigitas Tamevicius, a Lithuanian priest who 
appeared at the protest luncheon with the red, yellow and green of his national 
flag pinned to his clothes. "How painful it is that excessive caution by the 
Western nations turned the threat of the blockade of Lithuania into reality."

RULING ALLOWS BANKRUPTCY FILING TO AVOID RESTITUTION 
</P>

<P>
The government's effort to recover money lost in the savings and loan scandal 
suffered a setback Tuesday as the Supreme Court ruled that convicted criminals 
may avoid paying restitution to their victims by filing for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-2 ruling also is a blow to the "victim's rights" movement. In recent 
years, courts have been given new authority to order criminals to pay crime 
victims for their losses and injuries. In many instances of fraud or other 
financial crimes, judges have ordered criminals to pay fines and repay the 
stolen money rather than go to prison. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Congress gave the Justice Department an extra $75 million to pursue 
fraud investigations in the savings and loan scandal and told prosecutors to 
seek court orders demanding that former thrift officials repay at least part of 
the money they fraudulently squandered. 
</P>
<P>
Now, such court orders are in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
With some evident reluctance, the high court concluded Tuesday that the federal 
bankruptcy law gives any "debtor," including a convicted criminal, the right to 
"a discharge of all debts." Since Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code includes no 
exceptions, the court said it could not create one for criminal restitution 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
Only Justices Harry A. Blackmun and Sandra Day O'Connor dissented, contending 
that Congress did not mean to cover criminal restitution orders when it wrote 
the bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
"This means that criminals everywhere can get rid of restitution orders or 
criminal fines by declaring bankruptcy," said Richard A. Samp of the Washington 
Legal Foundation, which filed a court brief on behalf of several victim's 
rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
The case (Pennsylvania vs. Davenport, 89-156) was brought by Pennsylvania 
officials seeking to recover $4,145 from a couple who pleaded guilty to welfare 
fraud, but filed for bankruptcy before paying back the money. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of Tuesday's ruling, judges may be forced to send more white collar 
criminals to prison because they cannot be sure that a restitution order will 
be honored, Samp said. He also urged Congress to rewrite the bankruptcy code to 
reverse the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Justice Department told the court that 7,350 investigations were 
under way involving possible criminal fraud in the banking and S&amp;L 
industries. "In many instances, the defendants are white-collar defendants who, 
though insolvent at the conclusion of their criminal proceedings, have 
prospects for substantial future income," it said in a brief to the court. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, judges should be permitted to order such criminals to repay their 
debts to the taxpayers over many years. 
</P>
<P>
Under Tuesday's ruling, a former thrift official who is convicted of fraud may 
be sent to prison. But if he is then bankrupt, he may not be forced to repay 
the government in the future for the losses he caused. 
</P>
<P>
The federal bailout of the S&amp;L industry is expected to cost taxpayers as 
much as $325 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In other actions, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ruled that a person once convicted of drunken driving may not be prosecuted 
later for a homicide that resulted from the same car accident. The "double 
jeopardy" clause of the Fifth Amendment says that a person may not "be twice 
put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . for the same offense." 
</P>
<P>
In this case (Grady vs. Corbin, 89-474), local prosecutors in Upstate New York 
allowed Thomas Corbin to plead guilty to drunken driving and driving on the 
wrong side of the road. But other prosecutors in the same office decided later 
to charge him with homicide in the death of a motorist. But on a 5-4 vote, the 
court said this amounted to a second prosecution for the same offense and was 
therefore unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Let stand an $800,000 judgment against two Ku Klux Klan groups for a 
violent attack on civil rights marchers in Forsythe County, Ga., in 1987 
(Stephens vs. McKinney, 89-1558).

NAVAL ACADEMY BANS HAZING OF MIDSHIPWOMEN 
</P>

<P>
Naval Academy officials Tuesday issued a general order intended to stop future 
incidents of hazing or harassment of female midshipmen. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Virgil Hill Jr. issued the four-part plan, saying he wants to reaffirm 
the rights of all midshipmen at the 145-year-old institution after charges of 
hazing raised by a female midshipman who quit. 
</P>
<P>
The order states that any upper-class midshipman who violates rules governing 
physical contact with plebes can be thrown out of the academy. 
</P>
<P>
The female midshipman who resigned this month, Gwen Marie Dreyer, 19, of 
Encinitas, Calif., said male classmates handcuffed her to a urinal and took 
photographs of her. Dreyer, however, was not a plebe -- first-year midshipman. 
She said she was taunted for trying to bring charges and complained that the 
punishment for such conduct was inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is anything they are trying is better than nothing -- but I was 
not a plebe and I didn't have any problems when I was a plebe," Dreyer told The 
Times in a telephone interview from her mother's Encinitas home. 
</P>
<P>
Hill's order prohibits "horseplay" between classmates if it involves a 
midshipman against his or her will. The academy also will institute a hot line, 
allowing students to report violations to leaders and remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the order moves to implement a program to educate midshipmen on the 
issue of sexual harassment and equal opportunity, beginning with midshipmen 
entering the academy July 3. 
</P>
<P>
The order comes after Hill's announcement that he would implement a 
command-managed equal opportunity program, instead of continuing the current 
board made up of students. 
</P>
<P>
Dreyer's resignation from the academy resulted in action from higher Navy 
officials as well. On May 23, Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III asked Rear 
Adm. Ming Change, the Navy's inspector general, to review incidents at the 
academy and determine if corrective action was necessary. An investigation is 
continuing. 
</P>
<P>
Dreyer said she intended to resign with little fanfare, but family members 
convinced her that she could help improve conditions for women at the academy. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the only reason I came out with it in the first place," she said.

FUEL LEAK PROMPTS NASA TO SCRUB LAUNCH OF SHUTTLE; 
</P>
<P>
SPACE: ENGINEERS NOTICE THE PROBLEM WHEN THEY BEGIN PUMPING LIQUID HYDROGEN 
INTO COLUMBIA. A NEW LIFTOFF TIME COULD BE ANNOUNCED TODAY.

<P>
The launch of the space shuttle Columbia was scrubbed Tuesday when liquid 
hydrogen began leaking into the craft's engine compartment shortly after 
engineers started pumping the highly explosive fuel into the shuttle's main 
tank in preparation for a night launch. 
</P>
<P>
The launch, already two weeks behind schedule, was postponed for at least 24 
hours, but it probably will be delayed longer than that because it could take 
some time for engineers to determine the cause of the leakage, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Although liquid hydrogen is explosive when it comes into contact with liquid 
oxygen -- the other component in the shuttle's main fuel system -- engineers 
insisted Tuesday that the vehicle was not in danger of exploding because the 
problem was detected when only a trace amount of vapor was found in the engine 
compartment. 
</P>
<P>
"They shut it down to be safe," said Patricia Phillips, a spokeswoman for the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. "You simply cannot have excess 
hydrogen in what amounts to a controlled explosion at liftoff." 
</P>
<P>
Engineers were to work through the night to try to determine the nature of the 
problem, and a new launch date was expected to be announced sometime today. 
</P>
<P>
The launch had been set for 9:38 p.m. PDT. The 10-day mission is the first to 
be devoted to a single scientific discipline. The crew had not boarded Columbia 
when the launch was scrubbed at 3:25 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Manned by seven astronauts, the largest crew since the January, 1986, 
Challenger explosion, Columbia will be carrying the Astro observatory: three 
ultraviolet telescopes and one X-ray telescope that will photograph the 
universe at wavelengths normally obscured by the Earth's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The astronauts will operate the four telescopes around the clock for nine days, 
and perhaps 10 if their maneuvering fuel holds out, before packing them up and 
bringing them home for reuse on a later shuttle mission. 
</P>
<P>
Over the course of their mission, the astronauts are scheduled to make as many 
as 300 separate observations of objects ranging from Comet Austin, which last 
week made its closest approach to Earth, to quasars at the edge of the universe 
-- and all at wavelengths that, because they are absorbed by the atmosphere, 
have rarely been studied by astronomers in the past. 
</P>
<P>
On this fourth shuttle mission of 1990 and the 36th overall, the astronauts 
also will conduct an astronomy lesson from space for high school students, and 
payload specialist Ronald A. Parise will use a ham radio to attempt to make 
contact with cosmonauts aboard the Soviet space station Mir. 
</P>
<P>
The two spacecraft will have to be within 2,400 miles of each other for Parise 
to make contact. If the attempt is successful, it will mark the first time that 
astronauts and cosmonauts have had a direct radio link. In the historic 1975 
Apollo-Soyuz linkup, all communications between the two craft were handled 
through ground communications centers. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia commander Vance D. Brand, who was a crew member on that linkup, has 
been brushing up on his Russian for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Brand, 58, a former aviator in the Marine Corps, will be making his fourth 
space flight. In addition to the Apollo-Soyuz mission, he was commander of the 
fifth shuttle mission in 1982, which was the first to launch a commercial 
satellite, and commander of a 1984 mission. 
</P>
<P>
Pilot Guy S. Gardner, 42, is an Air Force officer who flew 177 combat missions 
in Southeast Asia in 1972 before becoming a test pilot instructor. This will be 
his second shuttle flight; he was pilot of a Defense Department mission in 
December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Mission specialist John M. (Mike) Lounge, 43, is chief of the Space Station 
Support Office, which is designing the Freedom space station. He will be making 
his third shuttle flight. He was a mission specialist on an August, 1985, 
flight in which an Australian communications satellite was launched and an 
American satellite repaired. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining four crew members all have doctorates in astronomy or 
astrophysics. 
</P>
<P>
Mission specialist Jeffrey Hoffman, 45, will be making his second flight. In 
April, 1985, he made the first unscheduled spacewalk in an unsuccessful attempt 
to rescue the malfunctioning Syncom IV-3 communications satellite. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, 53, also will be making his second flight. A Caltech graduate, he 
worked on the first Spacelab mission in November, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Parise, 38, and Samuel T. Durrance, 46, will be the first non-astronauts to fly 
on the shuttle since the Challenger accident. Parise is an employee of Computer 
Sciences Corp. of Silver Spring, Md. Durrance is a faculty member at Johns 
Hopkins University in Baltimore.

HOUSE MEMBERS' SPEAKING FEES TOP $6.5 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
HONORARIUMS: NEW DATA FOR 1989 SHOWS THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY LED IN REWARDING 
LAWMAKERS. ONE CONGRESSMAN AVERAGED A FREE TRIP A WEEK.

<P>
Even though House members have decided to forswear honorariums in the future, 
they collected $6.5 million in speaking fees from special interest groups last 
year, led by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) with $285,000, according to 
documents made public Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The tobacco industry, currently besieged by anti-smoking initiatives, was a 
clear leader in dispensing both honorariums and all-expenses-paid trips to 
House members in 1989. Nearly 30 members received $1,000 or $2,000 each and 
expenses to attend the Tobacco Institute's two-day golf and tennis outing in 
Indian Wells, Calif., in January. 
</P>
<P>
Another particularly generous group was the Connell Rice &amp; Sugar Co., which 
paid at least 17 House members $2,000 each and expenses to travel to the 
company's headquarters in Westfield, N.J., to have lunch with executives of the 
export and leasing firm. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the most traveled House member in 1989 was House Majority Whip William 
H. Gray III (D-Pa.), who took 52 trips at the expense of special interest 
groups last year -- an average of one per week -- to a variety of destinations 
including San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Tom Bevill (D-Ala.) may have set the record for the most honorariums 
collected during a single trip. As chairman of the House Appropriations 
subcommittee that decides how federal dollars will be spent for water projects, 
he collected $16,000 in back-to-back appearances in California and Arizona to 
groups interested in these appropriations. 
</P>
<P>
And the top prize for overseas travel at special interest expense went not to a 
House member, but to the wife of Rep. Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.), who made four 
trips paid for by lobbying groups to India, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, 
Indonesia and the Soviet Union. She apparently was accompanying her husband, 
who travels frequently at government expense in his role as chairman of the 
Asian and Pacific subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
This glimpse of the congressional high life emerged from a Times 
computer-assisted study of House financial disclosure reports for 1989. House 
members were required to submit their annual reports to the House clerk's 
office on May 15, but they were not released until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning next January, it will be illegal for House members to accept any 
honorariums. To compensate for the lost income, they have voted themselves a 
pay raise to $124,400 a year, which will take effect at the same time as the 
ban on honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
Although the total amount of honorariums in 1989 did not exceed recent years, 
the amount received by individual lawmakers rose substantially because at least 
112 House members voluntarily chose not to accept honorariums last year. This 
compared to about 80 who disavowed honorariums in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 315 House members who reported receiving honorariums last year, the 
median was $26,000. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike campaign contributions, speaking fees and other honorariums from special 
interests can be pocketed by House members up to a limit of $26,850 a year. But 
even though House rules require them to give the excess to charity, 
Rostenkowski was by no means the only one who earned more honorariums than he 
could keep. 
</P>
<P>
The Times study found that more than 50 House members earned more than $26,850 
in honorariums. Among the other leaders were Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) 
with $160,517; Gray with $156,098, and Rep. Willis D. Gradison Jr. (R-Ohio) 
with $105,300. 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski, chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, has long 
been a leader in honorariums and received $222,500 in 1988. Last year, his 
honorariums included $10,500 from Citicorp and $7,500 each from 25 other 
corporations or special interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous members reported receiving honorariums from the tobacco industry, and 
the recipients were certainly not limited to those who attended the industry's 
January gathering in California. Rep. Bart Gordon (D-Tenn.) may have been the 
leader in tobacco honorariums with $2,000 from RJR Nabisco, $2,000 from Phillip 
Morris and $1,000 from the Tobacco Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Connell's use of honorariums to influence House members was particularly 
unusual. Although it regularly invites House members to come to its New Jersey 
facility, Connell has no Washington lobbyist and does not sponsor a political 
action committee. 
</P>
<P>
One of the traditional leaders in congressional honorariums, the defense 
industry, was also well-represented last year. In addition to receiving defense 
honorariums, several members, including Reps. Charles Wilson (D-Tex.), Denny 
Smith (R-Ore.), William L. (Bill) Dickinson (D-Ala.), Richard H. Stallings 
(D-Ida.), Robert W. Davis (D-Mich.), Martin Olav Sabo (D-Minn.) and Alan B. 
Mollohan (D-W.Va.), took whirlwind tours of defense plants, with the costs 
divided evenly among the contractors involved. Not surprisingly, most of them 
stopped in California. 
</P>
<P>
And even though LTV Corp. has struggled through five years in Chapter 11 
bankruptcy proceedings, the Dallas-based aircraft and steel conglomerate still 
was able to give $2,000 each to many members of Congress, including Reps. Bill 
Sarpalius (D-Tex.), Tommy F. Robinson (R-Ark.), W. G. (Bill) Hefner (D-N.C.), 
Larry J. Hopkins (R-Ky.) and Duncan L. Hunter (R-San Diego). 
</P>
<P>
Although foreign travel sponsored by special interests appeared to decline 
somewhat from 1988, some lawmakers still were treated to overseas trips. 
</P>
<P>
A Taiwan interest group known as the Chinese National Assn. for Industry and 
Commerce sponsored trips to Taipei for many members and their spouses, 
including Reps. J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.), Jim Lightfoot (R-Iowa), Jim McCrery 
(R-La.), Robin Tallon (D-S.C.) and Edolphus (Ed) Towns (D-N.Y.). 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo was a popular stop. Rep. Norman D. Shumway (R-Stockton) parlayed the new 
interest in Japanese trade into three fact-finding trips to Tokyo sponsored by 
Japanese banking chief executive officers, the U.S.-Japan Economic Agenda and 
the Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the most unusual foreign conference was a four-day meeting in 
Brussels attended by Rep. Gerry Sikorski (D-Minn.) and his wife. It was 
sponsored by the Euro-Group for Animal Welfare. 
</P>
<P>
There also was the usual circuit of celebrity golf and tennis tournaments, 
which often pay travel expenses to members of Congress who wish to play. Last 
year, they included the Congressional Charity Tennis Tournament at the 
Greenbrier in West Virginia, the Congressional Charity Golf Tournament at the 
Homestead in Virginia, and the Danny Thompson Memorial Golf Tournament at Sun 
Valley, Ida. Reps. Charles W. Stenholm (D-Tex.) and Herbert H. Bateman (R-Va.) 
went to all three tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Other avid golfers were Rostenkowski and Rep. Marty Russo (D-Ill.). Russo 
attended five golf tournaments and received full travel reimbursement for three 
of them, plus $1,151 in golf-related gifts. Rostenkowski got $1,060 in gifts at 
four golf tournaments and free travel to another one. 
</P>
<P>
Even some House members who rejected honorariums were willing to travel at the 
expense of special interests. Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.) declared proudly on his 
disclosure report: "Congressman Boucher does not accept payment for his 
speaking services." Nevertheless, Boucher acknowledged taking three foreign 
trips and one three-day jaunt to San Francisco at the expense of various 
outside groups. 
</P>
<P>
While many House members such as Rostenkowski refused to disclose how they 
dispose of their excess honorariums, others listed the recipients of their 
generosity. House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich (D-Ga.), for example, gave one 
of the largest amounts -- $29,304 -- to the Atlanta Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, most members do not itemize smaller gifts they receive from 
constituents and lobbyists. Rep. Alex McMillan (R- N.C.) was an exception. His 
seven-page list of small gifts appeared typical of the stuff that House members 
collect in a given year, including a carved plaque worth $24 from the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange, three pairs of Gold Toe socks, an aerial picture of 
Charlotte, N.C., and a $3 blue coffee cup from the Best Western Skyline Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), meanwhile, revealed that he has received more than 
$15,000 from Random House as an advance payment on a book he is writing. Frank 
is currently under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for his 
acknowledged liaison with a male prostitute.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: CAN THEY TALK? YES -- JUST DON'T EXPECT FAIRNESS

"This is crazy! Why aren't these people in jail?" 
</P>
<P>
Joan Rivers is incredulous. She is outraged. And no wonder. She has just heard 
three divorced parents charge on her syndicated talk show that their young 
children had been sexually abused while in the court-ordered custody of the 
other parent. 
</P>
<P>
Each has told Rivers a similar story of a separate cold, indifferent judge who 
had ignored or rejected the evidence presented by the "good" parent and 
perpetuated a child's stay with the "bad" parent. In effect, America is told, 
this was court-mandated sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Rivers is beside herself. Her face twisted into an expression of intense 
suffering, she demands to know: "What's going on here?" 
</P>
<P>
Court is what's going on here. Talk Show Court, a TV phenomenon of the '80s 
that's seeping into the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Lose in real court? Take your case to the more sympathetic Talk Show Court. 
Clowns like Zsa Zsa do it, serious people, too. No Judge Wapners here. In this 
court, the talk show host is a hanging judge who hears what you have to say, 
commiserates, then convicts and passes sentence on the other side without 
hearing the other side. On occasions like this -- when the accused is given no 
opportunity to respond to charges against them -- Rivers is a one-person lynch 
mob. 
</P>
<P>
But she's not alone. 
</P>
<P>
At various times, and in various degrees, all the major daytime talk shows 
employ this tactic, especially during their frequent forays into volatile 
topicality. When not featuring transvestites, these shows are revolving wheels 
of adult rape and child abuse, with the consoling host invariably lending a 
sympathetic ear and siding with the underdog accuser. Nice and neat. 
</P>
<P>
Getting both sides can be a little messy. But isn't that what fairness is 
about? 
</P>
<P>
Of all the hosts, only Phil Donahue has the inclination as well as the skills 
and temperament to play devil's advocate occasionally in lieu of both sides 
being present. And give Geraldo Rivera credit for sometimes pointing out that 
viewers are hearing only one side. Too often, however, he'll then go on to 
present only that one side, hence little is gained. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Jessy Raphael is notorious for having unbalanced shows on significant 
topics. And so is Oprah Winfrey. Their sincerity isn't in question, only their 
judgment in the way they sometimes approach their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Now Winfrey puts on some great shows, for example. Her recent session with 
Truddi Chase -- a tormented woman said to have 92 separate personalities -- was 
an incredible hour that was infinitely more compelling than ABC's two-part 
drama about Chase. Winfrey was a warm and compassionate sponge, perfect for 
this occasion. When other occasions call for a different sort of host, however, 
wrong number. 
</P>
<P>
These talk show hosts grind out so many programs that there isn't time for them 
to be adequately briefed on some of the complex topics they deal with. So you 
have the impression -- especially in the case of Rivers, whose magazine format 
affords her even less time with each subject -- that they frequently go in 
almost cold. 
</P>
<P>
There's no harm when the subject is trivial. On this conveyor belt, however, 
the dancing poodle is followed by the rape victim or vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, today's talk show host is an extension of an even bigger TV phenomenon, 
the blurring of news and entertainment. These afternoon talk shows are not the 
land of Johnny Carson or Arsenio Hall, where amusement is the primary goal. 
This is the land of the entertainer/journalist who wears almost as many hats as 
Truddi Chase has personalities. 
</P>
<P>
The trend has roots in another age. That Edward R. Murrow's reputation as the 
icon of CBS News is chiseled in granite, for example, ignores his six-year 
stint in the 1950s as arm-chair host of the chatty CBS series "Person to 
Person," which was the grandfather of "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous." 
</P>
<P>
We have also the tradition of the network morning shows, where the news and 
funnies have been merging for years, where NBC's "Today," for example, calls 
upon Deborah Norville to interview both Daniel Noriega and Miss Piggy. 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, we have the tradition of the socialite journalist pioneered on TV by 
Barbara Walters. You can catch her on ABC having serious sit-downs with world 
leaders or singing and dancing with celebrities. And now Connie Chung seems 
determined to carve a similar niche for herself on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, however, the stakes seem higher on talk shows, where heavy topics are 
too often mangled by hosts who are essentially entertainers, with enlightenment 
and fairness becoming a casualty. 
</P>
<P>
The miscasting boggles. Journalist Joan Rivers? This is crazy.

'DICK TRACY' BRINGS IN ARRESTING NEW CINEMA SOUND SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
FILM: HOLLYWOOD HOPES DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY WILL DRAW MORE VIEWERS BACK INTO 
THEATERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As originally created by cartoonist Chester Gould, policeman Dick Tracy was 
ahead of his time in popularizing a lot of modern crime-stopping technology -- 
fingerprinting, night scopes, teletype, police radios and the like. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, the movie "Dick Tracy" will be used to introduce audiences to a 
new hiss-stopping technology -- digital sound for movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month Eastman Kodak and the Optical Radiation Corp. introduced a 
potentially revolutionary joint venture, Cinema Digital Sound (CDS), a 
three-years-in-the-making system that finally brings perfectly noise-free, 
deterioration-free, crystal-clear sound to the movies. 
</P>
<P>
This pristine six-track sound isn't just for showcase houses in Westwood. 
What's significant, the two companies promise, is that the technology will soon 
be available even to the smallest theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction from the industry, ever on the lookout for ways to get viewers away 
from their home entertainment centers and back into theaters, was swift. 
</P>
<P>
Several exhibitors have already signed up to put the digital equipment in their 
chains -- locally, the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood and Crest in Westwood will be 
among the first theaters to go digital -- and Touchstone was the first studio 
to announce that it would be releasing a film with a CDS sound track encoded on 
select 70-millimeter prints. 
</P>
<P>
"Dick Tracy" producer Barry Osborne says he's convinced that CDS "will become 
the standard -- I'd say within a year. It's a great concept, but more than 
that, it's a simple technology that really works. It'll start to spread to 
35-millimeter films within a year and I don't think it'll take long for 
theaters to upgrade, because it's so superior to what they have now, and not 
that costly." 
</P>
<P>
It's not yet known how many theaters will be involved in the initial "Tracy" 
rollout, but the technology will be heard in at least 100 70-millimeter, 
six-track theaters in time for this year's spate of Christmas releases. By 
April of next year, even ordinary 35-millimeter movie houses will have the 
chance to buy the decoding equipment necessary to read the digital track, which 
is printed on the film strip alongside the visual image in the place where the 
analog sound "squiggle" normally sits. 
</P>
<P>
Filmmakers have as much good reason to cheer as exhibitors, noted editor Tom 
Siiter, who worked on the ear-shattering CDS demonstration film. "Now you can 
have the same-caliber sound as a 'Lawrence of Arabia'-style epic on your 
average 35-millimeter film. An average release can be in six-track discrete 
sound -- with no increase in cost, other than mixing costs." 
</P>
<P>
Besides dazzling sound separation, having a digital track on a film print also 
opens the door to other computerized possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a foreign-language release," said Eastman Kodak marketing VP 
Leonard Coleman, "you can discretely put an English-language track in the sound 
track along with the original, and then program the decoder to read the channel 
with that language." 
</P>
<P>
Further down the line, increased off-screen special effects could also be 
automatically triggered in theaters by the MIDI control channel, in the 
sensationalistic manner of Disneyland or William Castle. 
</P>
<P>
"You now have a digital track on film that theoretically a PC computer could 
read to create motion in seats to match a ship rocking on the ocean, or fire 
lasers into the audience at a 'Star Wars'-type film," pointed out publicity 
coordinator David Harney. 
</P>
<P>
Future laser beams and explosions aside, though, theater owners want to know 
just how inexpensively they'll be able to upgrade their operations in order to 
blow patrons away now with mere sound. 
</P>
<P>
The cost isn't negligible -- around $20,000 for a decoder system for a theater 
already equipped with 70-millimeter six-track Dolby. The expense could 
conceivably be much greater for a 35-millimeter house whose creaky speaker 
system needs to be brought up to par. 
</P>
<P>
But "everybody isn't going to have to immediately yank their old speakers and 
power amplifiers out of the existing theaters," said Optical Radiation's Howard 
Flemming, who helped develop the technology. "Remember when the compact disc 
player came out and you plugged it into your existing hi-fi? Your old hi-fi did 
sound much better. 
</P>
<P>
"So there are ways of (exhibitors of lesser means) getting the system without 
having to completely renovate their entire theater. There can be a curve of 
improvement. They can control the dynamic range and bass so that the cones 
don't fly out of the screen and hit a patron in the third row." 
</P>
<P>
With many home video enthusiasts already initiated into the realm of flawless 
digital sound through laser disc players and Surround Sound speakers, making 
the theatrical aural experience at least comparable, if not better, was vital 
for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it'll have an impact where, when properly done, it'll bring people 
back into the theaters," said Coleman, reminiscing inside the renovated Eastman 
Kodak building in Hollywood. "Historically, sound technology introductions have 
increased box office. 
</P>
<P>
"This building was set up by George Eastman when he came out to Hollywood in 
1927 -- not to work on pictures, but on sound. We had the pictures really 
established before 1900, but when sound came in, it was felt engineering and 
technology needed to be brought in by an engineering group. We provided that 
free service to the industry to bring about the first sound tracks. When that 
hit, silent pictures were virtually a dud. And we're providing a needed service 
again." 
</P>
<P>
It will take years for analog-sound pictures to go the way of the silent 
picture -- or, to use a more contemporary example, the way of the vinyl record 
-- but films as old as "The Wizard of Oz" will soon be remixed and reprinted 
with the CDS system. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of film preservation, it's important as well," said "Tracy's" 
Osborne. "A digital soundtrack won't degrade the way a magnetic sound track 
does."

JAPANESE VILLAGERS TO LEAD BON DANCING WORKSHOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six dancers from the central Japanese village of Gujo Hachiman are in Los 
Angeles to lead a series of Bon dancing workshops in preparation for 
September's Los Angeles Festival. 
</P>
<P>
The dancers will teach their street "Gujo Odori" dance to members of local 
dance guilds in preparation for a large performance of street dancing that 
organizers hope will feature hundreds of Los Angeles dancers and participants 
in addition to about 50 dancers from Gujo Hachiman. The large-scale event is 
planned for the Santa Monica Pier on Sept. 15 or 16. 
</P>
<P>
"The dancing is very easy to do; this is real simple stuff," said L.A. Festival 
spokeswoman Lauren Deutsch. "There should be tons of people participating. . . 
. I don't know what the capacity of the venue is -- maybe a thousand, maybe two 
thousand. But with Bon dancing, the more the merrier." 
</P>
<P>
Deutsch noted that Gujo Hachiman is known for its all-night Bon dancing, which 
is held every summer, and that more than 10,000 people participate each year. 
</P>
<P>
The Gujo Odori is one of Japan's three major folk dance styles, and festival 
officials cited two local Japanese legends that explain its origin. According 
to one legend, the dance was started by a feudal lord in about 1624 to 
encourage communication between farmers, townspeople and warriors of Gujo 
Hachiman. The other legend says that another feudal lord started the dance 
around 1758 and that it has been practiced each summer since then. 
</P>
<P>
All dance workshops are free and open to the public. They are scheduled as 
follows: 
</P>
<P>
Today: L.A. High School for the Performing Arts, Cal State Los Angeles, P.E. 
Building Room 128, 1-3 p.m.; UCLA, Dance Building Green, 4:30-6:30 p.m.; Mario

'MOLLY DODD': A SHOW THAT REALLY DELIVERS; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: A PREGNANT LEAD IS THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT IN THE SPLENDID 'DIARY OF 
A WOMAN' ON LIFETIME CABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There's a wonderful sense of insecurity about "The Days and Nights of Molly 
Dodd" and its title character, played by Blair Brown. It's as if both the show 
itself and Molly are too sensitive and stylish for a crass medium like TV, but 
then repeatedly surprise you with a hidden indomitability that somehow enables 
them to survive for another shaky bout with life and love. 
</P>
<P>
You could easily call it "The Unsinkable Molly Dodd," considering the series's 
real-life battle simply to exist. NBC foolishly canceled it in 1988 in what has 
turned out to be a creative Waterloo for the network, but the elegant half-hour 
comedy found a home on the Lifetime cable channel, where it is seen Fridays at 
10 p.m. and repeated Saturdays at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
As for Molly, an attractive single woman in her late 30s who lives in New York 
City, she's still muddling through. At the moment, she's pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
It is, in short, a swell time to touch base with "Molly Dodd" and find out why 
its admirers are addicted to it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a diary of a woman," says Brown. "I think it would be interesting 
to track this character through her life." 
</P>
<P>
Which is why she was all for Molly getting pregnant, even though she's not yet 
sure which of two beaus is the father -- her current love interest, a black 
police detective (Richard Lawson), or her former boss (David Strathairn). 
Molly's ex-husband, a jazz musician (William Converse-Roberts), remains a 
friend, but that's all. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt," says Brown, "that particularly with Molly turning 40 years old this 
year, we had to deal with the baby issue one way or another. She either had to 
decide not to have a child, to have a child, to adopt a child, something. You 
couldn't just let it slip by, because women don't. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would make the character much more interesting if she did have a 
child, and if she had a child pretty much on her own. Molly's experience is 
always a solo one, and that's what I like to explore." 
</P>
<P>
The almost telepathic relationship between "Molly Dodd" creator Jay Tarses and 
Brown provides an astonishing bonding of dialogue and performance. So genuine 
is Brown in the role that one wonders if Tarses simply created a fictional 
replica of his star. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not exactly, he says, but if there is a main connection, "I think it's in 
the spirit of the character of Molly Dodd and the spirit of Blair. I think they 
have similar essences." 
</P>
<P>
Is there any of himself in the character of Molly? "Blair maintains that there 
is," says Tarses. "Sure, there's a lot of me. I mean, she's a woman that I 
like, a woman that I admire. If I were a woman, I think Molly Dodd is not far 
from the woman that I'd like to be. I've been married for 27 years to a woman 
who is not unlike Molly Dodd." 
</P>
<P>
e happy invention of "Molly Dodd," however, might not still be with us today 
after NBC's cancellation boner if an astute Lifetime executive, Pat Fili, 
senior vice president of programming and production, hadn't made a quick 
decision to grab it. She had her own reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt," she says, "that we had to make a decision to come out of the closet, 
so to speak, and say we were a women's network. We try to have programming that 
doesn't alienate anyone. But we had to make a statement and epitomize what we 
were by obtaining a significant program. I heard 'Molly' was canceled and 
thought, 'What a perfect show to say what we mean when we say a women's 
network.' It was a message to advertisers." 
</P>
<P>
Tarses and Brown, meanwhile, simply resumed the ideas they had begun at NBC. 
When "Molly Dodd" was being created for NBC, recalls Brown, "Jay came to New 
York, and we sat a lot at the Empire Diner and talked about all the things we 
didn't want Molly to be. We didn't want her to have a big career. We didn't 
want her to be a lot of perfect things that women were in TV. The fact that 
Molly's not an achiever was Jay's take on it. And then he went off and wrote 
her." 
</P>
<P>
But could a pregnancy cause problems with the audience, the way it did on 
"Moonlighting," which folded in great part because of that plot turn? Tarses 
says that he doesn't know how people will react to Molly having a baby but that 
"I think in 'Molly Dodd,' it enhances it all. I think it's really in the spirit 
of what 'Molly Dodd's' been all about ever since we started." 
</P>
<P>
And Brown -- does she think that perhaps the birth of the baby might be a good 
place to end the series? 
</P>
<P>
"No, I don't," she says. "I know Jay had a lot of worries about that initially. 
He just said, 'Once you get a child, it's a whole different show.' And I said, 
'I know, but the thing is that we need a whole different show. I don't know how 
long you can have her continuing to have a series of relationships with 
different men.' I thought it would be more interesting to face new and 
different problems. I would like the show to go on." 
</P>
<P>
Well, it will be for at least the 13 new episodes that end July 6 and at least 
13 more that will resume after a months-long layoff. After the cliffhanger 
pause, the series will finally disclose who the father is, after which Molly 
will give birth. 
</P>
<P>
The cliffhanger could be a bit of a trial for viewers. Lifetime is planning to 
rerun the current 13 episodes right after they end. Then it's going to carry 
"Molly Dodd" repeats five nights a week starting in September. Then, finally, 
it will launch the 13-episode conclusion of Molly's pregnancy story in January 
-- in short, after a six-month wait. 
</P>
<P>
Tarses isn't happy with the long pause in resolving the story: "I'm sorry to 
hear it." At least one source thinks Lifetime may have set a January delivery 
date for the final 13 episodes for financial reasons, perhaps cash flow -- so 
that it doesn't have to pick up all the 26 shows in a single tax year. Surely a 
quicker, real-time resolution of Molly's pregnancy is preferable -- but her 
admirers are a hardy lot who have seen her and the series through tougher 
times. 
</P>
<P>
The reruns, after all, will be there, and they are a joy individually. "The 
whole show's a diary," says Brown. And having a baby, adds Tarses, "opens up a 
lot of story-line possibilities. It just seemed like something that might have 
happened to somebody like Molly."

<P>
GRAFFITI COVERED UP BY 275 VOLUNTEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During three Saturdays in May, hundreds of gallons of paint were sloshed on 
graffiti-marred buildings, walls and houses in Anaheim as part of Paint and 
Plant Month, a new city effort to involve residents in graffiti removal and 
prevention. 
</P>
<P>
About 275 volunteers took part in the program, which city officials hope will 
encourage residents to play a bigger role in maintaining their neighborhoods 
and put pressure on those who deface property with graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the volunteers planted about two dozen shrubs in front of walls 
likely to tempt vandals. 
</P>
<P>
The Saturday volunteer program saved the city about $29,000 which would have 
been spent on staff time and materials to clean up the graffiti-tainted 
surfaces, said Bret Colson, a spokesman for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city allocated about $250,000 to fight graffiti, money that was 
spent before the year was over.

INFANT'S DROWNING CALLED ACCIDENTAL

<TEXT>
<P>
Police said Tuesday that it appears the drowning of a 8-month-old girl in a 
bathtub Monday night was accidental, but the investigation into her death 
remains open. 
</P>
<P>
Susie Aguiniga was taking a bath with her 2-year-old brother in their home in 
the 15600 block of Williams Street when the children's mother left them alone 
for a few minutes, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
"When the mother returned, the child was face up in the water and appeared to 
be dead," Sgt. Mike Shanahan said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the mother, Diega Aguiniga, tried to revive the infant and called 
paramedics, who also tried to revive the child. The infant was pronounced dead 
in the emergency room of Healthcare Medical Center of Tustin at about 8:15 
p.m., Shanahan said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, five children have drowned in swimming pools 
or hot tubs in Orange County. Drowning is said to be the leading cause of death 
in the county among children under age 5.

WAR-TORN SCHOOL DISTRICT AT PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, the Huntington Beach Union High School District had been known for 
its labor unrest. 
</P>
<P>
Bitter disputes over teachers' contracts had erupted into strikes in 1976 and 
1979, and feuds in subsequent years nearly led to more walkouts. As surely as 
teachers could expect to file their grades each semester, they could count on 
picketing, work slowdowns and denouncing trustees at board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
But things are quieter now. Contracts are amicably settled within weeks of the 
annual budget approval. Teachers now praise how the district is managed, and 
administrators are pleased by their relationship with the union. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides attribute improved relations chiefly to a 2-year-old program called 
Relationships by Objective, a labor-mediation technique adopted from the 
private sector. 
</P>
<P>
The program began after Supt. Larry Kemper and a newly elected school board 
pledged to improve labor relations. Teachers, administrators and board members 
then gathered for a weekend retreat to discuss teachers' complaints. From those 
meetings, they drafted a document that spelled out ways that the district could 
make teachers happier. 
</P>
<P>
A Relationships by Objective steering committee was appointed, including 
teachers from each of the five high schools, district administrators and board 
members. Since then, that committee has met monthly for round-table discussions 
to vent gripes, analyze school board proposals and exchange teaching and 
management ideas. 
</P>
<P>
And the results, they say, have been remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
"Before RBO, I was counting the years until my retirement," said Doug Scott, a 
Marina High School teacher and president of the teacher's union. "Now I don't 
even think about it. It has helped me do my job better, and therefore, it makes 
me enjoy what I'm doing more." 
</P>
<P>
And as more teachers become involved in the process, it has gained increasing 
support, participants say. Under the program, up to 85% of the teachers at each 
high school serve on subcommittees that address such issues as attendance, 
discipline, curriculum and disaster preparation. 
</P>
<P>
One of the district's biggest labor relations problems, teachers say, was 
dealing with the suspicion that administrators were not being truthful with the 
union about some parts of the budget. 
</P>
<P>
"But because of the open communication we now have, (teachers) know we're not 
fabricating anything," said Bonnie Castrey, a five-year school board member who 
helped establish the program and serves on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
A similar program for the district's classified employees, called Team Building 
and Communication, has also been started and has yielded similar results, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Castrey, a professional labor mediator, predicts such programs will become a 
cornerstone of shared decision-making in public education. JOHN PENNER

MASKED ROBBER GETS $22,000 AT RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A masked gunman escaped with more than $22,000 from Newport Landing, the entire 
receipts from the busiest weekend ever for the Fun Zone restaurant, police said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
It was 2:30 a.m. Monday and manager Michael Pavlin had already stashed the 
record $22,000 in cash and credit card receipts in his office safe. Bartenders 
David Dwyre and Ben Swenson were tallying their tips. They had counted up $100 
when a man dressed in black and wearing a ski mask burst into the office, 
brandishing a handgun, Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
The robber threw down two pairs of handcuffs and ordered Swenson to handcuff 
Dwyre. 
</P>
<P>
"I put one side on but the other side wouldn't snap," Swenson said Tuesday. "He 
apparently took offense and punched me on my head." 
</P>
<P>
After the robber handcuffed Dwyre, he forced Swenson to kneel, held the gun to 
the back of his head, and slapped the second pair of handcuffs on the 
bartender's wrists. 
</P>
<P>
Swenson who has worked at the restaurant for the past 2 1/2 years, said: "I 
kept thinking, 'I hope he doesn't shoot us. And if he shoots, I hope he shoots 
me first. I don't want to wait for the third bullet.' " 
</P>
<P>
Gonis said the robber forced Pavlin to open the safe. He then tied the manager 
with duct tape, grabbed the money, including the bartenders' tips, and fled. 
</P>
<P>
Pavlin wriggled out of the tape and called police, who had to use a bolt cutter 
to free the other men. 
</P>
<P>
Swenson said he believed that the bandit had hidden in the restaurant before 
closing hours. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pouring outside and he was dry when he came in the office," Swenson 
said. "He had to be inside for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Gonis said it "appeared to be a well-planned job. (The robber) picked an 
unusual time of the morning, and he brought in his own handcuffs and tape. He 
knew what he was doing." 
</P>
<P>
John Bullard, the restaurant's general manager, said it was the only armed 
robbery in the Fun Zone in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm upset and mad," Bullard said. "But I thank God that no one got hurt."

UCI GETS FUNDS FOR BRAIN CANCER STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles hospital has given UC Irvine a $208,000 grant for research into 
the use of the body's immune system to combat brain cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The grant from the Hospital of the Good Samaritan in Los Angeles to UCI's 
Cancer Research Institute will support basic studies by Gale Granger, a 
professor of molecular biology and biochemistry. 
</P>
<P>
Granger's approach to the battle against brain cancer is threefold. 
</P>
<P>
First, he has been studying the effect of concentrated amounts of natural 
cancer-killing substances that are produced by the body's immune system. So 
far, injecting patients with those materials has proven largely ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
A second approach is to grow certain human immune cells and implant the cell 
culture following brain cancer surgery. In clinical trials on patients with a 
type of brain tumor known as recurrent glioblastoma, delays in the recurrence 
of cancer have been seen in 10% to 20% of cases, Granger said. 
</P>
<P>
A third method under examination is to identify toxins produced by tumors. 
</P>
<P>
The gift from Good Samaritan is expected to speed further study and a new round 
of clinical trials, institute officials said.

SCHOOL HAS TLC ALONG WITH ABCS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
School was never a pleasant place for 12-year-old Chris Smith, a loner who was 
often taunted by classmates for everything from not knowing an answer in class 
to missing a catch on the football field. He was the boy who didn't fit in. 
</P>
<P>
But Chris, and other students like him, have found a haven at the Mardan Center 
of Educational Therapy in Irvine, where students of normal intelligence learn 
to build the academic skills, self-confidence and friendships that they may be 
lacking. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these kids are, for whatever reason, unhappy in the public school 
system," said teacher Jan Gartner. "Public school is just too large a situation 
for them, and they feel isolated. Here they don't have all the pressures of the 
world, and the environment here helps the child to develop in every way." 
</P>
<P>
Mardan is a private, nonprofit school for students between the ages of 3 and 
18. The school was founded in 1962 by David A. Eisenman, who still serves as 
its executive director. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized that there were no programs for kids with average intelligence who 
were having problems," Eisenman said. "They had special education for the 
retarded and the blind, but no classes for the kids who needed extra, 
specialized techniques to get them through." 
</P>
<P>
Eisenman's school has taught more than 4,000 students since 1962, when his 
dream began in a tiny office in Costa Mesa with two students. 
</P>
<P>
Today, an average of 100 students attend Mardan each year. In January, the 
school relocated from Costa Mesa to a new, $6.5-million facility in Irvine with 
eight classrooms, a gym, a kitchen and numerous smaller rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Fund-raising for the new facility was boosted this month when the Irvine Health 
Foundation, which supports health education and research in the greater Irvine 
area, offered to match donations up to $200,000 and pledged an additional, 
unrestricted $300,000 over the next three years, said Judge David Sills, 
foundation chairman. Mardan raised the matching $200,000 in donations. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the students spend two to three years at Mardan before returning to 
public schools. Some, like Chris Smith, work to develop self-confidence. 
Others, who display short attention spans or impulsive behavior, learn to take 
responsibility for their actions, Eisenman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We give students the message that they are not dumb or stupid, and despite the 
fact that they may be having problems, they're OK," Eisenman said. "Here, they 
get the support they need to move on with their lives. They are sat down and 
told of their potential and told that they have the potential to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to see these kids get through high school and be productive 
individuals instead of ending up being a burden on society and winding up in 
prison or a psychiatric facility." 
</P>
<P>
Classes take place in an intimate setting where there are two teachers for 
every six students. 
</P>
<P>
This special kind of education doesn't come cheap. It costs $89 a day to attend 
Mardan, said Edith Ritz, program administrator. More than half of the students 
are privately placed by their parents, while others are referred by public 
schools. Many students attend with the help of a partial scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"Our students come from all walks of life," Eisenman said. "We want to be able 
to offer help to all kids." GREG HERNANDEZ

WHEN YOU WISH UPON A STADIUM

<TEXT>
<P>
Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter was effusive the other day after his city settled 
lawsuits that have blocked construction of a proposed indoor sports arena. 
Basking in the glow, he declared, "We are to become . . . the sports capital of 
America." 
</P>
<P>
Well, not so fast. Anaheim has enjoyed remarkable decades of benefits beginning 
with Walt Disney's decision to build an amusement park amid the orange groves. 
It's true that setting aside menacing lawsuits with the Los Angeles Rams, a 
nearby mobile home park and Anaheim Stadium Associates clears obstacles along 
the road. But it is perhaps a sign of the times that even the Disney rabbit's 
foot has been dangling in front of others in recent years, in distant Florida 
and, now, in Anaheim's competition with Long Beach for a new Disney theme park.

The competitiveness of the times is evidenced by Santa Ana's shrewd angling to 
get the indoor arena first, and almost everybody agrees that the Orange County 
area cannot support two such stadiums. But in the race to the finish line, it's 
important to recognize that these are different times from the days when Orange 
County was one big Frontierland. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim needs prudence to match its enthusiasm. It ought to be careful that it 
does not commit so much public money and city prestige to the idea of having an 
indoor arena that it gives away all leverage. Already the city has raised $18 
million through the sale of bonds to buy various parcels of land. To do that, 
it raised the motel tax, but there is still no arena in sight, nor any teams to 
play in it. 
</P>
<P>
The city has agreed now to pay three plaintiffs $300,000 in attorneys' fees and 
possibly another $400,000 in damages to one. The cost of the stadium, which 
when first discussed was about $40 million, went up to $94 million, with a plan 
for public subsidy of up to $1.5 million a year. Now, because of the cost, the 
city is going to spend nearly half a million dollars for an architect to design 
a less- expensive arena than first proposed. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim believes that it can recoup much from the developer. But it still 
doesn't have one to recoup from. The more it commits before it does, the more 
that developer can insist on favorable terms. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim essentially is positioning itself to be in the real estate business, 
with all its risks. It may one day proudly boast, as its mayor suggests, that 
it is the sports capital of America. However, its dream shouldn't get too far 
out ahead of the city's best financial interests. Hold the superlatives for 
now.

SEAL BEACH CREATES HOUSING PANEL

The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday night to appoint a citizens 
committee to review a recently approved housing plan to see if revisions are 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The committee was proposed by Councilwoman Marilyn Bruce Hastings, who took 
office May 15. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the five council members may appoint up to four residents to the 
committee, which will study details of the city's strategy for dealing with 
future housing needs. Changes recommended by the committee will be considered 
by the Planning Commission and the City Council, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
In March, a judge blocked Seal Beach from approving major residential projects 
because the city's state-mandated housing plan was obsolete. The state requires 
the plan to be updated every five years, and Seal Beach failed to submit its 
new plan by last summer's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The outgoing City Council approved a new version of the plan during a meeting 
May 10 that lasted past midnight. Hastings is critical of that plan, saying it 
"has many inconsistencies." 
</P>
<P>
The council also voted Tuesday to conclude public hearings and end meetings by 
midnight unless a majority of the council wants either of them to last longer. 
The guidelines, proposed by Hastings, were in response to the council's 
marathon meetings earlier this month that lasted as late as 4:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just not good business practice" to conduct business at those hours, 
Hastings said. 
</P>
<P>
The council opened a public hearing Tuesday to consider Mola Development 
Corp.'s controversial plan to build a 329-unit project on the Old Hellman Ranch 
property but was expected to continue that hearing to a special meeting later 
this week or until the next regular council meeting June 13. 
</P>
<P>
Mola's option to purchase the property for the $200-million project expires 
Friday.

TITANS OPEN THE FIRST ROUND OF SERIES AGAINST OKLAHOMA ST.

Cal State Fullerton, sixth-seeded in the College World Series, will begin its 
quest for a third national championship Saturday when the Titans play 
third-seeded Oklahoma State at 5:10 p.m. PDT at Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
The series, in its 44th year, begins Friday, when top-seeded Stanford plays 
eighth-seeded Georgia Southern at 1:10 p.m. and fourth-seeded Georgia plays 
fifth-seeded Mississippi State at 5:10 in Rosenblatt Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's action will begin at 1:10 p.m. with second-seeded Louisiana State 
playing The Citadel, which upset Miami 4-1 Tuesday to win the Atlantic Regional 
and earn the tournament's seventh seed. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament is split into two, four-team, double-elimination brackets, the 
first consisting of Friday's participants and the second of Saturday's. The 
winners of each bracket will meet in a single game, scheduled for June 9, for 
the national title. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton Coach Larry Cochell was glad to see the Titans weren't in the same 
bracket as Stanford, which has been ranked No. 1 in the nation for the past 
month. The Cardinal, which swept a three-game series from Fullerton early this 
season, eliminated the Titans from the 1988 series. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is tough when you get to the College World Series, but if I had to 
pick one team, Stanford is the team to beat," Cochell said. "With their great 
pitching and defense, they're going to be difficult to beat." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton had a 4-0 record in the Central Regional at Austin, Tex. The Titans 
(36-21) beat host Texas twice, 5-2, Sunday and, 3-0, Monday. Fullerton opened 
the regional with a 16-3 victory over Old Dominion and then beat Creighton, 
6-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans, ranked fourth in Tuesday's Collegiate Baseball-ESPN poll and ninth 
by Baseball America, made only one error in the regional. They outscored their 
opponents, 30-8, and outhit them, 44-27. 
</P>
<P>
Five Fullerton pitchers combined for a 2.00 earned-run average and sophomore 
right-hander James Popoff won two games, including a four-hit shutout of the 
Longhorns Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Bunch, who replaced David Ayala in right field for the first Texas game, 
batted .556 (five for nine) in the regional with a home run and three runs 
batted in. Third baseman Phil Nevin hit .467 (seven for 15) with three RBIs, 
and left fielder Rich Gonzales batted .400 (six for 15) with a home run and 
five RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we have as good a shot as anyone," Cochell said. "We're playing 
awfully good baseball right now." 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma State (53-16) swept through the West II Regional, defeating host 
Arizona State twice, 17-9, Sunday and, 10-5, Monday. The Cowboys, ranked second 
and third in the two national polls, made only one error in the regional, 
outscored their opponents, 48-16, and outhit them, 54-31. 
</P>
<P>
Like Fullerton, Oklahoma State has three solid starting pitchers -- junior 
right-hander Dennis Burbank, a former Valencia High standout who played at 
Pepperdine and Cypress College before transferring to Oklahoma State, senior 
right-hander Gordie Tipton and freshman right-hander Brad Gore.

GIRLS' SWIMMING: THE CAPISTRANO VALLEY SENIOR CAN RELAX SINCE WINNING A 
SOUTHERN SECTION CHAMPIONSHIP IN FOUR CONSECUTIVE YEARS.

<P>
Christy Carolin said she is happy her high school swim career is finally over. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that her four years of swimming for Capistrano Valley High School were 
anything to be depressed about. On the contrary, Carolin had tremendous success 
at the Southern Section 4-A meet during her career. 
</P>
<P>
Carolin, The Times' swimmer of the year, won the 50-yard freestyle championship 
four consecutive years, a feat accomplished by only three other female swimmers 
in Southern Section history. She also won the 100 freestyle as a sophomore and 
a senior. 
</P>
<P>
But with each victory came the pressure to continue winning. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to go out and win, and I did," said Carolin, who will swim for the 
University of Arizona next year. "But there's a lot less stress now that's it 
over." 
</P>
<P>
When Carolin was a freshman, her goal was to win the 50 freestyle four 
consecutive years. At that time, she didn't realize that, by doing so, she 
would join an elite group of Southern Section swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
Only Janet Evans of El Dorado (500 freestyle), Jill Sterkle of Hacienda Heights 
Wilson (100 freestyle) and Shannon Orcutt of Capistrano Valley (100 
breaststroke) had won their events four consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought a lot of people had done it," Carolin said. "Then Coach (Don) 
Cholodenko told me earlier this year that I could be one of the few to win four 
straight years. That put more pressure on me to win." 
</P>
<P>
Not that she needed more pressure. During her four years at Capistrano Valley, 
Carolin never lost in the 50 freestyle, so winning that event had become 
expected of her. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to go out and win every time," Carolin said. "My friends would come see 
me swim and when I won it was like no big deal. But if I would have lost, 
everyone would have been real shocked." 
</P>
<P>
Carolin has been swimming competitively since age 8. She got involved because 
of her sister, Kim Carolin, who swam for the YMCA in Spokane, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Christy Carolin went to most of her sister's workouts and was talked into 
trying out for the team by the coach. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Why don't you get in and swim instead of watching,' " Carolin said. 
"When I won my first race, he said, 'Hey, this is your sport, go do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
And Carolin has. 
</P>
<P>
When her father was transferred to Southern California six years ago, Carolin 
and her sister joined the Mission Viejo Nadadores. She later moved to the 
Irvine Novaquatics when she was a sophomore and then last season joined the 
Saddleback Valley Aquatics. 
</P>
<P>
Carolin continued to improve as a sprinter and, as a freshman, she edged her 
sister in the 50 freestyle at the Southern Section 4-A championships. Kim 
Carolin, then a sophomore, was the defending champion in the event. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't surprised that I won," Christy Carolin said. "I knew there was going 
to be some tough competition, especially from Kim. But I wanted to win the 50 
all four years, so I had to win as a freshman." 
</P>
<P>
This season was the toughest for Carolin. During the winter she had to fight a 
series of illnesses, ranging from the flu to colds. She also strained muscles 
in her neck during winter vacation, which slowed her training. 
</P>
<P>
"That's usually one of the best times for training, because you can go 
two-a-days and still sleep in," Carolin said. "With the colds and the neck 
injury, I wasn't getting enough time in the pool. I was worried that I would be 
behind in training for the Southern Section meet." 
</P>
<P>
She wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Carolin was the top qualifier during the prelims and won the final with a time 
of 23.69 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"My first thought was, 'It's over,' " Carolin said. "Now I could concentrate on 
college and how well I was going to do there. I still have a lot to 
accomplish."

MARINA COMES ON STRONG TO WIN, 9-0

<P>
For the second year in a row, Marina High School eliminated Mater Dei from the 
Southern Section 5-A softball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
This time around, it was by a score of 9-0 in Tuesday's semifinal game at 
Heritage Park in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Marina (27-5), which plays Newbury Park for the championship 
Saturday at 8 p.m. at Mayfair Park in Lakewood, came out quickly, scoring two 
runs in the first inning, four in the second and one more in the third before 
slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
"Marina comes out there and they're just so aggressive," Mater Dei Coach Cathy 
Quesnell said. "They came out with momentum. I mean they don't usually come out 
with that much. We were caught back on our heels. 
</P>
<P>
"We practice that, too, being really aggressive and trying to stop the kind of 
offense they have, where they run and gun and hit anywhere and chop it on the 
ground, bunt, squeeze. . . . We practiced that over and over the last couple of 
weeks and I don't know, it's tough." 
</P>
<P>
Marina continually made solid contact at the plate -- it had two home runs and 
a triple among its 10 hits -- and was flawless in the field. 
</P>
<P>
"They were just getting all of the bat on the ball," Marina Coach Susie 
Calderon said of her players. "They were hitting in the gaps, and those were 
solid, solid hits, they weren't just fly balls. They hit the ball hard on the 
infield . . . 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted this so badly. It's been a long time for Marina." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the Vikings lost in the finals to Kennedy in 19 innings, and last won 
a section title under Coach Betsy Ward in 1975, Calderon said. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-seeded Mater Dei ran into trouble with a freshman on the mound. But 
Monarch pitcher Jennifer Clark wasn't helped any by her teammates' four errors, 
all of which came in the first three innings. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Mater Dei lost to Marina in the first round when Terri Kobata got 
freshman jitters in the first inning and allowed the winning run to score. This 
year, Kobata was sidelined in March with a shoulder injury, leaving Clark as 
the Monarchs' No. 1 pitcher. She compiled a 15-2 record, but Marina applied too 
much pressure Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Her coach said Clark lost confidence in all her pitches and just wanted to 
throw the fastball. 
</P>
<P>
"The fastball was just going over and they were cranking it," Quesnell said. 
"She's a freshman and it's a ton of pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Clark finished with one strikeout, one hit batter and one walk. 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Julie Muche had a two-run double and scored three times for 
Marina, and teammates Annie Presutti and Mindy Burgess each hit home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei (22-4) managed only two hits and two baserunners -- neither of whom 
advanced past second -- against senior Janet Miyahara (15-1), who had seven 
strikeouts.

GARDEN GROVE BREAKS THROUGH TO EDGE PACIFICA

<P>
It took until the seventh inning for Garden Grove High School to get its first 
hit off Pacifica pitcher Jennifer Surface Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
It took only an inning more for the Argonauts to get a run, and that is all it 
usually takes when Stephanie Smith is on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Maria Romero, a pinch-runner, scored in the bottom of the eighth to 
give Garden Grove and Smith a 1-0 victory in the Southern Section 4-A softball 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
The Argonauts will meet Charter Oak, a 2-0 winner over Kennedy, for the 
division championship Friday at 8 p.m. at Mayfair Park in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's victory was the third of the season for the Argonauts (25-4-1) over 
Garden Grove League rival Pacifica, which finished 15-9. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who has allowed only one run in four playoff games, retired the final 20 
batters after allowing her second hit, a single in the second inning. But Smith 
said she was nervous in the early going. 
</P>
<P>
"The first couple of innings I was kind of rattled," she said. "She (Surface) 
was striking us all out and they were getting some hits off of me." 
</P>
<P>
Surface, a sophomore, struck out 12 and only allowed one baserunner -- she 
walked designated hitter Carol Blakeman in the second -- until the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the seventh, Garden Grove's Michelle Cash reached first on an 
error by second baseman Cindy Stoecklein, and Becky Eggers followed with the 
Argonauts' first hit of the game, a double to right-center. Surface walked Cari 
White intentionally to load the bases and then struck out Blakeman and Briana 
Corona, each on called third strikes. 
</P>
<P>
But Pacifica couldn't dodge defeat in the eighth. Celeste Gordon, who had 
struck out in each of her first two at-bats, led off with an infield single and 
took second on a throwing error by third baseman Lisa Mascarenos. Romero ran 
for Gordon, and after Nakia Houston struck out, Smith was intentionally walked. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly White then hit a ground ball to second, which Stoecklein fielded. 
Stoecklein tried to tag Smith as she ran by but missed, and her late throw to 
second rolled behind the base allowing Romero to score. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who struck out six and allowed only two baserunners, said she found a 
groove after her early struggles. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt strong," she said. "I just was more confident and I knew that they 
could not beat me. Even if they get a couple of singles here and there, they 
couldn't beat me."

Bases loaded and no outs. Time to call for help. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Newbury Park pitcher Lea Lopez took control and retired the next 21 
batters to lead her team to a 1-0 victory over Fountain Valley in a Southern 
Section 5-A semifinal at Golden West College. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez had walked the first two batters she faced and then gave up a hit to load 
the bases. 
</P>
<P>
She said she couldn't remember the last time she had walked two consecutive 
batters. "I was just so nervous, thinking, 'Oh, this is the semifinals,' " she 
said. "I was just getting the bugs out. But finally, I loosened up." 
</P>
<P>
And, after finding her rhythm, she struck out 11. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park scored its only run in the first inning. With one out, Cami Ferris 
bunted and reached first on a throwing error by Fountain Valley pitcher Rae 
Rice. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez singled to right field with Ferris stopping at second. One out later, 
Marcie James grounded to shortstop, but Kristin Santa Cruz's throw to first was 
wild and Ferris scored from second. 
</P>
<P>
When Fountain Valley came up in the bottom of the first, Lopez walked the first 
two batters. Catcher Shannon Dolan followed with a single to center. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, however, was not fazed. Rice grounded to James, who forced Jennifer 
Alchin out at home. Lopez then struck out Kravik and retired Jody Bixler, who 
bunted straight at her. 
</P>
<P>
"(Lopez) is definitely one of the top three pitchers (we've faced), that's for 
sure," Fountain Valley Coach Cary Baker said. "She moved the ball around, 
changed speeds and kept us off balance. She kept the ball down -- we haven't 
seen anyone who kept the ball down as much as she did. 
</P>
<P>
"After that first inning, it was a pitcher's duel," Baker said. "They took 
advantage of the first inning, and we didn't. After that, no one challenged 
anything."

WOODBRIDGE NEEDS TO GO DEEP INTO LINEUP TO WIN 
</P>

<P>
Members of the Woodbridge High School tennis team, the Southern Section's 
top-ranked 3-A squad, ran off their bus cheering and shouting before a big 
match earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
That's normal rah-rah stuff for football or basketball teams, but rare in the 
staid world of tennis, even high school team tennis. 
</P>
<P>
But then the Warriors are not your normal team. Their top doubles team plays in 
the No. 2 spot, even though it beat the No. 1 team, won the league championship 
and advanced to the round of 16 in the Southern Section doubles tournament last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
And it's rarer still for a team to be as deep as Woodbridge. Normally, one or 
two top-ranked players dominate, but, as one rival coach says, their top seven 
players are almost interchangeable. 
</P>
<P>
"A real concerted team effort," is how Woodbridge assistant coach Joan Willett 
describes the Warriors, who face San Marino for the 3-A championship at 2 today 
at the Racquet Club of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Depth, a team spirit and a budding championship tradition are on the Warriors' 
side as they seek a second consecutive title. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Woodbridge edged Sunny Hills, 10-8, to win its first championship. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Woodbridge is 21-3 and has been the 3-A's top-ranked team most of 
the season. San Marino (21-0 and the third-seeded team) knocked off Laguna 
Beach Thursday to advance to the title match. 
</P>
<P>
"Woodbridge could win," said Laguna Beach Coach Bob Walton, whose team lost to 
Woodbridge twice this season. "They're deeper . . . they're capable of 
winning." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike last season, when Woodbridge could count on three victories from Randy 
Ivey, its burly No. 1 singles player, and at least two from Alex Steinhardt, 
its No. 2 player, the Warriors don't have one or two standouts. 
</P>
<P>
Ivey and Steinhardt have graduated, leaving a balanced lineup with only 
marginal differences between the top nine players. 
</P>
<P>
"They know they all have to pull together, to contribute, or there's no way 
we'll win," Willett said. 
</P>
<P>
On most days, barring upsets in practice, the Woodbridge lineup stacks up this 
way: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In singles, Chris Emery, a senior, plays at No. 1; Rajan Saggar, a senior, 
is No. 2, and sophomore Erik Berg No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In doubles, juniors Darren Isaacman and Victor Ro play at No. 1, seniors 
Brett Isaacman and Reza Nilforoushan are at No. 2, and sophomores Steve Shevel 
and Rajeev Saggar are the No. 3 team. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Isaacman and Nilforoushan were the surprise winners of the Pacific Coast 
League doubles title and advanced to the round of 16 in the Southern Section 
tournament before falling to Sean McKenna and Derek Shinden of Thousand Oaks, 
6-1, 6-0. McKenna and Shinden reached the final, but lost. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-A final features two unbeaten teams. Dana Hills (22-0 and second-seeded) 
plays host to top-seeded Santa Barbara (23-0) at 3 today at El Niguel Racquet 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills is led by Ben Stevens, its No. 1 singles player. Peter Jeschke, 
Santa Barbara's No. 1 singles player, was a semifinalist in the Southern 
Section individual tournament last week.

STUDY: MORE NEW O.C. HOMES PRICED BELOW $300,000 
</P>

New homes in Orange County still are among the most expensive in the nation, 
but a new study shows that builders, spooked by a sales slowdown over the past 
eight months, are pricing more of their product under $300,000 than in years 
past. 
</P>
<P>
The First American Title Insurance Co. survey of all new homes being sold in 
the county from mid-February to mid-March shows that while the average sales 
price was $404,035 -- and the median, or halfway mark, was $375,900 -- about 
455 homes were available at $300,000 or less. 
</P>
<P>
That compares to only about 225 homes in the sub-$300,000 price range just six 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The lowest-priced home in the survey, at $190,000, was a two-bedroom, two-bath 
model in Aliso Viejo built by J.M. Peters Co. -- a Newport Beach firm that made 
its reputation as a luxury home builder offering homes in the range of $300,000 
to $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Hoover, an assistant vice president at First American Title, said the 
survey appears to confirm what industry consultants have been saying for 
months: County builders have priced homes out of the reach of many buyers and 
need to bring prices down to ensure a healthy market. 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say that the county did not have high-priced new homes for sale. 
The most expensive homes in the survey, in Monarch Beach in Dana Point, were 
priced at $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The First American study shows that about a third of the 1,855 new homes on the 
market at the time the survey was conducted were priced at $400,000 or more. A 
year earlier, however, that figure was about 40%, or 210 of 515 new homes on 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
The number of new homes on the market has increased dramatically in the last 
year. The March survey's total was nearly double the 978 unsold units reported 
by First American just six months earlier in its survey of August, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The title insurance firm's surveys provide a snapshot of conditions, trends and 
fluctuations in the county's new-home market at the time each is taken. First 
American conducts the surveys twice a year, compiling information about every 
subdivision in the county that is selling homes. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent survey shows a huge increase in the number of subdivisions 
actively selling homes -- 128, in contrast with 85 six months earlier and 146% 
more than the 52 of March, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
It also shows a huge increase over the last year in the number of units 
builders say they are planning to construct. The current figure, 16,958 units, 
is more than 2.5 times the 6,664 units proposed a year earlier and is 35% 
higher than the 12,570 units proposed six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in proposed units, Hoover said, shows how seriously developers 
took the threat of a housing slowdown when slow-growth proponents qualified a 
development-limiting measure for the ballot two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Developers raced to process as many applications as they could to beat the 
June, 1988, deadline that passage of the measure would have imposed on them. 
Although the slow-growth measure was defeated, the applications for building 
permits were already filed, and builders were reluctant to withdraw them. 
</P>
<P>
So, the jump in the number of subdivisions and proposed housing units, Hoover 
said, reflects the cumulative effect of all those applications being processed 
and the building permits being issued. 
</P>
<P>
"All the work the builders pushed through to beat the deadline," he said, 
"showed up in the last part of 1989 and the early part of this year, and that's 
what we're seeing now. But we expect to see the number start to diminish again 
in future surveys." 
</P>
<P>
The large number of homes on the market -- and the increased number priced at 
or below $300,000 -- has helped keep sales alive throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
The overall sales average of 1.2 units per week is down from 1.8 units a week 
six months earlier. But because there were more subdivisions selling homes in 
the most recent study, total sales were almost identical at 153.6 units a week, 
compared to 153 units a week last August. 
</P>

</P>

Current Unsold Inventory 
</P>
<P>
The number of unsold homes reflects both a flattening of sales and an increase 
in the number of new homes being built.

GALLERY TUNES IN ON WORK OF BLACK ARTISTS; 
</P>
<P>
ART: CAPITALIZING ON 'THE COSBY SHOW'-INSPIRED POPULARITY OF BLACK WORKS, 
MELVIN SUMMERS OPENED A SHOP IN POMONA. HE HOPES TO HELP UNKNOWN ARTISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Former tire store manager Melvin Summers' dream of owning a black art gallery 
came true with the flip of a television dial and the help of one of America's 
favorite small-screen families, the Huxtables of "The Cosby Show." 
</P>
<P>
No, Bill Cosby did not finance or endorse Summers' Pomona gallery, the Ebony 
Music and Art center. But when Cosby began decorating the Huxtable living room 
with paintings by black artists, America began to tune in to the 
African-American art phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, in some circles at least, the work of painter Ellis Wilson became as 
famous as the tapestry-patterned sweaters Cosby wears on the show. A Cosby 
episode was built around a Wilson painting called "The Funeral Procession," a 
print of which is on display at Ebony. 
</P>
<P>
"This is art that blacks can identify with. They can see themselves in these 
images," said Summers, who says his Ebony gallery is unique in the San Gabriel 
Valley. He opened the gallery two years ago, capitalizing on the 
television-inspired popularity that led to black artists' works being sold at 
swap meets and then at home shows similar to Tupperware parties. 
</P>
<P>
Black artists have been around for centuries, but they have had little 
recognition in the mainstream art gallery network, said Lizzetta 
LeFalle-Collins, curator of visual arts at the Los Angeles Afro-American Museum 
in Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
"These artists went unnoticed until more blacks in the (art) field began to 
write about them and promote their work," LeFalle-Collins said. "Also, with 
American art getting more and more expensive, art collectors and dealers are 
always looking for the unfound artist." 
</P>
<P>
Summers, 52, of Upland, hopes to launch a few of these unfound black masters. 
</P>
<P>
From his shopping center storefront, he sells limited-edition prints and 
artists' proofs from both undiscovered and nationally known black artists. The 
prints include works by Ernie Barnes, Walt Walker, Paul Njalamba, Albert Mukasa 
Wilson and Herb Jeffries. He also sells art objects and cultural artifacts from 
nine African nations. 
</P>
<P>
Summers also sells black popular music and gospel, which he admits is mainly a 
way to bring foot traffic into his 1,300-square-foot gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the only store of this kind in the area outside of downtown Los 
Angeles," Summers said. "It was a risk opening this place -- a big risk. But 
we're beginning to attract the clientele we're after." 
</P>
<P>
Summers, a native of St. Louis, always had an interest in art, but that love 
stayed dormant while he worked as a manager with the Mark C. Bloome tire 
company. It took a trip to Paris 3 1/2 years ago to rekindle the spark. 
</P>
<P>
"I just went wild in the Louvre," Summers said. "It was incredible to be that 
close to the Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo." Since then, he has spent much of his 
spare time reading up on art, meeting artists and learning all he can about the 
techniques used in various art media. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Summers and his wife, Aliitasi, decided to fulfill their dream, 
choosing the Pomona location because they would not have any local competition 
and because of its proximity to booming new communities like Phillips Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Most of his customers are black -- about 95%, he said. "They like the fact that 
they can see themselves in the work," Summers explained. 
</P>
<P>
However, the personal connection with the work can sometimes work against a 
sale. One customer, he said, stared at a print of a nightclub singer for a full 
five minutes before she rejected it. "That lady looks just like a lady I knew 
in Kansas City that I couldn't stand," the potential buyer announced before she 
turned on her heel. 
</P>
<P>
Each piece of art, whether it features African scenes or black Americans, makes 
its own statement, said Alma Derritt, a customer of Summers who began 
collecting black art a few years ago. "As a black female, I can purchase a 
piece of art that will be a part of my heritage and that I can pass on to my 
children and my grandchildren," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The store's merchandise sells for between $30 and $1,500, so Derritt said she 
purchases the pieces sparingly and considers them investments. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the pleasure of shopping at Ebony, Derritt said, is drawing on Summers' 
familiarity with the works of artists in the collection. "Every time he gives 
me a piece of information on a particular work, he just glows," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Summers' goal is to make art available to the average person. By selling prints 
signed and numbered by the artists, rather than lithographs or originals, he 
keeps the cost down. He also offers a layaway plan. 
</P>
<P>
Artist Charles A. Bibbs, who recently held a show at Summers' gallery, said 
stores like Summers' are a way of getting the art out to the people it was 
designed for -- much as Cosby's television program showcases black artists' 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"As black society gets more into the finer things in life, their status in 
society increases," Bibbs said. "In the past, it was fashionable only for the 
rich to collect art. Now we're creating positive role models on TV and in the 
media and we're giving our community something to be proud of."

OPERA PACIFIC WEIGHS ACCEPTING NEA'S GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opera Pacific has received an $18,000 grant from the National Endowment for the 
Artsfor the company's 1990-91 season, but given the controversy surrounding an 
anti-obscenity clause recently attached to NEA grant acceptance forms, company 
officials are considering whether to accept the money. 
</P>
<P>
The NEA is requiring all groups that receive grants to sign a form 
acknowledging that they will not produce works that could be judged obscene and 
that do not meet undefined standards of artistic excellence. Some artists and 
organizations have refused to accept NEA grants recently because of the 
anti-obscenity clause. The Newport Harbor Art Museum's board voted last week to 
strike the clause before signing the form. 
</P>
<P>
"Obscenity, which obviously is in the mind of the beholder, can be construed to 
apply to almost anything," Opera Pacific general director David DiChiera said 
Tuesday from Detroit. DiChiera is also general director of Michigan Opera 
Theater. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, opera, an art form that combines all the other arts, has many 
possibilities of doing things either visually or in dance or dramatically that 
might be construed from a narrow point of view as perhaps not passing the quote 
'litmus test.' " 
</P>
<P>
DiChiera said the Opera Pacific board has not taken a formal position on the 
NEA's anti-obscenity pledge. 
</P>
<P>
DiChiera said through a spokeswoman that he would comment on the grant today, 
after studying the language of the acceptance form. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, however, DiChiera had said: "My feeling is that this grant, 
given to us under the endowment guidelines (of) the past years, is one we 
should accept, but at the same time we should do everything possible to make 
sure that in the future there is not any restrictive language tied to endowment 
support." 
</P>
<P>
Congress is considering reauthorizing the NEA for five years. Some 
congressional representatives have proposed bills with language restricting the 
content of works that would be eligible for NEA grants; others, including 
Orange County's Dana Rohrabacher, have proposed eliminating all federal money 
for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second NEA grant awarded to the Costa Mesa-based company. In 1989, 
Opera Pacific received a $15,000 grant to support hiring 
artistic,administrative and production personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The new grant will be used to hire a music director for community outreach 
programs, underwrite school performances and increase wages for apprentice 
artists.

First, it's the aimless wandering around the house, followed quickly by the 
crash of plates and the shriek of a beleaguered cat. Then, there it is, the 
sound that strikes panic into a busy parent's heart. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Mom, I'm b-o-o-o-r-e-d!"

A Los Angeles police officer today testified that "Cheers" star Kelsey Grammer 
confessed to dropping a small packet of cocaine in his patrol car after the 
actor was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"That cocaine was in my pocket. 
</P>
<P>
I felt stupid. I should have just told you I had it," Officer Michael Akana 
quoted Grammer as saying. "You deserve better than that. I would like to 
apologize to you," the star allegedly added. 
</P>
<P>
Akana was the sole witness during a preliminary hearing in Van Nuys Municipal 
Court on the cocaine possession charge stemming from Grammer's 1988 arrest in 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Aviva K. Bobb said the evidence was sufficient to hold Grammer for trial 
and scheduled a Van Nuys Superior Court arraignment for June 13. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a blue jail uniform and sporting a stubbly beard, Grammer looked 
cheerful as he came into court. He is serving a 30-day sentence for a probation 
violation stemming from an unrelated drunk driving conviction.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in a bid to expand Soviet contacts with 
industrialized countries, will meet in San Francisco after the Washington 
summit with South Korean President Roh Tae Woo, U.S. officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The two countries have no formal diplomatic relations, and the Soviets maintain 
strong ties with North Korea, which conducted a brief and now-suspended 
dialogue with the pro-U.S. government in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev is struggling to get a grip on the Soviet economy. As he left Moscow 
for talks beginning on Thursday with President Bush, the Soviet capital and 
other cities were experiencing panic buying in anticipation of broad price 
hikes pegged to adoption of a market system.

A Colombian-born woman was killed Tuesday night in a violent struggle with a 
man who fled from her El Toro apartment moments before her son and daughter 
returned from renting a video, police said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Ana Castellanos, 50, was discovered at 8:50 p.m. on Tuesday by her 
32-year-old son, who noticed the front door to the upstairs apartment on 
Farthing Street had been left ajar, sheriff's spokesman Lt. Richard Olson said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials disclosed few other details about Castellanos' death, which 
occurred in the Villa Viejo apartment complex near El Toro and Jeronimo roads. 
</P>
<P>
But witnesses said that Castellanos, who lived in the apartment with at least 
one other family, was overheard struggling with someone around the time of her 
death. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor, George Schwable, said he and his wife, Ruthie, were watching 
television when they heard loud noises upstairs. "It sounded like three body 
slams right on the floor," Schwable said. "Boom. Boom. Boom. Like that." 
</P>
<P>
"There was no arguments, no verbalizing," Ruthie Schwable added. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said that there were no signs of a struggle and that investigators have 
not identified any suspects. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of death was unknown, Olson said, adding that the coroner had 
scheduled an autopsy for this afternoon. He said that "there was trauma to the 
(woman's) body," but would not elaborate, pending an investigation by the 
sheriff's homicide division.

<P>
A powerful earthquake struck Romania today, killing at least eight people, 
injuring 260 and heavily damaging buildings in Bucharest and other cities 
across much of the country, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The temblor, with a magnitude of at least 6.5, tore chunks from buildings in 
the capital and sent guests fleeing in terror from a downtown Bucharest luxury 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The temblor was felt in the Soviet Union, Hungary, Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria, 
but of those only the Soviet Union reported casualties. 
</P>
<P>
Six people were reported injured and buildings were damaged in the Soviet 
republic of Moldavia near the Romanian border. A Soviet lawmaker said initial 
reports from the region indicated there could be an unspecified number of 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
In Romania, some people were killed or injured by large chunks of concrete and 
plaster that fell from buildings onto sidewalks and streets. Several people in 
Bucharest were hurt when they jumped from windows or balconies. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of frightened residents in the capital city of 2.2 million people 
fled into streets as buildings swayed and cracked. 
</P>
<P>
Romania's General Inspectorate of Police said two people died in Bucharest, two 
in the Danube River port of Braila, and one each in the cities of Buzau and 
Brasov, and one each in Ialomita and Prahova counties, north of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
One of the two people killed in Bucharest, shop assistant Petruta Lungu, died 
when she was hit by a collapsing balcony as she ran outside after the quake 
struck, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The inspectorate reported 260 people injured, 45 critically. It said 35 of the 
critically injured were in Bucharest, where 138 people were hurt. 
</P>
<P>
In Calarasi County in southern Romania, the ceiling of a major electrical steel 
plant crashed to the floor, the state news agency Rompres reported. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake struck at 1:40 p.m. (3:40 a.m. PDT) and rumbled across the 
Carpathian Mountains, which run through eastern Romania, the western border of 
the Soviet Union and southwest Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Rompres said the quake lasted several minutes and was followed by aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
In Bulgaria, the state BTA news agency said the temblor was felt nationwide but 
there was minor damage only in Silistra, a town on the border with Romania. A 
nuclear power plant in Kozlodoui on the Danube river was closed. 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Union, the quake knocked out telephone lines and shook buildings 
in at least three of the country's 15 republics: Russia, the Ukraine and 
Moldavia. 
</P>
<P>
In Ottawa, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said when asked about the 
earthquake: "Everything is OK. There was no devastation, no destruction." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev was in Canada en route to Washington for a summit with President Bush 
and there were no indications he would change his plans because of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 7, 1988, Gorbachev was in New York to deliver a speech at the United 
Nations when a killer earthquake measuring a magnitude of 6.9 struck the Soviet 
republic of Armenia killing more than 20,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
The following day, Gorbachev cut short his U.S. visit to return to Moscow.

The president of the Gabonese National Assembly was kidnaped while taking a 
stroll around his neighborhood, his family said today. 
</P>
<P>
The kidnaping Tuesday evening of Augustin Boumah, 63, a leading member of the 
ruling Gabonese Democratic Party, came as the army consolidated its control of 
the petroleum center of Port Gentil after a week of anti-government riots and 
fighting in which two people were killed and 14 others seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
Boumah's family said he had gone for a walk in his Libreville neighborhood when 
an unspecified number of armed men took him prisoner. No one has claimed 
responsibility for the kidnaping and the government has made no comment on the 
disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader Joseph Redjambe's death in a Libreville hotel room last week 
sparked riots across the Central African country and nearly halted oil 
production. Redjambe was found with syringe marks on his abdomen and officials 
said the Ivory Coast woman he met there has disappeared.

A California-based evangelist may be the next owner of the defunct PTL 
ministry's assets, including its satellite TV network and the Heritage USA 
Christian retreat, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer quoted unidentified sources as saying Morris 
Cerullo, 58, an Assemblies of God pastor who heads Worldwide Evangelism Inc. 
based in San Diego, has offered $52 million for PTL's remaining assets. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, PTL bankruptcy trustee Dennis Shedd signed a contract to 
sell PTL's television network to evangelist Oral Roberts for $6 million unless 
someone else agreed to buy all the assets as a package deal.

Norway's King Olav V, at 87 Europe's oldest reigning monarch, has been 
hospitalized in Oslo with inflammation of the heart but is likely to leave in a 
few days, spokesmen said today. 
</P>
<P>
"The king is in no danger," his secretary, Magne Hagen, said. 
</P>
<P>
"He will probably be out in a few days." 
</P>
<P>
King Olav was hospitalized Tuesday night for observation of a slight 
inflammation of the lining around the heart. 
</P>
<P>
He has had a string of official engagements in recent days and attended a 
commemoration in northern Norway on Monday of the 50th anniversary of the first 
Allied victory of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
A great-grandson of Britain's Queen Victoria, King Olav ascended the throne in 
1957. For many Norwegians, he is a symbol of resistance to the Nazi occupation 
of Norway during World War II. As crown prince, he fled to Britain in 1940.

British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said today it is wrong for Soviet Jews 
to settle on Israeli-occupied Arab land. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking shortly before leaving London on an official visit to Jordan and Saudi 
Arabia, Hurd said: "We have worked for a long time to help the Jews leave the 
Soviet Union. They've been suffering a great injustice. 
</P>
<P>
"But what we say to them and to the Israelis is, 'Don't correct one injustice 
by creating another.' It isn't right. It's not just, that Jews should go from 
the Soviet Union and settle in the occupied territories."

Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s board of directors today elected Paul Lego 
chairman and chief executive officer effective July 1 to replace retiring 
executive John Marous. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was expected since the company's board announced in 1987 its plans 
to replace Marous with Lego, who has been the corporation's president and chief 
operating officer the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
Marous, 65, will retire at the end of June after serving as CEO since 1987. He 
joined Westinghouse in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
Lego, 60, will become the company's 13th chief executive since the founding of 
the company 104 years ago by George Westinghouse.

TOP ECONOMIC INDEX DOWN 0.2% IN APRIL; 
</P>
<P>
FORECAST: SECOND LOSS IN FOUR MONTHS AS LEADING ECONOMIC INDICATORS POINT TO 
SLUGGISHNESS.

<TEXT>
<P>
The government's main economic forecasting gauge slipped 0.2% in April, its 
second loss in four months and another indication of the nation's sluggish 
economy, the Commerce Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
The index of leading economic indicators, designed to forecast economic 
activity six to nine months in advance, had risen 1% in March to regain 
February's 1% loss. The index was unchanged in January. 
</P>
<P>
A slight increase in the average workweek caused the department to revise the 
March figure up from 0.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts had said in advance of the report that the economy started the second 
quarter at the same weak pace that it ran in the first quarter and would 
improve only slightly in the second half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The economy grew at a 1.3% annual rate in the first quarter and many economists 
expect it to advance only 2% for the entire year, down from 3% last year and 
4.4% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration and congressional budget negotiators had their eyes on the 
report since continued growth would be required for any reduction in the 
federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
A recession would mean a loss of jobs and lower personal incomes, diminished 
corporate profits and thus a drop in tax revenues. At the same time, the 
government would be called on to spend more on benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts had expected a slight dip in today's leading indicators report, in 
part because of a continuing decline in the number of building permits in 
April. Permits have fallen each month since January, when builders sought to 
take advantage of record warm weather and to beat a deadline for meeting 
expensive new building standards. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts foresee no immediate improvement in the construction industry in 
view of high interest rates and tighter restrictions on credit. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to building permits, five more of the 11 forward-looking statistics 
were negative. 
</P>
<P>
They included a drop in new plant and equipment orders, a decline in the 
average workweek, a decrease in orders for consumer goods, a drop in 
manufacturers' unfilled orders and an increase in weekly unemployment claims. 
Four of the components were positive: an increase in the price of raw 
materials, an index measuring consumer confidence, slower business delivery 
times and an increase in the money supply. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Economists Bruce Steinberg and Laurie Allen contended in advance of today's 
report that "the latest batch of indicators provide further evidence of a 
lackluster economy." 
</P>
<P>
Writing in Merrill Lynch Capital Markets' "Weekly Economic &amp; Financial 
Commentary," they pointed to reports last week showing continued sluggishness 
in the automobile industry and flat orders since the first of the year for 
durable goods -- usually expensive products expected to last at least three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Like other indicators released during the past month, the latest set of data 
probably understate economic momentum," they added. "But they amply illustrate 
that the economy is going nowhere fast."

Japan's automobile exports posted the largest decline in 15 years in April, 
dropping 18% to 430,216 units compared with the year-earlier period, the Japan 
Automobile Industry said today. 
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest drop since March, 1975, when Japan's auto exports fell 
21.4%. 
</P>
<P>
The association said the decline was due to a large drop in exports to the 
United States, the largest automobile market for Japan. Export to the United 
States in April fell 38.2% from a year ago to 136,231 units, the association 
indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Export of passenger cars declined 15.8% to 321,917 units while truck exports 
fell 24.9% to 104,968 units.

Sales of new single-family homes dropped 1.6% in April for the fifth straight 
monthly decline while prices shattered all previous records, a government 
report said today. 
</P>
<P>
Private economists had expected a somewhat better sales showing. 
</P>
<P>
But in the hard-hit Northeast, sales jumped by 18% in April, while dropping by 
2.1% in the Midwest, 6% in the South and 6.4% in the West, the Commerce 
Department report said. 
</P>
<P>
The median price for a new home rocketed to $135,900 in April, after dipping to 
$119,400 in March, and April's average price rose to $160,200, after falling to 
$144,100 in March, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
A Commerce Department spokesman said the April prices were the highest on 
record, but the report did not indicate why there was such a huge increase in 
new home costs during the month. 
</P>
<P>
But the level of new home sales -- 546,000 at an annual rate -- was the lowest 
since 521,000 in December, 1982, the spokesman said.

<P>
Call her 1990's Tracy Chapman . . . this decade's Chrissie Hynde . . . or even 
a new generation's Patti Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Too much praise for a 23-year-old Irish singer-songwriter with just two albums 
to her credit? 
</P>
<P>
Not if you've heard Sinead O'Connor's seductively tender version of Prince's 
"Nothing Compares 2 U" or her hauntingly personal "I Do Not Want What I Haven't 
Got" album -- or if you saw her concert Tuesday at San Diego State University's 
Open Air Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
In the unending parade of pop faces and styles, O'Connor offers traces on 
record and on stage of being a trailblazer -- someone like Chapman, Hynde and 
Smith -- who not only entertains and inspires but also lifts our expectations 
of pop music. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's songs of personal exorcism and spiritual transformation are so 
intimate and unguarded that you feel at times you're eavesdropping in a 
confessional -- or overhearing a stormy scene in a bedroom, or in one song 
witnessing the final, bitter goodbys of a couple in an attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor -- who continues her U.S. tour with sold-out shows Thursday and Friday 
at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles -- writes about betrayal and misjudgments 
with anger and fury but she emerges from it all with a sense of optimism and 
faith. 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with the introspective, philosophical nature of her music, this 
head-spinning success could tempt O'Connor into presenting herself as some sort 
of precious angel -- an image she called to mind (no doubt inadvertently) when 
she walked on stage at one stop on her recent European tour in a hooded robe. 
</P>
<P>
By looking like a member of some exotic monastic order, O'Connor focused 
attention during that concert on the spiritual undercurrents in the album. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, however, O'Connor wore a leather jacket, jeans and cowboy boots, 
emphasizing the frisky, down-to-earth side of her personality and music. 
</P>
<P>
When O'Connor, an outspoken fan of rap music, took off the jacket, the 
lettering on her T-shirt spotlighted the playfulness even more. In a tip of the 
hat to the controversial Los Angeles rap group N.W.A, the front of the shirt 
read "P.W.A." -- for, as the lettering on the back explained, "Paddies With 
Attitude." 
</P>
<P>
As the concert proceeded, O'Connor moved from the cathedral-like tone of the 
opening number through the rock 'n' roll sass of "The Emperor's New Clothes," a 
tale of confrontation, to the sensual heat of "I Want Your (Hands On Me)." 
</P>
<P>
Her greatest talent at this early point in her career is her singing, which 
moves between a whisper and a scream with the suddenness and authority of a 
stunt-car driver swerving to avoid an accident. 
</P>
<P>
But her most prized attribute may be her ability to infuse music with the most 
profoundly personal feelings, yet leave enough room for the audience to find 
their own emotional connection. 
</P>
<P>
A full review runs in Thursday's Calendar section.

Prosecutors asked today for dismissal of drug possession, explosives and sexual 
assault charges against Hunter Thompson, saying their case against the "gonzo" 
journalist was not strong enough. 
</P>
<P>
The dismissal motions, to be heard Thursday in Pitkin County District Court, 
said potential witnesses had not cooperated with district attorney's office 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
A statement by the district attorney's office also said a preliminary hearing 
May 22 resulted in discrepancies between sworn testimony and previous 
statements to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said in an interview that the decision was "a huge victory for all of 
us" and there would be a "celebratory orgy" tonight at his favorite hangout, 
the Woody Creek Tavern in Aspen. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, 53, last week was ordered to stand trial June 25 on four felony and 
three misdemeanor charges after the preliminary hearing before Judge Charles 
Buss, who threw out a felony charge of using cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The charges stemmed from a visit to Thompson's home in Woody Creek last 
February by Gale Palmer-Slater of Port Huron, Mich., an entrepreneur and 
ex-pornographic film actress and producer. She claimed that Thompson grabbed 
her breast and threw a drink at her and that she saw him sniff cocaine during 
her hours-long visit to his home.

Officials of the Great Lumberton Music Festival in Michigan are going to court

<P>
The festival's promoters say Sinbad signed up to appear at the June 30 show but 
then backed out when singer Dionne Warwick asked him to be on her HBO cable 
network special. The suit also names Warwick and Triad Artists, the agency that 
represents both her and Sinbad. Country music legend Johnny Cash twice left the 
Lumbertown festival without its headliner by backing out after being announced 
as the top act, festival officials said.

Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) has clarified his stance on homosexuals, saying he 
doesn't hate them. "I was taught from the time I was a little boy to hate the 
sin and love the sinner," Helms told The Charlotte Observer.

<P>
"But the way these people conduct themselves makes the second half of that

because most AIDS victims are drug addicts or homosexuals and he doesn't want 
Congress to subsidize either group. "You're talking about what is decent and 
moral behavior," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"And it (homosexuality) is not decent and moral and we are taught biblically 
what it is -- it's an abomination." Helms even objects to the use of the word 
"gay" to describe homosexuals. "I resent the corruption of a very fine word," 
he said.

Millicent Miller, who worked as Vivien Leigh's stand-in during filming of "Gone 
With the Wind," has died. She was 81. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Miller died Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of death wasn't given. 
</P>
<P>
She lived most of her life in Stillwater, except for nine years she spent in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
In California, she joined the Screen Actors Guild and was asked to interview 
for the job as Miss Leigh's stand-in for "Gone With the Wind." She was hired 
from a group of more than 300 applicants. 
</P>
<P>
She appeared in the movie as Scarlett O'Hara hiding under a bridge while a 
wagon passes overhead. And it was her hand that pulled a turnip from the ground 
after the ruination of Scarlett's plantation Tara, and her hand that drew a 
revolver from a drawer before Scarlett shoots a Union soldier. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Miller is survived by her husband, Jimmy (Pete) Miller, a daughter and 
granddaughter.

A court battle between comedian Pat Paulsen and his former wife is no joke, 
with Paulsen claiming she defrauded him of $200,000 and Linda Chaney-Paulsen 
accusing him of racketeering, libel and slander. 
</P>
<P>
Paulsen testified Tuesday in Jefferson County Court that he set Chaney-Paulsen 
up in the booking business and that she repaid him by diverting money from 
business accounts of Pat Paulsen Enterprises Inc. in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
She also hid business records from him, leaked harmful stories about him to the 
National Enquirer and faked illnesses to get his sympathy, Paulsen alleges in 
his lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Among other charges, Chaney-Paulsen claims in a countersuit that the comedian 
married her, then filed for divorce simply to take over the business that was 
in her name. She also claims that Paulsen's income rose dramatically while she 
arranged his bookings.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: EYEDROPS FOR GLAUCOMA LINKED TO THINNING OF HAIR

Question: This may sound ludicrous but I wonder if the eyedrops I use for 
glaucoma could make my hair fall out. 
</P>
<P>
Even after my hair started to turn gray it was thick and beautiful. Now I am 
getting worried as it continues to get thinner. I first noticed it several 
months after starting on glaucoma medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: At first we doubted that glaucoma eye medicine could cause hair loss 
but after searching the medical literature we discovered that beta blocker 
drops may be associated with hair thinning. Apparently, enough medicine is 
absorbed into the bloodstream to produce side effects similar to those seen 
with oral beta blockers used for heart disease or high blood pressure. 
Depression, sexual side effects and fatigue may also occur from such eyedrops. 
</P>
<P>
You didn't mention which drug your doctor prescribed but medications such as 
Betagan Liquifilm (levobunolol), Betoptic (betaxolol), and Timoptic (timolol) 
have been reported to affect hair on scalp, eyebrows and eyelashes. 
</P>
<P>
Your ophthalmologist may be able to teach you how to apply the drops so that 
absorption is minimized or he may be able to determine if a different kind of 
medicine may be appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm under a lot of stress right now. My teen-age daughter has been acting 
up, and my husband and I are fighting about how to handle her. It feels like my 
nerves are all on edge, and I'm having trouble sleeping. My sister says I 
should get a prescription for Valium, as it helped her through a divorce two 
years ago. I hate to take drugs, though. I have read that valerian root is a 
natural alternative. Is it safe? 
</P>
<P>
A: Valerian is an herbal remedy that has been used as a sedative for hundreds 
of years. Scientific tests have shown that people taking valerian root extract 
get to sleep more quickly. Our sources indicate that this herbal remedy is 
relatively safe. No addiction has been reported. It should not be combined with 
alcohol or other drugs.

CHANG AND AGASSI RESTORE ORDER A DAY AFTER TOP SEEDS HIT THE ROCKS

<P>
Michael Chang survived a tough assault on his French Open title today after 
Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi stopped the purge of the top seeds. 
</P>
<P>
Chang wore down 6-foot-5 Marc Rosset of Switzerland, 7-5, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, to 
reach the third round of a tournament still shuddering from the biggest 
twin-killing in tennis history. Things steadied, however, as all seeds in 
action won. 
</P>
<P>
A day after No. 1 seed Stefan Edberg and No. 2 seed Boris Becker were beaten, 
Agassi, the highest-seeded man still playing, overcame a sluggish start to win 
in straight sets and Graf, the women's top seed, breezed despite sinus 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-seeded Gabriela Sabatini also won, although she blew two match points in 
the second set before advancing to the third round. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, who became the youngest men's winner of the clay-court Grand Slam event 
last year, had to struggle at first with Rosset, 19, who has a strong 
all-around game, including a mighty forehand. 
</P>
<P>
After blowing two break points in the ninth game of the opening set, Rosset 
looked strong in winning the second, relying on pounding ground strokes and 
booming serves to keep Chang back. But in the third set he appeared to tire, 
changing tactics to lobs and drop shots, and Chang raced him around the court 
until he was ready to drop. 
</P>
<P>
The match turned in the first game of the third set. Rosset had double-break 
point but Chang, seeded 11th, held for a 1-0 lead. After Rosset broke for 4-3, 
Chang won the last three games of the set, then broke in the fourth and eighth 
games of the fourth set and served out the match. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi, seeded third, took his pink-and-black tennis outfit and screaming shots 
to center court, where he beat Canadian qualifier Todd Woodbridge, 7-5, 6-1, 
6-3. 
</P>
<P>
The American struggled early, losing a 4-0 first-set lead and holding off five 
set points. He turned it around just as quickly, allowing Woodbridge just four 
games the rest of the way, and said that the fate that befell Edberg and Becker 
helped him dig in. 
</P>
<P>
"I went out today with the feeling, 'The first two seeds got beat.' Boris and 
Stefan getting beat helped me in that respect. You can't take anything for 
granted," Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
There was none of the surliness that marked Agassi's first-round victory. In 
fact, he was cheered wildly by thousands of children at the tournament on a 
school holiday, and did some showboating at the end, hitting the ball into the 
stands after match point and jumping over the net. 
</P>
<P>
Graf beat Jennifer Santrock, 6-1, 6-2, and said afterward that she was troubled 
by sinus and ear problems that may be the result of an allergy to "something in 
Paris -- the clay, the air or something." She has had similar medical problems 
at past French Opens. 
</P>
<P>
"I was wondering why I was always getting it here," Graf said. "The doctor says 
I will be all right in two, three days." 
</P>
<P>
Graf said she did "not feel good at all." But no one would have guessed it by 
the way she played. 
</P>
<P>
The world's top women's player, out to regain the French Open title, breezed 
through the first set and broke in the fifth game of the second set, wrapping 
up the victory in just 51 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Also among the winners on the third day were eighth-seeded Andrei Chesnokov of 
the Soviet Union, who beat Jean-Philippe Fleurian of France, 7-6, 6-2, 6-0; 
13th-seeded Jim Courier of the United States, who beat Milan Sjreber of 
Czechoslovakia, 7-6, 6-1, 2-6, 6-2; 15th-seeded Guillermo Perez-Roldan, who 
beat Andrei Cherkasov of the Soviet Union, 7-5, 6-4, 6-3; and 1988 runner-up 
Henri Leconte, a 6-4, 6-2, 6-1 winner over Bruno Oresar of Yugoslavia.

SUPERSTITION? IT'S ALL A PART OF THE BALL GAME;

The Baltimore Orioles wear black stirrups instead of orange . . . and win a 
game. Slugger Mickey Tettleton puts on a Dick Tracy T-shirt . . . and breaks 
out of a slump. Relief pitchers pose like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle figures, 
hop over white foul lines or sing on the mound . . . and save games. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidence? You decide. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball players have long been a superstitious lot. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone believes in their own way," Tettleton says with a smile that 
barely cracks a jaw as square as Dick Tracy's own. 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton gave an inadvertent boost to the big upcoming flick by letting on 
that he was wearing a Dick Tracy T-shirt under his uniform when he recently 
emerged from a frustrating slump at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"I got it in the mail, I don't even know where it came from," he demurs. 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton probably isn't the most superstitious Oriole -- despite his current 
streak, he hasn't even decided whether to keep wearing the T-shirt. But he's 
the most highly publicized one when the subject comes up. During a hot streak 
last year, for example, it was Froot Loops: His wife revealed that the cereal 
was the breakfast of this particular champion, and a legend was born. 
</P>
<P>
Athletes, and baseball players in particular, can be more prone to 
superstitions than the rest of us, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"There is such an element of chance in baseball, it makes it vulnerable to 
magical thinking," says Jim McGee, the Orioles' former team psychologist. "And 
there may be the sense that baseball, compared to other sports, is 
extraordinarily traditional. They still do things in 1990 that they did in 
1890." 
</P>
<P>
And who's to argue with someone like Joe Orsulak? His team-leading batting 
average -- for the third straight year -- lends credibility to his particular 
superstition. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like pitchers touching my bat. It's bad luck," the outfielder says. "I 
won't use it if a pitcher's touched it." 
</P>
<P>
Orsulak has also used a sort of personal voodoo to psyche out a pitcher who has 
caused him difficulty in the past: He wore a T-shirt with the pitcher's name 
and face on it the next time he had to face him. 
</P>
<P>
"I got hits off him," he reports. 
</P>
<P>
But certainly the most superstitious player award on the team goes to Brian 
Holton. Hey kids, you, too, can be a major league relief pitcher! Clip and 
save: 
</P>
<P>
"I get dressed the same way every day. Then I button just three buttons of my 
warm-up jacket. I go and get a towel and wrap it around my neck, and the tag 
always has to be on the right side," Holton says. "I put two cans of Copenhagen 
(smokeless tobacco product) in my pocket, one from spring training and a new 
one. In my left pocket I carry a lasso. . . . I found a piece of rope in San 
Diego once (in 1988) and made a lasso out of it and we went on a winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
"I always sit in the same seat in the bullpen and in the dugout," he continues. 
"I come up on the mound from the first base side. I wipe the (pitching) rubber 
four times with each leg and spin around clockwise. I catch the ball with one 
foot on the dirt and one foot on the grass. I never change catchers. If he's 
not ready (after batting in the last inning), I wait for him, I don't throw to 
anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"I always sing on the mound to myself, whatever they're playing," Holton adds. 
"If they're not playing anything, I'll sing, 'You take the high road, I'll take 
the low road.' " 
</P>
<P>
Relief pitchers, says McGee, who was team psychologist from 1980 to 1986, may 
need such rituals more than other players because of the unique nature of their 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
"Their tension level is always high, they can't tell when they're going in," he 
says. "If they don't perform their rituals, they feel anxious."

FBI RACEHORSE IN TRACK PROBE IS IDENTIFIED

<P>
The Boston Herald today identified the "undercover horse" used in an FBI sting 
operation as Zachregard, a 5-year-old mare that is still running at Finger 
Lakes Race Track. 
</P>
<P>
The horse, whose success surprised federal agents, is entered in the ninth 
race, a $3,000 claimer, this afternoon, according to track spokesman John 
Kolomic 
</P>
<P>
Dale Anderson, senior resident agent at the FBI's Rochester bureau, said he was 
"unable to make any comment one way or another" on the report because "there is 
an ongoing investigation." 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents looking into race-fixing at Finger Lakes said they chose the 
thoroughbred for their undercover operation because of its unimpressive record. 
</P>
<P>
But the horse, which officials had hoped would draw out would-be race fixers, 
gave agents more than they expected and proved too good to attract the interest 
of the investigation's targets. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought he was just an aging old race horse and actually it turned out that 
it was pretty good," said G. Robert Langford, special agent in charge of the 
FBI's Buffalo office. 
</P>
<P>
Langford on Tuesday provided some details into a 1989 undercover operation at a 
track in Canandaigua, 80 miles east of Buffalo, that led to race-fixing charges 
against a jockey, two trainers and the former wife of one of the trainers. 
</P>
<P>
Langford characterized the investigation as the first successful use of a horse 
in an undercover race track operation by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
The horse surprised government officials by winning at least one race and 
finishing in the money in about half of the races it ran in, Langford said. 
</P>
<P>
"When we started winning, it kind of got us a little nervous," Langford said. 
</P>
<P>
The horse was selected for the sting because it appeared to be a mediocre horse 
that wasn't capable of dominating the competition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You need an average horse that doesn't stand out," he said. If a horse that 
has been successful suddenly starts losing, "it rings a lot of bells" with 
track observers looking for the fix. 
</P>
<P>
"When a horse wins all the time, not many people want to try to fix the race 
with it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The horse performed so well it didn't draw out would-be race fixers, Langford 
said. The case against the four suspects instead was developed by a combination 
of observations of the Sept. 26, 1989, race in question and by conversations 
overheard by the agent-trainer, he said.

A federal court in Tulsa, Okla., sentenced a reputed high-ranking member of the 
Medellin drug cartel to 30 years in prison and fined him $5 million. Jose 
Abello Silva was convicted May 19 of conspiracy to import cocaine and marijuana 
into the United States and to possess drugs with the intent to distribute. 
Abello was extradited to the United States from Colombia last fall. U.S. 
District Judge Thomas Brett said the extradition treaty provided a maximum 
sentence of 30 years.

ROLF ERICSON: A LEGEND WITH A FUTURE; 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ: THE TRUMPETER'S SPENT 47 YEARS ADAPTING HIS PLAYING TO DIFFERENT MASTERS. 
NOW HE'S PLAYING HIS OWN TUNE AT THE GRAND AVENUE BAR.

<P>
The Rolf Ericson story has the makings of a bulky book, if not a TV miniseries. 
A fluent and sensitive master of the trumpet and fluegelhorn, he has achieved a 
unique backlog of credits through a rare mix of talent and adaptability. 
</P>
<P>
Ericson has worked for Paul Anka, Charlie Barnet, Count Basie, Les Brown, Benny 
Carter, Jimmy Dorsey, Tommy Dorsey, Lulle Ellboj, Duke Ellington, Maynard 
Ferguson, Stan Getz, Dexter Gordon, Woody Herman, Harry James, Elvin Jones, 
Quincy Jones, Stan Kenton, Harold Land, Charlie Mingus, Art Mooney, Charlie 
Parker, Perez Prado, Charlie Spivak, Buddy Rich, Dick Stabile, Charlie Ventura 
and the World's Greatest Jazz Band. 
</P>
<P>
After 47 years of playing with such masters throughout Europe and the United 
States and a series of far-flung residencies (most recently a decade based in 
West Germany), the Swedish-born Ericson arrived with his wife in Los Angeles in 
February. He found a home in Beverly Hills and has begun to explore the local 
music scene, playing several stage gigs at the Grand Avenue Bar of the Biltmore 
(he will be there Tuesday with singer Ernie Andrews). 
</P>
<P>
"I've always liked California," he says. "This was where I worked when I came 
to America in 1947. It wasn't easy back then; I went first, with a friend who 
had signed my papers, to Palm Springs, but nothing was happening. I took a job 
as a dishwasher to make enough money to get to Los Angeles, and pretty soon I 
was working with Benny Goodman." 
</P>
<P>
Ericson had made as swift a rise to fame back home. Inspired by a Louis 
Armstrong concert he attended with a trumpet-playing uncle ("I knew right there 
and then that I wanted to be a trumpet player and nothing else," he says), he 
soon graduated from school bands to the country's top professional units, and 
by 1945, at 23, he won the annual Swedish all-star band polls. "I was at the 
peak of my career, but I decided I had to come to America." 
</P>
<P>
In California, where the jazz world was segregated in the 1940s (there were two 
separate musicians' unions), Ericson was attracted to the Central Avenue scene, 
where he met and played with Teddy Edwards, Wardell Gray and pianist Gerald 
Wiggins (whose trio backed him last week at the Biltmore). 
</P>
<P>
His first American tour of duty lasted three years. Over the next two decades 
he spent much of his time in the United States, but he made Sweden his home 
base from 1965-70. By that time American musicians touring Europe hired him 
constantly: a festival in Hilversum, a Stockholm date with Dizzy or an all-star 
session with Clark Terry or Art Farmer. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the bands he has worked with, Duke Ellington's made the most durable 
impression. He was the first European musician to become a regular member, 
first in the United States in 1963-64 and then on numerous overseas tours; he 
has rejoined several times since Mercer Ellington became the leader. 
</P>
<P>
"I was mystified at first. Duke had this huge library, with just fragments of 
paper; I couldn't find any music, and I'd ask the other trumpeters. I'd say to 
Ray Nance, 'What note should I play here?' and he'd say, 'I don't know -- play 
anything.' And I was caught in the middle of this friction between Cootie 
Williams and Cat Anderson. If Cat told me, 'Play a B Flat here,' Cootie would 
say, 'Don't listen to him, it's an E Flat.' 
</P>
<P>
"Duke would just laugh and say, 'Don't worry, Rolf; you'll get it.' Finally I 
wrote out my own parts and after a couple of weeks I had the whole thing down." 
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast, during a brief tour with Count Basie, Ericson found the 
music "all there on the paper, no problem -- but Duke was something truly 
special: the greatest music I ever played." 
</P>
<P>
The legendary Charlie Barnet, whose record of "Cherokee" vaulted him to 
swing-era fame, had "a fantastic band. I was in a trumpet section alongside Doc 
Severinsen, Maynard Ferguson and an incredible lead player, Ray Wetzel. Charlie 
was the easiest guy to work for. 
</P>
<P>
"One night we played a battle of the bands in Balboa, against Woody Herman and 
Stan Kenton. We came in raggedy, filthy from a long road trip. Woody and Stan 
had musicians who were all neat, sunburned, with their cameras and their 
girlfriends. We were tired and hungry, but when we started to play, man, we 
wasted everybody! We blew both those bands right into the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
Ericson eventually worked with both of those "wasted" bands: He was with Herman 
in 1950 and later joined Kenton. "Stan gave me a lot of solo space, and I was 
making $350 a week -- big money in the '50s." 
</P>
<P>
Like most of Benny Goodman's employees, Ericson found the King of Swing 
"strange." During one of his stints with Goodman, he says: "We were in 
Freedomland for 10 days. Benny had this excellent guitarist, Turk van Lake. 
Every time he tried to play, a solo or just rhythm, Benny would say, 'No 
guitar.' This cat just sat there all night long and it happened again and 
again. At the end of the 10 days he hadn't plucked a single note." 
</P>
<P>
Goodman was one of several leaders with whom Ericson had difficulty retaining 
his identity. "One day he rented a studio and asked me to come over and jam. He 
played a lot of old-fashioned tunes, and later told me, 'I thought you played 
more modern than that.' I said, 'Benny, I figured you wanted me to play in your 
bag. You called the tunes -- how do you expect me to do anything else?' 
</P>
<P>
"So I heard nothing more from him. Suddenly, a year later, he calls up and has 
me sign a contract to go to Europe. Later I found he had gotten about 20 other 
trumpeters to sign contracts -- but Benny himself hadn't signed any of them! 
No, I didn't get the job." 
</P>
<P>
Buddy Rich presented other problems. "A very weird person, dictatorial -- 
'Button your coat! Lose some pounds so you can fit into the uniform!' He 
ordered me to play like Sweets Edison and I told him, 'I love Sweets, but I'm 
Rolf Ericson. Either accept me or get Sweets.' Later, we became good friends." 
</P>
<P>
Another identity crisis: "I replaced Shorty Rogers in the Lighthouse All Stars 
at Hermosa Beach. Bad vibes! I tried to play like Shorty but it didn't fit my 
temperament, and it never jelled. But I did get to play with Miles Davis when 
he dropped in one night, and not long ago they put it out on an album." 
</P>
<P>
Ericson learned about American society when he toured the South in two 
interracial bands. "I was with Perez Prado, who was very dark. Somehow we got 
checked into a hotel in Montgomery, Ala., but suddenly the hotel manager said, 
'Get out! The Ku Klux Klan is coming -- they'll lynch me!' We jumped into the 
cars and split. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie Barnet took us all into a restaurant in the South. They served 
everyone but the three black guys in the band, so Charlie said, 'Let's go.' We 
left without paying; they sent for the police and we had State Troopers with 
guns chasing us, but they didn't catch us." 
</P>
<P>
A more pleasant experience was a session in Dusseldorf in which a series of 
poems written by Pope John Paul II as a young man were set to music, given 
English lyrics by Gene Lees and recorded with Sarah Vaughan as the principal 
singer and Lalo Schifrin conducting a large orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"Sarah hadn't studied the material very well, but in two days she had it down, 
and it was so unbelievably beautiful, every time I play it to this day I get 
tears in my eyes." 
</P>
<P>
Over a career that spans 47 years Ericson's experiences have not been uniformly 
rewarding. A low point was his year with Les Brown, playing the Bob Hope show: 
"A super-white band, stiff and cold -- it really didn't fit me." But, for every 
such blue note, there have been enough rewarding encounters to fill the life 
spans of a dozen typical jazzmen. 
</P>
<P>
Three months from now he will be back on the road again, touring Scandinavia 
for a few weeks, but California provides strong roots and longstanding 
friendships. 
</P>
<P>
"Between the studio jobs and all the bands and small jazz groups, I've done 
just about everything. I never had a manager, and I still don't have one. Maybe 
I should get one now." 
</P>
<P>
It seems unlikely. Ericson's reputation guarantees that the right gig will 
never be more than a phone call away.

As a secretary back in Detroit, Dee Dee McNeil didn't think she'd become a 
singer. A talent for writing poetry led to a job as a songwriter for Motown 
Records, where she penned tunes for Diana Ross and the Supremes ("Discover 
Me"), Gladys Knight and the Pips ("Somebody Stole the Sunshine") and the Four 
Tops ("What Is a Man"). She was on her way. 
</P>
<P>
But McNeil, who will appear Monday at the Cafe Lido in Newport Beach as part of 
the Benson &amp; Hedges Blues festival taking place next week at several 
Southland venues, didn't become a pop singer. She had grown up listening to 
Dinah Washington, Billie Holiday and Dakota Stanton, music that her parents 
played around the house, and had other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved jazz and blues," she said recently, "and the songs I was writing all 
used blues and jazz changes." With encouragement from Motown record producers, 
the secretary began to sing. 
</P>
<P>
McNeil moved to Los Angeles in 1970 "looking for a career break." She gained 
some visibility after joining the Watts Prophets, a vocal ensemble that did 
ethnic poetry and original music. Their album, "Rappin' Black in a White 
World," was her first recorded work. 
</P>
<P>
Now living in San Diego, the singer is in demand at Southern California clubs, 
having lately appeared at Monteleone's and the Biltmore Hotel's Grand Ave. Bar, 
both in Los Angeles, and at Elario's in La Jolla. She has also performed in 
Japan and New Zealand and appeared at the International Jazz Festival in Vienna 
in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, McNeil played at the Cafe Lido, where she'll continue each Monday 
through June. Backed by a satisfying trio of drummer Harold Mason, bassist 
Louie Spears and pianist Lanny Hartley, the singer showed an apparently 
boundless supply of enthusiasm for performing as well as for the material she 
sang. 
</P>
<P>
She said she likes to think of herself as a song stylist, and -- like Nancy 
Wilson, whose voice her voice sometimes resembles -- McNeil can pack a phrase 
with musical twists and turns without ever losing sight of the lyric's meaning. 
She gets warm and breathy in the lower registers, sweet and crystalline in the 
upper. Her scatting is quick, sharp and inventive. 
</P>
<P>
McNeil, who teaches classes in jazz appreciation through the city Cultural Arts 
Department in Los Angeles to students ranging from preschoolers to senior 
citizens, can also be instructional on the bandstand. She preceded her 
rendition of "Lover Man" by explaining that Billie Holiday's recording with 
"fiddles," as Holiday reportedly called them, was the first by a black female 
vocalist to use strings. In a couple of lines during the song, McNeil recalled 
not only Holiday's phrasing, but her tonal quality as well. 
</P>
<P>
McNeil, who also has a taste for Latin and Brazilian numbers, said she has a 
special fondness of the blues: "The blues developed from the slave songs, and 
that music was transformed into gospel and jazz. It's the roots of American 
music, and that's why I love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Dee McNeil appears with pianist Dwight Dickerson, bassist Louis Spears and 
drummer Harold Mason Monday at the Cafe Lido, 501 30th St., Newport Beach. 
Information: (714) 675-2968.

THE POLO PERSONA;

<P>
FASHION: FOR RICKY LAUREN, EPITOME OF THE RALPH LAUREN LOOK, NOW IS THE TIME TO 
PURSUE PERSONAL PROJECTS -- INCLUDING A NEW BOOK.

<TEXT>
<P>
To see Ricky Lauren is to understand what has been Ralph Lauren's most personal 
inspiration for his phenomenally successful, billion-dollar fashion empire. 
</P>
<P>
As Ralph Lauren's wife of 25 years enters the room in a pale blue cotton shirt, 
khaki jodhpurs, English riding boots and her blond-streaked hair flowing to her 
shoulders -- setting off her slightly tanned, flawless skin -- she is clearly 
the epitome of the Ralph Lauren woman featured in all those carefully styled 
Polo advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike the wives of many famous men, Ricky Lauren has tended to stay out of 
the limelight all these years, opting to raise their three children; manage 
their homes in New York, Jamaica and Colorado, and occasionally accompany her 
equally press-shy husband to a charity or fashion industry event. 
</P>
<P>
Of late, however, Lauren has come out of her beautifully appointed closet to 
launch a personal project: a book called "Safari," featuring her own 
photographs and text from a 1983 trip to Africa she made with four friends. The 
leather-and canvas-bound book with gilt-edged pages, with a press run of 1,000 
numbered copies, was published by Lauren herself, with the help of a Japanese 
bookmaker. It sells for $150 with proceeds going to the World Wildlife Fund. 
It's available at the Polo shop on Rodeo Drive. 
</P>
<P>
It is a creditable effort with easy, flowing text and interesting shots of the 
wildlife they encountered, the exotic terrain and the Masai women in all their 
beaded regalia. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to write and I like to take photos," explains Lauren, seated demurely 
on a couch in the offices of the mansion-like Polo store on Madison Avenue. 
"There are so many things I get to see because I'm lucky, I wanted to share it 
with others. I know I'm not a professional photographer or a writer, but I 
thought (I'd publish the book) in a way that had a charm to it. It would be fun 
to do something on my own." 
</P>
<P>
Born Ricky Low-Beer, she grew up in New York City and was an English major at 
Hunter College when she met her future husband at the eye doctor's office where 
she was working part time. She also taught fifth grade for a time in the Bronx. 
She studied photography after their marriage and says she writes regularly in a 
journal. 
</P>
<P>
"Ralph likes what I like," she says in her careful, self-effacing way, letting 
it be known she has his blessing on her book project. "Ralph is always 
supporting the things I do. It was nice of him to suggest it. It was very 
nice." 
</P>
<P>
Lauren makes it clear that she is as much a perfectionist as her notoriously 
hands-on designer husband: "I laid it all out -- how it should flow -- picked 
the lettering, the paper, the size each photo should be. Having been trained by 
Ralph, I didn't let anything slip through my fingers. He's into everything. I 
made all the decisions." 
</P>
<P>
She describes her personal safari (the timing of the book's publishing, she 
says, was not tied to the launching of Ralph Lauren's new Safari fragrance and 
home collection) as an experience both subtle and monumental: "I felt very 
trusting and comfortable -- no fear. There were times I wished I could walk 
away with the animals. I felt very much like I was communicating with nature. 
It was what I imagined it must have been like in Eden." 
</P>
<P>
When asked how she feels about being the persona behind the Polo Ralph Lauren 
woman, a sneeze from someone in the room suggests an answer. 
</P>
<P>
"Gesundheit!" Lauren says. "That means healthy, and that's how I feel about it. 
You have to take the opportunity. There's the 'What came first -- the chicken 
or the egg?' question. I'd been around awhile before the other was here. But 
sometimes I don't know if I'm the chicken or the egg." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she ever feels overwhelmed by her husband's fame and fortune, she 
quickly dispels that notion with a show of strength that isn't always evident. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I made a big name for myself," she counters, making a point of her 
role as a type of silent partner in her husband's success. "I feel pretty good 
about all that." 
</P>
<P>
The reason Ricky Lauren is suddenly emerging with projects that bear her name, 
she says, is timing. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot to do to get to this point," she says. "I am a wife and a 
mother. It's building a foundation in those areas and then you can devote 
yourself to other things. It falls into place. You know when it's time. I think 
what makes life difficult is when you're all over the place at once. Too much 
stimulation can be destructive. You have to know yourself and stay centered." 
</P>
<P>
Making their high-powered polo game of a marriage work has been about 
priorities, as well, says Lauren. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to do what you think is important and sometimes two people think the 
same things are important. You ride the waves -- both the crest and the trough. 
Just to exist is the thing. Marriage is not about the good parts or the bad 
parts. It's just participation."
