12 INDICTED IN INTERNATIONAL RING ACCUSED OF SMUGGLING EXOTIC BIRDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Twelve people -- including a Spring Valley man and an Escondido couple -- were 
indicted Wednesday, accused of participating in an international smuggling ring 
that sneaked $500,000 worth of exotic parrots, rare birds and other protected 
wildlife into the United States, federal authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The action followed a 20-month undercover "sting" by U. S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service agents posing as collectors of exotic birds, including some of the 
world's rarest. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation led Fish and Wildlife and U. S. Customs Service agents to the 
discovery of a major pipeline that smuggled birds native to Southeast Asia and 
Central and South America by funneling them through Singapore and Argentina to 
Mexico City, officials said. From there, they were moved to Tijuana and 
eventually to U. S. bird dealers, who would then sell them for up to $10,000 
each. 
</P>
<P>
The U. S. attorney's office in San Diego said the alleged ring members are 
charged with a host of federal criminal violations involving conspiracy, the 
trade of endangered species and quarantine and customs laws. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worldwide Network 
</P>
<P>
The 12 defendants were named in three separate indictments alleging, among 
other things, that bird dealers in Southern California would contact a network 
of bird dealers throughout the world and place orders for protected birds -- 
including black palm cockatoos, hyacinth macaws and military macaws -- that are 
so threatened with extinction that an international treaty with 97 nations 
prohibits all commercial trade in those species. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the threatened status of many species of exotic birds, the lure of 
quick and lucrative profits makes bird smuggling a thriving business," said 
Marvin L. Plenert, regional director of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service's 
regional office in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
"Although half of the birds in a given shipment may die en route, the profit on 
the surviving birds more than offsets this loss." 
</P>
<P>
Among those indicted are Michael Keith Daye and Jane Mary Daye, who operated 
the Exotic Feathers bird store in Long Beach. They were arrested Wednesday 
morning at their home in the 1800 block of Summit Hill Drive in Escondido, 
where they recently moved. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Daye was being held in lieu of $100,000 bail at the federal 
Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown San Diego and, if convicted, faces 
40 years in prison and a $2-million fine. His wife, who was released on a 
personal surety bond, faces 15 years in prison and a $750,000 fine if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Birds Seized 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, authorities also arrested Zygmunt Kariata at his home in 
the 800 block of Paraiso Avenue in Spring Valley, where investigators seized 98 
birds valued at about $250,000. Kariata was being held at the MCC on Wednesday 
in lieu of $50,000 bond and faces 25 years in prison and a $1.25-million fine 
if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U. S. Atty. Cynthia Lynne Millsaps said Kariata also had several 
hundred legal birds at his residence, where he apparently operated a bird 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Others named in the federal indictments were: 
</P>
<P>
* Honorio B. Oseguera, with addresses in San Ysidro and Tijuana, where a "safe 
house" for the birds was purportedly maintained until they were smuggled across 
the border. He was at large. 
</P>
<P>
* Carlos Mendoza of Hawthorne, outside Los Angeles, also listed as a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
* Hugh Thomas Wilson of Long Beach, who is in custody in northern California on 
unrelated state charges. 
</P>
<P>
* Francisco de Abiega and Rosa Lee Simon, both of Mexico City, both arrested 
Wednesday morning in Vista by undercover agents posing as exotic bird buyers. A 
detention hearing for each was scheduled for Friday before U. S. District Judge 
Lawrence Irving in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
* Eleen Koh of Singapore, who was arrested Wednesday morning in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
* Luis Ortiz of Buenos Aires, listed as a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
* Harold Clayton Yanik of Charlotte Courthouse, Va., for whom a summons was 
issued. 
</P>
<P>
* Tovar Antonio Alvarez, with addresses in Los Angeles and Tijuana, listed as a 
fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
Millsaps said Fish and Wildlife undercover agents, working on a tip about the 
smuggling ring, posed as collectors of exotic birds. "When you have birds going 
for $10,000 each, we're not talking about mom-and-pop bird collectors," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said foreign bird dealers would smuggle the birds into Singapore or 
Argentina, then, using false documents, ship them to De Abiega, a veterinarian 
who had an office at the Mexico City International Airport. He would then ship 
the birds to a safe house in Tijuana, authorities said. From there, the birds 
would be smuggled across the border.

AL MARTINEZ: LUCK BE A LADY TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's one of those nights in Hollywood when everyone seems to be out. Odd for a 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The sidewalks are full and the streets busy, but it isn't a noisy night. 
There's a muted quality to it, a kind of drum riff, as sweet as jazz played by 
moonlight, as smooth as honey in tea. 
</P>
<P>
Forget the kids with purple hair, the drag queens, hookers and others of a more 
mischievous nature. 
</P>
<P>
The moon sails high in a starry sky and we all stay mellow, sharing the 
sidewalks like Brits on a boardwalk, with a kind of gentility that Hollywood 
doesn't see much anymore. 
</P>
<P>
It's the drum riff that does it. You don't get crazy when steel brushes lure 
you to quiet meadows of the mind. 
</P>
<P>
I am cruising Vine, looking for a club called El Floridita because my friend, 
Nick Edenetti, is singing there. I've never heard of the place, but that isn't 
important. 
</P>
<P>
I had never heard of Burbank's China Trader either, where Nick's billing on the 
menu was only a little higher than the Sichuan pork, or Gio's, where the lights 
went out and Nick had to sing in total darkness, like a spook in the shadows. 
</P>
<P>
El Floridita is just another stop on a saloon singer's swing through nights 
that aren't always as mellow as this one. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, the place has style. Mirrored walls reflect back a hundred 
Nicks up there singing, arms outstretched, belting out "Come Rain or Come 
Shine" in replicated images that fade to infinity. 
</P>
<P>
The mirrors are like a throwback to another Hollywood era when flash and 
elegance still mattered, before teen-age movie stars began coming to 
restaurants in jeans torn out at the knees. 
</P>
<P>
El Floridita is a Cuban restaurant that seats maybe 200 and serves cooked 
bananas and black bean soup and, oh yes, "fried sord fish." I have the sord 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
There are maybe 20 people in the audience tonight and sometimes a blender 
sounds in the background because the bar is right on the edge of the big room, 
but Nick doesn't seem to mind. 
</P>
<P>
The mirrors trick the eye here, too, and from a certain angle it looks as 
though the place is packed. The hum of the blender melts into the music like it 
isn't there at all. Things work when you want them to. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a terrific place," Nick is saying, as though he is playing the Music 
Center. "Things are really looking good." 
</P>
<P>
Now is the best time in his life, Nick says, and I believe him. He's gained 
weight in the last couple of years, but his voice is strong and he's as 
optimistic as ever for a guy who's been singing in saloons for 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
He talks about appearances on television shows and says he's got more nightclub 
offers than he can handle. 
</P>
<P>
"Get this," he says, leaning over our table at El Floridita. He is wearing a 
silky brown suit and a white tuxedo shirt with ruffles down the front. A 
diamond pinkie ring flashes in the dim light. 
</P>
<P>
"This woman comes up to me after a show once and taps me on the shoulder and 
says, 'I definitely hear my father's voice in you.' You know who she is? Tina 
Sinatra!" 
</P>
<P>
Nick slumps back and shakes his head like he is remembering a miracle at 
Lourdes. Frank Sinatra's daughter. What a night. 
</P>
<P>
Manhattan-born and Brooklyn-raised, Edenetti taught himself to sing by 
listening to Sinatra records and occasionally does impressions of Old Blue 
Eyes. 
</P>
<P>
In a certain light, Nick looks like Frank, sitting on a bar stool with a coat 
over one shoulder and a tendril of cigarette smoke tracing lines of memory in 
the pale blue spots. 
</P>
<P>
He's played in more clubs across the country than he can remember, from 
gambling rooms to strip joints, and for a while bought air time for his own 
television show from 1 to 6 a.m. every Sunday on a one-horse Westside channel. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for a great room now," Nick says, reaching for a cigarette and 
then putting it back. He's trying to quit. "I want to retool the Sinatra thing, 
but it's got to be in the right place. I've got so many offers. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
When it's time to sing, Nick kicks in with "Luck Be a Lady Tonight," a hundred 
mirrored images of him belting it across an almost empty room, holding a mike 
with one hand, jabbing the air with the other. It's show time, folks. 
</P>
<P>
Later, back on the street, cruising up Vine to the Hollywood Freeway, I think 
about Nick and about all the guys who never stop trying. The song was written 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Luck if you've ever been a lady to begin with, luck be a lady tonight.... 
</P>
<P>
 The drum riff fades, the sidewalks empty and the night goes back to the 
dreamers.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANTONOVICH TO SEEK AUDIT OF AQMD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, citing a 184% increase in the 
Air Quality Management District's budget over the last five years, said 
Wednesday he will ask for an independent audit of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference where he was joined by members of the business community, 
Antonovich charged that the AQMD's proposed $80.2-million 1989-90 budget 
unfairly assesses businesses through across-the-board 19.5% increases in annual 
fees, permit application fees and emission fees. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich, a member of the AQMD's board of directors, complained that industry 
is responsible for 30% of the air pollution in the basin, compared to 70% for 
motor vehicles, but is being asked to finance 85% of AQMD's budget. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD spokesman Bill Kelly, while acknowledging that Antonovich's statistics 
were "essentially accurate," said industry is indirectly responsible for a 
greater share of pollution as a result of emissions from vehicles used by 
employees during their commute and on the job.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EXTRA $2 MILLION OKD FOR COURTS COMPUTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has approved a $2.1-million 
contract for additional design work on a computer system being developed for 
use in the county courts. 
</P>
<P>
The contract with Systemhouse Inc. was approved on a 3-1 vote, with Pete 
Schabarum dissenting. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum expressed concern with the escalating cost of the contract for the 
County Justice Information System, which was budgeted for $12 million in 1986 
and has since received a $864,000 "design enhancement" allocation. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Zolin, county clerk and executive officer for the Superior Court, said he 
could not estimate how much the system will cost, but he told Schabarum that it 
will pay for itself in "five to six years" by eliminating court personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who strongly supported the additional funds for the 
system, told Schabarum the extra costs were a result of new specifications 
requested by court officials. 
</P>
<P>
The new money will give the courts automated investigation statistics, pretrial 
information and probation and mental health reports.

43 ANIMALS IMPOUNDED FROM LEMON GROVE HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARICARMEN EROLES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerned about sanitary conditions, San Diego Humane Society on Wednesday 
impounded 13 cats, 19 kittens, 5 dogs and 6 birds taken from a Lemon Grove 
house. 
</P>
<P>
The animals were "living in their own excrement," said Larry Boersma, a 
spokesman for the society. Neighbors had complained about the smell, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the conditions, Boersma said, most of the animals were "not suffering 
too badly" and appeared to be in fair health. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Complaints 
</P>
<P>
There had been many complaints about the home, Boersma said, and the society 
had talked with the animals' owner, Phillis Delong, 43, before a search warrant 
was issued. Joe Burnett, who lives next door, in the 6000 block of San Miguel 
Avenue, said the smell was overpowering. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't have family get-togethers because of the smell," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the animals looked well-fed, but he felt that living "in that mess 
can't be good." Burnett, who said he had never been inside the house, said the 
dogs were always barking. He said he complained to Delong but that the problem 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
However, June Matyas, a neighbor across the street, said she had never noticed 
the smell or been bothered by the animals. 
</P>
<P>
Boersma said the Humane Society officer who conducted the search, J. P. Baker, 
reported "unbelievable, appalling filth" in the house and the body of a 
decaying cat lying in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'See It to Believe It' 
</P>
<P>
"You have to see it to believe it," Boersma said. "It (the smell) was gagging 
people. Animal excrement was everywhere, and there was a strong urine smell." 
</P>
<P>
The case will be presented to the San Diego County district attorney with a 
recommendation that Delong be charged with animal neglect, a misdemeanor, 
Boersma said. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to educate owners, and probably 95% of the cases are resolved by 
educating the owners about animals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In general, California law requires owners to provide food, water, veterinary 
care, proper shelter and sanitary conditions for animals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The owner was providing all of the requisites except sanitation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sanitation has to be provided," he said. "You don't ask your animal to live in 
its own excrement." 
</P>
<P>
The animals will be kept by the society until the matter is decided in court, 
which might take months.

NATIONAL UNIVERSITY NAMES NEW PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
National University trustees, eager to bolster the school's position in the 
academic community, have named a seasoned East Coast educator to take the reins 
of the 11-campus institution. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry C. Lee, former president of a prominent university for the deaf, was 
selected from among a field of more than 100 to lead National University. 
</P>
<P>
Lee succeeds the school's founder and first president, David Chigos, who 
resigned last year amid problems over accreditation at the 17-year-old 
university, which serves mostly working adults. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a rare combination of managerial skills and academic background which 
fits National's needs perfectly," said Donald L. Fagan, chairman of the 
trustees. "His experience in both business and higher education will be 
particularly valuable to the university as we move into the future." 
</P>
<P>
A one-time corporate executive with General Motors and other private firms, Lee 
is perhaps best known for his long tenure at Gallaudet University, a school for 
the deaf in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Critical Juncture 
</P>
<P>
He served at Gallaudet for nearly two decades, beginning as vice president for 
administration and business before moving up to the presidency in 1984. His 
resignation last year set in motion a series of events that prompted national 
interest and headlines. Hearing-impaired students protested when they learned 
that his successor, like Lee, was not deaf. 
</P>
<P>
Lee, 47, assumes National University's top spot at a critical juncture in the 
school's history, as it struggles with financial problems caused by rapid 
growth during the mid-1980s and a nagging reputation as an academic 
lightweight. 
</P>
<P>
In December, school leaders announced a major financial reorganization that 
included issuing bonds and selling the Vista campus, which was leased back as 
part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
The university was recently given a reprieve by the Western Assn. of Schools 
and Colleges, which put National on a yearlong probation and threatened to yank 
its academic accreditation, maintaining that the school's rapid growth was 
undermining the quality of its classes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping we can put some of this to rest," said Peter Casey, a university 
spokesman. "We feel it's pretty good news that National has been able to 
attract someone of the caliber of Jerry Lee."

A WORTHY TRANSPORTATION PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state of California can never build enough freeways to get 30 million 
Californians wherever they want to go at the beginning of the 21st Century. But 
with enough money, brains, technology, planning and creativity, the state can 
develop a modern transportation system that will keep the state's economic 
engine running strongly and maintain the basic life style that makes California 
the Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation of such a program is on the table in Sacramento, close to final 
agreement between Gov. George Deukmejian and state legislative leaders. They 
must settle the remaining loose ends soon and seal the deal. Then, they must 
work with the business community to persuade California voters that the 
$18.5-billion transportation finance plan is essential if the state is to 
control its own destiny. The option is increasing, paralyzing gridlock, leading 
to a certain undermining of the state's economy. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the governor and legislative leaders reached tentative 
agreement Tuesday on the program to be financed by a 9-cent-per-gallon increase 
in the gasoline tax over five years and significant increases in truck fees. 
The money would go toward a mix of new highway construction and maintenance, 
mass transit facilities, local roads, congestion relief, modern traffic 
management techniques and environmental enhancement projects like sound 
barriers and tree-planting. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, the plan also would include a growth-management segment 
patterned after one approved by voters in Contra Costa County last year. This 
would require local regions to develop plans for accommodating growth as a 
condition of receiving new state aid. Growth management is an essential element 
in the package since transportation routing has such a dramatic effect on 
growth, and unplanned development can quickly clog existing streets and roads. 
</P>
<P>
The next step is for negotiators to approve a modest liberalization of the Gann 
spending limits so that the new transportation money can be allocated. It also 
would give California a more realistic cap on overall spending. The Gann change 
would require a vote of the people either at a special election this fall or at 
the primary next June and would, in effect, serve as a referendum on the 
gasoline tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Both the governor, who previously opposed gas tax increases, and legislators 
deserve credit for developing the program, which incorporates most of the 
elements of a forward-looking plan sponsored by Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar), chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee. The energy of 
state Transportation Director Robert K. Best also was essential to the process. 
</P>
<P>
This transportation finance program is critical to California's future. It 
cannot be allowed to fail.

REAGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the current occupant of the White House scours the country for qualified 
Republicans who can stand FBI checks, his predecessor continues to make 
headlines. Ronald Reagan, never one to lie awake worrying about ethics, will 
receive $2 million for a speaking tour in Japan. We have become accustomed to 
seeing Japan Inc. buying up our stocks and real estate, so why not 
ex-Presidents? Japan became the world's leading lender during Reagan's term, 
while the U.S. became the leading debtor. Talk about a golden parachute! 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a movement is afoot to place the Gipper's likeness on Mount 
Rushmore. Never mind that this national monument might have been sold if Reagan 
and (former Interior Secretary James) Watt had their way; let's be big about 
this. Let them put up a cardboard cutout of the Great Communicator. A 
two-dimensional representation would be most fitting -- and it would be easy to 
remove once the voters realize how easily they were conned for eight years.

NICARAGUA AND THE CONTRAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As I read your editorial "Gorbachev's Gesture" (May 17) about Soviet leader 
Mikhail Gorbachev cutting off military aid to Nicaragua, my thoughts turned to 
a Witness for Peace letter I received recently. 
</P>
<P>
The letter states: "During the last year of 'non-lethal' aid, Witness for Peace 
documented 147 civilians killed, 150 civilians wounded and 281 civilians 
kidnaped by the Contras." 
</P>
<P>
So much for "humanitarian assistance." So much for "gentler and kinder." You 
have to wonder about a President who professes to hold the sanctity of life so 
dear as in the case of an unborn fetus, yet holds the lives of Nicaraguan 
civilians so cheaply.

THE SPEAKER BOWS OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Wright was tarnished goods when he walked to the well of the House of 
Representatives Wednesday to tell his side of the story, and he made it worse. 
The tight grin framing the clenched teeth didn't work. The defense was as 
flimsy and crude as he claims the case against him to be. It was a pathetic 
hour of self-destructive and hopeless rhetoric. But with all that, he could not 
blot out the poignancy of the final minute of his "allotted time for brief 
remarks," actually saying the words that meant resignation from the third 
highest office in the United States government. No matter how tawdry the months 
of revelation of his venal turn of mind in matters of personal finance, that 
took guts because the most believable part of his defense came when he said: "I 
love this institution." He made that ring true even though most of the hour was 
devoted to trying to portray the members of the institution as a lynch mob. 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday, Wright had no choice. Many Americans outside the Beltway that 
divides Washington from the rest of the nation are prepared to believe anything 
malicious about politicians, whether it is fact or fiction. That makes a nice 
match for people inside the Beltway, who are prepared 24 hours a day to say 
something malicious, and who themselves make no distinction between what is 
true and what is just vicious. 
</P>
<P>
The barrage of partisan attacks in Washington had already led to the 
resignation of Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Merced) as Democratic whip. Rep. William H. 
Gray III (D-Pa.), who wants to take Coelho's place, was in some unspecified 
trouble over staff matters. There was something malicious to say about nearly 
everybody else in town. It was time for a dramatic break in the pattern in the 
hope that Congress could get some work done again. 
</P>
<P>
Wright spoke at one point of the irony of his wife's once resigning from a 
House Committee staff to avoid criticism of their both being on the public 
payroll. A more interesting irony, on which he did not dwell, was that aside 
from the petty cash arrangements in which he, or his staff, dealt in on the 
side, he was an effective leader of the House. Congress passed a major highway 
and transportation bill over former President Reagan's veto under Wright, 
approved help for the homeless, improved the food stamp program and worked out 
a plan for catastrophic health care under Medicare. Of that part of his record, 
Wright can be proud. 
</P>
<P>
Expanding that record will be up to Rep. Tom Foley (D-Wash.), the odds-on 
favorite to become Speaker next week when Congress will vote on a successor to 
Wright, who no matter how successful on legislation leaves behind plenty of 
work to do. A new Clean Air Act must be put together, starting next week. The 
budget still must be dealt with in detail, with the balance still to be struck 
between defense and domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
Wright also was believable in another part of his farewell speech. The nation 
cannot afford to have its government paralyzed by the distractions of personal, 
partisan attacks, a pattern that Rep. Julian Dixon (D-Los Angeles), whose 
Ethics Committee investigated the charges against Wright, says is "getting out 
of hand." For Democrats, the most important things about Foley are that he is 
intelligent, articulate and, by all accounts, ethically clean as a whistle. 
That, too, would help get Congress' attention away from carving up personal 
reputations and back to making law.

EXXON SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I find it surprising that you would say, as you did in The Times' editorial 
("The Risks of Underregulation," May 6), that "Exxon seemed to treat the 
(Alaska oil spill) disaster as just one of those things," and characterize 
Exxon's approach to the cleanup as "less than urgent." Clearly, you are not 
familiar with the magnitude of Exxon's response in context with the problems 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
Although Exxon itself had no "on the ground" operating organization in Alaska 
prior to the spill, within 24 hours after the accident Exxon had 35 employees 
on the scene in Valdez, and had hired 200 others. After one week, there were 
800 people employed; after one month, 3,000; and we now expect the people 
involved in the cleanup to approach 7,000. 
</P>
<P>
In just a few weeks' time, Exxon has brought together the largest -- or 
certainly among the largest -- aggregations of personnel, equipment, and 
material ever assembled to combat the effects of an oil spill. And we fully 
intend to complete the cleanup by the Sept. 15 deadline set in the Coast 
Guard-approved cleanup plan.

ESOP SOPS UP TAXES TO LITTLE EFFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. SAMUELSON, Robert J. Samuelson writes about economic issues from 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's something intuitively appealing about ESOPs -- employee stock ownership 
plans. They're a sort of workers' capitalism. The idea is that workers become 
shareholders in their own company. They're then more committed to its success. 
Conflicts between workers and managers fade. Cooperation flourishes. The 
company becomes more productive and profitable. Workers get rich. Society 
prospers. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is that ESOPs don't actually operate this way. Perhaps 200 major 
companies have adopted them in the past year. Procter &amp; Gamble is among the 
latest. But don't expect a surge of worker involvement or improved corporate 
efficiency. The infatuation with ESOPs is strictly expedient. They provide 
generous corporate tax savings and offer top executives a new defense against 
hostile takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
Suppose you're one of Procter &amp; Gamble's 77,000 workers. The company will 
contribute $1 billion in stock to its own ESOP. The stock will be allocated to 
workers' individual ESOP accounts over 15 years. That's an average of almost 
$900 per employee a year. Do you come to work earlier? Go home later? Suppose 
you detest your supervisor. Do the two of you now turn into fast friends? 
</P>
<P>
"People aren't (experimental) rats," says Joseph Blasi, author of "Employee 
Ownership, Revolution or Rip-off?" and a management professor at Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo. "They do not respond automatically to modest financial 
incentives." Studies of ESOPs confirm this conclusion. The plans' rewards are 
too small and too distant to change how workers work. Most know that 
individually they can't raise their firm's profits or stock price. 
Profitability and productivity improve only if the ESOPs are part of a broader 
program to engage workers and involve them in everyday decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Nor do the plans give workers something for nothing. An ESOP is a fringe 
benefit. Companies can typically spend only so much for salaries and fringes. 
Spending more on one benefit means spending less on something else, as 
economist Michael Conte of the University of New Orleans points out. Sometimes 
the shift is invisible. But many companies have explicitly cut other benefits 
when creating ESOPs. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury estimates that ESOPs will cost the federal government more than $3 
billion in lost revenues over the next five years. This estimate -- made before 
the recent ESOP boom -- may prove far too low. To promote ESOPs, Congress has 
granted them many tax breaks. A company creating an ESOP usually borrows (say, 
from a bank) to buy its own common stock or to finance an issue of new stock. 
The stock goes into the ESOP, triggering these tax benefits: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The company can deduct both interest and repayment of the loan's principal 
from taxable income. Normally, only interest is deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The lender (in this case, the bank) doesn't have to pay taxes on half the 
interest income from ESOP loans. Some of the tax savings are passed onto the 
borrower. Consequently, ESOP loans have interest rates 1 to 1.5 percentage 
points lower than normal business loans. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The company creating the ESOP generally gets a deduction for stock 
dividends paid to the plan. Dividends aren't usually tax deductible. 
</P>
<P>
But these tax breaks didn't start corporate America's ESOP stampede. What did 
was the demonstration -- by Polaroid -- that ESOPs could be used as a takeover 
defense. Creating an ESOP places a big block of stock in friendly hands. 
Employees are less likely to sell their shares, because they fear new owners 
might fire workers. An ESOP can act as a powerful takeover deterrent in states 
with tough anti-takeover laws. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Delaware, where about half of all major U.S. companies are chartered. 
The Delaware anti-takeover law requires a hostile buyer to get 85% of a 
company's stock before being able to exercise effective control. Thus, many new 
ESOPs tie up about 15% of a firm's stock. 
</P>
<P>
There have been ESOP successes. In 1984, Weirton Steel Corp. in West Virginia 
was spared bankruptcy through an ESOP. But the workers also took a 20% pay cut, 
and the real spur to better cooperation was the threat to jobs. A few stirring 
stories don't justify a huge tax break. 
</P>
<P>
The ESOP was once touted as a way to transfer corporate wealth to workers. But 
the rise of pension funds has already accomplished significant redistribution. 
In 1950, pensions owned stocks equal to less than 1% of the stocks owned 
directly by households. In 1988, pensions owned $758 billion of stock, equal to 
one-third of household stock wealth. ESOPs contributed almost nothing to this 
process. 
</P>
<P>
ESOPs are a growing waste of taxpayer money. They may foster corporate 
inefficiency by sheltering mediocre managements. Getting workers and managers 
to cooperate is important, but tax breaks for ESOPs can't achieve that. 
Employee stock ownership and profit-sharing can succeed as a part of a wider 
corporate commitment to a collaborative style of management. That's a 
commitment that companies and workers must make themselves. It can't be imposed 
from Washington.

ATTEMPTED MURDER CHARGE FILED IN ATTACK ON HAWTHORNE POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charges of attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon were filed 
Wednesday against a man who allegedly drove into a police officer Sunday, in 
what authorities said was the second attack on Hawthorne undercover officers in 
five days. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Castro, 30, of Hawthorne, will be arraigned on the two felony charges, 
authorities said, when he is released from the jail ward at Los Angeles 
County-USC Medical Center, where he was reported to be in good condition after 
being shot in the left arm by officers. 
</P>
<P>
Two other men, who police also described as gang members, were shot during the 
confrontation in the parking lot of a small machine shop at the corner of Yukon 
Avenue and 132nd Street. Carlos Lopez, 29, of Long Beach died of his wounds. 
Nestor Largaspada, 25, was reported in stable condition at the hospital jail 
ward. 
</P>
<P>
The bloody confrontation between police and the three men occurred at the end 
of a weeklong undercover operation by Hawthorne police. It was near the start 
of the operation that a man shot at two other officers. 
</P>
<P>
A half dozen officers were patrolling in the neighborhood near Yukon Avenue and 
132nd Street, attempting to stop a rash of car burglaries and car thefts, Sgt. 
Vince Schiavi said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers wore civilian clothes and patrolled on bicycles and on foot 
through the area of homes, apartments and light industrial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weekend Incident 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation between the policemen and the three men began at about 1:30 
a.m. Sunday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Karla Wurthman gave the following account: 
</P>
<P>
Two policemen were walking on Yukon Avenue toward their unmarked police car, 
when two cars drove past, one after the other. The occupants asked: "Where are 
you from?" Recognizing the question as a challenge that often precedes a 
drive-by shooting, the two officers identified themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Castro was allegedly driving the second car. Immediately after the officers 
said they were police, the second car entered a nearby parking lot in front of 
a small machine shop and knocked a third officer off a bicycle. As a fourth 
officer tried to go to his fallen comrade's aid, he was hit by the other car, 
allegedly driven by Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
Several officers, whose names were withheld, opened fire and all three suspects 
were hit, Wurthman said. 
</P>
<P>
Largaspada will not be charged because he was a passenger in Castro's car, 
Wurthman said. 
</P>
<P>
One officer suffered a concussion and the other officer got bumps and bruises 
in the attack, but both are expected to return to duty soon, Schiavi said. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's attack came five days after another man shot at two officers from the 
undercover unit. 
</P>
<P>
The two officers were patrolling on bicycles on Doty Avenue when a man 
challenged them to a fight, Schiavi said. When the officers ignored him, the 
man walked into the middle of the street, crouched and fire a single shot, 
Schiavi said. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Guerra, 23, has been charged with attempted murder in connection with that 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the attacks on the officers, Hawthorne police described the undercover 
operation as a success. The unit arrested 16 adults and two juveniles for 
felonies ranging from vehicle theft and burglary to drug possession, Schiavi 
said.

INGLEWOOD SCHOOL BOARD RACE HEATS UP; 
</P>
<P>
MAYOR SENDS LETTER TO RESIDENTS URGING REELECTION OF DEAD CANDIDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent launched an offensive against school board 
challenger Thomasina Reed this week, mailing a letter to residents that 
questions Reed's commitment to the community and urges voters to reelect the 
late Caroline Coleman in the June 6 runoff election. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's campaign, which has proceeded with her name on the ballot despite her 
death April 22, has been spearheaded by Vincent and by Coleman's daughters, 
Lisa and Keely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Campaign Strategy 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's daughters, who have been running the campaign mostly from the living 
room of their Inglewood home, and other Coleman supporters say Reed, a newcomer 
to Inglewood politics, is not the best candidate to replace Coleman, a 10-year 
incumbent who was the veteran member of the school board. 
</P>
<P>
A Coleman victory, her supporters say, would give other candidates a chance to 
seek the seat. 
</P>
<P>
But the Coleman campaign is facing a stiff challenge from Reed, a Ladera 
Heights attorney who won 26% of the vote April 4, forcing Coleman into a 
runoff. Two other candidates received a combined total of 29% of the vote. 
Coleman won 44% of the vote despite making no campaign appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, who was 51, died less than three weeks after the April primary. Lisa 
Coleman said her mother had been suffering from cancer for more than a year and 
died at her home from cardiopulmonary arrest resulting from the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's death left one vacancy on the five-seat school board and eliminated 
its most experienced member. The remaining members -- Larry Aubry, Lois 
Hill-Hale, Zyra McCloud and Joseph Rouzan -- each have served less than two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
If Reed loses, however, board officials must either appoint someone to fill the 
seat or call a special election. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, 40, has argued that a special election is an expense the school board can 
ill afford. County officials said they were working Wednesday on projecting the 
cost for a special election and would report their conclusion to board 
officials this week. One district official, however, estimated that such an 
election could cost about $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Laughingstock of Country' 
</P>
<P>
Reed said a Coleman victory, coming less than seven months after the late 
Assemblyman Curtis Tucker was posthumously reelected, would make Inglewood "the 
laughingstock of the country." 
</P>
<P>
"Nowhere else do they continue to elect the deceased," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker, who was reelected last November several weeks after his death from 
cancer, was later replaced by his son, Curtis Tucker Jr., who won a special 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, who has been endorsed by Hill-Hale, cites her experience as an attorney 
and her concern for the improvement of the Inglewood school system as her 
qualifications for the seat. 
</P>
<P>
She also has been endorsed by County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn and U.S. Rep. 
Julian Dixon (D-Inglewood), who originally supported Coleman. She is also 
endorsed by U.S. Rep. Mervyn Dymally (D-Compton). 
</P>
<P>
In her campaign, Reed has called for increased attention to the needs of the 
school district's Latino students, who make up 40% of the enrollment. She has 
urged more recruitment of Latino principals and $5,000 incentive bonuses for 
bilingual teachers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Reed said, it is crucial that the board have a fifth member in 
place before budget deliberations begin. The board has held several budget 
study sessions, and tentative approval is required by June 30. 
</P>
<P>
The sometimes acrimonious battle between Reed and Coleman supporters -- who 
include Councilmen Anthony Scardenzan and Ervin (Tony) Thomas -- has been 
marked by allegations from both sides concerning Coleman's deathbed wishes for 
filling her school board seat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Statement Produced 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Reed produced a statement signed by Inglewood resident and former 
council candidate Mark Ganier, stating that Coleman told him the day before her 
death that she would oppose a special election. Ganier also said Coleman told 
him she preferred supporting Reed to spending money for a special election. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's family, however, has denied that she made such statements. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent, a longtime Coleman ally, in turn mailed his letter to residents, 
saying that before Coleman died, she told her children to help elect a 
"successor with a track record of service to the community and its schools." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent's letter charged that Reed "meets none of the criteria" and it urged 
residents to vote for Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
That Reed moved to Inglewood in 1987 and that her daughter did not attend high 
school in Inglewood have been sore points with Reed's detractors, who charge 
Reed with trying to use the school board as a springboard to higher political 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a person involved in the city, in the school district, who has 
children who go to the schools," said Lisa Coleman, 25. "(Reed) was never 
around before, so why all of a sudden is she running?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Questions Relevancy 
</P>
<P>
Reed, former minority student recruitment director for the University of 
Pennsylvania, argues that length of her residency in Inglewood and where her 
daughter went to school are moot. 
</P>
<P>
"What has that got to do with being qualified to serve on the board?" Reed 
asked. "Are they saying only people who've grown up and lived in Inglewood or 
have sent their children to Inglewood schools are the only people who can serve 
on the school board?" 
</P>
<P>
Reed has also questioned how Coleman mailers and campaign literature were paid 
for. Although campaign mailers on behalf of Coleman were sent to voters the 
week before the April primary, the expense report filed by her campaign for the 
period ending March 18 listed no money raised or spent. 
</P>
<P>
A final expense report on the April election was due May 25, but because 
Coleman is dead, her election committee has until July 31 to file a financial 
statement covering the third reporting period, according to the county 
registrar's office. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said that after Coleman's death, an independent committee was formed in 
her memory to support the reelection effort, including payment for the letter 
he signed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Financial Statements 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Michioku, a spokeswoman for the Fair Political Practices Commission, said 
such independent committees are not legally obligated to file financial 
disclosure statements if they are not connected with the official election 
committee and if they spend less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
In her financial statement for the period ending May 20, Reed reported raising 
$4,958, bringing the total for the three reporting periods to $18,848. She also 
reported having spent $16,364 since Jan. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Both Reed and Coleman supporters say their goal is to help improve the 
15,000-student Inglewood Unified School District, which in the past has faced a 
budget deficit, poor academic performance and allegations of corruption and 
political interference in board decisions. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, then Supt. Rex Fortune was fired and later reinstated amid charges 
that he refused to appoint a friend of the mayor's as a school principal. 
Fortune resigned last July to take a superintendent's job in the Sacramento 
area. His successor, George McKenna, was hired in October. 
</P>
<P>
Although board member Hill-Hale has endorsed Reed, board members Rouzan and 
Aubry, both of whom endorsed Coleman in the primary, have made no endorsements 
in the runoff. Board member Zyra McCloud is also remaining neutral. 
</P>
<P>
Spending district money for a special election, Rouzan said, would mean "we're 
going to be without a fifth school board member again for several months, and 
we have very serious business ahead. . . . It means fewer books, less 
opportunity to fix up some of our decadent classrooms, less opportunity to 
reduce class size, less pay for teachers and staff." 
</P>
<P>
Board President Aubry said the district, which in the past has been financially 
strapped, now has a reserve of about $1.8 million. But he said the money that 
would be spent on a special election could be used more wisely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hope for Second Chance 
</P>
<P>
Despite those misgivings, a number of potential candidates hope for a Coleman 
victory Tuesday to resurrect their own chances in a special election. 
</P>
<P>
Jewett Walker, who came in third in April with 19.2% of the vote, said he 
"absolutely" plans to run if a special election is called. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got people making phone calls in selected areas -- Ladera Heights, for 
example -- encouraging people to vote for Coleman," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Coleman, who is rumored to be a potential candidate, said it is possible 
she might run in a special election but that she hasn't made a final decision.

<P>
And community activist Mildred McNair, who has run unsuccessfully for the 
school board and a number of other local offices, said she would run again in a 
special school board election. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a vote for Caroline, it's a vote for fairness," McNair said. "You're 
not voting for a dead person. You're voting to open up the process."

CAR DEALER ADMITS TRYSTS WITH CALL GIRLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prominent auto dealer Tony McCune testified in a packed courtroom Wednesday 
that he had sex with prostitutes provided by alleged madam Karen Wilkening. 
</P>
<P>
McCune, who has not been charged with any offense, appeared after he was 
subpoenaed by the San Diego County district attorney's office as a witness in 
the preliminary hearing of Wilkening, 43, who is charged with 28 counts of 
pimping and pandering and other charges stemming from her flight from the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
McCune's name first surfaced in a preliminary hearing for Wilkening before she 
fled the country in September, 1987, for the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkening and lawyer Buford Wiley Jr. have been charged with conspiracy to 
obstruct justice as the result of her disappearance while facing chargers. 
Wilkening was arrested in Manila last month and returned to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, McCune's office, car and home have been searched by police armed 
with a search warrant as part of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Bonnie Dumanis declined comment when asked if McCune were 
going to be charged with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, McCune provided Wiley with thousands of dollars 
to be given to Wilkening while she was a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Brent Barnes, 52, of Bonita, who was Wilkening co-defendant when she 
was charged in 1987, also testified at the hearing before San Diego Municipal 
Judge Lisa Guy-Schall Wednesday. Barnes pleaded no contest in that case and was 
sentenced to 120 days at a work furlough center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clasped Hand on Leaving 
</P>
<P>
As he left the courtroom Wednesday, Barnes clasped Wilkening's hand in a 
friendly fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Businessman Ronald Coover, another witness Wednesday, testified that Wilkening 
provided him with three women whom he paid to have sex with. He said he paid 
one woman $100 and two others $150 each. 
</P>
<P>
Coover said he met Wilkening at a New Year's Eve party at Horton Plaza, and she 
told him she had a friend in town who needed a date. 
</P>
<P>
Also testifying was Teresa Maes, 28, who identified herself as a prostitute who 
worked for Wilkening for one year, said she met her in 1983. Maes said she 
charged $150 "for an appointment" and gave $50 of that to Wilkening. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes people did not want sex; sometimes they just wanted to be talked 
to," Maes said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Marilyn Huff appeared at the hearing on behalf of television channels 
8 and 10 after the judge ruled that one witness, a former prostitute, not be 
identified by name in court or photographed. 
</P>
<P>
Huff told the judge that "the public has a right to know about these 
proceedings." 
</P>
<P>
Guy-Schall ordered the TV cameras not to photograph the witness and told the 
attorneys only to refer to her as Jane Doe I. The woman is now married, has a 
family and fears for her safety if identified publicly, said an attorney.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN FOUND DEAD IN HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance police are investigating the slaying of a 26-year-old woman, who was 
apparently strangled as she moved into her new Park Del Amo townhouse on 
Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Tracy J. Morrigan was discovered by her mother Wednesday morning 
when she arrived at the complex to help her daughter move in. Detectives said 
they have no suspects and no motive in the crime. 
</P>
<P>
There was no evidence of forced entry, and it was not known how long Morrigan 
had been dead when she was found, said Sgt. Jack McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they know little about Morrigan, except that she was not married 
and that her parents, whose name they would not release, are residents of Palos 
Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald said the mother told him that Morrigan had just purchased the 
townhouse with money from an inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
Because of security precautions at the complex, police and residents were 
surprised by the murder, which they said is the first reported violent crime at 
the townhouse and condominium development. Park Del Amo is surrounded by cement 
walls with steel gates and is patrolled by security guards from 4 p.m. to 6 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"People will be cautious for a while," said one resident who preferred 
anonymity. "I'm not going to worry about it."

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ZONING CHANGE APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Torrance City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to rezone a two-block 
neighborhood in southeast Torrance from multifamily to single-family zoning. 
</P>
<P>
In a petition to the Planning Department, 21 residents near Border Avenue and 
San Ardo Street asked for the zone change to preserve the neighborhood's 
character by banning apartment buildings and condominiums. There are 26 
single-family houses on the two blocks. 
</P>
<P>
The zone change will take effect June 29. There was no opposition to Tuesday's 
council action. Residents have told city officials that they oppose the density 
that apartment buildings have brought to surrounding neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar situation last month, 16 residents of the 1000 block of Amapola 
Avenue asked the city to declare the block a historic overlay district. 
Residents said they feared that without the historic zoning, developers would 
replace older homes with condominiums and apartments. The council instead 
approved a zone change that requires a public hearing before any construction 
takes place on that block. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Director David Ferren said in an interview this week that there is a 
danger that such piecemeal rezoning could set a precedent for residents in 
other neighborhoods who want a zone change and could lead to irregularities in 
the city's residential zoning. 
</P>
<P>
After Tuesday's decision, Mayor Katy Geissert said she is not worried about 
such a problem because it so unusual to find a neighborhood in agreement about 
a zone change.

LAWSUIT SAYS HOSPITAL WAS NEGLIGENT IN PATIENT DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 63-year-old Torrance man died of injuries after he was left unattended and 
fell out of a hospital bed after brain surgery at South Bay Hospital last 
February, his family has charged in connection with a lawsuit filed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The suit in Torrance Superior Court charges Dr. Melvin Snyder, South Bay 
Hospital and its parent company, American Medical International Inc., with 
negligence in the death of Donald Tomkinson. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder could not be reached for comment. The hospital declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Was Left Sitting Up 
</P>
<P>
Tomkinson underwent surgery to remove a benign brain tumor Feb. 2 at the 
hospital in Redondo Beach, his daughter, Jacqueline Tomkinson, said in an 
interview Wednesday. He was recovering in South Bay Hospital's intensive care 
unit two days later when he asked to be left alone to use a bedpan, she said. 
</P>
<P>
A nurse told family members later that she left Tomkinson sitting up, with his 
legs hanging over the edge of the bed, and returned to find that he had fallen 
to the floor and hit his head, Jacqueline Tomkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"The nurse never should have let him sit there alone, unguarded," Tomkinson 
said. "I said to them, 'Who is running the show: the patient or the nurse who 
is on duty?' " 
</P>
<P>
Tomkinson never regained consciousness and died Feb. 7 after life-support 
systems were removed, his daughter said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ruled an Accident 
</P>
<P>
The family's lawyer, Bruce Fagel, said the lawsuit will be amended to charge 
that hospital personnel tried to cover up their negligence by claiming that 
Tomkinson fell out of bed because he suffered a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Tomkinson's death was ruled an accident after treatment for a tumor, said Bob 
Dambacher, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office. 
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline Tomkinson said her mother, who is visiting relatives in England, had 
visited her father 10 minutes before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Anxious to Get Home' 
</P>
<P>
"He was doing very well," she said. "He was glad the surgery was over and he 
was anxious to get home and rest and recover at home." 
</P>
<P>
She said her father planned to return to work as an engineer after he recovered 
from surgery.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fire that destroyed the Farmers Bazaar and the century-old building that 
housed it was started by an "electrical problem," Sgt. Frank Barone from the 
Metro Arson Strike Team said Wednesday. Investigators believe the fire erupted 
in the arcade room on the mezzanine level, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Although investigators are uncertain what caused the electrical problem, Barone 
said witnesses told investigators the building was plagued by problems with the 
electrical system that led to power outages and tripped switches. There are no 
plans to file criminal charges in the incident, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Farmers Bazaar burned down last week in a four-alarm fire battled by about 
120 firefighters, who struggled with the flames for two hours. The bazaar was a 
downtown produce emporium of common and exotic vegetables, situated near L 
Street and 7th Avenue. The building also included a barber shop, fish market 
and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported among the estimated 200 shopkeepers and 50 employees 
inside at the time. But four firefighters suffered minor injuries in fighting 
the fire.

HARVARD WINS TENNIS TITLE TO CAP A SURPRISING SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pat List wears a baseball cap with the phrase "You are dust" scrawled on the 
underside of its brim. Occasionally, List flashes the disparaging message to an 
opponent to warn him of his impending fate. 
</P>
<P>
"I flick it up if I win," said List, a Harvard High junior and co-captain of 
the tennis team. "It hasn't lost yet." 
</P>
<P>
Nor has Harvard -- at least in the postseason. The Saracens won their third 
consecutive Southern Section title and first in the 2-A Division on Wednesday, 
beating Righetti of Santa Maria, 12-6, at Riviera Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
The loss left Righetti Coach Roy Sajona tipping his hat as well. 
</P>
<P>
"(Harvard is) really tough because they are so deep," said Sajona, whose team 
finished 21-2 and advanced to the final by beating top-seeded Cate in the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard (22-4) is deep enough, in fact, to win the championship despite losing 
five seniors from last year's nine-man team and this year's top player 
(shoulder injury). In addition, the Saracens moved up from the 1-A Division 
after winning consecutive championships and joined the San Fernando Valley 
League. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very impressed by the way we came together," said Coach Harry 
Salamandra, toweling off after a group of players drenched him with the 
contents of a water cooler. "But there was nobody that was a superstar for us." 
</P>
<P>
There were, however, several outstanding performances Wednesday. List and Chris 
Pisano, who went undefeated in league play and lost just one set in the 
playoffs, swept all three doubles opponents in the round-robin format, 6-2, 
6-1, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
The win should silence critics who, according to List, called this a rebuilding 
team and the weakest Harvard squad in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years?" Salamandra said, pausing. "Maybe five. This team had the least 
amount of postseason experience in the last five years." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Wagner and Rickey Schoenberg, the Saracens' No. 3 doubles team, were not 
fazed by the inexperience label and swept to 6-3, 6-1, 6-1 wins. 
</P>
<P>
Raj Vaswani, Harvard's top singles player, defeated Josh Johnston, 6-1, lost to 
Mark Hickey, 7-6, and lost the third set by default after complaining of leg 
pains. 
</P>
<P>
Saracen Mike Kim defeated Mike Day, 6-4, and Hickey, 6-4, and lost to Johnston, 
6-0. Freshman Chuck Tseng lost to Johnston, 6-2, Day, 6-1, and Hickey, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
In other doubles matches, Harvard's Kumaran Arulanantham and John Fogarty 
defeated Brad Dantzer and Fran Solorio, 6-1, beat Matt Rumbaugh and Mike 
Hickey, 6-1, and lost to Aaron Smith and Josh Sahara, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that (Righetti was) going to be on fire," Pisano said. "We were real 
businesslike." 
</P>
<P>
It was Pisano who, along with List, spearheaded an unsuccessful campaign to 
change the team mascot to a Grim Reaper -- suggesting the demise of the 
opponent -- clutching a tennis racket instead of a scythe.

CITY SECTION BASEBALL PLAYOFFS; 
</P>
<P>
NO. 1 CHATSWORTH AGAIN FALLS SHY OF ITS OBJECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps the Chatsworth High baseball program should consider a new insignia. 
Instead of a block C centered on a five-pointed star, a semicircle with a slash 
through it might be more appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
The Chancellors have mastered the incomplete task, missing out on yet another 
shot at a City Section 4-A Division baseball title -- a step short of Dodger 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Arguably the Valley area's most successful baseball program in the '80s, 
top-seeded Chatsworth (21-7) capped the decade in familiar fashion with a 9-8 
loss to Palisades in the semifinals Wednesday at Cal State Northridge. The 
victory moves Palisades (25-4) into the 4-A final against Kennedy, an 8-7 
winner over Sylmar, at 7:30 tonight at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Palisades last advanced to the City final in 1982, when Bret Saberhagen, then 
of Cleveland, pitched a no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins rallied for two runs in the bottom of the seventh inning to extend 
Chatsworth's reign of frustration. Since 1981, Chatsworth has reached the 
semifinals seven times and advanced to the final only once, winning the title 
in 1983. The loss also marked the third consecutive year in which the 
Chancellors have lost in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bob Lofrano and his players argue that the evidence is only 
semi-conclusive, attributing their annoying habit to coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, we're aware of it," senior second baseman Vince Simili said. "But it 
doesn't have anything to do with the semifinals. Absolutely, I still believe 
we're the best team in the City." 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Derek Wallace, who will attend Pepperdine in the fall, has waited three 
seasons to make that claim but will end his career without a boast. Instead, he 
will be stuck with the memory of one of his worst performances. He was hitless 
in five at-bats, twice failed to produce a run with the bases loaded and gave 
up the winning runs on a pair of ground-rule doubles in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
"I choked," he said. "I played a lousy game all-around." 
</P>
<P>
With Chatsworth nursing an 8-7 lead in the seventh, Wallace relieved Jason 
Evans with pinch-hitter Brett Garcia on second and a 3-and-1 count on Mario 
Cobian. One strike later, Cobian lofted a fly ball down the left-field line 
that dropped behind Nick Schultz and hopped the wall, scoring Garcia with the 
tying run. 
</P>
<P>
After a wild pitch sent Cobian to third, Wallace induced Jason Beckerman into a 
ground out at third and then intentionally walked Mike Codron. Barry Levine, 
who earlier belted his eighth home run of the season, then took a strike before 
hitting a ground-rule double that scored Cobian with the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace (9-3) won 16 games in his career and saved eight more, but Levine was 
unimpressed. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept hearing how great he was and we were nervous about facing their No. 
1," Levine said. "But he didn't look that tough warming up. I thought Evans 
looked tougher." 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who worked 3 2/3 scoreless innings to earn the win in Tuesday's 11-6 
victory over Grant, pitched two impressive innings of relief after replacing 
starter Reed McMackin to open the fifth. He struck out the heart of the order 
on 11 pitches and then started the sixth with two more strikeouts before 
retiring the side in order. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chatsworth recovered from a 5-1 deficit to take its only lead of the 
game in the top of the sixth. With the Chancellors trailing, 7-6, Evans coaxed 
a walk out of Codron, who improved to 9-3 despite allowing 19 baserunners. 
</P>
<P>
Simili singled to left and Evans scored when Rich Aude's sharp ground ball went 
through shortstop Larry Israel for an error. Simili moved to third on the play 
and scored on Eric Johnson's fly ball to center. 
</P>
<P>
After Israel made a diving play to retire Wallace on a ground out, Chatsworth 
loaded the bases on walks to Kevin Chong and Doug Lambeck. But Codron struck 
out pinch-hitter Ron Niemi to end the threat. Chatsworth stranded 12 
baserunners in all. 
</P>
<P>
Palisades scored single runs in the first and second and then struck for three 
in the third on a run-scoring double by Codron and Levine's two-run homer for a 
5-1 lead. Chatsworth, limited to Simili's second homer of the year through 
three innings, tied the score in the fourth on a two-run double by Mike Mancuso 
and Aude's two-run single, one of three hits for the Chatsworth third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Lofrano ordered the players to sit quietly on the bench while 
Palisades ran victory wind sprints in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing to say at that moment is nothing," he said. "It's better to sit 
and let all the frustration go. We've won more than our share of these kind of 
games and I'm not going to look at this as a negative." 
</P>
<P>
After six semifinal losses in the past nine seasons, Lofrano claims he harbors 
no anger because of another such setback. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say that we should have won because they got two legitimate runs in 
the seventh," he said.

MIRALESTE JUMPER AIMING AT NEW HEIGHTS; 
</P>
<P>
FATHER'S MEMORY INSPIRES MARILYN CRAGIN IN BIDS FOR CIF TITLE, COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As a high jumper, Marilyn Cragin of Miraleste High has overcome heights to 
become one of the top track and field athletes in California. 
</P>
<P>
But it is off the track where the brainy senior recently faced the biggest 
hurdle in her life. 
</P>
<P>
Cragin, who will compete in the CIF State Track Championships on Friday and 
Saturday at Cerritos College, is also an accomplished volleyball player. Her 
skills as a middle blocker earned her a scholarship to Notre Dame next fall. 
</P>
<P>
It was on the volleyball court where Cragin, while playing in a tournament in 
Las Vegas last February, lost her father. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Cragin, principal at Fleming Junior High in Lomita and former assistant 
principal at Banning High, was watching Marilyn from the stands when he 
suffered a fatal heart attack. He died in an ambulance en route to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn has used the memory of her father as a source of inspiration in 
volleyball and track. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the biggest inspiration I could ever have," said Marilyn, an articulate 
18-year-old who is co-holder of the Miraleste girls high jump record with a 
mark of 5 feet, 9 inches. "I think about him a lot and he inspires me. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a heart attack about nine years ago," she added, "and since then he'd 
been living every day to the fullest. He spent a lot of time with the family 
and did a lot of traveling. 
</P>
<P>
"When he was in the ambulance, he asked how the team was doing. That's just the 
type of guy he was." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn, who also plays for the South Bay Volleyball Club, recalls the night 
before her father's death when the club team was in a tournament in Las Vegas: 
</P>
<P>
"He took the team to the casinos. And they (her teammates) got to know him. 
They were telling me what a nice father I had, so it hit the team hard." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn said her teammates were so shaken that they considered quitting the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"They questioned whether we should continue playing after he died," she said. 
"But I told them that he would have wanted us to play." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn and her teammates on the South Bay team have dedicated their season to 
Pat Cragin. 
</P>
<P>
"We have his name inside a heart on all of our shirts," she said. "The whole 
club dedicated the season to him." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss of her father, Marilyn has continued to jump well, although 
she says volleyball has become her top priority. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I have concentrated a little less this year because of volleyball," 
said Marilyn, who qualified for the state championships for the third time with 
a jump of 5-4 at the Southern Section Masters Meet last Friday. "But I know I 
am a lot stronger because I had a strong year in volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
"This week I took off volleyball and I'm just concentrating on jumping." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn finished fifth in the state as a sophomore and took third last year. 
She tied the Miraleste record last year and will try to clear 5-9 at the state 
meet in the final competition of her prep career. 
</P>
<P>
She said her experience in big meets gives her a slight edge over her 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get nervous before a meet," she said. "I see that as a difference 
between me and other girls. I've been there before and I know what's going on 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn will not be able to jump in college because Notre Dame does not have a 
women's track and field team. 
</P>
<P>
But she is not overly concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get a volleyball scholarship," she said. "When I took my trip to 
Notre Dame, I talked to the coach and she said I wouldn't have time to jump 
because they play all year long. 
</P>
<P>
"So no matter where I went, I probably wouldn't jump." 
</P>
<P>
But she may return to jumping after college. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody tells me to keep it (jumping) open for later. You can jump at a 
later age, but volleyball is harder on your body. 
</P>
<P>
"You can stay in your prime for a long time as a jumper." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn has been able to stay in her prime for three years, according to 
Miraleste Coach Bill Maynard, who points to her ability to jump consistently. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always managed to have excellent jumpers here," said Maynard. "Maybe the 
Hill is blessed with high jumpers on this side. But Marilyn is one of the most 
consistent I've ever had. She enjoys anything that takes energy and work. She 
even has tried to jump when injured." 
</P>
<P>
She has a grade-point average of 3.4 and chose Notre Dame because of its 
rigorous academics. 
</P>
<P>
Her mother is a counselor at Narbonne High. 
</P>
<P>
While making the decision to attend Notre Dame, Marilyn said she had doubts 
about her ability to succeed academically. 
</P>
<P>
But again, she turned to her father. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was looking to Notre Dame, I had doubts about whether I could handle 
the academics, but he always told me I could make it." 
</P>
<P>
She's made it through one of life's crushing realities. 
</P>
<P>
Making it in college should be a breeze.

PREP NOTES / ROB FERNAS: EL SEGUNDO HOPES TO END '80S WITH CIF BASEBALL CROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rob Fernas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Segundo High built a reputation as one of Southern California's premier 
baseball programs by winning two CIF-Southern Section titles in the 1960s and 
three in the '70s with such players as slugger George Brett and pitcher Scott 
McGregor. 
</P>
<P>
So far, though, the Eagles are 0 for the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
They hope to change that Saturday when they close out the decade by facing San 
Marino for the 2-A Division title at 10 a.m. at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's about time to win another one," said assistant coach Craig 
Cousins after El Segundo defeated Temple City, 4-2, Tuesday in the semifinals 
at Culver City High. 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Stevenson, gunning for his sixth CIF title in 30 years, agreed that 
it's been "too long" between finals. This marks the ninth time he has guided El 
Segundo into the finals and the first time since 1980 when it lost to Mater 
Dei, 8-5, in the 4-A championship game at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Although some considered this a rebuilding season -- El Segundo returned only 
one starter from last year, outfielder Erik Evans -- Stevenson was confident 
the team could go far. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody figured this was going to be a year when things didn't happen for 
us," he said. "But I told everybody, 'Hey, don't count us out. This team is 
good.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's really been a storybook year for the seniors." 
</P>
<P>
Not considered a particularly talented class compared to an extraordinary group 
of underclassmen, the seniors have come through with exceptional years. 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Pat Llamas, third baseman Chris Lane and left fielder Jeremy 
Carr -- all junior varsity players last season -- have played consistently. 
Pitcher Rick Clark, sidelined last year with an arm injury, improved to 9-0 
Tuesday with a six-hitter. And Evans, who dropped off last season after an 
impressive sophomore year, leads the team with six home runs and 37 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson, who watched his pitchers give up 19 hits in a 14-13 win over La 
Canada last Friday, said his main concern going into the Temple City game was 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
"I was worried that we wouldn't be able to score runs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo collected only five hits against Temple City right-hander Brian 
McGraw, but two were for extra bases. Llamas delivered a run-scoring double to 
left-center field in the second inning and Garret Quiantance broke a 2-2 tie 
with a solo home run to right field in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson said McGraw was more impressive when he scouted the lanky pitcher 
earlier in the season. In that game, McGraw struck out 16 in a 5-3 victory over 
La Canada. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard baseball Coach Bob Yarnall, whose team finished second to El 
Segundo in the Camino Real League, says junior shortstop Mark Lewis was the 
most valuable addition to the Eagles this season. Lewis transferred to El 
Segundo from Rolling Hills where he started as a freshman and sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
"He made their team complete," said Yarnall, watching Tuesday's game. "He 
allowed all the other players to play their normal positions." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis turned in a defensive gem to open the fifth inning against Temple City, 
backhanding a hard grounder in the hole by leadoff hitter Scott Wirz and 
throwing him out. It was a big play because the next batter singled to left. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins, the Eagles' veteran assistant coach, said it was one of their best 
defensive performances despite the fact that regular third baseman Lane didn't 
start because he inadvertently missed practice Monday. Lane played the seventh 
inning Tuesday and handled the game's final out. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest day in the young athletic career of Hawthorne senior Curtis 
Conway will take place Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from competing in four events in the CIF State Track Championships at 
Cerritos College, Conway will take the Scholastic Aptitude Test for the final 
time in hope of qualifying for a football scholarship to USC. 
</P>
<P>
"He's enough of an athlete to do what he has to do, but it is distracting," 
said Hawthorne track Coach Kye Courtney. "It's been in the back of his head." 
</P>
<P>
Since the test runs from 8 a.m. to noon and the track meet doesn't start until 
5 p.m., Courtney said Conway will have sufficient time to prepare for his races 
in the 100 and 200 meters and 400 and 1,600 relays. 
</P>
<P>
This will be the fifth time Conway has taken the SAT. He needs a 700 score in 
order to attend USC on scholarship. The results of his last test, taken May 6 
on the morning after the senior prom, will not be available until next week, 
Courtney said. 
</P>
<P>
"(Conway) said he did pretty good. He thinks he passed it," the coach said. 
"But you never know." 
</P>
<P>
Conway, who holds the state's best times this season in the 100 (10.44, 
wind-aided) and 200 (21.04), made it clear last week at a luncheon for the 
Shrine All-Star football game that he prefers football over track. 
</P>
<P>
"In football, every play is like a race in track," said the All-CIF 
quarterback. "In track, you only get to race three or four times a meet." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne's boys have won the state title in the 1,600-meter relay for six 
straight years and own the best time in the state this season (3:13.05). 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Courtney still has not settled on four runners heading into the state 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still moving people around," he said. "We're going to coach this thing 
right down to the end." 
</P>
<P>
The team of Chris Alexander, Ismael Delpino, Kevin Gatlin and Conway placed 
first at the Southern Section Masters Meet last Friday in 3:13.43, but Courtney 
said Delpino or Gatlin might be replaced this weekend by Erik Allen, a talented 
sophomore who qualified for the state meet in the 100 and 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on what happens to Allen in the 200," Courtney said. "If he doesn't 
make the final, we'll move him to the relay." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander, Delpino and Conway were members of last year's 1,600 relay team that 
won the state title in 3:10.46. 
</P>
<P>
PREP NOTES -- Rolling Hills High is looking for football coaches. Coaching 
experience is preferred but not necessary. Anyone interested should contact 
Coach Gary Kimbrell or Athletic Director John Barr at 377-4888 . . . Five South 
Bay senior athletes will be recognized for academic excellence by the 
CIF-Southern Section at the fourth annual Academic Awards program Tuesday at 
Anaheim Stadium: Peter Swartz of Chadwick (3.69 grade-point average), Roy 
Figueroa (3.74) and Monica Huerta (3.83) of Mary Star and Paul Christenson 
(3.88) and Sara Dyer (3.90) of South Torrance. To qualify, athletes must have a 
minimum GPA of 3.5 in college-prep courses for the last three years, in 
addition to lettering in at least one varsity sport and participating in an 
extracurricular activity. Each honoree will have the opportunity to attend 
Tuesday's Angels-Cleveland Indians game . . . The state track meet will be 
televised on Prime Ticket cable at 8 p.m. Tuesday.

REDSHIRT SEASON COULD SAVE CSUN FROM A RED-FACED DIVISION I DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Ortega 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among them, they scored 36 points and earned All-American honors in four events 
in the NCAA Division II track and field championships in Hampton, Va., last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
They have scored 78 points in the past three Division II championships and have 
been honored as All-Americans 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is a good chance that Cal State Northridge juniors Darcy 
Arreola, Lolita Pile and Walt Stewart will not compete in next year's Division 
II meet. 
</P>
<P>
With Northridge scheduled to move up to the Division I ranks in the fall of 
1990, Arreola, Pile and Stewart might redshirt next season so they can compete 
at the Division I level in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"We're thinking very seriously about doing that," Northridge Coach Don Strametz 
said. "Those three should be able to make an immediate impact at that level. 
They should give us some credibility when we move up." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, winner of the 3,000 meters and runner-up in the 1,500 in last 
weekend's Division II meet at Hampton University, has met the Division I 
qualifying standard in the 1,500 every year in which she has competed for 
Northridge. She has bettered the Division I standard in the 3,000 the past two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola will run in the 1,500-meter trials in the Division I meet in Provo, 
Utah, today and, should she qualify, in the final Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Pile, runner-up in the Division II triple jump, qualified for the Division I 
meet in that event, but she will not compete because of a hyper-extended right 
elbow. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing serious, but we want to rest her and let it heal," Northridge 
assistant coach Tony Veney said of Pile's injury, which she sustained several 
weeks ago in a workout. "Right now, it hurts enough that she's very conscious 
of it when she lands. She tends to favor it, which throws off her technique." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who defeated defending-champion Bob Sundell of Northwest Missouri 
State in a jump-off for the Division II high jump title, improved his personal 
best to 7 feet, 2 1/2 inches this year, one inch shy of the Division I 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, for one, backs the redshirt plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be for it," he said, "because I wanted to clear the Division I 
standard this year, but I didn't. Competing at that level in 1991 would give me 
some incentive." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, who redshirted the 1988 cross-country season, is opposed to 
redshirting next track season but acknowledged that it might come to pass. Pile 
is unsure of her plans. 
</P>
<P>
Add Stewart: Although Stewart's winning jump of 7-0 1/2 was the lowest in the 
Division II championships since 1983, it capped a superb season for the Notre 
Dame High graduate. 
</P>
<P>
After starting the season with a personal best of 6-11 3/4 -- set as a freshman 
in 1987 -- Stewart leaped 7-0 1/2 at a quadrangular meet at Northridge in 
March, jumped 7-1 3/4 to win the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. title at 
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo on May 13, and cleared 7-2 1/2 to place second in an 
invitational meet at Cal State Los Angeles eight days later. 
</P>
<P>
"I just trained a lot harder this year," Stewart said. "I'm faster and I'm 
stronger and it paid off. I spent more time in the weight room and I ran more 
sprints in workouts, and it's shown in my jumping." 
</P>
<P>
He has grown too. As a 6-foot-3, 175-pound freshman, Stewart placed 13th in the 
1987 Division II meet at Cape Girardeau, Mo. Now Stewart stands 6-4, 185. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm about as big as I want to get," Stewart said. "Now it's just a matter of 
getting stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Last add Stewart: Friday was a big day in the Stewart household: Walt won the 
Division II men's high jump and sister Jenny, a junior at Notre Dame, placed 
fifth (5-4) in the girls' high jump in the Southern Section Masters meet to 
qualify for Friday's state championships at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Supply and demand: Some coaches said it was a predictable result of Proposition 
48 being enforced at the Division II level. 
</P>
<P>
Others said that it was the result of bad weather in much of the country 
earlier this season, which forced the cancellation of several meets and 
hampered performances in others. 
</P>
<P>
Still others claimed it was the result of some Division II schools moving up to 
the Division I level. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, this year's Division II meet was plagued by a lack of 
depth in several events. 
</P>
<P>
Only two women met the qualifying standard in the 200 meters, only three in the 
100-meter low hurdles and only four teams bettered the qualifying standard in 
the men's 1,600-meter relay. As a result, the NCAA Division II Track and Field 
subcommittee, headed by UC Riverside Coach Chris Rinne, had to come up with a 
last-minute solution to increase the fields in those events to a minimum of 
five entrants. 
</P>
<P>
Not wanting to contest a final with only two, three or four entrants -- the top 
eight finishers receive points on a 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 basis -- the subcommittee 
held qualifying races in those events among athletes who already had qualified 
for the Division II meet in at least one other event. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a Band-Aid solution at best," Rinne said. "It was an attempt to get 
through this year with the least amount of pain as possible. But something has 
to change next year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ridiculous to have a Division II championship with only five entries in 
an event. You should have at least eight entries in each event as the top eight 
finishers score points." 
</P>
<P>
One possible solution is for the NCAA to keep a list of not only Division II 
qualifiers but a priority list of leading non-qualifiers. 
</P>
<P>
That way, if an event has a low number of qualified athletes at a specified 
date -- say, two or three weeks before the championships -- the standards could 
be changed to increase the size of the field. 
</P>
<P>
The Division II indoor meet has used that method in recent years and it is time 
the outdoor meet did likewise, according to Rinne. 
</P>
<P>
"The standards are designed to keep the meet at a championship level," Rinne 
said. "But you don't want them to be so strict that only two or three athletes 
are participating in a particular event. It's not competition when that 
happens. And competition is what this meet is all about."

JACK SMITH: WHEN TEENS ESSAY TO WRITE ABOUT VALUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We keep hearing that our teen-agers don't read and can't write, and there is 
abundant evidence to support that dismal notion. 
</P>
<P>
There is also evidence to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
I was recently asked by Rabbi Alfred Wolf to be one of three judges of a high 
school essay contest. As Rabbi Wolf is my spiritual adviser, I agreed, though I 
hate judging anything. I have judged beauty contests and seen the tears of the 
losers. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Wolf, now retired as rabbi of the Wilshire Temple, is director of the 
Skirball Institute on American Values, and the theme of the contest was 
American values. The students were asked to select an American value, document 
it historically, and relate it to their lives. 
</P>
<P>
There were two contests: one for Catholic schools, one for Los Angeles district 
schools. I received copies of the six finalists in each group. Some unheralded 
teachers had done the preliminary judging. My fellow judges, I had learned, 
were Tritia Toyota and Irving Stone. I tried not to think what they would 
decide. 
</P>
<P>
The first essay I read was by Joel G. Aldape of Huntington Park High School. I 
was amazed. Its grammar was impeccable. Its argument was logical and forceful. 
His theme was the Puritan ethic. He concluded that he believed the Puritan 
ethic had built America. One striking line was that the Puritans had thought 
their ideas would bring them closer to God. Today, he suggested, we think the 
Puritan ethic will bring us closer to success. 
</P>
<P>
We were supposed to judge each essay in various categories on a scale of 1 to 
10. I gave Aldape 9 or 10 in every category. Then I read the next essay. It, 
too, was grammatically neat, well-reasoned, and persuasive. I realized that if 
I gave the writer the same ratings, neither would win. I went back and took a 
few points away from Aldape. 
</P>
<P>
I hated it. In the end, I gave almost every contestant a good grade. An essay 
is a private thing. How can you judge one against another? I hoped that my 
fellow judges would be more decisive than I was. 
</P>
<P>
The awards were to be given at 4 p.m. at Lawry's California Center, an oasis 
north of Dodger Stadium and the railroad tracks. It is a lovely place, replete 
with patios and fountains and gorgeous California flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the ceremony coincided with one of the rather common natural 
catastrophes on Mt. Washington, where I live, a mile from the Lawry's center. 
As I was driving down the hill to the Skirball meeting, I noticed a plume of 
white smoke rising from a nearby canyon. I knew I ought to stop and call the 
fire department. But I also knew that someone else would surely do that. We on 
Mt. Washington are all alert to fires. 
</P>
<P>
When Rabbi Wolf began the ceremonies, shortly after 4 o'clock, his remarks were 
accompanied by the kind of sounds that only a metropolis can produce. Freight 
trains rumbled by, grinding and whistling. We were suddenly assaulted by the 
clatter of helicopters, one after another. Then came the roar of fire engines 
and the scream of sirens. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Wolf carried on imperturbably, despite the noise. Msgr. Aidan Carroll, 
representing the Catholic schools, spoke with great charm, ignoring the clamor. 
His aplomb, in fact, almost converted me to the faith. 
</P>
<P>
The two grand prize winners were asked to read their essays. They did so with 
calm and poise. The winner in the Los Angeles district division was the young 
man who wrote about the Puritan ethic. Robert M. Bautista of Bishop Amat was 
first in the Catholic schools. 
</P>
<P>
While Aldape was reading his essay, a train went by, grinding and clanging, 
</P>
<P>
Helicopters chattered overhead; a fire engine roared by, siren shrilling. Young 
Aldape continued with his essay, which, after all, was about freedom of speech, 
but when the center's chimes began to stroke the hour of 5 he gave up. With 
great patience, he waited out the bells. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Wolf had asked me to say a few words in conclusion. I could only say that 
writing an essay was probably the most important thing a student could do. I 
said, as I believe, that one does not think until one has expressed his 
thoughts in writing. I thank God I finished before the chimes stroked 6.

 DAVID NELSON / SOCIETY: STAR OF INDIA SHINES IN BIG EVENT AT SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Nelson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Star of India docked at the Embarcadero late Sunday afternoon to a chorus 
of boat sirens -- shrill whistles, deep bass blasts and warbling toots -- that 
made the corner of San Diego Bay sound like a seagoing barnyard in full cry. 
</P>
<P>
The historic, iron-hulled tall ship, launched 125 years ago at Ramsey on the 
Isle of Man and a veteran of 21 circumnavigations of the globe under sail, 
returned to the dock with 65 volunteer crewmen and 85 pooped passengers on 
deck, among them honorary sailing master Walter Cronkite, the anchorman 
emeritus of American newscasters. More than 2,000 spectators onshore waved, 
whooped and whistled as the passengers, many with faces reddened by a day of 
sun and wind, reluctantly prepared to troop down the gangway. 
</P>
<P>
A smaller, quieter crowd had assembled that morning to wish the Star good speed 
when it embarked on its first voyage since 1986. The cruise marked only the 
fourth time the ship had braved the seas since it arrived in San Diego in 1927, 
then a rusting relic of its former glory, as the founding vessel of what would 
become the San Diego Maritime Museum. 
</P>
<P>
At 9:30 a.m. the crew scrambled to its posts and the passengers scrambled out 
of the way when sailing master Capt. Carl G. Bowman, the 81-year-old former 
commanding officer of the U. S. Coast Guard sailing ship Eagle and a recognized 
master mariner, gave the order to cast off. Since its sails would remain furled 
until it neared open water, the Star glided along in the wake of the tugboat 
Palomar. 
</P>
<P>
A flotilla of sailing craft and power boats of every size, the first arrivals 
of what would grow into a small navy of vessels, waited in the bay and escorted 
the Star through the calm waters like a school of devoted and respectful pilot 
fish. And, to reinforce the sense of nostalgia under which the ship sailed, 
three squadrons of antique biplanes (some piloted by members of a group that 
calls itself "The Glue Angels") and World War II fighters flew over and saluted 
by waggling their wings against the lifting clouds. 
</P>
<P>
Cronkite, nattily nautical in white ducks and blue blazer, had said before the 
ship embarked that his title as honorary sailing master was exactly that, and 
that the Star would be "in perfectly safe hands, because I'm sure they won't 
let me do a darned thing aboard." Even so, he occasionally shared duties with 
helmsman Arthur DeFever, the maritime museum's board president, tugging down 
hard upon the giant wheel to keep the ship plowing steadily toward the exit 
from the bay. Squinting at a point ahead of the 255-foot Star and with a shy 
smile washing quickly over his lips, Cronkite said, "There's no more wonderful 
way to spend a Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Brian Bilbray, who heads the Sail America Task Force, 
renounced any latent desire to take the helm. "I only know how to handle boats 
with training wheels," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Prominently posted signs warned "no climbing in the rigging," which was an 
unnecessary caution to most passengers and did not apply to the crew, where the 
few putative Billy Budds aboard could be found. The crew was drawn from many 
walks of life and from as far away as Alaska; it included teachers, attorneys, 
accountants, a police officer and a professor of marine biology. The passenger 
list consisted of board members and longtime friends of the maritime museum, 
including Director Emeritus Joseph Jessop, the first commodore of the San Diego 
Yacht Club, who navigated the ship's steep ladders and occasionally pitching 
decks much more nimbly than most. 
</P>
<P>
The passenger list also included a party of five from the Isle of Man, led by 
loquacious Billy ("Don't Call Me Mister") Kneale, present owner of the Star 
Shipyard from which the ship, originally known as the Euterpe, was launched. 
Speaking in the rough but lilting accents of the small island off the southern 
coast of England, Kneale praised San Diego for maintaining the Star as the 
dowager of the high seas. 
</P>
<P>
"There are only 45,000 Manxmen (as residents of the Isle of Man are known), and 
we couldn't muster the crew to sail this beautiful ship," said Kneale. "You 
people are lucky to have such a capacity of talent here." The shipyard 
proprietor later presented Bowman a check for $2,000 as his gift to the museum. 
(That times change even in quiet, traditional-seeming corners of the world was 
illustrated when Andrea Naylor, a member of the Kneale party, refered to 
herself as a "Manxperson.") 
</P>
<P>
Bowman's order to unfurl the sails sent the crew clambering to dizzying heights 
above the deck. As the canvas dropped and filled with wind, the passengers 
received their first sense of what it must have been like to cruise aboard the 
Star for the seemingly endless months required for a passage to India or 
Australia, the ship's main destinations in its glory days. 
</P>
<P>
As it pointed toward the mists looming far off shore, the Star did seem to be 
sailing into the mid-19th Century, its holds laden with tea and jute -- but 
several passengers remarked that, as romantic as the vision was, they would 
prefer to arrive in Calcutta via jumbo jet. Although the chop was relatively 
light, the ship pitched and yawed just enough to offer the imagination a hint 
of what blustering through a gale in the "Roaring Forties," the stormy 
latitudes in the Southern Ocean, must have been like. 
</P>
<P>
Breasting into the open Pacific and slicing through the swells under sail, the 
Star coasted first up Point Loma and then changed course for a run down 
Coronado and the Silver Strand. The ship mostly moseyed along at 3 knots, a 
snail's pace that illustrated a drawback of sail power but allowed passengers 
and crew a respite in which to climb below-decks for a midday collation of tuna 
salad sandwiches and soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
No matter in which direction the figurehead of Euterpe (the Greek Muse of music 
and lyric poetry whom Homer invoked and to whom Odysseus and Leopold Bloom owe 
debts) pointed over the sea, it swept across a vista of millionaires' yachts, 
sleek sailboats and even a few tiny, inflated rubber Zodiac boats. Coast Guard 
patrol boats raced to keep interlopers at a safe distance, but the Star was 
buzzed off Point Loma by a pair of men on jet skis who, like Hells Angels of 
the waves, gave the ship a competitive appraisal before streaking off through 
the chop. The spectators had one advantage over the Star's passengers and crew 
-- only they could see the proprietary, winged majesty with which it coasted 
through the seas off its home port. 
</P>
<P>
Cronkite remained the star of the show through the rest of the sail and during 
the reception that followed aboard the ferryboat Berkeley, the Star's sister 
ship. Modest and obliging to the last, the newsman signed autographs by the 
score, chatted amiably about the joys of sailing and participated in the formal 
ceremonies, which were emceed by Channel 10's Bill Griffith and dedicated to 
the presentation of coveted sailing certificates to the red-shirted crew. 
</P>
<P>
The evening ended with with a toast -- drunk in rum by nautical tradition -- 
led by crew member Dennis Hemingway, who at other times specializes in nuclear 
medicine. Among those drinking the health of crew, ship and passengers were Kay 
and Paul Black, Laurie and Dick Blackington, Councilwoman Gloria McColl, Dick 
Ford, Rachel and Judson Grosvenor, Vangie and Dick Burt, Norma Day, Bridget and 
Alan Pitcairn, Ken Rearwin, Peggy and Milt Stratford, and Jordine Von Wontoch. 
</P>
<P>
CORONADO -- The 17 debutantes presented at the 28th annual La Jolla Debutante 
Ball made their maiden voyages into high society Saturday on the stage and 
dance floor of the Hotel del Coronado's Grand Ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
Four hundred relatives and guests turned out to offer their smiling approval as 
the young women, nosegays of pink roses poised just so, curtsied to the crowd 
and strolled the perimeter of the floor on their beaming fathers' or escorts' 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
Ball chairman Kay Allman said the purpose of the ball is not only to raise 
funds, which are devoted exclusively to childrens' charities, but to educate 
young women in the obligation of community service. 
</P>
<P>
"We organize this program for the girls to introduce them to the community 
responsibilities of raising funds for charities and helping the less 
fortunate," said Allman. 
</P>
<P>
Debutante chairman Anne Rifat said the process, which runs six months from the 
naming of the debs to the ball, does show results. 
</P>
<P>
"The girls have very definitely grown since December," Rifat said. "There's a 
sense of maturing in them. They started out frightened, not knowing what to 
expect, but they became young women." 
</P>
<P>
Debutante Kate McCarty, daughter of Deputy Mayor Judy McCarty, agreed that the 
experience had been useful. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned how to handle myself in formal situations that most teen-age 
girls don't get to experience these days," she said, adding, "I've also made 
some very good friends." 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Roberts, daughter of Councilman Ron Roberts, also said she had learned. 
"I'd do it all over again. I met a lot of fun people, and we learned 
etiquette." 
</P>
<P>
The young women also learned the correct steps and etiquette of ballroom 
dancing under the direction of Peter Gregg Benjamin, successor to his father, 
dance master emeritus Donald Benjamin. There has yet to be a La Jolla Debutante 
Ball given without the assistance of a Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
Taking their bows Saturday were Deborah Appel, Christina Bieler, Anne Casey, 
Nancy Dickerson, Nichole Epp, Darcy Fontana, Victoria Harris, Julie Jacques, 
Lauren Keyser, Michalyn King, April Prohaska, Deanna Robbins, Stacy 
Steineckert, Elizabeth Suckling and Tara Lee Walsh.

 DIRK SUTRO / ARCHITECTURE: ARCHITECTS SEEK ALL KINDS OF 'FELLOWS' 
</P>

<P>
Every so often, you run into an architect who uses the letters FAIA after his 
name. This means he's a "fellow" in the American Institute of Architects. 
</P>
<P>
Who are these AIA fellows? How to they get to be one? 
</P>
<P>
Is the honor a recognition of significant contributions to the field, or a pat 
on the back from an organization known for its old-boy networking? 
</P>
<P>
San Diego has about a dozen AIA fellows among the local chapter's nearly 700 
state-licensed members. They are Richard Bundy, Ward Deems, Homer Delawie, 
Harry Hallenbeck, Frank Hope Jr., William Lewis, Robert Mosher, Dale Naegle, 
Harold Sadler, Thomas Tucker, William Watson and Stan Livingston. 
</P>
<P>
While many of these architects have made significant design contributions over 
long careers, others are better-known for their work in AIA activities and 
political offices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Become a Fellow 
</P>
<P>
Achievement in design isn't the only way to become a fellow. Several other 
categories include innovative construction methods, writing books or articles, 
educational work, service to the profession, public service, historic 
preservation, research, urban design, achievement in government and industry, 
and skill in running a practice. 
</P>
<P>
Just last month, for example, architect Ed Huxley was made a fellow, primarily 
because he founded the AIA's Monterey Design Conference in 1979. Unfortunately, 
Huxley, who moved to Canada not long ago after a lengthy career in San Diego, 
died in a plane crash on his way to the induction ceremony in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
The Monterey Design Conference has become an annual highlight on many 
architects' calendars, one of the few West Coast events where important 
architectural issues are addressed in thoughtful and innovative ways. 
</P>
<P>
Potential fellows are nominated by a local AIA committee, and selected by a 
seven-member national jury, all AIA fellows. 
</P>
<P>
For 1989, Huxley was the only new fellow from San Diego among 44 named 
throughout the United States. Architect Paul Buss, a founder of the San Diego 
firm BSHA, was also up for the honor. Buss, a past AIA president, now a 
developer with Oliver McMillan in San Diego, is known at least as well for his 
politics as his designs. He's had a prominent role in Mayor Maureen O'Connor's 
Centre City planning committee. By some accounts, he lobbied hard for his own 
nomination before he finally received it. 
</P>
<P>
Next year's nominees have just been notified by the local AIA chapter. They are 
Rob Quigley, an award-winning designer who's also had a hand in many community 
planning efforts; Doug Austin, a partner in Austin Hansen Fehlman Group, known 
for his design work, leadership role in the AIA (he is a past president) and 
the success of the firm he helped start; and Michael Wilkes, a partner in 
Delawie Bretton and Wilkes, known both for his design work and for his AIA 
leadership role -- he too is a past president. 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN NOTES:

San Diego Union architecture critic Kay Kaiser has just finished writing a book 
on "The Architecture of Gunnar Birkerts," due for fall release.

<P>
Mrs. P. Henry of Huntington Park needs to find a plastic or cloth cover, 
preferably in green or gold, for a four-slice toaster that measures 11x9x6 1/2 
inches. Can you help and be the toast of the Henry household, or will she take 
a slow burn after taking a lot of heat for airing such a crummy request? 
</P>
<P>
Liz Gallett of Ontario wonders where she can find sour pickles similar to those 
that Del Monte used to make (but evidently doesn't any more). Can you help 
Gallett out of this particular pickle before she gets a sour taste in her 
mouth, or will she have to continue racking her brine for something else to 
spice up her life? 
</P>

For the several women looking for Magic Lady panties, we have a number of 
mentionable sources. Pauline Samuels of Pauline's Girdle and Lingerie Shop, 
8815 W. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles, says she carries them in many sizes (she also 
has difficult-to-find bras and girdles); Shirlie B. Ravich of Culver City also 
suggested Pauline's. Betty Fahrenbach of Morro Bay says Old Pueblo Traders, 
3740 E. 34th St., Tucson, Ariz. 85726-7800, lists Magic Lady in its catalogue 
at $12.50 each. 
</P>
<P>
Rosabelle Gunefson of San Diego says an item called Fully, which she says is 
quite similar to Magic Lady, is made by Exquisite Form Industries, Pelham 
Manor, N.Y. 10803. And Mae Johnson of Los Angeles says her sister gets Magic 
Lady from Kraus Department Stores, 1201 Canal St. (at Basin Street), in New 
Orleans.

YOUR COINS: QUARTER EAGLE HAS A FLOCK OF ADMIRERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I have a United States gold $2 1/2 coin dated 1926. It appears to be 
in excellent condition, with an Indian on one side and an eagle on the other. I 
would appreciate knowing its value. -- S.K. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: United States gold coins traditionally are called eagles by collectors. 
The $20 piece is a double eagle, the $10 is an eagle, the $5 a half eagle and 
the $2 1/2 a quarter eagle. Quarter eagles are interesting because of the odd 
denomination and also because they've had a long numismatic run -- from 1796 to 
1929. A hobbyist could easily spend a lifetime pursuing this interesting piece. 
Early dates are especially elusive and expensive. 
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the reason for the $2 1/2 gold piece was to have a 
denomination between the silver dollar and the $5 half eagle. Because of its 
longevity, the quarter eagle has undergone many design changes, everything from 
the capped bust to the capped head to the classic head to the coronet type to 
the Indian head design. There are also many varieties and mints represented in 
this series. 
</P>
<P>
Your 1926 $2 1/2 is an Indian head type that was produced intermittently from 
1908 to 1929, the last year of issue. There were 446,000 quarter eagles minted 
in 1926 and unless your coin is a gem or a high-grade uncirculated piece, it's 
probably worth about $150 to $300. 
</P>

SWIM SCHOOLS CAN TURN YOUR KID INTO A FISH

<TEXT>
<P>
Have you noticed your 2-year-old begging you to extend the bath time? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it's time for swimming lessons. 
</P>
<P>
Swim schools flourish in the San Fernando Valley, where summertime temperatures 
often are 25 degrees higher than in other parts of Los Angeles. Many schools 
have parent-child programs that will introduce an infant or small child to the 
joys of water with the parent's help. 
</P>
<P>
"Avoid swim schools that use scare tactics," advises Rebecca McCain, aquatic 
and youth specialist for the Los Angeles Chapter of the American Red Cross. She 
emphasizes that children should never be pressured when learning to swim. 
</P>
<P>
McCain cautions parents to avoid schools that guarantee to "waterproof" a child 
within a definite time period. "If you find your child is not enjoying it, take 
them out, they're not ready," McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Red Cross-Certified 
</P>
<P>
Swim schools are not required to hire certified instructors, but McCain 
recommends choosing those with Red Cross-certified instructors on board. 
</P>
<P>
Following is a list of area swim schools. Parents who are shopping around for 
the right school may observe lessons at all locations. 
</P>
<P>
Lucile Cowle's Swim School in Burbank specializes in teaching children who fear 
water, and thus have facilities geared to that group. One of the school's two 
heated indoor pools is just 3 1/2 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
Three instructors are certified to teach disabled children. 
</P>
<P>
"When kids fall into a pool, they see a far wall and think that's the wall they 
have to swim to," said Stephanie Nelson, school co-owner. "We teach young 
children to turn around and swim back to the nearest wall." 
</P>
<P>
For children aged 6 months to 5 years, 10 quarter-hour private lessons are 
offered for $82. For youngsters 6 and over and adults, 10 half-hour lessons

 Jed Heller's Home Pool Instruction has taught swimming at students' home pools 
for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
All 15 instructors are Red Cross-certified and instruct children as young as 3 
months. "We use a very gentle approach," said owner Jed Heller, who has taught 
swimming for 25 years and holds a master's degree in child development 
psychology and physical education. "There is no forcing, no dunking and no 
surprises." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Series of 10 Lessons 
</P>
<P>
Heller offers a series of 10 lessons: 15-, 20- and 30-minute classes, which

</P>
<P>
Private, Group Lessons 
</P>

lessons. Group lessons cost from $61 to $70 for nine half-hour lessons, 
depending on the number of children in the group. 
</P>
<P>
"I put an emphasis on instructors who have a strong swimming background," said 
owner Iris Ryker, who coaches a U.S. swim team at her school. "I like to hire 
instructors who have been trained in swimming from 7 or 8 years old. They have 
patience and dedication." 
</P>
<P>
Ryker's school, which opened in 1986, instructs year-round and is open from 9

WHEN LIFE GETS DULL, THE MEN OF K TROOP GALLOP OFF INTO THE 19TH CENTURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE CHAWKINS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to recreating the life and times of a 19th Century cavalry unit, 
Pat Coen and the men of his K Troop don't horse around. 
</P>
<P>
One weekend a month, they gallop up hillsides with revolvers blazing, they 
practice fancy equine military maneuvers, they gnaw homemade hardtack -- "It's 
kind of like a hard, thick matzo," Coen says -- and they generally give their 
all to ensure the Republic's manifest destiny. 
</P>
<P>
Then Coen goes back home to his wife and two daughters in Canoga Park, and his 
workaday gig as an RTD diesel mechanic. His 16 or so cohorts in K Troop return 
to their lives as machinists, technicians, engineers. For another month, 
settlers go unprotected, marauders go unchecked, and sunsets go unridden into. 
It's not a perfect system, but as Coen and company have learned in exhaustive 
detail, the Army never was. 
</P>
<P>
"You get an idea of what it was really like 100 years ago," says K Troop 
stalwart Bruce Taylor, a Simi Valley plumber who hauls an 1885 saddle, a 
working 1873 Colt .45 and assorted century-old memorabilia on K Troop 
maneuvers. "It was a rough life." 
</P>
<P>
On occasional "encampments" with other ersatz cavalry units in the Arizona 
desert, the men trudge around in regulation blue woolen uniforms and heavy 
boots that stop a regulation one inch below the knee. "Apaches" wear war paint 
in authentic patterns, made from the very roots and flowers the Indians used. 
Everybody yells a lot, shoots blanks at the enemy -- "It's a search-and-destroy 
kind of thing," Taylor explains -- and flirts with heatstroke. 
</P>
<P>
"You eat period food -- beef jerky, salt pork, if you're lucky a can of 
peaches," he says. "You sleep in an 1880s cavalry tent with nothing under you 
but a bedroll. After a weekend in the 100-degree heat wearing those wool 
uniforms, you're glad to get back to civilization." 
</P>
<P>
Their counterparts 100 years ago had no such choice. 
</P>
<P>
For decades after the Civil War, the cavalry was a haven for the unemployed, 
the illiterate, the desperate, according to contemporary accounts. Nearly half 
the troops were foreign-born. Quarters were cramped and the food was wretched. 
For years, no ammunition was available for practice. Pay was $13 a month. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of the enlisted men in the Army are simply human driftwood, men 
who have committed crimes elsewhere and are hiding in the service under assumed 
names; men who cannot brook the liberties and familiarities of society, and 
take refuge in military discipline; men who are disappointed, disheartened and 
ambitionless, and find the lazy life of a soldier a relief," a Chicago 
newspaper reporter wrote in 1874. 
</P>
<P>
Coen, a mountain of a man who grew up on a Kansas farm, was first hooked by the 
Hollywood version of the cavalry, the square-jawed lieutenant sitting erect on 
his steed as he scans the ridge top for a row of feathers. The rest, he found 
out, is history. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 7, I can remember thinking how great it would be to be in the 
cavalry," he says. "I grew up with Rin Tin Tin and John Wayne movies." 
</P>
<P>
His fascination with history kept growing, and, at the age of 19, he signed on 
with a Civil War unit. Then, as hobbyists swarmed into the War Between the 
States, Cohen forged ahead, concentrating on the less voguish Indian Wars. 
After research in military archives and Western libraries, he formed K Troop of 
the First Cavalry, one of about a half-dozen groups in the Los Angeles area 
that model themselves on old cavalry units. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't hear much about the First Cav," he says. "We don't get much notice. 
All the attention is focused on the Seventh, which was wiped out at Little Big 
Horn." 
</P>
<P>
Bivouacked throughout the West, K Troop took its share of lumps as well. It 
swept into California with Gen. Stephen Watts Kearny in the Mexican War, but 
was routed at the Battle of San Pascual, an engagement described by historian 
James M. Merrill as "unnecessary, poorly conceived, badly executed." In 
addition to countless Indian skirmishes, the troop suppressed poachers at 
Yellowstone National Park, and took part in an ill-fated effort to introduce 
camels to the West. 
</P>
<P>
If none of that matches Bull Run or Gettysburg for stirring the blood, it 
doesn't faze Coen. 
</P>
<P>
"The Civil War is a lot more popular," he acknowledges. "You want to do Civil 
War? You go out and get yourself a uniform and a rifle, and you do Civil War. 
This is a lot more difficult. For one thing, you need a horse." 
</P>
<P>
K Troop, which is seeking new recruits, usually mounts up at a stable in 
Newbury Park for its monthly drills, maneuvers drawn from cavalry training 
manuals of the 1870s and 1880s. 
</P>
<P>
To kick things off, Coen bellows, "Command march!" rather than the more 
inspirational but less historically correct, "Forward ho!" On patrol, the men 
ride four abreast, as prescribed in the drill manuals, not two-by-two, as in 
the movies. Their saddles sit on stitch-by-stitch replicas of the last known 
surviving cavalry horse blanket, a tattered 1885 shroud enshrined in a private 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keeping in Period 
</P>
<P>
"We try to be as historically accurate as is humanly possible," says Coen, who, 
along with his men, peppers his speech with period slang. A dishonorable 
discharge is a "bobtail"; four years of active duty are four years "up the 
pole." 
</P>
<P>
Campfire songs for Company K are all-but-forgotten Army ditties like "O'Reilly 
Was a Soldier" and "General Jake." Calls-to-arms are played by company 
trumpeter Mike Winters, a Van Nuys alarm repairman who has a collection of 
horns dating to the American Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the top troop musicians in the field," Coen says. 
</P>
<P>
The public rarely gets to see all this. From April through October, other 
outfits, including the Simi Valley-based Company A, strut their stuff at Fort 
Tejon State Historic Park near Bakersfield, but Company K generally shies from 
the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Exhibition 
</P>
<P>
During one of its infrequent exhibitions recently at the Big Sky Ranch in Simi 
Valley, a soldier in full gallop speared a cabbage that was affixed to a post. 
</P>
<P>
Another shot out some balloons. The whole troop charged up a steep hill. 
</P>
<P>
Coen gave a short talk, in which he professed "tremendous respect" for 
Geronimo, who eluded 5,000 U.S. cavalrymen and 4,000 Mexican soldiers for a 
year and a half until his capture in 1886. 
</P>
<P>
He makes no excuses for the epic mistreatment of Indian tribes at the cavalry's 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
"We were the first line of the administration," he says. "We were given the 
order to enforce the will of the government, and we weren't smart enough to 
ask, is this right or wrong? We had our job to do and we went out and did it."

STAGE REVIEW;

<P>
AN AMERICAN PRIMITIVE; 
</P>
<P>
LEACHMAN AS 'GRANDMA MOSES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Peppy old ladies can be a trial on the stage, and Cloris Leachman's Grandma 
Moses probably does get a bit too adorable at times. But in general she is the 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
It helps that we first see her before she got to be an institution. "Grandma 
Moses -- An American Primitive" (through Sunday at the Norris Theatre in Palos 
Verdes) even provides a flashback to her as a little girl. 
</P>
<P>
She is being boosted into a tree by her big brother (Peter Thoemke -- he also 
plays her father, husband, hired man and patron). She is sure that she's going 
to fall and get into trouble, but she is determined to see the view from the 
top. And once she does, she finds her balance. 
</P>
<P>
This hunger to measure the world is the ground-note in Leachman's performance, 
linking the little girl, the middle-aged farm wife and the old lady. At all 
points, she had the eye of an artist. "Now that," she'll say, eyeing a fabric 
sample, "is what I call a true red." It's as if she could taste it. 
</P>
<P>
Towards the end of the evening, she recommends a faith in "the unexpected." It 
certainly worked for her. Who would have thought that an 80-year-old woman 
would become a famous "primitive" painter? (She's not crazy about the 
adjective.) 
</P>
<P>
Still -- what I hadn't realized -- Anna Mary Roberston Moses had painted from 
her childhood. She just never had time to concentrate on it, what with the 
children (10, five dead in infancy) and the farm. Finally there was time and 
she got down to it. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Pouliot calls his script a play, but it's really a visit, sometimes 
rather contrived, with an interesting woman at two different stages of her 
life. In the first act, set in 1905, her husband (Thoemke catches his strength 
and his shyness) has decided that they're selling their Southern farm and 
moving back to the North -- a decision that almost takes the wind out of her 
sails. 
</P>
<P>
Leachman bustles around packing, and one can feel both the pressures of farm 
life and the pleasure that she and her husband still take in having their own 
place, after 15 years as a hired girl and hired man. We also observe the health 
of their marriage, which progressed from the liking stage to the loving stage, 
in the old-fashioned way. "I did develop quite a feeling for him," Leachman 
smiles, and that's all she needs to say about that. 
</P>
<P>
Act Two is the Grandma Moses we came to see. Still, there's a little gasp 
(there was on Tuesday night anyway) when this old 
</P>
<P>
lady in an apron comes out. Just as with the flashback to the little girl 
balancing in the tree, Leachman masters the physical image so well that the 
viewer feels what it might be like to live 
</P>
<P>
in this body -- the step firm, but planned out, as is necessary at 85. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than "indicating" old age, Leachman imagines old age, and therefore 
avoids its cliches. For instance, although Grandma doesn't appreciate having 
had to slow down -- this was a woman who rather enjoyed being run off her feet 
-- she takes full advantage of the authority that comes with age. 
</P>
<P>
In her interviews with Dr. Otto Kallir, her patron, she makes him play to her 
tempo. And some of his suggestions about her work are greeted with a 
significant silence. It is pleasant to be famous, but painting is still 
something she does for her own pleasure, and if she prefers to paint on 
Masonite than canvas, well, that's her process. 
</P>
<P>
"Be cautious about strangers," she warns her would-be mentor, and it's the 
nicest possible way of reminding him that he's not in her heart of hearts, just 
yet. Leachman's Grandma Moses has been around too long to be awed by anybody, 
yet maintains her taste for birthday cake, and it's a combination to enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
The evening's problems come with the territory of the one or two-person show. 
Too much exposition, too many props. Too much recorded music, too, for my 
taste; and the slides of Grandma Moses's paintings look faded. No matter. Her 
independence, her intelligence and her strength come through. 
</P>
<P>
 Plays Tuesday-Thursday at 8 p.m., Friday-Saturday at 8:30 p.m. and Sunday at 
2:30 and 7 p.m. Closes Sunday. Tickets $19- $25. Crossfield Drive at Indian

There's going to be a soft touch connected to picking up a copy of the 50th 
anniversary edition of "The Wizard of Oz" videocassette when it's released in 
August. Through a sponsorship agreement between MGM/UA Home Video and Downy 
Fabric Softner, customers can get a $5 rebate coupon that will drop the 
suggested price of "Oz" from $24.95 to $19.95. The limited release of the video 
will be accompanied by an $8.5-million promotional campaign, including a 
30-second TV spot showing a girl entering "Oz" where the citizens sing about 
Downy to the tune of "Merry Old Land of Oz." There also will be a 90-second 
Downy message at the beginning of the cassette, where a girl rounds up 
neighborhood friends for a back-yard production of "The Wizard of Oz" and 
gathers the costumes from her family's "Downy-fresh" laundry basket. Promotions 
aside, the 50th anniversary edition of "The Wizard of Oz" will contain 17 
minutes of footage not seen in the film or in the previously released "Wizard 
of Oz" videocassette. The extra footage includes Ray Bolger's scarecrow dance 
and a "jitterbug" dance rehearsal, both cut from the film, Buddy Ebsen 
performing "If I Only Had a Heart," Judy Garland receiving her Oscar and the 
film's original theatrical promotional trailer. ALEENE MacMINN

Attorneys for KFI-AM (640) filed an appeal Wednesday contesting U.S. District 
Court Judge Richard A. Gadbois' May 4 ruling enjoining the radio station from 
using the term "talk radio" in conjunction with its call letters pending a 
trial on the matter. KABC-AM (790) filed suit against KFI April 3, alleging 
that the slogan "talk radio" had been its trademark for 17 years. KFI has 
argued that the term is a generic one that describes a programming format and, 
therefore, its use cannot be a trademark infringement. The case will go to 
trial later this year. ALEENE MacMINN

ROCK LOVER LARRY CORYELL EXPLORES VAGARIES OF JAZZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Through his early work with drummer Chico Hamilton, jazz-rock group Free 
Spirits and vibist Gary Burton, Texas-born guitarist Larry Coryell emerged as 
one of the most original improvisers in jazz during the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
At the Catalina Bar and Grill on Tuesday night, Coryell, who has consistently 
been at odds with the predictable during his eclectic career, offered a 
distortion-free set of standards that verily swung from note one. 
</P>
<P>
"The intimacy of the club demands standards," the 46-year-old guitarist said 
after his opening set. "I mean, you can't play rock 'n' roll in here." 
</P>
<P>
Though smiling at the observation by his son, Julian, that he "got pretty 
raunchy" during a closing blues, Coryell nonetheless seemed pleased with having 
spent the previous hour exploring the vagaries of jazz -- that music closest to 
his rock-loving soul. 
</P>
<P>
Admiring as he might be of Jimi Hendrix's artistry and Eric Clapton's 
musicality, Coryell found sufficient expression in the tradition of John 
Coltrane's "Moment's Notice," an opening number that fairly bristled with 
boppish excitement. A unique blend of strummed chords and plucked lines showed 
Coryell to be a player of virtuosic technique with a deep sense of melodic 
invention. 
</P>
<P>
That same musicality was evident in "All the Things You Are" and the bop 
classic "Just Friends." In both cases, bassist Brian Torff and drummer Cindy 
Blackman lent substantiative rhythmic support, with Torff offering splendid 
solo outings on his Banchetti electric bass. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Stanley Cowell had ample solo opportunities and showed himself to be a 
marvelously supportive player throughout the opening set. As a composer, his 
"Equipoise" was a beautiful offering that evolved neatly from its ballad 
beginnings to a Latin-tinged cooker. 
</P>
<P>
Coryell's solo offering of the evening was an enthusiastic reading of George 
Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue." In it, the guitarist, who works the Hollywood 
nightery through Sunday, displayed the multiple musical influences -- jazz, 
rock, Latin -- that have created his unique musical identity. A. JAMES LISKA

KENNY COLMAN BRINGS DRAMATIC BALLAD TO FORTE'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By LEONARD FEATHER

<TEXT>
<P>
When Frank Sinatra calls an album "glorious" and adds that "the singing is in 
the tradition of Tony Bennett, Bing Crosby and myself," you know that a visit 
with the singer in question must pay some substantial dividends. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Colman, who recently earned that rare endorsement, opened Tuesday at 
Forte's, an Italian restaurant in Encino, where he had a successful engagement 
a couple of years ago. Unlike the record (not yet released) on which he is 
backed by part of the London Philharmonic, the club has provided him with only 
a quartet for company. Even under these conditions it does not take long to 
recognize that what this Canadian visitor offers is too seldom heard on the 
pop-music scene today. 
</P>
<P>
Colman likes to call himself the last of the saloon singers. This holds true in 
terms of his choice of material and his strong, true sound in the classic-pop 
genre. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's show began with "The Good Life" and "Just Friends," both at a bright 
tempo and leaving no doubt that Colman was in great voice. The problem was, so 
was the audience. When word gets around to his regular following, who in due 
course may replace the talkers and the dancers, conditions should be much 
easier for him. 
</P>
<P>
Colman's long suit is the dramatic ballad, to which he applies his full reserve 
of vocal strength and emotional power. "When Joanna Loved Me," a superb song by 
Jack Segal and Bob Wells, remains one of the most moving items in his 
repertoire. The Placido Domingo hit "I Couldn't Live Without You for a Day" 
made a similarly compelling impact. 
</P>
<P>
With Steve Donovan on keyboards, Sammy Dee on tenor sax, Sinclair Lott on drums 
and Jeff Falkner on bass, Colman worked his way from a slightly nervous opening 
to a potent finale. He will be off Sunday and Monday, returning for another 
five-night stand and closing June 10. LEONARD FEATHER

<P>
A VALIANT EFFORT IN 'CASTLES MADE OF SAND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whatever conclusions can be drawn from Joanne Gordon's environmental staging of 
Robert Villanueva's play, "Castles Made of Sand," it gets an E for Effort. Set 
inside the Cal State L. A. gym and cast with the school's drama students, 
professionals and inner city youths, Gordon's production valiantly tries for 
the kind of group rite that the Living Theatre attempted 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Villanueva has written a boxing saga set to Jimi Hendrix's music -- indeed, 
meant to retell Hendrix's life through the framework of sports -- yet many in 
this production were born after the nonpareil rock guitarist died of a drug 
overdose in 1970. "Castles Made of Sand" proves that the '60s live on. 
</P>
<P>
It also proves that any staging, environmental or no, still needs a play to 
hang on, or it drifts. From the beginning, production effects threaten to 
overwhelm the play. There are the speakers and the well-amped band led by 
guitarist Robert Lindauer -- yet many voices, despite miking, are hard to make 
out. Various staging areas surround a boxing ring, and there is a large video 
projection screen overhead. Is the play going to be able to keep up with the 
spectacle? 
</P>
<P>
Later, the concern is if there is a play here at all. Once you ooh and aah at 
Jim Bell's lights, sound and set pieces, get out of your seat and follow the 
action around the floor, you notice that Villanueva's language and situations 
have no knock-out punch. The two conceits used to frame the play -- Greek 
tragedy's arc of inevitability, and Hendrix's lyrics -- become less helpful as 
boxer Axis Castillo's fame implodes from an excess of exposure, drugs and sex. 
</P>
<P>
Villanueva plays Axis (the name comes from Hendrix's record "Axis: Bold As 
Love"), and gives him just enough emotional grounding to justify our attention. 
But there is nothing distinctive about Axis. He travels the predictable route 
from street kid to punk boxer to wunderkind to champ. Only two aspects 
distinguish this tale from countless boxing movies from the '40s and '50s: the 
cloud of electronic media that descends on Axis, and a life drenched in sex. 
</P>
<P>
The media dimension is carried by Bill Shick as an ultra-cynical TV commentator 
named Charlie Shead, who first builds Axis up into a star and then indulges in 
gossipy character assassinations on the video big screen as Axis' career 
plummets. The initial effect works; then, like most TV, it wears thin. 
</P>
<P>
So does the sex, which is done with ribald abandon. Elizabeth Stinson as Axis' 
girlfriend does more cavorting and strip-teasing than singing or acting, and an 
entourage of skimpily clad groupies complete a kind of male fantasy gone wild. 
The eroticism and Gordon's sense of humor are matched once with great 
athleticism, when Axis and the groupies have an orgy on a huge trampoline. 
(Suffice to say, this is no show for kids.) 
</P>
<P>
Fitting the Hendrix songs to the material is a trick not always pulled off. A 
manager asks the ambitious Axis, "Are You Experienced?" Later, Axis sings about 
his "Purple Haze" before collapsing. But using "Manic Depression" for a key 
sub-plot and "Little Wing" as a crude image of lost innocence is too strained. 
The singing lacks Hendrix's sinewy presence, but the score may get the college 
crowd curious about the acid rock master. 
</P>

 At 5151 State University Dr., on Friday and Saturday, 8 p.m., Sunday, 2:30 
p.m. Ends Sunday. Tickets: $2-$6; (213) 343-4118.

STAGE WATCH : TWO NEW PLAYS PART OF SCR'S '88-89 SEASON; TALKS WITH DIRECTORS, 
CHOREOGRAPHERS END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY and JAN HERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Coast Repertory's 1989-90 season will include at least two brand-new 
plays, one American premiere and one Southern California premiere, artistic 
director Martin Benson has announced. 
</P>
<P>
The first productions of Howard Korder's "Search and Destroy" and Richard 
Hellesen's "Once in Arden" and the first Southern California staging of Hugh 
Whitemore's "Breaking the Code" will be on South Coast's main stage. 
</P>
<P>
On the Second Stage, South Coast will produce the American premiere of Sharman 
MacDonald's "When I Was a Girl, I Used to Scream and Shout" and the previously 
reported "Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune" by Terrence McNally. 
</P>
<P>
Only five of next season's 11 offerings -- and no dates -- were announced. A 
theater spokesman said the rest of the season should be firm within a month. 
"We're attempting to give subscribers whatever we can," he said. The theater's 
annual subscription campaign has just begun. 
</P>
<P>
Three productions for the 507-seat Mainstage and three for the 161-seat Second 
Stage have yet to be decided. For the Mainstage, Benson and producing artistic 
director David Emmes are considering Moliere's "The Miser," Noel Coward's 
"Design for Living," Bertolt Brecht's "Mother Courage" and, more remotely, Alan 
Ayckbourn's "Woman in Mind." 
</P>
<P>
"There are other possibilities as well," Benson said, but he declined to 
disclose them. 
</P>
<P>
Korder's "Search and Destroy," which was commissioned by SCR, is about a 
Florida businessman who encounters tax troubles and decides to seek meaning in 
his life. It was read at SCR earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Once in Arden" is the first script by an Orange County resident to win a berth 
on a South Coast subscription season since 1973. Hellesen lives in Fullerton 
and teaches at Cal State Fullerton. His play is about Polish-born Helena 
Modjeska, the renowned Shakespearean actress who retired to Orange County 
around the turn of the century after touring the country for three decades. The 
play received a staged reading, starring Nan Martin, earlier this month at 
SCR's California Play Festival. 
</P>
<P>
"Breaking the Code" chronicles the life of Alan Turing, the British 
mathematician who helped decide the outcome of World War II by cracking the 
German secret code "Enigma." It opened in London in 1986 and on Broadway in 
1987, both times starring Derek Jacobi. 
</P>
<P>
"When I Was a Girl . . . ," a Scottish play, takes place at the beach and tells 
the story of a mother-daughter relationship. It opened in London in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune" will be a vehicle for two SCR 
veteran players, Richard Doyle and Karen Hensel. It was on the Mark Taper Forum 
season last fall. 
</P>
<P>
DIRECTORS MAY WALK: The Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers (SSDC) 
has broken off contract negotiations with the League of Resident Theatres 
(LORT). LORT's final proposal, judged unacceptable by union officials, will be 
voted on at an SSDC membership meeting in New York June 12. 
</P>
<P>
If the offer is rejected, the union's members nationwide will be directed not 
to work at the 67 theaters that belong to LORT -- which include the Mark Taper 
Forum, South Coast Repertory, the Old Globe and La Jolla Playhouse. However, 
the union's executive board voted Tuesday to allow work to continue on any 
productions that have begun rehearsals by June 12. 
</P>
<P>
Most Southern California LORT members would not be immediately affected by an 
exodus of SSDC directors. 
</P>
<P>
The Taper's summer production, "Temptation," went into rehearsals Tuesday. 
South Coast's next production, "Sunday in the Park With George," opens next 
week. However, South Coast's Benson said an SSDC walkout could alter the 
theater's choice of its opening play for next season: "The only thing that will 
affect us is the timing, in other words which directors we can approach first 
to begin rehearsals. And that could affect which play we open with." 
</P>
<P>
At La Jolla, the season's only shows that won't start rehearsals by June 12 
will be directed by the theater's artistic director, Des McAnuff, or the 
artistic director of Chicago's Goodman Theatre, Robert Falls; most artistic 
directors are expected to side with the theaters rather than with the union. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, at the Old Globe, two of the three summer productions that haven't 
begun rehearsals will be directed by the theater's executive producer Craig 
Noel and its artistic director Jack O'Brien. John Hirsch, who will stage the 
remaining summer show, "has indicated he would honor his contract with us," 
said Old Globe managing director Thomas R. Hall, who is also the president of 
LORT. 
</P>
<P>
An informational meeting for West Coast members of SSDC is scheduled for June 
15 at 6 p.m. at the Directors Guild of America headquarters in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
MESMERIZING?: The team of Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee ("Inherit the 
Wind") has collaborated with Norman Cousins on a new play, "Whisper in the 
Mind," about the efforts of hypnotism pioneer Franz Anton Mesmer to convince 
1786 Paris of the value of his treatments. It's the first theatrical endeavor 
for Cousins, the former editor of Saturday Review and author of books about the 
healing powers of the mind. 
</P>
<P>
The play will be read by David Dukes, E. G. Marshall, John Randolph and Mala 
Powers at UCLA's Freud Theatre on June 17 at 7:30 p.m. as the first project of 
the newly formed Audrey Skirball-Kenis Theatre, which hopes to present four to 
six professional play readings a year. Paul Heller and Martha Scott are the 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
Admission is free, but reservations are required: call (213) 284-8965. 
</P>
<P>
GROUNDLING RUMBLINGS: Tom Maxwell, director of the Groundlings for the last 
decade, has resigned to pursue television and movie ventures. His 
responsibilities as artistic director will be assumed by Bill Schreiner, at 
least temporarily, while Oren Michaels has been hired to run the business side 
of the troupe as executive director. 
</P>
<P>
WHOSE SET IS IT? Nicholas Dorr, credited as set designer for the West End 
Playhouse's "Absurd Person Singular" in the program and in a recent Times 
review, said he left the production on April 10, before the scheduled April 29 
opening, and disclaimed responsibility for the set. David Brown, a spokesman 
for the production, replied that Dorr's design was still used, even after he 
left, but that his departure had delayed the opening of the show by one week.

RED MEAT IMPORTANT IN WOMEN'S DIETS; 
</P>
<P>
DISDAINED BEEF A FACTOR IN IRON ABSORPTION, STUDY SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLLEEN PIERRE, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have recently sensed an interesting conflict in people's attitudes toward red 
meat. Some proudly boast that they never eat meat anymore. Others defiantly 
proclaim they will never give it up. And those in the middle struggle to do 
without, but sometimes succumb to the seduction of a big, juicy burger or a 
tender filet. 
</P>
<P>
Should you give up red meat? The answer may be different for men and women. 
</P>
<P>
If you are a woman in childbearing years, consider carefully before deciding to 
go cold turkey. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, national recommendations for people of all ages to reduce fat and 
cholesterol intake are based on statistics collected from men. But 
premenopausal females have a very low risk of heart disease, believed to be due 
to a protective factor related to their hormonal system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Groups of Women Studied 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, a study done in Seattle showed that low blood cholesterol levels 
during the reproductive years are not diet-related. That study compared three 
groups of women: those who ate red meat at least five times per week, those who 
used fish and poultry as their main protein source and those who used only 
lacto-ovo-vegetarian (milk and eggs) sources of protein. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the red-meat group ate considerably more cholesterol and 
saturated fat, their total blood cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol, HDL (good) 
cholesterol and triglycerides were the same as in the other groups. 
</P>
<P>
The difference was their iron status. Despite the fact that dietary iron intake 
was similar for all groups, the red-meat group had higher blood levels of iron. 
Low iron levels among the other two groups placed them at higher risk of 
iron-deficiency anemia (that's right: "iron-poor blood," a common problem among 
women in mid-life). 
</P>
<P>
Red meat seems to contain a factor that improves the absorption of iron from 
the meat, as well as from other foods eaten at the same time, such as bread, 
cereal, grains, beans and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
So mid-life women are at low risk for heart disease, but high risk for 
iron-deficiency anemia. This means that moderate amounts of lean red meat could 
be a real nutritional bargain for this group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Points to Consider 
</P>
<P>
But there are other points to consider. High-fat diets increase the risk of 
cancer, regardless of age. And fat is high in calories. Eating fat makes you 
fat. Then menopause wipes out the protective hormones, rapidly increasing the 
risk of heart disease. So lifelong good habits remain important. 
</P>
<P>
What's a woman to do? 
</P>
<P>
Choose the leanest cuts of beef. Lean, trimmed top round contains only 6 
saturated-fat calories per ounce compared to 12 for sirloin, 17 for chuck or 
rib roast, or 25 for lean ground beef. 
</P>
<P>
If you cannot resist an occasional hamburger, try mixing ground beef with 
ground turkey to cut saturated fat in half. 
</P>
<P>
Watch out for other sources of fat. Many women trade iron-rich meat for 
high-fat foods of lower nutritional value. 
</P>
<P>
Three ounces of top round (18 saturated-fat calories) on two slices of 
whole-wheat bread (8 saturated-fat calories) equal 26 saturated-fat calories 
plus the "meat factor." Three ounces of white-meat turkey (3 saturated-fat 
calories) on a croissant (32 saturated-fat calories) for a total of 35 
saturated fat-calories is not as benign as it first appears.

THE KITCHEN CABINET: OIL-FREE NON-STICK PANS MAY BE STICKING AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MINNIE BERNARDINO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We may be stuck with non-stick cookware forever, now that health-conscious 
individuals are finding low-cholesterol, low-calorie benefits in no-oil food 
preparation. 
</P>
<P>
However, the biggest disappointment with ordinary non-stick cookware is that 
the marriage of the coating to the pan is far from a long-lasting bond. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Liu, marketing director for Le Cook's-Ware, Inc. in San Francisco, blames 
the short-lived performance to "the everyday abrasion of cooking utensils that 
wears out the non-stick coating." 
</P>
<P>
Enter Anolon cookware from Le Cook's-Ware, introduced for the first time 
worldwide last week in Los Angeles. This black cookware with a tempered glass 
lid combines the world's toughest cookware surface, called hard-anodized (which 
is twice as hard as stainless steel), with Du Pont's SilverStone Supra, one of 
the most durable non-stick coatings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sauteing Without Oil 
</P>
<P>
Anolon is amazing. Touch its super-smooth interior surface and you can guess 
what's in store for you. Testing the little 7-inch skillet ($19.99) with no 
oil, I toasted cheese to "death" until it was crusty and browned and cooked a 
whole egg until it was picture-perfect. In the 11-inch stir-fry pan ($59.99), I 
sauteed (remember, no oil) Oriental egg noodles and shrimp, made fried rice, 
and browned julienned chicken breast, beef and pork. And I didn't forget fish 
either, another problem food. Nothing stuck to the pan. The surface was smooth 
and cooked evenly all the way through with no spatters. Cleaning was a cinch, 
of course. 
</P>
<P>
How long will this non-sticking last? Gary Wright, L.A. regional sales manager 
for Le Cook's-Ware said: "We've run some aging cycle tests with the skillet -- 
50,000 cycles, which is equivalent to 35 years of use -- and we ended up with 
just a few pan scratches. We also used a metal spatula and put the pan in the 
dishwasher." 
</P>
<P>
To achieve good heat conduction and retention, aluminum is used in Anolon. When 
questioned about public concern in using aluminum, Liu explained: "The tempered 
anodizing process changes the molecular structure of the pan's surface into an 
electrochemically hardened surface that keeps the food from interacting with 
the aluminum core. It becomes a double protection with the SilverStone Supra (a 
three-coat system that is forced into the anodized cavities of the metal)." 
</P>
<P>
Forthcoming in the Anolon line is a good-size oval fish pan that's perfect for 
whole fish. I like the stir-fry pan, which is almost as deep as a wok but 
offers an excellent weight. There is a seven-piece set ($219), which makes a 
nice starter collection and is appropriate for a bridal gift. This includes a 1 
1/2-quart milk pan with lips, 10-inch open fry pan, an 8 1/2-inch open French 
skillet, a 2-quart covered saucepan and a 6-quart covered stockpot. 
</P>
<P>
Another item that isn't showing signs of being phased out of the kitchen is the 
slow cooker or Crock-Pot. It's surprising how many people still swear by this 
seemingly old-fashioned electric cooking unit for a no-fuss meal. 
</P>
<P>
In the actual sense, as Rival Manufacturing Co. says, it's "slow cooking for 
fast times." Working parents can start the cooker in the morning by putting in, 
for instance, a pot roast, and coming home to a moist and tender meat entree. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Latest Entry 
</P>
<P>
Brand new in the market, Rival Crock-Pot with Corning Ware ($58.95) is quickly 
gaining consumer approval not just for its pretty looks but for its 
versatility. This slow cooker includes a 3-quart Corning Ware casserole insert 
that can be used for table or buffet serving, for refrigerator or freezer 
storage as well as for microwave reheating or cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Available are two designs, featuring the popular Shadow Iris with purplish-blue 
irises and green leaves, and the Country Cornflower with blue and red blossoms 
in beribboned yellow basket. The concept uses the same low-watt "blanket of 
heat" as the original crock pot to produce even cooking. If desired, the meat 
can be browned in the Corning Ware on the stove top or in the microwave before 
placing in the cooker. 
</P>
<P>
Sid Korob, direct sales manager for Rival in Los Angeles, said: "It's historic. 
This is the first time that Corning Ware has ventured with another company." He 
added that "the possibilities to the consumer are unlimited, and if they 
already have the 3-quart Corning piece, they could use it as an extra pot for 
the cooker." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anolon Anodized Non-Stick Cookware is exclusively available at Bullock's. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rival Crock-Pot with Corning Ware is available at May Co., Broadway, Fedco 
and most stores carrying Rival products.

LET'S EAT OUT: CHINESE MENU BLENDS TRADITION WITH INNOVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember Madame Wu? The elegant Madame Wu, who stood like a Chinese icon in her 
jade silk Mandarin dress greeting customers in the atrium of her Madame Wu's 
Garden, where a magnificent stone waterfall gushed resounding cries of welcome. 
</P>
<P>
After 29 years you'd think that something would slip, but not so. The waterfall 
still has a lively gush, the free-standing handsome Chinese pagoda-style 
architecture designed by Guy Moore in the '60s can still be appreciated for its 
period beauty, and Madame Wu, youthful in appearance though in her 70s, still 
makes you feel as if you've arrived at a state banquet attended by royalty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Still Working' 
</P>
<P>
"I've been working since 1960 and I'm still working," said Madame Wu, wife of a 
former Chinese diplomat and aerospace engineer who arrived in Los Angeles via 
Hong Kong in the '40s. 
</P>
<P>
Madame Wu's Garden's success, prior to the last 10 years when the restaurant 
was the only kid on the block, is legendary. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians, businessmen and luminaries such as Cary Grant, Mia Farrow, Frank 
Sinatra and Robert Redford clustered in the atrium while waiting patiently for 
a seat in cozy booths surrounded by artifacts of a caliber not normally seen in 
Los Angeles Chinese restaurants. I love the muted lighting effects, the 
architecturally rounded stucco walls, the understated artwork niched in walls. 
Chinese waiters in bow ties served the illustrious clients with impeccable 
decorum, addressing them by surname, as they still do. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Innovative Touches 
</P>
<P>
The food, too, was notches above run-of-the-mill, with Madame Wu's polished, 
innovative touch adding charm and creativity to the presentation. I remember 
dining on an electrified whole fish, which had been decorated with tiny, 
battery-operated lights illuminating it as the meal was brought to the table. 
</P>
<P>
According to Madame Wu, she and her chef developed the recipe for her famous 
Chinese chicken salad, a takeoff on a complex cold Chinese dish. 
</P>
<P>
However, restaurants flourishing in the Santa Monica area where Wu's Garden 
once was king have gouged huge chunks of the restaurant market, causing Madame 
Wu's Garden to wilt slightly in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Deep, vacant spaces throughout the restaurant scream for the vital life it once 
knew, and a revival of the days when the place was packed. Nevertheless, 
faithful customers, who have aged along with Madame Wu's Garden and Madame Wu 
herself, still come. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all getting old together," Madame Wu says without regret. 
</P>
<P>
But the Garden has not gone to seed and the food could not have been a better 
surprise if I had stumbled upon the restaurant in its heyday. Actually, nothing 
has changed from its original grandiose form. The portions are huge according 
to American, not Chinese standards, following Madame Wu's sensitivity to 
American tastes and needs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cantonese, Mandarin Offerings 
</P>
<P>
Any restaurant starting today strives for years to achieve the perfection that 
Madame Wu's menu has achieved. The Cantonese-Mandarin offerings, though hardly 
as varied as the multiregional cuisines brought to Los Angeles by Chinese chefs 
in the last 10 years, are, nevertheless, simple and to the point, pared down to 
include the best of the tried and true. 
</P>
<P>
If, for instance, you hanker for Cashew chicken, sweet and sour shrimp, chicken 
chow mein, beef lo mein or the foil-wrapped chicken appetizers you used to find 
at almost every Chinese restaurant in the old days, Madame Wu serves them to 
perfection. 
</P>
<P>
The house specialties -- such as tomato beef, beef with vermicelli, moo shu 
pork or chicken plus a group of diet vegetarian dishes (bean curd with 
vegetables and minced chicken) -- deserve a try. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite, by far, are the ribs. And what ribs they are! Honey-barbecued. 
Finger-lickin' good. The best I've had, to be sure. 
</P>
<P>
If you go for lunch, don't miss the tossed shredded chicken salad. It's one of 
the best in town. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Value for the Dollar 
</P>
<P>
The prices? What a bargain. You can order Peking Duck for four to six persons 
for only $29.50. You can get a whole steamed fish of the type that's served 
last on an elaborate Chinese banquet menu or a lobster Cantonese for only 
$13.95. 
</P>
<P>
A common factor found while rediscovering classic restaurants in town has been 
the decent price structure. There is no arrogant high-pricing among them. You 
get value for the dollar, considering the high quality of the food, ambiance 
and service. You sense an old-fashioned regard for other people's money that 
may elude operators of over-priced restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
At the Garden, chow mein for lunch is $6.95. Soups are $3.95 to $5.95; shrimp, 
pork, beef and chicken dishes range from $6.95 to $8.95. Entrees on the dinner 
menu start at $9.95. 
</P>
<P>
And for dessert, the ginger and coconut ice creams will be wonderful 
palate-pleasers. 
</P>
<P>
Like everything else at Madame Wu's Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Madame Wu's Garden, 2201 Wilshire Blvd, Santa Monica. (213) 828-5656. Open 
Monday through Thursday from 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.; Friday from 11:30 a.m. to

IN PEAK SUPPLY CURRENTLY; 
</P>
<P>
NOW'S THE TIME TO ENJOY AVOCADOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Although avocados are available year round, the peak supply is found during 
spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
California avocados make up nearly 90% of the nation's avocado production, a 
spokesman for the California Avocado Commission, a nonprofit organization, 
explained recently. 
</P>
<P>
Over 80% of the California avocado crop is made up of the Hass variety, which 
has a thick, pebbly skin and a rich, nutty taste. The Hass variety is available 
from January through October, with peak supply from May through August. 
</P>
<P>
The other 20% of the California crop consists of the Greenskin varieties, which 
have thin, smooth green skin. Greenskin varieties generally are available from 
November through May. 
</P>
<P>
Avocados have 17 vitamins and minerals, more potassium ounce-for-ounce than 26 
fruits and juices and 19 vegetables -- and no cholesterol. Half an avocado 
contains 9.7 grams of mono-unsaturated fats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Select Carefully 
</P>
<P>
When buying avocados, select fruit that is free of bruises or gouges. A ripe 
avocado yields to pressure when it is gently squeezed. The Hass avocado also 
shows its ripeness by changing color from green to purple-black. 
</P>
<P>
Firm avocados will ripen in a fruit bowl at room temperature. You can speed the 
ripening process by storing them for a few days in a paper bag at room 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Many grocery stores now stock ripe avocados. Look for fruit that is marked with 
stickers that identify them as ripe. They should be refrigerated until they are 
eaten, but not for longer than 5 days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Easy Preparation 
</P>
<P>
To prepare an avocado, follow these steps: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cut the avocado in half, lengthwise around the seed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rotate the two halves to separate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To remove the seed, either slide the tip of a spoon gently underneath and 
lift it out, or place the avocado half on a cutting board; carefully and gently 
strike the seed with a medium-size knife. Rotate the knife and lift the seed 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To peel the avocado half, place the cut side down on a cutting board and 
remove the skin with your fingers or a knife. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To prevent discoloration, sprinkle all cut surfaces with lemon or lime 
juice.

SALMON ECONOMICAL WAY TO SATISFY HEARTY APPETITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canned salmon is a convenient and economical way to satisfy hungry appetites. 
There are a about five different species of Pacific salmon which vary in color 
and texture, all of which provide a rich source of vitamins and minerals and 
should be enjoyed whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
Among the species of salmon is Chinook, which is rich in oil with easy-to-flake 
flesh. This type is most commonly used in salads. 
</P>
<P>
Chum has a light color, is coarser in texture and is generally less expensive 
than other types of salmon. It is ideal for casseroles and cooked dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Other varieties include Coho, perfect in almost any recipe, and available in 
red or pink; and Red Sockeye -- with its deep red color and high amount oil, it 
can easily be used for sandwiches, salads, hors d'oeuvre or garnishes. 
</P>
<P>
Try this Quick Salmon Rice Casserole, for a fast and good tasting dish, 
whichever type your choose. 
</P>
<P>
Flake 1 (7 3/4-ounce) can salmon into buttered 1 1/2-quart casserole. Stir in 3 
cups cooked rice, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1/4 cup chopped celery, 1/2 
teaspoon dill weed, 3/4 cup shredded medium Cheddar cheese, 1 (10 1/2-ounce) 
can cream of mushroom soup and 1/4 cup milk. Bake at 350 degrees 25 to 30 
minutes. Makes 4 servings.

THE BUTCHER: PORK LEG CAN BE TURNED INTO VARIETY OF MEALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you like your pork lean and inexpensive, look to the leg. Fresh leg of pork 
is often one of the best pork buys in any meat case. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, many people -- even those who love good, lean, low-cost pork -- 
pass up a good buy on a fresh leg because it's too big. 
</P>
<P>
People can't imagine what to do with one, except roast it and eat it for weeks. 
But there are ways to work with a fresh leg of pork to provide many different 
and varied meals -- pork steaks, cutlets, roasts and kebabs for the barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
A whole leg of fresh pork will weigh between 16 and 20 pounds and that is, 
admittedly, a good-size hunk of meat, but you usually can get the shank half of 
the leg at the same low price when fresh legs of pork are "on special." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shank Is Easier 
</P>
<P>
The shank half is by far the best half for a novice to work with. It does not 
contain the hip bone and that makes it much less difficult than the butt half 
to divide into many meals. 
</P>
<P>
A shank half leg of fresh pork can be turned into a freezer full of great 
meal-making meat even for the smallest family. 
</P>
<P>
There are four separate muscles that make up a leg of pork (a leg of any meat 
for that matter): the top, the tip, the eye and the bottom muscles. Taking one 
apart is not a difficult project and the marvelous meals that may be made from 
the component parts make the project more than worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
First, remove the hock, if there is one. Some legs come with the hock already 
removed. Find the joint with the point of your knife, then cut through it to 
separate the hock from the rest of the leg. Use the hock to make a good 
stick-to-the-ribs pork-and-beans casserole. 
</P>
<P>
Next, remove the skin. Most fresh legs of pork are sold with the skin still on. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use the Skin 
</P>
<P>
There are several things that you can do with the skin; it should not be 
wasted. For one, cut it into squares and add it to the hock when you cook 
beans. 
</P>
<P>
For another, tie it around a piece of lean, boneless pork that you roast over 
the coals and let it baste the meat as it turns crackin' good and crisp. And if 
you are into making your own sausage, try using fresh pork skin as an 
ingredient. It gives sausage a nice texture. 
</P>
<P>
Next, separate each of the muscles of the leg by cutting along the natural 
seams that divide them. There is really no trick to it, the muscles are clearly 
defined and easy to separate. What you do with the individual muscles once you 
have them separated is limited by little but your imagination. 
</P>
<P>
The top and tip muscle are the most tender (although none is apt to be tough). 
Use them for roasting or frying or cut them into thin strips or cubes for 
stir-fry dishes or thin slices for cutlets. The bottom and eye muscles are 
perfect for braised dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Here are a few quick-to-fix and delicious dishes perfect for the meat of the 
leg.

MALIBU LEADER SWAPS HOT SEAT FOR ALASKA JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not many people would trade the sandy shores of Malibu for the chilly clime of 
Anchorage, but John Sibert is not like many people. 
</P>
<P>
Sibert, a Caltech chemist, was one of the Malibu leaders whose testimony helped 
persuade Los Angeles County supervisors to reject a massive and unpopular 
$86-million sewer system in Malibu in 1987 because it went well beyond the 
scope and needs of the coastal community. 
</P>
<P>
And Sibert was one of the Malibu leaders who served on a citizens committee 
that recommended that supervisors approve a small-scale and unpopular sewer 
system for the community last fall. 
</P>
<P>
The first time around, Sibert was considered a local hero. The second time 
around, some considered him an enemy of the people. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody asked me what were the ups and downs of serving on the committee," 
Sibert said Tuesday. "I told him the upside is that they throw a lot of mud 
your way. I told him the downside is that there are sometimes rocks in the 
mud." 
</P>
<P>
Such is life in Malibu, where political dissent can sometimes mean political 
suicide. Yet after three years of public service in Malibu, Sibert has emerged 
with his reputation intact and his resume expanded. He is moving to Anchorage 
soon to become the first executive director of the Alaska Science and 
Technology Foundation, an agency created to finance research and development 
aimed at expanding the economic base of the nation's 50th state. 
</P>
<P>
Sibert, who has served on numerous local committees including the Santa Monica 
Bay Restoration Project, said the Alaska offer "was just too good to pass up." 
The 52-year-old scientist said he has agreed to run the research foundation for 
at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really going to Alaska to get away from this," Sibert said of his role 
on the much-criticized sewer committee. "I've never pretended to stand for 
anything other than what I've said I stand for. It's just that for a lot of the 
issues in Malibu, there's a religious fervor associated with them. And in 
Malibu, there are a lot of strong-minded individuals who aren't afraid to voice 
their opinions." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Surprised 
</P>
<P>
The former Yale University professor said he was not surprised by some of the 
negative response to his belief that a small sewer system was needed for some 
areas of Malibu. Nor was he surprised when supervisors expanded the system by 
50% against his wishes and increased the cost to $43 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Dealing with the county government of Los Angeles was more difficult than 
dealing with either the federal or state government," said Sibert, who has done 
consulting work for U.S. Senate and House subcommittees. "In the county, even 
relatively minor decisions are not made at a level below the supervisors, and 
you end up with five people making all the decisions for an area of 8.5 million 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Sibert was asked to serve on the sewer committee by Leon Cooper, former 
president of the Malibu Township Council. Sibert joined the council, the most 
active political group in Malibu, shortly after moving to the beachside haven 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel bad on John's behalf because I asked him to join, and I knew we were 
going to get lambasted because we disagreed with some interests in town," 
Cooper said. "But John's a remarkable guy. If there is any one person in the 
community who helped to organize the basic arguments to defeat the monster 
($86-million) sewer system, it was he. Still, we both feel that there are 
certain parts of the community where a sewer system is necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Coastal Commissioner Madelyn Glickfeld, who lives in Malibu, said Sibert has 
been an "incredible asset to the community." She said he undertook many 
difficult roles with little regard for personal reward. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that makes it so difficult here is that with people having 
such strong beliefs on both sides of the issues, there's very few people to 
bridge the gap," she said. "John tried to bridge the gap. Unfortunately, he 
found that there's not a lot of constituency in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
Sewers were not on Sibert's mind when he moved to Malibu 3 1/2 years ago after 
living in Venice for five years. He and his wife, Blanca Parra-Sibert, wanted 
to live near the beach but couldn't afford the then-pricier homes in Santa 
Monica and Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, I couldn't even afford to buy my home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sibert moved to Los Angeles to work for the Atlantic Richfield Co., where he 
was manager of program research and head of the Corporate Resources Technology 
Laboratory. Several years ago he moved back to academia, becoming division 
administrator for chemistry and chemical engineering at Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
In his new role, Sibert's charge will be to reverse a trend that sees about 90% 
of Alaska's natural resources exported to other parts of the globe. The 
foundation will sponsor research and development programs aimed at boosting the 
number of local jobs in the fishing, oil and timber industries. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Benton, vice president for university affairs at Pepperdine University, 
who served with Sibert on the sewer committee, said Alaska's gain is Malibu's 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
"Throughout this, John has been unfailingly objective and fair in dealing with 
every constituency, whether it be the county of Los Angeles, the Malibu 
Committee for Incorporation or the Malibu Township Council," Benton said. "And 
he's always done so with integrity and with a clarity of thought that is seldom 
seen on complex issues." 
</P>
<P>
Sibert said he expects to return to his Point Dume home after he finishes his 
tenure in Anchorage and will probably step back into the fray. 
</P>
<P>
"I swear I'm not masochistic," he said. "I've taken my shots here, but you 
can't take these things personally. I really like Malibu, and it's nice to know 
that some people really appreciated the work that I did."

CULVER CITY BATTLES INCREASE IN GRAFFITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the first 4 1/2 years of a city program to remove graffiti from public and 
private property, Culver City spent about $105,000 to paint over more than 
1,600 spray-painted scribblings. 
</P>
<P>
But in the first 10 months of this fiscal year, more than 1,000 markings have 
had to be covered, and by the end of this month when the fiscal year ends, the 
city expects to have spent $96,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It's appalling to every resident of Culver City," Mayor Jozelle Smith said. 
"But it's happening everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
The increase in graffiti caught city officials by surprise. At the beginning of 
the fiscal year, $14,000 was allocated for graffiti removal. But the amount was 
increased to $38,000 in November, and last week, the City Council increased it 
again to $51,000. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, about $45,000 has been allocated for graffiti removal by the 
Redevelopment Agency on property administered by the agency, and by the 
Municipal Services Department in city parks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increased Workload 
</P>
<P>
"It just has increased so dramatically," said Phyllis Baboolal, manager of the 
city's housing programs office, which oversees the graffiti program. "There 
seems to be more people doing more graffiti on more properties." 
</P>
<P>
Culver City is not the only place where graffiti has increased. Tim Sullivan, 
president of Graffiti Removal Co., which contracts with 20 cities in Los 
Angeles and Orange counties, including Culver City, said his company's workload 
has increased about 20% over last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just gangs any more, it's punk rockers, skate-boarders and just 
regular kids," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to providing more money, Culver City officials are hoping to 
control the graffiti problem by getting more property owners involved. Graffiti 
at commercial and residential sites is removed by a contractor at no cost to 
the property owner. Property owners report graffiti to a city hot line, (213) 
280-5929. 
</P>
<P>
Baboolal said that when graffiti are painted over, extra paint will be left 
with the property owner to encourage property owners to remove new scribblings 
themselves and free contractors to concentrate on new graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
She said she also hopes Neighborhood Watch programs will become involved by 
getting consent forms in advance to allow the contractor onto private property, 
and to watch for and report new graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to stress to residents that it is their responsibility to get it 
removed immediately," Smith said. "People have to take a certain amount pride 
in their neighborhoods to get rid of the graffiti." 
</P>
<P>
Police Lt. Ellis Smith said some of the graffiti are from a local gang, but he 
attributed the increase to a growing fad among teen-agers called "tagging." He 
said this is a term applied to graffiti by non-gang members. It usually 
involves more artistic scribblings and drawings than the gang generated 
variety, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said most of the graffiti are in the city's east and west sides, the 
parts of the city that are nearly surrounded by Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warning to Offenders 
</P>
<P>
"We've caught some of the kids, and we have a good idea who some of the others 
might be," Smith said. "We're going to talk to their parents and warn them that 
they may liable for the cost of removing the graffiti. We're hoping that will 
stop some of it." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said sentencing some of the offenders to paint over their graffiti will 
also be a deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
"We are encouraging the courts to assign the offenders to community service to 
remove the graffiti themselves," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone has been surprised by the rise of graffiti in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't surprise me," said Jackie McCain, president of the Culver City 
Homeowners Assn., which has about 150 members. "We don't have a wall around our 
city."

TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Work began last week on a $4.2-million computerized traffic control system for 
the heavily congested streets in and around Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
Known as ATSAC, or Automated Traffic Surveillance and Control, the system is 
similar to one that has cut intersection delays by 20% and travel time by 13% 
in the Coliseum area, said S.E. Rowe, general manager of the city 
Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
Using electronic sensors implanted in the pavement, ATSAC relays information 
about the flow of traffic to a control center in City Hall, where computers 
regulate the timing of traffic signals. 
</P>
<P>
The system is financed by fees paid by developers whose projects contribute to 
traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
The Westwood ATSAC area connects traffic signals in the area bounded by the San 
Diego Freeway on the west, Beverly Hills on the east, Olympic Boulevard on the 
south and Montana Avenue, Wilshire Boulevard and UCLA on the north. 
</P>
<P>
"By next March, West Los Angeles will have the first installment of a truly 
space-age traffic control network," City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said. "I 
look forward to better traffic conditions here and throughout the city with the 
implementation of ATSAC."

HEARING ON BUS LINE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Culver City Transportation Department will hold a public hearing on 
proposed Culver CityBus fare increases and route changes Wednesday at 7 p.m. at 
Veterans Memorial Auditorium, 4117 Overland Ave. 
</P>
<P>
Under the department's proposal, the basic 50-cent fare would be maintained, 
but the fare for seniors and the disabled would increase to 25 cents from 15 
cents; the fare for elementary and secondary students would rise to 35 cents 
from 25 cents, and college students -- who now get a discount fare of 35 cents 
-- would pay the full rate. The cost of a transfer would rise to 25 cents from 
10 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed route changes include increasing the frequency on Line 1 (Washington 
Boulevard to the West Los Angeles Transit Center and Venice) from every 20 
minutes to every 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The cross-town Line 3, which goes from Westside Pavilion to the Fox Hills Mall, 
would be expanded during peak periods by keeping two buses in service for one 
hour longer. 
</P>
<P>
Line 6, which runs along Sepulveda Boulevard between Los Angeles International 
Airport and UCLA, would increase Saturday service frequency, and Sunday service 
would be added.

BROADCAST OF AIRPORT BOARD SESSIONS ASKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Burbank City Council members, unable to pressure the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena 
Airport Authority to meet at night instead of mornings, said they want to study 
the possibility of videotaping authority meetings and broadcasting them at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Mary Lou Howard, who sits on the nine-member airport board, said 
Tuesday that the broadcasts would give citizens who can't go to the meetings an 
opportunity to see the board in action and become acquainted with airport 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
"It would provide a service and let people know what's going on," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
But other commissioners did not seem to share Howard's enthusiasm for the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a choice between taping and not taping, I would choose not to tape," 
said Robert Garcin, authority president. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Worthwhile' 
</P>
<P>
"These meetings don't need to be broadcast," said Carl Meseck, who represents 
Glendale. "We can't conduct good business that way. It's not a worthwhile 
situation for anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Some opponents of videotaping said filming the meetings would encourage more 
interruptions by gadflies who regularly attend the meetings and berate board 
members at length. 
</P>
<P>
"This would just be an extension of the same people who are literally at every 
single meeting saying the same thing," said Carl W. Raggio, another Glendale 
representative. "These folks are far more interested in how they present 
themselves and how they bash us than in the content of what they're saying." 
</P>
<P>
"This would just be an added opportunity for these folks to be on stage," 
Meseck said. 
</P>
<P>
Other commissioners said they would need more information about costs before 
making a decision. A few said they would not be interested if the cities they 
represent had to bear some of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
The authority, which oversees the operation of Burbank Airport, meets at 9 a.m. 
on the first and third Mondays of each month. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Johnson, the city of Burbank's public information officer, said he was 
trying to discover how much taping the meetings would cost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Thousands of Dollars' 
</P>
<P>
Although he declined to speculate on a specific figure, Johnson said the taping 
would cost in "the thousands of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to report to the council next week. 
</P>
<P>
"The goal is to make the meetings watchable," Johnson said. "Taping the 
meetings with one camera would not do it." 
</P>
<P>
He said it would cost more to film the meetings with three cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Howard said the meetings could be broadcast over the Sammons Communications 
cable system, which serves Glendale and Burbank. The Burbank City Council and 
Planning Commission meetings are aired each week over the system. 
</P>
<P>
But Sammons does not serve Pasadena, which owns one-third of the airport and 
whose three representatives form one-third of the airport board. 
</P>
<P>
For the third time in four years, the airport authority last week rejected a 
Burbank City Council proposal to hold its regularly scheduled meetings at night 
for the convenience of the public. 
</P>
<P>
Authority members opposed to the switch said they believe that night meetings 
would not be as productive with additional public input.

ACTIVISTS TOLD TO PRESSURE ROCKWELL FOR CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of more than 35 homeowner and environmental groups were urged 
Wednesday to pressure Rockwell International to speed the cleanup of 
radioactive and chemical pollution at its Santa Susana Field Laboratory west of 
Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Contamination of a portion of the 2,668-acre complex was described in a 
preliminary report released last month by the U.S. Department of Energy, which 
has contracted with Rockwell's Rocketdyne division for nuclear work. 
</P>
<P>
The report found that while the pollution poses no immediate threat to nearby 
residents, more environmental tests are necessary to determine the extent of 
the contamination because of inadequacies in the company's ground-water 
monitoring system. 
</P>
<P>
Rocketdyne and DOE officials have since announced that 18 additional 
ground-water monitoring wells will be drilled by the end of the year on a 
portion of the site where nuclear research was conducted for nearly 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Health Effects 
</P>
<P>
But the 45 homeowners and activists at Wednesday's meeting at a Northridge home 
said they are still concerned about the health effects of the pollution. 
</P>
<P>
"I am shocked and dismayed that people in the San Fernando and Simi valleys 
have been kept in the dark so long," said Los Angeles school board member Julie 
Korenstein, who is seeking reelection in her West Valley district. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, Korenstein was a member of the National Council of Jewish 
Women, which met with Rocketdyne officials at the time and expressed concern 
about environmental dangers from the site. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew something was stinking up there, and we were right all along," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting drew representatives from such groups as the Coalition of Valley 
Communities, a federation of about 20 homeowner groups; the local chapters of 
the Sierra Club and the National Council of Jewish Women, and the Southern 
California Federation of Scientists, an environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
James Werner, a former consultant who worked on the DOE report and is now an 
environmental scientist with the New York-based Natural Resources Defense 
Council, attended the meeting. He and Dan Reicher, an attorney for the council, 
urged the group to become politically active and to use all avenues open to 
them, such as the federal Freedom of Information Act, to educate themselves 
about Rocketdyne's activities. 
</P>
<P>
Reicher said that at other DOE sites across the nation, the contractors provide 
public reading rooms stocked with documents and reference reports on the 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"You can get action if you can get local congressmen involved," Reicher said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Monitor Cleanup 
</P>
<P>
Werner said the council plans to open an office in Los Angeles and will monitor 
cleanup at the lab. 
</P>
<P>
Milena Miller, president of the Reseda Community Assn., said Rocketdyne is 
"making billions and billions of dollars up there, and don't tell me they don't 
have the money or time to clean it up." 
</P>
<P>
DOE officials estimated in a December report that cleaning up a 290-acre 
portion of the site where nuclear work occurred will cost about $55 million and 
take about 20 years. However, a new report estimating the cost and duration of 
the cleanup will be released in August, DOE officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Coulter, a Rocketdyne spokesman, said earlier Wednesday that a draft of the 
still-unpublished report "substantially cuts" the amount of time estimated for 
the cleanup. Coulter declined to say how long the report estimates that the 
cleanup will take. DOE officials have also declined to discuss the report until 
August. 
</P>
<P>
But Scott Samuelson, acting director of the nuclear energy division of the 
DOE's San Francisco office, said last week that the lab is one of about 35 
polluted DOE sites in the nation. "It may be some time before the department 
has the resources to put" into work on the Rocketdyne site, he said.

HARVARD STUDY TO TRACK AIR QUALITY IN SIMI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In one of the first and most far-reaching studies of its kind, Harvard 
University has begun monitoring air quality in Simi Valley and 23 other North 
American communities to investigate the health effects of acid pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
The $3-million project, funded by the U.S. and Canadian governments, will focus 
on whether airborne acids, which come from power plants and automobile exhaust, 
cause respiratory problems in school-age children. 
</P>
<P>
Those pollutants are the same compounds found in acid rain, which is believed 
to harm vegetation and the facades of buildings. The Harvard study, however, 
will focus only on the health effects of acid particles and gases that are 
directly inhaled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Some Effects' 
</P>
<P>
"There certainly do seem to be some effects," said Jerry Keeler, project 
manager for the acid study and a research scientist at the Harvard School of 
Public Health. "But past studies are inconclusive. There just hasn't been 
enough work done to definitively answer the question." 
</P>
<P>
Of the communities selected for the project, which is expected to be completed 
in 1991, two-thirds were believed to have air with high acid levels and the 
other one-third were thought to have relatively acid-free air, Keeler said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ventura County's ozone level is ranked by the federal Environmental 
Protection Agency as fourth worst in the nation, Keeler declined to identify 
Simi Valley's category because he feared skewing the objectivity of the study. 
</P>
<P>
If participants believe that their community is being studied for its clean 
air, he said, they tend to respond to questions in a manner that supports that 
premise. "If they know it's being looked at as a dirty area," Keeler said, 
"then they think, 'Oh, we must be sick.' " 
</P>
<P>
The monitoring of Simi Valley begins today and will continue for a year. 
Special equipment was shipped to the Ventura County Air Pollution Control 
District, which will be paid $6,270 by Harvard to take readings every other 
day. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, questionnaires will be submitted to about 800 Simi Valley 
elementary-school children asking about a range of respiratory-related 
ailments. Young children were selected because they don't smoke cigarettes, 
which could hamper the analysis, Keeler said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Respiratory Tests 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the spring of 1990, Harvard researchers will conduct respiratory tests 
on any of the children whose parents consent to an exam. 
</P>
<P>
"It may turn out that the Simi Valley area really has very moderate levels and 
isn't as dirty as you would expect," Keeler said. "It's just important not to 
give people a bias beforehand." 
</P>
<P>
The only other California cities included in the study are Monterey and 
Livermore. 
</P>
<P>
If the results indicate that acid particles pose a significant health threat, 
Keeler said, acids might join the five other airborne pollutants that the EPA 
regulates, including ozone, nitrogen dioxide and lead. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, such studies have been conducted primarily in laboratories and 
indicate that acids in large quantities have an acute, immediate health effect, 
he said. However, there is little data on the chronic, long-term effects of 
exposure to such pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be very valuable to Ventura County," said Richard H. Baldwin, 
the county's air pollution control officer. "It will be good to know whether we 
have a problem or not."

ANTI-SEMITIC SLOGANS PAINTED ON SYNAGOGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vandals armed with spray cans painted swastikas and anti-Semitic slogans on the 
walls of a Simi Valley synagogue, the Simi Valley Police Department reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The symbols, which included references to Hitler and the Nazis, were painted on 
exterior walls of Temple Ner Tamid on Monday night, Lt. Don Austin said. A 
secretary discovered the graffiti when she arrived for work at the temple 
Tuesday morning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first such incident at the temple, said the secretary, who did not 
give her name. She said the graffiti would be painted over as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
She would not say how much graffiti were found, but said the vandalism was bad 
enough to prompt her to contact police. 
</P>
<P>
Police do not have any suspects in the case, Austin said.

TUNNELS OF TROUBLE; 
</P>
<P>
SEALING OF FREEWAY WALKWAYS SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pedestrian tunnels beneath the San Diego Freeway, built in the 1960s to provide 
convenient neighborhood passageways, have become unsafe neighborhood nuisances 
in the 1980s and should be sealed up, Los Angeles Councilman Hal Bernson said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Four Sepulveda tunnels have been the target of persistent complaints from 
nearby residents who describe them as dim shelters for vandals and drug deals 
and quick escape routes for criminals being chased by police. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson, who represents the north San Fernando Valley, introduced a City 
Council motion Wednesday seeking authorization to order the state Department of 
Transportation to barricade tunnels at Superior, Tupper, Rayen and Chase 
streets. The matter should come before the council within a week. 
</P>
<P>
"Those tunnels were built for convenience, but the people are afraid to use 
them," Bernson said. "The community has been complaining about them for years." 
</P>
<P>
Ramona Strongbow, 60, who lives next to the Superior Street tunnel, circulated 
a petition in her neighborhood to seal it. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't believe what comes through that tunnel," she said. "People stand 
in it and fill it with graffiti and it has turned into a giant urinal. We don't 
want it. There's no reason to have it." 
</P>
<P>
Another resident, who lives near the Tupper Street tunnel, said he and most of 
his neighbors no longer want their quiet streets of single-family homes to be 
connected by pedestrian tunnel to the neighborhood of apartments east of the 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"Our side is very well-maintained," said Julio Armenteros, 48, of nearby 
Aqueduct Avenue. "The other side is a very rowdy neighborhood. When they are 
chased by police, they run through the tunnel." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans spokesman Jim McCarthy said that in 1962, Los Angeles city officials 
required that the tunnels be built as a part of the San Diego Freeway 
construction project that lasted through the mid-1960s. At the time, the 
tunnels were promoted as a means by which neighborhoods that otherwise would be 
severed by the freeway would instead remain linked, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now they are undesirable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the council approves the barricades, Caltrans will fill the tunnels with 
sand and build cinder-block walls at each end. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to keep those people from the other side from coming in," Armenteros 
said.

KORENSTEIN BLAMED FOR ALIENATION; 
</P>
<P>
CHALLENGER SAYS PARENTS DISENCHANTED WITH SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Board of Education candidate Jerry Horowitz charged Wednesday that 
incumbent Julie Korenstein has alienated parents and caused them to lose faith 
in their local schools. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein "has allowed the situation in the West Valley schools to 
disintegrate to the point where parents are not only disenchanted with our 
schools but actively seek means to have their children educated elsewhere," 
Horowitz said during a news conference at Sepulveda Junior High School. 
</P>
<P>
Six parents who support Horowitz attended the news conference to talk about 
their dissatisfaction with Korenstein and their complaints about bad teachers, 
school violence and overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz and Korenstein face a runoff Tuesday made necessary April 11 when 
Korenstein fell 57 votes short of the margin she needed to win reelection to 
the West San Fernando Valley seat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Principal Angry 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's news conference was one of five that Horowitz has scheduled for the 
last week of the campaign. His choice of a location angered Sepulveda Principal 
Wilbert Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a violent school," said Whitaker, who was not told in advance 
about the event. He said scheduling the event at Sepulveda implied that it was 
plagued by the problems that Horowitz cited. Asked about the choice of 
Sepulveda, Horowitz said it was chosen because it was near several freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Horowitz's statement that she had been inaccessible and had 
alienated parents, Korenstein responded angrily: "I have been probably the most 
accessible board member this district has ever seen." She said her telephone 
number is listed, and she meets frequently with parents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JROTC Program 
</P>
<P>
Among those parents who turned out to support Horowitz was Bobbie Hamilton, who 
said she has three children at three district schools. Hamilton said she turned 
against Korenstein because Korenstein opposed establishing a JROTC training 
program last year at Granada Hills High School, where Hamilton's son Cameron is 
a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein's opposition came despite support for the idea from parents, 
students and the school principal, Hamilton said, claiming that Korenstein "was 
the one person who didn't want it." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Zeke, another parent at the news conference, said she supports Horowitz 
because Korenstein had acknowledged her own ineffectiveness at a community 
meeting. "She said to get anything done, you need four votes . . . so there 
wasn't much she could do," Zeke said.

FOR THE RECORD

<P>
An article Thursday quoted a parent as saying that Los Angeles Board of 
Education member Julie Korenstein had opposed establishing a Junior Reserve 
Officers Training Corps program at Granada Hills High School. In fact, 
Korenstein was one of three board members voting in favor of the program when 
the issue came before the board on June 27, 1988.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BERNARDI ENDORSED BY RIVAL FROM PRIMARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jules Bagneris, who ran against Los Angeles Councilman Ernani Bernardi in the 
April 11 primary, Wednesday endorsed Bernardi as a candidate of "passion, 
courage and conviction." 
</P>
<P>
Those were the words that Bagneris used to describe himself during the primary 
campaign, which ended with him gaining 16.5% of the vote. Bernardi failed to 
win a majority in that election and was forced into a Tuesday runoff with 
second-place finisher Lyle Hall, a city fire captain. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not have the confidence early on in either of the candidates," Bagneris 
said. "What changed my mind was that I thought about who was most like myself." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hall's campaign announced a massive precinct walk Saturday, 
beginning with a menudo breakfast sponsored by Dolores Huerta, vice president 
of the United Farm Workers of America. Also scheduled to walk precincts for 
Hall is former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., chairman of the state 
Democratic Party.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRIVER GETS PROBATION IN PASSENGER'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Reseda man was sentenced Wednesday to three years probation for vehicular 
manslaughter and felony drunk driving stemming from an accident that killed a 
Canoga Park man last year. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Robert Moss, 35, was convicted last month in connection with the March 5, 
1988, accident. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Kathryne A. Stoltz said she imposed the minimum 
allowable sentence because Moss had no previous convictions. Stoltz also noted 
that Moss' intentions were admirable. He was driving because he thought that 
his companion, Fabian Gutierrez, 27, the man killed in the accident, was too 
intoxicated to drive. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth A. Loveman said afterward: "I have no complaints 
with the court's decision." Moss could have received a maximum sentence of six 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Moss and Gutierrez had been drinking with friends at a Woodland Hills bar 
before the accident, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving the bar, Moss drove the two in Gutierrez's car toward the home of 
another friend. Witnesses told police that Moss was driving because he and 
others thought that Gutierrez had drunk too much alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Moss failed to make a turn at Farralone Avenue and Philiprimm Street, and the 
car overturned. Gutierrez was thrown through a side window, police said. He was 
pronounced dead at the scene.

TRIP HOME A SUCCESS FOR PADRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURT HOLBREICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time this season, the Padres leave for a trip today not wondering 
if happiness is seeing San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium in their rear-view 
mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
Their 2-1 victory Wednesday night in front of 13,533 gave them a three-game 
sweep of the Philadelphia Phillies and their first winning home stand (6-3) in 
four tries. 
</P>
<P>
Even better, they did so in one of those dramatic ways that leave a good 
feeling. 
</P>
<P>
Marvell Wynne was the hero, hitting a two-out, eighth-inning RBI double down 
the right field line that landed barely fair near the Philadelphia bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Alomar, who led off the inning with a walk off loser Jeff Parrett, was 
running on the pitch and scored easily. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres could not have asked for a better sendoff to launch them on a 
10-game trip that will take them through the cities of three of their closest 
National League West rivals. 
</P>
<P>
The victory raised their record to 29-25, four games over .500 for the first 
time, and kept them in third place in what is becoming an increasingly close 
division race. That could begin to sort out in the next week as the Padres 
embark on a trip that will take them in succession to Cincinnati, fourth-place 
Houston and division-leading San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
After having squandered several earlier scoring chances, they have Wynne to 
thank for their standing. 
</P>
<P>
"I got it up in the (strike) zone, belt high," said Parrett, who started the 
eighth in relief of starter Bob Sebra. "He was right on top of it." 
</P>
<P>
That was because Wynne was anticipating exactly what Parrett delivered. 
</P>
<P>
"I got the pitch I was looking for -- a three-one fastball," Wynne said. "It 
was right where I wanted it." 
</P>
<P>
The hit made a winner out of reliever Greg Harris (1-2). Harris pitched a 
scoreless eighth after starter Dennis Rasmussen left having allowed only two 
hits, including a first-inning home run by former Padre Dickie Thon, in seven 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Davis came on in the ninth for his 17th save in as many opportunities, but 
he had to pitch out of a jam after Von Hayes reached third with one out on a 
single to right and a two-base error by John Kruk, who allowed the ball to get 
under his glove and roll just in front of the warning track. 
</P>
<P>
Davis got Chris James to ground out to third and Steve Lake to strike out to 
end the game. 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen wasted little time adding to his most undistinguished statistic -- a 
penchant for first-inning trouble. This time it was Thon, the game's second 
batter, who added to Rasmussen's season-long first-inning woes by hitting a 
line drive to left on a one-and-one pitch. The ball clanged off the railing in 
front of the lower stands. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second home run for Thon, equaling his total of the previous two 
seasons and extended his batting streak to 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
Thon's homer marked the 10th time in 11 starts that Rasmussen had yielded a 
first-inning run and raised the first-innning count against Rasmussen to 17 
runs, 28 hits and five home runs. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, the Padres, who by contrast have had trouble scoring in the 
first inning -- only 13 times in their previous 53 games, including four of 
five times against the Phillies -- got the run right back. They needed only one 
hit off Sebra to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Right fielder Bip Roberts opened with a single to center, extending his 
three-game on-base streak to seven plate appearances. Roberts (whose streak 
ended on a groundout to first two innings later) stole second and moved to 
third on Alomar's groundout to second. He scored on Tony Gwynn's fly down the 
left-field line in foul territory. 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen did his best to make the most of lone run. He had no trouble in the 
second and third, setting down the Phillies in order. But he found himself in a 
jam in the fourth, loading the bases on two out with a single and two walks 
before going to three and zero on Lake. 
</P>
<P>
But Rasmussen was able to work the count back to three and two before getting 
Lake to end the inning on a popup to first. 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen got back on track the next three innings, retiring the side in order 
the fifth and sixth and allowing only a two-out walk in the seventh before he 
was lifted for a pinch hitter and replaced by Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen left with his best pitching line of the season -- one run on the 
homer to Thon, two hits, four walks and four strikeouts in seven innings. The 
Padres, meanwhile, were having their own problems against Sebra, a career 13-24 
pitcher who was making only his third start since being recalled May 17 from 
triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. 
</P>
<P>
Sebra, the 10th pitcher to start for the injury-riddled Phillies staff, had 
handled the Padres easily in his first start -- a 3-1 victory on May 21 in 
Philadelphia in which he allowed one run on seven hits and struck out eight in 
eight innings. But in his next start, he was racked for five runs in four 
innings in a 6-1 loss at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say the Padres did have their chances, putting runners on base 
in the second, third, fourth and seventh innings, including leadoff hitters' 
doubles in the fourth and seventh. But each time Sebra was able to pitch out of 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth, Wynne opened with a double and was sacrificed to third by Benito 
Santiago, but Sebra avoided a run by getting Tim Flannery on a liner to third 
and Garry Templeton on a strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
The seventh followed a similar pattern, after a leadoff double by Santiago and 
a sacrifice by Flannery put a runner on third with one out. But the Padres 
failed to score as Templeton again struck out, Kruk (batting for Rasmussen) 
walked, and Roberts ended the inning by popping out to third. 
</P>
<P>
Sebra was replaced by Parrett to start the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"Sebra kept us in the game," Phillie Manager Nick Leyva said. "But I had to 
take him out, he was completely out of gas." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The annual summer free-agent draft will be Monday through Wednesday, and 
Manager Jack McKeon, who became a grandfather for the fourth time Sunday, is 
playing a different kind of expectant father role. His youngest, son Kasey, is 
a senior catcher at San Diego State and has hopes of being drafted. . . . 
Utility infielder Randy Ready, who has not played since May 20 in Philadelphia 
because of a right hamstring injury, should be available to start when the 
Padres begin a three-city, 10-game road trip Friday in Cincinnati, McKeon said. 
Ready strained the muscle May 17 in Montreal. . . . The Padres will not return 
home until June 13, when they open a three-game series with the Reds to kick 
off a 12-game home stand.

KFMB MAKES WINNING PITCH FOR THE PADRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a multi-million-dollar package that sets new standards for the local radio 
industry, KFMB-AM (760) has won a 10-month competition to retain the rights to 
broadcast Padre games, the club announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Although Padre officials refused to comment, KFMB is believed to have paid far 
more than the $2 million it originally bid to air the games for the next five 
years. The deal also includes extensive agreements for KFMB's involvement with 
promotional events, advertising within the stadium and on television and a 
variety of community activities. 
</P>
<P>
Such a contract is unprecedented in San Diego, considering that the station 
will receive no direct income from games. The Padres sell all the advertising 
for the games and keep all the proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes us to a new relationship beyond a straight broadcasting agreement," 
Padre President Dick Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
Both XTRA-AM (690) and KKLQ (FM 106) are believed to have offered more up-front 
money for the radio rights than KFMB. But KFMB was the incumbent in the bidding 
competition, with an 11-year track record of broadcasting Padres games. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question the continuity with KFMB was an important factor," said 
Jim Winters, Padre director of broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
KFMB's biggest competitor most likely was XTRA, which switched to a news-talk 
format last year. John Lynch, president of Noble Broadcasting, wanted to use 
the Padres to make XTRA -- which broadcasts Charger games -- the dominant 
sports station in town. 
</P>
<P>
XTRA's bid was worth $4 million more than KFMB's, Lynch said. His station also 
was offering its strong, 50,000-watt signal. 
</P>
<P>
KFMB only has a 5,000-watt signal but already has approval to boost its evening 
signal to 50,000. KFMB's ratings also are far superior to the fledgling XTRA, 
and it boasts some of the top personalities in local media, including Ted 
Leitner and the morning team of Hudson and Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
KFMB's ability to promote the team year-round and stage proven successful 
promotional events, such as last Sunday's postgame Beach Boys concert, were 
major elements of the station's presentation, KFMB General Manager Paul Palmer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're spending a lot of dollars with the Padres in addition to the cash," 
Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
XTRA was in the running, Lynch said, until a meeting last Wednesday attended by 
representatives of all three stations, the Padre board of directors and team 
owner Joan Kroc. She made it clear, Lynch said, that KFMB was her choice. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said the decision was strictly his own. Kroc didn't return phone calls 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't do anything to overcome 11 years of a relationship and that (Kroc) 
doesn't need to make more money," said Lynch, who said his station's offer of 
"soft" factors, such as advertising and promotions, was worth more than $20 
million. "I'm disappointed, I thought it would be a strictly business decision. 
I feel I've wasted three months on something that was fait accompli." 
</P>
<P>
Lynch has said all along that if the bids were equal, KFMB deserved to get the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
"KFMB and Paul have done a terrific job of building the station and the 
Padres," said Lynch, who worked under Palmer at KFMB for several years before 
moving to XTRA in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike XTRA, Q106 is one of the top-rated stations in the market. But its Top 
40 music format and lack of any sports history probably hurt its chances. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed, but I feel like we were given a fair opportunity to make our 
pitch," Q106 General Manager Bob Bolinger said. 
</P>
<P>
KFMB's new deal with the Padres begins next season. 
</P>
<P>
Several factors extended the bidding process, including the uncertainty in the 
Padres' front office following the sudden departure of President Chub Feeney 
last fall. There also wasa clause in KFMB's current contract giving the station 
exclusive negotiating rights until March 31.

DAVE DISTEL: IF PADRES CAN ANSWER CORRECTLY, A PENNANT COULD BE THEIR PRIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dave Distel 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost in spite of themselves, the Padres remain in the thick of the race in 
the National League West as the calendar flips to June. 
</P>
<P>
What happens in these next 30 days could well determine whether 1989 becomes 
cause for celebration or frustration. 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, a few questions critical to the near and distant future 
for this ballclub. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, I have the answers. 
</P>
<P>
Will the Padres ever make THE trade? 
</P>
<P>
The trade, as we have come to know it over the past few months, would bring 
Dale Murphy to San Diego from Atlanta. That trade will not be made, and that 
might be for the best. Murphy's skills have obviously eroded to the point where 
he would not be worth what he would cost. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, will the Padres make any trade? 
</P>
<P>
 Quite possibly. 
</P>
<P>
How does Jack McKeon feel about it? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to get a couple of hitters," he said, "but there don't seem to be 
any out there." 
</P>
<P>
There aren't? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, I can think of a couple who just spent three days in San Diego. If 
you looked in on the Philadelphia series, you may have unwittingly witnessed a 
preview of some future Padres. 
</P>
<P>
If the trade winds blow, and they have been very quiet hereabouts, Benito 
Santiago (or Sandy Alomar Jr.), Eric Show (or Dennis Rasmussen) and John Kruk 
(or Carmelo Martinez) could be headed for the Phillies in exchange for Von 
Hayes, Chris James and either Steve Bedrosian or Jeff Parrett. 
</P>
<P>
To my mind, Hayes and James are much better than fair hitters. I would suggest 
that some serious conversations with the Phillies might be in order. 
</P>
<P>
Who would play where for the Padres? 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes, one of those guys who can play anywhere, would play center field. He is 
also one of those guys who can bat almost anywhere, though he would likely be 
the No. 2 hitter the Padres need. 
</P>
<P>
With Hayes in center, Tony Gwynn would be moved back to his comfort zone in 
right, and Jack Clark would return to first. 
</P>
<P>
James can play third base, but I would expect that the Padres would use him in 
left field. The third base committee, chaired by Luis Salazar, would remain 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
Either Bedrosian or Parrett would be the right-handed complement to Mark Davis 
in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute. Who would replace Show (or Rasmussen) in the starting rotation? 
</P>
<P>
 You could move Greg Harris from the bullpen into the starting rotation until 
Andy Benes gets here. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Benes? Isn't he still in double-A, in Wichita? 
</P>
<P>
 Sure is, but don't be surprised if his bus never stops at triple-A Las Vegas . 
. . at least not for long. He has been so dominant at double-A, it might well 
be worth taking the chance on whether he just might be ready for the big 
leagues. Jim Abbott has done it. Pencil him into the rotation for mid-to-late 
July. 
</P>
<P>
If Santiago is traded, is Alomar Jr. ready to step in as catcher? 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't necessarily need to. He could be brought along as Mark Parent's 
backup. Parent does the job on defense, and I would be curious how many home 
runs he might hit as a regular rather than Mr. Daytime. 
</P>
<P>
Still, wouldn't the Padres be surrendering quite a bit in a trade such as this? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course. You can't trade three minor leaguers and a player to be born later 
to get the quality of players the Phillies would be surrendering. This trade 
would be a blockbuster. 
</P>
<P>
Is anyone else available? 
</P>
<P>
 You can always start with the New York Yankees. Anyone who has recently 
incurred the wrath of George Steinbrenner is likely available. 
</P>
<P>
These days, third baseman Mike Pagliarulo falls into that category. Put a 
left-handed hitter with that kind of punch behind him in the batting order, and 
Jack Clark might not walk 250 times this year after all. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happened to the Mark Langston deal? 
</P>
<P>
 The Padres were underbid by Montreal. The Padres offered quality players with 
experience, a commodity Seattle apparently did not want. 
</P>
<P>
Remember that the Mariners' owner is George Argyros. That's right, the same 
chap who wanted to buy the Padres two years ago. When Montreal offered three 
minimum-wage pitchers who are years away from being eligible for free agency, 
the deal was sealed. 
</P>
<P>
So Langston is history? 
</P>
<P>
 Not so fast. He will still be a free agent after the 1989 season, and there is 
little likelihood he will opt to stay in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
In the winter of 1989-90, I look for Joan Kroc and Peter O'Malley to go 
purse-to-wallet in the biggest bidding war in the history of free agency. 
</P>
<P>
I'd place my bets on the purse in that one, bringing Langston to the Padres in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
So this is your blueprint? 
</P>
<P>
 Sure is. It should take care of the next two years . . . and beyond.

<P>
Before Wednesday's San Diego Section 2-A baseball championship, Carlsbad High 
Coach Joe Pimentel said catcher Cord "Buck" Taylor was the team's "unsung 
hero." 
</P>
<P>
Pimentel can drop the "unsung." 
</P>
<P>
It was Taylor, one the smallest Lancers at 5-feet-10, 150 pounds, who came 
through with the most prominent hit to lead Carlsbad to its first 2-A title 
with a 7-4 victory over Grossmont at the University of San Diego's Cunningham 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth inning with the bases loaded and the score 3-3, Taylor hit a 
two-run double to right center, the key to a five-run inning that gave Carlsbad 
(23-9) the title. 
</P>
<P>
"(Pitchers) Jeff (Myers) and Scotty (Karl) had been getting all the notoriety 
and publicity," Pimentel said, "and Buck's been a little overlooked. But when 
we got things going, Buck comes up with the big base hit." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, a senior catcher and captain, also had the big hit -- a three-run 
first-inning homer -- in Saturday's 9-0 semifinal victory over Crawford. Taylor 
said it was only the second home run of his life, the other coming earlier this 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a power hitter, I'm usually a singles hitter," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Tell that to Crawford. Tell that to Grossmont (19-9-1), which was also 
appearing in its first 2-A final with first-year Coach Jeff Meredith. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good catcher, we knew that coming in," Meredith said. "We also knew he 
was a good hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont has good hitters, too. The Foothillers collected 10 hits off Myers 
but could not put together for a big inning. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont had two hits in the first, second, third and fifth innings. Eight of 
the nine Grossmont batters had at least one hit -- John Tatum and Danny Lennon 
had two each. 
</P>
<P>
In three playoff games, Tatum was 10 for 11 with two triples and two doubles. 
Entering the game, he had nine consecutive hits, but he struck out his first 
time up. 
</P>
<P>
"We hit the ball well, but we couldn't put the hits together," Meredith said. 
"When (Myers) needed to get tough, he did. I'll give him the credit. He did a 
real fine job. Kent Smith struck out two times all year, and (Myers) struck him 
out twice today." 
</P>
<P>
Smith's second strikeout was Myers' eighth (fourth in the final two innings) 
and the final out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to throw as hard as I could," said Myers, a senior who is headed 
for Pepperdine. "I went out there with the attitude that I'm not going to let 
up unless I drop dead. Ever since I've been at Carlsbad, this is what I've 
wanted." 
</P>
<P>
It took Myers (12-3) 107 pitches, 69 strikes, but he did it. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't struggling," Taylor said. "He was making good pitches. They were 
just hitting them. They were probably the best hitting team we played." 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom of the first, Grossmont loaded the bases with no outs. Greg 
Layson and Lenny Van Every singled, and Todd Cady was aboard on Carlsbad's only 
error. Taylor then caught Cady wandering too far off first, but Layson scored 
while Cady was in a rundown. Myers then struck out Smith and Tatum. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad took a 2-1 lead in the third. Leadoff hitter Bryan Black (two for 
three, two runs and an RBI) drove home Ron Bynes (two for three) with a triple 
that one-hopped against the center-field fence. Black scored on a grounder by 
Myers. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont regained the lead, 3-2, in the bottom of the third. Van Every, who 
had walked, scored on Tatum's single to right, and Smith, who had singled, 
scored on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the fifth and Carlsbad's five runs. Black led off with a bunt single. 
Larry Griffith grounded to second, but Lennon made a throwing error trying to 
get Black at second. Myers was intentionally walked, and pinch-hitter Chris 
Greene walked to force home Black and tie the score, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor hit the first pitch from starter Mark Gapski (8-3) into the gap in right 
center. That was all for Gapski, who had thrown a three-hitter in Saturday's 
10-0 semifinal victory over Rancho Buena Vista and 1 1/3 innings in the 19-7 
victory over St. Augustine the previous Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Lennon came on in relief and was greeted with a two-run single by Brian Vasey, 
giving the Lancers a 7-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont scored one more in its half of the fifth. Cady tripled to right 
center and scored on a sacrifice fly by Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Myers retired the final six batters.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO; 
</P>
<P>
UCSD JAZZ DIRECTOR TO JOIN PROTEGES IN PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jimmy Cheatham, the San Diego trombonist who leads the Sweet Baby Blues Band 
with wife, Jeannie, a vocalist and pianist, will make a rare appearance before 
a San Diego audience next Wednesday, putting the UC San Diego Jazz Ensemble 
through its paces in a show at Mandeville Auditorium on campus. Cheatham is a 
professor of music at UCSD, directing the jazz program. 
</P>
<P>
Can San Diegans expect to hear him play? 
</P>
<P>
"They'll hear me play the orchestra," joked Cheatham, who wants the jazz 
program at UCSD to be "strongly based in the black musical experience, the 
Kansas City style, from Bennie Moten to Count Basie and Fletcher Henderson, 
from Ellington to Thad Jones." 
</P>
<P>
The performance will showcase Cheatham's proteges in a variety of formats, from 
a 25- to 30-piece big band that includes an Afro-Cuban percussion section, to 
solos and duos. "Lucumi Macumba Voodoo," something of a production number, even 
includes singers and calypso dancers. 
</P>
<P>
During the show, Cheatham will hand out awards to the students, including one 
from the National Assn. of Jazz Educators that the ensemble received at last 
January's NAJE convention in San Diego, along with several school awards for 
best individual and group performances during the year. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Sweet Baby Blues Band, its fourth and newest album, "Back to the 
Neighborhood," has generated heavy demand. For the uninitiated, the band's 
all-star lineup includes trumpeters Snooky Young and Clora Bryant; reed men 
Dinky Morris, Jimmie Noone, Curtis Peagley and sometimes Herman Riley, plus Red 
Callender on bass and John (Ironman) Harris on drums. They will be gone most of 
the summer touring, with stops later this month at Joe Siegel's Jazz Showcase 
in Chicago and the Blue Note in New York City, where they set house attendance 
records last September. 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans hungry for a dose of Baby Blues should consider a trip to Hollywood 
this Friday or Saturday night, where the band plays the Vine Street Bar &amp; 
Grill. Tickets for the UCSD show are $5, or $3 for senior citizens and 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Jazz clarinet players haven't had an easy go of it in the latter half of this 
century. When big bands gave way to be-bop in the '40s, the clarinet didn't 
make the transition as readily as trumpets and saxes. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, clarinetist Buddy DeFranco, who opened a two-week run at Elario's 
with vibraphonist Terry Gibbs on Wednesday night, stood by his instrument. 
Unlike Benny Goodman, DeFranco was one of the few clarinet players to expand 
his repertoire into the realm of bop, a challenge on an instrument that 
requires precise technique. 
</P>
<P>
After spending the '40s in several of the major big bands, he joined Count 
Basie for two years, beginning in 1950, then led his own small groups through 
the '50s. He spent eight years with the Glenn Miller Orchestra, then formed a 
group with Gibbs in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs, a veteran of the big bands of Woody Herman, Tommy Dorsey and Benny 
Goodman, played in smaller groups with Sam Jones, Louis Hayes and Kenny 
Burrell, among others. His aggressive, precise mallet attack provides both 
rhythmic and melodic counterpoint to DeFranco's horn. It's an unusual and 
provocative pairing. 
</P>
<P>
You must have heard San Diego jazz pianist Randy Porter somewhere, in a duo at 
the Horton Grand Hotel, or backing local players such as Steve Feierabend, or 
in Palm Desert recently, behind jazz singer Diane Schuur. He'll also be on 
stage with her in August at Humphrey's. 
</P>
<P>
At 26, Porter is shaping a promising career. For a young musician, he shows 
surprising taste and restraint, his solos are melodic and never cluttered, his 
backup work is sparse, with just enough chords and embellishments to push a 
soloist. 
</P>
<P>
Porter was exposed to both jazz and classical music at an early age by his 
older brother, also a musician. In 10th grade at Hoover High School in San 
Diego, he hesitantly volunteered to solo during a school big band practice 
session. Afterward, the instructor came over and laid a penny on the piano, a 
rarely given sign of approval. 
</P>
<P>
Though Porter's tendency is toward the straight-ahead side of jazz, he has 
dabbled in electronics and fusion. He was a member of Hollis Gentry's Neon 
until about a year ago, and wrote two of the songs on the band's new album: 
"Jacoby Creek" and "Song for Symon." 
</P>
<P>
Porter writes often. He recently recorded 11 originals with Hank Dobbs on bass 
and Billy Mintz on drums. Sometime soon, he may make cassettes of the session 
available. You can hear him June 12 at Croce's downtown with an acoustic 
quartet, and Fridays through June with singer Ellen Johnson at the Bucharest 
restaurant in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Hiroshima, whose music is a slick fusion of traditional Japanese music 
and instruments with jazz and modern electronics, appears June 7 and 8 at 
Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay. The group just finished performing the 
autobiographical musical "Sansei" at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. Its 
new album is titled "East.". . . . San Diego jazz guitarist Peter Sprague plays 
June 2 with a quintet at the Book Works/Pannikin at Flower Hill Mall in Del Mar 
and June 4 with JazzBrasil, including singer Kevyn Lettau, at the Full Moon 
Cafe, 485 1st St., Encinitas. . . . Those who heard Joe Henderson and George 
Cables during their recent two-week gig at Elario's seemed to agree that the 
real chemistry was not between the two headliners, but between pianist Cables 
and bassist Marshall Hawkins. . . . San Diego flutist Lori Bell was the guest 
on KIFM's mainstream jazz show Sunday night, and the music selected by her and 
host Steve Huntington included a quirky version of Kermit the Frog's song about 
being green, sung by pianist Dave Mackay, Bell's frequent musical partner.

GLENDALE PROPOSAL; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET PLAN CALLS FOR 61 NEW WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reflecting the city's need for improved services to keep up with its soaring 
population growth, Glendale's preliminary budget released Tuesday calls for the 
addition of 61 new full-time employees, almost five times the number proposed 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the proposed $243-million spending plan are 16 new positions in the 
Police Department, five in the Fire Department, seven in the city's building 
permit and plan check operations, four for service improvements in urban 
forestry activities and five for a proposed program dedicated to neighborhood 
beautification. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's budget proposal called for 13 new city jobs. City Manager David 
Ramsay said the emphasis on service improvements in the spending plan reflects 
the changes taking place in the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Getting Bigger' 
</P>
<P>
"Glendale is changing, it's getting bigger, and we need to maintain the quality 
of services," he said. "In order to maintain the appearance of a quality 
community, we have to upgrade our code enforcement operations and our level of 
public safety." 
</P>
<P>
Ramsay cited the sharp increase of graffiti throughout the city as an example 
of the new challenges facing Glendale. He said the added police officers and 
the proposed neighborhood services unit would go a long way in solving the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
The budget represents an 11% increase over the existing $220-million budget and 
allocates $20 million to capital improvement funds, an increase of about $4.3 
million, or 27%, over last year. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the preliminary budget are allocations of $1.5 million for 
yet-to-be-determined historic-site acquisitions, $1 million for open space 
acquisition for future recreational facilities in the Verdugo and San Rafael 
mountains, $3.7 million for street and traffic improvement programs, $750,000 
for construction of a new fire station and $400,000 for the Civic Auditorium 
renovation. 
</P>
<P>
Study sessions are scheduled before the council votes on the spending plan in 
late June. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Budget Balanced 
</P>
<P>
Expenses and revenue in the budget are balanced, and the city is expected to 
continue to operate without general obligation bonds. Almost $9 million in new 
revenue is expected from an increase in the utility users tax from 5% to 7%, 
and from rate increases of 100% for sewer services and 30% for refuse services. 
</P>
<P>
The utility tax hike was approved in 1978, but its implementation has been 
postponed annually by the council. 
</P>
<P>
The refuse rate increase, the third in three years, will be used to finance 
increased recycling and waste reduction programs. The sewer fee increase will 
be used to pay the city's share of capital improvements to the Hyperion sewage 
treatment plant operated by the city of Los Angeles.

SCRABBLE FANS FIND GAME A MARRIAGE OF CHALLENGE, DISCIPLINE, MENTAL STIMULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Under rows of harsh fluorescent lights, they sit at folding tables, hunched 
over boards covered with small, square tiles. 
</P>
<P>
The room is silent as 10 pairs of players sweat it out in a battle of wits, 
probing their minds for obscure words and letter combinations. 
</P>
<P>
They're playing Scrabble, but this is not exactly the game that many people 
remember playing with their grandmothers over pound cake and iced tea on Sunday 
afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
These are hard-core Scrabble players, many of whom also play chess, who enjoy 
the game for its challenge, discipline and mental stimulation. 
</P>
<P>
And they take their games seriously, memorizing hundreds of obscure words and 
mastering strategies and lingo. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagle Rock Scrabble Club was started in July by George Heussenstamm, a 
classical composer who teaches music composition and theory at Cal State Los 
Angeles and Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
300 U.S. Clubs 
</P>
<P>
The club, one of more than 300 in the United States, meets from 7 to 10 p.m. 
the second and fourth Wednesday of the month in the Yosemite Senior Center. 
</P>
<P>
Members pay $1 for admission, which covers Heussenstamm's mailings and the 
cookies and coffee provided at the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
When Heussenstamm, a veteran Scrabble aficionado, started the club, there were 
only a handful of players. 
</P>
<P>
Now the group averages 17, and he expects it to grow, following a national 
trend of increasing interest in the game, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something of an obsession," Heussenstamm said. "It's the kind of thing 
that once you start, it's hard to stop." 
</P>
<P>
The club is an eclectic mix of people. At one table, a thin, dark man is 
listening through earphones to a portable tape player, moving his head slightly 
as his eyes flicker back and forth across his tiles. 
</P>
<P>
His opponent is an unemployed Vietnam veteran who is also an avid chess player. 
</P>
<P>
At another table, a 22-year-old physics major from Occidental College is 
battling a heavyset woman who is an administrator with the Los Angeles school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Highly Organized 
</P>
<P>
Scrabble clubs are highly organized and strictly follow a set of Scrabble rules 
promulgated by Scrabble Crossword Game Players Inc., a national organization. 
</P>
<P>
Games are timed using chess clocks, and each player is allowed three minutes 
per move. And the players are serious about their games and strategies. 
</P>
<P>
Like chess, Scrabble entails strategic planning. 
</P>
<P>
Players learn rack management, a method of keeping a balance of vowels and 
consonants. Good players also have to know when to pass their turn, and how to 
work toward bingos -- a move in which all seven letters are used in one turn. 
But the most important strategy is building vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
True Scrabble aficionados fervently study their Official Scrabble Players 
Dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
They pore over lists of words, memorizing thousands of two- and three-letter 
words and their possible prefixes and suffixes to help them in their 
strategies. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the word lists are so obscure that they almost look like random pages 
from a beginning Latin handbook. 
</P>
<P>
Scrabble players learn such oddities as "os," meaning orifice; "ta," an 
expression of gratitude, and "ho," an exclamation of surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"The key is in knowing your words," Heussenstamm said. "You have to build a big 
vocabulary if you want to be good at this game. It involves more than just 
slapping letters on a board." 
</P>
<P>
Someone bellows "challenge" from the far corner of the room, and Heussenstamm 
scurries away to settle the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Heussenstamm started the club in Eagle Rock because he wanted to be able to 
play in a group close to his La Crescenta home. 
</P>
<P>
But as director, he has duties to fulfill. 
</P>
<P>
If an even number of players show up, Heussenstamm doesn't play, and he must 
act as referee in the case of disputed words. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been somewhat sacrificial for me," Heussenstamm said. "I don't get to 
play much any more." 
</P>

DECADE OF LA CANADA FUND-RAISING; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION FOUNDATION CELEBRATES A MILESTONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It's not like building a church," said the president of the La Canada 
Flintridge Educational Foundation. "This we have to do year after year after 
year." 
</P>
<P>
The foundation, one of dozens that emerged in California after property 
tax-cutting Proposition 13 shattered traditional school financing, raises 
private money for public schools. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the La Canada Flintridge group reached a milestone, its first 
decade. The tenacity of the group's volunteers and the strength of its method 
have apparently made the foundation a permanent facet of school financing in 
the affluent suburb of 22,800 residents. 
</P>
<P>
One of about 130 such organizations in the state, the La Canada Flintridge 
group has remained one of the most successful. 
</P>
<P>
This year, it plans to top its goal of $225,000, bringing the total funds that 
it has raised for education to about $2 million, said Meredith B. Reynolds, 
foundation president. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Every-Day Effort 
</P>
<P>
"We are actively raising money almost every day," said Reynolds, who is about 
to step down from her one-year post. "But we'll be back on their doorsteps come 
September." 
</P>
<P>
Through its efforts, the foundation contributes about the same amount of money 
as the California Lottery to the La Canada Unified School District's annual 
$15-million budget, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike many other educational foundations that rely on professionals to run 
their operations -- such as Beverly Hills and San Marino -- the La Canada group 
is supported by volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no paid staff," Reynolds said. "We have some of the most important 
people in Los Angeles on our board, and most of them probably never stuffed 
envelopes before in their lives. But they do it for us." 
</P>
<P>
The professional and diversified expertise of directors is a key to the group's 
success, Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Volunteers 
</P>
<P>
Each year, about a third of the 30-member board steps down, to be replaced by 
new volunteers selected as a cross-representation of the community. 
</P>
<P>
The organization's bylaws are designed "to keep the board fresh and truly 
representative of the community," said Reynolds, who describes herself as "an 
attorney turned housewife." The constant turnover brings "new ideas, new 
energy" to the team. 
</P>
<P>
The number of educational foundations in the state has doubled in the last 
seven years as more and more districts search for new ways to supplement their 
ever-tightening budgets. But those that succeed represent only a smattering of 
the more than 1,000 school districts in California -- usually in small 
communities "that are fairly affluent," said Terry McAlpine, a spokeswoman for 
the Los Angeles County Office of Education. 
</P>
<P>
The La Canada group supports a close-knit district with only two elementary 
schools, one high school, a continuation school and a special education campus. 
Total enrollment is 3,100, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A similar group formed to support the neighboring Glendale Unified School 
District, with a growing enrollment of more than 22,000 on 27 campuses, 
disbanded in about 1982 after only four years in existence, district officials 
said. The giant Los Angeles Unified School District also has no private 
fund-raising arm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Year-Round Volunteers 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds estimates that at least 100 volunteers actively participate in the La 
Canada organization year-round. Many of them offer professional services, such 
as specially designed fund-raising "pitches" that were written by promotional 
experts to "sell" the program to different classes of potential donors. 
</P>
<P>
"We have one of the better school districts in the state," Reynolds said, 
citing state test scores that consistently place district students in the 98th 
percentile or better in reading, writing and mathematics proficiency. "We know 
we have to look to our own community to keep it that way." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds said fund-raisers rely on the district's record to generate support 
for public schools from all sectors of the community, including donors without 
children, professionals, businesses and parents whose children attend private 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, about 700 to 1,000 donors contribute to the annual fund-raising in 
the community, which has about 6,000 families, 2,000 of them with children 
attending local schools, Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fund-Raising Events 
</P>
<P>
As many as 350 volunteers are recruited to work in the group's half a dozen 
fund-raising events each year, such as a back-to-school night program in which 
a spokesman for the foundation is placed in every classroom in the district. 
</P>
<P>
"This definitely is a labor-intense organization," said Reynolds, who pointed 
out that volunteers are common in the city, where the council and all of the 
commissioners hold unpaid positions. Parent volunteers account for more than 
10,000 hours of documented work in the schools, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds said other educational foundations have recently contacted La Canada, 
seeking the secret to its success. "The pressures are very great on educational 
foundations right now because the money is so tight from Sacramento," she said. 
"Organizations are sitting back and saying, 'How can we be more effective?' " 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills Education Foundation, one of the leading fund-raisers for 
lower public education, raises from $400,000 to $500,000 a year, but spends 
about $127,000 on its annual operating budget, according to Pat Berman, 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Business Donations 
</P>
<P>
The La Canada group, in contrast, spends less than $10,000 of the money that it 
raises each year on operations, largely for printing and mailing costs. Most 
other expenses, such as T-shirts for a jog-a-thon and food and wine for a 
fund-raising gourmet dinner, are donated by local businesses, Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
Telephones, manned by up to 100 volunteers for some fund-raising programs, are 
provided by Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a strong supporter of the foundation. 
Many JPL employees live in the city and their children attend local schools. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate support for local school districts is becoming increasingly important 
nationwide, according to the National School Boards Assn., which estimates that 
more than 1,000 educational foundations supplement public school districts. 
</P>
<P>
"There may not be a lot of individual money for schools, but there still is a 
lot of corporate money out there," said William Tanner, a researcher for the 
national association. "During the last few years, we've seen more and more 
support from corporate America for the local schools, especially in California 
with all of its high-tech business. 
</P>
<P>
"They see the children in the schools as their workers of the future."

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE;

<P>
NEW SPENDING BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 227 to 197, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 2072) to 
increase spending this fiscal year by $3.7 billion. The so-called dire 
emergency supplemental bill funds several programs that are running out of 
money and others that are politically popular. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats generally defended the spending as necessary to keep vital programs 
in operation, while most Republicans complained that the bill violates 
deficit-reduction agreements. President Bush has threatened a veto. 
</P>
<P>
Major outlays are $1.2 billion for veterans, $892 million for student loans, 
$822 million for anti-drug initiatives, $423 million for foster care and $342 
million for fighting last year's forest fires. The bill also provides more 
money for the homeless and unemployed, legislative branch operations and 
agencies such as the Agriculture Department and Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Jamie Whitten (D-Miss.) said: "Give us this bill, which takes care of 
drugs, which takes care of veterans. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Silvio Conte (R-Mass.) said: "Here we go again, spending as if there 
were no tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

GOP Substitute 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 205 to 217, the House rejected a Republican attempt to strip the 
$3.7-billion appropriations bill (above) of all spending except $1.2 billion 
for veterans programs including medical care. The motion expressed GOP and 
White House complaints that the Democratic majority was using popular veterans 
spending to run interference for unwarranted increases this fiscal year in 
other programs. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Gerald Solomon (R-N.Y.) said: "The veterans package is still being 
used as the engine to drive this monstrosity through the Congress." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Neal Smith (D-Iowa) said members voting yes "are voting against 
enhancing and speeding up the war on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted the bill to fund only veterans programs.

Spending Priorities 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 205 to 213, the House defeated a bill (HR 2442) to increase 
anti-drug spending at the expense of the Strategic Defense Initiative missile 
system. Next fiscal year's SDI appropriation was to have been frozen at this 
year's level, freeing up $862 million for immediate transfer to anti-drug 
programs. The bill was to have been joined with the Senate-bound supplemental 
appropriations bill for fiscal 1989 (see preceding votes). 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) said the amendment shifts money "from an 
inflated program we do not need, Star Wars, to an under-funded initiative we 
cannot ignore, drug wars." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Duncan L. Hunter (R-Coronado) said: "Let's not start tearing the 
country apart and saying that only the liberal left on defense can participate 
actively in the drug war." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to transfer $862 million from SDI to anti-drug 
programs.

CARBALLO CLEANS UP FOR CS LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jay Carballo is a dirt bag. 
</P>
<P>
At least, that's what Carballo's teammates on the Cal State Long Beach baseball 
team think of the junior shortstop from Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're a dirt bag, you put your nose in the ball, knock anything down 
that's hit to you, and if you get hurt, you stay in the game and just tough it 
out," second baseman Chris Gill says. "Jay definitely has the dirt-bag 
attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Carballo is not alone. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach campus baseball facility underwent season-long repairs, which 
forced the team to practice on softball fields and Pony League fields that 
often featured crater-pocked all-dirt infields. 
</P>
<P>
The vagabond existence toughened all of the players and made the 49ers a team 
full of self-described dirt bags who have been cleaning up on opponents all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, Long Beach completed a four-game sweep of the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. West I Regional at Tucson, Ariz., to advance to the 44th College 
World Series in Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach is seeded seventh in the eight-team double-elimination tournament 
that begins Friday at Rosenblatt Stadium. Top-seeded Florida State (52-16) 
plays No. 8 North Carolina (41-16-1) and No. 4 Wichita State (63-15) meets No. 
5 Arkansas (50-14) in opening-day play. 
</P>
<P>
Miami (48-16), which is No. 3, meets No. 6 Louisiana State (52-15) Saturday 
after the game between Long Beach (50-13) and No. 2 Texas (51-17). 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone expected us to have this kind of success this season," 
Carballo said following Monday's 10-3 victory over Arizona that clinched the 
regional title. "We played terrible during the fall, but one day, all of a 
sudden, everything just clicked." 
</P>
<P>
One of the keys to 49ers' good fortune has been the steady play of Carballo, a 
former standout at St. Francis High and Glendale College who transferred to 
Long Beach on a football scholarship last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Carballo, a redshirt defensive back last season, has tackled the task of 
quarterbacking the 49ers' infield, one of the team's biggest strengths. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times when Jay plays with a little bit of that football mentality, 
but I like that," says Long Beach Coach Dave Snow. "He doesn't say a whole hell 
of a lot, but he goes out there and gets after it. He's been a real unsung hero 
in this team's success." 
</P>
<P>
Under Snow, who replaced John Gonsalves as coach last June after four 
successful seasons at Loyola Marymount, Long Beach has enjoyed a remarkable 
turnaround from last season's 14-45 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Snow, in fact, was the principle reason Carballo opted to sign a letter of 
intent to play football at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no baseball coach at Long Beach during most of the period that I was 
deciding what I was going to do," Carballo said. "When I found out that Long 
Beach had named a coach, and I heard 'Dave Snow,' that made my decision." 
</P>
<P>
During the fall, Carballo alternated practicing with the football and baseball 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Each morning, Long Beach assistant coach Dave Malpass kept Carballo sharp by 
hitting him hundreds of ground balls during individual workouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I had always been taught to just catch the ball and throw the runner out," 
Carballo said. "But when I started working with Dave in the morning, I learned 
that there are a lot of little things that make it easier. 
</P>
<P>
"He hit me ground balls for hours -- I was dying. It was harder than any 
football practice." 
</P>
<P>
The work, however, apparently paid off. 
</P>
<P>
Carballo, who is batting .260, began the season at third base, but was moved to 
shortstop when Alberto Guerra broke his leg in the 16th game of the season. 
Carballo has committed just 10 errors. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I was concerned, he was our best defensive shortstop from the 
beginning," Malpass said. "But as a defensive unit, we needed Jay to play 
third. 
</P>
<P>
"He's tough and competitive and that's the kind of thing that wins." 
</P>
<P>
Excellent pitching also brings victories and Long Beach has plenty in junior 
left-hander Kyle Abbott (15-2, 2.37 earned-run average) and freshman 
right-hander Andy Croghan (12-0, 3.25). 
</P>
<P>
Strong pitching, excellent defense and timely hitting were all in evidence as 
Long Beach began the season by winning its first 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach went on to tie Fresno State for a share of its first Big West 
Conference title and gained its first playoff berth since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I could do this well," Carballo said. "Now I think I can do 
better -- same thing for the team. 
</P>
<P>
"We started the season 18-0. It was like a dream. If we can finish playing the 
same way, I guess the dream will be complete."

<P>
UCLA WOMEN'S SOFTBALL COACH PUTS SUCCESS IN PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA women's softball Coach Sharron Backus is beginning to learn the lesson 
that John Wooden learned when his Bruin basketball teams were in the midst of 
winning 10 NCAA championships: 
</P>
<P>
Success may breed more success, but it also fosters pressure and anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
Backus, whose Bruins last week won their sixth NCAA championship in her 14 
years as coach, said any talk of a dynasty makes her recall what the Wizard of 
Westwood said when he heard similar talk. 
</P>
<P>
"John Wooden once said that he wished one national championship to his best 
friends, but four to his enemies." 
</P>
<P>
Backus is well aware of what it's like to be the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
Her team defeated Fresno State, 1-0, in the final of the NCAA Division I 
College World Series and won five straight games in the tournament at Fresno. 
The victories gave her a career record of 485-113-3, including a 57-12 mark in 
postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to six national titles for her UCLA teams -- five in the 1980s, the 
sixth in 1978 -- they also have two second-place and two third-place national 
finishes. 
</P>
<P>
Such success has its pleasures, but apparently it also has drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Backus said that winning teams may create "the environment to be successful" 
but that success also "makes it difficult to keep things in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to put pressure on yourself and the players, (but it happens, 
nevertheless). And yet the girls played very well. They hung together and were 
just a real pleasure at the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
She said that UCLA's winning tradition has long attracted winning athletes and 
that the success has made recruiting even easier and also given the softball 
program "visibility, things you work hard for. 
</P>
<P>
"Then comes the self-imposed pressure to top yourself each year, and this year 
was very hard emotionally on me and the players." 
</P>
<P>
Next year's topper could be a third straight NCAA championship. Backus' Bruins 
have won back-to-back titles this year and last and also in 1984-85. 
</P>
<P>
But it won't be easy. Backus must find replacements for a group of star seniors 
that includes pitcher Samantha Ford, third baseman Janice Parks, catcher Monica 
Tourville and shortstop Karen Walker. 
</P>
<P>
The hardest to replace may be Parks. 
</P>
<P>
An All-American for the third straight season, Parks batted more than .400 this 
season -- in a sport where a .270 hitter is considered good. She also 
established a flock of career and single-season hitting records. 
</P>
<P>
Backus said that she will probably use two players at third base next year: 
sophomore Kerry Dienelt, who will move from first base, and incoming freshman 
Lisa Fernandez, the pitching and hitting star from St. Joseph High School in 
Lakewood. Junior utility player and pinch hitter Shelley Montgomery will take 
over for Dienelt at first base. Returning on the mound will be the team's two 
aces: junior Lisa Longaker (18-1) and Tiffany Boyd (19-2). Boyd capped a 
sensational freshman season by winning three games in the World Series, 
including a no-hitter in the opener against South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
But Ford will be missed not only for her pitching skills but for her 
competitive fire. She overcame arm problems and had a strong senior season. She 
pitched a perfect game during the regular season (against Oregon State), shut 
out Cal Poly Pomona, 9-0, in the World Series and finished with an 11-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
"Sammie had arm problems early in her career, but this year she really came 
into the season ready and hellbent to do well -- and she did," Backus said. 
"She is also one of the few athletes in my program who will graduate in four 
years, which is a real credit to her. She's a winner." 
</P>
<P>
Parks, Boyd and Dienelt were named to the All-World Series team, as were 
sophomore second baseman Missy Phillips and sophomore center fielder Lorraine 
Maynez, the team's hottest hitter in the series. Maynez set series records with 
a .588 batting average (10 for 17) and six runs scored and tied another with 
four hits in one game (against Cal Poly Pomona). 
</P>
<P>
Other regulars returning include sophomore right fielder Shanna Flynn and left 
fielder Yvonne Gutierrez, a freshman from Culver City High School. Flynn was 
named a second-team All-American this season, and Backus said that Gutierrez 
often provided key base hits. 
</P>
<P>
Since Backus will have plenty of pitching in Longaker and Boyd, Fernandez and a 
couple of other recruits who starred as pitchers in high school probably will 
play mostly in the infield and outfield. 
</P>
<P>
The other top pitchers she recruited are Heather Compton of Righetti High 
School in Santa Maria and DeDe Weiman of Gahr High in Cerritos. Compton's 
sister Tracy was one of the best pitchers ever to play for Backus at UCLA, and 
the coach said that Heather is "the same kind of power pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
All three are excellent hitters as well, and Backus said that Fernandez "is 
probably the premiere hitter" of the trio. 
</P>
<P>
Another top freshman will be catcher-utility player Maria Rodriguez of Corona 
del Mar High in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
So the top players continue to come to UCLA, the beat will be expected to go 
on, and fans will be clamoring for a third straight national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Backus will just have to hope that the increased pressure from all that noise 
and from having to don one crown after another doesn't give her a king-sized 
headache.

JAIL'S AMBIENCE KEEPS INMATES IN LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you gotta do time, this is the place. 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Valley Work Camp, a minimum-security jail that opened May 1, is 
nestled in a picturesque glen at the foot of the Topa Topa Mountains, ruggedly 
beautiful terrain about half an hour north of Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
Only a six-foot-high chain-link fence, topped with a few strands of barbed 
wire, separates the camp from the outside world. The small Quonset huts that 
serve as bunkhouses don't even have locks. And inmates, most of whom are there 
for drug- or alcohol-related offenses, are given time to watch TV, play 
Ping-Pong, shoot pool, lift weights or toss horseshoes on the 10-acre grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, I haven't wanted to leave," said Doug Webb, 24, who is about halfway 
through a nine-month sentence for being under the influence of cocaine and for 
possession of the drug. "You get to be outside. You can get a tan. It's like a 
summer vacation camp." 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Sheriff's Department, however, makes sure that nobody's stay 
gets too cushy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bold Experiment 
</P>
<P>
In what officials describe as a bold experiment in rehabilitation, the relaxed 
security at Rose Valley is balanced by character-building, boot camp-style 
training. 
</P>
<P>
It's rise and shine at 5:50 a.m., followed by a brisk jog and calisthenics. 
Beds must be made tight enough for a quarter to bounce. Work boots are buffed 
every day to a shine. And everyone puts in a full eight hours of work, which 
for now mostly entails readying the camp to handle the 160 inmates who will 
eventually be housed there. 
</P>
<P>
"Self-esteem is the key up here," Assistant Sheriff Richard S. Bryce told a 
group of reporters touring the facility last week. "We want to help them 
realize they're viable people, that they're worth something. . . . It's not a 
country club. It's hard work." 
</P>
<P>
It's also a fairly inexpensive way to ease pressure on the county's badly 
overcrowded jail system, which has been at the center of often-rancorous debate 
lately. The main Ventura facility, which was designed to hold 400 inmates, 
houses about 1,100. And county officials are at odds over where a new prison 
should be built. 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Valley camp, which cost $311,000, siphons off inmates from the Honor 
Farm branch jail in Ojai, the county's only other minimum-security facility. 
There, about 400 men and women serve sentences while growing crops, doing 
carpentry and raising about 1,000 hogs for slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nonviolent Backgrounds 
</P>
<P>
In selecting inmates for Rose Valley, deputies say they look for people with 
the least violent backgrounds and the least criminal sophistication, whose main 
problem has been an addiction to drugs or alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
As part of their stay at the work camp, inmates, whose sentences range from 30 
days to about a year, must submit to random drug testing and are encouraged to 
attend drug and alcohol education classes. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to be willing to cooperate," Sheriff John V. Gillespie said. "If 
they screw up, they're sent back. They know there's no second chance." 
</P>
<P>
The camp's congenial atmosphere probably wasn't what White House drug czar 
William J. Bennett had in mind when he endorsed federal boot camps for drug 
offenders last month. 
</P>
<P>
"The recidivism is very, very low because it is so grueling and so unpleasant, 
people don't want to go back to it," Bennett told reporters on "Face the 
Nation," the Sunday morning news program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Constructive Experience 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie, while advocating tough discipline at the camp, said he wants Rose 
Valley to be a constructive experience. 
</P>
<P>
The camp, for instance, has a wood shop called "Santa's Workshop," where 
inmates use scrap lumber to make hobbyhorses and trains for needy children. In 
the cafeteria, inmates are allowed to serve themselves and may return for 
seconds. Visits from relatives may last three hours and can include a "simple 
kiss and hug," according to posted rules, "but definitely not more avid 
contact." 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, Gillespie said, the inmates can take satisfaction in having spent 
40,000 hours since August renovating the facility, which until 1972 was a U.S. 
Navy training base for Seabees. Framed color photos posted in front of the 
barracks show the mess that was cleared by the inmates, whose work was 
estimated to have saved the county $2 million to $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of you," Gillespie told about a dozen inmates who were standing at 
military attention the other day. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you, sir," one of them barked. 
</P>
<P>
Add neatly mowed lawns, flower beds, welcome mats in front of the bunk houses 
and hundreds of swallows darting back and forth in the soft breeze and, well, 
if you gotta do time. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"This is the place," said Mike Holmes, 23, of Port Hueneme, who completes his 
sentence in two weeks. "They expect a little more out of you, but you can't 
beat the view." 
</P>

INCREASED SUPPORT GOES TO NEW AND EXISTING FACILITIES; 
</P>
<P>
SUPERVISORS OK $2.3 MILLION FOR AIDS HOSPICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors has committed another $2.38 million over three 
years to AIDS hospices, voting Tuesday to support new shelters in Pomona and 
Willowbrook and to back existing ones in Van Nuys and central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The new three-year commitments, approved amid complaints that the county's AIDS 
program is moving too slowly, extends hospice funding to mid-1992. The action 
comes close to fulfilling pledges by the supervisors a year ago to spend $2 
million annually on shelters for patients with acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beds Increased by 16 
</P>
<P>
The funding package increases the number of county-supported hospice beds from 
21 to 37 at a cost of about $50,000 each per year, or $1.85 million for 37. 
</P>
<P>
In all, there are about 100 beds in AIDS hospices countywide, most of them paid 
for by private contributions or the patients themselves. About 6,900 AIDS cases 
have been confirmed in the county, including almost 4,500 that ended in death, 
since the county began keeping statistics on the disease. 
</P>
<P>
While increasing its support Tuesday, the supervisors extended for only two 
months its contract with the Padua House hospice in downtown Long Beach. It 
also withdrew funding from Hughes House in the West Hollywood area, which ran 
out of money and closed last week. 
</P>
<P>
Though both facilities are run by the same organization, the county withheld 
long-term support for different reasons, said John Schunhoff, assistant 
director of the County AIDS Office. 
</P>
<P>
A management shake-up at Hospice/Los Angeles-Long Beach has left in doubt who 
holds the lease for the Padua House, so that contract will not be renewed, 
Schunhoff said. Under a formula that sets aside eight hospice beds -- or 
$400,000 a year -- for each of five supervisorial districts, the Padua House is 
now receiving the full eight-bed allotment for the 4th District, a coastal 
strip between Orange and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lost Its Contract 
</P>
<P>
Hospices will be asked to bid for the 4th District funds in June, Schunhoff 
said. County payments should begin a month or two after that, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hughes House lost its $100,000-a-year contract because the county chose to 
award the full $400,000 allocation for the 3rd District to a 25-bed regional 
facility at Barlow Hospital in Elysian Park. However, the Hughes House is in 
line for state funds and could reopen as a shelter for AIDS patients who are 
not near death, he said. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS activists, while pleased with increased hospice funding from the county, 
cite the withdrawal of support for Hughes House as an example of the 
shortcomings of the county's policy of district-by-district allocations. They 
say it does not take into account the concentration of most AIDS cases in a few 
areas, especially West Hollywood and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
John Maceri, president of Hospice/Los Angeles-Long Beach, and others have asked 
that hospice money set aside for one district but not spent, be placed in a 
pool to provide care in other districts where hospice beds already exist. 
</P>
<P>
That point was made by members of the county AIDS Commission last week, when it 
asked Chief Administrative Officer Richard Dixon to find out how much hospice 
money in this year's budget has not been spent. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand the (political) reason for the distribution," Maceri said. "The 
problem is . . . that Supervisor (Ed) Edelman's district has the highest 
concentration of cases in the county, but he has the same amount of money that 
(Supervisor) Pete Schabarum has." 
</P>
<P>
Schunhoff said -- counting this week's allocations -- $1.1 million of the 
$2-million hospice budget will have been spent for beds when the 1988-89 fiscal 
year ends June 30. Another $550,000 is being spent for other AIDS services, 
such as setting up an AIDS ward at Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center and 
providing anti-AIDS drugs to area clinics and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
About $350,000, or 18% of the $2 million, will not be spent this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of this delay has to do with getting new programs up and running," 
Schunhoff said. "There has to be a lead time." 
</P>
<P>
Schunhoff also said Schabarum has responded to the uneven distribution of AIDS 
cases by allowing money for six of the eight beds for his San Gabriel Valley 
district to be spent at a hospice in central Los Angeles. Patients treated 
there must be from Schabarum's district, however, Schunhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the contracts awarded this week, the three organizations that will 
receive funding through June, 1992 are: 
</P>
<P>
Hospice/Los Angeles-Long Beach. It will get about $94,000 a year for two beds 
at a shelter being set up in Pomona and about $235,000 a year for five beds at 
Pioneer House in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Serra Ancillary Care Corp. It will get about $271,000 a year for six beds at an 
existing facility west of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS Hospice Foundation. The agency, which also operates the Barlow Hospital 
hospice, will get about $158,000 a year for three beds in a new shelter near 
Martin Luther King-Drew Medical Center in Willowbrook, north of Compton.

LONG BEACH HOPES TO START CURB-SIDE RECYCLING IN 1990 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mindless weekly ritual of taking out the trash is about to require a bit 
more thought. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling is coming. Residents will be asked to salvage bottles, aluminum cans 
and newspapers from the rest of their refuse. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach officials say they hope curb-side recycling will put a dent in the 
city's huge volume of trash, thereby reducing dumping costs at near-capacity 
landfills. Recycling also would make the city's trash-to-energy plant operate 
more efficiently by removing items that won't burn. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it (recycling) is of utmost importance," Mayor Ernie Kell said. 
"Burning trash is fine, but we need to start recycling some of this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mentioned in Budget 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is considering the matter, but officials are still months away 
from concocting a workable recycling plan. They agree, however, with the goal 
of starting curb-side recycling next year. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager James C. Hankla discussed the recycling plan in his budget 
recommendation for the coming fiscal year, but did not include start-up funds 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
As good as recycling sounds, it is not exactly a profitable proposition. Every 
recycling program in the county costs more to operate than it earns in sales of 
recyclables, according to Bill George, who monitors recycling for the Los 
Angeles County Sanitation Districts. Some cities have increased trash 
collection rates to provide for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, recycling is increasingly popular among cities as a way of 
helping to cope with the so-called "garbage crisis," the problem of what to do 
with trash once Southland landfills reach capacity in the next few years. Until 
two years ago, only Downey, Santa Monica, Burbank and Claremont had active 
curb-side collection programs. Since then, six other cities have started 
full-fledged curb-side recycling or pilot programs. 
</P>
<P>
Together, they collect 1,130 tons of recyclable materials a month. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling was supposed to have begun in Long Beach with the start-up of the 
city's Southeast Resource Recovery Facility on Terminal Island, which burns 
trash to produce electricity. But city engineers say they have been so busy 
dealing with problems at the plant that the recycling program has fallen six 
months behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"We played the hand we were dealt," Assistant City Manager John Shirey said. 
"We had to worry about SERRF because that was the instant issue fraught with 
risk -- high-dollar risk -- and certain problems. If people think we've 
dilly-dallied around, we haven't." 
</P>
<P>
Recycling is important to the trash-to-energy plant because it not only 
separates many non-flammable items, but prevents the burning of newsprint, 
which can produce chemical-laden smoke because of the metal content of various 
colored inks, said Martha Gildart, an engineer for the California Waste 
Management Board. 
</P>
<P>
Plans are moving ahead at a quickening pace. William Davis, Long Beach's solid 
waste manager, said the city has a $30,000 contract with consultants who are 
studying how cans and bottles could best be recycled in restaurants, how to 
salvage dead batteries from cars and whether city crews could compost grass 
clippings and tree trimmings. The city is looking for a recycling coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for a citizens advisory committee to help formulate the program and 
to sell the idea to the public. After all of the meetings, the actual design of 
Long Beach's program would start in December. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach's efforts come as landfill dumping rates are rising. The county 
Sanitation Districts plans a $1.50 raise in the price of dumping one ton of 
trash in its Puente Hills landfill, the primary dump site for Long Beach, Davis 
said. Long Beach residents generate about 300,000 tons of garbage a year. 
</P>
<P>
But as the trash business goes, material actually recycled is a veritable drop 
in the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling specialist George said only about a third of all waste is generated 
by residents. The rest is commercial or construction waste, such as asphalt 
from torn-up streets or chunks of concrete from demolished buildings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the residential trash already is being combed for bottles, cans and 
newspapers on a voluntary basis. The state Division of Recycling, which pays 
the state's one-cent-a-container bounty for used bottles and cans, estimates 
that 60% of the aluminum cans and 40% of the bottles are already being 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
Most curb-side recycling programs are voluntary, with participation by 
residents generally under 50%. All told, George said, residential recycling 
could realistically be expected to cut the total amount of trash by about 7%. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a start," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Won an Exemption 
</P>
<P>
While proceeding with a recycling program, Long Beach has left itself a legal 
out. Arguing that its trash-to-energy plant shows the city's commitment to 
reducing its volume of waste, the city successfully lobbied for an exemption to 
a bill last year that would require cities to start curb-side recycling 
programs. While Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed the measure, a bill with the 
exemption intact was resurrected in the Legislature this year. 
</P>
<P>
Some recycling activists believe the city should move faster. 
</P>
<P>
"They are going too slow. They should have started three years ago," said Long 
Beach recycling advocate Virginia Siegel. "When they accepted the incinerator, 
it was with recycling included." 
</P>
<P>
Kell said he is in no hurry for the start of a recycling program. "Recycling is 
something we have to take slowly," the mayor said at a recent City Council 
meeting. "It's going to take an education program, (and) if implemented it's 
going to create extra work for the residents, but it's something . . . that's 
important. I would hope that residents would buy into it."

RACE FOR COLLEGE BOARD HEATS UP DESPITE RIVALS' SIMILAR VIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The winner of next Tuesday's special election for a seat on the Ventura County 
Community College District Board of Trustees will serve only five months, but 
the campaign has generated enough acrimony to last a full four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
The hotly contested race, which began when the board deadlocked in November 
over a replacement for a member who resigned, has been characterized by 
personal attacks, including accusations of misrepresented endorsements, 
breached promises and racial insensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
The election pits Dorothy Ballesteros, a Ventura County substance-abuse 
educator, against Gregory Kampf, a Ventura elementary school principal who 
previously served on the board. The term they are seeking expires in November. 
</P>
<P>
For all their differences, however, the two candidates have much in common. 
Both say they favor the traditionally liberal causes of labor, minorities, 
women and the disabled. So little do they differ on many issues, in fact, that 
the Tri-Counties Central Labor Council, a political action group for 40 unions 
from Monterey to Los Angeles counties, has endorsed both of them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not 'Much Different' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see in the bottom line where they were that much different," said 
Barry Hammitt, chairman of the council's Ventura unit. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some groups have been able to choose. The American Federation of 
Teachers, a union that represents 65% of the district's 1,000 faculty members, 
and La Raza Faculty Assn., a group representing the district's Latino faculty, 
have endorsed Kampf for the District 1 seat, which takes in most of Ventura, 
northern portions of Oxnard and unincorporated areas between the two cities. 
Tim Hirshberg, the board's newest member, also has endorsed Kampf. 
</P>
<P>
"We just felt that Greg, with his experience and background, would be a 
stronger trustee," said Ishmael de la Roche, La Raza's president. "He won't 
have to come in and learn. . . . With Dorothy, you're taking a gamble. We don't 
know how strong she would be." 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros, a former Ventura College student, appeared to win support from 
many students in a debate last week at Ventura College, where she expressed 
opposition to increased parking fees and advocated strengthening the college's 
child-care program by expanding it to the community at large. 
</P>
<P>
"I sensed she's more concerned for the students," said Ventura College's 
student body president, Hien Nguyen, who helped coordinate the debate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Head Start for November 
</P>
<P>
At stake is an edge in November's election, when the winner of the June 6 
special election will be an incumbent. As such, the trustee is expected to 
enjoy an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"Who wins in June will probably be reelected in November," explained 
Ballesteros, 43. "Now's the critical time." 
</P>
<P>
Confirmed Kampf, 37: "This is life or death." 
</P>
<P>
Some voters fault the pair for failing to reach an accord that would allow one 
of them to drop from the race, which is expected to cost taxpayers $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like for all the money were spending for the election we should have 
some candidates with sharply divergent views on the issues," said Veronica 
Ramirez, a Ventura College student who last week helped organize a debate 
between the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Kampf agrees that the expense is "ridiculous" and Ballesteros calls it 
"unfortunate," but each believes that the other should have bowed out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blames Kampf for Fight 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros, who was considered for appointment to the board when the trustees 
deadlocked, said Kampf was asking for trouble by entering the race after she 
had declared her candidacy last November. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time," she said, "he wasn't interested." 
</P>
<P>
But Kampf maintains that after the teachers came out with their endorsement, 
Ballesteros broke a pact they had reached when he entered the race in February. 
</P>
<P>
"She told me she wasn't going to be a candidate if she didn't have the support 
of teachers," he said. "When I got them, I expected her to drop out." 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros, meanwhile, downplays the episode's importance. "I didn't court 
endorsements," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros instead has underscored her standing as a Ventura College graduate 
who attended the school as a single mother (her only son is now grown) in her 
mid 20s. She frequently mentions the fact that her 41-year-old sister, Eva 
Salinas, who was partially paralyzed by a stroke five years ago, attends 
Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
These facts, coupled with her Latino heritage, have made Ballesteros more 
sensitive than Kampf to issues involving women, minorities and the disabled, 
she said, pointing out that he is "white, male and a manager." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Unique Closeness' 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I have a unique closeness and intimacy in those areas," said 
Ballesteros, a Ventura resident. "You have a better understanding once you've 
been there." 
</P>
<P>
She also points out that the board would be lacking a minority representative 
if trustee Julian Tarleton Sr., who is black, does not seek office in November, 
as he has indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Kampf, a father of three, has maintained that voters are more interested in his 
record as an educator, which includes 10 years as a teacher and five years as 
principal of the E. P. Foster School. He also served on the board of the 
Ventura Unified School District, and was on the community college district 
board from 1981 to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"The college district's budget is $54 million," said Kampf, an Oxnard resident. 
"You have to safeguard the community's investment. It's critical to have 
experience commensurate with the level of responsibility. I don't see that my 
opponent has that. She's never worked in an executive or management position." 
</P>
<P>
In the campaign's most controversial twist, Ballesteros has responded by 
referring to letters of recommendation that a host of politicians, including 
Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria), wrote in support of her appointment 
to the board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backing Claimed 
</P>
<P>
"These people wouldn't have written letters of support if they didn't think I 
was experienced," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kampf maintains that such claims have misrepresented the support -- a charge 
Ballesteros denies -- by suggesting that these politicians, whom he considers 
allies, support her over him. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack O'Connell and I went to high school and played Little League together," 
Kampf said. "There's no way that this lady is going to come up with a letter 
endorsing her over me." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell acknowledges having written a letter supporting Ballesteros' 
appointment to the board, but he said that he never meant for it to be 
construed as an endorsement for her candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been asked and I don't intend to make an endorsement," he said. "I 
know both are very good people and both would be an outstanding trustee." 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros, who in her job visits elementary schools to warn students about 
the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse, has ruffled feathers among faculty by 
referring to herself as an educator when she doesn't hold a bachelor's degree. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Infighting Seen 
</P>
<P>
But Ballesteros contends that it is her opponent who will ruffle feathers if he 
is elected. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of infighting and bickering when Greg was on the board," she 
said. "I don't think he can come in as a peaceful member. I'm new blood. I 
think I won't open any old wounds." 
</P>
<P>
Kampf, meanwhile, downplays the effects of divisions among trustees. "Lively 
debate of issues can be very productive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many faculty members don't agree. They have expressed the hope that the 
candidate who wins the bitter campaign will act as a peacemaker on a sharply 
divided board. It was this board, after all, that couldn't agree on an interim 
trustee after Fernando Elizondo left in October for a job as district 
superintendent in the central California community of Parlier. 
</P>
<P>
"We want someone who can represent the board with dignity and not squabble and 
look like little children in public," said David Breslin, president of Ventura 
College's Academic Senate.

SIMI VALLEY WILL BE INCLUDED IN HARVARD STUDY OF ACID POLLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In one of the first and most far-reaching studies of its kind, Harvard 
University has begun monitoring air quality in Simi Valley and 23 other North 
American communities to investigate the health effects of acid pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
The $3-million project, funded by the U.S. and Canadian governments, will focus 
on whether airborne acids, which come from power plants and automobile exhaust, 
cause respiratory problems in school-age children. 
</P>
<P>
Those pollutants are the same compounds found in acid rain, which is believed 
to harm vegetation and the facades of buildings. The Harvard study, however, 
will focus only on the health effect of acid particles and gasses that are 
directly inhaled. 
</P>
<P>
"There certainly do seem to be some effects," said Jerry Keeler, project 
manager for the acid study and a research scientist at the Harvard School of 
Public Health. "But past studies are inconclusive. There just hasn't been 
enough work done to definitively answer the question." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Completion by '91 
</P>
<P>
Of the communities selected for the project, which is expected to be completed 
in 1991, two-thirds were believed to have air with high acid levels and the 
other one-third were thought to have relatively acid-free air, Keeler said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ventura County's ozone level is ranked by the Environmental Protection 
Agency as fourth worst in the nation, Keeler declined to identify Simi Valley's 
category, because he feared skewing the objectivity of the study. 
</P>
<P>
If participants believe their community is being studied for its clean air, he 
said, they tend to respond to questions in a manner that supports that premise. 
"If they know it's being looked at as a dirty area," Keeler said, "then they 
think, 'Oh, we must be sick.' " 
</P>
<P>
The monitoring of Simi Valley begins today and will continue for a year. 
Special equipment was shipped to the county Air Pollution Control District, 
which will be paid $6,270 by Harvard to take readings every other day. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, questionnaires will be submitted to about 800 Simi Valley 
elementary-school children asking about a range of respiratory-related 
ailments. Young children were selected because they don't smoke cigarettes, 
which could hamper the analysis, Keeler said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the spring of 1990, Harvard researchers will conduct respiratory tests 
on any of the children whose parents consent to an exam. 
</P>
<P>
"It may turn out that the Simi Valley area really has very moderate levels and 
isn't as dirty as you would expect," Keeler said. "It's just important not to 
give people a bias beforehand." 
</P>
<P>
The only other California cities included in the study are Monterey and 
Livermore. 
</P>
<P>
If the results indicate that acid particles pose a significant health threat, 
Keeler said, acids might join the five other airborne pollutants that the EPA 
regulates, including ozone, nitrogen dioxide and lead. 
</P>
<P>
Up to now, such studies have been conducted primarily in laboratories and 
indicate that acids in large quantities have an acute, immediate health effect, 
he said. However, there is little data on the chronic, long-term effects of 
exposure to such pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be very valuable to Ventura County," said Richard H. Baldwin, 
the county's air pollution control officer. "It will be good to know whether we 
have a problem or not."

NEW WEAPON IN GANG WARS;

COMPTON POLICE SERVE WRITTEN NOTICE OF STREET TERRORISM ACT 
</P>

<P>
"Hey, Sleep!" Red Mason yelled out the window of the unmarked police car as it 
rounded the corner onto Rose Avenue, a narrow street lined with big trees and 
small houses that range from neatly kept to ravaged. 
</P>
<P>
"He's already been served," said Mason, who sat in the front passenger's seat. 
</P>
<P>
Edward (Red) Mason is a 19-year veteran of the Compton Police Department's gang 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
Sleep is an "O.G.," shorthand for original gang member, in this case the 
Santana Block Crips, who control a narrow stretch of neighborhood squeezed 
between Santa Fe Avenue and the Southern Pacific railroad tracks that cut 
Compton in two. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Attention 
</P>
<P>
Mason, Patrolman Mark Anderson and two officers in the car behind them were 
serving special-delivery notices on the Santanas. The Santanas, one of the 
city's oldest gangs, has been targeted for special attention under the state's 
newest anti-gang weapon, the Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "Baby RICO," because it mimics the federal racketeering statute 
(Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act), the law says gang 
membership can be a felony. Police and sheriff's deputies in Compton, Long 
Beach, Los Angeles, Pomona and Pasadena are serving written notices about the 
law on members of 11 gangs that Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner has 
identified so far through police and court records as engaging in criminal 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
"What's your name, man?" Mason asked out the window as Anderson, cruising south 
on Spring Street, stopped the car. 
</P>
<P>
"Charles," answered a handsome 18-year-old known as "Black." 
</P>
<P>
Mason climbed out of the car, asking Black what gang he belonged to. Black, 
trying to sound cooperative at the same time he was trying to back down the 
sidewalk, said he used to belong to a gang. Doesn't anymore, he insisted, not 
since he did time on a weapons charge. Looking for work now, he said. Has to 
support his new baby daughter, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"What set (gang) you from?" Mason asked again in an undemanding tone. 
</P>
<P>
"No set," Black said. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to go over to Lueders with me?" Mason asked casually, as if inviting 
a neighbor to take a ride with him to the hardware store. Lueders, a city park 
10 blocks away, is in Blood territory. Crips are not welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Using the police car hood as a writing surface, Black signed the 4-by-5-inch 
notice that is designed in triplicate like a credit card receipt. It said that 
Black has been notified that Santana Block is a "criminal street gang" under 
the provisions of the new law. The top copy went to Black, the second into 
police files and the third to the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, which has not yet been tested in court, Black could get up to 
three years in prison for just being a Santana. Police say, however, what is 
most likely to happen is that prosecutors will produce the notice if Black is 
convicted of a felony and will argue that he should get more time in prison for 
being in what he was warned was a criminal gang. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, come here, Snap," Anderson suddenly yelled at a young man who stepped out 
the door of a house, spotted police and tried to duck back inside. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear about these papers we're serving, the gang terrorism act?" asked 
Anderson, a boyish-looking officer who has spent 12 years keeping tract of 
Compton's 36 gangs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wearing a Beeper 
</P>
<P>
Short, and with a beeper clipped to the waist of his stone-washed blue jeans, 
Snap grinned broadly. Twenty-one Santanas had already been served notices 
before the gang unit spotted Black and Snap on a late afternoon cruise through 
Santana turf. 
</P>
<P>
Like most gang members, Snap refused to sign the notice, so Anderson wrote 
"refused to sign" on the signature line before handing Snap his copy. Refusing 
to sign does not alter the possibility of being prosecuted under the new law, 
law enforcement officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Mason and Anderson bantered awhile with Snap, talking about a rival gang and 
asking about Potato Head (Paul Watson, a Santana being sought in connection 
with the April 2 drive-by murder of a gang member and a bystander in Kelly 
Park). 
</P>
<P>
They asked Snap to pull up his shirt so they could see "SBC," the Santana Block 
Crips' tattoo. Bullet scars decorated Snap's torso. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Died 
</P>
<P>
Back at the wheel of the car, Anderson said: "He and his brother and another 
kid were shot standing in front of the liquor store down there." 
</P>
<P>
The youth with Snap and his brother at the liquor store died in the June, 1988, 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Making a sharp left when he recognized the driver of an older model gold car, 
Anderson pulled up behind the car and yelled out his window, "Pull over, 
Spank!" 
</P>
<P>
Spank, a pudgy, 19-year-old in blue shirt and pants, wore a beeper on his belt. 
He was on his way home, he said, to take a nap before going to work. The police 
asked where he works and what he does. 
</P>
<P>
"I do all kinds of things, can't pinpoint no one thing," Spank said. 
</P>
<P>
"You heard about this program, right?" Anderson said, sliding a notice across 
the hood of the police car and asking, "You know how to read?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I know how to read," Spank said defensively. He declined to sign the 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Carloads Approach 
</P>
<P>
Cruising in the car again, Mason slouched in his seat until the sight of two 
carloads of young men approaching from the opposite direction made him bolt 
upright and signal the officers in the car following him and Anderson to stop 
the approaching vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"Look who's in the back," Mason said, greeting old acquaintances as they piled 
out of the cars. "Ced and Sag." 
</P>
<P>
"They don't do any shooting. They're into dope," Mason said, prompting a chorus 
of "Not me, not me," from the men, whom he identified as O.Gs. 
</P>
<P>
Sag, in a white tank top and new-looking wide-whale corduroy pants and suede 
shoes, is a celebrity in Santana territory. He has been on various network 
television shows and been interviewed by reporters from newspapers across the 
country. Making use of the unexpected meeting with the police, he complained 
they were not doing enough to keep the Atlantic Drive Crips from "pressing" the 
Santanas. 
</P>
<P>
"Aw, that's bull," the police said in unison. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Supported by Drugs 
</P>
<P>
Back in the gang unit's office, a basement room in which gang paraphernalia -- 
T-shirts, hats, snapshots and piles of funeral programs -- cover the walls and 
the tops of desks, Mason recalled that he knew Sag and his friends when 
Santanas were "doing drive-bys on a bicycle. Now they got AKs (semiautomatic 
weapons) and cars." 
</P>
<P>
Drugs, Mason said, gave the gangs an economic base that they did not have when 
they first sprang up in Compton in the late 1960s and early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Mason and other members of the gang unit welcomed the new anti-gang law. By 
itself, they say, the law will not eradicate gang violence but it is one more 
tool, an enhancement to other laws, that may help take more gang members off 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"What it's for," Mason said, "is the guy who's been slipping through, the guy 
who's been riding in the back seat on the drive-by."

MOTHER OF MURDERED MAN OFFERS $2,000 REWARD FOR INFORMATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A reward of $2,000 is being offered for information leading to the arrest and 
conviction of the person or persons responsible for the murder of Jose Antonio 
Mendoza, 32, South Gate police said. The reward is being offered by Mendoza's 
mother, Irene Molina of El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Scott Attebery said Mendoza's decomposed body was found in late 
October by a California Transportation Department worker at an on-ramp of the 
Golden State Freeway in Burbank. Mendoza had been stabbed several times. His 
car, which had been burned, was found in early October in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza was last seen Oct. 7 when he left his South Gate home. Mendoza told his 
wife, Leticia, that he was going shopping at the South Gate Plaza, Attebery 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Attebery said police have no leads. Anyone with any information is asked to 
contact Attebery at 563-5461.

HARWOOD ADVOCATES MORE POLICE, NEW SUBSTATION EAST OF AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying that Long Beach needs to expand its police force by more than the 10 
additional officers proposed in next year's budget, Councilman Warren Harwood 
is advocating the hiring of 45 new officers and the establishment of a police 
substation on the east side of Long Beach airport. 
</P>
<P>
Harwood, who intends to present his proposal at a budget hearing Tuesday, says 
his plan could be paid for with $3.2 million in new revenue from a variety of 
city fees, including airport and harbor fees. 
</P>
<P>
The city manager's proposed budget of nearly $1.3 billion includes funding for 
10 new officers, but the Long Beach police chief has said he needs another 164 
officers.

BREAKERS HOTEL, OCEAN CENTER OFFICE BUILDING GIVEN LANDMARK STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Breakers Hotel and the Ocean Center Building, both on Ocean Boulevard, have 
been named historical landmarks by the Long Beach City Council, giving them 
some protection against demolition or radical remodelings. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1925 in the Spanish Renaissance style, the 13-story Breakers building 
epitomized the lavish hotels of Long Beach's resort era. It was originally 
known as the Wilton Hotel and was built by W. Jay Burgin. The hotel closed last 
year and is being converted into senior citizen housing. 
</P>
<P>
Just west of the Breakers is the Ocean Center Building, constructed in 1929 in 
the Mediterranean Revival style and designed by Meyer and Holler, well-known 
Los Angeles architects who also designed Grauman's Chinese Theater in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of historical landmarks must obtain approval from the Cultural Heritage 
Commission before making any major changes in the building's appearance. The 
city can also delay demolition of a landmark for up to a year while negotiating 
with the owners, although if no agreement is reached, demolition would 
ultimately be permitted. The owners of the Breakers and the Ocean Center, an 
office building, have both indicated they wish to maintain the structures as 
they are.

TRUCKING COMPANY FINED $5,050 FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An interstate trucking company has been fined $5,050 by the U.S. Department of 
Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration after federal 
investigators received an anonymous tip that the firm's Montebello terminal has 
been violating numerous health and safety regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The Chapin Road terminal of Consolidated Freightways was found to have 
seriously violated the federal regulations, OSHA regional manager Leonard 
Limtiaco announced this week. The violations include: 
</P>
<P>
Failure to provide emergency eye- and body-flushing stations for employees 
working with corrosive or hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to provide safe loading facilities by not taking steps to prevent truck 
movement or tipping during loading. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to adequately mark containers of hazardous materials or provide 
information about the materials to employees. 
</P>
<P>
"Serious violations like those against Consolidated," Limtiaco said in a 
written statement, "are issued when there is substantial probability that death 
or serious physical harm could occur, and the employer knew or should have 
known of the hazard." 
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for the trucking company, which is based in Portland, 
Ore., denied that serious health and safety hazards exist at the south 
Montebello terminal. The spokesman, who declined to be identified, said that 
the OSHA investigators "were very, very petty" about most of the violations. 
"They are making it sound like we are the bad guys, when we are not." 
</P>
<P>
About 30 trucks arrive each day at the terminal near the Santa Ana Freeway, 
carrying goods that range from paper products to hazardous materials, the 
spokesman said. He added that the fines were the first to have been issued 
against the company.

TEACHERS UNION VOTES TO ACCEPT CONTRACT WITH 5% SALARY INCREASE 
</P>

Two weeks after they threatened to walk out of classes, members of the Whittier 
Elementary Teachers Assn. have approved a new two-year contract with the 
14-campus Whittier City School District that includes a 5% wage increase for 
the next year, union leaders announced. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached a tentative agreement last week, union President Marilyn 
Stapleton said. About 87% of the 265 unionized elementary and intermediate 
school teachers approved the contract in voting last Thursday and Friday, she 
said. Results of the vote were released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers had voted overwhelmingly to authorize a walkout early in May after 
a fact-finding report recommended that the union accept most of the 
administration's last offer before the two sides hit an impasse. The walkout 
never materialized, however. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers and administrators had been negotiating since the last one-year 
contract expired last June. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached an impasse this spring, with teachers demanding a 7% 
salary increase for the next two years and full fringe benefits for early 
retirees. 
</P>
<P>
The district had countered with a 5% wage increase. Under a state mediator, 
however, the two sides agreed on a 5% wage increase and a 1% across-the-board 
bonus for the first year of the contract. Salary increases for the second year 
will be tied to the yearly cost-of-living adjustment. The district has agreed 
to provide full fringe benefits to early retirees. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is dancing" about the contract settlement, Stapleton said. "But 
everyone is relieved that (the dispute) is over. The teachers feel they made 
some headway. That's how we all feel. We made some headway, but not as much as 
we would like."

RELATIONSHIP GETS D.A.'S AIDE TAKEN OFF CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A Ventura County deputy district attorney was removed from a kidnaping trial 
that began Wednesday after it was revealed that he had developed a relationship 
with the defendant's ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
Terence M. Kilbride, a deputy district attorney since 1975 and a Ventura 
Unified School District trustee since 1980, was dismissed from the case two 
weeks ago when his superiors learned that his admiring letters to the woman 
were in the hands of the defendant's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time that a personal relationship could affect or appear to affect the 
judgment of a prosecutor, it is standard practice that the case be handled by 
somebody else," said Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Vincent J. O'Neill Jr., adding 
that his office is conducting an internal investigation into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
According to O'Neill, Kilbride developed a relationship with Cindy Cozzolino in 
early 1987, after he won a conviction against her former husband, Larry 
Badgwell, for kidnaping a Port Hueneme man who allegedly owed him $20,000 for a 
cocaine deal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conviction Overturned 
</P>
<P>
Badgwell's conviction was overturned by the state Court of Appeal in January, 
1988, and the new trial began this week. 
</P>
<P>
However, letters from Kilbride to Cozzolino included in the court file indicate 
that his relationship with the Orange County woman continued until at least 
August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Kilbride, who declined to discuss specifics of the incident, said that he 
allowed himself to remain on the case after the relationship had developed 
because "it wasn't an appropriate time" to stop seeing Cozzolino. 
</P>
<P>
But Badgwell's attorney, Charles L. Cassy, said Badgwell had reestablished a 
friendly relationship with Cozzolino since the appellate court overturned the 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"It is apparent . . . that the district attorney in this as well as the 
district attorney's office would be unable to proceed in an unbiased and 
neutral prosecutorial capacity," Cassy contended in court documents. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Frederick Jones, however, agreed to let the prosecutor's 
office handle the second trial of Badgwell, as long as Kilbride was off the 
case.

MOORPARK TO LET VOTERS DECIDE IF AGENCY USES ITS EMINENT DOMAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Moorpark City Council, responding to residents concerned that their homes 
will be taken for a redevelopment project, has directed the city attorney to 
draft a ballot measure to prohibit the Redevelopment Agency from using its 
power of eminent domain on residential property. 
</P>
<P>
The action came after property owners in the two-square-mile downtown 
redevelopment district received a May 8 letter from City Manager Steve Kueny 
explaining that the Redevelopment Agency has the right under state law to 
condemn residential property for public use. Under eminent domain, the agency 
has to pay fair market value for any property that it seizes. 
</P>
<P>
Although the letter stressed that eminent domain would only be used "in extreme 
cases," about 400 angry residents attended a council meeting last week and 
called for a ballot measure to prohibit its use. The council, which also serves 
at the Redevelopment Agency, unanimously voted to sponsor such a measure on the 
Nov. 7 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't planning to use the power anyway, but the public outcry was so 
great that we decided to reassure people by putting it on the ballot," 
Councilman Scott Montgomery said. "We expect it will pass by a huge majority." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1,020 Homes Protected 
</P>
<P>
About 1,020 homes in the downtown redevelopment area would be permanently 
protected if voters approve the measure, said Jon Huffman, redevelopment 
project liaison. Those homes are in residential neighborhoods, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another 30 homes in the district are in commercial zones. Under the proposed 
measure, the Redevelopment Agency would not be able to use its power of eminent 
domain against the present property owners. However, the city would be able to 
condemn the properties if they changed hands, said Councilman Paul W. Lawrason 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment district, which encompasses the older downtown business 
district, is roughly bounded by Wicks Road on the north, the Arroyo Simi on the 
south, Gabbert Road on the west and Morning Dove Road on the east. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of whether eminent domain should be used on residential properties 
has been controversial since Moorpark established its Redevelopment Agency a 
year ago. Several council members, including Montgomery, campaigned against its 
use during the November municipal election.

FILLMORE SURPRISES EVEN ECKLUND WITH A BERTH IN 1-A TITLE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having guided Fillmore High to the Southern Section championship game six 
times, Tom Ecklund is the last word in finals among Ventura County baseball 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
But he has difficulty finding the words to describe the achievement of this 
year's Flashes, who meet Beaumont in the 1-A Division final Friday at 7:30 p.m. 
at Blair Field in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Ecklund speaks with the wide-eyed wonderment of a rookie coach sailing along on 
a dream season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in total amazement that we're back in the championship game," Ecklund 
said. "It's really hard to comprehend. It's hard to understand how this is 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
What's happening? 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore slid to second-place in the Tri-Valley League but has slipped past 
three playoff opponents, including Aquinas, 3-2, Tuesday at Moorpark College in 
a semifinal game. 
</P>
<P>
Who are these news Flashes? 
</P>
<P>
Are they the same Flashes who were decimated by graduation after winning the 
1-A title last season? 
</P>
<P>
The same Flashes whose best player was kicked off the team for disciplinary 
reasons? 
</P>
<P>
The same Flashes who start two sophomores? 
</P>
<P>
Ecklund is right. It is hard to believe. 
</P>
<P>
Hard to believe that Brad Edmonds, who won his 11th game against two losses by 
scattering 11 hits and walking zero in a complete-game effort against Aquinas, 
had never pitched before this season. 
</P>
<P>
Hard to believe that the team that lost Southern Section Player of the Year 
Willie Leighton, et. al., could be brashly bashing at the door of another 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"We played a lot of kids this year who hadn't played before on the varsity 
level and even the ones who had experience have played different positions," 
Ecklund said. 
</P>
<P>
The gang of unlikely heroes are in a position to become champions, which would 
be familiar for Ecklund. Since becoming coach in 1973, he has led Fillmore to 
the finals in 1975, '76, '77, '79 and '88, winning the title in every instance 
but 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The legacy of success obviously has rubbed off on the latest group. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the kids who played last year are around, encouraging these guys," 
Ecklund said. "They feel it. They really have done a good job. I'm super-proud 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids have an attitude that they want to win, they want to be the best." 
</P>
<P>
Such resolve was needed against Aquinas (17-7-1), which took a 2-0 lead in the 
first inning and shut out Fillmore until the fourth. The Flashes loaded the 
bases in the first with none out but did not score, then left on two more in 
the third. 
</P>
<P>
"We were overswinging, trying too hard," said Ecklund, whose team left 12 
runners on base. 
</P>
<P>
Although Fillmore scored once in the fourth when Robby Ybarra walked with the 
bases loaded, the Flashes again left three runners aboard. 
</P>
<P>
The persistence paid off, however, as Chad Van Winkle singled down the 
left-field line in the fifth to bring home Rory Maus and tie the score, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
The winning run scored an inning later on a rally that began with two out. 
Ybarra singled, Edmonds and Maus walked and Tony Cervantez -- after hitting a 
ball over the fence barely foul -- hit a grounder through shortstop to score 
Ybarra. 
</P>
<P>
Aquinas had a runner on second with two out in the seventh when Fillmore second 
baseman George Frias preserved the victory by going to his knees to stop a 
ground ball up the middle by Miguel McQueen and throwing him out by a half 
step. 
</P>
<P>
"These are kids who haven't quit," Ecklund said. "I told them before the game 
that there are a lot of champions in the world, but real champions are ones who 
play the entire game, from start to finish. 
</P>
<P>
"That sums up this game." 
</P>
<P>
Edmonds, who threw only 91 pitches against Aquinas, told the coach he would be 
ready on two days rest. Who can doubt him? Edmonds has pitched all three 
playoff games.

FLIPPING OUT OVER KART WHEELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH NICHOLS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jackie Paradis watched the sleek silver-and-black go-kart zip down the 
straightaway of the quarter-mile course and sighed. Not even the buzz of the 
go-kart's 100cc Yamaha engine sounded like Paradis remembered. 
</P>
<P>
"The karts were not as sophisticated back then," Paradis said. 
</P>
<P>
Paradis spent part of her youth at this same isolated sprint-kart race course 
on the Ventura-Oxnard border. She worked in the concession stand as a teen-ager 
while her father staged weekly go-kart or sprint-kart races. 
</P>
<P>
At one of the races, Paradis met her future husband, Larry, who also was a 
karting enthusiast. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven years later, Paradis, of La Crescenta, barely recognized the 
sophisticated-looking sprint-karts buzzing around the course's nine turns at 
speeds of 60 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"Go-kart racing was great, especially for the kids because they learned how to 
drive responsibly," Paradis said. 
</P>
<P>
Safe driving skills are still stressed in kart racing, yet most of the students 
who go through Jim Hall's Racing/Karting School in Ventura are adults. The 
average age of Hall's students is 33, and 10% of the 8,500 racers who have gone 
through the school are women. 
</P>
<P>
Karting in the '80s appeals to businessmen, stockbrokers, airline pilots -- 
just about anyone who would rather get behind the wheel of a race car than 
watch auto racing on cable television. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives people a chance to learn something hands-on that is a lot of fun and 
does not involve a lot of time," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
A karting class provides basic instruction in steering, acceleration, braking, 
cornering and kart safety. Some students, such as Derek Wilcox of Woodland 
Hills, advance into professional kart racing after quickly accelerating through 
the 14 classes of karting. 
</P>
<P>
"For those who want to go into racing larger cars, this is the perfect place to 
start," said Donna Alija, 33, of Ventura, an instructor at Hall's school. 
"Karting gives you a base to start in racing. This is a Formula One race car 
that's condensed in size." 
</P>
<P>
Most beginning kart drivers never race competitively, however. They race for 
recreation. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of drivers start with ambitions of getting into other forms of racing," 
Hall said. "But there are many, especially those in the (age) 30s-to-50s range, 
who stay right in this sport for years." 
</P>
<P>
Hall provides all the necessary equipment, including helmet, racing jacket and 
a sprint-kart that is equipped with a 100cc Yamaha Piston Port engine -- 
capable of going from zero to a peak speed of 60 m.p.h. in seven seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said: "We take someone who has never driven a performance vehicle and at 
the end of two days, they may not be the best race-car driver in the world, but 
they will be able to do some passing and racing in controlled races." 
</P>
<P>
Alija took up karting nearly two years ago. She now teaches sprint-kart racing 
and is one of the sport's most enthusiastic advocates. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a feeling different from anything else to be in a sprint-kart that's 
three-quarters-of-an-inch off the ground going 60 m.p.h.," Alija said. "That 
rush of adrenalin you get when you're behind the wheel gives your whole body a 
great feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Alija likens karting to meditation because of the total concentration a driver 
needs to maneuver a sprint kart around a race course. 
</P>
<P>
It can also be a dangerous sport if a driver becomes overconfident. 
</P>
<P>
"We have all different types of drivers come through the classes," Alija said. 
"Some guys will drive up in their Porsches, Ferraris and Jaguars and think they 
know how to drive a race car. But there is a lot more involved in karting. All 
they have to do is spin out once on turn No. 4 and they come around." 
</P>
<P>
Russ Callenberg, 40, a stockbroker from San Rafael, Calif., drove from the Bay 
Area to take a karting course at Hall's school, one of only two professional 
karting schools in the United States. (The other is in Ohio.) Callenberg races 
on weekends to relieve stress from his job. 
</P>
<P>
"What's great about karting is that you can get that real high adrenalin rush 
at safe speeds," Callenberg said. "It feels like you're going 800 m.p.h. out 
there, but you're not." 
</P>
<P>
Callenberg picked the right area to pursue sprint-kart racing. Ever since the 
Go-Kart Club of America held its first organized races in the Rose Bowl parking 
lot in 1957, Southern California has been the hub of karting. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 of the estimated 5,000 sprint-kart racers nationwide live in 
California. Races are held every weekend throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Karting has flourished in Southern California because the area's temperate 
climate can support a year-round season. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, who has a degree in psychology from UC Santa Barbara, was drawn to racing 
long before he opened his karting school in 1982. His father, Jim Hall, Sr., is 
a former Indianapolis 500 champion. 
</P>
<P>
Hall spent his summers in the late '70s working with his father's racing crews, 
where he learned engineering, race-car design and mechanical skills. 
</P>
<P>
Like his father, Hall is also a successful race-car driver. He has won several 
karting titles, including the 1988 World Karting Assn. Championships at the 
Daytona Speedway in Daytona, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Karting appealed to Hall because of its convenience and its cost -- karts can 
start at $2,700 -- compared with more expensive forms of racing. 
</P>
<P>
Hall did not need a race crew or tow trailer to become a sprint-kart racer. He 
just tossed his kart in the back of his 1980 Capri Hatchback and took off. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something you can do on your own without a crew," Hall said. "Karting is 
a great low-cost option for those people who have always wanted to become 
race-car drivers." 
</P>
<P>
Driving in the fast lane also appeals to the weekend thrill-seeker who has no 
ambition of challenging Mario Andretti in the Indy 500. Most of Hall's women 
students are in that category. 
</P>
<P>
"Women think karting is a male-dominated sport, and it is, but that should not 
stop them from trying it," Alija said. "Anybody can take the skills they 
develop karting and use them when driving a regular car." 
</P>
<P>
Alija also is trying to get corporations to take up karting as a form of stress 
management. The idea appealed to General Electric -- which had a group of 30 
employees take karting classes to help develop team unity and corporate 
bonding. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the karting classes helped the GE employees. 
</P>
<P>
Alija said: "GE wrote to say that the classes stimulated corporate bonding and 
helped to encourage individual competitiveness among its employees."

ANTICIPATED U.S. CUTBACKS TO COST 6,000 HUGHES JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hughes Aircraft will eliminate 6,000 jobs over the next six months in response 
to anticipated federal defense spending reductions and in an effort to improve 
its competitiveness, the Los Angeles aerospace firm announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the cutbacks will occur in Southern California, where 84% of Hughes' 
75,000 workers are located. Although the exact burden of cuts has not been 
apportioned among the dozens of Hughes facilities, some operations facing 
difficult market conditions are likely to bear the brunt of the reductions, 
including the company's industrial electronics, airborne radar and optical 
sensor businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes President Donald H. White said in an interview that the company expects 
most of the 6,000 job cuts to be accomplished through normal job turnover and 
early retirement but that involuntary layoffs will be necessary in some cases. 
Attrition accounts for as many as 7,500 job vacancies at Hughes each year, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hughes cuts are the latest signal that federal defense budget reductions 
are likely to have broad impact across the industry and especially in Southern 
California. Only last week, Northrop announced a plan to cut 3,000 workers, and 
similar layoffs have occurred recently at Lockheed, General Dynamics, Litton 
Industries and TRW, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cutbacks so far have not been as drastic as in past aerospace 
downturns, they appear to be only the beginning of a protracted and painful 
slowdown that will continue at least through the mid-1990s. The slump should be 
moderated, however, by continued strength in commercial aircraft production. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes has already been cutting back employment in recent years in an effort to 
cut costs. Employment peaked at more than 80,000 in 1985, even though the 
company has increased its sales since then. 
</P>
<P>
"We have two things going on at once," White said. "In some areas we have 
downsizing going on, because the amount of business is dropping off some. And 
everywhere, we have some streamlining, which is going to result in some 
reductions. And that's to improve our competitiveness." 
</P>
<P>
White added: "As there is less business around, there are going to be tougher 
fights for it. And so we really have got to be very, very competitive to win 
it. That is what we have been working on for some time, and now we are 
accelerating." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes will attempt to moderate the effect of the job cuts on employees with a 
special incentive retirement program, according to employees interviewed by The 
Times. That program offers employees one week of pay for each year of service 
or a monthly annuity plan that would allow workers to retire up to three years 
early. 
</P>
<P>
White said the cutbacks will affect all types of employees, including hourly 
production workers, engineers, managers and clerical workers. Since 75% of 
Hughes workers are salaried, numerically the cuts will be heaviest there. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to cut our middle management bulge," one missile engineer who 
requested anonymity said Wednesday after attending a company briefing about the 
job cutbacks. "I've been saying for years that we have too many middle 
managers." 
</P>
<P>
The Hughes job losses are not the direct result of any specific funding cuts by 
the Pentagon, White said, but are being made in expectation that proposed 
cutbacks will eventually occur. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has proposed 
major program reductions that would affect Hughes, but those cuts await 
congressional approval and would not be felt for several years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1.5 Billion Involved 
</P>
<P>
In an interview early this month, Hughes Chairman Malcolm R. Currie said the 
Cheney cuts for the fiscal 1990 budget would affect $1.5 billion worth of 
Hughes business. While not all of that represents lost business, a large amount 
of it has been thrown into uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them (weapons programs) are stretched out, some of them are reduced 
and some of them are being cut (totally)," he said. "It is going to hit us 
across the company, but not in a drastic way." 
</P>
<P>
Since Hughes' $7.4 billion in 1988 sales was made up mostly of relatively small 
electronics programs, the budget cuts are having a broad effect across the 
company. One major concern, however, is the status of radar for the B-2 Stealth 
bomber program. Cheney proposes to stretch out the bomber program by at least 
one year, and that could result in a reduction of the 1,500-member work force 
Hughes has on that program, Currie said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time that it is responding to specific budget cuts, Hughes is 
seeking to reduce its overall costs, which it has long recognized as being too 
high. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes enjoyed explosive growth in the early 1980s, based on a significant 
technological lead over its competitors. It won a series of major contracts, in 
which it became the dominant producer of airborne radar, missiles, commercial 
satellites and air defense systems. 
</P>
<P>
But more recently, the Pentagon has sought to drive down costs by setting up 
competitions among contractors that have emphasized price rather than 
technology. And Hughes' high costs have resulted in a decline in the rate at 
which it has won new contracts. In many cases, it is being outbid by 
competitors in businesses that it has monopolized for decades. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been winning the big contracts," an engineer at the company said, 
asking that his name not be published. "It looks like all the big ones are 
going to other companies." 
</P>

Paul Nisbet, an aerospace analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities, said Hughes 
may be hit harder by work force reductions than other contractors. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly those companies (like Hughes) that are dependent on older contracts 
are going to find that their level of activity is declining," he said. "That 
would include companies like General Dynamics with its F-16, M-1 tank and 
submarine programs. Hughes has a mixture, but they haven't won any really big 
ones lately." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence M. Harris, an analyst at the Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards stock 
brokerage, said Hughes has come under more pressure to produce profits since it 
was acquired by General Motors in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost structure may be a little higher for historical reasons," he said. 
</P>
<P>
White said the company will probably cut its research and development spending, 
which amounted to $276 million in 1988. It will also cut its spending to 
develop bids and proposals for new contracts, a measure of the effort put into 
winning new contracts. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the cuts would not sacrifice future growth for short-term profits.

TESTS FIND 'SILENT' AIDS INFECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New research suggests that the standard blood tests for AIDS fail to detect the 
deadly human immunodeficiency virus in nearly one of every four "high-risk" gay 
men who practice unsafe sex. 
</P>
<P>
In the startling finding, UCLA researchers isolated the virus which causes AIDS 
in 23% of a group of Los Angeles-area gay men who repeatedly tested negative 
for the virus by standard tests. 
</P>
<P>
Before the study, such "silent" HIV infections had been known to occur, but 
were considered rare. 
</P>
<P>
"The results are very shocking," said David T. Imagawa, a professor of 
pediatrics and microbiology-immunology at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in 
Torrance and the principal author of the study in today's New England Journal 
of Medicine. "We expected, if anything, to find very few (antibody-negative 
infected) individuals." 
</P>
<P>
Imagawa said the results re-emphasize the need for gay men, intravenous drug 
users and others in AIDS risk groups to refrain from donating blood and to 
practice safe sex -- even if they have tested negative for AIDS antibodies. 
Regardless of antibody test results, blood banks currently try to screen out 
and eliminate donations from those at risk of being infected. 
</P>
<P>
The team of researchers from UCLA, Northwestern University Medical School in 
Chicago and Cetus Corp. in Emeryville said they isolated the AIDS virus in 31 
of a group of 133 gay men who had tested antibody-negative. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dangerous Sexual Practices 
</P>
<P>
The researchers sought gay men who they thought were likely to be infected, 
despite negative antibody tests. Such men continued to engage in anal 
intercourse with multiple partners and other dangerous sexual practices. 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the scientists cautioned that their findings could not be 
generalized to others who have tested negative for AIDS antibodies, many of 
whom are at lower risk of infection and may never have been exposed to the 
virus in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a select group," Imagawa said. "We cannot provide an estimate of the 
proportion of (all) HIV infections that do not stimulate measurable 
antibodies." 
</P>
<P>
Antibody molecules are proteins produced by the body's immune system to fight 
foreign germs, such as the AIDS virus. AIDS antibodies are measured by standard 
tests called the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or "Western blot." 
</P>
<P>
Antibodies are commonly detected in the blood within several months of HIV 
infection. But previously a small number of infections had been recognized 
where the delay was one to three years or more. 
</P>
<P>
In a New England Journal of Medicine editorial also published today, William A. 
Haseltine of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston said the new data may 
have "encouraging" as well as "disquieting" implications. 
</P>
<P>
The "good news" is that the evidence that some infected men have not developed 
antibodies may suggest they are somehow warding off the disease. The 
replication of the AIDS virus "may be spontaneously suppressed by a combination 
of cellular, viral and immune mechanisms in far more people than has been 
supposed," Haseltine wrote. He suggested that physicians could learn how to use 
medications to similarly "induce prolonged remissions" in individuals who have 
already tested antibody-positive. 
</P>
<P>
But Haseltine acknowledged that the study raised the "sobering" possibilities 
that many of the antibody-negative sexual partners of antibody-positive 
individuals "may actually harbor silent infection" and that the AIDS virus "may 
be transmitted by blood and organ donors who are silently infected." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates that HIV may be transmitted by 
blood that has tested negative for AIDS antibodies at a rate of up to 1 
donation per 40,000. The CDC also estimates that between 1 million and 1.5 
million Americans are infected with the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
Another leading AIDS researcher expressed skepticism about the new data, which 
has not been independently confirmed. The researcher, who requested anonymity, 
said that related research to be presented next week at the international AIDS 
meeting in Montreal appears to contradict the UCLA finding of a substantial 
number of silent HIV infections in high-risk gay men. 
</P>
<P>
"It is such an unexpected result," the researcher said of the UCLA finding. "If 
it is true, it is very disturbing. "I would like to see it confirmed by another 
laboratory." 
</P>
<P>
The new report is part of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, an ongoing 
federally funded evaluation of nearly 5,000 gay men from the Los Angeles, 
Chicago, Pittsburgh and Baltimore-Washington areas. Since 1984 or early 1985, 
the volunteers have received semiannual exams and blood tests. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, about 50% of the 1,637 gay men from the Los Angeles area tested 
positive for AIDS antibodies and the rest tested negative, according to the 
report. Subsequently, the UCLA researchers participating in the project began 
an intensive effort to isolate HIV from the 133 antibody-negative men who 
continued to have high-risk sex. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers attributed their ability to find HIV in the blood of 31 of 
these men to the use of a variation on a standard laboratory culturing method 
for HIV isolation. These labor-intensive tests to grow the virus in the test 
tube cost hundreds of dollars each and are usually performed only in research 
laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
When the standard culture procedure -- commonly employed to isolate the virus 
from antibody-positive individuals -- was used, no virus was isolated from 
antibody-negative gay men. But when the variation on this method was used, the 
virus was isolated in the 31 men. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, four of the 31 gay men became antibody-positive 11 to 
17 months after HIV was first isolated. 
</P>
<P>
The other 27 men have remained antibody-negative for up to 36 months after the 
virus was first isolated. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the implications of the new data are not clear. For example, the 
researchers said they do not know if antibody-negative infected individuals are 
as infectious as those with positive antibody tests. Individuals with positive 
AIDS antibody tests presumably have larger amounts of HIV in their bodies than 
individuals who are infected with the virus but have never tested positive. 
</P>
<P>
"The unfortunate truth is that we are much better at proving who is infected, 
as opposed to proving that somebody is not infected," said Dr. Neil Schram, an 
AIDS specialist at the Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Harbor City and a member 
of the Los Angeles County Medical Assn. AIDS committee. 
</P>
<P>
Schram said that on the basis of the new data antibody-negative individuals who 
have engaged in high-risk sexual or intravenous drug use would need ongoing HIV 
testing. He also said that individuals who have, for example, resumed high-risk 
sex in a monogamous relationship after repeatedly testing antibody-negative 
could still be putting their partners at risk for infection. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Steven M. Wolinsky of Northwestern University Medical School, a co-author 
of the study, said that he will continue to advise patients that they are 
"unlikely to be infected" if they have remained antibody-negative for "a 
prolonged period of time" and have "eliminated activities that would put them 
at risk for acquiring the virus." 
</P>
<P>
Wolinsky's laboratory is in the process of performing another test that can 
diagnose silent HIV infection, called the polymerase chain reaction, on nearly 
3,000 antibody-negative gay men who are part of the national AIDS cohort study. 
This study, which Wolinsky said should be completed within a year, should 
provide a more accurate estimate of the frequency of silent HIV infections.

ELDER CARE: NEW BENEFIT FOR WORKERS

<P>
Jim West had a serious family crisis and didn't know what to do. 
</P>
<P>
His 74-year-old mother was diagnosed in January as having Alzheimer's disease, 
and she was living in Charleston, W. Va., where she had no friends or relatives 
to help her. West, who made his home hundreds of miles away in Boca Raton, 
Fla., knew little about the disease or how to care for someone with it. He was 
afraid he might have to take days or weeks off work to deal with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, West discovered that his employer, International Business 
Machines, last year began offering a nationwide counseling and referral service 
to aid employees in finding care for elderly parents and relatives. With that 
help, it took him only a three-day trip to arrange for his mother to move into 
a West Virginia retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called First-Class 
</P>
<P>
"It was a first-class service," said West, a 44-year-old manager with IBM. 
"They really helped me get through a difficult time." 
</P>
<P>
West is among the first of a growing number of workers enjoying what some labor 
experts say could become one of the fastest-growing employee benefits of the 
1990s: Elder care. 
</P>
<P>
Companies such as IBM are discovering that as people live longer, elder care is 
becoming just as important an employee benefit for many workers as child care. 
Surveys show that from one-quarter to one-third of all workers shoulder 
responsibility for elderly parents or relatives, and such duties often bring on 
stress that detracts from job performance. 
</P>
<P>
Some other big companies -- including First Interstate Bancorp, American 
Express, Stride Rite, and Travelers Corp. -- are including some sort of elder 
care option or insurance in employee benefits programs and expect them to pay 
off in increased productivity and peace of mind. Until recently, these programs 
had been offered primarily by government employers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Model Program 
</P>
<P>
In what some labor experts are hailing as a model for such benefit programs, 
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph over the weekend agreed with its two largest 
labor unions on a contract that includes a series of elder care provisions. The 
package includes generous leaves of absence, counseling and referral services, 
so-called "flexible spending accounts" that allow employees to set aside pretax 
earnings for elder care, and money to augment existing elderly care programs 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"Any company that wants to remain competitive and attract and keep good workers 
has to have a forward-looking family-care policy as part of its personnel 
policy," said Francine Zucker, public affairs director for the Communications 
Workers of America, the union representing AT&amp;T employees that negotiated 
the contract. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a Washington-based think 
tank, "With the aging of the work force, corporate support for elder care may 
become an important employee benefit of the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
The importance of the issue is not lost upon some members of Congress and state 
legislators. At least two bills pending in Congress would require companies to 
offer unpaid leaves of absence for employees wishing to attend to the illnesses 
of dependents, whether elderly or children. The Bush Administration and the 
business community, however, generally oppose requiring companies to allow such 
leaves, urging instead that they be voluntary programs. 
</P>
<P>
Mandatory programs have been proposed in several states, but only one -- 
Connecticut -- has enacted such a law. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody, however, disputes the demographic shifts that highlight the importance 
of elder care issues. 
</P>
<P>
The graying of America has created a growing "sandwich generation" of people -- 
many older baby-boomers in their 40s -- who must care for both parents and 
children simultaneously, creating for some a tremendous financial and emotional 
burden. For the first time in history, the average married couple have more 
parents than children, some experts say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Definition 
</P>
<P>
The definition of dependent care these days has expanded to include caring for 
the elderly as well as children. In 1987, there were nearly 30 million 
Americans over the age of 65 and 12.2 million over age 75. By the year 2020, 
the Census Bureau projects, the elderly population will have nearly doubled, 
representing more than 17% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
But increased mobility in society has often placed workers miles away from 
elderly parents, creating difficulties in providing care. In addition, the rise 
in two-earner couples places greater burdens on both husbands and wives to 
balance work with dependent care duties. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in women in the work force poses particularly tough challenges. 
Women have been the traditional care givers for elderly relatives, said Diane 
Piktialis, a vice president at Work/Family Elder Directions Inc., a Watertown, 
Mass., firm that provides elder care referral services for IBM and several 
other large companies. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the average woman will spend more time (18 years) as the daughter of an 
elderly dependent parent than as the mother of a dependent child (17 years), 
some researchers estimate. Some say women with careers are on a "daughter 
track." 
</P>
<P>
A recent survey of employees nationwide, conducted by Fortune magazine and John 
Hancock Financial Services, showed how providing for aging relatives can hurt 
job performance. It found that 38% of those with elder care responsibilities 
had to take unscheduled days off, 37% had late arrivals or early departures, 
and 30% reported being absent periodically. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune and John Hancock also surveyed executives in the nation's 1,000 largest 
companies. About 60% noticed work-related problems among employees caring for 
elders. 
</P>
<P>
Other surveys have shown that as many as 10% of workers providing care for 
elders quit their jobs each year, and that the average care giver spends 10 
hours a week in those duties, missing an average of five working days a year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Employee Sacrifices 
</P>
<P>
Some experts say that many more "sandwich generation" workers will be forced to 
quit jobs, take extended leaves or forgo promotions or training opportunities. 
This could strain employers already suffering from a shortage of well-educated 
and qualified workers because of other demographic shifts. 
</P>
<P>
Many companies' responses to these problems still are simply conducting 
studies. Some, such as Pitney-Bowes, Wang Laboratories and Florida Power &amp; 
Light, sponsor seminars or health fairs on aging issues, according to Hewitt 
Associates, an employee benefits consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Other firms are beginning to offer more direct services. 
</P>
<P>
Stride Rite, a shoe manufacturer, is expanding its child care center at its 
Cambridge, Mass., headquarters to include a day care center for elderly parents 
as well. Seniors at the center may share games and other activities with the 
youngsters. The center was set up after the company found that a quarter of its 
employees provided care for aging relatives, with an additional 13% expecting 
to do so within the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
"It was clear this was an issue we really needed to begin addressing," said 
Karen Leibold, Stride Rite's director of program development. 
</P>
<P>
Companies such as First Interstate Bancorp, American Express and Harnischfeger 
Industries in Milwaukee are offering long-term care insurance to employees 
seeking security against rising costs of nursing home care. Workers typically 
pay for the premiums through payroll deductions. 
</P>
<P>
Several firms, including IBM, Travelers, Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, Arthur 
Andersen &amp; Co., Colgate-Palmolive and Johnson &amp; Johnson, offer or plan 
to offer counseling and referral services. By calling a toll-free number, 
employees and their families generally can get information on community 
resources that can address their aging relatives' long-term care needs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Personal Touch 
</P>
<P>
Jim West, the Florida manager with IBM, said the service he used through the 
company even had a representative visit his mother in a retirement home on two 
separate occasions as a follow-up once she was placed there. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, the condition of West's mother has deteriorated, so he says he 
is again using the service to find more intensive care for her. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been more difficult for him to find a good agency without that 
kind of service," said Jim Smith, an IBM spokesman. "It would have taken a lot 
of phone calls, a lot of different visits." 
</P>
<P>
Companies such as Travelers and PepsiCo also provide flexible hours or flexible 
spending accounts. And various companies allow leaves of absence for employees 
to take care of elder or child dependents. 
</P>
<P>
IBM offers employees up to three years of unpaid leave, with full health and 
medical benefits during that period and a guaranteed job upon their return. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T's plan, part of a new contract awaiting ratification by its unions, 
will allow workers to take up to one year of unpaid leave within every two 
years of employment, while maintaining seniority and being guaranteed their old 
job or an equivalent one. Workers will receive full medical and dental benefits 
for the first six months of that year. 
</P>
<P>
And in what may be the first action of its kind by a major employer, AT&amp;T 
also agreed to establish a $5-million fund providing seed money to enhance or 
establish child or elder care facilities in communities where its workers are 
located. 
</P>
<P>
"A company that pays a lot of attention to family care, whether for newborns or 
older people, is a company that is probably going to attract the kind of 
bright, caring people we like to have into the 20th Century," said Burke 
Stinson, an AT&amp;T district manager.

WRIGHT RESIGNS, URGES END TO THIS 'MINDLESS CANNIBALISM'; 
</P>
<P>
SPEAKER DECLARES INNOCENCE IN IMPASSIONED HOUSE SPEECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Still protesting his innocence while beseeching Congress to "bring this period 
of mindless cannibalism to an end," Jim Wright (D-Tex.) announced Wednesday 
that he would resign from the House and become the first Speaker in history to 
be forced out of office. 
</P>
<P>
With tears filling his eyes, the Texas Democrat told his colleagues in a 
powerful, hourlong speech from the well of the chamber that it had become 
apparent Congress would not be able to turn fully to the nation's problems 
before it until the long ethics investigation of his finances is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'll tell you what," Wright said near the end of an oration that had 
held members in rapt silence. "Let me give you back this job you gave to me as 
a propitiation for all of this season of bad will that has grown up among us. 
Give it back to you. 
</P>
<P>
". . . I don't want to be a party to tearing up this institution -- I love it." 
</P>
<P>
Taking off his glasses and wiping his eyes, Wright said in a choked-up voice: 
"You need -- you need somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
Wright's dramatic abdication, anticipated for the last week, apparently ends a 
yearlong Ethics Committee inquiry that had produced 69 charges of rules 
violations against the Speaker and clears the way for the election of Majority 
Leader Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) to the Speaker's post next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
It caps an extraordinary period of less than a week in which another top House 
Democrat, Rep. Tony Coelho of Merced, has resigned as majority whip over 
questions about his finances; reports about an FBI investigation of the 
Democratic caucus leader have surfaced and allegations and rumors about other 
members have swept through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Amid indications that partisans now are primed for an open bloodletting to 
avenge scores on both sides, the Speaker, a 34-year veteran of the House, 
appealed for an end to the wave of ethics attacks with his departure. 
</P>
<P>
"In God's name, that's not what this institution is supposed to be all about," 
he declared. 
</P>
<P>
"When vengeance becomes more desirable than vindication, harsh personal attacks 
upon one another's motives and one another's character drown out the quiet 
logic of serious debate on important issues . . . . Surely that's unworthy of 
our institution, unworthy of our American political process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of the address, in which at times he roared with fury and at 
others whispered in a voice barely audible, the chamber erupted into a lengthy 
standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
While some Democrats lavished praise on him and expressed sympathy for his 
predicament, most clearly had been impatient for him to step down. 
</P>
<P>
The elevation of the more conciliatory Foley -- with his unsmirched reputation 
and wide popularity among Republicans as well as members of his own party -- 
would be a relief from the controversies swirling around Wright. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Caucus to Select Successor 
</P>
<P>
Wright said that he would serve as Speaker until the Democratic caucus chooses 
his successor at a session Tuesday. He said that he would resign his House seat 
representing a Ft. Worth district by the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
Since the ethics panel investigating his affairs cannot proceed against a 
former member, his move means that the charges now pending against him will 
become moot. Had he chosen to continue his fight against the charges, a bitter 
showdown on the House floor would have been virtually inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
In London, President Bush broke his silence on the Speaker's case by issuing a 
brief statement recalling their years of friendship. 
</P>
<P>
"In spite of the present situation, I believe the Wright tenure was one of 
effectiveness and dedication to the Congress of the United States," the 
President said. "And I recognize his distinguished service to the people of his 
congressional district. Barbara and I wish Jim and Betty well in whatever lies 
ahead." 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker, widely credited with helping end the fighting in Nicaragua by 
pushing for a cutoff in military aid to the anti-Communist rebels, said that 
his two years and five months as presiding officer of the House was one of the 
most productive in recent history. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Wright agreed with most of his fellow Democrats by concluding that 
he no longer could lead effectively on important legislation because of the 
attention focused on what he called his "petty personal finances." 
</P>
<P>
The ethics panel's decision by a 12-0 vote to issue a "statement of alleged 
violations" against Wright last April 17 started the erosion of his standing 
that had accelerated in recent weeks. He was accused of accepting improper 
gifts from a Ft. Worth business partner who had interest in legislation and of 
scheming to evade House limits on outside income through bulk sales of his 1986 
book, "Reflections of a Public Man." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ethics panel was reported to be ready to vote on whether to 
pursue additional charges against him. A disclosure that his top aide, John R. 
Mack, had been convicted of a vicious hammer-and-knife attack on a young woman 
in 1972, also provoked criticism. Mack has since resigned his post. 
</P>
<P>
Many members had concluded privately that the ethics inquiry eventually would 
lead to a House reprimand. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in funereal black, Wright, 66, began his speech by rebutting the 
charges against him in detail for 55 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
With his wife, Betty, watching from the gallery, Wright angrily rejected the 
ethics panel's allegations that $72,000 in salary she received from an 
investment company he co-owned, along with use of an apartment and a car, were 
illegal gifts, rather than income for work performed. Railing furiously against 
that conclusion, he declared that she had researched projects, studied stocks 
and visited drilling sites to guide the firm's investments. 
</P>
<P>
Waving a copy of his book in the air, he also insisted that about $57,000 in 
royalties from the volume were exempt from House limits on earned income and 
not, as the committee alleged, a scheme to evade the ceiling on speaking fees. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that he may have offended Republicans by being too partisan 
and that he did many things that he now would do differently, he said that he 
had broken no rules as he understood them. 
</P>
<P>
"Have I contributed unwittingly to this manic idea of feeding on other people's 
reputations?" Wright asked. "Have I caused a lot of this? So maybe I have; God, 
I hope I haven't, but maybe I have. 
</P>
<P>
"Have I been too partisan, too insistent, too abrasive, too determined to have 
my way? Perhaps. Maybe so. If I have offended anybody, any other party, I'm 
sorry. I never meant to. Would not have done so intentionally." 
</P>
<P>
Alluding to Friday's decision by Coelho to resign in mid-June and the airing of 
charges against other Democrats as well, Wright declared firmly: 
</P>
<P>
"All of us in both parties must bring this period of mindless cannibalism to an 
end -- there's been enough of it." 
</P>
<P>
Personal "vendettas" by "self-appointed vigilantes" in each party will cause 
lasting damage, he warned. "Let that (his resignation) be a total payment for 
the anger and hostility we feel toward each other." 
</P>
<P>
Democrats rose spontaneously in applause and, gradually, Republicans joined, 
including House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the first member to file 
charges against Wright, who had predicted repeatedly that he would be gone by 
the month of June. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Embraced by Colleagues 
</P>
<P>
As he walked away from the lectern, his eyes red-rimmed, Wright was embraced by 
many of his Democratic colleagues, including a few who had been privately 
suggesting that he resign to avoid further political damage to the party and to 
the House. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), who came to hear the speech, made a point of 
shaking the Speaker's hand. And crusty Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), speaking for 
the Texas delegation, declared: "There's an evil wind blowing in the halls of 
Congress that's reminiscent of the Spanish Inquisition . . . . Conviction 
without trial is a new and dangerous rule. It can destroy Congress." 
</P>
<P>
History, Brooks said, would commend Jim Wright as "a good man and a great 
Speaker." But history also would record that he was the first to hold the 
office -- third in line for the presidency -- who ever quit in mid-term for any 
reason and the first to be investigated so thoroughly on issues relating to 
personal finances.

SCHOOL DISTRICTS NOT LIABLE FOR CAMPUS VIOLENCE, COURT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
School districts may not be held liable for campus violence under a 1982 
anti-crime initiative, nor do they have a special duty under the measure to 
make schools safe, a state Court of Appeal ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The three-judge panel unanimously overturned a decision by an Alameda County 
trial judge -- the first of its kind in California -- that would have allowed 
parents to seek monetary damages against districts for failing to protect their 
children from harm. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate panel found that the "safe schools" provision of Proposition 8, 
the "victims' bill of rights," provides only a "general" constitutional right 
to campus security and that any steps to enforce such a right must be 
implemented by state legislators. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing in the (measure) to suggest that it was intended to create a 
civil action for damages or an affirmative duty to ensure that schools are free 
from all risk of crime and violence," Appellate Justice Clinton W. White wrote 
for the court. 
</P>
<P>
"The right proclaimed . . . although inalienable and mandatory, simply 
establishes the parameters of the principle enunciated; the specific means by 
which it is to be achieved for the people of California are left to the 
Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Widely Watched Legal Test 
</P>
<P>
The panel's 15-page opinion came only a week after arguments in the widely 
watched legal test of a provision of the far-ranging initiative that guarantees 
students and school staff members the right to attend "safe, secure and 
peaceful" schools. 
</P>
<P>
John P. MacMeeken of San Francisco, attorney for an Oakland woman suing local 
school authorities under the initiative, said he planned to appeal the decision 
to the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the ruling is contrary to the law and does a disservice to the 
children of Oakland and all the children of the state," MacMeeken said. "I'd be 
very disappointed if the Supreme Court doesn't review this case. I don't know 
anyone who's not fed up with violence in our schools." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Remcho of San Francisco, attorney for the defendant Oakland Unified 
School District, welcomed the ruling, saying that it correctly affirms that 
"school officials should be making decisions about school safety and how scarce 
dollars are spent, rather than judges imposing their own views of safety." 
</P>
<P>
The decision came in a suit brought in 1984 by Constance M. Hosemann of Oakland 
and her son Stephen R. Hosemann charging that school officials had failed to 
adequately protect the boy from being beaten, robbed and harassed by an older 
youth over a period of several years. In 1986, Alameda Superior Court Judge 
Richard Bartalini ruled that parents may sue school districts for damages under 
the initiative for failing to protect students from violence. Bartalini also 
ordered local officials to adopt a new security plan to combat crime on campus. 
</P>
<P>
A group of 40 local school districts, including the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, and state Schools Supt. Bill Honig backed Oakland officials in urging 
the panel to overturn Bartalini's decision. They warned that the ruling, if 
upheld, could force districts to take funds away from educational programs and 
spend them instead on security plans, insurance and legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Several law enforcement groups, education authorities and public officials 
joined the Hosemanns in arguing that the initiative's safe-schools provision in 
itself provided the legal tools to achieve its goal. No further legislation was 
needed to establish a district's potential liability for unsafe campuses or to 
allow judges to order new campus security programs, they said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Must Comply 
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's ruling, White, joined by Appellate Justices Betty Barry-Deal and 
Gary E. Strankman, agreed that all governmental agencies must comply with the 
initiative and are prohibited from "taking official actions which violate it or 
contravene its provisions." 
</P>
<P>
But the safe-schools declaration "merely indicates principles, without laying 
down rules" to implement those principles, White said. 
</P>
<P>
The justice cited a ruling last year in another case by a state Court of Appeal 
in Sacramento that also found the initiative could not be used as the basis for 
a damage suit against school districts. 
</P>
<P>
"We agree . . . that the (initiative) declares a general right without 
specifying any rules for its enforcement," White said. "It imposes no express 
duty on anyone to make schools safe. It is wholly devoid of guidelines, 
mechanisms or procedures from which a damages remedy could be inferred."

SPILL CONTINUES ITS DEVASTATING TOLL ON WILDLIFE

The Exxon oil spill has continued to kill animals and devour pristine waters 
off southern Alaska, and officials tracking the oil said Wednesday it has 
covered 9,600 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
The animal death toll also has continued to mount. Workers have collected 
22,868 dead, oily birds and 743 sea otters, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
reported. That represents a fraction of the wildlife killed by the oil, and 
regional director Walter Stieglitz said: "We're still counting its victims." 
</P>
<P>
More than $155 million has been spent by Exxon and the state and federal 
governments on cleanup since March 24, when the Exxon Valdez ran aground and 
spilled about 11 million gallons of oil into waters south of the Valdez oil 
terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper appointed a task force Wednesday to investigate the 
spill and recommend ways to prevent future spills. A new 5-cent tax on each 
barrel of oil from Alaska will finance the panel, which is made up of five 
Alaska residents, a former science adviser to three presidents and an 
environmental scientist. 
</P>
<P>
Oil tracker Marshal Kendziorek of the Department of Environmental Conservation 
has mapped the spill, and his documents show that 9,600 square miles of 
southern Alaska coastal waters have been affected by the oil. That makes the 
country's largest oil spill as big in size as the state of Vermont, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Oil has spread for eight weeks and has been tracked down Shelikof Strait to 
Wide Bay, 475 miles from where the Exxon Valdez ran aground, Kendziorek said.

ISRAELI PLANES BOMB GUERRILLA BASES IN LEBANON

SIDON, Lebanon

<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli warplanes Wednesday bombed Palestinian and pro-Iranian guerrilla bases 
on the outskirts of this southern port city. 
</P>
<P>
In Israel, the army reported that troops shot and killed three guerrillas on 
the border with Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanese police said a two-story command post used by three radical guerrilla 
factions in Sidon was demolished in one of Wednesday's two air raids. The 
attack began at 7 a.m., they said. 
</P>
<P>
At least five guerrillas were missing in the rubble and presumed killed, police 
said. At least three other guerrillas were wounded, they said. 
</P>
<P>
A statement by Israel's army command said the warplanes hit "two terrorist 
targets" east of Sidon. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said "the targets were headquarters and ammunition dumps of 
Hezbollah and Abu Nidal." It said plans for three recent guerrilla 
infiltrations into Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in southern Lebanon 
were made at the targeted sites. 
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is an Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim group active in Lebanon, and the 
Abu Nidal faction is a radical Palestinian guerrilla group operating outside 
the Palestine Liberation Organization with support from Syria and Libya. 
</P>
<P>
By police count, six people have been killed and 45 wounded in Israel's four 
previous raids into Lebanon this year. 
</P>
<P>
The killings of the three guerrillas on the Israeli-Lebanese border occurred 
during the third attempted infiltration in four days. 
</P>
<P>
The border incident occurred near the Lebanese village of Hula, about a mile 
west of the Israeli town of Kiryat Shemona, a military spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
He said troops spotted the three guerrillas, opened fire and killed them. The 
spokesman, who cannot be identified according to army regulations, said the 
Israelis suffered no casualties. 
</P>
<P>
Security sources said the area has been the site of increased troop activity in 
recent days, and reporters observed flares there. 
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, soldiers shot and killed a 20-year-old Palestinian in a clash 
in the Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis and wounded eight other Palestinians in 
clashes in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Arab doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, troops killed two guerrillas and captured two others after several 
rockets were fired into the Israeli border town of Metulla. George Habash's 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Damascus-based Palestine 
Liberation Front claimed responsibility for the rocket attacks.

FOREIGN MINISTER NAMED NEW JAPANESE LEADER

<P>
Ignoring opposition from enraged senior statesmen, outgoing Prime Minister 
Noboru Takeshita and the four top officials of the ruling Liberal Democratic 
Party decided Wednesday to name Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno, 66, as Takeshita's 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
Ryutaro Hashimoto, deputy secretary general of the party, said the decision was 
telephoned to Uno in Paris, where he was attending a meeting of the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. "After a pause," 
Hashimoto said, Uno accepted the job. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed on TV, Uno said he replied that "this is a time of unprecedented 
crisis for the Liberal Democratic Party, but I will entrust myself to the 
party." 
</P>
<P>
He was scheduled to return today to have his selection as president of the 
ruling party formalized Friday in a caucus of Liberal Democratic members of 
Parliament. The legislature would then elect him prime minister, possibly as 
early as Friday, after Takeshita and his Cabinet resign. 
</P>
<P>
Uno is well known to American leaders as an advocate of close relations with 
the United States. But his leadership ability is untested, and, unlike all 
previous Liberal Democratic prime ministers, he commands no faction or personal 
following within the party. 
</P>
<P>
He is expected to have to rely upon the party's strong men to help him tackle 
economic frictions with the United States and to revive the ruling party in the 
wake of a $7.7-million influence-buying scandal that precipitated Takeshita's 
decision to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita, 65, called the party executives together to make the decision after 
holding three futile meetings since Sunday with former Prime Minister Takeo 
Fukuda, 84, in an attempt to persuade the elder statesman to accept his 
recommendation of Uno. 
</P>
<P>
Fukuda, as well as former Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki, Susumu Nikaido, a former 
vice president of the party, and Toshio Komoto, a former deputy premier, all 
objected to Uno on the grounds that he is a lieutenant of the party faction 
that had been headed by former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. 
</P>
<P>
It was during Nakasone's 1982-87 administration that Recruit Co., an 
information and real estate conglomerate, conducted most of its 
influence-buying operations. Revelations of the scandal, which began emerging 
last June, have paralyzed Japanese politics. Takeshita, whose campaign coffers 
also benefited from Recruit's largess, decided April 25 to step down to assume 
his part of the responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Using a word for "company" that implies the equivalent of an American 
five-and-ten-cent store, Fukuda called Uno a "managing director of the Nakasone 
Company" responsible for the scandal and said his selection was "a challenge to 
the people." 
</P>
<P>
"I find the political consciousness of the party executives incomprehensible," 
Fukuda said. "I am completely astonished! My jaw could not drop farther! I 
could not be more apprehensive (of the future) for Japan." 
</P>
<P>
Fukuda warned that he intends to retain a free hand. 
</P>
<P>
"As a politician, I must deal with the reality that has occurred. I intend to 
retain the freedom to take actions of conscience," he said. He did not spell 
out what those actions might be. 
</P>
<P>
The outburst came despite a decision by the party executives and Takeshita to 
meet Fukuda's demands halfway by installing a vice president of the party under 
Uno to oversee the political reform regarded as crucial to win voters' support 
in an upper house election July 23. 
</P>
<P>
A group of about 40 younger Liberal Democrats issued a statement condemning 
Uno's choice. 
</P>
<P>
Fukuda had insisted on separating the leadership functions, choosing two 
leaders, one as prime minister and the other as party president. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders also reacted critically, declaring that Uno's administration 
will be a "Nakasone offshoot" that cannot be trusted to clean up the "money 
politics" of the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
As prime minister, Uno technically will be entitled to serve until the end of 
the present term of the lower house of Parliament in July, 1990, or until that 
chamber is dissolved for a general election before that date. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
His Term Not Specified 
</P>
<P>
Party executives failed to spell out in their decision whether Uno would be 
given the party president's normal two-year term or whether he would only serve 
out the remaining six months of Takeshita's term. 
</P>
<P>
By tradition, the prime minister must resign when his term as party president 
expires. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the length of Uno's term, however, the party clearly regards him as a 
"relief pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
With all of the party's leaders tainted by the Recruit scandal, the search for 
a successor had focused from the beginning on dark horses. Nonetheless, Uno's 
emergence came as a complete surprise. Until last Thursday, his name had not 
even been mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
After Takeshita announced his intention 36 days ago to resign when the fiscal 
1989 budget took effect, a consensus was reached quickly to tap the party's 
"Mr. Clean," Masayoshi Ito, chairman of its executive board. Ito, however, 
wanted all tainted party leaders to give up their seats in Parliament, and when 
his demand was rejected, turned down the job. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Takeshita came out for Uno as most qualified to take over at a 
time when trade frictions with the United States are at a new peak. Having 
served as foreign minister since the beginning of Takeshita's term in November, 
1987, Uno also is well versed in issues that will confront leaders at the 
seven-nation summit of advanced industrialized democracies to be held in Paris 
July 14-16, the prime minister said. 
</P>
<P>
To respond to the criticism of Uno's ties with himself, Nakasone announced 
Sunday that he would give up leadership of his 86-member faction and resign 
from the party. On Wednesday, Nakasone completed the procedures to carry out 
those pledges. 
</P>
<P>
He also handed over to party officials $400,000 of the profits his aides 
pocketed in stock transactions that Recruit made available to them 
preferentially and he promised to turn over the rest, or another $46,000, 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Nakasone took the action in line with a party recommendation that all Liberal 
Democrats who had traded stocks offered them by Recruit Co. "return the profits 
to society." The party will keep the funds until it makes a decision on how 
they should be used. 
</P>
<P>
Party leaders said today they will make one more -- and presumably final -- 
effort to persuade Kenzaburo Hara, speaker of the lower house, to resign in 
order to clear the way for Uno's election as prime minister Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties have declared they will boycott any attempt to elect the new 
leader unless Hara steps down to assume "responsibility" for allowing the 
ruling party to ram the fiscal 1989 budget through the lower house in the midst 
of an opposition boycott. 
</P>
<P>
Hara, however, has rejected calls from even the Liberal Democrats to resign. If 
Hara rejects today's request, the ruling party was expected to submit and vote 
for a resolution of non-confidence to oust him.

THE RESIGNATION OF JIM WRIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
WRIGHT REBUTTAL ON WIFE'S JOB, MALLICK'S ROLE AND BOOK DEAL

<P>
Jim Wright is not, by training, an attorney. But as his extraordinary address 
Wednesday to the jury of his peers demonstrated, the House Speaker has all the 
talents of a fine Texas lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
With his hands resting on his hips, his eyebrows flaring, his brow glistening 
with sweat, Wright got the chance for which he said he had "ached." The chance 
to "clear the air." The chance to stand up for what is "right and honorable." 
The chance to clear his name. 
</P>
<P>
Six weeks earlier, the House Ethics Committee, a panel of 12 of Wright's peers, 
charged the Speaker with 69 instances of financial impropriety. After a 
10-month investigation by a special attorney, the committee said in essence 
that Wright appeared to have schemed to get around House rules limiting what 
members can accept as gifts and as outside income. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Equivalent to Indictment 
</P>
<P>
The charges were the congressional equivalent of an indictment. Wright would 
still have an opportunity to defend himself in front of the committee before 
the committee would ask the House to find him guilty and approve punishment. 
</P>
<P>
By instead announcing his intention to resign as Speaker and then as a House 
member, Wright used Wednesday's speech to defend himself. 
</P>
<P>
He insisted that he faced not 69 charges but only three. The larger number, he 
said, represented multiple counts of three basic charges. He offered rebuttals 
to all three: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Betty Wright's employment. 
</P>
<P>
The Ethics Committee held that Wright and his wife, Betty, had improperly 
received $145,000 in gifts from Ft. Worth businessman George A. Mallick Jr. in 
the form of four years of salary for Betty Wright at $18,000 a year, as well as 
the use of a luxury car and an apartment in Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
Wright insisted that the salary, car and apartment represented compensation for 
services provided by Betty Wright to a company called Mallightco, an investment 
partnership wholly owned by the Wrights and Mallick and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Viewed as Sweetheart Deal 
</P>
<P>
Richard J. Phelan, special counsel to the Ethics Committee, viewed the 
investment firm as a sweetheart deal. Mallick put money in, he told the 
committee, and the Wrights took it out. 
</P>
<P>
Wright offered a different version. He said that he and the Mallicks were too 
busy to operate the company. So the work fell to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"How the committee could conclude that there was no evidence that Betty 
performed duties is very puzzling to me," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
He ticked off a few of her tasks. "She studied and followed the stock market on 
regional stocks," he said. "She went to New York and studied the gemstone 
business." Later, she studied "the wine culture industry." She considered an 
investment "in the movie 'Annie,' " he said. She even examined the possibility 
"of building apartment complexes for young people." 
</P>
<P>
Betty Wright recommended against making all these investments, Wright said. 
"It's lucky for us that she did," he added, "because people that invested in 
them lost money." 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Mallick's legislative interest. 
</P>
<P>
The Ethics Committee held that Wright violated House rules by accepting "gifts" 
from Mallick because Mallick had a direct interest in federal legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, how do they arrive at that suggestion?" Wright asked the House. "I've 
known this man more than 25 years. He's been my friend -- good, decent, 
hard-working man of Lebanese extraction. His father had a wholesale grocery 
store there. His grandfather came with a wagon, a cart." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Registered Lobbyist 
</P>
<P>
Mallick, Wright said, did not meet any of the House rules' definition of those 
who have an interest in legislation. He was not a registered lobbyist, he did 
not employ a registered lobbyist, he did not operate a political action 
committee and he was not someone who was known to have "a distinct and special 
interest in influencing or affecting the legislative process. 
</P>
<P>
"Never once in all the years I have known this man has he ever asked me to vote 
for or against any piece of legislation -- not once," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
The ethics panel said that Mallick qualified because of his extensive oil and 
gas investments and his special interest in taxes affecting the oil industry. 
"Every taxpayer's got an interest in the tax code," Wright countered. 
</P>
<P>
(In Ft. Worth, Mallick commented to the Associated Press on Wright's decision 
to step down: "I'm sad. The city of Ft. Worth and the state of Texas have lost 
a very, very good public servant. But I think that you will hear more from Jim 
Wright in the future." 
</P>
<P>
(Speaking later on Dallas radio station KRLD, Mallick said he hoped Wright's 
announcement would cool off the anger and political fire in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
("Let's hope that what he did today will douse that fire, will dull that fire," 
Mallick told the station. "Because if it doesn't, and they continue with this 
eye for an eye, they're all going to be walking around blind up there. And who 
is going to see the way to lead our country?") 
</P>
<P>
3 -- The Speaker's book. 
</P>
<P>
The Ethics Committee said that Wright deliberately evaded House limits on 
income from speaking fees by urging groups he addressed to buy boxes of his 
book, "Reflections of a Public Man." 
</P>
<P>
Organizations such as the Fertilizer Institute, the National Assn. of Realtors 
and the Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Assn. bought thousands of dollars worth of 
Wright's book, the committee held. At times, it said, they paid for more copies 
than were shipped to them. 
</P>
<P>
To the committee, Wright told the House, this "was kind of a sham and a 
subterfuge . . . a scheme for me to exceed and violate the outside earning 
limitations of the members of Congress. Do you think I'd do something like 
that? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Monetary Gain 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the book -- $3.25 is what I got out of it and I didn't get any 
advance -- was to publish something that could be sold at a small price and get 
wide distribution. If monetary gain had been my primary interest, don't you 
think I would have gone to one of the big Madison Avenue publications, the 
houses there that give you a big advance?" 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the author of "Mayflower Madam" received a $750,000 advance 
for her book. His predecessor as House Speaker, Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr. 
(D-Mass.), got a $1-million book advance. Author Kitty Kelley recently received 
a $2-million advance for a forthcoming book on Nancy Reagan. "As I understand 
it, it is not even her authorized biography," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said he was distressed that the Ethics Committee believes he would sell 
his honor for a few thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want the money," he said. "That's not important. What's important is 
the person's honor and his integrity."

THE RESIGNATION OF JIM WRIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
ANGRY DEMOCRATS APPEAR IN NO MOOD TO FORGIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In his emotion-charged speech Wednesday, House Speaker Jim Wright called for an 
end to "self-appointed vigilantes carrying out personal vendettas against 
members of the other party" and offered his own resignation as "a propitiation 
for all of this season of bad will that has grown up among us." 
</P>
<P>
It was clear Wednesday, however, that angry Democrats were in no mood to take 
such advice. 
</P>
<P>
"No way" can Democrats forgive or forget the trauma of Wright's resignation, 
declared Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.). "I feel like I'm in a battle zone . . . 
What is this, Nail a Congressman Day?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hounded From Office' 
</P>
<P>
"It was his (Wright's) intention to lift this cloud over the House but there 
are an awful lot of people who feel pain today, who feel he was hounded from 
office," agreed Rep. Gary L. Ackerman (D-N.Y.) as he stood on the steps outside 
the Capitol. "I'd hope we can resolve all this but I just don't see how it 
stops here." 
</P>
<P>
Wright's extraordinary speech, which held the House spellbound for more than an 
hour, capped a somber, wrenching day that many Democrats said was unparalleled 
in their political careers. As rumors that Wright's resignation was imminent 
were heard in the House, stories began spreading about other members who also 
allegedly would be the target of investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Already reeling from the Wright affair and Majority Whip Tony Coelho's 
announcement last week that he would resign from Congress rather than face a 
lengthy ethics investigation, Democrats were further shaken Tuesday by 
disclosures that Rep. William H. Gray III (D-Pa.), the highest ranking black 
member of Congress, may be the target of a Justice Department investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The seeming cascade of troubles prompted some members to question whether the 
House Democratic leadership is out of control. "Where does this end?" asked 
Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, an angry Gray reiterated his denials that he is under 
investigation. He distributed copies of a letter he had written to Atty. Gen. 
Dick Thornburgh in which he challenged the timing of leaks from the Justice 
Department to various news media. Gray, who chairs the House Democratic Caucus, 
has announced his candidacy to succeed Coelho in the No. 3 position in the 
Democratic leadership. 
</P>
<P>
David Runkel, a spokesman for the Justice Department, responded that Thornburgh 
will look into the situation and said that he shares Gray's concerns over leaks 
of governmental information. 
</P>
<P>
A federal law enforcement source said that the FBI is conducting a preliminary 
investigation into alleged payroll padding in Gray's office. However, the 
source said that he does not think Gray is considered a target of the inquiry 
at this time. 
</P>
<P>
None of this mollified Democrats anxious about where the next ethics bombshell 
might hit. Members "are holding their breaths around here," said Rep. Henry A. 
Waxman (D-Los Angeles), "waiting to see what happens from day to day. I've 
never seen anything like this." 
</P>
<P>
Wright's lengthy and forceful speech had an extraordinary effect on his 
colleagues. Members who commonly conduct noisy conversations with each other 
while colleagues speak from the rostrum sat riveted by his words. Some had 
tears in their eyes when he finished. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats and Republicans leaped to their feet and applauded when Wright urged 
them to end the spreading ethics controversies and return to the pressing 
policy issues before the House. They listened in silence when he thundered that 
none of them would want to be judged as he had been judged. 
</P>
<P>
Perspiring under television lights, the trembling, emotional Wright paused 
repeatedly to wipe his brow before continuing. When he finished, Democrats 
rushed to his side, some pumping his hand, others clapping him on the back or 
giving him bear hugs. Spectators in the galleries, who are usually admonished 
to refrain from any kind of display, stood and cheered. 
</P>
<P>
For some Republicans, the sight of House Democrats twisting in the wind was not 
unsatisfying. But they offered mixed reactions to the Speaker's political swan 
song. 
</P>
<P>
Wright's speech reminded Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) "of the 
closing scene of (the film) 'Inherit The Wind,' where you've got Fredric March 
playing William Jennings Bryan, totally consumed in his own rhetoric, 
self-deluded, without any remaining perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Wright, Cox said, "spent over an hour attempting to justify what could not be 
justified and attempting to call partisan that which was obviously nonpartisan. 
. . . He believes he has some special entitlement to the position (of Speaker) 
and is therefore unable to deal logically with bipartisan criticism." 
</P>
<P>
Another California Republican, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of Lomita, said: "This is 
not a day for gloating for Republicans. It's a sad day, but it's necessary as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, a former speech writer in the Ronald Reagan White House, called 
Wright's remarks "dignified and courageous," but added that Wright is no 
victim. "It's clear to everyone that he made some bad decisions and that now 
he's unfortunately having to suffer the consequences of those decisions." 
</P>
<P>
He added that the climate in Washington now is one in which "there is an 
extraordinary level of malevolence and ill will and personal attacks," most of 
which he blamed on Democrats seeking to move into leadership positions. "If 
there is an ugly cloud over Washington, the Republicans did not put it there," 
Rohrabacher asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's events began, appropriately enough, on a funereal note. House 
members offered speeches in memory of Rep. Claude Pepper (D-Fla.) who died 
Tuesday. But as one member after another rose to eulogize Pepper, they seemed 
more upset over the business that lay ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're doing now, death, that's the good news today," said Rep. Thomas J. 
Downey (D-N.Y.). "Later on, that's another matter entirely." 
</P>
<P>
The mood grew more macabre as news spread in the House Democratic cloakroom 
that Rep. James A. Traficant Jr. (D-Ohio) took an expenses-paid trip to West 
Germany in 1986 against the advice of the House Ethics Committee and failed to 
report the money on his annual financial disclosure report, according to a 
story in the Cleveland Plain Dealer. 
</P>
<P>
Soon a joke began spreading among aides that many congressional offices were no 
longer fielding journalist's inquiries, and instead were answering their phones 
with the comment: "He's already resigned." 
</P>

Here are excerpts of House Speaker Jim Wright's statement Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
For 34 years I have had the great privilege to be a member of this institution, 
the people's House, and I shall forever be grateful for that wondrous 
privilege. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And I love this institution. 
</P>
<P>
And I want to assure each of you that under no circumstances, having spent more 
than half of my life here, this House being my home, would I ever knowingly or 
intentionally do or say anything to violate its rules or detract from its 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
Now all of us are prone to human error. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ached to Tell Story 
</P>
<P>
For over a year, well, just about a year, I have ached to tell my side of the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
That to which I have to respond keeps changing. 
</P>
<P>
But today, silence is no longer tolerable; nor for the good of the House is it 
even desirable. 
</P>
<P>
So without any rancor and without any bitterness or any hard feelings toward 
anybody, I thank you for indulging me as I answer to you and to the American 
people for my honor, my reputation and all the things I've tried to stand for 
all these years. 
</P>
<P>
The past year, while the committee on standards has had these matters under 
advisement, I have ached for the opportunity to speak. Almost daily I besought 
them to let me come and answer whatever questions they had on their mind. 
Finally, on the 14th of September, they gave me one day in which to do that. 
</P>
<P>
I gratefully went and spent the whole morning and the whole afternoon answering 
as candidly and freely as possibly I could any questions that anyone would ask 
and I believe when I left everyone was reasonably well satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
Suffice to say that the five original charges that had been lodged were 
dropped, dismissed. In their place, however, came three additional charges. 
Some said 69. The 69 are merely a matter of multiple counting of the three. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
The three questions are these: 
</P>
<P>
Did my wife Betty's employment, at $18,000 a year for some four years, by a 
small investment corporation which she and I formed with friends of ours, 
George and Marlene Mallick, and the attendant benefits of that employment -- 
use of an apartment when she was in Ft. Worth on company business and the use 
of a company-owned car -- constitute merely a sham and a subterfuge and a gift 
from our friend Mr. Mallick? Was Betty's employment and those things related to 
it a gift? 
</P>
<P>
You've read in papers the suggestion made by committee counsel that I may have 
received up to $145,000 in gifts from my friend Mr. Mallick. Half of it, 
$72,000, was Betty's income, Betty's salary. The other half involved the use of 
a car and the use of an apartment on a per diem basis. . . . 
</P>
<P>
First question I should like to, I suppose you might be asking, why was Betty 
working for the corporation? Why did we put her to work at $18,000 a year? 
</P>
<P>
Wife Did Work 
</P>
<P>
Betty alone among all of us had the time and the opportunity, and the 
experience and the desire to give effort and energy to exploring and promoting 
investment opportunities. She did indeed perform work, and it paid off for the 
little corporation. . . . 
</P>
<P>
She advised as to when was a good time to sell, when was a good time to buy and 
the corporation made some money on those regional stocks -- not a lot of money 
by some people's standards. But we made some money. Betty paid for her salary 
several times over. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I want to include for printing in the record affidavits from several business 
people who know from their personal experience and attest to the work that 
Betty did in this regard. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And here's the irony. The supreme irony. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, when I was elected majority leader, Betty voluntarily left her job as 
a professional staff person on the committee so as to avoid any criticism of 
this institution or of her husband on the ground that we were both on the 
public payroll. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In addition to her salary as a gift, outside counsel contends in summing up 
$145,000 (inaudible) that Betty had the use of a company car. That is true, she 
did. For the first three years, it was used largely by Mr. and Mrs. Mallick. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't Mr. Mallick's car. It was the company car. The company bought and 
paid for it. We owned half of it. The next four years Betty had most of the use 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
Now I've done what I can to resolve any doubt. . . . I bought and paid for that 
car out of my personal funds. The trustee of my bank trust, at my instruction, 
paid the corporation full book value for the car on the day Betty first started 
driving it on company business, through the whole time she had it in her 
possession, plus interest. The interest amounted to about $9,000. 
</P>
<P>
What more can I do. Does that make it right? 
</P>
<P>
Now concerning the apartment, Betty and I . . . didn't think there was anything 
wrong with paying a per diem rate. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, last year I said to George Mallick, I said, I want to buy the 
apartment, George, I'll pay you for it. I did. I paid the amount suggested and 
appraised by two real estate persons in Ft. Worth, $58,000. Now if anybody 
thinks that's too low a price I'll sell it to you today for $58,000. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The second alleged violation . . . further assumes that George Mallick, our 
friend and business partner, had a direct interest in influencing legislation, 
which would make it illegal for us to accept gifts from him. 
</P>
<P>
Now how do they arrive at that suggestion? I've known this man for more than 25 
years. He's been my friend, good, decent, hard-working man of Lebanese 
extraction. 
</P>
<P>
Never once in all the years that I've known this man has he ever asked me to 
vote for or against any piece of legislation. Not once. . . . 
</P>
<P>
All people have an interest of some kind in the results of legislation, don't 
they? That's not what we're talking about. We're talking about whether or not 
they have a direct interest in trying to influence the course of legislation. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Well, the people who wrote the rules don't think George Mallick had an interest 
in the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
David Obey was the chairman of the committee that drafted those rules. He 
asserts clearly, unequivocally, emphatically, unambiguously, both in an 
affidavit that he wrote and the report he wrote for the Washington Post that 
doesn't fit George Mallick's case. . . . Harold Sawyer, former Republican 
member from Michigan, who served on that committee with David Obey, says the 
same thing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sale of a Book 
</P>
<P>
Now the only other basic question, it's just one that remains, in the statement 
of alleged violations, concerns the sale of a book, a little book now you'll 
recall, "Reflections of a Public Man," which I wrote and which was sold 
sometimes in bulk quantities. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Now, the contention of the committee as I understand it is that this book 
project to publish that book on which I got $3.25 for every book that sold was 
a kind of a sham and a subterfuge itself and an overall scheme for me to exceed 
and violate the outside earnings limitation of a member of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
I mean, do you think I'd do something like that? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the book -- $3.25 is what I got out of it, and I didn't get any advance 
-- the purpose of the book was to publish something at a small cost and get 
wide distribution. If monetary gain had been my primary interest, don't you 
think I would have gone to one of the big Madison Avenue publications, the 
houses there that give you a big advance? . . . 
</P>
<P>
It couldn't have been an overall scheme to avoid outside earning limits because 
the rules are clear. . . . The rules expressly exempt royalty income. . . . 
</P>
<P>
During that three-year period when the counsel says there are seven instances 
where I made speeches to groups and they bought copies of these books, seven 
groups, seven instances, I made at least 700 speeches, for which I didn't get 
any honorarium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
All of us, in both political parties, must resolve to bring this period of 
mindless cannibalism to an end. 
</P>
<P>
There has been enough of it. 
</P>
<P>
I pray to God that we will do that and restore the spirit that always existed 
in this House. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Well, I tell you what: I'm going to make you a proposition. Let me give you 
back this job you gave to me as a propitiation for all of this season of bad 
will that has grown up among us; give it back to you. 
</P>
<P>
I will resign as Speaker of the House effective upon the election of my 
successor and I'll ask that we call a caucus on the Democratic side for next 
Tuesday to choose a successor. 
</P>
<P>
I don't want to be a party to tearing up the institution. I love it. 
</P>
<P>
To tell you the truth, this year, it has been very difficult for me to offer 
the kind of moral leadership that the organization needs because every time I 
have tried to talk about the needs of the country, about the needs for 
affordable homes, Jack Kemp's idea or an idea that we are developing here, 
every time I have tried to talk about the need for minimum wage, tried to talk 
about the need for day care centers, embracing ideas on both sides of the 
aisle, the media have not been interested in that. 
</P>
<P>
They wanted to ask me about petty personal finances. 
</P>
<P>
You need somebody else. . . . 
</P>
<P>
We'll have a caucus on Tuesday. And then, I will offer to resign from the House 
sometime before the end of June. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I am not a bitter man. I am not going to be. I am a lucky man. 
</P>
<P>
God has given me the privilege of serving in this, the greatest institution on 
Earth, for a great many years, and I am grateful to the people of my district 
in Texas, I am grateful to my colleagues, all of you. 
</P>
<P>
God bless this institution. God bless the United States.

3 APPOINTED TO 'CLEANSE' TEAMSTERS OF CORRUPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Labor Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A well-respected former federal judge, an aggressive ex-Wall Street prosecutor 
and a highly regarded labor lawyer were named Wednesday to oversee the 
operations of the scandal-ridden Teamsters Union as part of the settlement of 
an unprecedented civil racketeering suit against the 1.6-million-member union. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein announced the appointments of the 
overseers at a brief hearing in New York. He said the appointments were an 
"important first step" in "cleansing the union of corrupt influences and 
establishing democratic self governance." 
</P>
<P>
Frederick B. Lacey, a former federal judge and U.S. attorney in New Jersey, 
will serve as administrator of the union until late in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Charles M. Carberry, former head of the commodities and securities fraud unit 
in the U.S. Attorney's office in New York and spearhead of insider trading 
prosecutions against Ivan F. Boesky, Dennis B. Levine and Martin A. Siegel, was 
tapped to serve as an "investigations officer" for the union, with the power to 
bring charges against union officials and employees. 
</P>
<P>
Michael H. Holland, a Chicago labor lawyer and former general counsel of the 
United Mine Workers of America, was picked to supervise Teamster elections in 
1990 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
On March 14, Judge Edelstein approved a consent decree to settle a massive 
civil racketeering suit the Justice Department had filed against the union in 
June, 1988. The suit alleged that the union, three of whose presidents had been 
convicted of federal crimes and sent to prison, was dominated by organized 
crime and had "made a devil's pact" with the Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agree to Reforms 
</P>
<P>
The consent decree settling the suit left most of the union's top officials, 
including President William J. McCarthy, in place. In exchange, though, 
Teamster officials agreed to change the union's constitution to permit direct 
election of the union's top officers and to allow three court-appointed 
officials to oversee its operations and elections for the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
"The public has a significant stake in the outcome of the decree," Judge 
Edelstein said Wednesday. The Teamsters Union "exercises vast power and cuts 
across every segment of society. It affects every aspect of our lives. Such 
power must be insulated against corruption and criminal elements. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Lacey, 68, a former U.S. attorney and federal district court judge in Newark, 
will have the power to discipline and fire Teamster officials, appoint 
temporary trustees to run local unions and veto proposed union expenditures. 
Harold N. Ackerman, a federal district judge in Newark who handled a major 
racketeering case the government brought against a large New Jersey Teamster 
local, praised Lacey as having been an "outstanding prosecutor and one of the 
finest federal judges in the country." 
</P>
<P>
sh Has Broad Authority 
</P>
<P>
Carberry, 38, now a partner in the New York office of Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; 
Pogue, one of the nation's largest law firms, will have broad authority to 
investigate alleged instances of corruption in the union. "He'll do a very good 
job," said Ira Lee Sorkin, former director of the New York office of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Holland, 42, has had experience in direct referendum elections for union 
officials during his tenure at the Mine Workers, one of the few unions in the

ARGENTINE RIOTING SUBSIDES; EMERGENCY LAWS ENACTED

A wave of food riots began to subside Wednesday as the government set up 
emergency soup kitchens and handed out rations of essentials, but growing 
shortages of food and cash raised the specter of renewed conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Police reported that a few supermarkets were sacked and that officers clashed 
with mobs in a few poor areas, but the disorder was on a far lesser scale than 
on Monday and Tuesday, when several hundred stores were ransacked. 
</P>
<P>
In some areas, shopkeepers gave away their stock to avoid being attacked, but 
elsewhere owners defended their stores with firearms, in three instances 
reportedly killing would-be looters in the Buenos Aires suburb of Moreno. 
Crowds roved some areas armed with sticks and guns, demanding food from stores. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities confirmed eight deaths since Sunday, but unofficial accounts put 
the toll at up to 17, with hundreds wounded in one of the nation's most serious 
outbreaks of civil unrest, triggered by hyperinflation that sent prices of 
basic goods out of reach of most Argentines. More than 2,000 people reportedly 
have been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The Congress on Wednesday enacted emergency measures and a package of laws 
raising taxes and reducing subsidies to provincial industrial programs, 
designed to cut back a huge government deficit that is seen as a key cause of 
the inflation, which surged to about 70% for May alone. 
</P>
<P>
Although a high-tension peace returned to most areas, residents warned that 
none of the emergency measures addressed the basic problems of impossibly high 
prices and shriveling wages. Banks limited withdrawals and exchange houses 
stayed closed for lack of currency, leaving people short of cash. Many shops 
that escaped the pillaging remained shuttered, creating difficulties in 
obtaining goods in the worst-hit areas of greater Buenos Aires and the city of 
Rosario. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot sing a victory song, we can only say that nothing is happening now 
-- not that nothing will happen later," said Interior Minister Juan Carlos 
Pugliese, in charge of the security operation. 
</P>
<P>
Bread companies, ordered Tuesday to limit prices, threatened to shut down in 
protest today and Friday, saying the prices were below their production costs, 
which would further aggravate growing shortages. The largest commercial 
organization called on the government for "a greater severity and firmness in 
stopping the pillage." 
</P>
<P>
In Rosario, the second-largest city about 165 miles northwest of Buenos Aires, 
the provincial deputy governor, Antonio Vanrell, told reporters: "The problem 
now is food. We have problems feeding the 1,000 people in custody -- and the 
security reinforcements." 
</P>
<P>
President Raul Alfonsin and President-elect Carlos Saul Menem of the Peronist 
party agreed in a meeting on the need for the 30-day state of siege imposed by 
Alfonsin on Monday night to restore order. 
</P>
<P>
Menem, elected in a landslide on May 14, said he and Alfonsin did not discuss 
demands from labor and business leaders that Menem's inauguration be moved 
forward from Dec. 10. Many sectors have called for an early transition to end 
uncertainty and to allow the new government to begin implementing its programs. 
</P>
<P>
Menem disclosed that his economy minister, the most important appointment in 
the context of the current crisis, will be Miguel Roig, an executive of Bunge 
&amp; Borg, a grain-exporting conglomerate. The president-elect said he hopes 
the choice of a business leader will reassure the jittery financial sector. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the capital Tuesday night, an eerie calm descended as stores, 
theaters and restaurants closed early and workers raced home, even though there 
were no reports of incidents within the city. However, many shops stayed open 
late Wednesday night as owners were emboldened by the returning calm. 
</P>
<P>
The worst of the conflict occurred in the ring of lower-middle-class industrial 
towns around the capital, such as San Miguel and Moreno, where most of the 
region's more than 10 million people live. There, nearly every shop stayed shut 
all day Wednesday, schools were closed and buses refused to venture into 
troubled areas.

SHEVARDNADZE CITES OTHER NATO FORCES AS A COMPLICATION

Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze declared Wednesday that French 
and British forces stationed in West Germany could complicate President Bush's 
proposal for cutting U.S. and Soviet troops in Europe to equal levels. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze's comment, made as he left Paris on his way home to Moscow, fit 
with several other Soviet warnings that finishing the conventional arms talks 
in Vienna on the accelerated schedule suggested by Bush would prove extremely 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze, while again welcoming Bush's initiatives in general, described 
himself as "pessimistic" on the swift U.S. timetable put forth Monday in 
Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish to point out that British and French forces in West Germany represent 
100,000 men, and this disturbs the balance," Shevardnadze added, indicating one 
reason for his caution. 
</P>
<P>
Britain and France are part of the 23-nation conventional disarmament talks 
under way in Vienna. Their troops in West Germany have been expected to be 
included in the talks, as have the troops of Soviet allies in Eastern Europe.

U.S. TROOP CUT WOULD SAVE RELATIVELY LITTLE, EXPERTS SAY 
</P>

President Bush's surprise offer to cut 30,000 U.S. troops and associated 
weapons in Europe would produce relatively small budget savings, U.S. lawmakers 
and arms control experts said Wednesday, even though the defense of Europe has 
absorbed more than half of the U.S. defense budget for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's proposal could save more than $1 billion per year, mostly in troop pay, 
experts said. To a deficit-weary Congress eager to find budget savings at the 
Pentagon, that would provide a welcome benefit, even in a Pentagon budget that 
is about $300 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
And if subsequent negotiations with the Soviet Union result in the wholesale 
removal of U.S. military units and weaponry from Europe, experts said savings 
could be reaped not only from the personnel cuts but also from the closure of 
military headquarters and some U.S. bases in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials, however, have cautioned that reductions more likely 
would leave America's 4 2/3 divisions in Europe intact but less fully manned. 
</P>
<P>
In the short term, Bush's proposal would entail costs as well as savings. 
Congressional budget analysts estimated that it might cost the United States as 
much as $250 million to withdraw the 30,000 U.S. troops at one time. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the new willingness to negotiate limits on aircraft and short-range 
nuclear systems could be costly if the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
introduced more modern weapons to compensate for the reduced numbers. 
</P>
<P>
A treaty with the Soviet Union limiting particular kinds of weapons also could 
require costly procedures to destroy existing weapons and to monitor each 
side's compliance with the accords. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the potential for only limited budgetary savings, Democrats in Congress 
praised Bush's initiative as a first step. 
</P>
<P>
"The President hit all the right chords with his proposals on conventional arms 
reductions in Europe," said House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin 
(D-Wis.), who has urged Bush to respond aggressively to Soviet arms-control 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to look at the fine print to see how much money this might save the 
American taxpayer," Aspin added. "If all the U.S. troops removed from Europe 
under his proposal are demobilized as the President has said, the savings will 
be substantial." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) hailed Bush's proposal as the first step in a 
process promising bigger savings in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the summit, this is Base Camp One," Schroeder said. "If this is 
seen as the end of the process and not the beginning, then everybody's going to 
revolt." 
</P>
<P>
Defense Department officials cautioned that political and military motives 
drove Bush's initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposal . . . was not offered for budgetary reasons," Pentagon spokesman 
Pete Williams said. "It was proposed as an incentive to encourage agreement on 
conventional forces reductions in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Joshua M. Epstein, a Brookings Institution arms control expert, pointed out 
that the Soviet Union has proposed reducing NATO and Warsaw Pact forces in 
Europe by about 25% below the levels envisioned by Bush. The President's plan 
would leave NATO force levels about 10% lower than at present, although it 
would require much deeper cuts by the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
"In the long term, really significant savings would require the kinds of 
further reductions and restructuring that the Soviets have proposed," said 
Epstein. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who has sponsored legislation calling for the unilateral removal of 
thousands of troops from Europe, said that future talks should try to reduce 
U.S. forces in Europe to a training command and a headquarters unit that could 
coordinate the rapid return of American troops in a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
If such efforts succeed, independent analysts and Pentagon officials say, much 
larger budget savings loom on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea that you're going to save huge bucks by taking out a division 
is just nonsense," said one military officer familiar with the Bush proposal. 
"But if this succeeds, you're going to save money in a much more general sense, 
as future defense budgets begin to respond to a smaller Soviet threat." 
</P>
<P>
At that point, the officer said, Congress and the Pentagon may safely scale 
back defense research and development, reduce equipment modernization and 
accept still smaller armies. 
</P>
<P>
"These kinds of savings dwarf the idea of just taking out a few troop 
carriers," the official said.

Owen Lattimore, a China scholar who was accused by Sen. Joseph McCarthy in 1950 
of being "the top Soviet espionage agent in the United States," died here 
Wednesday. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
Lattimore, who suffered a stroke last year, had been in failing health the past 
two weeks, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
Lattimore grew up in China, and spent nearly 25 years in the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1950, McCarthy made his much-quoted assertion that Lattimore was the 
nation's top communist sympathizer. The Wisconsin Republican later toned down 
his charge to "one of the top" agents. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually a Senate subcommittee cleared Lattimore of all of the charges, 
declaring them baseless, but that was not the end of his public ordeal. A 
federal grand jury indicted him in 1952 for perjury in testimony before the 
committee and the charges lingered until 1955, when the Justice Department 
dropped them for lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Lattimore never earned a university degree, instead going into business and 
doing newspaper work in Shanghai and Beijing from 1920 to 1926. He studied at 
Harvard in 1929 before beginning research in Manchuria later that year. He 
conducted more research in Peking from 1930 to 1935, also working in Mongolia. 
</P>
<P>
From 1941 to 1942 he served as a political adviser to Chiang Kai-shek, the 
leader of the Nationalist government. He then became deputy director of Pacific 
operations for the U.S. Office of War Information, serving until 1944. 
</P>
<P>
From 1934 to 1941, he edited Pacific Affairs, a journal of the Institute of 
Pacific Relations. Lattimore was the director of the Walter Hines Page School 
of International Relations at Johns Hopkins University from 1939 to 1953, and 
lectured at Johns Hopkins from 1938 to 1963. 
</P>
<P>
During his legal troubles, Lattimore resigned his job at the Page school but 
stayed on as a lecturer at Johns Hopkins. 
</P>
<P>
Among Lattimore's books are, "High Tartary" (1930), "Manchuria, Cradle of 
Conflict" (1932), "Inner Asian Frontiers of China" (1940) and "Ordeal by 
Slander" (1950). 
</P>
<P>
Lattimore's wife, Eleanor, died in the mid-1960s. His son, David Lattimore of 
Pawtucket, is a professor in the department of East Asian studies at Brown 
University. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his son, Lattimore is survived by a sister, six grandchildren 
and two great-grandsons. 
</P>
<P>
A family member said Lattimore's remains will be cremated and a memorial 
service will be held at a later date.

Two Nicaraguan diplomats who arrived in Washington just 10 days ago were 
ordered home by the State Department in retaliation for the expulsion of two 
American envoys from Managua last week. The Nicaraguan Embassy was told that 
Roberto Vargas and William Vigil, both minister counselors, are "no longer 
acceptable," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said, emphasizing that 
there were no allegations of improper behavior. Last Thursday, Nicaragua 
expelled U.S. economic attache Joel F. Cassman and a visiting U.S. labor 
attache based in Honduras, Kathleen Barmon, on grounds they had interfered in 
domestic affairs by urging schoolteachers to strike for higher wages.

An American writer for the U.S. magazine Soldier of Fortune -- who once fought 
alongside Afghan guerrillas -- died of gunshot and shrapnel wounds suffered 
during battles between Burmese troops and border rebels. Lance Eugene Motley, a 
32-year-old West Point graduate from Sacramento, was taken to Thailand's Mae 
Sot Hospital where he died, medical aides said. Police said Motley apparently 
crossed into Burma with ethnic Karen rebels and went to their camp at Kaw Moo 
Ra, which has been besieged by Burmese troops.

The United States is extending a program allowing certain foreign visitors into 
the country without a visa to include four more nations, the State Department 
announced. The entry privileges, granted under a test program running through 
1990, will now be given to citizens of France, the Netherlands, Switzerland and 
Sweden, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. Earlier this month, 
President Bush announced that Italians and West Germans would be able to enter 
the United States without visas under a pilot program. First authorized in 1988 
for citizens of Britain and Japan, the program permits a visa-free stay of up 
to 90 days in the United States.

Local Swedish politicians in the Stockholm suburb of Kista, apparently reacting 
to public uproar, dropped plans to send a group of eight teen-age offenders on 
a six-month rehabilitation cruise to the Caribbean at taxpayer expense. The 
teen-agers, convicted of crimes such as assault, theft and burglary, were 
candidates for the $80,000 cruise. At least three social workers would have 
accompanied them. None of the eight are serving prison sentences, although they 
must report regularly to the authorities. Their behavior was deemed so bad that 
no halfway house would accept them.

Chile's President Augusto Pinochet said his lame-duck military government and 
the opposition have agreed on democratic changes in the nation's constitution. 
The accord came after two months of unprecedented negotiations and paved the 
way for a national referendum, probably in August, to approve the amendments. 
Patricio Aylwin, leader of a 17-party opposition coalition, said the reforms 
"open the road for an orderly transition to a fully democratic regime." 
Pinochet, who was defeated in a plebiscite last October, would say only that 
the reforms include changes that will make it easier for the new Congress to 
approve further constitutional alterations.

Pope John Paul II, who begins a five-nation, 10-day tour of Scandinavia today, 
will encounter religious anti-Catholicism that is little changed since the 
excommunication of Martin Luther in 1520. In Norway, most Lutheran bishops have 
refused to attend a common prayer meeting, and in Denmark, Protestant bishops 
have threatened to boycott the visit if the Pope is allowed to speak in the 
country's royal cathedral. Only in Finland, which has two state churches -- 
Lutheran and Greek Orthodox -- is the visit to take on the form of an 
integrated ecumenical meeting.

A prison brawl that involved up to 400 inmates and left nearly 30 men injured 
was prompted by racial tensions, a official of the California Correctional 
Center at Susanville said. Chief Deputy Warden Michael Pickett said the melee, 
which spread into 11 dormitories, apparently was related to continuing tension 
between black and latino prisoners. The fighting broke out Monday night in a 
50-man dormitory and quickly spread. "It was like a domino effect," Pickett 
said. Twenty-eight inmates and one guard were injured, none seriously. Guards 
broke up the brawl, firing one warning shot.

South Korean prosecutors indicted a dissident priest for breaching national 
security laws by making a 10-day unauthorized visit to Communist North Korea. 
The Rev. Moon Ik Hwan is charged with entering a region controlled by an 
"anti-state group" and supporting North Korea's aggressive policies against the 
south. Moon's alleged offenses could theoretically incur the death penalty. The 
71-year-old Presbyterian pastor publicly backed North Korean leader Kim Il 
Sung's proposal for a confederation of the two states pending total 
reunification. Seoul says it is committed to detente with the north, but that 
all contacts must occur through official channels.

Israel has jailed more than 5,000 Palestinians without trial since the uprising 
began in the occupied territories 17 months ago, "the vast majority in harsh 
conditions," according to Amnesty International. A report by the London-based 
human rights movement said Israel's policy of "administrative detention," or 
imprisonment without trial, is being used against non-violent opponents, 
denying them adequate legal counsel and violating "fundamental human rights." 
The group said that most detainees are held for six months.

SOUTH PASADENA SCHOOL TAX PLAN WIDELY BACKED 
</P>

<P>
Say tax in this fiscally conservative city and, most of the time, get ready to 
duck. 
</P>
<P>
But Proposition A, a proposed education parcel tax that will be considered by 
the voters in a special election Tuesday, is different. Instead of clamorous 
protest, it is attracting harmonious across-the-board support, with everybody 
from PTA presidents to traditional tax-bashing organizations praising the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's significant that factions in this community who never agreed on 
anything in the past are all throwing their support behind this initiative," 
said Jessica Katz, a mother of two students who is managing the campaign for 
Proposition A. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would impose a $98-a-year tax on each parcel in the city for five 
years. To pass, the measure must be approved by two-thirds of the voters. 
</P>
<P>
What is the broad appeal of Proposition A? "You kind of get a double coupon 
there," said Thomas Biesek, a member of the South Pasadena Taxpayers Assn. and 
a frequent critic of public spending in the city. "You get to educate your 
children in a premium school district and, at the same time, you get to protect 
your property values." 
</P>
<P>
It is an article of faith among longtime residents that South Pasadena's five 
schools -- three elementary schools, a junior high school and a high school -- 
have boosted property values because of their consistently high scores on state 
achievement tests. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to Proposition A has been only sporadic. Harold Bauer, a retired Los 
Angeles school principal, has argued in letters to the editors of local 
newspapers and on local talk shows that the tax is unnecessary. A state budget 
surplus combined with Proposition 98, an initiative approved by voters last 
year, should significantly beef up the South Pasadena Unified School District's 
budget, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"We're running a quiet, word-of-mouth campaign," Bauer said. "We don't have a 
dime." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Than $20,000 Raised 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the Support South Pasadena Schools committee has raised more than 
$20,000, which has been used to hire a consultant, run surveys, distribute 
printed publicity and mail absentee ballot applications to the parents of each 
of the district's 3,500 students. 
</P>
<P>
By most estimates, that kind of effort may be necessary. The San Marino Unified 
School District has twice failed to gain the requisite two-thirds majority, in 
1985 and 1986, despite extensive coalition building beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand that the (San Marino) district did do a considerable amount of 
legwork to get as many groups together as possible," said Robert Thompson, San 
Marino's assistant superintendent for business, who was hired after the failed 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
The South Pasadena measure was proposed last fall by a citizens committee after 
a one-day teachers' strike on Oct. 19 demonstrated the district's fund 
shortages. Not only were teachers among the lowest paid in the county -- 42nd 
out of 43 districts -- but the district was being forced to cut educational 
extras to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
A subsequent settlement raised teacher salaries by 10%. But District Supt. Lou 
Joseph said the district has had to cut $1.2 million from other programs and 
resources in the last two years. Such items as learning labs that focus on 
individual difficulties, some English-as-a-second-language classes and some 
extracurricular programs have been eliminated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Class Sizes Edging Upward 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, class sizes have been slowly edging upward, Joseph said. 
Elementary school classes can be as large as 33 students, while junior high 
classes go up to 36. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my eighth year in the district," said music teacher Jim Macomber, 
president of the Teachers Assn. of South Pasadena. "I've seen the money get 
tighter and tighter." He said that students often have to share textbooks and 
that classes occasionally run out of paper. 
</P>
<P>
"In my own program, it's gotten to the point where 80% of our money comes from 
fund raising," Macomber said. Instrumental music students staff a concession at 
high school football games, peddle Christmas wrapping paper and sell tickets to 
a Dodgers baseball game to raise funds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents are beginning to notice the changes. Last year's California Assessment 
Program tests showed that two out of the city's three elementary schools still 
ranked among the highest in the county, as well as the junior high school's 
eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
But the district's traditionally rich educational program has begun to suffer, 
parents say. "I moved here from Colorado four years ago," said Mary Ellen 
Portz, mother of two elementary-school children. "The school my son went to had 
a full-time paid librarian, a full-time paid (physical education) teacher, a 
psychologist and a wonderful resource learning lab. South Pasadena has none of 
those things because they had to be cut." 
</P>
<P>
The problem has been, said Joseph, that district budgeting was frozen at a 
comparatively low level when Proposition 13 when into effect 11 years ago. "Our 
base was low and, at the time, we had high level of reserves," Joseph said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Districts Get More 
</P>
<P>
Thus, other districts have gradually surpassed South Pasadena's level of state 
aid. "San Marino gets $120 more per student than we do; Pasadena gets $180 more 
per student," Joseph said. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition A would infuse about $700,000 a year into the system, giving it an 
extra $200 per year per student. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer argues that Proposition 98, which commits 40% of the state budget to 
education, and the unexpected state budget surplus this year, should give the 
South Pasadena schools all they need. "I object to the double taxation of a 
property tax plus a state tax," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer added that the new tax was especially hard on senior citizens, who 
constitute more than a quarter of South Pasadena's 24,400 residents. "Every 
extra tax is a hardship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Jones, the Los Angeles attorney who chaired the citizens committee 
that proposed the tax, contended that prospects for extra state funds are 
"iffy" at best. 
</P>
<P>
He said the recent Los Angeles teachers' strike had reportedly been settled on 
the expectation that the Los Angeles Unified School District would receive an 
additional $45 million in state aid, because of the state surplus. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles has 600,000 students, we have about 3,000," Jones said. "By that 
measure, we'd get about $225,000 more. And it will be a one-shot infusion." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the diverse group endorsing Proposition A has included the City 
Council, local Democratic and Republican clubs, state Supt. of Public 
Instruction Bill Honig, county Supervisor Mike Antonovich, state Sen. Art 
Torres (D-Los Angeles) and county Assessor John Lynch.

'ONE COLORADO' PROJECT MOVES STEP CLOSER TO CONSTRUCTION; 
</P>
<P>
DIRECTORS OK CONCEPT FOR OLD TOWN PROJECT, BUT PRESERVATIONISTS MAY FIGHT IT 
</P>

<P>
The controversial One Colorado project, the last and largest component in the 
redevelopment of Old Pasadena, won unanimous concept approval from the Board of 
Directors on Tuesday despite the protests of preservationists. 
</P>
<P>
The project, previously called the Marketplace, has been delayed for 16 years 
as preservationists, city officials and a string of developers have struggled 
over a variety of proposals to turn a block of historic buildings into an 
upscale shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday, the board threw its support behind a design from San Francisco 
developer Douglas Stitzel that abandons previous proposals to build a mall 
behind the buildings' facades. 
</P>
<P>
Several board members were upset with the amount of demolition needed in 
Stitzel's design, but all of the directors agreed that it was time to move 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Conditions Imposed 
</P>
<P>
"While I am not happy with this project, I'm less happy with no project," said 
Director Rick Cole. 
</P>
<P>
The board imposed several conditions on the project to lessen damage to the 
site, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. The conditions 
include limitations on the grading of alleys and the maximum height of 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Stitzel has proposed a design that even some preservationists say is ingenious. 
</P>
<P>
The design calls for ground-floor entrances to shops on both the first and 
second floors. 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish this, the front entrance of several buildings would lead down a 
few steps to a first floor several feet lower than the street. The entrances to 
other shops in the rear would lead up a few steps to a second floor slightly 
above the street. 
</P>
<P>
The design doubles the amount of valuable space accessible from the street. The 
plan also includes a new three-story building on Union Street that would house 
restaurants, shops and six movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
The board's review of the 336,000-square-foot project was the most critical 
hurdle in the city approval process. 
</P>
<P>
Although the project will undergo a series of more detailed reviews in the 
coming months, concept approval sets the foundation of what will be accepted in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
The Community Development Commission, which reviews projects in a redevelopment 
area, gave its approval last month. 
</P>
<P>
The Design Commission also reviewed the project last month but voted to delay a 
decision until an additional environmental study is completed. Stitzel appealed 
the decision to the Board of Directors, which overruled the commission Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Stitzel, who bought the property in December with several partners, said he was 
pleased with the board's action and relieved that the $75-million project has 
received concept approval. Stitzel estimates construction could be completed by 
early 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists, however, say the real battle over One Colorado has just 
begun. 
</P>
<P>
The preservation group, Pasadena Heritage, is considering legal action to halt 
the project, which it believes would destroy the architectural and historical 
fabric of the area. 
</P>
<P>
Claire Bogaard, executive director of the group, said Stitzel's project 
requires too many changes to the facades and alleys on the block. She said up 
to 80% of some buildings would be demolished. 
</P>
<P>
While some aspects of the new design are an improvement over previous 
proposals, others are worse, such as the extensive relocation of existing 
floors and walls, Bogaard said. 
</P>
<P>
Bogaard said construction of the project could jeopardize the site's status on 
the National Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's get this project done, but let's get it done right," Bogaard said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Proposed in 1983 
</P>
<P>
Construction of a shopping center on the block of 16 buildings located at the 
intersection of Colorado Boulevard and Fair Oaks Avenue was first proposed in 
1983 by developer John Patrick Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson believed that the only way to attract shoppers was to build a modern 
mall behind the facades of the buildings. An open atrium walkway would have 
been bored through the buildings, like the one used in the Plaza Pasadena mall. 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists attacked the proposal at glitzy, phony and historically 
outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's plans crumbled in 1987 because of financial problems and the project 
was sold, first to CMC Capital Corp. and then to Pierce/Lange Development. 
</P>
<P>
Both groups adhered to the mall concept and both ran into similar financial 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Stitzel's group, Pasadena Preservation Associates, bought the project in 
December. The group says it already has the financial backing to complete 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
Stitzel said he believes that his design causes far less damage to the 
buildings than previous proposals.

EX-CONCESSIONAIRES WIN THEIR CASE, BUT ALL MISS THE FAIR

<P>
Triumphant after a three-year court battle against the Los Angeles County Fair 
Assn., concessionaires who were evicted from the fairgrounds received their 
checks last month with bittersweet feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"We're glad it's over, but we miss the fair," said Velda Miller, who until 1986 
leased one of the eight food stands within what was then called the Circle. 
</P>
<P>
That year the fair association asked the stall owners for $60,500 each to 
upgrade what one fair official described as the "antiquated, dilapidated and 
inadequate condition" of the food pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
All but one of the concessionaires refused, and all but one were told that they 
would be replaced with new operators. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of five displaced businesses challenged the fair in court, contending 
that although they rented on a year-to-year basis, they actually had a 
long-term "implied lease" because of their "ongoing contractual relationships" 
with the association. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court jury agreed with that claim in February, concluding that the 
association had committed a breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
The concessionaires were awarded damages of $40,000 per stand, the fair market 
value of the businesses before the renovation, said Stephen Phillips, attorney 
for the 14 plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
The association decided in April not to appeal because of the expense involved, 
said Ralph Hinds, president of the Fairplex. "There's been enough hard 
feelings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hinds said association officials "didn't feel the fair should have 
been penalized at all." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Code Violations 
</P>
<P>
Hinds said the association had to remodel the food pavilion because of health, 
fire and safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs had been cited for a total of 109 health code violations for 
such things as poor ventilation and rat feces in 1985 and 1986, according to 
county records. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of free-standing stalls usually pay for their own renovations when 
necessary, Hinds said. But because the Circle was under one roof, the 
association decided to renovate the entire facility, asking each business owner 
to contribute, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent in excess of $1 million" on the project, he said, noting that other 
concessionaires at the fairgrounds have paid several hundred thousand dollars 
to upgrade their own structures. "Most realize it's better for business if they 
keep current," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Multiyear Leases 
</P>
<P>
In return, the association gives those concessionaires multiyear leases on the 
stands, which are owned by the fair. 
</P>
<P>
But Phillips likened that expectation to a landlord making his tenants pay for 
renovations to a building they do not own. 
</P>
<P>
Although Phillips' clients are happy with their victory, Miller said that 
keeping up the fight was hard. 
</P>
<P>
Legal fees came to $21,000 per stand. Two plaintiffs died last year. Many of 
the rest still miss the 18 days every summer they would set up shop at the 
county fair. 
</P>
<P>
"It was something we looked forward to every year," said Joan Garcia, who 
co-owned "Bit of Italy" for six years before being forced to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"In June, your feet start turning toward the fairgrounds," said Miller, adding 
that she still felt bitter about the litigation. She had been working at the 
fair for 32 years, first as a waitress and finally as owner of Bonnie's BBQ. 
"We had people that would come back to our place every year," she said. "It was 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
She laments the replacement of mom-and-pop stands with what she called 
"fast-food grab-joints." The Circle is now known as the Food Fair. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Change of Atmosphere 
</P>
<P>
"They get business people in there now who just hire the help. The county fair 
doesn't need to be another sophisticated place," said Miller. "We don't need 
another Disneyland. They've even changed the name to Fairplex." 
</P>
<P>
Howard Miller, the former owner of Pete's Hamburger House and another 
plaintiff, looks on the new stands with equal disdain. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see those in the malls," said Miller, who is not related to Velda 
Miller. "We had waitresses and nice china plates to eat on." But Hinds 
maintains the association has worked hard to update facilities while retaining 
the county fair flavor. 
</P>
<P>
"Our responsibility is also to the fair-goer," he said. "When Disneyland came 
into the world, it changed everybody who was in the amusement or entertainment 
industry. It's not acceptable to the fair-goer anymore if we operated the way 
we did years ago."

SENATOR'S AIDE RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilman Chris Lancaster is quitting as an administrative assistant for 
state Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) to open a consulting firm to 
help private businesses deal with local governments. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster, who has worked in the senator's Industry district office since 1986, 
said his resignation will be effective June 15. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster, 30, has not decided on a location or a name for the firm but said he 
might call it Lancaster Consulting. The company will guide developers through 
the permit process for construction projects, Lancaster said. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid conflicts of interest, Lancaster said he will not accept consulting 
contracts related to Covina. Lancaster was elected to the council in April, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good opportunity to get some business experience and to make some 
money," Lancaster said of his job switch. "I still plan to pursue a career in 
public service. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster said that if his father, Assemblyman William Lancaster (R-Covina), 
retires or runs for other public positions, he will run for his father's seat.

PASADENA CHAMBER'S TAX STAND CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps there are good reasons why Pasadena should not tax interstate and 
foreign phone calls, but the Chamber of Commerce failed to mention any in their 
arguments to the Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
Chamber President Don Pollard claimed that businesses pay 60% of all city taxes 
and receive only 40% of the services, and that a new tax would weigh more 
heavily on the business community. He recommended that the city cut expenses 
for citizen committees and commissions rather than impose this new tax. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not in favor of this new tax, but I am disappointed in the chamber's 
attitude and in its apparent disdain for the residents of Pasadena. Because 
about one-third of the taxes the chamber says Pasadena businesses pay are in 
the form of sales taxes, and because most of this is paid by consumers when 
they purchase goods and services, it seems to me that the chamber's opinion 
lacks credence. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber goes on to say that some businesses would be severely impacted by 
the phone tax. However, companies generally pass every cost on to their 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
To me, the most offensive part of the chamber's recommendation is the proposed 
reduction of spending for citizen committees and commissions. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there will always be inefficiency, but as a free people, this is a small 
price to pay for democracy. Our committees and commissions cut across ethnic 
and economic barriers, bring our people together for a common purpose and give 
vitality to our community. One neighbor told me that, if that's the way the 
chamber feels about us, she'll do all her shopping in Glendale, Arcadia and 
Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it is time for the chamber to spend less time whining about the taxes 
that are passed on to consumers and more time insisting on such things as more 
city parks. 
</P>
<P>
It's time for the chamber to stop thinking in terms of "us versus them" and to 
start taking pride in Pasadena, as a whole, and in the residents who play a 
large part in making Pasadena businesses a success.

SCOTT OSTLER: ROOKIE'S HOPE: TO BE MERELY ANOTHER ANGEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Ostler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He is still very much the rookie, despite the 5-3 record, the poise and the 
impressive fastball. 
</P>
<P>
He tries not to act like a rookie, but he knows if you try too hard not to act 
like a rookie, you really act like a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
He is still sorting it all out. 
</P>
<P>
"Some days it seems like I have the best job in the world," Jim Abbott says. 
"Living in California, down by the beach, playing baseball in the major 
leagues. Other days I really feel the insecurity of it." 
</P>
<P>
He is learning. One day he learns that under certain circumstances he can 
outpitch Rocket Man Roger Clemens. Another day he learns what it is like to 
pitch batting practice to the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
"After the Yankee game, it was like: 'Oh, man.' " he says. "I was trying to 
think of a time I was ever out of a game by the third inning, and I couldn't. I 
said to Kirk (McCaskill), 'Did you ever have an outing like that?' " 
</P>
<P>
His teammates like him and understand the naivete. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan Ryan has always been his pitching hero, because of Ryan's presence on the 
mound -- and his heater. Abbott's first day in the big leagues in Angel 
Stadium, a clubhouse boy handed him a telegram. 
</P>
<P>
"Congratulations," it read. "Looking forward to seeing you pitch this year. 
(Signed) Nolan Ryan." 
</P>
<P>
He was stunned. Then he was wary. He looked around the clubhouse to see if he'd 
been had by the team's practical joker. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was Blyleven," he says. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't Bert Blyleven, it was Nolan Ryan. Abbott's teammates passed around 
the telegram, almost reverently. 
</P>
<P>
He barely knows these other Angels, but it crushes him when he lets them down. 
He is learning that the longest four days in life are the four days between 
starts, after you've been shelled. He walks in the clubhouse the next day and 
the loss hovers above his head like a personal cloud. He marvels at the vets 
such as Blyleven, who shake off a loss as easily as they nonchalant a shutout. 
</P>
<P>
He has yet to feel overmatched on the mound, even that night against the 
Yankees, who he later beat, and he's feeling more comfortable each time out. 
Some nights there are stretches when it seems fun out there, and easy. But he 
wonders how long it will be before he finds a real dominating groove, the kind 
he enjoyed in college ball, and in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
He feels welcome. He came to Los Angeles two years ago when his college's 
football team played in the Rose Bowl, and he was put off by the sheer mass of 
people and the general air of aloofness. He considered that he might not fit 
in. Now he's everyone's hero, everyone's pal, and he feels much better about 
his new home. But is that because he and his team are winning? Where, exactly, 
is the reality? 
</P>
<P>
Because he was born with one hand, which has absolutely nothing to do with the 
execution of his pitching duties, he finds himself the object of intense 
fascination and admiration. The media and public are fixated. Abbott 
understands, but looks forward to the wearing off of the novelty, to the 
dealing with Jim Abbott as a "normal" person. 
</P>
<P>
He figures that will happen soon enough. He underestimates the tenacity of the 
press. He does not consider that if he wins 15 games, or 20, the media will be 
parachuting into Angel Stadium and his right arm will be mentioned in the first 
sentence of every newspaper story and TV report. 
</P>
<P>
He has, though, accepted the irony that in the foreseeable future, his right 
arm will remain more famous than his left. 
</P>
<P>
He radiates a friendliness that makes him even more attractive to the media and 
fans. He is Wally Cleaver with 92-m.p.h. juice. The boys and girls of the press 
so love the guy, it is almost embarrassing to him. This further complicates 
life, since he is still trying to become a big league pitcher and there isn't 
enough time to do all the baseball stuff and all the media stuff. 
</P>
<P>
What to do? Turn hard-boiled and aloof? Hide out? He opts for Plan C: Learn to 
politely say no to the press, to pick his spots. 
</P>
<P>
He pulls for his homeboys, the Detroit Pistons, but he admits he has trouble 
with the team's trademark smirking and posturing. He admires their talent, 
wishes they would just play ball. "But I still root for 'em." 
</P>
<P>
He is a tourist. When two high school pals visit from back home in Michigan, 
they all decide to go see Hollywood one afternoon. Drive down Sunset Strip, 
marvel at the people, maybe buy a map of the stars' homes. 
</P>
<P>
"By the way," he says, getting into his car, "how do you get to Hollywood?"

AT WITT'S END, ANGELS BEATEN BY BREWERS, 4-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

MILWAUKEE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
June is supposed to be Mike Witt's month, so at least the calendar is finally 
on his side. April and May wanted nothing to do with Witt, the Angels' 
erstwhile ace, who has spent most of the great California pitching revival of 
1989 with his nose pressed against the glass. 
</P>
<P>
Witt lost again Wednesday, falling to the Milwaukee Brewers, 4-1, before a 
County Stadium crowd of 14,129. He gave up a three-run homer to Greg Brock on 
Brock's first day off the disabled list, walked five and yielded three doubles, 
including two in as many at-bats to Paul Molitor. 
</P>
<P>
Witt's record is 3-5, the only losing mark in the Angel rotation. His 
earned-run average is 4.42, highest on the Angel staff. The Angels are 
streaking -- winning 23 of their last 30 games -- but Witt has been left 
behind, managing a 1-3 record during that span. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't taking it well. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to put it in layman's terms for those laymen around him carrying note 
pads, Witt said, "Suppose you write 10 bad articles and then you write another. 
Obviously, you're not doing your job. But if you write one bad article out of 
10, you can just call it a bad night. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a pitcher and you've had six bad outings and only four good ones, 
that's kind of . . . You're not doing your job." 
</P>
<P>
Witt pitched eight innings Wednesday after getting blown out of his previous 
start with two out in the third. Someone asked if he considered this progress. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for results, I'm not looking for progress," he snapped. "I don't 
get paid to make progress. I get paid to get people out." 
</P>
<P>
Witt, losing pitcher in both Angel defeats during their just-completed 5-2 
swing through New York, Boston and Milwaukee, allowed the Brewers eight hits in 
eight innings. Not great, not awful, but just enough to keep Witt's wheels 
spinning in the mud. 
</P>
<P>
On this day, Witt had to pitch in the mud, as rain fell steadily from the 
game's first pitch until its last. Witt surrendered three hits in the first two 
innings, but didn't get bogged down until the third, when he walked Robin Yount 
and yielded a single to Gary Sheffield before facing Brock. 
</P>
<P>
Brock, sidelined since April 2 with a shoulder injury that required 
arthroscopic surgery, returned to the Brewers' active roster only hours before 
the game. His third-inning at-bat against Witt was only his second of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
When it was finished, Brock's batting average read .500 and Milwaukee led, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Brock hit that new addition to Witt's repertoire, the forkball, 400 feet, 
nearly to straight-away center field. When the ball landed beyond the outfield 
wall, Brewer starter Don August had all the offense he required to improve his 
record to 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave up a three-run home run and that was basically the game," Witt said. 
"Brock hit a pretty good pitch and that was it." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Schroeder, the Angel catcher who called the pitch, corroborated Witt's 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had to do it over again, I'd go with the same pitch," Schroeder said. "It 
wasn't that bad a pitch. It wasn't, by any means, a hanger." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, it effectively hung up Witt again. With Wally Joyner's run-scoring ground 
ball in the fourth inning the extent of the Angel attack, Witt could do nothing 
but keep pitching and ride out the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"As the game progressed, I thought he threw much better," Angel Manager Doug 
Rader said. "The three-run home run got him rolling. It's a shame he had to 
give it up, but I thought he pitched well after that." 
</P>
<P>
Not well enough for Witt. 
</P>
<P>
The best thing he could say about Wednesday is that tomorrow's another day -- 
and that means the beginning of June. Historically, June has been to Witt what 
October was to Reggie Jackson -- his peak period. During this month, Witt has 
won 21 games, lost nine and fashioned a 2.93 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
So, at least he's got that going for him, right? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just looking for a good outing," Witt said. "I don't care what time of 
year it is." 
</P>
<P>
And what is Witt's definition of a good outing? 
</P>
<P>
"You know what I mean," Witt said. "A good outing, to me, is a win, a complete 
game, giving up about two runs." 
</P>
<P>
Preferably, in that order. 
</P>
<P>
There haven't been many of those for Witt in April and May. Remember the days 
when Witt was the pitcher who stopped losing streaks, not winning ones, the 
Angel starter who picked up the rest of the staff time after time? This year, 
the roles have been dramatically reversed, with Kirk McCaskill, Chuck Finley 
&amp; Co. doing the bailing for Witt. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've picked up anyone this year," Witt said. "That's like 10 
years ago. This is this year. And this is the best team I've ever played on." 
</P>
<P>
That, Witt claims, has made the waiting all the tougher. Anyone can hitch a 
ride. Witt would at least like to be a part of the car-pool. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
In truth, Mike Witt allowed the Brewers nine hits, but because of a misjudged 
fly ball by third-base umpire Ken Kaiser, the box score will forever read 
eight. In the seventh inning, Kaiser ruled a line drive to left field by 
Milwaukee's Terry Francona an out when, in fact, the ball one-hopped the turf 
into the glove of Angel left fielder Dante Bichette. With two out and a runner 
on second base, Bichette came up throwing -- only to find Kaiser with his fist 
in the air to signal the third out. "That was a miraculous catch," Brewer 
Manager Tom Trebelhorn deadpanned later. "That catch right there, I'll tell you 
what -- if you want to call one-hoppers to shortstop line-drive outs, that'll 
be fine with us." Bichette admitted he caught the ball on the bounce, but 
added, "It was a tough call for the umpire. It was raining and it was really 
close. Nobody's perfect." Bichette's reaction when he spotted Kaiser's out 
sign? "I just headed for the dugout," he said. "I wasn't going to hang around 
out there and show the umpire up." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels scored in the fourth inning after Johnny Ray's single and a deep fly 
ball by Devon White that kicked off the glove of Milwaukee center fielder Robin 
Yount for an error. Ray wound up on third base on the play and came home on a 
grounder to second base by Wally Joyner. The Angels' only other scoring threat 
came in the seventh inning, when they loaded the bases against Don August and 
relief pitcher Jay Aldrich. But with two out, Brian Downing grounded into a 
force play to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Bichette started in left field in place of Chili Davis, who has been bothered 
by a sore hand. Bichette responded with two singles in four at-bats, snapping 
out of a 1-for-16 spell. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels concluded their Eastern swing with five wins, two losses and two 
rain-outs. The 5-2 mark was the team's best on a trip through the American 
League East since May 18-25, 1982, when the Angels also went 5-2 against 
Milwaukee, Detroit and Boston.

JIM MURRAY: FROM OL' 98 TO '89, THIS WAS NO. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the greatest Indianapolis 500 -- at least that I have seen. 
</P>
<P>
I was there first when Parnelli Jones won in 1963 in a car that was as tough 
and relentless as he was -- Calhoun, or Ol' 98. Parnelli was tossing oil from a 
crack in the oil tank in the late stages of the race, and only a vigorous, 
arm-waving, fervent plea by car owner J. C. Agajanian prevented the steward 
from black-flagging old Calhoun (and old Parnelli) off the track. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Eddie Sachs, who had spun, blamed Parnelli's oil, and Parnelli socked 
him in the mouth at the victory banquet. 
</P>
<P>
Parnelli shouldn't have done that. Poor Eddie, who loved the Indianapolis 500 
the way some men love God, was to die in a pyre on the front straightaway the 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
I saw the Great Scot, Jimmy Clark, solidify the rear-engine revolution at the 
Speedway in 1965. Indianapolis loved the big, noisy, bombastic roadsters -- in 
particular the 750-horsepower Novis that made just less noise than the Battle 
of Verdun on their way around the race track but never won anything. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't know what to make of the graceful, little, cigar-shaped British 
Lotuses with the Ford engine in the back but they caught on quickly at Indy 
when Clark gave them a lesson in rear-engine driving. The car just buzzed 
around like a flight of wasps but it went through the corners like a runaway 
snake and won easily, dooming the roadster at Indy. 
</P>
<P>
There was 1966, the year the Formula One drivers, Clark and Graham Hill, both 
showed up in the winner's circle, claiming victory, and a recheck gave the win 
to Hill. 
</P>
<P>
That was the year 11 -- count 'em -- cars went out without running a lap. They 
crashed at the start, the race was held up for 1 hour 18 minutes and Dan Gurney 
observed disgustedly, "You'd think 33 of the world's best drivers could at 
least back out of the garage safely." 
</P>
<P>
There was the year Parnelli Jones drove the turbine, a car as silent as a 
rocket and it outclassed the field the way a jet plane might a covered wagon -- 
until a $1.98 bearing burned out and stopped it while well in the lead on Lap 
197. 
</P>
<P>
What I remember most of that year was sitting on the pit wall with the turbine 
car owner, Andy Granatelli, after the race was halted on Lap 19 by rain. I 
watched as the rain pelted down on the car imperfectly covered by a sheet of 
clear plastic with a big tear in it, water oozing into the vital parts. 
</P>
<P>
"Why don't you move it in the garage?" I asked Granatelli. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't," he said. "It's not in the rules." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to sit here and let it get wet and rusty?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Andy said. 
</P>
<P>
The rule has since been changed, but I know the car Parnelli got into the next 
day must have been as wet as a kayak. 
</P>
<P>
There was the year Mario (no last name needed) won his only Indy. He's probably 
the greatest driver never to have won two. 
</P>
<P>
There were other years. There was 1971, the year the automobile dealer piloting 
the pace car crashed into a photographers' stand. 
</P>
<P>
That was also the year Mark Donohue's car flamed out on Lap 67 and they left it 
parked on the track apron, where Mike Mosley hit it on Lap 167 and took himself 
and Bobby Unser, who spun into the wall to miss Mosley, out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Krisiloff's car, which had blown its engine on Lap 12, was still parked 
there, too, in the right place for the crash to collect it, so for want of a 
tow truck, four $150,000 cars were wrecked. 
</P>
<P>
There was the year only 3/1000th of a mile an hour separated Gordon Johncock 
and Rick Mears. 
</P>
<P>
But for sheer melodrama, nothing can top the 1989 renewal. 
</P>
<P>
It was supposed to be another Rick Mears-Roger Penske festival, a race won on 
the drawing boards, but it was obvious to veteran Gasoline Alley addicts at the 
flag drop that the dashing Brazilian, Emerson Fittipaldi, was sitting in the 
fastest car. He not only jumped Mears at the first turn, he opened up a 
half-a-track lead on him. 
</P>
<P>
But first one, then the other of the second-generation drivers came at him. 
Michael Andretti, who drives a race car as if he were leaving a forest fire, 
overtook Fittipaldi for a while about three-quarters of the way through the 
race, till he overtaxed his engine and came in smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Then the racing between Fittipaldi and Al Unser Jr. on the last 10 laps was 
right out of a dime novel, and took the sport back to its leather helmet and 
goggles days. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes are so high at Indy -- it turned out the winner got $1,100,000, no 
less, and the lasting fame only winning at Indy brings -- that the players in 
this high-stakes game are willing to ante their lives. 
</P>
<P>
When the cars piloted by Fittipaldi and Unser touched tires, you knew they were 
both hoping not to throw snake eyes. But they rolled the dice. Unser lost but 
became a folk hero. That's what Unsers do -- win or crash. 
</P>
<P>
A crash on Lap 199 between the two leaders is not something you're apt to see 
outside the pages of pulp fiction. It makes for great theater and puts the 1989 
Indy 500 alongside the Babe Ruth called-shot World Series, the Dempsey-Tunney 
fight or the 1960 Arnold Palmer Open. 
</P>
<P>
A vintage event. A great year. A collector's item.

DODGERS FIND A KNOCKOUT PUNCH; 
</P>
<P>
7-RUN SEVENTH FINISHES OFF MONTREAL, 9-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It wasn't just the Dodger offense that erupted Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
So did Mike Scioscia. 
</P>
<P>
Grazed on the helmet by a pitch from Montreal's Pascual Perez during a 
seven-run uprising by the Dodgers in the seventh inning, Scioscia charged the 
mound, touching off a bench-clearing scrum on the dirt near first base. 
</P>
<P>
The near-brawl was the highlight of the Dodgers' 9-4 victory at Dodger Stadium 
and was the topic of much conversation afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Did Perez throw at Scioscia? 
</P>
<P>
"What do you think?" the Dodger catcher asked the reporter. "No doubt about it. 
It was intentionally (thrown) at my head." 
</P>
<P>
Perez declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't got nothing to say," the Expo reliever said. 
</P>
<P>
The seeds of this feud undoubtedly were planted in the first inning, when 
Dodger starter Orel Hershiser plunked Hubie Brooks with a pitch, bouncing it 
off the left arm of the Expo right fielder after nearly hitting him with the 
previous pitch. 
</P>
<P>
An agitated Brooks took several steps toward the mound before plate umpire Bill 
Hohn locked him in a bear-hug. 
</P>
<P>
Both benches emptied, with Brooks inquiring as to why Hershiser threw at him. 
Hershiser, incredulous, insisted that he hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
He had logic on his side, too. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos already had scored twice, the second run crossing the plate on 
Hershiser's wild pitch that almost hit Brooks, and had a runner at third base 
with one out. 
</P>
<P>
"He had no reason at all to hit Hubie in that situation," Scioscia said of 
Hershiser. "No pitcher in the world wants to try to knock a batter down in that 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser, Scioscia said, did not have control of his pitches. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had terrible mechanics," Hershiser said. 
</P>
<P>
But, after Tim Wallach lifted a scoring fly ball to right field to put the 
Dodgers in a 3-0 hole, Hershiser's mechanics improved dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
He made a major adjustment, he said, but didn't want to discuss it with 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"If I did," he said, "you'd ask me about it every time I had a bad outing the 
rest of the season." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser faced only one batter over the minimum in shutting down the Expos 
through the seventh, allowing no hits, striking out four and walking one. 
Still, the Dodgers trailed, 3-1, when Hershiser was lifted in favor of a 
pinch-hitter in the bottom of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser then watched his light-hitting teammates stage an improbable rally 
that improved his record to 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
After Alfredo Griffin drew a walk against starter Bryn Smith, Mickey Hatcher 
lined a double into the right-field corner off reliever Joe Hesketh, cutting 
the Dodger deficit to 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Hesketh then fielded a sacrifice bunt by Chris Gwynn, but threw too late to get 
the diving Hatcher at third base. 
</P>
<P>
On came the demonstrative Perez, who gave up a two-run double to Willie 
Randolph, who had three hits, one fewer than Kirk Gibson, who followed with a 
line-drive triple into the right-field corner. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, who exchanged unpleasantries with Perez Monday night, accentuated his 
game-winning hit with a leaping double pump. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I'd been swinging the bat well for the last week," said Gibson, 
who returned to the lineup May 23 after almost a month on the disabled list, 
"but the results don't always show." 
</P>
<P>
Gibson wasn't finished with Perez, who gave up a run-scoring fly ball to Eddie 
Murray before retiring Mike Davis for the second out. 
</P>
<P>
When Perez then hit Scioscia, he ran out of harm's way as teammate Tim Wallach 
made a running tackle to cut down the charging Dodger catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, sprinting from the dugout, made an end-run in an attempt to jump Perez, 
but the Expos' Kevin Gross, a 6-foot-5, 215-pound pitcher, saw Gibson coming 
and, with the aid of two or three teammates, wrestled Gibson to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
What went through Gibson's mind as he charged? 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to think of a way to get to him," he said of Perez, who, along 
with Scioscia and Expo Manager Buck Rodgers, was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda had no doubt that Perez had thrown at Scioscia. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd bet my lungs on it," the Dodger manager said. 
</P>
<P>
In the mess that followed, Brooks wound up standing next to Hershiser, who 
unwittingly started it all. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser explained that he hadn't intentionally hit him. 
</P>
<P>
And how did Brooks react? 
</P>
<P>
"We shook hands," Hershiser said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, when order was restored, Jeff Hamilton, who also homered Monday night, 
greeted reliever Andy McGaffigan with a two-run homer into the box seats in 
left field, scoring Rick Dempsey, who ran for Scioscia. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger lead was 8-3. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe that's what we needed to get us sparked off," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dodger reliever Ray Searage, suffering with a sprained back, was put on the 
15-day disabled list. Searage, who gave up the game-winning sacrifice fly to 
pinch-hitter Mike Aldrete in Tuesday night's 5-4 loss to the Expos, was forced 
to leave the game after he experienced back spasms as he backed up Kirk 
Gibson's throw to the plate. . . . Searage was replaced on the roster by John 
Wetteland, 23, a right-handed pitcher who was recalled from the Dodgers' 
triple-A affiliate at Albuquerque, N.M. Wetteland pitched a scoreless ninth in 
his major-league debut. . . . Mike Marshall, again suffering from lower back 
stiffness, was not in the starting lineup. "Only Mike knows how he feels but 
the trainers say it's day to day and not long term," said Fred Claire, the 
Dodgers' executive vice president. Marshall, who had a cortisone injection 
Wednesday to reduce the inflammation in his back, has not hit a home run since 
April 16 and had only three RBIs in May.

YANKEES DECIDE TIME IS PRIME FOR SANDERS; 
</P>
<P>
MOVE FROM DOUBLE-A MIGHT THROW WRENCH INTO FALCONS' NEGOTIATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Yankees were ready for a prime-time player Wednesday when they 
called up rookie Deion Sanders from double-A Albany (N.Y.) to start in center 
field against the Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
But is Prime Time Sanders, as he is known, ready for the major leagues? 
</P>
<P>
After fewer than 100 games in minor league competition, Sanders finds himself 
under the microscope in Yankee Stadium, where New York has been struggling 
under new Manager Dallas Green. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the former All-American cornerback from Florida State skipped the 1988 
college baseball season to concentrate on football. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders was chosen fifth in last month's National Football League draft by the 
Atlanta Falcons, and has said he wants to become the NFL's greatest cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I had my mind all made up," Sanders said during a news conference 
before Wednesday's game. "I was prepared to leave July 3 for (football) 
training camp. That was until I got that call last night. Now, I'll have to 
look the situation over. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they didn't bring me up to sit on the bench. I don't want a look, I 
want to stay." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders went one for four Wednesday, starting a five-run, seventh-inning rally 
with an infield single. He also drove in a runner with a ground-out and threw 
out a runner at third base in the Yankees' 9-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The promotion gives Sanders' agent, Steve Zucker, greater bargaining power in 
negotiations with the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question about this being a leverage," Zucker said from Northbrook, 
Ill. "I'm pleasantly surprised they brought him up this quick." 
</P>
<P>
The flamboyant Sanders said after the NFL draft that he would seek a 
$10-million, six-year contract that would make him the league's highest-paid 
defensive player ever. 
</P>
<P>
Rankin M. Smith, the Falcons' chairman of the board, told the Atlanta 
Constitution Journal Wednesday: "I'm not surprised in a way. (The Yankees) 
talked about doing it. It's not something we shied away from. We just have to 
face it. But all along he has said football is his first love and we took him 
at his word." 
</P>
<P>
Said Zucker: "Deion has always said football is his wife, baseball is his 
girlfriend. Well, his girlfriend just became Miss America. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing to speak from Albany, N.Y., and another to be speaking from 
Yankee Stadium. Things could change drastically." 
</P>
<P>
Syd Thrift, the Yankees' vice president, said the move was not tied to the 
Falcons' negotiations, which are expected to resume in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"That's got nothing to do with it," Thrift said. "We're in the business of 
trying to win in the big leagues and we thought this would be a fine 
opportunity for (Sanders) to perform here and in the Big Apple. We want to see 
what he can do." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders' potential in baseball remains questionable. Most scouts consider him a 
better football prospect. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, who bats left-hander, hit .286 with 17 stolen bases and had a .380 
on-base percentage for Albany-Colonie of the Eastern League. 
</P>
<P>
"But he couldn't hit left-handed pitching in the Eastern League," said Pete 
Dougherty, a baseball reporter for the Albany Times-Union. "Especially 
off-speed pitches. Personally, I am not convinced he can hit at that level." 
</P>
<P>
Florida State Coach Mike Martin said that Sanders needs to polish his offensive 
skills before he can be considered a major league prospect. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think he can challenge the single-season stolen base record within two 
years if he is an every-day player," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
"With Deion Sanders and Rickey Henderson on the same field, they can create a 
tremendous amount of excitement in New York. Henderson is the fastest guy in 
the majors, but wait until he sees Sanders." 
</P>
<P>
Martin said that Sanders needs to strengthen his throwing arm, although the 
outfielder threw out a runner at third base in the first inning of Wednesday 
night's game. Martin also said that Sanders needs to develop more power at the 
plate and has difficulty hitting breaking balls thrown by left-handers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if Deion can play both sports," Martin said. "I think he'll 
choose one or the other. This (promotion) isn't a publicity stunt." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders might try to duplicate the athletic feats of Bo Jackson, who was the 
No. 1 pick in the 1986 NFL draft by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson however, chose baseball and returned to the draft in 1987, when he was 
taken in the seventh round by the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who is tied for the American League lead with 12 home runs and is 
fourth in RBIs and stolen bases, splits his time between the Raiders and 
baseball's Kansas City Royals. He joins the Raiders when baseball ends one 
month into the NFL season. Last season, he gained 580 yards in 136 carries for 
the Raiders, although he was bothered by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Deion may be a reversal of what Bo does," Zucker said. "He realizes he 
must play football full time to be the greatest cornerback ever." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, a 30th-round choice of the Yankees last spring, spent last summer 
playing at Sarasota of the Florida rookie league and Class A Fort Lauderdale, 
and played five games at triple-A Columbus before returning to Florida State 
for his senior year. He helped lead the Seminoles to a victory in the Sugar 
Bowl last January against Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders batted .280 and stole 11 bases in 17 games at Sarasota, hit .429 in six 
games at Fort Lauderdale and .150 in six games at Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
"When they tell me to send them up, I send them up," Manager Buck Showalter of 
Albany-Colonie said. "I'm always surprised when someone jumps from double-A 
classification to the big leagues, but I am confident Deion is ready. The 
Yankees need help." 
</P>
<P>
And Deion Sanders, center fielder, has arrived to provide it.

CONNORS BIDS EARLY ADIEU TO FRENCH OPEN; 
</P>
<P>
MARATHON MATCH AGAINST JAY BERGER ENDS IN DEFEAT, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5, 7-5

<P>
With a wave of his hand, Jimmy Connors walked off Stadium Court to a round of 
cheers late Wednesday afternoon, after 4 hours 26 minutes of tennis had left 
him defeated but also strangely exhilarated. 
</P>
<P>
Disappointed, too? Well, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to reach the five-hour mark," Connors said. "I wanted to see if I 
would still be standing." 
</P>
<P>
Connors, 36, was a second-round casualty at the French Open, where he lost to 
Jay Berger, 14 years his junior, who now adds his name to the growing list of 
younger players who have defeated Connors in the early rounds of recent 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
At Monte Carlo, it was Paolo Cane, 24. At Munich, it was Martin Jaite, 24. At 
Rome, it was Sergi Bruguera, 18. This time, it was Berger, a 22-year-old 
Floridian who won a 4-6, 6-3, 7-5, 7-5 endurance test against one of the 
sports's most enduring figures. 
</P>
<P>
So when the legions of French fans sided with Connors during the match and then 
gave him a standing ovation as he left the court, Berger understood. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, if I was in the stands, I would have cheered Jimmy Connors, too," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On a clay court the color of smoked salmon, Connors' quest to win the only 
Grand Slam tournament he has missed in his storied career ended when he sent a 
forehand approach shot wide and long on match point. 
</P>
<P>
But Connors was not devastated, only defeated. 
</P>
<P>
"For me to go out and grind out a match like that, it's fun," he said. "To play 
a kid like that, 14 years younger . . . I could have played a fifth set. My 
mouthpiece wasn't knocked out." 
</P>
<P>
Each match is a fight for Connors, a duel with rackets, his style and approach 
belying an age that is ancient, by tennis standards. His match against Berger 
was longer than any final in French Open history, but this was the second 
round, not the final, although Connors played as though it was. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ninth-seeded Connors fell out, the other top-seeded players stayed 
in with impressive victories. 
</P>
<P>
Boris Becker, seeded second, defeated Eric Winogradsky of France, 7-6 (7-4), 
7-5, 6-3, and third-seeded Stefan Edberg stayed on track for a possible 
quarterfinal match against Jakob Hlasek or Alberto Mancini by defeating 
Nicholas Pereira of Venezuela, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Hlasek, sixth seeded, defeated Andres Gomez of Ecuador, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2. Mancini 
eliminated his Argentine countryman, Jaite, 7-6 (7-1), 6-4, 6-3. Hlasek and 
Mancini, 11th seeded, will meet in the round of 16 if each wins his next match. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles, it was business as usual for Steffi Graf of West 
Germany and Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina, who scored impressive victories and 
moved easily into the third round. 
</P>
<P>
Graf overpowered Bettina Fulco of Argentina, 6-0, 6-1, and Sabatini followed 
suit with a routine 6-3, 6-1 victory over Alexia Dechaume of France. 
</P>
<P>
Helena Sukova of Czechoslovakia was not as fortunate. Sukova, fifth-seeded here 
and a finalist in the Australian Open, was upset in the second round by Akiko 
Kijimuta of Japan, 6-1, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Graf's victory was particularly devastating. The world's No. 1 player needed 
only 47 minutes to eliminate Fulco, ranked 27th. Graf, who said she sometimes 
apologizes to her opponents after thrashing them, found no need to tell Fulco 
she was sorry. 
</P>
<P>
"I was playing so well, there was nothing I can do," Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
How well was she playing? 
</P>
<P>
"Very, very well," Graf said. "I had such a good feeling." 
</P>
<P>
In defeat, Connors felt pretty good himself. 
</P>
<P>
Connors, who has eight Grand Slam titles among his 107 tournament victories, 
said he played the clay-court season in Europe to get in shape and have fun. He 
said he had accomplished both. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a ball," Connors said. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the early-round defeats stack up, Connors said he has no apologies -- 
"So what?" -- and he wouldn't be worried if his clay-court experience does not 
pay dividends in the hard-court season. 
</P>
<P>
The match may have swung on a couple of poorly played games, Connors said. With 
Berger serving at 2-4 in the fourth set, Connors held two break points and 
didn't capitalize. In the third set, Connors was serving at 6-5 and 40-15 and 
was broken. 
</P>
<P>
Berger's victory was not without his own moments of drama. He broke strings on 
his racket three times and still won points on two of those occasions. 
</P>
<P>
He also won a point when his racket slipped out of his hands on a smash, but he 
hit the ball anyway and it bounced twice before the racket hit the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know if I would have been able to play a fifth set," he said. 
"If it had gone five, I think they would have had to carry us both off the 
court." 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Arias reached the third round with a 7-6 (7-1), 7-5, 6-1 victory over 
Anders Jarryd of Sweden, but Aaron Krickstein of the U.S. held a two-set lead 
over Mark Woodforde of Australia, then lost. Woodforde came back to win, 1-6, 
6-7 (7-5), 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. It was the first time in Krickstein's career that he 
had held a two-set lead and lost. . . . Goran Ivanisevic of Yugoslavia is the 
youngest player remaining in the field at 17. He is a couple of months younger 
than Michael Chang of Placentia and Pete Sampras of Rancho Palos Verdes. 
Sampras and Chang will meet in a third-round match today. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Ivan Lendl plays Derrick Rostagno of Brentwood, Andre Agassi faces 
Paolo Cane of Italy and defending champion Mats Wilander meets Diego Perez of 
Uruguay in the second round today.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS: TETTLETON FUELS ORIOLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last season, after the Baltimore Orioles set the record for consecutive defeats 
to open a season -- 21 -- they continued a desperate search for help. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly thereafter, the Orioles brought up a catcher, Mickey Tettleton, from 
their Rochester farm club. 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton had some bright moments later in the season, but there was no preview 
of what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the 28-year-old switch-hitter is the toast of Baltimore. While other 
hitters are moaning about deadened baseballs, Tettleton sees "rabbit" wherever 
he goes. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night at Baltimore, Tettleton hit a three-run home run in the sixth 
inning to carry the Orioles to an 8-5 victory over the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
The home run, Tettleton's 13th of the season, was his eighth in the last 16 
games. Tettleton, who has driven in 16 runs in the last 19 games, is tied for 
the league lead in home runs with Lou Whitaker of the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
In parts of five previous seasons, Tettleton averaged a home run every 33 
at-bats. This season he is averaging one every 12 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton's explanation is that it's either the Fruit Loops cereal he eats for 
breakfast or the weightlifting he does during the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know why this is happening," Tettleton said. "It could be the 
weightlifting. That's something I've never done during the season. Maybe the 
wind's blowing out. I'm just enjoying it while I can." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Sylvia, revealed the choice of breakfast food. It seems he started 
eating it before day games. A banner attesting to Tettleton's cereal preference 
has been hanging at Memorial Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Frank Robinson of the Orioles said he had hoped that playing regularly, 
Tettleton might hit as many as 16 homers this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Mickey doesn't have a history of hitting home runs," Robinson said. "But he's 
playing on a regular basis for the first time. Also, he has become much better 
as a hitter batting left-handed." 
</P>
<P>
Last year Tettleton hit nine of his 11 home runs batting right-handed. 
Wednesday night's home run off Cecilio Guante gave him nine of his 13 as a 
left-handed hitter. 
</P>
<P>
It may have been a costly victory for the Orioles, however. Pitcher Jeff 
Ballard, going for his ninth victory, was hit in the collarbone by a line drive 
off the bat of Pete Incaviglia in the fifth inning. Ballard finished the 
inning, leading, 4-0, then left, and the Rangers forged ahead, costing him a 
shot at the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 4, Oakland 3 -- Do the Athletics miss bullpen ace Dennis Eckersley? 
Well, Dave Parker hit his eighth home run of the season in the top of the 10th 
inning to give the Athletics a 3-2 lead at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
So, with Eckersley sidelined because of a shoulder problem, the A's brought in 
Eric Plunk. He retired slumping Mike Greenwell, but Dwight Evans singled, Ellis 
Burks doubled and the tying run came in on an infield out. Rick Cerone singled 
in the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwell ended an 0-for-16 slump with a single in the seventh, stole second 
and scored the go-ahead run on a hit by Nick Esasky. 
</P>
<P>
A throwing error by shortstop Jody Reed enabled the Athletics to get even in 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
New York 9, Seattle 5 -- Deion Sanders, another former football All-American 
trying to make it in major league baseball, had an auspicious debut at New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Bo Jackson, a running back, Sanders is a defensive back from Florida 
State who was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
He arrived from Albany, N.Y., earlier in the day, threw out a runner from 
center field and singled to ignite a five-run seventh inning that brought the 
Yankees from behind. He was 1 for 4 and had a run-scoring ground-out. 
</P>
<P>
Don Mattingly went 4 for 5, including a two-run home run, as the Yankees 
rallied from a 5-2 deficit. A three-run home run by Jeffrey Leonard in the top 
of the seventh broke a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Henderson and Mattingly followed Sanders' hit with singles in the 
seventh. Mike Pagliarulo greeted reliever Jerry Reed with a bad-hop double, and 
Alvaro Espinosa later squeezed in a run. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 7, Toronto 4 -- As interim manager, Cito Gaston had the Blue Jays 
showing improvement; then before this game at Cleveland, it was announced that 
he would manage for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays responded by wasting a 4-2 lead, and their record under Gaston 
fell to 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
Pete O'Brien paced the Indians, going 3 for 3 and driving in three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, Bud Black was a top reliever. The Indians used him in a 
rescue role for the first time this season and he responded by holding Toronto 
to two hits and no runs in 4 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Carter, who had a leadoff double to start the Indians' go-ahead rally in 
the sixth, homered in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 4, Chicago 3 -- Lou Whitaker hit a two-run home run in the eighth 
inning at Chicago to put the Tigers ahead, and they survived rain in the ninth 
to hand the White Sox the 11th loss in their last 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
Whitaker's second homer in two games gave him 13 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 7, Kansas City 1 -- Dan Gladden hit a grand slam off reliever Tom 
Gordon (5-3) in the sixth inning at Kansas City, and shortly thereafter the 
rains came. 
</P>
<P>
After waiting 78 minutes, the umpires called the game. DAN HAFNER

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
WITH PITCHERS HURTING, CARDINALS' DEFENSE FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the St. Louis Cardinals lost two starting pitchers, Danny Cox and Greg 
Mathews, for the season because of injuries during spring training, the Eastern 
Division was all but conceded to the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Mets' lack of hitting and general attitude have made for a 
wide-open race with everyone wanting to be counted in, including the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Even Manager Whitey Herzog, who has directed the Cardinals to three pennants in 
the 1980s, took hope. With the Mets faltering, he began to piece together a 
pitching staff. The Cardinals joined the Chicago Cubs and the Montreal Expos as 
challengers to the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
"When everyone is healthy," Herzog said, "we have the best eight-man lineup in 
the majors." 
</P>
<P>
Although he didn't stress it, he was in large measure giving credit to his 
regulars for outstanding defensive ability. But as the Cardinals threaten to 
fade out of the race, the defense has been the killer. 
</P>
<P>
Costly errors by rookie third baseman Tim Jones and first baseman Pedro 
Guerrero set the stage for catcher Craig Biggio to deliver a run-scoring double 
in the ninth inning that enabled the Houston Astros to beat the Cardinals, 4-3, 
Wednesday at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Astros' sixth consecutive victory and 10th straight on the road. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals have lost four in a row and were tied in a fifth game that was 
rained out with the score tied. In all but one of those games, an error cost 
the Cardinals the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero, a defensive liability with the Dodgers at several positions, made 
critical errors in two of them, but Ozzie Smith, long recognized as the king of 
shortstops, has made errors that permitted the winning run to score in three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals, once challenging for the lead, have lost 12 of their last 16 
games. St. Louis also is without the services of its best relief pitcher, Todd 
Worrell, who suffered a groin injury in mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
"Injuries can't be helped," Herzog said, "but what bothers me is that I have 
never had a club play worse than this." 
</P>
<P>
There was more bad news for Herzog. Worrell, eligible to come off the disabled 
list, threw on the sidelines Tuesday and said he wouldn't be ready to return 
for a couple of more days. 
</P>
<P>
With the division-leading Cubs losing, the Cardinals (23-25) are only four 
games behind. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the only problem for the soaring Astros is they have to return home. 
They play the Dodgers tonight at the Astrodome, where their record is 10-17. 
The winning streak has given them a 17-7 record on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Biggio's double in the ninth inning was his second run-scoring double. Ken 
Caminiti singled off Cris Carpenter (1-4) with one out in the ninth, took 
second on Craig Reynolds' ground-out and easily scored on Biggio's shot to 
left-center field. 
</P>
<P>
Although Biggio appears to have the catching job won, his throwing leaves 
something to be desired. He has thrown out only one runner in 40 steal 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
At the plate, he has a six-game hitting streak, going 11 for 24. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 3, Chicago 2 -- When the Braves made two baserunning blunders in the 
sixth inning at Atlanta, it appeared that they weren't going to break a 2-2 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
But when shortstop Shawon Dunston fielded Ron Gant's grounder and threw into 
the dirt at first base, Dale Murphy scored what proved to be the winning run 
from second. 
</P>
<P>
John Smoltz, with ninth-inning help, improved to 7-3, giving up only five hits, 
walking none and striking out four. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Blauser's second double of the game opened the Braves' sixth. But Blauser, 
thinking Gerald Perry's single might be caught, hesitated and was caught in a 
rundown between third base and home. Perry reached second, but when Murphy 
grounded to shortstop, Perry fell asleep and was out trying to go to third. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 4, Pittsburgh 3 -- After the Reds lost four in a row, Manager Pete 
Rose decided to shake up his lineup for this game at Pittsburgh. The move 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
Utility players Luis Quinones and Joel Youmgblood each hit his first home run 
of the season, allowing Jose Rijo (5-1) to win for the 10th time in his last 11 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
Rijo gave up seven hits in 7 1/3 innings. One of the Reds' bullpen stars, Rob 
Dibble, wasn't available because he was completing a suspension for a 
bat-throwing incident. John Franco earned his 15th save by getting the last 
five outs. 
</P>
<P>
It was Quinones' second major league home run, coming in his 304th at-bat, 
while Youngblood's was his first since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 2, Philadelphia 1 -- Marvell Wynne hit a two-out double in the eighth 
inning at San Diego to drive in the winning run from first base. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rasmussen gave up a first-inning home run to Dickie Thon for the 
Phillies' only run. Rasmussen has given up 18 runs in the first innings of his 
11 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Davis held off the Phillies in the ninth with the potential tying run on 
third base and one out. 
</P>
<P>
New York 3, San Francisco 1 -- The Mets scored two unearned runs in the 10th 
inning at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Lyons led off the 10th with a single to center. Kevin Elster then hit an 
apparent double-play ball to second baseman Ed Jurak, but Jurak's throw sailed 
wide of second, and both runners were safe. 
</P>
<P>
Pinch-hitter Mark Carreon popped out, but then Elster went to second and 
pinch-runner Keith Miller moved to third on Craig Lefferts' wild pitch. With 
the Giants' infield playing in, Mookie Wilson hit a bouncer that went through 
charging shortstop Chris Speier, and both runners scored. DAN HAFNER

The University of Kentucky's basketball program, placed on three years' 
probation by the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. two weeks ago, was dealt 
another blow when the presidents of the Southeastern Conference stripped the 
Wildcats of the 1988 SEC championship. 
</P>
<P>
The presidents voted, 8-0, to vacate both the 1987-88 regular-season and 1988 
SEC tournament titles won by Kentucky because "institutional staff members did 
or should have known about the ineligibility" of former star Eric Manuel. 
</P>
<P>
University President Dr. David Roselle abstained from voting, and Florida, 
which had its 1984 football title taken away because it ran afoul of NCAA 
rules, was not represented during the portion of the annual SEC spring meeting 
devoted to discussing the Kentucky case. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA placed Kentucky's basketball program on probation May 19, barring the 
Wildcats from postseason play for two years and live television for one season, 
and declared Manuel ineligible at any NCAA school.

The candidates were lined up in New York to replace Rick Pitino as coach of the 
New York Knicks, but General Manager Al Bianchi has his sights set on an old 
friend, John MacLeod of the Dallas Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
Bianchi contacted the Mavericks for permission to speak with MacLeod about the 
Knicks' job, which Pitino left to become coach at the University of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Sund, Dallas' vice president of basketball operations, told Bianchi that 
he wanted to confer with the rest of the team's management before giving 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
Bianchi was an assistant with the Phoenix Suns, where MacLeod was coach for 14 
years before departing after the 1986-87 season.

MUIR COACH SAYS GIRLS CAN WIN STATE TRACK TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Brownfield, Muir High girls track coach, is not discounting his team's 
chances entering the CIF State Track and Field Championships that start Friday 
at Cerritos College in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
But Brownfield realizes that Muir will need to get the most out of its five 
qualifiers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a chance for the state title, but we have to take two firsts, two 
seconds and an umpth," he said. "The umpth is Taminika Terry." 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs are among the favorites along with defending champion Bakersfield 
of the Central Section, Locke of the L.A. City Section and Rio Mesa of the 
Southern Section, although Brownfield sees the race for the title as wide-open. 
</P>
<P>
"There are going to be nine teams under the head of a dime for the state 
championship," he said. "But it's going to come down to the mile relay. We 
can't dodge the bullet. We've got to win the mile relay." 
</P>
<P>
If that's the case, Muir has a good chance. The Mustangs have been one of the 
top schools in the state in the 1,600 relay this season and finished a close 
second to Rio Mesa (3:48.93 to 3:48.66) at the CIF Masters Meet last week. 
</P>
<P>
Muir will also be one of the favorites in the 400-meter relay with a swift time 
of 46.46 seconds at the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
Both relay teams are anchored by junior Inger Miller. She is also among the 
favorites in both the 100 and 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Miller finished second to Angela Burnham of Rio Mesa in the 100 and 200 in 
times of 11.53 and 23.84 last week. Miller had stayed close to the Rio Mesa 
senior in their previous encounters this season. 
</P>
<P>
Brownfield is hoping that Terry can come through with another point or two for 
the Mustangs in the 200 meters where she finished third in 24.84 seconds at the 
Masters. 
</P>
<P>
"We got all the people in who we thought we needed," he said. "We're not the 
favorite. But we're in the hunt." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Muir, other San Gabriel Valley athletes will be contending mostly 
for individual honors at the meet. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the favorites are Juliana Yendork of Walnut in the long and triple jumps 
and Karen Hecox of South Hills in the 1,600 and 3,200. 
</P>
<P>
Yendork, a sophomore, is the clear-cut favorite in her specialties. She posted 
strong qualifying marks of 19-9 in the long jump and 41-4 in the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
Hecox, a junior, posted the top qualifying time of 10:41:23 in the 3,200 last 
week and is defending state champion. She also qualified for the 1,600 in the 
second-best time of 5:01.45 
</P>
<P>
Among the boys, the valley has a strong title hope in senior high jumper Mark 
Wilson of Charter Oak. In the Masters Wilson posted a winning leap of 7-0 -- 
four inches better than his closest competitor. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal Poly Pomona women's softball team, which finished fifth in the NCAA 
Division I World Series, has placed three players on the Division I All-West 
Region team. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Denise Correa and third baseman Heather DeLuca were selected to the 
first team and outfielder Nikki Busch to the second team. Pomona's Carol Spanks 
was named Coach of the Year in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Correa, a senior, earned all-region first-team selection for the second 
consecutive season. She led the Broncos with a .279 batting average, 27 runs, 
seven doubles and one home run. 
</P>
<P>
DeLuca, a junior, shared the team lead in triples with Correa at six and tied 
for the lead in stolen bases with Busch at nine. Busch led the team in runs 
batted in with 25. 
</P>
<P>
Spanks' selection as top coach capped a surprising season for the Broncos. 
Expected to finish no higher than fourth in the Big West Conference, Pomona 
wound up third and reached the Division I playoffs for the eighth straight 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The 11th-ranked Broncos, who swept two straight games from fourth-ranked Cal 
State Fullerton to advance to the World Series, finished the season with a 
43-23 record. Spanks' 11-year record is 474-192-8. 
</P>
<P>
The site of the National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame All-Star Football 
Game on July 21 has been switched from Arroyo High School in El Monte to Citrus 
College in Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
The game, which matches top graduated seniors from throughout the San Gabriel 
Valley, was played at Arroyo in 1981-88. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Von Plater, president of the Pasadena-San Gabriel Valley Chapter of the 
National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame, said the move was made because 
there has been a greater demand for seating and Citrus is in a more centralized 
location than Arroyo. 
</P>
<P>
Citrus College's stadium has a seating capacity of 10,000 while Arroyo's field 
seats about 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased to have the game at Citrus College," said Pat Rasmussen, 
assistant to the president at Citrus and director of development. "It's a great 
opportunity for Citrus College and it gives our local residents a chance to see 
some outstanding high school athletes." 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly Pomona, which was already enjoying an excellent recruiting year in 
women's basketball, has signed another top player to a letter of intent, Alison 
Jackson of Los Angeles Crenshaw High. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, a 5-7 point guard, was selected to the All-L.A. City Section first 
team and was named Most Valuable Player for the Cougars. She averaged 15.1 
points and five assists as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson is the third all-section player that the Broncos have signed for next 
season. Pomona had earlier signed All-Southern Section front-line players 
Danielle Carter of Fontana and Tara Davidson of Palm Desert.

'I HAD TO STOP IT,' SAYS GUARD WHO HELD OFF ALLEGED 'SKINHEADS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN and JEFFREY MILLER, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leonard Washington had just bought a six-pack of soda Sunday when he saw a 
group of tattooed, black-booted "skinheads" screaming at a Middle Eastern 
family in a supermarket parking lot in La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
At first, he just watched the scene, which seemed like hundreds, maybe 
thousands of other noisy confrontations he has witnessed in his 15 years as a 
policeman and school security guard. 
</P>
<P>
But then the 34-year-old Pomona resident saw a baseball bat flashing in the 
hand of one of the men wearing black boots. 
</P>
<P>
"I stopped my car right away and jumped out," Washington said Wednesday. "I 
knew I had to stop it right there." 
</P>
<P>
Washington, who dashed in and held off the attackers until police arrived, was 
hailed by authorities Wednesday for risking his own safety to help the family. 
</P>
<P>
The four alleged Neo-Nazi skinheads pleaded not guilty Wednesday in Pomona 
Municipal Court to three felony charges stemming from what prosecutors called a 
racially motivated attack. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Robert Wilson, 28, of West Covina; Timothy Robert Zaal, 25, of Glendora; 
William Killackey, 21, of Yorba Linda, and Amy Killackey, 19, of West Covina 
were each charged with one count of assault with a deadly weapon in the attack 
on the Middle Eastern man. They were also each charged with two counts of 
battery with the intent to interfere with the victims' civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
The felony battery counts are permissible under a new state law targeting 
so-called "hate crimes." 
</P>
<P>
"This cannot be treated as a simple battery, where people go to County Jail for 
a week or a month," Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner said at a press conference 
Wednesday. If convicted, the four could be sentenced to a maximum prison term 
of 5 years and 4 months, Reiner said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the incident began when the defendants, sporting close-cropped 
hair "similar to (the) style worn by Neo-Nazi skinheads," allegedly accosted 
the man and his wife, who was holding their 2-week-old son, as they were taking 
groceries to their car. 
</P>
<P>
Mistakenly believing the family to be Jewish, the four taunted the Glendora 
couple, shouting, "White power!" and "Jew niggers, take your Jew baby home!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kicked to Ground 
</P>
<P>
The man, Manochehr Sadri, 30, told the four to go away and was kicked to the 
ground by one member of the group, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, another man was moving toward the fight with a baseball bat, 
Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
"I got in front of him and just told him to back off," said Washington, a 
slender 6-footer who figures he has stopped at least 200 high school fights as 
a school security guard with the Chino Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The man put the bat down, but moments later another man and the woman entered 
the fight and repeatedly struck Sadri, Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
Sadri's wife, Farzenah, 28, was punched in the face by one of the men after she 
put the baby in their car and attempted to help her husband, Washington said. 
The child was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
In the next few minutes, Washington said he had to stop one of the men from 
throwing a shopping cart at Sadri and another from getting the baseball bat 
again.

<P>
"I figured if I could just hang on for a few more minutes, the police will come 
soon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The fight ended quickly after police arrived a few minutes later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a hyper day at school," said Washington, who, before becoming a 
school security guard, served as a police officer in Pomona and Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. John Hayes, who filed the charges against the four, said of 
Washington: "He's the hero in this case." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier police accounts that Washington had been struck and subjected to racial 
slurs were incorrect, Hayes said. Sadri and his wife could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Led Inside 
</P>
<P>
Several members of the Jewish Defense League were outside the Pomona Courthouse 
on Wednesday as the four suspects were being led inside. Irv Rubin, national 
chairman of the league, shouted, "Nazi bastards!" 
</P>
<P>
One of the suspects replied that he was not a Nazi, noting that he had no 
swastika tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the league shouted, "Never again, Nazis!" as the four 
defendants were taken from the courtroom after their arraignment later in the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
The three male suspects were led into the courthouse through a back entrance, 
dressed as they had been at the time of their arrest, except that police had 
confiscated their boots as evidence. Wilson and Zaal were shirtless, displaying 
an array of tattoos that included a Confederate flag, but no Nazi insignia. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office said in a statement that skinhead activity "is 
not common in this area of the San Gabriel Valley." 
</P>
<P>
However, Reiner said at the press conference that, "it's just a spark, but you 
have to jump on it because a spark can turn into a fire, and then it gets out 
of control." 
</P>
<P>
In the ethnically diverse West Covina neighborhood where Wilson and Amy 
Killackey live together, friends who grew up with Wilson said they were shocked 
to learn that he has been charged in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Valdez, who lives on the same street, said Wilson is not the type to pick 
a fight. 
</P>
<P>
"You can say he started the fight, and I wouldn't believe you," said Valdez, 
who said Wilson and Amy Killackey have asked him to be their son's godfather. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Cordera and other friends said Wilson frequently changed his appearance, 
sporting mohawks to short hair to crew cuts.

FRENCH CONNECTION SUSPECT ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who allegedly oversaw heroin distribution in Harlem for the notorious 
French Connection was arrested Wednesday in Los Angeles, 17 years after he fled 
investigators probing his ties to the narcotics underworld. 
</P>
<P>
Stanton Garland, identified as the head of a street distribution network for 
the powerful drug ring of the early 1960s, was taken into custody by U.S. 
marshals as he visited his badly injured son at a Baldwin Hills hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the manhunt came to an end when Garland, 60, arrived at 
Meadowbrook Neurological Center on Tuesday morning to arrange for the discharge 
of his son, whose insurance was scheduled to expire. Marshals had been staking 
out the hospital for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It just so happened today was the day. The money ran out for his son. Time ran 
out for him," Deputy U.S. Marshal Robert Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
As two marshals quietly approached him in the hospital parking lot, Garland 
surrendered without resistance, Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
"He basically said that he was in a way relieved that he was in custody so that 
he didn't have to worry about being a fugitive for the rest of his life," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subject of Movie 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Garland, allegedly a major heroin distributor in New York 
through the early 1970s, was an important link in the French Connection heroin 
ring that was the subject of a 1971 Academy Award-winning film. 
</P>
<P>
Two New York City police detectives uncovered the ring, which was manufacturing 
heroin in secret laboratories and packaging plants in Marseille out of morphine 
base supplied by the Sicilian Mafia and then transporting it to New York. When 
they broke the case in 1962, authorities confiscated 120 pounds of almost pure 
heroin that had been smuggled into the United States hidden in a car aboard a 
trans-Atlantic liner. 
</P>
<P>
"Our understanding is he was the major . . . distributor (for the ring) for 
Harlem," said David O'Flaherty, the deputy U.S. marshal in Brooklyn who oversaw 
the manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear when Garland initially was arrested in connection with the New 
York case. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his escape on Sept. 26, 1972, Garland was facing a possible 
20-year sentence on heroin distribution charges in New York, O'Flaherty said. 
Federal drug agents were in the process of interviewing him in the U.S. 
attorney's office in Brooklyn about his organized crime contacts when they left 
the room momentarily and Garland fled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the FBI pursued the case, then handed it over to the marshal's 
office in Brooklyn in 1979. But authorities "never got a single tip," 
O'Flaherty said. Relatives were uncooperative, and surveillance of family 
members proved fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
Then, checking telephone toll records of one of Garland's relatives, he said, 
marshals noticed that several calls seemed to be going to a hospital in 
Bakersfield and another in Los Angeles. Checking further, they learned that a 
Lonnie Garland, who had been badly injured when struck by a car recently, had 
been admitted to the Bakersfield facility and then transferred to the 
neurological hospital in Baldwin Hills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Photo Recognized 
</P>
<P>
That is when Grossman and his partner, Ernie Santoscoy, took over the case out 
of the Los Angeles office. They visited the hospital, where an administrator 
said a man who looked like the one in the aging, badly lit photograph had been 
in to visit Lonnie Garland on a few occasions. 
</P>
<P>
The administrator, Grossman said, promised to telephone if he came back. But 
immersed in one of the most important cases of their careers, the two deputies 
started parking out by the hospital when they were not busy -- just in case. 
"Just sitting in a car all day. It's a lot of fun," Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
Then they learned that Lonnie Garland's insurance was scheduled to expire 
Tuesday and that he would have to be discharged, most likely to his family. 
Grossman had a hunch it would be a good day to get there early. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman and Santoscoy parked in the upper parking lot behind the hospital and 
watched as a man answering Garland's description walked out of the parking lot 
and into the hospital. Sure enough, their portable telephone rang moments 
later. 
</P>
<P>
By prearrangement, Grossman said, a hospital administrator notified the 
marshals of Garland's arrival and arranged a ruse to get him out into the 
parking lot, telling him that she needed to discuss his son's hospital records 
outside the earshot of the rest of the hospital staff. 
</P>
<P>
Once they were safely outside, Grossman approached from one side of the parking 
lot, Santoscoy from the other, leaving their guns in their holsters. "We just 
walked up very quietly to him, and we just basically said, 'Mr. Garland, you're 
under arrest,' " Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Shocked in a Way' 
</P>
<P>
"He stopped talking. Basically, he knew the jig had been had, and that was it. 
He was shocked in a way, I think." 
</P>
<P>
The only thing Garland expressed regret about, Grossman said, was that he would 
be unable to care for his son. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he was very relieved he had been captured," he added. "He mentioned it 
was a hardship for him to always try and live his life, but to have to stop and 
say, 'What if?' " 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Brenda K. Sannes said she had no information about any 
pending drug charges against Garland, and O'Flaherty had no details about the 
charges. U.S. Magistrate Robert M. Stone ordered him held without bail on an 
escape indictment and scheduled a June 9 hearing to confirm Garland's identity.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EASTWOOD PALIMONY CASE HEARD IN SECRET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A potentially precedent-setting palimony suit filed against actor-director 
Clint Eastwood by his former longtime live-in girlfriend, Sondra Locke, was 
heard behind closed doors Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The pair hired a private judge to hear the case and attorneys refused to 
disclose the identity of the judge or the location of the proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
All legal documents in the case have been ordered sealed. 
</P>
<P>
In her lawsuit filed April 26, Locke claimed that Eastwood locked her out of 
their Bel-Air mansion, placed her belongings in storage and refused to allow 
her visitation rights with her pet parrot. 
</P>
<P>
Locke, 42, also alleged in the complaint that, during their relationship, 
Eastwood forced her to have two abortions and undergo sterilization. Eastwood 
has denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Locke's lawyers offered to settle the dispute two days after the suit was filed 
if Eastwood would agree to give her two houses, monthly payments of $15,000 and 
a lump sum of $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood rejected the offer.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AIDS COALITION CHARGES HARASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A militant AIDS activist group that staged a boisterous sit-in at a Board of 
Supervisors meeting earlier this month charged Wednesday that its members have 
been harassed by sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference outside the Hall of Administration in Los Angeles, members 
of AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power distributed a chronology of eight incidents 
of alleged harassment they said occurred between May 15 and 25. 
</P>
<P>
"We're being harassed because we're activists and we've protested the Board of 
Supervisors' AIDS policies," said Connie Norman, a member of the group. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department did not comment on the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged incidents included members of the group being stopped in a car by 
deputies and searched for 40 minutes following an ACT-UP meeting in West 
Hollywood, and anonymous telephone calls to employers of ACT-UP members by 
callers asking questions about the employees' involvement with the group. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen ACT-UP members were arrested May 16 after they disrupted a supervisors 
meeting.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL ASKS REVIEW OF 1991 PAY RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council asked a committee Wednesday to review a proposed 
pay raise for elected officials that could hike salaries up to 53% by 1991 if 
approved by voters. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joy Picus, who chairs the Personnel and Labor Relations Committee, 
said the review may be delayed for several months until an ethics panel 
appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley can make recommendations about outside 
employment and other key issues. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which would tie council salaries to those of Municipal Court 
judges and ultimately lead to a 53% increase by 1991, is part of a package of 
recommendations made by the city's Official Salaries Authority. 
</P>
<P>
Another key recommendation is that none of the city's elected officials -- the 
mayor, the city attorney, the city controller, and the 15 council members -- 
would accept outside employment. 
</P>
<P>
Picus said there is some concern among council members that "this wasn't the 
best year to be discussing" the large pay hike.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HEIGHT LAW STIFFENED FOR VENTURA BLVD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday strengthened a temporary 45-foot height 
limit for new buildings on Ventura Boulevard by strictly defining how to 
measure a building's height. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which applies to the entire 17-mile length of the boulevard from 
Studio City to Woodland Hills, was prompted by angry Studio City residents who 
complained that a 95-foot Ventura Boulevard office building blocked their view 
of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, building heights will be measured from the lowest point of the 
curb on Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions are designed to close a loophole in the boulevard's temporary 
construction-control ordinance, which was enacted in 1985 to give city planners 
time to set standards for the Valley's most commercially popular thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 1985 ordinance restricted heights to 45 feet, it did not clearly 
state how the buildings should be measured.

RAPID-FIRE BUYING OF ASSAULT GUNS MARKS DEADLINE OF NEW LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two hours before the 9 p.m. closing time at Turner's Outdoorsman in West 
Covina, the gun counter was crowded with people looking to buy military-type 
assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"After this," explained Ruben Diaz, a mechanic, "we won't be able to get them 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
In all, 19 customers bought semiautomatic weapons at the store Wednesday -- 
thus beating a midnight deadline, after which the ground rules will change for 
buying such guns in California. 
</P>
<P>
By buying Wednesday, owners can register their guns and keep them without a 
problem. After midnight, a restrictive permit procedure became effective under 
a new state law, virtually banning acquisition of 50 different semiautomatic 
rifles, pistols and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reasons for Purchase 
</P>
<P>
Diaz, who described himself as a gun enthusiast, said he was not looking for a 
better way to protect his home -- "to me, they are the same as any other gun," 
he confided -- but simply for another weapon to fire out in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Others said they were, in effect, taking advantage of the law by making 
investments in weapons that are going to be in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just going to sell it," said one young customer, who declined to give his 
name after bought a Bullpup AK-47 for $799.99. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the guns were going for twice as much as they did just weeks ago. But 
that didn't seem to bother a short man wearing dark glasses, a purple sports 
shirt and blue jeans, who peeled off hundred-dollar bills to buy a $600 assault 
rifle. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt they will increase in value," said another buyer. 
</P>
<P>
Turner's Outdoorsman in West Covina is one of a chain of nine stores operated 
by one of Southern California's largest gun dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from around the state indicated that sales were booming elsewhere as 
well -- except in Los Angeles and several other Southern California cities that 
have banned sale of semiautomatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very busy on Thursday and Friday last week, and we are very busy 
today, " said Mike Lum, vice president of Chino-based Turner's Outdoorsman. 
"Over a year ago at this time, we are probably up four- or five-fold. 
</P>
<P>
In San Leandro, Tony Cucchiara of Traders Sports, the state's largest retail 
gun dealer, told Associated Press that customers are buying "anything that 
looks ugly, that looks like an assault weapon. . . . There are a lot of people 
buying these things for souvenirs. Little old men and little old ladies are 
walking into the store, saying they want to buy an AK-47." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Permit Applications 
</P>
<P>
Californians can still legally purchase semiautomatic weapons under the 
legislation signed by the governor last week. But those who buy between today 
and Jan. 1 must apply for a permit from the state to keep them. And those 
denied permits -- similar to one required for machine guns -- will be required 
to dispose of their guns in some way, such as selling them to authorized 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
The provision of the law banning sales of many semiautomatic weapons goes into 
effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Lum speculated that, in practice, it will be virtually impossible for gun 
owners to get permits during the next six months. Under the state's criteria, 
they must have "good cause" to acquire the weapons, such as using them for law 
enforcement purposes or selling or renting them to motion picture studios. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not going to give you a permit," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
Will Hunsaker, assistant manager of the West Covina store, said the Turner's 
chain will "probably sell the (remaining) guns to dealers out of state." 
</P>
<P>
Gun store operators in Los Angeles were doing business as usual Wednesday, 
without a last-minute rush. Sale of military-style assault weapons has been 
prohibited since March 1 under an ordinance approved unanimously by the City 
Council in February.

STATE ATTY. GEN. TO AUDIT L.A. AFRICAN TRADE UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state attorney general's office is planning to conduct an audit of a Los 
Angeles city-funded African trade task force run by a business associate of 
Mayor Tom Bradley to determine whether funds were spent properly, a spokesman 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Ashby, spokesman for Atty. Gen. John K. Van De Kamp, said, however, that 
his office is awaiting the outcome of the city's own audit of the Task Force 
for Africa-Los Angeles Relations. The city controller's findings "will help us 
assess whether there is reason for concern or not," Ashby said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the mayor himself is "not the subject" of the attorney general's 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
The task force has been championed by Bradley and run by Juanita St. John, his 
business associate in a Riverside County real estate investment. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Campbell, registrar for the attorney general's Registry of Charitable 
Trusts in Sacramento, said the attorney general's office in Los Angeles last 
month requested information about the task force after a series of articles 
about the group appeared in the Herald-Examiner. 
</P>
<P>
"They may have had more income than they were reporting to us," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
St. John said Wednesday that she has "no problems" with a state audit of her 
group. "We have nothing to hide," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The group, set up to promote trade between local businesses and Africa, has 
received about $400,000 from the city since 1984. The mayor had included funds 
for the group each year in his budget proposal and had successfully fought a 
move in the council to delete them. 
</P>
<P>
This year, however, in response to the controversy over his personal financial 
ties, Bradley withdrew his request to give the group $120,000 in city funds for 
1989-90.

EX-ACTOR TESTIFIES ON SLAIN PRODUCER'S FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McDOUGAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former actor who portrayed a central character in television's long-running 
"Sanford and Son" situation comedy testified in Los Angeles Municipal Court on 
Wednesday that he acted as bodyguard for slain theatrical producer Roy Radin 
and was armed with a handgun to protect Radin the night he is believed to have 
been executed in a remote canyon north of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Radin) was my personal manager," former actor Grady Demond Wilson said 
after taking the stand in the 3-week-old preliminary hearing into Radin's 
murder. "He said something might happen to him as a result of his association 
with the film thing . . . the film 'The Cotton Club.' " 
</P>
<P>
Radin's bullet-riddled corpse was found near Gorman nearly six years ago. He 
had been dead for several weeks, according to a coroner's autopsy. Before his 
disappearance, Radin had been negotiating with producer Robert Evans and a 
representative of the Puerto Rican government to underwrite production of 
Evans' movie, "The Cotton Club." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, 43, who was represented by Radin from 1980 through 1983, testified that 
his life style in the early 1980s -- during his heyday as TV's Lamont Sanford 
and later as half of "The New Odd Couple" -- was characterized by drugs, 
alcohol and high living. Now a Christian minister, Wilson said that by 1983, he 
had acquired a cocaine habit that amounted to as much as two grams daily. 
</P>
<P>
On the last day Radin is believed by prosecutors to have been alive, May 13, 
1983, the producer asked Wilson to meet him at Radin's suite at the Hollywood 
Regency Hotel. Later that evening, Radin was to have dinner with business 
associates at La Scala restaurant in Beverly Hills, according to Wilson, and 
Radin wanted it to appear as though Wilson coincidentally was having dinner at 
a nearby table. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson testified that he regularly carried a gun with him in his sports car in 
those days and frequently acted as Radin's bodyguard. Radin asked him to park 
in front of the hotel and surreptitiously follow the producer to the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
As Radin and a flashily dressed woman entered a stretch limousine that stopped 
outside the hotel, Wilson began to follow in his own car. After several blocks, 
he lost sight of the limousine on Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and his secretary then drove to La Scala and had dinner, but neither 
Radin nor the woman ever showed up. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors believe that the woman was Karen DeLayne (Lanie) Greenberger, an 
alleged Florida cocaine dealer who introduced Radin to Evans. According to 
previous court testimony, Greenberger is believed to have ordered Radin killed 
by William Molony Mentzer and Alex Lamota Marti, two former bodyguards for 
Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt, and Robert Ulmer Lowe, a fourth 
co-defendant. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors believe that Greenberger thought Radin might have been involved in 
stealing cocaine and money from her and that the producer was refusing to cut 
Greenberger in on his "Cotton Club" deal with Evans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Did Not Recognize Accused 
</P>
<P>
From the stand, Wilson said he did not recognize three co-defendants accused in 
Radin's murder. As Deputy Dist. Atty. Sally Thomas stood behind Greenberger, 
Mentzer and Marti and asked Wilson to identify them, Wilson said he recognized 
none of them. 
</P>
<P>
"He looks like the cab driver who brought me over here," Wilson quipped when 
Thomas stood behind Marti. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll stipulate to that he's the cab driver," retorted Richard Hirsch, Marti's 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Lowe, the fourth defendant, is fighting extradition from Maryland.

EX-L.A. OFFICER GIVES UP HIS LIFE TO SAVE FILM CREW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Allan DeLapp, 60, a retired Los Angeles police officer, died a hero early 
Wednesday morning when a hit-run driver hurled him into the pavement as he was 
leading a film crew through Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
Astride a motorcycle, DeLapp was escorting the crew riding along 7th Street 
when a driver sped through a stop sign at Oxford Avenue and slammed into 
DeLapp, police said. The camera crew said DeLapp spied the driver in time to 
save the film crew from harm by using his motorcycle as a roadblock, according 
to the production company's attorney, Lori Todd. 
</P>
<P>
"He saw the oncoming vehicle and apparently turned his motorcycle sideways and 
took the brunt of it," Todd said. "Needless to say, that is an heroic act. 
</P>
<P>
"People felt he saved their lives. Literally, that is what I keep hearing," 
said Todd, who added that the workers were too distraught to talk about the 
accident with a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, Antonio Harold Rosas, 21, a Colombian native living in Los 
Angeles, was found hiding in nearby bushes about an hour after the accident 
occurred at 2:30 a.m. Police, who booked Rosas on suspicion of murder, said he 
was drunk at the time, with a a blood-alcohol level of .21, more than twice the 
legal limit. 
</P>
<P>
The crew had been shooting scenes for a movie entitled "Dead Men Don't Die," 
which stars Elliot Gould. The comedy, featuring zombies and a newsroom, is the 
first film by Waymar Productions. Wednesday's shoot was canceled because of the 
accident, Todd said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increased His Speed 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said they thought DeLapp, of Torrance, might have been alive today 
except for the inexplicable actions of the driver. After Rosas allegedly struck 
DeLapp, horrified spectators watched as he increased his speed, pinning DeLapp 
against the hood of the car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver "collided head-on with the officer, then accelerated for some 
reason, thinking perhaps that the accelerator was the brake," Sgt. Bill Page 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The car sped 150 to 200 feet east down 7th Street before hitting a parked car 
and a curb and rolling over DeLapp, police said. Two members of the film crew 
grabbed the suspect, but he fled after they joined colleagues who were 
attempting to lift the suspect's car off DeLapp's chest. 
</P>
<P>
DeLapp died at the scene, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, members of the crew, communicating with walkie-talkies, dashed through 
the neighborhood looking for the driver, said Lisa Samia, who watched the scene 
from her apartment balcony. 
</P>
<P>
"Their voices were trembling," Samia said. "When they knew he was dead, the 
ladies were hugging each other." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Found Hiding in Bushes 
</P>
<P>
A police dog found Rosas hiding in a row of bushes near a parking lot a short 
distance from the accident scene. 
</P>
<P>
Samia said Rosas, who appeared curled up in a fetal position, was grabbed by 
the back of his shirt by police and carried as if he were a piece of luggage. 
Rosas was treated at County-USC Medical Center for treatment of facial injuries 
and booked there. 
</P>
<P>
DeLapp retired as a motorcycle officer from the Los Angeles Police Department 
in 1969 after an accident permanently damaged his knee, said Monica Cameron, 
one of DeLapp's three daughters. He worked for awhile at a drilling rig company 
and ran his own mechanic's shop, but was eventually drawn back to his love of 
motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
He found working as a motorcycle officer for the studios during the last eight 
years an ideal job and took great pride in his two motorcycles, which he 
constantly washed and polished, Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a good thing for him to get into. He still had a little action," 
Cameron added. 
</P>
<P>
"He loved it. You couldn't get him off his motorcycle," she said. "I knew he'd 
die on his motorcycle."

CASE COULD OPEN CURTAINS OF HOLLYWOOD AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CIEPLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A little-noticed court decision has put pressure on a super-secret Hollywood 
agency to reveal a broad range of financial information about its big-name 
Hollywood clients. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, handed down by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge earlier this 
year, ordered Creative Artists Agency to open its books to attorneys and 
accountants representing casting director Ellen Meyer in her hotly contested 
divorce proceeding against CAA co-founder Ron Meyer. Settlement talks to avoid 
a public trial have been held and a formal settlement conference, considered 
fragile by both sides, is set for July 27. Individuals close to both sides have 
called a settlement likely within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Meyer, whose 11-year marriage to Ron Meyer ended in separation about two 
years ago, is demanding a share of her husband's assets, including his agency 
stock. CAA represents hundreds of major movie stars and TV producers -- 
including Dustin Hoffman, Tom Cruise, Aaron Spelling, Sylvester Stallone, Jane 
Fonda, and Robert Redford -- and is widely regarded as one of the most powerful 
institutions in the entertainment business. 
</P>
<P>
A trial in the divorce case could provide the first public glimpse of the 
privately held agency's fees and practices -- though disclosure of star 
salaries and agency contracts isn't likely to happen quickly. CAA has promised 
to appeal the disclosure order, and any documents delivered would be withheld 
from public scrutiny by a protective order. Further, the ongoing settlement 
talks between CAA and the Meyers are aimed at staving off a trial, at which 
agency secrets might be aired. 
</P>
<P>
In resisting the disclosure order, Meyer -- perhaps Hollywood's most prominent 
actors' agent -- at one point told the court that CAA's financial data are so 
secret that even he, one of three co-owners, wasn't allowed access. 
</P>
<P>
"Those documents have been maintained exclusively under the direction and 
control of (agency president Michael) Ovitz," Meyer said in an affidavit filed 
with the court. In a statement that indicated Ovitz's personal control over the 
agency, Meyer added in the affidavit: 
</P>
<P>
"I am absolutely certain that if I request Mr. Ovitz to produce that 
documentation, he will decline that request, as he has done in the past. 
Therefore, if petitioner's requested order (to disclose) is made by the court, 
it would require a direct confrontation between me and Mr. Ovitz. I am also 
confident that if I were to create a confrontation situation and demand the 
production of documents, I run a risk of expulsion from CAA. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Ovitz and Meyer declined to comment on the case. Attorneys for Oberstein, 
Doniger &amp; Fetter, which represents Ellen Meyer, also declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Filings in the case, which was initiated on Sept. 21, 1987, provide a look at 
the way CAA operates. 
</P>
<P>
According to a filing by Ron Meyer, for instance, CAA president Michael Ovitz 
since 1986 has owned 55.556% of the agency, while Meyer and TV agent William 
Haber own 22.222% each. The arrangement took effect that summer, when the 
agency increased Ovitz's power by buying out shareholders Rowland Perkins and 
Martin Baum. Previously, Ovitz owned about 47%, while four partners -- Meyer, 
Haber, Perkins, and Baum -- split the rest in equal shares, according to the 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Meyer's court filings estimate Ron Meyer's stake in the agency to be 
worth at least $10 million to $15 million, but they argue his stake may be 
worth twice as much -- something her attorneys have claimed they can't 
determine without access to an accurate accounting of income from star salaries 
and packaging fees. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ellen Meyer's filings Ron Meyer's "admitted income" is not less 
than $1.8 million a year. Ron Meyer's court filings claim that Ellen isn't 
entitled to any community property stake in the agency, since she married him 
three months after it was founded in February of 1975. 
</P>
<P>
CAA has hired its own attorney and has filed documents to protect its business 
practices. In its filings CAA has argued that to disclose its records might 
expose sensitive areas by indicating, for instance, where more than one client 
is up for the same part, and might violate the privacy and competitive position 
of Hollywood stars by revealing the terms under which they work. 
</P>
<P>
Agency fees are based on a percentage of income from particular clients or TV 
shows. The court order, entered last January, required CAA to reveal "any 
analysis of revenues by client" and "all accounting books and records," among 
other things. 
</P>
<P>
Feelings have occasionally run high in the case. At one point, for instance, 
Ellen Meyer in her affidavit accused her husband of keeping her support 
payments low to "teach me a lesson" for demanding a full accounting from the 
agency. She added in the document that various partners in the agency had told 
her they would fight disclosure with tactics as severe as terminating her 
husband's involvement with CAA, or reducing Meyer's fortune by having his stock 
"bought out on a forced liquidation at below market value."

'PHANTOM' TICKETS DRAW TOP PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Wanted: Buyers for "Phantom of the Opera" tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you how I got the tickets," said Joan Yeoman of Los Angeles, who 
was one of 33 people who put ads in The Times' Sunday edition trying to sell 
"Phantom" tickets, "but I'll take the best offer." She, like the many others, 
hiked her asking price to $500 a ticket for the hit musical, which opened 
Wednesday at the Music Center, but were slowly dropping the price just to sell 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't buy them to pitch them, I bought them as gifts," said Yeoman, who 
didn't have to wait in line for her six tickets (face value $50 each). Her 
boyfriend knew someone in the business. "But two of the relatives can't go so I 
decided to give it a shot. . . . Seeing the show will be great, but selling 
them will be even greater, I'm money hungry." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Miller, a salesman at Front Row Center Ticket Service, said tickets to 
"Phantom" are very hard to get. His firm was selling tickets in the first three 
rows for $200. "I'd say . . . it's the biggest that I can remember. 'Evita' was 
big, '42nd Street.' 'Les Miz,' $100 for the first seven or eight rows. 
'Phantom' is a much broader demand and broader audience, almost a pop event." 
</P>
<P>
But most Los Angeles ticket brokers said that while the musical is certainly 
one of the most popular events to hit the city, they are not so scarce that one 
needs to pay more than $200 per ticket. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'Phantom' is doing very well, but it's not a matter of being the biggest 
thing to hit town," said a spokeswoman for Equity Theatre Ticket Service. "I 
can get a ticket for you for tonight, right now, no problem." 
</P>
<P>
Her asking price was $200 for orchestra. She said people who think they have to 
pay outrageous prices are under the wrong impression: "I saw a ticket in the 
classified for $5,000, but if you called that guy right now, I'm sure he still 
has the ticket. It's not that big of a play." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Wagman of Dynamite Tickets in Los Angeles said there seems to be a greater 
demand for tickets for the Laker basketball finals than for "Phantom" tickets: 
"We've been swamped all morning," he said Tuesday, when the tickets for the 
basketball finals first went on sale. "This makes the 'Phantom' look like 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman at Good Time Tickets in Los Angeles said people who are 
advertising "Phantom" tickets for more than $200 are "crazy," and those who are 
actually buying them are "totally insane." 
</P>
<P>
"The tickets are scarce for the month of June and July," she said, "but they 
are not impossible to get. . . . To try to sell a ticket for such a high price, 
that's really gouging. I would be really curious to see if anyone is really 
buying them for those prices." 
</P>
<P>
Many private-enterprise ticket sellers did not want to give their names, but 
after calling several the highest asking price turned out to be $750 each for 
orchestra seats during a June 2 performance. 
</P>
<P>
One seller who managed to unload his tickets said: "I paid $350 for each ticket 
and I barely broke even." His seats, for which he was asking $500, were second 
row, center. He added that he will be out of town on the performance date. 
"Believe me, I was more than happy just to get rid of them." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the "Phantom" said although orchestra seats are sold out for 
the show through next week, there are plenty of seats available through the end 
of November. The tickets, she said, are $50-$32.50. The play, which set a 
record $15.3 million in advance sales, is expected to run two years in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We in no way condone scalpers," she said, "but we cannot stop someone from 
buying tickets and turning around and selling them."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'PALESTINIAN NETWORK': A FULL REPORT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anatomy of a highly questionable news story. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It was the lead segment on Saturday's installment of "West 57th," the low-rated 
but usually respectable CBS News magazine series. 
</P>
<P>
The reporter was Karen Burnes, an experienced, award-winning correspondent with 
an impressive record in investigative journalism. The producer was Kathy 
McManus. 
</P>
<P>
The segment's title was "The Palestinians: Dirty Business." 
</P>
<P>
The premise was that a "network" of Palestinians -- most of whose leaders are 
related and come from the same area in the Israeli-occupied West Bank -- is 
committing crimes in the United States to fund political action and terror in 
the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the report) was well documented," Burnes said later from New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked on the story for more than a year," McManus said from New York. "I'm 
absolutely convinced what we said is correct. I wouldn't change a word of it." 
</P>
<P>
"I think they did an excellent job," executive producer Andrew Lack said from 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a different opinion: 
</P>
<P>
The point is not whether "West 57th" may have been right about the alleged 
network, but how it went about trying to show it. The segment was less a story 
than largely unsupported or loosely attributed allegations reported in a 
confusing and misleading time warp. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny West Bank community of Deir Dibwan was identified by Burnes as the 
source of the alleged network. "U.S. and Canadian law enforcement officials 
consider this town at the center of radical political activity and organized 
crime" that is "carried on by a network of Palestinians who travel a circuit 
from the West Bank to the United States," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Burnes cited Palestinians engaging in such scams as insurance and other frauds 
to fund "what the FBI calls political and terrorist activities." 
</P>
<P>
No FBI representative appeared on the program to corroborate that. The FBI 
"wouldn't be interviewed" on camera, Burnes said afterward by phone. 
</P>
<P>
However, FBI spokesman Charles Steinmetz -- whom McManus suggested I call for 
elaboration -- said that "West 57th" never requested an on-camera interview. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they were in a hurry," Steinmetz said from Washington, D.C. "They (he 
said McManus was the only representative from the show he spoke to) called here 
just a few days before that (the segment) aired." 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Steinmetz said that he told McManus only that "a number of scams 
were going on throughout the United States, and that money was being funneled 
back to several of the Palestinian organizations. Where it goes from there, we 
don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Hence, Steinmetz said, Burnes was "stretching it" in reporting the FBI as 
saying "terrorist activities" are financed from Palestinian-run scams. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't talk to anybody about terrorist groups," he said. "They ('West 57th') 
would like to think it was terrorists. I could see where the story was going." 
</P>
<P>
(After our initial phone interview, Lack called back Wednesday morning to say 
that McManus had since spoken to Steinmetz and that Steinmetz "confirms 
absolutely everything we said in the broadcast." Lack added that Steinmetz told 
McManus that "he stands behind us completely, that indeed everything we said 
was accurate and appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
(Steinmetz refuted Lack's account when I read it to him on the phone. How could 
he be "standing behind" the report when he hadn't even seen it, he asked. 
</P>
<P>
(I read him my quotes from our previous conversation, and he did not dispute 
them. However, Steinmetz, who said the information he gave "West 57th" came 
from Bob Ricks, deputy assistant director of the FBI's criminal investigative 
division, said now that he did not want me to use the quotes he earlier had 
given me. However, no arrangement had been made that that earlier interview 
would be off the record.) 
</P>
<P>
The alleged link to terrorist activities was never adequately substantiated in 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
Burnes sought to establish the link in an interview with Florida police 
detective Don Cannon, whom she said had headed a task force probing a "pattern 
of Palestinian criminal activity in Florida." 
</P>
<P>
Burnes asked Cannon if the Palestinians in question were "an organized network 
of people motivated by political purpose, or are they just common crooks?" 
</P>
<P>
Cannon: "We see the money leaving, but we don't see that much coming back in. . 
. . So it's going to fund something else." In "the Middle East?" Burnes asked. 
Yes, replied Cannon, attributing his information to "raw intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
Burnes: "So does that leave you believing they might be funding terrorist 
activities?" 
</P>
<P>
Again citing "raw intelligence," Cannon said that money is "being sent back to 
fund the PLO or the PFLP (the terrorist popular front for the liberation of 
Palestine) or the intifida (the Arabic word for the Palestinian uprising on the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip)." 
</P>
<P>
Burnes did not ask Cannon to define "raw intelligence." Reached in Sunrise, 
Fla., where he is on the police force, Cannon said that "raw intelligence" is 
information "we may have gotten from several sources, but we consider it raw 
until we can verify it from several more sources and get more etched-in-stone 
information." 
</P>
<P>
As for the "network," cut to Washington state, where Burnes said that a "group 
of Palestinians doing bustouts (opening stores and quickly vanishing with 
merchandise bought on credit) bilked their creditors out of nearly $3.5 million 
before vanishing." 
</P>
<P>
Burnes ticked off other illegal activities that she said authorities attributed 
to Palestinians and said one of the Palestinians "left a forwarding address, 
Deir Dibwan." 
</P>
<P>
Cut to Burnes with a group of "elders" in Deir Dibwan. "Each of these men lived 
in the United States and most of them ran stores under investigation by the FBI 
and by local police in at least 15 states," Burnes said. 
</P>
<P>
Elderly man in Arab headdress: "I have liquor store in San Francisco five 
years." 
</P>
<P>
It was a classic case of implied guilt by association. Stores were said to be 
under investigation. This man had a store. Thus he was suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Now cut to Burnes back in the United States with a woman she identified as 
Veronica Heath, who is "related by marriage" to Palestinian brothers. Heath: 
"They contributed to the PLO." 
</P>
<P>
Burnes said that "investigators consider some of the family key players in 
illegal and possibly radical activity." Heath said that she attended meetings 
at which "everyone was posing in front of the Palestinian flag and . . . 
holding up guns." 
</P>
<P>
Onward now to "small stores in Miami" that Burnes said "have now become part of 
an investigation." They have huge profits, she said. "Much of the money is 
smuggled out of the country, in one case by a Palestinian grandmother carrying 
the bills in her clothing." 
</P>
<P>
Who? Where? When? . 
</P>
<P>
Burnes confronted a Palestinian grocery store owner: "Authorities say these 
Palestinians are linked by family, by friendship, by location. They all come 
from the same place on the West Bank." Still, all we had was her word for that. 
</P>
<P>
Cut to Burnes back in Deir Dibwan with the mayor, who seemed to be able to 
understand but not speak English. "How many people . . . in this community have 
some form of contact with America?" Burnes asked. 
</P>
<P>
"There are about 2,000," the mayor replied through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
Burnes: "So about half of the people in this town are in America sometime or 
another?" But wait a minute. Her original question was about "contact" with 
America, not being "in" America. Did the mayor understand the subtle difference 
in her second question when, through the interpreter, he responded "about 
half," seeming to agree with Burnes that 50% of the town had been in the United 
States? 
</P>
<P>
Cut to Burnes back in the United States, saying: "Just last week, the FBI 
confirmed that some small Palestinian businesses across America use the money 
they generate to support the PLO." 
</P>
<P>
The next voice we heard was that of Gordon Park: "What they would do is throw a 
brick through their front window and say, 'Oh, gosh, I got burglarized.' " Park 
was identified as an attorney for a California insurance company "taken in by 
Palestinians from the same network." The "network" whose existance had not been 
proved. 
</P>
<P>
The editing was misleading. Eight years separated the "they" Park referred to 
and the "small Palestinian businesses" that Burnes referred to, for as Park 
later noted in passing, his case was "back in '81." 
</P>
<P>
Onward. "Affidavits filed in Memphis describe a Palestinian leaving for the 
Middle East with 20 stacks of $50 and $100 bills, each a foot high. Undercover 
authorities also made contact with two Palestinians who were seeking to buy 
firearms to ship to Jordan," Burnes said. "The purpose: to kill Jews." 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication who filed the affidavits or when these events were 
supposed to have happened. Perhaps a few observant viewers were able to read 
the "1986" on one of the affidavits as it quickly scrolled by, which showed 
only when the document was filed, not when the described events occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Onward. "Documents obtained by 'West 57th' reveal an even more sinister side to 
the Palestinian network," Burnes said. Again, that's the "network" whose 
existance she had not substantiated. 
</P>
<P>
She told of Albuquerque police finding "photos of Al Fatah fighters living in 
the United States, and bomb plans drawn on Al Fatah's letterhead. Al Fatah has 
been linked to terrorist activities against Americans." 
</P>
<P>
I learned later only from asking McManus that this discovery was made in 1980. 
"I don't think dates are important," she said on the phone. "This is a story 
about the pattern of criminal activity. We showed things from 10 years ago and 
things from today." Without telling viewers which was which. 
</P>
<P>
Burnes asked Heath about the brothers: "Veronica, how dedicated do you think 
these people are to the Palestinian cause?" And Heath replied: "Some of them 
would lay their life on the line." But that proved nothing, because many 
people, including Americans, would lay their lives on the line for a cause they 
believed in. 
</P>
<P>
"West 57th." Sometimes the news business is a dirty business.

CRITIC AT LARGE: SEARCHING FOR THE APPEAL OF BAKER, 'LET'S GET LOST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Epstein, the respected film and jazz historian and program host at KLON in 
Long Beach, has written to inquire rather sharply why Calendar ran not one but 
two devastatingly negative reviews of Bruce Weber's documentary about Chet 
Baker, "Let's Get Lost." 
</P>
<P>
The answer is that the film seemed to call, as some others do, for two kinds of 
expertise. It is a work of the film makers' art; it is also the biography of an 
important jazz figure. The reviews by Times film critic Sheila Benson and Times 
jazz critic Leonard Feather were, naturally, written independently, and the 
score could have been 2-0 in favor of the film, a split decision, or 0-2 
against. It proved to be the last. Did it ever. 
</P>
<P>
Other critics have praised the film lavishly. "Let's Get Lost" obviously 
divides viewers, which if nothing else is the mark of a strongly provocative 
work. My own response was largely negative, I confess, but rather than drive a 
third nail into Weber's film, let me speculate on why it draws such contrasting 
reactions. 
</P>
<P>
I've often thought that films, both factual and fictional, can affect viewers 
so strongly that the contents override even positive assessments of the form. 
It's the ancient tendency to want to kill the messenger who has arrived bearing 
bad news. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever his skills as a trumpet player, Chet Baker was a pathetic figure, the 
unutterably, boyishly handsome young player who looked like a recent graduate 
of "Leave It to Beaver" but who ended up as a hollow-cheeked, toothless, 
mumbling, all but brain-dead relic. 
</P>
<P>
Weber, crosscutting between then and now, accentuates this decline and fall, 
this syncopated rake's progress, because it is the bitter and inescapable fact 
of Baker's life. It is said to be true, and may well be, that the film was 
begun in affection and admiration, along with what surely was a morbid 
fascination. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is that Baker is dismaying and uncomfortable to contemplate. He is 
the boy wonder gone awry. The film is no doubt a cautionary tale about drug 
abuse, although the last thing "Let's Get Lost" is is preachy. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that it is an angering film to watch. The skills of compilation, 
investigation and editing together are quite fine. It is just that there is no 
evidence offered -- if in fact there was any -- that Baker made any serious 
effort to kick his habit. He appears to have surrendered to it with an 
astonishing lack of will. The consequences are horrifying, and they undercut 
the cautionary aspects of the film because the clear message is, You can't 
fight it; don't bother. 
</P>
<P>
As I watched the film, I kept thinking of a lakeside amusement park near home 
which, when I was very young, had a chained bear who lived in fenced enclosure, 
with a large piece of drainage pipe set in the hillside for his hibernations. 
He was thin and threadbare and lived mostly on the bottles of pop which 
tourists threw him and which he could catch, de-cap and chugalug. The diet did 
him no good whatever and, one year when we arrived for the annual school 
picnic, he was gone, dead of the sport we all had with him. 
</P>
<P>
In the subjective style of later documentaries -- a world away from the 
didactic certainties of the March of Time, for example -- "Let's Get Lost" 
tries with considerable success to catch the feeling of Baker's world: the 
larky and kaleidoscopic confusions of lights and movement and boon companions 
and the sweet doing of nothing when you have the spurious feeling the high will 
last forever. 
</P>
<P>
It never does, and "Let's Get Lost" leaves no doubt that it never does. It is 
just that, in viewing the remains of a promising young talent who seemed to 
have the world before him, Weber makes us all voyeurs -- forcing us to look not 
only upon the wasted Baker but into the dark dangers of our own lives. This is 
instructive but unsettling, and it may reflect a miscalculation by Weber on the 
impact his film would have. 
</P>
<P>
It is not a tribute but a sorry requiem.

HOUSTON'S MENIL MUSEUM OPENS ENDOWMENT DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the face of financial woes, Houston's esteemed Menil Collection, a museum 
housing one of the country's finest private art collections, has disclosed a 
$35-million endowment campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Without an endowment, the museum eventually would have to close its doors, said 
Dominique de Menil, the museum's founder and chief patron. 
</P>
<P>
So far, about $26 million toward the endowment has been raised, she said -- 
including her own $17.5 million gift. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-year-old museum, containing 10,000 objects from ancient to contemporary 
times assembled over 40 years by De Menil and her late husband, John, is 
governed by the Menil Foundation, which the couple established in the 1950s. 
The foundation has been the sole supplier of the museum's acquisition 
allowance, which until this year totaled about $1 million annually, and its 
annual operating funds of between $2.7 and $2.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have enough, and the foundation doesn't have enough money" even for 
operating expenses, De Menil told The Times this week. "I could do it for a 
couple of years, but then I'd be completely broke and the Menil Foundation 
would be broke." 
</P>
<P>
The foundation is based mostly on stocks of Schlumberger Ltd., a huge oil field 
services organization founded by Dominique de Menil's father and uncle. It, 
like other Houston ventures, has reportedly suffered because of the oil 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators at the museum, revered particularly for its exceptionally strong 
holdings of 20th-Century art, have spent nothing on acquisitions since 1988, 
according to former director Walter Hopps. He recently resigned from the museum 
in the midst of the money troubles to "pursue an independent curatorial role" 
involving 20th-Century art projects. ZAN DUBIN

PUBLIC RADIO COVERS WORLD BUSINESS FROM LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN FARLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first meeting, Jim Russell, one of the creators of public radio's enduring 
"All Things Considered," seems a bit like a character out of another one-time 
public-radio staple, "A Prairie Home Companion." 
</P>
<P>
Looking comfortable in a plaid shirt and brown slacks, the droll, barrel-shaped 
Russell showed a visitor around the home of his latest venture, saying, "I do 
so not out of a sense of pride but out of a sense of astonishment." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the small-potatoes look of the place: Long Beach radio 
station KLON-FM (88.1), which shares space in a small office complex with the 
Merry Maids cleaning service, among other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Appearances can be deceiving. Russell, 42, has come here to launch American 
Public Radio's first West Coast production center. 
</P>
<P>
The first result of that effort, a half-hour business news show called 
"Marketplace," has been on the air for five months, attracting an impressive 
group of more than 70 regular contributors, including "In Search of Excellence" 
co-author Tom Peters, "Golden Fleece Awards" founder and former Sen. William 
Proxmire and correspondents around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
On many of the 93 public radio stations carrying the show, it runs as a 
companion piece to "All Things Considered." It's aired in all of the 26 largest 
U.S. markets, including four local FM stations -- KLON, which airs it weekdays 
at 6 p.m.; KCRW (89.9) in Santa Monica (weekdays at 3:30 p.m.), and KUSC (91.5) 
in Los Angeles and KCPB (91.1) in Thousand Oaks (weekdays at 5 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
Russell is the creator and executive producer of the program, which is anchored 
by former San Francisco video producer Michael Creedman. 
</P>
<P>
Most nationally broadcast business shows emanate from New York, but APR chose 
Long Beach as the base for "Marketplace" because, APR executive vice president 
Eric Friesen said, "It seemed to us that you in Southern California have a 
better sense of where business is now and in the future than some of our 
Eastern counterparts, who still find it hard to get out of the old mode of 
thinking that business begins and ends on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that we should bring the program to a place where producers as well as 
the business community understand that business is now a globally interlinked 
affair." 
</P>
<P>
That attitude comes naturally to Russell. The son of a CIA agent, he grew up in 
Italy, Greece and Pakistan and later spent time in Vietnam and Cambodia as a 
UPI reporter. As a consequence of all those years spent overseas, he said, he 
tends to look at the United States "through foreign eyes." 
</P>
<P>
He was wooed here from his position as general manager of the innovative 
Minneapolis public television station KTCA, which was doing satellite hook-ups 
with the Soviet Union before glasnost made such undertakings fashionable. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 years in the TV business, Russell said, "There's something very 
refreshing and pure about radio. You don't need a whole lot of fancy stuff." To 
cover the world from Long Beach, he said, "All you need is an editorial 
approach and . . . telephones." 
</P>
<P>
On "Marketplace," that approach is "cultural detective work," Russell said. 
"What are people thinking, how are they acting, and I don't think the American 
(business news) media does a very good job of that at all. They're so busy 
reporting statistics and data." 
</P>
<P>
When a friend asked Russell how he planned to cover the East Coast financial 
markets from Long Beach, he responded that he planned to cover them "like the 
colonies they are." 
</P>
<P>
"I like Apple Computer's saying once that they were the computer for the rest 
of us," he said. "Well, this is the business show for the rest of us. I am not 
interested in doing a business show that aims at CEOs, because they don't need 
me. And if I stultify, if I narrow and give them what they want, everybody else 
gets left out." 
</P>
<P>
To "tap the country," a goal Russell mentions often, "Marketplace" has a daily 
feature focusing on leading business stories in newspapers around the country. 
The show also regularly interviews local newspaper editors. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign coverage, however, is "sort of Point One," in Russell's priorities for 
the show, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A slew of British correspondents, including the senior economic correspondent 
for the BBC World Service, the Asian bureau chief for the Economist, and 
reporters from the Observer and the Financial Times, help anchor various points 
of the world for the show. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign editor George Lewinski, recruited from the Canadian Broadcasting 
System, credited the British media with being "generally more interested in 
foreign news" than the Canadian or U.S. media, which accounts for the 
preponderance of British reporters. 
</P>
<P>
To report on Eastern Europe, "Marketplace" has a former senior correspondent 
for Hungarian state television, along with a Polish national. "I think Eastern 
Europe is very important and totally uncovered (by most media)," Russell said. 
"It's important for us to realize that there is not a monolithic communism." 
</P>
<P>
As for the other shows that Russell was hired to create for APR here, "It's 
wide open and it's not necessarily business or even news," he said. "I'm 
interested in comedy, I'm interested in performance, I'm interested in 
multicultural things. I'm interested in getting stuff going with the 
Australians, the Chinese, the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"And I guess I have what may sound like incredible chutzpah to think that why 
should this small, budding operation be doing that when there are bigger giants 
to do it. And the answer is: They don't seem to want to. They don't seem to 
know how. They seem to be quite satisfied delivering the same old stuff."

NEW 'PASSIVE' PEOPLE METER IN THE WORKS; 
</P>
<P>
NIELSEN DEVELOPING A 'PASSIVE' AUDIENCE-MEASUREMENT SYSTEM 
</P>

Three years from now, a new TV ratings device could be watching you watch 
television. 
</P>
<P>
But it won't be Big Brother time, officials of Nielsen Media Research 
emphasized Wednesday in announcing an agreement with the David Sarnoff Research 
Center to jointly develop and test a new "passive" audience measurement system 
that involves a cameralike device in the subject's home. 
</P>
<P>
"We would use this technology only in households where people had agreed to 
have the technology installed," John A. Dimling, Nielsen executive vice 
president, told a news conference here. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not scanning the room to find out what they're doing," he added, only 
identifying, on a "second-by-second" basis, who is watching what program and 
when. 
</P>
<P>
If the technology, methodology and value for cost proves feasible, he said, the 
new system could start replacing the people-meter ratings technology three 
years from now. 
</P>
<P>
"If everything goes well, that's our goal -- to have a passive system for 
measuring television audiences" that would replace the current system, Dimling 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to say how much the new project will cost. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the three major TV networks said that Nielsen was to outline the 
proposal for them later this week. But their initial response was cool. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the 'if all goes well' is a big if," said Barry Cook, NBC vice 
president for media research. "Because there's a lot more to an audience 
measurement system than a technology." 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen's people-meter system, now used in 4,000 households, became the 
industry standard in the fall of 1987. It is an "active" system in that 
individual viewers must log on by pushing designated buttons on small boxes by 
their TV set. 
</P>
<P>
Costing NBC, CBS and ABC $5 million a year each, the people-meters replaced a 
passive "audimeter" system that simply recorded what programs were being 
viewed. The people-meter system was an effort to measure more precisely the 
numbers and kinds of viewers watching TV. 
</P>
<P>
Its first year of operation resulted in an overall 9% drop in audience size 
that the networks partly attributed to the new technology. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed new "image recognition" system would use a computer and cameralike 
device in each participating household. The facial features of each family 
member or friend would be stored in the computer, officials said. Then, when 
the TV set was turned on, the cameralike device atop the set would start 
scanning the room, identifying who was watching by matching what it sees with 
the stored computer data, and then cataloguing them in Nielsen's national 
tally. 
</P>
<P>
If the camera-computer didn't "recognize" who was watching, it simply would 
record the viewer as a "visitor." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Curtis R. Carlson, a research director at the Sarnoff facility in 
Princeton, N.J., conceded at Wednesday's news conference that much still must 
be worked out with the new system. Asked how the system would differentiate 
between twins, for example, he said, "Twins are hard." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Dimling's assurances that there are no Big Brother aspects to the 
viewer-scanning system, some unease was expressed by network officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We would be uncomfortable with that," said CBS research vice president Michael 
Eisenberg. "But I'd have to hear more about it." 
</P>
<P>
Viewers might also be uncomfortable with it, NBC's Cook noted, saying that if 
the system were used in every room in a house that has a TV set, including the 
bedroom, "people may want to throw a coat over the camera, so to speak." 
</P>
<P>
NBC always has championed passive audience measurement systems that require 
nothing of the viewer, Cook said, but Nielsen's proposal for one that watches 
the viewer watching TV will itself require a long, hard look. 
</P>
<P>
"It remains to be seen whether something which is so potentially invasive as a 
camera -- which identifies you in the room -- is going to change the viewer 
behavior," he said.

2 FIRMS LINKED TO RECRUIT ACCUSED OF DISCRIMINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM SCHACHTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Los Angeles-based companies linked to Recruit, the Tokyo firm at the center 
of a scandal that has rocked Japanese politics, are under investigation by the 
U.S. government on charges that their employee recruitment businesses have 
engaged in "a shocking pattern" of race, age and sex discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, in court documents filed Tuesday, 
alleged that Interplace/Transworld Recruit, a job referral agency partly owned 
by Recruit, used a secret code in internal documents to specify employers' 
preferences for workers of a particular race, sex, national origin or age. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, if an employer only wanted to hire whites between the ages of 30 
and 40, a notation would be placed on a job order that read, "Talk to Mary; 
Suite 30-40," according to an Interplace memo filed in U.S. District Court in 
San Francisco by the commission. If the employer sought a black, the code would 
read, "Talk to Maryanne," the memo says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Memo on IBM 
</P>
<P>
A second memo filed in court describes a meeting between top executives of IBM 
Japan and Recruit U.S.A., the Tokyo firm's U.S. subsidiary. The memo describes 
Recruit's plans for a hiring campaign on behalf of IBM in which non-Asian 
applicants allegedly would be denied consideration. 
</P>
<P>
That April, 1988, memo, written in Japanese, says, "Foreigners, no good -- IBM 
current rule. . . . White people, black people -- NO, but second-generation 
Japanese or others of Asian descent OK." 
</P>
<P>
The commission launched an investigation of the two firms after former 
employees told the San Francisco Chronicle of the alleged practices. In a 
relatively uncommon step taken when the victims of alleged discrimination are 
unknown, the formal charges were filed last week by the commission's vice 
chairman, E. Gaull Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
John Shiner, an attorney in Los Angeles for the Recruit firms, said Wednesday 
that when former employees confronted company officials with charges of 
improper practices, steps were taken to make sure the firms' policies complied 
with U.S. law. Shiner declined to comment on the commission's charges, however, 
saying he had not had time to review the stack of documents filed by the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
IBM has not been publicly charged, and commission lawyers declined to say if 
the computer maker is under investigation. Mac Jeffery, a spokesman in Tokyo 
for IBM Japan, said the firm does not discriminate and that the memo does not 
accurately reflect the instructions IBM gave Recruit. 
</P>
<P>
"At no time in that meeting did we even hint to them we wanted to screen out 
anybody," Jeffery said. Jeffery said there was no indication IBM was a subject 
of the job commission's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restraining Order Obtained 
</P>
<P>
Normally, commission charges and investigations are confidential until action 
is taken against an employer. The charges against the Recruit firms became 
public Tuesday, however, when commission lawyers -- fearful that the companies 
would destroy documents critical to the inquiry -- obtained a restraining order 
from U.S. District Judge Stanley A. Weigel directing Recruit not to alter any 
records or remove them from the country. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and 52 other top officials in Japanese 
government, business and journalism have been forced to resign amid disclosures 
that they accepted millions of dollars in payments from Recruit, a firm that 
began as a tiny job referral agency and became a sprawling information and real 
estate empire. 
</P>
<P>
The company's U.S. operations are far more low key. 
</P>
<P>
Interplace primarily operates in the domestic American market, recruiting 
employees in the United States for American firms. Recruit U.S.A. publishes 
help-wanted magazines in which Japanese and other companies run ads soliciting 
job applications from bilingual Americans interested in working in Japan. For 
an additional fee, the firm also will screen and refer applicants. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to their downtown Los Angeles headquarters, the firms have offices 
in New York and several California cities, including Costa Mesa, Torrance, 
Gardena, San Francisco and San Mateo. 
</P>
<P>
The charges, which could subject the Recruit companies to fines or orders to 
make restitution to job applicants, reflect the employment commission's growing 
attention to the conduct of Japanese firms in the United States.

Agreement on Hiring 
</P>
<P>
The Big Three Japanese car makers -- Nissan, Toyota and Honda -- all have 
agreed in the last two years to alter their hiring practices and give jobs to 
minority applicants following commission investigations. Clarence Thomas, 
chairman of the commission, has declared that the agency will be especially 
vigilant that Japanese firms not try to import to the United States hiring 
practices acceptable under Japan's far weaker discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
However, the kind of activities allegedly engaged in by Interplace and Recruit 
U.S.A. hardly are confined to Japanese personnel agencies. Civil rights lawyers 
long have complained that it is widespread practice for employers to use 
personnel agencies to screen out job applicants on the basis of age, race or 
sex, said Linda J. Krieger, a senior trial attorney for the commission in San 
Francisco.

</P>
<P>
HOW RECRUIT CODED ITS JOB ORDERS 
</P>
<P>
When a company hired Interplace/Transworld Recruit to screen and refer 
potential employees, the job agency allegedly used a code on the job order to 
indicate the client's preferences regarding the age, sex, race and nationality 
of job prospects. The codes, and their meaning, are outlined in an Interplace 
memo disclosed in court by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission:

Leading Edge Products Inc., a maker of IBM-compatible computers that is in 
bankruptcy, said Wednesday that it will be bought by the company that makes 
virtually all its products: Daewoo Telecom Ltd. of South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Under a plan that must be approved by federal bankruptcy court in Boston, 
Daewoo will acquire privately held Leading Edge by assuming its estimated $16 
million in liabilities, said Leading Edge Senior Vice President John Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
The company's dealers, who are the vast majority of its creditors, will be paid 
back in cash within five years. If they choose to be paid in Leading Edge 
products, they will receive full payment within four years. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also allows dealers to accept an immediate settlement of 45 cents in 
cash and product for each dollar owed. Other creditors, mostly suppliers, will 
also receive 45 cents on the dollar, the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said the plan "assures that Leading Edge will continue to be a 
significant player in the personal computer market." 
</P>
<P>
Leading Edge was founded as a distributor of computer peripherals by Michael 
Shane, whose first business success came in the wig and blue jeans industries. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the company marketed the first low-priced "clones" of personal 
computers by International Business Machines Corp., broadening access to the 
powerful machines and related software. 
</P>
<P>
Leading Edge filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code 
in February because of insurmountable cash-flow problems. The company, which 
required its dealers to pay for their orders in advance, was unable to deliver 
the products and suspended shipments. 
</P>
<P>
Leading Edge's headquarters will remain in Canton, Sullivan said. Canton houses 
the company's research, sales, marketing and other operations, although its 
manufacturing facilities are in South Korea.

PHILIP MORRIS IS TESTING A NEW LOW-TAR CIGARETTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, Times Staff Wtiter 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Philip Morris Cos. has begun test marketing a new low-nicotine cigarette 
manufactured with a technological innovation designed to ensure a taste 
virtually identical to standard cigarettes, industry sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The giant food, beverages and tobacco concern is distributing the cigarette -- 
containing about 0.1 milligram of nicotine -- by mail to selected smokers with 
a questionnaire asking if they would buy the product if it were on the market, 
according to Advertising Age, the trade publication that first reported the 
testing program. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris declined comment. A spokeswoman said the company's policy is 
never to comment on new product testing. However, analysts said enough people 
have seen the cigarette -- tentatively called Merit Free and Next from Merit -- 
to confirm the basics of the program. Philip Morris' Merit brand is the 
best-selling low-tar cigarette. It has 0.6 milligram of nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are products on the market with the same low-nicotine content, 
the new Philip Morris program is seen as a move by the company to maintain its 
market share lead in an overall shrinking pool of smokers. It also reflects a 
tacit acknowledgement by cigarette makers that consumers are afraid of 
cigarettes, although the manufacturers are careful not to concede that 
cigarettes are a health problem, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Must Boost Share 
</P>
<P>
With overall domestic cigarette consumption continuing to decline, the name of 
the game for cigarette manufacturers is to come up with innovations that will 
boost their market share, said Lawrence Adelman, an analyst with Dean Witter. 
Philip Morris, the leading cigarette manufacturer with 39.6% of the total 
cigarette market, "is really the only one doing that," he added. 
</P>
<P>
RJR Nabisco attempted to grab the technological prize with its ill-fated 
Premier "smokeless cigarette," which was introduced with a great deal of 
fanfare in 1987 but yanked out of test markets earlier this year. However, 
Philip Morris appears to be moving more slowly with its project and avoiding 
the kind of radical product changes that doomed Premier. Premier, which 
contained a tobacco flavored capsule, ultimately failed because consumers 
didn't like the taste. And RJR also drew a lot of unfavorable publicity by 
designing a product that anti-smoking groups seized upon as a "drug-delivery 
device" and pressured the Food and Drug Administration to regulate. 
</P>
<P>
While cigarette smoking is declining overall, there has been a shift among 
brands, particularly benefiting the low-tar, low-nicotine products, said Dave 
Stewart, a professor of marketing at the University of Southern California. 
"Any cigarette that is perceived as healthier will pull from those brands," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Such a cigarette wouldn't be a general market product but would appeal to 
smokers who would like to quit smoking because they are concerned about their 
health yet have not been able to kick the habit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how sizable that market is, but it could be 20% to 25% of 
smokers," Stewart said. But, he added, the key for Philip Morris is to deliver 
on the promise of a technological innovation that will both produce the lowest 
level of nicotine and provide the taste that will appeal to smokers. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris, reportedly, has modified the process its General Foods USA 
subsidiary uses to decaffeinate coffee. The company is said to have been 
working on the project since 1985 when it acquired General Foods, which 
manufactures Maxwell House coffee. 
</P>
<P>
The low-nicotine cigarettes currently on the market use methods such as highly 
porous paper and special filters to reduce the tar and nicotine content, 
industry sources said. But the process changes the taste of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
The basic coffee decaffeination process is some form of a cold water 
extraction, aided by certain chemicals -- commonly methylene chloride and ethyl 
acetate. The chemicals bond with the caffeine in the beans and extract it 
without changing the taste. 
</P>
<P>
If the process is successful with the proposed new Merit line, Philip Morris is 
expected to reduce nicotine in other brands, including Marlboro, the leading 
brand with a 25% market share. 
</P>
<P>
Although reports about the Philip Morris project attracted attention, industry 
analysts tempered their enthusiasm. "It's in the concept testing stage. There 
is a lot to be explored here," said Diana K. Temple, an analyst with Salomon 
Brothers in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not making too much of it," Adelman said. "I think it's just a probe. 
There are other (similar) products on the market. They may have a better 
version of it (the low-nicotine cigarette). But Philip Morris is doing a lot of 
interesting things. They just introduced a new Marlboro ultra low-tar product. 
I think this is a function of Philip Morris becoming even more dominant in the 
market," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Although Philip Morris appears to be moving cautiously with its tests, any 
cigarette marketing innovation is bound to have its detractors. Health 
officials and anti-smoking groups haven't tempered their criticisms of low-tar 
and low-nicotine cigarettes, and vigorously contest any perception that they 
are safer. 
</P>
<P>
"Health-wise, it won't provide huge benefits because cigarettes have tar and 
carbon monoxide and a lot of other things that cause cancer. The chief effect 
will be to make these cigarettes less addictive," said Dr. Ronald Davis, 
director of the U.S. Office on Smoking and Health. 
</P>
<P>
Some health officials even argue that low-nicotine cigarettes are more 
threatening because smokers tend to smoke more to get the same "nicotine rush," 
said Joe Tye, president of Stop Teen-age Addiction to Tobacco.

NWA DISCLOSES CHECCHI, UNION ALSO MADE BIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines, has received takeover offers from 
Los Angeles financier Alfred A. Checchi and from Northwest's machinists union, 
bringing the number of known bidders to four. 
</P>
<P>
Details about the bids were not disclosed. As previously reported, NWA has also 
received bids from Pan Am Corp. and Los Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis. 
</P>
<P>
NWA, based in Eagan, Minn., is the fourth-largest U.S. airline and has a strong 
Pacific route system and valuable real estate in Japan. It has been for sale 
since late March, when Davis offered $90 a share for the company. In rejecting 
Davis' offer, NWA said it would explore alternatives for the company -- 
including a sale -- to enhance "shareholder value." 
</P>
<P>
NWA shares closed Wednesday at $107.375, up 12.5 cents in trading on the New 
York Stock Exchange. At that price, NWA would cost about $3.2 billion to 
acquire. 
</P>
<P>
In a press release, International Assn. of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers 
District 143 said it made a "proposal" concerning the airline to NWA's board. 
The union said its proposal would reward shareholders while "providing 
increased level of security to employees, consumers and the communities in 
which Northwest operates." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Line's Largest Union 
</P>
<P>
Jim Conley, a spokesman for the machinists in Washington, said he could not 
provide details about the proposal but that it is a "buyout proposal." In the 
past, the machinists have said they might finance an offer with borrowed funds 
and with savings from reduced labor costs. 
</P>
<P>
With 22,000 members employed by Northwest, the machinists are the airline's 
largest union. It was not clear Wednesday whether the airline's other unionized 
workers would support the machinists' bid. Kirk Faupol, co-chairman of 
Northwest's 5,000-member pilots union, said pilots are not inclined to give 
concessions. "We're not looking for wage cuts, regardless of whether there's 
employee ownership involved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The machinists union has tried to buy an airline only once before. In 1985, the 
machinists, along with pilots and flight attendants, offered to buy Eastern 
Airlines. But the employee group was outbid by Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of 
Texas Air, which acquired Eastern in 1986. Strikebound Eastern is now involved 
in bankruptcy proceedings.

The owner of the historic ferry fleet that shuttles tourists to San Francisco 
Bay's famed Alcatraz island said Wednesday that it agreed to sell the business 
to an archrival boating company owned by Pier 39. 
</P>
<P>
Crowley Maritime Corp. said it has agreed to sell the Red &amp; White Fleet to 
the Blue &amp; Gold Fleet for an undisclosed price. 
</P>
<P>
The Red &amp; White's ferryboats, a familiar sight on the bay since the 1930s, 
will be repainted with the colors of the Blue &amp; Gold. 
</P>
<P>
The sale represents a symbolic victory for UC Berkeley over its own rival, 
Stanford University, across the bay. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue &amp; Gold Fleet, started in 1979, was reportedly named after the 
school colors at Berkeley.

MUTUAL QUITS S&amp;L TRADE GROUP TO PROTEST STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pasadena-based Mutual Savings &amp; Loan Assn. has withdrawn from an industry 
trade group to protest the organization's lobbying stand on S&amp;L bailout 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The trade group -- the U.S. League of Savings Institutions -- has been trying 
to persuade Congress to ease some of the tougher new capital standards 
contained in a bill designed to save crippled S&amp;Ls. In a letter to the 
league Tuesday, Mutual Savings Chairman Charles T. Munger said his institution 
was leaving because it objects to those efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not unfair," the letter said, "to liken the situation now facing 
Congress to cancer and to liken the league to a significant carcinogenic agent. 
. . . In the face of a national disaster which league lobbying plainly helped 
cause, the league obdurately persists in prescribing continuation of loose 
accounting principles, inadequate capital and, in effect, inadequate management 
at many insured institutions." 
</P>
<P>
Current regulations require S&amp;Ls to maintain capital reserves equal to 
slightly more than 3% of outstanding loans, but they allow savings institutions 
to count intangible assets -- known as "goodwill" -- as part of the reserves. 
The Washington-based league objects to a legislative provision requiring 
institutions to replace all goodwill assets with cash over a five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Mutual Savings timed its announcement to register its concern over a recent 
17-17 tie vote in the House Judiciary Committee on an amendment to weaken the 
proposed goodwill provision, said Warren E. Buffett, chairman of Omaha-based 
Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a holding company that owns Mutual Savings' parent 
company. Mutual Savings ranks 70th in assets among California S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
"The lobbying effort nearly created a vote . . . that would have taken all the 
teeth out of the legislation," Buffett said. 
</P>
<P>
James Grohl, a senior vice president of the league, said his association 
supports alternative methods of meeting higher capital requirements. He said 
most of the trade group's 2,800 members support the association's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"They (members) all have points of view, and it's impossible for us to meet the 
expectations of every single element," he said. "We can't please everyone."

Demand for Labor Up: Demand for labor as measured by the volume of help-wanted 
advertising increased slightly during April. The Conference Board, a business 
research organization, said its monthly help-wanted advertising index rose to 
157 in April from 151 in March. The index tracks the volume of classified 
advertising in 51 major American newspapers and is considered sensitive to 
changes in demand for labor and general business conditions.

Columnist Jerry Nachman has been named editor of the New York Post, replacing 
Jane Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
Nachman, 43, also was made vice president of the New York Post Co. and was 
expected to be elected to the newspaper's board, owner Peter Kalikow said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
A 24-year veteran of the news business, Nachman became a Post columnist in 
early 1988 after spending most of his career in broadcasting in New York, San 
Francisco and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Kalikow announced Tuesday that he was relieving Amsterdam of her duties after a 
year on the job, praising her work but saying the tabloid "has new heights to 
achieve to assure its future strength and success." 
</P>
<P>
Amsterdam departed with the reduction of the Post's new Sunday edition, whose 
originator, Peter Price, resigned earlier as publisher.

Stocks seesawed Wednesday but ended mostly higher, supported by a late recovery 
in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 4.60 to close at 2,480.15. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by a margin of about 8 to 5 in nationwide 
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 896 up, 558 down and 505 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
After a weak opening, stocks rebounded following a government report that its 
chief economic forecasting gauge shot up 0.8% in April. The index of leading 
economic indicators had declined during the previous two months and economists 
had warned that a third consecutive decline would signal a recession. 
</P>
<P>
The market quickly lost ground, however, as the dollar slipped and bonds 
declined following a second report from the Commerce Department that showed 
orders to U.S. factories rose 2.7% in April, the best showing in four months. 
</P>
<P>
That report indicated that the economy is still going strong, prompting 
speculation that the Federal Reserve might not loosen its hold on interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
The impact was brief, though, as fear of Fed tightening faded and the dollar 
recovered from earlier sluggishness, lifting bond prices and inciting some late 
afternoon buying on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
Late word that the West German Bundesbank might not raise its discount rate 
also firmed prices before a last-minute selling spree eliminated much of the 
gains in the final minutes of trading. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 162.53 million shares, up from 
151.78 million shares Tuesday.

139 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
Time Inc. tumbled 8 to 127. It had risen sharply over the last couple of weeks 
on speculation that a bidder would emerge to derail its planned merger with 
Warner Communications, but no bidder turned up. Warner rose 7/8 to 51 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo stock market bounded to a record close, helped by speculation that 
Japanese workers will invest some of their hefty midyear bonuses in stock, 
brokers said. The key 225-share Nikkei index climbed 189.86 to end at a record 
34,266.75. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices closed substantially lower on the London Stock Exchange, pressured 
by an early round of selling related to program trades and by further upward 
pressure on interest rates as the British pound continued to slump. The 
Financial Times 100-share index fell 15.6 to close at 2,114.4. 
</P>
<P>
Dollar 
</P>
<P>
The dollar slumped amid speculation about central bank maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
There were rumors that the Federal Reserve and possibly other central banks 
were selling dollars more discreetly than they have in the past. 
</P>
<P>
During most of the dollar's recent run-up, the central banks tried to gain 
extra psychological impact by allowing their market interventions to become 
public. That strategy did not appear to work. 
</P>
<P>
Several times Wednesday the dollar appeared to be under downward pressure even 
though dealers could not pinpoint anyone who was selling, said Jerry Egan, 
chief currency dealer for Bank of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The lone currency against which the dollar rose in New York was the Japanese 
yen. In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the 
dollar fell 0.40 yen to a closing 142.70 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted 
at 142.30 yen. In New York, the dollar rose to 142.90 yen from 142.75. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $1.5682 to buy 
one pound, more expensive than $1.5570 late Tuesday. In New York, the pound 
rose to $1.5735 from $1.5710. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices fell in New York after having been up in Asia and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, gold rose $1.95 an ounce to a bid of $364.68. 
</P>
<P>
Gold rose in London to a late bid of $363.50, compared to $362.25 late Tuesday. 
In Zurich, Switzerland, gold rose to $363.43 from $362.10. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Coffee futures prices fell on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange 
amid growing pessimism about next week's special meeting of the International 
Coffee Organization. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, precious metals slid, grains and soybeans were mostly lower, 
energy futures were mixed, cattle futures were mixed and pork futures advanced. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee settled 2 cents to 4.08 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in 
July at $1.3068 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
The selloff was prompted by a report that John Rosenbaum, the U.S. chief 
delegate to the International Coffee Organization, remained determined not to 
attend the talks in London unless coffee producers first offer a proposal 
acceptable to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The five-day meeting of most of the world's largest coffee-producing and 
coffee-consuming nations is aimed at producing a new International Coffee 
Agreement to replace the six-year pact that expires Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, the organization's largest consumer member, is resisting a 
push to simply extend the existing agreement, calling instead for tighter 
restrictions on sales of coffee at discount prices to countries that are not 
members of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say the odds for an agreement are 50-50, and it's unlikely that anything 
will be hammered out until it comes down to the wire in September," said Sandra 
Kaul, a market analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Arthur Stevenson of Prudential-Bache Securities in New York said the 
selling was also a reflection of the mild weather in Brazil, the world's 
largest coffee producer, at the beginning of the South American winter season. 
</P>
<P>
"The market will be increasingly trading off the weather in Brazil," Stevenson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most grain and soybean futures prices retreated on the Chicago Board of Trade 
as forecasts for more rain in the Corn Belt quieted fears of a second year of 
drought. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil futures prices notched lower while futures prices for refined 
products ended mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange in choppy activity 
fueled by conflicting statements from various ministers of the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries regarding oil production and demand. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices rebounded in late trading as a Federal Reserve staff report fueled 
investor optimism that inflation would moderate. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 5/16 point, or more than $3 per 
$1,000 face amount, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from 
its price, fell to 8.60% from 8.62% on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 11%, up from 9.75% late Tuesday. The jump was attributed to technical 
factors.

AMGEN STOCK RISES SHARPLY ON FDA RUMOR

Amgen's stock climbed Wednesday in heavy trading on rumors that the Thousand 
Oaks biotechnology company would receive Food and Drug Administration approval 
today to sell its promising anti-anemia drug erythropoietin. 
</P>
<P>
Amgen's stock rose $1.625 to close at $40.125 on volume of 462,000 shares 
traded on the NASDAQ System. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have estimated the eventual size of the domestic market for EPO at 
$450 million to more than $1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Bock, biotechnology analyst for Sutro &amp; Co., said the widespread 
rumor Wednesday was that FDA approval of EPO was imminent and "judging by the 
price action on Amgen, that's what is most likely." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Engaged in Race 
</P>
<P>
Amgen Chief Executive Gordon Binder said the FDA has called a press conference 
today to announce its approval of a new drug. Binder would not comment on 
whether EPO would be approved for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Binder did say that both Amgen and FDA officials "have been working very hard, 
including over the holiday weekend." EPO is Amgen's first commercial drug. 
</P>
<P>
Amgen is in a race with Chugai-Upjohn, a Chicago biotechnology rival that has 
submitted its own EPO application to the FDA.

HIKE IN KEY U.S. INDEX EASES RECESSION FEARS

<P>
The government's chief economic forecasting gauge jumped 0.8% in April, the 
Commerce Department reported Wednesday, easing fears that the nation might be 
about to tumble into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in the index of leading economic indicators followed declines of 
0.3% in February and 0.6% in March. Three consecutive monthly declines have 
traditionally been a signal of a possible recession on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe there will be a slowdown that is gradually occurring in the 
economy, but it's not going to ultimately end in a recession," said economist 
John Hagens of the WEFA Group in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. "It was a bit too premature 
to call for a recession later this year based on the data in February and 
March." 
</P>
<P>
Still, analysts were not suggesting that the strong numbers for April meant a 
robust economy this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York said the report 
suggests that although there "was a bit of a rebound in April from March, the 
general story about the economy is that it is slowing down and slowing 
dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
Although a three-month drop in the index has preceded all eight recessions 
since 1948, there have also been five similar series of declines -- including 
the five consecutive months surrounding the stock market crash in October, 1987 
-- that were not followed by recessions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fairly Steady Slowing 
</P>
<P>
The index of leading indicators is designed to foretell economic activity six 
to nine months in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Brusca, an economist with Nikko Securities Co. International in New 
York, said recent reports show that "the economy is confused, somewhere between 
boom and bust." 
</P>
<P>
But he noted that over the past six months "there's been some pretty steady 
decelerating in the growth of the index." 
</P>
<P>
Commerce reported that the leading indicators rose 1.3% over the past six 
months, compared to 1.7% in the previous half-year. 
</P>
<P>
The April report showed that eight of the 11 indicators in the index rose, led 
by increased manufacturers' orders for consumer goods, increased building 
permits and a longer average workweek. 
</P>
<P>
Other pluses were higher stock prices, lower initial claims for jobless 
benefits, slower vendor deliveries (meaning growing demand), more orders for 
plants and equipment and an increase in manufacturers' unfilled orders. 
</P>
<P>
On the minus side were the third consecutive drop in an index measuring 
consumer confidence, a drop in the money supply and lower prices for sensitive 
materials, indicating slower demand. 
</P>
<P>
Hagens said he was closely watching the consumer confidence index. 
</P>
<P>
"That has been a fairly good leading indicator on its own of a recession," he 
said. "It hasn't dropped nearly enough to indicate that a recession is coming, 
but if it dropped dramatically over the next three or four months, we would be 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heading for Soft Landing 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Hagens concludes that the "economy is in a slowing mode," heading for 
a soft landing with growth over the next year of 1.5%. Growth in the gross 
national product for the first three months of 1989, with the statistical 
rebound from last year's drought removed, was 1.8%. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, also sees 
"a soft landing -- continued but subdued growth." 
</P>
<P>
A soft landing, rather than a recession, is what the Federal Reserve hopes to 
achieve in its effort to contain inflation by tightening credit. 
</P>
<P>
William K. MacReynolds, U.S. Chamber of Commerce forecasting director, said he 
believes that "it would be a mistake to interpret April's uptick . . . as an 
indication that the economy is in good shape." 
</P>
<P>
"Persistent declines in the money supply . . . are a harbinger of a more 
dramatic slowdown than most analysts expect," he said. "Historically, a falling 
money supply has led to a large decline in overall economic growth." 
</P>
<P>
The drop in the money supply in April was the fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The April index of leading economic indicators stood at 145.7% of its 1982 base 
of 100.

PACIFIC BELL PLANS REFUND FOR ITS UNPUSHED BUTTONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pacific Bell said Wednesday that 112,000 rural customers who were charged extra 
for push-button telephone service that the company never provided will receive 
credits averaging $42 on their phone bills this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The credits stem from a $5-million settlement the California Public Utilities 
Commission approved last week in a closed-door "executive session." 
</P>
<P>
The settlement culminated a three-year effort by George Sawaya of rural Pollock 
Pines in the Sierra foothills east of Sacramento, who said he was induced by a 
Pacific Bell mailing to sign up, at extra cost, for "Touch Tone" service so his 
calls would be completed faster. He noticed no difference in service, however, 
and later learned that Pacific Bell's local telephone switch was not equipped 
to provide the service. Although he obtained an immediate refund, Sawaya filed 
a class-action complaint on behalf of other customers who paid extra for 
service that was never provided. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell spokeswoman Kathleen Flynn said the company expects to submit 
details of the refund plan this month. She called the billing problems "an 
oversight." 
</P>
<P>
PUC Deputy Counsel Michael Day said the commission considered Pacific Bell's 
action an unintended mistake stemming from commission-approved rate changes 
intended to compensate the company for upgrading its switching equipment 
throughout much of the state.

HUGHES TO CUT 6,000 JOBS AS DEFENSE SLOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hughes Aircraft will eliminate 6,000 jobs over the next six months in response 
to anticipated federal defense spending reductions and in an effort to improve 
its competitiveness, the Los Angeles aerospace firm announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the cutbacks will occur in Southern California, where 84% of Hughes' 
75,000 workers are located. Hughes is the largest private employer in Orange 
County with 13,700 people working at five operations. 
</P>
<P>
Although the exact burden of cuts has not been apportioned among the dozens of 
Hughes facilities, some operations facing difficult market conditions are 
likely to bear the brunt of the reductions, including the company's industrial 
electronics, airborne radar and optical sensor businesses in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes President Donald H. White said in an interview that the company expects 
most of the 6,000 job cuts to be accomplished through normal job turnover and 
early retirement but that involuntary layoffs will be necessary in some cases. 
Attrition accounts for as many as 7,500 job vacancies at Hughes each year, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hughes cuts are the latest signal that federal defense budget reductions 
are likely to have broad impact across the industry and especially in Southern 
California. Only last week, Northrop announced a plan to cut 3,000 workers, and 
similar layoffs have occurred recently at Lockheed, General Dynamics, Litton 
Industries and TRW, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cutbacks so far have not been as drastic as in past aerospace 
downturns, they appear to be only the beginning of a protracted and painful 
slowdown that will continue at least through the mid-1990s. The slump should be 
moderated, however, by continued strength in commercial aircraft production. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes has already been cutting back employment in recent years in an effort to 
cut costs. Employment peaked at more than 80,000 in 1985, even though the 
company has increased its sales since then. 
</P>
<P>
"We have two things going on at once," White said. "In some areas we have 
downsizing going on because the amount of business is dropping off some. And 
everywhere, we have some streamlining, which is going to result in some 
reductions. And that's to improve our competitiveness." 
</P>
<P>
White added: "As there is less business around, there are going to be tougher 
fights for it. And so we really have got to be very, very competitive to win 
it. That is what we have been working on for some time, and now we are 
accelerating." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes will attempt to moderate the effect of the job cuts on employees with a 
special incentive retirement program, according to employees interviewed by The 
Times. That program offers employees one week of pay for each year of service 
or a monthly annuity plan that would allow workers to retire up to three years 
early. 
</P>
<P>
White said the cutbacks will affect all types of employees, including hourly 
production workers, engineers, managers and clerical workers. Since 75% of 
Hughes workers are salaried, numerically the cuts will be heaviest there. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to cut our middle management bulge," one missile engineer who 
requested anonymity said Wednesday after attending a company briefing about the 
job cutbacks. "I've been saying for years that we have too many middle 
managers." 
</P>
<P>
Gustavo A. Vargas, a marketing management professor at Cal State Fullerton, 
said the Orange County economy should be able to absorb the job loss, but those 
people who are laid off may have to hunt four to six months for a job that will 
probably pay less. Vargas said defense firms pay workers up to 20% more than 
other employers. 
</P>
<P>
The Hughes job losses are not the direct result of any specific funding cuts by 
the Pentagon, White said, but are being made in expectation that proposed 
cutbacks will eventually occur. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has proposed 
major program reductions that would affect Hughes, but those cuts await 
congressional approval and would not be felt for several years. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview early this month, Hughes Chairman Malcolm R. Currie said the 
Cheney cuts for the fiscal 1990 budget would affect $1.5 billion worth of 
Hughes business. While not all of that represents lost business, a large amount 
of it has been thrown into uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them (weapons programs) are stretched out, some of them are reduced 
and some of them are being cut (totally)," he said. "It is going to hit us 
across the company, but not in a drastic way." 
</P>
<P>
Since Hughes' $7.4 billion in 1988 sales was made up mostly of relatively small 
electronics programs, the budget cuts are having a broad effect across the 
company. One major concern, however, is the status of radar for the B-2 Stealth 
bomber program. Cheney proposes to stretch out the bomber program by at least 
one year, and that could result in a reduction of the 1,500-member work force 
Hughes has on that program, Currie said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time that it is responding to specific budget cuts, Hughes is 
seeking to reduce its overall costs, which it has long recognized as being too 
high. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes enjoyed explosive growth in the early 1980s, based on a significant 
technological lead over its competitors. It won a series of major contracts, in 
which it became the dominant producer of airborne radar, missiles, commercial 
satellites and air defense systems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pentagon Cost-Cutting 
</P>
<P>
But more recently, the Pentagon has sought to drive down costs by setting up 
competitions among contractors that have emphasized price rather than 
technology. And Hughes' high costs have resulted in a decline in the rate at 
which it has won new contracts. In many cases, it is being outbid by 
competitors in businesses that it has monopolized for decades. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been winning the big contracts," an engineer at the company said, 
asking that his name not be published. "It looks like all the big ones are 
going to other companies." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest Hughes operation in Orange County is the Ground Systems Group in 
Fullerton, which employs 10,600 people. The group manufactures radar and 
electronic warfare systems, weapon control displays, anti-submarine warfare 
systems, Navy torpedo guidance systems and Army and Marine Corps battlefield 
communication systems. 
</P>
<P>
White said the Ground Systems Group has a fairly stable business base, meaning 
that it would not absorb a disproportionate share of the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Other Hughes operations in Orange County are: 
</P>
<P>
* Connecting Devices Division in Irvine, which employs 600 people to make 
cables and connectors. 
</P>
<P>
* Microelectronics Circuits Division and Microelectronics Center in Newport 
Beach, which employ 1,600 people to make hybrid microcircuits and radio 
frequency circuits and design semiconductor components. 
</P>
<P>
* Microelectronic Systems Division in Rancho Santa Margarita, which employs 900 
people to manufacture audio distribution systems, switching systems and avionic 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
White said the company will probably cut its research and development spending, 
which amounted to $276 million in 1988. It will also cut its spending to 
develop bids and proposals for new contracts, a measure of the effort put into 
winning new contracts. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the cuts would not sacrifice future growth for short-term profits.

JURY CRITICIZES COUNTY'S LAX OVERSIGHT OF LEGAL COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM and ANDREA FORD, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Grand Jury charged Wednesday that the county counsel's office 
has failed to adequately review millions of dollars in billings from private 
lawyers hired by the county and does not keep track of their hours and 
caseloads. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury said the county relies so much on outside legal help that 
officials are spending more on private attorneys than on the entire county 
counsel's office, which has a $4.1-million budget for fiscal 1988-89. So far 
this fiscal year, which ends June 30, the county has paid $4.5 million in fees 
to outside lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
In a report issued after a four-month review of the county's in-house legal 
department, the grand jury also questioned the use of "open-ended contracts" 
when hiring outside law firms for county work. In one instance, the grand jury 
said, a private firm was retained in February, 1985, in a dispute with a 
contractor; the cost of necessary legal work was estimated at $75,000. The case 
has yet to be resolved, and the Century City firm of Wickwire, Gavin &amp; 
Gibbs has been paid more than $650,000 to represent the county. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Board of Supervisors regularly appropriated payments to the firm, 
the grand jury's report says the counsel's office does not have a program for 
evaluating the "progress and effectiveness" of work by those or any other 
outside attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"This signified the need for increased management overview of outside 
contracts," says the 26-page report, prepared by the accounting firm of Arthur 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
"Some activities in that office are little loose," said Joann Cox, a grand jury 
member who chaired the review of the county counsel's office. "It is our 
conclusion that things need some tightening." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, the grand jury, among other things, recommended that: 
</P>
<P>
* The county counsel develop an inventory of all outside legal contracts to be 
monitored and reviewed by the department's lead attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
* A ban be imposed on all open-ended contracts, which rarely have limitations 
on total fees or termination dates. 
</P>
<P>
* The Board of Supervisors develop a long-range strategy for strengthening its 
own legal staff rather than spending more money on outside attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
County Counsel Adrian Kuyper acknowledged some of the criticisms Wednesday and 
blamed part of the problem on his department's heavy workload. He said his 
office must rely on outside legal assistance to cover the myriad complex legal 
issues confronting the county. Kuyper's 74-member staff includes 39 attorneys. 
For his office to closely monitor all private attorneys working for the county, 
as suggested by the grand jury, would be nearly impossible, Kuyper said. 
</P>
<P>
All monetary claims against the county, including minor personal injury 
lawsuits, are automatically sent outside, Kuyper said. Kuyper said his staff 
could handle many of those cases, but they are now sent to the risk management 
office and never reach the county counsel. 
</P>
<P>
"A great variety of outside counsel is hired to work with various county 
departments," Kuyper said. "For someone from my office to attend all the 
meetings, depositions and hearings just to make sure those attorneys are 
putting in their time is unrealistic. We do go over the bills as best we can. 
</P>
<P>
"But at some point you have to have a lot of faith and trust that they are 
doing what they say they are doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury also found that the county lacks any policy as to how private 
law firms should be selected. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, according to the report, county departments have retained 
outside legal assistance without consulting Kuyper, the chief lawyer for the 
supervisors and county departments. In other cases, the report says, no one 
bothered to find out if the counsel's staff could do the work itself, thereby 
saving taxpayer money. 
</P>
<P>
Only twice, according to the report, has the Board of Supervisors asked to see 
a list of firms the county uses before it approved a firm recommended by a 
department or Kuyper. 
</P>
<P>
Kuyper said Wednesday that his office chooses firms whose work he is familiar 
with. Other departments make their choices on the same basis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
To reduce dependency on outside attorneys and trim the county's annual legal 
bill, the grand jury recommended that the counsel's office be expanded. It 
recommended that the county administrative office initiate a study to examine 
if any savings might result from adding more lawyers to Kuyper's staff to 
handle matters now parceled out to private attorneys. Kuyper said he would 
welcome such a move. "It is definitely worthy of a study to determine whether 
it is economically sound," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the hiring of outside attorneys is a lack of depth and expertise 
among attorneys in Kuyper's office, the grand jury report says. Grand juror Cox 
said the county counsel's office hires too many attorneys "straight out of law 
school," who lack seasoning and experience in dealing with complex issues, such 
as land-use. Cox said the county should consider an "in-house" training program 
to help educate and brief its own attorneys on such matters. 
</P>
<P>
A recent case in point involved John C. Funk, a specialist in environmental 
law. Funk, a private attorney who served as a county legal consultant for 
nearly three years, was forced to resign earlier this year because he also 
represented the Irvine Co. Funk, who was paid about $85,000, prepared 
environmental documents for the county on the proposed Gypsum Canyon jail site, 
a parcel owned by the Irvine Co. Because of his intimate knowledge of the 
Gypsum Canyon jail issue and environmental law in general, Funk's departure was 
viewed as a significant setback because there was no one on the county 
counsel's staff adequately qualified to immediately take over the job. 
</P>
<P>
One of the items Kuyper said he will be seeking in next year's budget is 
funding for an environmental law expert on his staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I have often wondered whether we need to do more in-house work, particularly 
on land-use matters like development agreements," Supervisor Don R. Roth said. 
"It has been my contention that we could do some of it at less cost." 
</P>
<P>
One of the law firms mentioned in the grand jury report -- Los Angeles-based 
Nossaman, Guthner, Knox &amp; Elliott -- has been under scrutiny by the 
county's two tollway agencies for racking up more than $1.2 million in legal 
bills in the last 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
John Meyer, executive director of the tollway agencies, is considering a 
proposal to hire a salaried staff attorney to take over some routine legal work 
now handled by the Nossaman firm. 
</P>
<P>
The same law firm has been the subject of recent controversy for representing 
several developers potentially affected by county decisions on highway and 
tollway financing. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the firm, however, have denied any wrongdoing. A two-man tollway 
board committee assigned to review the Nossaman firm's legal work concluded 
earlier this year that it could find nothing improper about its billings but 
suggested that some money could be saved by hiring a staff attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury reviewed county contracts held by 26 firms, according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 11 names that appear on a list showing firms that merely advise county 
officials as opposed to representing them in court, seven are contributors to 
the political campaigns of county supervisors and one -- Paul, Hastings, 
Janofsky &amp; Walker, of which John Funk is a member -- operates a political 
action committee that is a major contributor to Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder. 
</P>
<P>
Of 15 firms that have handled litigation for the county, four have made 
contributions to supervisors' campaigns.

SOURCE OF NOXIOUS FUMES STYMIES SCHOOL OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
School officials Wednesday were still unable to determine the source of noxious 
fumes that prompted an elementary school to evacuate 107 students after some 
children and teachers suffered headaches and itching eyes and became nauseated. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Crawford, director of maintenance and operations for the Capistrano Unified 
School District, said an inspection crew from Southern California Gas Co. 
returned to San Juan Elementary School on Wednesday to check for any potential 
leaks in the facility's main gas line. None was found, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The previous day, Crawford said, the possibility that the complaints could have 
been caused by malfunctioning heaters had been ruled out after the heaters had 
been inspected by district maintenance personnel and gas company workers. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford said gas at the school, which was shut off Tuesday, has been turned on 
again. On Wednesday, all students returned to their classrooms. The children 
who had felt ill, he said, have recovered. 
</P>
<P>
But as a precaution, Crawford said, he will have the classrooms inspected for 
unusual odors every morning for the next two to three weeks.

TRAIN SLAMS INTO TRUCK; MAN IN STABLE CONDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Garden Grove man was listed in stable condition Wednesday after the pickup 
truck he was driving was hit broadside by a passenger train, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Railroad crossing gates had been lowered and a half-dozen cars had already 
stopped at the intersection at 400 W. Walnut St., when Guadalupe Palma, 27, 
drove past the cars, around the arms of the gate and onto the tracks, said Timm 
Browne, a spokesman for the Orange Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-car Amtrak train, northbound from San Diego to Los Angeles, struck 
Palma's 1988 Ford pickup truck at 6:48 p.m, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
Palma was taken to Western Medical Center in Santa Ana where he was listed in 
stable condition. The truck was destroyed, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was obviously very fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
Palma may have escaped death because the train was traveling at the relatively 
slow speed of 35 m.p.h. and hit the truck behind the cab on the side away from 
the driver, he said.

MARINES FACE CHARGES IN $400,000 CONDO FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charges will be filed against two Marines for their alleged involvement in a 
May 21 fire that caused $400,000 worth of damage to four condos at 15712 
Pasadena Ave. in Tustin, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation by the Orange County Fire Department and the Tustin Police 
Department turned up the suspects, who were identified as Pfc. Charles G. 
Simpson, 19, and Pvt. Donald Wasp, 19, both of El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
They will be charged by the district attorney with discharging military-type 
flares and recklessly causing a fire, according to Kathleen Cha, a County Fire 
Department spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
The flares set the roof of the condos afire, Cha said, and ignited five palm 
trees, as well as blistering the paint and blackening wood shingles on 
surrounding condos.

ANAHEIM MAN FACES POSSIBLE DEATH PENALTY IN WIFE-KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONN JOHNSTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Anaheim man who fled to Montana and then confessed to his wife's slaying in 
a letter may face the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
In a complaint added Wednesday to the first-degree murder charge against David 
Lee Schoenecker, prosecutors allege that the 48-year-old chemical engineer 
plotted his wife's death. Schoenecker is now accused of "lying in wait" to 
shoot his wife in the head at their Anaheim Hills home on May 5. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Kazuharu Makino Wednesday ordered Schoenecker held in jail 
without bail until his June 13 arraignment, when he will enter a plea to the 
slaying of Gail Schoenecker, 40. 
</P>
<P>
His attorney says Schoenecker will plead not guilty. The arraignment on 
Wednesday was continued to June 13 because the defense needs more time to 
consider the latest allegation, said Ronald Butler, a public defender. 
</P>
<P>
"This takes it to the death penalty," Butler said after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Melvin L. Jensen, who is prosecuting the case, said the 
"special circumstance" complaint against Schoenecker means that, if convicted, 
he may face the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
Jensen declined to say what led prosecutors to file the new complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Butler said that his client, Schoenecker, did not seem depressed about the 
latest developments in his case Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"So far he's OK," Butler said. "The situation he's in, he's never been in 
before. It's not a good experience." 
</P>
<P>
Schoenecker appeared only briefly at the Municipal Court in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter postmarked early last month from Missoula, Mont., Schoenecker wrote 
to an Orange County Register newspaper columnist saying that he had killed his 
wife. He threatened in the letter to "punish" 54 relatives and acquaintances 
named in a list. Police then went to the home and found the body. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenecker was captured days later by a posse of sheriff's deputies in 
snowmobiles and a helicopter as he tried to escape through rugged mountains 
near Superior, Mont. He was brought back to Orange County May 16 after waiving 
extradition.

AT WITT'S END, ANGELS BEATEN BY BREWERS, 4-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MILWAUKEE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
June is supposed to be Mike Witt's month, so at least the calendar is finally 
on his side. April and May wanted nothing to do with Witt, the Angels' 
erstwhile ace, who has spent most of the great California pitching revival of 
1989 with his nose pressed against the glass. 
</P>
<P>
Witt lost again Wednesday, falling to the Milwaukee Brewers, 4-1, before a 
County Stadium crowd of 14,129. He gave up a three-run homer to Greg Brock on 
Brock's first day off the disabled list, walked five and yielded three doubles, 
including two in as many at-bats to Paul Molitor. 
</P>
<P>
Witt's record is 3-5, the only losing mark in the Angel rotation. His 
earned-run average is 4.42, highest on the Angel staff. The Angels are 
streaking -- winning 23 of their last 30 games -- but Witt has been left 
behind, managing a 1-3 record during that span. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't taking it well. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to put it in layman's terms for those laymen around him carrying note 
pads, Witt said, "Suppose you write 10 bad articles and then you write another. 
Obviously, you're not doing your job. But if you write one bad article out of 
10, you can just call it a bad night. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a pitcher and you've had six bad outings and only four good ones, 
that's kind of . . . You're not doing your job." 
</P>
<P>
Witt pitched eight innings Wednesday after getting blown out of his previous 
start with two out in the third. Someone asked if he considered this progress. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for results, I'm not looking for progress," he snapped. "I don't 
get paid to make progress. I get paid to get people out." 
</P>
<P>
Witt, losing pitcher in both Angel defeats during their just-completed 5-2 
swing through New York, Boston and Milwaukee, allowed the Brewers eight hits in 
eight innings. Not great, not awful, but just enough to keep Witt's wheels 
spinning in the mud. 
</P>
<P>
On this day, Witt had to pitch in the mud, as rain fell steadily from the 
game's first pitch until its last. Witt surrendered three hits in the first two 
innings, but didn't get bogged down until the third, when he walked Robin Yount 
and yielded a single to Gary Sheffield before facing Brock. 
</P>
<P>
Brock, sidelined since April 2 with a shoulder injury that required 
arthroscopic surgery, returned to the Brewers' active roster only hours before 
the game. His third-inning at-bat against Witt was only his second of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
When it was finished, Brock's batting average read .500 and Milwaukee led, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Brock hit that new addition to Witt's repertoire, the forkball, 400 feet, 
nearly to straight-away center field. When the ball landed beyond the outfield 
wall, Brewer starter Don August had all the offense he required to improve his 
record to 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave up a three-run home run and that was basically the game," Witt said. 
"Brock hit a pretty good pitch and that was it." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Schroeder, the Angel catcher who called the pitch, corroborated Witt's 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had to do it over again, I'd go with the same pitch," Schroeder said. "It 
wasn't that bad a pitch. It wasn't, by any means, a hanger." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, it effectively hung up Witt again. With Wally Joyner's run-scoring ground 
ball in the fourth inning the extent of the Angel attack, Witt could do nothing 
but keep pitching and ride out the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"As the game progressed, I thought he threw much better," Angel Manager Doug 
Rader said. "The three-run home run got him rolling. It's a shame he had to 
give it up, but I thought he pitched well after that." 
</P>
<P>
Not well enough for Witt. 
</P>
<P>
The best thing he could say about Wednesday is that tomorrow's another day -- 
and that means the beginning of June. Historically, June has been to Witt what 
October was to Reggie Jackson -- his peak period. During this month, Witt has 
won 21 games, lost nine and fashioned a 2.93 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
So, at least he's got that going for him, right? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just looking for a good outing," Witt said. "I don't care what time of 
year it is." 
</P>
<P>
And what is Witt's definition of a good outing? 
</P>
<P>
"You know what I mean," Witt said. "A good outing, to me, is a win, a complete 
game, giving up about two runs." 
</P>
<P>
Preferably, in that order. 
</P>
<P>
There haven't been many of those for Witt in April and May. Remember the days 
when Witt was the pitcher who stopped losing streaks, not winning ones, the 
Angel starter who picked up the rest of the staff time after time? This year, 
the roles have been dramatically reversed, with Kirk McCaskill, Chuck Finley 
&amp; Co. doing the bailing for Witt. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've picked up anyone this year," Witt said. "That's like 10 
years ago. This is this year. And this is the best team I've ever played on." 
</P>
<P>
That, Witt claims, has made the waiting all the tougher. Anyone can hitch a 
ride. Witt would at least like to be a part of the car-pool.

Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
In truth, Mike Witt allowed the Brewers nine hits, but because of a misjudged 
fly ball by third-base umpire Ken Kaiser, the box score will forever read 
eight. In the seventh inning, Kaiser ruled a line drive to left field by 
Milwaukee's Terry Francona an out when, in fact, the ball one-hopped the turf 
into the glove of Angel left fielder Dante Bichette. With two out and a runner 
on second base, Bichette came up throwing -- only to find Kaiser with his fist 
in the air to signal the third out. "That was a miraculous catch," Brewer 
Manager Tom Trebelhorn deadpanned later. "That catch right there, I'll tell you 
what -- if you want to call one-hoppers to shortstop line-drive outs, that'll 
be fine with us." Bichette admitted he caught the ball on the bounce, but 
added, "It was a tough call for the umpire. It was raining and it was really 
close. Nobody's perfect." Bichette's reaction when he spotted Kaiser's out 
sign? "I just headed for the dugout," he said. "I wasn't going to hang around 
out there and show the umpire up." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels scored in the fourth inning after Johnny Ray's single and a deep fly 
ball by Devon White that kicked off the glove of Milwaukee center fielder Robin 
Yount for an error. Ray wound up on third base on the play and came home on a 
grounder to second base by Wally Joyner. The Angels' only other scoring threat 
came in the seventh inning, when they loaded the bases against Don August and 
relief pitcher Jay Aldrich. But with two out, Brian Downing grounded into a 
force play to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Bichette started in left field in place of Chili Davis, who has been bothered 
by a sore hand. Bichette responded with two singles in four at-bats, snapping 
out of a 1-for-16 spell.

Andy Croghan looks back over his brief baseball career and wonders . . . how? 
</P>
<P>
How does a guy who decided he no longer wanted to play baseball when he was a 
freshman in high school get to pitch in the College World Series? 
</P>
<P>
How does a guy who had no scholarship offers a year ago get to pitch in college 
in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
How does a guy who has never won a postseason game in his life win two of the 
most important games in Cal State Long Beach baseball history? 
</P>
<P>
How, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I still can't believe all of this," said Croghan, a graduate of Servite 
High School. "This season has gone by so fast, I really haven't had time to 
think about what's happened." 
</P>
<P>
What has happened falls into the near-miracle category. Long Beach, 14-45 a 
year ago, is 50-13 and headed for the College World Series, which begins Friday 
in Omaha. In the middle of it all -- or at least in the general vicinity -- is 
Croghan. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-5 freshman is 12-0, including a 10-3 victory over Arizona in the 
West I Regional final on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Croghan, who was in the 49ers' bullpen for the first six games of the season 
(two saves), worked his way into the rotation and is now the team's No. 2 
starter. What impressed Long Beach Coach Dave Snow was that Croghan threw 
strikes, unlike a couple of his starters. 
</P>
<P>
In game No. 7, Croghan was given a chance to start and he beat Cal State 
Dominguez Hills, 6-2. He pitched 6 1/3 innings for the victory and was sent 
back to the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a spot start, we needed to rest a couple of our pitchers," Snow 
said. "But he did such a good job that we wanted to give him another 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks later, Croghan got another shot at starting and went the distance 
to beat Pepperdine, 9-2. From that point, he was in the starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Croghan ranks second on the team in victories, earned-run average (3.09), 
innings pitched (125 1/3), strikeouts (106) and complete games (six). Kyle 
Abbott, who played at Mission Viejo High School, leads the team in all those 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no expectations for Andy at the start of the season," Snow said. "We 
knew he could be a quality pitcher, but he's turned out to be a vital part of 
our staff." 
</P>
<P>
High praise for a guy who was sick of baseball four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Croghan started pitching at age 7 in Yorba Linda youth leagues. By the time he 
was a freshman at Servite, he'd had enough. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Croghan, Andy's father, was understanding, but puzzled. 
</P>
<P>
"Since he was a little kid, Andy always had baseball on his mind," Croghan 
said. "It was his life. I didn't know what had changed." 
</P>
<P>
Said Andy Croghan: "Baseball wasn't fun anymore. After seven years, I was 
burned out with pitching." 
</P>
<P>
Croghan didn't compete in athletics as a freshman. He played basketball as a 
sophomore, but spent most of his free time hanging around the house. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Croghan didn't see this as a healthy situation. 
</P>
<P>
"It was his decision, we never pushed our kids into anything," Fred Croghan 
said. "I did tell him that he should find something to do with his time." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Croghan did a little more than that, though. 
</P>
<P>
"One morning dad packed my baseball gear and told me to try out for the team," 
said Andy Croghan, who was a sophomore at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Croghan discovered that father knew best. 
</P>
<P>
Servite Coach Mike McNary was so impressed with Croghan that he was put on the 
junior varsity. 
</P>
<P>
Croghan finished with a 9-2 record and was voted the team's most valuable 
player. As a junior, he was moved up to the varsity. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Friars were well-stocked with starting pitchers. To begin with, 
McNary had senior James Ferguson, who lost just one game in three years at 
Servite. McNary also had Craig Barkley, a senior who was a starter the previous 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt the best place for Andy was in the bullpen," McNary said. "We had used 
Ferguson there the previous year and we needed someone to be a stopper." 
</P>
<P>
Croghan filled the bill. He was 5-3 and saved seven games. But it was the 
disappointment with the way the season ended that Croghan always will remember 
about that year. 
</P>
<P>
Servite played top-seeded Esperanza in the quarterfinals of the Southern 
Section 4-A playoffs, a team the Friars had beaten in a nonleague game that 
season with Croghan pitching three hitless innings. 
</P>
<P>
In the playoffs, however, the Friars squandered a 5-0 lead and lost, 7-5, in 
nine innings. Croghan gave up a two-run homer to Tom Redington that tied the 
score, 5-5, in the seventh. He also surrendered a two-run double to Doug 
Sanders in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"That game will haunt me the rest of my life," Croghan said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Croghan quickly began to exorcise the ghosts of the past. He won his 
first four games and was attracting a lot of interest from college recruiters 
and professional scouts. His fastball was clocked between 85 and 87 miles per 
hour and he was developing a good split-finger fastball. 
</P>
<P>
But Croghan struggled the rest of the season, which ended with two 
disappointing outings. Going into the last game of the season against Mater 
Dei, Croghan was 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Because both teams had several college and pro prospects, both coaches decided 
to showcase the game. It was moved to Glover Stadium and drew a large number of 
scouts and recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
Croghan lasted four innings. He gave up eight runs, including home runs by Rob 
Ickes and Jim Austin. 
</P>
<P>
"After that game, Andy's stock dropped," McNary said. "I talked to a few scouts 
afterwards, but they were interested in other players on the team. There wasn't 
a lot of talk about Andy." 
</P>
<P>
Croghan's high school career ended a week later with more playoff torture. 
</P>
<P>
In the first round of the 5-A playoffs, he pitched a six-hitter against 
Nogales. However, three of those hits were home runs and Servite lost, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
"We played at our place and the fences are pretty short," Croghan said. "Two of 
them were fly balls that barely made it over the fence." 
</P>
<P>
Croghan was drafted in the 19th round by the Chicago Cubs, but turned down 
their offer. He felt he need more time to mature. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the question was . . . where? 
</P>
<P>
"I had received a lot of letters early in the season, but nobody offered me a 
scholarship," Croghan said. "I was all set to go to Cypress when Coach Snow 
approached me." 
</P>
<P>
Snow, who had just resigned at Loyola Marymount to take the Long Beach job, had 
seen Croghan pitch against Mater Dei, but was impressed anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"He was getting the ball up, that was his only problem that day," Snow said. 
"He was a big kid who was very limber. You can take a kid like that and make 
him into a good pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Snow continued to follow Croghan during the summer when Croghan was pitching 
for his Connie Mack team. 
</P>
<P>
"I was stunned to learn that no one had offered him a scholarship," Snow said. 
"This kid could be great." 
</P>
<P>
So Snow offered Croghan a scholarship on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
"There a lot of kids who hit .500 in high school that aren't college 
prospects," Snow said. "Andy was a college prospect. I don't care how his 
season ended." 
</P>
<P>
Croghan worked over the summer on keeping the ball down. He also developed his 
split-finger -- a sinking fastball -- to the point where it replaced his 
fastball as his out-pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference is Andy was pitching above the belt in high school, now he's 
down around the knees," Snow said. 
</P>
<P>
Snow has become so confident in Croghan that he used him twice in key games 
during the regional. 
</P>
<P>
In the opener against Hawaii, Snow started the game with relief pitchers, 
hoping to save his starters for later games. However, after Long Beach fell 
behind, 5-4, in the third, he called on Croghan. 
</P>
<P>
Croghan got out of a first-and-third situation with one pitch and went on to 
pitch 4 1/3 shutout innings for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"He may be a freshman on paper, but on the mound his age doesn't matter," Snow 
said. "Not the way he's pitching." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Long Beach beat Oklahoma and Arizona to take control of the 
regional. The 49ers needed to win one of two games against Arizona on Monday to 
win qualify for the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
And, it was Croghan who drew the first game against the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
"My first thought was about that Esperanza game and how I haven't done too well 
in playoff situations," Croghan said. "I spent the whole day worrying about it. 
I finally told myself to stop thinking and just pitch." 
</P>
<P>
And, when it comes to that, Croghan doesn't need to ask how.

HAM HOPING TO BE A RISING STAR; 
</P>
<P>
SO FAR, FORMER TITAN HAS BEEN IN RIGHT PLACE AT RIGHT TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's not that Mike Ham is complaining, but he would like to be a little more 
than a stopgap catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Ham, who played at Cal State Fullerton in 1986 and 1987, has been moving up in 
the San Francisco Giants organization. But not for the usual reasons. 
</P>
<P>
In the past eight months, Ham has been promoted twice. Nothing wrong with that, 
except in both cases he wasn't even hitting his weight. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Ham hit .165 and drove in 13 runs for Clinton, Iowa, a Class-A team. 
But at the end of the season, he was promoted to San Jose, which is at a higher 
level of Class A. Seems San Jose had only two catchers, one of which was also 
the team's designated hitter. Ham was promoted for the playoffs in case of 
injury to one of the other catchers. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Ham started as a backup catcher at San Jose and still wasn't 
hitting his weight (.150). One week into the season, however, he was promoted 
to Phoenix, the Giants' triple-A team. 
</P>
<P>
"To be real honest, we had an emergency situation," said Dave Nahabedian, the 
Giants' assistant director of minor league operations. "One of our Phoenix 
catchers was injured. We didn't want to take time away from one of our regular 
catchers in the organization, so we moved Mike up." 
</P>
<P>
The Firebirds are not sure when Bill Bates, the reserve catcher who injured his 
arm, will return. Until that time, though, the 200-pound Ham is making the most 
of the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
And this time he's hitting his weight. As the backup for Will Tejada, Ham is 
hitting .240 with three runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
In his first start for the Firebirds, Ham had two hits, including the 
game-winning single against Tucson. And, last week, he had a two-run triple 
that put Phoenix ahead to stay against Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew Mike was a great defensive catcher, but he's holding his own as a 
hitter," Nahabedian said. "That's surprised us. But, there he is with two 
game-winning hits." 
</P>
<P>
Even at Fullerton, Ham was known primarily for his defense. As a senior in 
1987, he hit .256 with five home runs and 33 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
After being selected in the 24th round of the June amateur draft by the Giants, 
Ham was assigned to Everett, a rookie league team in Washington, where he hit 
.248 with a home run and 21 RBIs in 39 games. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike has a very good arm and is very good at handling pitchers," Nahabedian 
said. "It was just a question of how well he would hit." 
</P>
<P>
Ham said part of his problem at Clinton last season stemmed from a sore arm he 
developed at Fullerton. He said that not starting also hampered his hitting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough situation not knowing if you're going to play," Ham said. "I had 
never had to deal with that before. I had always been a starter." 
</P>
<P>
Ham has had little trouble adjusting to triple-A pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always felt that I was more than just a defensive catcher," Ham said. 
"That was a bad rap. If I get my confidence going, I can prove it. I'm getting 
tired of filling in for people." 
</P>
<P>
However, Nahabedian said that when Bates returns, Ham will likely go back to 
San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Former UC Irvine star Tom Baine is having a less chaotic trip through the minor 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Baine has moved steadily through the St. Louis Cardinals' system since being 
drafted in the 30th round in 1986. Of course, the fact that he has hit above or 
around .300 on every level might have something to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Baine hit .298 for Erie, Pa., the Cardinals' rookie league team. The 
following year, he hit .306 for Springfield, Ill., a Class-A team. Last season, 
Baine hit .307 on the double-A level at Arkansas. This season, after a slow 
start, he's hitting .325 for Louisville, the Cardinals' triple-A team. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really kind of surprised that I've moved up so quickly," Baine said. "The 
Cardinals have a reputation of moving players along slowly. Especially ones who 
were taken so late in the draft." 
</P>
<P>
Triple-A has been a snap for Baine . . . on the field, anyway. Off it, he has 
had to get used to this new form of travel called flying. 
</P>
<P>
Baine rode buses and stayed in less-than-quality hotels during his first few 
years in professional baseball. This season, Baine has found the hotels to his 
liking. It's getting to them that's caused him some problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not scared of flying or anything like that, it's just takes a lot out of 
me," Baine said. "Last season at Arkansas, we had a beautiful bus, with beds. I 
slept really well on that bus." 
</P>
<P>
Baine blames his slow start on the air travel. He started the season four for 
25, before going on a hot streak. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting used to flying now, I'm even able to sleep while I'm in the air," 
Baine said. "I still miss that bus, but you don't travel by bus in the major 
leagues. I'll learn to like flying." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Schwabe, a graduate of Tustin High School, was recalled by the Detroit 
Tigers last week after an impressive showing at London, Ontario, the Tigers' 
double-A team. 
</P>
<P>
In eight games with London, Schwabe was 3-0 with a 1.07 earned-run average. He 
also had two saves in eight appearances, two of which were starts. 
</P>
<P>
Schwabe, who pitched at Rancho Santiago College and Arizona State, pitched 2 
2/3 shutout innings of relief Saturday against Kansas City. He struck out two 
and walked only one. 
</P>
<P>
Attention Dave LaRoche: Former Angel relief pitchers seem to be surfacing all 
over the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, DeWayne Buice, who saved 17 games for the Angels in 1987, was 
recalled by the Toronto Blue Jays after a strong showing at the team's triple-A 
franchise in Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
And now comes the return of Donnie Moore, who last week won his first game 
since Aug. 7, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, now a member of the Omaha Royals, pitched three hitless innings against 
the Richmond Braves Tuesday. He struck out three and didn't walk a batter and 
picked up the victory after Matt Winters hit a three-run homer in the 10th 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Moore is 1-1 with a 1.42 ERA for Omaha this season. 
</P>
<P>
When last seen in an Angel uniform, Moore was trying to make yet another 
comeback. He was 5-2 with a 4.91 ERA and four saves. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who saved a club record 31 games in 1985 and 21 in 1986, was released 
late last season by the Angels. He signed a minor league contract with the 
Royals during the winter.

USAIR CUTS ORANGE COUNTY-SACRAMENTO FARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
USAir said Wednesday that it has slashed unrestricted one-way fares between 
Sacramento and four Southern California destinations including the county's 
John Wayne Airport -- to $129 from $189. 
</P>
<P>
The move came just days after American Airlines said it would cancel its 
nonstop flights from John Wayne to the state capital on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Although the fare reductions appeared in part to be a bid to woo Orange 
County-to-Sacramento commuters away from American even before the nonstop 
service is eliminated, the cuts also apply to USAir flights to Sacramento from 
Los Angeles, Burbank and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia-based USAir said it has also cut its fare for advance-purchase, 
seven-day, round-trip tickets between Sacramento and the four Southland 
airports to $128 and has added a new one-day, advance-purchase, round-trip 
ticket on the same routes for $148. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for American Airlines said the Dallas-based company is studying the 
USAir fares and will probably match them. 
</P>
<P>
A fare war broke out in late April among carriers with Southern California-Bay 
Area routes after price-slashing Southwest Airlines announced a $29 one-way 
fare on two routes. American, United and USAir all countered with round-trip, 
advance-purchase fares of less than $100. Sacramento fares, however, were not 
discounted.

Three Orange County ad agencies were among those carting off honors in the 
recent 43rd annual competition sponsored by Los Angeles Advertising Women. 
</P>
<P>
Among the local entrants, Roberts/Mealer, Emerson Marketing/Communications 
received the most awards. Staffers at the Costa Mesa agency won three Lulu 
statuettes -- the organization's most coveted award -- and an award for 
excellence for their direct marketing and sales promotion brochures. 
</P>
<P>
Those at Roberts/Mealer who won were Lynda Lawrence, Bruce Mayo, Pat Holohan, 
Chuck Roberts, Jill Stone and Rob Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
Another Lulu in the "It's a Rough Business" category went to Anne K. Morris of 
Morris Advertising &amp; Design in Costa Mesa -- for a print ad that never went 
public. 
</P>
<P>
Morris won a Lulu for two ads in a three-part ad campaign designed for a new 
housing development. The ads became eligible for the award when the development 
sold out after only the first ad was used. 
</P>
<P>
An excellence award for logo/trademark design went to Andrew Skiver and Stu 
Vandermuelen of Newport Beach's InterCommunications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 15 Orange County agencies entered the competition. The awards recognize 
excellence by individuals in advertising and public relations.

THOMPSON TO INVADE NIXON'S OLD TERRITORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Hang on, hang on, I'll be right there!" shouted Hunter S. Thompson, his voice 
echoing across the room from wherever it is in Woody Creek, Colo., that his 
telephone sits. 
</P>
<P>
Cough, cough. "I feel terrible." 
</P>
<P>
The godfather of Gonzo Journalism was feeling more under the gun than usual 
Wednesday morning as he struggled to wake up, pack and get his persnickety new 
home-alarm system operating before departing on a quick trip West for an 
appearance tonight at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, postponed from 
Tuesday night because of an, er, accident. 
</P>
<P>
He fell off a tractor earlier in the week while clearing brush off the local 
rifle range. "A tractor does funny things when you take it on a side hill," he 
said. "It's not like a jeep. It's got a bush hog on the back. You know what a 
bush hog is? It'll grind a man up. You want to get the hell away from a tractor 
with a bush hog on it." 
</P>
<P>
Jousting with bush hogs may seem like tame work, however, compared with the 
wild sort of crowd Thompson is likely to be facing tonight. At Bogart's in Long 
Beach in April, when he appeared in the first of a handful of recent nightclub 
dates (as opposed to the college appearances he has been making for years), he 
was pelted with questions from the mundane ("what do you think of the Lakers?") 
to the truly bizarre ("tell us about the time you spent in a hyperbolic (sic) 
chamber!") 
</P>
<P>
It was enough to inspire a new volume in his famed "Fear and Loathing" series 
of writings over the past 25 years on politics, drugs, gambling, Super Bowls, 
handguns, Samoan lawyers and life in general. 
</P>
<P>
None of it, however, was too much for the unflappable raconteur, who will turn 
50 in July. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked Bogart's," he said. "It's different being in front of a crowd as drunk 
as I am." And indeed, at the Long Beach show he poured himself a steady stream 
of drinks from a bottle of Chivas Regal he brought on stage. 
</P>
<P>
A man who prides himself on having played nemesis to former President Nixon 
("In 1972, I said he was guilty. He was. It just took two years to get him 
out."), Thompson got a chuckle out of the irony of his own appearance in 
Capistrano: "Nixon's old stamping ground. Too bad he's gone -- we could send 
somebody over to pick him up." 
</P>
<P>
And what's it like, Hunter, performing in nightclubs? 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem, he said, has been sound systems. "I have trouble just 
having people understand me, even when they can hear me. In New York, I did one 
show to about 2,000 people who were viciously drunk. The sound system was a 
real horror. I talked for about two hours and thought they could understand me 
perfectly. . . . I videotaped it for myself, and when I played it back, I 
couldn't understand a word I said." 
</P>
<P>
He has also learned that in nightclubs, "it's dangerous to be late. People get 
drunk. In colleges they can't do that. 
</P>
<P>
"Just a minute -- there's a bumblebee! Yellow dog! Lemme smash it!" 
</P>
<P>
Getting back to business, Thompson said he finds speaking engagements "a lot 
tougher now that the election is over. When the campaign was going, I usually 
have an edge on most people because I follow it. Now, I have to be an expert on 
everything from AIDS to NATO to the wheat surplus to why are we a generation of 
swine." (That's one of his pet phrases and the title of his latest book, 
published last year.) 
</P>
<P>
Another interruption. This time it's the driveway motion-sensor hooked to that 
home-alarm system. "The damn peacocks just set it off. Just a minute." 
</P>
<P>
When he's not changing the subject like that, Thompson can discuss politics and 
journalism with the savvy of a career insider, tempered by the wit of a 
professional skeptic. He cited, with pinpoint accuracy, a Times poll published 
in May showing that 51% of the U.S. public believes that President Bush has 
lied about events in the Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The poll also found 67% believing that Lt. Col. Oliver North was only following 
orders and has taken the blame to protect Bush and former President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
"In the next page in the poll," Thompson said, "it said if the election were 
held today, Bush would win again, even though he's considered guilty, 2 to 1. I 
think Reagan created a very comfortable sense of royalty (for the presidency). 
Eisenhower did the same thing, but his replacement was Jack Kennedy. Reagan was 
replaced by his handpicked toadie." 
</P>
<P>
The apparent incongruity of the two polls, he said, reflects a combination of 
the failure of the Democratic Party to produce a serious presidential contender 
and the "overwhelming failure of journalism" he sees in "the complete tailing 
off of the investigative, Watergate-type of journalism." 
</P>
<P>
Far from being a universal hero among journalists, Thompson is resented in some 
camps for his cartoonish persona, personal indulgences and irresponsible 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the resentment might come from the Peter Principle people. . . . 
That's what people told Abe Lincoln about Gen. Grant: They complained that 
Grant was drinking too much whiskey. Lincoln said, 'Go find out what brand he 
drinks and send him a case of it.' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure that fits, but I may represent the kind of fun in journalism, 
that side of it that the in-boys and the guys-in-the-fibers never got. And I do 
think journalism can be about as much fun as any job you can have. Hell, I 
haven't had a job in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind being resented. I don't respect everybody. . . . But I still say 
that journalists are the best people to drink with. Who else are you going to 
drink with -- lawyers? Bond salesmen? 
</P>
<P>
"As a rule, we're a pretty good group." 
</P>

 Hunter S. Thompson will speak tonight at 8 at the Coach House, 33157 Camino 
Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $22.50. Information (714) 496-8930.

POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: O.C. SINGER'S WINDING ROAD ENDS AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Boehm

<TEXT>
<P>
The music on David Lee Porter's debut album, "Can You Play Any Foster &amp; 
Allen?," is nothing like the story behind it. 
</P>
<P>
The music is pleasant, straightforward soft rock -- its main virtues being 
tunefulness and a direct emotionalism. But the story has its share of twists, 
intrigues and bitterness. It's the story of an aspiring Orange County 
singer-songwriter who wanted so badly to move forward in the music business 
that he got himself into debt and a good deal of hot water. 
</P>
<P>
There's a happy ending: Porter was able to finish his album and see it gain a 
modest release late last year on Catalina Records, a small West German label. 
While the debts are still being paid, the hot water has cooled, and Porter, 26, 
is in a position to move ahead, after learning how to make a record the hard 
way. 
</P>
<P>
From the time he started writing songs and playing the guitar as a Fullerton 
teen-ager, Porter was atypical. In those days (the late 1970s), while his 
friends were leaping into Orange County's burgeoning punk rock scene, Porter 
was playing the part of an urban cowboy. 
</P>
<P>
"I did beer-drinking country and Western," he recalled in an interview this 
week at his apartment in Anaheim Hills. "I used to wear Western clothes, and 
I'd be hanging around with all these punkers." 
</P>
<P>
While his friends set out on the usual path, trying to establish a following in 
their hometowns before attempting to get the music industry's attention, Porter 
took his singing to more exotic locales. 
</P>
<P>
After high school, he joined the Merchant Marine and hired on for voyages to 
China and the Caribbean. After returning to Southern California, Porter was 
riding a bus when he found a leaflet put out by the Danish government, 
recruiting American workers for Denmark's film industry. Porter was soon in 
Copenhagen, where he worked at a Burger King after the film job expired. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the old Joseph Conrad thing" -- pure wanderlust -- said Porter, 
a hulking, soft-voiced man who stands well over 6 feet tall and weighs 285 
pounds. "But at the time, I didn't think of it like that. I was grabbing at a 
brass ring that I knew was out there, if I could only go to the right place." 
</P>
<P>
Porter says he virtually established a second home in Denmark and found a 
network of friends who would help him with his music. After traveling back and 
forth between Orange County and Denmark several times during the mid-1980s, he 
decided to make his first serious bid to establish himself as a musician. With 
money from a British label, he recorded an album in England. But the label 
folded, the album was never released, and Porter found no other takers. 
</P>
<P>
Better to go through the hard knocks overseas, Porter figured, than at home. 
"The music business is just one rejection after another. I guess 
psychologically it's easier to take rejection not in your own back yard. I've 
asked myself, 'Why go all over the world like that?' I guess it's just a hope 
that (foreigners) will see something in you that people in your own back yard 
don't see." 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Porter tried again. When RCA Records showed some interest in 
paying for him to record on a tryout basis, he booked time at the British 
studio where he had worked before and where the owners had become his friends 
and cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
But the RCA deal fell through. And instead of telling his British studio 
friends that he would have to call off the project, Porter went ahead with it, 
getting financial backing from friends in Denmark and asking the studio to 
extend credit. 
</P>
<P>
Porter admits that he deceived the studio into thinking that RCA was paying for 
the sessions by forging a letter on RCA stationery. He says he simply didn't 
want to admit his setback to friends who "were the first people in the business 
who said, 'Yeah, Dave is going to make it, he's going to stick with it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Porter figured that it was an innocent enough lie: RCA wouldn't lose anything, 
the studio would get paid with money from his Danish sources, and he was 
confident that this new batch of songs would land him a recording deal with 
another label. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'I'm going to make this happen, any way it takes," Porter said. 
</P>
<P>
But soon afterward, he found himself shut out of the studio (where he had been 
living as well as recording), and the recordings he had made were being held 
hostage by an angry management that no longer viewed him as a friend. 
</P>
<P>
According to Porter, it all stemmed from a falling-out with another Orange 
County singer he had brought over to sing backing vocals on the album. (Porter 
will refer to him only as "the co-vocalist.") After their blow-up, Porter said, 
the other singer told studio owners that the RCA letter was phony -- which was 
true enough -- but also vilified Porter in other ways that Porter says were not 
true. 
</P>
<P>
The studio's owner threw Porter out and, because he owed $6,000, denied him the 
tapes he needed to complete his album. He retreated to Denmark, the project 
apparently in ruins. Then his luck changed. Based on rough tapes he had sent to 
Catalina Records, the German label expressed interest in releasing the finished 
project. And then the recordings that had been locked away in the British 
studio arrived, along with a note from an anonymous studio employee who felt 
that Porter had received a raw deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I came home, tail between my legs, hat in hand," Porter said, but he had the 
basic tracks to continue working on his album, which he finished last fall with 
local producers. He said he has been paying off his English studio debts by 
monthly installments. 
</P>
<P>
Along with his recording misadventures, Porter got to tour for the first time 
while he was making the album, playing a series of barroom shows in Britain, 
Denmark and Germany. The shows were significant, Porter said, because he 
learned not to feel self-conscious about his girth. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so scared it was going to be a disadvantage, and it proved to be an 
advantage," he said. "It's almost like Jimmy Durante's nose: It's something 
people can latch onto. Even in daily life, when people see me once, they 
recognize me. In my shows I'm very physical. I run around, I jump a lot, I do 
things that you wouldn't expect somebody this big to be doing. In England, 
people would come up to me and say how much they liked it." 
</P>
<P>
Porter's next step is to see how Southern California audiences will like it. He 
is planning a special showcase concert with a band in September, but he also 
wants to start doing more informal solo shows in local clubs. Until now, Porter 
has played only three public shows in Orange County, and a handful in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"After having tried everything else (overseas), that's the way it's going to 
end up -- a full circle," Porter said. But he doesn't regret the circuitous 
route that took him to Europe to begin his recording career. "Would I have an 
album now in Tower Records, two years after I started this thing in a real way? 
I'd have to say no." 
</P>
<P>
But Porter said the strain he went through in making his album taught him a 
lesson about the need to be straightforward in the music business: 
</P>
<P>
"If it's going to happen, it will, and if you hang in there long enough it 
will," Porter said. "You don't have to complicate it with Wizard of Oz tactics 
and smoke-screens. Everything has its audience. I'll find mine, or they'll find 
me."

MEET 'MISS JEAN BRODIE,' BUT BEWARE 
</P>

<P>
It's no accident that Jean Brodie counts Mussolini and Franco among her models. 
The aging schoolteacher is an eccentric woman with a gift for moving young 
minds, but she's also something of a classroom fascist, not above dominating 
and manipulating her female students in the name of art and knowledge. She's 
not bad, she's just obsessive -- Machiavelli with flash cards, Napoleon with an 
eraser. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie" by Jay Presson Allen (based on Muriel 
Sparks' novel), we get an up-close and personal view of this unusual woman in 
1930s Edinburgh and of the deep, and not always positive, effect she has on her 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
At the Westminster Community Theatre, Beth Titus plays Brodie vigorously; we 
can feel the verve that such a zealot must possess. When she starts 
rhapsodizing about poetry or Giotto's epic canvases, it's not hard to identify 
with the students who are enamored of her almost otherworldly spirit and 
dedication. 
</P>
<P>
And when Brodie finds how far she's gone astray in her teachings (the death of 
a young girl in the Spanish Civil War is the direct result of Brodie's 
fanatical yearnings to participate, at least vicariously, in the most important 
event of the day), it comes as a shocking contradiction to all that she sees in 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
There's an urgency to J.D. Reichelderfer's direction that serves the drama 
well. The monochromatic set -- a series of black blocks (designed by 
Reichelderfer) that function in various ways, including as classroom desks -- 
helps to underscore the starkness of Brodie and her relationships. 
</P>
<P>
Besides her students (Dani Ballew, Diane Burland, Laurie Sondag and Marla 
Wagner), she's also involved with Gordon (Randy Patterson), a music teacher, 
and Teddy (Doug Stauter), a married artist and her chief love. Then there's 
Miss McKay (Lynne Tavernetti), the school principal with whom she constantly 
clashes. All give satisfying performances. 
</P>
<P>
'THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE' 
</P>
<P>

Several exhibitions developed by Newport Harbor Art Museum's staff have been 
traveling to museums around the country during the past few months. "Figurative 
'50s: New York Figurative Expressionism," seen here last year, has moved on to 
the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and the McNay Art Museum in San Antonio, 
Texas. Last year's controversial "Chris Burden: A 20-Year Survey" is now at the 
Carnegie Mellon University Art Gallery in Pittsburgh and will travel in August 
to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Seen in Newport Beach last spring, "Gunther Forg: 
Painting/Sculpture/Installation" opened earlier this month at the San Francisco 
Museum of Modern Art. And when "L.A. Pop in the '60s" closes at Newport Harbor 
on July 9, it will be packed for shipping to the Henry Art Gallery in Seattle. 
Future stops include the Palm Springs Desert Museum, the Neuberger Museum in 
Purchase, N.Y., and the Phoenix Art Museum.

13 LEGISLATORS' EXPENSES TOP $4.5 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taxpayers shelled out more than $4.5 million for everything from leased cars to 
office furniture to support the San Gabriel Valley's 13 state lawmakers during 
the 1988 session, according to office expense figures released last month. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Legislature's 120 members, Assemblyman William H. Lancaster (R-Covina) 
spent the least, with a tab of $197,397 -- which was about 29% below the 
Assembly average of $279,192 for the 12 months ending last Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The San Gabriel Valley delegation's top spender was former Sen. H. L. 
Richardson (R-Glendora), who listed $584,015 in office expenses, about 17% 
above the Senate average of $483,476. 
</P>
<P>
To reduce costs, Richardson, who retired last year after 22 years in the 
Senate, urged the Legislature to stop meeting year-round. In an interview last 
week, Richardson, who now produces videos and gives speeches, cracked: "You can 
run that whole damn place in 2 1/2 months and still have time left over. Being 
a state senator was the snappiest job I've ever had. It's easy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Figures for Both Houses 
</P>
<P>
In the San Gabriel Valley Senate delegation, Richardson was followed by Sen. 
William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights), $579,113; Newton Russell (R-Glendale), 
$489,881; Joseph Montoya (D-Whittier), $458,909, and Art Torres (D-Los 
Angeles), $406,575. 
</P>
<P>
In the Assembly, all eight San Gabriel Valley lawmakers spent less than the 
$279,192 average. The top spender was Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier), with 
$278,291, followed by Charles Bader (R-Pomona), $277,307; Richard Polanco 
(D-Los Angeles), $275,956; Sally Tanner (D-Baldwin Park), $263,162; Richard 
Mountjoy (R-Monrovia), $259,864; Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), $255,393; Charles 
Calderon (D-Whittier), $254,168; and Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster, whose staff noted that in recent years their boss has ranked at or 
near the bottom for legislative spending, said he could not explain the reason 
for his last-place standing. In an interview, Lancaster, the dean of Assembly 
Republicans, said: "There's no intention on my part to deliberately do that." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Nunes, a Lancaster aide, cited several reasons, including Lancaster's low 
payroll and the fact that last year he mailed constituents only one state-paid 
newsletter. Some lawmakers sent out two newsletters. 
</P>
<P>
The figures are prepared annually by the Assembly and Senate Rules Committees. 
The totals include staff salaries, travel, cars, district office expenses, 
newsletters, postage, telephones, furniture, equipment, supplies, subscriptions 
and photocopying. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extra Duties Not Counted 
</P>
<P>
The totals do not reflect staff and other costs connected with committee 
assignments. Some lawmakers who head committees have additional staff and 
expenses connected to their extra duties. 
</P>
<P>
It generally costs more to run a Senate office than an Assembly office because 
senators represent larger constituencies. In the Senate, members are allotted 
different amounts, based on the size of their districts and the cost-of-living 
in cities where their district offices are located. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly in 1988 limited each member's expenses to $254,700, excluding 
$87-a-day in living expenses the members received while in session to 
supplement their salaries. But the allotment did not include some expenses, 
such as the cost of mailing newsletters. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Connelly, Assembly Rules Committee chief administrative officer, said 
Assembly expenses last year increased 13% from 1987. Among the reasons he cited 
were a 4% cost of living increase and a delay in receiving $500,000 worth of 
1987 printing bills, which were paid in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, expenses increased about 7% compared to 1987 mostly because of 
normal cost-of-living increases, according to Cliff Berg, Senate Rules 
Committee executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Salaries 
</P>
<P>
Richardson said one reason for his higher-than-average expense tab was that 
most of his employees had served on his staff for many years and, as a 
consequence, drew high salaries. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, since retiring, he missed three perquisites of office: the Senate 
sergeants-at-arms gassing up his car, the convenience of parking in the 
basement of the Capitol and "the doughnuts in the back of the room in the 
lounge" of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Campbell said his above-average spending stemmed from several factors, 
including maintaining two offices in his district, which sprawls over Los 
Angeles and Orange Counties; representing an area with three telephone area 
codes, which triggered higher telephone bills, and having a senior staff at the 
top of the pay schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell agreed with Richardson that there is merit to the proposal to 
reinstate a part-time Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that happens is that we make a lot of our own work because 
we are a full-time Legislature," Campbell said. "We have full-time employees 
who, in order to justify their existence, have to come up with recommendations. 
Those recommendations result in bills or in legislative action of some sort . . 
. that take time and cost money."

<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule this summer on a case that could 
lead to a reversal of its decision 16 years ago legalizing abortion. As 
abortion proponents and opponents spilled into the streets with protests and 
marches this spring, it was obvious not all the voices were women's. To better 
understand the men's view, Times staff writer Dana Parsons interviewed six who 
have been active on one side or the other of the movement. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Covial: Although he had always considered himself a pro-choice advocate, 
Covial, 29, took part in his first demonstration this spring in Los Angeles. "I 
think it really hit me that they could take (the right to an abortion) away," 
he said. "I saw that Operation Rescue was gathering a lot of people; it seemed 
like they had momentum. Their voices were being heard. I wanted to help the 
people who were pro-choice have their voices heard." 
</P>
<P>
Covial, a Reseda bachelor, spends much of his time in Orange County, recruiting 
for a package shipping company. He has also taken part in a demonstration at a 
clinic in Cypress where abortions are performed. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's a question of personal freedom and liberty," Covial said. "I don't 
like abortion, and nobody does. I don't like the fact that somebody has to get 
an abortion, but it's a woman's body, and once you allow the government to get 
inside her body and tell her what to do, what's next? But in terms of being 
pro-choice, I wanted people to be aware I'm not pro-abortion, and there is a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
Covial's position is tinged by his sad conclusion that abortion represents "the 
taking of a life. I'll grant that it's a living cell. The point is, it's still 
the woman's decision to make. It's inside her body. . . . If she's thought it 
through in her conscience, with her friends, parents or just herself, and if 
she feels the best thing to do is not carry it to term, it's her choice and not 
the government's." 
</P>
<P>
Covial, who is black, said it's important that men support women in the 
abortion controversy, just as whites supported blacks during the civil rights 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
"If you remember the March on Washington (in 1963), part of Martin Luther 
King's speech was, 'We must not come to hate our white brothers because as 
evidenced here today, they have come to realize their destiny is tied up with 
our destiny.' I kind of analogize that for the men in this movement. Sure I'll 
never get pregnant, but I do believe a woman's freedom is inextricably tied to 
mine." 
</P>
<P>
Covial is troubled by what he sees as the "hypocrisy" and "racist" agenda of 
many in the pro-life movement. It is largely a white middle-class movement 
whose members say the women should have the baby and then put the child up for 
adoption, he said. But those people are unlikely to adopt babies who are 
members of minority groups or born with handicaps, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Johnson: When he saw the unfair housing practices leveled against blacks in 
the 1960s, Johnson was outraged. And in those days of the fledgling civil 
rights movement, he became an activist. 
</P>
<P>
Now 56, Johnson has cast his lot with the pro-choice advocates in the abortion 
movement, taking part in his first public demonstration in April when he joined 
other marchers in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
To Johnson, married for 33 years and the father of three grown children, the 
fight for the right to an abortion represents another battle for civil rights. 
And just as a white man speaking out for blacks 20 years ago, so now does 
Johnson feel he must speak out for women. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a great deal of empathy for (blacks who were discriminated against)," 
Johnson said. "That's all I can say. I couldn't put myself in their shoes. I 
couldn't say I understood. All I could say is, 'You know, I'm with you in 
this.' Women now and historically have been treated much like blacks. That's 
where I made the transition. I could see the relationship between those two 
things." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, an electronics engineer with Rockwell International and a Tustin 
resident, said he tries to look at issues from different sides. "I look at them 
from the gut, the heart and the mind. It's easy to look at them from the mind 
because I'm an engineer. Yet I learned from my wife and other people how to 
feel more and look at things in that sense. I think it (the abortion question) 
is a human rights issue, I think it's a women's rights issue, it's a 
theological issue and medical issue. And all those have influenced me, some 
more than others. And maybe most of all, it's a family issue." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, Johnson said, he became convinced that there was no biblical 
imperative against abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"It becomes a question of my view of life," Johnson said. "My view of life is 
that you do what is the most loving thing." 
</P>
<P>
The reality of modern-day life, Johnson said, is that some people are not 
capable of caring for a child. "When the mother-to-be does not want the child, 
then my belief is that the child should not be born." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Snyder: His wife decided last fall that she wanted to get involved in the 
pro-choice movement. She began serving as an escort for young women seeking 
abortions. His wife's involvement eventually led to Snyder's widened 
participation in the movement. Snyder, 34, a truck driver from Orange and the 
father of two young children, began clipping articles and becoming more 
informed about the abortion controversy. 
</P>
<P>
He found himself unable to accept the notion that a woman could be forced to 
give birth. 
</P>
<P>
"I label myself a liberal, whether that has anything to do with it or not," 
Snyder said. "I always felt people's rights are utmost. . . . If they reverse 
this law, what's next? What are they going to take away next?" 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said he had to grapple with the question of when life begins and whether 
aborting a fetus is murder. He reached a difficult, but unwavering, conclusion, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would rather see a fetus aborted at an early stage than to see an unwanted 
child brought into this world. There are too many out there now. Too many 
abused, neglected children -- already thousands, if not millions. I don't agree 
with forced motherhood. If I thought my own kids (ages 10 and 7) stood a chance 
of being unwanted, neglected or abused, I would not want them brought into the 
world to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
While he was certain of the correctness of his position, Snyder is surprised at 
how active he has become. "I was really shocked. I didn't expect to be getting 
up at 5 in the morning and be going to the Orange clinic and standing my ground 
for human rights and women's rights. I was probably as surprised as anyone that 
I was out there because I'm normally introverted. I'm basically concerned about 
my family, my kids, and that's usually as far as it goes. But I see it 
affecting my wife and myself and my kids' future. So it's something that needs 
to be done."

<P>
With a name like Big Canyon you would expect to see some sort of narrow chasm 
with precipitous walls and water flowing through the middle, right? 
</P>
<P>
Welllll, not exactly. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the Big Canyon neighborhood is a sprawling 390-acre, lush 
residential complex and country club. Bounded by four major arterial streets -- 
Ford and San Joaquin Hills roads on the north and south and MacArthur Boulevard 
and Jamboree Road on the east and west -- this "fortress" of foliage and 
fairways lies immediately north of the Newport Center Financial Plaza, one of 
Orange County's principal commercial and financial centers. 
</P>
<P>
The major open space and recreational amenity is the Big Canyon golf course. 
Lakes, creeks and ponds run throughout the 145-acre layout. With the Big Canyon 
Country Club acting as the focal point of the complex, the Irvine Co. created a 
serene, resort-like homestead. 
</P>
<P>
The club opened in April, 1972, and 2 years later its 500 stockholders bought 
the entire operation from the Irvine Co. Today, there are 400 non-equity 
members besides the 500 stockholders who operate the club. Professional golfer 
Shirley Little is an honorary member. She does most of her practicing on the 
blue-green grassy turf of the club. 
</P>
<P>
Built around and throughout the golf course are 500 homes -- 225 of them 
townhouses perched on the outer perimeter. Single-family homes are situated 
nearer the middle. As befits an ambiance dominated by a country club, many of 
the neighborhood's streets are named for famous links -- Burning Tree Circle, 
Winged Foot Lane, Augusta Road, Cypress Point and Inverness and Oakmont lanes, 
just to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
Home prices reflect what has happened elsewhere in the county. When units went 
on sale in Big Canyon in 1972, houses started at $75,000, condominiums around 
$65,000. Today, prices for the average four- or five-bedroom home with 
three-car garage begin around $800,000, or $500,000 for a townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Bibb, a Grubb &amp; Ellis real estate agent who has been a resident since 
1980 and has sold 100 houses in the neighborhood, describes his customers this 
way: "Three-fourth of the buyers have families and most are in the 35- to 
55-age group. The majority of homeowners never leave the immediate area -- they 
might buy another home smaller or larger, but they usually don't leave." 
</P>
<P>
They are also among Orange County's most affluent residents. Big Canyon is the 
third-richest neighborhood in the county, with a median household income 
exceeding $100,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
Big Canyon can also accommodate those who prefer to rent. At the intersection 
of Ford Road and MacArthur Boulevard are the Big Canyon Villas, not to be 
confused with the gate-guarded estates a block away. Seventy- 
</P>
<P>
eight townhouses are for rent only and range from $2,175 to $3,250 monthly. 
</P>
<P>
Most residents in Newport Beach seem to put great emphasis on the harbor area, 
but not Big Canyon residents. They opt for grass, shrubs, trees, flowers and, 
of course, golf.

JOSEPH N. BELL: 3 WAR BUDDIES GATHER AFTER YEARS APART, AND FIND THE GOING EASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the advantages afforded by the visibility of a job like this is the 
chance of being called to the attention of people with whom you've long ago 
lost contact -- and wish you hadn't. That's why I had lunch the other day with 
Po Harwell and Joe Blizzard. I flew with them in World War II, and a recent 
column inspired both of them to phone me. Separately. They didn't know about 
each other, either, so with me as a connecting link, the three of us got 
together for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
I always approach such meetings with trepidation. The immediacy of a war -- or 
any other human crisis -- often makes close friends of people who might 
otherwise have found little in common. My friends in the movie business talk 
about this frequently. People involved in making a film together share a very 
intense experience that sometimes leads to intense relationships. Then the film 
ends, the cast members make feverish plans to get together -- and often never 
see each other again. 
</P>
<P>
A war is like that -- intense relationships multiplied by months or years 
instead of the weeks on a movie set. But I discovered the hard way in the years 
immediately after World War II that lacking the glue of shared danger (or 
ennui), these relationships can come unstuck. We looked up a lot of wartime 
friends in various parts of the country and often found that once the war had 
been relived, there was no place to put down. So it had been a long time since 
I'd renewed any of these wartime friendships. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't know Po Harwell very well. We had instructed in the same training 
squadron, but we had different sets of close friends. So our friendship 
involved an occasional card game in the ready room or talk over a beer at a 
squadron party. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Blizzard was different. We had been so close that I almost didn't get 
shipped overseas because of our friendship. We were both dive-bomber pilots who 
had been transferred to the Naval Air Transport Service, and we got our 
overseas orders at the same time. We were being flown to the South Pacific 
individually, so when Joe and I arrived in San Francisco and checked in for 
transportation overseas, we asked the WAVE on duty if she would try to get us 
flown over together. As it turned out, she took that request all too seriously. 
</P>
<P>
She stapled our cards together, with Blizzard's on top, and when he was sent 
out, his card was filed with mine stuck to the back. So for all intents and 
purposes, I was gone, too. But, of course, I didn't know it. We had to sit at a 
phone number we had provided between 11 and 12 each day; if we weren't called, 
we were free for another 24 hours. I sat by my phone for three weeks after 
everyone else had gone. I toyed with the idea of sitting out the war there, but 
I wasn't getting paid and also figured I was getting in trouble. So I reported 
in and was told that they were looking all over the Pacific for me. When they 
found my card stapled to Blizzard's, I was off the hook and they sent me out 
instantly. 
</P>
<P>
I found Blizzard again -- wondering what in hell had happened to me -- and we 
served out the rest of the war in the same transport squadron. We also made a 
fair amount of side money off visiting civilian pilots. Blizzard and I had 
played bridge together for two years, and whenever Pan Am pilots -- refueling 
and resting -- passed through our squadron and wanted a bridge game, Blizzard 
and I obliged. Since they made about four times as much as we did, we were 
never reluctant to appropriate some of their largess -- at half a cent a point. 
</P>
<P>
Rich memories. We drank our way through a three-hour lunch, reliving them. But 
when the time came to move on to other topics, we made the transition without a 
hitch. We found that we all live in the present, too -- and that we had much to 
share there. 
</P>
<P>
Po Harwell stayed in the Navy for 23 years, coming out as a full commander and 
assistant director of the Navy's flight-testing program. After that, he spent 
another 16 years as a research pilot for Rockwell, working on the Apollo 
program with many of America's early astronauts. He's retired now, in Orange, 
after a lifelong love affair with the airplane. 
</P>
<P>
Blizzard considered a Navy career and even stayed in for six months after the 
war -- until he discovered that in the peacetime Navy, Annapolis men got the 
choice assignments and reservists the dregs. So he took his flying experience 
into private industry, where has worked ever since with firms supplying 
aeronautical equipment. He has worked for more than two decades in Los Alamitos 
and lived in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
Although our lives have taken divergent courses, we found a lot of common 
strains that never got talked out. Even the waitress got in the spirit of these 
three old dogs reliving a period when she wasn't even born -- and unable to lie 
about it because we had all been there. 
</P>
<P>
When we broke up, it was with the promise that we would do it again soon. I 
think we will.

ASK THE VET: RESIDENT DOGS MIGHT NOT MIX WELL WITH GUESTS' PETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. GLENN ERICSON

<TEXT>
<P>
Q. Do you have any tips on introducing new dogs into homes with older dogs? I 
have two dogs, a 7-year-old doxie and a 6-year-old jealous Scottie, both 
females. Since they were attacked by a stray dog while being walked on a leash, 
they do not tolerate other dogs. 
</P>
<P>
I will be having house guests this month, bringing two female dogs, a 
9-month-old wire-haired doxie and a 15-month-old German shepherd that is very 
protective of the doxie. 
</P>
<P>
Since my Scottie is rather intimidating, I feel I'm going to have a problem. 
There is no way I can keep them separated. I'd like the dogs to get along but 
don't know how to handle this. I'd like them to meet outside the yard and bring 
them in the house together, but don't know if this would be a good way to 
handle it. Closed doors won't mean much as the shepherd knows how to open 
doors. As you can see. I have a problem. 
</P>
<P>
J. Genton, Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
A. Introducing these dogs may not be possible without several territorial 
bouts. Gradual introduction with all pets on leashes may help you control this 
initial animosity, but leaving all four alone in a yard could be inviting 
trouble, especially with a large dog such as the shepherd. To avoid fighting 
and possible serious injuries, you may be forced to board one or more of the 
dogs. The cost of boarding would probably be cheaper than the cost of 
veterinary bills for bite wounds. Or, you might see if you can't find a close 
neighbor or friend who could keep your guests' dogs while they are staying with 
you. Good luck. 
</P>
<P>
Q. We want to raise two female kittens and a 6-week-old Rotweiler puppy. In 
what sequence should we acquire them? 
</P>
<P>
Buddy Roberts, Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
A. I think that you will have no problem introducing the kittens with a puppy. 
None of them have established territory yet and should make amusing playmates. 
You may have to watch that the puppy doesn't become too boisterous with the 
kittens because it could easily lead to a scratch on the nose or face. Also, be 
careful around feeding time, as the pup may not be willing to share his meal 
with the inquisitive kittens. I have raised my golden retriever with cats and 
have had no serious problems.

BUENA'S CLIMB COMES TO END IN LOSS TO HART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sean Waters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buena High finally got caught playing mediocre baseball during its climb 
through the Southern Section 4-A Division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Stan Hedegard knew the top-seeded Bulldogs had to play with more 
intensity despite four-run victories over Valencia and Lompoc in preliminary 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"We had two playoff wins and we didn't play well in either one of them," 
Hedegard said. "I thought it was just a phase we were going through and we 
would snap out of it against Hart." 
</P>
<P>
Hart caught Buena napping and took a 5-1 lead after two innings en route to a 
10-7 victory Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Anderson, who had given up only 11 earned runs in 51 1/3 innings, allowed 
five runs before leaving after two innings against Hart. Anderson, a senior 
left-hander who will attend Cal State Northridge next year, had been bothered 
by a sore elbow. 
</P>
<P>
"Your arm hurts a little more when you don't get any support," Hedegard said. 
"You can work out a sore shoulder, but you have to be careful with elbows. I 
just decided to shelf it. I didn't want to ruin his career for one game." 
</P>
<P>
Add Buena: Hedegard checked with former Buena coaches and determined the 
Bulldogs (20-3-2) set a school record for fewest losses in a season. The 
Bulldogs had played 21 consecutive games without a loss prior to Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting game: Fillmore Coach Tom Ecklund waits until 10 minutes remain before 
the start of his playoff games before selecting either Brad Edmonds or Bill 
Alonzo as his starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want anyone pitching with a sore arm," Ecklund said. "I watch them 
warm up and ask them how they feel. I expect an honest answer. I know they both 
want to pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Edmonds earned the starting assignment in all three playoff games. The senior 
right-hander had allowed two earned runs on nine hits and five walks in 12 
innings before a complete-game win Tuesday over Aquinas. 
</P>
<P>
Power shortage: Former Simi Valley High slugger Scott Sharts doesn't have to 
worry about his home run record being broken for at least another year. Sharts 
-- now playing at the University of Miami -- hit 32 home runs between 1986 and 
1988 to set a Southern Section career record. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Melendez of St. Bernard High in Playa del Rey posed a threat after hitting 
his 29th and 30th home runs on April 26. Melendez, however, managed only one 
home run in the final eight games and fell one short of the record. 
</P>
<P>
Melendez's pursuit ended last Friday when San Marino beat St. Bernard, 7-3, in 
the quarterfinals of the Southern Section 2-A Division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
One-girl rotation: St. Bonaventure junior right-hander Kathy Morales pitched 36 
innings in four playoff games, including a five-hitter in a 5-1 loss to Big 
Bear in a semifinal Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Morales (15-3) pitched 15 innings and hit a solo home run to 
beat Westridge, 1-0. She then pitched a one-hitter to beat Azusa, 12-2, on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball camp: Coach Gary Anglin of Ventura College will stage a baseball camp 
for youngsters aged 7-15. The camp opens June 19 at Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
The camp will run four weeks throughout June and July. Registration is 
available for either one week or all four weeks of the camp. Anglin is 
accepting 50 applicants for each week of the camp. 
</P>
<P>
Former UCLA Coach Art Reichle will assist Anglin in teaching the fundamentals 
of hitting, fielding and pitching. The camp will also run June 26-30 and July 
10-14 and 17-21. Information: 805-654-6459.

Two mild earthquakes rumbled through San Bernardino and Riverside counties 
early today, awakening some residents but causing no damage or injuries, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The first quake, measuring magnitude 3.5, struck at 2:33 a.m. near Redlands. 
Five hours later and 25 miles away, a magnitude 3.0 quake rattled the Crestline 
area, Robert Finn of Caltech in Pasadena said, adding that it wasn't known 
whether the temblors were related. The 7:23 a.m. quake, located 10 miles north 
of San Bernardino and 60 miles east of Los Angeles, was barely felt.

BARRICADED VAN NUYS MAN KILLS HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A barricaded man who shot at police when they surrounded his Van Nuys house was 
found dead of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound today after the city's 
armored battering ram was used to crash into the residence to end a lengthy 
stand-off, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman, Gary Snyder, 45, was found dead about 6:30 a.m. in the home at 7500 
block of Decelis Place. About three hours earlier, police used the tank-like 
ram vehicle, which is ordinarily used during raids on fortified drug houses, to 
hit the house several times, leaving all but one rear bedroom of the small 
house destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Snyder was found under debris in the living room and appeared to 
have killed himself with a shotgun. Lt. Warren Knowles said it was unclear 
whether Snyder shot himself as the ram was hitting the house or before the 
vehicle was used. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Screaming for Help 
</P>
<P>
Knowles said the incident began about 8:45 p.m. Wednesday when officers 
investigated a report that a woman had run from the home screaming for help but 
was chased down by Snyder and forced back inside. 
</P>
<P>
Because neighbors told the officers that Snyder was known to have guns and had 
fired them in the house before, they used a patrol car's loudspeaker to order 
everyone in the house to come out. Two women and a man came out but Snyder 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
The Special Weapons and Tactics team was called to the scene and nearby homes 
were evacuated while streets were closed. After lengthy attempts to get Snyder 
to surrender, officers shot tear gas into the house. Police said Snyder then 
fired 10 shots but no one was struck. 
</P>
<P>
At 3 a.m., the motorized battering ram ram struck the house, crashing 
completely through the living room area. The vehicle repeatedly backed up and 
struck again along the front of the house.

The Interior Department ordered a strict fire-control plan for national parks 
and wilderness areas today, at least temporarily abandoning the "let it burn" 
philosophy that allowed fires to devastate thousands of acres in Yellowstone 
National Park last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The joint directive, embracing a task force report, was issued by Interior 
Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter, whose 
department has jurisdiction over national forests. 
</P>
<P>
The task force, which was called to review federal fire management policies 
after last summer's fires at Yellowstone, concluded that there are 
environmental benefits to allowing controlled fires, but that greater 
assurances must be shown that a fire cannot get out of control before it is 
allowed to burn.

Huntington Beach workers planned to bury a beached gray whale today, after 
marine biologists took a section of the head for study. 
</P>
<P>
"Our initial plan was to bury the whale (early) today, but there was 
considerable interest expressed by several marine life organizations," said 
Michael Beuerlein, Huntington Beach lifeguard supervisor. Marine biologists 
from the National Historical Society and the Los Angeles County Museum said 
they would like to analyze a section from the whale to determine why it died. 
</P>
<P>
Beuerlein said he spotted the whale in the surf at about 3 p.m. Wednesday after 
he noticed a large number of pelicans, sea gulls, and other marine birds flying 
over it about 2 1/2 miles north of the pier.

AUTOPSIES DONE ON ANAHEIM COUPLE

<P>
Autopsies were being performed this morning on the bodies of a man and woman 
found shot to death in their Anaheim apartment Wednesday afternoon, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Police Sgt. Chet Barry identified the victims as Louis Arturo Herrera, 
24, and Diane Patrice Swarbrick, 23. The autopsies should determine the time 
and cause of death, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have no suspects in the double homicide but are "out digging," 
Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
He said a neighbor discovered the bodies after the victims' two children -- a 
girl and boy, between the ages of 18 and 24 months -- wandered to a nearby 
apartment. (Story, Part II, Page 3.) 
</P>
<P>
Police were still trying to determine a motive for the homicides. It appeared 
that nothing was taken from the couple's apartment, Barry said.

Barbara Bush chose the appropriate country to break spontaneously into a 
rendition of "I'm a Little Teapot," gestures and all. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush was inspired by a colorful paper teapot thrust at her by an eager 
child during the First Lady's only solo appearance in tea-loving Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush visited a day care center as well as classes in cooking, English and 
fashion design during a 75-minute visit to the Lambeth Institute's Strand 
Center, an adult education school. It is in Brixton, the poor south London area 
hit by anti-police riots four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know it?" asked Mrs. Bush, as she sang the classic English nursery 
rhyme about a teapot, short and stout. The First Lady shaped a spout with her 
left arm. 
</P>
<P>
British Education Secretary Kenneth Baker, who accompanied Mrs. Bush on the 
outing, smiled encouragingly. The 3-year-old children, perhaps too young, 
looked bewildered. 
</P>
<P>
The school's classes, mostly in primary education, attract an average of 2,000 
students a week to courses of varying length. About 65% come from "ethnic 
communities," according to the Education Department.

Rudy Linares, the distraught father who disconnected his comatose son's 
life-support system at gunpoint, was hospitalized early today after a drug 
overdose, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Cicero Police Deputy Supt. Steven Zalas said Linares, 23, told police he had 
taken some bad PCP "and he wanted his money back from the guy he bought it 
from." Linares refused to tell police who had sold him the drug "because then 
he can't buy it any more," Zalas added. 
</P>
<P>
When police asked him why he had taken the drug, Zalas said Linares responded, 
"What would you do if your son just died?" 
</P>
<P>
The overdose comes about two weeks after a grand jury declined to indict 
Linares on a murder charge in the death of his 15-month-old son, Samuel. The 
boy had been comatose nearly nine months after a freak accident in which he 
inhaled part of a balloon.

Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland took on the Pope today over the 
Roman Catholic Church's ban on contraception, questioning its wisdom in view of 
the spread of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Brundtland, known for her plain speaking, told Pope John Paul II of her concern 
during a half-hour meeting at the start of his first tour of Scandinavia, which 
is about 1% Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him a question which I think he will consider," she told Norwegian 
state radio after the talks. 
</P>
<P>
She said it concerned "the problems linked to the spread of AIDS . . . where 
religious attitudes to the use of contraceptives make it difficult to prevent 
the spread of the disease in countries where there are many Catholics." 
</P>
<P>
Asked how the Pope had responded, she replied: "I think he thought it was an 
interesting and difficult moral question. He said he would gladly study it more 
closely." 
</P>
<P>
Condoms have been widely recommended as helping to prevent infection by the 
AIDS virus, which kills by stripping the body of its natural defenses. The Pope 
has often spoken out against contraception and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
After the talks with Brundtland, the pontiff celebrated open-air Mass before a 
crowd of 10,000 in the grounds of Oslo's Akershus fortress. Organizers had 
expected double that number but rain apparently kept many away.

The new Soviet Parliament moved today to probe whether the Baltic republics 
willingly joined the Soviet Union after historian Roy Medvedev and other 
deputies charged Moscow had forcibly annexed Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia and 
then doctored the truth. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev supported setting up a commission to probe 
whether secret clauses in a 1939 pact with Nazi Germany assigned the three 
Baltic nations to Moscow, paving the way for annexation a year later. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev also revealed that West Germany had failed to come up with the 
original of the secret portions of the 1939 nonaggression treaty, also called 
the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, after he requested it from Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
"The Baltic republics are stirred up by this issue. It is not an easy question, 
but we should not evade it," Gorbachev told the Congress of People's Deputies 
on the seventh day of its inaugural session. 
</P>
<P>
But the Kremlin chief said he doubted that the peoples of Lithuania, Estonia 
and Latvia had opposed joining the Soviet Union five decades ago.

Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood promised a Senate subcommittee today to 
take a closer look at buying the Pentagon more "off-the-shelf" products to save 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Atwood, who was General Motors' No. 3 official before accepting the No. 2 
Defense Department post, told the Government Affairs Committee's oversight 
subcommittee that he "strongly favors increased use of commercial products 
throughout the Department of Defense." 
</P>
<P>
Challenged by subcommittee Chairman Carl Levin (D-Mich.) to meet with private 
business leaders to review why some of them are declining to bid on government 
contracts, Atwood said, "I accept that . . . (although) a year ago I'd have 
been on the other side of the table" protesting that contract bidding 
requirements were too stringent and made it impossible to do business with the 
government.

Flight attendant Dimitra Liani, 34, said Papandreou's marriage to his American

Speaking in a radio interview from the living room of a luxury villa where she

<P>
"Margaret Papandreou is a woman who stood by the prime minister's side, a 
family was created and she always helped him. But this has ended. The cycle has 
closed, and we must accept this, as hard as it is," she said.

MAJOR RETAILERS POST LACKLUSTER SALES IN MAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's major retailers today posted lackluster May sales, and analysts 
said the results were consistent with the weakening in consumer demand that has 
accompanied the rise in credit costs this year. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers are shopping less because they are laying out more for mortgage 
payments and other installment debts than they did a year ago, said Jeffrey 
Feiner, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the May tallies varied depending on the type of retailer. Department 
stores and other chains specializing in women's apparel fared better than 
general merchandisers. Some retailers' results appeared better than they really 
were because they were being compared with relatively low volumes a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., the nation's biggest merchant, said its sales in the 
four weeks ended May 27 rose 5.3% to $2.5 billion from $2.38 billion in May, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Wal-Mart, currently ranked No.3, said its May sales rose 25% to $2.03 billion 
from 1988's $1.63 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Second-ranked K mart Corp. reported a sales increase of 2.5% for the four weeks 
ended May 24 to $2.19 billion from the previous year's $2.14 billion. 
</P>
<P>
One of the stronger performances was turned in by Carter Hawley Hale Stores 
Inc., which reported its May sales rose 7.3% to $192.9 million from $179.8 
million a year ago.

W. GERMAN CENTRAL BANK REJECTS INTEREST RATE HIKE

<P>
West Germany's central bank decided against raising interest rates today 
despite the battering the mark has taken from the surging dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar retreated after the Bundesbank, meeting in West Berlin, said it will 
leave credit policies unchanged. The U.S. currency had edged up all morning 
because of a growing belief that the Bundesbank would not be panicked and raise 
its discount and Lombard rates. 
</P>
<P>
Confirmation that dealers had forecast correctly brought some sell orders to 
the market and the dollar settled around 1.9850 marks about half an hour after 
the news. It had been quoted at 1.9910 shortly before the announcement and at 
1.9786 at the start of business in London. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany raised its discount and emergency funding Lombard rates by half a 
percentage point to 4.5% and 6.5% respectively on April 20. That unexpected 
move was aimed at squeezing credit to fight inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The central bank had been expected to consider another raise today to defend 
the mark against the dollar, which has risen more than 10% this year. 
</P>
<P>
Japan hiked its discount rate three-quarters of a percentage point to 3.25% 
this week to slow the dollar's rise against the yen. Britain upped its base 
rate from 13% to 14% May 24 to guard the pound. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling continued under pressure today because of ebbing faith in the British 
economy, with inflation at an annual 8% and a swelling trade deficit. The pound 
dipped from a high of 1.58 marks to trade about 1.5650 in London after the 
Bundesbank announcement. 
</P>
<P>
It was the dollar's rise last week above 2 marks for the first time in 2 1/2 
years that prompted speculation that Bonn authorities would want to support the 
mark and stave off the effects of imported inflation.

Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos today unveiled strict new regulations 
designed to crack down on schools that are turning out large numbers of 
delinquent borrowers and contributing to a rising burden for taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Under the rules, schools with default rates above 60% will be subject to 
limitation, suspension or termination from the government's massive student 
loan program. 
</P>
<P>
Schools with 40% to 60% of their students failing to pay back loans must reduce 
the figure by 5% a year or face the same penalties. 
</P>
<P>
All vocational schools, regardless of their default rates, must provide 
information on completion and job placement rates to all prospective students. 
</P>
<P>
Vocational schools are considered prime offenders in the default problem, which 
is expected to cost taxpayers $1.8 billion this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We must weed out unethical schools and other program participants whose sole 
purpose is to profit at the expense of our students and taxpayers," Cavazos 
said. "Today, we are taking decisive action against those who cheat our 
citizens, those who promise to educate but deliver only a debt." 
</P>
<P>
Cavazos said it was never intended that 37 cents out of every dollar spent on 
the student loan program would go to cover defaulted loans.

BLOCKBUSTER ANEMIA DRUG WINS APPROVAL;

THOUSAND OAKS FIRM GETS OK ON KIDNEY COMPOUND

The Food and Drug Administration today approved an anti-anemia drug made by 
Amgen Inc., giving the California firm an edge in the race to market what some 
analysts are calling biotechnology's next blockbuster drug. 
</P>
<P>
The approval of erythropoietin, or EPO, which would treat anemia linked to 
kidney diseases and other ailments, also should take Amgen out of the red and 
bring it back to profitability, company officials and industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"Amgen is ready to roll," said Viren Mehta, an analyst at S. G. Warburg. "It 
will probably have a significant number of dialysis centers stocked within a 
number of days." 
</P>
<P>
Mehta said he expects about a quarter of the nation's kidney dialysis patients 
who depend on transfusions will use the drug. "There will be a dramatic impact 
on the bottom line," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA said Amgen's EPO will be classified as an orphan drug in a program for 
medicines aimed at rare diseases. It will thus be entitled to special tax 
breaks. EPO is the first Amgen product to be approved by the federal drug 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Will Return to Profitability' 
</P>
<P>
"We will return to profitability as a result of this action," Amgen Chief 
Executive Gordon Binder told reporters after the FDA announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Shares in the Thousand Oaks-based firm jumped $1.625 to $41.75 in 
over-the-counter trading as investors agreed the FDA's approval would reverse 
the company's fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be fabulous," said analyst Stuart Weisbrod at 
Prudential-Bache Securities. He said the drug could lead to an explosion in 
Amgen's sales to as much as $80 million this year, compared with only $2.7 
million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
EPO has been described by some analysts as biotechnology's next blockbuster 
drug because it has many potential uses, including the treatment of anemia 
associated with cancer chemotherapy and use of the AIDS drug AZT. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers say the drug reverses a debilitating form of anemia that is often 
triggered by dependence on an artificial kidney. About 100,000 Americans with 
severe kidney disease, and 300,000 other people around the world, require 
dialysis by an artificial kidney to remain alive. About three-quarters of these 
suffer from anemia and are thought to be candidates for EPO therapy.

"He is right on schedule for where we want him to be. He may be ahead of 
schedule. I have no reservations about Troy possibly being the starter in that 
first game."

Richest Rookie in History 
</P>
<P>
Aikman, the richest rookie in NFL history, has a six-year, $11-million 
contract. But after practices, he eats $3 sandwiches as he sits on the locker 
room's carpeted floor, brown-bagging it with offensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman has earned his teammates' respect on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't come in here with an attitude like 'Clear out. I'm the big cheese,' 
" linebacker Garry Cobb said. "He's working as hard as anybody. There's no hot 
dog in him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going out there every day, trying to do everything within his power to 
improve and learn. That's the kind of attitude that everybody respects." 
</P>
<P>
Aikman will be the first to agree that much remains to be done. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to work on everything, not one particular area," he said. "Right now, 
being in shorts is a whole different ballgame than it is when you put the pads 
on. When I get the pads on, I'll be able to learn a lot more about myself and 
my progress." 
</P>
<P>
He has rejected all but a few requests for endorsements and personal 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to receive a lot of attention until I prove myself on the field, 
and right now I don't think I'm worthy of receiving that attention," Aikman 
said. "So I've backed off." 
</P>
<P>
Players are praising the strength of Aikman's arm and his ability to learn 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"He can throw just about any kind of ball," cornerback Everson Walls said. "He 
can throw it deep. He can lay it up and put some touch on it. He can throw it 
short. He can get it outside."

PITINO VOWS TO KEEP WINNING IN KENTUCKY 
</P>

Rick Pitino, who has made a career of rebuilding basketball programs, vowed 
today to immediately turn around the downtrodden Kentucky program, the 
winningest in college basketball history. 
</P>
<P>
"When people say we can't be competitive, let's prove them wrong. And that's 
what we're about to do," Pitino said. "It's been a tradition with me to say, 
'We will win, and we will win right away.' " 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky's Athletics Board unanimously approved Pitino's hiring earlier today. 
He was given a seven-year contract with a base salary of $105,000, but that 
will grow with income from coaches shows and endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lateral move economically," said Pitino, who resigned as coach of the 
New York Knicks on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Pitino will spend his first three years dealing with NCAA probation -- 
including a two-year ban on postseason tournament play and no live television 
next season -- for recruiting violations under Coach Eddie Sutton, who resigned 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
"The sanctions and probation just make it tougher," Pitino said. "But we will 
overcome all obstacles to make Kentucky basketball rich again." 
</P>
<P>
He warned boosters to keep their enthusiasm in the stands. "Come to the games 
and cheer as loud as you can. But stay away from our practices; stay away from 
my players," he said.

AGASSI AND LENDL WIN AT FRENCH OPEN;

Andre Agassi led a U.S charge into the third round of the French Open today, 
but the favorite for the men's title, Ivan Lendl of Czechoslovakia, moved 
toward peak clay-court form on the second leg of his bid for the Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi, the No. 5 seed, outclassed Italy's Paolo Cane 6-2, 6-2, 6-3 on Center 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
But the top-seeded Lendl, the Australian Open champion, fared even better, 
destroying Derrick Rostagno of the United States 6-1, 6-3, 6-1 as he swept 
toward a fourth French crown. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Too Much for Italian 
</P>
<P>
Agassi's solid service, heavy ground strokes and court speed were too much for 
the Italian. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi also defeated Cane in the first round in Paris last year and went on to 
reach the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"Although I beat Cane easily last year, it was all kind of new to me, and it 
wasn't until the quarterfinals that I felt great," Agassi said. "Last year, 
being in the semifinal was enough for me. Now I feel I have the mind to go all 
the way. That creates a whole different level of tennis." 
</P>
<P>
Agassi was joined in round three by Michael Chang of Placentia, who hammered 
Pete Sampras of Rancho Palos Verdes 6-1, 6-1, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, who reached the round of 16 at last year's U.S. Open as a 16-year-old, 
took just 1 hour, 37 minutes on the day's opening Center Court match to beat 
his fellow 17-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Mats Wilander, putting a disastrous year behind him, scored 
another straight-set victory today and surged into the third round. 
</P>
<P>
The Swede, only seeded fourth after a season in which he has failed to win a 
tournament and has lost to a succession of unheralded opponents, beat Diego 
Perez of Uruguay 6-3, 7-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Lori McNeil of the United States became the fifth women's seed to bow out of 
the tournament when she was upset 6-2, 6-1 by Manon Bollegraf of the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had an off day," McNeil said. "She forced me a lot and rushed me. I 
never settled down." 
</P>
<P>
Manuela Maleeva, the No. 6 seed, reached round three by beating Sandra 
Wasserman of Belgium 6-3, 5-7, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
In doubles play, top-seeded Americans Rick Leach and Jim Pugh bowed out in the 
first round today without so much as a fight. 
</P>
<P>
Leach and Pugh, who won the Australian Open and Nabisco Masters titles last 
year when they surged to the No. 1 spot in the world rankings, were beaten by 
Ricki Osterthun of West Germany and Alex Antonitsch of Austria 6-2, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Leach was too disappointed to attend the post-match news conference, but Pugh 
summed up the feelings of both players. 
</P>
<P>
"It was probably the worst match we have ever played," he said. "Usually we 
fight to the last point, but here we went down very early."

PANEL DROPS COCAINE CASE AGAINST 5 HORSE TRAINERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Accusations against D. Wayne Lukas, Laz Barrera and three other thoroughbred 
trainers alleging the presence of cocaine in horses they train were dismissed 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Foote, secretary of the California Horse Racing Board, announced at a 
news conference at Hollywood Park that the decision had been made by the CHRB 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Barrera and Lukas, accusations were dropped against Barrera's 
son, Albert; Anthony J. Hemmerick, and Bryan Webb. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Accusations We Cannot Prove' 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to charge people with accusations we cannot prove," Foote said. 
</P>
<P>
Foote said that the cocaine presence originally identified in the horses was in 
the billionths-of-a-gram range. 
</P>
<P>
Still pending is the case against Roger Stein, the first trainer to be accused. 
Deputy Atty. Gen. Patricia Esgro said at the news conference that it was 
"inappropriate to discuss the Stein case," which continues in litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Esgro also said that it would be incorrect within the evidence, circumstances 
or tests to draw parallels in the individual cases. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy began last fall when the Board of Stewards at the Santa Anita 
Oak Tree meeting suspended Stein for 180 days and imposed a $2,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Laboratory tests indicated cocaine after a Stein horse, Emperor's Turn, 
finished second in Oak Tree's first race on Oct. 23, the CHRB said. 
</P>
<P>
Under racing's "trainer's responsibility rule," the trainer is responsible for 
whatever happens to an animal under his control. 
</P>
<P>
Stein, 35, vigorously denied the charge, won an injunction and has a Superior 
Court appeal pending June 22. 
</P>
<P>
Stein also has pending a civil suit against Truesdail Laboratories of Tustin, 
the CHRB's official lab, asking in excess of $25 million damages.
