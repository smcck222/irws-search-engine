DANIELS' TROT IS ONE FOR OLD TEAM'S SAKE; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: FORMER RED HOMERS IN 10TH IN OPENER OF IMPORTANT SERIES AS DODGERS 
END THREE-GAME LOSING STREAK, 2-1.

There was something Kal Daniels had secretly been dying to show the Cincinnati 
Reds since they traded him to the Dodgers last July 18. On Thursday night, in 
the 10th inning, after hitting a breaking pitch from Norm Charlton into the 
left-field seats, he finally got his chance. 
</P>
<P>
So, how about this new home-run trot? 
</P>
<P>
Daniels' leadoff homer gave the Dodgers a 2-1 victory in front of 39,421 at 
Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just my home-run trot for the 1990s," Daniels said with a smile after 
his stroll around the bases and into the waiting hugs of teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Add his first-inning sacrifice fly, and it wasn't a bad reunion for a guy 
making his first appearance against the Reds since the trade. It was also nice 
start for the Dodgers in their first series against the National League West 
leaders, whose margin over the Dodgers was cut to eight games. 
</P>
<P>
All of which led Lenny Harris, who was traded with Daniels for pitcher Tim 
Leary and infielder Mariano Duncan, to compare Daniels' trot to a walk of 
redemption. 
</P>
<P>
"This was so big for Kal," said Harris, who scored the Dodgers' other run in 
the first inning after a double and is seven for 17 against his former 
teammates. "Last year, when he couldn't play against the Reds because he was 
hurt, it was terrible for him. He could not even sit in the dugout, he was so 
mad. You could tell from the look on his face that he was thinking like, 'Hey, 
wait until next year.' " 
</P>
<P>
Daniels, who leads the Dodgers with nine homers and 29 runs batted in, 
confirmed that it is indeed a new year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm friends with everybody over there, but once we get between the lines, I'm 
a Dodger and they are the Reds . . . and we're enemies," Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, at least one Red talked like it. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what happened today, those guys don't have a chance," said Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
And thus began the season's 18-game series between what could be the West's top 
two teams, with dramatics and histrionics and, oh yes, great pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels made a winner of relief pitcher Don Aase, who threw two shutout innings 
for the bullpen's fifth victory this season. Aase followed starter Mike Morgan, 
the Dodger veteran who engaged in a pitching duel with Jack Armstrong, the 
National League's newest pitching star. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, who entered with an 8-1 record and 1.61 earned-run average, gave up 
one run on five hits in 8 1/3 innings. Morgan allowed one unearned run on six 
hits in eight innings. It was a night when they showed their survival 
instincts, as together they allowed 22 baserunners. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a big, big game," Morgan said. "We just got swept in Pittsburgh, and 
now we're playing a team that does everything good. . . . This was a big, big 
win." 
</P>
<P>
The outcome capped a big -- and bad -- day for the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson arrived from his week-long rehabilitation assignment at triple-A 
Albuquerque with soreness in his left knee. It was not serious, but he could 
not be activated and placed in the lineup as hoped. He will still probably join 
the team by the end of this weekend series. 
</P>
<P>
Then, less than two hours before the game, the Dodgers received more bad news, 
when Eddie Murray discovered his strained left hamstring was too sore to allow 
him to start. Dodger coach Bill Russell tore down the blue lineup card from the 
dugout wall and filled in a new one, with Mike Sharperson starting at first 
base. 
</P>
<P>
But not to worry. Morgan entered the game as the staff's ace, with a 
team-leading six wins, three shutouts and four complete games. But none of his 
nine starts matched this one. He had help from Mike Scioscia, who had one of 
his best nights of the season behind the plate by throwing out all three 
runners who attempted to steal second base. 
</P>
<P>
After retiring the first three Reds, Morgan allowed his only run in the second, 
and only after Duncan led off with a grounder that Alfredo Griffin threw into 
the dirt for an error. Joe Oliver singled, then Armstrong bunted the runners to 
second and third. From there, Duncan easily scored on Chris Sabo's grounder to 
shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
But from there, Morgan became even tougher. The Reds had four more good chances 
to score, and he stopped them all. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was Armstrong, who has stunned baseball with his pitching skill this 
season after two poor big league years during which he merely threw the ball 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers scored a run in their first chance against him in the first inning, 
but nothing more. After Harris led off with a double, he was bunted to third by 
Stan Javier. Armstrong then induced Daniels into a line drive to left that 
diving Eric Davis caught. It scored Harris, but it was also the second out, and 
Hubie Brooks ended the inning with a grounder. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth, the Dodgers had runners on first and second with one out. Red 
Manager Lou Piniella went to the mound, but left Armstrong in, and a hobbling 
Murray grounded into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Murray was not scratched from the lineup until around 5:30 p.m. Friday, 
but his sore left hamstring was nothing new. It was the same injury that forced 
him to miss four consecutive starts last week in Chicago and St. Louis. He 
aggravated it again in Pittsburgh this week but kept playing. "It hasn't been 
getting any better," said Murray, who was five for 15 on the trip with four 
RBIs despite the pain. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Searage threw off a mound for the first time Thursday since being placed on 
the disabled list May 14 because of elbow tightness. The rest and 
rehabilitation has apparently worked. "It felt great to throw without pain," 
Searage said of his 10-minute workout. "It felt so good, I just kept throwing, 
and Perry (pitching coach Ron Perranoski) finally had to tell me to watch 
myself." Searage, who is eligible to come off the disabled list, hopes to throw 
a couple of simulated games next week and return to the bullpen within 10 days. 
The Dodgers will benefit from having a second left-handed reliever, 
particularly since Searage has struck out nine in 9 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Former Red Kal Daniels spoke from experience about one of the Dodger advantages 
in this series. "They are starting their first West Coast trip here, and that 
makes it a good time to get them," Daniels said. "I remember, those West Coast 
trips could be brutal. It takes you a couple of days to get used to the time 
change." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers will have one of their biggest pregame ceremonies tonight when they 
honor 4,000 top local elementary and junior high school students as winners in 
the IBM/Dodgers Student Pennant race. The game is sold out.

SEGOTA, SOCKERS AWAKEN

<P>
For weeks, the questions have hit him like slaps in face, one after another. 
</P>
<P>
What's wrong? Why aren't you shooting more? Why aren't you scoring? 
</P>
<P>
Branko Segota has been unable to deliver any answers; what's more, he has been 
unable to deliver many goals. Coach Ron Newman would defend him, telling 
everyone that Segota was doing other things to help the Sockers. 
</P>
<P>
But who was kidding whom? What Branko Segota does best is score goals that 
widen people's eyes. And he hasn't done much of that in these MISL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
That changed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers defeated the Baltimore Blast, 4-3, to even the best-of-seven 
championship series, 1-1, before 6,552 in Baltimore Arena. Credit can certainly 
be given to forward Rod Castro, who took a pass from Paul Wright midway through 
the fourth quarter, spun around forward Carl Valentine and sent the ball into 
the left corner to tie it at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
This was also a consistent team effort by the Sockers, who stayed patient and 
kept running and yelling at each other until the job was finished. 
</P>
<P>
But mainly, it was a night when the clock turned back to last year or the year 
before or, really, any previous year in Segota's nine-year career. 
</P>
<P>
It happened this way: 
</P>
<P>
With just more than three minutes to play and the score tied, Segota took a 
pass from midfielder Brian Quinn and put his left foot on the ball. His back 
was to the goal. Defender Bruce Savage stood about an inch behind him. 
</P>
<P>
A second or two ticked off the clock, and then Segota shoved the ball a few 
feet to his right, turned and drilled a 15-footer past goalie Scott Manning. 
Savage could only watch while lying on his back. 
</P>
<P>
When Segota scored, both teams had a man in the penalty box. Blast forward 
Peter Ward had been called for tripping, and 35 seconds later, Socker goalie 
Zoltan Toth was called for holding. The Sockers managed to kill the remainder 
of the power play after Segota's goal with Blast midfielder Billy Ronson 
serving as the sixth attacker. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with 49 seconds left, Quinn swerved around Ronson to put in an insurance 
goal. Blast forward Domenic Mobilio scored with four seconds to play on a ball 
that deflected into the net off the foot of defender Ralph Black. The Sockers 
killed the final seconds on the kickoff and now will have a more relaxed trip 
back to San Diego, site of the next three games. 
</P>
<P>
The goal and victory were therapeutic for Segota, who has had his fill of a 
slump in which he has scored just three goals in the first 10 playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
"We know what's been going on," Segota said. "I wasn't playing well. I wasn't 
hiding it. Everybody goes through that. My concentration wasn't there." 
</P>
<P>
The leading playoff scorer in Sockers' history was even hearing a few boos. 
</P>
<P>
"People forget so easily," he said. "One day they love you, the next day they 
hate you. I'm not finished by far. I've got a lot of championships in me yet." 
</P>
<P>
All this was encouraging to Segota's teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"That killer look is back in his eyes," defender Kevin Crow said. "You can tell 
by his step." 
</P>
<P>
If Segota can contribute for the remainder of the series the way he did 
Thursday, Baltimore will have its hands full. Up to now, Quinn has been playing 
with much of the team riding on his back. He has 20 post-season points, 
compared to Segota's eight. 
</P>
<P>
"Branko is a special player," Quinn said. "I expect him to score every game. 
When he decides to play, it makes it so much easier for every one of us." 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore did a good job of making things easier for the Sockers Thursday, 
settling into a defensive style and shunning opportunities to push the ball 
forward after taking a 2-1 lead on Mobilio's goal 2:32 into the third quarter. 
The teams were even, 1-1, at halftime after power-play goals by Blast 
midfielder Tim Wittman and Socker midfielder Waad Hirmez. 
</P>
<P>
Just before Segota's goal, while the Sockers were on the power play, Toth came 
out of the box to challenge Wittman on the left boards. There was a collision, 
and when Toth got up, he saw the referee waving a blue card. He thought to 
himself: "Great, now we have a five-three advantage." 
</P>
<P>
But the call was on him. 
</P>
<P>
"He jumped on my back," Toth said. "So I'm going to lift him off. As I'm 
lifting him off, I saw the blue card. I never touched him, but he fell on my 
neck." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, Segota made everything all right. Remember, this is how last year's 
series also started, the Sockers losing the opener after leading and then 
winning Game 2 by a single goal. The Sockers accomplished what they set out to 
do in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's up to us," Hirmez said. "We're going home. We've just got to play 
smart soccer." 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore Coach Kenny Cooper thinks his team has a better idea about how to 
handle this loss than they did a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a different feeling in the locker room than when we lost last year in 
Game 2," Cooper said. "Last year, we were perplexed. I came into the locker 
room tonight, and they were fine. I just guarantee we'll bring the series back 
to Baltimore."

PADRES KEEP IT GOING; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: FRED LYNN'S PINCH SINGLE IN THE SEVENTH BEATS THE BRAVES, 2-1. IT IS 
THE PADRES' FOURTH VICTORY IN A ROW AND SIXTH IN SEVEN GAMES.

<P>
The Padres came home Thursday night counting victories and Fred Lynn's pinch 
hits instead of clubhouse meetings and brawls. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn's pinch single in the seventh drove home the winning run as the Padres 
defeated Atlanta, 2-1, in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. They have now won four 
in a row and six of their past seven. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn has reached base in each of his past three pinch-hit attempts -- all this 
week -- with two singles and a walk. 
</P>
<P>
"Fred's been great," Padre Manager Jack McKeon said. "I talked to him at the 
beginning of the season, and I told him his role could be anything from a 
regular to platoon to pinch-hitting. And I talked with him (Wednesday). 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'I'll do whatever you want. I'm here to help win. Don't worry about 
me.' That's a great attitude." 
</P>
<P>
On this night, Lynn wasn't the only hero. Greg Harris pitched two perfect 
innings -- striking out four of the six batters he faced -- for his third save, 
his second in two nights. He now has eight strikeouts in two games and has 
struck out seven of the past batters 11 he has faced. And this is a guy who had 
a sore elbow after Sunday's brawl in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel pretty good," Harris said. "My elbow feels sound, and I feel like I 
have decent stuff." 
</P>
<P>
And on the subject of good, strong arms, how about catcher Benito Santiago? He 
threw two Braves out as they attempted to steal second and picked another off 
first. 
</P>
<P>
"He put on a clinic out there for a while, didn't he?" McKeon said. "That's so 
important to a pitcher, too." 
</P>
<P>
What a night for the Padres, who trailed, 1-0, after six innings. The winning 
run came when Lynn, pinch-hitting for starting pitcher Dennis Rasmussen, 
singled in the seventh to drive home Phil Stephenson. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn got quite an ovation, but before that, the 13,644 fans weren't quite sure 
what to make of it all. They seemed more confused than anything about the 
events of the past two weeks, during which comments by Mike Pagliarulo 
concerning an unnamed, supposedly selfish Padre touched off several days of 
team soul-searching and meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Gwynn, who thought Pagliarulo was referring to him, was cheered. 
Pagliarulo received a mixed reaction each time he batted -- many cheers with a 
smattering of boos. Gwynn was booed when he flied to left with the bases loaded 
in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
But, remember, this is San Diego. The fans were so worked up that they dropped 
a giant beach ball into left field just before the start of the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Smith held the Padres in check for six innings, but they finally scored 
two in the seventh -- after loading the bases with none out in the sixth and 
failing to score. 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo led off the seventh with a walk, and Stephenson followed with a 
single to left, where it was turned into an adventure by Lonnie Smith. Smith 
bobbled the ball after a hop and dropped it, allowing Pagliarulo to take third 
and Stephenson to go to second. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was that Pagliarulo strained a hamstring rounding third, so Shawn 
Abner ran for him. 
</P>
<P>
Abner scored on Garry Templeton's fly to right. Up stepped Lynn, who had never 
batted against Pete Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"As a pinch-hitter, I'm looking for the first available pitch to hit," Lynn 
said. "I don't even know if it was a strike tonight." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't much matter. 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo said his hamstring "just kind of stiffened up" and that he didn't 
think it was serious. McKeon said he may give Pagliarulo the day off today. If 
that happens, Lynn may start, because the Braves are starting right-hander John 
Smoltz. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Lynn has been relegated to pinch-hitting because Pagliarulo's 
hot bat has caused McKeon to move Bip Roberts to left. 
</P>
<P>
But Lynn is happy, and he remembers that conversation with McKeon. 
</P>
<P>
"I told (McKeon) when I came over here I'd do whatever he needs to win," Lynn 
said. "Now, my role is on the bench. You look out there, and it seems like 
everyone is hitting .300. It's hard to fault the logic in what we're doing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all mental. If you accept it mentally and know it's the right thing for 
you and the club, there should be no problems. I think it's easier for an older 
guy to pinch-hit than a younger guy. Every youngster thinks he's better than 
whoever's out there. And that's the way it should be. Older guys look for what 
their role is and accept it. If you don't, you're looking for another job." 
</P>
<P>
Santiago, meanwhile, helped get two outs about two minutes apart in the third. 
Ron Gant led off with a single, but Santiago caught him at second on an 
attempted steal. Jeff Treadway followed with a walk, and Lonnie Smith flied to 
center. With Jim Presley at the plate, Santiago then picked Treadway off first. 
</P>
<P>
End of inning. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not the end of the Braves' running game. In the fifth, Blauser led 
off with a single. He tried to steal second. He was caught. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Padres had trouble kicking it into gear. In the sixth, Rasmussen, 
Roberts and Alomar singled consecutively to load the bases with none out. 
</P>
<P>
That left all kinds of scoring possibilities. Here came Gwynn . . . 
</P>
<P>
Soft fly to left. 
</P>
<P>
That was OK, because here came Joe Carter . . . Strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it was getting serious. Up stepped Santiago . . . 
</P>
<P>
High fly to right. 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen stood helplessly on third, 90 feet away from tying the game in which 
he was pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were going to break it open in the sixth," McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was Pete Smith. The Padres couldn't figure him out. He came into 
the game tied for second in the National League with three complete games. 
Still, he was just 4-3 with a 4.30 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen (5-2) started slowly but got better as he went along. He allowed a 
run and five hits in the first three innings but then held the Braves to one 
hit until he left at the end of the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Harris came on and didn't allow a hit in the eighth or ninth. 
</P>
<P>
In seven innings, Rasmussen walked two and struck out four. He has now won four 
of his past five decisions. And he's not doing badly at the plate, either. His 
single Thursday improved his average to .368 (seven for 19). 
</P>
<P>
The Braves scored a run in the second but missed a chance to score another when 
Blauser was thrown out trying to stretch a double into a triple. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Justice led off the second with a single to center, and Blauser followed 
with a drive into the gap in left center. Justice scored, but Roberts threw to 
Alomar, who relayed to Pagliarulo at third in time to get Blauser by a step. 
</P>
<P>
So there were none out, but none on, either. Rasmussen struck out Greg Olson 
and got Pete Smith to ground to short to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Jack Clark took about 10 minutes of batting practice and said his 
sore back is feeling better. "Ten good minutes," he said. The only problem is 
that his recently fractured cheekbone set his timetable back an extra few days. 
"When you restart it up again, you don't know what to expect," he said. "What 
you've loosened up tightens back up." Clark suffered a herniated disc May 5 in 
Chicago and then was hit in the face with a thrown baseball during batting 
practice May 25. "I'll probably have a little bit of pain over the course of 
the whole year, especially in my back," he said. "As long as I don't hurt it so 
I'm out for an extended period of time." . . . Life on the road: The Padres 
returned from Philadelphia at 3 a.m. Thursday after a 5-hour 47-minute flight, 
and both Manager Jack McKeon and pitching coach Pat Dobson brought the flu 
home. McKeon said he was sick all afternoon Thursday but made it to the 
stadium. But Dobson, was forced to take the day off. Coach Greg Riddoch ran the 
normal pre-series meeting for pitchers and catchers in Dobson's absence. . . . 
McKeon said Amos Otis will coach first base, and Riddoch will remain in the 
dugout indefinitely. "I've had good luck with it," McKeon said. "I'm not 
changing it now." . . . Tuesday's rain-out in Philadelphia has been rescheduled 
as part of a doubleheader Saturday, Sept. 1, at Veterans Stadium. . . . 
Tuesday's Houston-Padres game has been moved back to 7:35 p.m. to accommodate 
ESPN. . . . Add McKeon to the list of people who think the lockout-shortened 
spring training is contributing to slow starts by several pitchers. "The good 
guys are not as sharp as usual," McKeon said. "Guys like (Mike) Scott, (Rick) 
Reuschel, (Greg) Maddux, (Dwight) Gooden. . . . I think it's because they 
didn't get enough time. I don't think you can go less than five weeks. The big 
thing is game action for pitchers. This year, we got 14 or 15 innings in for 
pitchers, and that was all. And if you try to get your starters ready, you 
don't get any work in for the bullpen." . . . The Padres were 4-5 against 
Atlanta last year in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium and 7-2 in Atlanta. . . . 
Saturday is Sports Bag Night, and general admission tickets are on sale on a 
reserved-seat basis.

<P>
Buck Williams did not merely strip Tom Chambers of the ball Thursday night. He 
took away the Phoenix Suns' fading playoff hopes, obliterated the notion of 
home-court dominance and ended 13 seasons of Portland Trail Blazer frustration 
since their last trip to the NBA championship series. 
</P>
<P>
In one stealthy move, Williams did all that. The Trail Blazer forward's steal 
with eight seconds left, the last of several late and crucial defensive plays, 
enabled Portland to secure a 112-109 victory over the Suns in Game 6 of the 
Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
Finally breaking through on the road, after losing two previous times at 
Veterans Memorial Coliseum, the Trail Blazers felt it fitting that the victory 
that will send them to the championship series for the first time since the 
1976-77 season was made possible by tough defense in a close game. 
</P>
<P>
It was the way the Trail Blazers won all four games, the first three coming at 
home. Even though the Suns were without point guard Kevin Johnson, who sat out 
the second half with a strained left hamstring, the Trail Blazers nonetheless 
again made all the big plays at big times. 
</P>
<P>
None was bigger than Williams' steal. Portland led, 110-109, lead with 23 
seconds left, but Phoenix had the ball. Without Johnson to run the offense, the 
Suns' options were guard Jeff Hornacek, who had 36 points and played 
brilliantly, or Chambers, who had 17 points but played horrendously. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers, perhaps by process of elimination, was the choice. 
</P>
<P>
He had posted low against Williams and received an unobstructed pass from 
Hornacek. When Chambers turned and swung the ball near his ankles, Williams was 
crouched and ready to pounce. "I've been watching Tom Chambers do that all 
series," Williams said. "He tries to rake the ball, swing it around, to give 
himself space. I got very low and I was ready for him. I was picking my spots." 
</P>
<P>
Williams' timing was impeccable. After gaining possession of the ball, he 
slapped it to Clyde Drexler, who was fouled and made both free throws for a 
112-109 lead with 6.8 seconds left. Hornacek's desperation three-point shot at 
the buzzer failed, and the Trail Blazers had, well, stolen the Western 
Conference final series from the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, calling it a steal is high praise. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fitting we won it like this," Drexler said. "That's the way we won it all 
season." It was how the Trail Blazers overcame a 10-point third-quarter deficit 
to make it close in the fourth quarter and, eventually, overtake the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers, who had all of his 17 points in the second half, claimed he was 
fouled. In fact, he said Williams pushed him out of the post even before the 
steal. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just the way it goes," Chambers said. "I was posting up at the low post 
at the beginning of the play, and I wound up in three-point land. I didn't walk 
out there by myself." 
</P>
<P>
Before Williams' steal, Jerome Kersey blocked a shot by Hornacek. The Suns 
still had a 109-108 lead with about 40 seconds left when Hornacek saw an 
opening in the lane and drove. 
</P>
<P>
Kersey stepped in and blocked Hornacek's running one-hander. Then he deftly 
retrieved the ball and passed to Drexler to start the fast break. Kersey 
finished the break with a layup and gave Portland a 110-109 lead with 27 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"(Hornacek) had a lot of rotation on that shot; it was kind of a lob," Kersey 
said. "I just wanted to get a hand on it." 
</P>
<P>
Trail Blazer hands were everywhere. Their strong defensive play enabled them to 
win the series despite making barely more than 40% of their shots. 
</P>
<P>
"When the game was on the line, defensively we did what we had to do," said 
Portland guard Terry Porter, who had 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sun Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons: "I wanted the ball in Tom Chambers' hands or 
Hornacek's hands, and we got it to them the last two plays. But Portland has 
great athletes, and they made great plays. Give Portland credit for that." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Kevin Johnson's absence in the second half adversely affected the 
Suns. Yet, with Hornacek making 11 of 22 shots and all 14 free-throw attempts, 
the Suns carried on quite well for at least one quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But even with Johnson earlier in the series, the Suns had been incapable of 
executing well enough to win close games. However, the Suns had beaten the 
Trail Blazers at home twice by a combined 46 points with Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, their spirits sank when he limped off the court with 2:54 left in 
the half, shortly after making a three-point play on a driving layup. 
</P>
<P>
"You can never overcome KJ's loss," said Sun swingman Dan Majerle, who had 22 
points through three quarters but was shut out from there. "They just kept 
chipping away at our lead. We tried to throw some points at them, and they just 
kept coming back." 
</P>
<P>
Given their five-game road playoff losing streak, many figured the Trail 
Blazers would have to go back to Portland to try to win the series. They were 
as concerned as anybody about their inability to win on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"We showed the rest of the country we could win on the road," said Drexler, who 
also had 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
"To some extent it's true, because we've been struggling on the road," Porter 
added. "But we knew we could. It was just a matter of executing. Whenever it 
gets down to a close game, we have about four or five go-to guys." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Trail Blazers will either go to Auburn Hills, Mich., to meet the 
Detroit Pistons in the finals or stay in Portland and host the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, they are happy for a few days off to rest and savor the achievement 
of advancing to the finals for the first time since Bill Walton wore a red 
beard and ate granola in the locker room.

<P>
EL SEGUNDO GOES FOR SECOND CONSECUTIVE 2-A CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This story began 10 years ago in El Segundo, on a rough patch of grass behind 
the center-field fence of Recreation Park, where a bunch of kids from the west 
side of town used to play Wiffle Ball in the long shadows of summer afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
It will end Saturday morning on the manicured turf of Anaheim Stadium, where 
the same boys -- most of whom play baseball for El Segundo High -- will take on 
San Marino for the Southern Section 2-A Division championship. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost incredible to see what they've become," said John Stevenson, El 
Segundo High's coach for 31 years. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all of El Segundo's players -- except for transfers Tate Seefried, Mark 
Lewis and Tony Bartolucci -- are home-grown or products of the city's Little 
League. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson watched them all play from day one because his son Eric, El Segundo's 
second baseman, grew up with most of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"I've coached high school all my years, so I'm used to seeing players come into 
school almost in finished form," Stevenson said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I first saw all these kids back when they were still learning to catch a 
ball and hold a bat. When they'd get hit by a pitch for the first time, they'd 
cry." 
</P>
<P>
In those early days, some of the kids already had the marks of excellence. 
</P>
<P>
Garret Quaintance was a perpetual all-star who crushed Wiffle Balls as a 10 
year old as well as he hits high school pitching today. 
</P>
<P>
Others developed more slowly -- like Jason Wayt, a 6-foot-4, left-handed 
pitcher who recently earned a baseball scholarship to Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Stevenson remembers Wayt as a "chubby little short kid" who used to have 
trouble getting down the first-base line in Little League. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember everyone used to rag on Jason because he was so slow," Eric 
Stevenson said. "But now he's pretty much a stud." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the boys still live within a three-block radius of each other. Rob 
Croxall, the team's ace pitcher, said their houses are all within a 
three-minute drive. 
</P>
<P>
Or -- back when they used other means of transportation -- about a six-minute 
bike ride. 
</P>
<P>
"This is such a small town, that we're almost like a fraternity," Croxall said. 
"Off the field, we're all buddies. We're really just a group of friends who 
play baseball together." 
</P>
<P>
Quaintance, El Segundo's catcher, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost everything we do revolves around all of us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Including, it seems, winning. Saturday, the Eagles (27-3) will have a chance to 
win the school's first back-to-back CIF titles since 1965-66. 
</P>
<P>
"This team doesn't have a weak spot anywhere," said Stevenson, whose 659 career 
victories make him California's winningest prep baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of El Segundo's batting order is fearsome, anchored by Quaintance 
(.441, six home runs, 41 runs batted in), the team's cleanup hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Seefried, whose 13 homers tie him for the Southern Section home run lead with 
Westlake's Mike Lieberthal and Fullerton's D. C. Olsen, bats ahead of 
Quaintance. Seefried leads El Segundo with a .473 average and a school-record 
50 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who bats second behind third baseman Brett Newell, is hitting .437 with 
five home runs and 36 RBIs. He is also one of the best fielding shortstops in 
Southern California. Newell, who is Stevenson's godson, is batting .421 with 35 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Stevenson said the Eagles don't need to depend on any one player for 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo proved that point with come-from-behind victories over St. Bernard 
in the Camino Real League final and Santa Clara in the first round of the 
playoffs. Both times, the winning rallies were started by the bottom of the 
order. 
</P>
<P>
Every El Segundo starter except Bartolucci (.292) is hitting above .300, 
including pitcher-first baseman Wayt (.426), Stevenson (.385), right fielder 
Kenny Talanoa (.349) and sophomore left fielder Jeff Poor (.354, five home 
runs). 
</P>
<P>
That's the main reason the Eagles set Southern Section season records for runs 
(358) and hits (370). The old mark for runs was set by Montclair Prep with 343 
in 1983, and the previous record for hits was 340 by Simi Valley in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo isn't all offense, however. The Eagles committed only 32 errors and 
their school-record 24 double plays is the sixth-highest total in Southern 
Section history. 
</P>
<P>
Plus Coach Stevenson has the luxury of having three first-rate pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Croxall, a right-hander who threw a three-hitter Tuesday in a 7-1 victory over 
St. Anthony, had a streak of 31 scoreless innings snapped in the team's 2-A 
playoff opener. He is 10-1 with a 0.96 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
Wayt is 8-1 with 53 strikeouts in 47.1 innings. Seefried, 7-1 with a 1.62 ERA, 
will start for El Segundo Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Tate is basically a great athlete who is doing some pitching for us," 
Stevenson said. "He may never pitch another game in his life after Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
Seefried will face a veteran San Marino lineup in a rematch of last year's 2-A 
final, won by El Segundo, 7-4, at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans (22-2-1) are led by right fielder Mark Ukropina (.474, five home 
runs, 41 RBIs) and third baseman Blair Slattery (.406). The speedy Alfonso 
Montoya plays center field. 
</P>
<P>
San Marino Coach Mickey McNamee said he will probably start right-hander Dan 
Giddings (6-1) against El Segundo. Left-hander Michael Wan (11-0), who pitched 
a complete game against Yucaipa in San Marino's 2-1 victory Tuesday, will be 
available for relief. 
</P>
<P>
McNamee said he was amazed that the two teams survived to meet in the final for 
the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball has got to be the most difficult sport to make the finals in," 
McNamee said. "So many things can happen. Not only do you have to be good, you 
have to have a little luck riding along with you." 
</P>
<P>
Despite San Marino's defeat last year, McNamee said revenge wouldn't be a 
motivating factor. 
</P>
<P>
"El Segundo's players aren't the bad guys," said McNamee, who has coached at 
San Marino for 27 years. "I've known Coach Stevenson for many years and I've 
always respected his teams. Our No. 1 motivation was to play in the finals 
again." 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo, which beat Millikan (a 5-A school) on a seventh-inning single by 
Wayt in the final of the Palos Verdes/Redondo tournament, probably has faced a 
tougher schedule this season than San Marino, but the Eagles might have some 
special motivation. 
</P>
<P>
For the long-time teammates, Saturday will be the last time most of them will 
play together. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Wayt said the friendships built over years of baseball and Wiffle Ball 
will never change. 
</P>
<P>
"In El Segundo, you always stay the same, until you leave town," Wayt said. 
"You don't really notice the years going by because you're with the same 
friends all the time." 
</P>

WCC: INITIAL SEASON GETS MIXED REVIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The West Coast Conference shortened its name this year and came up a bit short 
competitively, too. 
</P>
<P>
While Loyola Marymount's featured sports -- men's basketball and baseball -- 
had spectacularly good seasons, overall the WCC came up well short of its 
performance in the 1988-89 school year, when four men's basketball teams, one 
women's basketball team and two baseball teams advanced to postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola was the only school to represent the conference in NCAA playoffs in 
basketball and baseball. The only other sport in which the WCC distinguished 
itself on a national level was men's soccer, where Santa Clara (20-0-3) was 
ranked No. 1 and tied Virginia in the NCAA title game, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara didn't even win the conference title. The Broncos and Portland, 
which was also ranked in the top 10, tied at 4-0-1. Portland was awarded the 
title under league tiebreaker rules. 
</P>
<P>
Still it was less than a banner year for the WCC, which started the school year 
by streamlining its name from West Coast Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
In its last year as the WCAC, the conference saw four men's basketball teams 
win 20 or more games, with two teams advancing to the NCAAs and two more to the 
National Invitation Tournament, its best showing ever. And in baseball, 
Pepperdine and Loyola went to the NCAA regionals and Santa Clara won 40 games. 
All three earned national rankings. 
</P>
<P>
But this past season, only Loyola managed to gain national notoriety in 
basketball, again setting a national scoring record and having the nation's 
scoring leader in Bo Kimble. And after the low point of the season -- the March 
4 death of Hank Gathers during the conference tournament -- the Lions advanced 
to the NCAA final eight, the farthest a WCC team has gone since 1957. 
Pepperdine went to the NIT. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the previous season, though, three other WCC teams lost 20 games 
and a fourth lost 19. And most of the conference's marquee players -- Gathers 
and Kimble and Pepperdine's Tom Lewis and Dexter Howard -- don't return. 
Gathers finished as the WCC's career scoring leader with 2,723 points and 
Kimble finished second. Each surpassed former San Francisco star Bill 
Cartwright. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Portland won the most WCC titles this year with three -- men's 
and women's cross-country and soccer. (The WCC has not yet organized women's 
soccer.) 
</P>
<P>
Winning two apiece were Loyola (men's basketball, baseball) and Pepperdine 
(volleyball, women's tennis). San Diego won the men's tennis title, Santa Clara 
tied for soccer, USF won its seventh golf title in 10 years and St. Mary's 
repeated in women's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Lions' Share of Records: The Loyola Marymount baseball team, which had the 
third-best season in school history at 45-17, set several season and career 
school records. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Rick Mediavilla set school and WCC records by batting .416 with 112 
hits. His average topped Reggie Lambert's 1985 mark of .415, while the hits 
broke Don Sparks' 2-year-old record of 105. Mediavilla, who played in all but 
one game despite being beaned in the face, also tied the school record with 269 
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Miah Bradbury, who set a season record with 31 doubles as a junior, 
used up his eligibility with career records in hits (306), doubles (72), 
at-bats (846) and total bases (490). All four records had been held by 1986 
graduate Billy Bean. Bradbury finished with 36 home runs and 191 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Relief pitcher Darryl Scott, who won 31 games in his four-year career, finished 
with school records in games pitched (130) and saves (22). In his four seasons, 
Scott struck out 320 batters in 361 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Tony Kounas set a conference record for home runs with 10. 
</P>
<P>
End of an Era: After 11 years as sports information director and assistant 
athletic director at Loyola Marymount, Barry Zepel is resigning to pursue 
writing projects. Zepel, 36, oversaw Loyola's rise as a collegiate basketball 
and baseball power in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Zepel, who was tagged "Z-Man" by basketball Coach Paul Westhead, has been a 
fixture in the sports publicity field for 17 years, serving as sports 
information director at several Southland colleges, including Cal Poly Pomona, 
Cal State Northridge and Cal State Long Beach, before joining Loyola in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
His resignation is effective June 15. 
</P>
<P>
Stat of the Week: They didn't qualify as leaders because of limited 
appearances, but technically catcher Bradbury was Loyola Marymount's leading 
pitcher and pitcher Scott was the Lions' leading hitter. Bradbury made four 
pitching appearances, went 2-0 and gave up only one run in 12 innings for an 
earned-run average of 0.75. Pitchers rarely hit in college due to the 
designated hitter rule, but Scott singled in his only at-bat for a 1.000 
average.

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL TOUR VISITS HERMOSA; 
</P>
<P>
PROFESSIONAL VOLLEYBALL: TWO-DAY EVENT, WHICH STARTS SATURDAY, IS THE FOURTH OF 
16 STOPS ON THE TOUR. 
</P>

<P>
The faces might be familiar, but the pairings might throw you off when the 
Women's Pro Volleyball Assn. beach tour comes to the South Bay for the Hermosa 
Beach Open this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Hermosa event is the fourth of 16 stops on the tour. The two-day tournament 
will be held at the Hermosa Beach Pier, with opening matches Saturday at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The finals are scheduled for 2:30 p.m. Sunday. The top 32 teams in the WPVA, 
ranked by points, will compete in a double-elimination format for $25,000 in 
prize money. The first-place prize is $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Jackie Silva and Patty Dodd, the most successful on the 
beach last summer, split up in mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
Silva, a native of Rio de Janeiro who recently relocated to Redondo Beach, is 
considered the sport's top player. Silva and Orange County schoolteacher Janice 
Opalinski have teamed to win the first three events of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Silva, who anchored the Brazilian national indoor team for seven years and was 
on Brazil's Olympic team in 1980 and 1984, is the top prize winner on the tour 
the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
And while the purses for the women's events haven't reached the levels of the 
men's beach tour, the WPVA has expanded the circuit to Mexico and Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Silva earned $32,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd, 26, of El Segundo, is the wife of men's beach volleyball standout Mike 
Dodd. Originally from Bogota, Colombia, Dodd is a former UCLA player. 
</P>
<P>
She is teamed with Karolyn Kirby, twice a collegiate All-American at Utah State 
and a veteran of the Italian Professional League. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Dodd and Kirby have been a step behind Silva and Opalinski, 
finishing second at both the Arizona Open in Phoenix in April and at the Jag 
Santa Barbara Open May 13. 
</P>
<P>
Although Silva-Opalinski and Dodd-Kirby are the No. 1 and 2 seeded teams in the 
tournament, the San Diego County-based team of Lori Kotas and Gail Castro has 
also made an impact on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
Veterans Nina Matthies of Oxnard and Elaine Roque of Santa Barbara form another 
consistent team. Matthies, 36, is the tour's winningest active player with more 
than 100 victories. 
</P>
<P>
For the third consecutive year, ESPN will televise the finals. The one-hour 
telecast will be shown tape-delayed June 25 at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Admission to the Hermosa event, one of the most heavily attended stops on the 
tour, is free.

HAMPTON, RAST TO BE FETED BY SOCCER GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All-American midfielder Craig Hampton of Simi Valley High and former Royal 
standout Cam Rast will be honored at the Simi Valley Soccer Foundation's 
inaugural "Celebration of Excellence" dinner at Royal High on June 9. 
</P>
<P>
Rast is an NCAA All-American under Santa Clara soccer Coach Steve Sampson, who 
will be the keynote speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Information: 805-378-6751. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Wagner and his Moorpark College baseball staff will conduct a series of 
youth and adult baseball camps this summer. 
</P>
<P>

PILE FAILS TO GAIN FINAL IN DIVISION I TRACK MEET

<TEXT>
<P>
Lolita Pile of Cal State Northridge, the school record-holder in the women's 
triple jump, failed to qualify for the final of that event in the NCAA Division 
I meet at Duke University on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Pile, who jumped a wind-aided 41 feet 10 3/4 inches to place second in the 
Division II meet at Hampton (Va.) University last Saturday, leaped 39-10 in 
qualifying. The mark placed her 22nd among the 24 entrants. 
</P>
<P>
The top 12 advanced to the today's finals.

STATE TRACK AND FIELD CHAMPIONSHIPS; 
</P>
<P>
PRICE, NOON FACING THEIR FINAL CHANCES TO GO THE DISTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
University City High's Jerome Price needs 12 inches to break the National 
Federation of State High School Assns. long jump record. Fallbrook High's Brent 
Noon needs 10 1/4 inches to break the federation's shotput record. 
</P>
<P>
Both are seniors who are down to their last two chances with the state meet 
that begins today with preliminaries (3 p.m. for field events, 5 p.m. for 
track) at Cerritos College in Norwalk. The finals are Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Both Price and Noon say they remain confident. 
</P>
<P>
Price's best legal mark is 25-feet-5, just shy of the section record of 25-5 
1/4 set by San Diego High's Doyle Steele in 1966 and a little less than a foot 
short of the national record of 26-4 3/4 set at last year's California state 
meet by Tulare's James Stallworth. 
</P>
<P>
Price has gone on flights of 25-8 and 25-8 1/2 but with an illegal wind at his 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Price says he should benefit from no longer running the 100 and 200 meters and 
1,600-meter relay. He participated in those events all year but did not qualify 
for state in them. 
</P>
<P>
Noon has a best put of 76-2, 10 inches short of Michael Carter's 77-0 set in 
1979. Noon had been on a steady rise and appeared poised to break the record 
until three weeks ago, when he suffered a strained hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
He said he feels fine now and expects the excitement of the state meet to pump 
his adrenaline and, he hopes, push the 12-pound ball to new distances. 
</P>
<P>
Whether they break records, Noon and Price will be favored to win their events; 
both are state leaders. Noon also is going for first in the discus, in which he 
has a top mark of 199-7, second in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel's Allison Dring will contend for medals in the girls' 200 and 400. 
Dring's 200 time (24.43) is third best in the state, and her 400 time (54.29) 
is second. But Rio Mesa freshman Marion Jones, the state 400 leader, is 
forgoing that race to concentrate on the 100 and 200. 
</P>
<P>
This makes a favorite of Dring, who ran in the state meet last year as a 
freshman but was awe-struck by the spectacle. This year, she said, the 
excitement should help. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I've always liked is when you're nervous and have lots of 
competition, it edges you," she said. "But last year, I was too nervous and 
couldn't concentrate on anything." 
</P>
<P>
Dring said she will be running not to win but rather to lower her times. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of takes the stress out of it that way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The section should also be well-represented by two other underclass sprinters 
who have bolted to the top of the state pack the past couple weeks, Southwest 
sophomore Riley Washington and Monte Vista junior Latasha McKinney. 
</P>
<P>
At last week's section boys' finals, Washington ran the 100 meters in 10.53, 
fastest legal time in California this year. In the girls' section 
preliminaries, McKinney clocked an 11.90, the state's third best in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Washington will also run in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's his best race," Coach Carl Parrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Washington placed second in the section 200 final at 21.57, behind Kearny's 
Darnay Scott (21.49). Parrick said Washington would have won that one, too, but 
got out of the blocks slowly. Scott's 200 time is fourth best in the state, 
Washington's fifth. 
</P>
<P>
The section also has four hurdlers among the state's elite. Morse junior Chris 
Jones has the fourth-best 110 mark (14.38) and the fifth-best 300 (37.89). 
Castle Park junior Eric Bell led the section in the 110s all year until the 
finals, in which he placed second to Jones in 14.43, fifth fastest in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Poway senior Kim Dill has run the state's fourth-best time in the 100 lows 
(14.19), and San Pasqual junior Erin Blunt has the state's fourth-best 
electronic time in the 300 lows (43.10).

<P>
If Mira Mesa's baseball team is feeling a little smug today, and perhaps into 
the weekend, it's because it has earned the right. It has nothing to do with 
winning, everything to do with respect. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa and Monte Vista gathered for the San Diego Section 3-A championship 
game Thursday at the University of San Diego. Mira Mesa jumped to a 
second-inning lead, was never seriously challenged and won, 8-1. But the game 
said a lot about the character of the teams playing it. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams had screamed, scraped and made promises to higher powers just to get 
here. 
</P>
<P>
From the moment the section seeding meeting ended, Mira Mesa Coach Mike Prosser 
was outraged that his team had been placed 15th out of 16 teams. The Marauders 
finished third in the City Eastern League, and only with the support of other 
league representatives did they make it in at all. 
</P>
<P>
"We almost didn't get in," Prosser said. "But they never gave up. All their 
hard work and determination paid off. There's not a better group of kids 
around." 
</P>
<P>
Ninth-seeded Monte Vista (20-12) was picked before the season to finish behind 
Helix, El Capitan and Granite Hills in the five-team Grossmont 3-A League, and 
did, but the Monarchs squirmed their way into postseason play and managed their 
first playoff victory in the school's 29-year history en route to the final. 
</P>
<P>
"We had three goals at the beginning of the season," Monte Vista Coach Rob 
Phillips said. "To make it to the finals and win and to win 20 games. Well, two 
out of three isn't bad." 
</P>
<P>
Not bad at all, considering the near-perfect game played by Mira Mesa (22-7). 
Every hit, catch, pitch and putout seemed to work in the Marauders' favor. And 
the second inning displayed that the best as Mira Mesa extended a one-run lead 
to seven. 
</P>
<P>
Monte Vista's Robbie Stone struck out the first batter, then gave up eight 
consecutive hits and six runs, all earned, before getting out of the inning 
with two fly-outs. With all the potential relievers playing other positions, no 
one was throwing in the bullpen. Phillips waited until the sixth to pull Stone 
(10-5). 
</P>
<P>
"There is where people will second-guess me," Phillips said, "but the balls 
weren't being hit all that hard. And he shut them down after the second." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said he waited so long because Stone was such a big part of Monte 
Vista being here. 
</P>
<P>
"He won 10 games to get us here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosser was on the same wavelength, but he had to spread his pitching 
assignments around. He planned to have eight-game winner Marc Nielsen -- a 
player he described as doing everything but driving the school bus -- pitch 
four innings, which Nielsen did. Brendan Hause came in for two innings, but the 
appearance of Mike Bovee in the seventh brought the house down. 
</P>
<P>
"Marc Nielsen deserved the right to start this championship," Prosser said. 
"Mike Bovee deserves the opportunity to go out and throw some pitches." 
</P>
<P>
Bovee broke his ankle April 19; the cast was taken off Wednesday. Prosser said 
he didn't know if he'd let Bovee play until he watched him throw Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen (9-2) said he wanted to go the distance but added he even would have 
understood if Bovee had started. 
</P>
<P>
"You heard everyone when he came in," Nielsen said of the cheers. 
</P>
<P>
Bovee struck out two, but by then, Mira Mesa really needed no assistance. And 
here's a signal for the county: This team loses just one starting senior, 
outfielder Jaime Escamilla. That alone should earn them some respect next year.

MARTINEZ RALLIES TO BEAT OLIVAS

Third-seeded Hernan Olivas used his powerful serve and some spectacular returns 
to win the first set, but when he needed just one shot to defeat top-seeded 
defending champion Ignacio Martinez in the San Diego Section boys' tennis 
semifinals Thursday, he didn't have it. 
</P>
<P>
Olivas, of Vincent Memorial, was leading the third set, 5-4, and serving for 
the match, but Martinez, of St. Augustine, rallied to force a tiebreaker and 
win, 6-7 (7-3), 6-2, 7-6 (7-4), at San Diego Tennis and Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
With second-seeded Francisco Santillan of Hilltop beating No. 6 Chris Tontz of 
USDHS, 6-3, 6-2, in the other semifinal, the stage was set for a rematch of the 
1989 section final, in which Martinez defeated Santillan, 6-3, 7-6. The two 
will play at 3:30 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
That won't be the only rematch. Top-seeded Jimmy Brown and Tim Kreysing of La 
Jolla and second-seeded James Conda and Jon Elsberry of La Jolla won their 
semifinals. These two teams met two weeks ago, when Brown and Kreysing battled 
back from a 5-2 deficit and two match points in the third set to beat their 
teammates in the City Western League doubles final. Their match will start at 2 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"This was my toughest match (of the season)," Martinez said after he rallied 
from a 3-1 deficit in the third-set tiebreaker against Olivas. "I was playing 
consistent, but his passing shots gave me trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Olivas charged to the net after he served at match point, but Martinez slapped 
a risky backhand crossing shot behind him, then won the next two points to 
break Olivas' serve and tie it at 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
Olivas was vocal and animated through most of the match of nearly three hours 
and had received a verbal warning for cursing in Spanish. After he reacted to a 
passing shot by Martinez that made it 3-3 in the tiebreaker, Olivas was 
penalized one point for misconduct by line judge Robbin Adair. Martinez won 
three of the next four points and finished the match with a running volley that 
Olivas couldn't return. 
</P>
<P>
For Martinez, it was a long and tiring afternoon that began with a 6-2, 7-6 
(7-3) quarterfinal victory over Jose Medrano of Bishop's. Santillan beat St. 
Augustine's German Aragon, 7-5, 6-2, and breezed against Tontz, a junior, who 
outlasted fourth-seeded David Smith of La Jolla in a mild quarterfinal upset, 
3-6, 6-4, 6-3.

Question: There's been a lot of information in newspapers and magazines and on 
television about the harm that can be done to the baby if a pregnant woman 
drinks. 
</P>
<P>
But I don't remember reading anything about what might happen to the baby if a 
nursing mother drinks. Could this have a harmful effect on the baby? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: As is true in the case of pregnant women, the safest course of action 
for nursing mothers is not to drink at all. Obviously, alcohol that has not 
been consumed cannot affect the baby. However, there is some evidence to 
suggest that no more than one alcoholic drink a day is permissible for nursing 
mothers.

TOTAL SCHWARZENEGGER; 
</P>
<P>
FILM: PAUL VERHOEVEN'S FUTURISTIC ACTION-THRILLER 'TOTAL RECALL' PLUNGES THE 
MUSCULAR HERO IN A DEADLY GAME OF MIND OVER MATTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For anyone who's ever suspected that psychotic fantasies lay behind many of the 
big 1980s action movies, the spectacular futuristic thriller "Total Recall" 
(citywide) offers tongue-in-cheek proof. 
</P>
<P>
Here, possible psychosis is the movie's mainspring. Is the major character, 
Arnold Schwarzenegger's Doug Quaid, really a malcontent construction worker 
obsessed with dreams of Mars and sleazy brunettes? Or is he "Hauser," a 
turncoat secret agent, his memory erased by the all-powerful intergalactic 
"Agency"? 
</P>
<P>
"Quaid," who supposedly lives in a dull, metallic Earth city linked by huge TV 
screens and super-clean subways, is a nowhere man living a nowhere life. 
"Hauser," missing link to a group of Martian revolutionaries, is the most 
important man in the solar system, a man everyone wants to find or kill. 
</P>
<P>
Action-movie cliche or paranoia? The movie tends to keep us on the edge, 
trapped between these two possibilities. It's a bit schizoid itself. Part of 
"Total Recall" is a typical Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle, with the massively 
muscled hero racing through another hostile world, villains, explosions and 
bloodshed around every corner. And part of it is an ingenious and ribald probe 
into psychological terror, like director Paul Verhoeven's earlier "The Fourth 
Man." One moment, Schwarzenegger is ordinary guy Quaid strapped to an operating 
chair at Rekall Inc., where an imaginary Martian vacation is going to be 
harmlessly injected into his brain. The next moment, hell breaks dementedly 
loose. 
</P>
<P>
Verhoeven, working from an often-rewritten screenplay distantly based on Philip 
K. Dick's brilliant 1966 short story "We Can Remember It for You Wholesale," 
keeps ringing these truth-or-illusion changes throughout the movie. And if they 
don't always click, if the movie sometimes seems overwhelmed by its budget and 
its legendary third-act problems, it's still entertainingly raw and brutal, 
full of whiplash pace and juicy exaggeration. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through, "Total Recall" achieves its maximum intensity. An infuriatingly 
prissy psycho-babbler, Roy Brocksmith's Dr. Edgemar, shows up suddenly in a 
Martian hotel, informs the beleaguered Quaid/Hauser that he's in the throes of 
a "schizoid embolism" and asks him to pop a reality pill and wake up. This 
little rationalist -- who looks a bit like a movie critic -- asks which reality 
makes more sense: being a frustrated construction worker or an invincible 
super-spy? It's a peak of crazy humor -- and it gains its punch from the whole 
genre and its larger-than-life heroes: James Bond, Rambo, Schwarzenegger 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Total Recall" will strike some audiences as too brutal or coarse-tempered, too 
obsessed with violence-for-violence's sake. But that's not its main problem. 
Verhoeven never shows freakishness or bloodshed out of sadism or callousness. 
Much of his talent lies in his willingness to go to extremes: to push the 
youth-sex movie to new frankness in "Turkish Delight," scrape the urban 
underbelly in "Spetters," make merry with mechanical mayhem in "RoboCop." And 
when he goes too far, he knows it; coming from a Pentecostalist religious 
background, he often gives an impression of consciously violating taboo. 
</P>
<P>
When "Total Recall" is at its most savage or excessive -- as in the maniacal 
chases and the wild apocalyptic paroxysm of the climax -- it's at its best. 
It's weaker on structure, overall coherence, the humorous or romantic 
interludes. 
</P>
<P>
"RoboCop" was a wild nose-thumb, a definitive auto-critique of all the "new 
brutalist" techno-pop action movies of the mid-'80s. But "Total Recall," though 
it has the same kind of anti-fascist overview, is only satiric occasionally -- 
in its dumb-glossy newscasts, its absurdly gabby RoboCab driver, or in its 
Venusville brothel scene, with a triple-breasted prostitute and an atmosphere 
that suggests a kinked-up version of the "Star Wars" frontier bar. 
</P>
<P>
The future-Earth urban environment doesn't have the hip density of Ridley 
Scott's L.A. in "Blade Runner" or Terry Gilliam's London in "Brazil" -- and 
Mars tends to be a red blur, full of lethal rabbit warrens. But the actors 
sometimes suggest an emerging Verhoeven stock company. Ronny Cox turns up again 
as a kind-eyed mogul with a heart of ice. Michael Ironside as Richter, the main 
thug, looks and acts something like "RoboCop's" maniac, Kurtwood Smith. There 
are heroines here too -- but Rachel Ticotin's brunette rebel registers less 
strongly than Sharon Stone's ambiguous blonde slut-wife. 
</P>
<P>
In "Total Recall," Schwarzenegger fills the role Rutger Hauer used to have in 
Verhoeven's world; the movie exposes him more, makes him attractively 
vulnerable. Schwarzenegger became a star after he turned himself into a blocky 
muscle-mechanic in empty movies like "Predator" and "Commando." But what 
attracted him to this movie may be its ultimate "loner" role. Quaid/Hauser is 
not only alienated from his environment; he's never really sure if his 
environment exists. 
</P>
<P>
It's not an unmixed achievement. Occasionally we get the old brutal one-liners 
that his audience expects. Here, they fit neither character nor situation. And 
the script doesn't keep Schwarzenegger's identities straight. Characters who 
knew him on Mars call him "Quaid" when they should be calling him "Hauser." 
(That's not a minor quibble, since the story hinges crucially on the 
psychological distinctions between the two.) 
</P>
<P>
All this may simply illustrate the difference between enlivening a $15-million 
movie and a $65-million one. Viewed as an Arnold Schwarzenegger film, "Total 
Recall" is a step forward, his best vehicle since "The Terminator." Viewed as a 
Verhoeven movie, it's a step back from "RoboCop." It has the same velocity and 
ferocity, but not the same control, impudence or incandescence. 
</P>
<P>
Split all the way through, "Total Recall" (rated R for nudity, sex, language 
and extreme violence) soars when it sends up its conventions, crashes a little 
when it accepts them. But Verhoeven devotees shouldn't be perturbed. After all, 
look at "Dune." And look at the movies David Lynch made after it.

SWEET BABY BLUES KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS TO SWING

<P>
In the beginning, there was jazz, and the sound was swinging, and the spirit 
was wild and infectious. And the Lord looked down and he said, "This is good." 
</P>
<P>
But musicians became gods, and music became art or big business. And the mood 
grew stiff and formal. 
</P>
<P>
Until San Diego husband and wife team, Jimmy and Jeannie Cheatham, came along. 
And, Wednesday at Elario's, their Sweet Baby Blues Band swung and shucked and 
jived through opening night. 
</P>
<P>
And the club's small stage was packed so tightly with moving and grooving 
musicians that Jeannie Cheatham was on the verge of falling overboard as the 
eight-piece band worked its way through an opening set of blues-based standards 
and originals, playing to a standing-room-only crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The Sweet Baby Blues Band features a five-horn front line that adds punch to 
every tune. Jimmy Cheatham's horn charts give the ensemble all the drive of a 
classic big band. 
</P>
<P>
Alto saxophonist Curtis Peagler was a standout, mixing rapid be-bop lines with 
squealing echoes of jazz's avant-garde and savory blues riffs, which he 
repeated over and over as the other horns goosed the tempo and the rhythm 
section tethered the whole spicy thing to earth. 
</P>
<P>
Trombonist Cheatham and young trumpet player Nolan Smith spurred each other to 
better and better solos. Smith's sharp, brassy sound serves as the section's 
perfect high-end accent. 
</P>
<P>
Jeannie Cheatham sung a molasses-slow version of the Pete Johnson blues 
standard "Cherry Red," with Peagler's sax and Jimmy Cheatham's muted trombone 
laughing and crying to mimic her vocal nuances. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Noone switched from tenor sax to clarinet for "C.C. Rider," anchored by 
John (Ironman) Harris' rock-steady drumming. The other horn players added 
background sing-along over Noone's clarinet solos. 
</P>
<P>
"Roll 'Em Pete" found the tall, angular Peagler rubbing Noone's forehead to 
conjure chorus after chorus of fluid tenor lines from the short, stocky 
saxophonist. 
</P>
<P>
Jeannie Cheatham showed why she is a critics' favorite on "In the Dark," a slow 
blues song to which she applied her full range, from low-down growls to 
honey-smooth high vibrato, and everything in between. She followed up with 
"Ain't Nobody's Business." 
</P>
<P>
The band closed the set with "Meet Me With Your Black Drawers On," with the 
horn section singing the title refrain over and over in unison. 
</P>
<P>
Bassist Red Callendar, a half-century veteran of jazz -- since his 1937 
recording debut with Louis Armstrong -- locks in with Harris and Jeannie 
Cheatham to provide a bottom end that helps every tune swing. 
</P>
<P>
The Sweet Baby Blues Band was having a great time. On stage, it was one big 
party, as Peagler toyed with Noone, Cheatham and Smith hammed it up, and 
baritone saxman Dinky Morris played the straight man at the edge of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
The Cheathams have received wide acclaim for several albums, but theirs is 
spontaneous music that is best appreciated live, where the sound is 
three-dimensional and the players' gestures and facial expressions are in full 
view. 
</P>
<P>
Now, this is good. 
</P>
<P>
 The band plays nightly through Sunday. A word of caution: This could be its 
only local appearance this year.

POP ALBUM CHART: HAMMER BUMPS O'CONNOR DOWN A NOTCH

After several weeks at No. 2 on the Billboard magazine pop album chart, rapper 
M.C. Hammer's "Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em" finally bumped Sinead O'Connor's 
"I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got" out of the top spot -- down to No. 2. Her 
reign lasted six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Paula Abdul's "Shut up and Dance" has been the most popular new album in the 
last few weeks, shooting up to No. 9 in just three weeks. The Bell Biv Devoe 
threesome, whose "Poison" is No. 5, aren't the only New Edition members who 
have a hit album. Balladeer Johnny Gill is headed for the Top 10 with his 
"Johnny Gill" album," which moved up four places to No. 16. The Wilson Phillips 
trio cracked the Top 10 with "Wilson Phillips" -- up two notches to No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
* Madonna's new album, "I'm Breathless," entered the chart at No. 44. Her 
high-profile tour plus her single, "Vogue" -- which just dropped to No. 2 -- 
have given the album a big boost.

Louvre Curator Cleared: Charges against the Louvre's chief curator of 
paintings, who had been accused of receiving a stolen painting, have been 
dismissed by a French judge. 
</P>
<P>
Pierre Rosenberg had been indicted in December 1988 of illegally receiving "The 
Gentlemen of Seville" by the Spaniard Bartolome Esteban Murillo. The painting 
had belonged to art collector Suzanne de Canson. The Lourve had bought the 
painting from Joelle Pesnel, a former nurse of De Canson's who is accused of 
swindling her. Legal officials said the case against Rosenberg was too weak.

'RED SURF' CATCHES THE DARK SIDE OF LAID-BACK L.A. LIFESTYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The plot of "Red Surf" (at selected theaters) must be as old as the movies. 
It's the one about the guy who wants to pull off one final job and then settle 
down, promising the woman he loves that "things will be different." 
</P>
<P>
We know better, yet it's amazing how potent such a story can still be, 
especially when it's as well-told as it is here. H. Gordon Boos, a seasoned 
assistant director, most recently to Francis Coppola, has made a dynamite 
directorial debut. For him and his writers, principally Vincent Robert, the 
tangy, seductive "Red Surf" becomes a chance to consider what can happen to 
Southern California surfers, those mythical golden boys, once their moment of 
glory has passed. 
</P>
<P>
George Clooney's dark-haired Remar and Doug Savant's blonde Attila are the 
Hardy Boys going bad. They're personable, handsome, rangy guys, still young 
enough for their hard-partying not to leave its mark visibly. An injured leg 
has sidelined Remar from the surfing that once won him trophies and magazine 
covers. Since he's into drugs, it has become an all-too-easy step into running 
them for an East Los Angeles kingpin (Rick Najera), a bizarre, savage decadent 
holed up in a crumbling mansion. (He's the one key character drawn from other 
movies rather than from life.) Attila is a sweet-natured type who is loyalty 
personified, not too swift but not so dumb as to not realize that he and his 
best friend are asking for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Remar may be self-destructive, but he's no fool either. He knows that there's 
true love between him and his live-in girlfriend Rebecca (Dedee Pfeiffer), but 
that he's in danger of losing her. He's becoming painfully aware that it's time 
to grow up, but he can't resist that one last run. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to casting that's as sharp as the film's writing and direction, it's 
possible to come away from the film caring more about these three than perhaps 
they really deserve. For Clooney, Savant and Pfeiffer aren't merely 
great-looking, but have genuine charm, ability and star quality. There are also 
strong impressions made by Philip McKeon as Remar and Attila's disastrously 
thickheaded pal and by rock star Gene Simmons as their older, wiser mentor, a 
maker of surf boards and wet bikes. 
</P>
<P>
"Red Surf" (rated R for violence and language) fulfills all the obligations of 
a youth-action genre picture but emerges as more than that. It brings to mind 
"Tequila Sunrise," and not just because that talented Pfeiffer is Michelle's 
younger sister or because of its lush look (thanks to cinematographer John 
Schwartzman) and languorous, plaintive score (by Sasha Matson). It's because it 
perceives that all that is glamorous and sunny in rootless and transitory L.A. 
can hide a lethal undertow.

'FRANKENHOOKER': A FUN SLICE OF AMERICAN GOTHIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank Henenlotter's hilarious, totally outrageous grin-and-gore comedy 
"Frankenhooker" takes over tonight as the Nuart's Friday midnight offering, 
replacing his "Basket Case 2." 
</P>
<P>
It couldn't be more appropriate, because "Frankenhooker" is just as gleefully 
perverse as his "Basket Case" pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Shocks-and-yocks is what midnight shows are all about, and the gifted 
Henenlotter supplies plenty of both. 
</P>
<P>
Even before New Jersey power-plant worker Jeffrey Franken (James Lorinz) loses 
his pretty but plumpish fiancee Elizabeth (Patty Mullen) to a runaway lawn 
mower, you know he's weird, a guy who's been thrown out of three medical 
schools and whose garage workshop/lab features a tank containing what looks to 
be the living brain of a Cyclops. 
</P>
<P>
Now Jeffrey has managed to salvage Elizabeth's severed head, and tries to 
improve upon nature by assembling a new body for her from parts of New York's 
sexiest streetwalkers. 
</P>
<P>
Much of what happens defies description in its sheer grisliness, but never for 
a second do Henenlotter and co-writer Robert Martin lose their all-crucial 
sense of humor. Henenlotter may have had in mind a homage to Herschel Gordon 
Lewis' cult classic "Blood Feast." However, where that film is disturbingly 
morbid in its sex-and-violence equation, Henenlotter makes a comic point of 
Jeffrey's puritanism and its bizarre consequences. Also, "Frankenhooker" 
(Times-rated Mature) has lots of fun presenting an exaggerated fantasy view of 
big, bad Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Henenlotter gets extraordinarily well-sustained, straight-faced 
portrayals from his stars -- and in this instance provides cameos for Louise 
Lasser as Jeffrey's doting, innocent mother and Shirley Stoler as the 
thought-she'd-seen-it-all proprietor of the lowest dive in New York. No doubt 
about it, Henenlotter is an original, coming up with a piece of American Gothic 
that has the primitive energy of Sam Fuller and the dark humor of David Lynch.

'FACE OF ENEMY' LOSES SOUL TO PLOT FORMULA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's probably a mistake to think you can take the conventions of sleazy 
melodrama and purify them by tacking on serious themes, social consciousness. 
Sleazy melodrama has its own level of artistry; you can't graft integrity onto 
it. 
</P>
<P>
In "Face of the Enemy" (at the Monica 4-Plex), a low-budget independent 
thriller with a "torn from the headlines" plot, the protagonists are a beefy 
security guard (George DiCenzo) and the terrified Iranian woman (Rosana DeSoto) 
he ties up and imprisons in his cellar. 
</P>
<P>
The movie isn't done in a tawdry, opportunistic way. It doesn't try much for 
cheap shocks, dirty shocks or too many shocks of any kind. But there's 
something tawdry and opportunistic about the set-up. "Face of the Enemy" can't 
really be a movie of ideas, because it's too tied to its melodramatic plot, and 
it can't explode the melodrama into any physical or sensual excitement, because 
it's trying to be tasteful, responsible -- even when the security guard is 
glowering while his victim strips in the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
The crux of the story is the guard's belief that his captive is an Iranian who 
interrogated him as a hostage; now he's putting her through the same hell. 
Director Hassan Ildari loads the movie up with flashbacks to show the guard's 
obsession, torment, his brooding over pains past. But the movie wilts on its 
own good intentions, becomes an empty technical exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Ildari, an Iranian immigrant and AFI graduate, also wrote the original story 
but, together with his Australian screenwriter, Philip Alderton, he's concocted 
a vision of American life that seems foreign, edgy, empty of any kind of solid, 
day-to-day routine. The characters, despite good acting by DiCenzo and DeSoto, 
are figures in a landscape that's never been filled in, trapped in a house that 
doesn't seem lived in, doomed to keep tumbling into the same obsessive 
flashbacks and surly interchanges, until the cops or the final credits finally 
show up. 
</P>
<P>
"Face of the Enemy" (Times-rated Mature for violence and partial nudity) tries 
to prod us into some soul-searching about the nature of political and personal 
tyranny. But it can't. The so-called "ideas" can't disguise the sordid plot 
formulas -- and, since these movie makers aren't willing to dive down into the 
sleaze, they can't give us any real ideas, or emotions, worth keeping. 
</P>
<P>
'FACE OF THE ENEMY' 
</P>
<P>
A Tri-Culture Pictures release. Producers Bruce Gueramian, Elizabeth Lynch 
Brown, Catherine Rocca. Director Hassan Ildari. Script: Phillip Alderton, 
Aldari. Camera Peter Indergrand. Production design: Pierluca DiCarlo, Marina 
Keiser. Music Esfandiar Monfaredzadeh. Editor Toby Brown. Executive producer 
David Sahakian. With George DiCenzo, Rosana DeSoto.

'LABYRINTH OF PASSION' A GLIMPSE OF ALMODOVAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pedro Almodovar's 1982 "Labyrinth of Passion" (at the Nuart) views sexual and 
romantic hang-ups with that same tonic sense of absurdity that characterizes 
all his work. In this early comedy, he scatters his attention over some 50 
characters, most of whom are caught up in his or her own Angst. 
</P>
<P>
The film is often amusing, but it's not nearly as involving as his subsequent, 
more focused pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Everything more or less revolves around two young women. One is Sexilia 
(Cecilia Roth), inevitably known as Sexi, who is the nymphomaniacal daughter of 
an eminent "biogynecologist" who views sex with such distaste as to specialize 
in artificial insemination. The other is Queti (Marta Fernandez-Muro), the 
daughter of a dry cleaner, with whom she reluctantly has an incestuous 
relationship. When Sexilia and Queti become friends, they begin to plot in 
earnest. Caught up in the many and varied sexual shenanigans are the elegant, 
imperious ex-Empress Toraya of Tiran (Helga Line) and her successor's son, the 
crown prince Riza Niro Zahlevi (Imanoel Arias), who seems to prefer men to 
women. Antonio Banderas, star of Almodovar's current "Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!," 
has a small role as a member of a Tiranian rock group. 
</P>
<P>
Almodovar sends up Freudian seriousness in regard to sex hilariously and even 
appears (in drag) in front of the camera singing a couple of raunchy songs. 
Avid Almodovar admirers won't want to miss "Labyrinth of Passion" (Times-rated 
Mature), which is far longer on talk than action, but it's another of those 
films that are of greater interest for what they portend than for what they 
actually accomplish.

STAGE BEAT: 'FIRE WAS BURNING' AN INTRIGUING LOCAL BOW FOR IGLOO TROUPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. H. McCULLOH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't be put off by the title of the igLoo group's first production in its 
Hollywood space. 
</P>
<P>
The pretentious sounding "A Fire Was Burning Over the Dumpling House One 
Chinese New Year" doesn't even hint at the chords struck by the writing of Paul 
Peditto and the lead performances in this production of his Steppling-esque 
exploration of a small-time hustler and his alcoholic, drug-ridden girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Horace is a bartender in a Manhattan transvestite bar -- well, it's a job -- 
and Baby Jane is a regular customer, hiding under a frowzy wig and behind dark 
shades. Their mutual spark ignites and they begin a muddled odyssey that ends 
in Atlantic City, he behind a casino gaming table and she in scroungy Baltic 
Avenue bars. 
</P>
<P>
It's a disconcerting, harrowing journey. But under Daniel Piburn's theatrical, 
tightly wound direction, there is also the sense of humor that most people find 
to help them survive life's traps. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of that humor, and a great deal of insight into what makes Baby Jane 
tick, is provided by the exceptional performance of Maria Tirabassi as the lost 
girl trying to find a light to follow. Chris Peditto is fine as the passive 
Horace, irresistibly drawn to Baby Jane but hampered by his own inability to 
act on his better judgment. Samantha Kaye also impresses as Jane's junkie 
girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
"A Fire Was Burning" is an intriguing local bow for this relocated Chicago 
company. They're imaginative and unafraid to take chances, and that makes for 
exciting theater. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6543 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood; Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 
7 p.m.; indefinitely. $12; (213) 962-3771.

<P>

<P>
'Dark Ride' a Symphonic Tone Poem in Words 
</P>
<P>
There is a linear plotline in Len Jenkin's "Dark Ride" at Beyond Baroque, but 
it's of little import. 
</P>
<P>
A writer is hired by Sublime Publications to translate an ancient Chinese 
manuscript, but can't decide if the fragments are real or a fraud. One fragment 
describes a girl whose lover has left her. The lover steals a precious gem from 
an obsessive jeweler, and here we leave reason and venture into Jenkin's 
hypnotic, other-worldly realm of fluid language, of scrambled eras, mixed 
images and surprise packages of dramatic genres. 
</P>
<P>
This carnival ride -- "Listen, lady, if he's old enough to enjoy the ride, he's 
old enough to need a ticket," hollers an announcer -- is dark, but it's also 
full of light. Less of a play than a symphonic tone poem in words, it requires 
the audience to listen, to submit to its rhythms and to absorb the significance 
of its calligraphic brush strokes as they flash past. 
</P>
<P>
In a large company, Jonathan Emerson makes a strong impression as the 
Translator, as do James Nixon as the lover turned Thief, Synthia Hardy as Deep 
Sea Edna, and Nancy Magathan as Margo, the girl who lost her lover and becomes 
the bait for his capture. 
</P>
<P>
Director Alec Doyle guides his large cast with expert attention to the text, 
given an added advantage in his energetic staging by Kevin Adams' versatile set 
and intricate, dream-world lighting. David Dowse and Lee Scott provide a sound 
design that places the audience smack in the front seat, as they are reeled 
through the fascinating labyrinth of the translator's Book of the Yellow 
Ancestor. 
</P>
<P>
 At 681 Venice Blvd., Venice; Saturdays and Sundays, 8 p.m.; ends June 24. $8; 
(213) 822-3006.

</P>
<P>
'Only You' -- Good Stuff Trapped in a TV Sitcom 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Mason's "Only You" at 2nd Stage has a fine, versatile set designed by 
Robert L. Smith, effective costumes by Jill Ohanneson and excellent, intricate 
lighting by J. Kent Inasy. It's well directed at the proper frenzied pace by 
Joel Asher, and boasts some good performances, particularly Mark Arnott's 
hysterical, loony, paranoid bachelor and Kristina Starman's ditzy bimbo, who 
can't rise above being an armchair feminist. 
</P>
<P>
But none of these admirable efforts keep the play from seeming merely a 
television version of Howard Korder's "Boys' Life." If these latent-adult males 
struggling with junior high school mentalities in the battle of the sexes bear 
any resemblance to the thirtysome-thing males of the early '90s, we're in deep 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Doucette, Stacey Stone, Carey Eidel and Ric Stoneback, as a heavenly 
manipulator, do their sitcom best, but can't keep "Only You" from looking like 
a pilot that didn't make it. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Mason has been seen to better advantage in plays such as "In a 
Northern Landscape." What possessed him to move in this direction? 
</P>
<P>
 At 6500 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood; Thursdays through Sundays, 8 p.m.; ends

Mixed Bag of Monologues at Theatre/Theater 
</P>
<P>
The three monologuists whose visions make up "Triple Vision," a brief program 
at Theatre/Theater, present a mixed bag of effects with some hits and some 
misses. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Van Allen's four pieces are linear, almost plotted, but she doesn't take 
her material as seriously as she could. From her nasty little girl, who 
screeches that she wants to go to the zoo, to her elitist novelist working as 
an office temp, she starts on an intriguing path of satire without ever 
reaching a conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
Don Victor is more successful, less linear and more startling in his 
imaginative approach and evocative writing. His surrealistic Commander Ray is a 
bouquet of verbal Dadaism, and his aging baby-sitter Waldo, improvising a story 
for his charges through audience suggestion, is clever and oddly touching. 
</P>
<P>
The highlights of the program are Siobhan Fallon's excerpts from her one-woman 
show. Her ostentatiously programmed therapist, her chorus girl in a non-Equity 
stock production of "My Fair Lady" and her pantomimed "Fish" are singular 
delights and spark this uneven hour. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1713 N. Cahuenga Blvd., Hollywood; Saturdays, 5 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m.; ends

BEETHOVEN MASS SET AT CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although many of the great classical music works were composed expressly for 
religious rituals, they are rarely performed in that context today. This is 
particularly true of full-scale renditions of the Roman Catholic Mass, which 
are far more likely to be heard in the concert hall than in a church. 
</P>
<P>
But on Sunday evening at St. Cyril of Jerusalem Catholic Church in Encino, 
Beethoven's Mass in C will be presented in the manner in which it was intended. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a religious work, after all, so we wanted to do it as an actual Mass," 
said William Beck, music director of St. Cyril's. "But it is a large 
undertaking for a church, to say the least." 
</P>
<P>
The Mass, which is to be celebrated by the church's pastor, Rev. Monsignor 
Cyril Navin, will be performed by a 40-piece orchestra, a 50-member choir and 
four soloists, all to be conducted by Beck. 
</P>
<P>
It was scheduled as part of the church's regular performing arts series, with 
an important difference. Although the cost of performing the work will be 
approximately $5,000 (most of which is for musicians' fees), the church will 
not be charging admission or asking those attending for the traditional 
"suggested donation." 
</P>
<P>
"We can't," Beck said, "because this is being done as a religious service. It's 
free to anyone who wants to come." As in any regular service, however, the 
plate will be passed for free-will offerings. 
</P>
<P>
Additional music will include the "Hallelujah" section of Beethoven's "Christ 
on the Mount of Olives" oratorio. 
</P>
<P>
 Beethoven's Mass in C will be celebrated at St. Cyril of Jerusalem Catholic 
Church, 15520 Ventura Blvd., Encino, at 7:30 p.m. Sunday. For information, call 
(818) 986-8234.

CALARTS FILMMAKERS HOPE FOR SHORTCUT TO HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARKUSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Schmidt, 30, poured $9,000 and three years into his semi-autobiographical, 
coming-of-age picture about a 15-year-old boy who falls for a sophomore co-ed. 
"I maxed out one credit card to $6,000." 
</P>
<P>
Kris Kristensen, 26, unloaded $10,000 -- "I cried to my parents for it" -- to 
tell his story of unfulfilled love. And Ben Williams, 27, spent $4,000, went 
back to his native Louisiana, and broke the law to make a film about a man who 
tries to alter his true past. "We broke into a batting cage." 
</P>
<P>
Now Williams and his fellow filmmakers want to break into Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Attempting to short-circuit the numerous roadblocks in the entertainment 
industry -- the artists, all former CalArts students -- will stage their own 
film festival Wednesday night at the Writers Guild Theater in Beverly Hills. 
Hosted by CalArts graduate and actor Ed Harris ("The Right Stuff," "The Abyss") 
the free two-hour show will present five narrative works and one documentary. 
</P>
<P>
"We know this is a roll of the dice," said Schmidt, "but it's the only roll 
we're going to get." 
</P>
<P>
They claim they didn't get a fair roll at CalArts. "There should have been a 
showcase for all student works," said Schmidt, "like what UCLA has. CalArts 
could have done more for us." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Emshwiller, head of the CalArts film school, said it regularly shows student 
films on campus, and at other locations near Hollywood, but agreed in recent 
years, the screenings haven't achieved much success. "We've sent out scores of 
invitations to producers," Emshwiller said, "but we've had bad luck in getting 
the producers to see them. We've been very disappointed. The studios aren't 
running around to look at student films." 
</P>
<P>
There's no guarantee attendance Wednesday will be any better, but the six 
filmmakers have practically invited the whole town; they spent $250 to purchase 
a mailing list with the names of 900 agents, and 3,300 producers and studio 
executives. Plus they are banking that the Harris name will draw more industry 
people. Each spent about $450 for festival expenses. 
</P>
<P>
They harbor no illusions that their films, ranging from 10 to 26 minutes, will 
make it to the local movie theater. Much of their work, they admit, is raw and 
unsophisticated. What they hope is that someone with power in the industry 
spots a flash of talent in their films, and wants to help polish it. "This is a 
showcase for us as individuals, not our films," said Stewart Schill, 26. "We 
want jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Harris, a member of the CalArts Board of Trustees, will introduce each picture. 
He said the films "show people who understand the language of film and how to 
tell a story." 
</P>
<P>
Following are the six films to be shown at the festival, which begins at 8 p.m. 
They were made as class projects for CalArts during the last three years. The 
young directors used a lot of school equipment, and found actors to perform 
free. Four of the six focus on unrequited love. In addition, former CalArts 
student Kerry Conran will show a trailer of his uncompleted picture "The 
Misadventures of That Darn Bear." 
</P>
<P>
* "Safari Holiday," Schmidt's 20-minute story about a high school sophomore, on 
vacation with his family, who is immediately attracted to a college girl. 
Through his efforts to win her affection, he realizes is not ready to flirt 
with an older woman. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt said he had a similar experience in Florida when he was 14. 
</P>
<P>
"There was this young lady at the pool," Schmidt said. "We flirted, but that's 
it. I never made it into her room." 
</P>
<P>
* "Self-Portrait," Kristensen's 20-minute picture about a painter who falls in 
love with his roommate's literary agent. The painter begins to become obsessive 
about the woman. He wants to spend his life with her. She was just enjoying a 
good time. 
</P>
<P>
This story, too, emerges from the artist's background. The movie was his 
catharsis. "Yes, there was a girl who just spit on me real bad," Kristensen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Like the other filmmakers, he is excited and frightened about the festival. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lying in bed the other day," he said, "and I wondered, 'What if this 
doesn't make it? What am I going to do?' "

* "Alison's Basket," Williams' 13-minute story about a guy who bumps into a 
girl he had a massive crush on in junior high school. In his mind, he imagines 
they are having a relationship, while, in reality, she is seriously dating 
someone else. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about not accepting someone for what he or she is," Williams said. "The 
guy in the film didn't appreciate the friendship with the girl. For something 
to be important, it doesn't have to be a close, intimate relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Williams shot the picture in Louisiana after he was unable to come up with an 
idea in California. "It was a better atmosphere for me," he said. "People bent 
over backward to help me find locations." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who employed his friend, Steven Soderbergh, director of "sex, lies 
and videotape," as an actor in his film, broke into a batting cage to shoot a 
scene. "The guy who originally gave us permission changed jobs, and we couldn't 
get a hold of the owner," Williams said. "But the owner came by later and said 
it was fine." 
</P>
<P>
* "Gas Food Lodging," Schill's 26-minute picture about a guy who learns someone 
he thought he admired wasn't really that special. As part of the band's 
entourage, he falls for the girlfriend of one of its members, but she doesn't 
return the affection. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to make a picture that has real characters," Schill said. "Typically, 
student pictures have flat characters." 
</P>
<P>
* "Phenomen Mall," a 10-minute documentary by Jill Shinefield, 24, about 
shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
"My interest is more in documentaries," said Shinefield. "I grew up in San 
Francisco and was never really exposed to malls, and then I came here and was 
repulsed by them. I wanted to film inside them and see what they were like." 
</P>
<P>
* "Groovy Ghoulie Garage," a 20-minute movie by James Salisbury, 26, about two 
college-age guys who stumble into a town of crazies. Salisbury thought the 
picture, straightforward horror, would be an easy film for his first venture 
into movie making. 
</P>
<P>
"But it was cold and little things kept going wrong," Salisbury said.

10-CONCERT LO-TEC DANCE SERIES ANNOUNCED 
</P>

After the sparse winter season of dance on the home front, Three's Company's 
annual summer Lo-tec series will seem like a breath of spring to local 
aficionados, despite its no-frills approach to performance and lack of creature 
comforts for the audience. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego modern dance troupe will host 10 dance events at its Hillcrest 
studio this year, beginning with a pair of performances by Lar Lubovitch 
principal Nancy Colahan on July 7-8. 
</P>
<P>
Six programs will feature visiting artists: Los Angeles-based Pacific Dance 
Ensemble (July 14-15); Kay Clark, Jancy Limpert and Janet Shaw of the Bay Area 
(July 21-22); New York-based Ron Brown, Richard Haisma and Albert Reid (Aug. 
18-19); the Las Vegas Music and Dance Ensemble (Aug. 25-26); ODC/San 
Francisco's Jeff Friedman (Sept. 8-9). 
</P>
<P>
The Dance XChange concert (a popular event that integrated on-the-spot 
commentaries by a panel of critics with new work by aspiring choreographers) 
has been discontinued this year. However, the faculty-student workshop concert 
that has been a signature of the summer series since its inception 16 years 
ago, will be repeated Sept. 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
Among the local choreographers participating in the 1990 Lo-Tec series are 
Pamela Turner, will will share the program with Santa Barbara-based 
Improvisation (July 28-29); Alison Cutri, Melissa Cottle and Erin O'Connor 
(Aug. 4-5), and Three's Company co-founder Betzi Roe (Aug. 11-12). 
</P>
<P>
Jean Isaacs, artistic director of Three's Company, said this year's mix is "as 
good or better in terms of quality than we've ever had, and we actually have 
two more events than last year." 
</P>
<P>
"We're starting later," she said, "because we'll be in Europe earlier in the 
summer, but we're running longer -- and we had so much interest from people who 
wanted to show their work, we had to reject some good people." 
</P>
<P>
Although women usually outnumber the male dance makers in Three's Company's 
summer series, this year the tables are turned. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more men this year than ever," said Isaacs. "That's the most 
noteworthy aspect. (The series) is in conjunction with teaching residencies. 
That's how we're able to get so many men."

MOOSE LODGE INVESTIGATED OVER GAMBLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County district attorney's office is investigating an illegal 
gambling operation at the Simi Valley Moose Lodge that allegedly netted about 
$900 a week toward the lodge's operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the district attorney's office and the Simi Valley Police 
Department seized four gambling machines and financial records at the club 
during a raid earlier this week, authorities said. This was the third time that 
the club in the 4800 block of Alamo Street has been raided for gambling 
activities, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
After serving a search warrant at the club Tuesday, law enforcement officers 
confiscated three video gambling machines, which included such games as poker, 
craps and blackjack, said Deputy Dist. Atty. John L. Geb, who is in charge of 
the investigation. A "pull-tab" slot machine also was seized, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Geb said his office received a tip about gambling activities at the club about 
a week ago from an unidentified lodge member. 
</P>
<P>
The informant "was concerned about the adverse effects the gambling was having 
on the lives and families of club members," Geb said. Some of the members were 
apparently starting to experience financial troubles stemming from gambling 
debts incurred at the club, Geb said. 
</P>
<P>
Club officials did not return phone calls Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests have been made and no charges have been filed in connection with the 
case, Geb said, adding that it may be a week or more before his office decides 
what action, if any, to take against the club. 
</P>
<P>
He said investigators are interviewing "a number of key people" at the club to 
determine who purchased and installed the gambling machines. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to identify who really is responsible," Geb said. "If someone is found 
guilty of conspiracy to operate a gambling enterprise, they could be charged 
with a felony and could face up to three years in prison." 
</P>
<P>
The video gambling machines confiscated during Tuesday's raid were discovered 
inside a locked room next to the bar, Geb said. Customers who wanted to gamble 
would exchange their club cards at the bar for a special key to the room where 
the machines were kept. 
</P>
<P>
Customers would then use tokens purchased at the bar -- 10 tokens for $2.50 -- 
to gamble on the machines, Geb said. When they won, the machines would pay them 
off in tokens. 
</P>
<P>
Winners would exchange the tokens the next day for cash kept in an envelope at 
the bar, apparently to confuse or throw off authorities, Geb said. 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that club members gambled about $1,800 a week on the machines, 
Geb said. He said that about half that amount was used to pay winning gamblers, 
and the rest went to the lodge's operating funds. Because they were profiting 
from the operation, the club stands to lose its tax-exempt status, Geb said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the club could have its liquor license revoked permanently because 
of prior violations, said Morris Berniard, an investigator with the state 
Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control office in Santa Barbara, which 
oversees Simi Valley. Berniard was present during Tuesday's raid. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the lodge received a warning that it could lose its liquor license 
when authorities discovered a video gambling machine on the premises. The lodge 
received a warning, in part, because it had a permit to conduct bingo games at 
the time, Berniard said. 
</P>
<P>
The club's liquor license was suspended for 15 days in 1976 after law 
enforcement officials discovered similar gambling activities being conducted at 
the club, Berniard said.

PROSECUTOR QUERIES ELY OVER EXPENSE AUDIT FOR 2 1/2 HOURS; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATIONS: THE VENTURA COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT TRUSTEE CALLS THE 
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S STAFF MEMBERS 'IDIOTS' BEFORE MEETING WITH ONE FOR THE 
FIRST TIME.

After first denouncing county prosecutors as "idiots," Ventura Community 
College District Trustee Tom Ely met Thursday for the first time with a deputy 
district attorney investigating whether Ely misappropriated thousands of 
dollars in district funds. 
</P>
<P>
Ely, who was accompanied by his wife, Ingrid, and his attorney, James Matthew 
Farley, spent 2 1/2 hours in the Ventura County Courthouse answering questions 
from Deputy Dist. Atty. Carol Nelson about an audit of his travel expenses as 
district trustee. 
</P>
<P>
An independent audit, which was commissioned by the board of trustees of the 
college district in March, found that Ely had charged more than $8,400 in 
questionable expenses on business-related trips that he took during the past 
three years. The audit also listed another $6,978 in claims submitted without 
proper documentation. 
</P>
<P>
Ely has maintained that the audit is flawed and that he did not violate 
district travel policy or misuse public funds. 
</P>
<P>
Asked before his meeting with Nelson if he hoped to clear up some of the 
questions surrounding his district finances, Ely responded, "If the idiots will 
listen! Up to this point, they haven't listened to anything we've said." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Farley said, "I don't think the district attorney has a case. I 
think they're trying to build a case." 
</P>
<P>
Farley said that he has been a close friend of Ely's for years and that he will 
represent the trustee from now on in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the whole thing is nonsense," Farley said. "Mr. Ely has not taken 
anything from the district that was not approved by the district. He didn't do 
anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's interview was cut short when a court reporter assigned to take notes 
during the meeting had to leave unexpectedly, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, who refused to comment on the interview, said she planned to wrap up 
her question-and-answer session with Ely next week. The prosecutor has said 
that her investigation of Ely should be completed by mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
Ely's troubles began in March when it was revealed that he owed one Nevada 
casino $3,000, and that he had been sued by another for $8,000 in gambling 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
The board of trustees commissioned an audit of Ely's financial records after 
learning of his gambling activities and that he had used his district telephone 
to call casinos in Nevada.

MAYOR SAYS AUDIT FAVORS POLICE, FIRE REDUCTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As controversy mounts over a management audit designed to uncover the cause of 
Oxnard's financial crisis, Mayor Nao Takasugi revealed Thursday that an 
auditing firm hired by the city already has suggested drastic cuts to police 
and fire services to balance the city's budget. 
</P>
<P>
In individual meetings with council members last month, Cresap Management 
Consultants of Washington said the financially stricken city may have to 
consider cutting 41 positions -- including 31 sworn officers -- in the Police 
Department, eliminate 18 positions in the Fire Department, close two fire 
stations and sell some city parks, Takasugi said. 
</P>
<P>
The final management audit, ordered by the city in February, was scheduled to 
be released Thursday. But Bill Evans, vice president of Cresap, notified city 
officials Wednesday that the report would not be completed until June 19. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's council meeting, Takasugi called the proposed cuts unacceptable 
and recommended that the council cancel its contract with Cresap for missing 
the deadline. The mayor said he is "indignant and appalled" that Cresap waited 
until the last minute to notify the city that it would not meet the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Evans could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Manuel Lopez agreed with Takasugi, saying the final audit will be 
almost meaningless since it will not be submitted to the city before voters go 
to the polls Tuesday to decide on a 5% utility tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez and Takasugi said it is important that voters know the results of the 
audit before considering the tax increase, which is designed to ease the city's 
financial woes by generating $5 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said that if approved the revenues generated by the tax would 
wipe out an anticipated $2.8-million deficit and eliminate the need for cuts in 
services and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's proposal to cancel the contract with Cresap failed when council 
members voted 2 to 2 on the measure. Councilwomen Dorothy Maron and Geraldine 
(Gerry) Furr opposed the proposal. Councilwoman Ann Johs was absent. 
</P>
<P>
Maron and Furr said they opposed the measure because they believe that the city 
is partly to blame for the audit's delay. They said Cresap was forced to do 
additional work on the audit after council members and city staff members 
raised several concerns about it. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cresap had asked the council to extend the deadline until June 19, it 
voted to take no further action until its next regular meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Gary Gillig said the city is obligated to pay $72,000 for the 
preliminary audit but does not have to pay an additional $175,000 for the 
uncompleted final audit. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opponents of the tax measure accused the council of purposely 
delaying the audit. Others maintained that a draft copy of the audit had been 
completed and shown to city officials. City officials deny the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Bollinger, a self-employed investor who has announced that he will run 
for the council in November, said he talked to Cresap representatives who told 
him on Tuesday that a draft copy was prepared, although he said they would not 
tell him whether city officials have seen it. Bollinger and Paul K. Dolan, also 
a council candidate, have mailed a letter to the U.S. attorney general's office 
asking for an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Thursday, Police Chief Robert Owens said Cresap officials last 
week gave him a section of a draft audit report dealing with the Police 
Department and said he believes several other department heads received similar 
reports. Owens refused to say what was included in the report. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Lewis, president of the Oxnard Peace Officers Assn. and an outspoken 
supporter of the tax measure, said at the council meeting that Cresap must have 
considered only financial savings when it made the recommendations for cuts but 
did not consider the impact on Oxnard residents. 
</P>
<P>
Marc L. Charney, an attorney and Oxnard Chamber of Commerce member, accused 
council members of capitalizing on gloomy fiscal reports to persuade voters to 
approve the tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
"You are using this meeting as a campaign rally or political advertisement" for 
the tax measure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the discussion about personnel reductions, there was only a brief 
explanation for the city's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after the meeting, City Manager David Mora said Cresap 
representatives told council members last month that the crisis came about 
because of inadequate revenue to pay for city services. Mora, however, said 
Cresap did not say why the city is facing a revenue shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
Mora has said the fiscal crisis was partly created in 1987 when the City 
Council eliminated a 4% utility tax two years before it was set to end. That 
alone has cost the city between $4.5 and $5 million a year, he said.

FATHER, SON BRING TALENTS TO CLASSROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WEINSTOCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The students call them Dr. Junior and Dr. Senior. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jeffrey Barsch, 45, and his father, Dr. Ray Barsch, 73, both teach special 
education at Ventura College. Father and son complement each other in the 
classroom and are quick to compliment each other outside as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he brings stature and prestige to the program," said Jeffrey Barsch of 
his father, an acknowledged pioneer in special education who did 
ground-breaking work with children before he retired from Cal State Northridge. 
Last fall, he began teaching part time at Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Jeffrey Barsch arrived first, in 1976, when he was hired to develop a 
learning skills program, which serves students with problems in reading, math, 
spelling, writing and memory. 
</P>
<P>
Where his father specialized in programs for children, the son works primarily 
with adults. "My call to fame was to transfer my father's ideas into 
adult-level curriculum," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided we'd divide the world and he'd take care of the adults and I'd take 
care of the children," Ray Barsch said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, the elder Barsch developed a method called movigenics. "It's 
based on the study of movement as a foundation for learning, and it involves a 
perceptual-motor approach for helping children and adults to overcome their 
learning difficulties," Ray Barsch said. Perceptual-motor methods involve 
helping the senses and muscles work together. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Barsch has trained special education teachers at three universities and has 
written five books on learning problems among children. 
</P>
<P>
His son works with teen-agers and adults, many of whom have suffered head 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"What's been striking for me is to discover little threads of my movigenic 
process" as a part of the entire Ventura College program, said Ray Barsch, 
noting how his theories have been applied by his son in the new computerized 
learning center. "He learned from me but went far beyond me," Ray Barsch said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Marshall Raskind, Learning Disabilities Program coordinator at Cal State 
Northridge and a member of the Learning Disabilities Assn. of America, praised 
both men. 
</P>
<P>
The son "looks at things from a different perspective and tunes into students," 
Raskind said, recalling how Ray Barsch too had always "capitalized on students' 
strengths and interests." CAROL WEINSTOCK

TRASH CAN DEPOSITS ANGER RESIDENTS

Ojai Valley residents are raising a stink about being asked to pay $50 deposits 
for new trash cans. 
</P>
<P>
Ojai Rubbish Service Inc. is asking its 4,100 customers in Oak View, Mira 
Monte, Meiners Oaks, Ojai and Casitas Springs to pay the deposits, which can be 
remitted in $2 installments over two years as part of the company's switch to a 
semi-automated trash collection system in which 95-gallon plastic receptacles 
will be picked up by a mechanical arm extending from the garbage truck. 
</P>
<P>
A notice recently mailed by the company neglected to mention that customers are 
not required to have the larger cans to continue receiving collection service, 
said Morteza Yassini, who owns Ojai Rubbish. 
</P>
<P>
Yassini said the $50 deposits, which will be refunded as each can is returned 
to Ojai Rubbish, protects the company against theft when a customer moves out 
of the service area. Yassini said he has been swamped with calls since he 
mailed the letters. 
</P>
<P>
Several people have also complained to county Supervisor Susan K. Lacey's 
office, said Ed Webster, Lacey's administrative aide. But Webster said that the 
supervisors do not have the power to regulate rubbish companies in 
unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
However, the supervisors will consider adopting a new law later this month that 
would establish franchise agreements for trash collection in the unincorporated 
areas, said Christopher Kortz of the Solid Waste Division. 
</P>

Oak View residents Joseph Rowett and Howard Goshert are among those angry about 
the deposits. With more than 4,000 customers, Yassini has the potential of 
collecting $200,000 in deposits and earning $20,000 annual interest, Rowett 
said. Hugh White, chairman of the Ojai Valley Sanitary District, wondered at a 
recent sewer board meeting who would protect him from having his new can stolen 
off the street. But, White said, the deposit could be an incentive for 
residents to remove their cans from the curb instead of leaving them out.

In Ventura, Santa Clara Valley Disposal Co. has announced that it will provide 
new refuse receptacles to its Fillmore customers without a deposit, a 
spokeswoman said. THIA BELL

JUSTICES REJECT FORCED DRUG TESTS OF WORKERS; 
</P>
<P>
NARCOTICS: JUSTICES LET STAND APPELLATE RULINGS THAT SAID EMPLOYEES CANNOT BE 
MADE TO TAKE RANDOM TESTS.

<P>
In a severe blow to drug testing in the workplace, the state Supreme Court on 
Thursday rejected attempts by employers to force workers to submit to random 
tests to detect the use of illicit substances. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, in a brief order, let stand two appeals-court rulings that 
declared the state constitutional right to privacy protects employees from 
being dismissed solely for refusing to submit to random drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
In both instances, the lower court held that the state privacy guarantee 
applies not only to governmental actions but also to private employers. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, a state Court of Appeal in San Francisco held that a worker in a 
non-safety-related job could not be required to take such a test and upheld a 
$485,042 damage award to a computer programmer who refused to provide a 
company-ordered urine sample. 
</P>
<P>
In the other case, a state Court of Appeal in San Bernardino allowed a chemical 
firm employee to sue for wrongful dismissal after he declined to submit to an 
eye-pupil reaction test to determine whether he was under the influence of 
drugs. Neither ruling applied to job applicants. 
</P>
<P>
The high court action, taken without dissent, makes both appellate rulings 
binding on trial courts statewide. Specialists in employment law said that as a 
result, employers, in order to have a legally valid program, will have to 
provide more specific reasons for testing -- such as an employee's involvement 
in an accident or work in a safety- or security-related job. One attorney said 
the action sounded the "death knell" for random drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
The justices' refusal to hear employer challenges to the appellate rulings came 
as something of a surprise. The court, now led by a moderately conservative 
majority, has proved much more receptive to business concerns than its 
liberal-dominated predecessor under former Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, recent surveys have shown a steady growth in mandatory drug testing 
imposed on both employees and job applicants. A study released last week showed 
that 12.1% of a sampling of current employees in California tested positive for 
drug use. In sharp contrast, only 3.5% of the workers in the 49 other states 
tested positive. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's action marked the second time the justices have sidestepped an 
opportunity to formally review and issue their own opinion on the volatile 
drug-testing issue. Last March, the high court left intact another appellate 
decision allowing drug and alcohol tests of job applicants, who, the appeals 
panel found, have less reasonable expectation of privacy than regular 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
The high court's order Thursday was hailed as being of "monumental importance" 
by Mark S. Rudy of Oakland, attorney for Barbara A. Luck, the programmer who 
successfully pursued a wrongful-termination suit against the Southern Pacific 
Transportation Co. 
</P>
<P>
"This means that an employer cannot use an employee's poor performance or mere 
suspicion of drug use as grounds for testing," Rudy said. "There will have to 
be some 'compelling interest' for the employer -- a very high legal standard -- 
such as an accident, a safety-related job or probable cause to believe there is 
drug use." 
</P>
<P>
Henry F. Telfeian of San Francisco, a lawyer for Southern Pacific, said the 
action had provided the "the death knell" for drug-testing programs in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"Employers are going to be extremely reluctant to institute drug testing except 
where they have probable cause or consent from a worker -- and even then, such 
programs may be of doubtful validity," Telfeian said. "It's a bad decision by 
the Supreme Court not to take up this issue. The court owed it to employers to 
consider this matter." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Bradley, vice president of the 4,000-member Merchants and Manufacturers 
Assn., said it appeared that employers still could impose carefully tailored 
testing programs. But nonetheless, he said, he was disappointed by the high 
court's refusal to review the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"This country is having a real problem determining policy on illegal drugs," 
Bradley said. "If we want to stop people from using drugs, it seems logical to 
do so in the employment situation. Most employers are not trying to be 
punitive. If an employee has a drug problem, they want him to get into a 
treatment program." 
</P>
<P>
In the Luck case, the appellate court said that without a proven and direct 
link to safety, an employer is barred by the state constitutional right to 
privacy from requiring employees to submit to drug tests. The company, the 
panel said, had not shown a "compelling interest" that would justify an 
intrusion on privacy rights. 
</P>
<P>
In its appeal to the high court, Southern Pacific contended that drug testing 
was a legally valid and successful device to improve workplace safety and 
efficiency. The company cited a recent study estimating that 25% of the work 
force aged 20 to 40 are under the influence of illegal drugs while on the job. 
</P>
<P>
In the second case before the court Thursday, James Semore, a production worker 
for Kerr-McGee Chemical Corp., in Trona, Calif., was fired after refusing a 
pupil-reaction test. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court judge in San Bernardino County dismissed the suit but a state 
Court of Appeal reinstated it last February. The appellate court said that when 
a private employee is dismissed for rejecting a random test, he may sue the 
employer for violating his right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court said that firing an employee for refusing an intrusion on 
privacy rights violates the "public policy." Such a finding, which was not made 
by the panel in the Luck case, could open the way for large damage awards 
against employers. 
</P>
<P>
In other action Thursday, the justices: 
</P>
<P>
Unanimously reversed the conviction and death sentence of Duane Holloway, now 
28, for the murders of two Sacramento sisters, Diane Pencin and Debra Cimmino, 
in 1983. Holloway was entitled to a retrial, the court said, because a trial 
juror, violating the judge's admonition, had read news accounts of the case. 
The story at issue indicated Holloway had been on parole after attacking 
another woman with a hammer. The judge had denied use of the previous 
conviction as evidence because of its potentially prejudicial effect on jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Agreed to review an appellate court ruling that the state Department of Motor 
Vehicles had misapplied tax laws and must pay refunds to 17 million used-car 
owners. Officials say the decision, unless overturned, could cost the state 
$1.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Said they would decide whether the state Fair Employment and Housing Commission 
has authority to award damages for emotional distress in cases involving racial 
discrimination. At issue is a Court of Appeal ruling that struck down a 
commission award of $50,000 to a black Contra Costa County man who contended he 
was denied an apartment because of his race.

FEINSTEIN RETURNS TV FIRE WITH HILLSIDE STRANGLER AD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The down-to-the-wire race for governor took its most explosive turn Thursday 
when Dianne Feinstein, in what she described as retaliation for a negative 
advertisement against her, launched a statewide television attack blasting 
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp for his handling of the Hillside Strangler 
murder case. 
</P>
<P>
The long-threatened action set up a hot-blooded battle for control of the 
airwaves and the emotions of California voters just five days before Feinstein 
and Van de Kamp go before the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
Moving into the campaign's final weekend, voters will be inundated with 
strongly worded, at times hyperbolic, offerings from each of the Democrats. Van 
de Kamp, with consumer advocate Ralph Nader as his point man, accuses Feinstein 
of being a pawn of the insurance industry for backing an industry initiative in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
And Feinstein -- with graphic film of a covered body being carried by deputies 
up a hillside -- accuses Van de Kamp of trying to let loose a killer, Angelo 
Buono. 
</P>
<P>
The eventual appearance of a Hillside Strangler ad had been long rumored in 
political circles. Feinstein and her campaign aides said the decision to air 
the ad was made Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"My opponent's campaign has been a wolf in sheep's clothing from the very 
beginning," Feinstein told reporters outside a hotel ballroom here, where she 
was to speak to about 400 women. 
</P>
<P>
"They set upon a persistent effort really to distort and malign my campaign, my 
husband, my integrity, my record and everything else. . . . There comes a time 
when you have to return some of the punches in a campaign or you might get 
punched out -- and so we're going to return them." 
</P>
<P>
The former San Francisco mayor defended using the 9-year-old Hillside Strangler 
incident in the race for governor. 
</P>
<P>
"It has something to do with the qualities and character of the person being 
elected. I believe that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, in response, said that the Hillside Strangler ad -- and a separate 
criticism of other parts of his prosecutorial record -- were a tacit admission 
by Feinstein that his recent criticism of her is hitting home. 
</P>
<P>
"These ads are nothing more than a panicky response to the fact that Ralph 
Nader has exposed Dianne Feinstein as a pawn of the insurance industry and has 
called her a 'Republican in Democratic clothing,' " Van de Kamp said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll match my record on law and order against hers any day. During my 25 years 
prosecuting criminals, I've helped put away thousands of hardened criminals 
including the Night Stalker and members of the Charlie Manson gang. I've sent 
42 murderers to Death Row and prosecuted another 277 killers on appeal," he 
added. "Mrs. Feinstein has never prosecuted so much as a parking ticket." 
</P>
<P>
At heart, the competing commercials and the ire they have raised in the highly 
charged campaign appear to revolve around the courtship of the Democratic 
Party's liberals and others most likely to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, in taking to the airwaves with Nader on Wednesday, was using a 
symbol of liberalism to undercut Feinstein's persistent support in the polls 
among liberal voters. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the voters Van de Kamp, according to his campaign's strategy, must 
win Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
And Feinstein, in moving to retaliate, was signaling that in this crucial time 
period before the primary, she cannot afford to wait to see if Van de Kamp 
meets with success. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is you don't have the luxury of seeing how this (the Nader ad) is 
going to play," said Feinstein's spokeswoman, Dee Dee Myers. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the exchange of ads is in keeping with the last-minute 
bomb-throwing expected in a state where politics is so dominated by television. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said he decided to air the Nader ad as a preemptory strike against 
any Feinstein criticism of him. Specifically, the attorney general said he 
believed that the Strangler ad was certain to run. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's campaign insisted Thursday that they had no plan to launch their ad 
unless Van de Kamp "went negative," as he did in the Nader ad. The Strangler ad 
was not filmed until Wednesday, the Feinstein campaign said. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, the decision by each campaign to go with high-powered ads had to be 
made by noon today at the latest, when the state's television stations arrange 
for weekend advertising. 
</P>
<P>
The competing strategies carry the potential both for benefit and disaster. 
</P>
<P>
For Van de Kamp, the decision to use Nader as his front man was based on the 
premise, thus far untested, that voters will go along with what the consumer 
advocate has to say. 
</P>
<P>
And while Van de Kamp is pressing ahead with commercials focusing on his 
opponent, polls and political experts insist that he has yet to persuade voters 
to vote for him, instead of merely not for her. 
</P>
<P>
For Feinstein's team, there was concern that after congratulating themselves 
for what the former San Francisco mayor repeatedly called a positive campaign, 
they might ultimately be remembered for among the most brutal of ads. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein on Thursday downplayed that concern: "I don't think it'll hurt my 
reputation. It takes two to have a positive campaign." 
</P>
<P>
But there were signs that the concern was real. Feinstein's campaign said 
Thursday that it plans to resume airing a positive biographical ad on Monday, 
the day before the election. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign also scheduled the Strangler ad to run only 50% of the time, with 
the remaining half of their reserved television space going to a less graphic, 
but still negative, ad. 
</P>
<P>
The fallout of the exchange of ads is likely to persist beyond the primary 
election, to the deficit of whoever wins the primary. With the vitriolic past 
few days, politicians saw less chance for the Democrats to unify quickly after 
the June election. 
</P>
<P>
That will leave Republican Sen. Pete Wilson on the horizon, with an almost 
unlimited bankroll to fire away at what could be a cashed-out Democrat.

SUMMIT: BAKER AND SHEVARDNADZE WILL HOLD SPECIAL SESSIONS ON THE REUNIFIED 
NATION'S NATO ROLE. BUT SOME SAY THE PRESIDENTS ARE MERELY PUTTING THE MATTER 
ON HOLD.

<P>
President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, meeting Thursday at 
their second summit in six months, claimed that they had made progress on the 
overriding question of whether a reunified Germany should belong to the NATO 
military alliance. 
</P>
<P>
But it was unclear if they actually had narrowed their basic differences over 
the issue. Other U.S. officials, speaking not for attribution, said that the 
leaders had merely hit upon a way to shove the explosive problem into the 
future so that it would not spoil their four-day summit here. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, both leaders said that Secretary of State James A. Baker III and 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze would meet in special sessions 
on the issue. But U.S. officials said no timetable has been set for the 
meetings and they may not take place until after the summit. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that Gorbachev had made a proposal on the German issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I took some heart from that," he said after the second of two lengthy 
closed-door sessions with Gorbachev on the opening day of the summit. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, also declaring progress on the German question, told reporters that 
"something had emerged" from his talks with Bush. 
</P>
<P>
In remarks at a White House state dinner, Gorbachev said it was "possible to 
expect major results from this meeting and maybe even . . . the biggest 
results, compared to all the other meetings at previous Soviet-American 
summits. Maybe I'm too optimistic, but let's wait and see. We have two days; I 
believe that maybe we will have those major accords." 
</P>
<P>
He did not specify whether the German issue would be among them. 
</P>
<P>
One U.S. official, however, said that Gorbachev had delivered "no new ideas. . 
. . I just want to dampen the expectations Gorbachev raised." 
</P>
<P>
The German issue hung like a dark cloud over a summit that opened on a bright 
and sunny Washington spring day. The United States has insisted that a united 
Germany be a full partner in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The 
Soviets, adamantly opposed, have suggested that the United States is not 
sufficiently sensitive to the deaths of millions of Soviet citizens in World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
Bush rejected that notion. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States is not insensitive to the fact that the Soviet Union lost 27 
million lives," he said. "I reminded (Gorbachev) I was the only one of the two 
of us" who had actually fought in the war. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was a Navy pilot fighting Japan in the Pacific Theater. Gorbachev was too 
young to participate in the war. 
</P>
<P>
Germany was not the only issue on the minds of the superpower leaders. 
Gorbachev, speaking to a luncheon gathering of American intellectuals, artists 
and entertainers at the Soviet Embassy, delivered an extraordinarily frank 
appraisal of his problems back home. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that he is trying to "figure out how to proceed" with his 
experiments with democracy and a free-market economy. 
</P>
<P>
As he did during his other Washington summit in 1987, Gorbachev also jumped out 
of his limousine and plunged into a sidewalk crowd while on his way from the 
White House to the Soviet Embassy. He shook hands with pedestrians as if he 
were an American politician. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen described the two leaders as upbeat and animated. They said that Bush 
and Gorbachev were prepared to sign a number of agreements today, including one 
calling for a drastic reduction -- and perhaps an eventual ban -- on all 
nuclear weapons and another that would specify major areas of agreement toward 
a 50% reduction in strategic arms. 
</P>
<P>
It was at the embassy luncheon that Gorbachev addressed the difficult 
transition from a centrally planned economy to free markets in his country. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll figure out how to proceed in our country," he told his American 
audience. "We haven't yet done that but the main thing has been done. Having 
understood our country, our history, we have come to the conclusion that we 
cannot proceed as we have been doing all along." 
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that the Soviet system cannot be expected to embrace capitalism 
overnight. "It will be done our way," he said. "Otherwise, if we mechanically 
adopt somebody else's model, this will not work. We know this quite well." 
</P>
<P>
"For the Americans," Gorbachev said, "it's all simple, the talk about the 
market, the credit, the stock markets. All the instruments and all the 
infrastructure for the markets. We have absolutely nothing, nothing for the 
markets. We have to establish the infrastructure." 
</P>
<P>
After the luncheon, one of the guests, former Secretary of State Henry A. 
Kissinger, said that he thought Gorbachev had been quite frank. He said the 
Soviet leader had impressed him as being "extremely serene and at peace with 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
But the German question dominated the day. Both sides were apparently eager to 
report progress and relegate the problem to future negotiations so that it 
would not overshadow other issues, including arms control agreements, economic 
issues and regional disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, although also in an upbeat mood, emphasized that he had "stated and 
restated" the U.S. position on the German question. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically my position is the same as when I went into the meeting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Characterizing his discussions with Gorbachev as civil, he said, "I've been up 
front with him, and he's been up front and direct with me." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, he said, proposed the subsequent Baker-Shevardnadze meetings "to 
keep discussing things, in effect saying: 'I know your position, you know mine. 
Why don't we have our foreign ministers discuss it?' " 
</P>
<P>
But a U.S. official who asked not to be named said that the Baker-Shevardnadze 
meetings were "not particularly" based on progress between the presidents. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely nothing has changed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a White House driveway, Gorbachev, who the day before had warned against the 
West trying to "dictate" to him, reiterated: "I think dictation is 
unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Asked later about that comment, Bush replied, "I'm not attempting to dictate . 
. . but I clearly am entitled to and will put forward the views of the American 
side as forcefully as I can. 
</P>
<P>
"But you don't get any progress if you . . . if you give the impression that 
you're in a situation of dictation. The age of the dictator is over." 
</P>
<P>
Recalling military aggression by Germany in two world wars and the allied 
victory over Nazism in World War II, Gorbachev pointedly declared that he hoped 
"these horrible wars will forever remain a thing of the past." 
</P>
<P>
Bush hailed the inevitable unification of East Germany and West Germany as a 
milestone toward "enduring cooperation in a Europe whole and free." He assured 
Gorbachev that "we can work together at this historic moment" to resolve that 
question and reduce other tensions. 
</P>
<P>
Other U.S. officials seemed to go out of their way to demonstrate sensitivity 
to Gorbachev's political problems at home. They said that they understood the 
Soviet concern that a nation they had helped defeat in World War II might now 
be reconstituted in such a way as to become a military threat again. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Baker pointed out that all Western allies, and even some 
members of the East European Warsaw Pact, maintained that a united Germany with 
full membership in NATO was important to assure European stability. 
</P>
<P>
DESTROYING THE POISON -- The two sides will sign a sweeping pact to eliminate 
chemical weapons, perhaps the century's most abhorrent killing devices. A12 
</P>
<P>
SAVING THE TRIP -- Bush and Gorbachev dodge the explosive German issue, which 
could have turned their summit into an embarrassing failure. A13 
</P>
<P>
HITTING IT OFF -- The two First Ladies greeted each other like old friends on a 
day of smiles, hand-holding and dog-petting. A13 
</P>
<P>
MOOD SWINGS -- Gorbachev began the day in a sober mood, but his manner seemed 
to lighten after private White House meetings and a star-studded luncheon. A14 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EXPERTS VIEW THE SUMMIT 
</P>
<P>
 Should the United States vigorously advocate independence for Lithuania, 
Latvia and Estonia during the summit even at the risk of endangering superpower 
relations? 
</P>
<P>
No. The stakes in the Lithuanian issue are not only high for Gorbachev in 
Moscow, but also high for the United States. The stakes are high for Gorbachev 
because he believes that the entirety of perestroika and change in the Soviet 
Union is involved and he treats the issue in accordance. There is no merit in 
jeopardizing either a productive U.S.-Soviet relationship or the positive 
progress of change in the Soviet Union simply to make a statement about 
Lithuanian independence, especially when that independence is likely to come as 
matter of course. 
</P>
<P>
It is not as though the U.S. is betraying the idea of Lithuanian independence 
by not pressuring Gorbachev at this moment. What we are concerned with is 
making sure that the process of achieving that independence does not destroy a 
great many other very desirable objectives. 
</P>
<P>
Yes. The United States for years recognized the principle of Baltic 
independence. The responsibility of President Bush is now to declare that the 
republics are entitled to independence, that they now have legitimate 
governments, and that, accordingly, we recognize those governments. In my view, 
we could explain to Gorbachev that this is not a provocation. But the real 
choice is not whether to support Gorbachev; it is whether to support 
perestroika. By closing its eyes to the Baltics, the Bush Administration risks 
becoming irrelevant to developments -- or at worst, ending up on the wrong side 
of history.

REYNOLDS MAY GO FROM CAL STATE TO TOP JOB AT CUNY

W. Ann Reynolds, who was forced to resign recently as chancellor of the 
California State University, is the front-runner to head an even more 
politically troubled education system -- the City University of New York. 
</P>
<P>
According to well-placed sources in New York, Reynolds' problems in California 
over secret pay raises and a bad relationship with legislators have not hurt 
her chances to become chancellor of CUNY. Her record in helping to boost 
minority enrollment at Cal State impressed officials at CUNY, where about 65% 
of the students are black or Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the CUNY committee searching for a new chancellor are said to have 
ranked Reynolds first among three finalists. The final selection of a new 
chancellor by CUNY's governing board may be announced today, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
CUNY leaders view Reynolds as the sacrificial lamb in the Cal State pay 
controversy and believe that the Cal State trustees "left her in the lurch" 
after privately approving the large raises for Reynolds and other executives, 
said an official of the faculty union in New York. "She also made a good 
personal impression," the official said of Reynolds' interviews in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds, who is said to be recovering at her Bel-Air home from recent knee 
surgery, declined to comment on her status as a finalist for the CUNY job, 
according to a Cal State spokesman. The other two finalists are reported to be 
Roderic B. Park, vice chancellor of UC Berkeley, who was passed over a few 
months ago in the selection of a new head of the Berkeley campus, and Robert L. 
Hess, president of Brooklyn College in the CUNY system. 
</P>
<P>
With 195,000 students, CUNY is the third-largest higher education system in the 
nation, after the state university system in New York and Cal State. Among 
CUNY's 20 units are such nationally known institutions as Hunter College and 
John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan and lesser known schools in 
Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island. Its current chancellor, Joseph 
S. Murphy, has held the job eight years and intends to return to teaching once 
a successor takes over. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers think that a move from Cal State to CUNY would be like going 
from the frying pan into the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Because of state and city budget crunches in New York, the CUNY faces a painful 
round of cuts. A CUNY chancellor has to find a safe path through New York state 
and city politics, which make California lawmaking look like a polite tea 
party. Also, CUNY is beset by racial tension, most recently shown in the 
takeover of campus buildings last week by minority students demanding more 
black and Latino professors and a minority chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds is white, but being among very few women to achieve her status in 
higher education may help her chances at CUNY, the sources said. Reynolds also 
is a finalist in the running for chancellor of the West Virginia University 
system. 
</P>
<P>
A zoologist, Reynolds was second in command at Ohio State University before 
becoming Cal State Chancellor in 1982. Her tenure as head of the 20-campus Cal 
State system brought expansion and improvement in academic standards but also 
criticism over what some called Reynolds' dictatorial style. 
</P>
<P>
Her forced resignation was announced April 20 as a result of the controversial 
21% to 43% salary increases arranged in secret last year by Cal State trustees 
and Reynolds. Faced with an angry faculty and Legislature, trustees later 
claimed to have been misled about the raises. Reynolds' clout slipped when it 
was revealed that she previously had promised legislators that any pay raise 
decisions would be made in public. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds originally planned to remain at Cal State through October but the 
trustees two weeks ago put her on immediate vacation through July 31 when her 
resignation takes effect. Cal State Hayward President Ellis E. McCune was named 
acting chancellor.

IMELDA MARCOS FAINTS AT TRIAL, IS HOSPITALIZED; 
</P>
<P>
PHILIPPINES: THE FORMER FIRST LADY COUGHS UP BLOOD FROM GASTRITIS, BUT IS 
STABLE. SOURCES SAY SHE HAD CONSIDERED FIRING HER DEFENSE ATTORNEY.

<P>
Imelda Marcos, who had spent some of the previous night considering family 
advice to dismiss her flamboyant defense attorney, collapsed in a federal 
courtroom Thursday morning after coughing up blood and was taken to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The former Philippine first lady's condition was listed as stable and not 
life-threatening. A hospital spokesman said tests found evidence of erosive 
gastritis, or bleeding in the stomach lining. 
</P>
<P>
It was the latest dramatic turn in the fraud and racketeering trial of Mrs. 
Marcos, 60, who last month became emotionally distraught on two occasions and 
suffered episodes of what her doctors called "dangerously high blood pressure." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, Mrs. Marcos had appeared for trial after a nearly 
sleepless night and over the objections of doctors and some of her attorneys, 
who felt she was too ill to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial session she began to cough into her handkerchief and then 
slumped forward in her chair. She was carried out of the courthouse on a 
stretcher, wearing an oxygen mask. Dr. David Case, Mrs. Marcos' personal 
physician, said she had suffered stomach pains and had vomited blood clots. 
</P>
<P>
The Times has learned that in an informal meeting between lawyers and the judge 
prior to Thursday's morning session, Mrs. Marcos' own three-member defense team 
apparently disagreed among themselves about whether the trial should be 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
According to one of those present in the robing room of U.S. Dist. Judge John 
F. Keenan, the judge asked to speak with Mrs. Marcos privately to assure 
himself that she was well enough to proceed, but the request was blocked by her 
lead attorney, Wyoming lawyer Gerry Spence. 
</P>
<P>
"Spence said, 'Well, she wants to go on, so we want to go on,' " a source in 
the robing room recalled, adding that the decision appeared to trouble other 
members of the defense team and the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Marcos is being tried on charges that she and her late husband, former 
Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos, conspired to buy New York real 
estate, art and jewelry with hundreds of millions of dollars looted from their 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported in Thursday's editions that a major schism has developed 
within the defense camp over Spence's conduct of the case. Members of the 
Marcos family have advocated replacing the famous attorney with long-time 
Marcos lawyer John Bartko of San Francisco, who has acted as Spence's assistant 
throughout the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Marcos' collapse, coming barely an hour after other members of the defense 
team had shown frustration at Spence's reluctance to press for a delay, 
appeared to add to Spence's problems with the family and fellow defense 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday, Mrs. Marcos' condition was reportedly improving at New York 
Hospital, where she was expected to remain through the weekend. A hospital 
spokesman said that she would be treated with intravenous medication "for 
several days" and that the affected area was limited to the lining of the lower 
portion of her stomach. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be stress related," conceded Case, who has been treating Mrs. Marcos 
for high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a month Mrs. Marcos has been wearing a portable heart monitor, 
strapped to her arm, that periodically measures her pulse rate and blood 
pressure. Doctors said Thursday's seizure was unrelated to her blood pressure 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the family told The Times that Mrs. Marcos had gotten little 
sleep Wednesday night, after a series of late-evening conferences with 
attorneys, her children and her closest personal advisers to consider various 
options -- including replacement of her lead attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Spence had been harshly admonished for 20 minutes on Wednesday by Judge Keenan, 
who angrily warned the defense lawyer, in front of the jury, that his courtroom 
conduct could conceivably harm his own client. The judge accused Spence of 
making "misleading statements in front of the jury," and Keenan appeared to 
threaten Spence with contempt action if it happened again. 
</P>
<P>
An apologetic Spence at first moved for a mistrial, then withdrew the motion. 
</P>
<P>
The Wyoming attorney, who is noted for taking on difficult cases, has been 
criticized publicly and privately by fellow defense lawyers and Marcos 
associates for sometimes seeming unprepared in court or blundering during 
witness cross-examinations. 
</P>
<P>
Meetings to assess potential damage to Mrs. Marcos' case after the judge's 
angry outburst Wednesday ran late into the night, sources confirmed, and 
included private sessions between Mrs. Marcos and her children, Irene and 
Ferdinand Jr., who have emerged as strong critics of Spence, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, Mrs. Marcos complained of stomach pains. Her blood 
pressure also was elevated, and her doctors advised her to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
"But Mrs. Marcos wanted to proceed," Spence told reporters later. "She was 
insistent on proceeding. She's a very brave lady. I think she's anxious to get 
this trial finished." 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear how her condition would affect the immediate future of the 
two-month-old trial that was nearing completion. Prosecutors had predicted 
earlier that they would rest their case next Tuesday or Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The court was about to take a four-day break even before Mrs. Marcos became 
ill. Only one additional prosecution witness was scheduled to appear when court 
was to resume next week. The defense case, which is expected to be brief, was 
scheduled to begin immediately after the prosecution finished. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Robert Shaheen -- a long-time aide to co-defendant Adnan Khashoggi 
-- had just been cross-examined by Spence when, about 60 minutes into the 
morning session, Mrs. Marcos suddenly began to vomit blood and then fainted. As 
she crumpled in her chair, her head fell forward and banged down on the defense 
table, causing people in the audience to gasp. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Benjamin Cassiday of Hawaii, who had earlier advised Keenan in the 
robing room that Mrs. Marcos was ill, was sitting next to her when she 
collapsed and tried to assist aides who rushed up from the audience to help. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't say anything. She was gagging on her own blood," Cassiday said. He 
told reporters later that Mrs. Marcos had "been looking awful all morning." 
</P>
<P>
Keenan immediately excused the jury and then cleared the courtroom, after which 
Mrs. Marcos was given oxygen and taken by stretcher to an ambulance.

<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff welcomed 895 West Point cadets to the 
ranks of commissioned Army officers Thursday and learned that one of them 
already is gunning for his job. 
</P>
<P>
The ambitious cadet is Kristin Baker, 22, who rose to the top of the academy by 
becoming brigade commander and the first female captain of the corps of cadets. 
</P>
<P>
After Gen. Colin L. Powell told the graduates of the U.S. Military Academy that 
the United States must maintain a strong military, even though "the prospect of 
peace is now more than a dream," he appeared at a news conference with Baker. 
</P>
<P>
Powell noted that he and Baker had been appointed to their present posts on the 
same day last October. Baker then admitted having aspirations to his job. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a long time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"About 30 years," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
"See me in about 30 years," Baker replied. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, born in Dickinson, N.D., de-emphasized her role as a woman in her job as 
brigade commander and said there was still a lot to be done for women at West 
Point. She called her appointment "another step in a long line of steps being 
taken for women" at the 188-year-old school. 
</P>
<P>
Powell, 53, said that the world has changed greatly since he entered the 
military in the 1950s, but he advised the newly commissioned second lieutenants 
to recognize "what has changed and what has not. We must identify what threats 
have receded and which have not." 
</P>
<P>
Powell said he believes Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is "sincere in 
wanting to reform his country as he is in making sure it continues to play a 
dominant role in world affairs." 
</P>
<P>
But Powell said that, despite any economic revolutions, "one fact remains: The 
Soviet Union will still possess thousands of nuclear warheads that can destroy 
America in 30 minutes. We must never allow ourselves to be at a nuclear 
disadvantage." 
</P>
<P>
West Point's 806 male and 89 female graduates this year join a list that 
includes Robert E. Lee, Ulysses S. Grant, Douglas MacArthur and Dwight D. 
Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
Women were admitted to West Point beginning in 1976. The two Rhodes 
Scholarships awarded to cadets this year went to women: Jennie Koch of Potomac, 
Md., and Carolyn Ford of Pensacola, Fla.

'FIBRANNE' AND 'DOUANIER' SPELL DIFFERENCE FOR BEE WINNER, 13

Amy Dimak, 13, of Seattle, won the 63rd annual National Spelling Bee on 
Thursday, correctly spelling "fibranne." 
</P>
<P>
Amy, who wore No. 218 -- the same as last year's winner -- faced off with Eric 
Enders, 13, correctly spelling the word that means a type of cloth, after 
Enders missed "douanier," a customs officer. 
</P>
<P>
Amy won $5,000, a trophy and other prizes. Eric will receive $4,000 for his 
second-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
Eric, who often asked for the definition and origin of the word, correctly 
spelled "querimonious" and "valetudinary," while Amy succeeded with 
"sansculotte" and "lanuginous." 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference after her win, Amy said she knew all of the 11 words she 
had been asked to spell and did not guess at any. But when asked whether she 
was happy she did not have to spell some of the words given to other students, 
she replied: "Definitely." 
</P>
<P>
Amy said she had been studying with a spelling coach for more than a year. In 
recent months she has devoted about two hours a day three times a week to those 
studies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Amy, Eric, Lisa Edwin, 11, of Dwight, Ill., and Tessa Sundaram, 11, of Newtown 
Square, Pa., breezed through the seventh round that began with 12 spellers. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa was the first down in the eighth round, misspelling "confrerie." A total 
of 880 words had been used by the end of the sixth round. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one spellers survived the fifth round, although four-time finalist 
Kanika Bahl, 14, of Beavercreek, Ohio, was eliminated on "papillote."

Bellybutton down the hatches. The 990 new graduates of the "Navel Academy" have 
a serious spelling error on their diplomas. 
</P>
<P>
A printer mistakenly spelled the word "naval" as "navel" on the diplomas passed 
out at Wednesday's commissioning ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Cmdr. Mark Van Dyke said officials detected the mistake on the parchments 
before graduation but decided it was too late to correct the misspelling before 
the commissioning exercises. 
</P>
<P>
"The commercial contractor has agreed to reprint the diplomas and distribute 
them to our graduates at no cost to the government," Van Dyke said.

UNMANNED CRAFT BEARS FOOD, WATER TO 2 COSMONAUTS STRANDED IN SPACE

The Soviet Union said Thursday that it launched an unmanned spacecraft to ferry 
equipment, food and drinking water to cosmonauts stranded since February in the 
orbiting Mir space station. 
</P>
<P>
A special Kristall module, aboard a Proton rocket launched from the Baikonur 
cosmodrome, is scheduled to dock with Mir on June 6, the official Tass news 
agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Insulation on a Soyuz spacecraft carrying cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyov and 
Alexander Balandin to Mir was damaged during its launch Feb. 11, raising fears 
the two could be stranded without a reliable means of returning to earth. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade journal Aviation and Space Week, quoting a visiting Soviet 
cosmonaut, reported two weeks ago that Solovyov and Balandin were left "without 
a reliable vehicle in the event of an emergency." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet space officials said there is no danger to the cosmonauts, adding that 
the damage will not hinder a return flight. However, they said that a space 
walk is planned to allow the cosmonauts to repair the damage. 
</P>
<P>
The report did not say whether the cosmonauts' mission has been extended to 
allow repair of their spacecraft.

A fifth day of ethnic violence in Pakistan's southeastern Sind province left 30 
people dead, including 15 killed in a bus ambush in Karachi, and apparently 
prompted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto to cancel a foreign trip. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities kept a curfew in force for the fourth straight day in Hyderabad, 
where security forces opened fire last Sunday on a crowd of ethnic Mohajir 
women protesters, killing an estimated 70 people and touching off a violent 
round of revenge attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Parts of Karachi also were under curfew Thursday and soldiers patrolled the 
streets in both cities in an effort to prevent clashes between the ethnic 
Mohajirs, who settled in Pakistan at the time it achieved independence from 
India in 1947, and natives of Sind province. 
</P>
<P>
More than 170 people have been killed in the latest round of ethnic strife. 
Bhutto, a native of Sind, traveled to the province Wednesday and issued an 
emotional appeal for calm. 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister Thursday indefinitely postponed a trip to four Middle 
Eastern countries that was scheduled to start Saturday, apparently because of 
the conflict in Sind province, and she consulted throughout the day with the 
chief minister of Sind, Shaban Mirani. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's worst incident came about 7 p.m. when gunmen opened fire on a city 
bus carrying passengers from downtown Karachi to one of the suburbs. Hospital 
sources said 15 people were killed in the incident and 35 were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen other people were slain during Thursday's violence, most of them shot 
by snipers active in the city.

PALESTINIAN HUNGER STRIKERS FEAR SETBACK IN PEACE EFFORT;

UPRISING: THE RAID ON ISRAEL REVEALS ARAB DISUNITY AND COULD LEAD TO NEW

News of the stymied beach raid by Palestinian guerrillas blanketed a group of 
local Palestinian leaders on a hunger strike here with despair and no little 
discomfort at having to answer questions about whether they approved of the 
failed assault or not. 
</P>
<P>
The despair Thursday was not over the outcome of Wednesday's raid, which left 
four attackers dead and 12 others captured; some mused privately that it would 
have been far worse if the attackers had succeeded, especially if they had 
killed innocent bathers. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, there was a feeling of having lost control of events and of being 
shunted aside by the Palestine Liberation Organization at a critical moment in 
a campaign to convince the Israeli public of their peaceful intentions. 
Unwilling to condemn the seaborne attack, they were left to offer gloomy 
predictions of more violence to come if peace talks do not get under way. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was the one to take the decision, I would not send such an operation," 
said Faisal Husseini, a top political leader in the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
and a chief contact for the PLO. "I myself believe that nonviolence can 
accomplish more. We are in a cycle in which violence creates more violence." 
</P>
<P>
Husseini pleaded that the raid not result in a diplomatic setback for 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't put the Palestinians in a corner. We need steps to convince Palestinians 
that nonviolence works," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Husseini and up to 20 other Palestinians have been fasting since May 20, when 
an Israeli gunman shot and killed seven Palestinian day laborers. With the 
hunger strike, the Palestinians hoped to seize the initiative and win 
diplomatic progress toward peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
With the raid, their effort has been drowned out; the United States has 
indicated that it might break off contact with the PLO unless the organization 
expels Mohammed Abbas, better known as Abul Abbas, who masterminded this attack 
as well as the 1985 hijacking of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro. 
</P>
<P>
"We are working at cross-purposes," a hunger striker said of the PLO. "It would 
be better if they left the struggle inside the occupied territory to us." 
</P>
<P>
No one was willing to say such a thing and put his name to it, making the group 
vulnerable to charges that everyone fears contradicting the PLO publicly. By 
way of contrast, all were willing to condemn the placing of a bomb in a 
Jerusalem market last week as a terrorist act, even in the face of calls from 
young street activists to praise it as an act of revenge. 
</P>
<P>
And none of the hunger strikers were willing to support the expulsion of Abul 
Abbas. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think everyone in the PLO is savory. But not everyone in the Israeli 
government is savory, either, and no one is making it a condition for contact 
that Israel expel them," said Sari Nusseibeh, another public leader. 
</P>
<P>
"In every Palestinian, there is burning anger. Every Palestinian is a potential 
Abul Abbas. The only way to stop the anger is to start a peace process." 
</P>
<P>
It was perhaps not an auspicious day for daring words of moderation: Two 
teen-agers were shot to death in the West Bank on Thursday -- one, a 
14-year-old boy, by a soldier; the other, a 17-year-old, by an Arab who 
collaborates with the Israeli government. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders like Nusseibeh and Husseini have been under pressure from grass-roots 
leaders of the intifada, or uprising, as well as from Muslim fundamentalists, 
to escalate the Arab uprising to the point of taking up firearms. It is 
generally considered that such an escalation would diminish the role of the 
public leadership, which has been trying to lay the public opinion groundwork 
among Israelis in favor of diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 12 days of the hunger strike, Husseini has been debating 
visiting student groups over the wisdom of nonviolence and civil disobedience. 
The Palestinian students proposed a step up in violence as a means of driving 
Israel out of the West Bank and Gaza, a policy Husseini opposes. 
</P>
<P>
The fast is expected to continue one or two more days. Six strikers have been 
hospitalized for dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government seized on the beach raid as proof that the PLO is 
irredeemably dedicated to terrorism and an unworthy partner in peace talks. The 
government of caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir rejects both the PLO and 
demands for an independent Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of government officials, the strong American criticism of the 
assault vindicated Shamir's refusal to accept an invitation from U.S. Secretary 
of State James A. Baker III to open peace talks with a Palestinian delegation 
that would include PLO contacts. "Things are working in our favor," said 
government spokesman Yossi Olmert. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department informed Israel of its decision to press for the ouster of 
Abul Abbas from the PLO, Israeli officials said. 
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, on a visit to Jordan, also urged the 
PLO to disown the attack and punish any of its factions that might have been 
involved.

U.S. VETOES U.N. RESOLUTION CALLING FOR FACT-FINDING TRIP TO WEST BANK, GAZA

The United States on Thursday vetoed a Security Council resolution calling for 
a council fact-finding mission to report on abuses of Palestinians in Israel's 
occupied territories. The vote was 14 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Arab states said the U.S. veto demonstrated the international isolation of the 
United States and Israel on Middle East issues. 
</P>
<P>
"This resolution does not focus on the real need to move the peace process 
forward," U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said. "Rather, it could too 
easily become a vehicle which could be misused to generate more needless 
controversy," he told the 15-member council after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"This appears more likely to add to the problems, rather than help resolve the 
peace process in the region," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, the U.S. ambassador said, favors an envoy dispatched by the 
U.N. secretary general to investigate violence in the territories. 
</P>
<P>
Israel, however, opposes any fact-finding mission, and Israeli officials said 
they will not permit U.N. officials or Security Council members to enter its 
territory.

YELTSIN PLEDGES TO SEEK PEACE WITH GORBACHEV

Boris N. Yeltsin, the new president of the Russian Federation and a leading 
critic of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said Thursday that he will try to make peace in 
his personal feud with the Soviet president. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, a radical reformer, was quoted by the official Tass news agency as 
saying that he will put aside personal differences with Gorbachev when the 
president returns from the Washington summit. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was seeking to calm the fears of the deputies of the republic's 
Congress about his stormy relationship with Gorbachev, his former mentor. 
</P>
<P>
In his new position as president of Russia, the largest Soviet republic, 
Yeltsin has a formidable platform from which to challenge and criticize 
Gorbachev, who opposed his election. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies speaking Thursday at the Russian Congress "expressed concern over the 
exchange of statements about each other" by Yeltsin and Gorbachev, Tass 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin answered that after Gorbachev returns June 4 from the summit in 
Washington, "I think we'll have an appropriate conversation, and we'll resolve 
most issues without damaging the sovereignty and aims of Russia," Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Wednesday, Yeltsin called for achieving Russian 
"sovereignty" within 100 days. The term is used here to mean not independence, 
but autonomy in most internal decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also urged the Kremlin to allow the other 14 republics to enjoy the 
same autonomy, making the country a federation of states that could overrule 
the central government on most matters. 
</P>
<P>
Although Yeltsin said he wanted a "businesslike" relationship with Gorbachev, 
he also made an oblique call Thursday for Gorbachev to give up one of his 
posts: either Soviet president or Communist Party general secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"I am against combining any post in one person," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Ottawa on Tuesday, Gorbachev said he was "somewhat concerned" about 
Yeltsin's victory and feared that if Yeltsin "is playing a political game, then 
we may be in for a difficult time." 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's session of the Russian Congress, Deputy Ivan Galushko from the 
Jewish Autonomous Region in the Soviet Far East said Yeltsin was overstepping 
his authority in some of the statements he made the day before. 
</P>
<P>
He called on Yeltsin "to refrain from hasty statements on questions that are 
within the competence of the Congress or Supreme Soviet." Tass said that many 
deputies seconded Galushko's opinion.

Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov was slightly injured Wednesday in a collision 
between his limousine and a military troop bus, the official Tass news agency 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
One of the 20 soldiers in the bus and one of the people traveling with Ryzhkov 
were also hurt, Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the injuries were not made public, but Tass said that all were 
minor. 
</P>
<P>
Boris Koryakovtsev, chief of the Interior Ministry road inspection department, 
told Tass the accident occurred on the Rublev-Uspensk highway west of downtown 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said the military bus was heading toward the convoy that included 
Ryzhkov's limousine. When one of the escort cars in the convoy flashed its 
lights, the bus driver swerved to the right, hit a curb and lost control. 
</P>
<P>
"The bus spun and blocked the road, prompting the collision," Tass said. 
"According to the information of the militia, the accident was due to the lack 
of experience of the military driver."

China has shortened the sentences of 116 prisoners at a labor camp in western 
Qinghai province for good behavior during an earthquake last April that knocked 
down a camp wall and opened their way to freedom, an official newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai newspaper Wen Hui Bao said 52 of the prisoners had already gained 
their freedom as a reward for not fleeing or for helping to rescue people 
trapped in rubble nearby by the magnitude 6.9 quake that killed 126 people.

'NEW WAY OF THINKING' -- MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENTS

Following are excerpts from messages delivered by Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev and President Bush in the capital Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, speaking to Americans at the Soviet Embassy: 
</P>
<P>
. . . We have to adopt a new way of thinking to each other. And it looks as if 
we'll have to proceed from competition to cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Let's not hurry, because such changes do not happen overnight. Because only in 
Lithuania, they can overnight decide a question about seceding from the Soviet 
Union, and after that they are at a loss what to do, and we are at a loss what 
to do. . . . That is one way of proceeding. . . . But there is another one 
which is more right, it is more humane. That is to be very cautious. . . . So 
let us not hasten to undertake certain measures. And if we manage to pass from 
confrontation to competition to cooperation, that would indeed be a major 
achievement. . . . 
</P>
<P>
We recall the '30s when there was cooperation in building plants and factories 
in our countries. Memories are still alive in the minds of our people, and we 
feel very good feelings toward the American people. . . . And this year, during 
the day of my birthday, I received an enormous number of congratulations and 
98% from the United States of America. . . . 
</P>
<P>
So, we have the atmosphere in which we could promote such trends in the 
relations between our two countries. This is not an easy task. . . . But it 
seems to me that we haven't had a better time to undertake changes than today. 
And we are now at a watershed, at a very crucial moment and we are prepared. . 
. . We had different camps, different civilizations, but, well, we found out 
that we live in one world, in one civilization. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I said to the President and I am repeating it now, that some people say that we 
could apply some pressure on the Soviet Union because it's enfeebled now. But 
how can you say that . . . when perestroika is under way, it's going on, and 
all the instability, all the changes are but an indication of its fundamental 
nature. We are changing our political system, we are working to develop a new 
economic system. . . . That will not be like in the United States, in Germany, 
because that will be our unique way, because we would flounder if we decide to 
simply adopt the ways that are current in some other country. . . . At any 
rate, we'll have to travel down this road because we have no other choice, and 
the only thing to decide is. . . . how rapid our progress should be, and what 
would be its modalities. 
</P>
<P>
But now we are experiencing a crucial period of time. Like never before, we 
want to be understood right now. . . . 
</P>
<P>
When you introduce a market economy, then you give an incentive to those who 
work. And those who would like to sponge . . . who would like to get unearned 
pay, they would be in a difficult spot. . . . And today, during my discussion 
on this particular topic . . . it was said (not by President Bush) that it's 
difficult to be half-pregnant with introducing a market economy. I said, 'I 
agree, but at any rate one has to wait nine months before a child is born'. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
We'll be traveling down this road (but) the major difficulty is that we have 
become accustomed to certain ways of thinking about market. Americans know 
pretty well about what a market is . . . but we are innocent, so to say, as far 
as a market is concerned. We have to start from scratch. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bush at arrival ceremony: 
</P>
<P>
. . .We have seen a world of change this past year, and now on the horizon, we 
see what just one short year ago seemed a distant dream. A continent truly 
divided East and West has begun to heal with the dawn of self-determination and 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
In Germany, where the Wall once stood, a nation moves toward unity, and peace, 
and freedom, and in the nations of the most heavily militarized continent on 
earth, at last we see the long era of confrontation giving way to the prospect 
of enduring cooperation in a Europe whole and free. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. President, you deserve great credit for your part in these transforming 
events. I salute you, as well, for process of change you've brought to your own 
country. . . . And we in the United States applaud the new course the Soviet 
Union has chosen. We see the spirited debate in the Congress of People's 
Deputies, in the Soviet press, among the Soviet people. We know about the 
difficult economic reforms that are necessary to breathe new vigor into the 
Soviet economy, and as I've said many times before, we want to see perestroika 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Since our meeting in Malta, we have reached agreements in important areas, each 
one proof that when mutual respect prevails, progress is possible. But the 
agreements we've reached cannot cause us to lose sight of some of the 
differences that remain. Lithuania is one such issue. 
</P>
<P>
We believe that good faith dialogue between the Soviet leaders and 
representatives of the Baltic peoples is the proper approach and we hope to see 
that process go forward. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This summit will be a working summit. . . . In a larger sense, though, the 
success of this summit depends not on the agreements we will sign, but on our 
efforts to lay the groundwork for overcoming decades of division and discord, 
to build a world of peace in freedom. . . .

President Bush invited Hollywood stars, media moguls and political luminaries 
to join Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev for an evening of Maine lobster and opera 
arias at Thursday's glittering state dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The White House was decked out in white peonies and red roses, with President 
Lyndon B. Johnson's flower-edged china in place for guests at the biggest 
social event of the year in the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
The Gorbachevs arrived for the black-tie gala evening dressed simply, Soviet 
style -- the Soviet president in a dark business suit, Raisa Gorbachev in a 
tea-length black, pink and green floral dress with a flowing skirt. 
</P>
<P>
They stepped from their limousine onto the red carpet at the White House front 
steps where they were greeted by the tuxedo-clad American President and his 
wife Barbara, who wore a sapphire blue gown, with fitted bodice and sweeping 
skirt. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in remarks prepared for his toast, praised the Soviet president "for 
creating within the Soviet Union a commitment to change." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. President," Bush told his counterpart, "it is said that your country is 
the land of possibilities. You have demonstrated the truth of that statement, 
and we've seen this past year that ours is a world of possibilities, that ours 
is a time of historic change, a time when men and nations can transform 
history." 
</P>
<P>
The Bushes added a personal touch to the menu, serving lobster from their 
longtime summer vacation state, Maine. 
</P>
<P>
And, in light of the Soviet fondness for opera, they enlisted one of the 
world's foremost mezzo-sopranos, Frederica von Stade, to sing for the guests in 
the East Room following dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Tables were done in red tablecloths with white napkins, with crystal bowls on 
mirror plateaus filled with white peonies, white ixia and red roses. 
</P>
<P>
Complementing the lobster served en gelee, the menu for the evening featured 
corn sticks, roasted filet of beef mascotte with green peppercorn sauce, 
asparagus with sauce aveline, mixed salad, Saint Pauline cheese, and dessert of 
lime turban with iced raspberries and friandises candies. 
</P>
<P>
Guests invited to mingle with the Soviet Union's first couple and other members 
of their entourage included former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and 
Los Angeles industrialist Armand Hammer, who has conducted business in the 
Soviet Union for many years. 
</P>
<P>
Also holding coveted tickets to the dinner were such celebrities as Academy 
Award-winning actress Jessica Tandy; Tandy's husband, Hume Cronyn; Academy 
Award nominee Morgan Freeman; NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw and evangelist Billy 
Graham. Tandy and Freeman starred together in last year's Academy Award best 
picture, "Driving Miss Daisy." 
</P>
<P>
Others who made the list of invitees, in addition to various Cabinet members 
and Administration officials, were: Bush's son Neil and his wife Sharon of 
Denver; New York Times Chairman Arthur Ochs Sulzberger and Washington Post 
Publisher Donald Graham; Time Magazine columnist Hugh Sidey; Los Angeles movie 
mogul Jerry Weintraub; Ford Motor Co. Chairman Harold Poling; National Urban 
League President John Jacob and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional leaders also were invited. 
</P>
<P>
As a side note to the festivities, the Gorbachevs and Bushes exchanged the 
customary official gifts. The President chose to give Gorbachev a five-volume 
biography, "Life of George Washington," by Chief Justice John Marshall. The 
Soviet leader's present for Bush was an antique painting of Russian birch 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Bush chose an elegant Judith Leiber gold-and-rhinestone-trimmed handbag 
for Raisa Gorbachev. Mrs. Gorbachev presented Mrs. Bush with a decorative 
enameled tea set. 
</P>
<P>
For table settings, Barbara Bush decided to use the flower-edged china bought 
during President Lyndon B. Johnson's Administration. She selected that setting 
over place settings that Nancy Reagan bought after deciding the Johnson dishes 
were not elegant enough for a state dinner. 
</P>
<P>
During dessert, the Air Force strolling strings orchestra played for the dinner 
guests, and the Marine orchestra tuned up for music in the grand entrance hall 
for after-dinner dancing.

With the superpower summit as a backdrop, relief officials from the United 
States and Soviet Union on Thursday announced creation of a private volunteer 
organization to provide medical, environmental and agricultural assistance to 
developing nations. 
</P>
<P>
Called Operation USA/USSR, the Peace Corps-like project will begin by sending 
teams of doctors to Mexico, its organizers said at a news conference coinciding 
with the first day of discussions between President Bush and Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
The privately financed project is sponsored by three organizations: Operation 
USA, an 11-year-old, Los Angeles-based relief group; the Soviet Academy of 
Sciences, a quasi-governmental agency, and the Soviet Peace Committee, a 
private organization. 
</P>
<P>
The joint venture was unveiled by Richard Walden, director of Operation USA, 
and Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, Walden said he will seek funds from corporations doing 
business in the Soviet Union and in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
A six-member team of American, Soviet and Mexican doctors, all volunteering a 
year's service, will be sent to Mexico City to work at a suburban clinic 
originally set up by Operation USA after the 1985 earthquake. The U.S. 
physicians will be recruited from UCLA Medical Center, the sponsors said.

Beset by crises at home, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev displayed a 
serious and thoughtful mood for most -- but hardly all -- of his public 
appearances Thursday in a capital city of officials and experts anxious to 
gauge his demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
In his most dramatic venture, in fact, Gorbachev, exhibiting his trademark 
unpredictability, hopped from his limousine a couple of blocks from the White 
House in the late afternoon for a little politicking and flesh-pressing. 
</P>
<P>
As a handful of startled office workers and tourists looked on, Gorbachev 
stepped onto the sidewalk at the corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and 15th Street 
Northwest, across from the Treasury Building. The crowd soon swelled to about 
100 people. As Gorbachev, followed closely by Secret Service and KGB agents, 
rushed into the crowd, many onlookers cried out: "We love you! We love you!" 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev began the day somewhat glumly but, as the good fellowship of the day 
progressed, his manner seemed to lighten. Both White House Press Secretary 
Marlin Fitzwater and Soviet presidential spokesman Arkady A. Maslennikov, in 
fact, insisted that Gorbachev, like Bush, was animated and in good spirits in 
their private meetings in the White House. But, for most of the day, the Soviet 
leader seemed troubled in public, though not depressed, sober though not 
somber. 
</P>
<P>
Private Americans had their closest look at the Soviet President on two 
occasions -- when he hosted a luncheon at the Soviet Embassy in honor of 
"American intellectuals" and later when he walked into the crowd near the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
The luncheon guest list included actress Jane Fonda; actors Gregory Peck, 
Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Burt Lancaster and Robert Redford; pianist Van Cliburn; 
trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie; playwright Arthur Miller; economist John Kenneth 
Galbraith; industrialist Armand Hammer; television mogul Ted Turner; television 
evangelist Robert Schuller; science fiction writers Ray Bradbury and Isaac 
Asimov; artists Andrew Wyeth and Robert Rauschenberg; black leader Jesse 
Jackson, former Sen. Eugene McCarthy and former Secretary of State Henry A. 
Kissinger. 
</P>
<P>
Toasting his guests, Gorbachev made a plea for American understanding of his 
country's plight as it tries to revolutionize its political and economic 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"Like never before, we want to be understood right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Smiling slightly, he said that the Soviet people have to learn the market 
system from scratch; they have had no real experience with it. An American had 
told him, he recalled, that the Soviet Union must not hesitate about the market 
system -- it must plunge in. 
</P>
<P>
" 'You cannot be half-pregnant,' " he quoted the American as saying. 
</P>
<P>
But, Gorbachev added, "It is also true that it takes nine months to produce a 
baby." With a laugh, the Soviet president said that an aide had reminded him 
that a pregnancy sometimes ends one or two months earlier. In short, Gorbachev 
made it clear, the Soviet Union needs time, though it knows the time is 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
Then Gorbachev, as if to show that he did not want to mask his seriousness in 
too much wit, turned abruptly from the laughter to re-emphasize his point. 
</P>
<P>
"So we have to work on this," he said. "Our people are not all prepared to 
accept this." 
</P>
<P>
Later, he astounded less prominent Americans by walking up to them near the 
White House. "When I saw him coming, I was just paralyzed. For the first time 
in my life, I was speechless," said Helen Boussalis of Glendale, a professor of 
engineering at Cal State Los Angeles, who was in Washington for a convention of 
women engineers. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to ask him a question about Germany, about the Russian economy, but I 
was so shocked I couldn't speak. He looked so nice, so peaceful, just like a 
human being. He's so different from on TV. He seems so cold and so serious." 
</P>
<P>
Another of the engineers, Charlena Grimes, an administrator at the engineering 
school at Washington State University, said that the only question she heard 
was a general query about whether the summit would lead to world peace. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't hear very well, but the translator said, 'It's not going to be 
easy, but we're going to do it.' The crowd then started shouting: "We love you! 
We love you." 
</P>
<P>
Added a stunned Grimes: "I can't wait to get on the phone and start calling 
people, especially my 82-year-old father, and say: 'Dad, there will be peace. 
There will.' " 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev began the day in an uncharacteristic way: standing silently, almost 
glumly, as President Bush read a speech of welcome on a platform set up on the 
South Lawn of the White House. Even when Bush thanked his visitor for bringing 
his wife, Raisa, back to Washington and thus bringing "joy to all our hearts," 
Gorbachev made no gesture of acknowledgement. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush escorted Gorbachev into the Oval Office in the White House, reporters 
started to pepper the Soviet leader with questions. But Gorbachev, who seemed 
to enjoy such banter at previous summits, warded them off. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been told by the President that the current policy is there are no 
questions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The luncheon at the Soviet Embassy filled most of Gorbachev's time between his 
meetings at the White House. The American celebrities were obviously delighted 
with their celebrity host. 
</P>
<P>
"What did he want with us?" said Asimov later. "Simply to make contact, to talk 
with the creative movers of the world . . . somebody other than politicians." 
</P>
<P>
The luncheon clearly put Gorbachev in a better mood. When he returned to the 
White House, he stopped to talk with American television reporters and did the 
same when he left the White House in late afternoon. He spoke glibly, so 
quickly that his interpreter had to interrupt from time to time to catch up in 
English. And then, as if to show that his mood had truly changed, at least for 
a while, he stopped his limousine and walked into the crowd.

BUSH DRAWS CONSERVATIVES' THUMBS UP WITH BRIEF, MILD MENTION OF LITHUANIA

When President Bush welcomed Mikhail S. Gorbachev in a ceremony on the South 
Lawn of the White House on Thursday, he could not refrain from including one 
brief passage on Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear what Gorbachev thought about the mildly worded statement, in 
which Bush cited Lithuania as an issue on which the two nations still have 
differences and encouraged "good-faith dialogue" between Soviet and Lithuanian 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev remained impassive when Bush's remarks were translated. But Bush, in 
any case, obviously had another audience in mind -- domestic conservatives who 
have criticized him for not being tough enough on the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
For this audience, Bush's remarks worked perfectly. At the mention of 
Lithuania, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who was in the audience on the White House 
South Lawn, tapped an aide on the shoulder, smiled and flashed a thumbs up 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
No American entrepreneur has a greater interest in the political longevity of 
Gorbachev than Misha G. Knight, the Washington manufacturer and hawker of 
Gorbachev T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
Knight, who emigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union a dozen years 
ago and changed his name from Misha Nete, is making the rounds from Lafayette 
Park to the National Press Club to the summit press center at George Washington 
University with a suitcase of his shirts. 
</P>
<P>
Sporting a formal bow tie over a T-shirt, Knight, who also acts as a consultant 
for investors intent on doing business in the Soviet Union, explained that he 
writes poetry to go along with his T-shirts. One verse, printed on a shirt, 
brims with lyrical promise: 
</P>
<P>
I went to Russia to meet the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, I met people who like the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
 We are one world. 
</P>
<P>
 We are one world. 
</P>
<P>
 We like to wear Gorby T-Shirts. 
</P>
<P>
Knight held up an envelope with an air ticket for San Francisco, Gorbachev's 
final stop in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to make a living," the T-shirt man said. 
</P>
<P>
The headquarters of the National Geographic Society is just across 16th Street 
from the Soviet Embassy, where Gorbachev is staying during the summit. But this 
gave the National Geographic's famous photographers no advantage in 
picture-taking. Security was so intense that the Secret Service even kept 
National Geographic photographers away from the block. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Geographic press officer Barbara Moffit said that the Secret Service 
had warned all employees "to stay away from the windows on the 16th Street 
side, that any movement there would be considered threatening." 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of curious onlookers had to congregate on the street corners a block 
away from the embassy itself in hopes of catching a glimpse of Gorbachev or the 
American celebrities, such as Gregory Peck and Jane Fonda, whom he had invited 
to lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Police sealed off the entire street with yellow tape. Uniformed officers were 
stationed on all four corners, and anti-terrorist concrete barriers were placed 
in the intersections. 
</P>
<P>
Suppose you are President of the United States and you have one last minute to 
wait before the president of the Soviet Union comes riding up the White House 
driveway in his black limousine. What is the final thing you do before your 
guest arrives? 
</P>
<P>
George Bush provided an answer Thursday morning. As he waited for Gorbachev to 
show up, he quickly looked into his suit coat pocket to make sure the text of 
his speech was still there. 
</P>
<P>
After attending Gorbachev's luncheon for American intellectuals, former 
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger described the Soviet leader as "serene" 
and "very relaxed" during the session. But Kissinger could not resist adding 
that, in the long run, Gorbachev faces serious challenges to his continued 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"Revolutionaries are often consumed by their own revolutions," Kissinger said. 
</P>
<P>
When George Washington University officials put up the Soviet flag in the 
university gymnasium that is doubling as the press center for the summit, they 
mounted it with the hammer and sickle in the upper right corner rather than the 
upper left. After a former Moscow correspondent pointed this out, university 
officials rushed to change things around, finishing the job just in time for 
the first joint press briefing by White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater 
and Soviet presidential press secretary Arkady A. Maslennikov.

CREWS FIGHT TO KEEP FUEL SPILL OUT OF ALASKA REFUGE 
</P>

<P>
Railroad crews were struggling Thursday to keep an estimated 120,000 gallons of 
spilled jet and diesel fuel from seeping through one of the richest waterfowl 
nesting areas in North America. 
</P>
<P>
The fuel was spilled Monday when 19 tanker cars on a state-owned Alaska 
railroad jumped the tracks and overturned along a remote stretch of line 40 
miles southwest of Fairbanks. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred on the edge of a vast wetlands system that is the spring 
and summer home to an estimated 12 million ducks, geese and other migratory 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
Beaver ponds alongside the track kept most of the fuel from flowing into a 
series of marshes, meandering creeks and lakes nearby, state environmental 
authorities said. The beaver pools, formed by stick-and-mud dams, gave railroad 
workers time to move cleanup equipment into place and begin pumping up the 
spilled fuel. 
</P>
<P>
"But for the grace of God, and a few beavers, we'd have a major, major 
problem," said Rex Blazer, director of the Northern Alaska Environmental 
Center, a private Fairbanks conservation group. 
</P>
<P>
By Thursday, the derailed cars had been cleared from the tracks, and the line 
reopened, although much of the spilled fuel in the ponds had not yet been 
removed, according to Pete McGee, the regional supervisor for the Alaska 
Department of Environmental Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife biologists and others were concerned that large amounts of fuel could 
still seep into a nearby creek and spread quickly through the spongy marsh if 
not cleaned up soon. 
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of dead animals or fish, but patches of oily sheen were 
spotted several miles downstream from the derailment, and officials reported a 
mixture of fuel and water was leaking through one of the beaver dams at a rate 
of about 200 gallons a minute. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been going pretty slowly, and we've been encouraging the railroad to get 
into higher gear," said Chuck Kleeschulte, a spokesman for the Department of 
Environmental Conservation. "They've been having a number of problems. . . . 
They didn't have the right hoses. Their nozzles didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
The fuel, being shipped south to Anchorage from a refinery east of Fairbanks, 
is more toxic than crude oil. But it is also lighter and will evaporate within 
days if exposed to air, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 11 million gallons of crude oil leaked into Alaska's Prince William 
Sound when the Exxon Valdez ran aground a year ago in America's biggest oil 
spill. That spill aside, this week's train accident ranks among the largest 
toxic spills ever in Alaska, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt in the derailment. A spokeswoman for the railroad, which runs a 
single line between Fairbanks, Anchorage and the southern coast of the state, 
said no cause had been established. A faulty switch is suspected. 
</P>
<P>
The spill occurred on the edge of the Minto Flats State Game Refuge, a 
500,000-acre block of wilderness that is home to northern pike and other 
freshwater fish, as well as river otters, wolves, black bears and moose. A 
recent survey by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game found an average of 213 
nesting ducks per square mile, one of the highest concentrations on the 
continent, and the area is one of the richest habitats in the world for 
trumpeter swans. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another worry was that brush fires could spread into the wetlands 
and reach the spilled fuel. Crews have been battling wild fires all week about 
20 miles south of the derailment.

NASA SEARCH CONTINUES FOR SHUTTLE LEAK

<P>
NASA workers found a tiny leak in Columbia's rear engine compartment Thursday 
but judged it too small to have caused the hydrogen leak that delayed the 
shuttle launch. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling is at this point that's probably not what they're looking for," 
said Bruce Buckingham, a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The search was to continue through the day, being halted long enough for 
Columbia's on-board fuel tanks to be drained. Officials planned to increase 
pressure on the shuttle's external tank, which is filled with helium, in an 
attempt to find the main leak, Buckingham said. 
</P>
<P>
The external tank was being filled with more than a half-million gallons of 
super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen Tuesday when the leak was 
detected. NASA promptly called off the launch and drained the explosive 
propellant. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers believe the leak is in or near a 17-inch valve in a pipe that carries 
fuel from the external tank to the main engines. 
</P>
<P>
If the leak is detected and repairs can be made at the launch pad, Columbia 
might be ready to lift off by the middle of next week. But, if Columbia has to 
be returned to a hangar, the delay would be about a month, NASA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's astronomy mission, with a $150-million observatory called Astro, 
already had been delayed two weeks because of repairs to the shuttle's cooling 
system. The latest postponement will mean even more changes to Astro's 
observing schedule. 
</P>
<P>
One of the prime targets, Comet Austin, is speeding away from Earth, making 
observations more difficult with every passing day. Halley's Comet was to have 
been studied had the mission proceeded as scheduled in March, 1986, but the 
Challenger explosion pushed the launch date back.

Flash floods fed by up to seven inches of rain forced closure of low-lying 
roads and chased hundreds of people from their homes Thursday. Some residents 
fled in boats. 
</P>
<P>
Creeks that empty into the rain-swollen Mississippi River overflowed their 
banks in heavy thunderstorms. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had flash flooding all day. It hit pretty suddenly," said Warren County 
Sheriff Paul Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett said more than 130 houses in the city were flooded and between 30 and 
40 homes in county territory have been flooded. "A lot of them have lost 
everything they had," he said. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported, the sheriff said. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Ray Mabus declared a state of emergency in Warren County and called out 
the Mississippi National Guard to help officials and residents deal with the 
flooding.

BUDGET PANEL LEADERS OPPOSE PRISON BOND ISSUE

<TEXT>
<P>
The heads of the Legislature's two budget committees Thursday supported efforts 
to defeat Proposition 120, the $450-million prison bond issue on Tuesday's 
ballot, saying the state can't afford it because of a looming budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"The prisons are breaking our backs and breaking our banks," said Assemblyman 
John Vasconcellos (D-San Jose), chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alfred E. Alquist (D-San Jose), chairman of the Senate Budget and Fiscal 
Review Committee, said the $2-billion annual Corrections Department budget has 
become "a fiscal black hole" drawing money away from programs for the homeless 
and needy. 
</P>
<P>
"I, for one, have become very tired of providing $100-million palaces for our 
criminals while we have law-abiding citizens sleeping in the streets," Alquist 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 120 is the latest in a series of prison construction measures that 
state officials say are necessary to keep up with the huge surge in inmates 
that began in the early 1980s with a wave of new felony sentencing laws. The 
measure would allow the issuance of $450 million in bonds to pay for 
construction of a new prison in Imperial County and finance additional 
construction and land acquisition projects. Principal and interest payments 
over 20 years to pay off the bonds would amount to $805 million. 
</P>
<P>
The comments by Vasconcellos and Alquist come against the backdrop of a 
$3.6-billion gap between the cost of providing state services next year and the 
money that will be available from tax collections. 
</P>
<P>
Vasconcellos said this is the first time he has opposed a prison bond issue. He 
also vowed to oppose any more felony sentencing bills. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers appeared at a Capitol news conference with other opponents of 
Proposition 120. Barbara Bloom, representing a coalition of groups operating as 
the Criminal Justice Consortium, noted that more than half the state's 90,000 
prisoners are now incarcerated for nonviolent crimes. She said that in 1989 
California imprisoned 34,000 people for technical parole violations, compared 
to a combined 19,000 prisoners incarcerated in the other 49 states for similar 
offenses.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGN

<P>
The race: Governor. Whose ads?: Democrat Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
Dianne Feinstein began airing on Thursday an attack on Atty. Gen. John K. Van 
de Kamp's handling of the Hillside Strangler murder case. She also will air a 
second ad on other Van de Kamp actions during his tenure as Los Angeles County 
district attorney and as attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 Elements of the ads, with analysis by Times political writer Cathleen Decker: 
</P>
<P>
Ad: The advertisement opens with a picture of Van de Kamp and the date, July 
13, 1981. The picture fades out, but the date remains, and over it is heard Van 
de Kamp's voice: "At this point there is insufficient evidence to file." A 
narrator adds: "The day John Van de Kamp tried to drop murder charges against 
the Hillside Strangler." 
</P>
<P>
A picture of Angelo Buono, convicted in nine of the 10 murders with which he 
was later charged, is shown. Later, there is a videotape of Buono being led 
down a hall in handcuffs and film of a wrapped body being carried on a 
stretcher up a hillside. 
</P>
<P>
"The man who raped and murdered 10 women and terrorized Los Angeles," the 
narrator says. "And today, almost a decade later, in the midst of a political 
campaign John Van de Kamp, who still opposes the death penalty, and takes 
contributions from the Hillside Strangler lawyers, finally admits he made a 
mistake. Make sure you don't make one on Tuesday, June 5." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: The advertisement refers to Van de Kamp's actions when he served as 
district attorney of Los Angeles County. In 1981, a year before Van de Kamp was 
elected attorney general, his office handled the case of Angelo Buono. Buono's 
cousin, Kenneth Bianchi, pleaded guilty to five murders and implicated Buono. 
But, according to Van de Kamp and his fellow prosecutors, Bianchi then began 
changing his story. Van de Kamp said he was worried that if he tried Buono at 
that time, Buono might not be convicted and could never be retried because of 
the protections against double jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
According to Van de Kamp, he and his staff decided to prosecute Buono on the 
sex charges and drop the murder charges until more information could be turned 
up to bolster the case. But Superior Court Judge Ronald M. George refused to 
dismiss the counts and turned the case over to then-Atty. Gen. George 
Deukmejian, whose prosecutors secured convictions on nine of the 10 murder 
counts. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp has said throughout the campaign that he made a mistake in handling 
the case. He also asked that he be judged by his entire record -- during his 
tenure as district attorney, 42 criminals were sent to Death Row; since he has 
been attorney general, 277 have remained on Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
Although Van de Kamp personally opposes the death penalty, he has vowed to 
enforce it as governor. He has said he will not commute death sentences unless 
there is compelling evidence that the inmate is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
The ad describes Buono as having committed 10 murders; actually, he was 
convicted of nine. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney mentioned in the ad donated about $100 to Van de Kamp in 1990, 
nine years after Van de Kamp handled the case. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "John Van de Kamp is spending a million dollars of trial lawyers' money on 
negative advertising, but how much do you know about his record?" 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: The number refers to Van de Kamp's receipt of about $1 million in 
campaign donations from lawyers. While the Van de Kamp campaign acknowledges 
that lawyers have been generous to Van de Kamp, they point out that he has been 
a lawyer for 30 years and has innumerable acquaintances in the field. The Van 
de Kamp campaign also draws a distinction between the trial lawyers -- the 
politically vociferous group which has banded together on a number of state 
issues in recent years -- and their donors, who they said represent varied 
fields of law. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "Did you know he tried to drop murder charges against the Hillside 
Strangler? And he opposes the death penalty and called it barbaric?" 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: As recounted above, Van de Kamp said he agreed to temporarily dismiss 
murder charges against Angelo Buono because he feared that the case against him 
was weak. Van de Kamp said he wanted to move ahead with sex charges lodged 
against Buono while investigators sought more evidence on the murder counts. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp does oppose the death penalty personally -- as Feinstein once did 
-- but insists that he will enforce the law. He also said he will not join in 
any effort to overthrow the current death penalty law and considers the issue 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "Did you know that five times he defended Gov. Deukmejian's attempts to 
deny poor women Medi-Cal abortions? And twice defended Deukmejian's attempts to 
cut family planning funds?" 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Van de Kamp did defend the Deukmejian Administration's veto of 
abortion and family planning funds. But he said he did so because of his 
constitutional responsibility, as the state's legal representative, to defend 
it regardless of his personal beliefs. Van de Kamp, during the campaign and 
beforehand, has backed such funding. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp has refused on occasion to defend the governor, but said he did so 
only when he felt there was no appropriate legal defense.

BUILDER PLANS STADIUM COMPLEX NEAR FONTANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Fontana officials Thursday announced details of a developer's plan to build a 
$450-million stadium complex, including a 75,000-seat outdoor facility for 
football and baseball and a 26,000-seat indoor arena for basketball or other 
sports, on 250 acres of land northwest of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal for the development along Interstate 15 in western San Bernardino 
County comes from the firm of Kagan Management Services Inc. and would involve 
joint ownership by the city of Fontana, the Kagan firm and professional sports 
franchises that agreed to move to the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to a spokesman for the Kagan firm, no teams have been 
approached, and none will be until the city approves a memorandum of 
understanding with the firm on conditions for the project. The City Council 
will discuss the matter Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Fontana Mayor Nat Simon called the proposal "a risk-free deal for the city," 
adding: "We're not spending a dime of taxpayers' money, and we have a chance to 
bring professional sports to our city. It could put our city on the map." 
</P>
<P>
City Manager John O'Sullivan said the proposal avoids the problems faced by the 
San Gabriel Valley city of Irwindale, when it sought to acquire the Los Angeles 
Raiders football franchise with a $10-million advance cash payment, only to 
lose the money when it couldn't come up with financing for the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Until they bring us the teams, we don't do anything," O'Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
Fontana is only the latest of four Southland cities to propose building either 
indoor or outdoor arenas to attract pro teams. Irwindale, Santa Ana and Anaheim 
also have expressed interest in such biddings. 
</P>
<P>
With Los Angeles' negotiations to retain the Raiders not making much progress, 
one Coliseum commissioner, Richard Riordan, expressed concern Thursday that the 
Raiders might consider moving to Fontana. But he said that the team had told 
Coliseum officials it was as yet not involved.

SAN DIEGAN BUYS BAKKER'S TV NETWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bankruptcy judge Thursday approved the sale of the PTL cable television 
network to San Diego evangelist Morris Cerullo for $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Cerullo, a 58-year-old faith healer whose Worldwide Evangelism ministry outbid 
fellow evangelist Oral Roberts' $6.3-million offer for the network and 
production facility, also signed a contract to buy the other portion of Jim 
Bakker's scandal-plagued and bankrupt empire, the 2,200-acre Heritage USA 
religious theme park, for $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
PTL trustee Dennis W. Shedd said Cerullo plans to keep the network 
headquartered at the Heritage USA park near Ft. Mill, S.C., and to reopen the 
theme park, which closed in September. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Cerullo's Worldwide Evangelism said it planned to develop a 
"five-star seminar and conference center as well as a recreational vehicle 
resort and various housing projects" on the Heritage USA site. 
</P>
<P>
Cerullo was unavailable for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Worldwide Evangelism, which was founded by Cerullo in 1961, produces a daily TV 
program called "Victory with Morris Cerullo" that is carried by 40 stations 
throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
PTL has been under control of the bankruptcy court since June, 1987, two months 
after Jim Bakker resigned the ministry after a sex-and-hush-money scandal 
involving former church secretary Jessica Hahn.

LABORER SAYS HAVING BAG PUT OVER HEAD NO LAUGHING MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Contrary to testimony given by a Carlsbad baker the previous day, a 27-year-old 
migrant worker told a Vista court jury Thursday that being bound with duct tape 
and hooded with a paper bag behind a Carlsbad market was no laughing matter. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I was scared," Candido Gayosso Salas answered when asked by Dist. Atty. 
George McFetridge whether he laughed when Randy Ryberg bound his legs and arms 
with silver duct tape and placed a bag, bearing a funny face and the words "No 
Mas Aqui," crude Spanish meaning "No More Here," over his head. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Ryberg, who along with William Zimmerman is being tried in Vista 
Superior Court on a felony count of unlawful imprisonment in the Jan. 3 
incident, told the court that Gayosso had laughed when he saw the bag, on which 
had which been scrawled a face with a toothy grin. 
</P>
<P>
Gayosso's statements came during the third and final day of testimony in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
The jury will return Monday for final arguments before Judge Charles Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
Ryberg and Zimmerman, a self-contracted meat cutter, have been charged with 
handcuffing Gayosso to a stair railing for more than two hours after Ryberg 
grabbed the undocumented worker, who had been soliciting day labor with several 
dozen workers outside the store. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys allege that Ryberg was making a legitimate citizen's arrest. 
Zimmerman's lawyer claims that he was assisting in the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities, however, say that the two were using Gayosso to send a message to 
other workers that their daily presence was not appreciated outside the rural 
store, on El Camino Real, south of California 78. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Cases, a U. S. Border Patrol agent, also told the jury Thursday that he 
saw Gayosso handcuffed to the railing while on routine patrol behind the store. 
He asked the worker what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
But, before Gayosso could respond, a voice behind a screen door inside the 
store responded 'It's all been taken care of,' " Casas told the court. He did 
not identify the speaker. Gayosso said the agent then left without attempting 
to release him.

OFFICIALS PLOT STRATEGY TO BLUNT INVASION OF KILLER BEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The Africanized honeybee might not arrive in California until 1992 or later, 
but San Diego and Imperial county officials intend to make good use of the time 
to plan the fight against the aggressive bees when they do arrive. 
</P>
<P>
The Africanized Honeybee Task Force met Thursday for the first time to begin an 
18-month planning mission. The project is a joint effort of San Diego and 
Imperial County boards of supervisors, said Kathleen Thuner, San Diego County 
agricultural commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
The members which include government officials and representatives of schools, 
agriculture and health services, will produce an action plan similar to an 
earthquake preparedness plan, Thuner said. 
</P>
<P>
"We will produce an action plan for responding so that everyone knows what 
their role will be," she said. The plan will be a guide for health, fire, 
police and park officials, doctors and school teachers should they encounter a 
swarm of the bees or a bee-sting victim. 
</P>
<P>
Task force members will also prepare a plan for getting the word out to the 
general public about the bees. "We may ask county school districts to take a 
lead role," Thuner said. By educating children about the Africanized bees, the 
task force hopes to reach parents too. The Africanized bees are descendants of 
African bees brought into Brazil in 1956, according to the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. Researchers attempting to breed a more productive honeybee than 
the European honeybee accidentally released the more aggressive African bees 
into the Sao Paulo countryside. The African bees interbred with the more 
docile, European bees, producing a hybrid that defended its nests more 
vigorously and swarmed more often to expand to new locations. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the bees have spread to Mexico and may cross into San Diego County 
in 2 to 5 years directly from Mexico if the bees make their way up Mexico's 
Pacific Coast or through Imperial County if the bees move west from Texas, 
according to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the Africanized bee is not cause for panic, task force 
participants agreed. However, the public needs to develop a healthy respect for 
the bees and avoid bee swarms much as they would a rattlesnake, Thuner said. 
</P>
<P>
"The odor associated with a sting draws more stings," said Eric Mussen, an 
apiculturist from the University of California, Davis. People who have died 
from the bee stings have been those who "hung around" entranced by the sight of 
the swarm, he said. "What they should have done is leave the area as quickly as 
possible and get into a vehicle or a building." 
</P>
<P>
The effect of multiple stings is similar to a rattlesnake bite, said Dr. David 
Haynes, a Kaiser Hospital emergency room physician. The venom begins taking 
effect within 10 to 15 minutes and can cause breathing difficulties, shock, 
lowered blood presure, muscle damage and death if left untreated. 
</P>
<P>
In Mexico, a joint U.S. and Mexican program has worked to educate the public to 
report swarms and has slowed the northward spread of the bees, said Mary 
Yurkovich, spokeswoman for the cooperative program. 
</P>
<P>
The Africanized and European bees look the same, but once people understood the 
importance of reporting wild swarms to protect Mexico's honey export trade, 
people were very cooperative, Yurkovich said. The bees were controlled with 
bait traps and by knocking them down with sprays of soap and water.

MONUMENT STATUS FOR ENCINO SITE REQUESTED; 
</P>
<P>
'LOST VILLAGE': A SLOW-GROWTH ACTIVIST'S EFFORTS TO HAVE THE VENTURA BOULEVARD 
LOCATION NAMED AN ARCHEOLOGICAL LANDMARK ARE CRITICIZED AS TACTICS TO STALL 
DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>

<P>
In the continued hope that an ancient Indian village might thwart construction 
of additional modern office buildings on Ventura Boulevard, a slow-growth 
activist has applied to the city Cultural Heritage Commission seeking monument 
status for a major archeological find uncovered six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald A. Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino, contends that more of the 
"Lost Village of Encino" must lie beneath two nearby redevelopment sites near 
the intersection of Ventura and Balboa boulevards. Although the presence of 
more remains has yet to be confirmed, Silver has rallied American Indian 
leaders and archeologists to his campaign to delay construction until 
archeological surveys are conducted. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what Mr. Silver's motives are, but even if we suppose his 
interest is in stopping another construction project, in this case, I believe 
he's correct," Mark Raab, director of the Center for Public Archeology at Cal 
State Northridge, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"There's every indication a lot of archeology is in the ground for several 
blocks around," Raab continued. "And when construction is proposed in that 
area, it really would be a very good idea to do some archeological testing 
prior to undertaking any construction." 
</P>
<P>
The Lost Village request is scheduled for review by the Cultural Heritage 
Commission next Wednesday. If the commission accepts the nomination, it will 
have 60 days to visit the site and recommend to the City Council whether the 
Lost Village deserves monument status, said commission spokeswoman Nancy 
Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "Lost Village," uncovered in 1984 at a cost of $1.7 million, 
included more than 1 million artifacts and the bones of about a dozen Indians 
found beneath a construction site on the southeast corner of the intersection. 
Experts such as Raab and archeologist Nancy Whitney-Desautels of Huntington 
Beach, who excavated the site, believe it to be the remains of a large Indian 
village described in the journals of Spanish explorers who arrived in the San 
Fernando Valley in 1769. It was dubbed the Lost Village because modern 
archeologists searched for its remains for years without success. 
</P>
<P>
"An archeological site of that kind is probably found once a generation," Raab 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At least two other archeological sites in the city have been designated as 
historic-cultural monuments, said Fernandez, one in the Ferndale section of 
Griffith Park and another in Marina del Rey. The "monument" designation, which 
can apply to an area as well as a building, would enable the Cultural Heritage 
Commission to screen requests for building permits. 
</P>
<P>
On another front of the Lost Village battle, Silver and supporters are 
scheduled to testify Tuesday before the city's Building and Safety Commission. 
There, they will argue that archeological surveys be required before 
construction is permitted on the north side of Ventura Boulevard, across the 
street from the Lost Village dig, on which an office building has since been 
erected. 
</P>
<P>
Silver's group is appealing findings by the Building and Safety Department that 
neither of two office buildings proposed between Balboa Boulevard and La Maida 
Street need environmental impact reports or preliminary archeological surveys. 
</P>
<P>
A proposed 48,000-square-foot office building off La Maida Street will be 
addressed Tuesday. A hearing on the second project has yet to be scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
One of the developers affected by Silver's efforts, Gardena-based builder Jerry 
Katell, on Thursday called Silver's application to the Cultural Heritage 
Commission "just another ploy to stop any development projects that he can." 
</P>
<P>
But Katell, who is planning a three-story, 140,000-square-foot office building 
off Balboa Boulevard, said he has decided to hire archeologists on his own to 
conduct a preliminary archeological review, largely to prevent construction 
delays later. 
</P>
<P>
"We've already dug a number of exploratory holes on the property and found 
nothing," Katell said. "So we don't expect to find anything, and this would 
sort of settle it forever."

SUPERVISOR URGES REPLACEMENT FOR HIGH DESERT HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich plans to ask the Board of 
Supervisors on Tuesday to approve replacing county-owned High Desert Hospital 
with a new facility in the fast-growing Antelope Valley, the supervisor's staff 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't keep up with the growth of this community," said Walter Gray, 
administrator of the 171-bed hospital. "There really is a tremendous need." 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich's proposal that a 270-bed hospital be built in Lancaster on 40 acres 
of county-owned property is on the agenda for the board's Tuesday meeting. The 
facility would cost about $171 million and would be completed in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich will ask the board to allocate $1.4 million for a site survey and 
architectural plans for the initial phase of the proposed hospital. Some of the 
money needed to build the hospital could be obtained from the state, the 
supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
In the first phase, a birthing center would be built to handle the increased 
volume of deliveries in the area. High Desert, which originally was built as a 
tuberculosis hospital for jail inmates, is not large enough to have an 
obstetrics wing. Instead, the county contracts with Antelope Valley Medical 
Center in Lancaster to deliver county patients' babies. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the women who would deliver their babies at High Desert are poor. They 
now receive prenatal care at either the county health center in Lancaster or at 
High Desert. 
</P>
<P>
The Antelope Valley, like other areas of the county, is experiencing a boom in 
births, said Dr. Dorris Harris, chief of public health centers in the North 
County area. 
</P>
<P>
A pregnant woman who calls for her first appointment has to wait 25 working 
days to be examined initially at the county clinic, far longer than the 
county's two-week guideline, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich's motion said county health officials predict that the birthing 
center, which would also provide prenatal services, could open by 1995 and 
handle the anticipated volume of deliveries for at least 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The construction of surgical and medical facilities would complete the second 
phase of the hospital's construction, Gray said. A third phase would build 
housing for county nursing home patients and rehabilitation patients recovering 
from strokes or accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Gray said the hospital is operating at capacity, but is not overwhelmed yet. A 
new hospital is needed so it can avoid having more patients than beds as the 
community continues to grow, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The county is exploring potential uses for the High Desert facility if a new 
hospital is built. It might serve as a hospital for the county's Mira Loma 
jail, across the street from the hospital, said Tim Moore, an administrative 
assistant at the hospital. The state, which plans to build a prison nearby, 
might also wish to use it, he said.

CITY COUNCIL SPEEDS UP GROWTH-CONTROL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council on Thursday set in motion a complex scheme designed 
to rush a council-endorsed growth-control plan into effect shortly before Nov. 
7, when San Diegans will probably vote on a competing growth-control plan 
prepared by the San Diego 2000 committee. 
</P>
<P>
The city's still-evolving growth plan, already more than a year in the making, 
would limit new development until the city solves its huge deficiency in roads, 
parks, sewers, jails, police stations, libraries and other public services. 
</P>
<P>
The council Thursday ordered the city staff to speed development of a plan to 
manage traffic congestion and a capital-facilities master plan that would serve 
as the cornerstone of the growth-control plan. Drafts of those documents were 
recently submitted to the council by Robert Freilich, an attorney who advises 
the city on growth-related issues. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on a motion by Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt, the council ordered the 
city staff to develop those documents on a "fast track" so they can be 
incorporated into emergency ordinances on July 11. 
</P>
<P>
Freilich argued that the emergency ordinances are appropriate because, 
throughout California, residents are being assaulted by increased pollution and 
traffic generated by unrestrained growth. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency ordinances planned for July would be followed in September by 
still more ordinances and General Plan changes that would be needed to have 
most of the growth-control plan in place before the November election. 
</P>
<P>
The council opted for a fast-track approach so council members can, in effect, 
campaign for the city's proposal and against the San Diego 2000 initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"I want ours in place so we can go out and say (the city plan) is the best," 
Mayor Maureen O'Connor said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The council's action drew praise from Peter Navarro, founder of Prevent Los 
Angelization Now, a group supporting growth control as necessary to ensure that 
the public infrastructure exists for the city to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro and other slow-growth advocates Thursday described the San Diego 2000 
growth-control initiative as ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
But Construction Industry Federation spokesman Tom Sheffer on Thursday 
described the council's plan as "a formula for economic destruction . . . new 
developments would not be able to go forward." 
</P>
<P>
Although the council Thursday addressed key elements of its control plan, it 
once again failed to say how it would pay for infrastructure costs estimated at 
nearly $2 billion. Council members indicated that they would tackle the tough 
question of how to pay the city's share of those costs before July 11. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the city plan have argued that the city will never raise the money 
needed to pay for its share of needed improvements. Without the city's 
contribution, construction will grind to a halt, critics predict. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of rapid votes Thursday, council members took preliminary steps to 
place the competing growth-control plan developed by San Diego 2000 on the Nov. 
7 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego 2000 committee, which includes developers and civic leaders, 
earlier this month gathered enough signatures to place the initiative on the 
Nov. 7 ballot. However, the council also has the option of refusing to place 
the initiative on the ballot, which could spark a court battle. 
</P>
<P>
Council also voted against placing on the November ballot a growth-control 
initiative developed by PLAN. But Navarro predicted that the council will 
reverse course and place his group's initiative on the November ballot as an 
"insurance policy" that would help to defeat the San Diego 2000 initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's flurry of votes occurred shortly after Councilman Wes Pratt urged 
council members to "get off the dime on this. . . . we've been jockeying around 
playing dueling initiatives. . . . Let's either vote something up or vote 
something down." 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan adopted Thursday, the council would enact emergency ordinances 
to set in motion changes in the city's General Plan. In September, the council 
would augment those emergency measures with ordinances and General Plan changes 
to further flesh out the plan.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: A TASTE OF RIO JUST SOUTH OF THE BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Nelson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are moments when Tijuana seems immeasurably more sophisticated than San 
Diego, and moments when it seems drab and cheerless; the trick, of course, is 
to catch it at the right time, an event not easy to prognosticate. 
</P>
<P>
A good place at which to find Tijuana in its most European mood (the surprise 
is that any city in this area would have such a mood, but Tijuana can) is Plaza 
Fiesta, the instantly quaint Mexican village of small shops and restaurants 
that was built catty-corner to the Cultural Center several years ago as this 
city's answer to Seaport Village. 
</P>
<P>
Plaza Fiesta boomed when it opened and quickly became a gathering spot for the 
chic, the would-be chic, the young and, according to Tijuana sources, some 
segments of the underworld. A police crackdown cleared the winding byways about 
six months ago, and, on a recent Saturday, the place was relatively quiet. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, there seem to be more restaurants than before in the maze-like 
collection of two-story buildings. There are at least 20 eateries, including 
not only Mexican houses but Italian, Greek and even Yugoslav, and, since 
virtually all of them feature live music, a stroll through Plaza Fiesta can 
make visitors feel like spectators at a monumental battle of the bands. 
</P>
<P>
La Taberna Espanola, an authentic Spanish tapas bar run by Galicians, remains 
the most popular place by far, but right across the way is a tiny establishment 
called Oba Oba that flies a banner reading comida brasiliera. It takes about 
two seconds to translate this into "Brazilian food" and perhaps another two 
seconds to be seated at one of the seven tables in the minuscule but handsome 
dining room. 
</P>
<P>
If one has not already had a sherry and a tapa at La Taberna, the way to start 
a meal here is with a caipirinha, a feisty cooler of sugar cane liquor, lemon 
juice and sugar that strolling vendors concoct on the beaches in Rio de Janeiro 
and that reputedly puts languid sunbathers on Copacabana Beach in the mood for 
another dip in the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Oba Oba's menu is written in Brazilian and translated into Spanish, so that 
anyone familiar with Mexican menus should find it easy to read; examples would 
be feijao, which translates into frijoles and beans, and queijo, or queso and 
cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Starters divide into two competing categories, pasteis (empanadas) stuffed with 
cheese, shrimp or the hashed meat called picadinho (picadillo), and 
churrasquinhos, or skewers of marinated beef, chicken or pork cooked to a 
crusty finish on the grill. The latter are tasty but filling and are simply 
half-sized versions of the churrasco skewers offered as entrees. The empanadas, 
on the other hand, are alluring meat pies encased in flaky pastry; the shrimp 
version is a masterwork of subtlety whose suggestion of sweet-sour flavor 
vanishes if one thinks too much about it. 
</P>
<P>
One can also start with a typical hearts-of-palm salad (palmito) or one of a 
trio of traditional soups, including very Brazilian chicken-with-vegetables 
(canja de galinha) and beans with spaghetti (feijao con massa). It is as well 
to begin on the light side, though, since entree portions can be formidable. 
</P>
<P>
All the entrees are utterly typical and each plate seems engineered to be its 
own cornucopia; the only constant factors are the mounds of rice studded with 
peas and chopped carrots (it is excellent), the fried bananas and the little 
piles of farofa, a toasted flour that one sprinkles over anything and 
everything to add a slightly nutty taste and gritty texture. Farofa and 
Brazilian cooking are synonymous, and the stuff does have its moments, 
especially when added to the picadinho, the wonderfully savory and teasingly 
sweet hash of ground beef, tomatoes, onions and olives. 
</P>
<P>
Another typical offering is tutu a mineira, a sort of buffet-on-a-plate of 
spicy chorizo-like sausage (linguica); a lacy fried egg; farofa-coated fried 
bananas; rice; a mound of black beans cooked down to a paste (Brazilians know 
that there's more than one way to cook a bean); a peeled orange and a 
sensational pile of melting, chopped kale seasoned with enough cayenne to make 
a definite statement. The plate reads like a shopping list of favorite 
Brazilian foods and is a delight. 
</P>
<P>
The dessert list offers flan out of a sense of obligation, but also pastel de 
goiabada e queijo, a fried, cinnamon-dusted empanada that combines the quince 
paste-cream cheese combination popular in many Latin countries. 
</P>
<P>
Meals are priced reasonably, and three courses with wine, tax and tip should 
cost about $15 per person. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny room is magically enlarged by a mirrored wall; another wall is taken 
up by a collection of carnival masks and, rather amazingly, room has been made 
for an upright piano. This recently was manned by a tuxedoed pianist who 
effortlessly moved from classical nocturnes to mean sambas to such dandy things 
as "Blue Moon (You Left Me Standing Alone)." With the food thrown in, this all 
added to an unexpected taste of Rio just south of the border. 
</P>
<P>
Oba Oba is easily located. From the San Ysidro border crossing, follow the Zona 
Rio signs to Avenida Paseo de los Ninos Heroes and watch for the large Plaza 
Fiesta sign half-way around the first traffic circle.

FALLBROOK MAN INDICTED IN UTAH OVER TOXIC WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Fallbrook man and his defunct storage firm were indicted Thursday in Utah on 
federal charges of conspiring to illegally dispose of hazardous wastes, 
including surplus napalm bombs from the Fallbrook Naval Weapons Station. 
</P>
<P>
"This case represents perhaps the most serious type of environmental 
misconduct," U. S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
Named in the 12-count grand jury indictment in Salt Lake City were EKOTEK and 
Steven M. Self, the company's president and sole registered agent. The company 
was involuntarily dissolved by the state of California on Nov. 1 for alleged 
violations of environmental health laws. 
</P>
<P>
Self could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleges that the company knowingly burned, poured and stored a 
variety of hazardous wastes in violation of an array of state and federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
Company Vice President Steven F. Miller pleaded guilty Wednesday to three 
felony charges of conspiracy and violations of federal resource conservation 
and recovery laws and the Clean Water Act, Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, of San Francisco, was allowed to plead guilty in exchange for his 
cooperation in the prosecution of Self, officials said. Neither Self nor Miller 
was in custody Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on all charges, the defendants face fines of more than $24 
million, and Self could be sentenced to up to 45 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment, the first federal prosecution of environmental crime in Utah, 
alleges that the defendants purchased millions of gallons of oils and solvents 
and burned them as fuel in their refinery in northern Salt Lake City.

WHY ALL THE MONEY FOR INSURANCE POST?; 
</P>
<P>
* VOTERS NEED AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When California voters last went to the polls, two years ago, the hottest 
election issue was insurance reform. It should have been an issue this year, 
too. But it's been obscured by big spending, especially in the Democratic 
Party's primary campaign for insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the commissioner's job was filled by appointment. That changed 
when voters enacted Proposition 103, the only one of a handful of controversial 
insurance initiatives that passed in 1988. Proposition 103 was flawed -- one of 
the reasons that state courts are still trying to clarify how it's supposed to 
work. But it did create a government structure that will better regulate the 
insurance industry in California -- if it is overseen by a commissioner who 
doesn't play favorites among the powerful interest groups that made insurance 
reform such a political mess. 
</P>
<P>
One worry about the three best-funded candidates on the Democratic side is that 
they are campaigning with war chests that exceed $1 million each. In the past, 
state Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove) has taken lots of money from the 
insurance industry, which would prefer that regulation be kept to a minimum. TV 
personality Bill Press is paying for his commercials with money from trial 
lawyers, who are fighting any insurance reforms that limit the fees attorneys 
can charge. Conway Collis, a member of the state Board of Equalization, who 
claims to be using his own personal wealth to finance the campaign, undercut 
any appeal he had to reasonable people by launching shrill attacks against 
insurance companies and current Commissioner Roxani Gillespie, who is making an 
effort to make Proposition 103 work while she has time left in office. All 
three candidates will try to inundate voters the next few days with TV ads and 
campaign mailers that oversimplify this complex issue. 
</P>
<P>
So it would behoove voters to look beyond the attractive packaging of big-name 
candidates at other persons in the insurance commissioner's race who (a) have 
shown the courage not to take money from special interests and (b) to address 
insurance reform in its often boring complexity. Two candidates have done that 
more consistently than the major candidates. Democrat Walter Zelman, former 
state director for Common Cause, has very little money but is genuinely trying 
to address the issues -- not just the high cost of auto insurance but the 
rising cost of health coverage, which is likely to be the insurance crisis of 
the '90s. Republican Thomas Skornia, a San Jose attorney, also has a long 
record of unpublicized work on behalf of insurance reform and has not linked 
himself with any particular faction. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts predict that the Democratic primary winner will be favored in the 
insurance commissioner's race in November because Republicans are closely 
identified with the insurance industry. We're not so sure. California voters 
are so impatient waiting for Proposition 103 to work that they will listen to 
any candidate who has specific ideas about insurance reform, no matter what 
party he belongs to. That's why we're hoping the candidates who emerge from the 
primary have the necessary background knowledge and independence for what is 
going to be one of the most important jobs in the state.

DOWN AND OUT IN THE SOVIET UNION; 
</P>
<P>
WHY PROBLEMS BACK HOME THREATEN U.S. SECURITY, NOT ENHANCE IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The outcome of the current Bush-Gorbachev summit will be determined by the 
willingness of the two superpowers to deal in a constructive fashion with three 
considerations glimpsed only dimly when they last met in Malta. Now all three 
are clear: One is a fact; one is an aspiration, and the other is a realization. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is Soviet weakness. Today, Moscow's network of military alliances has 
collapsed; its only firm claim to superpower status is its nuclear arsenal. Its 
system of economic planning has failed utterly. Central authority itself is in 
jeopardy, as nationalism surges not only around the periphery but also through 
the Russian heartland. Political fragmentation is so intense that the two 
largest vote-getters in the Russian Republic's presidential election this week 
were a Gorbachev critic from the left -- the winner, populist Boris N. Yeltsin 
-- and an opponent from the right -- hard-liner Ivan K. Polozkov. Yet 
Gorbachev, as Thursday's Times Poll reported, remains popular. 
</P>
<P>
The aspiration is European stability. Here the United States must take Soviet 
weakness into account without exploiting it, particularly on the German 
question. Washington -- and the Germans -- want to see the new Germany part of 
NATO. Soviet public opinion, as The Times Poll found, overwhelmingly desires a 
neutral Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Yet such a solution virtually assures the European instability everyone fears. 
What must be found -- and this may take some doing -- is a structure that keeps 
Germany firmly in the stabile community of Western nations without frightening 
the Soviet people and humiliating and further weakening their leaders. It is 
not surprising that some are touting a sort of desperation candidate known as 
the 35-nation Conference of Security and Cooperation in Europe as a possible 
successor umbrella for Europe. The 15-year-old organization already includes 
the Soviet Union and the United States as members and so carries no 
debilitating Cold War baggage. Something, though not just anything, is needed. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, point three: The realization is that neither superpower can dictate 
solutions. The Soviets can influence, but not exercise, a veto over the shape 
of the new Europe. The United States can isolate itself or put aside domestic 
politics to join the stabilizing process of economic interchange with the 
Soviets wisely begun by the Europeans. A destitute, desperate Soviet Union is 
in no one's interest. Washington ought to sign the trade agreements it has 
concluded with Moscow as soon as possible.

CALIFORNIA AS A TREND-SETTER AND OPPOSITION TO PROP. 111 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peirce quotes a Times poll that Golden State voters greatest concern is that 
Proposition 111 gasoline tax funds would not be spent "wisely," yet he seems 
surprised that Californians are not enthralled by Proposition 111 provisions 
that would "provide commuters with alternatives such as rail transit and car- 
and van-pool programs," and "flexible congestion relief." 
</P>
<P>
Wake up, Neal. 
</P>
<P>
These are the very provisions of Proposition 111 that a majority of the voters 
don't like and won't vote for. They know that rail transit and car-pool 
programs have been giant failures in Atlanta, Miami, San Francisco, Washington, 
Houston, Seattle and Pittsburgh. So long as automobiles and fuel to operate 
them are affordable, and the population growth continues, California voters 
will demand more "roads, roads, roads."

<P>
There should be minimal surprise if we wake up next Wednesday to find the 
ballot initiative raising the gasoline tax to pay for improved roads and 
highways has been soundly trashed. 
</P>
<P>
Gas prices at the pump have been creeping inexorably, relentlessly higher for 
many weeks. The increase averages 25% and is climbing -- in spite of a 
well-documented worldwide glut of crude oil and falling wholesale prices. 
</P>
<P>
It's business as usual: the defenseless driver flogged senseless by oil company 
greed. Could a voter be blamed for refusing to add even more pain by 
masochistically approving a gas tax hike?

RAISA GORBACHEV

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is reported that about 15% of the Wellesley College student body have 
protested the invitation to Barbara Bush to speak at their commencement 
exercises. On the other hand, Raisa Gorbachev appears to be welcome without 
dissent by these young women. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush, wife of our President, has traveled all over the world, moves among 
people of great accomplishment and influence with ease, has lived in China and 
several of our various states, reared five children successfully, actively 
supported her husband's business and political careers, has a loving and 
enduring marriage, and is currently the official hostess for the White House. 
So what the hell could she possibly have to say to these hip kids? 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Gorbachev graduated from college in the Soviet Union, and has taught 
school there. She, too, has done some traveling, and appears to have an 
enduring marriage. However, by her own words, she is an avowed Marxist. A woman 
in her 50s, she supports communism, a demonstrably failed, bankrupt political 
philosophy sustained by terrorism. In other words, this is a woman who has been 
wrong all her life. So what the hell could she possibly have to say these hip 
kids? Recant, huh? I'm sure.

Your support of Prop. 117 seems to be based on the emotional premise of "stop

The real problem with Prop. 117 is that it takes wildlife management out of the

2 VANDALISM SUSPECTS ARE RELEASED; 
</P>
<P>
PALMDALE: INVESTIGATORS ARE HOPING TO GATHER MORE EVIDENCE THAT THE MEN PAINTED 
THREATS AND SWASTIKAS IN A WIDOW'S NEW HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two reputed members of a skinhead gang were released from jail Thursday while 
investigators attempted to gather more evidence that they broke into a Sylmar 
woman's new home in Palmdale and scrawled threats, swastikas and satanic 
symbols on the walls, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Todd Evans, 18, of Palmdale and Thomas Conroy, 19, a transient, were 
arrested Tuesday on suspicion of burglary and vandalism after deputies traced 
evidence, including footprints, to them, Sgt. Ron Shreves said. The suspects 
were released Thursday because detectives did not have enough evidence to 
charge them and are seeking more, Shreves said. 
</P>
<P>
The vandalism was discovered Tuesday in the home in the 5300 block of Blue Sage 
Drive by a contractor working in the development. Mary Termini, a 66-year-old 
widow, was in the process of moving into the home from Sylmar. When she arrived 
at the house, she found much of her property damaged and writing on several 
walls, she said. 
</P>
<P>
An obscenity was scrawled on a Catholic calendar, she said. There were satanic 
and Nazi symbols. One message read: "This house is possessed. Get out bitch." 
Termini said personal papers relating to her late husband's burial were strewn 
around the house and a "Welcome Home" food basket that had been a gift was torn 
open and dumped. 
</P>
<P>
Termini said a telephone and a pair of her prescription glasses were stolen by 
the vandals. A note on a wall said, "Thanks for the glasses." 
</P>
<P>
Termini said she has not decided whether she wants to move into the house now. 
Deputies estimated damages at $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It was horrifying," Termini said. "I am still in shock. They tore the place 
apart. I would have been in this weekend. Now I don't know if I ever will." 
</P>
<P>
After the break-in was reported, sheriff's gang experts determined the graffiti 
had apparently come from a local skinhead gang, Shreves said. Skinhead gangs 
are found in several cities throughout the United States and often espouse a 
neo-Nazi, white supremacist philosophy. Members of the groups often have shaved 
heads or short-cropped hair. 
</P>
<P>
Evans and Conroy, located at a local skinhead hangout known to investigators, 
were arrested when deputies found that their shoes closely matched footprints 
in Termini's home, Shreves said. 
</P>
<P>
Termini said she was upset that Evans and Conroy were released. 
</P>
<P>
"It bothers me," she said. "That's why I don't know if I will move in there or 
not. They'll know where I live."

ANIMALS IMPOUNDED AT SOUTHEAST S.D. HOUSE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Humane Society of San Diego on Thursday impounded three dogs, two cats, 
four kittens and a parakeet from a house in Southeast San Diego that police 
described as "a mess." 
</P>
<P>
The officers assisted in serving a search warrant on John Gaines, who lives 
with his mother, Ruby, in the 400 block of Encinitas Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities found piles of garbage and "dead and live rats in the house," 
Police Officer Daniel Hattler said. 
</P>
<P>
Humane Society spokeswoman Lani Kian said the agency issued a notice of 
violation May 23 to the Gaineses after receiving a report of a dog tangled in a 
leash in the front yard of the house. The dog was dead when agency workers 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The agency then obtained a search warrant after the Gaineses failed to improve 
the living conditions of their other animals, Kian said. 
</P>
<P>
Information obtained in the search will be turned over to the city attorney's 
office, and the Humane Society will recommend prosecution of the Gaineses on 
animal neglect charges, Kian said. Two misdemeanor counts, one for lack of 
general care and one for lack of veterinary care, could be filed for each 
impounded animal, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The conditions here are very poor in terms of sanitation," Kian said. The 
animals "are lacking in veterinary care and nutrition." 
</P>
<P>
A necropsy performed on the dog was inconclusive because the animal had partly 
decomposed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
John Gaines said he plans to fight the action. 
</P>
<P>
"All I know is I keep my animals fed and watered," he said. "We've been trying 
to get the (garbage) out, but the trash men won't take it all out at one time." 
</P>
<P>
A judge will decide whether the animals will be returned to the owners or 
remain in the custody of the Humane Society, Kian said.

Environmental effort and emphasis seems to be on acid rain, global warming,

Why not devote some of this effort to asking people not to discard beer and

The result would be visible evidence of a cleaner environment.

A Valley Center teen-ager died Thursday when her car hit a tree along a rural 
road. 
</P>
<P>
Marcia Ann Logue, 17, was driving west on Woods Valley Road near Lake Wohlford 
Road at 7:20 a.m. when her car left the road on a sharp curve and hit an oak, 
said California Highway Patrol Officer Jerry Bohrer. 
</P>
<P>
Logue, who lived near the accident site and traveled the road frequently, was 
apparently driving too fast to safely handle the curve, he said. She died at

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal grand jury Wednesday indicted five men on drug charges in connection 
with a May 24 "sting" in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
Agents of the U.S. Customs Service and Drug Enforcement Administration posed as 
Mexican drug suppliers and accepted $484,000 from the five in exchange for 750 
pounds of marijuana and 10 kilograms of cocaine, said Assistant U.S. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Lynne Millsaps. 
</P>
<P>
Charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and conspiracy 
to possess with intent to distribute were Robert Edmund Alspaugh, 41, of 
Carlsbad; Ronald Keith Petersen, 42, of Temecula; Salvador Valdez-Urias, 36, 
and Carlos Sigala-Romo, 31, both of Tijuana; and Robert Paul Hartley, 33, of 
Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Petersen, Valdez-Urias and Sigala-Romo also were charged with conspiracy to 
possess 10 kilograms of cocaine with intent to distribute and possession with 
intent to distribute. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were being held in County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
The sting, called "Operation Alliance," included three meetings between drug 
agents and the suspects over eight days, ending with the May 24 arrests at a 
San Marcos shopping center.

CONCERT FEATURES COMPOSITIONS BY KEITH CLARK

<P>
In his 10 years as founding music director of the Pacific Symphony, Keith Clark 
seldom took the opportunity to program his own music, though some people might 
have wanted him to. So one approached the final concert in the "Keith Clark 
&amp; Friends" chamber music series Wednesday at the Robert Mondavi Food and 
Wine Center with special interest. 
</P>
<P>
Two works by Clark, who left the Pacific in 1989, shared the bill with music by 
Haydn, Schubert and contemporary American composer Jane Brockman. 
</P>
<P>
Judgment about Clark's compositional talents will have to wait for more 
substantial opportunities, however. His "Lost Children (Four Little Kids' Songs 
After Blake)," composed in 1964, is a work by a serious, studious, capable 
19-year-old who had soaked up academic and worthier influences without 
responding to the great depths of the seminal Romantic poet's texts. But how 
many composers have? 
</P>
<P>
Clark's "L'Ocho Dodi," on the other hand, is an occasional piece, composed in 
1989 to celebrate the wedding of a friend. The short work (less than five 
minutes long) does exactly what it should: create an unabashedly lyric, 
attractive aura around the bridal couple. (Incidentally, this was the only 
piece on the program that Clark conducted.) 
</P>
<P>
Vocal soloist in both pieces was soprano Maurita Phillips Thornburg, who 
provided polished but also constricted vocalism not only here but also in 
Schubert's "Der Hirt auf dem Felsen." 
</P>
<P>
Clarinetist William Powell proved unsteady and erratic in Schubert's wondrous 
work (Trina Dye provided discreet pianism), but managed the banal colorscapes 
of Brockman's "Ningana" for clarinet, electronics and tape with more comfort 
and authority. 
</P>
<P>
The high point of the concert, however, was the stylish playing of cellist 
Dennis Karmazyn in Haydn's early Concerto in C. Karmazyn produced robust but 
also poised and aristocratic tone. He played his own cadenzas. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the five-member supporting ensemble did not sound thin, thanks to 
first violinist Barry Socher, who set lively, buoyant tempos, and 
harpsichordist Thomas McFarland, who filled out the harmonies. The others were 
violinist Juliann French, violist Ray Tanabe and cellist Geoff Shank.

'MURDER BY NATURAL CAUSES' HAS CLEVER PREMISE, BUT TV-LIKE SCRIPT

<TEXT>
<P>
The good news about the Huntington Beach Playhouse's production of Tim Kelly's 
"Murder by Natural Causes" is that it's a sleek show, elegantly mounted and 
staged with a sure hand by Geoffrey Gread. The bad news is that it's a TV 
script that plays like a TV script; all the action is in the final 20 minutes 
after the last commercial break. 
</P>
<P>
The premise is clever but all in the head: A rich and famous mentalist has a 
greedy, attractive and much younger wife who wants to do him in. The entire 
plot revolves around the question of whether the scheming wife can outwit her 
old man, an overworked fake who gets his psychic info from a private detective. 
It seems as if he is no match for her -- or is he? 
</P>
<P>
Act I is a plodding exposition that cries out for close-ups and visits to the 
refrigerator. If there were any real sexual energy between the schemers -- 
Nancy Kernick as the wife and Gary Kernick as her lover -- the whole thing 
would move more breathlessly. Instead, we get to see Gary Kernick suddenly 
stripped to his black bikini undershorts, an event so shocking and out-of-place 
that it garnered the most vocal audience reaction of the night, a loud "Well, 
well, well!" 
</P>
<P>
The first two-thirds of the play relies heavily upon the charm of the leading 
lady, but Nancy Kernick has left charm completely out of her performance. She 
plays the would-be murderess and seductress extraordinaire with a flat grin and 
a swagger. 
</P>
<P>
The last third picks up partly because of the plot twists piling together, and 
partly because of Joshua Kaye's portrayal of the mentalist. He hands in a 
comparatively rich performance as a man with plenty of cards still up his 
sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
The supporting players are uniformly good and very well cast. Gread is a 
director who shows promise. But "Murder by Natural Causes" is a script only for 
viewers who are too tired to turn off the boob-tube and read a real murder 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>

GIFTED CHEF ADROIT AT EACH ITALIAN STYLE

<P>
Has success spoiled Massimo Navaretta? Not on your life. 
</P>
<P>
When we last saw him, Navaretta was sporting a T-shirt, singing along with his 
Celentano tapes and cooking pasta in a little neighborhood trattoria on Newport 
Boulevard called Scampi. Then the restaurant took off, and so did Navaretta, 
selling out to brother Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief hiatus, Navaretta is back, working his magic anew. You'll find 
him at his serious new restaurant, Amici, turning out creations such as potato 
souffle ai porcini and lasagne al pesto. However, he's traded in his T-shirt 
for a starchy white uniform and his Celentano for opera. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that tapes of Italian pop singers don't suit this handsome trattoria, 
located on a hard-to-find corner a block from the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center. It's just that, well, opera suits it better. It's a casual restaurant, 
to be sure, where you can sit and while away the evening undisturbed; but, it's 
a serious one, too, where you can get a first-rate dinner and a fine bottle of 
wine. In that respect, it is unique to the area around the Center. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant itself is small and intimate, all Art Deco lines and 
salmon-colored walls that make it look like a private dining room on a '30s 
cruise ship. Navaretta doesn't sing Puccini, but he does make a faint attempt 
at imitating Picasso. The walls are plastered with mock Cubist collages he put 
together all by himself: musical motifs made from guitars, mandolins and 
flutes. 
</P>
<P>
Of course his real artistry comes from the kitchen, where he turns out some of 
the area's most surprising contemporary Italian dishes. He is a native of a 
small coastal town in Napoli called Caserta, and the soul of his cooking is 
southern Italian. But the restaurant's large menu shows an adroitness at nearly 
every style Italy has to offer, as well as considerable originality and whimsy. 
Expect a real tour de force. 
</P>
<P>
Begin with one of the off-menu special antipasti. I've done it and really heard 
singing. One evening the chef prepared a light fritto of zucchini flowers in a 
fragrant tomato coulis. I thought his combination of Italian technique and 
California style was brilliant; oddly enough, the taste reminded me of a dish I 
once ate at a Japanese tea ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Another evening I had that magic potato souffle filled with fresh sauteed 
porcini. The souffle, fluffy and golden brown, had been hollowed out to make 
room for the mushrooms, which Navaretta has flown in frozen from Italy. They 
are much better than the dried ones normally seen at Italian markets, 
incidentally. 
</P>
<P>
Scampi, a carry-over from the other restaurant and one of the house 
specialties, are another item that he has flown in. Rush right over if you 
haven't tasted them; these are not prawns but another beast altogether, like 
small lobsters with a richer, more buttery flavor. The scampi available now are 
from Iceland, but later on in the season they will be straight from the 
Sardinian coast. I have tasted both and can't tell the difference. Besides, 
with all the olive oil and garlic used in the broiling, you won't care. You eat 
them out of the shells, and they are just fabulous. 
</P>
<P>
A large number of interesting pastas should strike your fancy at some point. 
Here you need to exercise judgment. Pasta e fagioli, the pasta and bean soup 
traditionally claimed by Rome, gets the cavalier treatment only a true southern 
Italian could minister it. There must be about 10 cloves of garlic in every 
bowlful. 
</P>
<P>
 Risotto ai quattro formaggi, a rice casserole with four cheeses, has a 
wonderful taste, but I question the texture. For some reason, Navaretta uses 
long-grain rice instead of Italian short-grain (Arborio) rice, a gesture that 
some would consider sacrilegious. I wouldn't go that far, because I loved the 
subtle tastes of Gorgonzola and fontina in his dish, but I did miss the grainy, 
individual quality of the Italian rice. When it comes to risotto, I agree with 
that Italian who said: "When you can count the number of grains in your mouth, 
the risotto is great." 
</P>
<P>
 Lasagne al pesto is excellent, anyway, a rich green pesto mingled into a 
ricotta filling between thick, perfectly cooked noodle sheets. There is a fine 
dish of penne with a vodka cream sauce, short tubes prepared Milan-modern with 
a definite kick to it. I've saved the best for last: ravioli with ricotta 
cheese. Chewy and soft, Navaretta's hand-rolled variety puts the others to 
shame. Here they are topped with a Neapolitan tomato sauce, natch. 
</P>
<P>
With such pasta treats on the menu, I always consider main dishes an 
afterthought at good Italian restaurants. If you have enough gusto, however, 
there are several not to be missed. Rotolo al Barolo is my favorite, a 
sausage-stuffed chicken breast in a wonderful red wine sauce. The veal chop is 
good, too, accompanied by a plate of sauteed spinach heavy with roasted garlic. 
Unfortunately, it was also accompanied by the one sub-par thing I tasted in 
this restaurant, a gummy saffron risotto. 
</P>
<P>
Fish lovers should be happy with plates such as clams or mussels in garlic-rich 
broth, broiled swordfish or bass brushed with olive oil and various stews of 
whitefish, scampi and calamari. 
</P>
<P>
Naples is famous for seafood, and Navaretta has the touch. Just don't let the 
waiters talk you into having them with pastas. They stand on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Navaretta also makes his own desserts. The ever-present tiramisu is the big 
ticket, soaked in rum on the bottom and properly unctuous in the middle. An 
oversized crema al caramello is fine and firm, and then, my choice, pear 
poached in red Barolo wine on a moat of custard cream. That is the lightest of 
the three, and if you order it you'll be humming Puccini all the way home. 
</P>
<P>
Amici is moderately expensive. Antipasti are $5.95 to $8.95. Soup and pasta are 
$3.95 to $8.95. Main dishes are $9.95 to $16.95. The back of the menu has a 
large selection of Italian wines. Special occasion Italian wines such as 
Ornellaia, Sassicaia and Brunello Biondi-Santi are available from an exclusive 
list by request only.

George Meese, brother of former U.S. Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese, failed to win 
confirmation to another four-year term on the state Unemployment Insurance 
Appeals Board, but the state Senate Rules Committee said it would again take up 
his reappointment at an unspecified date. Meese's continued service in his 
$86,000-a-year post was opposed by the California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, 
which complained that the number of board decisions favoring unemployed 
laborers has dropped dramatically since Gov. George Deukmejian appointed Meese 
in 1985.

Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp laid out a schedule of auto insurance rate 
rollbacks he said should be implemented under Proposition 103 and assailed 
Republican Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie for failing to order such 
rollbacks. By his calculations, he said, two-car families with good driving 
records should get back an average of $472 in Los Angeles, $304 in San 
Bernardino and Riverside, $269 in San Diego, $338 in San Francisco, $268 in 
Sacramento.

PANEL DECIDES TO MOVE IRVING BRANCH LIBRARY; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURE: DESPITE PROTEST, FACILITY WILL BE MOVED FROM HISTORIC LOCATION TO A 
SITE OCCUPIED BY A CARWASH. COMMISSIONERS CALL ACTION 'EMOTIONAL AND 
HEARTWRENCHING.' 
</P>

<P>
The Los Angeles Public Library Commission, in an action that members described 
as "emotional and heartwrenching," has decided to move the Washington Irving 
branch from its historic mid-city home of 64 years to a new location now 
occupied by a carwash. 
</P>
<P>
After a 4 1/2-hour meeting, the commission voted 4-1 in favor of the move, 
overriding calls by a majority of 62 speakers to save the old branch by 
renovating and expanding the 3,918-square-foot stucco-and-brick building named 
for the 19th-Century author of "Rip van Winkle." 
</P>
<P>
Many in the crowd of about 120 book lovers at Holman United Methodist Church 
said they could not make sense of the decision to abandon the library on 
Arlington Avenue -- declared a city historic monument in 1976 -- in favor of a 
new $3.3-million, 9,000-square-foot structure. The cost of the move to the new 
site 13 blocks west on Washington Boulevard was put at $2.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need bigger modern buildings," said Dr. Margo Griswell, a mid-city 
resident who opposes a new library. 
</P>
<P>
But the five-member commission, faced with the prospect that the Irving branch 
would have to be closed by June, 1991, because it does not meet earthquake 
safety standards, decided to order the staff to begin negotiations to purchase 
a plot of land on Washington Boulevard. The site is now home to Freddy Dee's 
Carwash. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm old and I appreciate old things," commission President Martha D. 
Katsufrankis said in explaining her vote for the new library. " . . . But we 
have to think about serving the whole community for the future." 
</P>
<P>
To mollify those who wanted to preserve the old building, the commission took 
its action after area City Councilman Nate Holden guaranteed that another 
"viable funded" use, such as a community center, would be found. 
</P>
<P>
There have been repeated assurances that the Irving building would be preserved 
by the city regardless of the commission's decision. But those promises did 
little to calm the fears of some preservationists that no city agencies would 
be interested in using the building. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that for one second," said one area resident. "What are they 
going to turn it into -- a police station? A fire station? It's a library, damn 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The debate over the fate of the Irving branch has dogged the commission for the 
last several months, resulting in several marathon meetings. A mediation panel 
offered by the Los Angeles County Bar Assn. held 18 hours of discussions with 
various factions within the mid-city area to reach a compromise. But those 
efforts were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
The passions evoked by the debate were readily evident Wednesday night. Speaker 
after speaker marched to a single microphone during a two-hour public hearing 
to argue the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a new library," area resident Bernie Gill said. "Everyone should look 
to the future." 
</P>
<P>
"A new library on Washington Boulevard would be a good start to upgrade the 
area," added Neil Berry, a former president of the Mid-City Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Suzette Clark, a 20-year-old college student who is a lifelong area resident, 
countered: "I go to Boston College, and the library there was built in 1863. 
They just built a new library there. But no one wants to study in (there)."

TERROR IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD; 
</P>
<P>
SLAYING: RESIDENTS OF ARBUTUS STREET IN HUNTINGTON PARK HAD CONSIDERED 
THEMSELVES SOMEHOW IMMUNE TO A SURGE IN MURDERS IN THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY. 
BUT NO LONGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Teresa Soria was taking out the trash Wednesday morning when a little boy 
wearing blue pajamas ran across the street with tears in his eyes begging for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother is laying on the floor," the boy said, trembling. "There is blood 
all over." 
</P>
<P>
Soria sent him to another neighbor who, after peering into the living room of 
the home in the 6700 block of Arbutus Street in Huntington Park, gathered up 
the 8-year-old boy, and his younger brother and sister, and called police. 
Officers arrived to discover the brutal murder of Bertha Gomez, 31, who was 
shot while her children slept. 
</P>
<P>
The crime has brought terror to the tidy neighborhood of Spanish-style homes, 
whose residents had considered themselves somehow immune to a surge in murders 
in the surrounding community. 
</P>
<P>
In a town that has but four homicide detectives, it has also stretched the 
resources of a 60-member police force already overwhelmed with an alarming 
number of mostly gang- and drug-related violent crimes -- including 27 drive-by 
shootings since January. 
</P>
<P>
The number of serious crimes, including murder, rape and auto theft, has risen 
from 3,406 incidents in 1985 to 4,968 in 1989 -- an increase of 31.5%, police 
spokesman Tom Weselis said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had nine homicides in five months, compared with 12 all last year," he 
said. "Our guys are busier than hell, running nonstop from crime to crime to 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, patrol officers have been working 65-hour weeks in an effort to keep 
up with an increase in calls for assistance in the three-square-mile city of 
70,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
"My phones are ringing all the time from people wanting to organize 
Neighborhood Watch programs, because they don't want to be the next victim," 
Weselis said. 
</P>
<P>
Police and city officials blame the problem on the fact that the Police 
Department has not expanded along with the population over the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to beef up the force, the city plans to use more than a million 
dollars in cash seized in local drug busts to hire five new officers. "Five is 
not enough, but it will help," Weselis said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest murder followed a double homicide on Feb. 27, in which two robbers 
broke into a Huntington Park condominium and terrorized six members of a family 
for hours before killing a pregnant woman and her 8-month-old fetus. Two 
suspects were arrested in late March after two investigators put in a total of 
260 hours tracking leads and evaluating evidence, including fingerprints lifted 
at the crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
In the Gomez case, investigators also "have lots of leads" and believe that the 
woman may have been killed by members of an "auto insurance fraud ring" that 
she knew, Detective Steve Hess said. He declined to elaborate on the possible 
motivation for the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
"We have three suspects in mind, none of whom wore gloves when they ransacked 
the house," Hess said. "We also have the bullet in the victim's brain, which we 
can compare with a murder weapon." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Gomez's 8-year-old son "was very strong, very alert and able to 
give us a strong, accurate and consistent account of what happened," the 
detective said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy told investigators that three masked men entered the house about 8 p.m. 
Tuesday. One of them carried a handgun and another had a knife. One of the men, 
in Spanish, ordered the children to go to bed. The boy and the two other 
children, ages 2 and 5, did as they were told, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest child awoke Wednesday morning about 8 a.m. and found his mother's 
body. About 15 minutes later, he told neighbors that "we've been robbed and my 
mother has blood in her mouth." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the evidence in the case, many residents have been unable to sleep 
since word spread along tree-lined Arbutus Street that the shy, introverted 
woman was found bound and gagged on the floor of her bedroom with a gunshot 
wound in her head. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand why it happened here," neighbor Jaime Maya, 23, said 
Thursday. "Everybody around here grew up together. We wave to each other on the 
street. It's been peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I'd buy a gun," Maya added. "But this has opened my eyes." 
</P>
<P>
A few doors down, Marina Acosta, a 40-year-old mother of two teen-agers, said 
she has been sleeping on the living room couch because she is afraid to stay in 
her bedroom at night. 
</P>
<P>
"When someone knocks on the door I'm afraid to open it," Acosta said, studying 
the occupants of every vehicle that passed the home she has lived in for 17 
years. "I'm thinking about moving to another block." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to live here anymore either, but where can you run?" wondered 
another neighbor, who asked that her named not be used. "We're going to have to 
grin and bear it."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROCKEFELLER URGES MORE SERVICES FOR 
CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Commission on Children will deliver a report to President Bush and 
Congress next year recommending an expansion of services to address the needs 
of unwanted children, the panel's chairman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have to get our act together on kids," Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, 
(D-W.Va.), said at a news conference during the commission's one-day tour of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't do something for them now, tomorrow is going to be a dismal day in 
this country." 
</P>
<P>
According to a fact sheet distributed by the commission, there were 2.4 million 
reports of abused and neglected children nationwide in 1989. The more than 100% 
increase over the last decade has taxed the government's ability to care for 
unwanted children, officials said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOY WHO FATALLY SHOT PLAYMATE IS ACQUITTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 13-year-old Pearblossom boy, who shot and killed a 10-year-old playmate last 
October, was found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter Thursday by a 
Juvenile Court judge who said prosecutors failed to prove their case. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors initially charged the boy, who was 12 at the time of the shooting, 
with first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
They reduced the charge to manslaughter on the first day of the trial two weeks 
ago because they did not believe the boy intended to kill Thomas Hernandez, 
whom he had met two days before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar Juvenile Court Judge Morton Rochman said Deputy Dist. Atty. Chesley 
McKay, who prosecuted the boy, failed to prove that the youth exhibited gross 
negligence when he fired his father's loaded antique shotgun last Oct. 22, 
hitting Hernandez in the head. A finding of gross negligence -- meaning that 
the boy could have known the possible consequences of his actions -- was 
required to prove the boy guilty of involuntary manslaughter.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECTS RELEASED IN HATE-CRIME BURGLARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two reputed members of a skinhead gang were released from jail Thursday while 
investigators attempted to gather more evidence that they broke into a Palmdale 
woman's new home and scrawled threats, swastikas and satanic symbols on the 
walls, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Todd Evans, 18, of Palmdale, and Thomas Conroy, 19, a transient, were 
arrested Tuesday on suspicion of burglary and vandalism after deputies said 
their footprints resembled those found at the crime scene, Sgt. Ron Shreves 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The men were released because detectives did not have enough evidence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The vandalism was discovered Tuesday by a contractor working in the development 
that Mary Termini, 66, was moving into. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's gang experts have determined the graffiti apparently came from a 
local skinhead gang, Shreves said. Investigators theorized that the house of 
Termini, who is white, was randomly selected by the vandals.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AMTRAK ADDS 2 DAILY ROUTES SERVING BURBANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After two years of rumbling through on their way between Santa Barbara and San 
Diego, Amtrak trains will provide Burbank with twice-daily service beginning 
today. 
</P>
<P>
A southbound train to San Diego via Los Angeles is scheduled to stop each day 
at the former CalTrain platform on Empire Avenue near Burbank Airport at 9:48 
a.m. A northbound train to Santa Barbara will stop there at 8:18 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The stops are the result of a three-year campaign by Burbank officials to 
attract Amtrak to the city, which has been without rail service since the 
short-lived CalTrain commuter line stopped running in 1983. A platform built 
for CalTrain on the Southern Pacific tracks along Empire Avenue has remained 
unused since the service, a joint operation between Southern Pacific and the 
state Department of Transportation, was halted because of low ridership.

LONGEST-RUNNING CASE ENDS IN 49-YEAR SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The oldest active criminal case in Los Angeles County ended Thursday when 
former gang leader Virgil Byars was sentenced to 49 years to life in state 
prison for two fatal drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Byars, 27, turned himself in nearly eight years ago and has been behind bars 
ever since. Thursday's sentence, imposed by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge 
Jacqueline Connor, covers two second-degree murder convictions and guilty 
verdicts for three assaults with a deadly weapon and the attempted murder of a 
jail inmate. 
</P>
<P>
"We got the max," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Loren Naiman. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Carl Jones called the sentence unduly harsh. 
</P>
<P>
"We won the case at trial," he said, referring to the jury's findings of guilt 
on lesser charges than originally sought by prosecutors. "The D.A. is having a 
tantrum trying to punish the guy through a harsh sentence." 
</P>
<P>
Byars, whose crimes were among the earliest of the now-epidemic drive-by gang 
shootings, had rejected a plea-bargain offer from prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
He languished in jail for eight years as his case wound its way through the 
system, delayed by his dissatisfaction with his court-appointed lawyers and by 
his battle to keep tapes of his confession from being admitted as evidence 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
Byars fired five of six lawyers who represented him and threatened several of 
them, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
When he finally went on trial last year, jurors deadlocked and a mistrial was 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
Byars, who said he had no memory of the crimes he was accused of because he was 
high on the hallucinogen PCP, was retried and found guilty of the murders last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Byars shot into a car and killed a rival gang member, Cornelius Harris, in 1982 
in Southwest Los Angeles, wounding another passenger. Minutes later he fired 
into a second car, killing 17-year-old Jody Hayes and wounding two other rival 
gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, standing in for Byars' ailing attorney, Joel Isaacson, said an appeal is 
planned.

CHILD SAYS BUCKEY RAPED HER AT PRE-SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In testimony that was graphic but often sketchy and inconsistent with previous 
statements, the third and final child witness in the McMartin Pre-School trial 
said Thursday that Ray Buckey raped her and then threatened to harm her parents 
if she told. 
</P>
<P>
The girl, now 13, said she feared Buckey after he cut off a rabbit's ears with 
scissors to underscore his threat. 
</P>
<P>
Describing a sexual attack while she and Buckey were both naked and playing a 
game called "horsey" a decade ago, the girl said, "Ray was on the floor. I got 
on top of him and he touched me." 
</P>
<P>
But she repeatedly answered, "I don't remember" when pressed for details on 
cross-examination, prompting defense attorney Danny Davis to ask sardonically: 
</P>
<P>
"Gee, I bet it hurt . . . ?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," the girl answered quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll bet you cried and screamed?" the exchange continued. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"And no one came to help you?" 
</P>
<P>
"No," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl, who was 3 when she began attending the Manhattan Beach nursery school 
owned by Buckey's family, is being used by the prosecution to support three of 
the eight counts of molestation -- alleging vaginal and anal penetration with 
the penis and fingers -- remaining against the 32-year-old former teacher. 
</P>
<P>
A jury acquitted Buckey of 40 counts in January and the district attorney is 
retrying him on eight of the 13 counts that were unresolved. He has maintained 
his innocence since his arrest seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Two other girls have given similar accounts of being molested during games at 
the preschool. 
</P>
<P>
Davis pressed Thursday's witness for such information as: Was Buckey wearing a 
short- or long-sleeved shirt before he stripped? Exactly what positions did 
they assume? And how is it that she formerly accused other McMartin teachers of 
molestation but now says only "Mr. Ray" assaulted her? 
</P>
<P>
The child's answers did not always coincide with those she gave to an 
interviewer six years ago at a Los Angeles child abuse diagnostic center, nor 
those she gave at Buckey's preliminary hearing or first trial. She insisted, 
however, that her memory had not been influenced by the therapist who conducted 
the videotaped interview -- which jurors have already seen -- nor by 
conversations with family members. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether statements by the therapist had made her believe that Buckey was 
a bad person, the child glared at the defendant, then looked back to Davis: 
</P>
<P>
"I already knew he was a bad person," she snapped.

Sanford Kahn admits that 11-term Rep. Glenn M. Anderson would be a hard man to 
beat. But he says that doesn't mean other candidates have to knuckle under. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if he talks to the Lord every day," Kahn said. "No one should be 
in Congress 22 years. . . . I am against the professional politician." 
</P>
<P>
Kahn is one of four gritty Republicans competing for the right to run against 
U.S. Reps. Anderson (D-San Pedro) in the 32nd District and Mel Levine (D-Santa 
Monica) in the 27th District -- two of the most entrenched of the South Bay's 
congressional incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's primaries, Kahn, a gas company salesman from Long Beach, and Jerry 
Bakke, an insurance agent and former labor leader from Wilmington, will square 
off to decide who takes on Anderson. Competing to challenge Levine will be West 
Los Angeles attorney David Barrett Cohen and Playa del Rey computer salesman 
Hans Yeager. 
</P>
<P>
Though all four men say they could play the role of giant-killer in the Nov. 6 
general election, the odds are that the best they can hope for is serving as a 
sacrificial lamb. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent congressmen running for reelection these days lose less than 5% of 
the time. Neither Anderson nor Levine faces primary opposition, and both are 
running in solidly Democratic districts. 
</P>
<P>
But the Republican candidates are making arguments aimed at turning this 
predicament to their advantage. "We have got to loosen the stranglehold 
incumbents have on office," Cohen said. "It is threatening the democratic 
system." 
</P>
<P>
The two GOP contests are not the South Bay's only congressional primaries 
Tuesday. Of the five congressional districts covering the area, only the one 
represented by Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) is free from primary 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Three Democrats are competing to take on U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) 
-- computer industry publisher James Cavuoto of Torrance, political science 
instructor Guy C. Kimbrough of Huntington Beach and retired teacher Bryan W. 
Stevens of Rolling Hills Estates. 
</P>
<P>
Two other Democrats, have a primary date with U.S. Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally 
(D-Compton) -- former Compton College Trustee Carl E. Robinson Sr. of Carson 
and Inglewood attorney Lawrence A. Grigsby. 
</P>
<P>
Like all these Democratic challengers, the Republicans vying for Anderson's and 
Levine's seats are little-known, sparsely financed candidates hoping to 
overcome the power of incumbency. In the cases of Anderson and Levine, that 
power is immense. 
</P>
<P>
Levine, rumored to be interested in running for the U.S. Senate, has 
established himself as a prolific fund-raiser during his four terms in 
Congress. His nearly $1.5 million in campaign cash on hand at the end of 1989 
ranked as the largest pot of any House member. Only three congressmen managed 
to top the $1-million mark. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, chairman of the powerful Public Works and Transportation Committee, 
holds extensive political IOUs after years of steering major federal projects 
to his district. 
</P>
<P>
In their contest to face Anderson in the 32nd Congressional District, Kahn and 
Bakke are campaigning in terrain that includes San Pedro, Lomita, Lakewood, 
Hawaiian Gardens and parts of Long Beach, Bellflower and Downey. 
</P>
<P>
Kahn, 46, was the Republican standard-bearer in 1988, but he lost to Anderson 
by more than a 2-1 margin. This year he is facing tough competition from Bakke, 
49, a former truckers union organizer who owns a Wilmington insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
Bakke says his main reason for running is his concern that not enough 
containers shipped to the Los Angeles/Long Beach Harbor are examined for drugs 
and excessive weight before being loaded on trucks. He charges that Anderson is 
overly concerned with financing large construction projects in the district and 
not enough with local problems such as drugs and crime. 
</P>
<P>
"He basically doesn't represent anybody here except developers," Bakke said. 
"There's drugs, there's gangs, there's crime going on all over the cities, but 
he's totally removed himself." 
</P>
<P>
Kahn says his top priorities are to push legislation limiting the number of 
terms congressmen can serve to five and to support changes in the tax system -- 
such as a cut in the capital gains tax -- to promote saving and investment. 
</P>
<P>
Kahn, who reports raising $2,000 so far, admits he is being outspent by Bakke, 
who says he has collected $7,000. Such sums represent a fraction of the cost of 
an effective districtwide campaign, but both men say they could give Anderson a 
fight in the general election by questioning the support he receives from 
political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a citizen politician," Kahn said. "I'll ask, 'Who is (Anderson) going to 
be answering to?' " 
</P>
<P>
Cohen and Yeager are waging an equally under-financed fight in Levine's 27th 
Congressional District, which embraces Terminal Island, part of Torrance, 
Lawndale, Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach, Manhattan Beach, El Segundo, part of 
Inglewood, and continues north into the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who is part Jewish and part Samoan, says he is trying to assemble a 
"rainbow on the right," a movement aimed at getting a range of ethnic groups in 
the 27th District interested in Republican positions. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old candidate says he favors tackling poverty by creating more 
low-tax enterprise zones for private industry in low-income areas, rather than 
relying on government welfare programs. On the Mideast, he says he would 
support the creation of a Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a very strong supporter of Israel, but I think we will never achieve 
peace unless we're able to accommodate the legitimate concerns of the 
Palestinian people." 
</P>
<P>
Yeager, 27, says his top priority as congressman would be to cut the federal 
budget deficit as part of a strategy to reduce the upward pressure on interest 
rates and promote economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
He declares himself against tax increases but says he would support boosting 
select levies such as alcohol and cigarette surcharges in return for government 
spending cuts as part of a compromise on deficit reduction. 
</P>
<P>
Yeager faults Cohen for holding to an anti-tax position without specifying 
exactly how he would address the issue of deficit reduction and economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
"Everywhere we . . . speak he talks about all the different races he's bringing 
together," Yeager said. But on economic issues, "I haven't really heard what he 
is trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
Of the two candidates, Cohen is the better financed. He says he has raised 
$14,000, while Yeager reports collecting only $3,000. Despite the scarce funds, 
Cohen and Yeager, like Bakke and Kahn in the 32nd District, say they could use 
incumbency as an effective issue in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen proposes a limit on campaign spending, a ban on contributions from 
political action committees and a six-term limit for House members. He also 
criticizes congressional mailing privileges. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the unfair advantages of incumbency we're going to have to do 
away with if we're going to have true democracy," Cohen said.

LOCAL ELECTIONS: BALLOT MEASURES; 
</P>
<P>
FOES OF TAX INITIATIVE FOR MORE POLICE SEEK TO HAVE IT INVALIDATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opponents of a Hawthorne ballot measure that would raise property taxes to pay 
for more police officers said Thursday they will try to have the proposal 
invalidated in court because sample ballots sent to voters last week lacked a 
complete text of the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne Assn. of Taxpayers President Martha Bails, who spoke against 
Proposition D at a City Council meeting Tuesday, promised to file a lawsuit 
against the city in Superior Court regardless of whether the measure passes in 
the election Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The (state) Election Code says you have to provide text or an impartial 
analysis (of a ballot measure) by the city attorney," Bails said. "Hawthorne 
failed to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne City Atty. Michael Adamson said, however, that recent case law 
indicates that cities aren't required to place either an impartial analysis or 
the complete text of an ordinance on the sample ballot. Although the City 
Council never directed him to prepare an analysis of the measure, he added, 
copies of the proposal were available to the public on request. 
</P>
<P>
"If this (measure) was really fatally defective, as Bails (and others) 
indicate, they would have taken it to court already," Adamson said. "Instead, 
they wait until the last minute trying to create panic by alleging 
irregularities or illegalities." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the measure said they plan to hand-deliver copies of the 
measure's full text to residents this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
City officials had considered doing that but were advised by Adamson that it 
was unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which needs the approval of two-thirds of the city's voters, would 
raise property taxes $55 a year for homeowners and $70 a year per apartment 
unit. Businesses would pay $5.50 per foot of frontage, with a cap of $5,000. 
The tax increase is expected to raise $2.9 million a year to hire and retain 35 
more police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Community activist Raymon Sulser, who wrote the ballot argument against the 
proposal, said Thursday that the measure is unfair to businesses and that the 
city has not explored ways of hiring more officers without imposing a tax. He 
also was critical of wording in the measure that gives the city manager 
authority to determine how much the tax may increase every year based on the 
consumer price index. 
</P>
<P>
"I am for better police protection," said Sulser, "but the first thing you have 
to do is see where you can save money" before adding a tax to pay for more 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the need for a two-thirds majority and the sudden surfacing of 
opposition this week, ballot measure proponent Shelley Effler said she is 
confident the measure will pass.

FAMILY ASKS HELP IN FINDING MISSING RETIREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 64-year-old Rancho Palos Verdes man left his home early Wednesday morning to 
take his habitual morning stroll through Peck Park in San Pedro and never 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
The family of Harold Harp has asked for the public's help in finding the 
retired longshoremen's union clerk, whom they described as a man of habit who 
never deviated from his regular daily routines. 
</P>
<P>
Harp, a slightly balding man with grayish-brown hair, stands 6 feet, 1 inch 
tall and weighs about 210 pounds. He was last seen wearing a white T-shirt with 
an illustration of a yellow duck on it, and either blue jeans or shorts. 
</P>
<P>
Family members said he had no ailments that might account for his 
disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
Harp's wife, Cecile, said he left the house at 7 a.m., driving the family's 
charcoal gray 1983 Chrysler New Yorker, which has license tags reading 1FRL706. 
The car has not been found. 
</P>
<P>
His usual habit was to park the car in or near Peck Park, walk for about two 
hours and return home at 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information about Harp's whereabouts should contact the missing 
persons bureau of the Sheriff's Department at 974-4341.

PAIR ORDERED TO REPAY RTD $228,000 FOR INJURY SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles man and his girlfriend each were ordered Thursday to repay 
$114,000 to the Southern California Rapid Transit District after they admitted 
operating a phony injury claims scheme. 
</P>
<P>
The pair admitted to bilking the RTD out of $205,000. With the cost of the 
investigation added, the loss for the RTD amounts to $228,000, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Bill Seki said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Flot, 30, and Janice Curry, 29, of Glendale pleaded guilty Thursday to 
a charge of grand theft. In addition to ordering restitution, Pasadena Superior 
Court Judge Gilbert Alston ordered each to serve five years probation, pay 
$5,000 in fines and complete 250 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
A third defendant, Bambi Parker, 25, of Los Angeles, pleaded guilty in March to 
conspiracy to defraud and solicitation of others to commit a crime. She was 
given five years probation and ordered to repay $18,000 to the RTD. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-month scam began in November, 1988 -- less than a year after the RTD 
switched insurance contractors and increased its administrative monitoring in 
the wake of an investigation that revealed hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
phony insurance claims against the transit agency. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contended that the latest insurance fraud was conducted out of the 
HCM Corp., a Glendale firm and subsidiary of the Hertz Corp. hired by the RTD 
to process injury claims. 
</P>
<P>
Seki contended that Flot and Parker promised money to about 40 friends and 
relatives if they would sign claim forms for injuries received in RTD bus 
accidents. They then helped the acquaintances collect their claims, typically 
in amounts of $5,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
The participants, many of whom testified under immunity from prosecution in a 
March preliminary hearing, had not been passengers in the accidents. Some 
testified they were recruited as customers at Flot's hair salon in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Seki said Curry, a friend of Flot and Parker, worked as a claims examiner for 
HCM Corp. She moved the fraudulent claims through the system by submitting 
falsified payment authorization requests and medical documents to obtain 
settlements, the prosecutor said. The fraud was detected by a supervisor who 
became suspicious because the claims were being processed unusually quickly, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Flot and Curry faced charges of grand theft, presentation of a false claim, 
conspiracy and solicitation. The lesser charges were dropped in exchange for 
the guilty plea, Seki said.

FIRST PERSON: COMPUTER HAS DIRECT DIAL TO SLEAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NIKKI FINKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For me, the new decade officially began Christmas Day, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
That's when a computerized obscene phone caller began dialing my home number. 
</P>
<P>
It's still calling. A few days ago, It even rang me at work. 
</P>
<P>
The police don't know what to make of It. 
</P>
<P>
The phone company hasn't heard of anything like It. 
</P>
<P>
But all I can say is that if this is an example of what technological 
advancement bodes for the '90s, to heck with it. 
</P>
<P>
I mean, we've all got to deal with techno-stress. But techno-sleaze? 
</P>
<P>
I had been visiting friends Christmas Day and arrived home full of holiday 
spirit. So when the phone rang about 11 p.m., I answered with a cheerful "Merry 
Christmas!" 
</P>
<P>
There was a pause on the line. 
</P>
<P>
And then It began speaking. 
</P>
<P>
"Hello." (Three-second interval) "Hello." (Three-second interval) "Hello." 
</P>
<P>
Over and over, a computerized voice -- neither male nor female but definitely 
electronically neutered -- was repeating "Hello." 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, I was puzzled. But then I figured that one of those annoying 
computerized telephone pitches had malfunctioned. You know, the calls that 
start out, "Hello. The XYZ Real Estate Co. will pay you money if you know 
someone who wants to sell their home." 
</P>
<P>
I hung up the receiver and decided to go to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
The phone rang again. 
</P>
<P>
"Whore." (Three-second interval) "Whore." (Three-second interval) "Whore." 
</P>
<P>
Before I could make sense of the call, the phone rang again. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the message was harder to decipher. The word being repeated seemed 
to be "Fish." 
</P>
<P>
Only after listening to six or seven repetitions of the word did I finally make 
it out. 
</P>
<P>
"Feces." (Three-second interval) "Feces." (Three-second interval) "Feces." 
</P>
<P>
With that, I took the receiver off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
The next night, the computerized calls began at 11 p.m. and continued until I 
turned off the phone. Each time, the word was more disgusting. (Suffice to say 
the computer was, and still is, obsessed with sexual relations and bodily 
functions.) 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, I felt as if the phone were the enemy -- and I was its prisoner of 
war. 
</P>
<P>
I stopped answering calls altogether out of dread that It would be on the line. 
The worst times were when, in the middle of a pleasant phone chat with a 
friend, I would be interrupted by a call waiting "beep" and find that the 
computer was just spewing out more filth. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, I grew to despise that impersonal, unfeeling, voice that sounded 
like the evil twin of Hal in "2001." 
</P>
<P>
At first I couldn't believe someone wasn't just electronically altering his or 
her voice. But after listening for a couple of minutes to one call, I realized 
no human being could keep repeating one word over and over, at exactly 
three-second intervals, with no deviation whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
And, then, just as suddenly as they had started, the calls stopped. Weeks went 
by without a word of the night, and I began to relax. Clearly, I reasoned, the 
computer had been dialing randomly, had a few days of "fun" with me, and then 
gone on to the next victim. 
</P>
<P>
Or so I thought. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks later, when the phone rang at 11 p.m., I answered quickly, 
expecting the caller to be a college chum visiting from out of town. I was 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
It was on the line again. 
</P>
<P>
As I banged down the receiver, a wave of nausea washed over me. And then I 
became angry -- angry not only that a computer could do such a thing, but angry 
also at the absurdity of the situation. How did the computer get my unlisted 
number? Is the person behind this someone I knew? Who would do such a thing? 
Why would anyone want to? 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, I contacted my phone company. 
</P>
<P>
Understandably, I had to explain the problem several times before the customer 
service representative could grasp the concept that I had a computerized 
obscene phone caller. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never heard of anything like this," he said with genuine amazement. "Let 
me check with our head of security." 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, he called back. "Our head of security has never heard of 
anything like this, either." 
</P>
<P>
After making it clear that I didn't want to change my home number, I was told 
to report the problem to the police so a "trap" could be put on my phone right 
away. As I understood it, the trap would track every call made to my home 
number. All I had to do was to keep a running log of all the calls I received, 
and the times they came in, so the phone company could pinpoint which ones were 
the computer's. 
</P>
<P>
When I called the police, the officer was mercifully matter-of-fact about the 
situation. I went to work that afternoon feeling both a sense of relief and a 
need for revenge. I couldn't wait to nail this pervert. 
</P>
<P>
That night, I was ready. I put a piece of paper, a pencil and a clock by the 
phone. A few calls came in early, but all were from friends. Still, I carefully 
logged each one. As 11 p.m. neared, my heart began racing. I couldn't 
concentrate on the magazine I was reading. Instead, I was willing It to phone. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't. And It didn't phone the next night, or the night after that, either. 
So when LAPD Det. Anthony Puchalski called to see how things were going, I felt 
like an idiot. 
</P>
<P>
He was very nice about it, however, and we discussed the various ways a 
computer might be programmed to make obscene calls. 
</P>
<P>
How was the person behind it getting his jollies? Was he monitoring the calls? 
Or was he content just to know the computer was doing his dirty work? 
</P>
<P>
And how was he making the computer calls? Was he using his own phone? Or was he 
triggering the computer to dial from a third number? 
</P>
<P>
These were all questions we couldn't answer. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how they're doing it," Det. Puchalski admitted. 
</P>
<P>
After two weeks passed without any calls from the computer, I told the phone 
company to remove the trap. Frankly, I didn't like the idea of some gizmo 
keeping track of everyone's calls. I felt as if it were an invasion of their 
privacy. Nor did I particularly want to warn people that their calls were being 
traced because then I had to tell them what was going on. I thought the fewer 
who knew, the better. 
</P>
<P>
When I hadn't received the word of the night for months, I believed the problem 
had solved itself. But last week, It called again. 
</P>
<P>
And again. And again. The computer was in a phone frenzy. It even called during 
the day, which had never happened before. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as if things weren't bad enough already, It called me at work. 
</P>
<P>
How did It know where I worked? I'm not sure. Either the person behind this 
knows me, or, more probably, someone was monitoring the computer because the 
most recent message on my answering machine gives out my work number. 
</P>
<P>
So, listen up, techno-sleazebag: 
</P>
<P>
I'm going to get you. And I'm going to prosecute you. 
</P>
<P>
And, I hope, by Christmas Day, 1990, you'll be behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
Because I'm not letting you ruin the new decade for me or anyone else.

'WILD THINGS' WILL MAKE OPERA PARTY SING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's one thing to stage an opera, another to stage a gala, but to try and 
combine the two is as complex as any Verdi plot. The Music Center Opera has 
decided to risk the complications and hold its June 8 benefit gala amid the 
extravagant scenery for the opera "Where the Wild Things Are." 
</P>
<P>
Designed by Maurice Sendak from his children's book, these sets are, well, 
wild. Smoking volcanoes and sea storms as well as 10-foot-tall Wild Thing 
characters will surround the 500 guests. (But no fire-breathing dragon. It 
appears in the opera; fire marshals nixed it for the party.) 
</P>
<P>
"The opera is the most amazing translation from book size to giant size. Very 
vibrant, very alive," production stage manager Chari Shanker said. "If nothing 
else you'll go out whistling the scenery." "Wild Things" opens June 7 on a 
double bill with Sendak's "Higglety Pigglety Pop." 
</P>
<P>
It will be a Music Center first to have an on-stage, in-the-sets gala. "Having 
the party on stage will give it a fantastic, whimsical quality," said Joan 
Hotchkis, who co-chairs the gala with Carol Henry. "In a sense its a non-opera, 
opera party because it's a children's opera, but it should make it a lot of 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
It is a unique challenge for a company accustomed to putting on operas, not 
parties -- as well as social planners accustomed to putting on parties, not 
stage shows. 
</P>
<P>
For the opera company's technical people, situating the guests on stage 
presents the curious problem of reversing all the procedures that usually go 
into setting up a stage. 
</P>
<P>
The sets, the lights, and the orchestra must be arranged so they can be best 
enjoyed from the stage, not the auditorium. And what is usually the flow of 
actors will be the flow of waiters. It's an exercise opera company technical 
director Wally Russell likens to "mental reversal." 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be like theater-in-the-round except the audience will be in the 
center," Russell said. "This is such a unique environment, it should be very 
different for people used to going to banquet halls." 
</P>
<P>
There's a performance of the opera that afternoon, leaving only a few hours to 
dismantle the sets, refigure them for the party, and arrange the tables for 
dinner. "You have to do a lot of prep work to minimize the actual work," 
Russell said. "That, and plan, plan, plan. We run dry scenes, what we call 'dry 
tech.' Run through all the scenes, see who's going here and there, do a plan of 
action so there won't be any problems. 
</P>
<P>
"And since they're coming on stage for their dinner we want them to be able to 
wander around backstage a bit," Russell said. "We're making sure the backstage 
is all lit up. It's kind of an interesting place with all the ropes and cables 
you normally don't see." 
</P>
<P>
It's this chance for the guests to experience a diva's-eye view from the stage 
that gala chairs hope will make $350-a-ticket event -- which is being 
underwritten by Dorothy Brown -- a sell-out that would raise $175,000 for the 
opera. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on stage after 'Don Carlo,' " said Hotchkis, "and it's such an 
incredible feeling to look out at the audience. We want the guests to feel the 
same excitement." 
</P>
<P>
The co-chairwomen and their committee have been spending time off stage 
choosing which sets will be used for the gala. Complicating matters is the fact 
that the sets didn't arrive from Minneapolis until May 25 and weren't scheduled 
to be installed until late this week. 
</P>
<P>
This forced the organizers to work with blueprints and videos. The Opera 
Company has put the information on the sets and the placement of the gala's 
tables into its computer system to create a computer picture of the event. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made preliminary choices already on what sets we'll use from photos and 
videos," said Henry. 
</P>
<P>
"And when they put them up, 'the scenic loading' they call it, we'll see which 
ones are best and finalize our decisions." 
</P>
<P>
No matter which sets are chosen, opera company manager Robin Thompson is 
confident the guests will enjoy them because "there are adult ideas couched in 
these childlike fantasies. It's a fabulous place to have a party." 
</P>
<P>
Or an opera.

<P>
Itabari Njeri, a Times staff writer in the View section, was lauded at the 
American Book Awards for her new book, "Every Good-bye Ain't Gone." 
</P>
<P>
The much-praised portrait of Njeri's own diverse and unusual family was one of 
almost two dozen works cited Thursday night by judges for making an 
"outstanding contribution to American literature." 
</P>
<P>
Besides honoring Njeri, the 10-year-old American Book Awards, which recently 
announced it will move its annual ceremony from New York to coincide with the 
Miami Book Fair International, also presented lifetime achievement awards to 
writers Allen Ginsberg and Sonia Sanchez.

UNITARDS ARE BECOMING THE ONE-PIECE YOU MUST HAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CINDY LaFAVRE YORKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some people call them unitards, others prefer catsuits. Either term defines the 
second skin that promises to be the hottest fashion item of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Dancers have worn them for decades, of course. Among ready-to-wear designers, 
Italy's Emilio Pucci was among the first to treat them as street wear when he 
introduced them in psychedelic prints nearly 25 years ago. Recently, New York 
designers Donna Karan and Norma Kamali have offered several variations. So has 
Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel. 
</P>
<P>
Designer labels range from $200 to several thousand for a couture look by 
Christian Lacroix, but varieties available in contemporary and junior 
departments of local stores start at about $40. 
</P>
<P>
Some have suspender straps and require a T-shirt underneath. Others are one 
piece, with long or capped sleeves. Some do, some don't zip up the back. Some 
are cut wider through the hips for extra room. Necklines run the usual gamut, 
legs have stirrups, or end above the ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Even expectant mothers are buying maternity versions of the body-clinging suit. 
By next fall, fashion directors at local stores predict that unitards will be 
among the top five fashion musts on most women's shopping lists. 
</P>
<P>
"We're absolutely fired up about them," says Leslie Marks, fashion director at 
Robinson's, who sees them as a versatile, body wear basic. "You can start with 
a unitard and slip on a jacket or a skirt, or wear it alone for a linear look." 
</P>
<P>
Among the high-price designers, Donna Karan has mastered the unitard as first 
layer in her recent collections, topped by circle-skirted dresses, sarong 
skirts, hooded anoraks or long, narrow man-tailored "boyfriend" jackets. Most 
big-name designers prefer the classic cut, with long sleeves and a jewel or 
mock turtle neckline, but Karan often opts for sportier, suspender styles, worn 
over white blouses or body-contoured tops in luxury fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the lower-priced unitards this summer are Lycra and cotton knit blends. 
But, Marks says that this fall Robinson's will carry stretch velvet styles in 
the intimate apparel department. 
</P>
<P>
Among the summer options at Nordstrom are earthy shades such as forest green, 
wine, mustard, espresso brown, navy and gray. Noticeably absent from the 
Nordstrom lineup is black, says June Rau, fashion coordinator for the company's 
Southern California stores. 
</P>
<P>
At Robinson's, however, Marks says black is the most important color right now. 
There are also black and white houndstooth unitards. 
</P>
<P>
Rau maintains that unitards are not just for rail-thin physiques. And Donna 
Karan, who wears a Size 10 or 12, and is often seen in her own label unitards 
under skirts and jackets, helps prove Rau's point. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of women who might be put off by them will be surprised at how well they 
fit and look," says Rau, pointing out that strategically placed gathers and 
flares at the hips and waist add fullness where some women need it.

TRAIL BLAZERS TAKE ONE AWAY ON ROAD, 112-109; 
</P>
<P>
NBA PLAYOFFS: WILLIAMS MAKES KEY STEAL AS PORTLAND ELIMINATES PHOENIX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buck Williams did not just strip Tom Chambers of the ball Thursday night. He 
took away the Phoenix Suns' fading playoff hopes, obliterated the notion of 
home-court dominance and ended 13 seasons of Portland Trail Blazer frustration 
since their last trip to the NBA championship series in 1976-77. 
</P>
<P>
In one stealthy move, Williams did all that. The Trail Blazer forward's steal 
with eight seconds left, the last of several late and crucial defensive plays, 
enabled Portland to secure a 112-109 victory over the Suns in Game 6 of the 
Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
Finally breaking through on the road, after losing two previous times at 
Veterans Memorial Coliseum, the Trail Blazers felt it fitting that the victory 
that will send them to the championship series for the first time since the 
1976-77 season was made possible by tough defense in a close game. 
</P>
<P>
It was the way the Trail Blazers won all four games, the first three coming at 
home. Even though the Suns were without point guard Kevin Johnson, who sat out 
the second half with a strained left hamstring, the Trail Blazers nonetheless 
again made all the big plays at big times. 
</P>
<P>
None was bigger than Williams' steal. Portland clung to a 110-109 lead with 23 
seconds left, but Phoenix had the ball. Without Johnson to run the offense, the 
Suns' options were guard Jeff Hornacek, who had 36 points and played 
brilliantly, or Chambers, who had 17 points but played horrendously. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers, perhaps by process of elimination, was the choice. 
</P>
<P>
He had posted low against Williams and received an unobstructed pass from 
Hornacek. When Chambers turned and swung the ball near his ankles like a 
pendulum, Williams was crouched and ready to pounce. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been watching Tom Chambers do that all series," Williams said. "He tries 
to rake the ball, swing it around, to give himself space. I got very low and I 
was ready for him. I was picking my spots." 
</P>
<P>
Williams' timing was impeccable. After gaining possession of the ball, he 
slapped it to Clyde Drexler, who was fouled and made both free throws for a 
112-109 lead with 6.8 seconds left. Hornacek's desperation three-pointer at the 
buzzer failed, and the Trail Blazers had, well, stolen the Western Conference 
final series from the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, calling it a steal is high praise. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fitting we won it like this," Drexler said. "That's the way we won it all 
season." It was how the Trail Blazers overcame a 10-point third quarter deficit 
to make it close in the fourth quarter and, eventually, overtake the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers, who had all of his 17 points in the second half, claimed he was 
fouled. In fact, he said Williams pushed him out of the post even before the 
steal. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just the way it goes," Chambers said. "I was posting up at the low post 
at the beginning of the play, and I wound up in three-point land. I didn't walk 
out there by myself." 
</P>
<P>
Prior to Williams' steal, Jerome Kersey blocked a shot by Hornacek. The Suns 
still had a 109-108 lead with about 40 seconds left when Hornacek saw and 
opening in the lane and drove. 
</P>
<P>
Kersey stepped in and blocked Horacek's running one-hander. Then, he deftly 
retrieved the ball and passed to Drexler to start the fast break. Kersey 
finished the break with a layup and a 110-109 Trail Blazer lead with 27 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
"(Hornacek) had a lot of rotation on that shot; it was kind of a lob," Kersey 
said. "I just wanted to get a hand on it." 
</P>
<P>
Trail Blazer hands were everywhere. Their strong defensive play enabled them to 
win the series despite making barely more than 40% of their shots. 
</P>
<P>
"When the game was on the line, defensively we did what we had to do," said 
Portland guard Terry Porter, who had 23 points. "It's just a sign of our mental 
toughness that we can win so many close games. You don't do that unless you're 
mentally tough." 
</P>
<P>
Said Sun Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons: "I wanted the ball in Tom Chambers' hands or 
Hornacek's hands, and we got it to them the last two plays. But Portland has 
great athletes, and they made great plays. Give Portland credit for that." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Kevin Johnson's absence in the second half adversely affected the 
Suns. Yet, with Hornacek making 11 of 22 shots and all 14 free-throw attempts, 
the Suns carried on quite well for at least one quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But even with Johnson earlier in the series, the Suns had been incapable of 
executing well enough to win close games. However, the Suns had beaten the 
Trail Blazers at home twice by a combined 46 points with Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, their spirits sank when he limped of the court with 2:54 left in the 
half, shortly after making a three-point play on a driving layup. 
</P>
<P>
"You can never overcome KJ's loss," said Sun swingman Dan Majerle, who had 22 
points through three quarters but was shut out from there. "They just kept 
chipping away at our lead. We tried to throw some points at them, and they just 
kept coming back." 
</P>
<P>
Given their five-game road playoff losing streak, many figured the Trail 
Blazers would have to come back to Portland to try to win the series. They were 
as concerned as anybody about their inability to win on the road. They had read 
Fitzsimmons' needling comments about it in the local newspapers and used it as 
a rallying point. 
</P>
<P>
"We showed the rest of the country we could win on the road," said Drexler, who 
also had 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
"To some extent it's true, because we've been struggling on the road," Porter 
added. "But we knew we could. It was just a matter of executing. Whenever it 
gets down to a close game, we have about four or five go-to guys." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Trail Blazers will either go to Auburn Hills, Mich., to meet the 
Detroit Pistons in the finals or stay in Portland and host the Chicago Bulls.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE CAN SEE INTO THE FUTURE, BUT VISION ISN'T ALWAYS 20/20

Abubaker Omar Shariff, the Kenyan witch doctor who correctly predicted that 
Manchester United would win England's F.A. Cup in soccer, has predicted that 
Italy will win the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Or has he? 
</P>
<P>
Said Reuters: "To be on the safe side, he has picked five other strong 
contenders. He says reigning champion Argentina, England, the Netherlands, the 
Soviet Union and Sweden all have a good chance should Italy falter." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks, Doc. 
</P>
<P>
Bad joke: Said San Francisco Giant Manager Roger Craig, recalling Monday's game 
at Chicago, where his old buddy, Cub Manager Don Zimmer, threw a tantrum after 
the umpires reversed themselves and ruled that Ryne Sandberg's home run was a 
foul ball: "I called him. I said, 'The ball was foul. You held up the game and 
got my pitcher tired.' He hung up." 
</P>
<P>
Said Sandberg, when asked what he said to umpire Randy Marsh: "I told him I 
thought the call was weak. Well, something similar to that." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who was the last pitcher to throw a no-hitter against the Dodgers? 
</P>
<P>
Storm warning: From Bill Lyon of the Philadelphia Inquirer, suggesting that the 
Boston Celtics' Larry Bird, who differed with Jimmy Rodgers on strategy, helped 
grease the skids for the coach: "At one point, after Rodgers forcefully 
suggested that Bird pass more, Bird did just that -- he blatantly passed up 
shots to pass the ball, whether the receiver was open or not. 
</P>
<P>
"At that moment, you knew Rodgers was gone." 
</P>
<P>
The survivor: Said reserve forward Ed Nealy of the Chicago Bulls, when asked to 
list his career highlights: "Every time I make a team, it's a highlight." 
</P>
<P>
Mike's lament: After his No. 20 uniform was retired at Philadelphia, Mike 
Schmidt told Phillie announcer Richie Ashburn he was upset that Pete Rose 
hadn't been invited to the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a tough time with that," Schmidt said. "Pete and I are close friends. 
When he came to the Phillies, he had a very positive effect on my career. I'll 
always be indebted to Pete for that." 
</P>
<P>
As for Rose's gambling, Schmidt said: "I can't take his side in what has 
happened off the field. All I can say is that I love Pete for what he did for 
me, and I think he knows I would have done anything to have him standing by my 
side." 
</P>
<P>
He's not kidding: Davey Johnson, who blamed a breakdown in communications with 
the New York Mets' front office for his firing, was asked how he would like 
working for George Steinbrenner with the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing," he said, "you'd definitely have a lot of conversations." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Tom Browning, Cincinnati Reds, 1988. He pitched a perfect game 
to beat the Dodgers, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: George Vecsey of the New York Times, on the firing of Davey Johnson 
by the Mets: "Darryl Strawberry was quoted as saying the Mets felt 'numb' after 
Johnson was dropped. Big deal. They've been numb for two months." HARLEY

<P>
OUTDOORS: EXECUTIVE SECRETARY OF STATE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION PROBABLY WILL

<P>
Hal Cribbs, who will probably be fired as executive secretary by the California 
Fish and Game Commission next week, is, arguably, the second most powerful fish 
and game official in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Only Pete Bontadelli, director of the Department of Fish and Game, has more 
influence on wildlife matters. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, which has scheduled a special hearing at 10 a.m. Monday, 
reportedly blames Cribbs for ongoing problems with the Legislature. Nine bills 
are pending that would alter or eliminate the commission's role in managing the 
state's fish and game resources. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's hearing, at which Cribbs will testify on his own behalf, has 
triggered another hearing, hastily arranged by Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San 
Jose), chairman of the Senate Natural Resources and Wildlife Committee, 
scheduled to start at 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the purpose of McCorquodale's hearing is to determine the 
relationship between the commission and the Legislature, as well as the DFG. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Shallenberger, a staff aide to McCorquodale, said: "If he had any 
confidence that the majority of commissioners had a strong background and a 
genuine concern for the resource, he would probably be less inclined to get 
involved. But given that the commission seems to be in such disarray, this is 
to take a close look at what they are doing. 
</P>
<P>
"We have heard rumors that Cribbs is being used as a scapegoat." 
</P>
<P>
McCorquodale also scheduled a hearing by his committee on a similar subject 
when the commission tried to fire Cribbs three years ago. He called it off when 
the Assembly held one that led to no meaningful conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
Cribbs refused the commission's latest unofficial request to resign two weeks 
ago and, as an executive officer of an appointed commission, is entitled to a 
public hearing before he can be fired. 
</P>
<P>
The commission wasted no time in scheduling such a hearing, which looms as a 
speedy trial followed by a quick hanging. 
</P>
<P>
"The announcement is that I'm going to be terminated," said Cribbs, 53, the 
commission's top full-time staff member since 1979. "This is not a good time in 
my life. I've done a good job for them." 
</P>
<P>
Cribbs, a wildlife biologist, would be entitled to a Civil Service position 
with the DFG. Commission President Bob Bryant of Yuba City and commission 
member Everett McCracken of Carmichael approached Cribbs after the commission's 
regular meetings at San Luis Obispo May 18. Bryant asked McCracken to do the 
talking. 
</P>
<P>
"(Bryant) is a very sympathetic man," McCracken said. "All the commissioners 
had agreed that's what we wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
However, only two could approach Cribbs without violating the Brown Act, which 
requires the majority of a state agency to conduct its business in public. 
</P>
<P>
Cribbs said later: "All they told me was, the intent was to improve 
relationships with the department and the Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
But Cribbs refused to resign, forcing Monday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Cribbs is perceived as being left of the commission on environmental issues. 
One recurring complaint is that he has aligned himself too closely with 
Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress), whose campaign against inshore gill nets 
has made her an enemy of commercial fishing interests in general and Bontadelli 
in particular. 
</P>
<P>
Introduction of the nine bills followed a report in January by the Little 
Hoover Commission -- a state watchdog for government agencies -- that was 
severely critical of the structure and performance of the commission and the 
DFG. 
</P>
<P>
Two commissioners said that legislators had complained to them about Cribbs' 
interference, leading to an inference that firing Cribbs would turn down the 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
Edna Maita, senior consultant for the Assembly Committee on Water, Parks and 
Resources that helped to draft the bills, said: "Whether (Cribbs) stays or goes 
is not a bearing on these bills. These bills were put in by leading Republicans 
and leading Democrats, and they were put in for the purpose of good government. 
They have nothing to do with personalities." 
</P>
<P>
The bills, none of which could become law before late summer, if then, are 
far-ranging. 
</P>
<P>
A package of three -- Assembly Bills 3158, 3159 and 3160 -- by Jim Costa 
(D-Fresno) would transfer the commission's authority to the DFG, which would be 
renamed the Department of Fish and Wildlife. AB 4039 by David Kelley (R-Hemet) 
would establish separate nine-member advisory committees for sportfishing-game 
and nonsportfishing-game species to be consulted by the commission before 
adopting regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Constitutional Amendment 51, by Robert Campbell (D-Richmond) would 
specify the qualifications of commission members and have them appointed to 
represent specific interests. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Bill 2840 by McCorquodale would create a new Fish and Wildlife 
Commission of 12 members serving four-year terms, instead of the present six, 
with four each appointed by the governor, the Senate Rules Committee and the 
speaker of the Assembly, instead of all by the governor -- and each would be 
from a specified interest group. 
</P>
<P>
Only one bill, ACA 52 by Richard Mountjoy (R-Monrovia), would strengthen the 
commission, prescribing the qualifications of the DFG director and his top two 
aides and directing that they be appointed by the commission, instead of the 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
That's the one the commission likes best. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the bills tend to strengthen the DFG at the expense of the 
commission -- at a time when the department is cutting back operations because 
of a $7.5 million deficit in its $151-million budget for the fiscal year ending 
July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Taucher, a former commission president, said he didn't blame Cribbs' conduct 
for the bills and conceded: "We do need some restructuring. We have five 
regions in the department. We need a commissioner from each region." 
</P>
<P>
Taucher also said the commissioners should have open minds, not preset 
convictions about hunting or other volatile issues. 
</P>
<P>
Others say Cribbs is the main reason the commission ever got anything done. 
McCracken said the commissioners, who meet about once a month, have relied 
heavily on his guidance. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to," said McCracken, a retired oil lobbyist. "We're just a part-time 
operation. We depend on the staff a great deal." 
</P>
<P>
Cribbs would probably be replaced, at least temporarily, by his top assistant, 
Ron Pelzman.

TV-RADIO: MICHAELS' DISPUTE WITH ABC GOES TO ARBITRATION MONDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Monday, in the Century City office of labor lawyer Stuart P. Herman, an 
unusual arbitration hearing between sportscaster Al Michaels and his employer, 
ABC, will begin. 
</P>
<P>
Michaels is seeking to get out of his ABC contract, supposedly to sign with 
CBS. 
</P>
<P>
Three sessions are scheduled for next week, then Michaels will head for New 
York to work the Belmont Stakes. Three more sessions are scheduled the 
following week. 
</P>
<P>
The Michaels party, which includes attorney Bill Cole, has asked for a decision 
from the three-member arbitration panel by June 15. 
</P>
<P>
Michaels and Dennis Swanson, president of ABC Sports, at one time were very 
close. Michaels raved about Swanson even when others didn't. 
</P>
<P>
But the relationship deteriorated to a point where Michaels was suspended for 
two weeks without pay for an apparent minor offense -- his teen-age daughter 
worked as an ABC runner at a figure skating event in February. 
</P>
<P>
Such things are against a company nepotism policy, but, on the surface, a 
warning would seem to have sufficed. 
</P>
<P>
One turning point in the Michaels-Swanson relationship occurred after Game 2 of 
the Bay Area World Series, which took place on a Sunday night. After reading a 
promo for "Monday Night Football," a game between the Rams and Buffalo Bills, 
Michaels was asked by partner Tim McCarver if he was going to watch it. 
</P>
<P>
Michaels flippantly said he would tape it. Well, apparently the one thing you 
don't do is mess with an ABC promo. Reportedly, Michaels and Swanson had heated 
words. 
</P>
<P>
Add Michaels: After he was suspended, Michaels and his union, the American 
Federation of Radio and Television Artists, filed a grievance. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, Michaels expanded his grievance, claiming that he is entitled to 
get out of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
At the arbitration hearing, Herman is the neutral person on the three-member 
panel. The others are Hirsch Adell, a Los Angeles lawyer chosen by AFTRA, and 
Bernard Gold, a Los Angeles lawyer chosen by ABC. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley, after meeting with NBC officials in New York to discuss 
the possibility of work as an NBA commentator next season, ran into some 
problems getting back to Los Angeles Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
His American Airlines flight experienced a nose gear problem (it failed to 
close) after takeoff from Kennedy Airport, and the plane returned to the 
airport and landed without incident. It took off again after a 2-hour 25-minute 
delay. 
</P>
<P>
Riley could not be reached for comment Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
As you might expect, the Lakers' early elimination from the playoffs has 
affected the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Game 4 of the Western Conference finals between the Lakers and 
Phoenix drew an overnight Nielsen rating of 7.9. This year, Game 4 between 
Phoenix and Portland, which was close and exciting, drew a 6.7. 
</P>
<P>
CBS has flip-flopped its NBA announcing teams. You might have noticed Thursday 
night that Dick Stockton and Hubie Brown were on Portland-Phoenix. Verne 
Lundquist and Len Elmore will work tonight's Eastern game. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the top names in the French Open have been eliminated, among them 
defending women's champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain, who was beaten 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But NBC, which takes over the weekend coverage from ESPN, still has Jimmy 
Connors to showcase -- as a commentator. Connors, 38, is taking some time off 
from competition because of a wrist injury and has been hired by NBC, along 
with Chris Evert, his one-time girlfriend. Connors, promising to be candid and 
honest, doesn't foresee any problems with players. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally never held a grudge," he said. "I don't think (tennis players) 
are that touchy, but if they are I guess I'm about to find out." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent, addressing a delegation at an Associated 
Press Sports Editors meeting in New York, talked about the CBS package in which 
there are telecasts on only 16 of the 26 baseball Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
"Indications are games on Saturday are rated where they've been historically 
rated," he said. "CBS has not heard from its affiliates panting for more 
baseball on Saturdays. My view is, we got the number to 16. If CBS wanted more, 
we'd talk. They haven't at the moment. We'll wait and see how the season goes." 
</P>
<P>
Boxing beat: Showtime televises tonight's Evander Holyfield-Seamus McDonagh 
fight at 7, with HBO handling the June 16 doubleheader at Caesars Palace in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
That's the one in which Mike Tyson faces Henry Tillman, and George Foreman, in 
his stiffest comeback test so far, takes on Adilson Rodrigues. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more interesting aspects about this event is that it is being 
co-promoted by former enemies Bob Arum and Don King. Only in boxing. 
</P>
<P>
Add boxing: Maybe some network should sign Jerry Quarry and his promoter, John 
Ellis, a former boxer. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, their scrap in Wisconsin this week, which left Quarry with a 
cut eye, was better than most fights on TV. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis reportedly was knocked out, while one of Ellis' brothers worked over 
Quarry's trainer, Guy Ditmars, putting him into a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Regional vertical dunk competition, open to all except professionals and 
college players with eligibility left, will be held at Loyola Marymount's 
Gersten Pavilion Sunday at 10:30 a.m., with the winner qualifying for the 
finals June 25 in Atlantic City, N.J., and a $50,000 first prize. 
</P>
<P>
Those interested should be at Loyola to sign up before 10:30. The basket will 
be elevated to a new height after each round, with the opening height being 11 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
The vertical dunk finals will be part of a two-hour pay-per-view telecast 
featuring a one-on-one collegiate challenge with Bo Kimble, Lionel Simmons, 
Gary Payton, Derrick Coleman, Chris Jackson, Travis Mays, Sean Higgins and 
Bimbo Coles competing. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
ESPN's College World Series coverage begins today. Cal State Fullerton's first 
game, against Oklahoma State, will be televised Saturday at 5 p.m., with Mike 
Patrick and Jim Kaat reporting. . . . This is ESPN's 11th year of covering the 
College World Series. The championship game is scheduled to be televised by CBS 
Saturday, June 9. 
</P>
<P>
Following tonight's Detroit-Chicago NBA game on CBS will be a special, "Sports 
Comedy Network." An Ohlmeyer Communications show, it was produced by Linda 
Jonsson and Richard Crystal, brother of Billy. The star is comedian Jeff 
Cesario. At the top of the show, Cesario, wearing a white wig, plays off-beat 
sports anchor Chet Waterhouse. The show has some funny moments. A highlight is 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar making fun of himself as a hypocrite, a supposedly 
concerned do-gooder who is more interested in selling his new book and his new 
cassette. . . . A new series focusing on baseball's history, "Equitable 
Old-Timers Series Magazine," makes its debut on FNN Sports Saturday at 1:30 
p.m. The first show will pay tribute to the old Negro leagues, and Joe 
Garagiola will take a look at the Baseball Assistance Team (BAT), created to 
aid former players and their families. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 4 has promoted Jeff Hoffman, who has been at the station since July, 
1989, to senior sports producer. Hoffman replaces Sol Steinberg, who is now at 
Prime Ticket. Hoffman is a Maryland graduate who for three years was a producer 
on the "George Michael Sports Machine.". . . Prime Ticket, which has grown to 
4.1 million subscribers, has impressive new facilities in Century City. One 
could live comfortably in network president John Severino's office. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Palmer will fill in for Joe Morgan on the ESPN baseball telecast of 
Minnesota vs. Chicago Sunday night. Morgan is taking time off to attend his 
daughter's high school graduation. Coincidentally, Morgan himself will graduate 
from Cal State Hayward June 16. . . . SportsChannel will televise Saturday 
night's Southern Section 5-A baseball championship game between Huntington 
Beach Marina High and Diamond Bar on Sunday at 1:30 p.m. . . . If sportscaster 
Peter Vent, now heard on the KIEV airwaves Monday through Thursday, 10:30 to 11 
p.m., were a high-flying basketball player, he could call himself Air Vent.

The University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff has been asked to explain 76 
allegations lodged against the school's football program by college football 
coaches, according to a Pine Bluff newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations involved player eligibility, playing non-registered players and 
improper transfers of students from other schools. The article said the 
complaints were lodged by coaches, both in and out of the Arkansas 
Intercollegiate Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Archie Cooley, UAPB head football coach and athletic director, denied the

CANDAELE STATES HIS DESIRE FOR BIG DOUBLE; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK AND FIELD: CARPINTERIA STAR SEEKS TWO VICTORIES AND A SUB-FOUR-MINUTE 
MILE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After finishing third in the 1,600-meter run at the CIF state track and field 
meet as a sophomore, Carpinteria High's Coley Candaele was determined to 
improve. 
</P>
<P>
As a junior last year, he qualified for state again in the 1,600, and in the 
late stages of the race was racing for second place with Todd Lewis of Burbank. 
As they neared the finish line, Candaele dived across, edging Lewis. Francis 
O'Neill of San Pasqual won in 4 minutes 8.67 seconds and Candaele finished 
second in 4:09.1. 
</P>
<P>
"There was just no way I was going to finish third again," Candaele said. "I 
had set a goal to do better, and I wasn't going to let the goal slip away. 
Sure, I got a few scrapes, but, heck, it was worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Going into today's preliminaries at the state meet at Cerritos College, the 
Carpinteria senior leads the nation in the 1,600 with a time of 4:06.58. His 
converted mile time of 4:08.03 has Candaele believing he can become the first 
prep runner in California to break four minutes since Tim Danielson of Chula 
Vista ran 3:59.4 in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Winning the 1,600 in record time, though, isn't enough. Candaele, who has the 
fifth-fastest time in the nation in the 800 with a 1:50.87, also has his sights 
set on becoming the first runner in the state to win such a double since Earl 
Lockhart of Sacramento High in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
If Candaele qualifies for Saturday night's finals in both events, he will have 
only 45 minutes' rest between races. The race lengths and short interval make 
it a particularly difficult double. 
</P>
<P>
Accomplishing the improbable, though, is nothing new to Candaele. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing that his future athletic career was in track, Candaele risked injury by 
playing quarterback for four years at Carpinteria. With him as a varsity 
starter, the Warriors were 38-3-1 and won two Southern Section championships 
and tied for another. Candaele, 5-11 and 165 pounds, was selected the section's 
Division IX player of the year last fall. 
</P>
<P>
He has a track scholarship to the University of Oregon, considered as one of 
the best schools in the country for distance runners. If he had wanted to 
continue his football career, a number of schools were interested, including 
the Air Force Academy, said Carpinteria Coach Lou Panizzon. 
</P>
<P>
Candaele is an honors student at Carpinteria, a school of 700 students 10 miles 
south of Santa Barbara. He has a 3.85 grade-point average and ranks eighth in a 
class of 144. He is a member of the California Scholastic Federation, which 
includes the top students in the state. He loves math and said he may become an 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Studying has been as challenging as athletics for Candaele, who suffers from 
dyslexia, a permanent neurological disorder that makes reading difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"What takes most people 15 minutes to read takes me a couple of hours," 
Candaele said. "I have to get up very early some mornings or stay up late at 
night to finish my homework. I'm very serious about school, and I know track 
isn't everything. I strive to be the best in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"Dyslexia has proved to be my biggest challenge. In athletics, the harder you 
work the better you get. But my progress with reading has been at a much slower 
pace. It's very frustrating at times. I just work hard and try do what is 
necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Candaele scored 1,060 points on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, a standardized 
college entrance exam. His score put him among the top 36% in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Candaele, 18, strives to be at the top. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago at the Southern Section meet, Louie Quintana of Arroyo Grande ran 
the nation's top time of the season in the 1,600, 4:07.2, while winning the 2-A 
Division title. Ten minutes later, Candaele ran a personal best of 4.06.58, 
winning the 1-A title and taking over the nation's top spot. 
</P>
<P>
Quintana then ran a 1:51.91 in winning the 2-A 800, but once again was topped 
by Candaele, who won the 1-A title in 1:50.87. 
</P>
<P>
"Coley has such incredible confidence," Quintana said. "He's built that 
confidence up over the years and it's hard to destroy or defeat it. Every race 
against him is a mental challenge, and that's the toughest thing to beat." 
</P>
<P>
Candaele is undefeated this season. His long list of victories covers such 
prestigious meets as the Arcadia Invitational, Mt. San Antonio College Relays 
and the Masters meet. 
</P>
<P>
At Arcadia, the 800 offered a showdown between Candaele and highly regarded 
Steve Adderly of Delray Beach, Fla., who leads the nation in the event with a 
1:49.6. Candaele, though, won that race in 1:51.19, and Adderly was third in 
1:52.01. 
</P>
<P>
"I must be getting a little callous, because nothing that Coley does surprises 
me any more," said Van Latham, Carpinteria's track coach. "He's an amazing 
athlete, but when he does amazing things now, I take them for granted. I fully 
expect him to win every race." 
</P>
<P>
The Carpinteria senior began his track career with a club team in the first 
grade. He has since tried almost every event, but the mile is his favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"The mile is a very competitive race," Candaele said. "I like going one-on-one 
with somebody and knowing they're going through pain and so are you. It's fun 
to see who can hold out and finish first." 
</P>
<P>
To increase his chances at a high finish at state last year, Candaele decided 
to run the 1,600 and 800. He won both events at the Masters the week before, 
but planned on dropping the 800 at state to concentrate on the mile. But after 
faring well in the preliminaries, Candaele felt he was up to the double duty. 
</P>
<P>
After his dramatic second-place finish in the 1,600, he faltered in the 800 and 
finished sixth in 1:53.61. He vows the same thing won't happen this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Candaele such a strong runner is his kick. In the 1,600, he 
characteristically runs at the back of the lead pack and makes his move on the 
final lap. He often has to make up as much as 30 meters down the backstretch. 
His strategy is the same in the 800, although he runs closer to the lead since 
it is a shorter race. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate his speed, Candaele ran his final lap in the 1,600 at the Masters 
last week in 56.6 seconds, overtaking Quintana for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"His kick is quite bothersome," said Agoura's Bryan Dameworth, the state and 
national cross country champion. "I've been running against Coley since the 
sixth grade, and he likes to just sit on me until the end. And he's so intense 
on the track with that football animal behavior of his, that it's hard to hold 
him off. He's one of the most intense runners I've ever competed against." 
</P>
<P>
Candaele comes from an athletic background. His father, Rick Candaele, is in 
his sixth year as football coach at UC Santa Barbara. Coley's uncle, Casey 
Candaele, is a reserve infielder-outfielder for the Houston Astros. His 
grandmother, Helen St. Aubin, played professional baseball in the All-American 
Girls Baseball League in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Although Candaele took an immediate interest in track, he has competed in 
almost every sport. When the family lived in Idaho, he enjoyed playing hockey. 
He has kicked soccer balls, shot basketballs and hit baseballs. Because of his 
father, Candaele has always loved playing football. 
</P>
<P>
Directing a veer offense at Carpinteria, Candaele broke several school records. 
He holds records for points, 222; touchdowns, 33; yards passing, 4,620, and 
passes completed, 320. He is the school's fifth-leading rusher with 1,714 
yards. He was first-team all-Tri Valley League three times and all-Southern 
Section twice. 
</P>
<P>
"Coley is one of those kids who does all you ask of him and more," Panizzon 
said. "He has a lot of confidence in everything he does. 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely the best quarterback-miler I've ever had."

DISNEY'S T-SHIRT CAMPAIGN A PREMATURE FLOP?; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETING: 'DICK TRACY' PROMOTION RUNS INTO SOME SNAGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
When patrons showed up in movie theaters last weekend and asked where they 
could buy the "Dick Tracy" T-shirts that would serve as their admission tickets 
to a special pre-opening midnight screening of the movie June 14, some theater 
operators didn't have a shirt to their name. 
</P>
<P>
"Disney started running ads announcing the T-shirt promotion on Friday, but 
some theaters didn't even get their shirts until Tuesday," said an executive of 
a national theater chain. "They jumped the gun on this one, there's no 
question." 
</P>
<P>
Disney executives would not comment on details of the T-shirt promotion, but 
sources in the exhibition industry say that because "Dick Tracy" was shown to 
film buyers later than usual, the studio could not close its bidding until May 
23, two days before the T-shirt promotion began. Newspaper and magazine ads 
announced that the "limited edition" T-shirts "go on sale May 25 at 
participating theaters" but many of the estimated half-million shirts were 
still en route on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A Disney official said that about 1,500 theaters are participating in the 
T-shirt/midnight screening promotion, but he said the studio wasn't really 
expecting the campaign to kick in until this weekend. One exhibitor whose 
T-shirts did arrive on time said one of his chain's multiplexes sold only 9 
shirts over Memorial Day Weekend. "Disney has stepped in a black hole on this 
one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other exhibitors reported different results: Milt Moritz, vice president for 
advertising and public relations at Pacific Theaters, which owns 300 screens in 
California and will be showing "Dick Tracy" on 13 of those, reported that sales 
of T-shirts had been brisk since they began last Friday. "In some theaters 
we've sold as much as 30% already," Moritz said. "I'd be surprised if we don't 
sell it (the midnight screening) out." 
</P>
<P>
Word of the T-shirt snafu may have had executives smiling at other studios, and 
combined with Disney's earlier decision to move the opening of "Dick Tracy" 
back a week from June 8 to June 15, it fueled hopes that the Warren 
Beatty-directed comic strip film won't be the 800-pound box office gorilla that 
many people expect it to be. But the exhibitors who won the bidding war for the 
film have seen the movie and are betting big money that it's going to be a hit. 
</P>
<P>
"Exhibitors are going for it hook, line and sinker," said John Krier, president 
of Exhibitor Relations, a company that provides trade information to theater 
owners. "We've all seen the picture and liked it, but we don't know yet if the 
public will go for it." 
</P>
<P>
"Dick Tracy," which co-stars Beatty, Madonna and Al Pacino, was not shown to 
exhibitors until the middle of May and exhibition sources say even Disney 
executives were surprised at the bids made on the movie. One chain reportedly 
committed to showing "Dick Tracy" for 20 weeks -- which would extend it into 
November. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some industry observers are skeptical, pointing to Disney's midnight 
opening of "Dick Tracy" as a desperate act to give the movie the kind of cachet 
that sent "Batman" on to box office glory last summer. The Batman logo and 
T-shirt went on to become the Kitsch of the Year in 1989; the biggest question 
hanging over "Dick Tracy" is whether a generation of kids will take to the 
comic book detective the way they took the more enduring figure of Batman. 
</P>
<P>
The Disney official, who asked not to be identified, said the studio is happy 
with the T-shirt promotion and denied that a new ad campaign -- beginning 
Friday, theater chain listings will be topped by a one-inch ad promoting the 
T-shirt sales -- is a result of weak Memorial Day sales. 
</P>
<P>
According to the bid letter that went out to exhibitors, the studio asked that 
every theater whose normal admission price is $5 or more to charge at least $12 
for the midnight screening shirt. The theaters will reimburse Disney $6 for 
each shirt sold, plus 50% of the difference between $6 and the sales price of 
the shirt -- which would still mean that the theaters would keep a larger 
percentage of the box office gross for this particular screening than is 
customary. 
</P>
<P>
The Disney spokesman said the promotion was conceived a month ago as "a unique 
way of launching the picture. It's a response to our feeling about the movie . 
. . (but) it's just one small element of the whole marketing plan."

CZECH DOCUMENTARY TO SCREEN AT USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There will be a free public screening today at 4 p.m. of the Czech 
feature-length documentary, "Pictures of the Old World," by Dusan Hanak, at 
USC's Norris Auditorium. Acclaimed at its recent AFI Fest screening, this 
portrait of indomitable, elderly villagers, living in virtually medieval 
conditions yet somehow preserving their humor, energy and optimism, was made in 
1973 but not released until 1989.

HOME TECH / VIDEO: MAIL-ORDER SALES TARGET SPECIAL NICHES IN A GROWING MARKET; 
</P>
<P>
SHOPPING: CATALOGUES, CLUBS AND ADS CATER TO PEOPLE IN OUT-OF-THE-WAY LOCATIONS 
OR THOSE SEEKING NON-THEATRICAL SUBJECTS.

<P>
The great appeal of home video has always been that you can watch your favorite 
films in the comfort of your own home. Many enthusiasts have discovered that 
they don't even have to leave home to get the cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
They secure them through the mail, making selections from catalogues, video 
clubs or ads. 
</P>
<P>
Ira Mayer, editor and publisher of Entertainment Marketing Letter, reports that 
the home-video mail-order business is projected to gross $540 million this 
year, up from $450 million last year. By 1995, he predicts, it will be a 
$1-billion business. 
</P>
<P>
To put the mail-order business in perspective, Mayer said that it constitutes 
15% of the $3.6-billion home-video wholesale market. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers resort to the mail-order business (which is mostly sales rather than 
rental) for one of three reasons: convenience, necessity or downright 
desperation. 
</P>
<P>
Many people simply want to avoid the hassle of shopping for videos. Others live 
in out-of-the-way places and don't have access to well-stocked stores. And some 
are seeking hard-to-find movies and programs -- those that are either old, not 
in great demand or discontinued by the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to popular opinion, ordering by mail doesn't mean paying more than the 
normal retail price for the cassette itself. There is, however, an extra charge 
for shipping. For example, Ed Weiss, general manager of Movies Unlimited, a 
Philadelphia-based mail-order firm, said that his company charges $4 for 
mailing costs on any size order. 
</P>
<P>
Mail-order companies, Weiss added, basically operate like video stores -- 
buying titles wholesale from video companies and making profit on retail 
markup. Unlike video retailers, though, many mail-order companies have huge 
advertising costs -- including direct-mail solicitation and newspaper and 
magazine ads. 
</P>
<P>
"In the mail-order business, you have to spend money to advertise to let people 
know you're available," said Bob Mack, spokesman for the rent-by-mail company 
Home Film Festival. "With our company, you have to rent through a catalogue. 
Getting customers to find out about our catalogue -- through ads or whatever -- 
costs us money." 
</P>
<P>
Video clubs, which operate like record and book clubs, account for at least 60% 
of the mail-order business, Mayer said. "These clubs deal mainly in hit 
movies," he said. "A lot of their business is done with convenience buyers and 
people who don't have easy access to stores." 
</P>
<P>
Non-theatrical videos are especially dependent on the mail-order business, 
because video stores fill most of their shelf space with movies. Indeed, 27% of 
the sales of non-theatrical videos came through mail-order last year, according 
to industry analyst Dick Kelly of Cambridge Associates, and he predicts that 
the figure will jump to 31% this year. 
</P>
<P>
So if someone wants a cassette on grooming a horse or planting azaleas, he may 
have to resort to a mail-order catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
Special Interest Video has more than 900 titles and is reportedly the largest 
such catalogue available, but it doesn't begin to accommodate all the 
non-theatrical titles on the market. According to Special Interest Video 
president Claire Gruppo, there are about 20,000 non-theatrical titles in 
existence. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps for companies putting out these non-theatrical titles to get them 
into mail-order catalogues," Gruppo said. "For some of the real obscure titles, 
that's the only outlet they have. But obviously there aren't enough catalogues 
to handle all those titles." 
</P>
<P>
One of the few rent-by-mail firms, Pennsylvania-based Home Film Festival is 
also well-known as a source for hard-to-find videos. But this company 
specializes in foreign films, which make up more than half of its 1,200-title 
catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
What to do if you're looking for videos on a particular subject and can't find 
them in stores? 
</P>
<P>
"All these special-interest areas have magazines geared to people who share 
that interest," Mayer explained. "Just find a magazine on boating or 
stamp-collecting or whatever it is, and the ad section in the back will have 
some ads for some mail-order company that stocks videos dealing with that 
special interest."

TED SCHMITT: THEATER IN L.A. LOSES A FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ted Schmitt was a great sidewalk schmoozer. 
</P>
<P>
The lobby at Schmitt's Cast Theatre was tiny. So Schmitt, who died Thursday 
from AIDS-related complications, would preside over the sidewalk on opening 
nights, greeting theatergoers, introducing playwrights to patrons, exchanging 
information and opinions about what was happening in other theaters around 
town, talking about life and Hollywood and raising children and, to reporters, 
constantly pressing for more coverage of Los Angeles theater. 
</P>
<P>
People would park their cars on side streets near the Cast, in one of the 
town's seedier neighborhoods, and warily look over their shoulder as they 
walked to the theater. But at the first glimpse of Schmitt, his tall frame, red 
hair and florid face looming over most of the crowd, fear would dissipate. He 
was a beacon of vitality. 
</P>
<P>
Schmitt seemed so fearless. He had radically changed course in the mid-stream 
of his life. A former executive at VSI Corp. and a three-piece suit member of 
the Chamber of Commerce, he turned his back on all that. Having made such a 
great leap, it appeared that nothing could get him down for long. 
</P>
<P>
His theater, his car, his belongings might have looked shabby, especially when 
compared with the giant movie studio just down the block, where a different 
breed of producer routinely packages multimillion dollar deals for the silver 
screen, separated from the forlorn neighborhood by high walls and security 
guards. But Schmitt gave every indication of thriving on being the scrappy 
underdog, the producer who created the conditions for human-scaled art, in the 
middle of the Hollywood monster. 
</P>
<P>
And his efforts were remarkably successful. The Cast became one of the three or 
four busiest and most enterprising theaters, of any size, in Los Angeles. It 
remains a theater that's difficult to ignore. Even though Schmitt and his staff 
had little to do with some of the rental productions that came into the Cast, 
any show that played there automatically achieved a level of interest and 
credibility that could be matched at very few of the other theaters in town -- 
because everyone knew that Ted Schmitt would be there on that sidewalk, 
watching over his theater and the people who worked there. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first signs that something was amiss was at the opening of "Night 
Owls" last year. Schmitt was missing from his post -- and this was the second 
play of an important writer, Suzanne Lummis, whose work Schmitt had introduced. 
Soon after that came the news of his illness, with those frightening letters -- 
HIV -- attached to the diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
During the last months, Schmitt, who was 50, hung in there. Though his voice 
often sounded wracked with pain, he still called reporters with news tips, 
still kept up with what was going on around town by reading, if not by being 
there. 
</P>
<P>
But that sidewalk just won't be the same without him.

ABC TO CHANGE FORMULA USED IN PRICING ADS; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: WITH RATINGS DECLINING, THE NETWORK IS APPARENTLY TRYING TO SAVE 
ADVERTISING REVENUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABC Television Network said Thursday it plans to change the formula it uses to 
guarantee advertisers a certain number of viewers -- an effort that could save 
the network tens of millions of dollars next year. 
</P>
<P>
The change appears to be designed to protect ABC against ad revenue lost 
because of a sharp drop in the number of people watching TV. 
</P>
<P>
ABC presented the plan to sponsors for the first time Thursday, and the network 
said it was too soon to gauge reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Viewing levels for all types of TV have dropped significantly the past three 
months despite continued growth in the number of homes with televisions and 
wider choices from cable-delivered channels. A. C. Nielsen Co., the national 
ratings company whose daily reports determine how billions of TV advertising 
dollars are spent each year, has been unable to explain the reason for the 
precipitous decline. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen ratings show television viewing off 8.1% in the daytime and 2.2% in 
prime time. Viewing of network evening newscasts has dropped as much as 14%. 
"These recent developments have raised serious questions regarding the 
reliability" of Nielsen data, ABC said in a statement to advertisers. The 
network said it will therefore "institute a new basis for its audience 
assurances." 
</P>
<P>
ABC's decision to change the way it guarantees audience levels comes as the 
three networks are making plans to sell their advertising time for the upcoming 
year. During the late spring, the networks collectively sell more than $4 
billion in prime-time advertising at discounted rates. That represents about 
two-thirds of their commercial time. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining one-third of commercial time is sold at premium rates throughout 
the rest of the year. In recent years, the networks have pulled in more than $9 
billion in total prime-time advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, ABC has guaranteed a specific number of viewers for the audience 
that the advertiser wants to reach. If the rating was not achieved, ABC would 
give the advertiser a "make-good" -- bonus spots representing the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
Advertisers typically do not buy individual programs but a "package" of shows 
targeted at a specific audience. For example, an advertiser might want to reach 
40% of women between 18 and 49 who watch television. The network will present a 
plan for achieving that goal by packaging several prime-time programs and 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new system proposed by ABC, the network would no longer give away 
bonus commercial time equivalent to the shortfall. Instead, it has devised a 
formula that will compare the audience to an average over the past three years, 
then base "make-goods" on that difference. 
</P>
<P>
For example, under the current system, if ABC guaranteed a 20 rating and 
actually delivered 15, the advertiser would be owed 5 rating points. Under the 
new system, ABC would compare the 15 rating with past season ratings of 18 and 
16, which would translate to an average of about 16.5. Under the change, ABC 
would owe the advertiser 3.5 rating points rather than 5. 
</P>
<P>
The new formula should reduce the size of under-delivery, saving the network 
tens of millions of dollars in advertising that it would have had to give away 
in bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
CBS and NBC are also looking at new formulas to guarantee audience levels but 
have not yet announced plans. Such moves by the three networks, plus the new 
fourth network, Fox Broadcasting Co., could eventually involve hundreds of 
millions of dollars in advertising expenditures the coming season.

PATHE ARRANGES LOANS FOR BULK OF MGM/UA BUYOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The $1.2-billion acquisition of MGM/UA Communications Corp. by Pathe 
Communications Co. remained on course Thursday, despite rumors to the contrary, 
as new terms were spelled out in lengthy documents filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA revealed that Pathe will finance part of the buyout with an unsecured 
$450-million loan from one if its subsidiaries, Comfinance S.A. of Luxembourg. 
It also disclosed that Time Warner Inc. will directly loan Pathe $650 million 
toward the purchase, with the United Artists film library as collateral. Time 
Warner previously agreed only to guarantee a loan. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA also left open the possibility that majority owner Kirk Kerkorian will 
retain some interest in the company. The deal is supposed to close by next 
Thursday, though MGM/UA reserved the right to extend the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns about the purchase surfaced earlier this week when a story spread that 
a Time Warner board member was stirring opposition to the deal. According to 
published reports, the board member -- whose name was not revealed -- objected 
to Time Warner's involvement with Pathe co-President Giancarlo Parretti, who is 
appealing a "fraudulent bankruptcy" conviction handed down by a Naples court. 
</P>
<P>
A Pathe spokesman denied the reports, and Thursday's announcement of the 
amended purchase plan appeared at least partially designed to offset concerns 
that the deal was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like they're probably going to get it done now," said Jeffrey 
Logsdon, an entertainment industry analyst with the brokerage Crowell, Weedon 
&amp; Co. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The MGM/UA filing indicates that Pathe's financing for the $20-a-share deal 
remains somewhat mysterious, however. Comfinance, a holding company, will issue 
Pathe a one-year, $450-million loan that is funded through "working capital and 
available financing," but the documents do not explain where Comfinance will 
acquire the money. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe has the option of paying off the loan at any time within the year and may 
do so with shares of common stock. It may also repay the loan through the sale 
of unnamed assets. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner spokeswoman Marilyn Harris said executives were not available for 
comment on the revised plan. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner initially agreed to arrange for the loan on Pathe's behalf in 
return for distribution rights to the United Artists film library and future 
MGM/UA and Pathe releases. Under the new plan, the Time Warner loan will be 
made directly to Pathe, and secured by a note for the loan's amount and certain 
assets, such as the Pathe and Cannon Group film libraries. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner is also expected to retain the same film distribution rights. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, MGM/UA's amended filing revealed the sources of money used by Pathe in 
its non-refundable $150-million down payment. According to MGM/UA, $71 million 
came from Pathe's "available cash" and $79 million was "advanced by the 
(company's) European interests."

Tough Standards Urged for Federal Enterprises: Concerned about avoiding a fate 
similar to the nation's thrifts, the Treasury recommended that 
government-chartered enterprises, such as the Federal National Mortgage Assn., 
build loan-loss reserves and qualify for top credit ratings. Agencies included 
in the recommendation were the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., the Federal 
Home Loan Bank System and Farm Credit Banks.

FACTORY ORDERS DECREASE 2.3% DURING APRIL

Weak demand for autos and aircraft pulled orders to factories down 2.3% in 
April, leaving orders for the year 2% below last year, the Commerce Department 
said Thursday in a report showing further evidence of a slow manufacturing 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, it shows the manufacturing sector is still dead in the water," said 
Evelina Tainer, senior domestic economist with the First National Bank of 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just not going anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said orders to factories for durable and non-durable 
manufactured goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $235.6 billion. That followed 
gains of 4% in March and 1.8% in February. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the gains, the April decline and a 5.5% drop in January means factory 
orders have fallen 2% in the year's first four months. The department said 
orders have been relatively flat since the beginning of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Factory orders are an important barometer of manufacturing industry plans for 
production.

of their $156 million in loans to Mexico. The writeoff is significantly larger 
than the 35% planned under the debt-reduction scheme drawn up by U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. Mexican Finance Minister Pedro Aspe said he was

L.A. JUDGE DISMISSES SUIT OVER SHILEY HEART VALVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has dismissed a consumer group's lawsuit 
seeking to force Irvine-based Shiley Inc. to notify persons who have received 
Shiley heart valves about potential defects. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Ronald M. Sohigian on Wednesday accepted the company's argument that 
Congress has given the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authority that 
supersedes the state's in the area of medical devices. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Capretz, attorney for the Public Citizen Health Research Group, a 
Washington-based organization founded by Ralph Nader, said the group will 
appeal the decision in the state courts. Capretz contends that a state court 
can make a decision about how Shiley heart valve recipients should be notified 
because the FDA has not taken any action in this area. 
</P>
<P>
Capretz also said Public Citizen will petition the FDA to require warnings to 
be sent directly to more than 85,000 people who received implants of certain 
Convexo-Concave heart valves made by Shiley, which is a subsidiary of Pfizer 
Inc. The valves have not been used since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Since the first of two Shiley valves that are the center of controversy went on 
the market in 1979, the company has reported a total of 389 failures resulting 
in 272 deaths.

REPORTS OF COUGAR ATTACKS RISE SHARPLY SINCE 1970;

Half of all fatal mountain lion attacks reported in the United States and 
Canada during the last century have occurred in the past 20 years, and reports 
of nonfatal attacks have increased during that time as well, according to 
figures compiled by an Orange County-based researcher. 
</P>
<P>
The findings, contained in the quarterly report prepared by Paul Beier, project 
leader of the Orange County Cooperative Mountain Lion Study, are the results of 
what is thought to be the first attempt to document fatal and nonfatal cougar 
attacks in the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
"Attacks on humans appear to have increased markedly during the last two 
decades, during which mountain lion density and recreational use of wilderness 
areas have also increased," Beier wrote in the report. 
</P>
<P>
Five fatal attacks, killing a total of six people, occurred between 1890 and 
1970, Beier said. Three of the five fatal attacks since 1970 occurred in 
British Columbia (in 1971, 1976 and 1988), one was in New Mexico (1974) and one 
occurred last year in Montana, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of 37 documented nonfatal attacks, 23 occurred since 1970, Beier said, 
cautioning that some nonfatal attacks decades ago probably went unreported or 
unrecorded. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty sure I got all the fatals," said Beier, who has been culling old 
newspaper clippings and wildlife department files from states and provinces 
across North America. "I'm sure I missed some of the (older) nonfatals, though. 
. . . They might not have gotten into the news back then." 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, many of the recent reports of attacks were in British Columbia and 
particularly on Vancouver Island, where half of all mountain lion attacks have 
occurred, Beier said. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain lion hunting is permitted in the western Canadian province, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In California, where cougar hunting has been banned since 1972, the number of 
attacks is too small to suggest a trend, Beier said. 
</P>
<P>
The only fatal attacks documented in California occurred in 1890, when a small 
boy outside his home in Siskiyou County was reportedly killed and fed upon by a 
pair of pumas, and in 1909, when two children and a woman were attacked in a 
stream in Santa Clara County. All three people suffered only minor injuries, 
but the woman and one child died of rabies attributed to the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The only other attacks reported in California occurred in 1986 in Orange 
County's Ronald W. Caspers Wilderness Park, where two small children were badly 
mauled in separate incidents but survived. 
</P>
<P>
Those attacks, along with an increase in reported cougar sightings, prompted 
the county and state to commission a study of the mountain lion population in 
the Santa Ana Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the project team is monitoring the movements of eight female lions 
and one male. 
</P>
<P>
Californians will vote Tuesday on an initiative that would ban mountain lion 
hunting and mandate the expenditure of at least $30 million per year for 
wildlife habitat acquisition. Opponents of the measure say that there are too 
many lions in the state and that hunting could help control local populations; 
proponents claim that the animals control their own numbers and that increased 
reports of cougar sightings in recent years are the result of human incursion 
into cougar territory. 
</P>
<P>
The latest quarterly report also says that two of every three lions tested 
statewide showed evidence of having carried plague bacteria. Statewide, 23 of 
36 pumas tested positive for plague-bacteria antibodies, while two of three 
Orange County lions showed the same result. 
</P>
<P>
Beier said he was "kind of startled" by the news that cougars carried plague. 
But he said state health officials told him that it is "extremely common" for 
carnivores to contract the bacteria, and that the lions show no signs of 
actually having the disease. 
</P>
<P>
As for humans contracting the disease from lions, Beier said there would be 
"lots more to worry about" if they came in close contact with the animals. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County vector ecologist Rudy Geck said the lions could have picked up 
the bacteria by eating rodents, ground squirrels or other common 
plague-carriers anywhere in their vast range, but he has found no signs of 
plague-infested animals in any of the county's backcountry parks.

SOVIET LEADER LAUDS SCHULLER SERMON; 
</P>
<P>
LUNCHEON: GORBACHEV SAYS THE GARDEN GROVE PASTOR'S RELIGIOUS BROADCAST LAST 
SUNDAY HAD A 'CALMING INFLUENCE' ON HIS NATION.

The pastor of Garden Grove's Crystal Cathedral was sitting in the Soviet 
Embassy's formal dining room Thursday with 50 other famous Americans, straining 
to hear Mikhail Gorbachev's translated luncheon speech, when his companion 
nudged him in the arm. 
</P>
<P>
"You're coming up next," said Gennady Gerasimov, spokesman for the Soviet 
Foreign Ministry, who was seated next to the Rev. Robert H. Schuller. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, the television minister recalled, Gorbachev pointed out Schuller 
to the crowd and offered his assessment of Schuller's second religious 
broadcast to the Soviet Union, aired last Sunday. According to Gerasimov's 
translation, Schuller said, Gorbachev concluded that Schuller's talk had had a 
"calming influence" on his nation. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart gave a little bumph, bumph," said Schuller, the white-haired preacher 
who presides over the "Hour of Power," the most-watched religious television 
program in the United States, according to the latest Arbitron ratings. 
</P>
<P>
And that was only the middle of a day that Schuller, 63, later described as 
"the highlight of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Schuller was in Washington to take a ringside seat at the welcoming ceremonies 
for Gorbachev, the president of the Soviet Union, and to attend the luncheon 
and a reception for Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, at the Library of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview at day's end, Schuller insisted that Gerasimov's impromptu 
warning was the first notice he had that Gorbachev would mention him by name. 
But, never at a loss for words, Schuller quickly recovered and followed the 
likes of Henry Kissinger, Jesse Jackson and John Kenneth Galbraith to 
microphones that had been set up in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Using a Russian translation fashioned on the fly by Gerasimov, Schuller quoted 
from the title of one of his own books and told Gorbachev: "Tough times never 
last, but tough people do." Then he added, "God loves you, and so do I." 
</P>
<P>
Schuller is scheduled to begin monthly religious broadcasts on Soviet 
television in late September. He already has appeared twice: once last 
Christmas, and again last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Schuller's "Hour of Power" has some 1.8 million viewers. Schuller recently made 
a public appeal for $3.2 million in viewer donations and warned that without 
it, the "Hour of Power" may be forced off the air in several major markets 
because of the skyrocketing cost of commercial air time. 
</P>
<P>
The broadcasts to the Soviet Union were arranged with the assistance of a 
longtime Schuller friend, Armand Hammer, Schuller aides said. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer, the chairman of Occidental Petroleum, has had a relationship with 
Soviet leaders since he met Vladimir Lenin nearly 70 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
What about the longstanding conservative assessment that Communists are 
"godless"? 
</P>
<P>
"I've come to understand now that many people who are Communists, or were 
Communists, are not godless people," Schuller said. "To join those two words 
without qualification . . . has been a very irresponsible thing."

JUVENILE HALL RESTRAINTS TRIAL ENDING; 
</P>
<P>
YOUTH RIGHTS: PLAINTIFFS' LAWYERS CHARGED THAT YOUTHS WERE TIED TO BEDS UNDER A 
"SIEGE MENTALITY" AT THE HALL. THE JUDGE SAID SHE WOULD RULE IN TWO WEEKS.

<P>
Lawyers in a class-action suit over Juvenile Hall conditions argued in court 
Thursday that a county policy of tying youths to their beds during emergency 
confrontations is a product of the operators' "siege mentality" and should be 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the staff making exaggerated demands for submission to authority," said 
Mark I. Soler, the lead attorney representing past and present Juvenile Hall 
inmates. "They are not trained to realize they are only escalating the 
tension." 
</P>
<P>
The elimination of the tie-down policy and so-called "rubber rooms" for problem 
youths at Juvenile Hall have been the two main issues before Superior Court 
Judge Linda H. McLaughlin during the five-week, non-jury trial, which is 
winding down. 
</P>
<P>
County Chief Probation Officer Michael A. Schumacher announced during the 
proceedings that Juvenile Hall officials had decided on their own to replace 
the standard 10-foot cloth restraints with padded, leather handcuffs such as 
those used by the California Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
The inmates' lawyers, who had argued that the cloth strips tightened and cut 
off circulation, hailed the decision but said it wasn't enough. Under the 
present policy, Schumacher's staff is still allowed to tie a youth to his or 
her bed. 
</P>
<P>
Soler, of the Youth Law Center, and lawyers from the American Civil Liberties 
Union want no tie-downs. But if the judge decides to permit them, the 
plaintiffs want tie-down orders to come only from medical or mental health 
personnel -- not Juvenile Hall duty officers as the policy now allows. 
</P>
<P>
"The only real difference is, instead of tying the kids to their beds, now they 
chain them," said ACLU attorney Dick Herman outside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge McLaughlin repeatedly questioned both sides during closing arguments 
Thursday. And she pointed out to Soler that emergencies do occur. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you propose to address the clear emergency?" the judge asked, noting 
that there was some evidence presented at the trial that simply placing leather 
handcuffs on a youth causing a disturbance might not be adequate. 
</P>
<P>
Soler answered that it was acceptable to physically restrain a youth. But if 
tie-downs are permitted, he said, it should come only on a temporary order from 
a nurse until a doctor can be consulted. 
</P>
<P>
"What we object to is tying the youth to a fixed object (such as a bed)," Soler 
said, adding: "The damage comes from the psychological trauma of being tied 
down like that." 
</P>
<P>
The county's attorney in the lawsuit, David G. Epstein, argued that the 
physical damage that an out-of-control youth can cause should be weighed 
against whatever physical or psychological damage might result from being tied 
down. 
</P>
<P>
But the judge virtually reprimanded him when he argued that the evidence showed 
that the physical injuries from the sheet tie-downs amounted to no more than 
discoloration of a youth's wrists. 
</P>
<P>
"I should hope NOT!" the judge cut in. She added that discoloration alone was 
enough to make it disturbing, particularly in testimony that one youth's wrists 
had actually turned black. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because some didn't get gangrene or a limb cut off doesn't mean that it's 
not serious," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
But Epstein argued that in rare cases, the tie-down was the only method that 
could control a youth. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want these decisions made lightly," Epstein said. "But when all else 
fails, we need to have this resource available." 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the rubber rooms -- empty padded cells -- the plaintiffs want them 
eliminated. But short of elimination, they want them used only on orders from 
mental health personnel. Currently, a shift operator can order a youth placed 
in a rubber room. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU initiated the lawsuit three years ago, claiming a variety of offenses 
at Juvenile Hall. Basically, Soler argued to the court Thursday, the staff has 
maintained an attitude of demanding obedience from youths detained there. 
</P>
<P>
"Our clients are not angels, nor are they monsters," Soler said. "They are 
children who are quite troubled. When they feel like they have been treated 
unfairly, they are going to fight back, even when they know they can't win." 
</P>
<P>
Schumacher has defended the Juvenile Hall's operation, calling it a "first-rate 
facility."

KRAUSE, EGGERS LEAD IN RAISING FUNDS

<P>
Mayor Eileen Krause has raised the most money of the seven candidates seeking 
three City Council seats in Tuesday's election, but Councilman Michael Eggers 
has spent the most money, according to financial statements. 
</P>
<P>
Krause, one of three incumbents in the city's first council race since 
incorporating last year, has raised $20,572 and spent $11,281. Nearly $14,500 
of that has been raised in the last three months, her statement showed. 
</P>
<P>
Eggers, an aide to Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), has collected the second 
highest total, raising $20,159 and spending $13,132. Only $2,760.99 of that 
came this year, however, with the remainder having been raised in the summer of 
1989, Eggers said. 
</P>
<P>
Fund raising by Krause and Eggers has far outpaced the third incumbent, Ingrid 
McGuire, who has raised $10,696 and spent $5,573. She has raised $4,084 in the 
last three months, documents show. 
</P>
<P>
Challenger Karen Lloreda, a Capistrano Beach homemaker, has raised $7,750 and 
spent $7,788. The statements show that Lloreda raised $7,010 of her funds in 
the last three months, nearly all of it from Capistrano Beach residents. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Kaufman, a businessman who is also chairman of the city's Planning 
Commission, has raised $3,978 and spent $3,593. Kaufman has raised $2,678 in 
the last three months. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas B. Moy, an instructor for the California Department of Corrections, and 
William L. Petersen, an optometrist, have both spent less than $1,000. Moy has 
vowed not to take any donations of more than $250. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Dana Point has no limit on campaign contributions, although by 
state law single contributors can donate no more than $1,000 in a fiscal year, 
City Clerk Mary Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates were required to submit financial disclosure statements by May 
24 to Carlson. The documents cover a time period ending May 19, Carlson said. 
The candidates must file another campaign disclosure statement by July 31. LEN

PROP. 111 BACKERS LIST WORST STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supporters of Proposition 111, a transportation improvement initiative, held a 
press conference Thursday at the intersection of one of Santa Ana's most 
pothole-ridden streets to illustrate what they say is a severe lack of money 
for proper road maintenance in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Passage of the proposition Tuesday would raise a total of $18.5 billion over 
the next 10 years for road maintenance by creating a 9-cents-per-gallon 
gasoline tax increase to be phased in over four years, said Manuel Puentes, 
transportation engineer of the Automobile Club of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Puentes revealed what he said are considered the worst streets in the county. 
Besides the stretch of Grand Avenue between Edinger and Warner avenues, other 
streets listed as priority projects include portions of Ball Road, Katella 
Avenue, Brookhurst Street, Euclid Street, Fairview Road, MacArthur Boulevard, 
El Camino Real, Marguerite Parkway, Crown Valley Parkway and Irvine Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"There just aren't enough existing funds to meet maintenance requirements," 
said William Zaun, director of public works for the county. "In many cases, 
it's more than 20 years before a road gets any kind of attention. . . . It's 
much more cost-effective to maintain a street on a routine basis rather than 
waiting until a street falls apart." GREG HERNANDEZ

FRATERNITY TO 'ADOPT' PORTION OF ROUTE 73 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A fraternity at UC Irvine today will become the first organization in Orange 
County to "adopt" a highway under a new program initiated by the California 
Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the state's Adopt-a-Highway program, Pi Kappa Phi has agreed to 
adopt the portion of Route 73 between Bonita Canyon Drive to San Miguel in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The fraternity has dedicated two years to keeping the roadway free of litter 
and maintaining its beauty by planting bushes, trees and wild flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Fraternity president Jim Rundle said his organization was prompted to adopt the 
highway by similar programs by fraternities in Texas and in keeping with the 
policy of its national organization to participate in community activities. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a new fraternity on campus," Rundle said. "We thought this would be a 
good opportunity to help the community and to better the image of our 
fraternity." 
</P>
<P>
A ceremony recognizing the group will be held at 11 a.m. today at the Caltrans 
Irvine Maintenance Station, at 19919 1/2 MacArthur Blvd., Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Groups participating in the Adopt-a-Highway program must meet safety 
requirements by providing workers with hard hats and red vests and agreeing not 
to work during harsh weather or on major holiday weekends, said Ralph Carhart, 
statewide coordinator of the project. 
</P>
<P>
"We allow any business or organization, profit or nonprofit, to participate," 
he said, noting that church groups, civic organizations and other community 
groups typically participate in the program. Carhart said that statewide, more 
than 130 groups have adopted highways in their area. 
</P>
<P>
Initiated in 1989, the program seeks to reduce the cost of maintaining 
California roadways by getting businesses, groups and individuals involved in 
maintaining the state's freeways and highways. ROBERT PIERRE

SLAYER OF SUSPECT WON'T BE CHARGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors have decided not to press charges against a 29-year-old Anaheim man 
who fatally shot a suspected car burglar while waiting for police to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Dean Dunn told investigators that he tried to hold Tony M. Martinez, 20, 
of Santa Ana and another suspected burglar at gunpoint in his car until police 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
But he fired a shot when Martinez got out of the car, threatened him and began 
walking toward him. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez was pronounced dead of a single gunshot wound to the head outside an 
apartment complex at 900 S. Park Circle, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrick H. Donahue said Thursday that he concluded that Dunn 
acted in self-defense because of Martinez's threats. 
</P>
<P>
"They were definitely threatening words," Donahue said. "They were threatening 
to his life." 
</P>
<P>
Murder charges will not be filed against the second burglary suspect, Martin 
Rodriguez Valdez, 23, of Santa Ana, but he has been charged with felony auto 
burglary.

SCHOOL SUPT. SAYS FOE'S LOAN ILLEGAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County Supt. of Schools Robert Peterson on Thursday accused one of his 
opponents, John F. Dean, of illegally accepting a $20,000 loan from his 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
Dean, 63, a Whittier College professor, accepted the loan from his father, 
James H. Dean of Cucamonga, on April 24, according to campaign financial 
disclosure forms released by Peterson at a press conference in the Santa Ana 
Hall of Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The loan was $19,000 above the legal limit of $1,000 per fiscal year on 
campaign contributions from individuals, corporations and partnerships under 
Proposition 73. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a candidate here that hasn't complied with the law and far exceeded 
what the limits are," said Peterson, 69, who is seeking an unprecedented 
seventh four-year term in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said that officials of his reelection campaign committee have notified 
the state Fair Political Practices Commission of the alleged violation, but 
added that he does not expect the commission to rule on Dean's finances in time 
for the election. 
</P>
<P>
Dean, reached at his Newport Beach home, said that members of his campaign 
committee found the law to be unclear on contributions from relatives and 
accepted the loan. But when told of the FPPC's general conclusions on loans to 
campaign committees, Dean conceded that "it was a loan I should not have 
accepted." 
</P>
<P>
"We checked with a couple of people who ought to know (about the finance laws) 
and they didn't know," Dean said. "We didn't give it a second thought. If have 
to turn around and return the check, I will." 
</P>
<P>
FPPC spokeswoman Sandra Michioku would not comment on Peterson's allegation, 
but said that Proposition 73 limits contributions to campaign committees from 
all sources except from a candidate's personal funds. 
</P>
<P>
"All other contributions, and all other contributions include loans, would be 
subject to Proposition 73 restrictions," Michioku said. 
</P>
<P>
Dean said he was unsure if any of the $20,000 loan had been used to finance 
campaign-related activities. His campaign treasurer, Ann L. Krueger, could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson also charged that Dean surpassed campaign finance limits by $500 in 
accepting $1,500 worth of bumper stickers from Weber Nameplate, a Santa Ana 
firm. Dean, however, said a clerk typed in an incorrect figure and that an 
amended disclosure form will show that less than $1,000 in bumper stickers was 
donated. Henry Weber, president of Weber Nameplate, was not available to 
confirm Dean's account. 
</P>
<P>
Dean said he does not believe the allegations will harm his effort to unseat 
Peterson. "I think people will be accepting of a mistake like this," he said. 
"There's more at stake in this election than a mistake of this kind." TONY

<P>
Ronald G. Bennett, an assistant superintendent for the Fullerton School 
District, will leave this month to take over as superintendent of the growing 
Yucaipa Joint Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Yucaipa school board members chose Bennett from among 85 applicants, board 
president Jan Mishodek said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very sincere and shows a real compassion for children," she said. "That's 
important in a school district such as ours." 
</P>
<P>
The Yucaipa school district, which straddles the border between San Bernardino 
and Riverside counties east of Redlands, has a growing number of minority 
students who have special educational needs, she said. Bennett, 47, impressed 
board members with his commitment to providing a good education for all 
students, she said. 
</P>
<P>
As superintendent, Bennett will oversee a staff of about 550 and an annual 
budget of about $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing Bennett in his Fullerton post will be Ronald Cooper, who is the 
district's assistant superintendent for personnel services. Cooper's position 
has yet to be filled. TOM McQUEENEY

<P>
For the second year in a row, Anaheim-based Olive Crest Treatment Centers, 
which runs 28 group homes for children and troubled teen-agers, was named as 
one of six organizations nationwide to receive a Washington Charity Award. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Charity Awards Dinner, to be held in July, was started in 1980 
under President Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
The tradition has continued over the years, with six to eight charities honored 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
Olive Crest has homes in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
Lois Verleur, who with her husband, Donald, established the organization in 
1973, said the treatment centers will try to use the award to increase 
corporate contributions from $8 million this year to $10 million next. 
</P>
<P>
"That's tied into our dream of opening a home for 'drug babies' in South 
County," Lois Verleur said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Olive Crest's budget comes from government funds, mainly Aid to 
Dependent Children, because most of the children it helps are wards of the 
court. However, Verleur said, the government aid has not kept in step with the 
increased cost and the children's needs.

The Washington Charity Awards Dinner will also honor Mercy Corps International, 
a relief agency; Easter Seals, for children with disabilities; Students of Free 
Enterprise, a free market education program; Mothers Against Drunk Driving and 
the Make-A-Wish Foundation, for children with life-threatening illnesses. MARY

REPORT URGES BROADER USE OF SEIZED DRUG ASSETS; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: COUNTY OFFICIALS SUGGEST SETTLING AN ARGUMENT WITH SHERIFF 
BRAD GATES BY USING FUNDS FOR PROJECTS OTHER THAN NARCOTICS SUPPRESSION.

<P>
After months of bickering with Sheriff Brad Gates over the proper use of money 
and property seized in drug raids, county officials conclude in a new report 
that the funds should be used for a broad array of law enforcement activities. 
</P>
<P>
That recommendation, part of a 14-page report that will be presented to the 
County Board of Supervisors next week, directly contradicts Gates' position 
that the funds should only go toward fighting drugs. Officials say the report, 
which has taken six months to research, may finally settle a point of 
contention that has long strained relations between the board and the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, several board members have long complained that Gates misled 
them into believing that under federal law, seized drug assets could only be 
used for narcotics suppression. Supervisor Thomas F. Riley and other county 
officials said Thursday that Gates has helped cultivate that impression in his 
communications to the board and the county administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if there was malice in that or not, but it left some confusion, 
and that created some bad feelings," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
The report, which examined federal laws and surveyed California cities and 
counties, brusquely dismisses Gates' argument. 
</P>
<P>
"It has also been suggested that the Federal Forfeiture Guidelines do not allow 
for the use of these funds for other than narcotic-related activities," states 
the report, written by officials in the county's management and budget 
division. "Obviously this is not the case, since the survey clearly gave an 
indication that law enforcement agencies have and do use these funds for 
general law enforcement purposes." 
</P>
<P>
In April, Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez met with U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh 
and other top Justice Department officials, and, he said, they indicated the 
same thing to him. 
</P>
<P>
According to Vasquez and Barry Stern, an associate deputy attorney general who 
met with him during the supervisor's Washington visit, the funds can be used 
for a variety of law enforcement purposes, including jail construction. Orange 
County is under a court order to expand its jail facilities to relieve 
overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
"The Federal Forfeiture Guidelines also suggest that general law enforcement 
purposes, including jail construction, are acceptable uses of the forfeiture 
funds," according to the county report. 
</P>
<P>
Local regulations do in some cases limit the use of seized drug assets, 
specifying that they only go toward drug enforcement. Those regulations can be 
changed by the board, however, and the report recommends that the supervisors 
amend them accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen California cities and 10 counties were surveyed in preparing the 
report, and many of them use their seized drug assets for purposes other than 
narcotics enforcement. In some cases, funds were used to supplement jail 
construction budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Gates was unavailable for comment Thursday, but he has previously said he 
opposes using seized drug assets to help finance a new jail. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried to give special focus to the war on drugs, and that's what we feel 
is the most appropriate use of the money," Gates said in an April interview. "I 
think the people of this county want us to focus on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Undersheriff Raul Ramos reiterated that position Thursday, saying that while 
Gates was willing to spend forfeiture money on non-narcotics activities, the 
department believes general law enforcement expenditures should be held to a 
minimum. "Drugs are the No. 1 problem in this county, and that's what the money 
is for," Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
Although careful not to criticize the sheriff's accounting of seized drug 
assets, the report also recommends that board members direct the sheriff to 
supply them with regular reports on those funds, a move that county officials 
argue would help with long-range planning. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the report argues that the supervisors should direct Gates to repay 
$500,000 that was loaned in 1987 to the Regional Narcotics Suppression Program. 
That money, the report said, should now be used to defray expenses on a 
proposed forensic sciences building. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos said he believes that that would be an appropriate use of those funds. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their differences, Gates and the supervisors agree on another point. 
Both say money from seized drug assets should not be used for operating 
expenses since revenue from seizures cannot be predicted from year to year. The 
report suggests, as Gates has previously, that seized assets be used on 
one-time capital and equipment needs. 
</P>
<P>
Riley and other officials said Sheriff's Department officials have been sent 
copies of the report and are reviewing it. Its findings enjoy strong support 
among the supervisors, he added, saying that he expects it to be easily 
approved when it comes before the board next week. 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Don R. Roth agreed but also said he expects to hear from Gates 
before the vote. "No doubt the sheriff will have something to say about it," 
Roth said, "but I haven't heard about it yet."

Comments: The Cowboys gained the College World Series berth by defeating 
Arizona State, 17-9 and 10-5, in the regional at Tempe, Ariz. Pitching has 
carried Oklahoma State, which has three starters with contrasting styles. 
Dennis Burbank, a junior right-hander from Valencia High School who has a 9-1 
record and 3.18 ERA, is a finesse pitcher who throws a lot of breaking balls 
and off-speed pitches. Senior right-hander Gordie Tipton, who is 9-1 with a 
2.45 ERA, is a side-arm pitcher who relies on a slider and changeup, and 
freshman right-hander Brad Gore, who is 4-2 with a 4.37 ERA, is a power 
pitcher. The Cowboys, making their eighth trip to Omaha in the past 10 years,

Perez (.390), Michael Daniel (.360, 20 home runs, 82 RBIs), Bobby Carlsen

deciding game. First baseman Tommy Raffo leads the team with a .364 average, 13

Comments: The Titans, making their sixth College World Series appearance, won 
national championships in 1979 and 1984. Pitching and defense carried Fullerton 
in the regional, where the Titans beat host Texas twice, 5-2 and 3-0. Sophomore 
right-hander James Popoff, who won the opening playoff game against Old 
Dominion, pitched a complete-game, four-hitter against Texas in the 
championship game. Senior right-hander Sam Colarusso won the first game over 
Texas, and junior left-hander Huck Flener went the distance on an eight-hitter 
to defeat Creighton. Led by second baseman Mate Borgogno and shortstop Kevin

percentage. Left-fielder Rich Gonzales leads the team with a .383 average, five

Arizona State sophomore outfielder Mike Kelly was selected Thursday as Player 
of the Year by Baseball America magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, a 6-foot-4, 195-pound graduate of Los Alamitos High School, hit .376 
with 21 homers and 82 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike Kelly may be as good a player as any who has come out of Arizona State, 
and they have had some terrific players through the years," said Allan Simpson, 
Baseball America's editor. "I have no doubt that if he were eligible this year, 
he'd be the No. 1 selection in the (major league player) draft." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, however, said he was in no rush to become a professional. "I am enjoying 
myself," he said. "I'm having the best time of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly has been compared with Cincinnati star Eric Davis and former Arizona 
State greats such as Reggie Jackson, Rick Monday and Barry Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tremendous honor having people think that highly of me," Kelly said. "I 
really don't try to copy them. . . . I just try to play my own game." 
</P>
<P>
In a news release announcing Kelly's selection, Arizona State Coach Jim Brock 
said: "College baseball rarely has a complete player, one who is the very best 
in every area. Mike Kelly is the closest I've seen to that in a long time. He's 
the best I've ever had, and he's the best I ever hope to have." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly also was named to the All-District 8 first team Thursday. Cal State 
Fullerton second baseman Mate Borgogno and UC Irvine pitcher Ken Whitworth were 
second-team selections.

UCI'S MORALES QUALIFIES SECOND IN HAMMER THROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine's Mike Morales, who taught himself to throw the hammer after he 
arrived at Irvine, had the second best hammer throw of the day in preliminary 
competition Thursday at the NCAA track and field championships at Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Morales' throw of 211 feet was surpassed only by a throw of 217-5 by Oregon's 
Scott McGee. Twelve athletes qualified for the final, scheduled for Saturday at 
Duke's Wallace Wade Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Morales' top throw this season is 216-6, an Irvine school record and the third 
farthest throw in Division I this season before the NCAA championships. 
</P>
<P>
Morales, a senior from Garden Grove High School, was an All-American last 
season when he finished seventh in the hammer throw at the NCAA championships, 
becoming Irvine's first All-American in a field event. He won the Big West 
Conference championship in the shot put this season. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's Buffy Rabbitt failed to qualify for the 1,500-meter final, finishing 
15th in a field of 18 in 4:20.48. Rabbitt was leading her heat until the final 
200 meters, when the field passed her. Tennessee's Jasmin Jones was the top 
qualifier for Saturday's 12-woman final with a time of 4:14.62. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbitt, a junior from Newport Harbor High, won the Big West championship in 
the 1,500 and had a best time this season of 4:19.52. She was an All-American 
as a sophomore in 1988 after finishing seventh in the 1,500 meters at the NCAA 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
She redshirted last season while studying in France.

SOUTHERN SECTION 4-A SOFTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP;

<P>
SHE'S MAKING HER PITCH FOR A TITLE

<P>
There's little doubt that Garden Grove High School pitcher Stephanie Smith 
knows how to win. Just ask her opponents, who are hitting .077 against her. 
</P>
<P>
Or you can ask Garden Grove Coach Paula Cervantes, who says Smith is the best 
all-around athlete she has coached. 
</P>
<P>
Or ask her future college coach, who will be among those in attendance when 
Garden Grove plays Charter Oak in the Southern Section 4-A championship game at 
8 Friday night at Mayfair Park in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
"She has good velocity and excellent movement but most importantly she's a 
winner," said Ken Johnson, softball coach at the University of New Mexico, 
where Smith will play next season. "The bigger the ballgame, the less pressure 
she has on her shoulders, the more excited she gets and the more confidence she 
has in herself. She knows how to win. 
</P>
<P>
"We plan on her coming in and pitching for us right away," Johnson said. "We 
were ranked 18th in the nation this year. We played one of the toughest 
schedules around and we think she is ready to come in and pitch for us right 
away. We think she's ready to handle that kind of situation." 
</P>
<P>
If her statistics are any indication, Smith is at least ready to handle a more 
difficult situation than she had this season. With Smith figuring in every 
decision, the Argonauts racked up a 25-4-1 record on their way to the division 
final. 
</P>
<P>
"She's probably the best all-around athlete I've coached," Cervantes said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith has received the most recognition for one statistic in particular. She 
leads Orange County in strikeouts with 314. 
</P>
<P>
Said Cervantes: "She has a good collection of pitches. She moves the ball 
around." 
</P>
<P>
That collection includes a fastball, changeup, rise-ball, drop-ball, and a 
curve. Smith says she has no best pitch and uses all of her arsenal equally 
well. 
</P>
<P>
On five occasions this season, she moved the ball around well enough to come 
away with no-hitters, two of which were perfect games. 
</P>
<P>
But the strikeout pitcher may have a tougher time against Charter Oak. The 
Chargers' Kathi Evans will go into the final with a .700 on-base percentage and 
Charter Oak power-hitter Kelly Hunt has struck out only four times in four 
years of varsity softball. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said she's not worried. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody can be struck out once," she said. "And if not, I'll get them to pop 
up or ground out." 
</P>
<P>
Smith is even less concerned about the pressure of having her future college 
coaches on hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited because they're coming out," Smith said. "I know they're confident 
in me because they signed me." 
</P>

MINOR REPORT SWINGS LOTS OF WEIGHT IN BOND MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its endless search for the most up-to-date signpost on the economy's 
direction, the bond market has alighted on a minor regional report that has 
sent markets reeling upon release. 
</P>
<P>
The report, by the Purchasing Management Assn. of Chicago, provides a snapshot 
of local business conditions in the month just ended and has the distinction of 
arriving before all others. 
</P>
<P>
In the first indication of the economy's performance in May, the Chicago group 
said Thursday that its index rose to 56% from 54.2% in April. A reading above 
50% points to an expanding economy. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the regional nature of the report, bond traders took it as a sign that 
the economy was picking up, easing the pressure for lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury bonds fell on the news, with the benchmark 30-year U.S. bond down 
about a fifth of a point. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department on Thursday released a factory orders report showing a 
downturn in the manufacturing economy, but the data was for April -- ancient 
history as far as the financial markets are concerned. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the Chicago report, economists said, is that it provides the first 
indication of manufacturing activity for the month just ended. 
</P>
<P>
The index reflects conditions of about 200 industrial businesses in Northern 
Illinois and Northwest Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
It is "one measure of what is going on right now and comes out early, which is 
very, very good," said Samuel Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities Inc. in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The nearly 50-year-old report gained international stature last year when its 
monthly release date was fixed ahead of a similar but unrelated national 
survey, prepared by the National Assn. of Purchasing Management. 
</P>
<P>
The National group's index will be released Friday, the same day as the Labor 
Department releases the influential U.S. employment report for May. 
</P>
<P>
Some economists say the Chicago report has had an uncanny ability to call the 
most recent shifts in the economy's direction. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing data between 1970 and 1987, John Hoagland, a professor of management 
at Michigan State University, found that the Chicago data predicted a shift in 
the economy's direction sooner than comparable government figures. 
</P>
<P>
But many economists caution against reading too much into the data. The 
report's sample size is comparatively small and does not contain the detail of 
related U.S. economic reports.

FLUOR GAINS SOLE OWNERSHIP OF LEAD PRODUCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fluor Corp. said Thursday that it completed purchase of the remaining 42.5% 
interest in the Doe Run Co. for $125 million, making it sole owner of North 
America's largest lead-producing firm. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor previously announced its intention to buy out the interest of San 
Francisco-based Homestake Mining Co., its partner in lead mining and smelting 
since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Doe Run, based in St. Louis, supplies about 60% of the lead marketed in the 
United States.

KEATING'S $5-MILLION DEFENSE FUND IS NEARING DEPLETION, LAWYER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by James S. Granelli, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beleaguered businessman Charles H. Keating Jr. and executives in his Phoenix 
company will probably exhaust their $5-million defense fund by the end of July 
and risk losing legal representation in a slew of court cases stemming from the 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan scandal, one of his lawyers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Reliance Insurance Co., which has been paying the legal fees of 10 law firms, 
has notified directors and officers of Lincoln's former parent, American 
Continental Corp., that its obligation to pay defense costs and any judgment 
will end when the $5-million limit is reached, said James I. Ham, a Los Angeles 
lawyer for Keating. 
</P>
<P>
In state and federal lawsuits, American Continental bondholders and regulators 
accuse Keating and other company executives of fraud and racketeering in their 
operation of the company and the Irvine-based thrift. The Resolution Trust 
Corp., the government agency running the now-insolvent Lincoln, is seeking $1.1 
billion in its lawsuit. Cleaning up Lincoln is expected to cost taxpayers $2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance money is crucial to Keating's defense. Without it, his lawyers would 
seek court permission to withdraw from the cases, Ham said. But Reliance says 
it won't pay any more, and two other carriers are balking at picking up the 
defense tab. 
</P>
<P>
Ham filed suit Thursday against financially troubled H.S. Weavers, a London 
insurance syndicate, seeking $500,000 in damages -- essentially the amount due 
his firm. Weavers insures American Continental's directors and officers with a 
$2-million policy. 
</P>
<P>
Both Reliance and Weavers issued what are called self-consuming policies. That 
means that the policy limits can be consumed by legal fees. Arizona court 
decisions have refused to enforce such policies, saying they are against public 
policy, Ham said. He said he soon will seek a court order requiring Reliance to 
pay more than $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
A third insurance firm, National Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh, was 
ordered recently to start defending the Keating group, but it has asked a 
federal judge in Los Angeles on June 25 to allow it to appeal his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"The insurance litigation is diverting attention from other cases," Ham said. 
"But they are critical to Keating's ability to have his day in court."

AIDS-RELATED FILM TO DEBUT IN O.C.

<TEXT>
<P>
A feature film about a heterosexual doctor who re-examines his life after he 
tests positive for AIDS -- filmed in Orange County, financed by an Orange 
County doctor and directed by a graduate of Orange Coast College -- will, 
fittingly enough, have its premiere in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The producers of "A Different Life" are still looking for a distributor, but in 
the meantime they have booked the film into the Valley View Twin Cinemas in 
Garden Grove for a one-week run, today through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"A Different Life" is based on a story by physician Jay Amin about "a 
heterosexual doctor who panics when he tests positive for AIDS." But as it 
turns out, the test results were faulty. Amin, who has practices in Santa Ana 
and Tustin, is also the movie's executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
The film stars John Mansfield in the lead role, along with such film and TV 
veterans as Karen Black, Lyle Waggoner and Burt Ward. "A Different Life" marks 
the directing debut of Orange Coast College graduate Kent Blakely. 
</P>
<P>
Show times for the film are 5:30, 7:30 and 9:15 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday will 
add matinees at 11:30 a.m., 1:30 and 3:30 p.m. The Theater is at 12111 Valley 
View St., Garden Grove. Information: (800) 397-1476.

CRUISING IN STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, Kathryn Bold is a regular contributor to Orange County Life.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Summertime, and the clothing is easy. 
</P>
<P>
No sharp edges, no constricting collars. 
</P>
<P>
Clothes to wear when you're relaxing on the deck of a cruise ship, dining at a 
posh resort or sitting at a beach-side bar nursing drinks with little paper 
umbrellas. 
</P>
<P>
Resort wear designers have their customers' comfort in mind. For men and women, 
they've chosen soft knits and washable silks that won't emerge a rumpled mess 
from the suitcase. 
</P>
<P>
Oversized shirts fall loosely from the shoulders. Shorts and pants have 
comfortable drawstring or elastic waistbands that appeal to those who spend the 
better part of their summer vacation eating. 
</P>
<P>
As another cheery send-off, designers have chosen fabrics in bright solids and 
bold tropical prints. Even if the weather's dreary on your island paradise, 
your clothes won't be. 
</P>
<P>
Designers recognize that vacationers seek an escape from their rigid, 9-to-5 
lives, and that carries over into clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of a crisp, white shirt, men want to wear something soft," says 
Caroline Stubbs, men's clothing designer for Fenn, Wright &amp; Manson in New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
She created a line of loose-fitting shirts in washable silk, a fabric softer 
than a chamois but less shiny than unwashed silk. 
</P>
<P>
"The washed silk stops it from looking like a real Italian shirt," she says. 
"The shirts are very oversized and not tailored, so they have a wonderful 
feel." 
</P>
<P>
They also travel well. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't crease and they don't take up any room at all in your suitcase," 
Stubbs says. 
</P>
<P>
One shirt features a tropical hibiscus print in rich chartreuse, purple and 
turquoise hues for $85. It can be worn with knee-length chartreuse linen shorts 
for $60, both at I. Magnin in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Other pieces in her collection, such as cotton-knit shorts, drawstring pants 
and T-shirts, are easy to pack and wear. 
</P>
<P>
Stubbs finds that men have become more attracted to bold prints and colors, so 
she's added bright, warm tones to her palette. Her linen shorts, for instance, 
come in raspberry, purple and teal as well as the traditional navy. Another 
silk shirt has an ethnic-style medallion print in orange and gold or olive, 
khaki and lime green. It's available for $95 at I. Magnin in Fashion Island, 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The carefree days of summer inspire designers of women's wear to cut loose. 
Several, including Andrea Jovine, James Tarantino and Geary Roark, had fun 
creating bright, sexy dresses that draw attention to tanned bodies with short 
hemlines, bare shoulders and exposed backs. 
</P>
<P>
"Summer to me is fun and sexy," says Roark, the Los Angeles-based designer for 
Kamisato. 
</P>
<P>
"I did a lot of polka dots, a lot of solids and brights. But whether it's a 
print or a pattern, everything is crisp and clean." 
</P>
<P>
He created colorful dresses with simple lines and unusual back details -- 
straps that crisscross the shoulders, or cutouts that expose a patch of skin. 
Some have long, full skirts; others have narrow, fitted skirts that hit just 
above the knee. 
</P>
<P>
One red and white polka dot number has a full skirt that billows out from a 
fitted bodice with a bare back, available for $119 at I. Magnin. A similar 
dress comes in navy with gold embroidery bordering a V-neck and metal studs 
dotting a fitted bodice with a diamond-shaped back, for $195. 
</P>
<P>
For travelers, a practical alternative to the dress is city shorts. Many 
designers came out with their own version of these easy ensembles, pairing 
tailored shorts with a long, loose jacket or a short, fitted one. 
</P>
<P>
Roark has found a strong audience for his light-hearted designs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to stick with these fun things through fall," he says. "I'm becoming 
consistently less serious." 
</P>
<P>
Other designers have had fun playing with fabrics. Their experiments have 
yielded clothes that can go anyplace. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Glasser, owner of Compagnie in Los Angeles, delights in wrinkling, 
embroidering, sand-washing and dyeing fabric to give it a new look. 
</P>
<P>
One of his most successful designs is a long, full skirt made of crinkled white 
silk, available for $90 at Cignal in MainPlace, Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened by accident," he says. "I tried the skirt on a model and I liked 
it better wrinkled. They thought I was crazy." His customers, however, love the 
filmy skirts. 
</P>
<P>
"I take the skirts, rewash them, tie them in knots and dry them. They kind of 
cling to the body, but they still leave a lot to the imagination," he says. "I 
don't do sexy clothes that show a lot of skin, but they do have an attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Glasser enjoys manipulating material. Denim is stripped of its color, dyed 
unusual hues such as celery green or pink, then sand-washed so it comes out 
soft. He uses the fabric to make baggy jeans. 
</P>

Caltrans' division of aeronautics has established guidelines to control the 
amount of noise generated over residential areas by aircraft using the state's 
airports. Under those guidelines, any area exposed to an average Community 
Noise Equivalent Level of more than 65 in a year is 
</P>
<P>
considered to be noise-impacted. 
</P>
<P>
To comply with those regulations, John Wayne Airport has set up 10 stations at 
locations in Newport Beach, Santa Ana, Tustin and Irvine to monitor noise 
levels. Some stations are on private property and others on public land, at the 
following locations: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MONITOR STATIONS 
</P>
<P>
M-1: 2139 Anniversary Lane, Newport Beach 
</P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
M-4: 1352 Reynolds Ave., Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
M-5: 17952 Beneta Way, Tustin 
</P>
<P>
M-6 &amp; M7: No longer in use 
</P>
<P>
M-8: 1131 Back Bay Drive, Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
M-9: 1300 S. Grand Ave., Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
M-10: Golf Course, 3100 Irvine Ave., Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
M-11: 20152 S.W. Birch St., Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
M-14: 17372 Eastman St., Irvine (began monitoring November, 1989) 
</P>
<P>
The stations monitor the noise levels on a daily basis. The average daily 
levels, which are also averaged for each month, are "the result of a computer 
analysis based on county-provided data including flight tracks, actual traffic 
</P>
<P>
counts, average SENELs (Single Event Noise Exposure Levels) by aircraft model 
and recorded CNEL values for each monitor station," according to the quarterly 
report from the airport's noise abatement office.

BANK OF CHINA OPENS IN HONG KONG SKYSCRAPER

<TEXT>
<P>
The Beijing-owned Bank of China has opened for business in Hong Kong in a 
70-story prism-shaped skyscraper that dominates the city's skyline and that has 
sparked superstitious worries among residents. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,289-foot-tall skyscraper was designed by Chinese-American architect I.M. 
Pei and is the tallest building in the British colony, which is due to be 
handed back to the communist mainland in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
But the building's four right-angled triangular prisms, placed together to form 
a long, thin square column topped by twin antennas, have been condemned by many 
of the territory's superstitious residents. 
</P>
<P>
Scholars of Fung Shui -- the study of wind and water -- have said the 
building's prism design is a sure sign of bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
The sharp edges on the interlocking triangles that make up the sides of the 
building have been likened to daggers. The twin antennas that top the tower 
have been compared to empty chopsticks.

GREENWALD SAYS HE'S SURE UAL BUYOUT CAN FLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The newly named leader of the proposed union buyout of UAL Corp. said Thursday 
he agreed to give up his post as Chrysler Corp.'s No. 2 executive only because 
his analysis persuaded him that the takeover of United Airlines' parent could 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference here, former Chrysler Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald said 
he had conducted "my own sort of due diligence" analysis of the proposed 
$4.38-billion deal, including phone calls and visits to principals in the 
proposed leveraged buyout. 
</P>
<P>
Now, "I'm absolutely convinced that the financing can be done and will be 
done," said Greenwald, 54, who had been been widely expected to succeed 
Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca when Iacocca retires. He said late Wednesday 
that he would leave Chrysler to lead the effort to buy UAL. 
</P>
<P>
Many outsiders believe that the choice of Greenwald, an experienced 
administrator and financier, will help the buyout effort, and United's stock 
jumped $4.625 to $155.50 in New York Stock Exchange trading Thursday. However, 
that remains significantly below the unions' offer of $201 a share. 
</P>
<P>
And even the most enthusiastic analysts believe that formidable obstacles 
remain to the financing of the deal, which the UAL board has said must be 
completed by Aug. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald was flanked at the press conference by officials of the machinists', 
airline pilots' and flight attendants' unions, which chose him for the post 
after considering a list of executives. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald ducked all questions about the compensation contract he has signed. 
</P>
<P>
Of UAL's present management team, he said, only Chairman Stephen M. Wolf will 
have to go, Greenwald said. It is understood that if the buyout succeeds, 
Greenwald would become chairman of the UAL board and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that his own lack of airline experience is a negative factor 
but said he brought a number of strengths to the job. Greenwald said he has 
long experience with organized labor and was involved in a huge and difficult 
financing during the early 1980s in the Chrysler bailout negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
He was first approached by the unions only 10 days ago and said he had hardly 
begun work on the next and critical phase of the effort -- lining up bank 
lenders to finance the buyout. He is expected to soon begin showing major U.S. 
banks UAL's cash-flow and growth projections. If he wins the support of the 
domestic banks, he is expected to seek financing from Japanese and European 
lenders as well. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald, who has recently earned $1.1 million a year at Chrysler, insisted 
that he had not taken the UAL buyout job for the compensation or because he 
feared that Chrysler's prospects were poor or that he would not succeed 
Iacocca. 
</P>
<P>
He said Iacocca had told him about a year ago that the top job would "be mine 
unless I really screwed up. . . . He said, 'It's yours to lose.' " 
</P>
<P>
The executive said he took the UAL buyout job only after he was assured that 
the union's ownership of the airline would not interfere with management's goal 
of making it profitable. The unions "will be investors but not managers," 
Greenwald said. UAL "will be run like any other company . . . for profits and 
cash flow," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald has gotten mixed reviews from union leaders during his tenure at 
Chrysler, but the three union officials at Thursday's news conference said 
their members were delighted to hear the news that an executive of such stature 
had joined the effort.

HIGH LIFE / A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
ENLIGHTENED VIEWS OF TEENS WHO WEAR BLACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE CHEN, Anne Chen is a junior at Capistrano Valley High School, where she 
is a reporter for Paw Prints, the student newspaper. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some high school teen-agers make themselves more visible than others. And the 
ones who look truly different often bring about misunderstandings. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the fate of teen-agers who dress in black. 
</P>
<P>
Do they call themselves mods or death rockers? Punkers or devil worshipers? Or 
are they just teen-agers with a limited fashion sense? 
</P>
<P>
"Aren't they called gloomies?" wonders one teacher at Capistrano Valley High 
School in Mission Viejo. "That's what all the kids call them." 
</P>
<P>
But they call themselves nonconformists. 
</P>
<P>
These are teen-agers with pasty-white faces who often wear black eye-liner and 
purple lipstick. They are adorned with enough silver to set off any airport 
sensor. 
</P>
<P>
But nonconformists? Well, sure, they dress differently from their classmates, 
but they all dress the same. 
</P>
<P>
"Wearing black is just a trend," explained Andy Boswell, a junior at Capistrano 
Valley. "I dress this way because I enjoy it, not to be different. Besides, 
it's easy to match." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Hoberg, who is also a junior at Capistrano Valley, said: "I'm just being 
myself. I don't always wear black. I wore blue and yellow to school today." 
</P>
<P>
Julie Mai, another junior, put it in psychological terms: "Black is a dominant 
color. I suppose a lot of people who can't be dominant like to wear black. But 
I honestly think it's just a preference." 
</P>
<P>
The opinions these all-black dressers draw are as varied as their reasons for 
adopting the look. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a right to express themselves as long as they don't involve 
themselves in anything that harms the school," said Jennifer Kercher, a junior 
at Capistrano Valley. "I don't even think about it (all-black style)." 
</P>
<P>
"They just dress differently," said Justin Chan, another junior. "As far as I'm 
concerned, they're pretty cool people. Some of them are abstract, but they're 
actually very nice." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's kind of neat," said Beth Gibb, a Capo Valley German teacher. 
"High school is a time for you to figure out who you are and what you want to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
"As you get older, you have to make career choices. Many careers require a 
certain look; it's (all-black dressing) just not acceptable. Now and in college 
is the only times to experiment and to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
Dressing the way these teens do does attract attention, desired or not. 
</P>
<P>
"It is true that we attract more attention from police and other 
authority-types of people. We get questioned," said Mai, who added that her 
friends actually had food thrown at them in the mall. 
</P>
<P>
Paul said police arrived at her friend's birthday party and asked, "Is this a 
costume party?" 
</P>
<P>
"Cops snicker a little and do that quite a bit," Ortega said. "They say, 
'Halloween ended several months ago.' 
</P>
<P>
"Cops are especially harsh and rude and think I'm a hard person by the way I 
dress. And if you do say something (in reply), it's considered a defiance of 
authority." 
</P>
<P>
Said Boswell: "Police assume we're troublemakers by the way we dress. Once, I 
got pulled over by a cop and he thought I was drunk. He asked me, 'What are 
you? A punk?' " 
</P>
<P>
Mai said her attire has caused people to raise such questions as "Are you going 
to a funeral?" She said she receives these comments from people she doesn't 
know and who don't understand her. 
</P>
<P>
"I get things like that every day," Hoberg said. "It doesn't bother me." 
</P>
<P>
Said Boswell: "A lot of people hate me and they don't even know me. They think 
I'm a 'fag,' a Nazi or a depressionist . . . but I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
"Just anywhere, basically," Mai said. 
</P>
<P>
So just what do their parents think about their children's all-black fashion 
statement? 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say they like it very much," Mai said, "but they've adjusted." 
</P>
<P>
"They worry about so much black," Ortega said. "They see it meaning depression. 
They are worried about how others see me and form opinions. They get upset 
quite a lot." 
</P>
<P>
On the lighter side, Boswell said, "my dad thinks it's funny." 
</P>
<P>
As for their style being associated with drug use, Ortega said, "It's not a 
group thing. People view it that way. They associated it with us and assume 
everyone is a drug user. If anyone does it, it's not encouraged nor is it 
publicized." 
</P>
<P>
One former all-black dresser -- call him John -- left the clique when it 
affected his social life. 
</P>
<P>
"It had an effect on my family," John said. "I felt I was losing my other 
friends. I didn't get into everything they did. There's a lot of neat people, 
but all the makeup, the clothing and the foul language got to be too much for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
John considered his former friends somewhat confrontational. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them like the attention. They want people to say something," he said. 
"I just hate to see the girls all pasted up (with makeup). Some of them are 
really pretty without it. I just didn't like all the attention. It was much 
more of a costume, an act." 
</P>
<P>
So are the teen-agers in black conformists or nonconformists? 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't think of myself as a nonconformist," Boswell said. "I'm just 
another person." 
</P>
<P>
Offered Mai: "We're conforming to nonconformity, but we're people, too. We have 
feelings."

Communist North Korea, which counts the Soviet Union among its few allies, 
today warned Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the "serious political 
consequences" if he goes ahead and meets Monday with South Korean President Roh 
Tae Woo in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Gorbachev and Roh, arranged by the United States to follow 
Gorbachev's summit talks with President Bush, was seen as a major political 
setback for North Korea.

HIGH ISRAELI DOUBTS ARAFAT KNEW OF RAID 
</P>

<P>
Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat probably did not know 
beforehand about the seaborne raid by Palestinian guerrillas on Israel, the 
nation's military intelligence chief said in an interview published today. 
</P>
<P>
The comment by Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahak contradicted Foreign Ministry officials 
who claimed that Arafat met last week with the raid's mastermind, Mohammed 
Abbas, and almost certainly knew of the planned strike. 
</P>
<P>
Abbas, better known as Abul Abbas, leads the Palestine Liberation Front, a PLO 
faction that claimed responsibility for Wednesday's foiled attack. 
</P>
<P>
Libya has admitted to helping mount the strike, which was aimed at crowded 
Israeli beaches, and Shahak's comments in an interview with the Yediot Ahronot 
daily provided the most detailed account yet of that involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Four guerrillas were killed and 12 captured. No Israelis were harmed. 
</P>
<P>
Shahak also said Israel knew "with complete certainty" that the PLO has planned 
attacks on Soviet Jewish immigrants to Israel "in every possible location and 
at every opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
The statement was the first public comment by security officials about threats 
against Soviet immigrants. Israeli newspapers have quoted officials as saying 
Israel stepped up security because of expected guerrilla attacks on Soviet 
Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Shahak said Arafat probably didn't know about Abbas' plans to attack Israel. 
"We don't have information pointing to the fact that he knew ahead of time," 
Shahak said. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat said Thursday the PLO was not involved in the raid. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir called on Washington to abandon the dialogue it 
began with the PLO in December 1988 after Arafat renounced terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat avoided condemning the raid outright, and said he could not expel Abbas 
from the elected PLO Executive Committee for the attempted raid: "He was 
elected in a democratic way by the Palestine National Council, and only the 
council has a say on that." 
</P>
<P>
Abbas' faction said today in a statement issued by its office in Baghdad, Iraq, 
that it would continue its attacks. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Israel William Brown said today that Arafat's response was 
unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
"He has ... attempted to absolve the PLO from responsibility. Rest assured that 
we're going to continue to look at that very, very seriously," Brown said 
during a tour of the northern Israeli town of Migdal Haemek. 
</P>
<P>
Shahak said the guerrillas involved in the seaborne raid trained in a camp set 
aside for them by Libyan authorities on the Mediterranean coast.

Residents and witnesses said three funnel clouds didn't quite touch down but 
still caused $5.5 million in damage, while the Weather Service said one tornado 
did scour the surface. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported, but about 80% of the city was blacked out and phone 
service was spotty until this morning. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one that hit Spearman itself, and there were multiple tornadoes in 
the vicinity of Spearman for several hours last night," Steven Cooper of the 
National Weather Service office in Amarillo said today. "There were about three 
different storm systems. Two dropped tornadoes." 
</P>
<P>
The funnel clouds were "too numerous to count," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ten mobile homes and 10 houses were reported destroyed, while a church and a 
restaurant were heavily damaged. Mayor Burl Buchanan estimated that 5% of the 
town of 3,500 had property damage.

The government introduced legislation today that would repeal the Separate 
Amenities Act, a pillar of apartheid that has allowed racial segregation of all 
public amenities for nearly 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which would take effect Oct. 15, will be submitted to 
Parliament on Monday, where it is expected pass by mid-June, the South African 
Press Associated reported. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1953, the Separate Amenities Act has authorized provincial governments, 
municipalities and privately owned entertainment establishments to reserve 
facilities for whites. If the law is repealed, public bathrooms, libraries and 
transportation -- as well as privately owned restaurants and nightclubs -- 
could no longer be segregated.

Boris N. Yeltsin, the president of the Russian Federation, promised his 
Lithuanian counterpart today he will foster close ties between his huge 
republic and the secessionist Baltic region, Lithuanian sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's offer represents a slap in the face for Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, who ordered an economic blockade against Lithuania in an effort to 
force it to back off its March independence declaration. 
</P>
<P>
If Russia were to resume supplying Lithuania with gas, oil and other raw 
materials, it would mean the virtual end of the Kremlin's sanctions -- without 
Gorbachev's consent. 
</P>
<P>
But Yeltsin has not explicitly said he intends to provide such goods to 
Lithuania. Moreover, it is not clear whether his republic could gain practical 
authority to do so, even if it adopts an autonomy plan championed by Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who was elected president of the Russian republic Tuesday, met with 
Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis for "a very friendly talk with full 
mutual understanding," said Natasha Boganova, secretary of the Lithuanian 
representation in Moscow, where the two met. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeltsin is prepared, as soon as Russia gets its sovereignty, to cooperate 
fully with the Baltic republics, and Lithuania first of all," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania, struggling to circumvent the blockade, has been seeking direct ties 
with newly elected radical leaders in various parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has demanded that Lithuania suspend its declaration of independence 
before the blockade can be lifted and talks begun. Lithuanian lawmakers have 
offered compromise measures, but they refuse to suspend the declaration. 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis plans to meet with delegates from Moscow and Leningrad, where 
radicals have taken over the city administrations, and delegates from other 
parts of Russia, the Lithuanian Parliament's information service said. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has said he expects the Russian Parliament to declare the Russian 
Federation's sovereignty within the first 100 days of his term. 
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federation is the Soviet Union's largest republic, with two-thirds 
of its territory and just over half its population. 
</P>
<P>
Sovereignty would mean republic authorities would have the final say over which 
Soviet laws are valid on Russian territory, and greater independence in general 
from the national government.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Samuel Doe, hemmed in by an advancing rebel army, announced today he 
will not run for reelection, and he asked the United States and other nations 
to help end his nation's civil war. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. military officials said 2,100 Marines aboard four ships of the U.S. Navy's 
6th Fleet stood off the Liberian coast to protect property and lives of 
Americans and other foreign nationals and, if necessary, to evacuate people. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels, from the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, are seeking Doe's 
ouster. They accuse his administration of corruption, economic mismanagement 
and human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 people, most of them civilians slain by government troops, have 
been killed in six months of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel leader Charles Taylor told the British Broadcasting Corp. that his 
fighters would not stop until they had taken Monrovia, the capital, and formed 
their own government. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel troops already control the country's main port of Buchanan, 95 miles east 
of the capital, and were advancing on two fronts within 35 miles of Monrovia. 
Thousands of people have fled the city. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference today, Doe said: "I wish to announce here today my firm 
decision not to stand for the 1991 general elections." 
</P>
<P>
"Accordingly, I hereby appeal to our traditional friends, the United States 
government and other friendly countries, to bring to an end this 6-month-old, 
Libyan-backed incursion in order to pave the way for a peaceful, free and fair 
election in 1991," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The news conference also was attended by legislators who for months have tried 
to persuade Doe to not seek another term. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too little, too late," said one diplomat. "Six months ago, this might 
have helped." 
</P>
<P>
Doe said he had survived 35 or 36 coup attempts and would be happy to leave the 
"burden of leading a country . . . the political harassment" to somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
He seized power in a bloody 1980 coup that ousted elitist descendants of 
American slaves who discriminated against native Liberians. Liberia, a country 
of 2 million, was founded in 1847.

Nintendo Co. Ltd. said today it has filed suit against a rival toy maker, 
alleging the competitor infringed its copyrights with a device that allows even 
novices to master the popular Nintendo video games within minutes instead of 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Nintendo seeks to prevent Lewis Galoob Toys Inc., one of the nation's 10 
biggest toy makers, from bringing Game Genie to market. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's Nintendo, which has the lion's share of the fast-growing 
multibillion-dollar video games market, claims that when Galoob's Game Genie is 
connected to a Nintendo video game cartridge, essential features in the games 
are changed. 
</P>
<P>
"By substantially changing the play of our game, Galoob's product directly 
compromises the depth of play and challenge of Nintendo's games," Nintendo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed in federal court in San Francisco, where Galoob is 
headquartered.

China's central bank has ordered the nation's financial institutions to stop

Kyodo News Service reported today.

The agency quoted "international financial sources" as saying the People's Bank

Taiwan and also to punish Japanese banks for not providing loans over the last 
year.

Japan and Western governments suspended new official credits last June to 
protest a military crackdown on student-led protest, and most Japanese 
commercial banks have followed suit.

A spokesman for the Bank of Tokyo said it plans to go ahead with its operation 
in Taipei despite the criticism.

A report being prepared for the Pentagon will urge the government to tighten 
its watch on foreign takeovers of U.S. high-tech firms and perhaps provide help 
for companies critical to national security, industry officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said a panel of 15 experts from business, government and 
universities had tentatively approved the draft of a study this week 
encouraging specialized microchip and other U.S. industries to remain in 
American hands. 
</P>
<P>
The final report will be sent to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the study) notes that complete self-sufficiency in such areas as 
microchips is impractical today, but says we should make sure foreign 
restraints don't hamstring U.S. industry in critical areas," said one official. 
</P>
<P>
The officials confirmed today's New York Times report that the study is being 
prepared by the Defense Science Board Task Force on Foreign Ownership and 
Control on U.S. industry. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, headed by Apple Computer Corp. Vice President Deborah Coleman, 
recommended that the government as a last resort should try to save weak firms 
by helping U.S. mergers, providing refinancing or taking other steps before 
such firms are put on the international market.

Japan's current-account surplus shrank 70% in April, its sharpest drop since 
June, 1979, due in large part to a jump in costly imports that reflects the 
expensive tastes of its consumers, especially for artworks, economists said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's surplus in its unadjusted current account, the broadest measure of 
trade in goods and services, narrowed to $2 billion in April from $6.58 billion 
a year earlier and $8.13 billion in March, the Finance Ministry said.

SO, YOU MAY have read that Madonna got out of Toronto in the nick of time, 
beset as she was in her last performance there by the police "Morality Squad." 
(They called upon her to change her show as they'd had complaints that it was 
"obscene and lewd.") 
</P>
<P>
Madonna asked her Toronto audience: "Do you believe in freedom of expression?" 
(They howled, "Yes!") 
</P>
<P>
The star is now in Detroit, where she gets to say things like this: "I would 
rather have canceled the show than let anybody dictate how I can or can't 
express myself as an artist. This is certainly a cause for which I am willing 
to be arrested."

The Australian government moved Thursday to reduce the violence shown on 
television, particularly in news programs. 
</P>
<P>
Transport and Communications Minister Kim Beazley said he supports the 
recommendations in the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's report on television 
violence, which was brought up for discussion in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The key recommendation is that the television industry draw up a uniform code 
on how to treat violence. 
</P>
<P>
Although the emphasis is on "supervised self-regulation," Tribunal Chair 
Deirdre O'Connor said in a separate statement that if the code could not 
satisfy public concerns, "the Tribunal would be driven to consider a range of 
options which could include imposing program standards and license conditions." 
</P>
<P>
The report said there is widespread worry about the repetition of violent 
images, close-ups of blood and intrusion on grieving people.

REMBRANDT'S 'ST. PETER' FAILS TO GO AT AUCTION;

<P>
An early Rembrandt portrait of a repentant St. Peter failed to sell at 
Christie's Thursday, furthering art market worries of a slump. 
</P>
<P>
Bidding on "St. Peter Repentant," painted by the famed 17th Century artist in 
1631, stopped at $9.5 million, just short of the $10 to $15 million presale 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
"It clearly shows that the reserve was too high," said New York dealer Alan 
Salz of the seller's minimum acceptable price, which was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Rembrandt experts had expected the piece to go for as much as $20 million, 
following the recent sales of Van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" for $82.5 
million and Renoir's "Au Moulin de la Galette" for $78.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Salz said that the painting came up in London two years ago in the private 
market and struggled to sell before going to Miami real estate developer Joe 
Friedland. Salz "was under the impression that he (Friedland) paid more than 
$9.5 million two years ago," and that price was in the range of the Christie's 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
More than 40% of the 151 lots offered Thursday failed to sell, with only 87 
selling for a total of $8.1 million. Two weeks ago, contemporary and

REVIEW PLIGHT SNAGS MUSICAL IN WEB OF CONFLICT

To review or not to review. 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma has spun a web of controversy and conflict around "Kiss of the 
Spider Woman," the first offering of an ambitious, for-profit laboratory for 
new American musicals. 
</P>
<P>
A musical version of the film that won William Hurt an Oscar was reviewed today 
in The New York Times by its chief theater critic, Frank Rich, despite pleas by 
the organization presenting what it calls a workshop production. 
</P>
<P>
The organization, New Musicals, says it had sought a no-review policy from the 
media for its season of shows that began May 1 with "Spider Woman." The musical 
is being performed through June 24 at the State University of New York at 
Purchase, 25 miles north of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to create an alternative method of development to Broadway," Martin 
J. Bell, producing director of New Musicals, said Thursday. "If the Times 
policy stands, I would recommend to a writer or a director that they do a show 
right on Broadway instead of coming here. What they did was invade the work 
process here." 
</P>
<P>
A review by Rich usually can make or break a show on Broadway. New Musicals had 
hoped to keep The New York Times from reviewing the show, which is undergoing 
changes and rewrites during its two-month run in Purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Rich's review, largely negative, finds irony in what he describes as the overly 
elaborate, Broadway-style staging. 
</P>
<P>
Other New York critics were informed of the Times' decision to review the show, 
and several decided to do their own pieces before Rich's notice came out. 
</P>
<P>
Clive Barnes, theater critic of the New York Post, said the Times' review 
policy made it impossible for him to ignore the musical. He panned the show in 
Thursday's newspaper, but was even more scathing about The New York Times' 
policy for the show. 
</P>
<P>
A Daily News critic will review the show today and other critics, including 
those of Variety and The Associated Press, plan to review it soon. 
</P>
<P>
Interest in "Kiss of the Spider Woman" has been high since the project was 
announced in January. The musical involves some of Broadway's biggest talents. 
</P>
<P>
The show is directed by Harold Prince, director of "The Phantom of the Opera," 
and has a book by playwright Terrence McNally. The score was written by John 
Kander and Fred Ebb, the team behind "Cabaret" and "Zorba."

Ron Polk, head coach at Mississippi State, was named today by the United States 
Baseball Federation as head coach of the USA baseball team for the 1991 Pan 
American Games in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
The team of American players will try to earn a spot in the 1992 Olympics in 
Barcelona, Spain, by finishing as one of the top qualifiers in the Pan Am 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
USBF officials said it is expected that a team needs to finish in the top four 
of the Pan Am Games to earn a berth in the 1992 Olympics. Team USA did not earn 
an automatic spot despite its 1988 Olympic gold medal in the Seoul Games. 
</P>
<P>
Polk served as an assistant coach to Stanford Coach Mark Marquess on that 
Olympic team. Both coaches also qualified teams for the 1990 College World 
Series beginning today in Omaha.

George Steinbrenner's patience appears to be wearing thin as the New York 
Yankees continue to stumble, and Manager Bucky Dent could be one of the 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is more disappointed than I am," the team's owner told the New York 
Times after the Yankees returned from a 2-6 road trip. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been very patient with Bucky. I haven't said a harsh word; in fact, I've 
been very encouraging. But I can see what everybody else sees." 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported today that sources say Steinbrenner already is mulling major 
changes within the Yankees organization after a 17-27 start, their worst since 
1925. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, outfielder Mel Hall ripped his teammates for their lack of desire. 
</P>
<P>
"The intensity here stinks," Hall told the New York Daily News. "It's almost as 
if we don't have guts. We just have to have more heart. I don't see it here."

Andre Agassi clashed angrily with International Tennis Federation President 
Philippe Chatrier after sanctions were threatened today against players wearing 
colorful clothes at the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
A statement by Chatrier, head of the French Tennis Federation, said several 
members of the tournament organizing committee "have been very disturbed by the 
dress of Agassi, for example." 
</P>
<P>
Chatrier said the authorities were considering introducing new clothing 
regulations next year. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who has been wearing black denim shorts and pink tights throughout the 
first week of the tournament, retorted: "Chatrier, he's a bozo." 
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded Agassi, speaking to reporters after his third-round victory, 
said tennis authorities should get out from behind their desks and ask 
spectators if they enjoyed watching him play, rather than criticize him. 
</P>
<P>
"The way Chatrier is handling the situation is a perfect example of why the 
tennis players wanted to start their own tour," he said in a reference to the 
Assn. of Tennis Professionals tour, which began this year. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi said he was not concerned about missing the French Open in the future. 
"It would be one less tournament to play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As Agassi was speaking, the authorities reissued their statement and dropped 
all references to the 20-year-old American.

Dallas Mavericks forward Sam Perkins was injured in a car wreck Thursday night 
in the Dallas suburb of Addison. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins' car collided with another car in an intersection as Perkins was 
attempting to turn left at 9:32 p.m., police spokesman Brad Freis said. 
</P>
<P>
Both drivers were taken to hospitals, with Perkins, who wasn't wearing a seat 
belt, complaining of possible neck and lower leg injuries, Freis said. The 
other driver had a possible broken right wrist or forearm and neck injuries, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Alford, emergency room nurse at RHD Memorial Medical Center in Dallas, 
said Perkins was treated and released at 11:05 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of the injuries to the 6-9 1/2 forward was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
Both drivers said they had a green light, Freis said, and the officer at the 
scene was unable to determine who was at fault.

The Boston Celtics reportedly will talk with Duke University Coach Mike 
Krzyzewski about coaching the National Basketball Assn. team next season. 
</P>
<P>
Krzyzewski will meet next week with Dave Gavitt, the Celtics newly appointed 
chief operating officer, The Boston Globe today said it was told by 
unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston Herald today said Krzyzewski, a friend of Gavitt, has said he would 
be interested in the job if the Celtics approached him. 
</P>
<P>
The two already have had contact, Duke Athletic Director Tom Butters told the 
Globe. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about Krzyzewski, Gavitt said it is not fair to comment on 
individual candidates.

The Celtics fired head Coach Jimmy Rodgers right after the team was eliminated 
from the playoffs by the New York Knicks.

WITH 10 DRAFT PICKS, EXPOS HAVE CHANCE TO DOMINATE THE '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM VERDUCCI, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Expos were dejected and depleted last winter when Hubie Brooks, Mark 
Langston, Bryn Smith and Pascual Perez left the organization as free agents. 
They lost one of their leading run-producers and three starting pitchers and 
had nothing to show for it. That changes Monday, when the draft offers Montreal 
the chance to reload. The Expos hold 10 of the first 53 picks. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal has two picks in the first round (including one from the Angels, who 
signed Langston), four picks in a supplemental round immediately after the 
first round (one each for losing Langston, Brooks and Perez and one because 
they failed to sign their first-round pick from last year), and four more in 
the second round (their own pick plus one each for losing Brooks, Perez and 
Smith). 
</P>
<P>
"We have the chance to really do well," said Gary Hughes, Montreal's director 
of scouting. "Usually you only have two picks among the quality players in the 
first two rounds. Now we've got 10. There's a much better chance to be 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
Montreal, which has already signed and developed all of its starting eight 
except for shortstop Spike Owen, has a chance to become a dominant team for the 
1990s. But then, we've heard such talk before. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos drafted Ellis Valentine and Gary Carter in 1972 and took Bill 
Gullickson, Scott Sanderson and Tim Raines in 1977. Then, in 1979, they won 95 
games in what was the franchise's first winning season. They were expected to 
be the team of the '80s but won only one title in the decade, and that was in 
the fractured strike season, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Expos are coming off two straight .500 seasons and are considered such 
an unattractive franchise that although it is up for sale, no one is bidding 
for it. If nothing else, 10 of the first 53 picks of the draft give Montreal 
reason for optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we're going in the right direction," Hughes said. "What good has free 
agency done Kansas City or California, anyway? We haven't had much success in 
attracting or keeping free agents. But if we build a successful organization, 
people will want to stay and people will want to come." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, the team that could be hurt most by Montreal's abundance of picks 
is the New York Yankees. George Bradley, the Yankees' vice president of player 
personnel and development, explained that the Expos are likely to take players 
the Yankees covet. 
</P>
<P>
"Montreal scouts in basically the same way we do," Bradley said. "They're 
nearly identical to us. More so than any other club. That's why, after the 
first round at least, all of their picks are probably going to cost us some 
players. They're just like us in that they go for good athletes, younger 
players, they're not afraid to take chances and they may go for a kid who is 
regarded as tough to sign. We're very, very similar." 
</P>
<P>
A's may pick more winners -- Here is some bad news for all the teams who are 
trying to catch up with Oakland: The world champion Athletics, who built the 
core of their team through the draft, have seven of the first 66 selections 
Monday. Oakland obtained five extra picks as compensation for losing free 
agents Dave Parker, Storm Davis and Tony Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to lose those players, but this is the way the system works," 
said Dick Bogard, Oakland's director of scouting. "I love it. We know we're 
going to get some good players. Throughout the system, our biggest need is 
pitching. We're looking to address that in the draft." 
</P>
<P>
Glory is fleeting -- On Friday night, the Phillies reached first place for the 
first time since June 29, 1984. The Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia 
Daily News both played the story on Page One. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to get to .500 and then build on that," said Von Hayes, the 
only player left from that 1984 team. "Now that we're in first, it's the same 
principle. Little by little, we want to pick up some games and build on our 
lead." 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies lost the next night and dropped out of first place. They lost 
their next two games after that, too, to fall 2 1/2 games out. 
</P>
<P>
But give General Manager Lee Thomas credit for unloading three established 
Phillies -- Steve Bedrosian, Juan Samuel and Chris James -- within a 15-day 
span last June in order to get Charlie Hayes, Dennis Cook, Terry Mulholland, 
Roger McDowell, Lenny Dykstra, John Kruk and Randy Ready. All three of the 
deals look like steals. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies' pitching is still too inexperienced and inconsistent for this 
team to win the National League East. But it appears Philadelphia will be a 
factor in the race for the first time since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think teams can afford to say anymore, 'Oh, we're playing the 
Phillies' and count on wins," reliever McDowell said. "I don't see September as 
a time when we'll be playing out the string." 
</P>
<P>
Call them F Troop -- McDowell said of the Phillies' turnover: "We're just a 
bunch of misfits. This team is a co-op. We're like the Miami Marlins. We're 
just a group of guys who like to play baseball but didn't have the chance to 
play every day. Look around here. We've got guys from Houston, San Francisco, 
San Diego, Minnesota, the Mets. . . . It's a situation where we feel we can 
play a little bit, no matter what anybody else says." 
</P>
<P>
Said Leyva: "Yeah, we've got some castoffs. I call them F Troop."

STRIKIN JET, ON CASH FAVORED IN KINDERGARTEN

Harvey Wallbanger, the world's only racing buffalo, shares the marquee with the 
$230,000 Kindergarten Futurity on Saturday night's program at Los Alamitos Race 
Course. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Wallbanger will be featured in an exhibition race Saturday night with 
rider/trainer T. C. Thorstenson at the reins. 
</P>
<P>
Facing the racing buffalo will be two horses ridden by Danny Cardoza and James 
Lackey. 
</P>
<P>
The 36th running of the 350-yard Kindergarten Futurity goes as the 9th race 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Strikin Jet and Takin On The Cash are the two early favorites to capture 
the 1990 renewal of the Kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Strikin Jet and Bruce Pilkenton scored an upset in the Leo Handicap in 
April, posting a half-length margin over Femmes Flam. 
</P>
<P>
Takin On The Cash won the Bay Meadows Futurity decisively in mid-April with 
veteran rider Danny Cardoza in the irons. The horse has won two of four career 
starts, finishing second the remaining two. 
</P>
<P>
Femmes Flam is another talented contender. The daughter of Pie In The Sky has 
won three of her five career starts, including an impressive victory in the Bay 
Meadows Futurity Consolation. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most notable riding assignment in the Kindergarten is the decision 
by Baffert to put thoroughbred rider Gary Stevens on Raised Toperfection. 
Stevens also will ride Kite In The Sky in Saturday night's seventh race. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how they'll line up for the Kindergarten Futurity: Splitsville (Lute 
Proctor), Ramtac (Roman Figueroa), Femmes Flam (Steve Treasure), Cash N Cara 
(Alvin Brossette), Resolutions (Kip Didericksen), Ms Bush Whacker (John 
Creager), Takin On The Cash (Danny Cardoza), Miss Strikin Jet (Bruce 
Pilkenton), Jacks Special Gem (Eddie Garcia), Raised Toperfection (Gary 
Stevens).

FARLOW CHANGES PLACES SO HE CAN STAY IN ONE SPOT

<P>
What was a problem position for shortstop Kevin Farlow at USC has become a 
solve-all-problems position at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the main reason Fullerton has advanced to the College World Series, 
which begins today at Omaha, is that the Titans, who open against Oklahoma 
State Saturday, have cut their error total almost in half, from 125 in 1989 to 
66 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Five infielders had 89 errors last season, 29 of them by then-shortstop Mate 
Borgogno. But when the smooth-fielding Farlow transferred from USC last summer, 
it allowed Borgogno to move back to his natural position, second base, where he 
has flourished. 
</P>
<P>
Borgogno has made only nine errors in 295 chances for a .969 fielding 
percentage. Farlow has 14 errors in 282 chances for a .950 fielding percentage. 
The Titans have a team fielding percentage of .971, sixth best in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"He has solidified our infield and has developed into one of the premier 
shortstops in college baseball," Fullerton Coach Larry Cochell said of Farlow. 
"When he came here, I told him, 'You're my shortstop. I don't care what you 
hit, but you're my shortstop, so just relax and play.' " 
</P>
<P>
Farlow, who is 6-feet-4 and 170 pounds, never heard those words at USC. A 
graduate of Granada Hills Kennedy High School who, as a sophomore, hit a 
last-inning home run in Dodger Stadium that beat Banning for the 1985 City 4-A 
championship, Farlow spent most of his freshman season at USC on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
He started at shortstop in the fall of his sophomore year at USC but had a few 
bad scrimmages the following January and was on the bench again at the start of 
the 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in a situation where I had to perform day in and day out," Farlow said. 
"There was no grace period. I was constantly under a microscope. It was hard 
for me, because I was scared to make an error." 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the season, second baseman Damon Buford was struggling, so USC 
Coach Mike Gillespie tried Farlow at second. Farlow said he played well for 
about 20 games, until Gillespie moved Farlow back to shortstop and Bret Boone, 
who had been playing shortstop, to second base. 
</P>
<P>
"Having not played shortstop for a while, I made a few errors, had two bad 
games, and I was done again," Farlow said. "I didn't move back to second base, 
just out." 
</P>
<P>
Farlow says his problems at USC stemmed from an NCAA regional game during his 
freshman season, in which Farlow replaced injured Brett Barberie in the early 
innings of a game against Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
Farlow, who played sparingly all season, made two errors, and the Trojans, who 
needed to win one of two games to advance to the College World Series, lost. He 
didn't play the second game, which USC also lost. 
</P>
<P>
"The confidence in me wasn't there throughout my sophomore year," Farlow said. 
"I think that playoff game was always in the back of the coach's mind. That's 
my opinion." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie insists that he never lost confidence in Farlow. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is we were direct in our evaluations of him and that he was treated 
fairly," Gillespie said. "We liked him. We just didn't think he was going to 
play immediately. He was a third baseman for most of his high school career, 
and shortstop was still a new position for him." 
</P>
<P>
Also new to Farlow was Gillespie's coaching style. Gillespie admits he is more 
intense than most baseball coaches -- that he tries hard to make corrections 
when he feels players are doing something wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie needed some consistency out of his shortstop last season and wasn't 
getting it, so Farlow wound up taking a lot of heat. 
</P>
<P>
"That position being so important to us, he got very close scrutiny," Gillespie 
said. "I was always hovering around him, and I always had comments to make. 
Whether it's accurate to say they were constructive or critical depends on who 
you hear them from. I tried to convey coaching, but maybe he saw it a different 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Farlow said he never felt indifferent toward Gillespie, though. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize his intentions were to get me going, but they had a negative 
effect," he said. "It didn't motivate me. It did just the opposite. The game is 
mostly mental, and if you have your mind on what the coach is thinking, how can 
you play your best? There's no way." 
</P>
<P>
Farlow knew he needed to transfer to a school where he could play every day, 
and that decision wasn't too difficult. When USC played Fullerton in 1989, the 
Titans made five errors. Farlow figured, if he couldn't play at Fullerton, he 
couldn't play anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to admit, I came here a little cocky," Farlow said. "I knew what they 
did last year and I knew I was going to do the job at shortstop." 
</P>
<P>
He also has done a respectable job at the plate, raising his average from .210 
midway through the season to .277. Farlow, who moved from the No. 9 spot in the 
order to No. 7, hit .355 in Big West Conference games and has six home runs and 
31 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
He hit .286 with two RBIs during the NCAA Central regional but was named to the 
all-tournament team on the strength of his defense. Farlow, who has a strong 
arm, had 14 assists, including several on plays up the middle, four putouts and 
no errors in four games. 
</P>
<P>
The key to his season, Farlow said, was playing in a more relaxed atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't need someone always on my back, I just need to play and do my own 
thing," he said. "They're confident about my skills here, and they don't feel 
they have to tell me what to do. I think I was always a good shortstop, but 
I've been able to show it more here." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie is not surprised by Farlow's success. 
</P>
<P>
"With us, he was in there one day and out the next," Gillespie said. "I'm sure 
he was looking over his shoulder, thinking he was going to get the hook when he 
booted one. It was a wise and good move for him to transfer. He has settled 
into the shortstop position and is playing comfortably."

SAM ERMOLENKO PUTS ACCIDENT BEHIND HIM, GETS BACK ON HIS BIKE 
</P>

<P>
Sam Ermolenko, America's leading speedway motorcycle racer since 1985, has not 
ridden seriously since an accident last July 17 nearly ended his career. But he 
hopes experience and guile will see him through Saturday night in the American 
Speedway Final at Long Beach Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The race is the first qualifying round for the 1990 World Finals for riders 
from the United States and Canada. Ermolenko, 29, has won it three years in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
But Sudden Sam fell during the world long-track championships last summer at 
Herxheim, West Germany, and was hit by a trailing motorcycle. The impact broke 
his leg in three places, and surgeons worked seven hours piecing it back 
together. He was hospitalized for four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I still don't have any idea how it happened," Ermolenko said this week while 
relaxing at his mother's home in Cypress. "I was riding up front when something 
happened in the third turn, and I went down and was hit by another rider. I 
don't know what caused the whole thing, and it's not really been my main 
concern to find out. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more interested in being able to ride Saturday night. I'm not 100%, but 
I'm feeling OK and I think I can put it all together for one night. I know what 
has to be done and I've been training my mind to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Ermolenko tested the ailing leg last week in races at San Bernardino, where he 
finished second in the main event, and at Ascot, where he fell in a heat. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't really into the races," he said. "I was more interested in finding 
out how I felt getting out of the gate. That's the important thing at Long 
Beach, the start. When I fell at Ascot, it was because I was pretty tired and 
my leg was sore from riding two nights in a row. It takes me a long time to 
warm up because of the muscle damage, and there were some long delays at Ascot. 
That hurt me, too. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be easier on me at Long Beach because of the longer turns, where there 
won't be as much force on my leg." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty riders will compete Saturday night, and only four will advance to the 
Overseas Final in Coventry, England, on June 24. From there, the path goes to 
the Intercontinentel Final at Fjeldsted, Denmark, on Aug. 12 and the World 
Final at Bradford, England, on Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"The American Final is the hardest single competition in the world," Ermolenko 
said. "There are nine guys here capable of riding in the World Finals, and only 
four of them will get a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Six of the 20 have been riding this season in the British Speedway League, 
which should give them an advantage on the 380-yard Long Beach track. The six 
are Ronnie Correy of Fullerton, Greg Hancock of Costa Mesa, Rick Miller of 
Reseda, Billy Hamill of Monrovia and the Moran brothers, Shawn of Apple Valley 
and Kelly of Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
Correy, a teammate of Ermolenko's on the Wolverhampton Wolves, has been 
challenging world champion Hans Nielsen of Denmark for the individual points 
lead in the British League this season and was the only American in the World 
Final last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Riding in England is a big advantage coming into a race like this," Ermolenko 
said. "The weekly tracks in Southern California are so small that the riders 
don't have much opportunity to adjust to the longer international-sized ovals. 
They are only on the Long Beach track twice a year, and that doesn't give much 
time to get the right setup on their bikes." 
</P>
<P>
Stateside favorites who will be contesting for the four berths include national 
champion Bobby Schwartz of Costa Mesa, Lance King of Fountain Valley, Mike 
Faria of Riverside, Brad Oxley of San Clemente, Steve Lucero of Riverside and 
Robert Pfetzing of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Ermolenko, who lives eight months a year in Hatton, England, was released by 
doctors to ride only two weeks ago. Because of his condition and his record, 
Ermolenko appealed to the American Motorcyclist Assn. to be seeded into the 
Overseas Final, but the appeal was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
"The AMA said it might set a precedent, which they didn't want to do, but I 
appealed on the grounds that I'd won three in a row and had the best record in 
the World Finals since Bruce Penhall." 
</P>
<P>
Penhall won the world title in 1981 and '82. Ermolenko tied for first place in 
1985 but lost in a three-way runoff to Danish riders Erik Gundersen and 
Nielsen. In 1987, he was in a runoff for second place but lost to Gundersen 
again, as Nielsen won. He was sixth in 1986 and fourth in '88. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ermolenko won the American Final and the Overseas Final but never 
made it to the World Finals because of his crash. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's 20-race program will start at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
SPRINT CARS -- Ron Shuman, the defending California Racing Assn. champion who 
did not have a victory in the first 10 races, has won two main events in a row 
at Ascot Park and is in contention for a third consecutive championship. John 
Redican still leads, but Shuman has moved into fourth place behind Redican, 
former champion Brad Noffsinger, who won Sunday at Tucson, and Rip Williams. 
All will be in Saturday night's 30-lap Ascot main event. . . . Saturday will be 
Antique Race Car and Old-timers' Night, featuring cars and drivers from the 
Western Racing Assn. era between 1930 and '50. Former Indy 500 and midget 
racing champion Sam Hanks is expected to attend with his No. 5 midget, along 
with two other 500 winners, Rodger Ward and Parnelli Jones. 
</P>
<P>
SPEEDWAY BIKES -- Bitter rivals Bobby Schwartz and Steve Lucero will continue 
their feud tonight at Costa Mesa, where sidecars will also run. 
</P>
<P>
STOCK CARS -- Marcus Mallett, bidding to become the first black driver to win a 
track championship at Ascot Park, will try for his fourth victory of the season 
in Sunday night's pro stock feature of the Winston Racing Series. Mallett held 
off John Kocsis last Monday night for his third victory and took a 32-point 
lead over Chris Laney, with Kocsis two points further back. . . . Sportsman, 
street stocks and mini stocks will compete Saturday night at both Saugus 
Speedway and Cajon Speedway. . . . Dirt cars will run Saturday night at Santa 
Maria Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
DRAG RACING -- Spinal surgery for paralyzed racer Darrell Gwynn has been 
postponed while doctors treat an infection and high fever in Miami. The six- to 
eight-hour operation, which had been planned for Wednesday, will not take place 
until next week, according to a spokesperson from the Miami Project to Cure 
Paralysis. Frank Hawley will drive Gwynn's top fuel car for the remainder of 
the season. . . . Top Gas West will hold a meet Saturday at the Los Angeles 
County Raceway in Palmdale.

MCDONAGH LIKES UNDERDOG ROLE AGAINST HOLYFIELD 
</P>

<P>
Generally speaking, Irishmen love to tell stories. And given a few more years, 
Seamus McDonagh might be a match for any of the fabled raconteurs of the 
Emerald Isle. 
</P>
<P>
Only 27 years old, McDonagh has already lived enough for a miniseries or two, 
and Friday night at the Trump Plaza he's co-starring in a Rocky-type production 
that can only enhance the adventure. 
</P>
<P>
Few are giving the willing but untested McDonagh much chance against unbeaten 
Evander Holyfield, who is marking time while waiting for an expected 
heavyweight title shot against Buster Douglas this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation," said McDonagh, "is perfect for me. I may not be up to it, but 
look at my opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Those who have seen the lad from County Mayo in Ireland perform over the last 
couple of years say he has "a puncher's chance." He carries 14 knockouts among 
19 wins in 20 starts. 
</P>
<P>
But the fighting is only a piece of the McDonagh tale since he left his 
homeland eight years ago seeking educational and athletic opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
At one point during a news conference hyping the Showtime bout, someone pointed 
out Holyfield had just completed a cameo role in a movie produced by a member 
of manager Ken Sander's family. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in a picture, too, although inadvertently," said McDonagh. "They were 
filming one day on Fifth Avenue in New York and I nearly ran over Paul Newman." 
</P>
<P>
That was in his coachman days handling a carriage and horses in Central Park. 
It was just one of the many jobs McDonagh held while striving toward a degree 
in English literature at St. John's University. 
</P>
<P>
"And don't believe all that bull you might have read about me carrying a 4.0 
(grade point average) for a couple of semesters. It looks like I'm going to end 
with about a 3.7 when I finish up in the fall." 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a guy who has never gone to school full time. "Reason for that is I 
always enjoyed the jobs I've worked at and I've always gone for the education, 
not simply to get a job or anything." 
</P>
<P>
For instance, on a lark recently, McDonagh showed up at tryouts for "Guys and 
Dolls" at the school and ended up playing an Irish cop, Lieutenant Branigan. 
"Was that type-casting, or what?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved it, so stage acting is something I'm definitely going to look into. 
And then I've always had a fascination to pursue law school. There are 
definitely many things I plan to pursue and no matter what happens (in Friday 
night's fight), I'll get to them. It's just going to take more time." 
</P>
<P>
Besides nearly doing a number on Paul Newman, McDonagh was prompted to tell of 
another stunt of his that made all the papers in the Big Apple. "It was raining 
real hard and me and the horse were getting soaked," he recalled with a gleam 
in his eye. "Thought it would be a good idea to find shelter ... in a bar. No 
sooner were we there when the place suddenly filled up with people." 
</P>
<P>
No, Mr. McDonagh is hardly your run-of-the-mill challenger, a breed that always 
seems to disintegrate when thrust into the limelight. "I'm relishing this," he 
assured. 
</P>
<P>
"What's especially good is being involved with Evander. We're both polite guys 
and the hype has been fun. I'm getting calls from everywhere constantly and 
it's interesting." 
</P>
<P>
The time will come, of course, when the experience hardens and he will be 
facing the unbeaten (23-0) No. 1 challenger. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never been down on the canvas as a pro," he said, almost 
apologetically. "I have more power than Holyfield's last two opponents (one of 
whom, Alex Stewart, gave him fits) and I have speed. What Buster Douglas did to 
Mike Tyson excites me and gives me confidence. I think I can do it here." 
</P>
<P>
He continued, "As a people, the Irish are considered good battlers. We're right 
there to the very end. My father was a fighter. He's here and he's loving this. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you'd say fighting has run in my family because my grandfather was a 
bareknuckle fighter who loved it so much he journeyed to the Jack Dempsey-Gene 
Tunney 'Long Count' fight in Chicago just to say he was there. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got six bus loads from New York coming down and two from Boston. Plus 
family." He smiled, thought on his good fortune and quoted from Dylan Thomas: 
"Do not go gentle into the night." Form says there's no way it can happen, but 
Seamus McDonagh is a long shot it's fun believing in.

Mark Tucker was determined to conquer Mt. Everest, and if it meant serving as a 
cook to do it, then so be it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd take whatever position was available, just to get on the team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So when the Chinese government whittled back the number of Mt. Everest permits 
it would issue Tucker's climbing team, he volunteered for kitchen duty -- a 
minor inconvenience, he said, for a chance to scale the 29,028-foot mountain in 
windy, subfreezing weather. 
</P>
<P>
And on May 9, after six weeks of slaving over canned beans, Tucker became the 
first Orange County resident to reach Everest's summit, joining an elite group 
of fewer than 300 people who have conquered the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
It is a climber's ultimate dream. 
</P>
<P>
"As a climber, you're always going, 'What's higher? What's higher?' " said 
Tucker, 33, who returned to Huntington Beach on Tuesday night. Nothing on Earth 
is higher than the Himalayan peak, wedged between the border of Nepal and 
Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker undertook the climb with the International Peace Climb, a Seattle-based 
organization. Forty-seven expedition members representing the United States, 
the Soviet Union and China reached the summit in an effort led by Jim 
Whittaker, who in 1963 became the first American to achieve that feat. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, they hoped to reach the summit on Earth Day, April 22, but weather 
conditions did not allow it. The team's mission, in part, was to clean up 
debris left by previous climbers. 
</P>
<P>
The climb took six weeks, most of which was devoted to stocking seven way 
stations along the mountain with food and medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Some days, the windchill factor pushed temperatures to minus-100 degrees 
Fahrenheit. "You couldn't have any skin exposed," Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
When at last all systems were go, the climbers returned to base camp and rested 
for a few days. Then they headed back toward the summit. 
</P>
<P>
After six weeks of preparation for the momentous event, the climbers reached 
their prize in a mere six or seven days. 
</P>
<P>
Back on level ground, the climbers were treated to a tour of China that 
featured banquets honoring their achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's all-consuming avocation is likewise his profession. He works as a 
guide, mostly at Mt. Rainier in Washington, escorting less experienced 
climbers. 
</P>
<P>
He is a wanderer who has no permanent residence, aside from the Huntington 
Beach house he grew up in. "I've got the greatest parents you could imagine -- 
I couldn't do what I do without them," Tucker said. "I use their home as a 
base. When I'm low on money, I can come back here and hang out for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Although he has managed to live life as he likes it -- outdoors -- Tucker said 
he sometimes yearns for stability, and even a bit of predictability. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite often I get a little depressed, and envious of my brothers because 
they're settled down with families and routines. They have homes; I have a 
truck. I've just never been able to slow down." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker figures he has another seven years of sportsmanship before he needs to 
worry about a mid-life career change. Until then, there are other mountains to 
climb, even though he has realized his most fantastic dream. 
</P>
<P>
"Mt. Everest is the highest, but quite a few mountains are more technically 
difficult," Tucker said. "California has some of the greatest mountains in the 
world. I'll never run out of challenges." SUSAN CHRISTIAN
