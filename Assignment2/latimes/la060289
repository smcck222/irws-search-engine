METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INJUNCTION RESTRAINS ANIMAL RIGHTS GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Abby Soven has issued a preliminary injunction 
prohibiting harassment of UCLA faculty members at their homes and other 
disruptive activities by Last Chance for Animals, a group opposed to the use of 
animals in scientific research. 
</P>
<P>
The injunction specifies that Last Chance for Animals and six of its leaders 
may not threaten, intimidate, harass or annoy faculty at their homes, break 
into or block facilities at the Westwood campus or interfere with or obstruct 
the teaching, research or other functions of the campus. The research in 
question involves cats. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA spokesman Richard Elbaum said the group has broken into campus 
laboratories where research involving the cats is done and has harassed faculty 
members who are conducting research using animals. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Rose, president of Last Chance for Animals, who was named in the 
injunction, said the ruling was "a direct infringement of our constitutional 
rights" that "just goes to show the power of these institutions." 
</P>
<P>
"They can dictate their own law," he said. "But in no way will this deter us. 
We will prevail." 
</P>
<P>
Rose acknowledged that his group had demonstrated at the homes of two UCLA 
health-sciences faculty members but denied that the protesters acted 
inappropriately.

The cows came home, almost, when a dairy chain decided to mark the beginning of 
National Dairy Month by taking Holstein cows to a Burbank supermarket. The idea 
of the guest performance was to show kindergarten-aged, city-bred children 
where milk comes from. Not to confuse the issue, but also in attendance was an 
18-wheeler truck with a pink fuel tank underneath.

'CLARIFYING A CONTROVERSY'

<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial doesn't resolve the problem. Middle-income American retirees 
have great concern over long-term health care, nursing home needs, and if 
healthy, senior housing at an affordable price. None of these are being 
addressed. That's why there is "the rage" to which you refer in your opening 
sentence. We want to live out our senior years in dignity and self-worth. The 
alternative is a fear based on hard evidence when friends and neighbors are 
caught in catastrophic illness. In such circumstances, we dread the possibility 
of assets spent and relief available only as penniless dependents. 
</P>
<P>
Taxing seniors on levels of tax returns fails to take into account all the 
factors that impact on middle America. It's double taxation at work, too. 
Retirement incomes were gathered after prior taxation while working. And in 
most cases, these incomes are not tied to inflationary trends. That was why a 
cost-of-living index was tied to Social Security payments. And after being 
given, taken away by taxation on Social Security, and now on Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
Older Americans support health care for the "37 million Americans who have no 
health insurance of any kind." That this condition exists rests with Congress. 
Don't blame our social needs for this failure. 
</P>
<P>
I find whatever "controversy" that has been created comes from an unwillingness 
to grapple with reality. There can be resolution of the problem(s). Reduce 
waste. Cut budgets of a military-industrial complex whose appetite has no 
stomach for more humane aspirations. Or let's learn to have lips that read, 
"taxes."

U.S. NAVY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This letter is in response to the one written by Joe Galliani of Long Beach 
(May 23) regarding his diatribe against the United States Navy. 
</P>
<P>
While I can accept skepticism about our public affairs policies from someone 
obviously not familiar with the system, I cannot accept being called "fat, 
arrogant, impotent and clueless." I joined the Navy five years ago to serve my 
country and to try to improve my experience and education level. I have done 
so, but the price has been a taxable income of $12,000 last year. I also 
receive about $630 a month to subsidize my rent of $660 per month. 
</P>
<P>
I have a wife and two small children, and I have spent over 18 months away from 
them at sea, twice for six months at a time. My shipmates and I work 10-12 
hours a day, longer at sea, in a dangerous and generally thankless environment. 
One comfort we have is the general belief that the American public knows of our 
sacrifices (danger, low pay, family separation) and appreciates it. 
</P>
<P>
Recent events such as the people of Long Beach contributing funds to the 
families of the men killed on the Iowa and the Torrance Armed Forces Day parade 
make Galliani's contempt for the men and women of the Navy an obvious minority 
point of view. Remember, sir, trite as it may sound, those men on the Iowa, 
White Plains and Enterprise died for you, too.

As you suggested ("Clarifying a Controversy," editorial, May 22) surtaxes on 
higher incomes of retired persons might be justified as partial financing for 
increased Medicare benefits. However, this overlooks a very important reason 
for complaint. A more steeply graded use of progressive taxation should in all 
fairness be applied to all taxpayers, and not only to the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Medicare expenditures are made primarily to the elderly. Funds for basic 
education are largely expended for the young -- but school children are not 
asked to pay additional taxes for this benefit. Government action to stimulate 
full employment most directly affects those between childhood and retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Guaranteeing such basic human rights is a responsibility of all of us. The 
principle of taxation on the basis of ability to pay should be applied equally 
to all taxpayers.

I cannot understand why you seem so perplexed at senior citizens' outrage over 
the payment scheme for the catastrophic insurance changes to Medicare. We all 
support improved and expanded medical coverage in America, but we will not 
accept this new and unique tax to pay for a small portion of Medicare coverage. 
This scheme is right in there with the smoke-and-mirrors philosophy of our 
government in recent years, and it adds a new dimension to the hodgepodge dog's 
dinner which our overall tax system has become. 
</P>
<P>
If it survives, do you doubt there will not be widespread applications in the 
future, all just as inequitable. It also serves once again to load the costs 
primarily onto the middle-class citizen. If this is not a new and unique method 
of taxation, will you please point out any other federal tax which requires 
only the recipient to pay? I have asked my elected representatives as well as 
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) and Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Merced) that question and 
they do not respond, I am sure because they do not want to admit the answer. 
</P>
<P>
You have attempted several times to explain and clarify this issue, but you can 
only rationalize your support for this inequitable tax -- you can't clarify it 
into acceptability. It is simply unfair and you know it. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know what the solution is or what it will take to get this corrected 
but I intend to keep working to do just that, and I will not stop until it is. 
I will not support any office seeker or elected official who is not actively 
working for the same end. I hope you can finally see the same light. You should 
be just as outraged as we are.

MAKING CONGRESS WORK AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While Jim Wright implored the House to "end this mindless cannibalism," his 
resignation by itself will not end the ethics binge that has gripped the U.S. 
House of Representatives. To some degree, the affair must run its course. The 
House has survived many crises in its 200 years, and it will survive this one. 
Ultimately, the House should emerge as a stronger, more effective legislative 
body. 
</P>
<P>
One key reason for this is the firm, fair and professional manner in which the 
House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct has conducted itself during 
the Wright affair, and in which it will conduct itself in dealing with ethics 
questions brought against Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia. Under 
Chairman Julian Dixon (D-Los Angeles), the Ethics Committee has stood like a 
rock amid the partisan-fanned flames of accusation, rumor, news leaks, innuendo 
and countercharge. 
</P>
<P>
Not so long ago, congressional ethics committees were virtual shams that evaded 
having to investigate their colleagues if at all possible, or that whitewashed 
or soft-pedaled ethical lapses if action could not be avoided. The idea of 
conducting an investigation that might actually bring down the Speaker of the 
House was all but unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
Under Dixon's chairmanship, the House group has moved with determination when 
allegations against members were brought. Dixon irritated many members by 
issuing a new interpretation of what assets congressmen had to report. But the 
committee has been almost universally applauded for the thorough and judicial 
manner in which it has handled the Wright investigation. 
</P>
<P>
There is much that is beyond Dixon's control, however. On the day after 
Wright's dramatic House speech, the National Republican Congressional Committee 
distributed a memo among GOP House members urging exploitation of the ethical 
problems of Wright and House Whip Tony Coelho (D-Merced), who is resigning from 
Congress rather than undergo an investigation of his purchase of a $100,000 
junk bond. The memo said the fall of two of the three top Democrats in the 
House is the result of Democratic arrogance from being in control too long. 
That may sound like an appealing campaign pitch, but the document offered no 
evidence to support such a blanket indictment. 
</P>
<P>
And there was a mood among some Democrats to get even with Gingrich, the 
acerbic new GOP whip who first pressed the case against Wright and claims to 
have a list of other Democrats to track down. Minority Leader Robert H. Michel 
of Illinois told Gingrich publicly to cool it -- that he has a broader 
responsibility now as a member of the House leadership. Good advice. Michel 
must know that other Republicans could become investigation targets if anyone 
wanted to dig enough. 
</P>
<P>
The best hope for a general cooling-off is quick, firm action by Rep. Tom Foley 
(D-Wash.) when he succeeds Wright as Speaker next week to bring order to the 
House and propose reforms in rules of conduct that everyone can understand and 
obey without the temptation of fudging or cheating. Then the House should get 
back to work conducting the people's unfinished business.

MOTHER GETS PROBATION IN ATTACK ON DAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Lancaster judge Thursday sentenced Ava Casey Brown to five years probation 
for running her 16-year-old daughter off the road in a high-speed car chase, in 
line with an appeals court decision that threw out Brown's original five- year 
prison term. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, of Littlerock, was originally sent to state prison for assault with a 
deadly weapon and child endangerment, but was released eight months later by 
order of the state Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
In her ruling Thursday, Lancaster Superior Court Judge Margaret M. Grignon 
cited the appellate court's decision, which questioned the appropriateness of 
the prison term imposed by former Lancaster Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, a nurse's aide and Sunday school teacher, ran her daughter, Renee Casey, 
off the road in a car chase after Casey stayed out late without permission. 
Brown pursued Casey at speeds up to 80 m.p.h. and bumped her car at least 
twice, causing a crash in which Casey's teen-age passenger suffered a broken 
collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Angry Debate 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's sentencing hearing, which included angry debate over allegations 
of racism made by Brown and her supporters, Grignon said Brown's lack of a 
criminal record and the spontaneous nature of the crime met legal criteria for 
unusual cases in which probation is appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"In light of the appellate opinion, the probation report . . . and in light of 
the fact that the defendant has spent time in state prison, I see no purpose in 
sending her back to state prison," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Grignon said Brown's incarceration would severely disrupt the lives of her 
three other children. She ordered Brown to pay $100 in restitution to Arintha 
Anderson, the passenger injured in the car crash. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 37, wept outside the courtroom as she was congratulated by her fiance, 
Mark Alston, and friends from the predominantly black Sun Village neighborhood 
of Littlerock. 
</P>
<P>
"It's over with," she said. "Thank you, Jesus. I'm going to sit down and write 
a book about my experience, and I'm going to plan my wedding." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Immediate Release 
</P>
<P>
This year, the appellate court upheld the conviction. The three-judge panel 
ruled that Judge Coen, who is now in San Fernando Superior Court, erred when he 
rejected a probation officer's report urging that Brown get probation, declared 
Brown a danger to the community and set bail at $100,000. Criminal defense 
experts called the appellate court decision to release her immediately on her 
own recognizance extremely rare. 
</P>
<P>
Brown and her supporters have alleged that she was the victim of harsh 
treatment by a white judge and jury because she is black. 
</P>
<P>
Those accusations were criticized Thursday by Deputy Dist. Atty. Kent C. 
Cahill, who asked Grignon to impose a sentence of six years in state prison. 
Cahill pointed out that the appellate court had upheld the conviction, 
including a finding that Brown intended to commit great bodily harm. 
</P>
<P>
He called Brown an unrepentant, "self-righteous" woman and said the unfounded 
claims of racism "cheapen and dilute valid cries of racism." 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most insidious forms of racism is when someone cries racism where 
none exists," Cahill said. "A mother rammed or bumped her daughter's car and 
forced it into a ditch. I don't care what color she was, that's outrageous 
conduct. The only racism I ever saw were the allegations of racism by Ava Brown 
and her supporters." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judge Praised 
</P>
<P>
Brown and her supporters praised Grignon and repeated their criticism of Cahill 
and the original judge and jury, saying Brown would not have been treated as 
harshly if she were white. 
</P>
<P>
"I would maintain that there were racist overtones," said the Rev. Samuel 
Hooker, Antelope Valley NAACP chapter president. "Throughout the whole process, 
not just the sentencing. I hope the 
</P>
<P>
system would recognize that we would like to see justice. If you're guilty, you 
do deserve punishment." 
</P>
<P>
Brown's attorney, Leonard E. Chaitin, said the state appellate judges were the 
heroes of the case and praised Grignon for ignoring Cahill's hyperbole. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said she is not bitter about her imprisonment. Although she did not feel 
she belonged in prison with hardened criminals, she said, some of them were 
most helpful in urging her to write letters to the appellate court asking to be 
released. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned a lot in prison," she said. "I learned how to get along with people 
who really have a hard heart." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said her daughter, now 19, lives with relatives in Arizona and remains 
estranged from her.

MOLINA JOINS BERNARDI IN 1-BLOCK WALK OF PRECINCT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Councilwoman Gloria Molina walked a block in a Latino area of Pacoima Thursday, 
introducing her colleague Councilman Ernani Bernardi to potential voters. 
</P>
<P>
Switching easily from Spanish to English, Molina -- who represents East Los 
Angeles -- urged them to vote for Bernardi, who faces a runoff Tuesday against 
Los Angeles city Fire Department Capt. Lyle Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"He is important to our community. He pays attention to the community," Molina 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But inhabitants of the seven houses the politicians visited along Mercer Street 
needed no convincing. Precinct workers had canvassed the neighborhood earlier 
in the day and most of the residents answered their doors wearing Bernardi 
T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Absentee Ballot 
</P>
<P>
"I already sent my vote yesterday," said John Aguinaga, who completed an 
absentee ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very satisfied with Mr. Bernardi," said his wife, Mary. 
</P>
<P>
One woman asked Molina if Bernardi spoke Spanish too and seemed disappointed to 
learn that he did not. But Bernardi, 77, reassured her that he is a fellow 
Latin: "Italian," he said, pointing to his chest. 
</P>
<P>
When the television cameras left 15 minutes after the precinct walk began, 
Molina and Bernardi called it quits and returned to the Mercer-Haddon 
Homeowners Assn. headquarters for punch and cake. 
</P>
<P>
Molina said she backs Bernardi because he is one of the few council members who 
understands the issues important to her district, such as low-income housing, 
increased police protection and the need to remove abandoned cars and graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frequent Allies 
</P>
<P>
Since Molina's election in 1987, the two have often voted together in the 
council. "A lot of the others have gotten to where they say, 'Oh, here it comes 
again' on certain kinds of issues," Molina said. "I think our districts must be 
very much alike." 
</P>
<P>
Molina and Councilman Marvin Braude, who with his wife contributed $1,000 to 
Bernardi's reelection campaign, are the only members of the council who have 
actively supported the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Hall's campaign was preparing Thursday for a precinct walk in the 7th District 
on Saturday that is scheduled to include former governor Jerry Brown, now 
chairman of the state Democratic Party; Los Angeles City Controller Rick 
Tuttle; state Assemblyman Richard Floyd (D-Carson); and state Sen. Art Torres 
(D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Dolores Huerta, vice president of the United Farm Workers of America, plans to 
sponsor a free menudo breakfast in Pacoima for Hall Saturday morning and then 
join the precinct walk, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latinos' Endorsements 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates have been endorsed by some local Latino leaders and Hall also 
won endorsements from state and national Latino politicians, including Torres 
and Rep. Matthew Martinez (D-Monterey Park). 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Bernardi picked up additional Latino backing from a 
coalition of six civic groups called the "Latino Justice-Public Safety 
Political Endorsing Convention." At a City Hall press conference, group leaders 
said they believe Bernardi will be responsive to issues that affect Latinos 
such as crime and immigrant rights. 
</P>
<P>
Both Bernardi and Hall were interviewed by representatives of the group May 20. 
The same coalition, which represents about 3,000 Los Angeles-area Latinos who 
work as attorneys, prison and jail guards and police, had endorsed Irene Tovar 
for the April primary race. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,000-member Latino Law Enforcement Assn., of which 800 members are Los 
Angeles Police Department officers, are included in the group. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, however -- who is a former president of the firefighters' union and has 
strong support among labor unions -- holds the endorsement of the Los Angeles 
Police Protective League.

wishing that some of the empty lots were zoned for homes -- not offices. 
</P>
<P>
The 200 builders and brokers aboard buses chartered by a business group called 
the Technology Corridor Assn. were told that a severe shortage of affordable 
housing threatens to cloud the sunny future of commercial development in the 
26-mile-long strip between Woodland Hills and Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
"The No. 1 problem is housing prices," warned Paul Garrity, a commercial 
development expert from the accounting firm of Peat Marwick Main, whose remarks 
set the tone for the tour. 
</P>
<P>
"Less than 50% of the jobs being created in the Technology Corridor are being 
filled by people in the community. There's a lot of reverse commuting going 
on," he said, as workers commute from the cheaper living areas of the inner 
city to jobs in the farthest suburbs, where they cannot afford to live. 
</P>
<P>
Garrity said low-cost housing being constructed in the Palmdale area is 
becoming a threat to industrial areas such as the Ventura Freeway corridor. 
"They will draw jobs out there," he warned. "If you think you're going to 
attract clerical workers to Thousand Oaks, think again." 
</P>
<P>
Displaying a chart that showed the price of the average Conejo Valley home has 
jumped from about $200,000 in 1986 to about $445,000 today, he added, "This is 
the picture that will scare an audience of employers out of their seats." 
</P>
<P>
The employment statistic contradicted the predictions of some corridor 
developers, who won permission to build offices and manufacturing plants in 
places such as Agoura Hills and Thousand Oaks by promising local authorities 
that their projects would provide jobs for local residents. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, nearly 17 million square feet of office and industrial space has 
popped up along the freeway corridor -- most of it in the past five years. 
Hundreds of thousands of additional square feet are under construction. 
</P>
<P>
During Thursday's four-hour bus tour, the development experts were shown 
building after building bearing "for lease" signs. But they were also shown 
dozens of newly completed structures that have been snapped up by major firms 
-- some of whom have signed rental contracts at $30 per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tired of Commute 
</P>
<P>
Some of the leases have been negotiated with Los Angeles-based companies whose 
executives live in Calabasas Park, Westlake Village and Thousand Oaks and are 
tired of their own daily commute, Technology Corridor officials said. 
</P>
<P>
As if to prove that point, when the tour stopped for lunch, commercial real 
estate broker Hal Cook of Cushman and Wakefield rushed to a pay phone to call a 
client in Irwindale. "He's interested in moving out here because his manager 
lives out here and there's a good availability of space," Cook explained. 
</P>
<P>
"Executives at firms that locate out here definitely live in the area," said 
Ricardo Capretta, vice president of development for Katell Properties, which is 
completing a six-structure industrial park, the largest in Agoura Hills. 
"Employees live in places like Newbury Park, Camarillo and Oxnard." 
</P>
<P>
Other businesses that have relocated to the corridor "are pulling employees 
from the Westside and from Palmdale, where they're commuting an hour and a 
half," said tour member Randall Clark, associate director of Bear Stearns Real 
Estate Group in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
"Housing is not a problem now. But affordability will be an issue in the near 
future." 
</P>
<P>
But the high cost of raw land means there is little likelihood that low-income 
housing is in the cards for the corridor, said residential developer Philip E. 
Yasskin, president of JM Peters Co.'s Los Angeles/Ventura division. 
</P>
<P>
Yasskin said workers at his Westlake Village-based construction firm, who work 
on $500,000 homes in the corridor, commute from as far away as Lancaster and 
San Bernardino-Riverside. "There has to be a place for people to live and make 
a living or else people will move and business will leave," Yasskin said during 
the tour's lunch break. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Future Problems 
</P>
<P>
Technology Corridor Assn. President Steve Valenziano agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"In the long term, if we don't solve the housing situation, you look 10 or 15 
years down the line and you have a Santa Barbara situation out here with a 
bunch of old retired people living together," said Valenziano, vice president 
of Faulkner Co., a commercial realty firm. 
</P>
<P>
Valenziano said the 65-firm corridor association is apolitical. But he 
indicated that its members might be receptive to revising city and county 
master plans that have long sought to line the freeway corridor with commercial 
and industrial development. 
</P>
<P>
Planners for the cities and for Los Angeles County have tried to avoid problems 
found in the Valley by clustering commercial developments next to the freeway 
as a buffer between the noisy highway and nearby neighborhoods of single-family 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
Valenziano said it might be possible to mix apartments or other forms of 
affordable housing among offices and industrial parks along the freeway 
corridor. 
</P>
<P>
"If you could get government entities to subsidize that kind of move and set up 
tax incentives for developers, that would be one solution," he said after the 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
"Economically, if it could be rezoned to something else, I think there would be 
support for it."

HOUSE PAINTER SENTENCED FOR VAN THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Fernando house painter was given a six-month suspended sentence Thursday 
after pleading no contest to charges he stole a Volkswagen bus in which a 
23-year-old man sat dying of a gunshot wound. 
</P>
<P>
Vaughn Grant, 39, pleaded no contest to grand theft charges last month in San 
Fernando Superior Court. He was arrested about 4 a.m. April 21 after Los 
Angeles police stopped a van he was driving in Pacoima and found Walter Bickly 
Hackman of Palm Desert suffering from a gunshot wound in the torso. Hackman was 
pronounced dead shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend Hackman was shot in a drug deal turned sour and drove the 
van about 100 yards before collapsing. They said Grant, whom they do not 
believe was involved in the shooting, chanced upon the van with the wounded 
victim inside, stole $50 from him and drove the vehicle away. 
</P>
<P>
Police stopped the van because it fit a description given them by witnesses to 
the shooting. When police ordered Grant out of the van, he dropped a bloodied 
$50 bill, which Deputy Dist. Atty. Ken Barshop said was entered as evidence in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they believe Hackman was shot by Eric Cunningham, who authorities 
said is a Pacoima narcotics dealer, after the two argued about a drug 
transaction. Los Angeles police Detective Steve Fisk said an arrest warrant has 
been issued for Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
They did not find evidence linking Grant to the shooting and witnesses said he 
was not involved, Barshop said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after the sentencing, Grant said he was trying to drive Hackman 
to the hospital when stopped by police. He denied possessing a bloodied $50 
bill and said he agreed to plead no contest to the charges only because 
authorities told him they would release him from custody. 
</P>
<P>
Fisk, however, questioned Grant's version. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he was taking the poor gentleman to the hospital, but when the police 
officers passed him, he didn't make any attempt to flag them down," Fisk said. 
"One has to wonder whether his intentions were to take this man to the hospital 
for medical treatment or to get a free ride and fifty dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Grant said he did not flag down police because he was in a hurry to get to the 
hospital. He said his experience will deter other future good Samaritans who 
may now be reluctant to intervene in emergency situations.

COUNSELED MCMARTIN CASE DEFENDANT; 
</P>
<P>
MINISTER DENIES HEARING OF MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Redondo Beach minister who in the early 1980s counseled McMartin Pre-School 
defendants Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, testified 
Thursday that the sessions had nothing to do with child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
"I never discussed with Raymond Buckey sexual problems with children," said Dr. 
Frank Richelieu, who described himself as pastor of the Church of Religious 
Science, a metaphysical and motivational denomination, and a licensed 
practitioner of prayer treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he testified outside the presence of the jury, "I've seen Raymond on 
general matters regarding his direction in life, his self-image and self-worth, 
and at one time Raymond was going through a drinking experience." 
</P>
<P>
The clergyman said Peggy McMartin Buckey, who was already in counseling, had 
asked if he would see her son "and try to talk with him regarding the direction 
in his life, what he would like to do . . . not any emotional problems." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Counseling Sessions 
</P>
<P>
Richelieu was subpoenaed by prosecutors, who maintain that the counseling 
sessions focused on what they say was Raymond Buckey's sexual attraction to 
young children. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders said he would 
reserve a ruling on whether the counseling sessions are protected by 
confidentiality laws until court resumes next Thursday, after a scheduled 
break, or whether they may be discussed in front of the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Tempers flared both inside and outside the courtroom Thursday as each side 
attacked the other, and the judge at one point admonished the pastor to "calm 
down." 
</P>
<P>
In court, Richelieu said there was "not a word of truth" in a statement by 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Lael Rubin that entries in Virginia McMartin's diaries 
referring to her grandson's "problem" was a reference to his alleged sexual 
proclivity toward children. The prosecutor's comment was contained in a 1987 
Times article. 
</P>
<P>
Asked afterward whether she had some basis two years ago for believing that a 
sexual problem with young children was the subject of that counseling and 
whether she had changed her mind, Rubin said: "I had a basis then, and as of 
about an hour ago rechecked the basis of my statement, and my response is still 
the same." She said she could not reveal the basis for her belief "because it 
hasn't been presented yet." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she believes that Richelieu is lying, Rubin said, "What I'm suggesting 
is that he may have other motivations." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Dean Gits, who represents Peggy McMartin Buckey, maintained 
that "all of the evidence that is now before the court demonstrates that Dr. 
Richelieu never counseled Ray Buckey for anything to do even remotely with 
child molestation." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Danny Davis, who represents Raymond Buckey, told reporters, "I agree 
with Richelieu," and added that Rubin "is a liar." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Written Rules 
</P>
<P>
Richelieu said that while his church has no written rules about divulging what 
happens during counseling sessions, he was trained to respect the confidences 
entrusted to him by the Buckeys and others. The defense is seeking to block 
more detailed questions about the content of those sessions. 
</P>
<P>
During cross-examination of Peggy McMartin Buckey, which resumed late Thursday, 
the judge has allowed testimony about Raymond Buckey's alcohol and drug 
problems, his discomfort with peers and adults and preference for the company 
of children, and a neighbor's account of Raymond's loud arguments with his 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Buckey has painted the school and her conduct there in a particular way," 
he explained to the attorneys, adding that "this tends to seriously cast" that 
in doubt. "If the descriptions here are correct, Raymond Buckey had a lot of 
problems that should have caused him to be removed from the preschool, aside 
from molesting children." 
</P>
<P>
The Buckeys, now in their third year of trial, are charged with 65 counts of 
molestation and conspiracy involving 11 children who attended their Manhattan 
Beach nursery school.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MOTHER WHOSE GIRL ATE COCAINE GETS PROBATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 22-year-old Mission Hills woman was sentenced to three years probation 
Thursday after she pleaded guilty to felony child endangerment for allowing her 
10-month-old daughter to eat rock cocaine off the floor of their motel room. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence was imposed on Celeste Viet by San Fernando Superior Court Judge 
Meredith Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Viet was arrested last April when she brought her daughter, Jennifer Waterman, 
to Holy Cross Medical center and doctors there determined that the child was 
suffering from cocaine poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
Viet told doctors that she had found a rock cocaine-like substance in her 
daughter's mouth while the child was playing on the rug of the motel room where 
Viet and her boyfriend had recently moved. She said she was not sure what the 
substance was but that she became worried when her daughter grew pale and 
started vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, Viet had been using cocaine shortly before the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
The child recovered and is now in the custody of her grandmother.

CHARGER ROOKIE COURTNEY HALL IS YOUNG AND FULL OF PROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN HEWITT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chargers will tell you all sorts of fascinating facts about Courtney Hall, 
the center they selected in the second round of April's NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
They will tell you about how he bench-pressed 225 pounds 36 times in a row at 
the combine scouting workouts in Indianapolis last winter. Nobody else did 
more. 
</P>
<P>
They will tell you Hall was identified as "gifted" (135 IQ or higher) by the 
California state educational system when he was a fifth-grader in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
They will tell you Hall will be the youngest player in the NFL (20) when 
training camp begins in July. They will tell you he is the center of their 
future despite the ferocity of the competition Hall is getting from ornery 
Dennis McKnight and 34-year-old Don Macek, a player who refuses to go away. 
</P>
<P>
There's lots to tell about Courtney Hall. There's even more to know. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the facts the Chargers won't volunteer about Hall are scary, sad, 
moving, marvelous, interesting, inspiring and intense. 
</P>
<P>
They will tell you Hall's Banning High School football team won the Los Angeles 
Class 4-A city championship in 1983. But they won't tell you about the darkness 
that invaded Hall's world that fall. Probably because they don't know. And even 
if they do, it's not the kind of stuff you put in the media guide. 
</P>
<P>
"Courtney never smiled once that whole year," said Chris Ferragamo, Hall's high 
school coach and brother of former Ram quarterback Vince Ferragamo. 
</P>
<P>
And he didn't tell anybody why. He didn't want anybody to know his father was 
dying. 
</P>
<P>
"What good would that have done?" he says. 
</P>
<P>
In September of that year, William Hall had driven himself to the hospital in 
the family car. He would never leave. He complained initially to doctors about 
shortness of breath. Tests uncovered a cyst on his neck that eventually caused 
paralysis from the chest down. 
</P>
<P>
There was a brief period after doctors removed the cyst when they thought 
William Hall was recovering. But soon he needed a tracheotomy. Then he began 
hemorrhaging. A week after Banning won the city championship, he died. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very devastating to all of us," said Doris Hall, Courtney's mother. So 
devastated was Doris that she never returned to her job as dean of a local 
junior high school. 
</P>
<P>
She isn't sure whether it was her son's role in Banning's championship season 
that kept her husband alive that autumn or just strong family ties. "But there 
was something," she said. "There was somebody holding onto somebody. . . . But 
in the end, he just asked me to let him go." 
</P>
<P>
Each day after football practice that fall, Hall would visit his father. He 
begged Ferragamo to let him take game film, which he would show his father in 
the hospital room. William Hall had no voice, and his son could only understand 
his father's words by reading his lips. 
</P>
<P>
"But," Doris Hall said, "my husband was lucid to the end." 
</P>
<P>
He was so lucid that it frustrated Courtney. USC and Rice were aggressively 
recruiting Hall. And when Stanford, Hall's first choice, lost interest, Hall 
wanted his father's guidance. 
</P>
<P>
"Recruiting," he says now, recalling that period, "is a dirty game." 
</P>
<P>
But William Hall had raised his son to be independent. The boy, not the father, 
would make the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Courtney came home from the hospital one day with tears in his eyes," Doris 
Hall remembers. "He was angry. He said: 'I just asked my father which school I 
should attend, and he wouldn't tell me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Doris Hall thought about that for a long time after her husband died. The 
conclusion she finally reached was unmistakeable. "Courtney would have done 
whatever his father had said. But I feel his father didn't want to control 
Courtney's mind from the grave." 
</P>
<P>
So Hall chose Rice, a school whose incoming freshmen last year averaged more 
than 1,300 on their combined SATs. He enrolled as a petroleum engineering 
major. And he was 16 years old when he became a starting center in the 
nails-tough Southwest Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Neither his mother nor Ferragamo was surprised. Doris Hall remembers Courtney 
teaching himself to ride a tricycle less than a month after learning to walk. 
"If you gave him a task to do," she says, "he'd do it." She sent him to 
kindergarten at age 4. 
</P>
<P>
Ferragamo's first exposure to Hall was in 1981. Hall was a 5-11, 143-pound 
10th-grader Banning used at the end of the season to run scout-team plays. One 
year later, Hall had gained 40 pounds and made second team all-city at left 
tackle. By his senior year, he was up to 225. "But it was his get-off that was 
incredible," Ferragamo says. "He got off the ball so quickly. He wasn't fast, 
but he had this acceleration in his legs. It was like an explosion." 
</P>
<P>
Courtney Hall, Ferragamo says, threw the best block he ever saw. It was against 
a big, fast, mean 250-pound kid from Long Beach Poly. Ferragamo still uses film 
of the block as a training tool. "He just got under this kid, lifted his head, 
kept his feet driving, raised him clear off the ground and put him flat on his 
back. Then he hustled downfield and made a shield block that helped the running 
back get a couple of extra yards." 
</P>
<P>
Media guide stuff. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers will readily tell you about Hall's strength and how he has bulked 
up to almost 280 pounds. But they won't tell you about the two shoulder 
operations Hall underwent after his junior season at Rice. 
</P>
<P>
"You might not get your position back," Hall's mother told him at the time. 
</P>
<P>
She was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
But she wasn't wrong in the way she kept her two sons away from the gangs and 
drugs that were almost as prevalent and accessible in Carson as they were in 
the higher-crime downtown LA areas. Courtney Hall and his older brother Rod 
were taking piano and guitar lessons when Courtney was 4. Either Doris or 
William would drive the two boys to and from school and to and from their 
lessons. Later, there were family trips to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the Halls allowed their sons to ride bikes. "But we didn't allow 
them to hang out under the trees at night," Doris Hall says. 
</P>
<P>
This was wise. Courtney Hall says he could have joined a gang as early as the 
fifth grade if he had wanted to do so. The younger kids, he says, would 
audition for gangs by spray-painting on the walls and hanging out at night in 
Del Amo Park "drinking, smoking, getting high and harassing people." 
</P>
<P>
A lot of these people are still Hall's friends (another fact you won't find in 
the Charger press guide). But, Hall admits, "you probably wouldn't want me to 
introduce them to your daughter." 
</P>
<P>
Parenthetically, Ferragamo says Hall is just "the kind of kid you want your 
daughter to go out and marry." 
</P>
<P>
As the gang kids got older, their activities evolved, in Hall's words, into 
"drug-dealing, armed robbery, drive-by shootings and all that." 
</P>
<P>
"Kids could go out and get a job that would pay them $5 an hour," Hall says. 
"Or they could deal drugs and make five grand a week." 
</P>
<P>
The latter, Hall says, drove Porsches, Mercedes and Rolls Royces. They 
sometimes ended up being chauffeured. In a hearse. 
</P>
<P>
One of Hall's earliest childhood friends, also identified by the school system 
as "gifted," went "down the wrong path," Hall says. "He got shot in the head 
three times and killed in LA." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers would rather tell you about how Tampa Bay called moments after 
they selected Hall and offered a 1989 first-round pick in trade. But they won't 
tell you about the scouts who looked at Hall's 6-1 1/2 body and decided his 
arms were too short to extend far enough into the frames of opposing defensive 
linemen. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always thought I had long arms," Hall said recently. "But it would be 
nice to be 6-4." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Hall says his arms were measured two inches longer than those of Ohio 
State's 6-3 Jeff Uhlenake, a fifth-round pick of the Dolphins. Hall and 
Uhlenake were the second and third centers selected. Minnesota's Brian Williams 
(Giants), who played center in the postseason all-star games, was the 18th 
player taken overall. Williams is 6-5 but will probably play guard for the 
Giants next year. 
</P>
<P>
Colt General Manager Jimmy Irsay recently told a reporter for Long Island's 
Newsday that the Colts would have selected Hall with the 22nd pick of the first 
round if Michigan State wide receiver Andre Rison had not been available. 
Marvin Demoff, Hall's Los Angeles-based agent, will be happy to read that. 
</P>
<P>
When Hall eventually signs, he says will buy himself a Blazer or a small truck. 
The Mercedes or Rolls Royce will have to wait until Hall realizes his 
post-football goal of becoming a "CEO of a major corporation." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he will continue to study. Right now he is majoring in Dwight 
Stephenson. Miami's Stephenson is fighting back from a serious knee injury. But 
he is generally conceded to be the NFL's best center of the '80s and perhaps 
the most technically advanced at his position ever to play the game. 
</P>
<P>
Hall says Stephenson gets his left hand up so quickly after he snaps the ball 
that defensive linemen are "stunned before they can even start the pass rush 
move. Also on run-blocking, he's so quick, he can get position on his men and 
cut them off before they even know where the ball's going. And he has such 
great leverage that you rarely ever see him getting run over." 
</P>

Doris Hall remembers the summer before Courtney's sophomore year at Banning. 
Practice had just begun, and it was his first exposure to tackle football. 
"Courtney would come home just sagging," she says. "It looked like his behind 
was hurting. He would do those drills till there were tears in his eyes. But he 
would do them." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's the most interesting fact about Courtney Hall. You can get him 
down. But it will be harder to run over him the next time. And harder yet the 
third.

"The Chargers got a jewel," Ferragamo says.

CITY SECTION BASEBALL CHAMPIONSHIP; 
</P>
<P>
CIZEK STAUNCHES LATE PALISADES THREAT; 
</P>
<P>
INJURED PITCHER LEADS KENNEDY TO 4-A TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In light of the restructured City Section 4-A Division playoff structure, 
whereby teams played three games in three days this week, it figured that 
pitchers would be pushed to the limit. 
</P>
<P>
And of all the guys with weary wings, Kennedy High right-hander Mitch Cizek had 
to be the weariest heading into Thursday's championship game against Palisades 
at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Cizek had pitched the final 3 2/3 innings to earn the win in Kennedy's 
come-from-behind semifinal victory over Sylmar on Wednesday -- only eight days 
after he sliced an artery in his right forearm trying to open a balky window at 
a friend's house. 
</P>
<P>
After the Sylmar outing, in fact, Cizek's arm sprung a leak. 
</P>
<P>
"It was bleeding big time," the 6-foot, 170-pound senior said. "I was gonna go 
to the doctor, but I didn't want to hear any bad news, so I decided not to go." 
</P>
<P>
Cizek, somehow, nursed his tired and wounded arm through seven innings of gutty 
pitching as Kennedy defeated Palisades, 4-3, before 5,206. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about your house calls. 
</P>
<P>
Cizek (9-4) allowed two earned runs, struck out six and walked six. He worked 
one perfect inning, the fifth, and dodged bullets the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
With Kennedy leading by a run entering the bottom of the seventh, Cizek retired 
the first two batters and worked Palisades cleanup hitter Larry Levine -- who 
clubbed his eighth home run of the season and drove in the winning run in the 
seventh against Chatsworth on Wednesday -- to an 0-and-2 count. 
</P>
<P>
Levine, however, slammed a ground-rule double into the left-field seats. Cizek 
appeared shaken as he paced behind the mound, but Coach Manny Alvarado left him 
in. 
</P>
<P>
"He deserved to finish it," said Alvarado, who led the Golden Cougars to their 
third 4-A championship in the 1980s. "The only way he's coming out is if he 
totally loses it, and that wasn't going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Alvarado's confidence was well-placed. Cizek, who was named the game's most 
valuable player, retired Larry Israel on a fly ball to left on the first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (22-7) continued a streak of Valley dominance. No non-Valley team has 
won a 4-A title since Venice did so in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Yet against Palisades (25-5), which knocked off top-seeded Chatsworth in the 
semifinals, it wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
With Kennedy leading, 4-2, in the sixth, Palisades scored a run on Kevin 
Fisher's single to left. Fisher's hit put runners at first and second with no 
outs. 
</P>
<P>
John Myrow moved the runners over with a sacrifice bunt. Cizek, however, struck 
out pinch-hitter Brett Garcia on a 3-and-2 curve for the second out and retired 
Mario Cobian on a hard grounder to third. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a good head on his shoulders," said Mike Codron, who was named the 
tournament MVP. "He didn't have incredible stuff, but he's a really smart 
pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Others had expected Cizek to crumble. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he would fall," Palisades Coach Russ Howard said. "He seemed like he 
was teetering. I think that's what made him so good." 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Cougars picked up where they left off against Sylmar in the 
semifinal round when they scored seven runs in their final two at-bats. Kennedy 
scored two runs in the first inning off Cobian (8-1), a senior right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Murray led off with an infield single and moved to second on a walk to 
Gino Tagliaferri. Cobian then walked Garret Anderson on four pitches to load 
the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Travis Bourne followed with a line drive off the glove of Palisades second 
baseman Fisher. As the ball bounded into short right field -- it was scored an 
error -- Murray and Tagliaferri scored to give Kennedy a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy scored again in the second to take a 3-0 lead. Danny Gugler drilled a 
leadoff single to left and, one out later, was sacrificed to second base by 
James Campbell. Murray followed with an RBI-single to center. Pat DeBoer 
singled to short to put runners at first and second for Tagliaferri. 
</P>
<P>
But after the runners moved up a base on a wild pitch, Tagliaferri, struck out 
to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Cizek was firmly in charge early, allowing only an unearned run in the second 
when the Dolphins closed to within 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Israel singled to open the inning and moved to second on a walk to Kevin 
Boasberg. Palisades loaded the bases when Kennedy first baseman Bourne threw 
low to first on Fisher's sacrifice-bunt attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Cizek, however, retired Myrow on a fly ball to center, Israel scoring on the 
play. A sacrifice bunt by Gary Sandorf moved the runners into scoring position, 
but Cizek struck out Cobian. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy received a big break in the fourth. Jeremy Haas, in the game as a 
pinch-runner for Boasberg, who had walked to lead off the inning, was easily 
doubled up when he bolted for second on Fisher's routine fly to right. 
</P>
<P>
Myrow then lined a two-out single to center and moved to second when Bourne 
missed a pickoff attempt at first. Sandorf, the Dolphins' No. 9 hitter, looped 
a run-scoring single over Tagliaferri at short to make it 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the hardships of the past two weeks, Cizek insisted that he was ready 
for more. 
</P>
<P>
"The cut was the best thing that ever happened to me," Cizek said. "My arm felt 
refreshed and I was never tired tonight. Heck, let's play another one."

HAWTHORNE SEEKS 7TH STATE TRACK TITLE; 
</P>
<P>
BOYS EXPECTED TO DOMINATE; GIRLS GIVEN A LONG-SHOT CHANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After a grueling schedule that included 13 regular-season and five post-season 
meets, all of the cards are on the table for the Hawthorne High track and field 
team. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars, who have dominated state competition for six consecutive seasons, 
will try for their seventh state title beginning tonight and continuing 
tomorrow in the CIF State Championships at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Today's preliminaries begin at 3 p.m., with the finals scheduled for Saturday 
at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawthorne boys' team, consisting of Chris Alexander, Anthony Smith, Erik 
Allen and Curtis Conway, will try for its third consecutive state title and 
sixth in the last seven years. The girls, meanwhile, will try to capture their 
second title in the last four years, although they are considered a long shot. 
</P>
<P>
Will the Cougars' domination continue in 1989? 
</P>
<P>
"We hope so," said Hawthorne Coach Kye Courtney. He said the boys' team's 
chances are as good as ever. "We've had good practice sessions this week and 
we're stronger now than we've ever been. We've usually only counted on four 
events, but now we're six events strong." 
</P>
<P>
The 400-meter relay team, which set a state record in each of the last two 
meets, will try to break the national record of 40.18 held by South Oak Cliff 
High School of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars broke the state record at the CIF divisional finals with a time of 
40.36, then broke that mark last week at the Masters Meet in 40.25. 
</P>
<P>
But Courtney said the team would have broken the 40-second barrier at the 
Masters meet had it not been for a technical mistake by Conway, who ran the 
anchor leg. Conway, after receiving the handoff from Allen, switched the baton 
from one hand to the other before starting the final leg. 
</P>
<P>
"He's only done it during the actual race," said Courtney. "I think he'll get 
over it. He's determined now. He knows he blew it. When he knows he made a 
mistake, he really gets going." 
</P>
<P>
Courtney said the only serious competition for the 400 relay team may come from 
Oakland and Tulare. 
</P>
<P>
"Tulare looks good, Oakland looks good," he said, "but it's hard to find 
anybody else. I think we have a little too much." 
</P>
<P>
Oakland's qualifying time was 41.31, while Tulare posted a mark of 41.61. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars' 1,600-meter relay team also had the fastest qualifying time in the 
state, with a mark of 3:13.05. Hawthorne will also rely on Conway in the 100 
and 200 races. He had the fastest qualifying times in the state in both events 
at the Masters Meet. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander and Allen also qualified in the 100, while Allen will double in the 
200. Keith Pouncey will represent the Cougars in the 110 high hurdles, while 
Smith will compete in the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
On the girls' side, the Cougars will rely on Kesha Marvin in the 400 and Rhonda 
Kennerson in the 800. Hawthorne's 400- and 1,600-meter relay teams also 
qualified. 
</P>
<P>
Other area qualifiers include Bishop Montgomery's Pete Hargraves in the 100. 
Hargraves became the Knights' first state qualifier since Mike Gonzales in the 
early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Camillo of Leuzinger and Greg Wiler of Rolling Hills will compete in the 
pole vault. 
</P>
<P>
Local girls' qualifiers include Kerrie Pegues of St. Bernard in the 400 and 
1,600 relay teams, Marilyn Cragin of Miraleste in the high jump, Lisa Leslie of 
Morningside in the long and triple jump, and Shareena Harris of Morningside in 
the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie, despite qualifying in both of her events, will not compete in the state 
meet because of tryouts for the U.S. junior national basketball team in 
Colorado Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Boys' qualifiers from the L.A. City Section include Larry Billoups of Carson in 
the 400, Chris Manley of Banning in the 800, Curtis Hawkins and Carlos Celosia 
of Carson in the 110 high hurdles, Chris Roulier and Celosia of Carson in the 
300 intermediate hurdles, the Carson 400 and 1,600 relay teams, Bob Whitfield 
and Morris Unutoa of Banning in the shot put, John Anthony of Carson and 
Charles Mabry of Gardena in the high jump, Roulier of Carson in the long jump, 
and Chris Morris of Banning in the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
Area girls' qualifiers from the City Section are Noelle Ragland of Carson in 
the 200, Lucrecia Mendoza of Banning in the 1,600, Mendoza of Banning in the 
3,200, Tasha Turner of Narbonne in the 100 hurdles, the San Pedro 400 relay 
team, the Banning 1,600 relay team, Alysiah Bond of San Pedro in the long jump, 
and Mary Esene of Narbonne in the shot put.

CSUN'S ARREOLA PLACES SECOND IN NCAA 1,500 HEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Darcy Arreola of Cal State Northridge got her first taste of racing at high 
altitude in the NCAA track and field championships in Provo, Utah, on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
And although the experience was unpleasant for Arreola, her second-place finish 
in the first heat of the 1,500 meters (4 minutes, 21.90 seconds) eased some of 
the pain as she qualified for Saturday's finals at Brigham Young University, 
which is 4,627 feet above sea level. 
</P>
<P>
Nikki Toms of Northern Arizona placed first in 4:21.71. 
</P>
<P>
The top two finishers in each heat and the next eight fastest finishers 
qualified for the finals. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the altitude) was a lot worse than I expected," said Arreola, who ran a 
personal best of 4:14.15 to place second in the 1,500 in last week's Division 
II championships in Hampton, Va. "When I went out and ran this morning, it 
didn't really bother me. But I was really breathing hard after the race. . . . 
I came here thinking PR (personal record), but after tonight, no way." 
</P>
<P>
That's fine with Northridge Coach Don Strametz, who said that Arreola has had a 
tendency to place too much emphasis on running fast times. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping the altitude will make her relax," Strametz said. "I'm hoping now 
that she'll just concentrate on running a good race and not worry about running 
a good time." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola said that she will run to win Saturday's final, although she conceded 
that Wisconsin junior Suzy Favor, the two-time defending champion, deserves to 
be favored. 
</P>
<P>
Favor, who has run 4:10.60 this season, won the second heat in 4:20.75 on 
Thursday.

FISHING / DAN STANTON; 
</P>
<P>
BAIT FISHERMAN HAS TO SEARCH FARTHER; 
</P>
<P>
ANCHOVIES AND SQUID ARE HARDER TO FIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dan Stanton 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supplying live bait plays an important role in the success of ocean 
sportfishing. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 40 years, Bill Verna of San Pedro has been fishing for anchovies 
and squid with his two net boats, the Chovey Clipper and the Scout. 
</P>
<P>
Verna, who started hauling bait in 1953 for the sportfishing fleet and private 
boats, said he is now concerned for the future of recreational sportfishing. 
</P>
<P>
He said since last September no schools of bait have been netted in Los Angeles 
Harbor or outside Point Fermin. 
</P>
<P>
Verna said since the cannery discharge from San Pedro and Terminal Island was 
halted, the fish have no natural food in the harbor and have moved outside 
South Bay fishing grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Talking with marine biologists about the decline in anchovies gets him "10 
different answers. And I can't talk to the fish and get answers." 
</P>
<P>
He said the average workday locating the bait is 12 to 14 hours. 
</P>
<P>
In past years there were seven bait haulers, but since the 1970s they have 
quit, one by one, to pursue commercial fishing. 
</P>
<P>
A big boat today can't be converted to a bait hauler for less than $800,000. 
The cost of a bait net averages $14,000. 
</P>
<P>
Verna has to travel as much as 30 miles to locate bait. What has helped is 
sophisticated electronic equipment. He also watches for diving sea birds. 
Weekend party boats and private boats have to wait when he has to go far for 
bait. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacifica out of Long Beach Sportfishing was at the right place at the right 
time on a two-day trip to San Clemente Island. The boat returned with the 
year's first significant catch of white sea bass, 61. 
</P>
<P>
All weighed from 28 to 45 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Nottingham of Gardena caught the whopper of the week, a 45-pounder, after a 
23-minute fight. 
</P>
<P>
The first Santa Monica Bay Top Rod Fishing Tournament will be held Sunday. Tom 
Woods of Marina del Rey, the organizer, said 100% of the money from the 
tournament will go to the Heal the Bay Project. Prizes will be donated by 
tackle companies. 
</P>
<P>
For information, call (213) 399-1146. 
</P>
<P>
Phil and Carrie Friedman of Torrance returned Tuesday from a honeymoon fishing 
trip to Australia. Carrie caught a 55-pound narrow-barred mackerel. Phil, 
fishing in two feet of water, brought ashore a 50-pound trev-ally. 
</P>
<P>
Eight-year-old Christopher Powell of Gardena, on his first fishing trip aboard 
the Annie B barge, caught a 8 1/2-pound sand bass, one of the largest landed on 
the barge this year. 
</P>
<P>
Grunion become legal to grab again June 5-8. It is a guessing game as to the 
time of night and on which South Bay beach the squirming silvers will come 
ashore. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: Robin Wu of Long Beach, fishing aboard the Pacifica, caught 
a 28-pound white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Alan McFretridge of Marina del Rey won the jackpot aboard the Blackjack with 
his 23-pound white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Lou Campozano of Gardena, fishing aboard the First String, caught a 
22-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Warne of Torrance won the jackpot aboard the Condor with his 20-pound 
lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Busiolia of Manhattan Beach won the jackpot aboard the Victory with an 18 
1/2-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports:

<P>
For state leaders Brent Noon, Lenny McGill and Kira Jorgensen, the challenge is 
to stay on top. For other state track and field championship meet participants 
from the San Diego Section, it is to get there. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, the challenge starts this afternoon at Cerritos College with the 
state preliminaries, field events at 3 and the running events at 5. The finals 
begin Saturday at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Jorgensen, the Rancho Buena Vista senior, will arrive in a defensive mood; for 
two consecutive years, she has run away with the girls' 1,600-meter 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
To win again, she will have to beat defending state 3,200 champion Karen Hecox 
of West Covina South Hills. Jorgensen has the national best of 4:53.66, but 
Hecox is right behind at 4:53.94. Jorgensen will also run the 3,200, in which 
she has a season best of 10:34.7 (behind Reyna Cervantes of Montebello, 
10:32.89; Hecox has run 10:41.23). 
</P>
<P>
Noon, the Fallbrook junior who has used the 12-pound shotput to gain widespread 
acclaim -- and the national lead of 69-feet-8 1/4 -- is nearly seven feet ahead 
of his nearest competitor. 
</P>
<P>
But winning the event in which he was third last year is secondary for Noon. 
What he really wants, and what has been long anticipated, is a throw of more 
than 70 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm on track to throw 70 feet for (this weekend)," Noon said after last week's 
section finals, where he threw 66-7 despite being bothered by stomach pain. 
"But I may never throw 69 feet again." 
</P>
<P>
Noon will also compete in the discus, in which his 185-4 is fifth best in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
McGill's state lead in the triple jump is a bit more precarious than Noon's in 
the shot; in fact, he is only an inch ahead of his nearest competitor, Phouphet 
Singbandith of Magnolia. 
</P>
<P>
(Noon's nation-leading shotput and McGill's triple jump, third best in the 
United States this season, were set at the Palomar League dual meet May 4 at 
Fallbrook.) 
</P>
<P>
Now, about the lesser-known athletes: 
</P>
<P>
Pole vaulter Brian Chase of Granite Hills has been showing upward mobility all 
season and is an inch away from the state leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Chase is officially third with a vault of 15-5. The two ahead of him, Tim Pust 
and Shane Woll, both of Modesto, are tied at 15-6. 
</P>
<P>
The feeling among coaches is that the winning vaulter will have to go higher 
than 15-6. 
</P>
<P>
"But pole vaulting is a funny thing," warned Jim Hunter, Chase's vault coach. 
"It all depends on what the wind is like and what the competition is like. 
</P>
<P>
"Brian's capable of going over 15-6." 
</P>
<P>
Long jumper Jerome Price of University City is a 1 1/2 inches from the state 
lead; besides the first-place medal, Price will be going for a season-long goal 
of 25 feet. His best is 24-6 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Price says 25-2 is not an unreasonable expectation. "I won't be doing any 
running events," he explained. "I usually run the 100, 200 and the (400) relay. 
So (Saturday) I shouldn't be as tired as I usually am." 
</P>
<P>
Distance runner Francis O'Neill will go for titles in the 1,600 and the 800 -- 
and possibly the 3,200, depending on how he has left. O'Neill is fourth in the 
state in the 800 (1:52.16), and is fifth in the 1,600 (4:12.89). He finished 
fourth in the state 1,600 last year.

CORONADO MAN ADVANCES IN PIANO CONTEST;

Coronado pianist Kevin Kenner is one of 12 semifinalists in the 1989 Van 
Cliburn International Piano Competition, which began May 27 in Ft. Worth, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old local musician also holds the distinction of being the sole 
American among the fortunate dozen who will be competing for the prestigious 
Cliburn gold medal, which will be awarded June 11. 
</P>
<P>
Competition officials, who announced the names of the semifinalists Wednesday 
evening, expressed some surprise that only one American made it to the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 40 pianists who were invited to compete in this eighth Van Cliburn 
Competition, 38 went to Ft. Worth to compete. Ten of the 38 were Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Among the semifinalists, three were from the Soviet Union, two from China. 
There was one semifinalist each from France, Portugal, Italy, Canada, Brazil 
and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to competitions, Kenner is no novice. He won the 1987 New York 
Chopin International Competition grand prize, as well as top honors in the 1983 
Kosciuszko Foundation National Chopin Competition. 
</P>
<P>
He also won the 1982 Masterplayers International Piano Competition in Spain. A 
graduate of Baltimore's Peabody Conservatory, Kenner is a protege of Leon 
Fleischer. 
</P>
<P>
In his second preliminary recital May 31, Kenner played Mozart's F Major 
Sonata, K. 332, Rachmaninoff's Second Sonata, Op. 36, and Alban Berg's Sonata 
Op. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The next round of performances will narrow the competition to six pianists by 
June 6. Each semi-finalist will play an hour-long solo recital, in addition to 
a piano quintet with the Tokyo String Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
Though the semifinalists choose their own repertory for their solo recitals, 
each will play a new composition, Variations on the American Tune "Chester" by 
William Schumann. Cliburn contestants received the score to the new work March 
31. 
</P>
<P>
Held every four years, the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition is 
considered by many to be the American equivalent to Moscow's prestigious 
Tchaikovsky International Competition. 
</P>
<P>
The Cliburn gold medalist will be awarded a $15,000 cash prize, a Carnegie Hall 
recital, and an American and European orchestral and recital tour.

"Love and death, that's really all I ever think about," Beth Henley said in a 
recent interview with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Make that love and death seen through the eyes of quirky, sometimes repressed, 
depressed or wildly uninhibited characters in "Crimes of the Heart" and "The 
Miss Firecracker Contest." 
</P>
<P>
Make that more death than love as seen through the eyes of the characters in 
"The Wake of Jamie Foster," playing at the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre's Hahn 
Cosmopolitan through July 23. 
</P>
<P>
That isn't just death as in lying in a pine coffin as Jamie does right in the 
middle of the Foster family parlor. It's death as in working in a stultifying 
bank job. Death as in living in a loveless marriage. Death as in feeling 
worthless with no hope. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, this being a Henley play, even the ruminations on death are funny at 
times. And insightful. And healing. It's all right to be angry at the dead, she 
seems to say. It's all right to spill food, wear the wrong clothes, mourn in 
your own unconventional ways. An actress before she started writing, Henley 
knows how to write parts that actors can alternately use to steal a laugh, then 
draw a tear. 
</P>
<P>
Part of what keeps "The Wake" from being a tragedy is that, rather like Poor 
Jud in "Oklahoma," nobody seemed to like Jamie Foster -- not even his family. 
</P>
<P>
Foster's widow, Marshael (Donna Walker), still has not forgiven him for walking 
out on their unhappy marriage a few months before he was killed by being kicked 
in the head by a cow. His brother, Wayne Foster (Paul Eggington), trapped in a 
financially but not spiritually rewarding job, has not forgiven him for being 
his mother's favorite. Marshael's sister and brother, Collard and Leon, just 
seem to have disliked him on general principle. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, Foster conjures memories of the never-seen politico husband who got 
shot in Henley's "Crimes of the Heart." He's so despicable that pity seems 
inappropriate. Except in "Crimes," the husband recovers. Here, there is a 
nagging sense that he's dead because the playwright thought that someone that 
bad ought to be dead. There's an uncomfortable scent of vengeance about the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Director Will Simpson guides a skillful cast through the twists and turns of a 
circuitous script only to reveal that sparkle alone can't disguise the fact 
that there is nowhere to go. 
</P>
<P>
The play, like its dead hero, has some fatal flaws -- a lack of focus and a 
lack of a burning question to drive the action. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The play feels as if it ought to belong to the widow, but exquisite as Donna 
Walker is as the depressed Marshael, the writing does not stay on her. As if 
nervous about focusing on a depressed character, Henley seems to hedge her bits 
by drifting to livelier people, even if their stories are not quite related to 
what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
But the worst crime here is that nothing much happens. In "Miss Firecracker," 
we wonder if Carnelle will win or lose the contest, if Elaine will go back to 
her husband, if Popeye will get Delmount and if Delmount will sell the house. 
In "Crimes," we wonder why Babe shot her husband and why Lenny turned down her 
only beau and if Meg will get something going with her old flame Doc again. 
</P>
<P>
"The Big Chill" may have generated a story on the basis of a reunion over a 
dead body, but even that movie posed the question of whether people who had 
achieved closeness in an era as dead as their deceased friend, could find 
closeness again. 
</P>
<P>
The characters in "The Wake of Jamie Foster" were never close. There are no 
burning questions or resolutions. There is charm personified in Pixrose Wilson, 
played like a true pixie by Gabrielle Sinclair -- who tells of her lifelong 
travails at the hands of arsonists with such cheer. There is the irresistible 
fatality Ann Dauber brings to Collard, portraying her as a lovely, long-legged 
accident about to happen. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Seitchik brings depth, if not age to the role of Marshael's wizened old 
suitor, Brocker Slade. David Grant Wright is the quintessential pixie-mate to 
Pixrose (quite a leap from his last role at the Hahn as the threatening Cowboy 
in "I'm Not Rappaport.") Paul Eggington and Rebecca Nachison are well-matched 
as the up-tight Wayne and (appropriately named) 'Katty' Foster. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Earl creates a smashing, split-level structure for the house and then 
lays down a triangular strip of green fabric to represent the yard outside. No 
matter how you cut it, it is too hard to buy someone trying to scale the 
outside wall to a bedroom when he's just inches from the staircase that leads 
to that same bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
It's part of the essential confusion that keeps the several stories here from 
jelling into a play. Some of the fragments, like the widow's speech to the 
body, are quite beautiful and some, like Collard's comparison of a dead fetus 
to a bucket of fried chicken, are unforgivably awful. 
</P>
<P>
But the greatest cause for mourning in this wake is that not all the fine work 
on stage or off, by the fine GQT designers (Catherine L. Meacham on costumes, 
Matthew Cubitto, lighting and Lawrence Czoka, sound), can pull the fragments 
together into a cohesive whole. 
</P>

PREVIEW: LOUIS BELLSON LAUNCHES SUMMER CONCERT SERIES AT WARNER CENTER PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RODNEY BOSCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Louis Bellson and His Big Band Explosion will kick off a 16-week program of 
free summer concerts in Warner Center Park at 5:30 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The "Summer Concerts in the Park" series is sponsored by the Valley Cultural 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1950s, Bellson, best known as a drummer, played with Benny Goodman, 
Count Basie and Duke Ellington. His trademark is his innovative use of two bass 
drums. 
</P>
<P>
Bellson is also well-known as a bandleader and composer of jazz, rock and 
fusion music, and romantic ballads. 
</P>
<P>
His daughter, recording artist Dee Dee Bellson, will perform with the band 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Now in its 14th season, the concert series features music and dance 
entertainment, including jazz and classical favorites, Latin, country and 
Western, and bluegrass music. 
</P>
<P>
"We attract anywhere from 1,500 to 4,000 people of all ages and life styles 
every Sunday to Warner Park," said Clyde Porter, Valley Cultural Center 
president. "It really is a family event. Folks spread out the blanket, set up 
the lawn chairs and start in on their picnic dinner. You can even spot a few 
candelabras; it's kind of a scene right out of the Boston Pops." 
</P>
<P>
Founded by a dozen local businessmen and three people from the arts community, 
the Valley Cultural Center held its first free summer concert in 1975 on a 
barren dirt lot that became Warner Center Park. The 1982 and 1983 concert 
seasons were held at Shadow Ranch Park in West Hills while Warner Center Park 
was under construction. In 1984, the series returned to Warner Center Park. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit Valley Cultural Center has an annual budget of about $85,000 to 
pay for the series. About 100 corporate sponsors provide most of the center's 
budget. Other revenue comes from the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department 
and public donations. 
</P>
<P>
For two years, the Valley Cultural Center has provided funding for 
musical-instrument instruction programs at Serrania Avenue School in Woodland 
Hills and Calhoun School in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"The regular state funding had been cut from the budget and there was a real 
fear that students would grow up without an appreciation for music and the 
arts, so the center intervened and picked up the slack," Porter said. 
</P>
<P>
The center provides about $10,000 annually to support the programs. 
</P>
<P>
The center is planning a free five-week run of Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" 
next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Summer Concerts in the Park" runs Sundays through Sept. 17. Shows begin at 
5:30 p.m. except for September concerts, which start at 4:30 p.m. Warner Center 
Park is at 5800 Topanga Canyon Blvd., Woodland Hills. For information or a free 
calendar of events, call (818) 704-1358. RODNEY BOSCH

AT THE GALLERIES / DAVID LEWINSON: EXPLORATION OF THE SEXES BOGS DOWN IN 
POLITENESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Lewinson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Good manners can get in the way of good art. Demonstrating this are Carole 
Laventhol's new paintings, "The Gaia Series," on view at Mesa College Art 
Gallery. The series explores the female/male duality as both a sexual and a 
metaphysical opposition, but it does so too politely to bring forth anything 
particularly compelling or new. 
</P>
<P>
"Anima-Animus," of 1989, directly states Laventhol's concerns in its title, 
using terminology for female and male popularized by Carl Jung. It represents 
this polarity with two stone-like forms, one rounded and one rectilinear. Their 
physical relationship on the canvas can be described as touching, nudging or, 
maybe, penetrating. If the latter, the union is a cool and very discreet one. 
</P>
<P>
The same reticence restrains the 1987 painting, "Eidolon," and "Innerspace II" 
of 1988. These use contrasts of light and dark colors, smooth and rough 
surfaces, and compositions of paired forms to express the artist's idea of 
interacting opposites. This represents a very familiar game in abstract 
painting. In the comfort of this familiarity, novel expression and impact are 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of these geometric works are so aloof, however. In "Attracting Chaos" 
of 1988 an orb and a spiked ribbon shape generate a visual tension that 
appropriately suggests the excitation inherent in their apparently imminent 
union. It is noteworthy, though, how the title suggests the attitude of the 
artist concerning this prospect. The prediction of "chaos" in the title, with 
its implication of undesirable outcomes, raises a question of whether the 
artist is uncomfortable with certain aspects of what she's dealing with: that 
in the contrast between the erotic as a physical reality and the erotic as a 
metaphysical reality, she is at ease with the latter, but discomforted by the 
former. 
</P>
<P>
This resulting distancing from possibly impolite passions even has its 
equivalent in the artist's handling of materials. Her thick paints, and the raw 
edges of the large, unstretched canvases suggest an indulgence in sensuality. 
Yet the colors throughout are kept uniformly cool. This is not so unexpected in 
the blues, greens and earth tones that pervade the work, but seems peculiar in 
the reds, which are warm at best, but never hot. 
</P>
<P>
On top of this, all the images are coated with a slick, clear glaze that acts 
like Saran Wrap. For the eye, this closes off contact with the physical stuff 
of paint and canvas the way a glove gets in the way of holding hands. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps recognizing what was happening in the paintings, the most recent works 
in the series, all produced this year, reveal Laventhol incorporating figures, 
primarily female ones, into her imagery. In "Venus," she reproduces the 
30,000-year-old "Venus of Willendorf." This tiny statuette of a very robust 
female was created deep in the past, where one imagines that primal forces 
operated much more directly on human life than they do today. 
</P>
<P>
Partly because of this knowledge, the image, in Laventhol's painting, fairly 
clobbers one over the head as a symbol of femaleness both literal and primal. 
Laventhol presents this ancient Venus as a giantess placed in front of a series 
of archways that closely quote another source: a painting by the Italian 
surrealist De Chirico. It is not difficult to ascribe male attributes to the 
architectural elements of Laventhol's painting and then to contrast these with 
the complementary aspects trumpeted by the female figure. But nothing comes of 
this because the maleness and femaleness don't meet. They're separated by a 
rigid screen of color and surface effects that locks each into quite disparate 
spaces. So much for the spice of life. 
</P>
<P>
A similar isolation of elements occurs in "Discomposed Woman," in which a nude, 
richly rounded female appears merged into a slab of pale stone. Above the slab 
is a smaller, blue, stone form next to which are the head and shoulder of a 
shadowy figure that may or may not be male. Surprising here is the way the head 
of the female is cropped off by her fit into the stone slab. Feminists 
generally find such treatment offensive and sexist for emphasizing women as 
objects at the cost of their full humanity. 
</P>
<P>
To the extent that this is the issue Laventhol is focusing on, it represents a 
retreat from her broader concerns in favor of the more specific territory of 
real interactions between real people. As an illustration of sexist attitudes 
and consequences, the painting is effective but leaves one wondering where the 
artist's passions are in all of this. 
</P>
<P>
The one work that goes beyond this limitation is "God's a Woman." Here, a nude 
female sits on the bottom of the painting's edge, facing into the space of the 
scene, where she confronts a dark shadow image of herself. This black shape 
appears joined to a massive crucifix that looms across the format on a bold 
diagonal. Beyond this, a dim face emerges from the painting's gray background. 
However, this face seems superfluous because the interaction of the fleshy and 
shadowy figures and the weighty cross possess so much more drama. Here one sees 
a self directly confronting itself, both physically and spiritually. 
</P>
<P>
The image is private and universal simultaneously. In it, Laventhol brushes 
aside simplistic politeness and seems personally invested for the first and 
only time in this exhibition. The return on her investment is a compelling work 
that begins to fully enter the domains that she otherwise only scratches the 
surface of in the "Gaia Series." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition continues through June 16 at Mesa College Art Gallery, which has 
done commendable work in organizing the show and publishing a 42-page 
illustrated catalogue that thoughtfully surveys this San Diego artist's past 
and current work.

ASSEMBLYMAN BRADLEY IS DEAD OF CANCER AT 70 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republican Assemblyman Bill Bradley of San Marcos died early Thursday after a 
nearly four-year battle with cancer. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
A low-keyed legislator during his seven years representing the 76th District, 
which covers northeastern San Diego County and parts of southern Riverside 
County, Bradley was perhaps best-known for his ardent advocacy of private 
property rights. 
</P>
<P>
That stance often put him in conflict with environmentalists over such issues 
as development of coastal farmland, coastal access, toxic wastes and growth 
control. One of his favorite targets was the California Coastal Commission, 
which is charged with regulating development in the coastal zone. 
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken, frank assemblyman seldom drew attention as he toiled quietly 
for his pet projects, which his staff members said included funding for 
dyslexic children and an attempt to require the death penalty for anyone 
convicted of killing a child 7 years or younger. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Was Civil Engineer 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a wild-eyed missionary up here," Bradley said in a 1987 interview. "I 
don't go off on flaming causes. I don't scream about it and hold press 
conferences." 
</P>
<P>
A civil engineer by profession, Bradley was more at home with the mundane 
nuts-and-bolts of government. His grooming in public service came as an 
administrator -- first as assistant city manager of Imperial Beach, then as 
city manager and city engineer of San Marcos from 1972 to 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of what we're accomplishing today were his goals -- the road 
improvements, the plans for the civic center which we hope to break ground on 
by the end of the year," said San Marcos Mayor Lee Thibadeau. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Bill Craven (R-Oceanside), whom Bradley succeeded as San Marcos' top 
city administrator, said: "He had a basic, rudimentary knowledge of government 
from the letter 'A.' He knew all the things that had to be done and he knew how 
to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's background bred his suspicion of how government administrators 
treated private property owners. 
</P>
<P>
"Having been a former bureaucrat, I know how they think," he said after his 
first attack on the Coastal Commission. "They have no regard for private 
property. They have no regard for the cost of development." 
</P>
<P>
With Craven as his political mentor, Bradley won election to the Assembly in 
1982 from a district that is nearly 55% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after he was elected in 1982, Bradley led an unsuccessful charge to 
dismantle the state coastal agency. When that failed, Bradley successfully won 
passage of legislation that, at the behest of developers, limited the 
commission's hold over agricultural land in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
The move eventually reaped bad publicity for Bradley when it was reported that 
he subsequently received a $3,000 contribution from a developer who stood to 
gain $420,000 in refunded fees because of the legislation. Bradley returned the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bradley set a record as the rookie who introduced the most bills -- in 
excess of 100 -- the former San Marcos city manager concentrated more on 
solving constituent problems, said Herb Williams, Bradley's longtime political 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Worked the District' 
</P>
<P>
"He worked the district, answered the mail, took care of the problems better 
than anybody I have ever seen," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
The attention to voters paid off handsomely, Williams said, when Bradley won 
reelection with a bigger plurality of votes in 1984 than Ronald Reagan received 
for president in the Assembly district. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's biggest legislative triumph was passage of a 1985 bill that 
established a three-year pilot program in selected public schools to employ 
special devices to screen for dyslexic children. 
</P>
<P>
That same year Bradley was diagnosed with terminal colon and liver cancer. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Bradley announced he would serve out his term and retire. But he 
changed his mind after coming through a successful operation to remove parts of 
his colon and implant a pump to provide direct chemotherapy to his liver. 
</P>
<P>
"The cancer was in remission, and he said, 'I'm OK. I shall go ahead and run,' 
" Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's fortitude prompted many people to call his office and ask what kept 
him going, said Barbara Downs, his secretary. Inundated by the requests, he 
drafted an open memo that methodically detailed how he overcame his fear of 
death by researching sometimes exotic cancer cures and by relying on his 
Christian faith. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as two weeks ago, Bradley was talking about returning to his desk 
in Sacramento despite another stay in the hospital, said Assemblyman Richard 
Mountjoy (R-Monrovia). 
</P>
<P>
"It was like everything in life, he was always positive," said Mountjoy, who 
added that he often talked to Bradley about dealing with death. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley died in his sleep at his San Marcos home shortly after 4 a.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of Bradley's death prompted tributes to the late legislator in 
San Diego County and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a person of great humility and a great deal of graciousness, and I 
think love for not only what he did but for people in general," said Craven. 
"You could not know or associate with Bill Bradley without liking him. He was a 
very delightful man." 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, who was en route Thursday to a college reunion in New 
York, now has 14 days to call for a special election to fill Bradley's spot. A 
primary will be held about two months from that point and, if no candidate 
garners more than 50% over the vote, a general election featuring the top vote 
getters from either party after that. 
</P>
<P>
Among those expected to run for the seat is Escondido Councilman Ernie Cowan, 
who said he will form an exploratory committee within the next two weeks to 
test the waters for a possible campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Others being mentioned as candidates are Chula Vista Mayor Greg Cox, whose 
South Bay city is in the 76th District; Poway Council Member Linda Brannon, and 
David Barber, Bradley's administrative assistant. None of them could be reached 
for comment late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley is the third state legislator to die in the last year after a fight 
with cancer. Three other Assembly members have been diagnosed as having various 
forms of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley is survived by his wife, Margaret, and two daughters, Billye Brown of 
Napa and Randy Bradley of Salinas, Downs said. The funeral will be at 11 a.m. 
Monday at the Emmanuel Faith Church, 639 E. Felicita Ave. in Escondido, she 
said.

NEW VOTE ORDERED ON PHONE BID PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor on Thursday ordered a new vote on the process used to 
consider bids for a lucrative government telephone contract, a session at which 
she will abstain from voting because of her financial interest in one of the 
companies seeking the contract. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's directive came after The Times reported the possibility that 
O'Connor and two San Diego City Council members violated state 
conflict-of-interest laws when they voted on a decision concerning 
communications companies in which all three have financial interests. 
</P>
<P>
Although there appears to be no way that the council members themselves could 
profit from the vote, state law requires public officials to disqualify 
themselves from decisions that may have a foreseeable financial effect on 
companies in which they have investments. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the state Fair Political Practices Commission, stressing that 
she could offer no conclusion in this case without all the facts or a formal 
complaint, said Wednesday that the matter appeared to meet all the criteria of 
a decision from which O'Connor and council members Bruce Henderson and Abbe 
Wolfsheimer should have distanced themselves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Conflict Existed' 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's press secretary, Paul Downey, said the mayor "firmly believes no 
conflict existed" but will abstain when the matter is heard again Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"She doesn't want even the hint that any conflict was out there . . . ," Downey 
said. "She will abstain just to make it absolutely clear in the public mind 
that she is very sensitive to the issue of conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, who along with Wolfsheimer reported financial interests in one of 
bidding companies, said Thursday that he will not decide whether to abstain 
until he receives advice from City Atty. John Witt. Witt's staff is expected to 
release an opinion today. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson again maintained that he was not guilty of any conflict, but said 
that he was glad the question had been raised since it will spur discussions 
with Witt's office about conflicts for council members in other matters. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfsheimer could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The FPPC has received no complaint on the matter and is not investigating, 
spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said Thursday. Many considerations are involved in 
whether an "enforcement action" is taken, she said, including council members' 
intent, mitigating circumstances, whether any harm was done and whether a 
pattern of violations can be determined. 
</P>
<P>
The council Tuesday voted to reconsider all seven bidders for a $12-million to 
$18-million citywide telephone contract. The action was recommended by the 
city's data-processing corporation, a nonprofit group established by the 
council that has sole authority to select the company that will provide the 
telephone system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Council Pressure 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation came after pressure from a majority of council members who, 
at a May 16 meeting, questioned the selection process and threatened to disband 
the data-processing corporation if all seven bidders were not reconsidered. 
</P>
<P>
The data-processing corporation had selected Tel Plus Communications for the 
contract and was ready to begin negotiations with the company until the council 
intervened. 
</P>
<P>
In her statement of economic interests, O'Connor reported owning more than 
$100,000 in bonds of General Electric Capital, a subsidiary of General Electric 
Corp., which is parent company of one of the bidders, RCA. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson reported holdings of $10,000 to $100,000 in GTE Corp., parent company 
of one of the bidders, General Telephone Co. of California. Wolfsheimer owns 
600 shares of GTE. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor and Henderson noted that they were not present at the May 16 meeting 
when the council first intervened to force a change in the selection process 
and both have vocally opposed the move to interfere led by Councilman Ron 
Roberts and Wolfsheimer. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't even in the country" for the vote, said O'Connor, who was vacationing 
in Europe on May 16 but had her chief of staff, Ben Dillingham, read a 
statement against intervention. "I don't know how I got on the short end of 
this one, but somehow I managed to do it."

AGENT, SUSPECT WOUNDED DURING SHOOTOUT AT PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A drug bust erupted into gunfire Thursday night at Golden Hill Park, leaving a 
federal agent hospitalized and his assailant in serious condition with wounds 
to the neck and leg. 
</P>
<P>
Two other men were arrested during the alleged drug deal and shooting, which 
surprised and startled park visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred about 6 p.m. when Tony Campbell, an undercover Drug 
Enforcement Agent, exchanged money for 20 ounces of heroin allegedly sold by 
Miguel Angel Flores-Palbar, 21, and Jesus Alberto Gutierrez-Corrales, 29, both 
of Culiacan, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, working with a multiagency anti-drug task force, then gave the arrest 
signal to his colleagues, according to Charles Hill, special agent-in-charge of 
the DEA's San Diego office. But a lookout for the alleged drug dealers, Luciano 
Pulido-Barela, believed to be 36, saw what was happening, pulled out a 
.45-caliber handgun and, according to Hill, shot Campbell in the chest from 15 
to 20 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
The bullet, however, was deflected by Campbell's bulletproof vest. Knocked down 
by the impact, Campbell got up and began chasing Pulido through the park, which 
is located at 25th and A streets. He was joined by other agents of the task 
force, made up of DEA, U.S. Customs, Border Patrol and California Highway 
Patrol officers, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
Several bystanders in the park witnessed the chase, and their presence caused 
the agents to withhold their gunfire, Hill said, but Pulido continued firing at 
the officers as he fled. When they were clear of the park-goers, the agents 
fired at Pulido, hitting him in the neck and leg.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OCEANSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman who gave birth to twins despite an abortion attempt was placed on five 
years' probation Thursday for child endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
Vickie Judkins, 24, of Oceanside was ordered by San Diego Municipal Judge H. 
Ronald Domnitz to perform 160 hours of volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
Judkins has already performed 100 hours of volunteer work in a soup kitchen in 
Oceanside and was given credit for that. She was fined $100 and given credit 
for one day previously spent in jail. No further jail time was imposed, and 
none was requested by the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Judkins pleaded guilty March 21 to child endangerment involving the Dec. 30, 
1987, birth of one of the twins. 
</P>
<P>
She testified against her mother, Ida Franks, 47, of Oceanside, who is charged 
with manslaughter and child abuse. Judkins said her mother who used a 
Lysol-soaked straw on her days before the births in an attempt to induce an 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy Dist. Atty. Harry Elias said the charges stem from conduct that 
occurred after the births, not from the botched abortion attempt. Judkins said 
one baby was born dead and the other child died, allegedly at her mother's 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the infants were disposed of and never found. Judkins told 
authorities that her husband and her mother put them in a trash bin off 
Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
Domnitz ordered that if Judkins becomes pregnant again she must consult a 
doctor and seek counseling. She has two other children. 
</P>
<P>
A trial date of June 23 has been set for Franks. She has pleaded innocent and 
remains free on her own recognizance.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: PERIODIC SPICING-UP OF MENU GIVES PIRETM THE TOUCH 
IT WAS MISSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Piret's story is one of the more convoluted sagas in our regional 
restaurant lore. 
</P>
<P>
The original Piret's introduced the city to French cafe food when it began 
serving a menu of pates, composed salads and bistro classics in Mission Hills 
in 1978. To many, Piret's was a kind of gustatory prologue to the widening of 
dining options that ensued through the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
To a degree, Piret's did for San Diego restaurant patrons what Julia Child did 
for home cooks by making a complicated cuisine accessible and familiar. In the 
words of one observer, "Piret's made everything possible." That seems a fair 
assessment because Piret's smoothed the path for the purveyors of nouvelle and 
California cuisines, and for such unusual new entries as Gustaf Anders, which 
in local terms seemed almost Martian when it opened in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grew Into a Chain 
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of proprietors Piret and George Munger, the restaurant 
expanded into a chain with five county locations as well as outlets in Orange 
County and Beverly Hills. A shaky financial situation, however, resulted in its 
sale in 1986 to Vicorp, which controlled a number of restaurant chains and 
which itself divided and spawned a new, San Diego-based firm called Paragon 
Restaurant Group. Within a relatively brief time, the more marginal Piret's 
locations were closed or sold, the handsome downtown outlet was converted into 
a Boathouse (now itself mercifully gone), the Mission Hills cafe was purchased 
by former Vicorp executive Jeanne Driscoll and the Mungers reacquired the 
Encinitas and La Jolla Village Square locations. 
</P>
<P>
To reestablish their presence at the Encinitas cafe, the Mungers added an art 
gallery and revised the name to PiretM Bistro Gallery. The menu remained the 
same, however, and, after a while, began to seem old and stale -- a restaurant 
that had been an innovator seemed too cozy in its niche to rouse itself and try 
something different. 
</P>
<P>
The recent introduction of new, periodically revised menus at PiretM has given 
the place the gastronomic equivalent of a good redecorating job. Some familiar 
items remain, such as the charcuterie (French delicatessen) salads and 
thoughtful designer pizzas. But these can be regarded simply as a background to 
the contemporary French preparations and a number of dishes inspired by the now 
chic Southwestern cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cafe Mood Retained 
</P>
<P>
The cafe mood has been retained by reserving large sections of the menu for 
appetizers, soups, salads and simple dishes, but the list of formal entrees 
also has been made more interesting and comprehensive. Prices seem a touch high 
at the starter end and relatively low for the entrees. As at so many places 
these days, the cost of a dinner for two will vary wildly according to the 
combination of items selected; only the most formal restaurants continue to 
dictate a minimum check by expecting patrons to order a complete dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The appetizer list gets off to a smashing start with a plate of baked oysters 
in a cream sauce enriched with Stilton cheese and bacon. The inclusion of lemon 
juice in the sauce cuts the overall richness and reminds of the presence of the 
oysters under their gaudy and remarkable cloaks. An eggplant and garlic terrine 
(in this case, a light, pate-like loaf) in a fresh tomato sauce comes off even 
better, thanks to the surprise attack on the taste buds by cinnamon and either 
cayenne or chili peppers. This dish admirably combines sharp, sweet and pungent 
flavors. 
</P>
<P>
Other choices in this department include grilled fresh asparagus with a 
lemon-flavored soy sauce (this makes a light, refreshing starter or snack) and 
gravad lax (Scandinavian-style cured salmon) with mustard sauce and cucumber 
salad. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen also does very well with soups, as any sincere and well-intentioned 
bistro should. The red lentil puree is sharpened with a dose of masala (an 
Indian spice mix that gave birth to the Occidental curry powder) and enriched 
with smoked ham, and is a sturdy, savory soup. A cabbage soup offered as one 
evening's special seemed rather wintry for this time of year, but was likeable 
anyway for its full-flavored broth and bits of tender cabbage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Host of Filling Salads 
</P>
<P>
Many of the salads can easily double as main dishes, including the spit-roasted 
chicken with vegetables and aioli (garlic mayonnaise), the grilled salmon salad 
and the chicken, walnut and apple salad with Waldorf dressing that, if it 
contained celery, would be a Waldorf salad with chicken. 
</P>
<P>
The pizza and pasta list continues to include the "breakfast" pizza, so named 
because George Munger likes to eat it cold at breakfast. With its cheese, 
tomato sauce and pepperoni topping, it remains the most classic of the lot and 
is indeed quite tasty. Examples that go further afield include a pie decorated 
with lamb sausage and grape leaves, and a Mexican-style combination of roast 
chicken, avocado and tomatillo salsa. 
</P>
<P>
Among the pastas, the linguine with rosy slices of grilled lamb filet, feta 
cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, olives and Madeira sauce, all scented with 
rosemary, is a combination that would be Greek to the Italians, as it is to us. 
This dish may be pungent and is not recommended to the timid, but it is also as 
delicious as it is unusual. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expanded Entree List 
</P>
<P>
The expanded entree list begins on a Southwestern footing with chicken and corn 
bread with yellow red bell pepper coulis (a type of puree), and sauteed slices 
of turkey breast with an herbed tomatillo sauce. It becomes more generally 
American with Munger's Meatloaf, a sturdy loaf dressed up with caramelized 
onions and bordelaise sauce that was, unfortunately, too like the school 
cafeteria classic. Overloaded with filler, it had a tough, grainy texture and 
something of a steam-table flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Among much happier offerings were a classic and classy pepper steak that could 
be -- and was -- cut with a fork, and a plate of choucroute garni, or deeply 
savory sauerkraut garnished with a healthy variety of sausages. Fish is offered 
on a daily list, and a sauteed slab of salmon was respectable, if not 
ravishing, under its light sauce of white wine, shallots, lemon and butter. 
</P>
<P>
Piret's always prided itself on its lengthy selection of homemade desserts and 
continues the practice with the new PiretM menu. In addition to such well-made 
standbys as chocolate mousse and creme brulee, there is a tray brimming with 
pastries, most in the chocolate mood that seems to hold the sweet-eating public 
enthralled at present. One of these days, someone is going to rediscover 
coconut, fruits and Bavarian creams. The chocolate truffle cake is every bit as 
rich as it sounds, however, and the cherries jubilee tart cleverly engages 
cherries, custard, chocolate and nuts in a good, toothsome crust. 
</P>
<P>
The wine list, which includes a long selection of wines by the glass, also 
continues to be excellent.

WEATHER FORECAST: MORE JUNE GLOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Weather for the month of June is following the norm: night and morning low 
clouds, with either afternoon clearing or partial clearing, the National 
Weather Service said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
With May and June usually being the cloudiest months of the year, the 
now-familiar weather pattern is expected to continue for at least 10 more days, 
forecaster Ray Robben said. 
</P>
<P>
The morning cloud cover will be slightly heavier this weekend because of the 
onshore flow of marine air. The cover should break by noon. 
</P>
<P>
The beaches will have low clouds and fog in the mornings, becoming partly 
cloudy in the afternoons, Robben said. Temperatures at the beaches are expected 
to be in the mid-60s throughout the weekend, with sea breezes from 10 to 16 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
There will be some patchy fog as well in the coastal and inland areas, clearing 
by afternoon. Coastal temperatures are expected to range in the 70s this 
weekend, with overnight lows in the low 50s. The inland valleys will reach the 
high 70s and fall to the mid- to low 50s. 
</P>
<P>
The mountain and deserts will remain fair through Saturday, with gusty winds. 
Mountain areas will range in the low 70s, dropping to 40 to 47 nightly. Deserts 
may hit 100 degrees and should bottom out in the 60s overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Surf is 2 to 3 feet at 10-second intervals. Water temperature is about 64 
degrees.

TRIAL OF CROSS-BURNING STUDENTS URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State park authorities said Thursday that they will call for the prosecution of 
each of the 27 University of San Diego fraternity members who participated in a 
cross-burning ritual last month that threatened the rare trees of Torrey Pines 
State Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, rangers said they would level misdemeanor charges only against one 
or two members of Sigma Chi fraternity -- those considered most responsible for 
the act. But, upon further investigation of the incident that occurred on May 
20, authorities determined that each participant is equally at fault. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that everyone who was there shares equal blame," said Jim Van Schmus, 
chief ranger for the San Diego Coast District, California Department of Parks 
and Recreation. "It was not an individual act, it was a group act." 
</P>
<P>
The rangers are recommending that the city attorney charge each of the 27 
participants with two misdemeanor counts: committing a public nuisance, and 
building and using an illegal fire on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It's Up to City Attorney 
</P>
<P>
Van Schmus said the park authorities' report of the incident, including 
prosecution recommendations, will be delivered to the city attorney's office 
early next week. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be up to the city attorney to review the report and determine if 
there's enough evidence to file these charges," Van Schmus said. If such action 
is taken, and the fraternity members are found guilty, each participant could 
face a maximum sentence of six months in County Jail and/or a maximum fine of 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
According to authorities, the fraternity members entered the reserve late at 
night and planted a wooden cross on an isolated bluff overlooking the beach. 
Then, as part of an initiation rite, they ignited the cross, which was wrapped 
in bedding material drenched in gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
The cross burning, which fraternity members maintain was not racially motivated 
or cult-linked, was quickly condemned by university officials, who have 
promised to take disciplinary measures against the group. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the incident, Sigma Chi members released a written apology for 
their actions. The ritual "was meant to inspire our new associates. Obviously, 
the fiery cross, a symbol which Sigma Chi legend states is rooted in a vision 
by Roman emperor Constantine, was not a good choice, and we regret our 
actions," the apology states. "We now realize that to the public this event can 
be perceived in different ways and we have no intentions of ever using it 
again." Members told police at the time that initiates make a list of their 
faults, then burn the list in the fire of the cross. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doesn't Mean a Lot 
</P>
<P>
The fraternity also apologized for the carelessness in starting a fire in the 
natural reserve, which is covered with dry brush and is home to the rare Torrey 
Pine tree. 
</P>
<P>
Such apologies, however, did little to placate park authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't mean a lot to us at this point," Van Schmus said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was offensive to the community, and it interfered with the public enjoyment 
and use of Torrey Pines State Reserve. Beyond that, it endangered the plants 
and trees of Torrey Pines itself. The action we have taken, speaks for itself, 
about how we feel about this incident."

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RAIL RIGHT OF WAY MAY BE SOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern Pacific Transportation Co. has confirmed that it is negotiating to 
sell the former railroad right-of-way that runs for 14 blocks along Normandie 
Avenue in the Harbor Gateway area. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the San Francisco-based company, Gerald Pera, said the 
discussions began "very recently" and it is "much too early" to name the 
potential buyer or disclose a possible sale price. 
</P>
<P>
The narrow strip of land runs from Torrance Avenue to 223rd Street and has been 
vacant since it was discontinued as a train route in 1982. Zoning would permit 
single-family housing, light manufacturing or commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents say motorcyclists occasionally use the strip for a raceway, 
though Harbor Division police report that it receives few complaints about 
problems there. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Gateway community activist Rochelle Bollock said Wednesday that she 
plans to call a meeting of residents who will urge the city to buy the land for 
a park. Niki Tennant, aide to Councilwoman Joan Mike Flores, who represents the 
Harbor Gateway area, says the office has received no comments on the strip in 
at least 18 months.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUILDER MUST COVER HOLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles on Thursday ordered a builder to completely cover deep 
holes drilled for foundation pilings at a construction site for a two-story 
house in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
The open work site at 525 Shepard St., near Pacific Avenue, must either be 
fenced or 24 holes must be covered at night, said Alexander Bruce, manager of 
the San Pedro branch of the Department of Building and Safety. 
</P>
<P>
The order was issued to the home's builder, Atul Jain, who lists a post office 
box in Westchester on permit applications, Bruce said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The home is next to an area that suffered landslides several decades ago and, 
as a result, Jain is building an elaborate foundation, which includes the 24 
holes, ranging in depth from 33 feet to 42 feet. The holes, which are about two 
feet in diameter, will be filled with concrete poured around a steel 
reinforcing frame. 
</P>
<P>
"But now, they're just big holes in the ground that a kid could fall in very 
easily," Bruce said. "So we want them covered up fast."

DESHAIES PITCHES UP A STORM, 7-2; 
</P>
<P>
ASTRO NO-HITS DODGERS FOR 7 2/3 INNINGS BEFORE SETTLING FOR TWO-HITTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HOUSTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the first day of hurricane season, the Dodgers breezed into town for the 
first game of an eight-game trip Thursday night and were promptly blown out of 
the Astrodome by the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
They managed only two hits against left-hander Jim Deshaies, neither of them 
before the eighth inning of a 7-2 loss. 
</P>
<P>
And neither was worth bragging about. 
</P>
<P>
Or as the Dodgers' Mickey Hatcher put it afterward, "Take away two donkey hits 
and he's got a no-hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher ended the no-hit bid with two out in the eighth, sending a grounder 
back through the middle that probably could have been handled by shortstop 
Rafael Ramirez if Deshaies hadn't deflected the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a pitcher's nightmare," Hatcher said. "When I hit it, I (thought) it 
was an out." 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Murray added a bloop single in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the Dodgers were powerless against Deshaies, and not for the first 
time, either. 
</P>
<P>
Deshaies, 28, is 6-0 against the Dodgers at the Astrodome, including a shutout 
on Sept. 23, 1986, when, as a rookie, he struck out the Dodgers' first eight 
batters to establish a modern major league record. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't hit him with a tennis racket," Hatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
If he had completed the no-hitter, Deshaies wouldn't have been the first 
product of LeMoyne College to perform the feat against the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
His former teammate at the school in Syracuse, N.Y., Tom Browning of the 
Cincinnati Reds, pitched a perfect game against the Dodgers last Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
So, who was the ace of the staff that led LeMoyne to the Division II College 
World Series in 1979? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying," Deshaies said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Deshaies wasn't laughing when Hatcher's grounder ricocheted off his glove, 
ending any suspense left in a game the streaking Astros led, 5-0, after scoring 
four unearned runs in the first three innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to say that I was cool and collected," he said, "but I was really 
excited. You don't get too many opportunities to take a no-hitter into the 
eighth inning and you want to take advantage of them." 
</P>
<P>
Deshaies thought he should have stopped Hatcher's grounder. 
</P>
<P>
"I was disappointed, really disappointed," he said. "I thought I should have 
made the play. They ruled it a hit real quick. It was up by the time I turned 
around and looked at the board. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it was a tougher play than I thought. But I think if you get your glove 
on it, you've got a chance to make the play." 
</P>
<P>
Even if Hatcher had lined a pitch off the wall, it wouldn't have been any 
easier to take, Deshaies said. 
</P>
<P>
"Not at the time," he said. "At the time, your immediate reaction is 
disappointment, whether it's a BB off the wall or an infield chopper, but when 
you go back and look at the tape. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"That's probably what will eat at me. We had two chances to get that ball: I 
could have had it, or I could have stayed away and let Raffy have it." 
</P>
<P>
It was a reflex action to stab at it, he said. "You can't just let the ball go 
through," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of the few tough plays for the Astros, whose seven-game winning 
streak equals the longest in the National League this season. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth inning, Jeff Hamilton's check-swing dribbler was mishandled by 
Ramirez for an error, though the call was debatable. It was a tough play, and 
Hamilton might have beaten the throw. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with one out in the eighth, pinch-hitter Rick Dempsey sent a grounder 
through the middle that stuck momentarily in the glove of second baseman Bill 
Doran, whose throw to first base was dug out of the dirt by Glenn Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have overpowering stuff," Deshaies said, "but in my last two starts I 
didn't have real good rhythm, so I was trying to stay real slow with my motion. 
</P>
<P>
"Early on, I was still fighting my slider, trying to get it where I wanted. It 
wasn't until maybe the fourth or fifth that I started to throw consistent 
strikes with my slider and my changeup and could do what I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
And if Deshaies had gotten the no-hitter? 
</P>
<P>
"Scouts all over the league would have been hitting LeMoyne College," he said, 
laughing again. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mike Marshall, who made the trip Wednesday night and took batting practice 
Thursday, is scheduled to return this morning to Los Angeles, where he will be 
examined by back specialist Dr. Robert Watkins. Marshall has missed 11 of 50 
starts this season because of chronic stiffness in his lower back. . . . 
Alfredo Griffin, arguing a called third strike from the dugout after striking 
out in the third inning, was ejected by umpire Paul Runge. . . . Glenn Davis 
scored the Astros' first run in the second inning, kicking the ball out of the 
glove of Dodger catcher Mike Scioscia after Griffin's throw beat Davis to the 
plate. "You go in there timidly and you'll get hurt," Davis said.

S. J. DIAMOND: QUESTIONING THE QUIRKS OF CREDIT CARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. J. DIAMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People are attacking banks again over their credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer advocates complain that some banks apply finance charges from the date 
of a purchase rather than the date it's posted to a cardholder's account, thus 
getting some extra days of interest. A California state court recently ordered 
Wells Fargo Bank to refund $5.2 million to cardholders who were illegally 
overcharged for paying late or exceeding their credit limits. In Alabama, 
there's even a move to tax the profits that out-of-state banks make from 
Alabama cardholders. 
</P>
<P>
This lucrative little side venture of the banking business now handles charge 
volume of $188.3 billion a year, the "largest single source of profit for bank 
holding companies," says David Robertson, vice president of the Nilson Report 
in Santa Monica, a newsletter for the credit card industry. Forty percent of 
that volume goes through the top 10 card issuers. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, consumers, who gladly use and abuse the credit, seem uneasy with it, 
always griping about fees and charges -- at least those they understand. Until 
recently, they focused on interest rates, which now average almost 19% and can 
reach 22%. Banks say such rates are necessary if they are to offer relatively 
easy credit, and they do, marketing their cards more widely now, to less 
qualified people, leading in many cases to greater losses. In fact, some banks, 
says Robertson, have to write off more than 5% of the volume owed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrangements Seem Bizarre 
</P>
<P>
More basic criticisms should suggest themselves. After all these years, it 
still seems a bizarre system of lending money and assessing finance charges. 
Typically, the money advanced by the bank is lent interest-free if the consumer 
pays it all off when due; if he doesn't, it becomes, retroactively, an 
interest-bearing loan. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangements seem equally bizarre. The loan's principal is not, as everyone 
thinks, the amount that was due, but (usually) the unpaid balance of that one 
month, plus the "average daily balance" of the next month's new purchases. 
"I've never understood average daily balance," says Edgar Dworsky, spokesman 
for Massachusetts's Executive Office of Consumer Affairs. "Subtract this and 
add that and take the square root of the distance from here to Geneva." 
</P>
<P>
The minimum payment required on the "loan" may be 1/36th of what's due, or 
1/48th, or perhaps 3% -- amounts that hardly encourage paying it off. And 
interest rates are fixed or variable, although "all rates are actually variable 
because even 'fixed-rate' cards are raised and lowered at will," says Elgie 
Holstein, director of Bankcard Holders of America, a Virginia-based consumer 
group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Soliciting Customers 
</P>
<P>
There are even bizarre ways of soliciting new customers. They may be 
"pre-approved" but need re-approval when they accept the offer. They may also 
have to sign an agreement to abide by terms that won't be sent until later, 
along with the card. 
</P>
<P>
The current gripes are more limited but still provocative. Banks defend the 
practice of applying finance charges from the date of purchase ("transaction 
date") because, having authorized the charge, "we're liable for the purchase 
from the date it's made," a spokesman for Chase Manhattan says. Some point out 
that today's technology may make transaction and posting date the same: A 
merchant's receipts, turned in at day's end, may move through the network, from 
the merchant's bank to the cardholder's bank and be posted to an account the 
same night. 
</P>
<P>
But most banks assume several days' difference, still no big deal to the 
consumer, says a spokesman for Chemical Bank in New York. At a rate of 19.8%, 
that's less than $.05 per day per $100 owed, or $.25 for the "average of five 
days" between purchase and posting. But if half of a big bank's million active 
cardholders pay that 25 cents on just one purchase a month, that's $125,000 for 
the bank that month in extra revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The Wells Fargo case involved about $23 million in late fees and over-limit 
charges assessed cardholders from July, 1982, to May, 1987. The class-action 
suit -- one of several similar suits pending against California banks -- 
challenged the bank's charges for late payment ($3 to $5) and over-limit 
spending ($10), which under California law must reflect the bank's costs. 
Actual costs were much lower, said the plaintiffs, giving the bank an illegal 
profit. The bank claimed that its costs actually exceeded the fees, but the 
jury ordered refunds of $5.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Broad Marketing 
</P>
<P>
Some critics blame today's fees and rates on the broad marketing of cards, 
because the losses on higher-risk accounts must boost the cost of cards to all 
cardholders. But lowering income thresholds isn't necessarily dangerous given 
the sophistication of today's screening, which assesses "other criteria" as 
well, says Mike Sczuka, Wells Fargo executive vice president, including "the 
length of time they're on the credit bureau, the number of retail accounts they 
have, their credit lines and line utilization." 
</P>
<P>
Some have neither income nor past performance. Citibank, says Citibank 
spokesman Bill Ahearn in New York, has 1.5 million college student accounts, 
which are good risks "for deep psychological reasons: They don't want to screw 
up and ruin their credit histories." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Access to Credit 
</P>
<P>
There could be some question whether a person should have his own credit before 
he has his own money, but no one asks it. A basic principle is that credit 
cards are egalitarian, says Robertson, which means "giving everyone access to 
an unsecured line of credit." 
</P>
<P>
Banks have at their hands a simple way to head off the questions that are asked 
-- obscuring their fees. Instead of making the fee for exceeding a credit limit 
of $10, for example, they could use an incomprehensible formula -- perhaps an 
extra 0.02% of the amount by which the overcharge exceeds the average of 12 
months' purchases divided by 27. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers, too, have a simple solution to all credit card charges. They can use 
fewer cards and buy only what they can pay for at the end of a month or two.

FAMED WRITER FRANK DEFORD BEHIND PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
CAN A NATIONAL DAILY SPORTS PAPER BEAT STIFF COMPETITION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS B. ROSENSTIEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The talk in the press boxes began about the time the NBA playoffs started. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrated writer Frank Deford, who had left Sports Illustrated after 27 years, 
was starting a national daily newspaper devoted entirely to sports. And with 
guaranteed three-year contracts and salaries apparently as high as $250,000, 
Deford was getting some of the biggest names in sportswriting to consider 
joining. 
</P>
<P>
Today, a month later, the paper they are calling "the National" is still mostly 
an idea with money behind it, and the idea is to mix the scope and statistics 
of USA Today's sports section with the style and intelligence of Sports 
Illustrated. The owners as yet have neither market surveys nor prototypes, and 
Deford is still interviewing to find a managing editor. 
</P>
<P>
But even so, the National is already causing tremors of worry and expectation 
in sports journalism: Columnist Scott Ostler of the Los Angeles Times is 
considering joining. So is Mike Lupica of the New York Daily News, basketball 
writer Peter Vecsey of the New York Post, college basketball writer and 
best-selling author John Feinstein, and others. Times sports columnist Jim 
Murray has also been approached by the new publication. 
</P>
<P>
The publisher is former New York Post Publisher Peter Price, a Princeton 
classmate of Deford's. The man behind them both is Mexican broadcasting magnate 
Emilio Azcarraga, the most powerful figure in Spanish-language broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
And the essential question behind it is obvious: How deep is the American 
appetite for sports, when the fan can watch ESPN on cable, get his local paper 
and USA Today the next morning and read the Sporting News and Sports 
Illustrated each week? The answer may set a new measure for the financial and 
cultural power of sports in this country. 
</P>
<P>
The other question is more subtle. Does Azcarraga, with all his great wealth 
from TV programming, have the will and financial patience an American national 
newspaper may require? Most consider the venture a long shot and believe that 
unless Azcarraga is willing to risk hundreds of millions of dollars, the answer 
may be no. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that it might be an idea that would work," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
The Times' Ostler is "mulling" the offer and is considered likely to go, as are 
several of the other names mentioned. Of those, only one has confirmed that he 
is leaving: John Feinstein, the former Washington Post writer who struck it 
rich writing a book about Indiana basketball coach Bobby Knight. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the headhunting firm of Youngs, Walker &amp; Co. of Illinois 
interviewed nearly every major sports editor in the country by phone to find a 
managing editor. 
</P>
<P>
They are down to a few finalists, among them John Cherwa of the Los Angeles 
Times, John Rawlings of the San Jose Mercury News and Van McKenzie of the 
Atlanta Journal and Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
But what they would be joining remains speculative. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the paper, which could be either tabloid or full size, to have 
anywhere from 32 to 48 pages "at least six days a week," Price said, all of it 
about sports. It would include a page on business, one on entertainment, and an 
editorial page, according to Deford, and about 25% of the pages would be 
advertising. The paper would cost 50 cents and make use of full color. 
</P>
<P>
There would be three or four national columnists -- two each day -- plus Deford 
writing once a week. 
</P>
<P>
Price is promising a launch "by the end of the year," although insiders say 
that is probably unrealistic. A second target is before the Super Bowl in late 
January next year. 
</P>
<P>
And the paper would start in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles and possibly one 
or two other cities. For each city the paper would include four to eight pages 
of local coverage with two alternating local columnists. New York Times writer 
Peter Alfano has signed on as editor of the New York edition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$100-Million Estimate 
</P>
<P>
The total staff, Price said, would be about 100, most of them editors and 
reporters, with a smaller advertising and business staff. 
</P>
<P>
"You can get the scores on ESPN or USA Today," Deford said. "Here you can get 
everything, including English sentences. Sportswriting is already the best of 
American journalism. This will be the best of the best." 
</P>
<P>
The business plan is sketchier. "We've only been at it for a month now," Price 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Working, he said, on experience and instinct, Price is estimating publicly that 
the paper could require an investment of up to $100 million and would not 
likely begin to turn a profit for five years. 
</P>
<P>
That investment should be adequate, Price believes, because the paper will not 
build printing plants or a distribution network. Instead it will contract for 
those tasks. 
</P>
<P>
But others think $100 million may not be enough, if that is all Azcarraga is 
willing to lose before the National turns a profit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Analysts Not Confident 
</P>
<P>
One of the few start-up national newspapers in decades, USA Today has lost 
close to $600 million since it began in September, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
And that number does not include costs that Gannett was able to absorb by 
borrowing staff and resources from its more than 80 local papers. To date, USA 
Today still has yet to turn a profit for an entire year. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is it will not be that big a property," said J. Kendrick Noble Jr., 
who analyzes the newspaper industry for Paine Webber in New York. "I am not 
confident." 
</P>
<P>
John Morton, a newspaper expert with the brokerage firm of Lynch, Jones &amp; 
Ryan in Washington, said the obstacles to success are enormous. 
</P>
<P>
One is strong competition from high-quality sports sections. And some, such as 
USA Today, are unlikely to let the National evolve without a fight. Despite 
public assurances to the contrary by Gannett, sources at USA Today familiar 
with its marketing research said its sports section is the dominant reason 
people buy that paper. 
</P>
<P>
Second is the costly problem of distribution, by satellite to various areas and 
then regional distribution beyond that. Third are all the other costs of 
starting up, from assigning contracts and assembling staff to buying news 
racks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lots of Talent Involved 
</P>
<P>
Knight-Ridder attempted a sports publication in 1982-83 at the Pasadena 
Star-News called All Sports, which circulated in Southern California. But after 
failing to get adequate circulation and after internal market surveys showed 
little natural advertising market for it, according to Knight-Ridder's Larry 
Jinks, the company dropped it after less than a year. Jinks, now publisher of 
the San Jose Mercury-News, was in charge of the newspaper division at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Does Azcarraga have the necessary resources, financial, managerial and 
editorial? Deford himself is one advantage. "Frank is the pied piper of sports 
journalism," said Washington Post columnist Tony Kornheiser, who is said to be 
talking to Deford about a job but declined to talk about it. "He isn't just the 
key that opens the door. He's the dynamite that blows it off the hinges." 
</P>
<P>
Price's background is largely in magazines. Before joining the New York Post 
about a year ago, Price, who had trained as a lawyer, worked for Time Inc., 
rising to director of corporate development. Later he helped found a magazine 
advertising company which was sold to 3M Co. in 1977 for $20 million. About the 
same time he founded Avenue, a magazine given free to the wealthy on New York's 
Upper East Side. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Recent Idea 
</P>
<P>
Azcarraga is more of a mystery. His resources are vast, but his experience is 
mostly in broadcasting, not newspapers. His company, Univisa, is an American 
arm of a Mexican broadcasting empire that has no parallel in the United States 
and is largely family owned. 
</P>
<P>
The idea began only "four or six months ago," said Price, when he and 
Azcarraga, who knew each other socially, "got around to the subject of why the 
United States didn't have a national sports newspaper like most countries in 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican sports daily Esto, owned by another wealthy Mexican, former UPI 
owner Mario Vazquez Rana, is that country's largest paper in circulation. 
</P>
<P>
After Price left the New York Post in April, he persuaded his former college 
classmate to join. Deford, who has no editing experience, did not even meet 
Azcarraga until two weeks ago in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there are many more breaks in the clouds for newspapers," Deford 
said. "I turned 50 last December and wasn't liable to get this kind of chance 
again."

AMGEN SCIENTIST SPENT YEARS SEARCHING FOR THE KEY TO PRODUCING EPO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One morning before dawn aboutseven years ago, George Rathmann drove to his 
office in a Thousand Oaks industrial park to catch up on his work. 
</P>
<P>
Rathmann, chairman of Amgen Inc., noticed that the lights were on in one of the 
biotechnology company's laboratories and concluded that a careless worker had 
forgotten to shut them off. So he strolled over to the building to do it 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
But inside the laboratory, Rathmann recalled, was Fu-Kuen Lin, a Taiwan-born 
scientist with a Ph.D. in plant pathology who had been hired a year earlier 
after answering a help-wanted ad in a science magazine. Lin, Rathmann 
discovered, had been working through the night on what had become his personal 
obsession -- finding the genetic blueprint for erythropoietin, a protein 
manufactured in the kidney that stimulates the production of red blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
In the years since then, erythropoietin, or EPO, has emerged as one of the most 
promising drugs developed by the nation's fledging biotechnology industry. On 
Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration gave Amgen the go-ahead to sell EPO, 
making it available to thousands of anemic people suffering from chronic kidney 
disease who otherwise would need frequent blood transfusions. More than any 
single person, Lin, now a top-level Amgen researcher, is responsible for the 
breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
"He has an extraordinary energy level and incredible persistence," Rathmann 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the news of the FDA approval is a story of an often lonely struggle Lin 
endured to solve a genetic Rubik's Cube. The task was so cumbersome and 
frustrating that it has been compared to searching through 90 editions of the 
Encyclopedia Britannica to find a single sentence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Set a Deadline 
</P>
<P>
The fifth of seven children born to a Taiwanese herb doctor, Lin, 47, toiled 
for more than two years to unlock the genetic combination to EPO before making 
a breakthrough in mid-1983. All the time his scientific reputation, as well as 
Amgen's reputation in the young biotechnology industry, was on the line. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors abounded that competitors had done what Lin failed to do. Rathmann once 
said that if more promising results weren't achieved in 60 days, the project 
would be scrapped, although he now says he mainly said it to motivate people. 
Still, the talk among some people at Amgen was that working with Lin on the EPO 
project was tantamount to career suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"You could feel the people try to distance themselves from the project," Lin 
said. "Even my assistant was told by the other associates, 'What a dummy you 
are to work with this guy on a project that is going nowhere.' " 
</P>
<P>
Lin rarely saw his wife, two young sons and infant daughter while trying to 
solve the puzzle. Lonely nights in the laboratory were sometimes filled with 
the gentle sound of hymns coming from a Christian ministry group that shared 
the Thousand Oaks building where he had his laboratory, and Lin often worked 
into the early morning. 
</P>
<P>
"People were wondering if it was going to kill Lin. They were joking about EPO 
being a graveyard for scientific careers," said Philip J. Whitcome, Amgen's 
former director of strategic planning who now is president and chief executive 
of Neurogen Corp., a start-up biotechnology company in Branford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Keelung, a port city in Taiwan, Lin moved to the United States in the 
late 1960s to earn his doctorate at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 
under the late David Gottlieb, an internationally known microbiologist. 
Gottlieb became Lin's mentor, sometimes referring to him affectionately as his 
"grand-student." 
</P>
<P>
As with those of many young academics, Lin's career was a nomadic one that 
involved moving from university to university and spending valuable time 
digging up funding for projects that instead could have been devoted to 
research. After receiving his doctorate at Illinois in 1971, Lin and his family 
moved to Purdue University, the University of Nebraska, Academia Sinica in 
Taiwan, Louisiana State University and Medical University of South Carolina. In 
August, 1981, Lin joined Amgen to work on the young company's EPO project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looked for Gene 
</P>
<P>
EPO is a protein produced by the kidney that stimulates immature red blood 
cells. First identified in 1906, scientists tried unsuccessfully for years to 
purify EPO in a laboratory by extracting it from blood, tissue or urine. But 
the amounts contained in those substances are so small that the effort was 
about like trying to mine an ocean for the gold contained in it. 
</P>
<P>
Lin's task was to identify and isolate the gene that encodes human EPO. An EPO 
molecule can be pictured by imagining a string of more than 160 colorful, 
plastic beads similar to the multicolored ones young children play with that 
snap together end to end. Each of the "beads" represents a building block, 
called an amino acid. By identifying the structure of the molecule, Lin was 
able to get a clue as to the set of instructions, or gene, within a human cell 
that directs the production of the EPO protein. 
</P>
<P>
Once that was done, Lin made probes composed of building blocks contained in 
the EPO gene. Those probes would enable him to identify and isolate the gene 
for EPO from all of the other genes and genetic information contained in a 
human cell, a feat Whitcome compares to "finding a sugar cube in a lake one 
mile wide, one mile long and one mile deep." 
</P>
<P>
After two years of painstaking work and unsuccessful experiments, Lin narrowed 
his search to one of 256 possibilities and ultimately solved his puzzle, thus 
"cloning" the EPO gene. Once that was done, the gene was spliced into cells 
that came from Chinese hamster ovaries, turning them into microscopic factories 
that produce EPO. 
</P>
<P>
All the time pressure on Lin was building, in particular because it was known 
that other companies were working on their own EPO projects. One rumor was that 
biotechnology rival Genentech had succeeded. Another was that rival Biogen had 
done it. Some began to doubt whether Amgen would succeed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Self-Esteem Suffered 
</P>
<P>
"There were many voices that said maybe we can't solve EPO. Maybe it's too 
difficult a problem," Whitcome said. 
</P>
<P>
Lin said that, as the project plodded along with little to show for it, his 
self-esteem suffered. "People look on you like you are a dummy or a failure. 
They don't know how tough it is. In science, you probably have 90% frustration 
and 10% success," Lin said. 
</P>
<P>
Lin is described by colleagues as stubborn, which he acknowledges. But, he 
said, he always believed that he was right. 
</P>
<P>
"A scientist dissolves his career into nothing if he does not succeed," Lin 
said. "All I wanted to do was succeed."

One-Year T-Bill Rates Fall: Interest rates on 52-week Treasury bills fell at 
the latest action to the lowest level since November. The Treasury Department 
sold $8.5 billion of the new bills at an average discount rate of 8.18%, down 
from 8.44% at the last auction May 4. The rates were the lowest since Nov. 17, 
1988, when the one-year bills sold for 7.92%. The new discount rate understates 
the actual return to investors -- 8.85%, with a $10,000 bill selling for 
$9,172.90.

PRODUCTIVITY SLIPS AS COST OF LABOR RISES

<P>
The productivity of American workers slipped in the first quarter while unit 
labor costs shot up more than 6% on an annual basis, the government said 
Thursday in a report analysts cited as proof of both a slowing economy and 
stubborn inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department's revised figures for the first three months of the year 
showed a 1.1% decline on an annual rate in non-farm business productivity, 
rather than the 0.5% gain projected in preliminary first-quarter data issued 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
Unit labor costs -- a key determinant of overall inflation -- rose a revised 
6.6% on an annual basis in the quarter, said the government, which in the 
earlier report had pegged the increase at 5.2%. 
</P>
<P>
The report was in line with other data indicating a significant slowing of 
economic expansion in the first quarter, followed by somewhat improved growth 
in the first two months of the second quarter. Analysts expect the unemployment 
report for May, due today, to put a more definitive stamp on second-quarter 
trends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Hours Worked 
</P>
<P>
"The economy is slowing down, but it's certainly not stopping," David Wyss, 
chief economist of DRI-McGraw-Hill of Lexington, Mass., said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1.1% decline in productivity followed an annualized 1% gain in the fourth 
quarter of 1988 and an overall gain of 1.5% for that year. It was the first 
decline in productivity since a sharp drop of 2.4% on an annual basis in the 
second quarter of last year. The revised data showed the 1.1% drop resulted 
from a 2.2% larger output being produced via 3.4% more hours of work. 
</P>
<P>
The jump in unit labor costs was the biggest since the second quarter of last 
year as well; the government at that time reported a 6.8% increase on an annual 
basis. For all of 1988, unit labor costs rose 3.1%. 
</P>
<P>
The revised numbers were not entirely unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's downward revision of the gross national product for the first 
quarter brought predictions that the productivity gain reported in May's 
preliminary data was erroneous. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the rate of decline surprised some analysts. Of greater concern was the 
inflationary pressure demonstrated by the big jump in labor costs. 
</P>
<P>
"The results are distinctly inflationary," said Allen Sinai, chief economist 
for Boston Co. Economic Advisers. "The true core of inflation in the United 
States is really unit labor costs. . . . This is indeed a dismal statement and 
makes the outlook for a quick and accelerated reduction in inflation very, very 
poor."

EASTERN'S UNIONS INVOLVED IN 11TH-HOUR TAKEOVER BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chicago commodities dealer Joseph Ritchie and Eastern Airlines' unions came 
forward Thursday with a new takeover proposal for Eastern that may represent 
the unions' last hope to wrest the strikebound carrier from their arch foe, 
Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing in which a Bankruptcy Court examiner had been expected to close 
the door on takeover attempts, Ritchie, the Shearson Lehman Hutton investment 
firm and the three unions presented a proposal that they said included $100 
million in equity and a plan for reviving the carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Although the surprise proposal stretched the deadline for offers, U.S. 
Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland postponed the hearing until today to give 
the examiner and other parties in the bankruptcy proceeding time to evaluate 
the new bid. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal appeared to be a long shot. Examiner David I. Shapiro, who first 
heard of the offer at 1 a.m. Thursday, said he did not believe that "this plan 
. . . is in the real world." 
</P>
<P>
Also under the court's consideration are Eastern's own proposal that it sell 
$1.8 billion worth of assets and radically shrink the airline, perhaps 
liquidate it. Eastern, a unit of Texas Air, sought Bankruptcy Court protection 
from creditors March 9, five days after its machinists went on strike. 
Virtually all its pilots and flight attendants are in sympathy with the 
machinists and have refused to cross the picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys said the Ritchie group's $100-million equity stake would include $25 
million from Ritchie and his associates, $25 million from the Airline Pilots 
Assn. and the International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, and $50 
million from the pension funds of 10 AFL-CIO unions. Shapiro, whom the court 
assigned broad powers, had required that bidders come up with at least $100 
million to demonstrate financial capability. 
</P>
<P>
The Ritchie plan envisions an airline that would emerge from bankruptcy with 
between 22,000 and 24,000 employees. Eastern had a payroll of 30,000 before the 
strike began, and has said it hopes ultimately to have a work force of about 
17,000. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Crames, an attorney for the Ritchie group, said Ritchie had spent five 
weeks putting together a plan he said would be "sufficiently attractive" to 
interest Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
But Eastern's lawyer, Harvey Miller, denounced Ritchie as an "officious 
intermeddler" and called the bid "ephemeral." "There's no place in the 
bankruptcy law that says a debtor's business has to be run by union employees," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The unions have a long history of battling with Eastern management, but the 
relationship has been especially sour since Lorenzo's Texas Air bought the 
airline in 1986 and demanded millions of dollars' worth of concessions in pay, 
work rules and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Examiner Shapiro rejected as inadequate the other pending bid for the company, 
from a group headed by former Piedmont Airlines Chairman William R. Howard and 
Prudential-Bache Securities. He said that group's effort would quickly run out 
of money and then Eastern would be "back in Bankruptcy Court in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
The examiner gave qualified support to Eastern's proposal that it reorganize 
and scale itself down. He said that plan could work only if there is no 
economic recession, that Eastern must meet its goals for adding pilots and set 
aside a "large amount of money" for improvements. Also, he said, Texas Air must 
not use Eastern's assets for its own operations.

PEOPLE: STANLEY NEWMAN RESIGNS FROM MCA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stanley Newman, the MCA vice president who heads the entertainment company's 
consumer products group, has tendered his resignation although he will continue 
as an active consultant, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
In his 15-year stint at the company, Newman's publishing unit responsibilities 
expanded to include LJN Toys and Spencer Gifts, the company's specialty retail 
and mail-order operation. All three units will now report directly to MCA Chief 
Operating Officer Sidney J. Sheinberg, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheinberg, who has long counted Newman among his closest associates, said 
Newman has made "incalculable contributions" and said the vice president's 
resignation was not the result of any quarrel. 
</P>
<P>
Newman will continue to serve as a director on the board of Cineplex Odeon 
Corp., the movie-theater concern in Toronto that is 49%-owned by MCA, the 
company said.

APPLE JUICE FIRM'S CONTROVERSIAL PRESIDENT RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tree Top, the nation's largest manufacturer of apple juice and other fruit 
products, confirmed reports Thursday that its president has resigned. But the 
grower-owned cooperative refused to attribute Dennis Colleran's departure to 
his opposition to use of the controversial chemical Alar. 
</P>
<P>
Colleran, 53, stepped down Tuesday after a meeting of the cooperative's board. 
</P>
<P>
Informed industry sources described him as a vocal critic for the past three 
years of the use of daminozide, sold under the trade name Alar, on apples. They 
noted that, under his leadership, the company had refused to process and market 
Alar-treated fruit for the Tree Top label. 
</P>
<P>
After Alar was identified as a potential carcinogen in a report released Feb. 
27 by the private Natural Resources Defense Council, Colleran stepped up his 
efforts against the chemical, the sources said. Under his leadership, the 
Selah, Wash., company last month stopped processing apples treated with the 
growth regulator, which Tree Top had done to accommodate growers who used the 
chemical as long as they sold their products under other brand names. 
</P>
<P>

'Difference in Philosophy' 
</P>
<P>
Before the cutoff, Tree Top had been the last remaining outlet for the 15% of 
the state's apple crop that was treated with Alar last year. Those growers, one 
source said, "were looking for a scapegoat." 
</P>
<P>
Tree Top spokesman John McAlister on Thursday attributed Colleran's parting to 
"a difference in management philosophy and direction." Asked about the Alar 
reports, he said: "It is a private matter between Mr. Colleran and the board." 
</P>
<P>
McAlister said George Chapman, chairman of Tree Top's board and general manager 
of Magi Inc., a fruit-packing cooperative in Brewster, Wash., would serve as 
acting president until a successor is hired. 
</P>
<P>
Colleran could not be reached and so far has refused to comment on reasons for 
his departure. He is nationally known in the processed-apple business as 
president of the Processed Apples Institute and member of the board of the 
National Food Processing Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Tree Top reported record sales of $255 million, up $68 million from 
a year earlier. McAlister said sales this year could top $260 million and added 
that the forecast was closer to $300 million before the Alar scare. 
</P>
<P>
Alar extends the life of the fruit on the tree, which is particularly useful in 
managing harvests. It also tends to improve the color of red apples and to 
preserve crispness in the softer-fleshed apples for which Washington, the 
nation's top apple producer, is best known.

Sun Microsystems said Thursday that it may report a loss in the current quarter 
on lower-than-expected revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Sun shares fell $1.25 on the news to $20.75 as the most actively traded issue 
in the over-the-counter market. 
</P>
<P>
The company cited several factors for the expected shortfall, including slowed 
production because of switching to a new management information system. Sun 
also said it introduced five products in the quarter, making it difficult to 
forecast its product mix.

In Australia, where the environment has become a major political issue, Prime 
Minister Bob Hawke and his 4-year-old granddaughter will appear on a 90-minute 
program Tuesday called "Climate in Crisis." On the program, Hawke says: 
"Sophie's now 4. In the year 2000 she will be 15 -- not all that far from 
adulthood, with her own dreams and aspirations. How successfully she and other 
children can fulfill their goals depends increasingly on how we look after our 
environment and how we best use this planet's natural resources." Saving the 
country's rain forests and cleaning up beach pollution are among concerns of 
conservationists down under. ALEENE MacMINN

Patricia McBride, long one of America's leading ballerinas, is to dance her 
farewell performance Sunday night in Manhattan's Lincoln Center with the New 
York City Ballet. McBride, for 28 years a principal dancer with the company 
founded by the late George Balanchine, is scheduled to perform excerpts from 
some of the roles Balanchine choreographed for her. She reportedly intends to 
retire to family life in Bloomington, Ind., with her husband, former NYCB 
dancer Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux, and two children. She is 46.ALEENE MacMINN

'VAMPIRE' SINKS FANGS INTO BIG-CITY NASTINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Vampire's Kiss" (the Mann Plaza, Westwood, and Hollywood Pacific) is the kind 
of film that would self-destruct with a single false move. But in bringing 
Joseph Minion's mine-strewn script to the screen, British director Robert 
Bierman, in his theatrical feature debut, and his protean star Nicolas Cage 
never falter. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a sleek, outrageous dark comedy that's all the funnier for 
constantly teetering on the brink of sheer tastelessness and silliness. 
</P>
<P>
Cage is the Manhattan yuppie at his most obnoxious, a hotshot literary agent 
who browbeats his secretary (Maria Conchita Alonso), demanding that she 
concentrate on the pointless but herculean task of locating a 10-year-old 
missing contract. At the same time this jerk is so perplexed as to why his 
relationships with women are so shallow that he regularly sees a psychiatrist 
(cool, soignee Elizabeth Ashley), but he's a lousy, uncooperative patient. He's 
ripe for -- and richly deserving of -- falling victim to a sexy vampire 
(Jennifer Beals, perfectly cast). 
</P>
<P>
As in his screenplay for Martin Scorcese's "After Hours," Minion has spun a 
contemporary morality play enclosed in humor and in which, in this instance, 
vampirism becomes a nifty metaphor for the rapaciousness of modern society. 
Thankfully, Bierman and Minion don't spell it out this baldly; indeed, 
"Vampire's Kiss" can be taken simply as a lively, imaginative fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
From his first moment on the screen -- it was in "Rumble Fish," in which he was 
gang leader Matt Dillon's treacherous lieutenant -- Nicolas Cage has been full 
of captivating surprises. Never before has so much been demanded of him. He 
must seem at once hatefully obnoxious yet pathetic in his progressive 
deterioration. Above all, he must always seem funny. Were he not, the film 
would be just too repellently venomous to contemplate. 
</P>
<P>
But Cage carries everything with a manic intensity that plays with throwaway 
ease but must have required the utmost energy and concentration -- not to 
mention spontaneity. 
</P>
<P>
Alonso has a no less tricky assignment, as this most expressive of actresses 
succeeds in finding the humor in the mortification of the secretary. That this 
woman is a Latina who dares not quit her job makes it all the riskier to make 
her the object of such continual abuse. That the film makers get away with it 
is actually liberating; shrewdly, they've realized that if they proceeded 
timidly it would not have worked any more than soft-pedaling Cage's callous 
treatment of a beautiful young black woman (well-played by Kasi Lemmons) would 
have worked. 
</P>
<P>
"Vampire's Kiss" (rated R for language, some sex) is not putting the bite on 
these women but on Cage's agent, whose absurd power-tripping nastiness 
characterizes so much of everyday life in the big city. 
</P>

'RENEGADES' A WASTE OF SUTHERLAND, PHILLIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS and KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Renegades" (citywide), a shamelessly contrived, ultraviolent macho fantasy, 
stars Kiefer Sutherland and Lou Diamond Phillips, who are too talented and too 
successful to be wasting themselves on such trash. 
</P>
<P>
Sutherland plays a maverick undercover Philadelphia cop who has infiltrated a 
ring of jewel thieves. For absolutely no discernible reason except to further 
the plot, its icily lethal ringleader (Rob Knepper), while making his escape, 
steals a lance sacred to the Lakota Sioux on display as part of a gallery 
exhibition of Lakota arts and crafts. This allows Phillips, a tribe member, to 
team up (warily) with Sutherland in his pursuit of the bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
David Rich's script provides for maximum bloodshed and destruction of property 
and minimal common sense. Director Jack Sholder can at least be credited for 
maintaining a high level of energy in deploying the film's rampant foolishness, 
which includes Sutherland's miraculously rapid recovery from a gunshot wound to 
his abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
It's a real shame that Gary Farmer, the hilarious co-star of "Powwow Highway," 
is gunned down early on, because his massively humorous and sweet-natured 
presence would have been a welcome comic relief. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, the only laughs that occur in "Renegades" (rated R for extreme 
violence) are in its final scene, when Phillips, not once but twice, 
mispronounces "cavalry" as "calvary." KEVIN THOMAS

CAST CHANGES IN SECOND HARLEM PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA PERLMUTTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Challenges galore awaited Dance Theatre of Harlem's second cast on its second 
bill, Wednesday at Pasadena Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
For Judy Tyrus, who -- with Ronald Perry -- danced the pas de deux in 
Balanchine's "Bugaku," it was a test of stylized containment. How to convert 
her tensile strength into a sober, geisha seduction? How to approximate the 
supple, curving softness of Allegra Kent, who originated the role and inspired 
its tortuous extensions? 
</P>
<P>
Easy. By focusing on her expressive hauteur, which Tyrus, with an imperturbable 
look and almond-shaped eyes, did consummately. Nor was she a slouch when it 
came to the leggy hyperconvolutions or the flat-footed walk taken in tiny steps 
or the insinuatingly precious poses. 
</P>
<P>
For those who inherited De Mille's "Fall River Legend," it was a test of 
dramatic realism. And if Cassandra Phifer fell somewhat short of the psychotic 
rage that signals the Accused's patricide, at least she has put a down payment 
on the role. Her encounters with the Stepmother, chillingly manipulative as 
danced by Stephanie Dabney and with the Father, remote and remorseless as 
danced by James Goree, showed touching vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
For the principals in Fokine's "Prince Igor" it was a far lesser thing, hardly 
more than that of a Vegas dancer. But with her cool elegance Virginia Johnson 
brought a regal touch even to the hootchy-kootchiness of the Princess' dance, 
while Eddie Shellman gave his grinning-Tartar all to the macho maneuvers of the 
Chief Warrior. DONNA PERLMUTTER

KOLPIN IN 'BILLY THE KID' AT UCI FACULTY CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Joffrey Ballet, Dance Theatre of Harlem and Oakland Ballet each brought 
authoritative productions of "Billy the Kid" to Southern California in the past 
six weeks. But all too often, the leading dancer in Eugene Loring's 1938 
morality tale seemed miscast: Billy the Hunk, Billy the Prince, Billy the 
Weird. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Kid finally arrived: Alexander Kolpin of the Royal Danish 
Ballet, appearing as a stellar guest in a 50th anniversary staging at Loring's 
former home base, the Fine Arts Village Theater, UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Short, slender and coltish (he turned 24 Thursday), Kolpin not only looked 
ideally youthful, he danced with the hyperkinetic propulsion of a teen-ager in 
a big hurry. Moreover, he provided a number of sharp insights about the 
character's immaturity: Billy's intent, childlike fascination with the death of 
his victims, for instance, or his sudden pangs of loneliness just before the 
final encounter with Pat Garrett. Meet the Wild West's rebel without a cause. 
</P>
<P>
Kolpin had never danced the role anywhere until Wednesday, and inevitably there 
were unfinished details. However, his performance was obviously world class in 
its originality, eloquence, technique and sense of style. UCI students danced 
all the other roles, but their inexperience showed less in this gesture-based 
story ballet than in other pure-dance vehicles on the program. 
</P>
<P>
For the occasion, Patricia L. Whiteside -- who also supervised Donald 
Bradburn's staging of "Billy" -- mounted a production of Loring's last ballet, 
"Time Unto Time." 
</P>
<P>
Created in 1980 (two years before Loring's death), it resembled "Billy" in its 
imaginative expansion of realistic gestures into formal dance motifs, in its 
emphasis upon processional movement and individuals set against a corps, in the 
theme of a collective destiny. 
</P>
<P>
Danced to Bartok's Music for Strings, Percussion and Celeste, it developed this 
premise through situational rather than narrative structures: episodes for up 
to 15 dancers expressing wild anguish and equally desperate hope. A brooding, 
masterfully crafted work, it deserves to be better known. 
</P>
<P>
The evening also offered a shaky but promising run-through of Bournonville's 
"Flower Festival" pas de deux and two works by faculty choreographers: "Sing, 
Sing, Sing" (Donna France's slick, Broadway-style tap extravaganza to music by 
Duke Ellington) and "Nightfall" (Dianne Howe's weighty study of layered, formal 
choric motion to an original score by Paul Hodgins). 
</P>
<P>
The most accomplished of the student dancers included Eileen Ordonez (the 
Mother/Sweetheart in "Billy"), Erin Holmes (the leader in "Time Unto Time") and 
Peter Duerr (prominent in both Loring ballets). Canned music accompanied all 
the dances except "Nightfall." The program continues through Saturday. LEWIS

THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENA DONOHUE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first painting in Martha Mayer-Erlebacher's neoclassical realist show is of 
pubescent girls and doves. It may cause you to lump her in with every other 
saccharine revivalist following Carlo Maria Mariani's insipid lead. Keep going 
and you will see a talented and convincing exponent of an otherwise beleaguered 
genre. 
</P>
<P>
Erlebacher is a strict and careful structural draftsman in the lineage of 
Poussin and Ingres. She feels that formal elegance and precision applied to the 
human figure is the best way to hook the viewer's mind and heart. That 
anachronistic assumption aside, unique handling of the figure and 
reinterpretation of classical themes definitely draws us into a closer look at 
what really concerns the artist -- man's growing disconnectedness from the 
natural order. This is captured in the pose of a nude in a desolate landscape 
who gestures toward a distant monolith that suggests both nature and a 
tombstone. It conveys a mute sense of estrangement and imminent demise.

A world gone awry, divorced from any spirituality is the subject of a slightly 
excessive Road Warrior picnic orgy where punkish nudes with rainbow hair and 
leather get-ups use flesh and nature like expendable commodities. Erlebacher's 
no preacher of doom, however. In an enclosed Renaissance garden, Adam and Eve 
after the Fall contemplate their reflections in a limpid pool and a mirror as 
if to say that for the artist, self awareness will pull us through in the end.

A show of paintings, drawings, watercolors and sculptures by American modernist 
Max Weber (1881-1961) samples the artist's output between 1908 to 1932. Of 
Russian lineage, steeped in the early European avant-garde, Weber was an 
eclectic chameleon able to recognize good formulas when he saw them, facile 
enough to absorb each at will. 
</P>
<P>
The show offers numerous charming if borrowed still lifes that have the tipped 
tables and faceted fruit of Cezanne. You can't find fault with the poetry of 
"The Gesture" from 1921 even though you know it quotes heavily from Picasso in 
the '20s. It's no accident that Futurism debuted around 1909 and that Weber's 
tiny, impressive ink drawing, "Two Sleepers," dated 1912, uses all the 
energetic linearity of that school. 
</P>
<P>
Weber deserves a spot as one who broke the ice that held American art in deep 
freeze in the early 1900s. Beyond that, Weber was a talented paraphraser who 
softened the bite of primitivism, cubism and expressionism with a warm romantic 
air best illustrated in the fine painting "Interior Still Life" from 1932. A 
group of tiny doodled sculptures shows Weber at his least derivative and most 
charming. (Feingarten Galleries, 8380 Melrose Ave., extended to June 
15.)MARLENA DONOHUE

Australia aboriginal artists tell fantastic stories about the long-ago doings 
of beasts and humans. Using the simplest of alphabets -- constellations of tiny 
dots, relieved by curved and straight lines -- these "dreamings" are quite 
irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
Paintings couch mythic versions of history in minimalist patterns and muted 
color that inevitably remind the viewer of contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, although these patterns were painted on the earth for thousands of 
years, their rendering in acrylic on canvas dates back only to the early 1970s. 
Although the basic units of the patterns are virtually identical, their 
deployment varies depending on the story, and each painter has a distinctive 
style -- whether of machine-like identical dots or blurred big dots or tiny 
flecks. 
</P>
<P>
Also on view are linear bark paintings of creatures whose bodies are ornamented 
with patterns reminiscent of weavings; a few small sandstone rocks painted with 
the real and imagined beasts of the Australian desert; and wooden statues with 
shrunken arms and long thin torsos representing the delicate Mimi spirits, who 
venture out only at night. The sampling is generous and the wall-label 
annotation, precise, detailed and charmingly presented. (Caz, 8715 Melrose 
Ave., to July 29.) CATHY CURTIS

Like all artists Tom Stanton mines his past when he paints. But with Stanton 
his past is not simply an allusion but the actual surface of the work itself. 
Old paintings cut up, overpainted and integrated become the connective tissue 
and skin for his new imagery. It's a little like watching an actor rehearse an 
old play; each time through giving the lines another, more amplified meaning. 
</P>
<P>
This time around the paintings bury earlier foreboding images beneath a curling 
web of thick white lines. It's like watching Mark Tobey white out an El Greco. 
Results are uneven but have a strongly ritualistic, tribal flavor. Most 
impressive are pieces like "Dragon" where the white rococo lines suggest 
grotesque, Oriental demon masks and give the obsessive doodling a fierce 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
Stanton's sculpture is more playful and more consistent. Obviously pulled 
together from whatever was around, "Senufu" in particular recalls both roots 
and the white-clay-decorated body of an African dancer. After the visual clamor 
of the paintings their elegant, linear simplicity is a welcome relief. 
</P>
<P>
In the adjoining gallery Maureen O'Hara Ure shows small tableaux inspired by 
folk art. A confusing mix of items -- part toy box, part furniture, part 
traditional painting -- it is unclear whether these canny pieces are 
autobiographical fragments or a collection of embellished household furnishings 
made for fun. Some, like "Your House is on Fire; Your Children Alone" seem to 
carry messages about history and racism, but others are just empty stages where 
the painted backdrop is too generalized to have any meaning. (Space, 6015 Santa

**** "A Confederacy of Dunces" by John Kennedy Toole. Read by Arte Johnson. 
Abridged by Mary Margaret Moffitt on two cassettes. Dove. 
</P>
<P>
Success came too late for John Kennedy Toole, who died by his own hand before 
his mother badgered his manuscript into print, where it became a best seller. 
His portrait of a gross but vivid eccentric, Ignatius J. Reilly, his 
hard-tippling, hysterical mother and a supporting cast of New Orleans zanies 
gets a raucous, hilarious reading from comedian Arte Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson does a running romp through a variety of voices from Ignatius' 
stentorian imprecations to his mother's sirenlike wailings about her wayward, 
300-pound, 30-year-old boy. The book's undertones of estrangement and despair, 
the feeling that it is a mad look at a maddening world, are better found in the 
text. But as a listening experience, the abridgement is an unmitigated 
delight.CHARLES CHAMPLIN

The Congress of People's Deputies moved to investigate whether the Baltic 
republics willingly joined the Soviet Union, after historian Roy A. Medvedev 
and other deputies charged that the Kremlin forcibly annexed them and then 
doctored the truth. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, responding to a request 
from an Estonian deputy, supported setting up a commission to look into whether 
secret clauses in a 1939 pact with Nazi Germany assigned Lithuania, Latvia and 
Estonia to the Soviet Union, paving the way for annexation a year later. 
Gorbachev said he doubted that the Baltic people had opposed joining the Soviet 
Union.

A man whose wife was jailed after he took their 4-year-old son Sunday from 
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York where he was undergoing 
court-ordered treatment for leukemia surrendered with the boy, police said. 
Family Court Judge Leon Deutsch in Brooklyn gave David Pagan, 36, a suspended 
10-day sentence, released his wife, Migdalia, 35, and placed their son back in 
the custody of child welfare authorities. Mrs. Pagan was jailed on contempt of 
court charges for refusing to tell where her husband and child were.

National Organization for Women President Molly Yard and former NOW President 
Eleanor Smeal announced a campaign to bring the drug RU 486 -- sometimes called 
the "abortion pill" -- to the United States. "RU 486 can help save so many 
lives that we are determined to build a network both nationally and 
internationally to ensure that its research and development proceeds as fast as 
possible," Yard told a news conference in Washington. "Today in the world, one 
woman dies every three minutes from a botched illegal abortion," said Smeal, 
now president of the Fund for a Feminist Majority. RU 486, also known as 
mifepristone, was developed in France in 1982 and tested for many uses, 
including inducing abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Cypriot unity remains a dream now that a June 1 target date set by the United 
Nations for progress in reunification talks between the Greek and Turkish 
Cypriot communities has passed, officials said. A Greek Cypriot politician said 
the only tangible outcome of 10 months of U.N.-sponsored negotiations was an 
agreement to withdraw troops from sensitive areas in the heart of Nicosia, the 
capital. The head of the Greek Cypriot community, President George Vassiliou, 
and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash are due to meet U.N. Secretary General 
Javier Perez de Cuellar in New York at the end of this month.

The Housing and Urban Development Department said it will resume subsidies, 
under new rules, for the rehabilitation of privately owned housing used by 
low-income and moderate-income families. Secretary Jack Kemp had suspended the 
program in April, canceling awards made this fiscal year, after the 
department's inspector general reported it had been mismanaged and riddled with 
favoritism for former high-ranking Republicans serving as consultants to 
developers. The announcement said new awards will be based on numerical 
rankings -- which will involve area poverty, crowding and quality of housing -- 
for the poor in a competitive process for available funds.

About 2,000 Vietnamese "boat people" began a hunger strike in Hong Kong to 
protest a policy that treats them as illegal immigrants subject to 
repatriation. The refugees at a detention center in the Shatin district refused 
to eat after officials began screening under a year-old policy that makes them 
subject to deportation unless they can prove they fled political persecution. 
Another 492 Vietnamese refugees sailed into Hong Kong waters and were towed to 
Tai A Chau, an outlying island without any shelter. They joined 270 refugees 
sent to the island earlier in the week.

A Polish-born American millionaire agreed to try to save the birthplace of the 
Solidarity trade union, the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk, from closure by Poland's 
Communist government. Barbara Piasecka-Johnson, who inherited a fortune from 
her U.S. businessman-husband, signed a preliminary agreement in the Baltic port 
with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and the shipyard manager, Czeslaw Tolwinski, 
to form a company to save the yard. The three said in a statement that they are 
planning to start operations by Jan. 1, but they did not say if the new company 
will take over all or part of the shipyard. The government last October ordered 
it closed due to heavy financial losses.

A New York man became the first American sentenced to prison under a federal 
law barring citizens from doing business with the government or 
government-owned enterprises of South Africa. U.S. District Court Judge Mark 
Costantino sentenced Robert Fessler, 43, formerly president of Air Ground 
Equipment Sales Inc. in West Babylon, N.Y., to three months in prison, 33 
months probation and a $100,000 fine for violating the 1986 Comprehensive 
Anti-Apartheid Act. Fessler was convicted of conspiring to buy and import four 
jet engines from South African Airways, the government-owned airline of the 
white-ruled nation. Air Ground Equipment Sales also pleaded guilty to selling 
parts to the airline and agreed to pay $1 million and forfeit the four engines.

A mysterious vandal who slashes designer clothes in stores was back at work 
with a vengeance in Orange County, cutting six more suits over the Memorial Day 
weekend and bringing to $50,000 the damage inflicted in the last six weeks. The 
heightened pace of the attacks, in which men's designer suits are the prime 
targets, has frustrated police, worried merchants and baffled psychiatrists, 
who suggest that the spree may represent anything from a prank to a protest 
against materialism. "We have no suspects, no (pyschological) profile, no 
idea," said Mike Millington, a Costa Mesa police detective. Most of the suits 
are dark in color, sizes 38 to 46 and priced over $300. The damage consists of 
a small incision, usually about 2 inches long, at the shoulder. The pants are 
not touched. Police believe the slasher has been at work over two years, doing 
$98,000 damage at stores at the South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa and Fashion 
Island shopping center in Newport Beach.

Lines of tearful friends and relatives wound through the Capitol on Thursday to 
bid farewell to Rep. Claude Pepper (D-Fla.), whose body lay in state in the 
Rotunda. 
</P>
<P>
"Claude Pepper's death marks the passing of an era in American history," said 
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell of Maine at a Rotunda ceremony. "His 
energy and his vision will be sorely missed." 
</P>
<P>
Pepper, who died Tuesday at 88 of stomach cancer, was to lie in state in the 
Rotunda until noon today. Only 26 other Americans have been so honored. 
</P>
<P>
"Claude Pepper was a man of his time but he was also a man ahead of his time," 
Mitchell said. "Millions will lead more full, healthy and meaningful lives 
because of his efforts." 
</P>
<P>
"Many will never know his name, but it is in their behalf that we say thank 
you," Mitchell said. "His legacy remains as vibrant as he was." 
</P>
<P>
Pepper, a tenacious New Dealer who began his political career in 1937, served 
14 years in the Senate. He was defeated in 1950, and after 12 years in private 
life he returned to Capitol Hill to begin a celebrated career in the House. 
</P>
<P>
When he died, Pepper was not only the oldest member of Congress, but the only 
member in either chamber who served during the New Deal of the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
In his later years, Pepper was beloved by senior citizens for his determined 
efforts on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle told the gathering in the Rotunda that Pepper "taught 
us about how to make a difference in the world. He never lost faith that things 
could or would get better." 
</P>
<P>
Pepper's flag-draped coffin was brought into the Rotunda by six military 
pallbearers and placed on a black-draped wooden catafalque first used to bear 
Abraham Lincoln's body in 1865. 
</P>
<P>
The Rotunda then was cleared of family, guests and reporters while attendants 
opened the coffin. Guests were ushered back in and the ceremony began. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of friends, longtime aides, senators, House members and admirers filled 
the Rotunda to honor Pepper and filed past his coffin after the speeches and 
prayers. 
</P>
<P>
After the lying in state, Pepper's body will be flown to Miami for services 
Sunday in the district he represented in the House for 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
His body will lie in state later Sunday in the Rotunda of the old Florida 
Capitol in Tallahassee and will be buried in that city Monday next to his wife, 
Mildred, who died in 1979.

Italian conductor Giuseppe Patane, who won rave reviews for his U.S. 
appearances in the 1970s, died early Tuesday after collapsing on stage during a 
performance of the Munich City Opera. He was 57. 
</P>
<P>
Patane apparently suffered a heart attack Monday night while conducting a new 
arrangement of "Il Barbiere di Seviglia." (The Barber of Seville.) He was taken 
to a hospital, where he died. 
</P>
<P>
Patane, the principal conductor of the Bavarian Radio Orchestra, regularly 
directed performances of the City Opera. He also led performances at the 
Bavarian National Theater in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
Patane, who was born in Naples, Italy, began playing piano at the age of 6. He 
made his debut at 19, conducting a Naples performance of Verdi's "La Traviata." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Understudy to Conductors 
</P>
<P>
In the next 10 years, he was understudy to such renowned Italian conductors as 
Victor De Sabata, Antonio Guarnieri, Tullio Serafin and Gabriele Santini. 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, Patane became the first Italian to conduct Richard Wagner's 
"Lohengrin" in Linz, Austria, and in 1962 he became conductor of the German 
Opera in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Patane's reputation led him to guest appearances in such famous music halls as 
La Scala in Milan, the Vienna National Opera in Austria and the Royal Covent 
Garden in London. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, he was named best Italian conductor, and in the following years he was 
hailed in appearances in San Francisco, Chicago and at New York's Metropolitan 
Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
A specialist in the Italian operatic repertory, he knew 1,500 musical scores 
from memory, including 250 separate operas, according to Bavarian Radio 
Orchestra spokesman Rainer Tief.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: AT NBC, THEY CAN READ TERRY O'NEIL LIKE AN OPEN BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Larry Stewart 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Terry O'Neil, former ABC and CBS sports producer, wrote his book about the 
inner workings of the sports television business, "The Game Behind the Game," 
he thought he was through with the networks. 
</P>
<P>
But lo and behold, a couple of weeks before the book's release date, O'Neil, 
39, was named executive producer of NBC Sports, replacing popular Michael 
Weisman. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, advance copies of the book were in great demand on the 14th and 15th 
floors at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York, headquarters of NBC Sports. 
</P>
<P>
The book is a revealing study of O'Neil. Some people might see him as honest. 
Others might not be so kind. 
</P>
<P>
One thing for sure, he doesn't pull any punches in the book, delivering jabs at 
a number of former co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he portrays Peter Lund, former president of CBS Sports, and Jim 
Spence, former senior vice president of ABC Sports, as weak, indecisive 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Lund fired O'Neil. The final straw in their relationship was a dispute 
over a Tiffany Chin feature O'Neil produced, which was to have been shown as 
part of the coverage of that year's World Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
According to O'Neil, Lund was convinced that the piece, which showed Chin's 
mother, Marjorie, as domineering, might hurt CBS' relations with figure 
skating. 
</P>
<P>
Lund rather casually told O'Neil not to run the piece. An argument ensued. A 
month later, O'Neil started hearing rumors that he would be fired. According to 
O'Neil, Lund finally told him, "T.O., the rumors are true." 
</P>
<P>
His troubles with Spence came to a head in 1980, after O'Neil was named 
producer of ABC's "Monday Night Football." He lasted only three games, mainly 
because of confrontations with Howard Cosell. O'Neil, in the book, blames 
Spence for not backing him in those disputes. 
</P>
<P>
He soon left ABC and went to CBS, where he took charge of, among other things, 
that network's pro football coverage. He says one of the first things he did 
was put out an edict: No drinking on the job. 
</P>
<P>
In his book, he accuses announcers Pat Summerall and Tom Brookshier of drinking 
during telecasts. "Alcohol was the lifeblood of the old CBS Sports," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
Brookshier has denied the charge and has been quoted as saying, "The one thing 
you don't know about Terry O'Neil is the joke he was." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil writes that he told Summerall that he couldn't drink during telecasts, 
and that took care of that. O'Neil blames his predecessors at CBS as being too 
permissive. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few mistakes O'Neil admits in the book was the way he told Vin 
Scully that Summerall, not Scully, would be paired with John Madden as the No. 
1 pro football announcing team. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, O'Neil and other executives at CBS put Scully and Summerall through 
sort of an eight-week audition. For four weeks, Scully worked with Madden, and 
Summerall worked with Hank Stram. Then they switched commentators for four more 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
After the decision was made that Summerall and Madden would be the No. 1 team 
and would work that season's Super Bowl, O'Neil was selected to tell Scully. 
</P>
<P>
He phoned Scully and said, "Vin, I have good news. You're going to be working 
two postseason games -- a divisional playoff and the NFC championship game. 
Your partner for the second half of the season is going to be Hank Stram." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil writes: "Even as I was hearing myself say these words, I knew how wrong 
they were. Scully was spitting mad. He was in a New York hotel room between 
games of the World Series he was working for CBS radio. I offered to come 
across town to speak to him. He declined emphatically." 
</P>
<P>
Scully left CBS after the 1982 football season, going to NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Writes O'Neil: "On his way out the door, Scully told CBS corporate management 
that the Super Bowl disappointment was the largest factor, but another reason 
was the 'good news' phone call from Terry O'Neil." 
</P>
<P>
A couple of weeks ago, O'Neil met with Scully in New York to discuss the 
announcer's future with NBC. It was their first conversation since that phone 
call. 
</P>
<P>
"I showed him what I had written, and we laughed about it," O'Neil said. "Vin 
said he didn't remember the phone call." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds as if Scully might have taken the diplomatic approach with his new boss. 
</P>
<P>
Before getting the NBC job, O'Neil planned to take a 10-city tour to promote 
his book. Afterward, he asked Dick Ebersol, new president of NBC Sports and the 
man who hired him, if he should cancel the promotional tour considering the 
nature of the book. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil is well aware that people, particularly those in a high-profile field 
such as television, don't take kindly to seeing negative things about 
themselves in print. 
</P>
<P>
Also, when last month's announcement concerning O'Neil was made, one thing 
Ebersol said was that he didn't want any of his employees saying anything 
derogatory about the competition -- or about anybody else for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
"When I asked Dick if I should cancel the tour, he said, no, to go ahead," 
O'Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
But it was pared down from 10 cities to five. Los Angeles was the last stop 
late last week. O'Neil officially took over his new NBC job Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
While in Los Angeles, O'Neil said of his book, "It is simply a study of the 
business I am in." He said he is not embarrassed by anything he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Also, he had only good things to say about the current sports staff at NBC. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went to CBS in 1981, a lot of changes were needed," he said. "At NBC, 
I'm going to go out of my way to make as few changes as possible." 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
It's bad enough that Wednesday night's Chicago-Detroit basketball playoff game 
was only on cable TV, but even worse is that this conference final series isn't 
on radio. Starting with tonight's game at Chicago, all remaining playoff games 
will be televised by CBS. Weeknight telecasts during the finals will all start 
at 6, PST. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what happens in tonight's game, Game 1 of the finals won't be played 
until next Tuesday. If Detroit wins tonight, Games 1 and 2 will be played 
Tuesday and Thursday in Detroit, with Games 3, 4 and 5 to follow at the Forum 
the following Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday. If Chicago wins tonight, Game 7 of 
that series will be televised Sunday at 10 a.m., and if the Bulls happen to win 
the series, the finals will begin at the Forum Tuesday. If there is a Game 7 
Sunday, it will be followed by Kemper Open golf at 12:30 p.m. If there is no 
Game 7, the golf coverage will begin at noon. 
</P>
<P>
Sales for the Sugar Ray Leonard-Thomas Hearns pay-per-view telecast June 12 are 
on a record pace. Rick Kulis, president of Torrance-based Choice Entertainment, 
the Southern California distributor of the telecast, said at a news conference 
Thursday that already more than 50,000 cable subscribers have signed up. Kulis 
expects that by fight time, pay-per-view sales will reach 150,000, which would 
top the old Southern California record of about 120,000 for Mike Tyson-Michael 
Spinks. The fight is being offered by 68 cable companies in Southern 
California, and will also be shown at 53 closed-circuit locations. . . . 
Nationally, promoter Bob Arum said that, counting both cable companies and 
closed-circuit locations, there will be a record 1,600 carriers of the 
Leonard-Hearns fight. For the 1987 Leonard-Marvelous Marvin Hagler bout, there 
were 1,028, and there were about 1,400 for Tyson-Spinks. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the ABC camera that Kevin Cogan's car crashed into during his second 
lap of Sunday's Indy 500, it was an unmanned stationary camera. No camera 
operator had to escape danger, as we incorrectly reported Monday. "We did have 
a manned hand-held camera on the other side of the track but not there," 
producer Bob Goodrich said. "But there were crew members in that area, and it's 
amazing none were hurt by flying debris." It's also amazing that the camera, 
which cost about $50,000, wasn't totaled. "Interestingly enough, only the 
plastic that covers the lens was cracked," Goodrich said. 
</P>
<P>
Weirdest thing on TV last weekend was a feature about Channel 7's Jim Hill that 
was carried by Channel 4 at noon Sunday. The nicely done piece was part of a 
syndicated show, "Other Side of Victory." . . . Speaking of Hill, he had 
another good interview last Sunday, this one with the Lakers' Orlando 
Woolridge, who talked about his drug problems and how his wife has stuck by 
him. . . . Mike Willman, despite having some problems with Wednesday's feature 
race, has been doing a nice job filling in for the vacationing Bill Garr on 
radio station KIEV's Hollywood Park coverage.

ORIOLES BEAT TIGERS, 8-3, FOR 12TH WIN IN 15 GAMES

Jim Traber expressed disappointment at sitting on the bench while the Baltimore 
Orioles were playing their best baseball of the season, yet the first baseman 
knew he would get another chance to make a contribution. 
</P>
<P>
That chance came Thursday night. Traber, starting for the injured Randy 
Milligan, and Rene Gonzales hit home runs to key a six-run first inning as the 
Orioles won for the 12th time in their last 15 games, beating the Tigers, 8-3, 
at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been kind of hard not playing," said Traber, who had four RBIs. "The 
team's doing well, and I didn't feel a part of it. But I deserved to be on the 
bench because I had a terrible slump at the start of the season and Randy 
played well." 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles have won four straight games, equaling their longest streak of last 
season, and are the first American League East team to go five games over .500. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Randy Nosek, making only his second start since being called up from 
Class Double-A London, Canada, did not survive the first inning, giving up all 
six runs on four hits and two walks. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Schmidt won his fourth consecutive start despite allowing leadoff homers 
by Gary Pettis in the first and Fred Lynn in the fifth. It was Pettis' first 
homer of the season and Lynn's second. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 5, New York 0 -- Teddy Higuera, hampered all season while recovering 
from back surgery, pitched a two-hitter through six innings for his first 
victory as the Brewers beat the Yankees at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Higuera did not give up a hit until Alvaro Espinoza singled over the pitcher's 
glove to lead off the sixth inning. The left-hander then gave up another single 
to Steve Sax before retiring the side. 
</P>
<P>
Higuera, in his fifth start, struck out seven and walked one in his longest 
outing of the season. He underwent back surgery in January to remove a 
herniated disk and came off the disabed list May 1. Jay Aldrich pitched the 
final three innings for his first career save. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 3, Texas 2 -- Dave Cochrane hit a home run with one out in the ninth 
inning at Seattle to lift the Mariners past the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers had tied the game in the eighth on Scott Fletcher's two-run double, 
but Cochrane connected on an 0-and-1 pitch from Texas starter Kevin Brown for 
his second homer. Texas has lost four straight. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Schooler, the third Seattle pitcher, worked 1 2/3 innings to win his first 
decision of the year.

 BOOKS FOR LOOKS: MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY REVEALED IN VOLUME ABOUT HOT DESIGN

Esprit, The Comprehensive Design Principle, by Doug Tompkins (Robundo: $95, 
currently at Esprit Superstores and in bookstores in July). 
</P>
<P>
Here is a delightful romp through one of the late-20th Century's hottest design 
firms -- its products, its stores, its advertising, even its distinctive 
hang-tags and sales signs. But careful observers will find far more here than 
stunning color photos, ebulliently laid out and printed on an intriguing 
selection of strangely coated papers. 
</P>
<P>
In the book's short text, Esprit founder Tompkins also reveals some unexpected 
clues to the esprit de corps management philosophy. He's not too precise about 
solutions, but he writes thoughtfully about a firm's responsibility, for 
instance, "to encourage a consumer to develop style and not be consumptive for 
consumption's sake." 
</P>
<P>
And consider this refreshing bit of honesty on hiring policy: "We try, above 
all else, to find people who fit into our culture, whose value system is 
compatible with ours; that socially, politically, aesthetically, professionally 
and even athletically (!) think fundamentally like we do." BETTY JEAN BARNHILL

THE ANATOMY OF RUSSIAN MELANCHOLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE KENDALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the Golden Porch by Tatyana Tolstaya, translated by Antonina W. Bouis 
(Alfred A. Knopf: $17.95; 200 pages) 
</P>
<P>
You could block out every allusion to monuments and landmarks, censor 
references to the rigors of daily life, anglicize the names and "On the Golden 
Porch" would still be immediately recognizable as Russian literature. Whether 
they're young, old or members of the author's own postwar generation, Tatyana 
Tolstaya's characters dream and yearn for elusive, lost or unattainable goals. 
In the rare instances where they achieve their desires, the consummation turns 
to dust, leaving the protagonist to bittersweet melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
Tolstaya, the descendant of one illustrious Russian literary family, partakes 
of her country's entire tradition. Though the 13 tales are contemporary and the 
style is intensely personal, the collection echoes with Dostoevsky's passion 
and Chekhov's wistfulness. Tolstaya writes with Andrei Bitov's satirical bite 
but occasionally lapses into Yevtushenko's sentimentality. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually a one-woman anthology of contradictory Russian attitudes, Tolstaya's 
frustration is tempered by a powerful sense of national identity; her hard 
feelings softened by a palpable love of the land. The frigid winters, the 
clammy autumns, the amazing springs and the short sweet summers are as 
important to her stories as the people, perhaps because you cannot create the 
complex Russian character without the climate. Moscow freezes, Siberia looms, 
Georgia basks in sunshine; Leningrad teases with glimpses of Scandinavian 
comfort and vanished imperial glory. Surrounded by choice, her characters are 
fixed in place by law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crucial Disappearances 
</P>
<P>
Consider Rimma, in "Fire and Dust." She's still a relatively young woman when 
the story begins, but she has already seen crucial disappearances -- "her 
radiant youth, the childhood of her children, the freshness of her hopes, as 
pale blue as the morning sky. . . . She had been promised every wreath, flower, 
island and rainbow, and where are they now?" Years pass, and Rimma is still 
living in a communal apartment, waiting for its last tenant to die, watching 
her once ambitious husband dozing in front of the TV, listening to the wild 
fantasies of her friend Svetlana, who has escaped into madness. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, desperate for any break in the monotony, Rimma settles for a sleazy 
blouse bought on the black market. Ahead of her is only "the whole viscous flow 
of the future years -- as yet unlived, but already known. . . ." For all its 
universality, Rimma's story has uniquely Russian aspects -- the old man, the 
ugly blouse, the dead-end jobs, all symbols of gratification perpetually 
deferred. 
</P>
<P>
Every story has these small, poignant details; volumes of social and political 
observation in a phrase. In "Sweet Shura," an old woman wears a marvelous hat 
decorated with snowballs, flowers and berries; "The cherries dropped down and 
clicked against one another." Where do you find such hats today, except in the 
bottom of a trunk, hoarded for half a century? And the memories -- "Finland in 
the spring. Crimes in the summer. White cakes, black coffee. Oysters -- very 
expensive. Theater in the evening." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Terrible Passivity 
</P>
<P>
The ancient woman tells the young narrator about the lover who begged her to 
elope with him. The train ticket was bought and the valise packed, but a 
terrible passivity kept her from leaving home. Listening, the writer imagines a 
crack in the universe through which old Shura could re-enter her life and take 
that train; a gap offering an alternative reality. 
</P>
<P>
In "Okkervil River," an elderly bachelor collects the second-hand records of a 
once famous soprano, fantasizing the life they might have had together. When he 
discovers that she's still alive, he seeks her out and pays a call, only to 
find a fat, coarse old woman who ignores him. 
</P>
<P>
A lonely young boy in "Date With a Bird" is befriended by a neighbor who 
enthralls him with adventure stories. Vibrant and fun-loving, a wonderful 
contrast to his own staid family, she becomes the focus of his life until the 
day he finds her in bed with the uncle he loathes. 
</P>
<P>
Though many of the stories deal with disillusion and resignation, the tone of 
the collection is vibrant; the plots inventive and the characters remarkably 
vigorous despite their anguish. Some books are the next best thing to a trip to 
their native ground, but "On the Golden Porch" is an exception; a distillation 
of atmosphere and personality so concentrated that it actually seems more 
intense than a first-hand experience; not just equal to being there but better.

KVEA SHAKEUP FUELS DEBATE AT LATINO STATIONS

<P>
For months, KVEA Channel 52 staffers have privately grumbled about the 
"miserable" representation of Mexicans or Mexican-Americans in key 
decision-making positions at Los Angeles' No. 2 Spanish-language TV station and 
its New York-based parent network.

But it took the departure of three ranking Latino staffers from KVEA's news 
department on Tuesday to make the debate public and give KVEA the distinction 
of becoming the second local Spanish-language station to come under fire in 
recent weeks for its staffing policies regarding Mexicans and 
Mexican-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, 80 of 150 employees at KMEX Channel 34 -- KVEA's chief rival -- 
signed an obliquely worded petition that was widely interpreted by staffers and 
Latino community leaders as a warning that viewers of Mexican descent are 
losing senior management positions within the station and its parent network, 
Univision. 
</P>
<P>
"KVEA's viewership is 90% Mexican and Mexican-American, but this station gives 
nothing back to the community at the leadership level," said Bob Navarro, a 
veteran reporter and news writer who for the past 10 months had been news 
director at KVEA. Until his firing Tuesday, he said, he had been the last 
Mexican-American in senior station management after the resignation in February 
of Frank Cruz, former vice president and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
As KMEX and Univision did with the allegations against them, management at KVEA 
and the parent Telemundo network denied Navarro's charges, citing the station's 
steady ratings gains as the best evidence of its popularity. 
</P>
<P>
"We produce a service that responds to and serves the community," said Stephen 
J. Levin, who replaced Cruz as vice president and general manager. "The 
community is overwhelmingly Mexican and Mexican-American. We would not be 
serving that community if we did not similarly (represent it) in our news and 
entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
Levin said KVEA still features several Mexican and Mexican-American reporters, 
including Alberto Aguilar, who anchors the station's half-hour local newscast 
at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Levin declined to characterize the nature of Navarro's departure. The other two 
employees, Ray Diaz, managing editor, and Mabel Solares, an assignment editor, 
resigned, a station spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Levin criticized Navarro for over-emphasizing local news while failing to 
report several major breaking international news stories, such as the 
pro-democracy protests in China and recent changes in Mexican law allowing 
American citizens to own land in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Other news staffers privately said another factor contributing to Navarro's 
ouster was a recent decline in KVEA's ratings for its 6 p.m. newscast. 
According to Arbitron Ratings Co., "Vea Noticias" went from a 1.9 rating, or a 
record 44% of the Latino audience, during the February sweeps to a 1.2 rating, 
or 33% audience share, during the May sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro challenged both these claims, arguing that Levin had gone to great 
lengths to tell his staff that he agreed with Navarro's local news emphasis. 
Despite his preferances, Navarro said he led many newscasts with breaking 
international news, including recent political developments Panama and Mexico 
City. 
</P>
<P>
The newsman, who previously worked at KNBC Channel 4 and KCBS Channel 2, added 
that the recent drop in "Vea Noticias' " ratings were due to the normal spring 
viewing drop-off, weaker lead-in shows and the new competition in April from 
KWHY Channel 22, the third Spanish-language station to broadcast in the Los 
Angeles market. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations of declining Mexican or Mexican-American representation in 
senior management have caught the attention of Latino community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"It (Navarro's departure) is beyond disappointment," Antonia Hernandez, 
president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, a 
national Latino civil rights organization, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an affront to our community that they feel they can bring people in who 
do not reflect the community. It sends a signal of total disregard." 
</P>
<P>
"Personnel issues aside, we are obviously concerned with this trend," said 
Armando Duron, president of the Los Angeles-based National Hispanic Media 
Coalition. "It is really ominous. We have been so involved in (pushing for 
higher Latino employment) in English-language TV that we've held off on 
Spanish-language TV. But it may well be time for us to look into the issue 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Like its rival, Univision -- which is principally owned by Hallmark Cards Inc. 
-- none of Telemundo's board of directors is Latino, a network official in New 
York said. 
</P>
<P>
Other network officials acknowledged that two of Telemundo's top eight managers 
are Latino -- neither of whom is Mexican or Mexican-American. At Univision, 
upper level management is all Latino, though only one of these executives is 
Mexican-American. 
</P>
<P>
Latino numbers at Telemundo improve when it comes to the general managers of 
the six TV stations it owns. Two of them are Cuban or Cuban-American and two 
are Mexican-American, network officials said. 
</P>
<P>
KVEA's Levin insisted that Telemundo's commitment to its Latino viewers must be 
viewed as a long-term investment. 
</P>
<P>
"Telemundo's truest goal is to create an environment in which Hispanics are 
trained for more management positions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same, Levin added, he cannot allow questions of national origin to 
dominate his thinking when it comes to staffing decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing you think about is where the person comes from," he said. "The 
important point is, are they experienced professionals who can put together a 
newscast that meets the station's philosophy?" 
</P>
<P>
Levin said that Roberto Soto, a Cuban-American who replaced Navarro, and 
Alfredo Fernandez, a Spaniard who replaces Diaz as executive producer, meet 
this standard. 
</P>
<P>
"If you do it any other way," he added, "it's reverse racism."

EAST JOINS WEST IN AN IMAGINATIVE ARTISTIC VENTURE

<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusual collaboration in China, an American and Chinese artist are trying 
to paint in a style that combines traditional Chinese freehand brushwork and 
modern abstract painting. 
</P>
<P>
American artist Elsa Marley, 52, spent most of her adult life on a commune in 
Northern California. She studied with Joan Miro in Spain and Hans Hoffman in 
New York and has a degree from the Vancouver School of Art and an MFA from the 
San Francisco Art Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese artist Chen Keliang, 37, is self-taught and a factory worker in 
Shanghai. He turned to art in his early 20s even though the Cultural Revolution 
had forced him, the son of an intellectual, to leave school and take a factory 
job. 
</P>
<P>
The result of their yearlong collaboration is "Joint Venture," an East-West 
landscape painting exhibition. It was recently exhibited at the Central Academy 
of Fine Art in Beijing. The exhibit opened at the Shanghai Academy of Fine Art 
Gallery in Hangzhou. If all goes as planned, the exhibition of 80 paintings -- 
his, hers and theirs -- will tour the United States this fall and winter, and 
Europe next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Elsa Marley and Chen Keliang have combined the best of Chinese and Western 
technique in these pictures, which are a wonderful contribution to our shared 
cultural experience in Shanghai," said Charles Sylvester, the U.S. consul 
general in Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
This is light-years away from Marley's life three years ago. She had come to 
some endings around the age of 50. Her commune days, at Black Bear Ranch near 
Mt. Shasta, were behind her. Her four children were grown and her husband was 
on his way to Europe for an indefinite stay. Finally, she said, even her art 
dwindled to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"I sat in my thousand-square-foot studio in Oakland producing nothing for a 
year. I still had my job (in administration) at the San Francisco Art 
Institute, but I desperately needed a major change in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Marley decided to try China. Her friend, Pulitzer Prize-wining poet Gary 
Snyder, had convinced her that paintings from her early years -- before she 
went in the direction of feminist-political art -- were extraordinarily similar 
to ancient Chinese landscapes from the Song Dynasty period (960-1279). He 
persuaded her to come here to study, or at least to visit China and see if it 
inspired her. 
</P>
<P>
"I found a way to get here, in 1986, as a chaperon for an art institute trip," 
Marley said. "Then I knew that I had to come back." 
</P>
<P>
Tentatively, she took a three-month leave of absence from the institute and 
signed on as an art history lecturer at the Zhejiang Academy of Fine Art in 
Hangzhou. That turned into two years. 
</P>
<P>
She called living in China "the most challenging thing I've ever done, because 
of the barriers of language and culture, and being alone and having no 
translator. And here, everything takes five times longer to do. I've never 
worked so hard in my life." 
</P>
<P>
After running out of money in Hangzhou, Marley moved to Shanghai and checked in 
at the U.S. Consulate there. 
</P>
<P>
"I was invited to teach art to the children there three afternoons a week, and 
they gave me a studio to work in." The arrangement has continued ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Because he is Chinese and without particular business at the U.S. Consulate, 
Chen is not allowed to enter there, so he can't work with Marley in her studio. 
And Marley is not allowed to enter the factory unit housing where Chen lives 
with his wife and 5-year-old daughter. Such regulations frustrate many Chinese 
and foreign residents who try to be friends. Most of the pair's collaborative 
paintings were done in the narrow space of her dorm room. But she plans to move 
into the home of a language professor soon. 
</P>
<P>
"When I move into the house, with a large room and the garden, we can paint 
there," she said. "It will be much better." 
</P>
<P>
Although Oriental art has been seen to influence Western art since the '50s, 
Marley believes that Chinese art is posed to make even more of an impact. "The 
new Chinese art that I've seen is not repressed. They have something to say, 
politically and emotionally. This is an exciting time to be here." 
</P>
<P>
The two artists met at a one-man exhibit of Chen's work at the Shanghai State 
Museum and struck up a friendship, although at the time Marley spoke little 
Chinese and Chen spoke no English. Their idea of merging the styles of two 
artists to create a new one follows in the footsteps of Picasso and Brock at 
the begining of Cubism, Marley said. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Chen said he was ready for a change. "I couldn't bear my 
paintings always looking so similar," he said in halting English. "I was always 
trying to make them different, but I hadn't made a breakthrough until I met 
Elsa." 
</P>
<P>
Chen's earlier paintings were quite traditional -- large ink washes of jagged 
mountains dotted with tiny houses and trees. Marley's early mountain scenes had 
given way to "inner landscapes" and modern abstract works, some angular and 
sharp, others dominated by mythical or nightmarish creatures. 
</P>
<P>
"I was doing a lot of feminist art," she said, "mostly in acrylics, with 
inspiration from the art of the Middle East, Egypt, Celtic, ancient Greece. . . 
. I was definitely looking for something, trying to find a new religion, some 
friends said. Now I've returned to landscapes, watercolors, circles, seasons." 
</P>
<P>
Chen's work, meanwhile, has become broader and more abstract. The mountain is 
their mutual metaphor, and most of their paintings seem to start with that, 
sometimes evolving into a watery purgatory or a womb, or thrusting into an 
ethereal lightness, or, rarely, a more traditional Chinese landscape. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine ever painting Western style again," Marley said. 
"Philosophically, living in China and working with Keliang have changed me 
irrevocably. And now my heart is divided. I can see myself as an old woman 
living and painting in the Snake River Mountains, or just sitting on a porch 
shelling peas, with ever dimmer eyes, and I will never be wholly in one place 
again. Part of me will be in China forever."

UNION BLASTS KTTV CONTRACT BUYOUT OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KTTV Channel 11's offer to buy out the contracts of its entire newsroom staff 
of writers, directors and producers is an attempt to institute an "unrestrained 
revolving-door policy" in which station management can hire, fire and demote 
union employees according to its latest whim, a union official representing the 
11 affected employees charged Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Fox-owned station offered what it called "an enhanced severance package" to 
its senior news staffers Wednesday and said it will replace any employees who 
choose to take the offer with new personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Smith, president of Local 53 of the National Assn. of Broadcast Employees 
&amp; Technicians, called KTTV's "unprecedented" offer "a means of getting what 
the station could not get in contract negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
KTTV management was not immediately available for comment but the station 
issued a statement that said the buyout offer is part of an "evaluation period" 
at "Fox News," in which "certain employees will be given an opportunity to 
consider their future with KTTV. . . . (The enhanced severance package) is a 
personal decision for each employee to whom it is offered. It is not 
appropriate to comment further." 
</P>
<P>
But Smith countered: "To ask your entire news department to leave within three 
weeks is unheard of and a little more than just an ongoing re-evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that Fox is about to make significant changes in its news department 
and wants to be free of its current shackles. It's the dream of every new news 
director to bring in his own people, but union contracts often preclude that 
and protect people who have worked there for years. Without these protections, 
the station can turn the news room into chaos and play with their employees as 
they choose." 
</P>
<P>
Smith pointed out that KTTV, which still trailed rival independent KTLA Channel 
5 by a wide margin in news in the May ratings sweeps, had recently hired a new 
managing editor, Wendy MacNeill, and a new executive producer, Larry Perret. 
</P>
<P>
NABET's 1988 contract with the station protected the seniority rights of all 
union employees hired before June 1, 1988, meaning writers, producers and 
directors cannot have their pay cut even if they are reassigned to less 
prestigious jobs. 
</P>
<P>
All employees hired after June 1, 1988, are union employees, but they do not 
have any of this protection, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
KTTV has proposed giving the five writers, three producers and three directors 
who are protected by the contract 26 weeks of pay at their regular rate plus 
four weeks for every year of service at the station. The news staffers must 
decide whether to accept the offer within three weeks and leave the station by 
the end of June, KTTV said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the 11 employees is being forced to accept the offer, but Smith said 
that if they refuse, the company will probably reassign them to menial tasks 
within the newsroom such as ripping wire copy or sweeping floors -- although 
with no loss in pay. Smith said that one director at the station had been 
reduced to ripping wire copy for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question in my mind that they would be placed in the most 
subservient, humiliating tasks and they (KTTV management) will then hire 
whoever they want," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that none of the 11 has decided what to do about the offer yet. 
</P>
<P>
Assignment editors, news assistants and on-air personnel were not affected by 
the buyout offer.

VESTRON DROPS THE PRICE TAGS ON MORE TITLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Patience is a video virtue. 
</P>
<P>
For people who love any of the following movies -- "Hoosiers," "Mad Max," "Mr. 
Mom," "Meatballs," "Fort Apache, the Bronx," "The Flamingo Kid" -- but held off 
buying the videocassettes, there's great news. Following the lead of Paramount 
and HBO in reducing some big-movie titles to $15, Vestron Video has announced 
that the above tapes and others will retail for $14.98 beginning Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Vestron will also lower the price on "Dirty Dancing," "The 
Running Man" and "Hamburger Hill" to $19.98. 
</P>
<P>
So movies are getting cheaper to own -- but only after a long wait. You can 
expect a lot more $15 titles before Christmas -- but only for tapes that have 
1) been available for the rental-oriented price of $80 or $90, 2) gone on to 
cable, and perhaps also 3) received an initial price reduction to a level 
between $20 and $30. 
</P>
<P>
However, for the patient VCR owner, the wait may be worth it: Since Vestron, 
like Paramount and HBO, has decided that the $15 movies will be duplicated at 
standard speed (and not a slower one, as some companies have done in putting 
out cheaper tapes), "Hoosiers" and the rest will be just as high-quality as the 
versions that cost many dollars more before the reduction. 
</P>
<P>
A Minnesota video company called Simitar Entertainment will have an even better 
deal on 10 movies beginning July 31 -- only $6.95 each! Of course, the movies 
aren't exactly A titles. There's a Jayne Mansfield picture ("Promises! 
Promises!") and one with Mamie Van Doren ("Three Nuts in Search of a Bolt") and 
something called "Polish Vampire in Burbank" -- then it's downhill from there. 
But Simitar will also offer 32 other non-movie tapes -- sports, exercise, etc. 
-- for the same price. 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
You know it's a slow week for first-time-on-tape movies when the standout is a 
TV movie. However, critics and "Andy Griffith Show" fans alike found "Return to 
Mayberry" (Forum, $29.98) one of the pleasures of the 1986 season. Reuniting 
Griffith, Ron Howard, Don Knotts, Jim Nabors and a dozen other members of the 
original cast, the low-key comedy was far better than most similar attempts at 
nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of which: Forum is simultaneously releasing "Perry Mason Returns" at 
the same price. Raymond Burr returned to his most famous role for this 1984 
made-for-TV mystery. 
</P>
<P>
Just about all that's left: "The Gunrunner" (New World, $89.95, no MPAA 
rating), a pretty obscure recent drama considering its lead actor, Kevin 
Costner, this violent film is set in 1920s Montreal; and "Picasso Trigger" 
(Warner, $79.95, R), a 1988 action-comedy starring Steve Bond (from "General 
Hospital") and several Playboy Playmates. 
</P>
<P>
Remember -- patience! Next week (Wednesday to be exact) brings "A Cry in the 
Dark," and coming attractions include "Twins" (June 15), "Pelle the Conqueror" 
(June 21), "Bird" (June 21), "Talk Radio" (July 13), "Mississippi Burning" 
(July 19) and "Wings of Desire" (Aug. 31). 
</P>
<P>
OTHER VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
ESPN, the all-sports cable channel, just dived into the tape business with 
seven titles. At $19.95 each are "Teaching Kids Tennis," "Teaching Kids Golf," 
"Teaching Kids Soccer" and "Slo Pitch Softball." At $29.95: "Catching More 
Bass" and "Basic Fly Fishing." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of sports, there's also "Mickey Mantle: The American Dream Comes to 
Life" (Media, $19.95), a biography of the Yankee slugger. And speaking of 
instruction there's "Play the Piano Overnight" (Xebec, $59.95), hosted by 
self-taught pianist-composer Patty Carlson. Information: (800) 622-0067. 
</P>
<P>
Or, if you want to hear and watch musicians, not be one, MPI offers "Queen: The 
Magic Years," a three-volume biography of the British band that gave sports 
arenas "We Are the Champions" and "We Will Rock You" ($19.95 for each of the 
55-minute tapes), and "Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers: A Bunch of Videos and 
Some Other Stuff" -- $24.95 for the clip compilation. TERRY ATKINSON

WISECRACKING ROBOT RENTS VIDEOTAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN FARLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's late at night. Your dog wants a walk. You're passing through the lobby of 
your apartment building when a voice calls out, "Psst, come over here. I wanna 
talk to you." 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry. It's only Vidi the robot. All he wants to do is rent you a video. 
To accomplish that, he'll dish out a little Hollywood gossip, crack a joke, 
show you a scene or two from a movie you're considering and maybe even tell you 
about the film maker. 
</P>
<P>
All this happens before you decide whether to rent the video, at the standard 
price of a dollar or two. 
</P>
<P>
Though the robot will tell you it likes to be called Vidi, its full name is 
Vidirobot 2001. Its maker, Agoura Hills-based Advanced Video Robotics Corp., 
has 50 or so such machines ready to be installed in California and Texas 
locales in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Vidi is just one sign that video rental machines are getting ready to compete 
in earnest for a share of the video rental market, and are becoming more 
user-friendly, as the computer term goes. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, "video dispensing machines will be just like (automated 
bank-teller) cash machines. There will be one on every corner," predicts John 
Lack, president of Nelson Vending Technology Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
His company, a subsidiary of Canadian-based Nelson Holdings, Ltd., already has 
200 machines in operation in Toronto that marry the technology of automatic 
bank teller machines with airline reservations software, so that renters can 
call a toll-free operator to find out which of the 200 machines has the movie 
they want, reserve the movie through the operator and pick it up at their 
convenience. 
</P>
<P>
With machines scattered about Toronto at convenience stores, gas stations, drug 
stores and subway stations, rentals peaked at 25,000 in a single week in 
January, said Lack. He said that Nelson, the sister company of Beverly 
Hills-based Nelson Entertainment, will double the number of machines it has in 
Toronto by the end of the year and expects to introduce them in the United 
States next year. 
</P>
<P>
Advanced Video Robotics hopes to have its Vidi machines in operation across the 
country within the next two to three years. Two already are on their way to 
Germany -- the first of 500 that have been ordered by Transcontinental, a video 
marketing company, according to Transcontinental president Ehrenfried Liebich. 
The first two, he said, will go into a Mercedes plant in Stuttgart and a 
pharmaceutical factory, Bayer-Leverkusen Ag., near Dusseldorf. 
</P>
<P>
Even more than places where people work and shop, however, Advanced Video 
Robotics President Bert Tenzer said that the cassette-dispensing machine is 
especially suited for apartment buildings, where the 7 x 3 1/2-foot device 
should be able to fit comfortably in the lobby. There, he hopes, the machine 
will be kept busy at night by residents who would prefer not to get out of 
their jammies and into their clothes for the ride to the video store. 
</P>
<P>
Other video vending machines already can be found in supermarkets and corporate 
cafeterias. Unlike them, Vidi is intended to be a showbiz character. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't call it a machine," Tenzer said, in mock horror. "We wanted to create 
something that was more than just a sterile machine -- a Coke machine, a 
cigarette machine." 
</P>
<P>
Vidi sits in the cockpit of a "space station." He has a screen for a face and 
speaks not in a robotized monotone, but with the voice of comedy writer and 
voice-over veteran Lennie Weinrib. 
</P>
<P>
If the machine senses a person approaching within a certain distance, it will 
initiate a conversation. After passing along a little "Entertainment 
Tonight"-type news -- a bit of showbiz gossip focusing on stars of the 
movie/video world, the voice will deliver a joke. Then it follows with a sales 
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
If the machine does everything Tenzer says it will do, "he (Tenzer) has a 
unique outlet," said the senior vice president of a major Hollywood studio, 
asking not to be identified because he didn't want to appear to be endorsing a 
product. The robot character "will certainly get people's attention," he said. 
"But that in itself won't make it successful. The key to success is location, 
location, location." 
</P>
<P>
A pioneer in the video-store business, Tenzer's previous company, the Video 
Connection of America Inc., was a nationwide franchiser with 500 stores. He 
sold that business to launch Advanced Video, which is now in search of 
potential franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
A public corporation, Advanced Video has "Star Trek's" William Shatner as its 
spokesman and a pair of former Texas politicians -- ex-Gov. Mark White and 
ex-Lt. Gov. Ben Barnes -- on its management team. (That's why Texas was chosen, 
along with California, as the introductory territory for Vidi.) 
</P>
<P>
Fifty simplified versions of the machine -- not Vidi as it exists today -- were 
placed around the country for a year to test the apparatus. Those are still in 
operation, but last spring, movie production designer John Vallone ("Star Trek: 
The Motion Picture," "48 HRS.") was recruited to perfect the new Vidi's design 
and look. 
</P>
<P>
Being an independent film maker himself, Tenzer came up with the idea for Vidi 
partly to introduce an unknown product to consumers. His own films (such as 
"The Summer of '70" and "2,000 Years Later") "bombed in our own stores" because 
he couldn't get franchisees to promote them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mom-and-Pop stores have become a failure at marketing or exploiting 
anything other than the big blockbuster hits coming off the movie circuit," he 
said. "The consumer sees an unknown title and they don't know whether it's 
garbage or what it's about, so they pass it by. No one in the video store is 
going to stand up and say, 'Mrs. Smith, this is great.' 
</P>
<P>
"This has been the biggest block to all these new-age video film makers to come 
forth. There's no money in it and no incentive for creative people who want to 
showcase their product and have it in the video store." 
</P>
<P>
Vidi to the rescue. Though the machine will stock mostly mainstream movie hits 
in its rotating supply of 100 videos, it'll also provide unknown titles and 
guide the renter to them.

CHINESE VIDEOS REINFORCE CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR VALLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't let the video-jammed racks and posters of ravishing Asian starlets fool 
you. A Chinese-American video rental shop is a lot like the communal well of a 
traditional Chinese village. 
</P>
<P>
The only difference is that the Southland's rapidly growing Chinese community 
gets its juicy stories told on magnetized tape instead of by word of mouth. 
Still, customers, shop owners and distributors agree, these videos from home 
reinforce Chinese language and culture with a wide array of choices, including 
Hong Kong detective thrillers, Mandarin-subtitled Japanese soaps and Tai Chi 
Chuan exercise videos. 
</P>
<P>
Just how many Chinese video shops are there in Southern California? It's hard 
to figure. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Soo, manager of San Francisco-based Hong Kong Video Programs Inc., a 
distributor of Hong Kong-produced TV shows and movies, said her company 
supplies 20 licensed distributors in Los Angeles who handle Cantonese-language 
movies and serials. International Audio Visual Communication Inc., distributor 
for Taiwan's three commercial television stations, supplies Mandarin-language 
videos, mostly TV serials, to 25 licensed shops in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
However, Soo said, there are also an indeterminate number of video shops, many 
of them Vietnamese-operated, which exist by pirating videos. 
</P>
<P>
S. C. Dacy, an independent film producer and avid Chinese movie fan, has a 
simple way of evaluating Chinese videos -- he lumps them into two piles: the 
"lousy" majority of TV soaps and the superior, action-packed, kung-fu feature 
films produced in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
"From the perspective of world cinema, they (Hong Kong movie producers) are per 
capita the best action movie-makers on the planet," he said about a genre of 
detective-martial arts thrillers where the operative concept is dangerously 
realistic stunts. 
</P>
<P>
"In 'A Better Tomorrow II,' they have Chou Yun Fat -- a combination Chinese 
Eddie Murphy and Tom Cruise -- walk out a house as they blow it up three feet 
behind him," Dacy said. "Their stars are stunt men. If the Chinese want to see 
a bunch of overpaid stars fake it, they can see American films." 
</P>
<P>
After their near extinction during the early '70s, Hong Kong-made features made 
a meteoric comeback in the '80s and are once again dominant with movies such as 
"A Better Tomorrow" being dubbed into Mandarin, Cantonese and other Asian 
languages. 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to sheer heart-rending delight, Ramona Bee, a mortgage banker 
from Arcadia, said nothing matches the Mandarin-language soaps produced in 
Taiwan. In fact, the 40-year-old Taiwan native is so addicted that she will sit 
through 20 hour-and-half-long episodes in a five-day span each time the latest 
soap comes to town. 
</P>
<P>
Nor can Hollywood soaps such as "Dynasty" replace her Taiwan-made favorites. 
"The American soaps are all about sex or drugs and power struggles," Bee said. 
By contrast, she said, Taiwanese soaps are more sentimental and preoccupied 
with Chinese family values and situations. They remind Bee of home and 
childhood because they're based on pulp novels she read while growing up as a 
girl in Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a Misty Future" is the quintessential Chinese soap, she said. It features 
a Cinderella-like young wife who must stand up to a duplicitous mother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
"The girl is from a poor family and she marries into a rich family. But the 
mother-in-law can't stand the girl. She has one face when the son is around and 
another when he's gone. So finally, the girl leaves her daughter behind and her 
husband goes blind. 
</P>
<P>
"Then she comes back 10 years later as a private tutor. But (her blind husband) 
can tell from the voice that it's her, but she denies it. Finally, it has a 
happy ending. They are so melodramatic. I cry and everything." 
</P>
<P>
Comedic ghost movies are another Hong Kong staple. But in contrast to kung-fu 
fare, films such as "Rouge" -- a 1987 feature about a stage-struck prostitute 
who comes back to haunt two jaded Hong Kong journalists -- are deeply rooted in 
China's ancient Taoist belief in an ancestral spirit world. This fascination in 
the afterlife can have some hilarious twists. For example, in one recent movie, 
Dacy said, the protagonist prevents a ghost from reincarnating by hanging 
woman's undergarments over the specter's head. 
</P>
<P>
Some stores, such as Paul Chang's Video Land in Monterey Park, offer 
pornographic videos produced in the Philippines, Singapore and Hong Kong that 
appeal to non-Asian customers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's curiosity," Chang said of his non-Asian customers. "They think 
the Asian woman is different. Everybody is curious of the other person's back 
yard. It's human nature."

BEIJING TIGHTENS CURBS ON FOREIGN REPORTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
China clamped tight new martial-law restrictions on foreign reporting in 
Beijing on Thursday, banning interviews with Chinese citizens and virtually all 
other forms of press coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The new rules also ban any photographing or videotaping in the areas around 
Tian An Men Square, the center of the city where approximately 10,000 young 
Chinese are continuing their demonstrations for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The crackdown on foreign news reporting could well signal an impending move by 
the Chinese regime to clear the demonstrators from Tian An Men Square. Early 
Thursday morning, a small contingent of Chinese troops was seen marching down a 
city street near the square. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Hint From Mayor 
</P>
<P>
In another hint that the authorities are on the verge of removing the 
pro-democracy demonstrators, Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong told a group of children 
Thursday: "I think that you will soon be able to pay tribute to the 
revolutionary martyrs at the Monument to the People's Heroes." 
</P>
<P>
That monument is located in the center of Tian An Men Square and is now 
surrounded by the demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday night, tensions in downtown Beijing were high. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of students gathered outside the gate of the Beijing municipal police 
headquarters near the south end of the square. Another crowd assembled outside 
the gate of Zhongnanhai, the Communist Party headquarters. Onlookers listening 
to students' speeches at Zhongnanhai spilled into Beijing's main thoroughfare, 
partially blocking the street. 
</P>
<P>
All but a few of the students outside Zhongnanhai dispersed around midnight. 
But about 500 students and a few other people, incensed by an alleged police 
beating of a student, spent the entire night in angry protest outside the 
police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the tenseness of the confrontation, both sides showed great restraint, 
as has been typical of virtually all such confrontations between students and 
security forces since martial law was imposed May 20. 
</P>
<P>
"Down with dictatorship! Long live democracy!" shouted the students, who 
despite their obvious anger maintained order throughout the night. 
</P>
<P>
The police, including about 20 who stood guard under a bright spotlight in 
front of the station throughout the night, showed virtually no reaction to the 
crowd, as if they were afraid of provoking a bigger incident. 
</P>
<P>
"These students aren't in turmoil," said a middle-aged woman who joined the 
crowd. "Our government is in turmoil. The police are in turmoil. They're 
arresting people as they please. Do we have laws or don't we? The officers must 
obey the law. The (officer who allegedly beat the student) should be punished 
severely according to the law." 
</P>
<P>
At dawn, the voice of a student who allegedly was beaten came on a police 
loudspeaker, after discussions inside police headquarters that included two or 
three other protesters, and said that officials had agreed to discuss the 
incident more thoroughly and seek to resolve it in a mid-morning meeting with 
student representatives. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged victim then urged the crowd to go back to Tian An Men Square to 
rest. Those gathered outside immediately accepted this and dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few days, Chinese authorities have shown increasing irritation 
over a huge white "Goddess of Democracy" statue that Beijing art students 
erected at Tian An Men, just across from the portrait of Mao Tse-tung 
overlooking the square. Thousands of young Chinese have had their pictures 
taken in front of the Styrofoam-and-plaster "Goddess," which resembles the 
Statue of Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
Students camped on the square pitched 60 red and blue camping tents on all 
sides of the statue to help ensure that no sudden raid by police or soldiers 
could snatch it away. 
</P>
<P>
The official Chinese news media have begun to take a tougher line towards the 
pro-democracy demonstrators, suggesting that the regime's hands-off approach of 
the past few weeks is coming to an end. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A State of Anarchy' 
</P>
<P>
"Many places have been in a state of anarchy," the Beijing Daily, this city's 
official newspaper, declared Thursday. "The degree of disorder in some sense 
has been similar to that of the Cultural Revolution." 
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials announced the new restrictions on press coverage here during 
a weekly news briefing at the Chinese Foreign Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the approval by the Beijing Municipal People's Government, foreign 
journalists or journalists from Hong Kong, Macao or Taiwan shall conduct no 
press coverage, photographing, and videotaping of the troops enforcing martial 
law," said Ding Weijun, a spokesman for the Beijing government. 
</P>
<P>
Ding said press coverage, photographing or filming is banned in the downtown 
areas around Tian An Men Square and the Great Hall of the People. 
</P>
<P>
The rules also bar foreign correspondents from "press coverage in a disguised 
form, such as making appointments with Chinese citizens to meet at the offices 
or residences of foreign journalists . . . or at hotels or elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Reporters or photographers who run afoul of the new rules have no rights of 
appeal to the Chinese courts. The decree on news reporting says it is up to 
Beijing municipal authorities to settle disputes over how the rules should be 
interpreted. 
</P>
<P>
However, authorities gave no indication of how strictly or swiftly they would 
seek to enforce the new rules, and it was unclear even whether they are united 
in their will to do so. Members of the foreign press corps said they will 
continue working as they had before until officials clarify their intentions. 
</P>
<P>
China has expelled at least five foreign correspondents over the past decade. 
The most recent two cases were in early 1987, when an American reporter for 
Agence France Presse and a Japanese reporter for Kyodo News Service were forced 
to leave China after their coverage of student demonstrations for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earlier Rules Vague 
</P>
<P>
When the Chinese regime first imposed martial law in Beijing nearly two weeks 
ago, it included a series of restrictions on foreign press coverage. But those 
earlier rules were vaguely worded -- leaving unclear, for example, whether they 
applied in the areas around Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few days, Chinese authorities have called in representatives of 
several foreign television networks, the British Broadcasting Corp. and the 
Japanese newspaper Yomiuri to warn them about possible violations of martial 
law. 
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Correspondents Club of Beijing issued a written statement Thursday 
calling the restrictions on foreign reporting here "a deplorable case of press 
censorship and harassment." The ban on press coverage "calls into question 
China's policy of openness to the outside world," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the imposition of martial law in the nation's capital and the 
disappearance from public sight of Communist Party General Secretary Zhao 
Ziyang, who refused to endorse the martial-law decree, the Chinese regime told 
foreign correspondents Thursday that there are no serious problems here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Says Government Is Stable 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua assured reporters at the weekly news 
briefing that the Chinese government is stable. She said China's policies on 
economic reform and opening to the outside world are unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
"China hopes that foreign investment in China won't be affected," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Li also asserted that there have been no changes in leadership positions of the 
Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, the People's Liberation Army 
or the National People's Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Beijing remains surrounded by an estimated 150,000 to 300,000 troops called 
here from other regions of China when some of the People's Liberation Army 
forces stationed in the Beijing area reportedly refused to enforce martial law 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Zhao, the party secretary, has not been seen since the night of May 19, when he 
made an emotional, tearful appearance before some of the demonstrators. He has 
reportedly been under house arrest. In addition, a source in Hong Kong who is 
in touch with Zhao's family has reported that the Chinese Communist Party was 
preparing to denounce Zhao as a counterrevolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong newspapers have reported that several other senior Chinese officials, 
including Defense Minister Qin Jiwei and Wan Li, chairman of the Standing 
Committee of the National People's Congress, would be ousted from their 
leadership positions along with Zhao. 
</P>
<P>
Besides having the potential to inhibit foreign press coverage at Tian An Men 
Square, the new restrictions on news reporting may also be aimed at cutting out 
leaks from Chinese sources to foreign correspondents about the ongoing power 
struggle within the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, several documents have circulated which give accounts of 
recent party deliberations, such as a reported speech by President Yang 
Shangkun urging party elders to take action against Zhao.

GENE-SPLICED ANEMIA DRUG OKD FOR SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY STAVRO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A genetically engineered drug expected to relieve the chronic anemia suffered 
by thousands of people with kidney disease was approved for sale Thursday by 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The drug also has shown promise in 
treating anemia in AIDS and cancer patients, but it was not yet approved for 
those uses by the government. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement capped an eight-year effort by Amgen Inc. of Thousand Oaks to 
bring to market what is expected to be one of biotechnology's first blockbuster 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Amgen's costly drug -- known as erythropoietin, or EPO -- is a gene-spliced 
version of a naturally occurring protein in the kidney that triggers production 
of red blood cells, which in turn transport oxygen throughout the body. 
Patients suffering from kidney disease do not produce enough red blood cells 
and often have very little energy, and many of them must endure frequent blood 
transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 100,000 kidney dialysis patients in this country, and the 
25,000 or so who need frequent transfusions are ideal candidates for EPO, 
experts say. In clinical tests, most patients given injections of EPO no longer 
needed blood transfusions and found that much of their old energy returned. 
</P>
<P>
EPO is being tested with the AIDS drug AZT in hopes of minimizing anemia, and 
is being reviewed for treating the types of anemia suffered by patients with 
cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel very strongly that there will be other uses," said FDA Commissioner 
Frank Young. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a tremendous demand from patients for the product," said David Weber, 
a securities analyst with the brokerage firm of Alex. Brown &amp; Sons. "There 
were even stories of people who tried very hard to get into the clinical 
trials" for EPO, Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA approved EPO, which will be sold under the brand name Epogen, only for 
anemia caused by kidney disease. However, once it is on the market, doctors may 
prescribe it for anemia due to other causes, although that practice has note 
been endorsed by the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
One drawback of the drug is its cost. It could become one of the most expensive 
drugs ever reimbursed by the federal government, eventually costing perhaps 
$200 million to $500 million a year overall for all kidney dialysis patients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Government's Costs 
</P>
<P>
The average patient suffering from kidney disease would need $4,000 to $8,000 
worth of the drug every year, but Gordon Binder, Amgen's chief executive, said 
he expects the federal government to cover most of that expense. Until EPO is 
approved for other uses, however, it will not be determined how much of the 
cost would be picked up in those cases. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland), who is chairman of the health subcommittee of the 
House Ways and Means Committee, said he is concerned about the hundreds of 
millions of dollars that the use of EPO could cost the federal government. Some 
of that concern may stem from the fact that members of Stark's staff, using 
data released in a court battle between Amgen and another manufacturer, 
calculated that it would cost only only $140 to manufacture a year's supply of 
the drug for an average patient. 
</P>
<P>
Amgen officials said the high price being charged for the drug would help the 
company recoup the cost of developing EPO, estimated at $100 million, and would 
provide money to develop other new products. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Amgen, the winners from the FDA approval are the patients who have been 
waiting to get the drug. Amgen expected to start selling EPO last winter, but 
when things were delayed, some frustrated kidney dialysis patients began buying 
EPO by mail order from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Patients such as Valerie Buhler of Pasadena were taking advantage of an obscure 
FDA policy that allows for personal importation of most drugs that are legally 
available overseas, as long as they are purchased in small amounts and for 
personal use. 
</P>
<P>
Since March, Buhler, 65, has been spending $650 a month out of her own pocket 
to buy EPO from a pharmacy in West Germany. Before she began her twice-a-week 
treatments, "running a few errands just tired me out," she said. Since then, 
"The difference has been remarkable." 
</P>
<P>
She added, "As happy as I've been with the results, I can't help but feel bad 
for other people who don't have the drug." The FDA's approval, she said, was 
"fantastic," and timely as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just about to order some more from Germany," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kidney disease patients who lack the natural protein would take regular 
injections of the drug for life to prevent the anemia. "It's almost like 
insulin if you're diabetic," said Louise J. Keating, director of Northern Ohio 
Red Cross Blood Services and chairman of the FDA advisory committee that 
recommended the drug's approval. 
</P>
<P>
As the first company to win approval to sell EPO, Amgen is expected to win a 
big chunk of the market for kidney dialysis patients, which is expected to be 
at least $250 million a year by the early 1990s. For now, there is no 
alternative to EPO, a fact that has excited the financial community. 
</P>
<P>
The drug, Amgen's first commercial product, "is clearly a home run" for the 
company, said Denise Gilbert, a biotechnology analyst with Montgomery 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very excited. We've worked eight years for this day," Binder said. 
</P>
<P>
Binder said the first shipments of the drug, marketed under the trade name 
Epogen, will arrive next week in doctors' offices. By the end of the year, 
Binder expects Amgen to be selling EPO at a rate of $100 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Amgen's stock, traded over the counter, closed Thursday at $41 a share, up 87.5 
cents, as 1.1 million shares of stock changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
Amgen has kept the rights to sell EPO to the kidney dialysis market but it has 
licensed all other uses of the drug in this country to Johnson &amp; Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
How much business Amgen will enjoy is unclear because the company is locked in 
a major patent infringement lawsuit over EPO with biotech rival Genetics 
Institute of Cambridge, Mass. Amgen and Genetics Institute hold different 
patents related to EPO and a patent infringement trial is scheduled to begin 
Aug. 7 in Boston. In a separate case, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will 
begin hearings this summer to decide which of the two rival companies' EPO 
claims have priority. 
</P>
<P>
In the past Amgen officials have refused to consider an out-of-court 
cross-licensing agreement with Genetics Institute, a tactic some analysts say 
is risky. Binder said Thursday, however, that an out-of-court agreement "is 
always a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Settlement 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Eisen, chief patent counsel with Genetics Institute, also said that an 
out-of-court pact is possible before the patent trial begins. "It's quite 
common that cases are settled on the courthouse steps. When the moment of 
confrontation comes, somebody flinches." 
</P>
<P>
The FDA awarded so-called orphan drug status to Amgen's EPO, which ordinarily 
would give the company a seven-year exclusive right to sell the drug to kidney 
dialysis patients. Orphan drug status covers drugs that treat patients 
suffering from relatively rare diseases, those with fewer than 200,000 cases. 
</P>
<P>
But the FDA also said it might also award orphan drug status to another version 
of EPO that has been developed by Chugai-Upjohn using technology licensed by 
Genetics Institute. Joseph Sobota, chief operating officer at Chugai-Upjohn, 
said his company hopes to win FDA approval within six months and expects to be 
"a vigorous competitor" despite Amgen's head start. 
</P>
<P>
Amgen's Binder said, "We've always been more concerned with patent protection 
than orphan drug status." 
</P>
<P>
Spending heavily to prepare for the launch of the drug, Amgen lost $8 million 
in its fiscal year ended March 31. However, analyst Gilbert expects Amgen to 
have pre-tax earnings of $70 million from EPO sales by 1993.

GOVERNOR OKS BUDGET HIKES FOR SOCIAL PROGRAMS

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, in a move aimed at reducing tensions with the 
Democrat-controlled Legislature, Thursday agreed to substantial increases in 
budgets for mental health, youth camps, health services for the poor and 
nursing programs for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian disclosed his change in position in announcing how he wants to 
divide the lion's share of the $2.5-billion tax windfall that turned up in May 
as a result of unexpectedly high state income tax receipts. 
</P>
<P>
The development came as the Senate unanimously approved, on a rare 40-0 vote, a 
$49.7-billion version of the new state budget that included a hotly debated 
amendment that would virtually wipe out Medi-Cal abortions for poor women. 
Anti-abortion senators introduced the amendment in spite of repeated rulings by 
the state Supreme Court that such restrictions are unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Abortion Debate 
</P>
<P>
The fractious debate over abortion contrasted sharply with the general 
good-humored tone that accompanied easy passage of the the budget proposal. The 
vote moves the Legislature closer to a Senate-Assembly conference committee 
that will negotiate the lawmakers' final budget proposal, which will be sent to 
the governor. The Senate budget now goes to the Assembly, which is scheduled to 
vote on its own version Monday. 
</P>
<P>
There was immediate evidence that the governor had reduced tension in the 
Legislature by offering to spend substantially more money on programs backed 
strongly by Democrats. Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los 
Angeles) told the Senate that in January Deukmejian had "presented us with a 
bleak budget highlighted by painful reductions in basic programs to people in 
need. The recent discovery of new, unexpected revenues has changed all that." 
</P>
<P>
Roberti, who often in the past has collided head-on with Deukmejian, said 
during the Senate debate that the governor "must be credited with his 
willingness to work with the leadership of both houses on a bipartisan basis to 
untangle the complex web" of issues that now stand in the way of fashioning a 
final budget. 
</P>
<P>
Although numerous points of disagreement still exist between the Republican 
governor and the Democrat-controlled Legislature, Deukmejian's budget 
announcement erased some of the most controversial proposals he made last 
January when it looked like the state would not collect enough tax revenues to 
pay all its bills. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican governor last January proposed getting out of the tight squeeze 
on state finances by making whopping cuts in numerous health and welfare 
programs. The suggested cuts rankled Republican as well as Democratic lawmakers 
-- and touched off months of demonstrations and furious lobbying by health and 
welfare interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contingent on Agreement 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, in his announcement Thursday, made it clear that his latest budget 
proposals are contingent on agreement being reached on the broader fiscal 
issues referred to by Roberti. On the bargaining table are proposed changes in 
the state spending limit, long-term funding for public schools and a 10-year, 
$18.5-billion transportation improvement program. 
</P>
<P>
The governor, who has already had four sessions with legislative leaders in the 
last two weeks, plans to meet with top lawmakers from the Assembly and Senate 
again next week. 
</P>
<P>
Working with the $2.5 billion in expected new revenues, Deukmejian proposed 
funding for a series of programs he had earlier marked for substantial 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, he proposed full funding of county juvenile justice programs at 
a level of $67 million. In January, he had proposed cutting $30.4 million from 
the juvenile justice programs, a move that local officials warned could lead to 
the shutdown of highly successful youth camps. Local officials said that if 
Deukmejian's cuts went through, an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 delinquent youths 
either would be transferred to the California Youth Authority, where 
incarceration is more costly, or released outright. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major Move 
</P>
<P>
In another major move, Deukmejian proposed an additional allocation of $259 
million for health programs serving the working poor. Deukmejian had been 
criticized for proposing to cut money from health programs for the indigent, 
then replacing the funds with new tobacco taxes raised by Proposition 99. 
Critics called the governor's proposal illegal. Under Deukmejian's new plan, 
the $259 million for health care for indigents would be in addition to tobacco 
tax allocations. 
</P>
<P>
On top of those proposals, Deukmejian said he wants to provide full funding of 
$350 million for community mental health programs. He had proposed cutting more 
than $200 million from local mental health programs. He also said on Thursday, 
in contrast to an earlier position, that he now plans no reduction in the 
budget for in-home supportive services, a program designed to assist elderly 
and sick shut-ins with various support services. 
</P>
<P>
Some substantial differences remain between Deukmejian and legislators. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, for example, said in his announcement that he wants $1.45 billion 
set aside in a reserve fund for unexpected future budget needs. Neither version 
of the budget coming together in the Assembly and Senate sets aside a fixed 
amount for the reserve. 
</P>
<P>
And Deukmejian did not back away from his proposal to freeze monthly support 
payments to welfare recipients and aged, blind and disabled people receiving 
state aid, a plan sharply criticized by Democrats. That is one of the thorniest 
issues that remains to be negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-San Jose), chairman of the 
Assembly Ways and Means Committee, called Deukmejian's turnaround 
"encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Brett, the governor's press secretary, said the tax windfall was clearly 
the leading factor in Deukmejian's shift in thinking. Brett said Deukmejian had 
proposed the deep cuts only because the state did not have enough money to 
cover all its obligations when the governor drafted his original 1989-90 budget 
in January. "It was out of a sense of necessity that he did it. Conditions 
clearly have changed," Brett said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sense of Frustration' 
</P>
<P>
During the intense Senate debate over abortion funding, Democratic Floor Leader 
Barry Keene of Benicia noted that anti-abortion legislators had failed to get 
their way over the years and now "out of a sense of frustration they strike out 
against poor women." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Doolittle of Rocklin, the GOP caucus chairman, introduced the 
amendment to eliminate funding for abortions except in cases of rape or incest 
or when the mother's life is endangered. "We don't want abortion used as a 
method of birth control" at taxpayers' expense, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment narrowly passed 21 to 19, generating both Democratic and 
Republican support.

MEDI-CAL MOVES TO ENCOURAGE MORE PRIVATE OBSTETRIC SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SPIEGEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the hopes of encouraging more private obstetricians to treat low-income 
pregnant women, state Medi-Cal officials agreed in court documents filed 
Thursday to adhere to a higher payment rate for doctors and to speed the 
payment of their claims. 
</P>
<P>
A coalition of legal aid attorneys negotiated the settlement to resolve a 
class-action lawsuit they filed 18 months ago on behalf of thousands of 
low-income women statewide who were unable to find private doctors to care for 
them during their pregnancy. In more than a dozen counties across the state, 
not a single obstetrician would treat pregnant women on Medi-Cal, the attorneys 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this marks the turning point in the decline of obstetrical services to 
these under-served women and will help bring back the many doctors who have 
dropped out of Medi-Cal," said Dr. Benson Harer, chairman of the California 
district of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. 
</P>
<P>
Low reimbursement rates and a cumbersome claims process have triggered a "mass 
exit" of obstetricians from the Medi-Cal program that insures about 100,000 
pregnant women annually, said Standley Dorn, one of the attorneys who brought 
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1985 and 1987, when the lawsuit was filed, there was a 15% decline in 
the number of private physicians in Los Angeles County who provided obstetrical 
care for Medi-Cal women. There were also declines of 27% in Sacramento County, 
12% in San Diego County and 19% in Santa Clara County, according to attorney 
Robert Newman, who also represented the women in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
One plaintiff in the lawsuit, a pregnant Fullerton woman insured by Medi-Cal, 
claims to have called 10 obstetricians in her community and found that none of 
them accepted Medi-Cal. She charged that when she went in search of a doctor at 
an Orange County hospital, she was told that none of the obstetricians with 
admitting privileges there accepted Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the settlement, which will not be final until September when 
it is scheduled to be approved by a federal district judge in Sacramento, state 
health officials agreed to speed the processing of doctors' claims, promising 
to pay 90% of them within 25 days and 99% within 85 days. Also, state health 
officials will set up toll-free telephone lines to answer doctors' questions, 
and physicians will be able to instantly confirm a patient's Medi-Cal 
eligibility through a computerized telephone verification system. 
</P>
<P>
Since the lawsuit was filed, the state has gradually increased payments to 
doctors for prenatal care, delivery and postpartum care from $650 to more than 
$1,000. The settlement commits the state to continue this rate. 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Health Services Director John Rodriguez said the settlement 
'represents "a lot of movement and a lot of progress. . . . I'm glad we got it 
settled." 
</P>
<P>
"It's now possible for obstetricians . . . to give care and break even," Dorn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Lazarus, with Children Now, a nonprofit, children's rights organization, 
hailed the settlement's provisions as "a really hopeful sign" for women and 
babies statewide. 
</P>
<P>
She said the most recent state health department statistics for 1986 show that 
7.3% of the 480,000 women a year who give birth in California receive late or 
no prenatal care. Compared to other states, California ranks 36th in terms of 
the percentage of women receiving adequate prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
Studies have repeatedly shown that spending money on prenatal care is cost 
effective because it helps prevent the birth of premature, low-weight infants 
who are prone to mental retardation and other handicaps that require costly 
medical care.

KREMLIN AGRICULTURE CHIEF DENOUNCED AS INCOMPETENT 
</P>

<P>
Yegor K. Ligachev, the Communist Party Politburo member in charge of Soviet 
agriculture, was denounced as incompetent Thursday as rebellious members of the 
Congress of People's Deputies, the Soviet Union's new assembly, continued their 
unrestrained assault on the country's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
In a scathing attack, a leading agricultural specialist said that Ligachev, the 
voice of conservatism within the ruling Politburo, simply knew nothing about 
farming, nothing about rural life and nothing about the agrarian economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Why has such a politically important sphere -- decisive for perestroika -- 
been given to a man who is so absolutely ignorant of it and who had already 
failed (to provide leadership) in ideology?" Yuri D. Chernichenko, a 
commentator on agricultural affairs, demanded. "How could this happen?" 
</P>
<P>
Heads swiveled in the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses, where the 2,250 deputies 
have been meeting for a week, toward the special section where Ligachev was 
sitting with other members of the Politburo. But Ligachev's countenance was 
impassive through the howls of laughter at Chernichenko's sarcasm and then the 
applause for his boldness. 
</P>
<P>
Freed from past political restraints and given a Kremlin forum, the newly 
elected deputies are saying things, all broadcast live on television and radio 
across the country and printed in the press the next day, that the most radical 
of dissidents would have hesitated to whisper behind locked doors even five 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Every attempt by the leadership to limit debate has so far been rejected by the 
deputies, who now are discussing President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
state-of-the-union report -- and who could do so for several more days as 
scores more deputies ask to speak. The inaugural session was supposed to have 
ended Wednesday or Thursday, but could now go on for another week. 
</P>
<P>
No one, not even Gorbachev, has been spared in the heated, sometimes tumultuous 
debates as the congress has split into progressive and conservative wings and 
entered many previously "forbidden zones," including national defense, foreign 
policy, the security services and the Communist Party leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the criticism, Vadim A. Medvedev, the Politburo member now in charge of 
ideology, said after Thursday's session that he was pleased with the first week 
of the congress. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going in the right direction," he told reporters. "The forms for giving 
power to the people will be perfected. . . . It is very good that we are 
finding the way forward through discussion. Consolidation of opinion, of 
people, is the way to tackle our problems." 
</P>
<P>
But another Politburo member, Lev N. Zaikov, the Moscow party chief, said he 
thought the criticism went too far at times, and he defended Ligachev. 
</P>
<P>
"You just can't take the podium, not knowing a person, and say such things," 
Zaikov said. "Ligachev is trying to fulfill the tasks assigned to him by the 
Politburo. We all try to be trustworthy Communists." 
</P>
<P>
Chernichenko, respected as one of the most insightful specialists on 
agricultural policy and rural development, had ridiculed -- to the laughter of 
hundreds of other deputies -- the performance of the state-run agricultural 
system, whose poor output is a national crisis as well as a disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
"How can it be explained . . . that the economy that produces five times more 
tractors and 10 times more combine harvesters than the United States produces 
only half as much bread?" Chernichenko asked, naming Ligachev whose Politburo 
status would have protected him from such direct attacks in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The implicit question in Chernichenko's broadside went well beyond agriculture, 
however, to the balance of power between progressive and conservative forces 
within the top party leadership -- particularly after Gorbachev himself had 
complained that agricultural reforms, despite decisions of the party's 
policy-making Central Committee, were being blocked by conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev, a graduate of an aircraft design institute, was the party leader in 
the Siberian city of Tomsk for nearly 20 years, coming to Moscow in 1983 and 
handling ideological matters until he was shifted to agriculture nine months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Where Gorbachev has emphasized family farming and private business as the way 
to increase food production and revive rural areas, Ligachev has continued to 
insist on maintaining the system of collective and state farms that the Soviet 
Union has developed over the past 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Chernichenko said that he believes the country's food shortages would be ended 
within three years and that the rural economy would flourish if the congress 
voted to restore ownership of agricultural land to the farmers and to permit 
unrestricted private enterprise in rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
"And who is against this?" he said, looking in Ligachev's direction. 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev later came under attack from another deputy, Nikolai Ivanov, a top 
investigator of official corruption, who had alleged earlier that the Politburo 
member was among the top officials figuring in a major investigation and that a 
cover-up was under way. 
</P>
<P>
Suspended from the case and placed under investigation himself, Ivanov asked 
whether this itself was not evidence of an attempted cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
"Sixty-four investigators, including myself and Telman Gdlyan (another deputy), 
have been relieved of our duties," Ivanov complained. "Why in that case should 
you not relieve Ligachev and others of their duties until this matter is 
settled?" 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev has denied any wrong-doing.

PROBE OF BALTIC ANNEXATIONS PLANNED

The Congress of People's Deputies moved Thursday to investigate whether the 
Baltic republics willingly joined the Soviet Union, after historian Roy A. 
Medvedev and other deputies charged that the Kremlin forcibly annexed them and 
then doctored the truth. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, responding to a request from an Estonian 
deputy, supported setting up a commission to look into whether secret clauses 
in a 1939 pact with Nazi Germany assigned Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to the 
Soviet Union, paving the way for annexation a year later. 
</P>
<P>
"The Baltic republics are stirred up by this issue. It is not an easy question, 
but we should not evade it," Gorbachev told the congress on the seventh day of 
its inaugural session. "There should be both a political and legal analysis." 
</P>
<P>
But the Kremlin chief said he doubted that the peoples of Lithuania, Estonia 
and Latvia had opposed joining the Soviet Union five decades ago. "This is 
hardly the case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has never formally recognized the move.

OVERSEE KGB? SURE, CHIEF SAYS

Vladimir Kryuchkov, the head of the KGB, said Thursday that the Soviet security 
and intelligence apparatus is "interested in" and "absolutely" supportive of a 
commission of the new Congress of People's Deputies that would oversee his 
secret police agency. 
</P>
<P>
And he said that under Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of perestroika, "a great 
deal of noble aspects of KGB activities" will become more apparent, such as 
"our struggle against terrorism." In that effort, he added, the KGB had had 
"certain contacts" with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Kryuchkov discussed the KGB with several Western reporters a day after Yuri 
Vlasov, a Moscow deputy to the new congress, condemned the feared intelligence 
agency as an "underground empire" that "exercises a comprehensive control over 
society." 
</P>
<P>
The boldness of Vlasov's remarks, yet another sign of the new freedoms set 
loose by perestroika, caused a sensation among the deputies. Vlasov accused the 
KGB of still holding dissidents in psychiatric hospitals to prevent political 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"If he spoke such a speech seven years ago, he would have gone to prison 10 
years at a minimum," said an Estonian deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Also remarkable has been the access Western and Eastern Bloc reporters have had 
to traditionally inaccessible figures such as Kryuchkov and members of the 
ruling Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
Kryuchkov, who became head of the KGB last autumn, said Thursday that the 
agency now considers the battle against terrorism "the most important direction 
of our operational activities." 
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to cooperate with anyone in our struggle against terror," he 
said, expressing appreciation for Israel's handing over hijackers who had used 
Soviet schoolchildren as hostages to get a plane to Israel last December. 
</P>
<P>
The head of the KGB also said his agency wants to see an oversight commission 
on state security formed by the new congress. "Maybe we'll have to borrow some 
experience from Americans," he said referring to congressional committees that 
are supposed to oversee the CIA. "We are interested in such a commission. Maybe 
(some activities) will be corrected. There'll be a chance of discussion."

EDGY ISRAELIS DEVISE NEW WAYS TO CONTROL PALESTINIANS

PETAH TIKVA, Israel 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I call it war," declared Mayor Giora Lev, a burly former general who intends 
to do his part by sweeping the streets of this city clean of Palestinian day 
labor. "The Arabs are not welcome here. Ask the people." 
</P>
<P>
In an atmosphere inflamed by increasing violence here in Israel and in the 
occupied territories, the mayor, backed by an overwhelming majority of his city 
council, has designated a spot on the edge of town where Arabs seeking casual 
day labor must wait to be hired. They will no longer be permitted to walk the 
streets of Petah Tikva in search of jobs, or for any other reason. 
</P>
<P>
Fear and suspicion fueled by the 17-month-old uprising of Palestinians against 
the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, the intifada, have spurred 
demands for Israeli controls at various levels. For instance: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the occupied Gaza Strip, home to more than 650,000 Palestinians, most of 
them living in squalid refugee camps, the Israeli army is preparing to 
introduce a program next week requiring workers with jobs within Israel to 
carry special identity cards, similar to plastic credit cards, according to 
press reports. In effect, the card will be an exit permit from Gaza, and any 
Gazan found within Israel without the permit will be detained. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50,000 Gazans have been working in Israel, but no Palestinian has 
been permitted to leave the territory since early last month when two Israeli 
soldiers hitchhiking in the area disappeared. One was later found buried in a 
shallow grave, igniting a rage for vengeance among Jews who blamed Arabs for 
the death. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At Ariel, a Jewish settlement of 8,000 in the occupied West Bank, leaders 
decided to force Arab day workers there to wear badges identifying themselves 
as "foreign workers" for security reasons. When Jewish critics complained that 
the program had overtones of the yellow Star of David that Jews were forced to 
wear under Nazi rule in Europe, the Ariel leadership retreated and changed the 
regulation to require all visitors of the settlement, Arab or Jew, to wear a 
special badge. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the practice was assailed Thursday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"We would find this practice offensive and in our view . . . incompatible with 
democratic values," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told a news 
briefing. 
</P>
<P>
In Petah Tikva, in the heart of Israel just east of Tel Aviv, Mayor Lev insists 
that special circumstances apply. 
</P>
<P>
"Petah Tikva is not Haifa, it's not Jaffa," he explained, mentioning two cities 
with Israeli Arab communities. "Petah Tikva is a purely Jewish city, and it's 
been one for 110 years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Mother of Settlements' 
</P>
<P>
An industrial center of 140,000 people, Petah Tikva is called "the mother of 
settlements" in Israel. It was formed late last century by European Zionists in 
what was then a largely Arab Palestine under Ottoman Turkish rule. The name 
means Gate of Hope. 
</P>
<P>
Its 800 factories depend in part on Arab labor from the outside and, the mayor 
said, "many thousands" work here. Before the intifada, he said, there had been 
little tension between Arab and Jew here, but now, Lev remarked, "people have 
the feeling that the war from Judea and Samaria (the West Bank) has come home." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Casual Laborers a Concern 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of the city's Arab workers have regular jobs in the factories 
and shops and, the mayor said, are no cause for concern. But casual laborers 
are another matter to him. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two months, Lev said, four small bombs have exploded in the city, 
though without causing injuries. He blames the Palestinians. And, he asserts, 
"In my neighborhood we had girls raped by Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
"From a security point of view, we have a problem," he insisted. "We also have 
a crime problem." 
</P>
<P>
As Lev sees it, the problems began when day laborers, who used to wait at the 
edge of town for the chance of work, began drifting farther into the center of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Now they're walking all over the streets," he said, and he wants them off. 
"They steal laundry," he asserted. "They use people's yards to relieve 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Denying his remarks smacked of racism, Lev responded: "I don't hate the Arab. 
It's a fact." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mayor Plans a 'Shade' 
</P>
<P>
His solution is to designate a junction near the city limits. He calls it a 
"shade" -- green plastic stretched over an open-sided tubular steel frame on a 
patch of hard-packed stone about 10 feet by 40 feet. The mayor figures his 
shade will provide comfort for 200 to 300 day laborers as they wait for 
employers to come by in the early morning to offer them jobs. They will be 
driven to the workplace, and returned to the shade at the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
"I see it as a sort of employment center," the mayor said. Others see it as a 
plan to separate Arab and Jew without cause, or at least without due process. 
</P>
<P>
The Petah Tikva police chief, Gabi Gal, told an Israeli reporter early this 
week: "We are going to act only according to the law, and not according to 
orders from the mayor. . . . We deal with offenses and disturbances of public 
peace, but we are . . . simply not interested in this invention." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mayor Won't Expound 
</P>
<P>
For his part, the mayor would not say what would happen to an Arab found in the 
center of his town, other than to remark that with the establishment of his 
makeshift employment center, "the people of Petah Tikva will know an Arab in 
the street is not looking for a job, he's looking for something else." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor insists that his project is for the benefit of the Arabs in difficult 
times, yet he adds, "In my opinion, every Arab is a security risk." 
</P>
<P>
But another police officer told the Jerusalem Post: "This is not a very clever 
idea to suggest now. We are already working far beyond our means to calm the 
atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Lev describes that atmosphere by telling the story of a teacher at a 
local kindergarten. Arab workers in the town had taken to sitting on a wall in 
the shade of a tree in the schoolyard. The teacher -- alarmed, he said, for the 
safety of her pupils -- chopped down the tree. No more shade for the Arabs, and 
none for her pupils either.

The ceiling of a hangar collapsed last week at an air base at Gwalior, 170 
miles southeast of New Delhi, damaging eight Indian air force Mirage 2000 
combat jets, it was reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the French-built planes, purchased in 1985, were damaged beyond repair 
and six others suffered extensive damage, according to Defense Ministry sources 
quoted by the Indian Express. The cost was estimated at $175 million. Defense 
Ministry spokesman T.G. Nallamuthu confirmed the accident but insisted the 
damage to the jets was minor.

NATO SUMMIT SUCCESSFUL FOR BONN, KOHL SAYS

Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Thursday that this week's NATO summit was a success 
for West Germany despite opposition criticism of a compromise that limits 
negotiations on short-range nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In speeches to the Bundestag, West Germany's Parliament, Kohl and Foreign 
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher tried to put the best face on the compromise, 
in which they dropped demands for early negotiations and accepted strict U.S. 
terms for the talks that rule out banning the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Genscher, a staunch advocate of nuclear disarmament, went as far as to say that 
nuclear weapons are indispensable at this point. 
</P>
<P>
"In Brussels, the federal government has achieved the central goals of German 
foreign and security policy in the agreement with its partners," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing the language of the NATO compromise, Genscher added, "These nuclear 
weapons, as far as we can foresee, are indispensable, in order to permit the 
deterrence of war." 
</P>
<P>
Kohl told the Bundestag that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in 
Brussels and President Bush's visit to West Germany were each "a great 
success." 
</P>
<P>
"A success for the North Atlantic Treaty, for German-American friendship and 
not least of all for our country," Kohl said. 
</P>
<P>
NATO members agreed Tuesday to a final communique that included a new U.S. 
proposal to limit conventional forces and a compromise that provides for 
negotiations for a partial reduction of short-range nuclear forces after the 
first negotiated cuts in conventional forces are implemented. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader Hans Jochen Vogel praised the Bush conventional disarmament 
initiative, but he sharply criticized the government for supporting the nuclear 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"You can say whatever you want -- this is not the big breakthrough in the field 
of short-range missiles," said Vogel, who heads the Social Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel also criticized the government for agreeing to a "partial" rather than 
total elimination of short-range missiles.

UNO NAMED HEAD OF JAPANESE PARTY AS REBELLION FAILS

The ruling Liberal Democratic Party overcame an attempted uprising by young 
rebels today and chose Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno, 66, as its new party 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Parliament is to elect him as prime minister this afternoon after Noboru 
Takeshita officially submits his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Uno pledged to carry out political reform, declared he would resign from the 
party faction formerly headed by scandal-tainted ex-Prime Minister Yasuhiro 
Nakasone and said he wanted to resolve trade frictions with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Allies Trust Each Other' 
</P>
<P>
In a news conference after the caucus, Uno said he told three U.S. Cabinet 
secretaries that "Japan and the United States are allies. Allies trust each 
other in all matters. That is what an alliance is. . . . Raising a club to 
conduct negotiations is simply not permissible." 
</P>
<P>
Uno said he made the complaints about Japan being branded "an unfair trading 
nation" when he met the U.S. officials in Paris earlier this week at a meeting 
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, where he learned 
that party leaders had chosen him to succeed Takeshita. 
</P>
<P>
The change of the guard -- precipitated by an 11-month-long series of 
revelations of a $7.7-million influence-buying scandal -- was marred by six 
objections from the floor of a party caucus meeting. Each protested the party's 
refusal to permit a formal vote. 
</P>
<P>
The young rebels Thursday tried to field Ganri Yamashita, 68, a former Defense 
Agency director, as a rival to Uno, but the party leaders refused to accept his 
candidacy. Rules for elections are spelled out for party conventions, but no 
provisions exist for a vote between rivals in a caucus. 
</P>
<P>
One of the rebels, Katsuhiko Shirakawa, condemned the refusal to allow an 
election as a rejection of democracy's most basic principle. 
</P>
<P>
"Could such a thing happen in Japan?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Hideo Usui lambasted what he called the party's "incomprehensible method of 
operations." 
</P>
<P>
"If there is no rule to permit a vote at a party caucus, one should be 
created," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
Kuro Matsuda criticized the absence of any policy considerations in choosing 
Uno. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't heard a thing about what policies Uno will follow as prime minister. 
I have never heard Uno say a word about political reform," he told the 
gathering, which was televised nationally. 
</P>
<P>
"You choose a leader by a phone call to Paris, asking him, 'Won't you become 
prime minister?' What the hell is this? The people won't accept it," Matsuda 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
With a Stony Face 
</P>
<P>
During the highly unusual outbursts, which the party leadership permitted in 
place of a vote, Takeshita sat on stage with a stony face, while other party 
leaders stared at the ceiling or looked down at documents on their laps. Uno 
sat in the audience, expressionless. 
</P>
<P>
Ryutaro Hashimoto, deputy secretary general, reminded the rebels that he had 
conducted a series of meetings to which all party members of Parliament had 
been invited and that two-thirds of them had favored choosing a new leader 
through discussions, without an election. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of the 341 party members of Parliament present showed their 
approval for Uno by standing. 
</P>
<P>
The uprising, however, ensured the destruction of party unity, which had been a 
hallmark of Takeshita's 19 months in office. It also set the stage for demands 
for Uno's resignation should he fail to lead the party to victory in a crucial 
upper house election July 23. 
</P>
<P>
Criticism of Takeshita's virtually single-handed choice of Uno erupted earlier 
in meetings Thursday of party factions, the cores of power within the ruling 
party. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never heard Uno utter a word about political reform," complained former 
Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki, 78. 
</P>
<P>
After returning from Paris, Uno paid late-night courtesy calls on both Suzuki 
and former Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda, 84, who also had complained bitterly 
about selecting a Nakasone lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
Uno is scheduled to form a new Cabinet tonight after his election in 
Parliament.

The young rebels Thursday decided to field Ganri Yamashita, 68, a former 
Defense Agency director, as a rival to Uno, but the party leaders refused to 
accept his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
Shizuka Kamei, head of the so-called Liberal Progressive Alliance, said the 
rebels asked Yamashita to run to protest Takeshita's "secret-room" selection of 
Uno, a lieutenant of the party faction that was headed until Wednesday by 
former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Influence Scandal Grew 
</P>
<P>
During Nakasone's term as prime minister from 1982 to 1987, a $7.7-million 
influence-buying scandal grew, tainting Nakasone, Takeshita, and all other 
major leaders of the party. 
</P>
<P>
Election rules for party conventions are spelled out, but there are no 
provisions for a vote between rivals in a caucus. 
</P>
<P>
The uprising shattered party unity, which had been a hallmark of Takeshita's 19 
months in office. It also set the stage for demands for Uno's resignation 
should he fail to lead the party to victory in a crucial upper house election 
July 23.

</P>
<P>
"I have never heard Uno utter a word about political reform," complained former 
Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki, 78. 
</P>
<P>
After returning from Paris, where he attended a meeting of the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development, Uno pledged in a news conference that he 
would "carry out faithfully" reform plans already drawn up by the party. He 
also said he would give up his membership in the former Nakasone faction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Made Courtesy Calls 
</P>
<P>
Uno paid late-night courtesy calls on both Suzuki and former Prime Minister 
Takeo Fukuda, 84, who also had complained bitterly about selecting a Nakasone 
lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
Kenzaburo Hara, speaker of the lower house, cleared the way Thursday for Uno to 
be elected prime minister by resigning to accept responsibility for allowing 
the ruling party to ram the fiscal 1989 budget through the lower house in the 
midst of an opposition boycott. Four opposition parties had declared they would 
stay away from the election of a new prime minister in Parliament if Hara 
stayed on.

Uno was to form a new Cabinet after his election in Parliament.

A 'LIBERATED' WRIGHT EXPLAINS WHY HE RESIGNED 
</P>

<P>
House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), emotionally exhausted after months of 
fighting House ethics charges, said Thursday that he feels "liberated" by his 
decision to resign his House seat and acknowledged that his haste to "make my 
mark upon the future" may have contributed to his troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Wright told reporters that he decided to quit when he realized that he would 
not win his sole objective of total exoneration without an "all-out harsh and 
bitter fight on the House floor." 
</P>
<P>
Although Wright said that he has a "great sense of relief" that the battle is 
over, participants in a two-hour interview said that at one point he appeared 
to be on the brink of tears. At another point, he chided reporters for asking 
too many questions about his ethics problems and not enough about his 34-year 
record as a lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Speaker Forced Out 
</P>
<P>
The 66-year-old congressman's dramatic resignation announcement Wednesday made 
him the first Speaker to be forced from office in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
In the wide-ranging interview, a transcript of which was made available by the 
Speaker's office, Wright conceded that House Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley 
(D-Wash.), his apparent successor, has a better temperament for the job than he 
does -- "more cautious, more reasoned, less hurried." 
</P>
<P>
Analyzing his personality, Wright said: "I think I probably was obsessed with 
the notion that I have a limited period of time in which to make my mark upon 
the future, make my contribution and, therefore, I must hurry. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I was too insistent, too competitive, too ambitious to achieve too much 
in too short a period of time. Anyway, I couldn't have changed. I couldn't have 
been any different than I was." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seen as Choice Target 
</P>
<P>
He suggested that partisan animosities inflamed by his approach made him a 
choice target for attack. The Ethics Committee inquiry of his financial 
affairs, initiated at the request of Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), produced 
charges that he improperly accepted $145,000 in gifts and schemed to evade a 
House limit on outside income through bulk sales of a book he wrote. He denied 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that he was late in recognizing the gravity of his situation and 
frustrated in trying to reverse the ethics panel's decision to bring 
accusations against him, the Speaker said he realized last weekend that it was 
time to give up and avert the floor fight over his fate. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided that maybe there is one thing I can change: Maybe I can stop the 
headlong rush of this runaway locomotive to that train wreck that I see coming 
down the track," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strategy Not Viewed as Key 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento), a member of the House Ethics Committee, 
indicated in an interview that Wright may not have been able to save his job, 
regardless of the strategy he employed. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he sensed from the day he first heard the committee special 
counsel's report on the evidence against the Speaker that it could lead to his 
downfall. "Some of the material looked pretty serious to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fazio said that the committee was not swayed by the Wright lawyers' 
counterattacks, and that the Speaker himself did not try to put pressure on the 
Democratic members of the panel. "There was never any overt effort to do that," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites 'Ambiguities' 
</P>
<P>
From his experience in the Wright case, Fazio -- who heads a task force 
drafting new ethics rules -- said that he thinks the House must clear up "the 
ambiguities" in an ethics rule governing gifts to members from persons with an 
interest in legislation. He said that he would prefer a flat prohibition on 
accepting gifts valued at more than a specified amount from anyone other than 
family members. 
</P>
<P>
The committee had alleged that money and benefits Wright and his wife received 
came from a Ft. Worth business partner with a direct interest in congressional 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Fazio denied that the committee interpreted the rules harshly in the Wright 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we were dealing in the context of our times," he said, referring to 
increased sensitivity to conflicts of interest. "I don't mean to say that we 
were pressured by outside events. But we were reading our newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I don't think we tried to hold him to a higher standard." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking over lunch to selected members of the press corps, Wright said that he 
looks forward to time away from the grind of legislation that has preoccupied 
him for the last 12 years since he became House majority leader and later 
Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe there comes a time when one wants a little bit more tranquility and a 
bit more serenity and an opportunity to do things at a pace that one can enjoy 
and savor, rather than hurrying from one thing to another," Wright mused. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said that he had not made any detailed plans -- not even on whether he 
would return to Ft. Worth or remain in the Washington area -- but that he hopes 
to spend time playing tennis and golf and going fishing. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he made his decision to step down while in seclusion last weekend 
with his wife, Betty, in the Blue Ridge Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Although his mind was set, he said, supporters from his home in Ft. Worth kept 
calling to urge him to fight the charges. Explaining why he rejected such 
advice, Wright said: 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't really understand the turmoil that was being created here. They 
didn't realize the deadly distraction that this entire episode had wrought 
within the congressional process. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't understand the wicked forces it had set in motion between 
Democrats and Republicans in the House, the anger and hostilities that it 
generated. And so they weren't really in a position to evaluate what 
responsibility I might have to this institution." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Speaker said, he believes that his departure might have a 
calming effect on the House that will allow it to put aside vituperation and 
return to the nation's business.

House Democrats from California, who had hoped to use their immense legislative 
power this year to address a wide range of state needs, are in disarray after 
the decision by Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Merced) to resign as the Democratic 
leadership's third-ranking member. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho, who has said that he will leave Congress rather than face a lengthy 
ethics inquiry into his acquisition of a $100,000 junk bond, is giving up the 
job of majority whip, which controls the flow and content of key House 
legislation and can have a crucial impact on measures affecting California.

<P>
Members of the state's 27-person Democratic delegation are now trying to 
replace Coelho with one of their own by rallying support for Rep. Henry A. 
Waxman of Los Angeles. But they concede that Waxman, an influential liberal who 
has been active in health care and clean air issues, faces an uphill fight 
because he entered the race later than his three competitors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waxman Has 'a Shot at It' 
</P>
<P>
"That's a handicap, there's no question about it," Waxman said Thursday, 
pausing briefly in his efforts to lobby colleagues. "But I think we have a 
definite shot at it." 
</P>
<P>
Another problem is that Waxman has yet to declare his candidacy formally. He 
said that he is still "checking out the situation to see whether there is 
enough support out there. I'm acting like a candidate, but the decision is not 
final." 
</P>
<P>
As they wait for Waxman's decision, Californians are mourning the loss of a 
leadership post that had come to symbolize their growing power in the House. 
California's Democratic delegation -- the largest from any state -- controls 
key House committees and had planned to flex its growing muscle this year on 
issues ranging from air pollution and rapid transit to AIDS and immigration 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that having (the majority whip job) taken away hurts the 
state," said Rep. Robert T. Matsui of Sacramento. With a Californian in that 
post, he added, "we had direct access to the leadership, and they were 
sensitive to state concerns." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reparations Bill Cited 
</P>
<P>
Matsui said, for example, that having a Californian as whip had been crucial to 
winning House approval of $1.2 billion in reparations for Japanese-Americans -- 
most of them from California -- who were put in detention camps by the federal 
government during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"The leadership made this a priority, but it was a Californian who made the 
difference in actually bringing it to a vote," he said. "That's a clear 
advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Leon E. Panetta of Monterey, who heads the House Budget Committee, said 
that it has helped California to have someone in the leadership "who is 
sensitive to state needs . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
If a non-Californian is elected to the whip post, he added, "California will 
have to fight a lot of these legislative battles with more difficulty. We'll 
have to make the same arguments to people who are friendly but not necessarily 
so sympathetic." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Coelho made an emotional farewell speech at a breakfast meeting 
of the state Democratic delegation. He urged members to work together but did 
not pledge to work for Waxman or any other candidate running for majority whip. 
</P>
<P>
However, most members indicated that they would support Waxman when the House 
Democratic caucus votes in several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disunity Blamed in Burton Defeat 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco said that Californians realize they need to 
act more as a unit to protect the state's interests. She said that the late 
Rep. Phil Burton (D-San Francisco) would have been elected majority leader in 
1976 over Jim Wright of Texas if the delegation had been more unified. Burton 
lost by a thin margin. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all very enthusiastic about this candidacy," said Rep. Don Edwards of 
San Jose, the dean of the Democratic delegation. "We're going to go to work and 
elect Henry Waxman." 
</P>
<P>
In the race for majority whip, the early front-runner is believed to be Rep. 
William H. Gray III (D-Pa.), who heads the House Democratic caucus and is the 
highest ranking black in the House. Also in the competition are Rep. David E. 
Bonior (D-Mich.), the chief deputy whip, and Beryl Anthony Jr. (D-Ark.), who 
heads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hadn't Considered Running 
</P>
<P>
All three began making plans to run for the whip job several weeks ago, 
expecting that Coelho would move up to the No. 2 leadership position in the 
House if a vacancy occurred at the top. However, Waxman did not consider 
entering the race until Coelho's unexpected announcement that he was resigning 
from Congress, potentially leaving California without a voice in the House 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman must now try to win over some members, including Californians, who would 
normally have supported him but had already lined up behind other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"I respect Henry a great deal, but I told Dave (Bonior) that I would be with 
him several days ago," said Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson of Los Angeles. "Right 
now, I'm working to round up support for Bonior." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, House members do not discount Waxman's chances. 
</P>
<P>
"You certainly can't count him out," said Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N. M.), who 
is uncommitted. "Henry is the most formidable organizer in the House. Starting 
late is a factor, but he compensates for that with the most impressive ability 
to line up support for a position that I've seen around here."

COUPLE CHARGED IN BABY'S DEATH FROM DRINKING ACID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SECTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suburban couple were ordered held on $1-million bond each on Thursday after 
they were charged with the murder of the infant son they had once claimed was 
the victim of acid-tainted baby formula. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they would seek the death penalty for Shelia Smith, 26, and 
Ricky Irby Sr., 29, both of North Chicago, Ill., near the Wisconsin border. A 
grand jury indictment charged the pair with forcing their 3-month-old son 
Quentin to swallow sulfuric acid in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The child lost a lung and suffered severe burns on his mouth, throat and 
stomach, but lingered in a hospital in critical condition and tied to a 
breathing device for two years before he died. 
</P>
<P>
The case set off a brief product tampering scare when Smith and Irby told 
police that the youngster had been poisoned after swallowing a prepared formula 
known as Similac with Iron. Irby later filed a negligence suit against Abbott 
Laboratories, the makers of Similac, as well as the grocery store where he 
claimed to have bought the formula. But he dropped the suit without explanation 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prime Suspects 
</P>
<P>
Matthew Chancey, the Lake County prosecutor handling the case, said police 
never really believed Smith and Irby, who were always the prime suspects. But 
Chancey said the original investigation was thwarted when a state laboratory 
accidentally destroyed crucial evidence, including cans of formula, a baby 
bottle, and a nipple. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was reopened after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled last November 
in an Arizona case that experts could be allowed to testify about key evidence 
in a criminal prosecution even if the evidence itself had been accidentally 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
Chancey said he doubted Irby filed the legal action against Abbott to throw 
investigators off the trail, but he refused to speculate on why the couple 
allegedly tried to kill their son or whether they hoped to profit from his 
death with a product liability suit. 
</P>
<P>
The poisoning took place less than two years after a bizarre, still unsolved 
series of incidents in which several Chicago area residents died from taking 
cyanide-laced Tylenol tablets they had purchased at local drugstores. That 
scare prompted a massive, nationwide recall of Tylenol. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Samples Tested 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Irby youth, however, investigators quickly tested samples of 
Similac and ruled out the need for a recall. "It became fairly obvious early on 
that there wasn't anything wrong with the formula," said Chancey. " . . . And 
in order for it to have been tampered with at the store it would have been 
detectable. The only openings in the can were where they were opened after 
purchase to pour the contents into a bottle." 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Babington, a spokesperson for Abbott, which is also headquartered in 
North Chicago, said the company had received no other complaints and determined 
through its own internal checks that nothing was wrong with the formula. "We 
don't really have a statement," Babington said after the indictments were 
handed down. "Its a real sad situation." 
</P>
<P>
Lake County Associate Judge Harry Hartel set an arraignment in the case for 
June 7. Both Smith and Irby were being held in the county jail. 
</P>
<P>
Chancey said the couple, who had never been married, were no longer living 
together at the time of their arrest on Wednesday. He said they also had 
another son, 8-year-old Ricky Irby Jr., who was believed to be living with his 
maternal grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the poisoning, prosecutors charged both Smith and Irby with child 
abuse and a juvenile court judge awarded temporary custody of both Quentin and 
Ricky Jr. to a state child care agency. However, the juvenile case was dropped 
after the evidence in the criminal investigation was lost and the parents 
regained custody.

WILSON PILES UP FUNDS FOR GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH LOVE, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whatever problems Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson may face in seeking the 
California governorship next year, money will apparently not be one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson raised $1.2 million at one dinner Wednesday night in Los Angeles, an 
event that looked more like a presidential fund-raiser in its size and cash 
take. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson advisers say he will have more than $2 million on hand when the current 
fund-raising cycle ends this month, and he can save it all to go after the 
Democrats since he has no primary opposition next year. 
</P>
<P>
Honing his "message" for the 1990 campaign, though, could prove tougher for 
Wilson than the fund raising, as his remarks Wednesday showed. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the 1,300 people attending the sold-out event at the Century Plaza, 
Wilson tried to position himself as a crime fighter in the mold of Gov. George 
Deukmejian while emphasizing his own interest in so-called quality-of-life 
issues -- better child care and programs to help ghetto youths resist drugs and 
gangs. 
</P>
<P>
It was a speech with a split personality. 
</P>
<P>
For half of it, Wilson talked tough: 
</P>
<P>
"The law of California must be changed to favor the citizen and not the 
criminal," he shouted. "I swear to you I will not have the people of California 
under siege by thugs or rapists or sellers of crack cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson urged the passage of a ballot initiative next June that would speed up 
criminal trials and impose stiffer penalties for crimes involving torture. 
</P>
<P>
And then he turned gentle, lowering his voice: 
</P>
<P>
"But how much better to prevent crimes than to punish them. How much better to 
provide adequate prenatal care. . . . How much better to prevent learning 
disorders than to try to correct them. . . . And in the name of God and simple 
decency, how infinitely better to prevent child abuse than to suffer certain 
creation of the next generation of child abusers and residents of Death Row." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's advisers say privately that while they think voters are still 
preoccupied with crime in California, Wilson believes he will give up valuable 
ground to the Democrats in next year's gubernatorial campaign if he does not 
address ways to improve the quality of life in the state.

2 QUAKES SHAKE INLAND EMPIRE

<P>
Two mild earthquakes gave Inland Empire residents a slight shake Thursday 
morning, but there were no reports of damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The first temblor, measuring 3.5 in magnitude, struck at 2:33 a.m. and was 
centered three miles south of Redlands, said Paul Daily, a spokesman for the 
California Institute of Technology's seismological laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
About five hours later, a 3.0-magnitude quake rattled an area 10 miles north of 
San Bernardino, Daily said. The epicenters of the two quakes are about 25 miles 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
The temblors were felt in several cities in Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties. Authorities said they fielded dozens of phone calls from residents 
jostled in their sleep but no reports of damages. 
</P>
<P>
Caltech seismologist Steve Bryant said that the earthquakes appear to be 
unrelated but that scientists may never know much about their origin. 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots and lots of faults out that way, and they are fairly close 
together and run every which way," Bryant said. "So it would take a lot of work 
to determine precisely where these occurred."

New South Wales last July became the only state to ban exports after at least

SECOND WIND IN CHICAGO?; 
</P>
<P>
PISTONS HAVE TAKEN THE AIR OUT OF JORDAN AND THE BULLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chicago Bulls are as exhausted as Sparky Anderson. They are plumb tuckered 
out. They have labored through 16 playoff games to the Detroit Pistons' 13, and 
poor Michael Jordan's tongue is just about touching the stadium floor, because 
he does not have the same reinforcements the Piston starters do. (Who does?) 
</P>
<P>
Jordan is working 43.4 minutes a game in the Eastern Conference finals, Scottie 
Pippen 39.8 on a bad foot. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody from the Pistons is averaging 40 minutes, and only one guy, Isiah 
Thomas, is playing more than 35. Even Thomas got to sit back like Tom Sawyer 
and let somebody else -- Vinnie Johnson -- handle his chores during the last 11 
minutes of Detroit's 94-85 success in Game 5 Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit's players are pampered. They even get to make trips on their own team 
airplane, Roundball One. They take their time, ride in style, leave when they 
want. There are no such friendly skies for Air Jordan. He's lucky Detroit and 
Chicago are only an hour apart. 
</P>
<P>
Yep, the Bulls are weary, punchy, too pooped to pop. They got off only 59 shots 
in Game 5, an all-time National Basketball Assn. playoff low. The Pistons are 
eager, energetic matadors, poised with their swords. They can do away with the 
Bulls tonight, clinching a rematch with the Lakers, when Game 6 tips off at 
Chicago Stadium at 6 p.m., Pacific time. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fresh as daisies," Detroit forward John Salley said. "Fresher." 
</P>
<P>
Not a soul on the Pistons' starting front line is averaging even 30 minutes a 
night. Rick Mahorn, in fact, is averaging 17. At this rate, Chuck Daly's 
regulars are going to be as well-rested for the NBA Finals as Pat Riley's. The 
Pistons don't need a bench. They need a hammock. Some of them sit around on the 
sidelines shooting the breeze like those guys in the TV commercials for Dockers 
pants. Mahorn, a starter, talks more than plays. 
</P>
<P>
In the Windy City, meanwhile, what the Bulls are counting on, for tonight at 
least, is a familiar environment and a rush of old-fashioned second wind. That 
might get them through the night. 
</P>
<P>
Another loud, rowdy, capacity crowd will occupy Chicago Stadium -- some creep 
threw a rum bottle onto the court during Game 4, and Detroit's traveling fans 
have been describing other horrifying treatment by Chicago's customers -- and 
although Coach Doug Collins does not advocate disorder, he is looking for a 
certain kind of lift. 
</P>
<P>
"What we need is for our home crowd to electrocute us," Collins malapropped. 
</P>
<P>
Electrify, Doug. Electrify. 
</P>
<P>
His cattle are tired, and need prodding. Those down-to-the-last-minute 
struggles against Cleveland and New York were exhilarating, but what the Bulls 
could really use is a blowout, because they sure aren't going to get a rainout. 
With an easy win, they could rest Jordan a little; maybe Pippen, too. Only, who 
blows out Detroit? The Pistons have kept opponents under100 points in 14 
straight games. 
</P>
<P>
None of the five series games played so far has been settled until the final 
minutes. Chicago's 24-point edge in Game 1 quickly disintegrated. It might even 
have helped the Bulls had the Pistons beaten their brains out Wednesday, but 
even on Jordan's 18-point night, the Bulls led at halftime and remained within 
five points with three minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave Michael a two-minute breather early in the game, and was going to give 
him another rest toward the end of the third quarter," Collins said. "But 
that's when he made his only little spurt of the night. You can't take out 
Michael Jordan just when he starts to heat up." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored 10 of Chicago's last 12 points in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth period, he scored one. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not tired. I am not tired. Read my lips," Jordan swore, smiling wanly. "I 
may look tired, but I promise you, I am not. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't stop shooting because I couldn't raise my arms. I stopped shooting 
because I couldn't get a clean shot off with three Detroit guys in my face." 
</P>
<P>
In a league that prohibits anything but man-to-man combat and punishes teams 
with technical fouls for using "illegal" defenses, Jordan finds himself drawing 
Pistons the way a porch light draws moths. About the only break he has had is 
that Joe Dumars, not Dennis Rodman, guards him most of the time. Rodman is two 
inches taller than Jordan and just as fast, if not faster. He is giving Jordan 
fits, as well as killing Chicago on the boards, in his nightly 25-minute 
stints. 
</P>
<P>
"You can call me Dennis the Rebounding Menace," said Rodman, whose confidence 
and ego are growing daily. 
</P>
<P>
Electing not to break up an act that has won 73 of 94 games, Daly continues to 
start a front line of Bill Laimbeer, Mark Aguirre and Rick Mahorn, and finish 
with a front line of James Edwards, Salley and Rodman. Even if Rodman started, 
he wouldn't guard Jordan, because Dumars doesn't match up with the taller 
Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
Vinnie Johnson, no taller but more muscular than Dumars, can handle that 
assignment when he enters the game at guard. That frees Rodman to tag after 
Jordan like a dog on a mailman. 
</P>
<P>
"Rodman, he's something," said Aguirre, who was so impressed with his teammate 
during Game 4 at Chicago that he told Daly to go with Rodman at the start of 
the second half rather than with himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I've ever seen a guy who goes after his man so -- what? -- so 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
Relentlessly? 
</P>
<P>
"There's a good word for it," Aguirre said. "Rodman never lets up, never lets 
you out of his sight. He stays with you like he's handcuffed to you." 
</P>
<P>
Also, with his reputation as a defensive expert expanding, Rodman no longer is 
a mere substitute who cannot convince referees of his abilities. Like a 
league-leading hitter who gets the outside corner, Rodman often gets the 
benefit of charging calls when he goes recoiling after being struck by an 
opponent's elbow. Funny how those elbows can knock a healthy, 6-foot 8-inch man 
five feet backward or even off his feet, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls are too tired to argue. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we're dragging," Collins said. "No matter what great shape these guys 
are in, they've been going at it through preseason camp, exhibition games, 82 
regular-schedule games and 16 grueling playoff games, with practices in 
between. Not one of them is complaining about it. It's just a fact of life. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you this, though: If we get a chance to go play the Lakers, we're 
not going to call them up and say, 'Hey, guys, we're too tired to come play. 
Let's do it in July.' We'll be there." 
</P>
<P>
First things first. 
</P>
<P>
Playoff Notes 
</P>
<P>
Piston assistant coach Brendan Malone, a native New Yorker, is a candidate for 
the Knicks' job vacated by Rick Pitino. "It would be the stuff that dreams are 
made of," Malone said. "It'd be the perfect script for a B movie." . . . Three 
of Chuck Daly's former assistants hold head coaching jobs: Dick Harter at 
Charlotte, Ron Rothstein at Miami and Dick Versace at Indiana. . . . When a 
reporter pressed Doug Collins to be critical of Michael Jordan for taking only 
eight shots in Game 5, the Chicago coach broke up laughing and said: "You 
expect me to do that? This guy must think I just fell off the back of a turnip 
truck."

JIM MURRAY: THE TOUGHEST THING MANLEY HAS EVER DONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few days ago, in front of a Senate committee hearing, Dexter Manley, the 
mastodonic end for the Washington Redskins, did something a lot of us didn't 
think he could -- cry. 
</P>
<P>
Now, you don't ordinarily think of Dexter Manley as a sensitive, feeling 
person. He ordinarily comes into focus waving a quarterback -- or a 
quarterback's arm or leg -- over his head and gloating. He snarls a lot. He's a 
major league intimidator. 
</P>
<P>
What brought tears to Dexter Manley's eyes was that he was a 6-foot-3, 
260-pound magnificent physical specimen, idol of millions, making a 
half-million a year, but he was 30 years old and couldn't do something 
5-year-olds can do -- read. 
</P>
<P>
Shocking? Why? Happens all the time. 
</P>
<P>
Dexter Manley is a rough-tough, take-no-prisoners type of ballplayer. But I 
have a feeling the thing that took the most guts in his lifetime was to get up 
in front of Congress and admit he couldn't read or write. He deserves more 
applause for that than for any quarterback sack he ever made. 
</P>
<P>
None of us likes to cop out to our private weaknesses. And Dexter's had to be 
more embarrassing than most. Picking John Elway out of a crowd has to be a 
piece of cake compared to telling people he was illiterate. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, you have to wonder why it is that a product of the American 
educational system for 16 years cannot read or write. You have to imagine the 
embarrassment of Oklahoma State University, an institute of higher learning 
that Dexter Manley attended for four years. What is it, a college or a farm 
club? 
</P>
<P>
You want to know what Dexter Manley learned in school? The Redskin press guide 
goes over the highlights of his college career: "Dexter totaled 39 sacks over 
his last three seasons at Oklahoma State. Over his four-year career, he had 198 
tackles, caused 10 fumbles and knocked down five passes. His best game was a 
17-tackle performance against Kansas" 
</P>
<P>
How's that for academic achievement? 
</P>
<P>
How does a guy stay in college four years without being able to read or write? 
How does he get in? 
</P>
<P>
The answer to that last is easy: The athletic departments of major colleges, it 
sometimes seems, would let in the Piltdown Man if he could take the team to the 
Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
What they do is rationalize their defections from academic morality. The 
rationalizations are ingenious. They are not lowering standards, they are 
simply trying to upgrade individuals. 
</P>
<P>
How you upgrade somebody by turning him out illiterate is something for the 
department of athletics to answer, but they make a brave if ignoble attempt. 
Below is what they tell you. In parentheses is reality. 
</P>
<P>
"He says he has a learning disability." (Yeah, in his case, it's called 
stupidity.) 
</P>
<P>
"He came from a disadvantaged background." (So did Abraham Lincoln.) 
</P>
<P>
"He never knew his father." (Some guys get all the breaks.) 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't make school interesting for him." (Aw-w-w-w!) 
</P>
<P>
"The system failed him." (Yeah. It's our fault he's not a rocket scientist or a 
brain surgeon.) 
</P>
<P>
"He just couldn't deal with studies." (I'll bet if you locked him in a room 
with girls for 16 years, he'd soon figure out what to do.) 
</P>
<P>
"He failed math and he had nowhere to turn but to the streets." (Einstein 
failed math, too. But he didn't turn to crime.) 
</P>
<P>
"We should have gotten him tutorial help. (And somebody to peel his bananas.) 
</P>
<P>
"Teachers aren't what they used to be." (Neither are pupils.) 
</P>
<P>
Dexter Manley has enrolled in a remedial program to correct his reading 
deficiencies. This is laudable. 
</P>
<P>
The great American pastime is finding someone or something to blame when things 
go wrong. When someone can spend 16 years in the educational process and come 
out functionally illiterate, there's plenty of blame to go round. Some of it is 
the system's. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of it is Manley's, though, too. Spending 16 years in or around classrooms 
and coming out unable to read or write is like spending your life in a 
cornfield -- and starving to death.

THE CLASS OF '89: THE EXIT OF SCHMIDT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GERGEN, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That Mike Schmidt chose retirement before someone in higher authority suggested 
another career warrants no award. There will be no asterisk placed alongside 
his name in "The Baseball Encyclopedia," no special commendation on his 
eventual plaque in the Hall of Fame. Perhaps the way he chose to leave the game 
would have received less attention, at least in New York, if it hadn't occurred 
on the same day in which the Yankees asked Tommy John to conduct his business 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is this an indictment of John, who declined the offer of Dallas Green and 
club management to announce his farewell as an active player on Memorial Day at 
Yankee Stadium. After all, so many baseball people have been wrong so often 
concerning John's ability to pitch in the major leagues that it's 
understandable if he is among the last to be convinced the end is at hand. 
Still, despite his remarkable history and unquenchable spirit, it bears noting 
that John's overall record since 1980 is 74-80 with an earned run average of 
4.13. At 46, the man's age wasn't the only number held against him. 
</P>
<P>
But John has decided to keep throwing and hope that another team will be 
interested in his services before the summer runs its course. It's his life and 
he certainly has the right to select his personal conditions of surrender. 
Whether the player is diminished by holding on so long is in the eye of the 
beholder. 
</P>
<P>
As for Schmidt, he added to his stature by accepting the inevitable. He did not 
orchestrate a heroic conclusion in the manner of Ted Williams homering in his 
final at-bat. He did not leave with a championship, as did Joe DiMaggio. But he 
departed with his dignity intact. When DiMaggio turned down a new contract from 
the Yankees after the 1951 season, he told a friend, "I don't want (the fans) 
to remember me struggling." Schmidt spoke of failing to live up to his own 
exacting standards. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, the announcement on Monday demonstrated Schmidt's strong 
sense of self. While others may recall his home runs or outstanding plays at 
third base, I will choose to remember his perspective. 
</P>
<P>
He was a rookie experiencing his share of tribulation when I made his 
acquaintance in 1973. The circumstances were extraordinary. Eight days earlier, 
in Philadelphia, he had crashed a grand slam against the Mets' Harry Parker to 
stake the Phillies to a 6-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
On June 27, at Shea Stadium, the scenario unfolded again. In fact, the Mets 
contributed to it. Yogi Berra, the manager, ordered an intentional walk to 
Tommy Hutton, thereby loading the bases for Schmidt a second time. The pitcher 
was Phil Hennigan, in relief of Parker. 
</P>
<P>
There was no way for lightning to strike twice, at least not according to 
Berra. "You'd think the law of averages would catch up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not that night. Schmidt, whose batting average was lingering below .200, a man 
whose strikeout ratio was alarming, responded with another grand slam in a 7-1 
triumph. He thus tied a National League record of two slams in a month. That he 
victimized the same team was an unprecedented feat. 
</P>
<P>
I expected the man to feel slighted, perhaps insulted, by Berra's strategy. He 
was neither. "I don't care who's up there, who's on deck," he said. "You've got 
to set up the double play. That's percentage baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Then he offered a refreshing confession of his own inadequacy. "The book on 
me," Schmidt said with a smile, "is that I can't hit breaking balls with an 
ironing board." 
</P>
<P>
And so he couldn't that first season. He finished the year with a .196 batting 
average and 136 strikeouts. But he also managed 18 home runs, including those 
two grand slams that delayed the Mets' division-clinching until the day after 
the end of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
He overcame his deficiencies as a hitter soon enough. In his second season, he 
led the National League in homers with 36, drove in 116 runs and earned his 
first appearance in the All-Star Game. Schmidt had taken his first steps toward 
Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
It was no coincidence that the greatest season of his life and the season of 
the Phillies' lone world championship were one and the same. In the first year 
of this decade, he won the first of three Most Valuable Player Awards with an 
output of 48 homers and 121 RBI. He topped that performance by hitting .381 
with two homers and seven RBI in the World Series victory over Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, however, it was something he said rather than what he did that 
remains with me. That particular Series ended on a Tuesday night at Veterans 
Stadium in an atmosphere I found disturbing. Police dogs lined the field from 
the dug-outs to the foul poles as the Royals batted in the ninth. Cops on 
horseback filled the warning track as soon as Tug McGraw struck out an anxious 
Willie Wilson. Although the calendar said 1980, it felt more like 1984 in Frank 
Rizzo's Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
I wondered what the winning players thought of the show of force. The '80 
Phillies were a fractious team. They bridled at criticism from the Manager, 
Dallas Green, the media and the fans. Their star pitcher, Steve Carlton, had 
stopped interacting with the media a long time ago, and on this auspicious 
occasion, he retreated to the sanctity of the trainer's room. In relative 
privacy, he opened a magnum of his own premier champagne and invited selected 
members of the team to partake with him. Very strange. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Phillies joked about the police presence in the stadium. Others 
couldn't be bothered with addressing the question, preferring to spray each 
other as required by the rules of baseball celebrations. Only Schmidt offered a 
serious reply. 
</P>
<P>
It hadn't even occurred to me that he grew up in Ohio, that he attended Ohio 
University at the height of the Vietnam protest. It must have had an impact. 
Looking around at the assembled authority figures that night, Schmidt said, "I 
felt like I was at Kent State, 1970." 
</P>
<P>
I looked up the quote Wednesday just to double-check its accuracy. Sure enough, 
there it was on a page of a notebook that had been dampened by champagne. 
Schmidt gained an additional fan that night, one who was not surprised by the 
grace with which the man exited.

Doug Williams, Washington Redskins quarterback, was accused in court documents 
in Baton Rouge, La., of using a financial dispute with his wife to try to get 
the upper hand in their legal fight over separation. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Williams, 27, filed the papers in response to an arrest warrant in which 
Williams accused her of illegally cashing a $75,000 check for advertisements 
Williams did in Ebony magazine. 
</P>
<P>
She claims she was authorized to cash the check since she is an officer in a 
corporation the two set up to create endorsements and that she has signed 
checks often in the past.

RILEY WANTS A PISTON REMATCH RATHER THAN 'EASY WAY OUT'

The Lakers' opponent for the National Basketball Assn. championship series has 
yet to be determined, but the Lakers are practicing at Westmont College as if a 
rematch with the Detroit Pistons is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Pat Riley, in fact, said Thursday that he will be disappointed if the 
Pistons do not beat the Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference finals because 
he wants the Lakers to prove that last season's seven-game series victory was 
no fluke. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got five days to develop a mind-set," Riley said. "(The Pistons) are so 
committed to the revenge thing. Their mission is to beat us. They are 
challenging us more than anyone's ever challenged us. We've got to want them 
more than they want you. 
</P>
<P>
"If we go in there and say we just want to 'three-peat' and win one for Cap 
(Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), then you don't have the right competitive attitude. 
You've got to stimulate (the players') minds more, bring back all the little 
things that were said last year, bring back some videotapes. You got to bring 
it all back, otherwise they forget. Then, after the first or second game, 
they'll realize what it was like." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers would have the home-court advantage against the Bulls, but Riley 
wants a higher degree of difficulty. "It would be the easy way out to play 
Chicago, because we'd have the home court," he said. "This is the pursuit of 
pleasure versus the avoidance of pain. People have a tendency to avoid (the 
difficult) and move to what's easier. We want to move toward that which is 
difficult because we have a point to prove."

YUGOSLAV MONICA SELES, 15, ENJOYING LIFE IN THE PINK

<P>
Monica Seles is a 15-year-old, left-handed Yugoslav who lives in Florida, 
paints her fingernails fire-engine red, talks like a Valley Girl and signs 
autographs with her new, lucky pen. 
</P>
<P>
At the French Open, where Seles is all the rage, she has been signing lots of 
autographs. 
</P>
<P>
Clad in her usual pink shirt and pink skirt, Seles won her second-round match 
Thursday, beating Stacey Martin of Washington, 6-0, 6-2, then signed her name 
to oblige as many fans as she could on the way to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"I am almost exhausted from all the happiness," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Seles signed autographs with a pink pen that had on one end a fuzzy, pink ball 
with a kitten's face drawn on it. She signed. She smiled. Then she laughed. 
</P>
<P>
Someone has suggested that Seles has the determination of Bjorn Borg, the grunt 
of Jimmy Connors and the laugh of Woody Woodpecker. It's too early for only the 
first comparison to be tested completely. 
</P>
<P>
Seles hits the ball two-handed from both sides and grunts audibly every time. 
And her laugh? It sounds like something between Woody Woodpecker and a car 
trying to start. 
</P>
<P>
But however she sounds, it's how Seles plays that is drawing attention in 
women's tennis, which is in need of new, young stars. Although Seles is playing 
in only her fifth tournament as a professional, she is already No. 22 in the 
world. Last month in Houston, she defeated Chris Evert to win her first 
Virginia Slims title. 
</P>
<P>
Seles has not lost a match this year, but she has played only 10. 
</P>
<P>
Seles got stomach cramps and defaulted to Zina Garrison before their semifinal 
match in the Virginia Slims of Washington, but that is not counted in won-lost 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
A two-time world junior champion, Seles was chosen sportswoman of the year in 
Yugoslavia when she was 12. 
</P>
<P>
"I got so much press attention, I couldn't believe it myself," Seles said. 
</P>
<P>
When she was winning the Orange Bowl junior tournament in 1985, Seles met Nick 
Bollitieri, who persuaded her to join his tennis academy in Florida. She 
agreed, and her parents later left Yugoslavia and joined her there. 
</P>
<P>
Seles has grown four inches -- to 5-foot-8 -- in the last year, and her 
notoriety is experiencing a similar growth spurt. Garrison, Seles' next 
opponent, may stunt that growth, but if Seles does get past the fourth-seeded 
player, she will be on a path to meet Steffi Graf in the semifinals. THOMAS

CHO'S 2-OUT SINGLE IN EIGHTH GIVES FRANKLIN A 3-2 WIN

Hyung Cho's run-scoring single with two out in the bottom of the eighth inning 
gave Franklin a 3-2 victory over Bell in the City 3-A baseball championship 
game Thursday night at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first City baseball title for Franklin (18-4), which had tied the 
score, 2-2, with two unearned runs in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Errors also played a part in Franklin's run in the eighth, when Bell's second 
baseman, Adolfo Estrada, muffed Andy Aguilar's grounder with two out. Aguilar 
advanced to second on the play as Estrada's throw went past Carlos Rodriguez at 
first base. 
</P>
<P>
Cho, Franklin's designated hitter who was hitless in three previous at-bats, 
then lined the game-winning hit over Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for a fastball down and in and that is what I got," Cho said. "I 
was frustrated after blowing the first (three) opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Bell (30-6) was in control early, scoring one run in the second inning and 
another in the fourth. The first run scored when Noe Landeros singled in 
Rodriguez from second base. 
</P>
<P>
Bell's second run came with the help of two errors. Javier Lopez stole second 
after reaching base on an error by shortstop Chad Infranca. Lopez then came all 
the way home when Estrada grounded to the shortstop, whose throw got by 
Aguilar, the first baseman. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bell starting pitcher John Rogers gave up only one hit through the 
first five innings and faced only one jam, a two-out bases-loaded situation in 
the third. 
</P>
<P>
But in the sixth, Franklin starting pitcher Sergio Galvez reached base on an 
error by shortstop Rene Lopez and moved to second on Infranca's single. Galvez 
scored one out later when he stole third and came home as the throw got by the 
third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar followed with a single to right, scoring Infranca with Franklin's 
second run. 
</P>
<P>
Galvez gave up only two hits and one earned run in six innings. Phil Arreola, 
who relieved Galvez in the seventh, was credited with the victory. He struck 
out four and gave up only one hit. 
</P>
<P>
"The first four innings were very sloppy for us," Franklin Coach Rick Campbell 
said. "Galvez has carried us many times all year, and he came through today." 
</P>
<P>
Bell, which was playing in its third consecutive City championship game, ended 
the season 30-6.

STATE PREP TRACK AND FIELD MEET; 
</P>
<P>
CONWAY MAKES THE HAWTHORNE BOYS SOLID FAVORITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The top high school track and field athletes in California will gather today 
for the opening of the State meet at Cerritos College at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The meet ends Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne, the Southern Section 4-A Division champion, is a strong favorite to 
win the boys' team title, thanks largely to senior sprinter Curtis Conway. 
</P>
<P>
Conway, who has yet to win an individual state title, is the leading qualifier 
in the 100 and 200 meters, with winning times in last week's Masters meet of 
10.66 seconds and 21.04, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Conway will also anchor the Cougars' 400-meter relay team, which has set state 
records in each of its last two outings. In winning the Masters meet last week, 
the Cougars ran 40.25 seconds, the fourth-fastest time in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Beno Bryant of L.A. Dorsey is favored to win the 400 meters, after winning the 
City Section title last week in a city record of 46.36. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant will also anchor the Dons' relay teams, which will challenge Hawthorne 
in both the 400- and 1,600-meter events. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle distances, Coley Candaele of Carpinteria looms as the runner to 
beat, after being a double winner in the Masters meet. He won the 1,600 meters 
in 4 minutes 10.54 seconds and the 800 meters in 1:51.58. 
</P>
<P>
There is no strong favorite in the girls' competition. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena Muir, the 4-A Division champion, is expected to be in the hunt for the 
team title, based on its strong group of sprinters, headed by junior Inger 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
However, Muir Coach Jim Brownfield says that it is too close to call. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be one exciting meet," he said. "There is just no way to 
figure out this meet." 
</P>
<P>
Angela Burnham of Oxnard Rio Mesa, the defending state champion in the 100 and 
200, is expected to double once again, despite a strong challenge from Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham won the 100 and 200 at the Masters, with the fastest times in the 
nation this season of 11.52 and 23.49, respectively.

JUDGE CLEARS WAY FOR BUILDING OF TOXIC WASTE INCINERATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge Thursday ordered state air quality officials 
to issue construction permits for California's first large-scale commercial 
hazardous waste incinerator without requiring a full environmental impact 
report. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Kurt J. Lewin also ordered the incinerator's developer, California 
Thermal Treatment Services, to include state-of-the-art antipollution equipment 
in the controversial toxic waste burner. 
</P>
<P>
That provision will add about $6 million to the $29 million cost of the project 
and could delay it by more than a year, according to Stephen Grossman, 
president of the builder's parent firm, Security Environmental Systems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
But "naturally I'm elated," Grossman said of the judge's order rejecting the 
need for a full environmental study. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, which came after a monthlong deliberation by the judge, was the 
latest in a series of setbacks for local community leaders and lawmakers, who 
want the company to complete an exhaustive study before it builds the plant in 
the center of Vernon, an industrial city 3 1/2 miles southeast of downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The critics directed much of their anger at first at the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District, which issued 21 permits for the project without 
requiring a full environmental report. But the AQMD reversed itself last 
December, saying it would not extend the permits without the study. 
</P>
<P>
Security Environmental Systems Inc. then filed suit to force the agency to 
stick to its earlier ruling. 
</P>
<P>
In a hearing last month, AQMD attorneys urged Lewin to reject the legal 
challenge on the grounds that additional information had been uncovered 
indicating that the proposed incinerator would emit more pollution than 
previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
But Lewin said that the AQMD had not sufficiently proven its case, and that no 
new information was "readily available." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Needs of Society 
</P>
<P>
"It should be recognized that society is fast running out of alternatives for 
the disposal of the ever-increasing toxic substances that will be accepted by 
the facility," the judge wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"Construction of such facilities cannot be postponed indefinitely, nor can they 
be continuously relocated to someone else's bailiwick." 
</P>
<P>
The incinerator, the first of its type planned for a major metropolitan area, 
would burn about 22,500 tons of hazardous materials yearly, including solvents, 
oils and infectious debris from hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The incinerator has received final approval from both the state Department of 
Health Services and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, neither of which 
has required an environmental report. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD spokesman Tom Eichorn said he was disappointed in Lewin's ruling, but that 
he did not know what steps the agency will take next.

BAT MAN; 
</P>
<P>
WINGED CREATURES BEING EVICTED FROM THEIR DOWNTOWN HAVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

L. J. (Holly) Hollingworth's pest control company has tackled opossums, skunks, 
raccoons, coyotes and even rattlesnakes in rural hills and valleys throughout 
Southern California. But now he faces an unusual urban challenge -- removing 
1,500 bats from the cracks of an old, 11-story insurance building in downtown 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The 280 people who work in the Fremont Insurance Building in the 1700 block of 
West 8th Street hope he succeeds. Three or four Mexican freetail bats have been 
cruising the halls each day since the building's bat population exploded for 
unknown reasons in March. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't outthink the little suckers because they don't think," said 
Hollingworth, who thinks it will take a month to free the building of bats. 
"Bats are only interested in three things -- food, water and a place to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
Hollingworth has been taping plastic mesh over cracks and damaged window frames 
used by the bats to enter the building and find sleeping quarters in the spaces 
between the red-brick facade and concrete masonry. At the bottom of the mesh is 
a small hole. 
</P>
<P>
"The animal comes out at dusk to feed on insects and encounters the net, but 
his sonar tells him there is a way out," said Hollingworth, who sports gray, 
handlebar mustache and long sideburns. "When he comes home, he can't get in." 
</P>
<P>
In this way, the chocolate-brown, mouse-sized insectivores, considered 
beneficial to the environment, are being forced to find new lodgings elsewhere. 
Once they leave, Hollingworth's three-man crew will caulk up the cracks and the 
problem will presumably be solved. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants of the building hope Hollingworth knows what he is doing. 
</P>
<P>
"About six weeks ago," said Howard Heller, senior vice president in charge of 
collections, "I was working late, and I saw one coming straight for me at eye 
level. I hit the deck. We just sat on the floor and watched them zip around." 
</P>
<P>
Wanda Perry, 30, an administrative supervisor on the 10th floor, recalled 
several "unfortunate" encounters. 
</P>
<P>
"I just scream and run to the bathroom," said Perry, whose fear has nothing to 
do with vampires. "I have a phobia of one landing on me and I drop dead." 
</P>
<P>
Janene Torres, 28, a secretary on the same floor, has other reasons for wanting 
the bats to move on. 
</P>
<P>
"They fly fast and go around corners in the hall like they know exactly where 
they're going," Torres said. "We get down on the floor or under a desk to get 
out of their way. We're afraid of them getting in our hair." 
</P>
<P>
Hollingworth pointed out that bats navigate through the air with a natural 
sonar system that all but precludes a collision with human beings. 
</P>
<P>
"People hear the word bat and right away they start thinking of Bela Lugosi," 
Hollingworth said. 
</P>
<P>
It was a growing chorus of complaints about bats hanging from the ceiling and 
sailing through the corridors that prompted building manager Jim Rabb to seek 
help. Also, the odor of bat guano lingers in the lobbies of certain floors. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican freetail bat, Tadarida brasiliensis, gets its name from a 
quarter-inch-long tail that extends beyond the edge of its tail membrane. The 
bat has a wingspan of 8 to 10 inches, flies high and fast, eats moths and other 
insects and usually roosts in caves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Creatures of Habit' 
</P>
<P>
"Bats are creatures of habit and don't deviate in their behavior," said Gordon 
Fries, Hollingworth's partner, who has been working in the pest control 
business for 31 years. "Once you know their biology, you have them down pat and 
can get control of them." 
</P>
<P>
Still, "it's a helluva job," Hollingworth said. "We've got to cover every 
window, and there's over 574 windows on this building." 
</P>
<P>
Hollingworth said it was not all that unusual to find such a large colony in 
the big city. 
</P>
<P>
"Back when Father Junipero Serra walked through here, bats lived in caves and 
hollowed-out trees," Hollingworth said. "We cut the trees down, built over the 
caves and paved the land. But the animal still needs a harborage, and he's 
learning to live with us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Easy 
</P>
<P>
Finding a company willing and able to tackle the problem was not easy. Rabb 
said he was turned down by more than half a dozen companies and the Los Angeles 
County health department before he contacted Hydrex. 
</P>
<P>
How much is Hollingworth's Hydrex Pest Control Co. charging Fremont 
Compensation Insurance Company for this unusual job? 
</P>
<P>
"Let's put it this way," Hollingworth said. "For a big enough bag of money, 
I'll take all the sea gulls off Catalina Island."

SLIP-UP ON POLICE RADIO TIED TO DEATH OF WRONG MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A Sheriff's Department investigation into a deputy's fatal shooting of an 
unarmed Hawthorne man he mistook for the robber of a nearby liquor store is 
focusing on how an incorrect description of the suspect was broadcast over the 
police radio, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
After expressing the department's regrets over the "tragic death" of 
30-year-old Marcus Donel, the chief investigator of the incident said a 
preliminary review has cleared the deputy who pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Patrick Maxwell's actions in the shooting Tuesday night "were based on 
all the information he had available at the time," said the investigator, Lt. 
Joe Brown. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown said he wants to find out how the description of the robbery suspect 
changed from "Mexican" to black in two radio transmissions only minutes apart. 
</P>
<P>
The second, inaccurate broadcast led Maxwell to follow Donel's car, which he 
spotted within two blocks of the liquor store. Donel is black. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials said that when Donel was stopped in the driveway behind his 
apartment, he acted belligerently and appeared to reach for a gun, prompting 
the deputy to shoot him. But no gun was found. 
</P>
<P>
The family of Donel, who worked as an investigator and courier for a law firm, 
was devastated and outraged by the shooting, according to Winston McKesson, a 
lawyer representing the family. Donel is survived by a common-law wife and two 
daughters, ages 11 and 10, from a previous relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really to soon to say whether it was racially motivated," McKesson said 
of the shooting. "My information is that there were no black deputies on the 
scene. One has to question whether the robbery was used as a subterfuge to 
justify the stop" of a black man. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department on Thursday released tape recordings of a phone call 
reporting the liquor store robbery and subsequent radio communications. 
</P>
<P>
Calling authorities on the 911 emergency line at about 9:50 p.m., Jim Cheong, 
owner of Capri Liquor described the robber as a male "Mexican," about 18 years 
old, wearing a black shirt and black pants, carrying a small revolver. Cheong 
said he did not see or hear a car. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Patrol Car on Way 
</P>
<P>
The 911 operator assured Cheong a patrol car was on the way. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, a sheriff's dispatcher made a broadcast report of the robbery -- 
heard by patrol cars in the area -- that mirrored Cheong's description. 
</P>
<P>
Heard next was a broadcast apparently made by a deputy in a patrol car. The 
deputy suggests that another car cruise the area while "we'll try to get a 
more, uh, better description for you." 
</P>
<P>
The deputy and his partner subsequently interviewed the store owner, then 
broadcast the incorrect description of the suspect as, "One male black, 17 to 
18, 5-6, 125, wearing all black, and a black baseball cap." 
</P>
<P>
Cheong, in an interview, insisted that he consistently described the robber as 
"Mexican." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials said that, in addition to trying to determine how the 
mistake was made, they are checking Cheong's assertions that, after the 
shooting, one deputy "kept talking to me, like he was trying to persuade me I 
said black." 
</P>
<P>
The subsequent confrontation stemmed from the fact that Donel, although about 5 
foot 9 and 160 pounds, was a close match to the last description broadcast, 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Donel's stepbrother, Terry Curd, was also in his car, a white Cadillac. 
Following the car, Maxwell radioed for a back-up unit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Suspicious Movements' 
</P>
<P>
"A significant factor in the tragedy," Brown said, was Donel's "suspicious 
movements" after Maxwell ordered him from the car. 
</P>
<P>
Donel, Brown said, had "partially complied" with orders to lie down and had 
"his hands on the ground." Donel spoke "a stream of obscenities," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was ordered to extend his arms to his side. Instead, he drew one arm close 
to his body, rolled to that side, and appeared to be reaching for a handgun. 
Deputy Maxwell was very concerned for his safety, for the safety of others, and 
fired one round, striking Mr. Donel in the chest." 
</P>
<P>
Three other deputies at the scene also had their guns drawn, Brown said, but 
none fired. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said a private citizen who witnessed the incident confirmed deputies' 
report of "suspicious movements." 
</P>
<P>
McKesson, the Donel family's lawyer, says Curd's account conflicts with the 
sheriff's. Thus far, McKesson has advised Curd against talking with 
investigators and reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell is temporarily reassigned to desk duties. Officials refused to identify 
other deputies involved in the incident.

U.S. SEEKS HOME USED FOR LEGAL FEE IN DRUG CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Raising the stakes in their battle to halt the flow of drug profits into 
private havens, federal prosecutors have moved to seize a two-story Chatsworth 
residence from a well-known defense lawyer who had received it as payment for 
defending a man accused of trafficking in cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
In an affidavit unsealed this week, prosecutors allege that the attorney, David 
E. Kenner, should have known simply by reading news articles about his client 
that the $287,950 house had been purchased with narcotics proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint seeks a court order to transfer title of the house from Kenner to 
the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
The forfeiture action, which has already drawn an alarmed response from the 
criminal defense Bar, is the first of its kind in Los Angeles, and one of the 
few in the nation in which prosecutors have sought to seize property from an 
attorney when there had been no previous allegation that it was paid for with 
drug money. 
</P>
<P>
While prosecutors have long been irritated by wealthy drug barons' ability to 
hire expensive lawyers to delay legal proceedings against them, defense lawyers 
say such forfeiture actions threaten criminal defendants' constitutional rights 
to defend themselves and put the government in the position of eliminating 
undesirable defense lawyers simply by going after their fees. 
</P>
<P>
"The government claims the right basically to pauperize an accused person and 
to keep them from using their assets in order to hire a defense lawyer," said 
attorney Joseph Beeler, who is representing the National Assn. of Criminal 
Defense Lawyers, the American Civil Liberties Union and other defense Bar 
groups that have filed friend-of-the-court briefs in two similar forfeiture 
cases pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"If all of a sudden the government has the power to keep powerful advocates out 
of the courtroom, then they have damaged advocacy and created a monopoly in the 
marketplace of ideas," Beeler said. 
</P>
<P>
The cases now before the high court involve government seizures of defendants' 
assets before trial, effectively eliminating their ability to hire expensive 
private lawyers and forcing them to rely on public defenders or court-paid 
private attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles case is one of only a few in which the Justice Department has 
moved to seize an asset -- in this case a house -- that has already been 
conveyed to a lawyer as payment of a bona fide legal fee. 
</P>
<P>
The case is also unusual, defense lawyers say, because the government did not 
claim in its indictment of Kenner's client, Brian Bennett, that the house was a 
drug-related asset that was subject to forfeiture. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett was arrested in November, 1988, on an indictment charging him and a 
co-defendant with operating a cocaine ring that distributed as much as 2,500 
kilograms of the drug in a single four-month period last year. He has pleaded 
not guilty and is awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tough Position 
</P>
<P>
Kenner, who recently represented ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning entrepreneur Barry 
Minkow and Scott Roston, a bridegroom convicted of murdering his wife on their 
honeymoon cruise, said he has been placed in the difficult position of being 
unable to defend his fees without compromising his client's case. 
</P>
<P>
"The attempted seizure of the defendant property by the government at this 
critical juncture of the criminal proceedings against Brian Bennett constitutes 
a deliberate and callous attempt to disrupt the representation of Brian Bennett 
. . . and to deny him his Sixth Amendment right to counsel," Kenner argued in a 
response filed with the court Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The government's forfeiture action, he said, followed a contentious pretrial 
hearing in which the government was "compelled . . . to apologize" for accusing 
Kenner of "McCarthy-like tactics." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the action is "more egregious" given the government's recent 
notice that it plans to elevate the charge against Bennett to one of principal 
operation of a continuing criminal enterprise -- a charge that carries a 
mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Feess, chief assistant U.S. attorney, said prosecutors are often unable to 
trace lawyers' fees to drug proceeds because they have no information about fee 
agreements or what money came from where. In this case, he said, there was 
ample evidence that Bennett had acquired the house from his alleged narcotics 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
Kenner himself, prosecutors allege, essentially admitted his client's assets 
must have come from drug dealing when he admitted in court papers that Bennett 
had worked at only "odd jobs" in the years before his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"The contention of the government is that Mr. Kenner took those assets with 
knowledge that they were the proceeds of narcotics trafficking or with reason 
to believe that they were the proceeds of narcotics trafficking," Feess said. 
"Mr. Kenner does not stand in any better position than any other member of 
society when he takes property under those circumstances."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MINISTER TESTIFIES IN MCMARTIN TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A minister who in the early 1980s counseled Manhattan Beach McMartin Pre-School 
defendants Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, testified 
Thursday that the sessions had nothing to do with child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
"I never discussed with Raymond Buckey sexual problems with children," said Dr. 
Frank Richelieu, who described himself as pastor of the Church of Religious 
Science, a metaphysical and motivational denomination, and a licensed 
practitioner of prayer treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Redondo Beach minister testified outside the presence of the jury, 
"I've seen Raymond on general matters regarding his direction in life, his 
self-image and self-worth, and at one time Raymond was going through a drinking 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
Richelieu was subpoenaed by prosecutors, who continue to maintain that the 
counseling sessions focused on Raymond Buckey's sexual attraction to young 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders reserved a decision on 
whether the sessions are protected by confidentiality, or whether they may be 
discussed in front of the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Richelieu said that there was "not a word of truth" in a prosecutor's 1987 
statement that entries in Virginia McMartin's diaries referring to her 
grandson's "problem" was a reference to his alleged sexual proclivity toward 
children.

BARRICADED MAN KILLS HIMSELF IN VAN NUYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys man who fired several gunshots at Los Angeles police officers shot 
himself to death Thursday during a lengthy standoff that ended after the city's 
armored battering ram destroyed most of his house. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman, Gary Snyder, 51, an unemployed tow truck driver described by 
residents as a neighborhood "terror," was found dead about 6:30 a.m. in the 
rubble of his home. 
</P>
<P>
About three hours earlier, police drove the tank-like battering ram into the 
three-bedroom house several times, leaving all but one rear bedroom destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Snyder was found under debris in the living room and appeared to 
have killed himself with a shotgun blast. The shotgun and a handgun were found 
by his side. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Screaming for Help 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Warren Knowles said the incident began about 8:45 p.m. Wednesday when a 
woman identified as Snyder's girlfriend, Tina Marie Rathje, 30, ran from his 
home screaming for help but was chased down by Snyder at a neighbor's house and 
forced back to his house. 
</P>
<P>
The neighbors called police but warned officers that Snyder had several weapons 
in his home. "They were told that this guy was dangerous, that he had guns," 
Knowles said. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than approach Snyder's front door, the officers used their patrol car's 
loudspeaker to order everyone out of his house, located on a cul-de-sac in the 
7500 block of De Celis Place. 
</P>
<P>
Three people emerged, including house mates William Burti, 41, Jill Croteau, 
45, and Rathje, who had bruises on her face and stomach. They told officers 
that Snyder was armed and refused to leave. 
</P>
<P>
The police Special Weapons and Tactics team was called to the scene and nearby 
homes were evacuated while streets were closed to traffic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shots Fired From House 
</P>
<P>
After several calls from police for Snyder to surrender, officers shot tear gas 
into the house. Police said Snyder responded by firing about 10 shots from a 
side window. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Snyder's shots "initiated our decision to bring out the ram," 
Knowles said. 
</P>
<P>
"Snyder was asked to come to the window and look at the ram," Knowles said. "He 
was told we intended to use it if he did not come out." 
</P>
<P>
There was no response and at 3 a.m. officers started repeatedly crashing the 
ram into the house. 
</P>
<P>
"It completely took out the front of the house," said Mitch Lupoff, a neighbor. 
"You could hear glass crashing and walls crumbling." 
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, officers searched the rubble for nearly three hours before finding 
Snyder's body. 
</P>
<P>
In the one room left undamaged by the ram, police found Nazi paraphernalia, 
including swastika flags and stickers. Officers also found boxes in the back 
yard containing hundreds of spent cartridge casings that Snyder apparently had 
collected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feared by Neighbors 
</P>
<P>
Some neighbors described Snyder as an unfriendly, heavily tattooed man whom 
they feared. They said Snyder took poor care of his property and rode loud 
motorcycles. He recently upset neighbors by allowing a friend to park an old 
school bus on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Lupoff said he believed that some residents feared Snyder because they 
suspected him of throwing a beer bottle through a neighbor's window and of 
painting the sidewalk in front of another neighbor's home after getting into 
disputes with him. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a real terror, and people living on the block tried to stay away," 
Lupoff said.

COUPLE ARRESTED IN BEATING DEATH OF WOMAN'S CHILD, 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH J. MANN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Boyle Heights woman and her live-in boyfriend were in police custody 
Thursday, held on suspicion of beating the woman's 2-year-old child to death 
and then burying her body on a remote hillside. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Gutierrez and Manuel Bonilla, both 22, were booked for investigation of 
murder and held without bail after police discovered Johanna Gutierrez's body 
covered with sand in Azusa Canyon early Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had gone to Hollenbeck police station Wednesday afternoon to report 
that the child was missing from their home in the 600 block of North Fickett 
Street since about 5 p.m. the previous day, said Hollenbeck Capt. Art Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez first told police she believed that the child was kidnaped after she 
had left the child alone in the house and went off to buy medicine. Gutierrez 
had told police that Johanna was often sick. 
</P>
<P>
But Lopez said police grew suspicious because the couple waited almost 24 hours 
to report the alleged abduction. "That gives you a clue something was not 
right," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
Police detectives questioned the pair several times Wednesday and interviewed 
their friends and neighbors in an attempt to find the child. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said that Bonilla, a security guard, eventually changed his story, 
telling investigators that he and Gutierrez beat the child to death because she 
urinated and cried excessively. Bonilla then volunteered to lead police to the 
child. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an unusual situation," Lopez said. "(Detectives) interviewed the 
suspect and he just decided to change his mind." 
</P>
<P>
The child's mother also admitted she participated in the beating that occurred 
sometime Tuesday, Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
Four children -- a 2-week-old infant and three others of 1, 3, and 4 years -- 
were taken from the house and placed in the custody of the Los Angeles County 
Department of Children's Services, a Police Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the couple, who had been living in the tiny one-bedroom 
apartment for more than a year, had argued constantly. Some said they heard 
slapping noises and cries from the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Adela Oliveras, who lives in a building behind the family, described Johanna as 
a timid child. But she was often left alone and her diaper was often soiled, 
Oliveras said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Andrade, whose wife was the previous tenant in the apartment, was 
visibly shaken by Johanna's death. He said that he had asked Gutierrez and 
Bonilla if he could adopt the child, but that the pair refused. 
</P>
<P>
"She was something special, she would trust anybody," Andrade said. "But she 
didn't want anybody to touch her." 
</P>
<P>
The couple will be arraigned today in Los Angeles Superior Court.

SCHOOL 'ALMOST BACK TO NORMAL' AFTER WALKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARITA HERNANDEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One week after the end of the bitter Los Angeles teachers' strike, the halls of 
Le Conte Junior High School were abuzz once again with the sounds of history 
and geometry lessons filtering through half-opened classroom doors. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think about the strike anymore," said seventh-grader Tanya Chavez, 13, 
as she walked to class Friday morning. "It's like it never happened." 
</P>
<P>
While the regular routine of school activities has resumed at Le Conte, 
normalcy in other areas may be a long time coming. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resentment Beginning to Subside 
</P>
<P>
Among teachers, resentment is just now beginning to subside between those who 
went on strike and those who crossed the picket lines. Students are cramming to 
make up for lost time, in some cases doing twice the usual homework. And 
administrators are rushing to meet end-of-the-term budgetary deadlines and to 
prepare for graduation ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are almost back to normal," said history teacher Akop Terastvadsadrian, 
29. "Everybody's involved with teaching, student absences are down and we're 
picking up where we left off." 
</P>
<P>
Like other teachers, he noted that students returned to classes with renewed 
enthusiasm after spending the strike doing little more than busy work. 
Terastvadsadrian said he has taken advantage of the new attitude, giving his 
students twice the usual work. 
</P>
<P>
"On the first day back, we hit the ground running," he said. "I tried to make 
my students understand it's for their own future." 
</P>
<P>
Some teachers, however, complained that the disruption of normal schedules, 
coupled with a distracting end-of-the-year anticipation, has made it harder to 
get kids to settle down to schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
"Two weeks is a lot of time to make up," said math department Chairman Nader 
Delnavaz, 28. Sometimes, he said, it is impossible. Students received only a 
day's notice for a statewide algebra and geometry examination that normally 
takes two weeks of preparation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect they did very well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, added Principal David Sowers, "we're in as good a shape as could be 
expected." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Rush Like Crazy' 
</P>
<P>
Sowers and his assistants have "had to rush like crazy" to complete the myriad 
details for graduation activities and awards ceremonies, including the 
selection of students for the awards and the purchase of school trophies. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want the kids to feel shorted and then blame it on their teachers," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some teachers contend that the strike has made students and administrators 
appreciate them more. And others, noting that the school's year-round schedule 
keeps some teachers from getting to know one another, say the strike has 
improved camaraderie among those who walked the picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
Even the tension that characterized relations a week ago between the striking 
teachers and those who never left the classroom has ebbed, according to most 
instructors. On the first day back at school, Terastvadsadrian said he turned 
away when a teacher who had crossed the picket lines greeted him in the faculty 
cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very angry. I thought there were some people I'd never want to talk to 
or see again," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Although he remains "disappointed" by colleagues who stayed in school, 
Terastvadsadrian shared a table in the cafeteria Thursday with the school nurse 
and another teacher. Both had crossed the picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to work together for the sake of our students," he said.

CARTOON CHIC; 
</P>
<P>
A NEW KICK IN FANTASY WEAR: FROM BETTY BOOP TO BATMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Thirty-four years ago, Congress blamed certain comic books for the antisocial 
behavior of America's restless youth. Today, cartoons are inspiring movies, 
rock music and even adult fashion. Some new looks in casual wear tout the 
colorful, vibrant images of pulp literature, in sizes to fit grown-ups who 
still want to play superhero. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt Batman is behind the trend. With the release of the movie just three 
weeks away, the image of the dark-caped crusader seems to be multiplying. On 
the lighter, and even sillier side, there's Betty Boop, Tweety Bird and Archie 
to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
It started when a mystic-looking bat appeared on more than the usual number of 
T-shirts, lapel pins and lunch pails this spring. Now his sinister, yet 
strangely appealing, image is showing up on satin baseball jackets, men's vests 
and hipper-than-thou crop-tops, leggings and skimpy slip dresses. 
</P>
<P>
The youth culture, particularly the rock 'n' roll faction, seems to think it 
has first dibs on the new, cartoon chic. Thanks in part to Slash, the lead 
guitarist for Guns N' Roses, who wears a Batman T-shirt on the group's 
"Appetite for Destruction" album. And thanks too to the softer-edged songster, 
Jon Bon Jovi, who displays his tribute to comic icons by wearing a Superman 
tattoo on his arm. 
</P>
<P>
Such images are not lost on Tripp N.Y.C., a company that has been producing 
"rock 'n' roll you can wear" for more than 10 years. Recently, Tripp 
incorporated the Batman logo into tank tops, leggings, jackets and a 
minimal-coverage bustier dress. Designers Daang and Ray Goodman point out that 
bat-garb springs directly from rock 'n' roll dress styles. 
</P>
<P>
"The look sold very well long before there was any mention of a movie coming 
out," Ray says. "Batman is baaaad, he's very rock 'n' roll. He's not just a 
comic book character, he's a life style." 
</P>
<P>
According to the Goodmans, Tripp customers relate to Batman as a hero of the 
night. The company's main market is shoppers in their 20s who aren't at all 
interested in cartoon clothes as "kiddie fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Ray explains: "Batman's not a childish concept. The person attracted to our 
designs is a kid at heart, but also an adult. The look is cute, but sexy." 
There's a sleek, confident tone to Tripp's snug-fitting, Lycra styles, that 
meshes perfectly with the streetwise buyer's self-image. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone wants to be a superhero; the clothes reflect that fantasy," Daang 
says. "And Lycra is the material of superheroes. It never wrinkles." 
</P>
<P>
Grown-ups who would rather relive their younger years, spent watching "Looney 
Tunes" on Saturday morning TV, might prefer "Too Cute" cartoon clothes. This 
spring the company put Betty Boop, Fred Flintstone and Tweety Bird images on 
jeans, jackets and cut-offs. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Roseanne Barr wears a Betty Boop jacket. Sylvester Stallone bought one 
of Tweety Bird boxing with Sylvester the cat. Brooke Shields, Bruce Springsteen 
and Debbie Gibson are other Too Cute consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"The clothes let our customers live a fiction and escape being too serious," 
theorizes the line's designer, Patrick Guetta. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Sahagen of the company adds: "We sell to everyone from children to 
40-year-olds." She believes that old-time 'toons and their slapstick 
associations are Too Cute's main attraction for adults. 
</P>
<P>
"Betty Boop is the queen of our line. People are constantly saying, 'I'm 
addicted to her.' " 
</P>
<P>
People drawn to Betty's childlike frivolity will wear her image and recall the 
playfulness of their past. Meanwhile, those who relate to Batman's dark world 
of heroes and villains are likely to dress like that campy street hero. But are 
these cartoon costumes likely to stay in fashion's active file after "Batman," 
the movie, is history? 
</P>
<P>
Julie Newmar, who played Catwoman on "Batman," the '60s TV series, hazards a 
guess. "It's the attitude of the '90s," she purrs about the 'toon togs. "You 
get into the right costume and your soul goes into the character."

NEW WORLD ENTREPRENEUR FOCUSES ON NOSTALGIA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In her quest to bring back a little bit of yesterday, designer Nancy Johnson 
started making history -- of the fashion sort. Clothes with leopard spots and 
ostrich feathers tend to grab the headlines, but Los Angeles-based Johnson's 
nostalgic lace-trimmed tea dresses and hand-embroidered frocks have quietly 
blossomed into a $23-million business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Boutique 
</P>
<P>
Picture a great-grandmother's dressing table with perfume bottles, powder puffs 
and doilies -- that's the mood of Johnson designs. And it's the feeling she 
re-created in her new boutique at Saks in Beverly Hills. Her dress and suit 
silhouettes are reminiscent of the '20s, '30s and '40s, but the nostalgia stops 
there. Making clothes with Old World charm, Johnson has become a New World 
entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
She is one of the world's largest users of handmade Chinese lace and embroidery 
for apparel, and she commutes to China and Hong Kong to work with hundreds of 
Chinese women who hand-produce the lace-trimmed and embroidered fabric she 
uses. Much of it is copied after antique French, Belgian and Swiss laces. 
</P>
<P>
"In China, women can still replicate almost any lace," Johnson explains. "But 
there are some, for instance from Brussels and the Netherlands, that are so 
intricate they will never be reproduced." 
</P>
<P>
Evaluating the quality of lace takes some expertise, and handmade varieties are 
the most desirable. 
</P>
<P>
"Machine-made lace is typically flat and characterless, because the fabric has 
no imperfections," Johnson explains. "Handmade lace has slight irregularities 
and a subtle unevenness that gives it a texture machines cannot capture." 
Often, she adds, the reverse side looks as if it has been embroidered. 
</P>
<P>
While she works with handmade laces most of the time, her major concession to 
industrialization is Venise, considered the finest machine variety. Johnson 
puts it on formal wedding gowns, as well as collars and cuffs for other suits 
and dresses. 
</P>
<P>
Although her clothes are extremely feminine, she says many women are wearing 
them to the boardroom, not the tea room. "Lace is appealing to women who have 
reached a certain point in their lives and careers," the 43-year-old designer 
says. "They don't feel the need to dress according to a standard that 
businessmen have set. They allow themselves the luxury of dressing more 
femininely." 
</P>
<P>
She cites the success of Victoria magazine, a monthly that focuses on 
traditional life styles and designs, and notes that her customer treasures the 
sort of classics seen in the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interests Changed 
</P>
<P>
"This is the same woman who had earthenware pottery and handblown glass in the 
'60s, but now she's buying fine linens and serving dinner with sterling, china 
and crystal," Johnson explains. 
</P>
<P>
When those same women were part of the counterculture, Johnson was dressing 
them in imported Indian skirts and tops, clothing she found when traveling 
around the world in a Volkswagen bus. "They weren't just pretty clothes, but a 
symbol of the times, embodying a social phenomenon counter to the Machine Age," 
says the designer. 
</P>
<P>
"Now those women have matured and so have I. We still have an appreciation for 
anything that's handmade, that speaks of quality. That's why they're willing to 
pay for lace." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's dresses sell for $200 to $400, depending on the amount of detail and 
lace trim, and which natural-fiber fabric is used: cotton, linen or silk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prices Expected to Increase 
</P>
<P>
As labor costs rise in China, Johnson predicts inevitable price increases, or 
limitations on detail. She says she expects prices of her simplest pieces to 
increase to $250 or $300 next year, "or we'll do things with much less lace -- 
we can't keep prices down and do what we do now." 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson seems unaffected by the problems of world economics. If anything is 
bothering her, it's jet lag. Her whirlwind life style continues, and she finds 
herself traveling one week to Hong Kong, the next to London and then rushing 
back to Los Angeles after a tour of duty in New York. Both Harrods and 
Selfridge's in London feature her work. 
</P>
<P>
Like so many of her customers, she says she can't slow down. "What I really 
love to do is just be at home and look at books about lace. Now that's a 
treat."

"Diversity" is the name of the newest fashion game in town, and it debuts today 
on the fourth floor of the Cooper Building in downtown Los Angeles. Key players 
are graduates of the Fashion Industry of Design and Merchandising, who will 
sell their one-of-a-kind clothing and accessories for men, women and children 
every week from now on, Thursday through Sunday. Along with jewelry and 
hand-painted T-shirts, there are more unusual, wintry items, such as alpaca 
coats and real-fur earmuffs. According to an FIDM spokesperson, the idea for 
Diversity came from London, where Hyper Hyper, a company formed by a group of 
young fashion designers, is causing quite a stir.

Candy chose a white polo shirt and a Perry Como-style, navy cardigan.

Tere Tereba after funny lady Sandra Bernhard wore a dress from the designer's 
spring collection to perform in London for Prince Charles and Princess Diana. 
The dress is ankle-length, off-the-shoulder and tight fitting, with an 
embroidered net shawl to go with it. Tereba says it is available at the Shauna 
Stein boutique.

Astonishing Reproductions 
</P>
<P>
"Astonish me" are the words art director Alexey Brodovitch would snap during 
his reign at Harper's Bazaar magazine, from 1934 to 1958. The astonishing 
results, including photographic masterpieces by Richard Avedon, are part of an 
exhibit of over-sized, magazine-page reproductions at the Art Center College of 
Design in Pasadena. Look for Audrey Hepburn, Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra 
among the famous faces. The exhibit is open to the public through June 31 and 
free of charge.

Liza's Vacation Wear 
</P>
<P>
Liza Minnelli was in town doing a little shopping for her upcoming vacation in 
Cap d'Antibes, where she and husband Mark Gero are borrowing a friend's villa 
for three weeks of R&amp;R. While taking in the Riviera, stepmom Lee Minnelli 
reports, Liza will be wearing L.A. designer Louis Estevez's new matador look: 
white high-waisted silk pants and his full-sleeved, white-and-black Dalmation 
spot blouse. When she tires of that, she can switch into the black version of 
same, which she also bought at Estevez's Melrose Avenue shop. 
</P>
<P>
She's Definitely Not Fur It 
</P>
<P>
Actress Julianne Phillipes, celebrity photographer Greg Gorman and fashion 
model Janice Dickinson gathered together at Chantal Cloutier's house (she owns 
Cloutier, the styling, makeup and hair agency) to reconsider fashion's role in 
protecting animals. Cloutier announced that she will exercise her considerable 
clout from now on, by refusing to book her clients on fashion projects that 
involve real animal fur. "Wearing real fur advocates cruelty to animals," she 
feels. If that's not enough: "Wearing fur is simply unfashionable."

Hey Bubb! That's Brian Bubb, who designed the Perry Ellis menswear line until 
he departed from the company a year ago. (Roger Forsythe replaced him.) Bubb 
now plans to launch his own collection of neckwear and evening accessories, 
starting with Holiday 1989. He'll include neckties, bow ties, vests and 
cummerbunds, label the line simply Bubb and market it as "exquisite and 
expensive." (Ties retail for about $50-$60.) He says he has an animal-print 
group called "Oh Sauvage" in his first collection. And he can explain why: 
"People get too deadly serious about fashion. You should have fun with a tie."

Just the Short of It 
</P>

Not everybody thinks Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts is a fashion 
wipeout. Even though he boasts about his bargain-basement suits and his frayed 
shirt sleeves, he managed to make the top of this year's shorter men in America 
fashion "in" list. Listen hears from Bob Stern, who owns Short Sizes Inc., the 
Cleveland store that issues the verdict, that Dukakis is No. 1 because he knows 
the secret to shorter-man dressing with style. "It's proper proportions" Stern 
asserts. Others in this year's lineup (all of them 5-foot-8 or less) are 
composer Leonard Bernstein (5 feet, 8 inches), publisher Malcolm Forbes (5 
feet, 7 inches), talk-show host Dick Cavett (5 feet, 3 inches) and actor Danny 
DeVito (5 feet, 1 inch). Stern, who measures in at 5-feet-2, also tells us that 
his mail-order-catalogue business is booming, especially in Japan.

GRADUATES HAVE DESIGNS ON MARKETABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two fashion design programs, at Woodbury University and Santa Monica College, 
finished the school year with graduating-student shows last week. And the 
audiences were impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," said one viewer at the Woodbury event, "I saw a lot of clothes I 
could go out and buy, if they were sold in a store." That sentiment was 
prevalent throughout the crowd, and it may be the ultimate compliment to any 
student designer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reasonable Interpretations 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason may have been that many of the garments were reasonable 
interpretations of looks by cutting-edge designers from the United States and 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Cecelia Pham, who won a prize for her custom-quality tailoring and another for 
her sportswear designs, showed a cocoa suede dress trimmed with black 
passementerie that would look at home in a posh, Beverly Hills boutique. 
</P>
<P>
Before she decided on fashion as a career, Pham spent three years as a nuclear 
reactor operator at Oregon State. Some of that precision and attention to 
detail shows up in her design work. 
</P>
<P>
Mona Momtaz carried off three awards from Woodbury in the contemporary, evening 
and flashback (retro fashion) categories. Her black-and-white houndstooth-check 
dress, trimmed in glossy black fur, looked inspired by Bill Blass. And her 
black velvet minidress with hooded, velvet cape, encrusted with faux jewels and 
gold tassels, was clearly a homage to Christian Lacroix. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Winning Look 
</P>
<P>
As was Bonnie McAllister's frolicsome can-can dress in orange and hot pink. But 
her winning look was in the burlap category, for which she created a farm-girl 
outfit. Oversize burlap overalls went with a red-and-white polka-dot top. 
</P>
<P>
Gasps and spontaneous applause filled the room when Linh-Xuan Nguyen's bridal 
gown came down the runway. The bubbly Nguyen, a Vietnam native, fashioned a 
dress with definite cowgirl influences, down to the beaded, silver fringe. 
</P>
<P>
In Woodbury's best-of-the-show category, the winner was J-Me K (a hip moniker 
that's pronounced "Jamie K"), whose clothes seem in sync with Paris designer 
Jean Paul Gaultier's irreverent approach to fashion. K's cheeky bridal gown was 
replete with recycled soda-can tabs, including the bra top. More interlocking 
tabs tinkled like wind chimes against an ivory chiffon skirt. It was chosen, a 
school spokeswoman explained, based on creativity and salability. Some in the 
audience seemed unconvinced. "Only Cher could wear that dress," one observer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the winners at Woodbury, Stacy Seeds got honors in the "cultural 
exchange" category for a pewter-colored pants outfit with draped pants and 
bolero jacket, inspired by Middle Eastern folk costumes. 
</P>
<P>
The next evening, at the Santa Monica College school of fashion design and 
merchandising, two elements stole the show -- the children's clothes and the 
young models themselves. The self-conscious pre-adolescents mimicked runway 
models, and the shy, rosy-cheeked toddlers earned their own round of applause. 
</P>
<P>
So did the refined styles of Irene Raskin, whose work took a prize in the 
contemporary category. She showed a winsome navy dress with lace collar. Other 
winning looks included Katherine Dyer's red wool coats that evoked images of 
English grade school. Kristine Beck's sassy play clothes would likely be a hit 
among preteens. She won an award in the menswear and children's wear category. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica's best-of-show winners were Kristine Beck and Tommy Shenker. But 
Shenker's reworking of the little black dress did little to convey why the 
judges felt he was a star in his field. And Becks' floral and black ensembles 
were pleasant, but not obviously outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Carlo Gholami's beautifully cut clothes for both sexes -- 
especially his double-breasted, glen plaid jacket with matching miniskirt -- 
showed the strong influence of his idol, Giorgio Armani, and marked him as a 
definite comer in the industry. He won a number of prizes, including first 
place in menswear and children's wear and second place in the evening and 
career categories.

POLLUTION CONTROLS ORDERED ON TOXIC WASTE INCINERATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge Thursday rejected a request for a comprehensive 
environmental impact report on a proposed toxic waste incinerator in Vernon but 
ruled the plant must be equipped with up-to-date pollution controls before 
beginning operations. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Kurt Lewin's order would add at least $6 million to the incinerator's 
$29-million price tag and result in a delay of at least 20 months in beginning 
operations, said Alfred Grossman, chairman of Security Environmental Systems of 
Garden Grove, the parent company of the plant's builder, California Thermal 
Treatment Services. 
</P>
<P>
He declined comment on what effect the ruling might have. 
</P>
<P>
Lewin said he will issue an order requiring the Southern California Air Quality 
Management District "to extend the (operating) permit without the conditions 
requiring an extended environmental impact report or new health assessment, but 
with the condition requiring the installation of state-of-the-art 
(anti-pollution) equipment." 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD and state Department of Health Services came under fire for approving 
permits for the incinerator's operation without first requiring an 
environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
When the AQMD finally refused to extend the plant's permit unless it 
commissioned the environmental and health risk reports, California Thermal 
filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists are concerned that the incinerator, which would burn such 
wastes as pesticides, alcohol, paint sludge and metal residue, would spew 
dangerous fumes into the air near food-processing plants. 
</P>
<P>
At first, opposition to the plant was limited to the mostly Latino, low-income 
residents living around Vernon, an industrial city 3 1/2 miles southeast of 
downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers Join Opponents 
</P>
<P>
As the public outcry grew, others, including local and state lawmakers, joined 
in opposition to the proposed plant. 
</P>
<P>
If built, the plant would be the first commercial hazardous waste incinerator 
in a metropolitan area. It would burn 22,400 tons of hazardous waste each year, 
about 20% of the toxic waste generated within a 15-mile radius. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Eichhorn, an AQMD spokesman, said the district was pleased by the judge's 
requirement for anti-pollution devices but disappointed with his ruling 
striking down the requests for an environmental report and new health 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
Another lawsuit over the plant is pending. The city of Los Angeles, several 
community groups and lawmakers sued the state Department of Health Services to 
try to reverse the department's approval of health permits for the plant and to 
require an environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AQMD Called Too Late 
</P>
<P>
Lewin, in his ruling, said the AQMD was too late in trying to require an 
environmental impact report. But the state health department could still block 
the incinerator's operation if it finds that the plant would pose a health 
hazard, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, it should be recognized that society is fast running out of 
alternatives for the disposal of the ever increasing toxic substances that will 
be accepted by this facility," Lewin said in his written ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"Construction of such facilities cannot be postponed indefinitely, nor can they 
be continuously relocated to someone else's bailiwick," he said.

CITY TO HONOR STUDENTS FOR COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Fullerton City Council will honor about 80 students from public and private 
schools this month for their work in school and community activities. 
</P>
<P>
The awards are part of the city's annual Student Recognition Program. Each 
student will receive a plaque. Grace Carroll Miranda, program coordinator, said 
the goals are "to encourage youths to become involved in community activities, 
to stimulate them to become well-rounded individuals and to provide an 
incentive and recognition for high personal standards and conduct." 
</P>
<P>
The students are chosen for the awards by their respective schools and must be 
involved in extracurricular school or community activities. 
</P>
<P>
The high school recipients of the awards will be honored at ceremonies at their 
schools later this month. The elementary and junior high students winning the 
awards will be collectively honored at the Tuesday meeting of the City Council.

BREN, ROWLAND PICKED TO RECEIVE UCI MEDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irvine Co. Chairman Donald Bren, whose philanthropic largess has often 
benefited UC Irvine, and chemistry professor F. Sherwood Rowland, who has 
studied the depletion of the Earth's ozone layer, will be among four recipients 
of the UCI Medal on June 16. 
</P>
<P>
Bren was honored for his gifts to UCI, particularly his agreement last year to 
remove a deed restriction and allow development of a joint 
university-commercial research park on land purchased from the Irvine Co. 25 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland, who discovered that a common compound used in air-conditioning systems 
and cleaning solvents was destroying the ozone layer, is credited with 
launching a global effort to ban the compound. 
</P>
<P>
The medal, UCI's highest honor, will also go to Richard Hausman, former vice 
president of Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and founding president of the UCI 
College of Medicine Foundation's board of directors, and Howard 
Schneiderman,former dean of UCI's School of Biological Sciences and now senior 
vice president and chief scientist for the Monsanto Co. in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
The UCI Medal was established in 1984 to honor those who have made significant 
contributions to the university. Founding Chancellor Daniel Aldrich received 
the first UCI Medal.

CITY SPONSORS VIDEOS ON DROWNING PREVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brea's city government is sponsoring a series of videos on drowning prevention 
this month. The videos will be on the city's cable system, Video Brea Line, 
Channel 3. The shows will be broadcast on that cable channel at 7 p.m. on 
Monday, Wednesday and June 12. 
</P>
<P>
"Portions of the segment may be disturbing, but it is important to relay this 
information . . . ," said a spokeswoman for the Brea Community Services 
Department. She said drowning has become so prevalent that it is now the 
leading cause of death for children in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the video broadcasts, the Community Services Department has 
free, printed information about drowning prevention. City residents can call 
the department at (714) 990-7737 to request the material or other additional 
information.

KRAFT LOSES BID TO BLOCK 8 MURDERS FROM TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawyers for Randy Steven Kraft failed Thursday in their bid to keep evidence of 
eight more murders out of the penalty phase of his trial, but said they 
wouldn't debate most of the facts of those killings. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping these murders can be presented as expeditiously as possible so 
that we can get on with what I consider the real issues of a penalty phase, the 
character and background (of Kraft)," defense attorney James G. Merwin told the 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, 44, convicted in Santa Ana last month of 16 Orange County murders, could 
be the most prolific serial killer in the country's history, prosecutors 
contend. They have linked Kraft in court papers to a total of 45 sex-related 
murders of young men. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown has decided to 
present evidence of only eight additional killings when he asks jurors for a 
death verdict at the next phase of the trial, which is scheduled to begin 
Monday. Those murders occurred in Oregon and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft's lawyers half-kiddingly have thanked Brown for paring down the numbers 
to shorten the next trial phase. But any new murders at all are too much, they 
argue. 
</P>
<P>
"If this were football, Brown would be assessed a 15-yard penalty for piling 
on," Merwin said. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin, at a non-jury hearing Thursday, 
rejected several motions by the defense to keep the Oregon and Michigan murders 
out of the next phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
In that phase, the jurors will decide only between verdicts of death or life in 
prison without parole. A judge can reduce a death verdict but cannot upgrade a 
life without parole verdict to death. In Orange County, no judge has set aside 
a jury's death verdict since the new death law was first instituted 12 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dilemma for Defense 
</P>
<P>
Kraft's lawyers say the new murders in the penalty phase present a dilemma for 
Kraft's defense. 
</P>
<P>
"The focus of the penalty phase should be the proper penalty for the 16 murders 
in the conviction, not another trial on whether he is guilty of killing eight 
more," Kraft attorney William J. Kopeny said. 
</P>
<P>
While Kraft lawyer Merwin was not conceding that Kraft killed the victims in 
Oregon and Michigan, he said the defense will not contest many of the facts. 
</P>
<P>
"The jury already thinks he killed 16 people, and we have to concentrate on 
that," Merwin said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the defense's only real victory in a full day of motions Thursday was 
to persuade the prosecution to stipulate to some of the more technical 
testimony, to prevent bringing in several out-of-state witnesses. Merwin also 
wants Brown to agree not to put on families of the victims in Oregon and 
Michigan. That issue is one of many which will be addressed when the hearings 
continue today. 
</P>
<P>
Judge McCartin has warned the attorneys that he will not allow these non-jury 
hearings to interrupt the beginning of testimony on Monday. He threatened to 
hold a court session Saturday if the defense motions are not wrapped up today. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, a computer expert, was on business in northern Oregon and in Grand 
Rapids, Mich., for the Santa Monica-based Lear Siegler Inc. at the times when 
all eight of those young men were killed between 1980 and 1982. Most of the 
victims in the Kraft case were either emasculated, mutilated, or in some way 
sexually assaulted.

BUILDER PULLS OUT OVER PAY AT AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The subcontracting firm that is building the new upper-level roadway for John 
Wayne Airport's new passenger terminal pulled its 60-person work force off the 
job Thursday in a pay dispute with the general contractor, airport officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The subcontractor, Kettering-Kruseman of Artesia, told employees not to come to 
work today and said the firm would "wait and see" about renewing work next 
week, according to an employee who declined to identify himself to a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Company and airport officials confirmed the employee's account but said they 
could provide no details. Earlier this year, another subcontractor briefly 
walked off the job until the general contractor, Taylor Woodrow California 
Construction Ltd., paid subcontractors out of corporate funds instead of 
waiting for money from the county, which owns the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Payments have been 30 to 90 days behind schedule at times due to disputes over 
change orders and documentation requested by the county to support contractor 
and subcontractors' billings. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Woodrow officials were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Kettering &amp; Kruseman attorney James McGee of Irvine said the dispute is 
over Taylor Woodrow's failure to pay $1.3 million to the subcontractor's. "They 
missed the payroll payment on May 15. They missed the payroll payment on May 
30." Under their contract, Taylor Woodrow agreed that Kettering &amp; Kruseman 
could withdraw workers if payments are more than five days late, McGee said, 
adding: 
</P>
<P>
"Kettering &amp; Kruseman is concerned that Taylor Woodrow does not have 
sufficient money to make the payment. So this is a major problem." 
</P>
<P>
McGee noted that there has been "a lot of speculation that Taylor Woodrow bid 
the project too low and therefore at some point toward the end of the job, 
there just would not be sufficient money coming from the county to pay the 
subcontractors."

JUDGE SHAW CLEARED BY COMMISSION'S INQUIRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Municipal Judge Susanne Shaw was cleared of any wrongdoing or misconduct 
Thursday by the California Commission on Judicial Performance, which has been 
investigating several judges in Harbor Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
In a two paragraph statement, the San Francisco-based commission, which 
investigates allegations of misconduct against state judges, said its 
investigation of allegations leveled against Shaw is over and there is no need 
for further action. 
</P>
<P>
"Recent publicity concerning the Harbor Judicial District of the Orange County 
Municipal Court contained allegations about Judge Susanne Shaw and listed her 
among the judges under investigation by the Commission on Judicial Performance. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission's investigation of those allegations concerning Judge Shaw has 
been completed. After consideration, the commission has determined not to 
proceed further and the matter is now closed," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The Shaw matter was an outgrowth of a broad inquiry into allegations that 
Municipal Judges Brian R. Carter, 63, and Calvin P. Schmidt, 59, had given 
preferential treatment to friends and courtroom favors to prostitutes in 
exchange for sex. The commission dropped its case against Carter when he 
retired from the bench in January. 
</P>
<P>
A commission hearing on allegations against Schmidt is scheduled for August in 
the Harbor Municipal Court building. It is unclear whether the hearing will be 
held in public or behind closed doors. Schmidt's lawyers have gone to court and 
won a temporary restraining order to keep the proceedings closed, despite a 
recently passed state law intended to open commission hearings. 
</P>
<P>
The Times learned last year that Shaw had been a chief accuser of other judges 
at Harbor Court and that they had retaliated by complaining to the commission 
that she had improperly endorsed a political candidate and had made remarks 
from the bench that allegedly offended Latino defendants. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's chief lawyer and director, Jack E. Frankel, said 
confidentiality laws prevent his discussing specifics of the allegations and 
complaints against Shaw. He also declined to confirm whether two other Harbor 
Municipal Court judges, Russell A. Bostrom and Selim S. Franklin, were being 
investigated regarding allegations that they tried to pressure Newport Beach 
officials into ending a police inquiry into Carter and Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy that the commission made the announcement," Shaw said. "I 
think that's all I can say now. The rest is confidential." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw was elected a Municipal Court judge in 1984 after spending 12 years in the 
Orange County district attorney's office. She was named to head the county's 
first rape task force and was selected Judge of the Year by the Orange County 
Narcotic Officers in 1985.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ESCONDIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hyundai of Escondido settled a lawsuit Thursday filed by the district attorney 
that alleged the auto dealer engaged in misleading advertising. The dealer will 
pay $122,000 in civil penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Without admitting wrongdoing, the firm agreed to pay $80,000 in civil 
penalties, $10,000 to the state Department of Motor Vehicles for investigative 
costs, and $32,000 in restitution to 45 potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Miller, a spokeswoman for the district attorney, said the false and 
misleading newspaper ads failed to disclose that only a limited number of autos 
were available at the advertised sale prices. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the settlement, the dealer was prohibited from engaging in false 
advertising and unfair business practices in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the investigation was initiated by the DMV after a potential 
customer complained that he went to Hyundai of Escondido looking for an 
advertised deal and a salesperson told him there had only been one such car and 
it had been sold. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleged that the illegal practices were carried out between Dec. 26, 
1987, and April 28, 1988.

<TEXT>
<P>
A 63-year-old woman was killed Thursday when the car in which she was a 
passenger crossed the center divider on California 94 and collided with an 
on-coming pickup truck, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told authorities that the westbound car driven by Linda Chula, 40, 
was traveling at a high speed during the morning rush hour when it crossed into 
the eastbound lanes and was struck broadside by a pickup driven by Patrick 
Simmons, 33, of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Chula's mother, Lillian Marie Haithe of Clairemont, was pronounced dead at the 
scene. Chula and Simmons were taken by Life Flight helicopter to Mercy 
Hospital, where Chula was listed in critical condition and Simmons in serious 
condition late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Coroner George Dickason said Chula reportedly was driving erratically 
before losing control of her car. 
</P>
<P>
The accident forced authorities to close California 94 and divert rush-hour 
traffic onto adjacent streets.

MORE ROAR IN THE O.C. SKY

<TEXT>
<P>
Construction of the new terminal building at Orange County's John Wayne Airport 
is on schedule, and officials say the new terminal will open, as planned, on 
April 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
With the opening of the new terminal in a mere 10 months will come a 
significant increase in daily flights. They will jump from an average of about 
87 per day to somewhere between 115 and 160 per day because the existing 
4.75-million-passenger limit will be increased to 8.4 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
A high-stakes competition is now under way to determine how many of those 
flights will go to each of the nine major airlines presently serving the county 
and the two on the waiting list. The airport staff is completing its 
recommendation, which will be the first reallocation of the airport's access 
plan in five years. The proposed new allocations will be shown to the airlines 
before they are formally presented to the county Airport Commission and Board 
of Supervisors, which is now expected to happen sometime in July. 
</P>
<P>
The new allotment schedule has tremendous financial impact for the carriers as 
well as passengers. Conservative estimates say that each additional flight 
means about $750,000 a year in additional profit for a carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Fares between Orange County and other cities have traditionally been higher 
than those to the same cities from Los Angeles, Ontario or Long Beach, because 
of the high demand and limited number of flights allowed under the legal access 
agreement reached several years ago with Newport Beach. According to airport 
officials, the average fare paid by a passenger at John Wayne is $400. A recent 
nationwide survey set the national average for business travelers, who usually 
pay the most because they less frequently qualify for budget fares, at $290. 
</P>
<P>
John Wayne needs increased competition and more flights to help reduce air 
fares and open new markets and destinations to county residents. Airlines with 
the fewest daily flights, such as United and Alaska, and commercial carriers on 
the waiting list to fly out of John Wayne, which include Southwest and Braniff, 
would like to see the county throw out all the old allocations and start from 
scratch in determining new flight allocations that will probably remain in 
effect for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Present carriers now serving Orange County, like American and USAir, which 
already have the largest number of daily flights, believe that it would be 
unfair to scrap the existing allocation system entirely. Considering their 
investment in quieter aircraft, they present a strong argument for a pro rata 
approach. Some of the basic flights should be redistributed to encourage more 
competition and new markets, but the emphasis must remain on environmental 
issues like noise reduction, and airlines that make the investment in new 
quieter equipment deserve to have more flights than those that do not.

HALO HEAVEN; 
</P>
<P>
NOW THAT ANGELS AREN'T A JOKE, THEY ARE LEARNING TO LAUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If this were last year, you'd probably be reading this on Page 9, back with the 
hair-transplant ads and the Morro Bay fish counts, because by June 1988, the 
Angels were no longer newsworthy. They were history. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty games into their 1988 schedule, the Angels were 19-31, buried in last 
place, already 16 1/2 games behind the Oakland Athletics. Those were the days 
of whines and Rojas, of Junior Noboa and Chico Walker, of 12-4 blowouts, panic 
in the outfield and seeming disarray in the front office. 
</P>
<P>
Funny what 12 months, a change of managers, a change of catchers, two trades, a 
$2.6-million free-agent signing, a reshuffled outfield and some miraculous 
starting pitching can do to a team. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty games into their 1989 schedule, the Angels have the best record in 
baseball: 33-17. No Angel team has ever had a better 50-game start. The only 
one that comes close, the Don Baylor-Rod Carew-Nolan Ryan Angels of 1979, 
didn't log victory No. 33 until June 5. 
</P>
<P>
These Angels have won 23 of their last 30 games, a .767 winning pace. These 
Angels have already thrown 11 shutouts, two more than all of last season. These 
Angels have limited the opposition to two or fewer runs 24 times. 
</P>
<P>
So, what's right with these Angels? 
</P>
<P>
Some play is being given the Angels' schedule, because most of it, so far, has 
featured teams from the American League East. Clearly, this division is no 
longer the old gray nightmare it used to be, what with Milwaukee and New York 
ravaged by injury, Boston suffering the post-Bruce Hurst pitching blues, 
Toronto breaking in a new manager and Detroit playing without its manager. 
</P>
<P>
Catching the depressed AL East at precisely the right time, the Angels are 24-8 
against teams from that division. 
</P>
<P>
Against the West, the Angels are a mere 9-9 -- including a 2-5 fling with 
Oakland. And they have yet to face Minnesota, Texas and Kansas City, which 
opens a three-game series in Anaheim tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The fresh-start theory must also be examined. When the Angels gave one to 
Manager Doug Rader, they, in essence, gave the same to themselves. Whether it 
was the fault of Cookie Rojas or not, Cookie Ball will always be remembered as 
the failed experiment with the rookie manager, culminating in the confusion and 
malaise that resulted in 12 consecutive season-ending defeats. 
</P>
<P>
Symbolically, at least, the hiring of Rader wiped the Angels' slate clean. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the franchise cut several other ties to its past, bringing in two 
new catchers, Lance Parrish and Bill Schroeder; two new starting pitchers, Bert 
Blyleven and Jim Abbott; two new outfielders, Claudell Washington and Dante 
Bichette, and a new left-handed relief pitcher, Bob McClure. 
</P>
<P>
Each of those changes has helped improve the Angels. But, really, when this 
group congregated at training camp in Mesa, Ariz., in late February, who would 
have predicted that by June 1, the following developments would be reality? 
</P>
<P>
The Angels lead the American League in team ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Listen. The shelling has stopped. The 4.52 earned-run average the '88 Angels 
possessed after 50 games has nearly been halved, with the '89 Angels checking 
in at 2.69. 
</P>
<P>
Now check out the individual ERA leaders in the American League. Three of the 
top five wear halos on their caps -- No. 1 Kirk McCaskill at 1.49, No. 2 Chuck 
Finley at 1.83, and No. 5 Blyleven at 2.36. And in the bullpen, McClure at 0.75 
and Greg Minton at 1.14 are both pitching at Twilight Zone paces. 
</P>
<P>
How this has happened has made for lively discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Early on, there was the pitch-inside argument, which credited Parrish and 
Schroeder for altering age-old Angel pitching strategy by calling a more 
aggressive game, thereby indicting the pitch-calling of age-old ex-Angel 
catcher Bob Boone. 
</P>
<P>
Since Sports Illustrated and the Sporting News gave this argument a national 
forum, soon followed by rebuttals by Boone, the subject has become rather 
sticky with the Angels. Already, Rader and McCaskill have had phone 
conversations with Boone to smooth matters over. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the verbal volleying of early May should lend an extra edge to this 
weekend's Boone reunion at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
More conventional, and considerably less controversial, is the 
us-against-the-world argument, which has served to inspire Angel pitchers by 
pitting them against their detractors, of which there were many before the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they looked at it as a challenge," Angel pitching coach Marcel 
Lachemann said. "When we didn't sign (Bruce) Hurst or (Nolan) Ryan during the 
winter, there was an outside perception of 'It's all over.' I think our 
pitchers looked at this as their chance to prove something. 
</P>
<P>
"And, not to take anything away from Hurst or Ryan, because they're both 
outstanding pitchers, but I don't see how they could be doing any better than 
the guys with us now." 
</P>
<P>
In actuality, the Angels' pitching revival has happened for some simple 
reasons. McCaskill is uninjured again. Blyleven is out of the Metrodome. Finley 
has matured. And Abbott has finally lent stability to the No. 5 starting slot. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if only Mike Witt can come around. 
</P>
<P>
Wally Joyner is off to a worse start than he had in 1988 -- and no one has 
noticed. 
</P>
<P>
Popular thought holds that the Angels staggered at the gate in 1988, never to 
be heard from again, because their cleanup hitter, Joyner, got off to a slow 
start. 
</P>
<P>
Now ponder these numbers: 
</P>
<P>
After the first two months of 1988, Joyner was batting .280 with two home runs 
and 19 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
After the first two months of 1989, Joyner is batting .249 with one home run 
and 18 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, what these last two months have proven is that the Angels should 
not, and do not, live by Wally alone. 
</P>
<P>
Slack has been picked up by: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Johnny Ray, who, happy again as the second base starter, drove in 22 runs 
during May after returning from the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Devon White, who has the numbers -- .296, seven home runs, 30 RBIs, 20 
stolen bases -- of which MVP seasons are made. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Claudell Washington, the free-agent addition who has given the Angels 
consistency at .311 and punch, six home runs, at the top of the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chili Davis, still at his best with a bat in his hands, still driving in 
the clutch runs -- 25 RBIs overall. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to hold this lineup down," Finley said. 
</P>
<P>
It has become a more effective lineup, now that Joyner is no longer required to 
hold it up. 
</P>
<P>
The entire Angel outfield, which still includes Davis, has committed but two 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
In April and May of 1988, there was nothing routine about a fly ball to the 
Angel outfield. Ray spent 40 ill-advised games in left field and made five 
errors. White was sidelined after knee surgery and his replacement in center 
field, Chico Walker, was hardly the man. Finally, in right field, there was 
Chili, with nine errors to his name by June 1, destined for a club-record 19 by 
season's end. 
</P>
<P>
If you were an Angel pitcher, would you be demoralized? 
</P>
<P>
Credit the signing of Washington with another assist here. Washington is no 
challenge to White's Gold Glove collection -- he'll still misjudge a ball now 
and then -- but his presence alone has effectively improved a pair of outfield 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has solidified the right-field position -- zero errors in 36 games 
-- while enabling Davis to move to left, where he has significantly narrowed 
his margin for error -- two in 44 games. 
</P>
<P>
Two full months from White has helped, too. In short, White has been his usual 
scintillating self in center. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day, he does something that either amazes you or astounds you," Rader 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher has become the power position in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Another change in the post-Boone era: Home runs from the men behind the plate. 
</P>
<P>
In seven years as the Angels' starting catcher, Boone did not hit more than 
nine home runs in a single season. 
</P>
<P>
In their first two months as Boone's successors, Parrish and Schroeder have 
already combined for 12. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish, regaining his confidence after slipping into his own personal Bermuda 
Triangle in Philadelphia, is batting .273 with seven home runs, including five 
in his last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, whose home-run ratio in Milwaukee, one every 21 at-bats, ranked near 
the top among active catchers, has homered five times in his first 46 at-bats 
as an Angel. 
</P>
<P>
Such a presence cannot be overstated, according to White, particularly in the 
case of Parrish, a cleanup hitter who often bats seventh for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"Lance Parrish is a big man in the lineup," White said. "If something happened 
to anyone up in the order, he'd be the perfect fill-in man." 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, he has done much to fill out the Angel offense. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Rader has fostered peace and prosperity in our time. 
</P>
<P>
Rader continues to puff away on his cancer sticks, but he's still doing his 
damnedest to kick that other habit of his -- his past. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, Rader acknowledges his belief that people are still waiting for that 
first explosion of temper, that first misstep; so publicly, Rader treads very 
carefully. He won't criticize another player or manager or umpire and will 
sidestep any question pointed in that direction. His new mantra seems to be, No 
controversy. No controversy . . . 
</P>
<P>
If that has sometimes made for bland copy, it has also made for a steadier 
course. Said one Angel official: "Doug tempered the (Mark) McLemore-Ray 
situation about as well as anyone could. He saw to it that Abbott wasn't built 
up too much in the spring. And he's defused a lot of potential controversies, 
like whether or not Bichette should make the team." 
</P>
<P>
With help from such veterans as Blyleven, the inveterate prankster, Rader has 
also accomplished the near impossible -- defrosting the Angels' clubhouse. 
Where before the sounds of surliness dominated the atmosphere, practical jokes 
are now played along with loud rock music and players actually seem to be 
enjoying themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Angel baseball has become a laughing matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone says we have a much looser clubhouse," White said. "The people in 
here are like a family now. I only played here two years so I don't know what 
went on before, but it seems like everybody's much closer." 
</P>
<P>
And the reason for that? 
</P>
<P>
"The manager is pretty loose," White said. "He lets you pretty much go out 
there and do who you've got to do. So far, everything's falling just right." 
</P>
<P>
White laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I haven't seen his bad side yet," he said. "I'm not jumping the 
gun, saying he's a great manager or anything. Things have been going right 
since spring training. Nothing bad has happened yet." 
</P>
<P>
The same approach could be applied to the state of the Angels: Things have been 
going right since spring training. Let us wait. The first slump has yet to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
When it does, how the Angels respond and recover will tell a lot about their 
chances of continuing to push the A's for the division title. But until then, 
the Angels have to be satisfied with whatever small steps of progress they have 
managed to take. 
</P>
<P>
At last, they're front-page news again. 
</P>

MAI CUTS CASH, ADDS SECURITIES TO BID FOR PRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six months into its hostile takeover bid for Prime Computer, MAI Basic Four 
Inc. on Thursday lowered its $1.3-billion bid for the company by offering 25% 
less cash and adding securities. 
</P>
<P>
The new package carries a total cash value of $965.7 million and includes the 
disclosure of the names of four investment firms providing MAI's financing, 
something the Tustin-based computer firm seems to have had difficulty securing. 
</P>
<P>
On May 15, Prime's chairman, David J. Dunn, challenged MAI in a public letter 
to get its financing in order for the proposed $20-a-share offer by today. If 
it did, he said, Prime would not invoke anti-takeover measures. 
</P>
<P>
"We were asked where the financing was, and now we're saying here it is," said 
William B. Patton, MAI's president. 
</P>
<P>
Patton attributed the revised offer to Prime's recent projections of lower 
revenue, plus new and costly Prime employee benefit and pension plans. MAI 
originally offered to pay $20 a share in cash for all of Prime's common stock 
and also for certain options and debt securities that could be converted into 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
MAI is now offering $19.50 a share in cash only for the 49.5 million shares of 
Prime common stock outstanding. If holders of options and debt securities 
exercise their conversion rights, increasing the number of shares outstanding, 
the amount of cash paid per share would decline to as little as $14.65 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Any difference between the final cash price and the stated offer of $19.50 a 
share would be made up with new MAI bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at Prime would not comment on the new offer until after they meet to 
discuss it. However, Prime spokesman Joe Gavaghan termed the bonds "of 
questionable value." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offer Expires June 14 
</P>
<P>
The new offer expires June 14, the date of Prime's annual meeting, where a 
proxy fight is expected over MAI's proposed slate of directors. The companies 
financing the bid and the amounts they are committing are: Drexel Burnham 
Lambert Group Inc., $550 million; Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, $400 
million; Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., $300 million, and Brooke Partners, $150 
million. The excess cash raised would be used to refinance existing debt at 
both companies. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry analysts were also not enthused about the lower bid. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a borderline fair price, but I don't think it's a good price," said 
Charles Foundyller, president of Daratech Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., marketing 
research firm. 
</P>
<P>
Prime's stock closed Thursday at $16.625 a share, up 25 cents from Wednesday's 
close. Only a month ago, when MAI's offer of $20 a share was pending, Prime's 
stock was trading at $19.50 a share. On Feb. 2, it had hit $21 a share. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'In the Best Interests' 
</P>
<P>
Barry J. Tarasoff, an industry analyst with Wertheim Schroder brokerage in New 
York, said he thinks "it's in the best interests of Prime shareholders to 
accept the deal." 
</P>
<P>
"When Prime threw down the gauntlet a few weeks ago, that was a signal to MAI 
that Prime didn't have a higher bid," he said. MAI could afford to lower the 
bid without worrying about serious competition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
By late Wednesday, about 67.5% of Prime's stock had been tendered to MAI, which 
already owns about 2.4% of the company. Patton said those shareholders who 
tendered shares will be notified of the new offer and will have the right to 
withdraw. He predicted, however, that MAI will end up with even more tenders. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday's reduced offer could affect the credibility of MAI's chairman, 
Bennett S. LeBow, a New York financier who has spearheaded the takeover 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"You tender your shares and you kind of expect the guy to keep the deal," 
Foundyller said. "The lower price might lower stockholder opinion of LeBow. 
They may think that once he takes control, he may change the rules again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MAI'S 7-MONTH BATTLE TO ACQUIRE PRIME 
</P>
<P>
November, 1988: MAI Basic Four Inc., a Tustin-based computer manufacturing and 
service company, launches a hostile takeover bid for Prime Computer Inc. MAI 
offers $20 a share for Prime, a much larger minicomputer maker with 
headquarters in Natick, Mass. Prime, declaring the offer too low, strongly 
resists the takeover attempt. 
</P>
<P>
December: U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone in Boston issues an injunction 
barring the MAI bid until the company can provide additional details about its 
financing of the offer. In turn, MAI objects to Prime's poison-pill 
anti-takeover plans in Chancery Court in Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
March, 1989: MAI begins a proxy fight to replace Prime's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
May: Judge Mazzone lifts the injunction blocking MAI's offer. The same day, 
Prime Chairman David J. Dunn challenges MAI by declaring he will sell the 
company if MAI can come up with the $1.3 billion by June 2. 
</P>
<P>
June: MAI reduces its offer for Prime Computer by 50 cents, to $19.50 per 
share. The reason, according to MAI Chairman Bennett S. LeBow, is Prime's lower 
earnings.

NO CURRENT WORKERS LINKED TO PROBE, AMERICAN STORES BELIEVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A spokesman for American Stores said Thursday that the company has no reason to 
believe that any current employees are the subject of an investigation of 
insider trading related to its purchase last year of Lucky Stores. 
</P>
<P>
Troy D'Ambrosio said American Stores cooperated with a Securities and Exchange 
Commission investigation of insider trading that resulted in civil charges 
against a former Alpha Beta employee and his father. American Stores owns La 
Habra-based Alpha Beta. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC "is not doing any further investigation at this point, as far as I 
know," D'Ambrosio said. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC charged in a civil suit filed Wednesday that David Hellberg learned of 
American Stores' plans to buy Lucky Stores while a financial specialist for 
Alpha Beta and passed the confidential information to his father in March, 
1988. The suit, filed in Los Angeles, charges that Gerald Hellberg used the 
information to gain $328,844 in illegal stock profits. 
</P>
<P>
American Stores purchased Lucky last year for $2.5 billion, although its plans 
to merge Lucky with Alpha Beta have been stalled in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
David Hellberg's attorney, Douglas E. Griffith of Salt Lake City, said Thursday 
that his client voluntarily resigned May 31, 1988, from his job as manager of 
special projects in the Alpha Beta finance department because of the SEC 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
He said Hellberg, who lived in El Toro last year, now works in the accounting 
department of an unidentified small company in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith said David Hellberg "absolutely" did not tip his father to the planned 
purchase of Lucky Stores. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Hellberg, 59, a resident of Salt Lake City, is a retired stockbroker who 
"always had an interest in food corporations" -- particularly after his son got 
into the business, Griffith said. "He used the brokerage business to follow his 
investments . . . and obviously did well." 
</P>
<P>
But "we vigorously deny any disclosure. The whole circumstance is a fluke," the 
lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
David Hellberg, 31, "was extremely loyal and devoted" to American Stores, where 
he began working as a corporate jet pilot while still a college student, 
Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
He resigned from the company because he "hoped the SEC's interest would subside 
and that it would be in American's best interest to step back until (the 
investigation) had run its course," Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Hellberg said this week that he believes that the case is without merit 
and that he will fight the charges. His lawyer declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Although formal answers to the SEC's lawsuit are not due for 20 days, Griffith 
said he is considering asking that the case be moved to Salt Lake City. 
American Stores is relocating its corporate headquarters from Irvine to Salt 
Lake City, and Griffith said many of the witnesses are there. The SEC is 
expected to oppose transferring the case. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit asks for the $328,844 in alleged illegal profits, plus civil 
penalties of up to three times that amount from each defendant.

CORPORATE STRATEGIES AIM TO CATCH 'AGE WAVE'; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH-CARE, OTHER INDUSTRIES REALIZE THERE'S GOLD IN THEM THAR OLD FOLKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

BALTIMORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Investing for one's old age is always a good idea. But investing in the aging 
of the nation as a whole can mean big profits. 
</P>
<P>
If projections are correct, the current "age wave" in this country is just a 
ripple compared to what is coming. More than 75 million Americans who helped 
make up the '60s generation are approaching a different sort of 60s decade. 
</P>
<P>
Although the typical horizon of U.S. business tends to be measured in years 
rather than decades, companies catering to the graying masses are proliferating 
as the realization grows that this wave of older Americans is building. 
</P>
<P>
Few industries are as securely assured of a piece of the market as the health 
field. The figures behind the industry's growth are staggering. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 million Americans are older than 65 -- more than the total 
population of Canada. The fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population is 85 
and older. And within 30 years, nearly one in four Americans will be at least 
65. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficulty Keeping Pace 
</P>
<P>
Economists estimate that a 100-bed nursing home would have to be built every 
day for the next 40 years just to keep pace with demand. The amount spent in 
this country each year on personal health care -- which excludes money spent on 
research and the like -- is expected to reach $1.4 trillion in the year 2000, 
up from $443 billion in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
And nearly all segments of the health-care and medical fields are expected to 
take part in the explosive rate of growth. 
</P>
<P>
How does an investor, then, take advantage of these burgeoning industries? 
Carefully, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one doubts that these goods and services will be needed in the year 
2012 -- when the first of the baby-boom generation pass the age of 65 -- few 
know where the money will come from to pay for the medical care. 
</P>
<P>
"The elderly represent about one-third of health-care spending," said Gerard 
Anderson, director of Johns Hopkins Center for Hospital Finance &amp; 
Management. "Of course it's a significant impetus (for business). But it's 
unclear whether Medicare and the Social Security programs will have any money 
to cover them in 2010 or 2020." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Government Share to Increase 
</P>
<P>
The federal government picks up slightly more than one-fourth of the amount 
spent in this country on personal health care each year through Medicare and 
Medicaid payments. That figure is expected to increase to nearly one-third, or 
$460 billion, of total medical costs by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, however, there will be just two workers paying into the nation's 
coffers for each Medicare recipient, instead of the current four workers per 
recipient, according to estimates from the Health Care Financing 
Administration, the federal agency that runs the Medicare program. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts warn that there is a race of sorts taking place in the industry. New 
and expensive medical technology, which is blamed for much of the skyrocketing 
cost of health care, also has the potential to reverse that trend. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately," said Jonathan W. Osgood, a health-care analyst at the Baltimore 
investment firm of Alex. Brown &amp; Sons, "the answer to the health-care cost 
spiral is technology -- technology that actually results in prevention (of 
illnesses), rather than just treatment. But will we be able to afford the 
advances in technology until it gets that far?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investors Optimistic 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, investors appear to be optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent conference sponsored by Alex. Brown in Baltimore, dozens of 
companies in the health-care and biotechnology fields gathered to present to 
potential shareholders and other industry executives the science and products 
that are changing the face of health care. Participants described the mood of 
those attending as showing "a renewed interest" and "upbeat." 
</P>
<P>
Although the fate of just a handful of the companies was tied directly to the 
elderly, virtually everyone realized that the aging population would increase 
the markets for their products. And in turn, those executives can thank the 
growing markets for persuading others to invest in their companies. 
</P>
<P>
Few companies attending the conference did not have at least one product that 
would be used predominantly by the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Synergen Inc. of Boulder, Colo., discussed its research into new drugs for 
arthritis and emphysema. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diagnostic Tests Developed 
</P>
<P>
Centocor Inc. of Malvern, Pa., is developing diagnostic tests for a range of 
cancers and for hardening of the arteries. 
</P>
<P>
Privately held U.S. Bioscience in Blue Bell, Pa., a 2-year-old spinoff of U.S. 
Healthcare Inc., has developed a drug for the treatment of breast cancer, 
particularly prevalent in post-menopausal women. 
</P>
<P>
Marion Laboratories Inc. discussed Cardizem, the largest-selling cardiovascular 
drug in the United States. Cardizem is used to treat angina and hypertension 
and is being evaluated for other cardiovascular problems. 
</P>
<P>
And Athena Neurosciences Inc., a private company in South San Francisco, is 
developing diagnostic and therapeutic products for Alzheimer's disease. "It's a 
sobering thought that probably 10 to 15 people in this room today will succumb 
to this disease someday," the company's president and chief executive, John 
Groom, told the 100 or so people in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
The nursing-home industry is perhaps the most striking example of both the 
potential growth and financial uncertainties facing the health field. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Elderly as an Untapped Market' 
</P>
<P>
"At one time," said Deborah Cloud, spokeswoman for the American Assn. of Homes 
for the Aging, a group representing not-for-profit nursing homes, "the 
nonprofits were about the only ones interested in care for older people, 
because it wasn't perceived as a lucrative market for commercial businesses. 
Now, almost any commercial enterprise that sees the elderly as an untapped 
market are trying to tap them." 
</P>
<P>
There are about 1.5 million nursing-home beds in this country, according to the 
American Health Care Assn. (AHCA) in Washington. That figure is expected to 
more than double in the next few decades. 
</P>
<P>
While that sort of demand, under normal circumstances, would mean unbridled 
expansion and profits, analysts said, the current financial position of the 
industry has been slipping for years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the industry peaked, with an average pretax income of 7.4% of 
revenues, according to an AHCA economist. The ratio slipped in 1987, when the 
industry lost an amount equal to 1.6% of total revenue. And last year was even 
worse, the group said, and stock prices sagged. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the industry has total revenue of more than $40 billion each year, and 
that figure is expected to triple by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coverage Shifted 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act that took effect this year, 
government reimbursements for nursing home care have increased substantially, 
as many elderly nursing home patients are now covered by Medicare rather than 
Medicaid, which principally targets the poor. 
</P>
<P>
A recent report from Prudential-Bache Securities said: "With Medicare revenues 
reimbursed on a cost basis and running about double Medicaid payments -- and 
about 20% to 25% higher than private fees -- we see major revenue and income 
benefits to many in the industry." 
</P>
<P>
Among those poised to take advantage of the good news is Manor Care Inc. of 
Silver Spring, Md. The company, with 157 homes with 21,000 beds across the 
country, has added two dozen new facilities in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Manor Care intends to open between eight to 10 new homes annually, representing 
1,200 to 1,400 beds, in the next few years, said James A. MacCutcheon, the 
company's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
"There is very little substitute for this service," he said. "What is it that 
is going to keep people out of nursing homes? There really is not a whole lot. 
There is always going to be a need for skilled nursing care." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Marriott Pushes Into Industry 
</P>
<P>
Marriott Corp. apparently shares that view. The company began pushing into the 
long-term care industry in 1987 after extensive market research. 
</P>
<P>
The company, through its Marriott Senior Living Services division, now manages 
more than 2,000 beds in nine facilities. Eight new projects are either under 
way or planned, including one community at Fort Belvoir, Va., for retired Army 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
Brian C. Swinton, vice president of product development, sales and marketing 
for Marriott Senior Living unit, said the company recognized that the people 
filling Marriott's large chain of hotels would eventually need lodging of 
another kind. 
</P>
<P>
He said the company's thinking went like this: "All of a sudden -- wait a 
minute -- what we really have to do is cater to the older population. That is a 
natural extension of what we do well."

LABATT WIDENS EUROPEAN DRIVE BY MOVING INTO ITALIAN MARKET 
</P>

<P>
Canada's Labatt Brewing Co. Ltd., fresh from breaking into the British beer 
market, Thursday elbowed its way into traditionally wine-drinking Italy with 
the purchase of a 70% stake in Birra Moretti SpA. 
</P>
<P>
"Italy is a growth market. Most of the other European markets are not growing," 
said Sid Oland, president of Labatt Brewing. "We will be the third-largest 
brewer in Italy with 10% of the market." 
</P>
<P>
Oland would not say how much his company, Canada's largest brewer, had paid for 
the controlling stake in Moretti, but industry analysts put the cost as high as 
$80 million U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Oland said the remaining 30% of Moretti, based in Udine, will be held by the 
Moretti family and the company will continue to be managed by Luigi Menazzi 
Moretti, its president. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement, Moretti, which makes a premium beer, has itself taken 
over Bologna-based Prinz Brau, Italy's sixth-largest brewer, which, in Oland's 
words, makes a "bargain basement brand." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fraction of Labatt Sales 
</P>
<P>
Oland estimated the combined sales of Moretti and Prinz Brau at around $80 
million, a small fraction of Labatt's 1988 sales of $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Neil Wickham at Canarim Investment Corp. Ltd., guessing at the price 
Labatt paid for Moretti, said, "It's probably not more than a dollar in costs 
for a dollar in sales."

RAVI SHANKAR'S 3RD MUSICAL LIFE SUITS HIM BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long before his association with George Harrison of the Beatles gave him the 
status of a cult superstar, sitarist Ravi Shankar had made a name for himself 
-- and for Indian music in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Shankar, who makes his local debut today at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, had begun promoting Indian music in this country in 1956. "For 10 
years," he said, "I established myself -- as well as Indian music -- on a very 
healthy ground, in the sense I was playing full houses at Carnegie Hall or the 
Royal Festival Hall in London. I was very well known." 
</P>
<P>
But when Harrison became his student for a short period in 1966, Shankar was 
catapulted into a new arena. 
</P>
<P>
It was a mixed experience, he said: "I was thrown into that situation. It was 
like an explosion of sitar and Indian music, Indian hookahs, incense, 
everything, om, Kamasutra. . . . It was a very superficial period. . . . It 
coincided with the whole hippie movement, the rebellion of the youth and 
Vietnam, and the whole drug culture and everything. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, it was good and bad: Good from the point of view that it brought young 
people just like that. Within a year or so, they were all interested in Indian 
music and Indian philosophy. But it was very superficial because they were not 
ready for it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Because they came from the pop- and rock-appreciating group, they didn't have 
that training of the public who listens to Brahms or Bach. . . . These people, 
they whistled and they were trying to appreciate in the same manner as they 
would go to a rock concert." 
</P>
<P>
Surprised by that reception, he was also startled to find himself being 
attacked on the home front. 
</P>
<P>
"Here I was trying to put my music in the right place, explaining what it is 
all about, the background, the spiritual aspect of it, the whole thing that we 
believe in, and back in India, there was all this anti-propaganda that I was 
selling my music, I was committing sacrilege and becoming a hippie myself!" 
</P>
<P>
It took him several years to come out of that period, as his managers continued 
to book him into arenas and large stadiums. "Because of contracts, I couldn't 
do anything about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now he is again playing in classical music venues. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I am in my third period -- and the best period, I think." 
</P>
<P>
Some of his fans from the hippie era are still coming his concerts. "But the 
whole attitude is so beautiful now, and exactly what it should be," he said. 
"They listen with much more feeling and understanding as well." 
</P>
<P>
Criticism in India has also ended, he said: "That lasted for a few years. But 
now it's over." 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes and no. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy still dogs his heel as he pursues two different directions as 
performer and composer. "Many people get (the two activities) mixed up because 
as a composer I have been experimenting with a lot of things -- with jazz 
musicians, even pop groups, with electronics, anything, symphony orchestra," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people can't accept that or understand that that is an experimental thing 
because when I perform as a soloist, . . . I'm very orthodox, very classical, a 
very pure traditionalist. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But as a composer, I am not afraid to experiment -- for films or orchestra or 
ballet." 
</P>
<P>
Shankar conceded that "Indian music is very difficult to take in immediately," 
but he added that "people who don't have a classical (music) background" can 
respond to it more readily "because they're not regimented in their way of 
appreciation. We dwell in our music mostly on melody and rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
The melodic pattern of the music is called raga; rhythms are arranged in cycles 
called talas. 
</P>
<P>
"Raga cannot be explained in a few words," he said. "Raga is not mere scale, 
it's not a mode. It's not a key. It's not a melody. The nearest way to explain 
raga is 'melody forms.' " 
</P>
<P>
Each raga is based upon one of 72 scales in Indian music. 
</P>
<P>
"It has to have its own ascending and descending structure. It has to have its 
own important notes. It has to have a little motif . . . which we can 
recognize. It's like the face of a man or woman by which, you know, immediately 
we recognize" the person. 
</P>
<P>
Further, each raga has a fixed association of time, such as early or late 
morning, or early or late afternoon. There are even seasonal ragas, such as a 
rainy-season raga. 
</P>
<P>
Why these associations? 
</P>
<P>
"We were so much attuned with nature," Shankar said. "We followed all the moods 
and structures of the light, shade, temperature, everything. 
</P>
<P>
"This (system) has been developed through centuries," he added. "It wasn't done 
in one day." 
</P>
<P>
Shankar said the tradition is "about 1,500 years old" and is an oral tradition: 
"It is not a written-down music. The heart of it is improvisation." 
</P>
<P>
Regarding talas, or "rhythmic cycles," Shankar said that "according to old 
traditions, we have rhythmic styles ranging from three-beat cycles to a 
108-beat cycle." 
</P>
<P>
The most popular cycles are in three-beat form or in even numbers from four to 
16, he said. "But the offbeat talas -- like 9, 11, 13, 15 and, going up, 17, 
19, whatever -- once in a while we perform when we have a small gathering of 
connoisseurs and people who can keep track of what is happening. Otherwise, 
it's no fun." 
</P>
<P>
While the analysis sounds complicated, Shankar has a simple recommendation: 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing is, let go. Try to hear something with a fresh mind and not 
rely on the training that you have. Then it becomes easier, and then after some 
time, it gets you. 
</P>
<P>
"If you try a lot through here," he said, pointing to his head, "it takes a 
little more time, naturally." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitarist Ravi Shankar plays tonight at 8 at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Assisting him will be his son, 
sitarist Shubho Shankar. Kumar Bose will be the tabla player. Tickets: $15 to

2 TRADITIONALISTS PICK UP THE PAST IN GRAND STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a society that has come to revolve around videocassette recorders, personal 
computers and fax machines -- devices virtually unknown even 15 years ago -- 
tradition can easily be perceived as something one step removed from 
fossilization. 
</P>
<P>
But traditions -- at least the lasting ones -- arise because they embody some 
idea or theme that it is important for society to keep in mind. 
</P>
<P>
With Doc Watson and John Hammond sharing the bill, tradition was something to 
ponder Wednesday night at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. Watson, with 
his broad range of Southern folk styles, and Hammond, with his acoustic blues, 
have been high-profile musical traditionalists for more than 25 years. In 
thoroughly engaging, occasionally breathtaking performances, both men showed 
that they perceive tradition as a vibrant, immediate way to express important 
ideas and not some quaint preservation project designed to catalogue and 
salvage some antiquated playing style as a museum piece. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond's blues burrowed deep into the most basic, internal human drives and 
laid them out naked for inspection. In a 70-minute opening set made up of blues 
standards dating back 30 years and more, he sang of sexual need and sexual 
pride, how they develop into a desire that goes beyond the physical and becomes 
love and how losing that love can turn into an identity-shaking agony. The day 
Hammond's brand of blues becomes fossilized is the day music turns to stone. 
</P>
<P>
There aren't many musicians keeping the traditional acoustic blues alive these 
days, but as long as Hammond is around, audiences willing to tap into his 
performances will be able to get a clear idea of the 
</P>
<P>
elemental force and power inherent in the style that was the granddaddy of rock 
'n' roll. When an infant in the audience began wailing in his mother's arms as 
Hammond brought the hard-driving "Ride 'Til I Die" to a climax, the thought 
occurred that this supremely erotic blues might have set off some Oedipal 
awakening. In Hammond's hands, it's easy to see how the primal recordings of 
Robert Johnson, Elmore James and their peers sparked powerful awakenings in the 
likes of John Lennon, Keith Richards and Eric Clapton. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond's set was made up of songs, such as Johnson's "Come On in My Kitchen," 
that he probably has sung thousands of times. But none of them sounded tired or 
routine. The songs dealt with urges and conflicts that have been repeated a 
trillion times since humanity began and Hammond's re-enactments suggested that 
each repetition is unique. 
</P>
<P>
His performances certainly sounded that way. The rhythms of Hammond's singing 
and guitar playing lingered or rushed forward, as unpredictable as the cadences 
of inner thought. On this night, his harmonica playing was especially strong: 
In some memorable passages, the harp tone rose from a low, broad moan to a 
staccato cry. The performance probed deep into the solitary soul, distilled the 
emotions there and pumped them out in a forceful gush. All in all, not a bad 
musical tradition to keep alive in an era when people worry about being able to 
keep in touch with their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
If Hammond's blues delved into the individual psyche, Watson's folk lit a 
pot-bellied stove and invited friends and neighbors to gather 'round and keep 
warm, swap some stories and have a good laugh. It was music drawn from 
America's rural history, and its core concern was the knitting-together of 
community. 
</P>
<P>
In songs such as "Tennessee Stud," about a mythically gifted and spirited horse 
galloping through the dangerous landscape of the pioneer days, and "The Wreck 
of Ol' Number 9," the tragic, romantically stylized ballad of a gallant 
trainman and his true love, Watson spun the kinds of tales that are handed down 
through generations, giving people the common stories and models that glue them 
together. Maybe Joseph Campbell had the official doctorate, but this 
66-year-old Doc from Deep Gap, N.C., is worth heeding, too, when it comes to 
learning about living myth. 
</P>
<P>
Among guitar players, Watson is a living myth. Whether using a flat-pick or, 
less frequently, picking the strings with his fingers, his playing was a marvel 
of dexterity, speed, control and full, satisfying tonality. Watson's younger 
playing partner, a fellow North Carolinian named Jack Lawrence, was no slouch 
either. In a show that emphasized the interplay of guitars, Lawrence's leads 
and accompaniments kept pace and meshed beautifully with Watson's parts. When 
the two guitarists took off on fast tandem runs, it sent a rush of excitement 
through their appreciative audience. Lawrence also was a good harmony singer, 
his smoother, higher vocals lending strong support to Watson's plain-spoken, 
direct singing. (Although he cleared his throat frequently and apologized for 
having difficulty because of a sore throat, Watson's vocals seemed up to par). 
</P>
<P>
Aside from his trainman's tragedy and a gracefully fervent A.P. Carter waltz, 
"Storms On the Ocean," Watson kept his 70-minute set on the light side, 
emphasizing joking songs such as "Smoke, Smoke Smoke (That Cigarette)" and 
delivering a good deal of folksy humor that, because of his winningly homespun 
manner, could be forgiven some of its cornier moments. One or two more ballads 
-- perhaps a rustic horror story like "Shady Grove" -- would have been nice, 
and so might one of Watson's moving renditions of religious hymns. With 
Watson's ability to draw a listener into his circle and bring to life his rural 
themes and settings, there is always a craving for one more story, one more 
scene from a way of life that postwar America has managed largely to dispose of 
while professing to honor it. 
</P>
<P>
When Doc Watson left the stage, the audience was back in contemporary Orange 
County, where the challenge is to stop merely importing traditions for 
one-night stands, and start sewing some valuable ones of our own.

TELETHON FROM DISNEYLAND TO BE SEEN IN CHINA, U.S.S.R. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The annual Children's Miracle Network telethon, to be broadcast live from 
Disneyland for 21 consecutive hours this weekend, will not only be carried by 
stations across the United States but also will be broadcast in the People's 
Republic of China and the Soviet Union. The telethon's organizers believe that 
this is the first time a United States-based telethon will be aired in those 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Since it started in 1983, the telethon has raised $170 million for children's 
hospitals throughout North America. This year the telethon contributions in 
China will be used to build the Sino/American Friendship Children's Hospital in 
Beijing. In the Soviet Union, the telethon will help raise funds for the 200 
children's hospitals throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, Channel 9 will carry the telethon starting Saturday at 6 p.m. Channel 
8 in San Diego will join the broadcast at 7 p.m.

ANN CONWAY: SCHULLER IS A BIG HIT AT HAMMER'S BIRTHDAY BASH 
</P>

<P>
Comedian Danny Thomas may have been the emcee for Dr. Armand Hammer's fancy 
91st birthday bash Sunday, but it was the Rev. Robert H. Schuller who got the 
biggest laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh Lord," the pastor of the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove prayed during 
his invocation at the Beverly Hilton, "please help our dear friend Armand 
Hammer live to be 100. We just have to keep on meeting like this!" 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the first time Schuller has delivered an invocation for Hammer, the 
billionaire philanthropist who is the head of Occidental Petroleum Corp. Last 
year, Schuller gave the invocation at Hammer's very fancy Big Nine-O splash at 
the Watergate Hotel in Washington, having arrived there with the likes of 
Abigail Phillips (Dear Abby), Jane and Jerry Weintraub and Rhonda Fleming on 
Hammer's private 737 jet. 
</P>
<P>
Schuller has been hot on the celebrity inspiration circuit for years. He 
consoled John Wayne as the Duke was waging his war on cancer. He comforted 
Hammer when the industrialist lost his only brother. Last year, he was invited 
by Vice President George Bush to inspire the masses before Bush gave his 
acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. And recently, good 
friend Lucie Arnaz, daughter of Lucille Ball, invited him to give the sermon at 
her mother's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
But although he is often surrounded by worldly glitter and face after adoring 
face -- no less than Helen Hayes and Jimmy Stewart were beaming back at him on 
Sunday -- Schuller's head doesn't seem to be turned. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not so great," he said, taking a break from a lively chat with Danny 
Thomas and Art Linkletter. "It's just that I'm living longer (than they are) 
and meeting more people." 
</P>
<P>
And they adore him. 
</P>
<P>
What's his secret? He moves them, seems to wrap their own thoughts in upbeat 
words and does it without trying to bring them to tears. On Sunday, for 
example, Schuller beseeched "God to bless Dr. Armand Hammer, the world's first 
global entrepreneur . . . the man who knocked the word impossible out of his 
dictionary!" 
</P>
<P>
And, at Miss Ball's funeral in Saint Monica's Catholic Church in Santa Monica, 
he told the small gathering: "She was God's gift to the whole world, because 
she was a gift of humor. And humor is a gift of healing. And a gift of healing 
is a gift of hope. When you laugh, you are being set up for having hope." 
</P>
<P>
Celebrating an Annenberg: The numbers were staggering at the tribute to Wallis 
Annenberg staged at the Beverly Hilton on Wednesday night: 984 guests paying 
$500-per-couple and $650,000 in proceeds. So were the names: Annenberg herself 
(daughter of Walter Annenberg), Jimmy Stewart, Ali McGraw, Steve Allen, Joan 
Rivers . . . 
</P>
<P>
But big benefit numbers have always been the bottom line for Bob and Beverly 
Cohen of Newport Beach, co-chairmen for the past 5 years of the benefit for the 
Sephardic Hebrew Academy in Los Angeles. "Money is the only bottom line," said 
Beverly, glowing in diamonds and a gown paved with black bugle beads. "And we 
give our guests a fabulous party, so we have quite a following." 
</P>
<P>
The dynamic Cohens are newish residents of Newport, having purchased John 
Wayne's old bay-front digs in January for $6.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
And since their move here, the question that weighed heavily on the minds of 
local movers and shakers: When do they plan to bring their fund-raising moxie 
to Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
"We're not sure yet," said Bob, a developer who has half-interest in the Four 
Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills. "I think Beverly could use a rest for a year or 
two." 
</P>
<P>
"But here's what works," Beverly said. "A tribute that is served up before 
</P>
<P>
the main course, so the honoree can sit back and enjoy dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Here's what else worked: the black-tie optional event was a kosher affair, with 
stuffed cabbage rolls, potato knishes and smoked salmon proffered on silver 
trays during the short-but-sweet cocktail hour. The main course: perfectly 
cooked prime rib delivered, steaming hot, on silver trays; and French apple 
cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
The only hitch: seconds before the brocade curtains parted to allow guests to 
stream into the International Ballroom for dinner, Beverly was informed that 
the horseradish had been deemed not kosher by a rabbi in attendance. 
"Whaaaaaat?" Beverly asked the food service director who delivered the bad 
news. "Ask another rabbi," she said. So the director asked another rabbi. He 
said horseradish was kosher. But the other rabbi would not hear of it. "Well," 
Beverly said with a tiny sigh. "We just won't have any then. But, can you 
imagine not having horseradish with prime rib?" Of course not. But with the 
dazzling Cohens oozing their bubbly charm throughout the meal, nobody noticed 
the difference.

HELLO, 'MR. CHIPS'; 
</P>
<P>
CAL STATE PROFESSOR, 74, WAS PRESENT AT BIRTH OF THE CAMPUS, AND IT'S STILL HIS 
BABY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Miles McCarthy insists that he really was going to retire this time. Really. 
Honestly. Truly. This would be it. Lock the doors and turn out the lights. 
Goodby. Sayonara. The man who was present at the creation of Cal State 
Fullerton 30 years ago, who was one of the founders of the university, who has 
a building named for himself -- this man says he was ready to walk away. 
</P>
<P>
Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy, 74, was there this week in the classroom and he will be there next 
week and in weeks to come, teaching a course on heredity to people who need the 
class to get their schoolteacher's certification. Then in the fall, when he 
could be indulging his twin loves of sailing and gardening, he will be teaching 
again, this time lecturing an embryology class for a colleague who asked his 
help. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, it always comes back to the teaching. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy has been chairman of the school's biology department, dean of what 
then was called the School of Letters, Arts and Sciences, vice president for 
academic affairs, even acting president in 1981 while the school awaited the 
arrival of its new president, Jewel Plummer Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
But whenever he could, he has always managed to teach. 
</P>
<P>
"The only year I haven't taught . . . ever since I got out of school, was the 
year I played president," he said. "I just couldn't manage it. All the time I 
was vice president (four years) I taught six units every semester. . . . I 
lived for those six hours." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy has been teaching for more than half a century. For those of a certain 
age, he is referred to on campus as "our Mr. Chips." For those a bit younger, 
like his students, he is known as a good teacher and a first-rate adviser. 
</P>
<P>
An energetic man whose foot keeps bobbing up and down during an interview, who 
smiles frequently and often laughs aloud, McCarthy takes special pride in the 
Health Professions Committee, a group of 10 professors who work with students 
to prepare them for admittance to medical, dental or other schools that train 
health professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the committee, which McCarthy established, has had remarkable 
success. McCarthy said that in an average year, between 20 and 30 students will 
be recommended to a medical or dental school. Most years, nearly every student 
recommended is accepted. An idea of what the competition is like can be gleaned 
from the UC Irvine Medical School, where each year more than 3,000 students 
apply for about 90 openings. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy attributes the committee's success to being careful in its selection 
and following up to make sure that the students do well after getting into 
school. Another reason, he said, is that many students who plan to go to 
medical school after graduation switch to new dreams as the college years go 
by. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of kids who want to go to professional school have no (legitimate) 
reason," McCarthy said. "They look at (the television show) 'MASH,' or their 
dad tells them, or their Aunt Tillie. So they really don't want to go, 
basically, but they can't admit this." 
</P>
<P>
The committee, however, is more than willing to tell a student with poor grades 
that he has no chance of getting into medical school. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people who will tell you -- and I always hesitate to deal with these 
people -- 'God has ordained me to be a physician.' I mean, there are people who 
really believe that. And they are very difficult. They might be straight C 
students, and no way are they going to get into professional school." 
</P>
<P>
But overall, McCarthy said, "I really think and hope (that students) are 
getting better," especially those planning on medical careers. 
</P>
<P>
He said that most doctors indicated that they chose medicine "to make money, to 
gain power, gain prestige in the community and to serve people. And I maintain 
that's the wrong order." But he said that today's premed students seem to be 
putting service to patients first, as they should. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy said doctors of the future won't make money the way they once did, 
pointing to attempts by corporations, insurance companies and consumer groups 
to put a lid on the cost of medical care. As a result, would-be doctors "have 
to be committed to serving people," he added. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy himself sits on the Admissions Committee to the UCI Medical School and 
is able to help Cal State Fullerton students by using his personal friendships 
with officials of medical schools across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Three of his former students are now medical school deans, and he jokes, "That 
doesn't hurt either, because you can call them up and say, 'Hey, you know, this 
kid's better than you were.' " 
</P>
<P>
When he attends a convention of the Assn. of American Medical Colleges, he 
makes a point of visiting medical schools in the area, taking along copies of 
the Cal State Fullerton curriculum and promoting the school's program. 
</P>
<P>
Once, during a year's sabbatical, he piled his wife and two children in a van 
and drove across the country, visiting all the professional health care schools 
he could find. 
</P>
<P>
He figures that of 127 medical schools nationwide that would accept Cal State 
students (some schools limit admissions to residents of their own state or have 
other restrictions), he has personally visited 80. "So I built up a good 
rapport with a good many out-of-state schools, and that's very helpful." 
</P>
<P>
One former student from McCarthy's teaching days at Pomona College is Dr. 
Robert E. Tranquada, dean of the USC Medical School. Tranquada calls McCarthy 
"a terrific guy" and "an excellent teacher." 
</P>
<P>
"He had then and always has had a very deep and real interest in his students," 
Tranquada said. "He's an unusual man who sees his role as teacher as greater 
than imparting knowledge, but also being a real associate and counselor to his 
students." Tranquada said that McCarthy treats his pupils as "associates" in 
the learning process, rather than someone dispensing knowledge from above. 
</P>
<P>
Tranquada said that while medical school admissions committees pay close 
attention to a student's marks in college and scores on medical school 
admissions tests, recommendations from committees such as McCarthy's "play a 
significant part in admissions." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy's road to Fullerton began in Pennsylvania, where in 1936 he received a 
bachelor of science degree from what is now West Chester State College. He 
applied to the University of Pennsylvania, planning to study physiology there. 
Instead, "lo and behold, I got accepted to medical school." 
</P>
<P>
He stayed there for seven years, teaching zoology and obtaining a Ph.D. in the 
research and treatment of burns but not bothering to get a medical degree. He 
jokes that he regrets the omission now and then: "When I walk out of (UCI) 
Medical School with my colleagues down there and they get into their fancy toys 
and I still drive a 10-year-old Volkswagen, I say, 'There's something wrong 
here.' " 
</P>
<P>
And yet: "They remind me every once in a while, 'You know, you love what you 
do, and we're bored to death.' " 
</P>
<P>
In 1946, a supervisor at the University of Pennsylvania asked McCarthy if he 
had ever considered teaching at the college level and if he had ever heard of a 
college in California called Pomona. The answer to both questions was "no." But 
when the boss said Pomona was a good place and needed a teacher, McCarthy went 
to the library to do some research, learning that "it did exist and it was a 
decent place." 
</P>
<P>
Looking around him in Pennsylvania and seeing men who were still assistant 
professors at age 50 and 55, McCarthy decided to check out Pomona. "I liked 
what I saw. And they offered me a job. I came." 
</P>
<P>
He stayed for 13 years, becoming head of the zoology department, doing more 
research and sending students off to medical schools across the country -- 
right up until the day that William Langsdorf called. 
</P>
<P>
Langsdorf, a former president of Pasadena City College, had been named first 
president of what was originally known as Orange County State College but 
quickly became Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill Langsdorf called me . . . to ask me if I was interested in coming over to 
start a state college," McCarthy said. "I remember we had lunch down at Cocos, 
down there on Commonwealth Avenue and Euclid. We talked and talked . . . and 
finally I said, 'Well, just what do we have to work with?' 
</P>
<P>
"He said, very matter of factly, 'Right now, all we've got is a state car and a 
couple of fountain pens.' " 
</P>
<P>
Still, McCarthy went with Langsdorf to a hill nearby to view the campus. What 
they saw was "nothing but orange groves in all directions. . . . And he said, 
'There it is.' And I said, 'Where?' And he said, 'Where the orange groves are.' 
So that was my first introduction to campus." 
</P>
<P>
When he went home, McCarthy said, he told his wife that he had turned Langsdorf 
down. "My wife was brighter than I was. She said, 'You know, you don't start an 
institution every day.' " So the next morning he called Langsdorf back and 
said, "Can I come over to talk some more? So indeed, that's how I came to be 
here." 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't much there in the early days. Four buildings, in fact, one of 
which McCarthy commandeered. For his research, at one house he turned the back 
porch into a rat colony and the kitchen into a veterinary surgery lab. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy said that he, Langsdorf and the others who started the school wanted 
to provide the kind of education available at good private schools such as 
Pomona, Occidental and Whittier for students without the money to attend those 
schools. They also wanted "as much as possible to personalize the education, 
try to treat the students as persons and not motives," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As the university has grown (it now has more than 20,000 students), some of the 
personalized contact has been lost, McCarthy conceded. Yet, students who have 
him as an adviser say that he is there when they need him. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Love, a 21-year-old junior biology major hoping to become a veterinarian, 
said that McCarthy is knowledgeable in various scientific fields and keeps 
current with various schools' admission requirements. "He knows what courses 
you should take" to be accepted by graduate schools, Love said, and steers 
students toward those courses. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb, the university president, called McCarthy "undoubtedly the best-loved 
person in the history" of Cal State Fullerton. "His most remarkable quality is 
that he genuinely cares about others," she said, and his first concern is his 
students. McCarthy said he "retired" twice from the school, but "I actually 
never left." Once, back around his 65th birthday, "I went to a retirement 
dinner. I got one of those mugs, all that kind of business." He wound up coming 
back to teach, though, when the school asked him to. The second time he nearly 
retired was when he hit age 70, but again he opted to stay in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy, the father of five -- all of them grown -- and the husband of Martha, 
a human resources analyst for the city of Santa Ana, gives no indication of 
when he might hang up his academic robes for good. In September of 1984, Cal 
State officials changed the name of the Science Building to McCarthy Hall. It 
was only the second time in the campus' history that a building was named after 
a person (the first was Langsdorf Hall). 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's still the Science Building," he said with a laugh, even as he 
remembers a student telling him how nice it was to see a building named for 
"someone who's alive." 
</P>
<P>
He walks past the building every day to reach his office and sees his name 
prominently displayed there. "It's embarrassing," he says offhandedly, "as well 
as a very nice feeling."

State schools Supt. Bill Honig issued a negative report card last week to 
Channel One, a controversial, satellite-delivered television show that 
introduces commercials to the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"Our students' minds aren't for sale," Honig said in Anaheim as he announced 
that public schools would not be allowed to collect state money for time that 
students spend watching the program. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Tennessee-based Whittle Communications introduced Channel One's pilot 
project in five high schools and one junior high throughout the nation, 
including Gahr High School in Cerritos. The five-week program ended last month. 
Whittle planned to expand the program to 8,000 schools nationally if it proved 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
Honig said, however, that his department has examined the legal and ethical 
merits of Channel One and decided that it constitutes "forced commercialization 
in school." 
</P>
<P>
He said Channel One does not qualify as an "educational activity" and therefore 
is inconsistent "with the purpose for which schools are established." 
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, it's a bad deal for kids, a bad deal for education, and it sets 
a terrible precedent," Honig said. 
</P>
<P>
If California public schools choose to take the program, Honig said, they would 
be docked state money commensurate with the total number of hours that students 
view the show. 
</P>
<P>
Whittle Communications' 12-minute program, viewed daily in the pilot project, 
was an international news show with enthusiastic young announcers. It was the 
two minutes of commercials -- for products such as Snickers candy bars, Levi's 
jeans and Gillette razors -- that concerned educators. MARIA NEWMAN Times staff

Five county schools received National Secondary Recognition Awards or 
Distinguished School Awards, the U.S. Department of Education recently 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
The awards are based on the general excellence of the schools. 
</P>
<P>
The five are Fullerton, Irvine, Los Alamitos and Mission Viejo high schools and 
McFadden Intermediate School in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, 176 schools earned the recognition awards, including 24 in 
California. Only one other California county, Santa Clara, had as many 
award-winning schools as did Orange County.

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: READING AND SIGNING BY 3 PACIFIC WRITERS PRESS 
CONTRIBUTORS TO BE AT UCI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A reading and book-signing by Pacific Writers Press authors David Nava Monreal, 
George Coleman and Jo-Ann Mapson will be held from 3:30 to 5:30 p.m. Wednesday 
at the UC Irvine Bookstore in the Marketplace Shopping Center on Campus Drive 
across from UCI. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Writers Press, a small, UCI-based independent press "concerned with 
publishing quality manuscripts," was co-founded in 1987 by novelist Alejandro 
Morales, a UCI professor of Spanish, and Robert Boies, assistant principal at 
Tustin High School. 
</P>
<P>
The press' first book, published in 1988, was Monreal's "The New Neighbor and 
Other Stories," ($7.95) a collection of short stories that examine the 
California life style from the Latino point of view. In his work, the El Toro 
writer explores issues ranging from street gangs and AIDS to the struggle for 
acceptance and the desire to preserve Latino culture. 
</P>
<P>
The latest book is Coleman's "Into the Storm: A Vietnam Odyssey" ($9.95), a 
collection of poems that chronicle the Princeton, N.J., writer's life after 
high school graduation, through the Vietnam War, and home again where he must 
make the difficult transition from soldier to civilian. John Carlos Rowe, a UCI 
professor of comparative literature, wrote the preface. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, Pacific Writers Press will publish "Fault Line," a collection of 
short stories by Mapson, a Costa Mesa resident who has been praised by one 
reviewer for extracting "the living moment from ordinary scenes, writing about 
love, family, death and sex with a frank and refreshing empathy." 
</P>
<P>
Monreal said the purpose of Pacific Writers Press is "to publish quality 
writers who are not published in the major houses." 
</P>
<P>
"We're another outlet for good literature," said Morales, who has had four 
novels published, including "The Brick People," which was published in 1988 by 
Arte Publico Press of the University of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a dream of mine to help writers and I think Bob (Boies) is the same. 
He is an avid reader and lover of literature," said Morales. "I think there are 
so many writers out there who are very good writers but don't have access to 
the big presses. Getting published nowadays is very, very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Pacific Writers Press prints 1,000 paperback copies of each book. 
"The New Neighbor and Other Stories" and "Into the Storm" are available at the 
UCI bookstore, at independent bookstores throughout Orange County and by mail 
from Pacific Writers Press. For information, call the department of Spanish and 
Portuguese at (714) 856-6901. 
</P>
<P>
Morales said UCI provides some funding to help pay for Pacific Writers Press' 
administrative and printing costs but the majority comes from him and Boies. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied with the way we're going, but we want to get bigger," Morales 
said. "It's always a problem of finances. I'd like to be able to hire someone 
who could come in with us as a partner and do a lot of the administrative work 
with the press. I myself like to read the manuscripts and identify the 
writers." 
</P>
<P>
Morales said he and Boies would like to publish three to four books a year -- 
novels, short story collections and collections of essays on current issues. 
Depending on how well the first three books do, he said, they also plan to 
print 500 hardback and 1,500 paperback copies of each future title and now are 
looking into distributing the books nationally through a small press 
distributor. 
</P>
<P>
Writers interested in submitting their work are asked to send an inquiry letter 
describing their manuscripts to Pacific Writers Press, Department of Spanish 
and Portuguese, UC Irvine, Irvine, Calif. 92717. 
</P>
<P>
Book Signings: Douglas Muir of Newport Beach will sign his latest thriller, 
"The Midnight Admirals," from 1 to 4 p.m. Saturday at Brentano's in South Coast 
Plaza, Costa Mesa. . . . Janice Lovoos and Gordon McClelland will sign "Phil 
Dike," their book about the renowned Southern California artist, from 3 to 5 
p.m. Sunday at Upchurch-Brown Booksellers, 384 Forest Ave., Laguna Beach. . . . 
A.E. Maxwell ("The Art of Survival") and E.C. Ward ("A Nice Little Beach Town") 
will sign their books from 7 to 9 p.m. June 14, at Rizzoli International 
Bookstore in South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Chicano Contest: The winning entries in UCI's 15th annual Chicano Literary 
Contest were saluted during a recent awards ceremony in the Santa Ana City Hall 
Annex. Tom Lugo, a UCI student, won an honorable mention in the poetry category 
for "Mexican Ascent of the Academic Shreckhorn."

<P>
Tens of thousands of troops surged to within 200 yards of Tian An Men Square 
today in an apparent move against pro-democracy students but were pushed back 
by protesters who blocked the road. 
</P>
<P>
The troops, apparently unarmed but carrying backpacks and flashlights, advanced 
down Changan Avenue, the capital's main street. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of students and citizens poured onto the street to stop the soldiers 
in front of the Beijing Hotel, several hundred yards east of the square. 
Citizens backing the students blockaded the avenue with four trucks. 
</P>
<P>
There was some pushing and shoving between the troops and students, but the 
soldiers, mostly young men, did not appear to be armed. At one point, 50 
soldiers linked arms and tried to break through but were pushed back. 
</P>
<P>
Tired-looking troops then retreated along the sidewalk six abreast as the crowd 
yelled, "The People's Liberation Army loves the people!" 
</P>
<P>
The middle of the square, where students have been camped out for three weeks, 
remained calm. The "Ode to Joy" of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony blared over the 
student loudspeakers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Carried Radios 
</P>
<P>
A convoy of 15 trucks also advanced from the west but was stopped by crowds two 
miles from the square, students reported. They said 10 truckloads of troops 
entered the Great Hall of the People on the square's west side about midnight. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers wore boots and white shirts but no jackets with rank insignia were 
seen, witnesses said. Many carried radios strapped to their backs. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate indication of troops advancing on the square from other 
directions. Up to 200,000 troops are reported camped around the city. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, 1,000 helmeted soldiers had jogged near Tian An Men Square, 
the symbolic heart of China, in another government ploy to intimidate the 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Those troops ran out of a nearby train station and through the surrounding 
neighborhood before they returned to their camp, about a mile from the square. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters have been staging anti-government protests in defiance of 
martial law orders to leave. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Copies of Paper Burned 
</P>
<P>
Also today, 500 students burned copies of the official Beijing Daily outside 
the paper's building to vent their anger over the increased government 
condemnation of the democratic reform movement in communist China. 
</P>
<P>
The students were particularly incensed by an article in Thursday's edition 
claiming dissension among different factions directing the movement. 
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Daily, which is controlled by the city Communist Party, is known 
for its hard-line views. 
</P>
<P>
This is the third straight day that troops have appeared on city streets, 
reinforcing government pronouncements that the army was poised to carry out 
Premier Li Peng's order of martial law for Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
The students, who have gained considerable support from ordinary citizens, are 
demanding more democracy, an end to corruption among officials, and a dialogue 
with the government. Beijing citizens blocked troops from entering the city 
after Li declared martial law on May 20.

CRASH, TRUCK FIRE IN LAGUNA HILLS BACKS UP I-5 TRAFFIC FOR 20 MILES

<P>
Traffic along the southbound lanes of the San Diego Freeway was jammed for 
about 20 miles at 7 a.m. today in the aftermath of a collision and truck fire 
five hours earlier in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
According to the California Highway Patrol, the lengthy cleanup of the 2 a.m. 
accident near the Alicia Parkway exit of Interstate 5 had traffic backed up for 
about 11 miles to the Costa Mesa Freeway by 6 a.m., and all the way to the 
Garden Grove Freeway interchange by 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
CHP spokesman Ken Daily said the accident occurred near Alicia Parkway when 
Ramon Jose Bernardo, 34, of San Diego, driving a two-axle truck similar to a 
moving van, drifted off the freeway's right lane and onto the shoulder. There, 
Robert Lawrence Prible, 39, of San Clemente was working under the hood of his 
1968 Buick. 
</P>
<P>
Prible sustained minor injuries when the truck collided with his car. The crash 
caused the truck's right fuel tank to rupture and burst into flames. By the 
time firefighters arrived, the vehicle was fully involved and had spilled 
burning fuel into a storm drain. 
</P>
<P>
The cleanup required shutting down the southbound side of the freeway to the 1 
and 2 lanes for several hours. Workers cleared the scene at 7:42 a.m., but the 
residual backup from the accident continued throughout the morning commute 
hours.

The Ministers Fellowship of the San Fernando Valley renewed its endorsement of

improve their community. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Bernardi, he's an antique -- he knows what's been going on in the 
community," said the Rev. James Wade of Universal Church of the Valley in 
Pacoima. "He cannot be replaced by an adolescent." 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, 77, was forced into a Tuesday runoff election by city Fire Capt. Lyle 
Hall, 49. The ministers group, which represents 47 religious leaders from the 
east Valley, had also endorsed Bernardi in the primary.

UNO APPROVED AS JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER

<P>
Parliament today approved Sosuke Uno as prime minister, and he pledged reforms 
to clear the air of an influence-peddling scandal that has decimated the top 
ranks of the governing Liberal Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
The 66-year-old former foreign minister also spoke out against the United 
States, saying Washington's use of its new trade law to force concessions from 
Japan was "like negotiating with your fists up." 
</P>
<P>
The conservative party also got new leaders, and Uno chose a new Cabinet in a 
bid to wipe the slate clean of the Recruit influence-buying scandal before 
elections for half the upper house of Parliament, expected within two months. 
</P>
<P>
The scandal surfaced a year ago, ruined many careers and forced Prime Minister 
Noboru Takeshita, 65, to resign and take responsibility for a widespread loss 
of trust in politics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Voting Breakdown 
</P>
<P>
The two houses of Parliament met separately today and selected Uno as Japan's 
18th postwar prime minister on the strength of the Liberal Democrats' 
majorities in each chamber. 
</P>
<P>
In the lower house, Uno got 285 of 477 votes, with Japan Socialist Party 
Chairwoman Takako Doi receiving 139, Eiichi Nagasue of the Democratic Socialist 
Party 26 and Kenji Miyamoto of the Communist Party 25. Two votes were ruled 
invalid. 
</P>
<P>
The upper house gave Uno 124 of 220 votes, with Doi capturing 65, Miyamoto 17 
and Nagasue 9. Five ballots were blank, officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said Uno will follow his predecessor's policies toward the United 
States but will not soften his tough response to Washington's designation of 
Japan as a potential target of U.S. trade sanctions for supercomputers, 
satellites and lumber. 
</P>
<P>
"Uno is behind no one in appreciating the importance of U.S.-Japan relations," 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe told reporters.

The state's portion of the "pedway" is nine inches lower than the city's

The engineering gaffe carries a $309,669 price tag, which the city says it will 
pick up despite claiming that the state is to blame.

A Coast Guard jet spotted the 50-foot Haitian sailboat St. Nicholas, which was

Several of the Haitians threatened officers on the Coast Guard cutters with 
knives and machetes, the Coast Guard said. The captain of the boat and several

immigration officials were airlifted to the scene and talked the men out of 
dropping the babies into the water.

TENNECO TO PAY $5 MILLION FOR WASTE OF NATURAL GAS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tenneco Inc. will pay the federal government $5 million to settle allegations 
it violated the law by destroying 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 
trying to hide the action, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Tenneco was making the payment today at the Interior Department's New Orleans 
office, and federal officials called it one of the largest of its kind ever 
collected. The government agreed not to seek criminal prosecution, civil 
penalties or cancellation of Tenneco's federal lease. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a matter of cheating the American people, first by wasting an 
important natural resource and second by not paying America for using it," said 
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. in a statement from Washington. "We will 
not tolerate this kind of behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Tenneco agreed to the settlement after investigators for the Interior 
Department's Minerals Management Service and office of inspector general 
discovered more than 300 incidents of unauthorized venting of natural gas at 
offshore drilling platforms in areas owned by the federal government and leased 
to Tenneco. 
</P>
<P>
According to the department, more than 1 billion cubic feet of gas was lost 
through flaring, a process by which unwanted fuel is burned off. Tenneco was 
accused of burning the gas because prices at the time were too low to make it 
profitable to bring the gas to shore and it was easier for Tenneco then to pump 
more lucrative oil reserves from the offshore properties.

Developers today announced they would build an office building on stilts to 
preserve the remains of the 16th-Century Rose Theater, where William 
Shakespeare is believed to have debuted as an actor. 
</P>
<P>
But protesters who have waged a campaign to save the partly excavated theater 
condemned the plan as "worse than expected." 
</P>
<P>
The 10-story office building would stand 22 feet above the Elizabethan 
theater's remains and be supported by steel girders, the developers said. The 
theater's remains would be on view from entrances on three sides of the office 
building, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The government-approved plan for the site south of the Thames River would cost 
$15.8 million more than the initial plan and would reduce some office and 
parking space, the developers said.

The nation's unemployment rate dipped to 5.2% in May, but -- in a sure sign of 
a slowing economy -- job growth fell to its lowest level in more than three 
years, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate, taken from the Labor Department's monthly household survey, 
fell 0.1 percentage point from April's 5.3%, in line with the expectations of 
analysts. 
</P>
<P>
But non-farm payroll growth, taken from a separate survey of business 
establishments, was up by only 101,000, down from April's revised growth of 
206,000 jobs. The May growth was the lowest month-to-month gain since 84,000 
added payroll positions were reported in March, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
For the last three months, an average of only 160,000 jobs have been added to 
non-farm payrolls each month, down from the robust average monthly gain of 
270,000 jobs reported in 1987 and 1988.

"The great American jobs machine is cranking down to a more moderate pace," 
said economist Allen Sinai of Boston Co. Economic Advisers Inc. "But the 
economy does not appear to be headed near-term for a recession." 
</P>
<P>
Several analysts said after the release of the report today that the data -- 
which included some signs of moderating inflation -- would give the Federal 
Reserve some justification for easing its tight rein on credit, but all agreed 
such a move was far from certain. 
</P>
<P>
"For a divided Fed it's a tough call," Sinai said. 
</P>
<P>
In data that will be hailed by those looking for signs of easing inflation, 
average hourly wages inched up only 0.1% in May following a 0.7% increase for 
April. Average weekly earnings fell from April's $335.04 to $332.51. 
</P>
<P>
The consensus among analysts had been that about 220,000 jobs would be added to 
the nation's economy, more than double the number reported by the government. 
</P>
<P>
Such projections have led analysts to predict that the economy will show too 
much strength for the Federal Reserve to ease its tight rein on credit. But the 
sluggishness demonstrated by today's report will likely increase pressure on 
the central bank to relax monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Service-Producing Industries 
</P>
<P>
The service-producing industries again accounted for the overwhelming job 
growth, adding 134,000 jobs to help offset some of the declines in other 
economic sectors. But even that number was well down from a revised April gain 
of nearly 190,000 new service-producing jobs and well off the sector's 250,000 
monthly average gain last year. 
</P>
<P>
In that service sector, transportation and retail and wholesale trade posted 
job gains but were well below their 1988 averages. 
</P>
<P>
Goods-producing industries reported a net loss of 33,000 jobs, with mining down 
slightly and construction employment off by 14,000 positions. Manufacturing 
operations reported a loss of 18,000 jobs from April. 
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate dipped despite the slow job growth because, the 
government said, the civilian labor force fell by 49,000 people to 123.6 
million. That indicated the influx of students into the summer labor force, 
generally seen in May or June, did not occur in any great number last month.

The Buick division of General Motors Corp. today extended its buyer incentive 
program until July 10, after moves by several other GM divisions and auto 
makers who hope that such lures will stimulate vehicle sales in the warmer 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Buick's program, which had been scheduled to end June 5, offers $500 back on 
1989-model Skylark, Skyhawk and Century cars, and rebates ranging from $500 to 
$1,500 on Regal, Le Sabre, Electra and certain Park Avenue cars. 
</P>
<P>
Like most of GM's vehicle divisions, Buick is also offering in lieu of cash 
rebates low-rate financing, which ranges from 2.9% on 24-month loans to 9.9% on 
60-month loans.

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp has refused to take himself 
out of the running for the job of National Football League commissioner, 
according to a published report today. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Washington Times, Kemp said he spoke Sunday with 
retiring NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle, who asked him if he was interested in 
the job. Kemp told the newspaper that the conversation was not a concrete 
offer, but he refused several times to respond directly when asked if he would 
reject the job if offered. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp, the former quarterback for the Buffalo Bills and San Diego Chargers, said 
he turned down an interview with Rozelle's "headhunters," referring to the 
executive search company the league hired to help find a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would reject the job if offered, Kemp replied, "Are you trying to 
stick a pencil in my ear?" Asked to elaborate, he said, "It means I'm thrilled 
to be doing what I'm doing and to be in the Bush Administration."

Defending champion Steffi Graf, playing through a steady drizzle, eased her way 
into the fourth round of the French Open tennis championships today, beating 
Nicole Jagerman of the Netherlands 6-1, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Seventh-seeded American Tim Mayotte, who resumed play today after his 
second-round match was suspended by darkness Thursday, was upset by Ronald 
Agenor of Haiti, 3-6, 7-5, 5-7, 7-5, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Boris Becker's bid for a fourth-round spot in the men's event was delayed by 
rain today. But after a 5 1/2-hour wait, the second-seeded West German resumed 
his match against qualifier Jeremy Bates and crushed the Briton 7-5, 6-1, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible when you have to wait like that. It's almost like in England," 
Becker said. "But for me, I guess the rain was pretty good. Until then, I was 
too defensive." 
</P>
<P>
The showers had the opposite effect on Mayotte, a grass-court expert playing on 
his least favorite surface. He was leading Agenor, two sets to one, and was at 
3-3 in the fourth set when the match was suspended. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Best Played on Clay' 
</P>
<P>
Agenor, ranked 30th in the world, who proved the stronger when the match 
finally was resumed today. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, he played almost picture perfect tennis," Mayotte said. "He made 
passing shots, lobs and serves that he didn't do yesterday. I'm obviously 
disappointed, but it's the best I've played on clay." 
</P>
<P>
Unseeded Jay Berger of Plantation, Fla., reached the fourth round as he whipped 
Jaime Yzaga of Peru 6-4, 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
And Spain's Conchita Martinez, seeded eighth, joined Graf in the same stage of 
the women's event by rolling over Sophie Amiach of France 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, the defending women's titlist, took exactly one hour on Center Court to 
overpower Jagerman, and has now dropped only six games in three matches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cold, Gray Gloom 
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Grand Slam champion had one or two rare lapses, such as when 
she was broken at love in the sixth game of the second set, but was generally a 
class above her opponent. 
</P>
<P>
After four days of sunshine, the temperature dropped considerably at Roland 
Garros and the stadium was enveloped in a cold, gray gloom. 
</P>
<P>
"It was awfully cold. I tried to finish it as soon as possible," the top-seeded 
Graf said. "I was very lucky to play first, before the rain. At the end, it was 
very hard." 
</P>
<P>
Graf's match was played in persistent drizzle, and as soon as it was over 
officials covered the Center Court with a tarpaulin to protect the clay. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the rain delay, officials postponed a number of key matches for 24 
hours, hoping for an improvement in the weather Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The matches between Jimmy Arias and Stefan Edberg, Nicole Provis and Gabriela 
Sabatini, Jacob Hlasek and Leonardo Lavalle and Alberto Mancini and Paul 
Haarhuis all were held over until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In another rain-interrupted match completed this evening, No. 16 Guillermo 
Perez-Roldan of Argentina beat Italy's Francesco Cancellotti 7-6, 2-6, 7-5, 
4-6, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's field, No. 10 Helen Kelesi of Canada defeated Gretchen Magers of 
the United States 6-4, 2-6, 6-3.

Lou Whitaker struck a blow for every little guy who ever aspired to play ball 
when he hit eight home runs in May. 
</P>
<P>
Whitaker now has 13 for the season, one more than he hit in his first four 
years in the major leagues. He was tied with Baltimore's Terry Tettleton for 
the American League lead going into today's game between the Tigers and 
Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a strong little guy and he's got a great body," Detroit interim manager 
Dick Tracewski said. "And he's getting bigger. When he first got here, Lou 
weighed 150 pounds soaking wet. Now he's up to about 175." 
</P>
<P>
For most of his career, Whitaker has been a leadoff hitter. This year, he's 
hitting No. 3 and seeing pitches he can hit with authority. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to be big to hit home runs," Whitaker said. "Joe Morgan already 
proved that, and Hank Aaron was little when he first started, too. You just 
need a quick bat. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned what I want to do when I'm at the plate. I've always been a 
patient hitter, my walks show that. Now, I just look for the right pitch in the 
right situation." 
</P>
<P>
"Lou's always had good bat-speed and that's a key regardless whether you're big 
or small," said shortstop Alan Trammell. "He's getting the head of the bat out 
in the strike zone and boom, he's popping some long ones." 
</P>
<P>
As his power has increased, however, Whitaker's batting average has slipped, 
dropping for four consecutive seasons after he hit .320 in 1983.

John McEnroe could be ruled out of a Wimbledon warm-up event for sidestepping 
the rules of the Men's Tennis Council, according to the head of the sport's 
governing body. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe was hoping for three full weeks of grass-court play before going into 
Wimbledon June 26. But the American, who cited a back ailment for withdrawing 
from the French Open, may not be allowed to start his Wimbledon preparation at 
next week's Beckenham, England, tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Beckenham clashes with the second week of the French Open and the head of the 
Men's Tennis Council said McEnroe would be breaking the rules if he competed. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a rule preventing players competing in another tournament which is 
being played at the same time as the one they have already pulled out of," said 
Council Administrator Marshall Happer in New York. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe has asked for permission for the rule to be waived.

Tuesday a rider and a sidecar-team member were killed in separate crashes
