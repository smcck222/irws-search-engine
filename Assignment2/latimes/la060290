AIR DISTRICT JOINS CRITICISM OF UTILITIES' MERGER PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Los Angeles air quality officials have added their voices to the chorus arguing 
that smog in Southern California will get much worse if Southern California 
Edison merges with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed merger "has the potential to generate significant adverse air 
quality impacts" in the South Coast Air Basin as a result of Edison's plan to 
shift electric power generating from San Diego to the Los Angeles area, the 
South Coast Air Quality Management District said in a letter to the state 
Public Utilities Commission dated Monday and released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD reached its conclusions while commenting on the PUC's draft 
environmental impact report, which was prepared as part of the PUC's 
deliberations on the proposed $2.5-billion merger. The AQMD joins several other 
critics, including the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District, the 
city of San Diego, state Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp and pollution control 
officers in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles air-quality district also questioned the adequacy of the PUC's 
environmental report -- especially the conclusion that the merger would result 
in net reductions of smog in Southern California. Last month, the San Diego air 
district filed testimony with the PUC that raised similar questions. The 
district will file a formal response next week to the draft environmental 
impact report. 
</P>
<P>
"Net emissions increases will occur in three of the four air basins analyzed, 
with the most significant increases occurring in the South Coast Air Basin," 
wrote Barry R. Wallerstein, the AQMD's director of planning. That basin 
includes Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties and the urban portions of 
San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD called for further study of the merger's air-quality effects, 
including possibly the preparation of a supplemental environmental impact 
report, said Jack Broadbent, the agency's planning manager. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that the EIR does not adequately address the air-quality impacts in a 
number of areas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed merger, Edison would shift generation of electricity from 
older San Diego power plants to more efficient Edison plants in the Los Angeles 
area. However, some San Diegans fear that Edison will attempt to reduce smog in 
the Los Angeles area by increasing use of SDG&amp;E's gas and oil-burning power 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
"In a nutshell, the major problem with the EIR is that it underestimates the 
cost of eliminating the added pollution that would be caused by the merger," 
said Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers Action Network, a 
San Diego-based consumer group. "That significantly reduces the merger savings 
(for customers) claimed by the utilities." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Edison sent its own letter to the PUC this week, arguing that the 
EIR overstated the air and water effects of the proposed merger. Edison added 
that any effects could be overcome "at a cost that will not appreciably 
diminish the financial benefits of the merger." The EIR estimated that it would 
cost about $65 million to mitigate the effects, a figure Edison disputes. 
</P>
<P>
"As we have previously said, we are talking with the (South Coast Air Quality 
Management) district, and we are quite confident we can reach an agreement with 
the district," Edison spokesman Lewis M. Phelps said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In its comments, the AQMD specifically cited concerns over possible increases 
in the levels of nitrogen oxide, a precursor of ozone in smog, and sulfur 
oxide, another pollutant. Los Angeles is the only area in the nation that still 
violates federal standards for nitrogen oxide, the district said. 
</P>
<P>
Edison's electrical generating plants are already the single largest producers 
of nitrogen oxides in the South Coast Air Basin. 
</P>
<P>
Increased smog in Los Angeles is a serious concern for San Diegans because smog 
blown into San Diego County from Los Angeles' air basin was responsible for 41 
of the 55 days last year when San Diego was in violation of federal ozone 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
When the draft environmental impact report was released in April, Paul Downey, 
a spokesman for San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor, said, "This has long been a 
fight for local control over our utility's future. Basically, San Diego would 
be subjected to the whims of (Edison's) bureaucrats sitting up in Rosemead. 
It's saying, 'If L.A. has a smoggy day, so will we.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-area pollution control agency's letter about environmental 
impacts of the proposed merger was similar to comments made in April by Rich 
Sommerville, San Diego County's air pollution control officer. 
</P>
<P>
Sommerville, who was not available for comment Friday, previously said that he 
was "skeptical of (Edison's) assumption that it can shift energy generation to 
the heavily polluted Los Angeles Basin. . . . The scenario that the South Coast 
Air Quality Management District will allow more emissions and make their air 
more polluted just doesn't wash." 
</P>
<P>
The period for comment on the draft expired this week; the PUC is aiming at a 
ruling on the merger by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Preparation of a supplement to the report, as proposed by the South Coast AQMD, 
could delay the process several more months.

A HARD LESSON: WATER, CHILDREN DON'T MIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
Kevin Wood Jr. was down to one egg. 
</P>
<P>
An Easter egg hunter of enormous talent, he searched and searched -- and then 
pounced. 
</P>
<P>
He had it. He smiled. His basket was full. He was as content as a 2-year-old 
can be. 
</P>
<P>
Two minutes later, he was nearly dead. 
</P>
<P>
His uncles and aunts found him floating face down in the pool, his body an ugly 
blue, bobbing just out of reach of the tennis ball he had chased into the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
"He was only out of sight for a few moments," said his father, Kevin Wood, a 
Marine sergeant whose voice cracked as he spoke. "He was always laughing, full 
of life, getting into things." 
</P>
<P>
The mean season for children and water is under way. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen San Diego-area children who had nearly drowned or had drowned have 
been taken to Children's Hospital this year -- 13 in March and April alone -- 
and local health officials have begun the annual summer campaign to promote 
water safety and cardiopulmonary resuscitation lessons. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, juvenile drownings decreased slightly in recent years, but 
the death rate is up early this year, according to the county medical 
examiner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Six area children under age 14 have drowned so far in 1990, compared with 8 
deaths in 1989, 12 in 1988, 18 in 1987, and 15 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The number of children who nearly drown each year -- many of whom suffer 
permanent brain or lung damage -- was not available, but it is estimated that 
for every drowning, 10 children are hospitalized from water incidents. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is children should never be left alone -- for even a few 
seconds -- around any water," said Mark Morelli, a spokesman for Children's 
Hospital, which treats the more severe cases. Last year the hospital handled 52 
children who had drowned or nearly drowned. 
</P>
<P>
Area hospitals and other groups will conduct safety programs and classes this 
summer at schools, parks, beaches and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, an average of 330 children drown and an additional 4,200 nearly 
drown each year, according to the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer Products Safety Commission. Most are male and between the ages of 12 
months and 35 months. 
</P>
<P>
Family back-yard pools account for 65% of the drownings. More than 
three-fourths of the victims were seen in the house by an adult less than five 
minutes before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"I can give you all the statistics you want, but the point is that anybody with 
a pool must be committed to vigilance (in supervising children)," said Jack 
Eden, a spokesman for the federal safety commission. "It can happen to anyone. 
Turn your back for a moment. Parents better believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Drowning in residential pools remains the leading cause of death among children 
under age 5 in California, one of only four states where water kills more 
children than fire, according to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
"These accidents have happened in pools, spas, bathtubs, buckets, but they are 
preventable," Morelli said. "We have to convince parents that it can happen to 
anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Most drownings and near drownings occur when a child falls into a pool or spa 
or is left alone in a bath tub, according to health authorities. Infants can 
drown in an inch of water. An 11-month-old Vista baby drowned in April after 
falling head-first into a bucket of water. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Michelle Sallee of Chula Vista left her 13-month-old daughter 
Brittany in a few inches of water in the bathtub for 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"She was face down when I came back," Sallee said. "She wasn't breathing. Her 
lips were blue. I threw her on the floor and started CPR." 
</P>
<P>
Brittany suffered no permanent damage, but the experience convinced Sallee to 
encourage other young mothers to be especially watchful around water. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought nothing like that can happen to my baby, but it was just like that," 
Sallee said, snapping her fingers. 
</P>
<P>
Water safety tips include: 
</P>
<P>
* Never leave children alone around water, even those who have taken swimming 
lessons. 
</P>
<P>
* Never rely on flotation devices. 
</P>
<P>
* Keep pool and spa areas locked. 
</P>
<P>
* Teach children water safety habits, including no pushing, dunking or diving 
into unknown bodies of water. 
</P>
<P>
* Enroll children older than 3 in swimming lessons. 
</P>
<P>
* Learn CPR. 
</P>
<P>
* Teach children how to dial the 911 emergency phone number. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said the Wood family's situation involved the two most 
common factors in child drowning or near drownings: Adults were present and the 
child was out of sight for only moments. 
</P>
<P>
"His aunt had him by the hand and they started to go into the house," said 
Wood, 31, of Escondido. "He follows her like a puppy and she assumed he 
followed her into the house, but he slipped away for only a couple minutes. 
That's all it took." 
</P>
<P>
Young Kevin is in critical condition in the intensive care unit at Children's 
Hospital. He apparently escaped brain damage, but he contracted pneumonia and 
remains on a ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
It is too soon to know if Kevin suffered permanent respiratory damage or when 
he might breathe without the ventilator, said Dr. Bradley Peterson, director of 
the hospital's intensive care unit. 
</P>
<P>
"It can take weeks, months, before we know," Peterson said. "The waiting is the 
hardest part for the parents. They go through hell." 
</P>
<P>
Wood and his wife, Myrna, visit their son nightly. 
</P>
<P>
"The waiting is frustrating. We feel helpless," Wood said. "Like my wife says, 
she has a real heavy heart." 
</P>
<P>
Wood urged other parents to heed the warnings about children and water. 
</P>
<P>
"You know the old saying: It only happens to the other guy. Well, it happened 
to us. I want to tell parents it's a lot easier to put up a fence around the 
pool than stand over your child in the ICU and watch him fight for his life." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said the degree of permanent neurological and respiratory damage 
caused by nearly drowning depends on several factors, including the temperature 
of the water, how long the heart and blood flow are stopped and whether any 
vomit expelled with swallowed water enters the lungs. 
</P>
<P>
Colder water slows the chemical reactions in human tissue, allowing a person to 
survive for an extended period with little or no oxygen, and vomit exposes the 
sensitive lung tissue to infections, Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Most drownings occur before children reach age 4 and develop a minimum of 
swimming ability and a greater sense of knowing when to avoid water, Peterson 
added. 
</P>
<P>
"The dangerous time is when they learn to walk and they go exploring," he said. 
"They can get into paint buckets, mop buckets, drainage ditches, duck ponds. 
Anything."

WATER USE DECLINES 22% ON 'CONSERVATION DAY'; 
</P>
<P>
DROUGHT: L.A. COUNCIL MEMBER SAYS FIGURE SHOWS THAT CITY DOESN'T NEED MANDATORY 
CUTS. BUT MAYOR COUNTERS THAT A ONE-DAY EFFORT AFTER A STORM ISN'T ENOUGH. 
</P>

Water consumption in Los Angeles dropped by 22% compared to last year during 
this week's "Water Conservation Day," demonstrating what one council member 
characterized Friday as a willingness by residents to save water without 
mandatory rationing. 
</P>
<P>
Kicking off the daylong conservation effort Thursday, Councilwoman Joan Milke 
Flores suggested that the city's water users "send a message" to the City 
Council by saving water and thereby bolster her efforts to keep conservation 
efforts voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on (the) results, I believe that Los Angeles residents have demonstrated 
their willingness to conserve," Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Department of Water and Power, overall water consumption 
dropped by 153 million gallons -- or 22% -- Thursday, compared to the last 
Thursday of May, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But water use climbed by 24 million gallons, or 4%, from this Wednesday to 
Thursday, something that Flores' spokeswoman Karen Constine attributed to 
"average daily fluctuations." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Flores conceded that a storm earlier in the week helped cut water 
consumption by reducing the need for outdoor watering. Also, records show 
temperatures were an average six degrees lower Thursday than a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
If the mandatory rationing program proposed by Mayor Tom Bradley is approved, a 
10% reduction will be required from 1986 levels. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said that despite the drop in water use Thursday, a mandatory program 
is needed because consumers would "revert to old habits" without daily media 
attention surrounding events such as "Water Conservation Day." 
</P>
<P>
"It's ludicrous to make a decision about the future of the city and the supply 
of our water based on statistics from one day -- particularly when that day was 
unseasonably cool, and front lawns throughout Los Angeles were still damp from 
an unusual late-May rainstorm," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the council's Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources Committee, 
which Flores chairs, gave conditional approval to the mayor's plan and sent it 
to the full council for a hearing June 15. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said she would ask the council to hold off imposing the mandatory 
program if forthcoming statistics from the DWP show water users have cut 
consumption by 7% or more during the current 2-year-old voluntary program. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, meanwhile, has asked the city administrative office to conduct a study 
to determine if the 9% rate hike that is set to take effect if the rationing 
program were approved is needed to offset increased costs.

BASHFUL HERO PULLS MOTHER, UNCLE FROM FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When flames broke out in his Chula Vista home early Friday, 17-year-old Manuel 
Cole knocked down two doors to rescue his mother and uncle minutes before the 
fire engulfed the house. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody was injured in the blaze, and his brother and neighbors are calling 
Manuel a hero for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel said he believes a cigarette started the fire in the master bedroom 
occupied by his mother, Marina Gallegos. When Manuel heard his mother 
screaming, he tried to enter the room, but the door was locked. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked under the door and saw the reflection of the flames," he said. "I 
knocked the door down with my shoulder. . . . When I got it open, I noticed the 
bed was on fire, so I pulled her out." 
</P>
<P>
Manuel said he hit the door "at least seven times" before it broke open. After 
leading his mother outside, he re-entered the home to get his uncle, Frank 
Gallegos, who also lived in the house. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't breathe, so I had to go out and come back in because the smoke was 
too thick," Manuel said. After a breath of fresh air, he broke down his uncle's 
door and led him to safety. He entered again for the last time in a futile 
attempt to douse the fire with the bathroom shower hose. The only possessions 
Manuel said he saved were the clothes he was wearing and his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, his brother, Ricardo Cole, 16, had awakened by the noise and was at 
a neighbor's house telephoning for help. 
</P>
<P>
The Chula Vista Fire Department responded to the call at 1:20 a.m., Capt. 
George Smith said. The fire, in the 1600 block of Banner Avenue, spread rapidly 
and was extinguished by 1:50 p.m., he said. Damage was estimated at $150,000 to 
the home and $6,000 to two cars in the driveway. Three dogs died in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
When the Fire Department "got there, fire was coming out of all the front 
windows and the front door," Smith said. The building was a "total loss." 
</P>
<P>
The incident is under investigation as "suspicious," which means arson is 
probably not the cause of the fire, but it has not been ruled out, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe it was caused by smoking materials," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gonzalez, 12, said he saw the blaze from his home, two houses away on 
Zenith Street. His grandmother, Jenny Gonzalez, also called the Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
"I opened the door and looked out and saw the flames, and I said, 'Oh my God,"' 
Robert said. 
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Cole said he doubts that his uncle would have survived if Manuel had 
not helped him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think so, because my uncle sleeps a lot and sleeps with the radio on," 
Ricardo said. "Something blew up. In five minutes, everything was up (in 
flames). It went up fast. We were fixing the house, we had new furniture, and 
it just went up." 
</P>
<P>
Manuel said that, during the rescue, he was "worried, but not scared." 
</P>
<P>
For now, the family is living with neighbors. Manuel, a student at Castle Park 
High School, said that, in a few days, he will go live with friends in Tijuana 
until his family's life returns to normal. 
</P>
<P>
He bashfully told his story as he wandered through the charred shell of the 
house. Singed oranges hung overhead on a tree and a partly melted dirt bike lay 
on the patio. Friends and his brother, Ricardo, encouraged him to claim credit 
for his heroism, but he refused. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel skipped school Friday but went to work as usual in the afternoon, 
selling flowers on the street. Being a hero was one of the last things on his 
mind, at least until he was reminded of it by friends, neighbors and the media.

home early Friday morning, 17-year-old Manuel Cole came to the rescue of his

before the fire engulfed the house. Family and neighbors are calling Cole a 
hero, but he shrugs off the praise.

RARE-COIN THEFT CASE CONTINUED TO JUNE 25; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: LAWYERS FOR A CORONADO HEART SURGEON ACCUSED OF THEFT BY A PRESTIGIOUS 
MANHATTAN COIN SOCIETY ARE STILL NEGOTIATING A PLEA-BARGAIN STANCE. 
</P>

<P>
Plea-bargain negotiations continue in the case of Coronado heart surgeon Dr. 
Juan Suros XII, who has been charged by New York authorities with stealing more 
than $1 million in rare coins from a prestigious Manhattan coin society. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing Friday in New York State Supreme Court, the case against Suros, 
48, was continued until June 25, when both sides are expected to agree on a 
plea. 
</P>
<P>
Suros, who also uses the name Juan XII, Count of Besalu, was charged with grand 
larceny and possession of stolen property last September after allegedly 
stealing about 71 coins, mostly rare Spanish and Mexican ones, from the 
American Numismatic Society's Manhattan offices. If convicted, Suros faces 25 
years in a New York prison. 
</P>
<P>
Don Birnbaum, Suros' New York attorney, declined to comment on the case except 
to say that "further discussions are ongoing." 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Montealegre, spokeswoman for the New York district attorney's office, 
said Tuesday that the two sides have been negotiating a plea bargain for 
several months. A trial date could be set June 25 if an agreement is not 
reached by then, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Suros, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was born in Spain. He was graduated from the 
University of Barcelona. Widely known as an able heart surgeon, Suros has an 
office in Chula Vista and a home on Isabella Avenue in Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
According to reports in New York City newspapers, Suros told police in a 
videotaped interview that he stole the coins because he "loved them and had to 
have them." Investigators said Suros planned to add the stolen coins to his 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
All of the coins were recovered, some of them in Suros' home and office, 
including a gold Roman coin from 134-138 A.D., six gold Visigoth coins minted 
between 586 and 609 A.D., and six 18th-Century coins and medals from Spain and 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
New York police said the thefts occurred between December, 1988, and April, 
1989. Society officials told investigators that coins would mysteriously 
disappear every time Suros handled coin trays. As a member and contributor to 
the society, Suros was allowed to handle the rare coins. 
</P>
<P>
Suros was arrested April 15, 1989, in his room at the Harvard Club in 
Manhattan, where police said they recovered 13 of the stolen coins. His arrest 
came hours before he was scheduled to receive an award from the society at the 
Knickerbocker Club. Suros was among several benefactors who were feted for 
their financial contributions to the society's endowment. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan S. Maiman, one of Suros' attorneys, said last year that his client had 
contributed more than $100,000 to the society. He joined the organization in 
1984.

Photo, Smogbusters: At Unocal's recycled auto project at 26th Street and Long 
Beach Avenue in Los Angeles, old smog makers line up to be stripped and 
squashed. Under the program, which began Friday, Unocal will pay owners of 
7,000 vehicles with the model year 1970 and earlier $700 per car for 
demolition. So far, nearly 6,000 appointments have been made. The first to go 
was Dick Rossman's 1964 Cadillac. For a year he had been trying to sell the car 
-- with 311,000 miles on it -- for $250, and Unocal's offer was one he couldn't 
refuse. At right, Jose Flores empties the oil before the Caddy succumbs. IRIS

ELECTIONS: 38TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
WILCOX TAKES INSURER FUNDS AFTER SEEKING DONATION BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Assembly candidate Rob Wilcox, who pledged two months ago not to take campaign 
contributions from insurance companies, has received $1,900 this year from 
insurance agents, a Van Nuys insurance brokerage firm and the owner of a 
Woodland Hills insurance agency, campaign records show. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox made the promise in a code of ethics he urged four other Republicans to 
sign in their race to succeed retiring Assemblywoman Marian La Follette 
(R-Northridge) in the 38th Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
In a March 29 letter, Wilcox called on the other candidates to refuse to accept 
insurance contributions "until the insurance crisis is solved." 
</P>
<P>
"The insurance crisis has gone unsolved because the Legislature has been 
beholden to those special interests . . . . It is time for those candidates who 
believe in returning ethics in public service to join me in this major step for 
ethics and integrity," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox, a La Follette aide who has her endorsement, defended his acceptance of 
the contributions, saying they came from individual insurance agents, not large 
insurance companies such as State Farm or Allstate. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that local agents in the San Fernando Valley qualify as 
insurance companies . . . . These are by no means insurance companies and 
certainly not what I was referring to in my pledge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilcox's GOP competitors were quick to attack him Friday for accepting the 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a little hypocritical of him to conduct himself as he has," 
attorney Bob Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
"He challenged everyone else not to accept insurance contributions, and he has, 
as far as I can see, ended up breaking his vow. I guess he felt it was OK to 
change horses in the middle of the stream. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Real estate broker Paula Boland said the insurance money "shows to me a lack of 
integrity." 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox and Boland are considered the front-runners to win the 38th Assembly 
District seat, which La Follette has held for 10 years. The district stretches 
across the northern Valley from Hidden Hills in the west to La Crescenta in the 
east. 
</P>
<P>
Two Democrats, Irene Allert and Gary Crandall, are competing for their party's 
nomination. But Republicans outnumber Democrats in the district 86,000 to 
74,000, and the GOP nominee is favored to win the November general election. 
</P>
<P>
In a state-mandated campaign finance report filed last month, Wilcox listed 
five contributions totaling $1,900 from donors engaged in insurance sales. 
</P>
<P>
The contributions were: $250 from Advanced Insurance Managers of Van Nuys; $500 
from Joseph G. Havlick, a Granada Hills insurance executive; $550 from William 
H. Hawkins, a Sacramento-based agent for Connecticut Mutual Alliance, which 
sells life insurance; $100 from Northridge insurance agent Jeffrey A. Thomas; 
and $500 from Kenneth D. Ulis, owner of a Woodland Hills insurance agency. 
</P>
<P>
Scott said he refused to pledge not to take insurance money because he believed 
insurance interests shouldn't be singled out and banned from contributing to 
political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Boland said she is "proud to have the support" of insurance agents and 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox identified Advanced Insurance Managers as a brokerage firm. He said that 
Hawkins, the Sacramento insurance agent, is a longtime friend and former 
chairman of La Follette's campaign fund-raising organization, the "38 Club." 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox said his opponents are attacking him because, with only three days left 
before the June 5 primary election, he is in the lead. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Boland, a longtime chamber of commerce activist, "should know the 
difference between small-business people and big insurance companies."

A Lancaster mother on trial for murder Friday defended her claim that she was 
protecting her teen-age daughter when she shot to death a construction worker 
she blamed for her daughter's drug use. 
</P>
<P>
In a second day of emotional testimony in Lancaster Superior Court, Belita Fox 
said that although she knew that on the night of the shooting her daughter was 
not at the victim's house, where witnesses have testified the girl used drugs 
on several occasions, she still believed that the girl was in danger. 
</P>
<P>
Fox, 41, described as "hell" the weeks preceding the death of 23-year-old Kevin 
Furman, who she admits shooting four times in his bed on Aug. 30. The midnight 
confrontation at Furman's house culminated a year in which her 17-year-old 
daughter, Cheryl, ran away from home frequently and resisted her mother's 
efforts to prevent her from using methamphetamine and marijuana, Fox testified. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't know what I went through with that child," a tearful Fox told Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Robert B. Foltz Jr. during cross-examination. "You don't know 
anything. . . . I went there to protect my daughter, and, if necessary, 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
Foltz asked how Fox could fear Cheryl was in "imminent peril" if she knew 
Cheryl had been picked up by her stepfather days earlier at Furman's house 
after running away from home and becoming ill. Fox blamed the illness on drug 
use and said she feared the effects of drugs on the girl's heart murmur. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew she would go back" to Furman's house, Fox responded. "In my mind I had 
to protect Cheryl. . . . I wanted to tell Kevin not to let Cheryl go there 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Fox said she called the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department several times 
to report that drugs were used at Furman's house but was told that she would 
have to provide more information. Fox has also described finding a bag of 
marijuana in her daughter's purse and being told by friends that Cheryl snorted 
methamphetamine at the house. 
</P>
<P>
Fox's testimony Friday concluded a defense based on her assertion that she 
wanted to protect Cheryl and that she shot Furman in self-defense when he knelt 
upright in bed and advanced toward her threateningly. In addition, Fox said she 
was drunk at the time -- she testified earlier she had consumed 10 beers and 
two or three shots of liquor -- and did not know the gun was loaded. 
</P>
<P>
Foltz repeated that examination of the bullet paths in Furman's body 
established that he was shot while prone in bed. 
</P>
<P>
Foltz attempted to undercut the potentially sympathetic appeal to the jury of 
her portrayal of herself as an anguished mother fighting to save her daughter 
from drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Foltz questioned Fox about her statement during a hysterical call to a 911 
operator from Furman's bedroom that she had "begged" Furman to leave her 
daughter alone. He cited Fox's testimony that she did not talk to Furman or go 
to his house looking for Cheryl during the month before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Foltz also asked Fox why she remained near Furman's bed for about half an hour 
without calling for help and then called her daughter before calling sheriff's 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"You're standing over him watching him die, you didn't call for help?" Foltz 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought his friends would call for help," said Fox, referring to Furman's 
two roommates, who fled the house after the first shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking to him. I was crying." 
</P>
<P>
Closing arguments in the case are expected Monday.

SHERMAN OAKS MALL STAYS OPEN DESPITE EXPIRED PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once a landmark movie house, now a small mall with a marquee, the 
problem-ridden La Reina Fashion Center in Sherman Oaks became a theater of the 
absurd this week as city officials trying to revoke its occupancy permit 
discovered the permit expired two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although the mall is operating illegally, city officials said they probably 
will not close it. Instead, their aim is to use the lack of a permit to 
pressure the mall's builder to carry out an agreement to widen a nearby 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
The snafu began when City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's staff decided last month 
to have the 2 1/2-year-old shopping center's occupancy permit revoked because 
its developer had repeatedly failed to add a second left turn lane, with its 
own signal light, on Van Nuys Boulevard at Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
After waiting for a response from building officials for two weeks, only to be 
referred this week to public works officials, one of Yaroslavsky's planning 
deputies learned that La Reina's temporary certificate of occupancy had expired 
May 18 without any apparent attempt to shut down the mall or notify its 
operators. 
</P>
<P>
The expired permit was also news to La Reina's current owner, Robert Dollar 
Building Associates of San Francisco, whose Los Angeles attorney said she did 
not learn of Yaroslavsky's efforts until The Times contacted a mall manager for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Shopkeepers in the two-story shopping center also said they had no idea the 
mall was in danger of being closed. 
</P>
<P>
The mall -- centerpiece of a stretch of fashionable shops that has earned that 
part of Ventura Boulevard the nickname "Melrose of the Valley," after the 
trendy street in Hollywood -- appears to be half-vacant, but has tenants such 
as the Gap, Banana Republic and a Chopstix restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bizarre episode," Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks 
Homeowners Assn., said Thursday. "Remember, this used to be a movie theater. 
Doesn't this sound like a Hollywood script? Is this something out of the 
movies?" 
</P>
<P>
"How can the city allow a shopping center to operate without a Certificate of 
Occupancy?" Close asked in a letter he mailed to Yaroslavsky on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Vivian Rescalvo, a planning deputy to Yaroslavsky, acknowledged Thursday that 
because its occupancy permit had lapsed, the mini-mall was operating illegally 
and could be shut. But Rescalvo said Yaroslavsky's aim was not to close the 
mall or put its tenants out of business, but to require construction of the 
street improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I can close them tomorrow and put a lot of people in misery, or I can 
give them another deadline," Rescalvo said. "I think the threat of closure will 
get the improvements done." 
</P>
<P>
Katherine B. Warwick, attorney for Robert Dollar Building Associates, said she 
would work with the city to force the mall's original owner, Century City 
developer Dennis Bass, to complete the promised street project. 
</P>
<P>
Bass, who promised the street improvements in return for a building permit, did 
not return repeated phone calls this week. 
</P>
<P>
According to Warwick, Robert Dollar Building Associates assumed ownership of 
the mall early this year after a Bass company defaulted on a loan from them. 
Part of an out-of-court settlement between the two companies required that 
Bass' firm complete the street-widening project, Warwick said, adding that her 
client has reapplied for an occupancy permit. 
</P>
<P>
Close said Yaroslavsky's office had been too lenient, and he expressed 
frustration that a mall without an occupancy permit could remain open -- 
especially when its builder had a history of "thumbing his nose at the city" 
because the street work went undone. 
</P>
<P>
"How would you like to be a tenant spending money on advertising and promotion 
and trying to build up a business and not even be in a building with a legal 
permit?" Close asked. 
</P>
<P>
"You as a tenant could be shut down tomorrow and the city never told you, the 
council office never told you, the owner never told you."

TIME FOR A FIRST GENTLEMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a speech writer, a woman, who wrote the words "kinder, gentler nation" 
that helped propel George Bush into the White House. But it is another woman, 
his wife Barbara, who is giving force to the words. 
</P>
<P>
In her self-effacing way, this smart First Lady has probably scored more 
political points for the President than any superpower summit could. 
</P>
<P>
America loves leaders who poke fun at themselves. So when they said Barbara 
Bush looked like everybody's grandmother (including, some said unkindly, her 
husband's) she replied, "My mail tells me that a lot of fat, white-haired, 
wrinkled ladies are tickled pink." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Bush is not pushing the conventional boundaries of the First Lady's 
role. She is comfortable with who she is, and she has a talent for putting 
others at ease, be it Raisa Gorbachev, who for her own domestic political 
reasons probably needed a low-key visit; or the students of Wellesley, some of 
whom didn't want the President's wife as commencement speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush disarmed most of her Wellesley critics at Friday's moving 
commencement ceremony by talking about respecting differences -- and by 
throwing in humorous references to cinematic bad boy Ferris Bueller. Sure, the 
First Lady, not surprisingly, is no rebel. But did she tip her hand? "Somewhere 
out there," she told the Wellesley graduates, "(there) may even be someone who 
will one day follow in my footsteps and preside over the White House as the 
President's spouse -- and I wish him well."

CAMPAIGN WATCH; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICAL ADS TO TURN YOU OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like most Southern Californians contemplating a weekend of outdoor activities, 
you're probably wondering what the air quality will be? Unfortunately, the 
outlook is poor. Pollution will be heavy, though in this instance the brown 
gunk obstructing a clear view is not smog but mud. This is the last weekend 
before Tuesday's primary election, and desperate Democrats are slinging the 
slimy stuff with both hands. 
</P>
<P>
Gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein's contributions to this foul stew are 
particularly squalid. The worst of the four negative ads she has thrown at John 
K. Van de Kamp tastelessly exploits film of a murdered woman's body to make the 
false accusation that the then-Los Angeles district attorney did not want to 
prosecute Angelo Buono Jr., one of the Hillside Stranglers. In fact, Van de 
Kamp made a tactical decision to prosecute Buono for sex crimes while moving 
for dismissal of murder charges so that they could be reinvestigated and 
refiled in a stronger form. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Van de Kamp is airing a spot in which consumer advocate Ralph 
Nader alleges without proof that Feinstein is a "pawn of the insurance 
industry" because she supported a no-fault insurance proposal. No-fault is a 
concept supported by people across the country, and some of them may even be as 
honest as Ralph Nader. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the attorney general's race, Arlo Smith's ad assails Ira Reiner's 
ethics -- the only matter of record cited is a censure by the State Bar -- 
while Reiner attacks Smith's competence, even though their offices have 
virtually identical felony conviction rates. 
</P>
<P>
The professional campaign managers who put together such smears do so because 
they believe the electorate is lazy -- unwilling to decide things on the 
issues, when they can wallow in the seamy soap opera of personality politics. 
Thus, these ads are an affront not only to their targets, but also to every 
Californian who casts a vote Tuesday.

THE L.A. COUNTY SHERIFF'S RACE; 
</P>
<P>
* WHY THE TIMES HAS NOT ENDORSED IN THIS AND OTHER CONTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent months The Times has reported extensively on two large problem areas 
in the 7,000-officer Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. One concerned 
major corruption in some special narcotics squads; the other focused on 
questionable or controversial instances of the use of excessive force against 
citizens in the course of arrests. The findings in these reports were 
troubling. 
</P>
<P>
To his credit, Sheriff Sherman Block, who faces only token opposition in 
Tuesday's primary and is sure to be reelected, has ordered an internal review 
of the department's use of force and has worked hard to clean up the narcotics 
corruption mess. The measures he has taken are useful and valuable, but it will 
take months, perhaps longer, to determine whether they will prove truly 
responsive and effective. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department is hardly the first police institution to suffer these 
kinds of problems and it surely won't be the last. But the prior and 
well-publicized existence of similar problems in other U.S. police departments 
is one very good reason for wishing that these problems had been detected, 
monitored and corrected earlier on. So now the sheriff must play catch-up -- 
trying to reduce the damage and review long-standing procedures -- and for now 
the end result is uncertain. This is an unhappy situation for a proud and often 
excellent law-enforcement agency. In the absence of convincing, institutionally 
embedded reform in these two key areas, we consider it is inappropriate to 
endorse Block for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
The Times, which will publish a summary of its candidate and ballot measure 
endorsements Sunday and Tuesday, rarely endorses candidates in partisan 
primaries and in fact does not endorse in every race. That explains, for 
instance, our non-endorsement in the important Democratic and Republican 
primaries for state insurance commissioner. The decision not to endorse in the 
nonpartisan sheriff's election is a difficult but necessary means of expressing 
concern.

CONTROVERSY OVER NEA FUNDS FOR ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The appeal of Fein and Meese to shut down the NEA struck a chord in me. The 
American public doesn't know the half of the outrage being perpetrated on it by 
the vile and money-grubbing "arts community." Every taxpayer is being soaked to 
the tune of 68 cents per capita for federal arts funding. And this kind of 
irresponsible waste is taking place just when the derelict S&amp;Ls -- products 
of the free-market forces Fein and Meese so justifiably eulogize -- are lining 
up with tin cups asking us for several thousand each. Excuse me while I wipe 
this precious little tear. Why, instead of spending profligate sums on the 
"arts," we could even buy two new sets of tires for the Stealth bomber. 
</P>
<P>
Has the NEA, Fein and Meese ask with caustic wit, found even one Voltaire, one 
Mozart? Not a one. And if it had, they'd be illegal aliens to boot. In West 
Germany, the poor idiots spend nearly $39 per capita on arts, and look at them 
-- all their good artists are dead! Anyhow, as the authors point out, there is 
a reliable way to calculate genius to the decimal. On the Christie's scale of 
"acrophobic prices" (in Fein/Meese's eloquent phrase), Van Gogh's "Dr. Gachet" 
is $28.6 million better than his "Irises" (allowing for inflation). 
</P>
<P>
Let's be serious here: Why would we need art and art funding when we can get 
HBO in every corner of the country (and free in most motels)? We should do as 
Meese and Fein suggest and use those staggering sums the NEA spreads around to 
unwashed performance artists to "underwrite earthbound education." Local school 
boards are much more cost-effective at censorship than the NEA could ever be. 
And if just one more child knows that the Earth was suddenly created 6,000 
years ago, won't it all have been worth it?

CONTROVERSY OVER NEA FUNDS FOR ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was not a fervent supporter of the National Endowment for the Arts. Not until 
reading the column by Bruce Fein and Edwin Meese III ("High Clerics of Art Have 
Had Enough," Commentary, May 21). 
</P>
<P>
Their writing deserves an award for lack of both logic and taste. 
</P>
<P>
They complain that the NEA would have yielded a higher return, had it invested 
in "defaulted junk bonds." That very comparison illustrates the reason for the 
NEA, which exists because art seldom is self-supporting. The writers complain 
that there have been no Van Goghs discovered. Poor Van Gogh; a pauperized 
genius whose paintings are now worth millions. "Living" proof of the value of 
the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Meese should be an expert in government subsidies. Remember his involvement in 
the Wedtech scandal? That company received favored treatment (i.e., subsidies), 
for which a few people received prison sentences. Meese is now being 
"subsidized" by the Heritage Foundation. But as a "noble fellow"?

FEINSTEIN ON HIRING QUOTAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was going to vote for Dianne Feinstein on Tuesday. After all, her TV ads 
portray a unique, potentially unbeatable, political animal -- a tough-minded, 
level-headed Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, the truth has come out in the front page of The Times ("Feinstein Vows 
Hiring Quotas by Race, Sex," May 27). The lady turns out to be another 
soft-headed ultra-liberal trying to buy votes by handing out political 
patronage along blatant racial and gender lines. 
</P>
<P>
Now, to her credit Feinstein is being honest. She only wants to do through the 
front door what most Democrats and some Republicans have been doing through the 
backdoor ever since the 1964 Civil Rights Act was turned on its head by 
"affirmative action." 
</P>
<P>
And no doubt Ms. Feinstein will beat the pants off John Van de Kamp who was 
mistakenly tried to copy her flanking movement to the left, i.e., "I've 
appointed more 'minorities', thank you!" 
</P>
<P>
But she is certain to be squashed by an elephant named Pete Wilson. For the 
fat-cat Republicans must be itching to pounce on Feinstein by simply calling 
her what she has promised to be -- a racist whose Sacramento hiring hall will 
have an invisible, but nevertheless real, sign: White males need not apply! 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that when Feinstein finally exits in November, stage "far left," 
she and her fellow Democrats will have no one to blame but themselves. 
</P>
<P>
And another golden opportunity to help the poor and homeless, regardless of 
their race or sex, will have been lost because the stubborn party of the 
jackass refuses to move towards the center on race relations.

CONTROVERSY OVER NEA FUNDS FOR ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In calling for the abolition of the NEA, Meese and Fein ask if there are any 
NEA-funded artists who would do honor to Beethoven. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Beethoven met with the same sort of Philistinism that faces many of today's 
adventurous artists. The players to whom he took his string quartet, Op. 59. 
No. 1, thought he was playing a joke. 
</P>
<P>
"Surely you do not consider these works to be music?" asked Muzio Clementi. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not for you, but for a later age," replied the composer. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily for us music lovers, Meese and Fein weren't around then, or symphony 
programs today might consist of Hummel and Salieri instead of Beethoven and 
Mozart.

CONTROVERSY OVER NEA FUNDS FOR ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The NEA isn't the stock market, no matter how much Fein and Meese would like it 
to be. It's no wonder that 25 years of NEA funding seems interminable to people 
who are always looking for a fast buck and higher return on their investments. 
</P>
<P>
They expect masterworks to be produced and acknowledged in that short space of 
time, when the examples they cite have been around for decades, even centuries. 
The idea that great visual art is what garners the highest bids "at Southeby or 
Christie auctions" is yet another symptom of the malignant Reagan era money 
mentality: the measure of quality is in the price tag. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to shift NEA funds to education is admirable but redundant. All 
art is, by its very nature, public, inclusive, revealing, enlightening -- in 
other words, educational. 
</P>
<P>
NEA grants aren't "government protection against free consumer choice." Rather, 
they are seed money for artistic gardens which, with diligence and luck, will 
prosper and perhaps, given years of critical and popular consideration, bloom 
into the accepted masterworks of the world and give joy and stimulation to 
everyone. And for the notion that art experts are "feasting off taxpayers' 
dollars" -- well, let's just say that no single artist is getting rich from NEA 
money. The price the government has paid certain military suppliers for a small 
bag of bolts and a toilet seat or two could float an entire colony of artists 
for years.

MARINES HONOR NAVAJO CODE TALKERS WHO KEPT JAPANESE GUESSING IN WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BONNA M. DE LA CRUZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nihima, ch'ah ligia, ch'al. 
</P>
<P>
It means nothing to most. But to American Marines during World War II, such 
words were used to code secret combat messages and transmit classified 
documents in a way that baffled the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
More than 400 Marines, recruited from Navajo tribes in Arizona, New Mexico, 
Colorado and Utah, served as code talkers during the war by sending messages in 
the Navajo language. 
</P>
<P>
Four code talkers were honored Friday at the San Diego Marine Corps Recruit 
Depot during graduation ceremonies for the 270 men in Company M. The code 
talkers are in town for the San Diego Museum of Man Indian Fair, being held 
today and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't tell us we'd be coding when they recruited us," said Thomas Begay, 
a code talker who now lives on a Navajo reservation in Gallup, N.M. Begay, 
recruited in 1943 at age 16, said Marine recruiters looked for men on Navajo 
reservations fluent in English and Navajo. The Navajos thought they would be 
regular soldiers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The unwritten Navajo language, difficult to master because of its complex 
syntax and intricate tonal qualities, was adopted by the Marine Corps during 
the war as a voice code because Japanese intelligence experts had broken every 
other code the United States devised. Some estimated that no more than 28 
persons outside the Navajo tribe understood the language at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The code talkers would take the letters of each word of the message in English, 
and devise a code in which they would pick an English word that began with each 
letter, but translate the word into Navajo. The system required a Navajo at 
each end, one to transmit, the other to translate the Navajo words back into 
English and use the initial letters to spell out the message. 
</P>
<P>
"It could not be deciphered by the enemy, which were the Japanese at that time. 
We developed our own terminology for names of units, boats, planes, 
everything," said Keith Little, a code talker from an Indian reservation in 
Crystal, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
Among the code words they devised were nihima, ch'ah ligia, ch'al -- which 
translate to our mother, white hats and frog. In the code, they would mean 
America, sailors and amphibious. Japanese cryptographers were never able to 
break the Navajo-based code. 
</P>
<P>
"The code talkers' greatest claim to fame was that they used their Indian 
heritage to help the war effort. They saved thousands of lives," Lt. Tony 
Wells, spokesman at MCRD, said. 
</P>
<P>
Begay and Little were joined by code talkers Wilson H. Price of Costa Mesa and 
Carl Gorman of Window Rock, Ariz., the capital of the Navajo Nation. For the 
day's events, all four men donned their code talkers uniforms, maize-colored 
shirts, red caps and Navajo-made conch belts of silver and turquoise -- a 
tribute to both military dress and Indian heritage. 
</P>
<P>
While in the service, Begay and Price landed with troops at Iwo Jima on Feb. 
19, 1945, and were present when the famous battle photograph was taken during 
the second flag raising on that island. 
</P>
<P>
"I was quite young when I landed on Iwo Jima. I was right there when they 
raised that flag," Begay said. 
</P>
<P>
The confusing chatter of code talkers like Begay and Price on Iwo Jima was so 
effective that Maj. Howard Conner, signal officer of the 5th Marine Division at 
Iwo Jima, has been quoted as saying, "Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines 
would never have taken Iwo Jima." Begay and Price served under Conner. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Marines initially had 30 Navajo recruits, that number later soared 
to 420. All went through boot camp at MCRD and were trained in coding at the 
Marine communications school at Camp Pendleton, where they were required to 
memorize codes as well as learn to set up and maintain radio equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Code talkers also fought in combat. 
</P>
<P>
"There was always somebody guarding us because we were classified as top 
secret. We couldn't talk about it," Price said. His wife, Rose Price, said she 
was not even aware that he had been a code talker until after his retirement in 
1972, after 30 years of service in the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
Although the military can now scramble messages electronically, Navajo code 
talkers were a fast, efficient way to scramble messages during World War II. In 
fact, Begay and Price were part of a team of four code talkers who beat four 
other Marines, who used conventional coding procedures, in speed and accuracy 
of message transmissions. 
</P>
<P>
"We would take those messages from our officers and code them in Navajo. We had 
to do it fast, in a split second," Begay said.

ENDING GERRYMANDERING BY POLITICIANS: PROS AND CONS OF PROPOSITIONS 118-119 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone who cares about environmental quality should vote No on Tuesday on the 
two reapportionment propositions, Propositions 118 and 119. 
</P>
<P>
They are frauds. Cleverly designed, with different criteria for Northern and 
Southern California, to produce as many districts as possible that will be held 
by friends of the backers (oil companies, chemical and development companies, 
partisan political groups), these initiatives are not an honest effort at 
even-handedness. They will not keep politics out of reapportionment. But they 
will reduce the number of congressional and legislative districts that elect 
environmentalist representatives. If passed, they spell more trouble for Planet 
Earth, especially in California!

In focusing on a single provision of Prop. 118 in your editorial ("Prop. 118: 
Chaos in Sacramento," May 12), you neglected to mention the other four 
significant ethical reforms that would come about as a result of its passage. 
Prop. 118 would ban all payoffs disguised as gifts and honorariums from special 
interests to legislators in a statute that could not be changed without a vote 
of the people. It would assess stiff penalties on legislators who vote on 
issues where they have a personal financial interest. 
</P>
<P>
It would not allow legislators to work as lobbyists for a year after they leave 
office. And it would strengthen ethics enforcement by giving the Joint 
Legislative Ethics Committee a mandate to crack down on ethical violations. 
</P>
<P>
As for the provision which regulates the drawing of legislative district lines, 
Prop. 118 cannot help but improve on the current system. As it is, the 
politicians in power devise a plan in secret that guarantees their 
re-employment at our cost for the next 10 years. Prop. 118 will open up the 
process to public review and refer any redistricting plan to an automatic 
popular referendum to insure that the citizens' interests are placed above the 
politicians.

Shame on Jack Lemmon! As the world turns toward democracy and perestroika, as 
it expresses its yearning for every individual citizen's rightful voice in the 
affairs of state, he has bought into the big-lie technique in his appearance in 
television commercials as a spokesman against Propositions 118 and 119, 
propositions which aim at guaranteeing us a fairer apportionment in our federal 
and state legislative districts. Does he think that the people of California 
are so naive and gullible that they would give credence to his cynical, 
simple-minded blathering that the movement to reform the current apportionment 
system is but a corporate conspiracy? 
</P>
<P>
There is something sinister in this attack. No informed person of good 
intentions could possibly argue that the current apportionment situation in 
California is fair, and would support efforts to make a change in the process 
the next time around. Either of these propositions would be a strong corrective 
to the present de facto under-enfranchisement under which we are suffering. 
</P>
<P>
As from Mr. Lemmon, while I have disagreed with his politics in the past, I 
have always given him credit for being a person of integrity and conviction. 
With this infamous performance, I regret I can no longer feel that way.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE RIDE ON SATURDAYS TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the board of the Orange County Transit District was wondering what its 
ridership thought of a proposal to discontinue door-to-door dial-a-ride service 
on Saturdays, it got its answer at a recent hearing. More than a dozen blind or 
wheelchair-bound supporters of the service turned out to protest the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Some of them, by the way, arrived by dial-a-ride. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of cutting such service back on Saturdays may make some sense to bean 
counters, but it doesn't make much sense for people who have to rely on it 
seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
The service serves about 1.4 million people a year in Orange County, about 3% 
of the total district ridership. Anyone can ride the vans by appointment, but 
the service is subsidized for the elderly and disabled. But on Saturday, there 
are about 1,000 riders now. That's a lot. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of cutting out that day was prompted by a desire to make the service 
more cost-effective. The board asked its staff to come up with some proposals 
and received a recommendation to drop Saturday service and add an hour to the 
weeknight operations. The Saturday program was, the reasoning went, the least 
efficient of the services. 
</P>
<P>
But what the board heard from its riders is that the elderly and disabled who 
use the service are just like the rest of the transit district ridership: They 
have jobs to go to and errands to run on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
What a bad idea. The board heard the message, and now will decide at its June 
18 meeting what to do. It ought to keep Saturday service for the disabled and 
elderly, with the understanding that such service is essential.

ACCOMPLICE IN PIZZA SHOP KILLINGS GETS 50 YEARS TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Lake View Terrace man was sentenced Friday to the maximum term of 50 years to 
life in prison for participating in the murders of two Domino's Pizza employees 
shot by a teen-age accomplice during a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen imposed the sentence on 
Reginald Leon Morris, 22, despite a plea by the man's lawyer that the two 
25-year terms -- one for each count of first-degree murder -- be served 
concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
But Coen said the sentences should be served consecutively because the murders 
involved separate acts of violence and because there were multiple victims. 
Also, Coen said, Morris was an active participant in the crime, which resulted 
in the deaths of Sean Patrick Linn, 23, of Granada Hills and Freddie Zuniga, 
24, of San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
A jury convicted Morris on March 19 of the two murder counts as well as one 
count of robbery, for which he received a three-year prison term Friday that he 
may serve concurrently with the other sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Morris' accomplice, who was 15 at the time of the robbery on Aug. 21, 1988, 
admitted the killings and was placed in the custody of the California Youth 
Authority, which will release him when he turns 25, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Morris planned the robbery and that the 15-year-old, who was a 
cook at the Foothill Boulevard restaurant, shot his co-workers to eliminate 
witnesses. Morris, however, testified he accompanied the youth but was unaware 
the boy wanted to rob the pizza parlor. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig R. Richman said that, under current sentencing 
guidelines, Morris is expected to serve the 50 years in prison before he 
becomes eligible for parole.

LOCAL ELECTIONS ESCONDIDO CITY COUNCIL; 
</P>
<P>
FIRST ELECTED MAYOR TO LEAD CITY AMID CONTINUING GROWTH BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Escondido voters will get their first chance to pick their city's mayor 
Tuesday. And the two candidates present a clear-cut choice because they stand 
at opposite ends of the spectrum in their views on growth. 
</P>
<P>
Voters rewrote the council script in 1988, electing three slow-growth 
candidates in a landslide, replacing a long-entrenched pro-growth majority on 
the council, and opting for a directly elected mayor. 
</P>
<P>
After a long reign by business and banking interests, the Escondido City 
Council has shifted into reverse for the past two years as the new slow-growth 
majority whittled down developers' plans and reversed expansionist city 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, two veteran council adversaries -- Jerry Harmon and Doug Best -- 
will vie for the honor of becoming Escondido's first elected mayor, and 
incumbent councilman Ernie Cowan will face stiff opposition from two 
slow-growth candidates: planning commission chairwoman June Rady and elementary 
school board trustee Sid Hollins. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon, who was one of three slow-growth candidates swept to victory in the 
June, 1988, elections, appears to be a shoo-in to become mayor over Best, who 
was one of the 13 also-rans in that race. Two years ago, Best made a poor 
showing in the council race even though he was the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Best, however, considers his chances "very good to excellent" to beat Harmon, 
now in his fifth council term, despite Harmon's runaway victory in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"People have had a taste of the slow-growth troika and of their fiscal 
irresponsibility in the last two years," Best said. He thinks the tide has 
turned and Escondido voters want a more conservative council. The 
slow-growthers' goals for improvements to public services and the quality of 
life are too costly for the city to implement, Best said. 
</P>
<P>
Best, 64 and a 12-year council veteran, has clashed with Harmon, 46, repeatedly 
over the years, chiefly on growth issues. Best was a planning commissioner in 
1972 when the commission formulated a general plan that called for the city to 
grow to a population of nearly 300,000 -- three times its present size. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, Harmon has led the council's slow-growth majority in a successful 
effort to halve development densities in the city by revamping the general plan 
to produce an eventual city population of about 150,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Best concedes that, even if he and like-thinking Cowan are elected Tuesday, the 
slow-growth trio of Harmon, Kris Murphy and Carla DeDominicis will still hold 
the voting edge on the council because Harmon will retain his present council 
seat, even if he loses the mayoral race to Best. 
</P>
<P>
And, if Harmon wins the mayor's post, his council seat probably will be filled 
by council appointment, with the slow-growth majority picking the new member. 
</P>
<P>
Best is campaigning hard on the point that the slow-growth majority is leading 
the city into stormy fiscal seas. He predicts "catastrophic new financial 
losses" as a result of lawsuits filed against the city by developers caught in 
the city's new policies, which require new development to pay for itself by 
providing the public amenities that its future occupants will need through 
assessments and development fees. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon admits that business and financial interests are opposed to the new city 
plan, but "I'm convinced, based on the results of the last election, that the 
people of Escondido are behind us" in reining back the city's growth rate to a 
more leisurely pace. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan faces a similar problem in campaigning to retain his seat on the council 
as Best does in the mayoral race. His opponents accuse him of being a pawn of 
pro-growth interests and in the pocket of developers. 
</P>
<P>
A recent campaign filing by a developer of the Daley Ranch -- a proposed 
3,000-acre residential community that will be the single largest development in 
the North County city -- showed that Shea Homes had spent about $24,000 to 
conduct a campaign in behalf of Cowan. 
</P>
<P>
"That sure didn't help me," Cowan said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was not aware of the Shea campaign until last week and immediately 
tried to halt the developer's campaign efforts, without success. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan, a councilman since 1982, said that he is not opposed to many of the 
goals of the slow-growth council majority but feels that they are seeking to do 
too much too quickly without considering the costs. 
</P>
<P>
The high standards of city services spelled out in the new general plan "can't 
be delivered without steep increases in city fees and taxes, which I oppose," 
Cowan said. "I believe in living within the budget." 
</P>
<P>
June Rady, who came in sixth out of 15 candidates in the 1988 councilmanic 
elections, considers herself to be a middle-of-the-road candidate, who supports 
the new general plan, "but I feel that there should be some flexibility there, 
so that we as a city can be responsive to the economic climate." 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that we are in a recession right now," she said, "and I want the 
people to know that I am aware of the realities, of the economics of this plan. 
We must adjust to the economic situation, not go overboard." 
</P>
<P>
Hollins, 62, is a retired elementary school administrator who headed a citizens 
committee that revamped the city's general plan to reflect the slow-growth 
philosophy of the council majority. 
</P>
<P>
Hollins hopes to improve relations between the school districts and the city 
government, a relationship that has been less than friendly because of a sharp 
difference of opinion over the division of tax revenues flowing into the city 
redevelopment agency. The schools want money for building schools; the city has 
already committed future revenues to civic and cultural projects.

DOCTOR INDICTED IN HIT-AND-RUN CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A grand jury in Cambridge, Mass., indicted a Van Nuys doctor Thursday on 
charges including second-degree murder in the hit-and-run death of a 
psychologist in April. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Kappler was accused of driving off the Alewife Brook Parkway in 
Cambridge, Mass., striking and killing Paul Mendelson, who was jogging. 
</P>
<P>
A passing Cambridge woman was also hit and suffered serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Kappler allegedly fled the scene and was later found by police in the 
psychiatric unit of a New York hospital. He has been confined to a New York 
state mental hospital since his arrest, said his lawyer, Jonathan Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
Kappler was indicted by a Middlesex County grand jury on charges of 
second-degree murder, armed assault with intent to murder, and assault and 
battery with a dangerous weapon. He was expected to be arraigned on the charges 
next week.

MORNING BRIEFING: IT TOOK VERY SPECIAL PITCH TO GET BAYLOR'S ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARLEY TINKHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Milwaukee Brewer batting coach Don Baylor was hit by pitches 267 times in his 
playing career, a major league record. He told John Lowe of the Detroit Free 
Press that only once did he call time to ask the trainer to spray him with 
pain-killer. 
</P>
<P>
The pitcher? 
</P>
<P>
You got it, Nolan Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
Dim view: Coach Jerry Glanville of the Atlanta Falcons, asked about Alabama 
linebacker Keith McCants, who was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, said he 
wasn't impressed after watching films of the Penn State-Alabama game. 
</P>
<P>
Glanville: "Penn State had that running back, Blair something (Thomas), and I 
didn't see a takedown by McCants all day. He's still trying to tackle him." 
</P>
<P>
Glanville said McCants spent much of the time complaining to the officials 
about holding. 
</P>
<P>
"If he thinks he was held in college, well, wait until he gets into our 
league," Glanville said. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who was the last pitcher to throw a no-hitter against the Angels? 
</P>
<P>
For the record: Joe Magdziak of Norwalk, correcting an item on Bob Feller, 
points out that the USS Alabama was a battleship, not an aircraft carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Yankee doodle dandy: From New York Yankee announcer Phil Rizzuto: "I am No. 1 a 
Yankee rooter and No. 2 a broadcaster. When an opponent hits a homer, I am 
one-hundredth as excited as when a Yankee hits one. I don't call myself a 
journalist. I just can't do a game straight." 
</P>
<P>
Add Rizzuto: He once had this exchange with broadcast partner Frank Messer: 
</P>
<P>
Rizzuto: "There's a foul ball smashed into the Yankee dugout. Boy, I hope 
that's not Guidry who got in the way." 
</P>
<P>
Messer: "Scooter, uh, Guidry is on the mound." 
</P>
<P>
Rizzuto: "You know, Frank, you're right." 
</P>
<P>
Now-it-can-be-told Dept.: Gary McCord, the former USC golfer who never struck 
it rich on the PGA Tour, told USA Today he was flying to the 1985 Memorial 
tournament in Dublin, Ohio, when he spotted CBS-TV director Frank Chirkinian in 
first class. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't even playing in the tournament," McCord said. "I was broke. I had 
nothing to do, so I pleaded with Frank to let me help out that weekend, be a 
gofer." 
</P>
<P>
Chirkinian did better than that. He assigned McCord to the 16th hole as an 
analyst. He's been there ever since. 
</P>
<P>
How-times-have-changed Dept.: Ireland's Ron Delany recalls his reception after 
winning the Olympic 1,500-meter run at Melbourne in 1956: "They met me at 
Shannon Airport with an open car when I flew home. I remember that car. It was 
a Mercedes 300 sports car. Today, when you win a race, they give you the car. 
In 1956, they gave me a ride." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Joe Cowley of the Chicago White Sox in 1986. He beat the Angels, 
7-1. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Tom Watson, on how he helped former President Gerald Ford with his 
golf game: "First, hitting the ball. Second, finding out where it went." HARLEY

ONE FAN WON'T FORGET COMMENTS BY PAGLIARULO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If in fact the criticism was aimed at Tony Gwynn, I think Mike Pagliarulo has a 
lot of audacity. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Gwynn is the Padres. He comes to play every game. The same cannot be said 
of his teammates. If they would follow his example of fighting for batting cage 
time and not going out for drinks after games instead of criticizing him, this 
team would stand a chance of achieving its potential. 
</P>
<P>
If it's true that the Yankees have asked one of their players to give up the 
No. 13, perhaps Jack McKeon would agree to let Pagliarulo go back to New York 
and reclaim it.

REFRESHING MEMORIES ABOUT CLAY-LISTON II 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earl Gustkey's recollection of Clay-Liston II is a tad time-warped. When the 
facts are more interesting than the legends, print the facts. 
</P>
<P>
Liston was in the best shape of his career for the rematch, then the fight was 
postponed six months when Ali went under the knife for hernia surgery. By fight 
night, Liston had lost his physical and mental edge and had gained six pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Liston lost by KO on his feet, and I lost $28.

DRYSDALE DOESN'T LIKE UMPIRES BEING HANDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I found it hard to believe that Don Drysdale, with years of baseball 
experience, would make the remark that he has always questioned the right of an 
umpire to put his hands on a ballplayer to prevent a scuffle, inasmuch as a 
player does not have the right to bodily contact the umpire. Surely Drysdale 
should be aware of the difference -- the umpire is expected to maintain order 
on the field and if necessary to do so must restrain the player. 
</P>
<P>
And in Drysdale's interview with an umpire after the game, he made a remark 
about the umps turning the game over to the players. 
</P>
<P>
I never thought I would miss Ross Porter on TV, but I do.

BASEBALL / COLLEGE WORLD SERIES; 
</P>
<P>
STANFORD GETS A CALL AND WINS, 5-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
OMAHA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The home run that wasn't was one of several missed opportunities that hurt 
Georgia Southern and helped make Stanford a winner in the opening game of the 
College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hammonds' sacrifice fly in the bottom of the 10th inning tied the game and 
Troy Paulsen's single won it, 5-4, for Stanford, which survived in large part 
because of six Georgia Southern errors and a key umpire's call. 
</P>
<P>
A long drive by Georgia Southern catcher Rob Fitzpatrick, who has hit 21 home 
runs, was ruled to have hit the lower interior fence in left-center field -- 
rather than a higher exterior fence -- negating a two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
"When the ball was hit, I went out to rule it," third base umpire Randy 
Christal said. "I followed the trajectory of the ball but then lost it in the 
white background of the outfield fence signs. Without a good look at the 
finish, I based part of the call on the reaction of the center fielder." 
</P>
<P>
Hammonds, the Cardinal center fielder, said he didn't see the ball, and neither 
did Stanford Coach Mark Marquess. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't tell," Marquess said. "If it did hit the second fence, then it was 
a home run. But, like I said, I couldn't tell." 
</P>
<P>
Todd Greene, who tagged up on the play and managed to reach only third base, 
was out at the plate when Mike Yuro missed a bunt on a squeeze play. Jeff 
Miller then struck out to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford (57-10) starter Stan Spencer struck out 12 in nine innings and didn't 
walk a batter. He yielded eight hits. The junior right-hander has 145 
strikeouts in 131 2/3 innings this season. 
</P>
<P>
Paulsen's single, only the eighth Cardinal hit, made a loser of sophomore 
right-hander Joey Hamilton for the fourth time this season. Hamilton leads the 
nation with 18 victories. Brian Sackinsky (9-1), who gave up an unearned in the 
top of the inning, got the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Southern (50-18) had taken a 4-3 lead when Fitzpatrick singled home 
Doug Eder in the top of the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Burnett singled to lead off the Stanford 10th. He moved to third on 
Hamilton's wild throw to second on a sacrifice bunt by Troy Tallman, and scored 
on Hammond's fly to right. Paulsen's single drove in Tallman, who had taken 
second on Hamilton's error. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia 3, Mississippi State 0 -- Dave Fleming pitched a four-hitter in 
shutting out the Tigers for the second time this season in the other 
first-round game. 
</P>
<P>
The shutout, the first in the Series since Florida State's Chris Pollack beat 
Arizona State, 3-0, in 1987, moved the Bulldogs (49-18) into a second-round 
game Sunday against Stanford. Mississippi State (49-20) faces Georgia Southern 
in an elimination game on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming (12-5) faced one batter over the minimum through seven innings. An 
error in the eighth and a two-out single in the ninth gave the Tigers their 
other baserunners.

SILVA ESTABLISHES SOUTH BAY BEACHHEAD; 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL: LAST YEAR'S LEADING MONEY WINNER ON THE PROFESSIONAL TOUR 
HAS A NEW HOME, ATTITUDE AND PARTNER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With two feet planted firmly in the sand, Jackie Silva finally is finding some 
roots in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
For the past four years, Silva has been the top player on the Women's 
Professional Volleyball Assn. beach tour. 
</P>
<P>
But the cosmopolitan lifestyle of a touring pro has gotten to be too much for 
Silva. 
</P>
<P>
She has spent summers playing beach tournaments on the fledgling women's tour 
in locales as varied as Cleveland; Albuquerque, N.M.; and Shonan Beach, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Silva has wintered either in Brazil -- where she is a national hero -- or in 
Italy, where she played indoor volleyball in the women's Italian Professional 
League. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Silva said enough is enough. 
</P>
<P>
"For the last four years, I have never really had a place," Silva said. "But 
now I know I want to be here." 
</P>
<P>
When the semifinals of the Hermosa Beach Open begin Sunday morning at 9, Silva, 
28, practically can walk along The Strand from her north Redondo apartment to 
take her place on the court. 
</P>
<P>
The final of the $25,000 event will be played at approximately 2:30 p.m. next 
to Hermosa Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
At the Hermosa event -- one of the most heavily attended stops on the WPVA tour 
-- volleyball fans will see a fresh type of game from Silva and Janice 
Opalinski, Silva's new partner. 
</P>
<P>
Spectators are used to the power game that Silva and former partner Patty Dodd 
-- the wife of men's beach volleyball champion Mike Dodd -- took to unexpected 
heights in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Silva and Dodd won 10 of the first 11 tournaments last year -- including eight 
in a row -- but had striking personality differences. 
</P>
<P>
"We had different ways," Silva said. "At the end of the season, we couldn't 
even talk anymore, even on the court. We couldn't keep a friendship at all, 
outside or inside volleyball." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the team split up in August after finishing second to Opalinski 
and Linda Chisholm-Carrillo in the USA Championships at Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Patty is a nice person, but you've got to really work to be her friend," Silva 
said. "Otherwise she just stays to herself." 
</P>
<P>
Silva spent the rest of the tour playing with Rita Crockett-Royster, winning 
once and coming in second in the tour finale in Cincinnati. Still, Silva ended 
the season as the tour's leading points and money winner ($32,000). 
</P>
<P>
Opalinski, 29, is a schoolteacher from San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
She and the kinetic Silva might have differing personalities, but they have 
shared success, winning the tour's first three events -- the Arizona Open in 
Phoenix, the Jag Santa Barbara Open, and the PCH Open in San Diego -- and are 
the seeded first at Hermosa. 
</P>
<P>
They are probably the shortest pair on the tour. Silva is 5-foot-6 and 
Opalinski is 5-7. 
</P>
<P>
So the frenetic days of Silva-Dodd -- Silva racing all over the court and Dodd 
putting away thunderous kills -- are over. Opalinski is not a tremendous hitter 
or blocker, so she and Silva play a structured game that relies on ball 
control. 
</P>
<P>
"We wait for the right time to make points," Silva said. "And we don't make 
many mistakes. You cannot expect the ball to go straight down to the ground all 
the time, but Janice is a smart player." 
</P>
<P>
Silva probably works harder than before, scampering for digs, setting for 
Opalinski and rising up for blocks. 
</P>
<P>
But it makes for an electric game, one that Silva said rivals the excitement of 
men's beach volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people enjoy our game better because you get to see more plays," 
Silva said. "It's not like the men, who just pass, set, hit. People can watch 
and get an idea of how it is possible to play volleyball." 
</P>
<P>
It is also growing in popularity. Although the tournament prize money does not 
approach the lucrative purses of the men's tour, the women are finding it 
possible to make a living playing volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
Tournament promoters expect a crowd of 15,000 for a June 23-24 event in Fresno 
-- similar attendance to a men's tournament held this year at the same site. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderful sport," Silva said. "People get to go to the beach, they 
don't pay anything to get in, they're close to the players, they watch a great 
game and watch each other." 
</P>
<P>
South Bay fans will see more of Silva now that she has established a year-round 
base here. She practices on the beach about three hours a day, runs on the sand 
for an hour and works out at a local gym as part of her training regimen. 
</P>
<P>
She is also gaining proficiency at a new language. Silva speaks limited 
English, preferring her native Portuguese, but she is learning. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult," Silva said. "I don't like to study too much." 
</P>
<P>
Silva plans to spend the winter away from volleyball, promoting and marketing 
her line of beach clothing. 
</P>
<P>
And after seven years with the Brazilian national volleyball team -- including 
the 1980 and '84 Olympic teams -- Silva finally is getting some much-needed 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
"Brazil is beautiful, but it is nice here too," Silva said. "It's a nice, quiet 
place."

VIOLA, METS GIVE HARRELSON FIRST VICTORY, 4-0

Frank Viola gave up six hits in eight innings and Gregg Jefferies and Mike 
Marshall hit solo homers as the New York Mets beat the Phillies, 4-0, at 
Philadelphia Friday night for their first victory under Manager Bud Harrelson. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the fifth in a row for the Phillies, who haven't won since a 
one-day stand atop the National League East last week. 
</P>
<P>
Viola (8-2) struck out five and walked three before getting relief help in the 
ninth from John Franco. Harrelson is 1-1 since succeeding the fired Dave 
Johnson Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies traded places with Howard Johnson in the order, the first major move 
by Harrelson since taking control. Johnson led off and Jefferies batted third. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to stay there (third in the batting order)," said Jefferies, adding 
that he never had batted first before coming to the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
"I always batted third," he said. "I want to be the guy in that situation, the 
bases loaded, I kind of missed that. Instead of driving in runs I've been 
trying to get on base," Jefferies said. 
</P>
<P>
Phillie starter Dennis Cook lost for the first time after five victories, 
giving up eight hits and all four Met runs. The Phillies' Lenny Dykstra singled 
in the fifth to equal his career-high 14-game hitting streak. Dykstra had two 
hits and increased his average to .396. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 6, Houston 5 -- Greg Litton's two-out, bases-loaded grounder in 
the 11th inning scored Robby Thompson with the winning run as the Giants 
spoiled a three-home run game by the Astros' Glenn Davis at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson got a one-out single off loser Jim Clancy (1-4), the sixth Astros' 
pitcher. Gary Carter's double sent Thompson to third and Jose Uribe was 
intentionally walked to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Litton hit a sharp grounder to shortstop Rafael Ramirez, who dived for the ball 
but was unable to make a play at home plate as Thompson scored. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Bedrosian (1-3) pitched two hitless innings of relief as the Giants ended 
a five-game home losing streak and won at Candlestick Park for only the seventh 
time in 23 games. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 4, Pittsburgh 1 -- The Expos scored three runs in the fourth inning at 
Pittsburgh without a well-hit ball and ended the Pirates' five-game winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos used Spike Owen's bases-loaded walk, a passed ball, a hit-and-run 
single and a sacrifice bunt in the fourth to win their fourth game in a row and 
end losing pitcher Doug Drabek's six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Gross (7-3) struck out six and walked none in beating Drabek (7-2), who 
lost for the first time since a 4-1 loss to the Chicago Cubs April 14. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 6, Chicago 4 -- Jose Oquendo ended a one-for-16 slump with an RBI 
single in the fourth inning and drove in Milt Thompson with a squeeze bunt in 
the sixth for the Cardinals in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Pendleton also drove in two runs for the Cardinals, who pulled into a 
fifth-place tie with the Cubs, the defending East champions. The Cardinals have 
won only two of their last seven games and the Cubs have lost eight of 11. 
</P>
<P>
Jose DeLeon (5-3) needed relief help from Ken Dayley and Lee Smith, who got the 
last out for his fifth save. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 16, San Diego 11 -- Oddibe McDowell had a three-run homer for his third 
hit of the game as the Braves struck for eight runs on three homers in the 
second inning in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Gant, who scored four runs, hit a two-homer and Dale Murphy had a three-run 
shot in the second as the Braves took a 12-3 lead.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
A'S ECKERSLEY MAKES IT EXCITING -- FOR A CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That Dennis Eckersley recorded his 16th save in as many chances is not as 
remarkable as how he did it. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland A's top relief pitcher gave up a ninth-inning run and almost issued 
his first walk in 46 2/3 innings but held on to save the Athletics' 4-3 victory 
over the Kansas City Royals on Friday night in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt all right going in there, but I didn't feel that good when I came out," 
Eckersley said. "I made it tough." 
</P>
<P>
Eckersley went to a 3-and-0 count on Kevin Seitzer before retiring him on a fly 
ball for the second out in the ninth. Eckersley has not issued a walk in his 
last 163 batters, and it became important when Kurt Stillwell doubled and 
scored on Gerald Perry's single, only the second run off Eckersley in 19 
appearances this season. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland Manager Tony La Russa said Eckersley, who saved a game for the third 
day in a row, would not pitch tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"Eckersley said he felt fine -- he's very honest," La Russa said. "Every one of 
our relievers will speak up when they're not right. We're playing for the long 
haul. Being a hero is a losing proposition. Eck's outstanding. In this game 
nothing's automatic, but he is amazing." 
</P>
<P>
So are Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire, who homered on consecutive pitches in the 
first inning. 
</P>
<P>
After a one-out single by Carney Lansford off rookie Kevin Appier (1-1), 
Canseco hit his 19th homer, a drive that hit halfway up the left-field foul 
pole and increased his major RBI total to 49. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire hit the next pitch for his 13th homer and a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 7, Toronto 1 -- Teddy Higuera, who missed his last start after being 
struck on the knee by a line drive, held the Blue Jays to a run and four hits 
in six innings in Toronto, and Paul Molitor drove in three runs as Milwaukee 
regained first place in the American League East. 
</P>
<P>
Higuera (5-1), making his first start since May 21 when he was hit on the right 
knee by a line drive hit by Seattle's Henry Cotto, struck out six and walked 
one. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 4, Cleveland 3 -- Doug Jones, the major league leader with 17 saves, 
failed for only the second time this season when Boston scored two runs with 
two outs in the ninth inning in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians had taken a 3-2 lead in the bottom of the eighth inning on Brook 
Jacoby's RBI single, and Jones (0-2) retired the first two batters in the 
ninth. But Dwight Evans singled and pinch-runner Randy Kutcher scored on a 
triple by Tony Pena. Mike Greenwell singled Pena home. 
</P>
<P>
New York 4, Baltimore 3 -- Dave LaPoint pitched 7 2/3 strong innings to end a 
five-game Yankee losing streak for the third time this season, and Steve 
Balboni homered in the sixth inning to break a 2-2 tie in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 2, Minnesota 1 -- Pinch-hitter Carlos Martinez, batting only .195, 
singled home the winning run with two outs in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Lyons and Ron Karkovice singled off reliever Terry Leach (2-1) with one 
out. After Scott Fletcher popped out, Martinez batted for Craig Grebeck and 
delivered his game-winning hit. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 9, Seattle 7 -- Cecil Fielder remained tied with Canseco for the major 
league home run lead with 19 by hitting his first career grand slam and driving 
in five runs as the Tigers broke a five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, the Mariners got a grand slam and five RBIs from Jay Buhner, who 
played his first major league game of the season after recovering from a 
severely sprained ankle.

KEETER EDGES BRADER TO WIN VENTURA MAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don Keeter of Ventura and Lynn Brader of Somis exchanged leads frequently in 
the 15-lap Street Stock main event at Ventura Raceway on Friday night before 
Keeter held on to win by a half-car length. 
</P>
<P>
After two re-starts and numerous yellow flags, Brader and Keeter launched their 
duel. 
</P>
<P>
Brader held the lead through eight laps before Keeter took the lead on Lap 9 
when Brader went high in Turn 2. Brader powered ahead in the front straightaway 
on Lap 10, however. Brader went high again in Turn 2 on the final lap, allowing 
Keeter to take a slight lead before both cars bumped and slid in Turn 4, with 
Keeter nosing out Brader at the finish line for his third main-event win of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Mini Stock figure-eight season points leader Richard Webster of Camarillo and 
Cory Kruseman of Ventura battled the entire way for the checkered flag in the 
10-lap main event. 
</P>
<P>
Kruseman had just edged past Webster on Lap 7 when a yellow flag came out, 
allowing Webster to go back in front and hold off Kruseman for the victory. 
Randy Bingham of Camarillo was third. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Olsen of Ventura improved his fifth-place season points standing in the 
Street Stock figure-eight division, driving to his first main-event win of the 
season in the eight-lap race. Jim Firsich of Port Hueneme and Larry Lucies of 
Point Mugu finished second and third, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Mini Stock eight-lap heat-race winners were Bingham, Pat Garrety of Ventura, 
and Marty Desbrow of Ventura.

SOUTHERN SECTION 1-A DIVISION SOFTBALL PREVIEW;

PARACLETE FACES NEMESIS AGOURA FOR TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paraclete High Coach Margaret Neill has instructed her team to ignore the 
revenge factor in today's Southern Section 1-A Division softball championship 
against Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura (24-5) beat Paraclete, 10-4, in last year's semifinals and went on the 
win the championship. 
</P>
<P>
But Neill is more concerned about returning to Lancaster with the school's 
first softball championship. 
</P>
<P>
The teams will meet today at 2:30 p.m. at Mayfair Park in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not really talking about last year's loss," Neill said. "We wanted to 
meet Agoura, but it's more coincidence than anything." 
</P>
<P>
Paraclete (25-4) has relied on a balanced attack to reach its third title game. 
The Spirits lost in the finals in 1981 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Staats (15-2) and Shannon Peterson (10-2) have shared the pitching 
duties. Staats, a junior right-hander, will start today. Stacy Mulcahy, a 
senior center fielder, leads the team with a .480 batting average, and four 
other players are hitting better than .400. 
</P>
<P>
"The nice thing is that it's not just one or two people doing the job," Neill 
said. "Each game, it's somebody different." 
</P>
<P>
Paraclete will face Agoura's Melissa Thatcher (23-5), a junior right-hander who 
has shut out three of four playoff opponents. Thatcher, who has struck out 150 
and walked 48 in 193 1/3 innings, has an earned-run average of 0.80. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher (.447) is also Agoura's leading hitter. Freshman third baseman Rachel 
Clarke and senior center fielder Leslie North are each hitting .386. 
Defensively, the Chargers have received strong play from senior shortstop Jill 
Hartwig. 
</P>
<P>
"Having won it last year helps us experience-wise," Agoura Coach Linda Moule 
said.

BATS, UNIFORMS STOLEN FROM PADRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Someone broke into an equipment storage area in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium 
in the past 12 days and stole several dozen Padre bats and several uniform 
shirts, Doug Duennes, director of stadium operations, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The theft was discovered by Brian Prilaman, Padre equipment manager, during 
batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
According to a club source who asked not to be identified, Tony Gwynn sent a 
clubhouse boy to the storage area near the team's indoor batting cage for some 
bats. When the boy returned empty-handed, saying he didn't see any bats, 
Prilaman went and discovered the equipment missing. 
</P>
<P>
Duennes said he is not sure when the theft took place. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't pin it down at this point," he said. "Sometime between last home 
stand (which ended May 20) and this one." 
</P>
<P>
Duennes said someone cut through a chain-link fence to get to the equipment. A 
club source said most of the bats and jerseys taken belonged to some of the 
bigger names on the Padres, players such as Gwynn, Joe Carter and Jack Clark. 
Among the missing items, according to the source, were more than 100 bats, 
including five dozen belonging to Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fair number," Duennes said. "I don't know the exact number, but it's 
considerable." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres first turned the matter over to stadium security but planned to make 
a police report late Friday night after finishing inventory. 
</P>
<P>
Prilaman said the team had ordered enough bats to last through the season but 
now would must order more. For the time being, though, none of the players will 
be short because the team keeps a supply in the clubhouse as well as the 
storage area.

NOON SETS MEET RECORD OF 73-6, BUT ONLY 77-0 1/2 WILL SATISFY HIM 
</P>

<P>
Fallbrook's Brent Noon set a state meet record in the shotput with a throw of 
73-feet-6 Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
But who cares? Certainly not Noon. 
</P>
<P>
The senior has already gone as far as 76-2, just 10 inches from the 11-year-old 
official national high school record. 
</P>
<P>
It is that mark, 77-0, with which Noon is obsessed. He has been chasing it for 
four years, and time is now the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
He has six more throws in his high school career, in today's finals. 
</P>
<P>
"76-11 wouldn't mean anything," Noon said. "77 wouldn't even mean anything -- 
it's got to be 77-0 1/2." 
</P>
<P>
Noon's best mark Friday erased the 68-4 set by Brian Blutreich of Capistrano 
Valley in the 1985 state meet. No one had come within a foot of that since 
then, not even Noon, who won last year at 66-1 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Noon had somewhat of a setback in the discus. His 193-6 was the best throw of 
the day until Rob Powell of Redwood entered the ring for his third and final 
try and let go with a 198-1. 
</P>
<P>
If Noon was disappointed with his luck, he had plenty of company among San 
Diego Section athletes. 
</P>
<P>
University City's Jerome Price, who leads the nation in the long jump with a 
legal best of 25-5, scratched on two of his three tries and finished with only 
the second-best mark of the evening, 24-4 3/4. Jason Duff of Etiwanda jumped 
24-8 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Price blamed bad steps, which he said caused the fouls, on a slight head wind. 
He said he'll correct the problem by moving his starting point today. 
</P>
<P>
Like Noon, Price is going for a national record. He needs to add 12 inches to 
his best to move past Tulare's James Stallworth, who went 26-4 3/4 at this meet 
one year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Top San Diego Section qualifiers also included Poway's Kim Dill, who ran the 
second-fastest time in the 100 hurdles, 14.17 (behind the 13.61 of Santa 
Monica's Felice Lipscomb in a different heat) and Mar Vista's Hector Hernandez, 
who had the third-best 1,600 at 4:12.95. Coley Candaele of Carpinteria had the 
fastest, 4:12.44. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said he could have gone faster if he hadn't began his kick so early 
-- at the beginning of the final lap. Hernandez won't make the same mistake 
today, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Castle Park's Eric Bell, until last week the top 110 high hurdler in the 
county, did not qualify in that event, and Morse's Chris Jones, who beat Bell 
last week at the section finals, had the slowest time of the nine qualifiers, 
14.82. 
</P>
<P>
Jones missed the finals in the 300 intermediates with a time of 39.97, despite 
having come in with the state's fourth-fastest mark this year (37.89). 
</P>
<P>
University City's Angela Kimmey qualified for the finals in the 100 meters at 
12.10 but reinjured a hip flexor and quadriceps muscle and had to skip the 200. 
She said she'll be able to run the 100 today. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln's Scott Hammond anchored Lincoln to a qualifying spot in the 400 relay 
but in doing so delivered a knockout blow to his chances in his big event, the 
long jump. Hammond had no spunk left in his legs and turned in the following 
series: scratch, 20-4 1/2 and 22-1 3/4. The last one was well below his 
season's legal best of 24-2 and, as it turned out, five inches from the last 
qualifying mark turned in by Jon Baker of Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond said he usually jumps before he runs the relay, and reversing that 
order took its toll. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real hard to come from behind on the anchor leg," Hammond said. "And I 
had to come from behind." 
</P>
<P>
At least he received some thanks from his teammates after Hammond made up 
ground on two opponents and gave Lincoln a second-place finish in the first 
heat at 41.98, good for the seventh of nine qualifying spots. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond also came back to qualify in the 200, but barely. His 21.88 was good 
for the ninth and final spot in today's finals. 
</P>
<P>
Mt Carmel's Allison Dring, who ran in four races -- the 200, 400, 400 relay and 
1,600 relay -- advanced in just one -- the 400; her time of 55.55 was third 
best. Janice Nicholls of Bakersfield ran 55.30. 
</P>
<P>
Riley Washington, like Dring and Hammond a sophomore, came in with the state's 
best legal time in the 100, 10.53. He didn't near that, but his 10.66 qualified 
him fifth. Lompoc's Napoleon Kaufman had the top time, 10.56.

It was the drums Bill Neville was worried about. 
</P>
<P>
The coach of the U.S. men's national volleyball team had a surge of confidence 
upon arrival in San Diego Wednesday. But his team had the worst record (1-9) in 
the Federation Internationale de Volleyball World League. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was hope. Neville said his team showed a lot of improvement after 
a sweep through Italy, France and Brazil, the countries that make up Pool A of 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
But the fans of the Brazilan team were a cause for concern. Their rowdiness 
during earlier matches in Brazil, which included beating large drums, proved to 
be distracting. 
</P>
<P>
They left their drums at home for Friday night's match at the San Diego Sports 
Arena, but the United States still lost to Brazil, 13-15, 15-9, 15-8, 15-6. 
</P>
<P>
The United States also dropped matches to Brazil on May 25 in front of 15,200 
in Brasilia and with a crowd of 17,150 on May 27 in Belo Horiozonte. 
</P>
<P>
Neville said of the Brazilian fans: 
</P>
<P>
"They are rabid," he said. "In timeouts my lips could have been pressed against 
my players' ears and they still couldn't have heard me. A lot of them know 
nothing about the game, they just come to make noise." 
</P>
<P>
He had hoped the civility of the American fans would leave a bad taste in the 
mouth -- and somehow rub off on the play -- of the visitors. 
</P>
<P>
"This place will seem like a library to them." 
</P>
<P>
Brazil didn't have to study the Americans very long. 
</P>
<P>
An intense U.S. team came out fired up and hungry, winning the first game 
behind the play of hitter Jon Root and setter Uvaldo Acosta. 
</P>
<P>
"The first game we came out and played well," Neville said. "We started on a 
positive note." 
</P>
<P>
The momentum changed quickly. The U.S. appeared to miscommunicate on plays 
often and got tricked with stuffed blocks at the net often. 
</P>
<P>
"'Brazil turned it up a notch and we got into a finger-pointing mode," Neville 
said. The setters started to pull back and get tentative and the hitters got 
frustrated, and it all snowballed. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil's brash and aggressive style was expected, but Neville said he had hoped 
the U.S. could overcome it with organization and planning, the American style 
of play. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't to be. The closest the U.S. got after the first game was closing a 
13-5 deficit to 13-9 in the second game, but Brazil closed it out on another 
stuffed blocked. 
</P>
<P>
Root, who led the U.S. with 21 kills, was stuffed 11 times at the net. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of those guys who can get easily frustrated," Neville said. "He can 
put a lot of pressure on the setters, but he's not good with a low set." 
</P>
<P>
Brazil (8-3) is now tied with Italy for first in Pool A, and will meet the U.S. 
(1-10) tonight at the Forum in Los Angeles at 7:30. The top two teams from Pool 
A and Pool B will advance to the league championship tournament July 14-15 in 
Osaka, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The United States was hurt by the absence of Mark Arnold, who had a 102 degree 
temperature earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Leading Brazil was Alexendre Ramos, who finished with 15 kills. 
</P>
<P>
"He did the best tonight," Brazil Coach Paulo Freitas said through an 
interpreter. "He was the most important player and he had a sore ankle." 
</P>
<P>
Ramos was the best on this night, but Brazil changes its lineup and positions 
so often, one player never dominates, Freitas said. 
</P>
<P>
"'Because we're so young," Freitas said, "they alter." 
</P>
<P>
"I am worried," said Freitas. "It's difficult to win against the Americans."

FINAL DATES FOR '92 CUP ANNOUNCED 
</P>

<P>
The dates for the best-of-seven 1992 America's Cup finals were announced 
Friday, and in a change from recent races, the series will have scheduled off 
days. 
</P>
<P>
The opening race between the U.S. defender and a foreign challenger is set for 
Saturday, May 9, 1992. Races two, three and four are scheduled for May 10, 12 
and 14, and the fifth through seventh races, if necessary, would be May 16, 17 
and 19. 
</P>
<P>
The schedule eliminates the practice of "called lay days," under which either 
competitor had the option of calling for an off day twice during the final. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, races will be held on Saturdays, Sundays, Tuesdays and 
Thursdays. If weather forces postponement of a race, it will be held on the 
next scheduled race day. 
</P>
<P>
The schedule was announced by Tom Ehman, general manager of the America's Cup 
Organizing Committee. Ehman said the new format will make it easier to plan for 
television and spectator control and avoid conflict with the Navy, which has 
ship movements on Mondays and Fridays. Starting time for each race is expected 
to be 1 p.m., which Ehman said would be ideal for worldwide live television. It 
would coincide with late evening in Europe and the next morning in Australia, 
Japan and New Zealand. The announcement came at the conclusion of two days of 
meetings among the challenger syndicates. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen of the 20 challenger syndicates that have paid the $25,000 entry fee 
attended; the German and Swiss groups did not. Ehman said the German group, 
based in Hamburg, told him a major sponsor has been lost but that it still 
intends to enter a boat. 
</P>
<P>
The challengers spent part of the closing session discussing the availability 
of dock and facility space in San Diego. The syndicates have been concerned 
about the cost of renting private facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Ehman said a possible solution might be to utilize the 10th Avenue Marine 
Terminal in San Diego and the National City Marine Terminal at 24th Street. 
Both are cargo facilities controlled by the San Diego Unified Port District. 
Ehman said he would speak with port district officials shortly about their use. 
</P>
<P>
In other America's Cup business: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ehman announced the dates for next year's first World Championships in the 
new 75-feet International America's Cup Class: May 11-18 in San Diego. Ehman 
said there are plans to hold a series of tune-up races the week before. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The challengers group agreed advertising would be permitted on the sail and 
hull of the boats but that no tobacco advertising would be allowed. The size 
and amount of advertising has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
Ehman said the advertising and other issues would be discussed with the 
defenders' group during meetings Tuesday and Wednesday in San Diego.

A San Diego man was released from County Jail after police said that, for now, 
they have eliminated him as a suspect in the murder of one of three young women 
killed in the city's Clairemont area since Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Alberto Lebron, 31, a former Marine employed as a tanker-truck driver 
delivering gasoline to service stations, was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of 
murdering Holly Suzanne Tarr, 18, who was stabbed to death April 3. Tarr was 
one of three young women who were stabbed to death within a two-block area. 
Police said Lebron had been under surveillance because he matched the 
description of a man seen fleeing the scene moments after Tarr was murdered.

In a victory for schoolchildren and a defeat for the tax man, Gov. George 
Deukmejian signed into a law Friday a bill that would exempt school-sponsored 
youth groups from having to collect sales tax on items they sell. The measure, 
sponsored by Assemblyman Johan Klehs (D-Castro Valley), nullifies a decision by 
the State Board of Equalization that required most school groups to collect 
sales tax on many items they sell to earn money for after-school activities. 
The board made the decision as part of a 3-2 ruling against the Monterey High 
School wrestling team, which had been served with a $1,000 bill for sales taxes 
officials said it should have collected when it sold fried calamari at a county 
fair.

DUTCH LOOKING FOR LINK IN DEATHS; 
</P>
<P>
CYCLING: SOME DOCTORS ARE CONCERNED A PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING DRUG COULD BE CAUSE 
OF FATALITIES, BUT RESEARCH DOES NOT SHOW THAT.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last February, Dutch cyclist Johannes Draaijer died of cardiac arrest a few 
days after a physician had declared him fit. 
</P>
<P>
Questions surrounding his death linger in the Netherlands, where bicycles are 
as prominent as canals. 
</P>
<P>
Draaijer, who finished 20th in last year's Tour de France, is the 15th 
competitive cyclist from the Netherlands to have died in three years, a 
statistic that has left medical experts perplexed. 
</P>
<P>
Draaijer's death has become the catalyst for an official examination of the 
Netherlands' cycling program. The Royal Dutch Cycling Federation hopes to find 
clues to a mystery that has the international medical community's attention. 
</P>
<P>
At the forefront are rumors that cyclists are using a genetically engineered 
kidney-disease drug to enhance performances. Some physicians are concerned that 
the drug, which the body also produces naturally as a hormone, is somehow 
linked to the deaths, but research does not indicate that. 
</P>
<P>
The drug, erythropoietin (EPO), can be used as a simple alternative to what is 
known as blood doping. EPO stimulates red-blood cells to increase their output 
of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin. 
</P>
<P>
The practice of blood doping involves the removal of two or three pints of 
blood about two months before competition, and freezing the red-blood cells. 
Before competition, the red-blood cells are thawed and injected into the 
system. The boost of red-blood cells increases oxygen supply to the muscles. 
Laboratory and field studies show gains in endurance of about 5% from this 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Rob J. Pluijmers, a sportsmedicine doctor involved with Dutch cyclists for 15 
years, admitted last week in Salt Lake City that he knows three professionals 
taking EPO, a recombinant hormone used to treat anemia. He refused to name the 
athletes, but this is the first official acknowledgement that athletes are 
using the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Pluijmers, however, denied that any of the 15 deaths could be attributed to 
erythropoietin. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason to think EPO use is involved," said Pluijmers who was 
visiting the United States to speak to colleagues at the American College of 
Sports Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Pluijmers said the cyclists he knows using the drug are from the Netherlands 
and Belgium. He said the three got the drug from sources in Belgium. One 
athlete, he said, was taking the drug to treat a medical problem, but the 
others were using it to enhance performance. 
</P>
<P>
EPO is not yet registered in the Netherlands, although it is widely approved 
throughout Europe. The Food and Drug Administration approved its use in the 
United States last June. Amgen, a Thousand Oaks firm, developed the drug here. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, physicians and pharmacologists stated their concerns about the 
abuse of erythropoietin among athletes such as cyclists and distance runners 
who would benefit from blood doping. 
</P>
<P>
In October of 1989, Dr. Bjorn Ekblom of Stockholm's Institute of Gymnastics and 
Sport, reported that eight Swedish athletes increased their endurance by 10% 
after using erythropoietin during a study. 
</P>
<P>
Ekblom, credited with discovering blood doping in 1972, said at the time: "This 
makes it hard to believe in sports' future." 
</P>
<P>
Ekblom's skepticism is shared by many in the medical community who suspect 
widespread EPO abuse, although it may be years before they can prove it. 
</P>
<P>
E. Randy Eichner, a professor of medicine at Oklahoma State University, said 
there is no way to differentiate between what the body produces and the 
synthetic drug. 
</P>
<P>
Although banned by the International Olympic Committee, it is virtually 
impossible to detect. Researchers say that the injectable drug leaves the body 
within hours although the oxygen-rich red-blood cells remain for months. 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturer of Epogen, the trademark name for EPO, has been asked to add a 
genetic marker, making detection possible in a drug test, said James C. Puffer, 
a U.S. Olympic Committee physician from UCLA. But Eichner said the industry is 
reluctant for fear of customer complaints over any alterations. 
</P>
<P>
"This could make blood doping obsolete," said Connie Carpenter-Phinney, a 1984 
Olympic gold medalist in cycling who was not involved in the U.S. cycling 
team's blood-doping scandal that became public after the Los Angeles Games. 
</P>
<P>
The major concern with EPO is what effects it causes in high dosages. 
Physicians believe it can cause the blood to become so thick that the heart can 
no longer pump it. The result would be a heart attack, stroke or blood clot, 
doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
The drug is considered safe when used properly, and research has not shown any 
link to sudden cardiac arrest. But as with early studies of anabolic steroids, 
researchers have not examined the drug's effects when taken in high dosages, as 
athletes might be likely to do. 
</P>
<P>
Although doctors have no evidence of EPO use by U.S. athletes, the USOC's 
Puffer believes it is a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to know, but I think it is one of our major concerns besides 
steroids," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Eichner, a blood specialist, "I predict this will be bigger than steroid 
use for some athletes." 
</P>
<P>
In the Netherlands, Pluijmers said that autopsies did not offer any clues in 
the rash of deaths. He added, though, that toxicological tests were not 
administered. 
</P>
<P>
Draaijer, the Dutch pro who died last February while sleeping, had competed in 
the Sicilian Week stage race the week of Feb. 18, the start of the spring 
cycling season. 
</P>
<P>
He fell during the start of competition and complained of a headache and nausea 
afterward. But Draaijer, who had been one of the Netherlands' best 
professionals in recent years, returned three days later to compete after 
receiving medical approval. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, he was dead. 
</P>
<P>
Pluijmers said Draaijer died of an aorta outflow disturbance. The flow of blood 
through the aortic valve, through which the blood flows out of the heart to the 
body, was obstructed. Pluijmers said the autopsy was not helpful in providing 
answers as to why, but Draaijer had traces of an echo in his heart two weeks 
before his death. 
</P>
<P>
Abnormal heart rhythms such as an echo are not uncommon but can indicate 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Pluijmers said the country's attitude changed after Draaijer's death. Officials 
finally called for an investigation after a hue and cry in the Dutch press. 
</P>
<P>
"The investigation is ruling out any kind of drug use, but you never know," 
Pluijmers said. "It is an unsolved mystery. We have investigated the top 50 
cyclists to have an idea of what kind of hearts are beating in these people." 
</P>
<P>
Pluijmers said they speculate that Dutch cyclists are starting strenuous 
exercise too young. He said the top pros and amateurs begin at age 8 to 10 and 
continue until 30. 
</P>
<P>
"We think there is a very big, thin heart, a very slow heart rate," he said. "I 
don't think that's so good. During sleep, (abnormal) beats can develop. If you 
have a very relaxed, thin heart, it can sort of flutter . . . causing a 
dysrhythmia." 
</P>
<P>
Cardiologists questioned that conclusion, citing many examples of healthy 
endurance athletes with slow heart rates. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the Dutch are not alone in their passion for cycling. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bengt Saltin of the University of Copenhagen said Danish cyclists have 
similar backgrounds to those in the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet, as far as I know, we have had one death over the years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cardiologists agree with Pluijmers that EPO may not be the culprit, but they 
say the situation is alarming. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Tim Noakes of the University of Cape Town in South Africa was astounded by 
the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"You tell me there are 15 deaths among cyclists, and I have to tell you 
immediately it is grossly abnormal," he said. "It is very unusual to have so 
many deaths in a defined population." 
</P>
<P>
Noakes said about one in 7,000 die of sudden cardiac arrest in a population of 
runners ranging in age from 15 to 55. 
</P>
<P>
"I would suggest something is going on, but I wouldn't think EPO is necessarily 
the factor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dutch officials expect to announce results of their investigation in six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Pluijmers said preliminary results show the causes of deaths as: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Four ischemic cases, which are usually traced to coronary artery disease. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Six post-viral cases in which a cold is suspected of causing 
cardiomyopathy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome that was diagnosed earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One aorta outflow disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the official Dutch conclusion on the way, this is one mystery that 
may not be unraveled for some time.

TALK OF DRESS CODE IRRITATES AGASSI; CHANG GOES 5 SETS

Does the First Amendment work in France? Does it cover pink tights? 
</P>
<P>
Andre Agassi struck a blow for freedom of speech as it applies to tennis 
clothes Friday at the French Open, where he blasted his way into the fourth 
round with a 6-3, 6-2, 6-0 victory over Frenchman Arnaud Boetsch. 
</P>
<P>
That was all fairly routine. Then, in a rollicking postmatch news conference, 
Agassi blasted the French Tennis Federation and its president, Philippe 
Chatrier. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Tacky, tacky. Chatrier was guilty of trying to censor Agassi's closet, 
thus becoming Agassi's Mr. Blackwell. 
</P>
<P>
Chatrier said his group is considering a dress code that would ban such 
colorful garb as the faded black shorts and "hot lava" tights worn by Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
He is considering adopting a "predominantly white" clothing rule for the French 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
Chatrier and the French Tennis Federation are "bozos," said Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
Chatrier is also the president of the International Tennis Federation, which 
governs the Grand Slam events, the Davis Cup and Olympic competition. 
</P>
<P>
"There is growing concern about this issue," Chatrier said in a statement 
released to the media during Agassi's match. "If players go too far in their 
attire, then something will have to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Agassi said he doesn't like it when someone tampers with his wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
"Those bozos will look for anyone to talk about," he said. "Let them talk. It's 
some dull guys sitting behind a desk." 
</P>
<P>
If it gets bad enough that the French Open stows his wardrobe on a hanger, then 
Agassi said he may not be back. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be enough to consider if I'd play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi's sartorial rage against the Establishment became the day's unexpected 
highlight, certainly a lot more interesting than his match against Boetsch, a 
qualifier ranked No. 263, to Agassi's No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Michael Chang had anything but a routine day. The defending 
champion dropped the first two sets to Christian Bergstrom of Sweden, then won 
nine consecutive games as Bergstrom faded. Chang eventually won in 3 hours 42 
minutes, 2-6, 5-7, 6-0, 6-2, 6-4. He will meet Javier Sanchez of Spain in the 
fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
Even when he was down two sets, Chang felt strangely relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of felt like no one expected me to come back and win, so it took a 
little pressure off," Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his defeat, Bergstrom was not totally sold on Chang's chances of 
retaining his title. 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible, but I think it will be very tough for him," Bergstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Courier's chances do not get any easier now that he has reached the fourth 
round. His opponent: Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as Courier finished off Swedish-born Aussie Johan Anderson, 6-0, 6-2, 
6-1, in a third-round match, he turned toward Coach Sergio Cruz and held up 
three fingers. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz, who left the Nick Bollettieri Academy with Courier to strike out on their 
own, said the 19-year-old Floridian is a better player than he was at last 
year's French Open. 
</P>
<P>
"He's steadier, he's a bit more patient, he's mixing up his game," Cruz said. 
"Last year, he was going for everything. This year, he is more concerned about 
saving himself for when it is important." 
</P>
<P>
And what could be more important than beating Agassi? 
</P>
<P>
Courier did just that in the third round a year ago when he won a four-set 
match carried over a day because of darkness. Afterward, Courier said he felt 
he was playing in Agassi's shadow at the tennis academy, where Bollettieri 
showered most of his attention on prize pupil Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi responded by saying that Courier had "an inferiority complex," and a 
feud was born. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't wait to play him," Courier said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Courier has gone out of his way to downplay any resentment toward 
Agassi, who has remained with Bollettieri. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, we're always going to be something of rivals because of our age 
similarities, growing up as juniors and being pros together," Courier said. 
"Nobody likes to lose, and that goes for when I play Andre." 
</P>
<P>
Cruz explained Courier's feelings about Agassi: "He wants a place in the sun, 
and Andre is in the way." 
</P>
<P>
And Agassi does not plan to move. In fact, he handicapped his match with 
Courier with more than his usual swagger. "I feel, to say the least, very 
confident," Agassi said. "The longer it goes, the less his chances are." 
</P>
<P>
As for Agassi's chance to continue wearing the clothes of his choice in the 
fashion capital of the world, well, let's just say he may not have to alter his 
plans yet. 
</P>
<P>
There are no rules in place to cover permissible color of clothing except at 
Wimbledon, where "predominantly white" is the law. And as we know, Agassi does 
not play at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
So what if "predominantly white" becomes the rule at the French Open? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, well, that will be one Grand Slam tournament less to play next year," said 
Agassi, who said fans should be the decision-makers in matters of acceptable 
tennis clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi said he disdains wearing all-white tennis clothes. "I have to be honest, 
that's tough for me to do," he said. "I'd still be the same person, but I'd 
look more boring." 
</P>
<P>
Colorful clothes have their place, Agassi said. They are fine on the court, but 
when he hits the streets, Agassi dresses down to avoid attracting attention. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi said he does not like to stand out in Paris, so instead he tries to 
blend in. 
</P>
<P>
"I dress like (Ivan) Lendl," he said. 
</P>
<P>
French Open Notes 
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf, who pulled out of doubles competition because of sinusitis, got a 
break Friday when her third-round singles match against Sandra Cecchini was 
called off. Graf's match was to have been the fourth on center court, but it 
was scratched for the day when the one before hers, Yannick Noah vs. Guillermo 
Perez-Roldan, was still going at 7:15 p.m. because of rain delays. When that 
match was finally suspended because of rain, Perez-Roldan led, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 
4-6. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-seeded Gabriela Sabatini needed only 56 minutes to beat Nathalie 
Herreman, 6-0, 6-1, and reach the fourth round. Sabatini was to have been 
Graf's doubles partner. "It is better that I concentrate on singles anyway," 
Sabatini said. She will play Jana Novotna in the fourth round. Ninth-seeded 
Conchita Martinez advanced to a fourth-round meeting with Wiltrud Probst, who 
upset Zina Garrison in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Eighth-seeded Andrei Chesnokov, who will play Henri Leconte in the fourth 
round, was as quirky as usual Friday. Chesnokov beat Jordi Arrese in straight 
sets, then said he would only answer questions pertaining to the match. "I want 
to go to the small swimming pool now," he said. "Then I want to take rest in 
hotel. Nothing special. No drugs at all."

NEWSWIRE: SUSPENSION OF ROBINSON IS UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bobby Brown, president of the American League, upheld his three-game suspension 
of Baltimore Oriole Manager Frank Robinson Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension began with Baltimore's game Friday night against the Yankees in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson had appealed the suspension Thursday and met with Brown to discuss the 
incident that occurred May 28 in Minnesota. Robinson was ejected from that game 
by umpire Drew Coble and was suspended for his actions on the field and 
postgame comments in which he called the umpire "a liar" and "a no-good human 
being." 
</P>
<P>
Brown suspended him the next day for "physical contact with the umpire, use of 
abusive language, delay of the game and inappropriate postgame remarks to the 
press." Robinson's appeal delayed the suspension.

MOTORCYCLE RACING / AMERICAN SPEEDWAY FINAL; 
</P>
<P>
ROAD TO WORLD TITLE LEADS THROUGH LONG BEACH 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speedway motorcyclist Ronnie Correy was the only American to advance to the 
world championships last year in Munich, West Germany, but the 23-year-old 
rider from Fullerton never expected to be a factor in the pressure-packed race. 
</P>
<P>
Correy figured that his inexperience and a broken right wrist would be too much 
to overcome in the only motorcycle racing event that crowns its world champion 
on one night of competition. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, Correy finished in a four-way tie for eighth place in the 16-rider 
field, but he thinks the experience of three qualifying rounds and the 
championship race will help him get a return ticket to the World Final in 
Bradford, England, on Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Correy begins the long road to the 1990 World Final at 8 tonight in the 
American Speedway Final at Long Beach Veterans Stadium, where 20 riders will 
compete for four spots in the Overseas Final on June 24 in Coventry, England. 
</P>
<P>
"I rode basically to get the experience, and there was no pressure on me last 
year," Correy said. "I hurt my wrist in a test series against England at Belle 
Vue and then broke it in the last qualifier at Bradford. But nothing was going 
to keep me from riding in the World Final." 
</P>
<P>
During the off-season, Correy had tendons and joints repaired and two metal 
plates placed in his right wrist. He declined three offers to compete in 
Australia and New Zealand, preferring to allow his wrist to heal. 
</P>
<P>
The layoff didn't hurt. Correy has become one of the top riders in the British 
Speedway League this season at Wolverhampton. He opened with a league-leading 
10.19 average, out of a possible 12 points, and he currently has an 8.97 
average. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in the best shape of my life," he said. "I joined a health club in 
Tewkesbury and started lifting weights and bicycling. My wrist was hurting for 
two years, but I've never felt better." 
</P>
<P>
Correy, once a frail 5-foot-2, 110-pound teen-ager, has added 22 pounds by 
lifting weights and has bulked considerably in his upper body. He recently 
bought a home in Tewkesbury and plans to ride overseas "at least six more 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Correy was the hard-luck rider in the 1988 American Final. He appeared to have 
a berth clinched with 12 points after four races but blew an engine while 
leading his fifth race and failed to score a point, finishing sixth. The top 
five riders advanced. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he tied Sam Ermolenko and Shawn Moran with 19 points each but 
finished third in a four-lap runoff. Correy is the only rider to beat Ermolenko 
on Long Beach's quarter-mile track in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
"I've raced all over the world, and Long Beach has always been one of my 
favorite tracks," Correy said. "The track is always well prepared, and I like 
the long distance going into the first turn. 
</P>
<P>
"This is definitely the toughest qualifier in the world. Only four riders will 
get through, and one mechanical problem can finish you. Look what happened to 
me two years ago. I won three races, finished second in another and then blew 
an engine while leading my last race and was out." 
</P>
<P>
Correy is competing overseas for the fourth season. He traditionally had 
problems with his starts because his weight did not allow him to get traction 
on the dirt. But being light allowed him to maintain top speeds on the 
straightaways. 
</P>
<P>
Most observers say Correy's success has been because of his extraordinary 
balance on the lightweight Weslake speedway bike that will produce top speeds 
of 85 m.p.h. in Long Beach. Correy spent countless hours refining his skills on 
practice tracks at Saddleback Park and Indian Dunes and attended new-rider 
schools taught by Bruce Penhall and Mike Bast. 
</P>
<P>
He developed into a two-time U.S. junior speedway champion in 1983-84 under the 
guidance of Bill Hancock and became one of Southern California's top Division I 
riders as a 19-year-old senior at Fullerton High School in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Correy competed in his first U.S. championships at Costa Mesa in 1986 and then 
signed with Wolverhampton, where he was teamed with Ermolenko, the most 
successful American rider overseas in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"Racing overseas has been just about everything I expected it to be," Correy 
said. "I miss my family, but I love living in the country. I started riding in 
a league in Sweden twice a week, so my schedule has been pretty hectic. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal is to win the world championship. I'm living and working in another 
part of the world for eight months and have dedicated myself to winning the 
title."

LOS ALAMITOS: THE YEAR'S TOP THOROUGHBRED JOCKEY WILL RIDE LIGHTLY REGARDED 
RAISED TOPERFECTION IN QUARTER HORSE RACE.

Gary Stevens, the year's leading thoroughbred jockey with purses of $5.7 
million, will ride a quarter horse, Raised Toperfection, tonight in the 
$233,000 Kindergarten Futurity at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, 27, got his start in racing by riding quarter horses in his native 
Idaho, but it has been six years since his last appearance on a Los Alamitos 
quarter horse program, when he rode Bunny Bidajett to a third-place finish in 
the Thoroughbred Jockey Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Bob Baffert, who has doubled as a quarter horse and thoroughbred 
trainer during the past year, asked Stevens to ride Raised Toperfection in the 
350-yard race. 
</P>
<P>
"Gary had always told me that if I ever needed a rider in one of the big races 
at Los Alamitos, he'd love to come over and ride," Baffert said Friday. "He 
told me he'd always wanted to win a big quarter horse race. I told him he'll 
have his work cut out for him winning this race, but he said no problem." 
</P>
<P>
Raised Toperfection will be a longshot. The favorites in the Grade I event 
figure to be Bay Meadows Futurity winner Takin On the Cash, Leo Handicap winner 
Miss Strikin Jet and fastest Kindergarten qualifier Jacks Special Gem. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the Kindergarten will earn $84,740 for about 18 seconds' work. 
</P>
<P>
The complete Kindergarten field with jockeys, from the inside post: 
Splitsville, Lute Proctor; Ramtac, Roman Figueroa; Femmes Flam, Steve Treasure; 
Cash N Cara, Alvin Brosette; Resolutions, Kip Didericksen; Ms Bush Whacker, 
John Creager; Takin On the Cash, Danny Cardoza; Miss Strikin Jet, Bruce 
Pilkenton; Jacks Special Gem, Eddie Garcia, and Raised Toperfection, Gary 
Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
The Kindergarten will be the second ride of the night for Stevens. Baffert has 
also named him on Kite in the Sky, a $5,000 claimer, in the seventh race. 
</P>
<P>
"If he wants to ride in a $200,000 race (the Kindergarten), he has to ride the 
claimer; that's the price he has to pay," Baffert joked. 
</P>
<P>
The Kindergarten will be the ninth race on the 12-race program. First post is 
7:25 p.m.

MONTANA IS SAID TO AGREE TO PACT FOR $14 MILLION

Joe Montana, who has quarterbacked the San Francisco 49ers to four Super Bowl 
titles, has reached agreement on a contract extension that would pay him $4.5 
million next season and about $14 million for four years, The National reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Montana would become the highest-paid player in team sports, 
surpassing the $3.86 million per year of Don Mattingly of the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
The National said the contract, which would include bonus payments, apparently 
has not been signed. 
</P>
<P>
Montana made a base salary of $1.2 million last season, and without a contract 
extension, he would earn $2.55 million per year the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
According to The National, the contract provides for decreasing earnings, 
scaling down to $4 million in 1991, $3.5 million in 1992 and $2.5 million in 
1993.

MULTIYEAR DEAL LURES FERRY TO NBA

The NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers coaxed Danny Ferry back from Italy, signing him 
to a multiyear contract Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the deal were not revealed, but the former Duke star's contract with 
the Cavaliers was thought to be worth at least $2.5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry made $2 million last season with Il Messaggero Roma in the Italian 
professional basketball league. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry played in Italy last year rather than sign with the Clippers. The 
Clippers had made him the second selection in last June's NBA draft. Sacramento 
took Louisville's Pervis Ellison with the first pick. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland got the rights to Ferry in a trade that sent Ron Harper and three 
draft picks to the Clippers in November. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a very high regard for Danny Ferry as a player," Cleveland General 
Manager Wayne Embry said. "I felt that he should have been the No. 1 pick in 
last year's draft, and that he would have been the first pick in this year's 
draft." 
</P>
<P>
In the trade last November, the Clippers got Cleveland's first-round picks in 
1990 and '92, and a second-round pick in 1991. The Cavaliers, besides getting 
the rights to Ferry, got Reggie Williams, who was later released. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry had to advise Il Messaggero Roma before July 1 whether he would be 
returning next season. 
</P>
<P>
In four years at Duke, the 6-foot-10, 230-pound Ferry averaged 15.1 points and 
seven rebounds a game. As a senior, he averaged 22.6 points and 7.4 rebounds.

TWO WILL CHALLENGE SUNDAY SILENCE 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Tatham stopped by trainer Charlie Whittingham's barn at Hollywood Park to 
see the new, improved Sunday Silence. 
</P>
<P>
Tatham would rather be racing the 4-year-colt than rooting for him, but at 
least he has the satisfaction of having bred last year's horse of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Pam Mabes, Sunday Silence's exercise rider, took Tatham and a friend over to 
the stall of the near-black colt. Those who remember Sunday Silence from last 
year are taken aback when they see him now. 
</P>
<P>
"He is awesome looking," said Arthur Hancock, who after taking Sunday Silence 
from Tatham kept the young horse when buyers wouldn't bid more than $32,000 for 
him at two auctions. 
</P>
<P>
February was the first time Hancock had seen Sunday Silence since his victory 
over Easy Goer in the Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream Park in November. 
</P>
<P>
"The change in his appearance was unbelievable," Hancock said. "He's gained 
about 100 pounds, and he's so much broader and stronger. He's now a 
powerful-looking horse, similar to the way Easy Goer looks."

Easy Goer might have won the beauty contests last year, but it was Sunday 
Silence who won most of the races. Sunday Silence beat Easy Goer in both the 
Kentucky Derby and the Preakness before losing to him in the Belmont, then 
clinched horse-of-the-year honors by outrunning Easy Goer for the third time 
and winning the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Arlington International will put up a $1-million purse Aug. 4 if both Sunday 
Silence and Easy Goer race. Last Saturday, Easy Goer ran third, behind Criminal 
Type and Housebuster, in the Metropolitan Handicap at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, who underwent arthroscopic knee surgery for the removal of two 
bone chips 12 days after the Breeders' Cup, will make his first appearance this 
year Sunday, in the $300,000 Californian at 1 1/8 miles. Because of Sunday 
Silence, the race has drawn only three starters. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence's opponents -- Charlatan III and Stylish Winner -- have won one 
race in 26 starts in the last year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
"My horse has four legs, just like (Sunday Silence)," said Hector Palma, who 
trains the Chilean-bred Charlatan III. "Look at what happened to Easy Goer, he 
got beat. People might be saying I'm crazy, but things happen. My horse is 
improving, and should run a good race, and the other horse is coming back from 
a layoff." 
</P>
<P>
Charlatan III, who will be ridden by Julio Garcia, will carry 111 pounds, 15 
less than Sunday Silence, whose jockey will be Chris McCarron. Stylish Winner, 
with Corey Black aboard, will carry 115 pounds under race conditions that 
determine weight by money won. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence has eight victories and four second-place finishes in 12 starts, 
with earnings of $4.5 million. He has lost twice at Hollywood Park, in an 
allowance race against Houston as a 2-year-old and against Prized in last 
year's Swaps Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
"He should be just as good as he was," said McCarron, who has been riding 
Sunday Silence in his recent workouts. "He's coming along beautifully. He's 
filled out and he's put on some muscle." 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham's plans are for Sunday Silence to run in the $1-million Hollywood 
Gold Cup on June 24, then the Arlington race and finally a fall campaign that 
would set him up for another try in the Breeders' Cup, which this year will be 
at Easy Goer's home track, Belmont Park, Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
There has been a change in ownership since Sunday Silence last ran, Japanese 
breeder Zenya Yoshida having joined the colt's original partners, Hancock, 
Whittingham and Ernest Gaillard, a retired surgeon from La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
In March, after unsuccessfully trying to buy Sunday Silence outright, Yoshida 
bought 25% of the colt for a reported $2.25 million. Hancock now owns 37.5%, 
Gaillard has 20% and Whittingham owns 17.5%. Whittingham will continue to 
manage Sunday Silence's racing career and Hancock will take over once the horse 
is retired to stud, probably next year. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
There will be only win and $2 exacta betting on the Californian, which has been 
won by Charlie Whittingham 10 times, most recently with Judge Angelucci in 
1987. . . . In Charlatan III's last start, he went off at 35-1 and lost by a 
head to Super May in the Mervyn LeRoy Handicap. . . . Stylish Winner was fifth 
in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Bob Levy, a visitor at Hollywood Park Friday morning, said that 
Housebuster would be given two months of rest after his second-place finish 
against Criminal Type in the Metropolitan Handicap. Housebuster's next start is 
scheduled to be the seven-furlong King's Bishop at Saratoga Aug. 18, followed 
by the Vosburgh at Belmont Park Sept. 29 and the Breeders' Cup Sprint Oct. 27. 
"The horse has had a tremendous amount of racing," Levy said. "Sometimes he 
wins easy, but he still runs very fast and that takes something out of a 
horse." 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Ron McAnally will send Silver Ending, fifth in the Kentucky Derby 
Derby, to Canterbury Downs for the $300,000 St. Paul Derby June 23. McAnally 
plans to run Bayakoa at Hollywood June 16 in the Milady Handicap, a race the 
mare won last year. "We're still thinking about trying Silver Ending on the 
grass," McAnally said. "But the Canterbury race looks like one he'll have a 
good chance to win." McAnally has no race in mind for Hawkster after his 
second-place finish in the Hollywood Turf Handicap.

MISTER FRISKY FIGHTS FOR LIFE IN NEW JERSEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mister Frisky, the Santa Anita Derby winner whose 16-race winning streak ended 
in the Kentucky Derby and who then finished a distant third in the Preakness, 
is fighting for his life in a New Jersey clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Fritz, a Long Island, N.Y., veterinarian who is treating Mister Frisky 
in Clarksburg, N.J., said Friday that the colt "is undergoing intensive therapy 
for a severe abscess of the throat that ruptured." 
</P>
<P>
Fritz listed Mister Frisky's condition as serious and guarded. 
</P>
<P>
"The horse is giving it a strong fight," Fritz said. "He is battling as hard 
now as he ever did on the track." 
</P>
<P>
After running eighth as the Derby favorite May 5, Mister Frisky finished more 
than 11 lengths behind Summer Squall in the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
Shipped from Pimlico to Belmont Park a couple of days after the Preakness, 
Mister Frisky developed a fever before the abscess was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Laz Barrera said that at one point there was a danger that the horse 
might develop pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky, who won his first 13 races in Puerto Rico before adding three 
more victories under Barrera at Santa Anita, had been scheduled to run in the 
Belmont, the final Triple Crown race, a week from today. 
</P>
<P>
"Mister Frisky had an abscess that grew to the size of a grapefruit," Fritz 
said. "It is down to about the size of a tennis ball now." 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky, who has been treated with antibiotics, has lost about 100 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"At least he is swallowing water now," said Barrera, who is keeping in touch 
with Fritz from the trainer's barn at Hollywood Park. "But he still can't eat 
because of this condition. He's mad, because he wants to eat." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens, Mister Frisky's jockey, attributed his performance in the 
Kentucky Derby to a dislike for the track at Churchill Downs. But after another 
dull performance in the Preakness, Stevens was puzzled. 
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that the infection might have been bothering Mister 
Frisky before the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about that," Barrera said. "He looked so good in Kentucky. We 
checked his temperature every day, and there was never any fever. Anybody who 
saw him in Kentucky can't believe he's sick now, because he looked so good 
there."

BALLET REVIEW;

<P>
A FINE BRITISH 'BEAUTY' AWAKENS IN HOUSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC/DANCE CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HOUSTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ballet may be ailing in Southern California, but it seems to be enjoying the 
best of health -- artistic as well as financial -- deep in the heart of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The Houston Ballet, which bills itself as the fourth largest dance company in 
America, attained professional status only in 1969. Under Ben Stevenson, the 
British choreographer who assumed leadership 14 years ago, Houston has 
developed a versatile ensemble that even can dance, when the occasion warrants, 
in a reasonably Royal manner. 
</P>
<P>
Now elegantly ensconced at the Wortham Center, the 49-member company operates 
with an annual budget of $9 million. Houston Ballet claims to enjoy the largest 
endowment of any comparable institution in the country. Texans, we are 
reminded, think big. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson and friends are thinking big these days with a splendid new 
production of "The Sleeping Beauty," staged in commemoration of the 100th 
anniversary of the St. Petersburg premiere. The local price tag: a mere 
$757,000. 
</P>
<P>
The director's friends in this instance turned out to be advocates of an 
enlightened British, as opposed to Russian, tradition. Desmond Heeley, the 
designer, created pastel images that often invoked the historic Sadler's Wells 
decors of Oliver Messel. To complement the obvious nostalgic impulses, 
Stevenson imported a special coach from London via Panama: Margot Fonteyn. 
</P>
<P>
In her time, this Beauty probably was the most beautiful of them all. Her 
presence here ensured refinement of detail and reinforced an authentic 
aristocratic aura amid the high American spirits. 
</P>
<P>
The production, wildly cheered by a full house on Thursday, represents a 
triumph of dedication and style. The scale may be a bit small in the corps 
scenes -- Stevenson reduced the Garland Waltz, for instance, to a rather 
perfunctory peasant divertissement -- and virtuosity cannot be taken for 
granted on all levels. Heeley's generally handsome sets teeter from time to 
time on the brink of candy-box kitsch. Nevertheless, this "Beauty" is 
marvelously poignant at best, merely picturesque at worst. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike his Soviet colleagues, Stevenson is careful about telling the story. He 
makes pointed use of mime. He revels in the fairy-tale antics of the wedding 
celebration, and, abetted by Heeley, lets no one forget that the intermission 
between Acts I and II spans a full century. 
</P>
<P>
His choreographic scheme respects the customary modified-Petipa formulas in all 
the important places. This, however, does not preclude some imaginative 
innovations. 
</P>
<P>
Most notable among them is the promotion of Carabosse from a caricature drag 
crone to a dangerous ballerina who actually dances en pointe. The interestingly 
evil fairy in this version becomes a not-so-distant cousin of the Black Swan. 
As such, she also becomes a sensible, formidable counterforce for the 
goody-goody Lilac Fairy. It is a nice touch. 
</P>
<P>
If Houston has a prima ballerina, she must be Janie Parker. One of four 
alternating Auroras, she burst into the party scene on Thursday with innocent 
radiance and then made time stand still with the balances of the Rose Adagio. 
The only serious problem here: an odd pink tutu with puffy-gauzy sleeves that 
compromised the perception of her line. 
</P>
<P>
Parker went on to define the mysteries of the Vision Scene with genuine lyric 
suavity, and she plunged into the fishdives of the grand pas de deux with 
reckless abandon. This was a promising performance by a major artist. 
</P>
<P>
She was partnered with gentle security and princely ardor by Li Cunxin, a noble 
Houston danseur from Tsing Tao in the People's Republic of China. If only he 
happened to be a few inches taller . . . 
</P>
<P>
Kristine Richmond exerted magnetism in the flamboyantly nasty maneuvers 
concocted for Carabosse (Stevenson likened the figure to Joan Collins in toe 
shoes). Rachel Jonell Beard, by comparison, seemed correct yet needlessly 
pallid as the Lilac Fairy. John Grensback and Martha Butler creditably stressed 
charm rather than bravura in the Bluebird pas de deux. 
</P>
<P>
The caractere specialists included three niftily athletic Ivans (Mark Arvin, 
Timothy O'Keefe and Li Anlin) and a genuinely seductive White Cat blessed with 
terrific legs (Susan Bryant). The assorted, hard-working fairies, nymphs, 
cavaliers and courtiers attested to good schooling, a few passing gaffes 
notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Terence Kern, the British guest-conductor, attended to Tchaikovsky efficiently 
and accommodated the dancers sympathetically. The pit seemed a bit 
understaffed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Los Angeles . . .

SCHULLER'S PLEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the May 24 Morning Report item on the Rev. Robert H. Schuller saying 
he will end his "Hour of Power" TV ministry unless viewers send in $3.2 million 
to cover debts: I am reminded of the boy who cried wolf. 
</P>
<P>
I have been watching "Hour of Power" since 1974 and was a telephone counselor 
for the ministry for five years. 
</P>
<P>
This is at least the 20th time Schuller has conducted a five-week fund-raising 
drive in which he has threatened to pull the plug. Maybe after 1,056 telecasts, 
it's time that plug was pulled. Either that or let him sell commercial spots to 
Chevrolet, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Schuller wrote a book with his son on principles of money management. Why can't 
he balance his own budget?

SEX AND SINGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why, in his positive review of the Lisa Stansfield concert (May 26), does Chris 
Willman include the comments she "can't dance to save her life" and she doesn't 
have "overwhelming" sex appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Stansfield's performance isn't built around dancing -- so what? She chose a 
neutral outfit that doesn't distract from her explosive vocal performance -- so 
what? Such comments only serve to perpetuate the destructive cliche -- 
engendered by MTV -- that a female singer must wrap her talent in cheap 
sexuality and innuendo.

REACTION TO ANTIVIVISECTION 'ADVER-TORIAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The media have been notoriously pro-vivisection, because the powers that be 
want it that way. 
</P>
<P>
Big business rides on funds for animal research. The chemical companies and 
their sister pharmaceutical companies, together with manufacturers that test 
products on animals, sponsor many of our television shows and place costly ads 
in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
I was amazed at The Times' unbiased portrayal of this long-overdue commercial 
and the SUPRESS organization in general.

REACTION TO ANTIVIVISECTION 'ADVER-TORIAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About "TV 'Adver-torial' Makes Fur Fly" (Greg Braxton, May 24), on Students 
United Protesting Research on Sentient Subjects (SUPRESS) and its 
antivivisection commercial: 
</P>
<P>
It's amazing how many people are uninformed about vivisection. This is such an 
important issue and yet the laboratories strive to keep their activities 
secret. 
</P>
<P>
Only by hiding can they continue their mass torture and slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Does anyone in media-savvy Los Angeles still fall for the 
"we-have-a-responsibility-to-the-public" line handed out by Robert Blagman, 
local sales manager of KCOP Channel 13 (which refused to broadcast the 
commercial)? 
</P>
<P>
Is it necessary to remind programming executives of the rash of 
sensationalistic TV-tabloid news shows? Violence? Sexploitation? 
</P>
<P>
Also implicit in the attitudes of stations refusing to run the eye-opening 
commercial produced by Javier Burgos is that we viewers can't handle disturbing 
information (bloodied corpses on nightly newscasts notwithstanding!). 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps even more important, the "suits" are once again underestimating the 
intelligence of viewers.

PERFORMANCE ART REVIEW;

<P>
PREMIERE OF ELGART AND GLASSMAN'S 'ZOO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA PERLMUTTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To passers-by on Main Street who stopped for a few minutes to watch, it must 
have seemed like a mini-spectacle or a curiosity. To an audience seated in the 
courtyard of the Santa Monica Art Museum it was a performance art pageant, 
merging elements of Renaissance entertainment with Kabuki. 
</P>
<P>
But for creators Sara Elgart and Stephan Glassman, who Thursday offered the 
premiere of "Zoo," the hourlong work was meant as "a meditation on the 
geography of power and the politics of control." 
</P>
<P>
Only in the loosest sense could one be so persuaded, however, for the points, 
inchoate when not simplistic, got lost in the staging effort. 
</P>
<P>
To Elgart's credit, the dance elements boasted a certain concise strength. They 
ranged from a series of gesture-semaphores, a la Pina Bausch, to more elaborate 
turns, high leg kicks and full-body extensions -- all performed in unison by a 
17-member dancing chorus, representing a global assortment of society 
(urbanites, peasants, hipsters). 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the troops or chorus had little to apostrophize. Their highly 
charged episodes came in response to the long, dull stretches carried out by 
three helmeted men on stilts. 
</P>
<P>
First, these antagonists menaced each other to the industrial drone of Ed 
Tomney's sound score. Then they hoisted themselves to their respective 
wood-frame apparatuses -- eagle, bear, snake -- and lumbered about. Not much of 
a statement on power politics. 
</P>
<P>
It must be that the process, not the message, is the thing. Whichever, the 
finale brought the troops back in grand Hollywood style: the jaunty spirit of 
their coded maneuvers gave way to sentimentality by way of triumphant music. 
</P>
<P>
That it ended had to be indisputable triumph for some. DONNA PERLMUTTER

POP BEAT / COUNTRY: THERE'S A DROUGHT, BUT THREE NEWCOMERS SHOW PROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The search continues in country music. 
</P>
<P>
From the late '40s through mid-'70s, the country world produced so many great 
singers and records that it was easy for outsiders to underestimate the degree 
of artistry required. 
</P>
<P>
All you needed was a singer with character and conviction, instrumental backing 
that accented rather than diluted the emotion and a memorable song. The latter, 
preferably, included at least one easily quotable line. 
</P>
<P>
And there seemed no end of a supply of great artists: from Hank Williams and 
Lefty Frizzell to Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson, and from Kitty Wells and Patsy 
Cline to Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris. 
</P>
<P>
But the great artists and great records have now become the exception in 
country music. Only two mainstream Nashville figures have emerged in the last 
dozen or so years to even approach the consistency or vision of the singers 
cited above -- John Anderson and Randy Travis -- and both seemed more echoes of 
the earlier stars than breakthroughs. 
</P>
<P>
Two other, more recent arrivals, k.d. lang and Lyle Lovett, have shown 
exceptional promise, but both are mavericks who haven't been fully accepted in 
Nashville as part of the official country family. 
</P>
<P>
This lingering drought in country music is why so much attention in Nashville 
is focused these days on newcomers. Here's a look at some of the lastest 
country contenders. None joins the honor roll on the basis of these new albums, 
but there are some twinkles of promise. The albums are rated on a five-star 
scale, from one (poor) to five (a classic). 
</P>
<P>
*** Jann Browne's "Tell Me Why" (Curb) -- One reason the music of this veteran 
of Southern California honky-tonks seems so reminiscent of Emmylou Harris is 
that Steve Fishell, who used to play steel guitar in Harris' band, produced it 
and other musicians who have been associated with Harris play on the album. It 
also doesn't hurt that Harris sings harmony on one track. 
</P>
<P>
However, the main reason Browne makes you think of country music's most 
enchanting female singer is that Browne sings with a similar purity and sense 
of integrity as Harris. She, too, can can make a new song (her own "Mexican 
Wind," a soulful tale of romantic loss) feel like a classic or inject new life 
into an old favorite (Harlan Howard-Fuzzy Owen's "The One You Slip Around 
With"). Strong potential. 
</P>
<P>
*** Mark Collie's "Hardin County Line" (MCA) -- Collie would have been at home 
in country in the '50s, when rockabilly and honky-tonk shuffle were the rage. 
He sings both styles with a biting authenticity and is backed by a first-rate 
band that includes guitarist James Burton, who was Elvis Presley's guitarist 
for years. He also writes lots of quotable lines. 
</P>
<P>
Collie is a little too intent on touching all the thematic country bases 
(ramblin' fever, the old days), but most of his songs about relationships have 
a wry, bittersweet edge. In the opening track, Collie tells about stumbling 
home after working the all-night shift to find a note attached to the freezer: 
"The good news is she loves me / The bad news is she's gone." Elsewhere, he 
offers, "Now where there's smoke, you'll find my old flame." 
</P>
<P>
* 1/2 Alan Jackson's "Here in the Real World" (Arista) -- Jackson aims high. 
He's quoted on the inside sleeve of the album package as saying, "You know that 
country song, 'Who's Gonna Fill Them Shoes?' I don't know whether I can fill 
'em, but I'd sure like to try 'em on." In this debut collection, Jackson is off 
to a fast start commercially. The album has been in the country Top 10 since 
April 21. 
</P>
<P>
If he's truly hoping to fill the shoes of such country greats as George Jones, 
however, he's got a long way to go. The artist he most resembles (in cowboy-hat 
image and musical style) is contemporary Dwight Yoakam. 
</P>
<P>
Like the latter, Jackson is good at approximating emotion, but he doesn't show 
much original vision or musical soul. Selections such as "Blue Blooded Woman" 
have quotable lines, but they're mostly Nashville hokum. Sample: "She loves a 
violin, I love a fiddle / We go separate ways but we meet in the middle / Don't 
see eye to eye, but we're hand in hand / A blue-blooded woman and a red-neck 
man." 
</P>
<P>
* 1/2 Travis Tritt's "Country Club" (Warner Bros.) -- Joining Alan Jackson in 
the country Top 10 these days, Tritt is equally suspect. He deals in a 
harder-edged, semi-rock brand of country, suggesting his model is more Hank 
Williams Jr. than George Jones. There's a sense of drama in his singing and in 
the arrangements, but the themes -- as telegraphed in such song titles as "Son 
of the New South" and "The Road Home" -- have been part of the accepted country 
songbook for years. The singing is generally undistinguished, the arrangements 
are routine and the album's most quotable line comes from a song ("Country 
Club") that Tritt didn't write. 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 Kelly Willis' "Well Traveled Love" (MCA) -- This 21-year-old, 
Austin-based singer exudes such personality and spirit that she reminds you of 
the early promise of Lone Justice's Maria McKee, a point that wasn't lost on 
Carlyne Majer, who worked with Lone Justice and now manages Willis. 
</P>
<P>
Willis balances feelings of spunky optimism and lesson-learned caution so well 
in the opening track that you think the album is going to soar. While her voice 
continues to dazzle, the album is limited by often pedestrian instrumental 
backing and by too few top-notch songs. The next album may be the real test.

a.m. (2), will feature reports on conditions in China and the status of the 
student democracy movement one year after the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
Both programs will also provide extensive coverage of developments at the 
summit. 
</P>
<P>
Presidents Gorbachev and Bush are scheduled to appear together to answer 
questions from the Washington and foreign press corps Sunday at 7 a.m. The

With local basketball and hockey long done, baseball highlights the sports 
choices on TV this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Crucial is usually not an appropriate label to a series scheduled for the first 
week of June. 
</P>
<P>
But that designation does apply to the Dodgers-Cincinnati Reds matchup as the 
locals desperately seek to remain a credible pennant contender. SportsChannel 
will televise tonight's game at 7. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, no longer underachievers but overachievers, meet the Texas Rangers 
at 5:30 p.m. today on KTLA Channel 5. 
</P>
<P>
Finally beginning to meet their lofty preseason expectations, the San Diego 
Padres play host to the Atlanta Braves tonight at 7 (TBS and San Diego Cable 
Sports) and 1 p.m. Sunday on TBS. 
</P>
<P>
Two area college baseball teams will also make television appearances today. 
Cal State Fullerton faces Oklahoma State at 5 p.m. on ESPN. Cal State 
Northridge goes for the Division II championship against Jacksonville (Ala.)

HIMSELF

<P>
An Eagle Rock man on Thursday was shot and killed by his step-grandson, who 
then shot himself to death, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
James Penuela, 18, shot Euiogio Ayala, 65, apparently once in the head with a 
semi-automatic rifle, then shot himself in the head, said Detective Grover 
Randolph of the Northeast Division. Penuela's 10-year-old sister, who lived at 
Ayala's apartment in the 4600 block of Eagle Rock Boulevard, discovered the 
bodies when she came home from school, Randolph said. 
</P>
<P>
The youth apparently was angry about a dispute between the families of his 
mother and stepfather, who are divorced, the detective said.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A construction worker was shot to death Friday in the yard of a Rowland Heights 
home, allegedly by a man who was upset because the victim would not give him a 
ride, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, a 23-year-old City of Industry man, was shot once in the head as he 
worked in the side yard of the home in the 17900 block of Sunrise Drive. 
</P>
<P>
He was not identified pending notification of his family. 
</P>
<P>
Other construction workers witnessed the shooting, said Sgt. Joaquin Herran of 
the sheriff's Information Bureau. Authorities believe the suspect, whose 
identity was not determined, had argued with the victim about a ride on 
Thursday. The suspect drove away after the shooting and had not been found, 
Herran said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'WATER CONSERVATION DAY' DRAWS MIXED 
REVIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In case you missed it, Thursday was "Water Conservation Day" in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
And though it received little fanfare, proponents say it was a rousing success. 
</P>
<P>
Water consumption dropped by 22% Thursday, as compared with the same day last 
year. And that, according to City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, is a clear 
demonstration of residents' willingness to save water without mandatory 
rationing. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Tom Bradley, who is seeking to impose rationing this summer, said 
Flores is all wet. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ludicrous to make a decision about the future of the city and the supply 
of our water based on statistics from one day -- particularly when that day was 
unseasonably cool, and front lawns throughout Los Angeles were still damp from 
an unusual late-May rainstorm," Bradley said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PAINT-SPRAYING MACHINE EXPLODES, KILLING 
OPERATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A portable, high-pressure paint-spraying machine exploded at a furniture 
factory in Boyle Heights Friday morning, killing the man who was operating it. 
No other workers were believed to be injured seriously, although one was 
sprayed with paint. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said the cause of the explosion that killed Salvador Mendoza, 
about 45, was not immediately determined. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Oblea Prado, 28, a co-worker at the Benedetti Corp. furniture plant on 
East 12th Street, said the morning shift was just getting under way shortly 
after 8 a.m. when the explosion rocked the plant. "By the time I turned around 
he was dead," Prado said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Fire Department Battalion Chief Ray Olsen said Mendoza apparently 
was getting ready to refill the backpack device with paint when the machine's 
lid, which is bolted in place, blew off.

2 ARE KILLED AS SUSPECTS' TRUCK HITS CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men in a four-wheel-drive truck, fleeing from San Fernando police after 
shots were fired in a suspected gang attack, crashed broadside into a car in 
Mission Hills Friday night, killing two occupants and critically injuring a 
third, Los Angeles police reported. 
</P>
<P>
Both suspects were captured. 
</P>
<P>
Their identities were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began when police responded to a report that shots had been fired 
from a passing vehicle into a party at a house on Larue Street in Los Angeles, 
near San Fernando High School. It was not immediately clear if anyone at the 
party was hit by the shots. 
</P>
<P>
A patrolling San Fernando police officer heard the shots, drove to the scene, 
saw the truck and began the chase westward on Chatsworth Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Just over the Los Angeles city line in Mission Hills, the truck broadsided an 
auto heading south on Laurel Canyon Boulevard, severely damaging it, LAPD Sgt. 
Dennis Zine said. The crash occurred about 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
A man and a woman, who were not immediately identified, died at the scene. A 
third occupant of the car was taken to San Fernando Hospital in critical 
condition, Zine said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men in the truck tried to flee on foot but was caught, Zine said. 
</P>
<P>
The shots fired at the party were believed to be gang-related, Zine said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the suspects was hospitalized with a head injury, Zine said. The other 
was in custody at the Foothill Division police station. 
</P>
<P>
Police were seeking a second car, a Cadillac, which was also being chased when 
the crash occurred.

MALIBU STARS STAY IN WINGS DURING CITYHOOD STUMPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Malibu is the kind of place where being a celebrity isn't supposed to matter. 
</P>
<P>
In a town where lawyers, doctors and retired schoolteachers share neighborhoods 
with some of the entertainment industry's biggest names, people tend to think 
of themselves as equals. 
</P>
<P>
Some say that helps to explain why, with residents poised to decide Tuesday 
whether the community will become a city and to select a five-member city 
council, Malibu's celebrities have steered away from center stage when it comes 
to their town's politics. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who expected to see a battle of the stars (over Malibu's future) must 
really be disappointed," said Gary Amo, a political consultant for MCI/YES on 
Y, a pro-cityhood group. 
</P>
<P>
Stars such as Michael Landon, Olivia Newton-John and others are on record as 
favoring cityhood. And others, including Herb Alpert, Mel Brooks and George C. 
Scott, have given between $100 and $1,000 to support the cause. But most of the 
dozens of celebrities who call Malibu home have clearly avoided taking sides by 
endorsing city council candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"Many celebrities don't want to be in the middle," said Dr. Susan Reynolds, 
president of the Malibu Chamber of Commerce. "They like to show up and make a 
command performance if it's a cause where they can be helpful, but they don't 
like taking risks." 
</P>
<P>
Landon and Dick Van Dyke were guests at a cocktail reception sponsored in April 
by cityhood backers, with Landon making an impassioned speech in favor of 
incorporation. Others, including Rob Lowe and Martin Sheen, until recently 
Malibu's honorary mayor, made early public appearances to support 
incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
But as the focus has shifted from a community battle against county officials 
to rivalries over who will run the new city -- assuming cityhood is approved -- 
celebrity involvement has waned. It didn't help any when, several months ago, 
grass-roots cityhood supporters suggested it might help their cause if actors 
and actresses were less visible when they pleaded their case to county 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
"This is, after all, a small town," said Susan Shaw, a pro-cityhood activist. 
"Celebrities are used to being popular, and I think that goes against the grain 
of taking sides against your neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
Although some residents had thought, and some had secretly hoped, that an actor 
or two might run for office a la Mayor Clint Eastwood in Carmel, there is not a 
single star among the more than 30 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The only candidate remotely connected with show business is 36-year-old Mary 
Culbert, an actress who appears in TV commercials, and she prefers to emphasize 
her credentials as an attorney. Gene Wood, a TV game show announcer, dropped 
out of the race after officials at CBS expressed concern that they might have 
to provide air time to other candidates as a result of his appearances on 
"Family Feud." 
</P>
<P>
A few big stars, however, have gotten involved. 
</P>
<P>
Actor Rod Steiger is honorary campaign chairman for candidate Larry Wan, who, 
as a former head of the 2,000-member Malibu Township Council, a pro-cityhood 
group, is considered among the favorites in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Steiger, whose mother-in-law is Wan's political consultant, was the feature 
attraction at a party for Wan held two weeks ago for about 250 people at a 
private beach club. 
</P>
<P>
"I got involved because I resent the way the county has pushed Malibu around 
and I think Larry's the kind of guy who can help do something about it," the 
actor said. 
</P>
<P>
The same afternoon, at actor Burgess Meredith's beach house in the Malibu 
Colony, several celebrities, including Carroll O'Connor and Jack Klugman, were 
among the guests at a reception for Walt Keller, another pro-cityhood 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these candidates want to install Parisian sewers out here, and that's 
what I want to see stopped," said Meredith, who has taped a TV commercial for 
Keller that is being shown on a community cable channel. 
</P>
<P>
Other celebrities have lent their names to candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Kris Kristofferson, whose son attends school with the son of candidate Paul 
Shoop, is among Shoop's supporters. Actress Ali MacGraw, who no longer lives in 
Malibu but is a popular figure there as a result of her past civic involvement, 
wrote a letter endorsing candidate Mike Caggiano. 
</P>
<P>
Olivia Newton-John, TV producer Jerry Weintraub and his wife, actress Jane 
Morgan Weintraub, are supporting candidate Joan House. Several other 
celebrities, including Bob Newhart, O'Connor and James Whitmore, have donated 
money to one candidate or another. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, while those in the race who have celebrities in their corner say they're 
glad to have them, none of the candidates admit to seeking them out. Indeed, 
most appear uncomfortable even talking about the subject. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to have one or two celebrities backing you, but you don't want to 
overdo it, or it begins to look like your campaign is relying too much on 
glitz," said one city council hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
Others question whether involvement by big stars in a town accustomed to 
celebrities makes any difference. 
</P>
<P>
"People in other places won't understand this," said pro-cityhood activist 
Shaw, "but once you're used to seeing movie stars at the supermarket, they 
begin to lose their impact."MALIBU CITYHOOD: STARS' ROLES

DEAL NEAR TO PROTECT WETLANDS, LET PLAYA VISTA PLAN PROCEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tentative agreement has been reached on a complex land swap that would save 
most of the Ballona Wetlands from development and remove a major obstacle to 
construction of the massive Playa Vista project near Marina del Rey, officials 
on both sides of the deal said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary agreement, a result of many months of negotiations between 
state Controller Gray Davis and Maguire Thomas Partners, the Santa Monica 
development firm that is behind the Playa Vista project, provides protection 
for 60 acres of wetlands south of Ballona Creek. The proposal also calls for 
the state to sell 70 acres of open land on the north side of the creek to 
Maguire Thomas for $82.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
When the 60 acres of wetlands are coupled with more than 180 acres previously 
saved from development, nearly 250 acres of wetlands frequented by at least two 
endangered species of birds will be preserved and restored to their natural 
state. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been able to help protect and enhance a valuable and threatened 
environmental resource -- namely the Ballona Wetlands," Davis said in an 
interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Although details of the intricate transaction have yet to be finalized, Davis 
expressed optimism that the deal can be signed within 60 days. "I'm very 
pleased that we are on the verge of an environmental benefit that no one 
thought possible a couple of years ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas senior partner Nelson C. Rising refused to discuss details of 
the tentative pact but also expressed optimism that a final agreement is near. 
</P>
<P>
A condition of the deal is that Los Angeles County drop its insistence on 
extension of a street from Marina del Rey across the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides said the agreement should help settle a protracted legal battle over 
the wetlands that has blocked development of the vast Playa Vista residential, 
office, retail, hotel and marina project for six years. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed by Friends of Ballona Wetlands against the California 
Coastal Commission, the city of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County, challenged 
state and local government approval for the project. 
</P>
<P>
At stake in the litigation is the future of 887 acres of open land between 
Marina del Rey and the Westchester Bluffs long owned by industrialist Howard 
Hughes. The property, which includes an aircraft plant and air strip, extends 
inland nearly three miles from the coast to near the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
After Hughes' death in 1976, officials of his Summa Corp. began looking at 
development possibilities for the land. Summa received state and local 
government approval in 1984 to build a high-rise community on the land. The 
approval required about 180 acres of coastal land to be preserved as wetland. 
</P>
<P>
But Summa's development plans were stymied by the Friends' lawsuit, filed in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
In February of last year, Summa sold a controlling interest in the land -- one 
of the most valuable pieces of urban real estate in the nation -- to Maguire 
Thomas Partners and JMB Realty Corp. of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas immediately scrapped Summa's development plan, completely 
redesigned the Playa Vista project and launched intensive negotiations to 
settle a thicket of environmental and legal problems that had frustrated their 
predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
Rising, of Maguire Thomas, said the lawsuit has been a "very significant 
problem to overcome." 
</P>
<P>
The inch-thick settlement agreement calls for Maguire Thomas to turn over 60 
acres of wetlands west of Lincoln Boulevard and south of Jefferson Boulevard in 
Playa del Rey to the State Lands Commission or the city of Los Angeles. When 
the 180 acres of wetlands in the Summa project are added, plus an additional 
eight acres in Playa del Rey, the total wetland area west of Lincoln Boulevard 
to be preserved and restored reaches 250 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Friends of Ballona Wetlands and the state said the draft 
agreement filed in Superior Court last week goes a long way toward settling the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"We're happy with the result because it gives us a big chunk of land," said 
Mary Newcombe, attorney for the environmental group. She said the Friends want 
the area restored as a nature preserve. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200 species of birds call the wetlands home at some point each year, 
including the endangered California least tern and Belding's savannah sparrow. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Steven H. Kaufmann, representing the controller and the 
California Coastal Commission, called the agreement "a major first step in 
achieving an overall settlement here. . . . It breaks the logjam on the 
litigation." 
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, Davis agrees not to oppose development of Playa Vista, one 
of the biggest development projects in Los Angeles history. Maguire Thomas 
wants to build 5 million square feet of office space, 11,750 apartments and 
condominiums, 720,000 square feet of retail space, 2,400 hotel rooms and a 
small craft marina with 750 boat slips. Environmental impact studies are under 
way. The revised project still needs city, county and state approval. 
</P>
<P>
To complete the development, Maguire Thomas has long eyed a 70-acre parcel of 
land between Lincoln Boulevard and the Marina Freeway that the state acquired 
two years ago from the Hughes estate in lieu of inheritance taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Rising said Maguire Thomas wants to build 900,000 square feet of office space, 
2,032 residential units and 150,000 square feet of retail space on the land. 
</P>
<P>
The tentative agreement calls for Maguire Thomas to make $27 million in 
payments on the property during five years with the balance to be essentially 
loaned by the state. The price of the land would be adjusted for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement concept received initial approval last week from Superior Court 
Judge R. William Schoettler, who ruled the controller has the authority to 
enter into the deal and the price represents a fair and reasonable value. 
</P>
<P>
"The judge's decision is a clear signal that we are on the right track," Davis 
said.

FUNDS CRISIS CLOSES DOORS OF HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Beleaguered Marina Hills Hospital in Ladera Heights closed its doors Friday and 
transferred its 25 patients to other hospitals ending months of financial 
troubles, employee complaints and patient loads that had dipped to only one 
patient at times. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital Administrator Marvin Herschberg said the final blow to the troubled 
hospital was the failure of the state Medi-Cal system to pay its current bills 
to nursing homes and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
However, the hospital had been strapped financially for some time, and had been 
operating under bankruptcy protection. Hospital management at one point had 
pleaded with employees -- who were owed back pay -- to keep working so the 
facility could receive patient referrals from the county. 
</P>
<P>
Herschberg said the Medi-Cal crunch put the final squeeze on the hospital 
</P>
<P>
State officials said Wednesday that Medi-Cal had run out of money and that 
there would be a shortfall of funds to meet payments to convalescent homes and 
hospitals until July when the next fiscal year begins. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we had about $1 million owing us from the state for Medi-Cal 
services," Herschberg said. "We found we couldn't collect on them from the 
state until July. We couldn't borrow any more money and we didn't want to 
endanger any patients so we made a decision this morning (Friday) to just close 
down." 
</P>
<P>
The 103-bed hospital was employing about 100 people when it closed, the 
administrator said. It was not immediately clear what would happen to the 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Herschberg said: "The closing is particularly tragic because we felt we could 
have broken even in June. The county Department of Health Services was sending 
us obstetrics cases and we were performing surgery." 
</P>
<P>
The hospital primarily serves obstetrics cases, most of them funded by Medi-Cal 
or Medicare. During previous troubles in January and February when the facility 
was having problems meeting its payrolls, it was noted that the county 
Department of Health Services expected more than 46,000 babies to be delivered 
at county hospitals this year, severely overtaxing a system designed to deliver 
35,000 babies safely.

ESPRIT'S SUSIE TOMPKINS BUYS HER HUSBAND'S SHARE OF CLOTHIER

<P>
In a surprising twist to the long-running family feud at Esprit de Corp., 
co-founder Susie Tompkins and a group of investors said Friday that they have 
bought the half owned by her estranged husband. 
</P>
<P>
Susie Tompkins, sounding euphoric in a telephone interview, declined to reveal 
how much she and the investors paid to Doug Tompkins. Sales of San 
Francisco-based Esprit, a trend-setting maker of casual clothing for juniors 
and children, at one time topped $1 billion but last year were reportedly $800 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between the Tompkinses, whose bickering over Esprit's direction 
had frayed morale at the company, was negotiated at the 11th hour as investment 
banker Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. was in the process of receiving and analyzing 
bids from a variety of outside firms. 
</P>
<P>
Esprit was put on the auction block after Doug Tompkins passed on the chance to 
buy out his wife for $350 million, a figure set by Goldman Sachs. However, he 
said earlier this month that he hoped to get the company at auction for less. 
</P>
<P>
But Monday, according to his wife, he had a change of heart when it became 
evident that control might pass to outsiders, most likely foreign investors. 
While on vacation in Arizona, Susie Tompkins received a faxed letter from her 
husband indicating his desire to negotiate a settlement. She flew home the next 
day, and the two put lawyers to work around the clock to hammer out a plan. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Susie Tompkins said, the two celebrated the deal with a "tearful, 
happy, laughing" lunch at a former favorite haunt, surprising the personnel 
there, who had not seen the couple together since they filed for divorce last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderfully happy ending," Susie Tompkins said. "It became evident (to 
Doug) how important it was to keep it in the family." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Tompkins, an avid outdoorsman and rock climber, said in a statement that 
he intends to devote time to the environment and other causes. He will retain 
his interest in Esprit's operations in southern Europe and other foreign 
affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
Among the investors on Susie Tompkins' team are Isaac Stein, who has served as 
her representative on the Esprit board since 1988; Michael Ying, an Esprit 
director and chairman of the Esprit Far East Group, the company's main buying 
agent, and Bruce Katz, founder of the Rockport Shoe Co. After selling Rockport 
to Reebok International in 1986, Katz (pronounced Kates) formed Rosewood Stone 
Group, a private investment firm in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Stein, who is also president of Waverley Associates, a Palo Alto investment 
firm, will become chairman of a new board. Corrado Federico will continue as 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Susie Tompkins, 47, who was ousted a couple of years ago as the company's chief 
designer, will once again take that role. 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, she said she plans for the company to also design 
contemporary lines for older customers. It was her wish to appeal to a more 
mature customer that contributed to the rift with her husband, who favored 
sticking with the younger styles. The company's clothing is now sold at 50 
Esprit stores nationwide and in better department and specialty stores. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to earlier reports that the couple's rift resulted in a loss for 
Esprit in 1987, Susie Tompkins said Esprit has never suffered an annual loss. 
She added that it is soon expected to report its highest annual sales in 
history.

FUND FOR INJURY VICTIMS EMPTY, SO JUDGES REOPEN MANVILLE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Two judges supervising hundreds of asbestos injury lawsuits on Friday ordered 
the Manville Corp. bankruptcy case reopened to overhaul a financially ailing 
trust fund designed to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint order, a federal judge and a New York state judge said the Manville 
Personal Injury Settlement Trust was out of money and suggested that the 
company advance it $200 million to $300 million so it can resume payments to 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
The trust was formed in Manville's 1988 reorganization, six years after it was 
driven into bankruptcy court by lawsuits over production of asbestos, the 
insulation and building material found to cause severe and sometimes fatal 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
The trust came under fire last month because of a cash shortage induced by more 
cases, larger payouts and quicker settlements than expected. The trust told the 
judges that claimants filing this year wouldn't get paid until 2004. 
</P>
<P>
"Many more than a hundred thousand claimants all over the country and the 
limited assets cry out for a more workable and compassionate system," U.S. 
District Judge Jack B. Weinstein and New York State Supreme Court Judge Helen 
E. Freedman said in an order. 
</P>
<P>
The judges are supervising nearly 500 asbestos lawsuits against the trust and 
other defendants stemming from employment at the Brooklyn Navy Yard dating to 
the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the judges sharply criticized trust management and said the 
bankruptcy court could lift an injunction barring asbestos victims from suing 
Manville directly. Currently, only the trust can be sued. On Friday, they 
supported keeping the injunction in place if changes in the trust are made. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, Manville placed $2.5 
billion in assets, mostly stock, into the trust. The company also agreed to 
contribute $75 million annually beginning in 1991 plus 20% of annual net income 
from 1992 until all claims are paid. 
</P>
<P>
The trust told the judges this week that it had paid out almost all of its $800 
million in cash. It said the fund has not been mismanaged, denying claims that 
hundreds of millions of dollars were paid to a few plaintiffs' lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The judges said more than 130,000 remaining claims require an estimated $6.5 
billion, and with incoming claims and costs, the trust needs at least $7.5 
billion. But the trust now is worth only about $1.5 billion, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The trust has paid an average of about $42,000 on each of the first 22,000 
claims plus 8% administrative costs, the judges said. 
</P>
<P>
They ordered Manville and the trust to return to bankruptcy court and attempt 
to make changes in the trust's operation. If no changes are made by July 9, 
they promised action on their own. 
</P>
<P>
The judges recommended replacing "first-in, first-out" lump sum payments with 
periodic installments based on claimants' disease, age and financial needs. 
They said the trust should monitor claimants' health to quickly pay those with 
advanced sicknesses. 
</P>
<P>
"The trust cannot pay one widow in Brooklyn today and a widow living elsewhere 
-- whose husband died of the same disease -- 20 years from now," the judges 
wrote in a seven-page order. 
</P>
<P>
But citing the trust's weak financial position, the judges suggested that no 
interest payments be made to claimants on deferred payments. They also 
suggested that the trust cut administrative costs and fees paid to its own and 
plaintiffs' attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Weinstein and Freedman said developing a "workable and fair compensation 
program" would eliminate the need to allow claimants to sue Manville directly. 
Allowing lawsuits against Manville would hurt the trust, the judges said, by 
reducing the value of its stock holdings. If Manville is protected against 
litigation the trust's stock could grow 50% to $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Manville stock rose 25 cents to $7.12 1/2 in New York Stock Exchange trading 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Denver-based Manville issued a statement saying it was pleased that the judges 
supported continuing the injunction barring lawsuits against the company. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, which makes fiberglass, forest, construction and other products, said 
it is "willing to discuss issues related to cash flow and liquidity of the 
trust." It declined further comment on the court order.

L.A. GEAR STOCK DIVES ON NEWS PROFIT WILL FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fast-growing L.A. Gear, which sprinted in recent years into the ranks of the 
nation's top sneaker firms, announced its first bad fall Friday. The company 
estimated that its second-quarter profit would be off as much as 40% from a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The news devastated the company's stock, the biggest gainer on the New York 
Stock Exchange last year. It closed at $30.75, down $8.50 for the day. With 6.6 
million shares trading hands, it was the most actively traded issue on the Big 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
Since closing at $49.80 nine days ago, the stock has fallen 38%, for roughly a 
$365-million loss in the company's overall market value. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Gary M. Jacobson of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., who put out a signal for 
investors to sell their L.A. Gear holdings early in the week, said he was 
stunned by the company's earnings projection. 
</P>
<P>
He said he expected earnings to be off, but "in my wildest dreams, I didn't 
expect something of this magnitude." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Jacobson added that the company "is not in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
"The company's still going to make money this year, that's not an issue. . . . 
Growth is going to moderate," he said, "but that's to be expected from a 
company approaching $1 billion" in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Gear estimated that sales for the quarter ended May 31 were up 33%, to 
about $225 million. For the first half of the fiscal year, revenue is expected 
to be up 75%, to $412 million. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings, however, are expected to fall from $16 million in last year's second 
quarter to somewhere between $9.5 million and $11.4 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
In a news release, L.A. Gear said its profit margins were squeezed as a bigger 
share of its sales came from its lower-priced sneakers. The company, trying to 
put the best face on the results, said profit margins should grow again now 
that it is bringing out new high-priced sneakers, including its line endorsed 
by singer Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
The cheaper shoes "have been well accepted and have provided (stores) with an 
opportunity to make a full profit on relatively low-priced product during an 
otherwise slow time at retail," said Robert Y. Greenberg, the company's 
chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
"This strategy has allowed L.A. Gear to significantly expand its market share 
and retail shelf space during the quarter. We hope to benefit from this 
expanded share in the third and fourth quarters of 1990, as delivery commences 
of the newer, higher-margin styles introduced for the back-to-school and 
holiday selling seasons," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Marina del Rey-based company could not be reached for comment. 
The news release gave no reason for the steady slide in the company's stock and 
the heavy volume of trading since late last week. 
</P>
<P>
The stock's tumble accelerated Friday morning, and trading was halted at around 
10:30 a.m. West Coast time, with the stock already down $2.625 on the day, to 
$36.625. About 45 minutes later, L.A. Gear announced its earnings projection. 
When trading resumed later in the morning, the stock opened at $29, and then 
edged up over the rest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Gear's stock has been dogged for years by short sellers, who sell borrowed 
shares on the expectation that prices will fall. Until Friday, however, every 
time short sellers pushed the stock down, L.A. Gear would issue a strong 
earnings report that would bring the stock back up. 
</P>
<P>
Even at Friday's closing price, the stock is up more than 10-fold since the 
company went public in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The company has skyrocketed ever since Greenberg converted his small shoelace 
and sportswear business six years ago into a sneaker manufacturer. L.A. Gear, 
propelled by its breezy Southern California image and a host of celebrity 
endorsements, has been a particular hit among teen-age girls. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Gear's weak earnings projection followed the company's disclosure that 
Greenberg, Executive Vice President Sandy Saemann and former Chief Financial 
Officer Elliot J. Horowitz each earned more than $5 million in cash last year. 
That apparently would place them among the 15 highest-paid executives at public 
companies in California. 
</P>
<P>
The company said their compensation was boosted by a formula that links pay to 
profits. Salaries will be capped at $5 million this year.

DEBATE FLARES OVER PUSH TO RECYCLE NEWSPAPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When New York's Suffolk County this week adopted the nation's toughest 
newsprint recycling law, it joined a groundswell among community activists to 
induce the birth of a market that they believe has so far failed to develop on 
its own. 
</P>
<P>
While several states have passed laws requiring newspapers to use recycled 
paper, and similar federal bills are pending, Suffolk County is apparently the 
first local government to enact legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Publishers and paper manufacturers say the activists are getting ahead of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, newspaper recycling is going great guns," said Tonda F. Rush, vice 
president for industry affairs for the American Newspaper Publishers Assn. As 
recently as a year and a half ago, collection of old newspapers -- ONP in 
industry jargon -- was haphazard, she said. But municipal curbside recycling 
efforts have proliferated in that time, and the supply of old newspapers has 
outstripped the ability of paper mills to process it. 
</P>
<P>
Rush said it may be as long as a year and a half before the mills will finish 
building the plants they need to handle the torrent. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Toronto and Washington have considered ordinances requiring 
newspapers sold on city streets to use recycled paper. 
</P>
<P>
In Oregon's Multnomah County, a ballot drive for mandatory newsprint recycling 
was derailed only after the publisher of Portland's Oregonian newspaper agreed 
to a voluntary plan. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1990, California, Wisconsin, Missouri and Maryland will have 
mandatory newsprint recycling laws in place. Currently, publishers have agreed 
to voluntary plans in New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Massachusetts and 
Michigan. Rush of the ANPA said that in Kentucky, New Jersey and another half 
dozen states, voluntary agreements are under discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Paper manufacturers say that, like the publishers, they favor recycling. But 
they, too, oppose mandatory recycling, citing the costs of compliance with a 
hodgepodge of state and local statutes. The American Paper Institute, a trade 
group, contends that recycling is working better than people think, and that it 
has increased at more than twice the rate of newsprint consumption overall. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect that one out of every two newspapers in the United States will be 
collected for recycling by 1995," says Red Cavaney, API president. 
</P>
<P>
Publishers prefer voluntary plans and warn that creating a market by fiat will 
inevitably raise newsprint prices. Knowing that their customers are forced to 
buy the product, paper suppliers will charge more, the argument goes. 
</P>
<P>
But publishers are considering challenging the Suffolk County law on 
constitutional grounds, arguing that mandatory recycling threatens the First 
Amendment right to freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at it this way," said Rush of the ANPA. "You've got a state capital that 
controls the raw material that's necessary to publish the newspaper. And the 
government controlling that raw material is the same government that you're 
writing about." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in neighborhoods across the country, citizens who dutifully pile 
their old newspapers at the curb are increasingly frustrated as the feeble new 
market founders and papers stack up in warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
Demand hasn't yet caught up with the supply generated by neighborhood 
recycling, contends Grant Ferrier, editor of the San Diego-based Environmental 
Business Journal. He recounts the example of an Ohio recycler who less than two 
years ago was getting $30 a ton for old newspapers; when he went out of 
business last year, he had to pay $10 a ton to have the old newspapers hauled 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Tales like this have encouraged community leaders to take matters into their 
own hands. Some have even talked of adding deposits to newspapers, like the 
deposits on soft drink bottles. 
</P>
<P>
Maxine Postal first began to worry about the bad rap that Suffolk County was 
getting in 1987, when the infamous Islip garbage barge prowled the world's 
oceans for months, searching for a friendly port for its load of Suffolk County 
trash. Postal began to worry that "that's what we were going to be famous for, 
exporting garbage." 
</P>
<P>
Then Postal, a county representative, discovered that her town of Amityville 
was planning to incinerate half the newspapers that she and her neighbors had 
been carefully separating to recycle. 
</P>
<P>
"And that would be a death knell for recycling," she recalled thinking. "Why 
would someone separate newspapers if they knew they would just be burned?" 
</P>
<P>
Postal figured that the only way to create markets for recycled newsprint was 
to compel publishers to use it. Her law requires any newspaper of more than 
20,000 circulation that is printed, sold or distributed in the county to use 
newsprint that is at least 40% recycled fiber by December, 1996.

PENTAGON LIFTS BUYING BAN, VSI DISCLOSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

VSI Corp., which three weeks ago pleaded guilty to falsifying test results for 
aircraft nuts and bolts made at its Chatsworth plant, said the Pentagon has 
agreed to resume buying from the plant. 
</P>
<P>
The military's Defense Logistics Agency lifted a suspension, imposed a year 
ago, that banned the company's Voi-Shan plant from selling its products -- 
called fasteners in the industry -- directly to the government, VSI said. 
</P>
<P>
The plant was not idle, however. VSI, a Torrance-based unit of Fairchild 
Industries Inc. that also has a plant in Redondo Beach, continued selling 
fasteners to commercial aircraft companies such as Boeing Co., said Donald S. 
Parker, VSI's general counsel. Also, the Pentagon kept buying products made at 
other VSI plants. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the DLA's action confirms that our house is in order at the 
Chatsworth plant," Ben W. Prescott, the newly appointed president of Fairchild 
Fastener Group, which includes VSI, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
On May 11, VSI pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Seattle to four counts 
of falsifying and omitting test results for fasteners. It agreed to pay $18 
million in a civil settlement and to cover fines and the cost of prosecution. 
Two former VSI employees also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal charges grew out of a civil suit that three former Voi-Shan 
employees filed in 1988. The former workers are expected to receive an 
as-yet-undecided percentage of the $14.5 million in civil penalties paid by 
VSI. 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities have said there is no evidence that any airline tragedy 
resulted from bad fasteners made by VSI.

CHEVRON PLANS UNLEADED LOW-EMISSIONS GASOLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chevron Corp. is test-marketing a lower-emissions gasoline in Florida and plans 
to introduce a version of it on the West Coast in the near future, Chevron 
dealers said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The new gasoline, to be called Chevron Unleaded Plus, is similar in composition 
to Atlantic Richfield Co.'s EC-1 gasoline, the first of several lower-emissions 
gasolines to hit the market in the last several months, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arco confirmed that it may come out with another reformulated 
gasoline to accompany EC-1 as soon as this fall. EC-1, which was introduced in 
September, is sold to cars that previously used only leaded gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Arco's new lower-emissions gasoline, code-named EC-X, would be marketed to cars 
that use unleaded gas, possibly as a premium grade such as Shell's new SU 
2000E. 
</P>
<P>
Few other details concerning Chevron's new gasoline were available, and a 
Chevron spokeswoman in San Francisco declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
If Chevron proceeds with plans to market such a gasoline, it will join seven 
other major oil companies marketing some form of so-called reformulated 
gasoline in various parts of the country. Exxon Corp. began selling a 
reformulated gasoline in 20 Eastern and Gulf Coast states on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
At least two more refiners are planning similar introductions. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, George H. Babikian, president of Arco's refining and marketing 
subsidiary, said the company had not made up its mind yet on how to proceed 
with its new gasoline.

<P>
Japan's trade surplus declined by 70% in April, the sharpest drop since June, 
1979, due largely to a jump in imports that reflects the expensive tastes of 
Japanese consumers, economists said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The surplus in Japan's current account, the broadest measure of trade in goods 
and services, narrowed to $2 billion in April from $6.58 billion a year earlier 
and $8.13 billion in March.

EMI MUSIC'S NET PROFIT MORE THAN DOUBLES IN YEAR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Aided by booming sales at its record labels, EMI Music's profit more than 
doubled from $73.5 million to a record $150.2 million for the year ended March 
31. 
</P>
<P>
The London-based music concern, a unit of the British electronics and music 
conglomerate Thorn EMI PLC, said sales rose from $1.3 billion to a record $1.7 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The better-than-expected results came amid an overall slowing in music industry 
sales in the United States last year. 
</P>
<P>
But EMI, which formed a joint venture with SBK last year and paid $79.1 million 
for a 50% interest in Chrysalis, has enjoyed surprising success domestically 
with Sinead O'Connor, whose Chrysalis album went to No. 1 in 16 countries, and 
with M. C. Hammer, a rap artist with EMI's Los Angeles-based Capitol Records 
label. Hammer's "Please Don't Hurt 'Em" album ranks No. 2 on the Billboard list 
of top 100 albums. 
</P>
<P>
Besides O'Connor and Hammer, EMI's roster of artists includes Bonnie Raitt, 
Freddie Jackson, Richard Marx, Paul McCartney and Tina Turner. The company now 
claims a 12% share of the worldwide music market. JUBE SHIVER

SWARMS OF FUNNEL CLOUDS CAUSE DAMAGE, NO INJURIES IN TEXAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Damage was estimated at $5.5 million Friday in Spearman, Tex., as residents 
cleaned up debris left by swarms of funnel clouds that a National Weather 
Service employee said were too numerous to count. 
</P>
<P>
A church, 10 mobile homes and 10 houses were reported destroyed. Some of the 
mobile homes were "smoothed off to the ground," said Mayor Burl Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor estimated that 5% of the Panhandle town of 3,500 had property damage. 
About 80% of the city was blacked out and phone service was spotty until Friday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, damage estimates were still being collected Friday in Vicksburg, 
Miss., where residents stacked sodden belongings outside and cleaned up mud 
after record flash flooding. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 Vicksburg residents were forced to higher ground Thursday when 
thunderstorms dumped as much as seven inches of rain, overflowing creeks and 
drainage ditches. 
</P>
<P>
There was disagreement over just what caused the damage in Spearman late 
Thursday. Residents and witnesses said three funnel clouds caused the damage 
even though they did not quite touch down. The National Weather Service said 
one tornado did scour the surface. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one that hit Spearman itself, and there were multiple tornadoes in 
the vicinity of Spearman for several hours last night," said Steven Cooper of 
the National Weather Service office in Amarillo, Tex. "There were about three 
different storm systems. Two dropped tornadoes." He said there were too many to 
count. 
</P>
<P>
A state trooper reported a count of 10. "We were up there until 1 (a.m.), and 
there were still tornadoes dancing around. They were all over the place," 
trooper Wayne Beighle of Amarillo said. "None touched the ground -- they were 
hovering just above the ground, but that was enough to do the damage." 
</P>
<P>
Water damage in Vicksburg was reported to 187 homes and at least two 
businesses.

NORTH TESTIFIES BEFORE NEW IRAN-CONTRA GRAND JURY

<P>
Oliver L. North testified Friday before a newly impaneled federal grand jury 
that is continuing the investigation of the Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The former White House aide was accompanied into the grand jury room by a 
prosecutor from the office of independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
North repeatedly left the secret proceedings during the day of testimony to 
confer with his attorneys in a courthouse hallway. 
</P>
<P>
Periodic exits from grand jury proceedings enable witnesses to receive legal 
advice and to keep their lawyers informed about what the government is asking 
them. 
</P>
<P>
During one break, North lawyer Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. began shouting at 
Iran-Contra prosecutor Craig Gillen. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't intimidate me and I don't intimidate you," replied Gillen, who then 
returned to the grand jury room. North followed a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh's office is trying to determine the precise roles that then-President 
Ronald Reagan, then-Vice President George Bush and others played in the affair, 
sources familiar with the investigation said in April. 
</P>
<P>
The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said North and former national 
security adviser John M. Poindexter were likely to be subpoenaed and granted 
immunity from prosecution in exchange for their grand jury testimony. 
</P>
<P>
North, 46, was convicted May 4, 1989, of aiding and abetting an obstruction of 
Congress, altering and destroying National Security Council documents and 
receiving an illegal gratuity. 
</P>
<P>
An appeal is pending.

Two judges supervising hundreds of asbestos injury lawsuits ordered the 
Manville Corp. bankruptcy case reopened to overhaul a financially ailing trust 
fund designed to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases. In a joint 
order in New York, a federal judge and a New York state judge said the Manville 
Personal Injury Settlement Trust was out of money and suggested the company 
advance it between $200 million and $300 million so it can resume payments to 
victims. The trust was formed in Manville's 1988 reorganization, six years 
after it was driven into bankruptcy court by lawsuits over the production of 
asbestos.

County grand jurors recommended that people who work in the aging downtown 
courthouse -- from judges to janitors -- have physical examinations at least 
once a year because of concern about cancer-causing asbestos in the 
663,000-square-foot building. Grand jury foreman Phil Franklin advised 
courthouse workers to ask county supervisors to eliminate the health hazard.

A 32-year-old man said he was kidnaped and robbed alongside a road in Oak View 
Thursday night but escaped by jumping onto the hood of a passing car, 
authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Bersach, 32, of Glendale said he was riding from San Luis Obispo to 
Glendale with two acquaintances about 10:30 p.m. when they told him that they 
were going to beat and rob him, Ventura County Sheriff's Department Lt. Joe 
Funchess said. 
</P>
<P>
The two men drove onto California 33 from the Ventura Freeway and parked next 
to the highway. They took Bersach's wallet and began beating him, Funchess 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bersach jumped onto the hood of a car and was taken to a service station, where 
sheriff's officers were called, Funchess said. He was treated for head injuries 
at the Ojai Valley Community Hospital. The assailants were still at large.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PLEA ENTERED IN CASE OF ABANDONED BABY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 22-year-old woman accused of leaving her 10-month-old baby on the side of the 
road pleaded innocent Friday to felony charges of child endangerment and 
abandonment. 
</P>
<P>
Lori Carlson of Santa Ana faces a maximum sentence of nine years in state 
prison if convicted of the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Thomas J. Hutchins set bail at $25,000, denying a request by 
Carlson's lawyer that she be released on her own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Susan Olson said Carlson is distraught over what has 
happened and hopes to regain custody of the baby, Brittany, and her 3-year-old 
daughter Alicia. 
</P>
<P>
"She was just pushed beyond her limit by not receiving support for the children 
from either of the fathers," Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
The children were placed in the custody of Carlson's parents during a Superior 
Court hearing earlier on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
According to authorities, Carlson and the baby's father, Wayne M. Jefferds, 30, 
of Corona, began arguing at the Oxnard Lodge Motel Tuesday evening over 
financial support for Brittany. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferds left, and Carlson put both children in her car and followed him south 
on the Pacific Coast Highway, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Carlson then pulled over, set the baby about three feet from the road and sped 
away, Deputy Dist. Atty. Lela M. Henke-Dobroth said. 
</P>
<P>
A witness driving behind Carlson stopped and picked up the baby. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary hearing for Carlson was scheduled for June 14.

The Oak View Civic Council selected an honorary mayor and honored two residents 
Friday during a ceremony at the Oak View Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
Lanie Jo Springer, 55, a personnel specialist with Ventura Unified School 
District, began her second term as Oak View's honorary mayor by defeating 
challenger Willem Visser, an engineer for an oil spill cleanup company. 
</P>
<P>
The Oak View Civic Council, which is made up of active individuals and 
non-profit organizations in the community, raises money for projects in the 
unincorporated community of about 4,000 residents south of Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
James Stallings, 35, a self-employed contractor, was chosen Outstanding Citizen 
of the Year by a three-member committee of the Civic Council. He was recognized 
for building bleachers, fences and playground equipment for Oak View School and 
the local Little League. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 Mother of the Year award went to Lynn Smith, 44, an instructional aide 
at Oak View School and a mother of three children. She was nominated by her 
oldest daughter, Aja, 10. 
</P>
<P>
The council had hoped to honor a Father of the Year, but no one was nominated, 
said council President Terry Tatroe, an Oak View electrician. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 people gathered in the Oak View Community Center for the awards 
ceremony and enchilada dinner prepared by the Oak View Women's Club. 
Entertainment was provided by the Old-Time Fiddlers. 
</P>
<P>
Springer said the council is striving to become more of a voice for the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
The council will elect new officers Thursday at 7 p.m. at the Oak View 
Community Center. THIA BELL

LIFEGUARDS WARN OF PERIL AT SOUTH JETTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lifeguards in charge of patrolling Marina Cove Beach in Ventura Harbor say they 
are fed up with risking their lives in belated rescue efforts to save lives at 
the south jetty beach while local authorities look the other way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most dangerous beach in the county, said veteran lifeguard Steve 
Miskulin, who has spent 12 years working on Marina Cove. He said that "99 out 
of 100" accidents that take place there could be prevented if the city of 
Ventura or the port district would provide lifeguard service on the south 
jetty. 
</P>
<P>
State, city and port officials disagree with the lifeguards. They believe that 
the beach is too dangerous for bathers and that offering lifeguard services 
there would send the wrong message. 
</P>
<P>
They say they want swimmers and inexperienced surfers to stay out, and for that 
reason, they have warning signs advising the public not to use the beach. But 
the signs, which read, "Warning: Hazardous Riptides, No Lifeguards On Duty," do 
not prevent public use of the south jetty. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, at least a half dozen surfers, boogie boarders and swimmers bathed 
dangerously close to the jetty to take advantage of the strong waves, which are 
non-existent in the calm, enclosed Marina Cove Beach on the other side of the 
artificial rock barrier. 
</P>
<P>
Standing atop the jetty, Miskulin and California State Lifeguard Assn. 
President Kirk Sturm looked down at the surfers with obvious concern. 
</P>
<P>
Sturm and Miskulin said that in the last five years at least three people have 
drowned at the south jetty and that lifeguards make at least 100 rescues a year 
there, often risking their own lives because the call for help comes too late. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is further compounded, Miskulin said, by the fact that the Ventura 
Harbor District has promoted the south jetty by building several parking lots 
and restrooms nearby, including a 37-car lot recently completed. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Treanor, superintendent of Channel Coast District State Parks, which has 
75 lifeguards on Ventura beaches, says he understands the lifeguards' concerns 
but does not believe the solution is more supervision. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's not a safe beach, and any increase in use will make the problem 
worse," he said. "I think the lifeguards are looking at the problem on emotion 
and not with the facts. Statistically, south jetty beach is no worse than many 
other areas along the coast in terms of accidents." SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

<P>
10% INCREASE SOUGHT FOR POLLUTION FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Air Pollution Control District has proposed to hike the cost 
of permits by 10% to businesses that add pollutants to the air, county 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The increase, subject to approval by the County Board of Supervisors, will 
increase fees for oil companies, power companies, gas stations and other 
businesses emitting pollutants and is expected to raise $119,000 annually, said 
Mike Villegas, a district spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"We're increasing fees and we're changing how we weight some of the 
pollutants," Villegas said. 
</P>
<P>
Fees are being restructured to penalize companies more severely for emitting 
certain pollutants, such as those known to harm the ozone layer, and less for 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Villegas said fees are charged on the basis of the number of pounds per hour of 
pollutants emitted, with different fees being assessed for different 
pollutants. He said most pollutants are assessed at the rate of $43 per pound 
per hour. 
</P>
<P>
The increased revenues will be used to pay the salaries of seven new staff 
members and to finance new programs mandated by the California Clean Air Act of 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
There are now nearly 1,000 businesses with permits. Villegas said he expects 
that number to increase as more businesses move into the area and as county 
pollution standards become stricter.

TEEN-AGER ARRESTED IN SQUIRT GUN SCARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Simi Valley teen-ager was arrested Friday after waving a plastic Uzi squirt 
gun at motorists on the Ventura Freeway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Jess Paul Brown, 18, was being held Friday in the Ventura Jail on suspicion of 
brandishing a firearm on the highway, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP received two separate reports about 8 a.m. of a man waving a gun. 
</P>
<P>
At 12:40 p.m., a commuter flagged down a CHP officer patrolling the Conejo 
Grade area and said a man in a car had just pointed an Uzi at him. 
</P>
<P>
As they talked, the car and driver that the commuter had described passed them, 
the CHP said. The officer pulled the car over and found the squirt gun. 
</P>
<P>
He arrested Brown, who matched the description given by two motorists.

COMMISSION BACKS 237-HOUSE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Simi Valley Planning Commission has voted to recommend City Council 
approval of a 237-house subdivision on the city's east side with the 
stipulation that a park and 59 affordable housing units be included in the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
But the developer opposes inclusion of a park on the 63-acre site south of the 
500 block of Tierra Rejada Road. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission voted on Wednesday to recommend to the council that a 
2.5- to 5-acre park be included in the development. 
</P>
<P>
"If the park is a requirement of the project, it simply won't be built," said 
John Williamson, a Simi Valley attorney representing Milner Development Corp. 
of Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson said the developer is already giving up several million dollars in 
potential profits by including 59 affordable housing units in the project. 
Williamson said the affordable units would be sold for about $105,000, or half 
their market value. 
</P>
<P>
He said that to include a park, the entire development would have to be scaled 
down. If that were the case, Williamson said, "we don't think we could finance" 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
Asher Wolf, Simi Valley's planning manager, said the council will make the 
final decision on the housing proposal. 
</P>
<P>
A public hearing on the matter is scheduled for June 25. CARLOS V. LOZANO

BLANTON, EVERETT MAKE GOOD ON THEIR BILLING

<P>
Stopping Dain Blanton and Danielle Everett on the volleyball court hasn't been 
an easy task this season, and Friday night was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
Blanton of Laguna Beach High School and Everett of Corona del Mar were named 
most valuable players while leading their teams to victories in the Orange 
County boys' and girls' all-star games at Golden West College. 
</P>
<P>
Blanton, a 6-foot-4 outside hitter, had 14 kills to lead the South boys to a 
15-8, 15-8, 17-15 victory over the North. 
</P>
<P>
Everett, a 6-1 outside hitter headed for Stanford, had 19 kills to lead the 
North girls to a 15-4, 11-15, 15-8 victory. Blanton and Everett were The Times' 
Orange County players of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Edison Coach Brian Rofer, who coached the North team, said Blanton was 
"unstoppable." 
</P>
<P>
"He's the Orange County player of the year," Rofer said, "and he showed it. I 
saw him playing before the start of the season on some junior club teams. He 
was a man among boys." 
</P>
<P>
The same could be said Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Blanton had 10 kills in the first game as the South raced to a 10-4 lead and 
held on for the victory. His South teammate, Jeff Janis of Foothill, had seven 
of his eight kills in the game as well as two aces. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills Coach Oz Simmons, who coached the South team, used his second-string 
players freely in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Seymour of Woodbridge came off the bench to contribute five kills and El 
Toro's Mike Shannon added three as the South built leads of 9-3 and 12-4. 
</P>
<P>
"Our second team did great," Simmons said. "Our first lineup was taller and was 
a better blocking team, but our second team was better (back row) defensively." 
</P>
<P>
Carter Reese of Corona del Mar and Edison's Steve Snyder had 11 kills each to 
lead the North. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' game, Everett helped offset strong performances by the South's 
Dawn Austin (Canyon), Deanna Doolittle (Woodbridge) and Sarah Nelson (Laguna 
Beach). Doolittle had 13 kills, Nelson nine and Austin eight with three blocks. 
</P>
<P>
Everett had six kills in the first game as the North built leads of 7-0 and 
12-3. 
</P>
<P>
But the South, behind Doolittle's five kills and Austin's three key blocks, 
broke an 11-11 tie to win the second game, 15-11. 
</P>
<P>
Everett was back in form for the third game. She had eight kills and Mater 
Dei's Mary Eberhart threw off the South with her jump serve as the North 
rallied from a 5-1 deficit to win, 15-8. 
</P>
<P>
"We got down early in the third game and there wasn't much energy there," said 
Corona del Mar Coach Charlie Brande, who coached the North. "But I put Mary in 
and the whole level changed with her jump serving and everything."

Construction spending fell 0.7% in April for the second consecutive month, the 
government said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the report signaled a weakening building industry. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and government 
construction spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $432.4 
billion in April. The revised 0.7% March decline was improved from the 1.4% 
drop first reported last month. 
</P>
<P>
The decreases in March and April spending followed gains of 3.2% in February 
and 2.4% in January and resulted in the loss of 159,000 construction jobs.

BEJART PYRAMID SCHEME COLLAPSES IN FISCAL FLOP; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURE: EGYPT'S ATTEMPTS TO BOOST TOURIST REVENUES USING THE ARTS FAIL AGAIN. 
</P>

<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Choreographer Maurice Bejart stood at the Pyramids and imagined a tableau of 
dancers swooning to the rhythms of the East, framed only by the starry night 
sky, the tombs of ancient kings and, like an eerie, whirling backdrop, the 
Egyptian desert. 
</P>
<P>
Back home in Switzerland, he set about creating a mystic, sensual ballet to 
give movement to the splendor of ancient Egypt and the modern Islamic faith. 
</P>
<P>
Belgian promoter Michel Reculez contracted with an Egyptian company to 
construct the stage. Costumes and set backdrops were flown in. Sophisticated 
new lighting equipment was leased. Tickets were sold to travelers from all over 
Europe for what was to be one of the cultural events of the decade here: the 
premiere of Bejart's "Pyramid" on the Pyramids Plateau of Giza. 
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians had visions of their own, however: Customs wanted a 20% duty on 
the imported equipment. Tax authorities wanted $50,000 for each of the eight 
scheduled performances as an advance. The antiquities organization wanted 
royalties of $3,800 per performance, plus another $11,300 deposit, and demanded 
150 free tickets each night. Then, two days before last month's premiere, the 
contractor announced the price for building the stage was not $211,000, as 
promoter Reculez believed, but $566,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the subsequent dispute, 200 police officers blocked access to the site and 
the performance was called off. 
</P>
<P>
Reculez flew back to Brussels and declared bankruptcy. A visibly shaken Bejart 
announced that the ballet would go on, but only at Cairo's downtown opera 
house, not at the Pyramids. Angry ticket-holders unsuccessfully demanded their 
money back. The lighting company directors hired an Egyptian lawyer to try to 
get their $600,000 worth of equipment out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like Kafka -- no, it's worse than Kafka. It's state robbery," declared 
one Belgian government official who tried to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
The fiasco was but the latest setback in Egypt's attempts to capitalize on its 
legendary archaeological treasures as modern cultural institutions. Seeking to 
boost tourist revenues and bring new life to the ancient monuments, Egyptian 
promoters have sponsored concerts at the Pyramids and lavish productions of the 
opera "Aida" at Luxor and Giza, and they have attempted to organize a music 
festival at temples up and down the Nile. 
</P>
<P>
Although the events have been enthusiastically received in the arts community, 
most have been fiscal flops, resulting in months of finger-pointing, lawsuits 
and recriminations. 
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is a great lure, but we've had so many of these disasters," complained 
Magda Saleh, former director of Cairo's opera house. "The government is 
behaving as if, no matter what happens, we want our pound of flesh. Well, they 
got their pound of flesh, but the (promoter), for whatever reason, got ruined. 
. . . There's quite a history of this sort of thing, and it's a pity. It's like 
killing the goose that lays the golden egg." 
</P>
<P>
Well-known Egyptian opera singer Hassan Kamy, who produced "Aida" at the 
Pyramids in 1987, complained in a special column: "It is obvious now that we 
will never be capable of having such a big cultural event in our beautiful 
country unless we get rid of all this bureaucracy and realize the enormous loss 
we have sustained by killing the Bejart project." 
</P>
<P>
Kamy's interest was rekindled by more than the publicity over the Bejart 
production and by his own memories of haggling with tax and customs officials 
over "Aida," which eventually drew an audience of 27,000. After imposing 
customs duties on the Bejart production, authorities checked their records and 
determined that no similar duties had been assessed to Kamy in 1987. Three 
weeks ago, he got a letter demanding $106,000. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian government officials admit that productions at archaeological sites so 
far have been money losers, but blame the losses on Western producers who don't 
bother to learn how to work the system in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
"People expect to do things as they do in Berlin or Frankfurt; they expect 
everything to go a la West, and then they make enormous mistakes," Tarek Ali 
Hassan, current director of the Cairo Opera, complained in an interview 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I reject out of hand these claims that the system is inefficient, the system 
is unfair. It is not. Somebody has not done their homework properly. A lot of 
planning is needed -- a lot of groundwork. As it happens, Westerners are used 
to the normal channels, and the normal channels do not apply here." 
</P>
<P>
Some in the Egyptian arts community privately say that Reculez, a travel 
company owner with no previous experience producing a major cultural event, 
should have familiarized himself better with the Egyptian bureaucracy before 
launching so large an undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
But Reculez says he could not have anticipated the last-minute demand by the 
contractor building the stage that effectively tripled the price. The 
contractor, who has declined interviews, has told the Egyptian courts that he 
had informed Reculez from the beginning that the price was to be charged in 
dollars, not Egyptian pounds -- and thus Reculez should have anticipated the 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute was further complicated when the subcontractor supplying the wood 
for the stage suddenly demanded an extra $350,000 in case it was decided to 
make the stage permanent rather than dismantle it after the performance. 
Reculez put up a check to cover the demand as a deposit, pending resolution of 
the dispute after the performances. The contractor attempted to cash it, and 
when it bounced, the Egyptian authorities seized not only the theater, but also 
the hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of leased electronic equipment that 
was already installed. 
</P>
<P>
Reculez, his own house in Brussels mortgaged to cover the advance costs, went 
home having spent $500,000, without a cent of revenue to show for it. Bejart's 
Ballet Lausanne performed at the opera house free of charge -- confident, 
perhaps, that the production will earn money later at European performances. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost everything," Reculez said in an interview. "It's a very big scandal, 
you know. The problem in Egypt is that nothing is easy. Nothing, nothing, 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, you receive with a smile all authorization. 'Yes, come, come.' After 
that, everybody -- everybody -- asks to be paid. In advance. For tax. For 
customs. For everything you have to pay in advance, and when there is a 
problem, you don't find anyone able to find a solution. You find nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Bejart, meanwhile, has declined to comment publicly on the matter, calling it a 
business dispute between the promoter and the contractor. At a news conference 
last week, he said he was glad at least to be able to open the production at 
the opera house. 
</P>
<P>
"The main purpose was to give an Egyptian performance to the Egyptian public, 
and we find a lot of the possibilities to make (it happen)," he said. "We want 
to give our view of this wonderful civilization, to give it to the world, and 
mainly to the Egyptians." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I don't like to lose. So maybe I lose the Pyramids, I lose the 
desert, I lose everything, but the public's not going to lose." 
</P>
<P>
But Kamy said Bejart privately was "in deep pain," and Kamy himself refused to 
attend any of the seven performances at the opera, which concluded last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, one-third of something is better than three-thirds of nothing," he 
said. "But as an artist, I feel wounded like him. I see what's in his face, I 
hear his voice. I did not go. I did not want to see it. I did not want to see 
one-third of the thing." 
</P>
<P>
Though the government remains committed to producing cultural events at Egypt's 
historic sites, Hassan said, the Bejart performance was a success even within 
the confines of the opera house -- in part, he said, because it was among the 
first theatrical works produced in Cairo that forced Egyptians to examine and 
question their identity as the heirs of both Ramses and Mohammed, Napoleon and 
Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
In the days after the performances, columnists began asking about Bejart's 
mystic view of Islam and wondering whether it did not lean more toward his own 
Shiism, rather than the Sunni Islam that most Egyptians adhere to. Some 
criticized his depiction of the beloved Egyptian diva, Om Koulthoum, as 
"grotesque." But despite scanty costumes and veiled Muslim women in punk 
sunglasses, there were none of the usual complaints from Islamic fundamentalist 
quarters that frequently occur at Egyptian cultural events. 
</P>
<P>
"What has happened is this production, with its richness and its greatness, has 
set a lot of people thinking -- it has created healthy controversies," Hassan 
said. "People were transformed, as if by magic, when they left. People that 
don't know each other were talking to each other, people were set wondering, 
questioning. This, I think, was one of the greatest gains of the experience, 
whatever else happened."

MINEKO GRIMMER'S SCULPTURES AS ENTRANCING AS EVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEAH OLLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the eye of the storm that was Los Angeles' 1987 art fair, a small sculpture 
made of modest, natural materials stopped the glitz-saturated crowd in its 
tracks. An oasis of calm formed around the work, a hushed aura that revived the 
battered senses of the fair's visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The restorative powers of Mineko Grimmer's work were, perhaps, even bolstered 
by the fair's surrounding array of bloated intentions. But it would be hard to 
imagine any context in which Grimmer's work wouldn't slow one's breath, relax 
one's pace and draw one's undivided attention to the subtleties of sound and 
shadow. 
</P>
<P>
"Palisade," Grimmer's current, site-specific installation at the Mesa College 
Art Gallery (through June 8), is, characteristically, fully entrancing. As 
Grimmer states in the show's accompanying video and catalogue -- both as finely 
crafted as the art they describe -- her work is part sculpture, part kinetic 
art and part performance. It is a graceful, elegant environment that "performs" 
itself, with each moment of its life span distinct and unrepeatable. 
</P>
<P>
In "Palisade," evenly spaced, raw wood beams about 9 feet tall form an 
enclosure in the shape of an incomplete circle. Inside the defined space sits a 
square, shallow trough of water, framed in wood and surrounded by a carpet of 
small, smooth pebbles. Stretching diagonally across the pool, from one corner 
to its opposite, Grimmer has suspended two piano wires. Beneath the wires and 
aligned perpendicular to them, sits a length of brass rod on a thick wooden 
stump. 
</P>
<P>
From waist to shoulder height, slender bamboo rods jut inward from the beams of 
the palisade's exterior wall. Each protrudes at a slightly different angle, and 
they coalesce in the center as an airy, floating thicket. Just above the 
highest of these bamboo rods hangs the heart of the installation, a pyramidal 
mass of pebbles and ice, hung with its point downward. 
</P>
<P>
As the block melts, water and stones fall through the bamboo thicket into the 
pool below, occasionally hitting one of the wires or the rod along the way. 
Each such block lasts four or five hours, and, in the course of each day's 
performance, the elements of the installation collaborate with time, 
temperature and chance to compose a unique musical score. 
</P>
<P>
Water drips gently over the bamboo, becoming audible only as it joins the 
larger pool, and sending ripples to the corners of the trough and reflections 
to dance on the palisade walls and gallery ceiling. Single stones tap their way 
through the bamboo before their simple splash, sometimes preceded by the 
prolonged twang of a piano wire. When a cluster of pebbles releases itself, the 
pace intensifies, the rhythm grows more complex and the silence afterward, more 
pronounced. 
</P>
<P>
Silence plays as great a role as sound in Grimmer's work, as it does in the 
work of composer John Cage, whom she cites as an influence. In both artists' 
work, silence is less an empty interlude than a malleable form, one that 
quickly becomes charged with anticipation and filled with the ambient sounds of 
everyday occurence that, typically, pass unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
Chance, another mainstay from the shared vocabulary of Cage and Grimmer, guides 
"Palisade" with a free, invisible hand. Every day the gallery is open, the 
frozen stone mass is replaced, and every few days, the stones that have fallen 
into the trough are gathered again, but even following this cyclic maintenance 
of the work, no two moments of its life are ever the same, either visually or 
aurally. The basic structure of "Palisade" remains a constant, as does the 
force of gravity that helps activate it, but the evolving shape and sound of 
the work are left to the variables of temperature, humidity and, most of all, 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
Random gestures and patterns have appeared with some frequency in the art of 
the past century, but even in the work of such worshipers of the chance 
occurence as Duchamp or Arp, chance has been more of a medium than a message. 
It has been integral to the process of a work's creation, but usually not to 
its fixed, finite and static product. In Grimmer's work, chance presides 
throughout the entire duration of a work, for the work itself is continually 
in-process. 
</P>
<P>
Grimmer's choice of the palisade form, traditionally used for defensive 
enclosures, takes on added meaning in light of her work's relationship to 
chance. The palisade's wooden stakes embrace an inner realm where chance and 
spontaneity reign. They distinguish -- and protect -- this realm from that 
beyond, the everyday world of order, control and rational thought. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the environment that is "Palisade" tend to stand at the opening of 
the circle of posts, on the brink between the two realms, but it is toward the 
inner world, that of the delicate spirit and spontaneous soul, that Grimmer 
pulls us, rapt and willing. 
</P>
<P>
The formal simplicity of "Palisade" has its own, deep-seated appeal. Grimmer, 
born and raised in northern Japan and now living in Los Angeles, respects the 
purity and honesty of her raw, organic materials. They are as true to nature as 
the cyclic quality of "Palisade," where ice melts into water then is frozen 
once again, where stones are gathered together, left to disperse, then gathered 
again. 
</P>
<P>
The rich, meditative quality of stones in traditional Japanese gardening 
infuses Grimmer's work with an added layer of significance.

'WISEGUY' PLOT THICKENS, BUT WHO'S THE FALL GUY HERE?; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: KEN WAHL, CBS, THE PRODUCER AND WAHL'S AGENT GIVE CONFLICTING 
STORIES ON THE FUTURE OF THE STAR AND THE SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was enough confusion surrounding the future of Ken Wahl and "Wiseguy" 
Friday to warrant an investigation by undercover agent Vinnie Terranova. 
</P>
<P>
CBS pulled the hourlong drama from its prime-time schedule last Tuesday with 
the promise that it would be remodeled and returned to the air next winter at 
mid-season. The network said that Wahl, who has starred as Terranova since the 
series debuted in 1987, would depart after appearing in the first two to four 
episodes to help segue to a new federal agent played by Steven Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
Not true, Wahl told The Times on Thursday night through what sounded like 
gritted teeth: "The information was incorrect." He said he was dropped against 
his will. 
</P>
<P>
But his agent, Bill Block of the InterTalent Agency, had told The Times only 
moments earlier that Wahl and executive producer Stephen J. Cannell, the 
series' co-creator, were "working things out creatively." 
</P>
<P>
That drew a laugh from Wahl, calling via modular phone from Mexico City, where 
he is making a feature film, "The Taking of Beverly Hills." "Well, that's news 
to me," he said. "I don't think so. They don't want me back on the show and 
that's fair enough. Cannell's the boss. It's his name on the building; he can 
do what he wants. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't feel obligated to introduce another character." 
</P>
<P>
Cannell, one of TV's most prolific and successful writer-producers, is 
headquartered in his Cannell Building on Hollywood Boulevard and has built a 
studio in Vancouver, British Columbia, where "Wiseguy" episodes were shot along 
with two other Cannell series, "21 Jump Street" and "Booker," both canceled 
this week by the Fox network. 
</P>
<P>
Cannell said Friday that he was "surprised at Ken's response. . . . I have 
letters from him and his attorneys asking that Ken be relieved." He described 
himself as a "Ken Wahl fan" and said that "I still want him to do the show." A 
CBS spokesman said the network "won't be commenting on the situation." 
</P>
<P>
It was not a surprise that "Wiseguy" was put on what Hollywood calls "hiatus," 
since it was usually short on ratings although high in critical regard for its 
bold and quirky plots. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the show's entire writing and producing staff has moved on to 
other jobs and that new hiring is proceeding, with the key creative post being 
filled by Peter Lance, who previously has written for "Miami Vice" and "Crime 
Story." 
</P>
<P>
Some reporters were alerted to the controversy surrounding Wahl's departure 
Thursday by fax memoes from Dorothy Swanson, president of Viewers for Quality 
Television, a Virginia-based advocacy group that claims 3,500 members. She 
quoted Wahl as saying that the show is "near and dear to me" but that he 
"wasn't wanted anymore." He said he would not be doing further episodes because 
the only reason for them was to introduce a new character. 
</P>
<P>
Then later Thursday she sent another fax asking that the first one be ignored 
because Cannell had made it "clear that VQT was not given all the facts by Mr. 
Wahl." 
</P>
<P>
Swanson told The Times that she had gotten caught between warring factions. She 
said that she had received a call from Wahl Wednesday night, wrote the first 
fax and then received from Cannell "a document" -- she wouldn't say what it was 
-- that proved to her that she hadn't had all the facts. 
</P>
<P>
Wahl said the trouble began last season, about mid-production, when he was 
injured and "they (the producers) thought that I was trying to get out of the 
show. They didn't believe the doctors and they didn't believe me about being 
hurt. . . . And this was an old injury from the previous season when I got run 
over by a camera dolly twice and tore up my Achilles tendon and all my 
ligaments in my right ankle." 
</P>
<P>
At that point, another actor was brought in as another agent of the Organized 
Crime Bureau for a sequence of shows. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to do two days work per episode," Wahl said. "But instead of that, 
they went crazy and got all their lawyers on me and said they were going to sue 
me and this and that. 
</P>
<P>
"As a defense mechanism, I wrote them in my own handwriting a letter that said, 
'Look, I'll finish out the season but I want to get out' -- only to get their 
lawyers off my back, because I had no intention on leaving the show." 
</P>
<P>
The actor said that he later talked with Cannell "and he told me in his own 
words that he didn't like the show for the last two seasons . . . and he was 
going to take it over and do what he wants with it. And he doesn't want to 
fight with me. He thought that he'd get into creative arguments with me. So he 
said, 'Why don't we shake hands and leave it go at that?' I said, 'Fine, I 
don't want to be where I'm not wanted.' " 
</P>
<P>
Wahl said that he received a letter from Cannell's business affairs department 
saying the company wanted him for two to four episodes for next season, and "I 
completely disregarded it. . . . As far as I was concerned with my conversation 
with Cannell, we had gone our separate ways."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: PICTURE THE SUMMIT AS A TV TALK FEST;

Gorby, dude.

Yes, Friday morning's diverting appearance of First Ladies Barbara Bush and 
Raisa Gorbachev at Wellesley College -- covered live by CNN and the Big 3 
networks -- was not only great fun, but also a tribute to Barbara Bush's 
ability to spin success from controversy. And what about those earlier TV 
pictures from the Bush-Gorbachev summit?

</P>
<P>
All very nice, sometimes even fascinating. What makes television coverage of 
the summit so compelling is not the pictures, however. It's the talk. 
</P>
<P>
Not so much the talk of Bush and Gorbachev, but the talk of those watching 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying this gathering of world leaders is an even larger TV gathering of 
professional Soviet watchers. It's as if some Eastern universities and think 
tanks gave their specialists time off this week to appear on TV. From CBS to 
C-SPAN, they fill the screen. 
</P>
<P>
As usual on Soviet-related topics, CBS gives you Stephen Cohen of Princeton 
while ABC offers Robert Legvold of Columbia, as well as Marshall Goldman of 
Harvard and journalist Hedrick Smith. NBC has the oft-seen Soviet foreign 
ministry official Vitaly Churkin and William Hyland,editor of Foreign Affairs. 
And there are others. 
</P>
<P>
At no other time than summits does TV offer such a concentrated discussion of 
the Soviet Union, and it's all wonderfully entertaining. It's also important, 
for this intense focusing -- as CNN and, to a lesser extent, the other networks 
weave through the summit -- is invaluable in centering our attention on crucial 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
When watching the summit coverage, however, channel hopping is the best course. 
</P>
<P>
That's because there has been no consensus here, and what strikes you most 
about the experts -- as well as the media covering this event -- is that they 
disagree frequently: 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev is politically strong at home; he's weak at home. He's about to be 
toppled; he'll survive indefinitely. Boris Yeltsen will supplant Gorbachev; 
Yeltsen is more bark than bite. Gorbachev needs to look good with Bush to 
impress the people at home; the average Soviet at home doesn't give a hoot 
about the summit. Gorbachev is pretending to deal from strength; Gorbachev is 
feigning weakness to gain concessions from an American President who wants to 
keep him in power. 
</P>
<P>
Even on small things, there are clashing observations. When Gorbachev went on 
his handshaking tour Thursday, CNN's Bernard Shaw found it ironic that the 
Soviet leader could go out among the people in the United States, where his 
popularity is high, but not in his own nation, where his popularity is low. 
</P>
<P>
When ABC's "World News Tonight" covered the same story, however, Peter Jennings 
said that Gorbachev does go out among the people at home. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the summit coverage has exposed the meaninglessness of 
political labels. The talk on TV has been that Gorbachev is less liberal than 
Yeltsen, who has called for faster democratic reforms, and less conservative 
than Kremlin hard-liners, who seek a return to old repressive ways. 
</P>
<P>
In other other words, proponents of democracy in the Soviet Union are 
left-wingers and Marxists are right-wingers. Get it? Conservatives are pinko 
and liberals are reactionary. And the President of the Soviet Union is somehow 
a centrist. Or something like that. 
</P>
<P>
We need experts to interpret speeches, right? Gorbachev's opening address 
contained a reference to the suffering of the Soviet people during World War 
II. On ABC, Goldman interpreted this as Gorbachev justifying Soviet fears of a 
more-powerful united Germany facing the Soviet Union as a member of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
Probably so. Yet why didn't Gorbachev just come out and say it? In fact, why do 
world leaders and diplomats speak an obtuse language that has to be dissected 
under a microscope, leaving open the possibility of misinterpretation? 
</P>
<P>
Things that pass unnoticed: One was Soviet 
journalist/reporter/you-pick-the-label Vladimir Pozner saying on CNN's 
"Crossfire" that he recently prepared a story on Yeltsen but "Soviet television 
wouldn't put it on." Another was Bush and Gorbachev, who supposedly are meeting 
to make the world a safer place, getting a traditional salute -- from cannon. 
</P>
<P>
The summit has not been without humor. From Johnny Carson on NBC, about his 
audience waiting in line to attend "The Tonight Show": "If you stood in line 
that long in the Soviet Union, you could have gotten a potato." From Dan Rather 
on CBS: "It's been said about Gorbachev in the Soviet Union, he could talk a 
dog off a meat wagon." 
</P>
<P>
After Wellesley, Barbara Bush could too.

CONTROVERSY OVER BART SIMPSON T-SHIRTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This letter is in response to Randy Lewis's article about Bart Simpson and the 
T-shirt controversy. ("Let's Give the Kids a Break on the Bart Simpson 
T-Shirts, OK?" May 13.) 
</P>
<P>
A break! . . . I realize it's just one thing. By itself it appears to be 
perfectly harmless. But added to the TV shows offered today, the drug 
availability, the push towards having bigger and better things, the decline in 
church attendance, the breakdown of our families (due in part to working moms 
-- for whatever reason), the increased divorce rate, single-parent homes and 
the shared custody of children, the gradual increase in acceptability of 
homosexuality, the increase in violent crime, the increase in child abuse . . . 
the list goes on. 
</P>
<P>
My point is, I can't accept one more "little thing" because it is affecting the 
moral fiber of the country. It is destroying our lives. Think about the little 
things. They eventually grow into big things if you let them.

WHO GETS TO DECIDE WHAT IS BANNED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Krauthammer's essay on censorship is a cogent argument for limitations 
of public expression ("We All Believe in Censorship," April 29). However, I am 
uncertain as to who should interpret the limits. I sense a leaning toward the 
Hamiltonian principle that people of education and property know best what is 
good and proper. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers and television are meant to appeal to a wide family audience. 
Self-censorship is called for, guided by community standards and the sense of 
good taste of the editors. Museums, libraries and similar centers have a more 
limited audience and can advise visitors of the type of material to be seen 
there. A problem with community censorship of these centers is the lack of 
consensus of standards of what is acceptable. Anthony Comstock was an outspoken 
activist and was influential in imposing certain standards that did not reflect 
universal American views. "Banned in Boston" became a catch phrase for ridicule 
of public protection of private morality. Remember when the movie "The Moon Is 
Blue" was denied the approval of the Legion of Decency because the words virgin 
and seduce were used? 
</P>
<P>
One of the chief standards in censorship seems to be nudity and erotic art. My 
wife and I walked two or three miles in Florence to see a larger-than-life-size 
statue of a naked man. In the Vatican, we craned our necks to look at the 
ceiling of the Sistine Chapel where nudes are to be found amid the panorama. I 
felt intellectually enriched by the experience. I have not seen the 
Mapplethorpe show, although I have seen some photos by Mapplethorpe in 
bookstores. Some of the photographs were very repellent to me; in others I saw 
beauty. I believe that it would be wrong for anyone to tell me that I could not 
view either David or Mapplethorpe. 
</P>
<P>
I have serious reservations about whether tax funds should be subsidizing art, 
music and literature, just as I have reservations about spending on "Star 
Wars." If funds are to be granted, those funds should be without strings. 
Otherwise, the artists become propagandists for the politicians and bureaucrats 
dispensing the funds. Carried to extremes, it leads to burning of books and 
adding fig leafs to statues.

Credit where credit is due: Allan Parachini is doing a magnificent job covering 
the National Endowment for the Arts censorship issue. He's presented the facts 
and gotten material no one else has -- for example, the recent interview with 
the NEA's top lawyer about the constitutional problem of prior restraint and 
the story about debarment. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times doesn't seem to think that news about the politics of 
culture belongs in its culture section; fortunately for us, the L.A. Times 
does.

A hodgepodge of entertainment featuring everything from Croation Kolo dancers 
to a performance piece about a Roman Catholic priest with AIDS will be 
presented at the downtown Japanese American Cultural and Community Center on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The free event, which will run from noon-5 p.m., is being held as a 75th 
anniversary celebration for the nonprofit California Community Foundation, 
which among other activities, administers the Brody Arts Fund Fellowships that 
are awarded annually to multicultural artists in various disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's performances, to be held both on the indoor stage of the Japan America 
Theatre and on an outdoor stage in the JACCC Plaza, will feature 20 past Brody 
recipients performing such diverse works as Peruvian music and dance, 
traditional Cambodian pin peat music and Persian folk dance. The event's 
organizers expect about 5,000 people to attend. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to have a celebration, and we thought the best way to celebrate was 
to celebrate cultural diversity," said California Community Foundation 
President Jack Shakely, who noted his foundation will spend about $15,000 on 
the day's events. "What we came up with was to have our Brody winners perform." 
</P>
<P>
Performances will not be the only feature of Sunday's festivities, however. In 
keeping with the CCF's philanthropic functions -- the foundation has an 
endowment of more than $90 million and manages more than 320 individual funds 
benefiting diverse concerns -- the event will also feature multicultural food 
booths to raise funds for the homeless. Participating restaurants include 
Bombay Cafe (Indian), Guardel's (Argentine), Tamayo's (Mexican), Orleans 
(Cajun), Pane Caldo (Italian), Philippe's The Original (French) and Piacere 
Espresso (various coffees). Each restaurant will offer food for $1, and 
proceeds will go toward CCF donations of $1,000 each to 10 Skid Row charities.

PRODUCER PUTS KIBOSH ON GLITZ AT TONY AWARDS

There will be some changes made when they give out the Tony Awards this year if 
Joseph Cates has his way. He wants to take out the glitzy variety numbers and 
all those boring thank-you speeches. 
</P>
<P>
Cates, who has a couple of Emmys on his shelf for past musical programs, is 
likely to prevail since he's the executive producer of "The 44th Annual Tony 
Awards" special to air on CBS Sunday at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Cates -- brother of Gil Cates, who produced last year's Academy Awards show, 
father of actress Phoebe Cates and therefore father-in-law of Kevin Kline -- 
has never done a Tony show before. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I did was to screen the last six of them," he said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that scenes from eight Broadway shows -- four musicals and four 
straight plays -- are the heart of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Cates said that he tried to group things differently -- for example, putting 
together the three big awards for director, actor and actress in a play. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed a theme to get some promotion," Cates said, "so I made it the year 
of the actor to knit it together. Five times during the evening the stage will 
go dark except for a single spotlight that will play on a single actor. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the essence of theater -- the single actor who commands you with his 
personality, charisma and talent." 
</P>
<P>
The single spot will shine on Morgan Freeman performing "All the World's a 
Stage" from "As You Like It," Kevin Kline instructing the players from 
"Hamlet," Geraldine Fitzgerald doing a scene from "The Royal Family" by George 
S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber, Len Cariou as James Tyrone in "Long Day's Journey 
Into Night" and Philip Bosco reciting "Our revels now are ended" from "The 
Tempest." 
</P>
<P>
He also has tried to bring in big stars from film and television who still 
return to the theater -- Kathleen Turner as host, along with Matthew Broderick, 
Jessica Tandy, Christopher Reeve, Michael Crawford, Bernadette Peters, Ron 
Silver, James Earl Jones, Sandy Duncan, Linda Lavin, Tyne Daly, Lily Tomlin, 
Timothy Hutton, Dixie Carter and Barnard Hughes.

YOUTH FOR CHRIST HEADQUARTERS LEAVING ILLINOIS FOR COLORADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Youth for Christ, an evangelical organization that had Billy Graham as one of 
its first employees, has announced that it is moving its national headquarters 
to Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Its headquarters had been in Wheaton and Carol Stream, Ill., in suburban 
Chicago, which has been called the nation's evangelical capital because of the 
many Christian groups based there. 
</P>
<P>
Youth for Christ has 235 chapters around the country, 900 staff persons and 
8,000 volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the organization said that Dallas, Indianapolis and Orlando, Fla., 
were also considered for the new headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Reasons for the move included lower costs and a desire to develop "more of our 
own identity" by relocating "out of an area where there are so many Christian 
organizations." 
</P>
<P>
Another large organization, Campus Crusade for Christ, last year announced that 
it will move its headquarters from San Bernardino to Orlando.

DISCOVERY: BECOMING A LITERACY TUTOR 
</P>

Shortly after he saw a television special on adult illiteracy, Hans Clements 
happened to pick up a flyer that told about a volunteer tutor program at the 
Newhope Library in Santa Ana. Tutors were needed to work on a one-to-one basis 
with adults who wanted to improve their reading and writing skills. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd never tried to teach anything before," Clements said. "But after seeing 
the television program, I began to wonder what life would be like if I couldn't 
read. So I decided tutoring would be a worthwhile thing to try." 
</P>
<P>
Clements completed a 15-hour training session and in February was assigned to 
work with Jim, a warehouse supervisor who had never learned to read. "He was 
</P>
<P>
very eager to make progress," Clements said. "So we decided to meet at the 
library for two hours every Tuesday and Thursday night." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Jim could barely struggle through a book written at the third-grade 
level. But after three months of steady improvement, he is taking on more 
difficult tasks, like reading newspapers and instruction manuals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun to see how much difference it has made in his life," Clements said. 
"Tutoring takes a lot of time and patience, but I've gotten back 100% of 
</P>
<P>
what I've put into it." 
</P>
<P>
The need for volunteer tutors increases every year, according to Marian Mosher 
of the South Coast Literacy Council. "Adult illiteracy has received a lot of 
media attention recently, and people are less afraid to come forward for help," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The literacy problem is compounded in Orange County by the increasing number of 
immigrants arriving every year who need help learning English. According to the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service, Orange County now ranks fourth 
</P>
<P>
in the nation in the number of immigrants received every year. And the INS 
estimate does not include those who live here illegally. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a mixture of ability levels among the recent immigrants. Many of them 
have highly developed skills in their native language, and when they come here 
it's frustrating not to be able to communicate. They are very motivated to 
learn English and qualify for a better job," Mosher said. "Others have weak 
skills in their own language, and that's why individual tutoring works so well. 
The instruction is centered around the student's rate of learning." 
</P>
<P>
Mosher has taught people from 17 different countries since becoming a tutor 
five years ago. "I've made some lifetime friends. It's very rewarding," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tutor training sessions are sponsored by the Orange County Public Library and 
Orange County's four volunteer literacy councils. The free workshops are held 
year-round in 75 locations throughout the county. Volunteer tutors receive free 
instructional materials and certification as a literacy trainer. Literacy 
councils assist in matching students and teachers, who meet at mutually 
convenient times and locations. 
</P>
<P>
Hours: Hours vary, but most tutor training workshops are conducted during 
evenings and on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Address: Workshops are held in public libraries and selected sites throughout 
Orange County. Contact the California Literacy Council at the number listed 
below for information on upcoming training sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone: (818) 282-2196 
</P>
<P>
Miscellaneous information: The minimum qualification to become a volunteer 
tutor is the ability to read and write in English. No college degree, teaching 
credential or foreign language ability is required. JANICE L. JONES

UTAH MINERS -- VICTIMS OF ATOMIC AGE; 
</P>
<P>
THOSE WHO DUG URANIUM FROM THE EARTH SUFFER A HIGH RATE OF CANCER. THOUGH 
OFFICIALS HAD EARLY WARNINGS, THEY DID LITTLE TO EASE THE DANGER. CONGRESS 
CONSIDERS COMPENSATION.

MARYSVALE, Utah 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The uranium mine is shut now. Has been for years. Air compressors, tools, coils 
and pulleys are rusting on the ground. Yet the men who once worked the mine 
continue to die. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Frederick toiled in this mine and was happy to get the work until it 
closed in 1966. Each morning he would leave before sunrise and work deep 
underground, operating the heavy water drill and carving out chunks of rock 
from inside the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Lynn Frederick is missing a lung. He lost it last January after it was 
diagnosed as cancerous. He is not alone. 
</P>
<P>
By the count of the people in this tiny, isolated community in southwest Utah, 
31 of the 50 or so men who worked in the uranium mines around here either have 
cancer or have died of it. Health experts predict that hundreds more who worked 
in uranium mines will be dead before it is over, that the price to be paid here 
on the Colorado Plateau will be heavy indeed. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even know what uranium was," said Frederick, 62, who now waits for 
the day when cancer will claim his remaining lung. "All I knew was that it 
meant a steady paycheck." 
</P>
<P>
This is where the legacy of the nuclear weapons industry begins for the 
American West, the testing ground of the Atomic Age. And Marysvale is a natural 
starting place in the story, because it is one of the spots in the United 
States where uranium was first wrested from the earth to make atomic bombs. 
</P>
<P>
As the decades have passed and the events have unfolded, it has become clear 
that the estimated 15,000 miners who worked underground to provide uranium for 
the nation's defense put themselves at serious risk because few precautions 
were taken to protect them from exposure to radiation. It is also a story that 
has largely gone untold because it took place in one of the most sparsely 
populated areas of the country. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures supplied by the Centers for Disease Control, 350 of 4,146 
uranium miners studied since the early 1950s have died of lung cancer -- five 
times the normal death rate. Health experts say much of the reason for the 
large number of deaths is that the mines were poorly ventilated and, as a 
result, miners inhaled an inordinate quantity of radioactive particles. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1951 report on uranium mines, radiologist William F. Bale wrote that 
uranium miners were being subjected to radon doses that were 440 times the 
maximum allowed then by the Atomic Energy Commission. And his was not the first 
warning about the dangers of uranium mining. 
</P>
<P>
Among the victims were hundreds of Navajo Indians, who "were sent into the 
mines without any protective clothing, face masks or respirators," said Leonard 
Haskie, interim chairman of the Navajo Tribal Council in testimony last March 
before a Senate subcommittee. "Because they did not know of the hazards, they 
ate their lunches in the mines and drank the water running through the mines. 
They also brought radioactive material out of the mines to build their homes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denies Responsibility 
</P>
<P>
There is a sub-plot to this story as well, one in which the Atomic Energy 
Commission knew of the dangers of mining for uranium without proper ventilation 
but failed to correct the problem. Instead, the AEC, now the Department of 
Energy, disclaimed any responsibility for miner safety, saying that it could be 
accountable for uranium and the safety of people around it only after it had 
arrived at the processing mills. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. Public Health Service failed to tell miners they were at 
risk, even as a secret ongoing study clearly showed that more and more of them 
were dying of cancer. To further compound the problem, most of the miners with 
cancer, as well as the families of those who have died from the disease, have 
been unable to collect workers' compensation. In many cases, the statute of 
limitations for filing a claim had run out long ago. 
</P>
<P>
Now, more then 20 years after the last mine was closed down because the U.S. 
government had stockpiled all the uranium it needed, the latest in a series of 
bills has been introduced in Congress to compensate the miners. The legislation 
would establish a $100-million trust fund for those who have contracted cancer 
as a result of mining or being exposed to radiation from atomic bomb testing, 
people commonly known as "down-winders." 
</P>
<P>
By most estimates, about 25,000 people down range of the Nevada nuclear test 
site were exposed to radiation during the '50s when bombs were being detonated 
above ground. Critics of the Atomic Energy Commission contend that the people 
who lived in the desolate areas of Nevada, Utah and Arizona where the fallout 
occurred were exposed to lethal doses of radiation that also killed thousands 
of sheep. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), who introduced the legislation in the Senate, 
said in a statement last February that the level of exposure for the 
down-winders was "in large part, due to the government's unconscionable failure 
to properly care for or warn these victims." 
</P>
<P>
After a Senate subcommittee hearing in 1979, a report titled "The Forgotten 
Guinea Pigs" said the "government totally failed to provide adequate protection 
for the residents of the area. . . . The greatest irony of our atmospheric 
testing program is that the only victims of U.S. nuclear arms since World War 
II have been our own people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposed by Bush 
</P>
<P>
The bill, currently making its way through the legislative process, is opposed 
by the Bush Administration and the U.S. Department of Justice, based on the 
argument that there are other avenues of relief and that there is no absolute 
medical proof that mining and atomic testing led to later diseases. In a letter 
written last February, Acting Assistant Atty. Gen. Bruce Navarro described the 
bill as too broad, unjustified and expensive. 
</P>
<P>
The House version of the bill seeking relief for the miners and down-winders is 
scheduled for a vote on Tuesday. That bill was introduced by Rep. Wayne Owens 
(D-Utah). 
</P>
<P>
Miners and down-winders have both sued for compensation in the past, but the 
courts have ruled that the federal government is immune from liability. But in 
both cases, the courts have said the plight of those exposed should be dealt 
with by Congress. In a 1985 ruling against the uranium miners, U.S. Judge 
Blaine Anderson of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said: "This is the type of 
case that cries out for redress, but the courts are not able to give it. 
Congress is the appropriate source." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart L. Udall, the former secretary of the Interior, said the legislation 
making its way through the Congress may be the last best hope for the miners 
and the down-winders after more than 40 years of being shunted aside. He has 
worked for more than 11 years, either as a lawyer or advocate, for those 
affected by radiation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this year is the year of decision," he said in a recent interview. "If 
we don't get it this year, that would be the final, unfortunate end to it. 
We're asking Congress to make a gesture in the direction of justice." 
</P>
<P>
In Udall's view, the story of the miners on the Colorado Plateau -- which takes 
in parts of Utah, New Mexico, Colorado and Arizona -- as well as the 
down-winders, is about a group of people who are paying the price because the 
government believed that atomic weapons had to be built, no matter what the 
cost. And Marysvale, in a sense, is a microcosm for them both. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dying Slow Death 
</P>
<P>
Marysvale, like many of the people in it, is dying a slow death. Its roads are 
dirt and there is only a single gas station and a couple of rundown motels. The 
dominant building in town is the Mormon church, which sits atop a hill. 
</P>
<P>
But Marysvale was not always like this. It was once a 19th-Century Gold Rush 
town. During the uranium boom, it had two schools, a theater, five gas stations 
and a train depot. In those days, a man could make the hefty sum of $400 a week 
in the mines. 
</P>
<P>
And uranium, for certain, was king in this part of the country. Before the 
uranium mining, this was a land of hard-scrabble poverty, where a vegetable 
garden was essential and new clothes were rare. The people hereabouts took 
pride in the fact that the mines were upgrading their lives. And there was no 
reason to feel endangered, because it was the government that needed the ore. 
</P>
<P>
"We were innocent," said Joan Anderson, whose husband's right lung was removed 
in 1987. "We didn't question certain people -- our parents, doctors, our 
government. The public is more educated now, but back then we just didn't 
question the government. We trusted them. And remember, we were deathly afraid 
of communists. We were determined to get that ore to defend ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
"They needed the ore so damn bad they forgot everything else," she added. "They 
wanted the ore out and they were willing to sacrifice their own countrymen to 
get it." 
</P>
<P>
So the men went into the mines, unaware that as early as 1948, one of the 
Atomic Energy Commission's own scientists, Dr. Merrill Eisenbud, had warned 
that there was a danger of radiation exposure. What the miners also did not 
know was that there was already a large body of research in Europe which showed 
that Czech and German miners who had been exposed to radiation were dying of 
lung cancer at uncommonly high rates. And the miners didn't think it terribly 
unusual that government doctors came around a couple of times a year to do 
their tests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recounts Warning 
</P>
<P>
Victor Archer remembers that because he was one of the doctors. In 1956, he 
came west with his family to continue the tests on miners that had been started 
in the late '40s by the U.S. Public Health Service. He had been warned in 
Washington before he left that talking out loud about the dangers of uranium 
mining would not serve him well. 
</P>
<P>
He had heard the story of Dr. Wilhelm Hueper, a researcher with the American 
Cancer Institute, who had given a speech about the danger in the mines, only to 
have his travel restricted to east of the Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
"I resolved to keep my mouth shut and stay out of trouble if I could," said 
Archer in a recent interview at his University of Utah School of Medicine, 
where he is a clinical researcher. "I took the attitude of the disinterested 
scientist. I said, 'Let's learn all we can from this experience.' " 
</P>
<P>
One thing the scientists already knew at that point was the culprit believed to 
be causing the health problems. It was not radon itself, an inert gas often 
found in mines. Rather, it was the material formed after the radon was released 
into the atmosphere by blasting and drilling. 
</P>
<P>
When that happens, radon begins to decay, forming other radioactive elements 
that are called daughters. After 13 stages of decay, the radioactive material 
that the miners breathed was Polonium-210-lead, which had attached itself to 
dust particles that were dense in the shaft because there was little or no 
ventilation. 
</P>
<P>
But those were different days, and even though there was a predicted health 
danger because of lack of ventilation, no one took it very seriously. Archer 
said it became obvious that only a growing tragedy would attract notice. 
</P>
<P>
"It became apparent we were going to have to pile up enough bodies to get their 
attention, enough dead to convince them there really was a problem," said 
Archer. 
</P>
<P>
So the testing began. And it is still being carried out today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Owners Issue Threat 
</P>
<P>
The public health workers would show up once or twice a year with their 
trailers that doubled as medical clinics. They would take sputum samples, but 
never say a word about what they were doing, other than in broad, vague terms. 
Archer said the mine operators threatened to bar health officials from 
conducting their tests if the miners were alarmed about the dangers of their 
work. And if the owners barred them, it would ruin the ongoing study. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, life chugged along in Marysvale. The Hoover Cafe had a huge chunk of 
uranium ore on its counter for years. Miners would search out the warmest spots 
in the underground caves to eat their lunch, not knowing that these were the 
places where they were most likely to be bombarded with radiation. 
</P>
<P>
Other miners would bring particularly "hot" rocks home to amuse their families, 
showing them how the ore made a Geiger counter jump off the scale. Miners would 
occasionally have contests to see who was most radioactive. Some people 
fashioned rock gardens out of uranium ore, shining black lights on them at 
night to make them glow. 
</P>
<P>
There were no changing rooms at the mine, so the workers came home each night 
covered with radioactive dust. Mothers washed their husbands' clothes along 
with those of their children. 
</P>
<P>
When Lynn Frederick came home from work, his twin daughters would jump up for a 
kiss. But something strange would happen to one of the daughters, Jane Wiley, 
who is now a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd hug him for some loving, but within minutes come down with a nauseatingly 
painful headache," she recalled. Years later, the memory of those headaches 
still haunts her when she thinks of how her own daughter died of 
hydroencephalitis (water on the brain). Her sister's stillborn baby did not 
have a skull. 
</P>
<P>
That the Atomic Energy Commission suspected there were dangers in the mines is 
without question. An AEC report written in 1952 stated that the exposure to 
radon and radon daughters in the mines was "too high for safe operation" and 
that the mines should be properly ventilated. Little was done, however, until 
1971, when the federal government established mine safety standards. Why the 
AEC did nothing is a matter of conjecture. 
</P>
<P>
"They decided for reasons that nobody has ever explained, so you have to 
guess," said Udall. "I think they didn't want to be bothered, that they wanted 
to get the thing (nuclear weapons industry) on line so they went down that 
road." 
</P>
<P>
"You look at it today and it's amazing nobody blew the whistle on them," he 
said. "The evidence is powerful and overwhelming that the AEC knew (of the 
dangers) at the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Arden Higgens, who had a tumor removed from his lung in 1983, walked from grave 
to grave at the Marysvale cemetery, pointing to the markers of Marysvale 
residents who had died of lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"Go to cemeteries in nearby towns and you'll see more of the same," he said. 
"It makes you real sad to see all of them together like this -- William 
Cropper, Dan Rosequist, Byron Hanson, Carl Norton, Alvin Christensen, they all 
got the cancer." 
</P>
<P>
Higgens bent over to rearrange the silk flowers at every grave. Above him was 
one of the old mines. 
</P>
<P>
"We call it Cancer Hill now," he said.

AQMD APPROVES LIMITS ON 10 CARCINOGENS IN AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Declaring that toxic substances in the air are threatening public health, the 
South Coast Air Quality Management District on Friday approved controversial 
new limits on industrial emissions of 10 cancer-causing air contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
The new rule, which takes effect immediately, requires all new and existing 
businesses that expand or relocate within the region to be able to comply with 
the new limits or be denied a permit to operate equipment that produces the 
pollution. The AQMD estimates about 250 businesses a year would be affected in 
the South Coast Air Basin -- Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
The kinds of businesses most likely to be affected by the new rule include 
gasoline stations, hospitals, dry cleaners and metal-treating and plating 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
The rule is evidence that the district, which once focused only on fighting 
smog, is beginning to move more forcefully into new areas to improve air 
quality. In the past, many toxic substances in the air that may have posed a 
health threat were not regulated because they did not contribute to the 
formation of smog. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new standard, the risk to the surrounding community of developing 
cancer from any of the 10 targeted contaminants must not exceed 10 in 1 
million. The health risk is based on constant exposure over a 70-year lifetime. 
Businesses would have to show their ability to comply before any new 
pollution-producing equipment is used. Denials would be based on computer 
projections of anticipated emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 targeted contaminants, benzene -- an ingredient in gasoline -- is the 
most prevalent. The second is hexavalent chromium, a microscopic particle 
produced in chrome plating and other metal-treating operations. 
</P>
<P>
But in approving the rule on an 11-1 vote, the board gave companies an 
additional five years to comply if needed emission-control equipment has not 
been developed or is otherwise unobtainable. During the grace period, the 
allowable health risk from these businesses could be as high as 100 in a 
million -- 10 times greater than the new standard. 
</P>
<P>
The time extension was approved over the protests of board member Sabrina 
Schiller, who cast the only dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a significant weakening of an already-weak regulation," said Schiller, 
who had argued for a much tighter health standard of one in 1 million. "It 
seems to go against everything the state and our federal government has 
attempted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Jan Chatten-Brown, president of the Coalition for Clean Air, complained that 
even with the new rule, regulation of toxic substances in the air remains "the 
one gaping hole in the program to protect the public health from air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
"Our air basin is checkered with toxic hot spots," she said. "The district's 
failure to take appropriate action is a complete capitulation to industry and 
an abdication of their duty to the public." 
</P>
<P>
But board member Larry Berg, who proposed the five-year grace period after 
business representatives complained a stricter time frame would discourage new 
businesses from locating here, rejected the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"Eight years ago I was treated for cancer (of the vocal chords) and three of my 
friends have lung cancer. I'm sensitive to this issue," Berg said. "I do not 
think (the extension) substantially weakens this rule. . . . It is painfully 
evident to me that we needed to do something or we won't pass (it)." 
</P>
<P>
AQMD Executive Officer James M. Lents told the board most companies would be 
able to comply with the stricter standard. He predicted only two to three firms 
a year would apply for the grace period. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a pressure relief valve," Lents said of the grace period. "Only a few 
sources fall into this category. . . . We think (they) would not represent an 
overwhelming public exposure." 
</P>
<P>
For the last six years, the AQMD has attempted to limit toxic matter in the 
air, but had no formal regulation to back up enforcement efforts and had little 
success. Most businesses, even when challenged by the AQMD, were able to 
conduct business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles attorney Robert Wyman, who represents an industry coalition, 
applauded the regulation, noting that the five-year grace period satisfied 
their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really not talking about significant risk (differences)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When the regulation was first discussed at a meeting two weeks ago, business 
interests and some board members worried that the proposed health risk of 10 in 
1 million was overly strict and would reduce cancer risks only slightly and 
impose unnecessary hardships on business. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to benzene and hexavalent chromium, other contaminants covered by 
the rule are asbestos, cadmium, carbon tetrachloride, chlorinated dioxins and 
dibenzofurans, ethylene dibromide, ethylene dichloride, ethylene oxide and 
methylene chloride.

GORBACHEV CHIDES U.S. OVER TRADE; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: HE TELLS CONGRESSMEN OF SOVIET PROBLEMS AND PRESSES FOR 
MOST-FAVORED-NATION STATUS ENJOYED BY CHINA. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In an extraordinary dialogue, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev expounded 
to congressional leaders Friday for more than an hour on his nation's crippled 
economy and chided the United States for withholding from Moscow the trade 
benefits already enjoyed by China. 
</P>
<P>
"What should we do for you to give us MFN?" he asked, referring to the 
most-favored-nation trading status sought by the Soviet Union. Then he added, 
with sarcasm: "Maybe we should introduce presidential rule in the Baltics and 
at least fire some rounds in the Baltics." 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers listened intently and praised Gorbachev's eloquence but insisted 
that Moscow first must relent in response to demands for independence by the 
Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia before approval of the trade 
status granting best-possible tariff rates on Soviet imports is assured. 
</P>
<P>
"MFN's a possibility, but so is snow," said Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole 
of Kansas on a day with temperatures in the low 80s. 
</P>
<P>
Later Friday, President Bush announced that the two leaders had signed a trade 
treaty intended to pave the way to normalized trade relations between the two 
countries, although it does not grant the most-favored-nation status that 
Gorbachev wants. 
</P>
<P>
At times combative and at others genial, Gorbachev appeared self-assured and 
serene despite the economic and political crises bedeviling him at home, 
lawmakers said after his 90-minute breakfast session with Republican and 
Democratic leaders of the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"He does not appear to be a man who is beside himself with worry," said House 
Democratic leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri. "Kind of like if you're 
rebuilding your house. It's a big mess while you're going through it." 
</P>
<P>
But Dole added: "I think he desperately wants some give on the trade side. If 
he doesn't get it (at the summit meetings), he'll go home empty-handed." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev argued strongly for "a favorable gesture" from Congress on trade as 
well as loans to help develop the Soviet economy as it tries to make the 
transition to a Western-style, market-oriented system. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, he conceded, trade accords would provide a bigger political 
benefit than an actual economic advantage, since it would take years to build 
up what he called the "primitive" level of trade between the United States and 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a good relationship going, but we need some economic moves, some 
economic steps now," the Soviet leader said at the session with legislative 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in a rare critical comment from a foreign leader, Gorbachev added: "We 
cannot wait for Congress and congressional leadership to mature. . . . Congress 
is a problem, I think, right now." 
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to beg for anything," he declared at the outset of the meeting. 
"Certainly we are not asking for a free ride. We will be asking for normal 
credits and of course we will be (re)paying and paying the interest." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev also sharply rebuffed a suggestion by Gephardt that the Soviet 
legislature should give final approval to a new emigration law before the 
United States grants most-favored-nation status. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader said the law already has received a preliminary vote of 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the reality of the situation, its provisions are in effect," he 
said. "The flow of emigres from the Soviet Union is practically not braked. . . 
. Maybe you were looking for a pretext in order to put a brake on this process 
of adopting most-favored-nation treatment." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all U.S. trading partners have been granted the special trading status, 
which provides lower tariff rates on imports to this country. But a 1974 law 
known as the Jackson-Vanik Amendment bars restoring it to Communist and East 
Bloc countries that have been deprived of it for restricting the free 
emigration of their citizens, unless they do away with the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
While the morning's discussion of trade benefits ended in a standoff, the 
Soviet leader said his government would search for a solution to the Baltic 
crisis "without extreme measures" that would be consistent with Soviet 
constitutional processes. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gorbachev said he is positive that Lithuanians would never vote to 
secede from the Soviet Union, he said that if they did: "Fine, fine, fine -- 
let them do it, and we'll agree." 
</P>
<P>
Dole, however, bluntly told Gorbachev that both Democrats and Republicans would 
raise questions about the Soviet Union's sanctions against Lithuania as well as 
its policy toward independence moves by Latvia and Estonia if trade concessions 
were to be considered. 
</P>
<P>
And Senate Democratic Leader George J. Mitchell (Me.) sharply disputed 
Gorbachev's claim that Moscow's treatment of Lithuania was comparable to the 
U.S. invasion of Panama to remove strongman Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact of the matter is that the overwhelming majority of the Panamanian 
people received gratefully American forces which liberated them," Mitchell said 
in response to Gorbachev's dig. "And while you expressed your opinion that you 
don't think that the majority of the Lithuanian people favor independence, I 
think most of us have a different opinion." 
</P>
<P>
But Senate Democratic Whip Alan Cranston (Calif.) later praised Gorbachev for 
restraint on the Lithuanian issue, adding: "He is plainly eager to work it out 
peacefully." 
</P>
<P>
The lively exchanges with Gorbachev were televised by Cable News Network, 
although the American participants said afterward they were not aware their 
remarks and Gorbachev's long answers were being broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
In an opening statement and during his replies to questions, the Soviet visitor 
challenged the widespread feelings in the West that the political and economic 
ferment in his country is undermining his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledged that more rapid economic improvements are essential in the 
Soviet Union to keep the country stable. 
</P>
<P>
"We have dismantled the old system, but we have not yet put in place a working 
system, a new system," Gorbachev said. "Our ship has lost anchor and therefore 
we're all a little sick." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet citizens, he added, are unprepared for a market-oriented economy and 
must become involved in the process of change in order to understand it. He 
suggested a Soviet-American brain-trust of economists and other scholars to 
help with the transition that he termed a "genuine revolution." 
</P>
<P>
As an example, he said, government subsidies have made bread so cheap in the 
Soviet Union -- one-tenth the cost of bread in the United States -- that it is 
used as footballs by boys in the street and fed to cattle. While the government 
plans to raise bread prices on July 1, it will compensate consumers with higher 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
"People are not against the market per se," he concluded. "What they want is 
for this to be done painlessly." 
</P>
<P>
On other issues, Gorbachev held out the prospect of a Soviet-American joint 
venture to produce commercial airliners as defense industries in both nations 
wind down military output in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East, he recommended that the Americans start a dialogue with 
Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat as the most likely 
person to negotiate a peace agreement that would halt hostilities between 
Israel and Palestinians. The United States has started talks with the PLO 
through Arafat's representatives but is considering breaking them off over 
Wednesday's abortive raid on beaches near Tel Aviv by guerrillas belonging to a 
faction of the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said the Soviet Union is ready to guarantee the sovereignty of all 
nations in the region and recognize Israel if Israel would agree to an 
international conference to discuss Middle East disputes.

COLLEGES FEAR PROPOSED TAX ON STUDENTS 
</P>

<P>
Praised as a municipal sugar daddy and damned as the town's No. 1 deadbeat, 
prestigious Northwestern University is squared off with city fathers here in a 
unique tax spat that could ripple through the academic world. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime this month, the City Council in this tony Chicago suburb of 73,000 
permanent residents is expected to take up a plan to slap a novel tuition tax 
on Northwestern's 10,500 students. It would also apply to students at three 
smaller colleges in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Both critics and supporters of the tax say that the vote will be close. 
However, if the measure is passed and clears expected court challenges, 
educators fear a wave of copycat ordinances in cash-strapped college towns 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
"All local jurisdictions are looking for sources of revenue," said Robert 
Rosenzweig, president of the Washington-based Assn. of American Universities. 
"If this succeeds in one place, it's bound to be attractive to others . . . . I 
think it's a disastrous idea." 
</P>
<P>
But backers of the tuition tax say that Northwestern is a drain on city coffers 
at a time when the treasury is in the red and homeowners have been socked with 
skyrocketing property tax bills. They complain that the school uses public 
services but pays no property taxes and stints on voluntary contributions for 
the upkeep of parks, roads, sewers, fire equipment and the like. 
</P>
<P>
"This university has been so unbelievably chintzy," charged Sidney Zwick, a 
Northwestern alumnus who heads a local senior citizens' group. "It's putting an 
unconscionable burden on our senior citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Evanston would levy a 0.5% tax on tuition paid by students at 
Northwestern, nearby Kendall College and two theological seminaries. At current 
tuition rates, running shy of $14,000 a year for Northwestern, city officials 
estimate that the tax could raise $732,000, about half the municipal deficit. 
It would cost the average Northwestern undergraduate a little over $65 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
That may not sound like much, but it has raised howls of protest from faculty 
and students, who contend that tax supporters have wrongly portrayed 
Northwestern as a bastion of privilege where most students can lean on affluent 
parents to pay the freight. 
</P>
<P>
That is not so, argued Arva Rice, a senior whose college career has been 
dependent on financial aid programs. "The rich kid image that a lot of us have 
at Northwestern isn't really true," Rice told a public hearing on the tax plan 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
John Byrne, another senior, said he had to pinch pennies and borrow more than 
$12,000 to finish school. "Sixty-five dollars to a student is a hell of a lot 
of money," he said. "Sixty-five dollars can help me pay my rent. It can buy two 
weeks of groceries." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Weston, Northwestern's vice president for legal affairs, denied that 
the school has ignored its civic responsibilities. For example, Weston said, 
Northwestern has spent $9 million and pledged up to $16 million more to help 
Evanston develop a research park to attract new business and broaden the local 
tax base. 
</P>
<P>
More important, Weston pointed out that the 139-year-old school, the only 
private university in the Big Ten athletic conference, is not only Evanston's 
largest employer but its chief claim to fame. "Higher education is the 
enterprise that has made Evanston known worldwide," Weston said. "To penalize 
people for pursuing that education is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Cost-sharing frictions are by no means unique to Evanston. Large private and 
public universities often provide a major source of jobs and retail spending 
revenue in their communities, not to mention a wide range of cultural and 
recreational activities that might otherwise not be available to residents. 
But, as nonprofit institutions, they also remove significant chunks of land 
from the tax rolls. 
</P>
<P>
In fatter days, it was a trade-off that college towns accepted willingly. Now, 
squeezed by rising costs, cutbacks in state and federal aid and revolts by 
taxpayers, more and more municipalities are putting the arm on schools to 
voluntarily underwrite city programs. 
</P>
<P>
"With (a) loss (of) federal revenues, cities have been forced to turn elsewhere 
to make up the losses," said David Stewart, the director of community relations 
for Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. "Colleges and universities are seen as 
golden geese." 
</P>
<P>
Many schools are trimming programs and frills to cope with their own budget 
problems. Still, Stewart said, a 1988 Cornell survey showed that many 
universities had begun to make payments in lieu of taxes for local government 
services they may have once gotten for free. 
</P>
<P>
Cornell, for example, will pay the city of Ithaca $125,000 for fire protection 
this year and will also cover $250,000 in operating deficits for the Tompkins 
County bus system, which the school operates under contract. 
</P>
<P>
Yale University has agreed to contribute more than $2 million to New Haven, 
Conn., where it is situated, to help defray a large city budget deficit. In 
Massachusetts, Harvard University last year paid more than $2 million in lieu 
of taxes to the cities of Cambridge and Boston, where it has property. 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from their home towns, three campuses in the University of 
California system also have recently worked out agreements to help ease the 
budget problems of local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The Berkeley campus bought a $300,000 fire engine for the city and agreed to 
fund the salary of an extra staff member for the city planning department. At 
Davis, the school has committed $3 million to help pay for road improvements 
and other community development projects and has agreed to restructure its 
growth plans to favor leasing arrangements over land or building purchases that 
remove property from the tax rolls. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, at Santa Cruz, the university has agreed to share in improvement 
expenses with the city. It drastically scaled back expansion proposals after 
city officials expressed fears that the community of 50,000 could not cope with 
the school if, as planned, it tripled in size over the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a recognition of the inability of the municipal government to deal 
with the impacts of our growth on its own," Stephanie Hauk, the assistant 
chancellor for university advancement, explained. 
</P>
<P>
Both history and modern-day realities have combined to make the dispute between 
Evanston and Northwestern more bitter than most. Northwestern, founded in 1851 
by Methodist ministers, actually predates the city, which grew up around it on 
the Lake Michigan shoreline, just north of the Chicago city limits. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of Northwestern's 3,100 faculty members live in Evanston, but, over 
the years, the city has largely evolved into a well-to-do bedroom community 
where most residents have no ties to the school. 
</P>
<P>
Few if any schools pay real estate taxes on land used for educational purposes. 
But the original charter granted to Northwestern by the Illinois Legislature 
gives the school an extraordinary exemption from taxes even on property it owns 
and leases out for investment purposes. Over the last two decades, the school 
has sold off most of that land, but it still owns more than two acres of highly 
prized and tax-free commercial development property in the vicinity of downtown 
Evanston. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors of the tuition tax admit that the idea is an end run designed to get 
around legal prohibitions against taxing the school directly. "I'm not trying 
to ruin the university," Jack Korshak, the author of the tuition plan in the 
City Council, said. "I'm just saying everyone should pay his fair share. Our 
taxes are murder now." 
</P>
<P>
Korshak floated a similar tuition tax plan several years ago, but it was 
soundly rejected by his council colleagues. This time, however, its chances of 
passage appear greatly improved. In a recent survey by a council committee, 14 
out of the 17 members of the full council said they would be willing to at 
least consider the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Although she agreed not to try to block debate, Marjorie Collens, the chairman 
of the council's Budget Policy Committee, said that the notion of taxing 
students or education was "bad policy and bad business" for Evanston. "It holds 
us up to the entire country as being anti-education and foolish," she said.

<P>
In a dramatic space of two weeks, a crisis that began with wide condemnation of 
Israel's treatment of Palestinians ended with potentially key Israeli 
diplomatic victories and a setback for Palestinians who have been trying to 
persuade the United States to pressure Israel into peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian leaders had tried to manage to their own advantage an 
uproar ignited May 20 when a lone Israeli gunman shot and killed seven 
defenseless Palestinian workers in the town of Rishon le Zion. Israel is 
pleased with its management efforts, Palestinians are not. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Israeli officials expressed satisfaction with two moves by 
Washington. First, the Bush Administration is threatening to break off talks 
with the Palestine Liberation Organization unless the PLO expels a member 
responsible for this week's abortive raid on Israel from the sea. Second, the 
United States used its veto Thursday to block a move by some members of the 
U.N. Security Council to send a special commission of inquiry to the occupied 
West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"We can all be pleased" that the United States vetoed the resolution, said 
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens. "It's an indication of the fact that we do have 
very close relations despite the differences of opinion that surface now and 
then and, lately, quite frequently." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said they want to maintain the momentum by getting the United 
States to end once and for all efforts to involve the PLO in peace talks, even 
indirectly, by the involvement of Palestinians in exile. 
</P>
<P>
"Peace talks can only work if the PLO is dealt out of them," said Yosef Ben 
Aharon, a top adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
The Shamir government will continue to promote a plan to hold elections among 
the 1.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in order to select 
a peace delegation, Ben Aharon said. But, he added, the Israeli government 
wants progress on other points of the plan, including integration of 
Palestinian refugees abroad into Arab society and the recognition of Israel by 
hostile Arab states. 
</P>
<P>
"We want elections, but we don't want the preparations dominated by the PLO, 
which was the road that Washington was moving down," said Ben Aharon. 
</P>
<P>
In the year since Shamir proposed his election plan, no progress has been made 
toward holding them. Preliminary talks quickly stalled on Israel's reluctance 
to work out details with a Palestinian panel that would include PLO followers 
from abroad and residents of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Israel opposes giving the PLO a role on the grounds that the group is wedded to 
terrorism and because the group demands the establishment of an independent 
state alongside Israel. 
</P>
<P>
After the Rishon le Zion incident and a subsequent army crackdown in the West 
Bank and Gaza that left at least 15 more Palestinians dead, the Shamir 
government sought to contain damage to its relations with Washington. For a 
while, the tide seemed to flow against the Shamir government. President Bush 
expressed condolences not only for the families of the seven workers but also 
for other victims of army gunfire. Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
expressed interest in sending a special U.N. investigative team, but he soon 
backed off in the face of Israeli protests. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, two terrorist attacks took place that eclipsed the impact of 
Rishon le Zion and its aftermath. First, someone placed a pipe bomb in a 
crowded Israeli market, killing an Israeli passer-by. Then, the Palestine 
Liberation Front, a faction of the PLO, tried to attack the Israeli shoreline 
by speedboats brought to the coast by a mother ship that embarked from Libya. 
</P>
<P>
The raid failed; four Palestinian guerrillas were shot to death and 12 others 
were captured. Israel lost no one. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, local Palestinian leaders, stung by the U.S. veto at the United 
Nations, announced they were suspending contact with American officials here. 
They sent a plea to Arab governments to put economic pressure on Washington in 
support of their cause. 
</P>
<P>
"What the United States did yesterday in the Security Council was to stab all 
those people who believe in peace," said Radwan abu Ayash, a leading contact 
for the PLO in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
And in Baghdad, Iraq, where PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat met Friday with 
ambassadors of the Soviet Union, China, Italy, France and Ireland and urged 
their governments to reopen U.N. discussion of the violence in the occupied 
territories, he also denounced the veto: "I only ask why the United States 
keeps protecting and covering the crimes Israel is committing against the 
Palestinian people. Why does the United States champion human rights everywhere 
but stop doing that when Palestinian human rights are concerned?" 
</P>
<P>
Abu Ayash and several other public leaders of the Arab uprising against Israel 
concluded a 13-day hunger strike in protest of the Rishon le Zion killings. The 
Palestinians were urging the United Nations to send in an observer team to 
protect Arabs in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
The hunger strikers felt themselves under pressure because their stand in favor 
of diplomacy and of limiting violence in the uprising appeared to be leading 
nowhere. Since the uprising began in December, 1987, more than 650 Palestinians 
have died by Israeli gunfire. Palestinians have killed about 220 other Arabs on 
suspicion of collaborating with Israel. Forty-four Israelis have died at the 
hands of Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Young grass-roots activists have been preaching greater militancy, including 
the use of firearms. Washington's most recent moves appeared to leave the 
public leaders high and dry, and they reacted with uncustomary anti-American 
rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
The hunger strikers rejected suggestions that the abortive seaborne raid 
against Israel on Wednesday by a faction of the Palestine Liberation Front had 
sunk their effort in the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States has a history of supporting Israel no matter what," said 
Hannan Ashawri, a faculty member at Birzeit University, which, like all 
colleges in the occupied areas, has been closed during the 29-month uprising. 
</P>
<P>
The cut-off of relations with the United States and the appeal to the Arab 
world represents a sea change in the focus of local diplomatic efforts. By 
limiting Palestinian protest mainly to throwing stones, the leadership had 
hoped to directly appeal to both American and Israeli public opinion for 
diplomatic progress. 
</P>
<P>
While the Palestinians view their own prospects to influence the United States 
as dim, it is not clear what response they will get from Arab leaders. At the 
recent Arab summit, backing for the Palestinians was limited mostly to 
anti-Israeli rhetoric. Most Arab countries reject the side-by side, two-state 
solution proposed by the local Palestinian leaders and endorsed by the PLO.

WON'T SEEK '91 REELECTION, LIBERIA PRESIDENT DOE SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
President Samuel K. Doe, under siege from anti-government rebels, said Friday 
that he will not run for reelection in 1991 and appealed to the United States 
to help end Liberia's six-month rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish to announce here today my firm decision not to stand for the 1991 
general elections," he told a news conference in Monrovia, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Doe, who on Thursday refused to resign and vowed to be the last person to leave 
the city, said Friday that initiatives are under way with former President 
Jimmy Carter and the United Nations to restore peace in Liberia and help 
organize elections. 
</P>
<P>
But he virtually ruled out any hope that rebel leader Charles McArthur Taylor, 
could be a candidate for the elections, saying he faces criminal charges in 
Liberia. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has sent a task force of Marines from the Mediterranean to 
Liberia to protect Americans fleeing the West African country, which was 
founded in 1847 by freed American slaves. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,100 private U.S. citizens in Liberia and another 102 
government personnel and dependents, the State Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Doe said that the October, 1991, elections would be open to the country's 
established political parties but that he could not sanction the participation 
of anyone like Taylor, who is sought in Liberia on criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
The government charges that Taylor, a 42-year-old, U.S.-educated businessman, 
embezzled nearly $1 million from the government while he was head of Liberia's 
central purchasing agency in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a leader, not a destroyer," said Doe, 40, who seized power in a 1980 
coup. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department on Thursday urged all Americans to leave Liberia, and four 
Navy ships with more than 2,000 Marines were sent to waters off the coast to 
evacuate them if necessary. The Pentagon had initially said six ships were sent 
but revised the figure Friday, adding the vessels would "arrive shortly." 
</P>
<P>
Doe approved of the decision to send the task force. "We are friends of the 
United States and all your fears must be allayed," he said Friday. "That 
government will do nothing to harm the people of this country." 
</P>
<P>
Doe's forces have been steadily retreating before the onslaughts of Taylor's 
National Patriotic Front of Liberia, which now controls well over half the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The six-month rebel incursion has in many respects become a tribal conflict, 
with Doe's army, dominated by the Krahn tribe, battling Gios and Manos, who are 
the basis of Taylor's support. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a British warship and a support tanker are ready to help rescue 
foreign nationals from Liberia, the Defense Ministry said in London. 
</P>
<P>
A British spokesman said: "The frigate Andromeda and the fleet auxiliary tanker 
Tidespring are in the region and would be available to support any United 
States evacuation if required." 
</P>
<P>
British officials said they believe Doe's wife and children arrived in Britain 
about two weeks ago.

AMID CHILDREN'S FESTIVAL, CHINA PRAISES '89 CRACKDOWN

Chinese authorities Friday praised last year's military crackdown on the 
democracy movement and told thousands of schoolchildren that they owe their 
right to assemble in Tian An Men Square to the valor of the army. 
</P>
<P>
The comments came during International Children's Day celebrations held in 
Beijing's Tian An Men Square, the heart of massive student-led democracy 
protests crushed by the army last June 3-4. 
</P>
<P>
As the anniversary of the crackdown approached, the northern half of the 
square, including the Monument to the People's Heroes, was cordoned off Friday 
for organized children's activities. 
</P>
<P>
The sensitive area was to remain closed to the public "these few days" except 
to those with special passes, according to one of the scores of paramilitary 
guards standing guard at the entrances to the square. 
</P>
<P>
"A year ago today, Tian An Men Square was covered by black clouds," said 
Beijing Communist Youth League leader Qiang Wei in an apparent reference to 
huge demonstrations and a three-week student occupation of the square last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
Qiang was addressing several thousand Chinese children standing in formation on 
the square. 
</P>
<P>
"A few who wanted to convert China to capitalism carried out activities here 
and deprived you of your right to celebrate your festival," he said in a speech 
broadcast on state television. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the brave People's Liberation Army who . . . quelled the turmoil and 
counterrevolutionary rebellion and took back the square. This makes it possible 
to celebrate here," Qiang said. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of police patrolled the square Friday. Foreign journalists were 
subjected to tight security checks because of the appearance of China's top two 
officials, Premier Li Peng and Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin. 
</P>
<P>
Around the Monument to the People's Heroes in the center of the square, 
balloons carried streamers reading, "Long live the great Communist Party" and 
"Long live our great socialist motherland." 
</P>
<P>
The nightly news broadcast featured children singing, dancing, and 
goose-stepping in formation in organized activities in Beijing and other cities 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents of Beijing, where resentment of the hard-line government runs 
deep, derided the lavish celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"It's disgusting. People aren't that stupid," an intellectual said of the 
strategically timed activities. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's Children's Day celebrations in Beijing were carried out on a 
subdued scale, overshadowed by the democracy movement that began on college 
campuses and spread nationwide.

SOUTH AFRICA TAKES NEW STEP TO END SEGREGATION

The white minority government took a step toward changing its policy of 
apartheid by introducing legislation Friday to end the racial segregation of 
public amenities such as parks, libraries and bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The Separate Amenities Act, passed in 1953, had granted provincial governments, 
municipalities and privately owned entertainment establishments the right to 
reserve facilities for whites. 
</P>
<P>
A bill that would repeal the act was published Friday and is expected to be 
passed in mid-June, the South African Press Assn. reported. It was the latest 
move by the government of President Frederik W. de Klerk to dismantle 
apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
The Conservative Party, the largest white opposition party, is the only 
parliamentary group expected to oppose the bill, but the party does not have 
enough votes to block it. Hernus Kriel, minister of provincial affairs and 
planning, has called for the changes, if approved, to take effect Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would remove local governments' authority to racially segregate public 
facilities such as libraries, toilets, parks and buses. It also would remove 
the legal protection of individuals who want to reserve restaurants, hotels, 
resorts and other public facilities for whites. 
</P>
<P>
In most major cities, such as Johannesburg and Cape Town, public amenities have 
been desegregated in recent months. But in hundreds of smaller cities, towns 
and villages, there are either no public facilities for blacks in the city 
centers, or there are inferior, separate amenities. 
</P>
<P>
The Separate Amenities Act is considered one of the pillars of apartheid, the 
system of racial separation and white domination encoded in law by the National 
Party when it came to power in 1948.

TREATY: THE AGREEMENTS MARK THE BEGINNING OF THE CRITICAL TASK OF DISMANTLING 
'OVER-ARMAMENT' THAT ACCUMULATED DURING FOUR DECADES OF CONFRONTATION.

Critics of arms control have long complained that "when it's important, it's 
not do-able, and when it's do-able, it's not important." But President Bush and 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev took a significant step Friday toward 
proving the critics wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The agreements that they signed on strategic nuclear weapons, chemical weapons 
and nuclear testing, along with a joint statement advancing prospects for 
conventional force cuts in Europe, mark the beginning of the critical task of 
dismantling the "over-armament" of both nuclear and conventional weapons that 
accumulated during four decades of confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
"The START treaty will signal a turning point in U.S.-Soviet arms control 
efforts toward a more rational, open, cooperative, predictable and stable 
relationship," the two leaders said in a statement accompanying the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bush: "The world has waited long enough. The Cold War must end." 
</P>
<P>
The START pact, in particular, will cut in half the number of missile warheads, 
the most dangerous weapons on both sides, and the reductions will be verified 
by 13 different types of on-site inspection. Also, it switches the weight of 
the arsenals from fast-flying ballistic warheads to slow-flying cruise missile 
warheads. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is going to start a war by using cruise missiles," said former arms 
negotiator Paul C. Warnke. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, START could significantly increase political stability between the 
two countries, according to Harvard Prof. Joseph S. Nye, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic objective of arms control," he said, "has been to promote stability, 
with reduced risk of conflict and some money saving. START, as it emerges, does 
advance those goals and thus sets the stage for the next steps in the process, 
including deeper cuts in nuclear weapons." 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe this disarmament process is a victim of its own success," said Soviet 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, tacitly acknowledging the 
grumbling of critics over Friday's arms agreements. "We used to talk a lot 
about disarmament, and now when we have disarmament we talk less. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't mean that it has less significance," Gerasimov added, referring to 
the anticipated START pact. "It's extremely significant. It also gives you and 
us a peace dividend." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly critics can argue that there is room for improvement in the accords: 
The cuts could have been deeper, negotiations less protracted. But they set the 
stage, militarily and politically, for the next steps in slowing down the arms 
race. 
</P>
<P>
The START agreement will cut offensive nuclear arsenals by one-third overall, 
not by the flat 50% once promised. And it will take seven years to get the 
weapon stockpiles back to roughly their size when the strategic arms reduction 
talks began in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
But even some who are disappointed at the "modest" size of the cuts, like 
Warnke, a former arms negotiator, see the treaty as a "useful" step. 
</P>
<P>
The anticipated treaty to cut conventional forces in Europe (CFE) has generally 
drawn less criticism. The Warsaw Pact countries would cut four times more 
weapons from their arsenals than the North Atlantic Treaty Organization: 15% to 
60% of various weapon categories, compared to 7% to 15% for NATO. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of taking eight years to negotiate, CFE promises to be finished in only 
two. But here, too, critics complain that history has moved faster than arms 
control and that the weapon and troop ceilings set by the agreement could 
become the floors that the Soviets will insist upon retaining in East Europe in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
Barring some drastic reversal of the present flow of events, however, there 
seems little realistic prospect that any significant Soviet presence will 
remain in the former Soviet Bloc countries by the end of the treaty's 
seven-year reduction period. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary and Czechoslovakia will be rid of the Soviets by mid-1991. Poland may 
or may not allow small contingents of Soviet logistic troops to stay to service 
Soviet forces in East Germany. But with German unification imminent, Soviet 
troops can only be marking time on East German territory before they depart. 
</P>
<P>
The CFE treaty, further, will require the destruction of massive amounts of 
weapons -- over 100,000 tanks, artillery and aircraft by the Warsaw Pact. 
Reconstituting them in order to go to war would be very costly and 
time-consuming, and probably could not be done without alerting the West. 
</P>
<P>
So the CFE accord should largely blow away the specter of a big conventional 
war in Europe for decades. As such, it will have more immediate impact on the 
Continent than will the START pact. 
</P>
<P>
But the superpowers will still be overstocked with nuclear weapons whose use, 
while far less likely, can obliterate the world. Hence new negotiations, to 
quickly follow completion of the START treaty, will seek "to enhance stability 
and reduce the risk of war," Bush said at Friday's White House signing 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Arms control experts have a more specific list than that already prepared. 
</P>
<P>
A primary goal should be to reduce the weapon totals further, to 3,000 or 4,000 
weapons, according to Harvard's Nye. The START treaty now anticipated will 
permit 6,000 "accountable" weapons, but it will actually permit 9,000 or 
slightly more because of liberal counting rules for cruise missiles. The next 
treaty should set a limit that will have no loopholes, Nye said. 
</P>
<P>
The new talks are certain to seek strict limits on the number of land-based 
intercontinental missiles with multiple warheads. Both U.S. and Soviet 
officials agree that such missiles are destabilizing: They are the best weapons 
to launch a surprise attack, and also the most attractive targets in a surprise 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Another goal will be further cuts in the very large Soviet ICBM missiles, the 
SS-18s, whose power and accuracy are the most threatening to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Curbs on nuclear weapons in naval forces will be a topic pushed by the Soviets 
in future talks, because they fear that nuclear weapons on U.S. submarines and 
ships can circumvent the START treaty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COUNTING NUCLEAR WARHEADS 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the START agreement under negotiation is to reduce the nuclear 
arsenal of each superpower below 6,000 warheads. Below are current and 
anticipated levels by 1998, including intercontinental ballistic missiles 
(ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and nuclear devices 
carried on bombers.

<P>
The negotiations with the United States on reducing the two superpowers' 
strategic arsenals have been difficult, but Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev will face an equally tough task selling that agreement at home. 
</P>
<P>
Already, his countrymen are asking why the Soviet Union will give up more 
weapons than the United States, why the United States will have more nuclear 
warheads than the Soviet Union, and why Moscow dropped its demand that 
sea-launched cruise missiles be fully covered by the prospective treaty. 
</P>
<P>
The questions are coming not only from Gorbachev's critics on the right, but 
also from some of his supporters. And it appears likely that the agreement 
signed Friday by Gorbachev and President Bush will provoke the Soviet Union's 
first full-scale foreign policy debate. 
</P>
<P>
"The gap in the numbers makes one stop and think," Alexander Bovin, a political 
commentator for the government newspaper Izvestia, said before the two leaders 
approved the agreement, which sets out basic principles for a treaty reducing 
strategic arms. "Why are we agreeing to have considerably fewer warheads in our 
strategic offensive arsenal than the Americans?" 
</P>
<P>
Marshal Dmitri T. Yazov, the Soviet defense minister, complained in print last 
month that the country's negotiating style seems tilted more toward making 
concessions than toward winning compromises from the other side. The collapse 
of the Warsaw Pact, he warned, made it too risky to yield much on strategic 
arms without offsetting reductions by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
And Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, Gorbachev's own military adviser, a 
consultant on the strategic arms negotiations and a member of the Soviet 
delegation to the summit talks here, argued publicly in advance of Gorbachev's 
trip that the country needs a modernized, more powerful army and must be wary 
about reducing its defense capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"The danger of war has not been eliminated for the Soviet Union -- I am 
convinced of this and I speak of it frankly," Akhromeyev wrote in a lengthy 
attack on another Gorbachev adviser, Georgy A. Arbatov, director of the U.S.A. 
and Canada Institute in Moscow. "The United States continues to act largely as 
before in the military sphere. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
With such questions being raised by his own supporters, Gorbachev will find it 
difficult to justify making any concessions that are not matched by U.S. 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
"If the United States wants an agreement, and I know it does, then the American 
negotiators will have to take into account our public opinion," Vitaly I. 
Goldansky, a leading Soviet scientist and an adviser to Gorbachev on arms 
control, said of the prospective treaty. "We are used to tailoring agreements 
to meet American political needs, but now you must take our needs into 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really new. In the past, the leader made a deal, and that was it. Now 
we have a real diversity in opinion, we have open criticism of the leadership 
and its policies and, yes, we have a political opposition that is emerging. 
Neither foreign policy nor defense will be exempt from political debate," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's conservative critics have recently focused on foreign policy as an 
area of vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
One foreign policy specialist, writing in the weekly newspaper Literaturnaya 
Rossiya in April, said that all of Gorbachev's international achievements had 
come by yielding the gains made by the Soviet Union over the past 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Yegor K. Ligachev, the foremost conservative within the Communist Party 
leadership, has publicly questioned Soviet policy in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"People speak with great alarm about what is happening in Eastern Europe," 
Ligachev said in a television interview two weeks ago. "In particular, many 
people say they are very disturbed that there is a dismantling of socialism in 
some of those countries." 
</P>
<P>
And the growing public feud between Akhromeyev and Arbatov has brought into the 
open the deep cleavage among Gorbachev's own advisers over substituting 
political agreements for military readiness and over his concept of "defense 
sufficiency" -- that is, ensuring the country's defense against any conceivable 
threat but without seeking to compete weapon for weapon with the United States 
in a ruinous arms race. 
</P>
<P>
"The debate that we will have over the START treaty will range over all our 
foreign policy initiatives under Gorbachev," a member of the Soviet delegation 
commented. "But it is impossible to predict the outcome. This is the first such 
fundamental debate we will have had, and our legislators are distinguishing 
themselves by their independence." 
</P>
<P>
Under Soviet law, treaties must be ratified by the Supreme Soviet, the 
country's legislature, but the process will no longer be the mere formality 
that it was two years ago when the treaty eliminating intermediate-range 
nuclear forces was reviewed and approved in an afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The three parliamentary committees that will review arms control agreements are 
filled with foreign policy specialists, generals, managers of the country's 
defense industries and others certain to probe for any weaknesses. Elected in 
the nation's first contested parliamentary elections last year, they have 
already shown their independence from the government and Communist Party and 
openly questioned some of Gorbachev's policies. 
</P>
<P>
Talking with U.S. congressional leaders here Friday, Gorbachev compared the new 
role Soviet legislators were playing. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a really a mirror image (of Washington) now," he said. "We have come 
here, and before coming here, we had contacts with our Supreme Soviet members, 
and we will have contacts with them when we return." 
</P>
<P>
But the framework agreement for the strategic arms treaty, signed by Gorbachev 
and President Bush on Friday, already has drawn criticism from both the right 
and the left in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"The progressives, the radicals are saying that the cuts are not large enough 
and certainly do not reach the 50% levels we were promised," Andrei Kortunov, 
an arms control specialist at the U.S.A. Institute now in Washington, 
commented. "We are not going to get the savings we need from the defense budget 
because we will have to rebuild our strategic triad to match that of the U.S. 
Their criticism is that we have been trapped into playing the U.S. game once 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"From the right, we hear very strong criticism that we are giving up more than 
the U.S. is, that we have not held fast on such critical points as the 
inclusion of the sea-launched cruise missile where the U.S. enjoys an 
advantage, but we have been all too ready to 'split the difference' with the 
Americans in ways that weaken us." 
</P>
<P>
The next six months of negotiations, as the final treaty is prepared and the 
basis is laid for a second agreement, will be crucial for Gorbachev, according 
to Kortunov and other Soviet foreign policy specialists. 
</P>
<P>
"Even as we celebrate this framework agreement, we must remember that a lot of 
work still needs to be done to produce a treaty that can be ratified by both 
the U.S. Senate and our Supreme Soviet," a member of the Soviet delegation 
said. "To produce a treaty that either body would refuse to ratify would be 
disastrous for the whole process of arms control and for the overall 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE SUMMIT 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of arms control agreements would help Gorbachev with his domestic 
problems? Can they be sold to the Soviet military and other Soviet 
conservatives? 
</P>
<P>
There is a big limit to the help he can get from arms control agreements. What 
the Soviet people are focusing on politically is the internal problems. And the 
climate has become less favorable for selling arms control to the military. 
</P>
<P>
For both the political and military leadership in the Soviet Union, the changes 
in Eastern Europe have led to a desire to put things on hold. What would be 
most important to Gorbachev would be for the United States and the West to cut 
back their forces unilaterally. That would demonstrate to his rivals that 
Gorbachev's policies are being reciprocated. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest thing Gorbachev has going for him at home is that he is an 
internationally recognized leader. He is seen as dealing on equal terms with 
the President of the United States, and that was not true of his predecessors. 
Beyond that, it's not clear that the average Soviet citizen -- the person 
standing in line waiting to buy bread -- is likely to pay much attention to the 
specifics of an arms control agreement. 
</P>
<P>
But there are certain things it would be imprudent for him to do at this stage. 
The military would not have supported the (U.S.-backed) proposal to exclude 
medium-range cruise missiles from the agreement. And it would be hard for him 
to sell the military on any deal preventing modernization of the remaining 
SS-18s (ballistic missiles). If the United States persists in such a course, 
that might be very imprudent.

NEGOTIATIONS: MALTA SESSIONS WERE CUT SHORT BY STORMS. CAMP DAVID 'REALLY IS 
THE KEY TO THIS THING,' AN EXPERT SAYS.

<P>
When last December's Malta summit ended, both President Bush and Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev complained that their talks had been cut too 
short by the storms that had nearly drowned the island. 
</P>
<P>
Hours of meeting time had had to be scrubbed from what Bush had foreseen as an 
informal, "feet up," summit. 
</P>
<P>
This time, both presidents say, things will be different. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that the President of the United States and I will have 
enough time to reflect on and discuss . . . one on one, all questions either of 
us might have," Gorbachev said when he arrived in Washington on Wednesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's top aides, and the President, himself, echo the same line. More 
important even than signing summit agreements, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman 
Colin L. Powell said Thursday, "The objective is to get the two leaders to talk 
to each other. The real key is just to have these two very important men talk." 
</P>
<P>
If so, the most important phase of the summit begins this morning in the rustic 
setting of Camp David, the presidential retreat in the low mountains of western 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't try to tote up the success" of the summit until today's meetings 
conclude, Condoleeza Rice, the National Security Council's top Soviet expert, 
said. "Camp David really is the key to this thing." 
</P>
<P>
The lengthy, informal sessions planned for today, as much as 9 1/3 hours of 
unstructured time, will be without recent precedent. 
</P>
<P>
During the eight years of the Reagan Administration, U.S. officials who felt 
President Reagan had little knowledge of foreign affairs steered him away from 
holding informal sessions with foreign leaders. Before that, for several years, 
Soviet bureaucrats carefully scripted all meetings of the aged Leonid I. 
Brezhnev. 
</P>
<P>
So for the first time in well over a decade, both superpowers are led by 
presidents with the knowledge and self-confidence to use an informal session to 
make a deal. 
</P>
<P>
The chief subject on the agenda, U.S. officials say, will be the interrelated 
topics that have dominated the last two days of talks -- the future framework 
for European security, the changing role of the NOrth Atlantic Treaty 
Organization and the future of a reunited Germany -- what Bush calls the "shape 
of a post-German-unification Europe." 
</P>
<P>
While the two presidents have discussed those issues extensively already, White 
House aides hope that on this last day of discussions, in a more relaxed 
setting, the two may be able to make more progress. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who has made extensive use of Camp David as a setting to host foreign 
leaders whom he hopes to turn into friends, also has tried to develop a closer 
personal relationship with Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
While Bush is a strong believer in the value of personal relationships with 
foreign leaders, foreign policy experts long have warned that even with leaders 
as well versed in the nuances as Bush and Gorbachev, personal diplomacy has 
pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
The outstanding example of those dangers was the 1986 Reagan-Gorbachev summit 
in Reykjavik, Iceland, during which Gorbachev almost got Reagan to agree on a 
plan calling for total elimination of nuclear weapons on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the deal fell apart because Reagan insisted on retaining his 
Strategic Defense Initiative space-based anti-missile program, known as "Star 
Wars," that Gorbachev wanted to limit to a research plan. But when the 
almost-deal became public, NATO defense planners were horrified. The essential 
defense strategy of the United States and its allies has been to rely on 
nuclear weapons to offset the huge numerical advantages of the Soviet army in 
Europe.

BALTIC FREEDOM RALLY PUTS PRESSURE ON BUSH;

PROTEST: THOUSANDS GATHER ON CAPITOL STEPS AS 2 U.S. LAWMAKERS DEMAND A TOUGHER

Chanting "Freedom now!" and waving yellow, green and red Lithuanian flags, 
thousands of ethnic Americans rallied Friday on the front steps of the Capitol 
against Mikhail S. Gorbachev's crackdown on the secessionist Baltic states. 
</P>
<P>
Bused in from as far away as California, protesters roared with approval as 
Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) and Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) 
called on President Bush to put pressure on the Soviet president to recognize 
Lithuanian independence and let democracy prevail in neighboring Estonia and 
Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a message for you," said D'Amato, surrounded at the podium by cheering 
protesters, the Capitol dome behind him. "Lyetuva bus laisva -- Lithuania will 
be free!" 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Gorbachev, we are upset," D'Amato said. "Although you may have been 
schooled in the art of Western politics and public relations, you must 
understand that freedom is something that can never be compromised." 
</P>
<P>
Both Dornan and D'Amato were interrupted repeatedly by the crowd's synchronous 
shouts of "Freedom now!" and "Aciu!" -- the Lithuanian word for "thank you." 
</P>
<P>
The rally, the first major public outburst against Administration policy during 
the summit, was called by Lithuanian-American groups to protest Bush's gingerly 
response to Lithuania's declaration of independence. AFL-CIO President Lane 
Kirkland and former U.S. Ambassador to Poland Richard Davies also blasted 
Bush's Baltic policy. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Gorbachev, occupied with a range of highly sensitive issues from 
German reunification to arms reduction, so far have put the political future of 
the three Baltic republics on the summit back burner. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of protesters hefted signs that bore impatient, angry slogans, such as 
"Less Dialogue -- More Action" and "We Want 'Someday' to Come Today." Some took 
aim at Bush, such as "Bush Makes No Deals With Terrorists . . . Unless They're 
Russian." 
</P>
<P>
Many signs were directed at the perceived cozy relationship between the 
conferring presidents: "Gorby and Bush: Tiny Lithuania Is Bigger Than Both of 
You," "Gorby Runs the White House." In one titled "Wake Up, George," a 
pajama-clad Bush was depicted lying beside the Soviet president in a yellow, 
green and red bed. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan, who emphasized that he is "a Bush man," nonetheless offered the 
President a suggestion: 
</P>
<P>
"All he (Bush) has got to do is tell Mr. Gorbachev, 'I must stand with the 
Baltic nations, because their embassies have been recognized in our country 
since the early 1920s. We will not turn our back on our friends.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Republican's message fired up the crowd. Many present were 
first-generation immigrants or descendants of Lithuanians who fled their 
homeland, either during World War II or after the Soviets annexed the Baltics 
in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want this summit to be a one-sided public relations maneuver by 
Gorbachev, that everything's rosy, peachy keen," said Marijus Gudinskas, 36, 
who had driven more than 10 hours from his hometown of Hamilton, Canada, with 
his Lithuanian wife and two sons. 
</P>
<P>
Like many present, Gudinskas was not sure whether Bush or Gorbachev would be 
swayed by the protest, but emphasized his determination. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't let the world forget. That's our job," he said, holding his 
2-year-old son, Vincas, in his arms. "I still have hot water. I still have food 
on my table. I still have medical supplies and oil. They (in Lithuania) don't. 
It's my responsibility as a Lithuanian, the least that I can do, to protest the 
Soviets' oppression." 
</P>
<P>
Said Mary Vizgirda, secretary of the Lithuanian-American chapter in Aurora, 
Ill., who at age 7 fled Lithuania with her family: "I must protest the 
Lithuanian occupation. Otherwise, I could never look in the eyes of Lithuanians 
in Lithuania again."

DRUG PROGRAM CURBS COCAINE USE, STUDY SAYS

A five-year government study has shown for the first time that a comprehensive 
anti-drug program can significantly reduce cocaine use among teen-agers, 
researchers announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary analysis of eight schools in the study found that 1.6% of the 
program students used cocaine in the last month, contrasted with 3.7% of those 
not in the program. 
</P>
<P>
If the same percentage difference on cocaine use were applied nationally, it 
would mean 500,000 fewer teen-agers were using cocaine, said Charles Schuster, 
director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to emphasize that this is the first time we have data on the 
impact of prevention programs in reducing the use of cocaine, including crack 
cocaine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the University of Southern California began tracking 5,500 
teen-agers when they were in the sixth and seventh grades in 50 Kansas City 
schools and studied a similar group at 57 schools in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
The effort apparently also produced significant reductions in teen-agers' use 
of cigarettes, alcohol and marijuana -- so-called gateway drugs, Schuster said. 
</P>
<P>
Those reductions included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 24.1% of the participating students, now high school juniors and seniors, 
smoked cigarettes in the last month, contrasted with 32% of those who did not 
receive the program's prevention messages. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 36% of the students who participated in the program said they drank alcohol 
in the last month, and 50.1% of those not in the program admitted the same 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 14.2% of the program students smoked marijuana in the last month, 
contrasted with 20.2% of those in a control group.

TWISTER CHURNS ALONG HIGHWAY IN TEXAS; 2 MOTORISTS ARE KILLED

<TEXT>
<P>
A tornado churned across a Texas highway Friday night, causing accidents that 
killed at least two people and damaging nearby homes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
At least 19 people were reported injured when the twister struck along Farm 
Road 305 outside the West Texas town of Iraan, said state Department of Public 
Safety spokesman Mike Cox. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently it struck cars on the highway as well as ranch houses and possibly 
some oil field-related structures in the area," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
Two people were killed in car accidents caused by the twister, he said. There 
were five car accidents on 305 and four accidents on another highway, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The injured included two state troopers cut by flying glass when hail and high 
winds accompanying the tornado blew out the windows of their patrol car on the 
road 230 miles northwest of San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere Friday, residents of the Texas Panhandle town of Spearman cleared 
wreckage left in the wake of a swarm of funnel clouds Thursday, and citizens in 
waterlogged Vicksburg, Miss., swept out mud left by record flash flooding. 
</P>
<P>
Damage in Spearman was estimated at $5.5 million. Estimates were still being 
collected in Vicksburg. About 200 Vicksburg residents were forced to higher 
ground Thursday when thunderstorms dumped as much as seven inches of rain, 
overflowing creeks and drainage ditches. 
</P>
<P>
Water damage was reported to 187 homes and at least two businesses. Some 
bridges and roadways in Warren County, on the Mississippi River, also were 
damaged, said Civil Defense Chief Luther Warnock Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"We've even had fire trucks out using their hoses to help wash the mud and 
debris out of houses before it dries," Warnock said. "I've been here for 30 
years and . . . this was the worst flooding anyone can remember." 
</P>
<P>
In Spearman, 10 mobile homes and 10 houses were reported destroyed. A church 
also was reported demolished. Some of the mobile homes were "smoothed off to 
the ground," said Mayor Burl Buchanan.

A federal appeals court issued a stay late Thursday just 90 minutes before the 
scheduled execution of a condemned killer who had wanted no further appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Baal, 26, had been scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection at 
12:05 a.m. Friday for stabbing a bus driver to death in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled 2-1 that the execution should 
be stayed until noon today to get more information from U.S. District Judge 
Howard McKibben, who earlier ruled against a stay. Justice Alex Kozinski 
dissented. 
</P>
<P>
Baal's parents had petitioned McKibben for the stay, citing their son's 
long-term mental problems and possible brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Harry Pregerson questioned whether Baal's competence hearing had 
properly focused on whether he could make a rational decision to give up his 
appeal rights if he was suffering from a brain disorder, disease or defect. 
</P>
<P>
Baal was sentenced to die for stabbing bus driver Frances Maves to death in 
1988 as she resisted his robbery attempt. His execution would be Nevada's fifth 
and the 129th nationally since the 1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing 
states to resume use of the death penalty.

SPACE: UNMANNED MISSION WILL USE TELESCOPE TO SEARCH THE HEAVENS FOR SOURCES OF 
X-RAYS. IT WILL ALSO STUDY HOT STARS, BLACK HOLES AND SUPERNOVAS.

<TEXT>
<P>
With the hobbled space shuttle Columbia standing silent 10 miles away, NASA 
launched an unmanned rocket Friday with an observatory that will search the 
heavens for sources of X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
The Delta rocket blasted into a partly cloudy sky at 5:47 p.m. from Cape 
Canaveral Air Force Station. The $273-million West German observatory, called 
Rosat, was to be boosted later into an orbit 360 miles high. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the finest X-ray telescope that's ever been flown," NASA program 
scientist Alan N. Bunner said. "As our instruments improve, it always opens the 
door to discoveries." 
</P>
<P>
The launching was delayed about 12 minutes so a commercial airliner could move 
out of the launching danger area. 
</P>
<P>
There had been some concern early in the afternoon about possible thunderstorms 
and lightning, but the weather improved and conditions were perfect at launch 
time. There are fewer weather constraints for unmanned rockets than for the 
shuttle, which carries astronauts and consequently needs clear skies at landing 
sites in case of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Rosat originally was to have flown on a shuttle in 1987 but was redesigned to 
fit into the Delta after the 1986 Challenger explosion meant waiting until the 
mid-1990s for a shuttle ride. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 sources of cosmic X-rays are known to exist. Astronomers hope 
100,000 sources will be identified by Rosat as it orbits high above Earth's 
atmosphere, which blocks X-rays and makes them invisible from the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be the fodder that scientists will use for years to come to identify 
targets for future study," Bunner said at a news briefing. 
</P>
<P>
The satellite consists of a powerful X-ray telescope and a wide-field camera 
capable of detecting extreme ultraviolet light. 
</P>
<P>
After two months of instrument calibration, Rosat will begin a six-month survey 
of celestial bodies that emit X-rays. It will be the first full-sky survey by 
an imaging X-ray telescope. 
</P>
<P>
After the survey, the observatory will spend the next year or more making 
detailed observations of extremely hot stars, black holes and remnants of 
supernovas, hot clouds produced by exploding stars at the end of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Information will be transmitted to a ground station near Munich, West Germany, 
and then sent for analysis to centers in that country, the United States and 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Rosat is short for Roentgen Satellite, named after German scientist Wilhelm 
Conrad Roentgen, who discovered X-rays in 1895. 
</P>
<P>
Rosat is 100 times more sensitive than the best X-ray observatory to date, the 
so-called Einstein Observatory, which was placed in orbit in 1978, Bunner said. 
And it will complement the work of the X-ray telescope that is part of the 
Astro observatory waiting to be launched from Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
The Astro mission has been delayed until mid-June, possibly longer. Columbia's 
launching on Wednesday was scrubbed because of a fuel leak. NASA workers Friday 
failed again to locate the leak. 
</P>
<P>
If the leak cannot be located and repaired on the pad, Columbia will be 
returned to the hangar.

DEUKMEJIAN OPPOSES MEASURE ON RAIL BONDS 
</P>

Parting company with his own transportation commission, Gov. George Deukmejian 
on Friday became the first top state official to publicly oppose Proposition 
116, a ballot measure that authorizes $3 billion in bonds for rail 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, who is heading a campaign to pass a similar measure that authorizes 
$1 billion in bonds for mass transit, said he will vote against Proposition 116 
because of a personal conviction that bond measures generally should be placed 
on the ballot by the governor and the Legislature, not by initiative. 
</P>
<P>
He said his rail proposal, Proposition 108, is part of a "comprehensive, 
statewide transportation program" developed in concert with lawmakers. 
Proposition 108 is tied to Proposition 111, which modifies the state's spending 
limit and allows a phased-in 9-cent-per-gallon increase in the state gasoline 
tax to go into effect. 
</P>
<P>
Both proposals would help finance a 10-year, $18.5-billion transportation 
program that provides for highway construction, reinforcing of roads and 
bridges for earthquake safety and expansion of mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's announcement surprised backers of Proposition 116, who only a 
week ago announced their strong support for Propositions 111 and 108. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had an understanding that we were supportive of them and they 
were supportive of us," said Gerald Meral, executive director of the Planning 
and Conservative League, which led the drive to collect signatures for 116. 
"It's a very peculiar position because the California Transportation 
Commission, which (the governor) appoints, thinks we should be supported." 
</P>
<P>
The commission endorsed all three transportation proposals on the ballot, 
saying they would provide much needed funds for improving and expanding the 
state's highway and mass transit system. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he would also cast a "no" vote on Proposition 117, an 
initiative prohibiting sport hunting of mountain lions by designating them 
protected animals, because, he said, he opposed a provision that would mandate 
the spending of $900 million to acquire and restore wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican governor said he will vote for the other 15 proposals on the 
ballot, including a measure that would authorize bonds for new prisons, impose 
new ethical standards on lawmakers while raising their salaries, and set new 
limits on the rights of criminal defendants.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / INSURANCE COMMISSIONER; 
</P>
<P>
UNKNOWNS ARE OFTEN MORE SPECIFIC ON ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Relatively unknown candidates have often been more precise on the issues in the 
race for insurance commissioner than the leaders who spend hundreds of 
thousands of dollars on television ads to state, without much elaboration, that 
they will enforce Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Michael Blanco, an Alhambra city councilman, has campaigned in scores 
of forums in strong, blunt language for implementation of no fault auto 
insurance. Since Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) has blocked 
this in the Legislature, Blanco has also called for Brown's ouster. 
</P>
<P>
To Republican John L. (Jack) Harden, the cause of high auto insurance prices is 
fraud. Stop fraud, he told a debate of the five Republican candidates Thursday 
on Century Cable, and he would guarantee a 50% fall in insurance prices within 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Ray Bourhis, a San Francisco trial attorney who does have some 
advertising but not as much as the leaders, has promised to prosecute consumer 
complaints and even brought specific suits during his campaign against 
insurance companies he says are violating the state's insurance code. 
</P>
<P>
But for the most part, issues in the insurance commissioner's race have 
revolved more around the general attitudes of the candidates, their sympathies 
or lack of them for the insurance companies or the trial lawyers, and the more 
amorphous issue of a candidate's character. Sometimes, the issue has simply 
been the character of their advertising. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. John Garamendi's campaign, the most heavily funded of three 
well-funded Democratic campaigns, announced Friday that it will not answer a 
negative ad by television commentator Bill Press with a negative ad of its own. 
"The senator believes there has been too much negative campaigning," spokesman 
Rob Deignan said. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi may also feel he is ahead and doesn't want to rock the boat. No 
candidate has been more reluctant to commit himself on specific issues, and his 
spokesman declined once again Friday to respond to criticisms by either 
consumer advocate Ralph Nader or opponent Conway Collis, chairman of the State 
Board of Equalization. The theme of Garamendi's single ad has been that he will 
make insurance companies "obey" Proposition 103. How, he doesn't say. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former state Common Cause Director Walter Zelman -- who earlier 
advocated a specific plan for government health insurance for all, replacing 
all private health insurance and to be financed through a payroll tax of about 
10% -- has spent most of his time of late contending that he is the candidate 
who is most independent of special interests. 
</P>
<P>
As proof of that, by the end of the week Zelman was able to cite the editorial 
endorsements of 12 of the 17 newspapers in the state to endorse in the 
Democratic primary race. Most of these, he noted, had lauded his independence. 
</P>
<P>
"But that independence from special interests has a price," Zelman said. 
"Unlike my leading opponents . . . I have no funds with which to run 30-second 
TV commercials." 
</P>
<P>
Here are summaries of positions by some candidates on key campaign issues: 
</P>
<P>
Attitude toward the insurance industry: All seven Democratic candidates say 
they are determined to stringently regulate the industry and enforce 
Proposition 103. Garamendi has been under attack for associating with industry 
positions and taking industry money in the past. He has renounced his previous 
support of no-fault insurance, backed by the industry, and refused insurer 
contributions in this campaign. Collis has taken the most militant 
anti-industry line, vowing to jail company executives and even to be "unfair" 
to the companies to get Proposition 103 implemented. Only one of the five 
Republican candidates, attorney Tom Skornia, has taken the strong anti-industry 
line adopted by the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Attitude toward the trial lawyers: Press, having taken at least $273,500 in 
contributions from trial lawyers, has been most assiduous among the Democrats 
in supporting the lawyers' positions, as has attorney John S. Parise on the 
Republican side. The rest of the candidates indicate that some of the reforms 
they would undertake to solve the insurance crisis may involve financial 
sacrifices of the lawyers as well as the insurers. Even Press has indicated 
there are circumstances where he would take on the lawyers, as a last consumer 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
Health insurance. Only Libertarian Ted Brown, who opposes government regulation 
in all cases, has been unwilling to contemplate an increased government role in 
providing or facilitating the purchase of health insurance. Some candidates, 
such as Skornia, prefer employer-financed health insurance, but all except 
Brown would use the government to provide it under certain circumstances. Press 
and Zelman have been most outspoken for universal public health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
No-fault insurance. Blanco and Republican Wes Bannister, former mayor of 
Huntington Beach and an insurance agent, have been most outspoken for it. 
Skornia has favored it as an advocate of legal reform. Zelman has embraced a 
limited form of it, and Collis says he would not absolutely rule it out. Press 
rules it out. Garamendi's abandonment of it was questioned by Nader, a foe of 
no-fault, as possibly insincere. 
</P>
<P>
State-run nonprofit auto insurance. Only Collis has advocated this, and then 
only in the event that the companies fail to implement Proposition 103. The 
rest say it is, at best, premature, or often question whether it would work.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGN

<TEXT>
<P>
The race: Insurance commissioner: Whose ads? Democratic candidates Bill Press, 
John Garamendi and Conway Collis. 
</P>
<P>
Press has a new 30-second commercial that attacks two leading opponents, 
Garamendi and Collis, as servants of special interests -- Garamendi of insurers 
and Collis of corporate donors. Garamendi has a 30-second commercial that 
pledges to make every insurance company obey Proposition 103. Collis has a 
30-second commercial that reports he scored highest on a Ralph Nader 
questionnaire of the insurance commissioner candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Elements of the ads, with an analysis by Times staff writer Kenneth Reich: 
</P>
<P>
Ad: Press' commercial declares, "As a state legislator, Garamendi took over 
$100,000 from the insurance industry. And now he's been endorsed by the 
insurance industry's lobby. As an elected official, Conway Collis took money 
from corporations and voted them millions in tax breaks. Maybe that's why the 
Democratic Party rejected them and endorsed Bill Press. . . . Bill Press. He's 
on our side." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Garamendi has taken at least $123,000 in his 16 years in the 
Legislature from insurers, a little under $8,000 a year, but he has not taken 
anything from them since announcing for insurance commissioner, and he 
repudiated the endorsement of the legal reform group that Press is referring to 
here. That group, the Assn. for Tort Reform, has been accused of being a front 
for the industry but is not its major lobby. Collis, before 1986, did take 
thousands of dollars in contributions from corporations while occasionally 
voting as a State Board of Equalization member to allow them to pay less taxes 
than the board staff recommended. Since 1986, he says, he has changed his 
policy and will not vote on any matter relating to a party from which he has 
received a contribution. He acknowledges some oversights, but he maintains he 
has "learned" to be a better elected official in recent years. What Press does 
not say in these ads is that, much more than either Garamendi or Collis, he has 
raised money in the insurance commissioner's campaign from one of the major 
special interests in the insurance issue, the trial lawyers. Those 
contributions now amount to at least $273,500. Press does have the official 
endorsement of the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: Garamendi's commercial says that "Roxani Gillespie, the Republican 
insurance commissioner, exempted hundreds of companies from Prop. 103's 
requirement to lower insurance rates. We need an insurance commissioner who 
will fight for the people! Democratic Sen. John Garamendi! Sixteen years' 
experience standing up to big corporations." Garamendi then follows the 
announcer and says, "As insurance commissioner, I'll make every insurance 
company obey Proposition 103." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Gillespie indicated last summer she would exempt hundreds of 
companies from Proposition 103 rollbacks, but later reversed herself and left 
the issue open. She has not yet made a single final decision on a rate rollback 
for any company. Garamendi, as a state senator, has earned a reputation for 
standing against many special interests, although he has also voted for many 
bills desired by corporations, as virtually all legislators have. The last 
sentence is a promise Garamendi has made in his campaign. He has repeatedly 
vowed to "clean up the insurance mess," language similar to that used by most 
of the other Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: Collis' commercial starts with him reiterating that he would be the 
toughest enforcer of Proposition 103, but then an announcer declares: "We 
interrupt this message to bring you a special announcement. Ralph Nader has 
just announced the results of a consumer survey of candidates for insurance 
commissioner. In this survey, Conway Collis scored No. 1." That news is 
repeated four more times in the next few seconds, and Collis appears once more 
in the midst of the repeats saying, "I'll do whatever it takes to make 103 
work." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Collis scored highest, edging candidate Ray Bourhis, in answering a 
Nader questionnaire on policies he would follow as commissioner. But several 
other leading candidates, including Garamendi, Press, Walter Zelman and 
Republican Wes Bannister, refused to answer the questions on grounds that the 
survey was prepared to favor Collis. Nader has stopped short of endorsing 
Collis. As for making Proposition 103 "work," this may be more in the hands of 
the courts than the insurance commissioner.

REDISTRICTING MEASURES COSTLIEST ON THE BALLOT 
</P>

<P>
The battle over Propositions 118 and 119, two measures that could help shape 
the state's political power structure for the next decade, has become the 
costliest initiative fight on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the two initiatives and a single group opposing both of them had 
already spent a combined total of more than $6.2 million as of Friday, and they 
figure to collect and spend much more by the time the polls close on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition so far has outspent the supporters of the two measures by a 
margin of about 4 to 1, not counting what it cost backers of the measures to 
collect the signatures that qualified them for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Both measures would change the way political district lines are drawn every 10 
years, a process that can decide which party controls the Legislature and 
California's congressional delegation for a decade. Proposition 118 would 
require any redistricting plan to be approved by two-thirds votes in each house 
of the Legislature, signed by the governor and ratified by the voters. 
Proposition 119 would create an independent commission to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
The partisan battle lines are clear: Republicans generally are supporting the 
ballot measures, and Democrats are opposing them. But the financial backing 
behind the campaigns for and against the initiatives is not as tidy. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition campaign has been running a series of television commercials 
featuring actors James Garner, Jack Lemmon and Bea Arthur attacking the two 
initiatives as plots hatched by "big business" -- oil and insurance companies 
in particular -- to seize control of the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Those commercials are funded largely by contributions from organized labor and 
the state's trial lawyer lobby. But much of their funding also has come from 
the same special interests that the ads attack. The companies are big 
contributors to the campaigns of Democratic lawmakers who control the 
Legislature and the fate of any bills in which the businesses have an interest. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Chevron U.S.A. Inc. The corporation contributed $25,000 to help put 
Proposition 119 on the ballot and now finds itself the central target of the 
opposition's advertising campaign and its strongly worded press releases. 
</P>
<P>
The message: Chevron wants to buy itself a Republican Legislature and with it 
usher in a new era of environmental degradation. 
</P>
<P>
But the giant oil company, it turns out, has contributed even more money to the 
politicians who are fighting the initiatives. Since the beginning of 1989, 
Chevron has given more than $42,000 to Democratic members of the state Assembly 
and Senate, who have all but turned over their personal campaign treasuries to 
a joint political committee opposing Propositions 118 and 119. 
</P>

Denny Samuel, Chevron's chief lobbyist in Sacramento, said the company helped 
qualify Proposition 119 for the ballot so that state voters could "take another 
look" at the way the district lines are drawn. Although the 
Democratic-controlled Legislature and the state's congressional delegation have 
been hostile to Chevron on the off-shore oil-drilling issue, Samuel said the 
company enjoys good working relationships with members of both parties. 
</P>
<P>
"Chevron's responsibility to its stockholders is to at least be around the 
table when legislators are forming public policy," Samuel said. "Some 
legislators let you do that and some don't. The ones that do are rewarded with 
our support." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Marks, a spokesman for the Proposition 119 campaign, said it is 
"hypocritical" for the Democratic-financed opposition to attack the initiatives 
for accepting donations from the same companies that help elect the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very misleading," Marks said. "All those people (they) say are evil are 
paying for their commercials." 
</P>
<P>
Following the money trail is not always easy. The combatants have formed at 
least 11 separate political committees through which they funnel their 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
On the Democratic side, the California Medical Assn. donates $1,000 to 
Assemblyman Burt Margolin of Los Angeles. Margolin then contributes to Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown's initiative committee. Brown passes the money to the No 
on 118 and 119 Committee, which spends it to try to defeat the measures. 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans have created a similar pyramid. But their operation is not as 
organized because the campaigns supporting Proposition 118 and 119 are not 
unified, as is the opposition. There are several committees buying ads and 
mailing letters to voters on behalf of the two measures. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, a new committee called Citizens for Political Reform was 
organized to collect cash for Proposition 119 and, oddly enough, Proposition 
111. Proposition 111 has nothing to do with redistricting but would raise the 
state gasoline tax to pay for new roads and transit. 
</P>
<P>
The new group filed a notice declaring its existence but, according to the 
secretary of state's office, has yet to reveal where its money is coming from. 
The discrepancy drew a rebuke from the opponents of Proposition 119. 
</P>
<P>
"The most obvious conclusion one can draw from this scheme is that the 119 
campaign is trying to hide the names of its contributors whom the public might 
find offensive," said Karin Caves, a spokeswoman for the opposition. "Mixing 
potholes with politics won't fool voters." 
</P>
<P>
Here are major contributors to the campaigns for and against Propositions 118 
and 119. 
</P>
<P>
For 118 -- Republican National Committee, $601,000; California Republican 
Party, $50,000; Tenneco Management Co., $15,000; American Basic Foods, $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
For 119: Republican National Committee, $75,000; State Sen. Ken Maddy 
(R-Fresno), $75,000; Hewlett Packard, $75,000; Lincoln Club of Northern 
California (Republican Party), $50,000; Chevron U.S.A., $25,000; David Packard, 
$25,000; National Rifle Assn., $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
Against 118 and 119: Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) 
$2,035,000; Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti (D-Los Angeles), $1,355,000; 
Congressional Democrats, $1,630,000.

The number of children in Orange County foster care homes has been steadily 
rising during the last three years, rising 14.4% between 1987 and 1989. The 
bulk of that increase, 11%, occurred between 1987 and 1988. At the same time, 
the average age has been decreasing. Here's a profile of foster care children 
in the county during the last three years. The gender, ethnicity and type of 
home categories are reported in percentages, which, because of rounding, may 
not add up to 100%:

* Group homes are county-licensed shelters with paid staff. They are a common 
option for emotionally disturbed children who cannot function in a traditional 
family setting. Maximum age for a foster child in any type of home is 18 or 
until high school graduation.

FIVE-COUNTY COMPARISON 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's foster care situation is comparatively good when looked at next 
to its neighbors. Not only did Orange County have a smaller increase from 1988 
to 1989 in the number of children in foster care homes, but the 1989 number of 
children per thousand residents is by far the lowest among the five counties. 
Too, those county rates compare favorably to the state measures. Here's how 
Orange County, the four contiguous counties and the state compare:

<P>
Fullerton City Councilman Don Bankhead says he didn't really want to challenge 
Sheriff Brad Gates in the June election. 
</P>
<P>
But when he went to a meeting a few months ago at an Irvine hotel called by 
longtime Gates opponents in hope of finding a candidate, the former Fullerton 
police captain suddenly found himself on center stage. 
</P>
<P>
"I really came down (to the meeting) with the thought of locating someone and 
helping him," Bankhead said. No other candidate surfaced, however, and now the 
task of trying to unseat the powerful, four-term sheriff, who has political 
connections that most Orange County officeholders can only dream of, fell to 
Bankhead. 
</P>
<P>
A 31-year veteran of the Fullerton Police Department, Bankhead has a fraction 
of the campaign money that Gates has -- $33,000 to the sheriff's $126,000, 
according to the most recent statements -- and a smattering of endorsements. 
But he is counting on the negative publicity that Gates has received over the 
past several years to put him over the top. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be difficult without money," Bankhead said recently. "But the 
cheapest way is sometimes the best way. . . . Enough things have occurred over 
the past few years that people are kind of ready for a change." 
</P>
<P>
Gates has easily won reelection three times over the past 12 years. But he also 
has been repeatedly embroiled in controversy over whether he has abused his 
authority. The county has paid out at least $1.5 million to settle lawsuits 
with Gates' political and personal rivals -- some of whom are active in 
Bankhead's campaign -- who claimed that he used his department to harass them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is any need for these kinds of suits, not if you treat 
people like human beings," Bankhead said. "If he (Gates) violates someone's 
rights, why doesn't he pay, instead of the taxpayers? . . . He seems to think 
the laws are made for everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
An angry Gates said that Bankhead is singing the same old tired song he has 
heard for years and that he will have no more of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I am tired of people picking on me personally," Gates said. "We did our job 
fairly. We followed the law and addressed the facts. My department does a great 
job, and I am proud of what we do." 
</P>
<P>
Bankhead said he is supportive of most of the Sheriff's Department's programs 
and policies, although he thinks that the duties of sheriff and coroner should 
be separated, as they are in all other large California counties. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not running against the working cops on the street," Bankhead said. "I'm 
running against Brad Gates. . . . The things the sheriff does, he feels he's 
not going to be held responsible for them." 
</P>
<P>
Gates has also come under fire in recent years for mingling the business of 
sheriff with personal real estate ventures, which total more than $8 million in 
transactions since he took office in 1974. His portfolio has included shopping 
centers, custom homes, apartments and what will become the largest equestrian 
center in Orange County. Many of his business partners are among the county's 
elite, who also serve as board members of the Sheriff's Advisory Council, a 
nonprofit group that raises money for Sheriff's Department projects and 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Gates' wealth and property dealings initially were investigated in 1977 and 
1978 by the state Justice Department, the FBI and a federal grand jury. No 
criminal charges resulted. 
</P>
<P>
Gates has denied using his office for personal gain. "I am taking the high road 
in this race," he said. "The issues in this race are drugs and (overcrowded) 
jails. . . . I have the experience to solve those problems. I am not afraid to 
get involved in controversy and not afraid to step out on the drug issue." 
</P>
<P>
Gates has made attacking the drug problem the cornerstone of his 
administration, and he said that one of his priorities in a fifth term would be 
to end drug abuse and jail overcrowding, which he called "the basic core of all 
our problems." 
</P>
<P>
Gates' anti-drug efforts are recognized even among federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
Twice in the last two years, Gates invited President Bush to Orange County to 
deliver anti-drug messages, and both times the invitation was accepted. On his 
most recent visit, Bush helped kick off an anti-drug campaign for 
schoolchildren sponsored by the "Drug Use Is Life Abuse" program, which is 
funded by business, industry and individual citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Gates was also successful in getting Orange County included in a federal 
program that designates certain regions as "high-intensity drug-use areas." The 
distinction will mean that the county can share with Los Angeles County about 
$5 million in additional federal funds to combat drug use. 
</P>
<P>
And Gates says that the Regional Narcotics Task Force, a group of investigators 
from the county's police departments and under command of the Sheriff's 
Department, has been rated the most effective unit of its type in the nation by 
the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
Another achievement that Gates is proud of is the genetic crime lab that his 
department recently opened -- the first operated by a local law enforcement 
agency in California. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing his qualifications to those of his opponent, Gates noted that 
Bankhead was passed up twice for chief during his tenure at the Fullerton 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
But Bankhead said he has enough experience to run the Sheriff's Department: He 
was in charge of the Fullerton department's uniform division for two years and 
then all criminal investigations for eight years, and served as acting chief in 
the police chief's absence. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Bankhead said, Gates' long years in office have removed him from any 
sense of accountability to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always taught that if the wheel doesn't squeak, grease it, and if it 
squeaks, fix it," Bankhead said. "The Sheriff's Department has been squeaking 
for a long time."

POSTSCRIPT / JERRY HICKS: SOME WOULD CALL HER A PRISONER OF LOVE

<TEXT>
<P>
When Gail Harrington's husband, convicted murderer Willie Ray Wisely, was 
finally sent to Folsom Prison two years ago, she left behind everything -- her 
family in Newport Beach, college, her job -- to be near him. 
</P>
<P>
She got a small, one-bedroom apartment in the tiny town of Folsom on the 
American River, less than a mile from the prison, and rode her bicycle five 
days a week to spend time with him. 
</P>
<P>
She stayed the full six hours allowed. She wrote him every day. And she found a 
job as a law clerk in nearby Sacramento to support herself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough, but we knew it would be," the 28-year-old Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
It has been even tougher than they thought. Wisely has had so much trouble 
adjusting to life at Folsom that they've twice shipped him out for disciplinary 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Now 37, Wisely gained notoriety as the jailhouse lawyer who took on Sheriff 
Brad Gates over living conditions at the Orange County Jail. Wisely had been 
his own lawyer when he was tried and found guilty of the 1981 murder of his 
stepfather, Robert E. Bray, in Huntington Beach. Prosecutors had accused Wisely 
of rigging Bray's truck so the cab fell on him while he worked underneath it. 
The motive, prosecutors say: Wisely thought he would inherit Bray's money. 
</P>
<P>
Wisely may not have won his case, but he gained a reputation for his prolific 
number of legal motions, both on his own case and on jail conditions. He spent 
more than six years at the Orange County Jail while his motions were pending, 
more than any other inmate in its history until serial killer Randy Steven 
Kraft came along. 
</P>
<P>
Wisely managed to persuade a judge to let him set up his own legal shop at the 
Orange County Jail, with his own eight-man cell with an attached day room. He 
had his own television, his own computer and his own telephone. At Folsom, he 
was placed in a small, two-man cell with another inmate. 
</P>
<P>
Wisely's first offense at Folsom was listed as assault on an inmate. Harrington 
claims Wisely had made her a necklace, and an argument ensued when it was 
confiscated as contraband. At most, she believes, he only pushed a guard as he 
tried to squeeze past him when told to leave his cell. And recently, marijuana 
was found in his cell. Wisely claims it was his cellmate's. 
</P>
<P>
For the assault incident, he was sent last summer to Corcoran, a high-power 
facility (Charles Manson once lived there) that specializes in inmates who are 
problems at other facilities. Wisely spent six months there in "the shoe" -- a 
Security Housing Unit. Among inmates, it's commonly called "the hole." 
</P>
<P>
He was returned to Folsom last fall. But now he is back in Corcoran for the 
marijuana incident, and Harrington doesn't know when he will return to Folsom. 
She's left there alone. 
</P>
<P>
Wisely has been in the "hole" at Folsom and Corcoran so much, in fact, that in 
two years, he and Harrington have only managed one conjugal visit. Other 
married inmates are permitted conjugal visits at least once every two months, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
But now, living conditions and even the status of their marriage is secondary 
for Harrington. She's more concerned about his efforts to win a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington was a high school student when Wisely was convicted. But legal 
motions on his behalf, one of which led prosecutors to drop the death penalty 
jurors had given him, kept him at the Orange County Jail year after year. 
During that time, Harrington went to college and then to Western State 
University School of Law. 
</P>
<P>
She was in law school when she visited the jail to be interviewed by Wisely for 
a law clerk position the courts had granted him. She was hired. They fell in 
love. 
</P>
<P>
On Christmas Eve, 1986, she surreptitiously slipped a minister into the 
attorney/bonds section of the jail with her, where she could visit as Wisely's 
law clerk, and she and Wisely were married. 
</P>
<P>
The next year she was arrested and accused of slipping drugs to an inmate on 
Wisely's behalf. She protested that she was innocent, and prosecutors 
eventually dropped the charges after admitting they couldn't prove a case 
against her. 
</P>
<P>
Everything she has done has been for Wisely. 
</P>
<P>
And, she says, "it's not just because I love the guy. 
</P>
<P>
"If for some reason we're not able to hang on to this marriage, I know I will 
still be working on his case. Getting this man free is my goal in life. He is 
innocent. He's been in jail 10 years for something he didn't do." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors disagree. Assistant Dist. Atty. Edgar A. Freeman calls Wisely a 
"great con man" and "a dangerous sociopath." Wisely had been in prison at San 
Quentin on a drug-related conviction and was in the Los Angeles County Jail 
awaiting armed-robbery charges when arrested in his stepfather's death. He has 
admitted his role in the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not the man Harrington sees. 
</P>
<P>
"Willie is warm, intelligent and very kind," she insists. 
</P>
<P>
They sustain a marriage, Harrington says, by "not dwelling on the things we 
don't have." 
</P>
<P>
"We talk about how things will be when he gets out -- we are very positive 
about that -- and we try to make each other happy. I know how this sounds with 
Willie in prison, but he keeps me up. He doesn't let me get down about things." 
</P>
<P>
A big help to Harrington is the support she gets from her family. Her father, 
Joe Harrington, a former firefighter and oil worker who is now retired, is 
paying for Wisely's appellate lawyers. He hired Nina Wilder from a San 
Francisco firm. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told that on appeals, these folks were the best," Joe Harrington said. 
"I've watched enough television to know that Willie needs the best if he's 
going to win." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Harrington says he has a feeling that Wisely will at least win a new trial. 
But he reads that defendants win on appeal only about 7% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been to enough horse races to know that's not very good odds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And the future for his daughter Gail? To finish law school -- she is only a few 
credits shy of a degree -- and pass the bar and become a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
And continue to visit her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't regret for a minute what I've done with my life," she said. "Sometimes 
it's hell. But he's worth it."

DRILLING FOES MISS 1 PETITION DEADLINE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A group promoting an initiative to ban oil and gas drilling in central Garden 
Grove has missed one deadline for qualifying the measure for the November 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Carolyn Morris had set a May 31 deadline to allow Garden Grove GOO 
(Get Oil Out) to submit petitions to get its initiative before the voters this 
fall, but no petitions were turned in Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Two city councilmen, J. Tilman Williams and Robert F. Dinsen, along with 
businessman Bruce Broadwater, submitted a proposed initiative in late April 
that would "prohibit the drilling of oil and gas wells within 800 feet of any 
church, school or residential property." Those restrictions would effectively 
bar Chevron Oil USA from drilling on its site at Nelson and Pearl streets near 
the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Chevron sought drilling permits from the City Council but was 
turned down on a 3-2 vote. Opponents of drilling, however, claimed that an 
initiative was needed because a new City Council could reverse the earlier vote 
and grant the permits. 
</P>
<P>
According to Morris, valid signatures representing 10% of the registered voters 
in Garden Grove, or about 5,700, need to be submitted. 
</P>
<P>
"We said May 31 because of the various time frames that the (different 
agencies) can take," she said. "For instance, the county can take up to 30 days 
to certify the signatures. The City Council can take up to 30 days to study the 
initiative." 
</P>
<P>
The process could take less time, but meeting the May 31 cutoff date would have 
guaranteed a spot on the ballot. In any case, "everything must go to the county 
by Aug. 10." 
</P>
<P>
With one deadline missed, the fate of the initiative is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I don't know," Williams said. "I'll have to meet with the other two guys 
(Dinsen and Broadwater) and see what their thoughts are." JIM TORTOLANO

<P>
Residents will have a chance to sample the heritage of various nations at 
Placentia's first Festival of Cultures Street Faire today. The festival, to be 
held in the Placita Santa Fe area of Old Town Placentia, will begin at 10 a.m., 
with music by the El Dorado High School Jazz Band, and will continue until 5 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Food and craft booths operated by community businesses will operate in the 100 
and 200 blocks of Santa Fe Street. 
</P>
<P>
The Chamber of Commerce will operate a food and beer garden on Main Street 
south of Santa Fe Street. 
</P>
<P>
A portable stage will be set up at the intersection of Santa Fe and Bradford 
avenues, with a smaller stage at the intersection of Melrose Avenue and Santa 
Fe Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment will include local high school and junior high school bands, an 
Irish pipe and drum corps, American Indian dancers, a martial-arts 
demonstration and Ballet Folklorico. 
</P>
<P>
The event will be similar to Placentia's annual Heritage Days, said Jim Soto, 
director of parks and recreation. "We're hoping it will be so successful it 
will become a yearly event," Soto said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents are encouraged to wear clothing representing their ethnic heritage, 
said Pischel. A 3 p.m. contest will determine the best costume. 
</P>
<P>
Admission is free, and the Placentia trolley will provide shuttle service from 
parking areas at Kraener Park and Valencia High School. JULIE ESPY

BROWNIES' TREES ARE LOOKING FOR A HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANICA KIRKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Planting a tree in an Orange County park is usually pretty simple, especially 
if you want to do it on Arbor Day. But not always. 
</P>
<P>
Waunita Rosenbaum of Laguna Hills thought the easiest way to teach Orange 
County Brownie Troop 1288 about the environment would be to have its members 
grow trees from seedlings and plant them in a park at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of simply learning about carbon, oxygen and potting soil, the group 
from San Joaquin Elementary School learned that planting a tree in Orange 
County can get complicated. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly three months after being promised a spot in Mason Park in Irvine, the 
clump of white alders still has nowhere to lay down roots. Rosenbaum said her 
girls are crushed. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got 14 6-year-old and 7-year-old girls crying their eyes out," Rosenbaum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is simply one of miscommunication, park officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"I know of no time that we refused to allow somebody to plant a tree," said Tim 
Miller, manager of regional park operations. "That's why this is sort of 
unusual. . . . It's hard for me to imagine what went wrong here." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbaum said the area in which her trees were to be planted wasn't ready on 
Arbor Day as promised and that an alternative plan to plant a tree near a 
picnic shelter in June fell through when the shelter was promised to someone 
else for a company picnic. 
</P>
<P>
Park officials say that Rosenbaum neglected to fill out the proper forms and 
that the shelter was given away by a park employee who was unaware of her 
request. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbaum said she is worried that with the end of the school year approaching, 
and the troop about to disband, the trees will go unplanted. 
</P>
<P>
"Doesn't anyone want these trees?" she asked in exasperation. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who praised the Brownies for their project, says the county will be 
happy to take the trees. 
</P>
<P>
"If we made a mistake, if we screwed up, then we'll have to make arrangements," 
Miller said, adding that the park system's record clearly shows that trees are 
planted all the time. 
</P>
<P>
But Brownies like Katie Oliver, 7, are waiting. 
</P>
<P>
"If we keep these trees and we don't have any place to put them, they might not 
live," she said. "Trees are very important. We wouldn't want to kill trees."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCIL VOTES TO USE RECLAIMED WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Newport Beach will join a program that allows cities to buy treated sewer water 
from the county to use for parks, golf courses and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
The program will save Newport Beach about 487 million gallons of water 
annually, about 11% of the city's yearly demand, according to utilities 
director Robert Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Green Acres program, the Orange County Water District will expand one 
of its sewage treatment plants. Once the waste water has received a tertiary 
treatment, it will be piped to delivery points for use on large areas of turf 
or landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
The cities of Fountain Valley, Santa Ana and Costa Mesa are now participating 
in the reclaimed water project. Already the cities have decided on about 50 
different locations where the reclaimed water will be used. These sites include 
the Costa Mesa golf course, the Fountain Valley Recreation Center, Mile Square 
Park and a number of area nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
The water will be available to those three cities by the fall of 1991, when the 
necessary pipelines and the treatment facility are scheduled for completion, 
Fountain Valley Public Works Director Wayne Osborne said. Newport Beach will 
have access to the system near the end of 1993, deputy utilities director Jeff 
Staneart said. 
</P>
<P>
Once the city is hooked up to the Green Acres network, private companies and 
landowners -- such as country clubs -- can buy the reclaimed water from the 
city. Big Canyon Golf Course and the Newport Beach Country Club golf course 
will be the first city sites to receive the reclaimed water, Staneart said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's action by the City Council sets in motion the process of negotiations 
between Newport Beach staff members and the Orange County Water District. A 
skeleton agreement calls for a 25-year commitment to the project. The project 
will be completely funded by the water district, though the delivery of water 
to Newport Beach users will be managed by the city. LAURA MICHAELIS

PASSENGER SERVICE ON TRACK AGAIN

<P>
Ending a 43-year hiatus, passenger rail service returned to Irvine on Friday 
when the Amtrak commuter train pulled into a new station -- on time and to the 
delight of 25 traffic-weary commuters. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ecstatic," said Pacific Bell employee Ray Walters, who has been commuting 
on Amtrak from Orange County to Los Angeles for seven years and was glad to 
have a station just five minutes from his El Toro home. "It reduces stress." 
</P>
<P>
With the freeways clogged and commuters looking for an easier way to get to 
work, the commuter train, which runs from San Diego to Union Station in Los 
Angeles, added Irvine to its five other Orange County stops. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the passengers, mostly Irvine and El Toro residents, used to have to 
travel to stations in San Juan Capistrano or Santa Ana to catch a train. 
</P>
<P>
Standing next to Walters was controller Pat Desmond, who calculated he used to 
drive 13 miles just to get to the Santa Ana station from his El Toro home. Now 
he is only 3 1/2 miles away. "I may even bike to the station," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The train, subsidized by the County Transportation Commission, arrives at Union 
Station at 7:25 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
A return train leaves Union Station at 5:45 p.m. and arrives in Irvine at 6:43 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the commuter train, which operates only on weekdays, two other 
regularly scheduled Amtrak trains will make stops at the Irvine station each 
day. 
</P>
<P>
About 2 million passengers a year now ride eight daily, round-trip Amtrak 
trains between San Diego and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The old East Irvine passenger train depot closed in 1947. Experts see the new 
$13-million Irvine facility as a way station for van pools, buses and the 
granddaddy of transportation dreams -- a monorail system linking south Irvine 
with the John Wayne Airport and other parts of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, commuters will even be offered the chance to be picked up at home 
by van and delivered to the station, said Diana Brewer, president of Pinnacle 
Transport Inc., which will operate the transportation service. 
</P>
<P>
The facility's first tenant, scheduled to move in today and Sunday, is the 
nonprofit Irvine Spectrum Transportation Management Assn., which coordinates 
van pools, ride-sharing, bicycle commuting and train travel for employees who 
work at 800 area businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Musolf of Sunwest Asset Management Corp., the leasing agent for the 
facility, said she hopes to attract a car rental agency, snack shop and 
newspaper stand to the center, scheduled to open and begin selling tickets by 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday, commuters seemed to regard the fact that they had to buy their $9 
one-way tickets or $13.50 round-trip tickets on the train as a minor 
inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd rather get on here, near where they live," said the train's conductor, 
E.B. Burwell Jr., as he scribbled the 6:14 a.m. arrival time in a small book. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we're going to have to pull out," the conductor said as the clock struck 
6:15 a.m. "All aboard!" LEON TEEBOOM

PSYCHIATRIST SAYS CHILD RAPE SUSPECT FIT FOR TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: DEFENSE INSISTS THE FORMER POLICEMAN IS MENTALLY INCAPABLE. A FULL 
HEARING ON HIS COMPETENCE IS ORDERED BY THE COURT.

<P>
A psychiatrist reported Friday that a former Beverly Hills policeman accused of 
raping an 11-year-old Irvine girl is sane and capable of standing trial for the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
But members of the defense team for Steven Rush McCoy challenged that 
conclusion at a court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. McCoy is not capable of intelligently assisting us in his defense," said 
William L. Cassidy, a defense investigator. "Mr. McCoy has a history of 
seducing mental health professionals with his considerable charm. Unless one 
looks beneath the surface, it is hard to see just how disturbed Mr. McCoy 
really is." 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy also contended that McCoy, 36, of Irvine was heavily sedated when he 
was interviewed by Dr. David Sheffner, the court-appointed psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy pleaded not guilty in late April to the charges of rape, sexual assault 
and burglary stemming from the March 26 incident. On that day, a man posing as 
a deliveryman carrying a package persuaded the 11-year-old girl to open the 
door and then raped her at knifepoint inside her apartment in University Town 
Center, Irvine police said. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing in Harbor Municipal Court Friday, Judge Christopher W. Strople 
transferred the case to Superior Court. A full hearing on McCoy's mental 
capacity will follow. 
</P>
<P>
Both prosecutors and the defense plan to have McCoy examined by psychiatrists, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ariadne Symons. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Jan Heger said the report was incomplete because it did not 
include his client's prior medical records. The psychiatric report, although 
discussed in court, was not released. Cassidy said McCoy had been hospitalized 
repeatedly for mental disorders. 
</P>
<P>
Police investigators said the girl picked McCoy out of a photo lineup as her 
assailant. 
</P>
<P>
Police found several items at McCoy's apartment, located in the same complex as 
the victim's, that appear to link him to the crime. Among them were articles of 
clothing belonging to the victim, a knife and a stained sheet believed to be 
from the attack. Investigators also found a book entitled "How to Assert an 
Insanity Defense." 
</P>
<P>
In early April, Judge Strople doubled McCoy's bond to $500,000 after 
prosecutors testified to finding notes in the defendant's handwriting that 
suggested he planned to flee the area and change his identity. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Los Angeles, McCoy joined the Beverly Hills Police Department in 
October, 1976, before being named a full-time officer in January, 1978. Beverly 
Hills police officials refused to give the reason for his dismissal, but McCoy 
said it was because he was disabled by a motorcycle accident.

MURDERER'S EXECUTION FORMALLY SCHEDULED

<P>
A judge Friday scheduled convicted killer Robert Jackson Thompson's execution 
date for Aug. 21, a formal step necessary before Thompson's appeal moves into 
the federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, convicted in the murder and sexual molestation of a 12-year-old 
Anaheim newspaper boy, is probably at least five years away from execution, 
most prosecutors and defense attorneys involved in death-penalty cases believe. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just another step we have to take, but an important one," said Chief 
Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. Enright, who prosecuted Thompson seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Enright did not speculate about how many years it would take before Thompson is 
executed but said Thompson's appeal "has a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Three other county men on San Quentin's Death Row -- James A. Melton, John 
George Brown and William George Bonin -- have had execution dates scheduled 
since the state Supreme Court upheld their death sentences. All are in the 
early federal appeal stages. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, now 42, was sentenced to death Dec. 6, 1983, for the 1981 murder of 
Benjamin Brenneman, a newspaper carrier with the Orange County Register who had 
been seeking subscriptions in an Anaheim apartment complex where Thompson 
lived. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson had been paroled just a few weeks earlier, after serving a sentence 
for molesting a young boy. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson eventually admitted kidnaping Benjamin, tying him up and carrying him 
off in his car in the trunk. But he has never admitted committing the murder. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, the state Supreme Court upheld Thompson's death sentence. His 
case was then remanded to Superior Court Judge Francisco P. Briseno, who had 
issued the original death sentence, for Friday's formality. Thompson was not 
present during the brief hearing. 
</P>
<P>
His appellate attorneys will now ask for a stay of execution, which in all 
previous death-penalty cases has been perfunctory as the appeal moves into 
federal court.

CENTRALIZED-JAIL PLAN WOULD DELAY CONSTRUCTION, FOES SAY

<P>
In an effort to persuade voters to defeat Measure A, which would restrict all 
new jail construction to Santa Ana, city officials and other opponents 
denounced the initiative Friday as bad public policy. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, city officials said the passage of Measure A on Tuesday 
would do nothing to relieve the county's already overcrowded jail facility. 
</P>
<P>
"If this measure passes, we're saying to drug dealers, you have 20 solid more 
years of continued business in Orange County," Mayor Daniel H. Young said. "If 
we want to have the ability to put these drug dealers away, we need to have a 
jail. Measure A would delay any construction for years." 
</P>
<P>
The city may take legal action if the measure passes, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Young said Measure A would delay construction of any new jail because the 
county would have to readjust its plans to fit Santa Ana. Over the past seven 
years, the county has spent $6 million in developing plans and sites for a new 
jail. The county is under a court order to ease overcrowding at the current 
jail in Santa Ana. The 3,200-acre Gypsum Canyon site was chosen as the best 
alternative last year by the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Measure A, which voters will consider next Tuesday, was placed on the ballot by 
residents of Anaheim Hills and Yorba Linda who oppose the county's plan to 
build a 6,000-inmate jail in nearby Gypsum Canyon, a remote area neighboring 
Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
The group, Taxpayers for a Centralized Jail, gathered more than 100,000 
signatures in a 1988 drive to qualify the measure for the ballot. The measure 
has been heavily criticized as being racist because it would place all future 
jails in the mostly Latino community of Santa Ana. On the ballot, the measure 
asks whether all future jails should be built in the county seat, but does not 
mention Santa Ana by name. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed 6,720-bed Gypsum Canyon facility, if moved to Santa Ana, would 
most likely require that at least 50 acres in the newly developed downtown area 
be razed to make room, Councilman Miguel A. Pulido Jr. contends. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to two aerial maps -- one showing rural Gypsum Canyon, the other 
showing Santa Ana's downtown packed with buildings -- Pulido decried the 
initiative as being "self-serving" only to Anaheim Hills and Yorba Linda 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are going to put jails in Santa Ana today, what's tomorrow going to 
bring us?" Pulido said. 
</P>
<P>
Young also challenged Measure A's supporters to specify a location in the city 
where a facility such as the currently proposed 6,720-bed jail could be built. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know this is a cynical measure. We all know there is no room for such a 
jail," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Violett, the initiative's chairman, said it was not up to supporters of 
the measure to find a site for a jail. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sending a message to the supervisors and telling them to look at an 
alternative site instead of plunking it in somebody's backyard," Violett said.

DEBATERS GET DOWN TO CASES ON COURT OVERHAUL

At a debate about a ballot initiative that would overhaul the state's court 
system, the host, Superior Court Judge David G. Sills, told the audience he 
hoped the discussion would be "academic." With such an emotional topic, Sills 
should have known better. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Jennifer Keller said something that Municipal Judge 
Anthony J. Rackauckas called "an insult to all judges in the county." Then 
Superior Court Judge Luis A. Cardenas said something that Keller called "an 
insult to all defense attorneys in the county." 
</P>
<P>
Keller not only declared the measure, Proposition 115, a disaster for 
California, but called it "poorly drafted." Rackauckas, one of its co-authors 
who sat inches from her elbow, kept a poker face. But Deputy Dist. Atty. James 
P. Cloninger, the other co-author, could not conceal his slightly gritted 
teeth. 
</P>
<P>
But then Cloninger might have still been fighting back his reaction to defense 
attorney Jack M. Earley's veiled suggestion that Proposition 115 carried racist 
overtones. 
</P>
<P>
But between heated moments, participants in the Thursday night debate gave the 
audience of news reporters, attorneys and judges at the Orange County Bar Assn. 
headquarters a detailed discussion about the effects of Proposition 115. 
</P>
<P>
Authors of the measure intend to streamline the state courts to make them 
operate more like the federal system. They believe the proposition's provisions 
will dramatically reduce the amount of time between arrest and trial. 
</P>
<P>
Then, once a case goes to trial, they believe, time will be saved by having the 
judge take over the questioning of prospective jurors -- the way it's done in 
federal court. 
</P>
<P>
But Earley and Keller, fierce opponents of the measure, suggested that the 
trade-off is the defendant's right to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
"We (in the state courts) have a different society; our clients come from a 
diverse ethnic background," Earley said. "We need to deal with racial issues in 
jury selection." 
</P>
<P>
Co-author Cloninger said the measure was in line with what the framers of the 
state Constitution intended nearly a century and a half ago. But Earley 
retorted, "The framers of the Constitution were all Caucasians." 
</P>
<P>
One major provision of Proposition 115 would allow police officers to give 
hearsay testimony at preliminary hearings -- namely, telling the court what 
other people have told them about the crime. Preliminary hearings are used to 
determine whether there is enough evidence to try someone in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Allowing hearsay not only spares the victim having to testify twice -- at the 
preliminary hearing and then at trial -- it would cut down on the length of the 
preliminary hearing, proponents of the initiative say. 
</P>
<P>
But Keller was concerned that hearsay testimony will make a mockery of the 
purpose of a preliminary hearing by allowing as evidence potentially inaccurate 
secondhand and thirdhand information. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll get Officer Jones testifying that Officer Smith told him that he heard 
from Officer Rodriguez that Barbara, the victim, said the defendant is the guy 
who robbed her," Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
Not at all, Cloninger said. "What you have now is the victim taking time off 
from work to come in and testify, 'I went shopping at K mart and when I came 
out, my car was gone,' " he said.

MARINA TAKES SOME MEETINGS ON ITS WAY TO TONIGHT'S TITLE GAME;

<P>
5-A DIVISION: CATCHER LINDSEY AT THE CENTER OF OFF-FIELD CONFRONTATIONS THAT 
HELPED PUT VIKINGS IN FINAL WITH DIAMOND BAR.

It wasn't a game-winning hit or a change in personnel that helped to turn 
around Marina High School's baseball program. Three off-the-field meetings 
steered the Vikings toward tonight's Southern Section 5-A championship game at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
First, there was a meeting last year between Coach Paul Renfrow and catcher 
Robin Lindsey after Renfrow suspended Lindsey from the team for two days when 
the catcher walked off during practice. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was a team meeting during which players discussed their roles and 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there was a heated argument between Lindsey and pitcher Sean Patterson 
in the school parking lot following a 10-5 loss to Edison in the first round of 
Sunset League play. 
</P>
<P>
It shouldn't come as any surprise that Lindsey, Marina's often-animated and 
emotional leader, was at the center of the three meetings. 
</P>
<P>
When Lindsey was asked who did most of the talking at the team meeting, he 
didn't hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
"Me," he said. "I'm not afraid to say what's on my mind. I don't beat around 
the bush. We had guys who should be hitting singles going for the fences and 
support players complaining because they weren't starting." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he told Patterson in the parking lot, Lindsey said, "I told him he 
was letting the team down. We yelled at each other for 30 minutes and almost 
came to blows. Since then, Sean's been 7-0." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, asked why he walked off the practice field as a junior and said he was 
quitting the team, Lindsey said, "I was tired of losing. I had played on 
winning teams all my life and couldn't take it any more. I was tired of the 
losing attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey doesn't pretend to have all the answers, but he has never been afraid 
to offer an opinion to his coaches, or take some criticism from them. He is the 
spiritual leader of a team that has scored four upsets in the postseason, 
including a 4-1 victory Tuesday over Westlake, USA Today's No. 1-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey leads Marina (16-12-1) into tonight's championship game against Diamond 
Bar (21-8) with a new-found feeling of pride in the Vikings' program. Marina 
finished last in the Sunset League in his sophomore and junior seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The road to the title game was bumpy. Lindsey and his teammates have weathered 
some tough times, but have discovered that playing with confidence is a great 
equalizer. 
</P>
<P>
"In our first game against (Hacienda Heights) Wilson, we really didn't think we 
could beat them," Lindsey said. "We wanted to win, but we never really thought 
we could. But when we got a 4-0 lead in the fifth inning, you could see the 
attitude changing. 
</P>
<P>
"After the game, we talked about just beating the No. 4 seed. If we got the 
same effort in the next game, we could win again. Ever since the first playoff 
game, the effort has been there and we've played with great confidence." 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't always the case. Lindsey recalled the day he walked off Marina's 
baseball field in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Renfrow chased me down and we got into an argument over my attitude," he 
said. "I quit the team. Two days later, I realized I made a mistake. I went 
over to his house and we talked about changing my attitude . . . about changing 
the attitude of the team. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Renfrow is one of the best fundamental coaches I've ever played for. 
He's always been positive. But there was always a losing attitude. Nobody cared 
enough to call a team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody cared enough to tell someone they weren't doing the job. When this 
season began, Marc Newfield and I sat down and decided we were going to do 
whatever it takes to change that." 
</P>
<P>
The changes included a confrontation with Patterson in the parking lot after 
Patterson walked the first five batters and allowed five runs in the first 
inning in the loss to Edison. 
</P>
<P>
"He's throwing ball after ball and shaking me off," Lindsey said. "I was ready 
to kill the guy. I thought we were going to go at it in the parking lot. Since 
that day, Sean's curveball has been almost unhittable." 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey was the team's second-leading hitter during the regular season, batting 
.432 and driving in 29 runs. Against Westlake, he started Marina's winning 
rally with a single to left field in the sixth inning, but it was a play he 
made an inning earlier that sparked the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey threw out Westlake's Rick Wolters attempting to steal second in the 
fifth, and then pointed to Westlake's boosters following the play. The ploy 
fired up his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't trying to show anybody up, I was only trying to take their fans out 
of the game," he said. "I play with emotion because I like to win. Sometimes, I 
let my emotions take me out of a game, but that's just the way I am."

TUSTIN PITCHER FREQUENTLY GIVES HIMSELF SERMONS ON THE MOUND;

3-A DIVISION: DAN BAKER RANTS, RAVES -- AND EVEN SINGS -- BETWEEN PITCHES. HIS 
14-1 RECORD ALSO SPEAKS VOLUMES.

Dan Baker talks a pretty good game . . . usually while it's in progress. 
</P>
<P>
Between pitches, the Tustin High School pitcher has been known to take a little 
stroll behind the mound for a conference. He talks and yells, even babbles. 
Sometimes, he sings. 
</P>
<P>
But mainly Baker just gets angry -- at bad pitches he has thrown or untimely 
hits he has allowed. It's a ritual his teammates are used to and opponents, not 
to mention umpires, are baffled by. 
</P>
<P>
"Every now and then, an ump will lean over and whisper to me, 'Who's he talking 
to?' " Tustin catcher Ryan Relph said. "When I say, 'To himself,' they lean 
back and we get on with the game. I don't think they want to know any more." 
</P>
<P>
It can be annoying to hitters, who must stand at the plate watching the 
6-foot-2, 200-pound left-hander stalking and talking. But Baker is even more 
annoying to hitters when he returns to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Baker has pitched -- and talked -- himself to a 14-1 record, which 
is one victory short of the recognized Orange County single-season record. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Messersmith was 15-3 for Western in 1963. Baker will get a chance to match 
that mark when he pitches against La Serna in the Southern Section 3-A 
championship game at 1 p.m. today at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for all his victories -- 27 in three seasons -- the talk about Baker is 
about Baker talking. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see where some coaches might look at what Baker does and think he's a 
hot dog," Saddleback Coach Bob Mangram said. "But it's not directed toward 
anyone but himself. If I had a pitcher who was that good, he could do whatever 
he wanted to do on the mound." 
</P>
<P>
Said Tustin Coach Vince Brown: "I hear some criticism that Danny's immature on 
the mound. He's not trying to degrade anybody, he's just getting mad at 
himself. He gets angry and then he attacks the plate." 
</P>
<P>
The method of Baker's madness has worked. He comes into today's game with a 
1.23 earned-run average and has won five consecutive games, four of which have 
been shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
Baker has allowed only two runs in the past 47 innings. He had a string of 34 
consecutive scoreless innings before it ended in a 6-2 quarterfinal victory 
over La Quinta last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
So Baker's talk is anything but cheap. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a left-hander, you know," La Quinta Coach Dave Demarest said. "They're a 
different breed. They do everything backwards or maybe we're the ones who do 
everything backwards." 
</P>
<P>
Baker can't explain why it all began. He said he has never heard of Al Hrabosky 
or Mark Fidrych, two of major league baseball's most famous stalkers and 
talkers. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said he developed the pitching rap on his own. When he was 12, he began 
singing songs to himself on the mound. It soon progressed to singing -- out 
loud -- while he was pitching to remain focused on the game. 
</P>
<P>
He expanded his routine to include talking and yelling. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a psychotic or anything like that," said Baker, a senior. "I talk to 
myself out there because it gets me pumped up to pitch. Sometimes I yell at 
myself when I make a mistake or when there's a pitch I think was a strike. I'm 
a perfectionist, I think any pitch that's close to the plate is a strike. But 
I'm not crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Relph has been Baker's catcher for the past four years, in youth leagues and 
then at Tustin. He quickly got used to Baker's habit. 
</P>
<P>
"It was weird the first time I caught Dan," said Relph, a senior. "I went out 
to the mound to see who he was talking to. He said, 'To myself.' I thought, 
'OK,' and went back to the plate. It works, so why mess with it?" 
</P>
<P>
And it has worked. 
</P>
<P>
After helping the Tillers' frosh-soph team win the Sea View League title as a 
freshman, Baker was moved up to the varsity as a sophomore. He became the 
team's No. 2 starter and finished with a 6-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Baker was 7-2 with 100 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I saw Dan pitch was when he was in Pony League and he was 
great," Brown said. "I knew he was going to help our program. Of course, when I 
saw him storm around the mound, I felt I was going to have to break him of that 
habit of talking on the mound." 
</P>
<P>
Brown has since changed his mind. He said the routine is an important part of 
Baker's pitching style. 
</P>
<P>
He did get his pitcher to calm down a little this season, but when Baker's 
pitching suffered, Brown took the restraints off. 
</P>
<P>
"Dan is just emotionally into the game," Brown said. "You can't take a kid's 
personality away from him. He works within the 'team' concept, but he also has 
to have some individualism." 
</P>
<P>
The combination has been deadly. 
</P>
<P>
Baker won his first eight decisions before losing to Newport Harbor, 4-0. After 
that game, he adjusted his pitching style because he wasn't getting the 
velocity on his pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Baker began using his legs more when he pitched and the results were immediate. 
After the Newport Harbor loss, Baker pitched four consecutive shutouts and 
didn't allow a run for 34 innings, one of which was in relief. 
</P>
<P>
"Early in the season I had been trying to be too fine, I wasn't over-powering 
batters," Baker said. "After the Newport Harbor game, I watched a video of 
(Foothill pitcher) Kent Donnelly and saw how he used his legs when he pitched. 
I changed my motion so I ended up in more of a crouch like Donnelly." 
</P>
<P>
Baker said that he has picked up five-to-seven miles per hour on his fastball 
since the change. He has 102 strikeouts in 92 innings pitched. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the one knock on Baker by college recruiters is that he doesn't throw hard 
enough, according to Brown. And, about the only one talking about where Baker 
will be pitching next season is Baker. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his impressive record and the fact that he's a usually coveted 
left-hander, few schools have been recruiting Baker. He has received a partial 
scholarship offers from UC Irvine and Chapman. Baker also made a recruiting 
trip to California, but was told there was no money left for a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"My fastball is in the mid-to-low 80s, but that doesn't seem to impress the 
scouts," Baker said. "How can I be 14-1 and not be a good pitcher? It has been 
really frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
Baker said that, for a while, the lack of interest by recruiters affected him 
on the mound. He went out to prove them wrong, but it only hurt his pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, he finally put the frustration behind him. He went to talk to 
Rancho Santiago College Coach Don Sneddon and decided to pitch for the Dons 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a big relief," Baker said. "By going to Rancho Santiago, I can keep 
all of my options open. I can pitch there for two years and then go on to a 
four-year school. I'm not locked into anything." 
</P>
<P>
Of course Sneddon was happy to help. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not complaining at all that no one has been recruiting Dan," Sneddon said. 
"He's the type of pitcher that can make a program like ours very successful. He 
may not have a major league fastball, but he knows how to pitch and he knows 
how to win." 
</P>
<P>
And that's something to talk about.

GARDEN GROVE COMES UP SHORT; 
</P>
<P>
4-A DIVISION: THREE HITS AND TWO ERRORS IN SIXTH INNING GIVE CHARTER OAK A PAIR 
OF RUNS AND THE TITLE.

Unseeded Charter Oak took advantage of four Garden Grove errors to win the 
Southern Section 4-A championship softball game, 2-0, Friday at Mayfair Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers (22-4) strung together three hits in the sixth inning and, with 
the help of two Garden Grove errors, to score the two runs. 
</P>
<P>
They collected four hits off Garden Grove pitcher Stephanie Smith, the Orange 
County strikeout leader with 323. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference was our hitting," said Charter Oak's first-year Coach Joey 
Davis. "I've said every day this week that this is the best hitting team in the 
CIF. We've got two kids hitting .400 and three others hitting over .300." 
</P>
<P>
Kathi Evans and Kelly Hunt, the .400 hitters, were key players in the decisive 
sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Becky Champlin was safe on an error and Julie Kiluk reached on a 
fielder's choice and advanced when Evans beat out a ground ball to short. 
Laurie Grey reached on an error to load the bases and Hunt singled to score 
Kiluk. 
</P>
<P>
Shari Schultz then laid down a perfect bunt on a suicide squeeze play that 
scored Evans. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew they were going to bunt when they had the runners on and the girls knew 
it," Garden Grove Coach Paula Cervantes said. "But you get kind of caught up in 
the emotion and we got hand tied. 
</P>
<P>
"I give them credit. They put the ball in play when they had to. Their speed is 
unbelievable. I think tonight you saw we were on base almost every inning, but 
our inability to execute the bunt hurt us. We just didn't get the bunt down and 
didn't get behind the runners when we needed to." 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove stranded five runners and was thwarted in the fourth and seventh 
innings by spectacular plays by second baseman Kiluk. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove's Smith (25-5-1) struck out nine. Champlin (6-1) pitched a 
three-hitter with eight strikeouts. Garden Grove ends the season at 25-5-1.

LAUBY'S RISING PITCHES HAVE EL TORO SOARING; 
</P>
<P>
3-A DIVISION: BATTERS CAN'T RESIST HER RISE PITCH AND, AS A RESULT, SHE HAS 
ALLOWED JUST ONE EARNED RUN THIS SEASON.

EL TORO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's no secret where Paige Lauby's pitches are going or where they have taken 
the El Toro High School softball team. 
</P>
<P>
In a rapid reversal of gravity, Lauby's pitches usually wind up on a higher 
plane than the one on which they started. The pitch is called the rise, and 
batters try to avoid swinging at it, because when they do make contact, it's 
usually a pop-up. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro's opponents know what to expect, but it doesn't seem to help. Lauby is 
15-2 with a 0.05 earned-run average (she has allowed one earned and three 
unearned runs) and 237 strikeouts in 127 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they know it's coming," Lauby said, "but they haven't been able to 
stop swinging at it." 
</P>
<P>
The senior will be aiming for her eighth consecutive shutout when the Chargers 
meet Don Lugo in the Southern Section 3-A championship game at 5:30 tonight at 
Mayfair Park in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
When the season began, Lauby was one of three El Toro starting pitchers. 
Charger Coach Jim Daugherty said he wanted to develop more than one pitcher and 
make sure Lauby didn't wear out her arm. 
</P>
<P>
However, during the last month of the season, Lauby has reclaimed the top spot 
on the Chargers' staff. 
</P>
<P>
Lauby has pitched every inning of El Toro's past seven games, including four 
playoff games. She has 59 strikeouts in her four playoff shutouts, including 20 
in a 14-inning victory over Trabuco Hills in the second round. She closed out 
the South Coast League season by throwing two consecutive no-hitters against 
San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that she's overpowering," Daugherty said. "I think that there are a 
lot of pitchers who are faster. But it's that good spin and rotation on the 
ball that makes her successful. 
</P>
<P>
"She has some funny pitches. I don't know what they all are." 
</P>
<P>
Though Lauby admits to depending more on her rise this season, she said she 
still uses a curveball, screwball and changeup -- whatever it takes to hold the 
opposition scoreless. El Toro's offense hasn't scored much in Lauby's support 
all season. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers are batting .176 in the playoffs but have uncharacteristically 
scored eight runs in four games. Lauby is used to pitching in closer games. 
</P>
<P>
"(Close games) make me do a lot better," she said. "I know if there is someone 
on third base, I can't let her score. But I can't put down our offense because 
I'm not doing very well at the plate, either."

NEW JOURNAL OFFERS STATISTICS GALORE ON HOUSING MARKETS

<P>
In case your shelf of real estate periodicals isn't overflowing already, a trio 
of industry heavyweights has launched a new one. 
</P>
<P>
The Meyers Group, a Chino-based real estate research and consulting firm, has 
teamed with Brea-based economist Alfred Gobar and Boud Real Estate Information 
Systems, a statistics specialist, to prepare and publish the Southland-oriented 
Real Estate Economic Journal. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the 10 issues each year will concentrate on a single housing market. 
</P>
<P>
Readers of the journal will get supply-and-demand summaries along with 
population, employment growth and building permit data; examinations of trends 
in residential construction and projections of what to expect from the local 
economy and from future home sales will be offered. 
</P>
<P>
The first two issues of the journal already have hit the streets. The inaugural 
book dealt with Riverside County, while the second volume was devoted to the 
Antelope Valley. Next up, the publishers say, is San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
It won't be Orange County's turn until the ninth issue in November. 
</P>
<P>
The books, priced from $950 to $1,500 an issue (the Orange County volume will 
run $1,250), are aimed at statistics junkies, builders, lenders, speculators 
and anyone else who can benefit from what amounts to an off-the-shelf market 
feasibility report. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of the journal are available at the three Meyers Group offices.

RETAIL POWERHOUSE IN BREA UPGRADING ITS RETAILING RANGE;

MERCHANDISING: THE SHOPPING CENTER WILL ADD 50 MORE SHOPS FOR A TOTAL OF 190 
WHEN THE JOB IS COMPLETE NEXT YEAR. THAT WILL CAP $120 MILLION IN IMPROVEMENTS.

<P>
It started as a regional mall like many others. Nothing particularly different 
set Brea Mall apart from the other stucco shopping monoliths that dot Southern 
California, except it had an ice rink. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the ice rink is gone, but the mall has developed into the retailing 
powerhouse of North Orange County. One renovation has followed another, a 
combined $120 million in improvements that is adding more than 200,000 square 
feet of specialty and department store retail space. 
</P>
<P>
And the mall will add 50 more shops for a total of 190 when the job is complete 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Brea is a super area. Everyone wants to be there," said Ian Brown, a senior 
marketing consultant for the commercial real estate firm of Grubb &amp; Ellis 
in Newport Beach. "Retail space around the mall in Brea is a highly prized 
commodity." 
</P>
<P>
Just how highly prized? Consider: 
</P>
<P>
* Nordstrom tore down a 10-year-old store at the mall to make way for a new one 
twice as large. The new store was cited as one of the Seattle-based chain's 
major accomplishments of 1979 at a recent Nordstrom annual meeting. "It's doing 
very well," said Jammie Baugh, Nordstrom's general manager for its Southern 
California stores. 
</P>
<P>
* Robinson's will open a new store here next summer, becoming the mall's fifth 
anchor, along with Nordstrom, Sears, May Co. and the Broadway. Ground was 
broken Friday for the Robinson's store. A sixth department store is planned. 
</P>
<P>
* The mall is attracting such upscale stores as Jacques Verts and Godiva 
Chocolatier, which heretofore have been ensconced only in such hoity-toity 
county malls as Fashion Island in Newport Beach and South Coast Plaza in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
* Brea Mall shows up consistently in marketing surveys as second in the county 
only to South Coast Plaza in taxable retail sales. In 1988, the latest 
statistics available, Brea Mall had $188 million. That is a distant second to 
South Coast Plaza, which had $624 million in sales, tops in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The mall's success as the shopping mecca of North County is a triumph of both 
demographics and positioning. 
</P>
<P>
The 13-year-old mall has tapped a clientele from such ritzy high-growth areas 
as Anaheim Hills. And at the same time, Brown said, the mall has drawn the 
upper crust from such older communities as Whittier, Yorba Linda and Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Its demographics are some of the best in the county: young and well-to-do. The 
average Brea Mall patron is 41, has a household income of $60,000 a year, is 
married, has children and shops 80 to 90 minutes at a time, mall marketing 
director Diedre E. Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
The mall has tried to appeal to upscale customers with new marble floors and 
elaborate indoor fountains. At the same time, it has tried to keep a touch of 
the rural character of the nearby hills with huge, wood-beamed ceilings and 
expansive skylights. 
</P>
<P>
Designer shops have followed -- and Brea Mall has been more than happy to 
accommodate them. "We're trying to upgrade our retailers wherever we can," mall 
general manager James Charter said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides making money for retailers and its owners, Corporate Property Investors 
of New York, the mall has become Brea's biggest contributor of sales tax 
revenue. Overall, the mall has accounted for roughly 10% of the city's 
revenues, said real estate consultant Al Gobar, who conducted a study of the 
mall's contributions to city coffers. 
</P>
<P>
Situated on Imperial Highway within eyeshot of the Orange Freeway, the mall was 
conceived as a regional shopping center in 1969. Brea Mayor Pro Tem Wayne D. 
Wedin, an economic development consultant and former Brea city manager, said 
the city built the center before other planned malls went ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was telling Brea you couldn't do it, you'll never make it," he said. 
"And that's not the right thing to tell Brea." 
</P>
<P>
The mall has also become a city center. Brea Olinda High School held its prom 
recently at the mall with such success that couples did not want to leave when 
the music stopped, Palmer said. Party-goers could visit a fortuneteller, have 
their photograph snapped, be penned by a cartoonist and nosh on free 
Haagen-Dazs ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
The mall also holds many civic and charitable organization fund-raisers.

Club Memberships: For those who long for the ballyhooed Coto de Caza scene but 
can't see any way to make the mortgage payments comes a way to enjoy a bit of 
that ol' champagne lifestyle on a beer budget. . . . Well, more like a Dom 
Perignon lifestyle on a Moet et Chandon budget. 
</P>
<P>
The Coto Valley Country Club, for nearly 20 years the preserve of those who 
lived within the private community, is now selling equity memberships to all 
comers (providing the current members approve, of course). 
</P>
<P>
The club, which became the property of its 650 original members in settlement 
of a lawsuit last year, is selling the memberships to raise a solid base of 
operating funds. 
</P>
<P>
Price, in addition to the $125 monthly dues, will be $5,000 for each of the 
first 50 memberships, going up in $1,500 increments with each additional 50 
memberships sold to a total of 2,500 memberships, general manager Tom Howard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For that, members get to use all club facilities, including the Coto de Caza 
Equestrian Center, a shooting range, gymnasium, fitness center, youth center, 
swimming pool, tennis and racquet ball courts, a restaurant and lounge -- plans 
call for a second restaurant to be built, Howard said -- and private billiard 
and card rooms in the clubhouse.

Rising in the Ranks: Newport Pacific Development Corp. has broken into the top 
rank of apartment builders nationally, placing 10th on Builder Magazine's most 
recent list, for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Pacific started 1,998 apartment units last year. 
</P>
<P>
That, combined with 49 single family units the company began, also earned the 
firm the magazine's ranking as the country's 34th largest residential builder 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
Many local builders are heading for Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego 
counties to do their thing, but Newport Pacific Chairman Magdy Hanna said his 
company did 95% of its work in Orange County last year. Not only that, but, 
eschewing the fashionable South County, Newport did most of its work -- 66% of 
all the units it started -- in Anaheim.

TEEN WITH RARE FORM OF CANCER ALSO HAS RARE ATTITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
By any yardstick, the odds look pretty good: If you're a kid, you only have 
about a one-in-two-million chance of contracting adrenocortical carcinoma, a 
particularly rare and virulent form of glandular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Statistically, that means that out of the entire population of Orange County, 
only one person should ever get it. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Flores became such a person in 1982, at age 5. 
</P>
<P>
Today, eight years and eight operations later, she continues a solitary fight 
with adrenocortical carcinoma. Inoperable tumors have spread throughout her 
body, often leaving her in great pain. They have constricted the blood vessels 
leading to her legs, causing them to swell painfully and confining her to a 
wheelchair. She must keep the pain in check with frequent medication, and 
oxygen is often needed to help her lungs function because of the tumors growing 
in them. 
</P>
<P>
When she speaks, her voice quavers unevenly. 
</P>
<P>
But, otherwise, it is difficult to tell that Maria Flores is hurting. She 
smiles as she talks about recently seeing the ocean for the first time, about 
whales and seals, about her friends at the hospital, about the prize she won in 
a drawing contest. She is, say the medical personnel who have worked with her 
at UCI Medical Center's cancer center, one of the rarest of patients: a 
teen-ager in pain who routinely seems more concerned about her family and 
friends and fellow pediatric cancer patients than about herself. 
</P>
<P>
"She's the one who asks every time she comes down to the clinic, 'So who's in 
the hospital? How's so-and-so doing?' " said Kristy Zilly, a child life 
specialist in pediatrics at UCI. "She's always keeping up with the other kids 
who are in the cancer clinic. I don't get that from the other kids." 
</P>
<P>
In turn, said Zilly, the hospital staff is always happy to see her. 
</P>
<P>
"She's everyone's pet around here," Zilly said. "Almost everyone makes it a 
point to see her when she's here. They say, 'Oh, Maria's here. Let's go say 
hi.' " 
</P>
<P>
One of four children of Leobardo and Alba Luz Flores of Placentia, Maria "has 
always been very caring and loving," said her father through a translator. 
"It's been very hard for us, but she tries to make everyone feel better. She's 
been very strong and very thoughtful. Just seeing her trying to keep a positive 
attitude helps us." 
</P>
<P>
Such an attitude is all but unheard of among pediatric cancer patients, said 
Maria's oncologist, Dr. Violet Shen. 
</P>
<P>
"These children, when they get cancer, they really have to go through a lot in 
their treatment, and it can make them very sick," Shen said. "They have to have 
a lot of needle pokes. Very few of them tolerate it very well. They usually 
hate it and fight it. And they can get very depressed and refuse to come to the 
clinic or see the doctor or take their medicine. But Maria's very brave. She 
has bad days sometimes, but she never gets angry or complains. She always 
smiles, even though she knows the disease is incurable." 
</P>
<P>
Maria already has beaten very long odds. 
</P>
<P>
Shen said that most people who are stricken with adrenocortical carcinoma die 
within three to five years. In Maria's case, surgeries and chemotherapy had 
removed or reduced the number of tumors in her body over the last six years, 
but about eight months ago tumors continued to grow without responding to 
treatment. And, as the pain became more acute, drugs had to be introduced in an 
attempt to lessen it. 
</P>
<P>
But, said Zilly, "she would always try to put on a good face. When we'd be on 
an outing somewhere, she might have to go to the bathroom to be sick, but she'd 
come back and be apologetic, saying she didn't want to spoil the good time for 
everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
When the hospital staff learned that Maria had never seen the ocean, they 
arranged a trip to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Sea World in San 
Diego. During the trip, said Zilly, one of the staff members heard Maria's 
labored breathing as she walked (she was not yet confined to a wheelchair) and 
offered to carry her. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'No, I always breathe like this in the morning,' " Zilly said. "She 
was just so excited to be there. She made a point of bringing seashells home 
for her family." 
</P>
<P>
Such forbearance may help ease the ordeals of other children with cancer, Shen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that although we're not able to cure her, scientifically we have 
learned some (new treatments from her case)," Shen said. "In the future, we may 
be able to help more people through what we've learned. Also, she is so 
unusual, and she gives so much encouragement to the people who treat her. She 
shows she's able to tolerate the treatment. We know that she can do it, and so 
we can tell other patients that Maria can do it, that Maria took it very well, 
and they can, too." 
</P>
<P>
When Maria herself feels the pain set in, she turns to artwork. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes when I feel really sick and just lie in bed," she said, "I try to 
color. It kind of works." 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Maria is proudest of a crayon drawing she did that won a drawing 
contest among the pediatric cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
"You had to color a picture of you going to the hospital," she said. "I drew a 
nurse putting an IV in my arm. Kristy called me today and said I'd won a 
prize." 
</P>
<P>
In a talking balloon above her smiling self-portrait, Maria printed the words, 
"It didn't hurt."

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: 'MAXIMILIAN'S GARDEN' HAS LATINO SETTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huntington Beach author Nina Vida's latest book is an historical novel that 
deals with past and present Mexico and has a Mexican-American judge from Los 
Angeles as its contemporary heroine. 
</P>
<P>
But despite her Spanish-sounding name, the Huntington Beach author of 
"Maximilian's Garden" (Bantam; $4.95) is actually an Anglo of Russian-Jewish 
heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Vida, who grew up in East Los Angeles in the late '30s and early '40s and later 
learned to speak fluent Spanish, said "Maximilian's Garden" is "kind of 
unusual: There are very few Mexican-American novels in the mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
She said she did not feel intimidated being an Anglo writing what she calls a 
mainstream Latino novel. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, all my books deal with the history of some people," she said. "I'm 
used to doing research, and I'm very confident. But my fear is the Chicanos 
feel they should be writing the mainstream book that gets out there, and here I 
am a non-Chicano writing about Chicanas and Chicanos and getting in the 
mainstream. I may be overly sensitive about it. I'm hoping they look at the 
book and not who wrote it. Let that stand." 
</P>
<P>
The book seems to be standing on its own quite well indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Vida learned last week that "Maximilian's Garden" has been sold to Diana 
Publishers in Mexico City, which will translate it into Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a very big plus because Mexico hardly ever buys American books," she 
said. "They're just not interested in our books." 
</P>
<P>
In this country, the opposite is true. Vida said few Latino books are published 
by American publishing houses. Arte Publico is one small prestigious press that 
publishes Latino writers, she said, "but it is very difficult for the Chicano 
writer to get through to mainstream publishers." 
</P>
<P>
Of "Maximilian's Garden," Vida said, "I hope this is a beginning for Hispanic 
novelists in the mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
To research her novel, Vida devoured Mexican history books and traveled 
extensively, making four trips to Mexico and one to Guatemala during the two 
years she spent writing it. 
</P>
<P>
Vida said she did not originally set out to write the book she did. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to write a different book about a woman judge and a murder trial. 
She was not Mexican. She could have been just an Anglo Presbyterian. All of a 
sudden, she's sitting on the bench and here she is a Chicana," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"That just opened up the whole thing: Who is she? How did she accomplish what 
she's accomplished? What brought her here? Who are these people? What is the 
Mexican past? 
</P>
<P>
"I realized then I had something very exciting to write about." 
</P>
<P>
"Maximilian's Garden" begins with Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Dolores 
(Dee) Guadalupe Sorenson hearing the sanity phase of a murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
The murderer, a wealthy investment banker who picked up prostitutes on Sunset 
Boulevard and left their mutilated bodies strewn along the center divider of 
the Hollywood Freeway, escapes from his holding cell and leaves a threatening 
epithet written in lipstick on the judge's living room wall. 
</P>
<P>
While the murderer is loose, Sorenson goes to Mexico on vacation with her 
sister. While there, she meets a Mexican soap opera star who is the 
great-great-grandaughter of Maximilian, who became Napoleon III's puppet 
emperor of Mexico in 1864. 
</P>
<P>
With her heroine plunged into the political morass of present-day Mexico, Vida 
then begins to pull in the strands of Mexico's past, showing "what brought us 
up to the present." 
</P>
<P>
Explains the author: "It's like an onion: You keep peeling away the layers, 
getting at the heart of what Mexico really is." 
</P>
<P>
Author Honored: Author Elizabeth George of Huntington Beach has received the 
1990 Le Grand Prix de Literature Policiere, France's top prize for 
detective-mystery-suspense fiction. 
</P>
<P>
The author of a series of British mysteries received the award for her 1988 
first novel, "A Great Deliverance," which was published in France in March. 
</P>
<P>
George said she was amused by "the irony of an American woman writing a British 
novel and beating out the French authors for the prize." 
</P>
<P>
The French title for her novel: "Enquete Dans Le Brouillard." 
</P>
<P>
"Translated, that becomes 'Inquest in the Fog,' which is amusing since there is 
no fog in the book," said George, who received a telegram from her British 
publisher notifying her of the award. She also received flowers from her New 
York publisher, Bantam. 
</P>
<P>
George's next British mystery, "Well Schooled in Murder," will be out in late 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Literary Contest: The winners of UC Irvine's Chicano Literary Contest were 
honored last Saturday at Santa Ana High School's Little Theater. 
</P>
<P>
First-place winners were Carolos Nicolas Flores of Laredo, Tex. (short story), 
Maria Dolores Bolivar of La Jolla (poetry) and David Melendez of Los Angeles 
(theater). First-place winners received cash prize of $400; second place 
received $250 and third place, $150. 
</P>
<P>
The contest, sponsored by the Department of Spanish and Portuguese, is designed 
to promote and broaden the dissemination of Chicano literature. More than 120 
submissions in all three categories were received.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Liberian rebellion that threatens to overthrow the 10-year regime of Samuel 
K. Doe is led by Charles McArthur Taylor, a self-described "church-going 
Christian" who wears a magic amulet around his neck to ward off bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor calls himself a "die-hard capitalist" who wants only to restore 
democracy, honor and Christian values to Liberia after a decade of corruption 
under Doe. But U.S. officials remain profoundly suspicious of the rebel leader, 
whose movement has alleged financial ties to Libya and who says he has no 
intention of sharing power with anyone after ousting his longtime rival. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-educated Taylor, 42, served for three years as a Cabinet minister in 
Doe's government before vanishing in 1983 amid accusations that he embezzled 
nearly $1 million from the Liberian treasury. Interpol, the international 
police agency, tracked him down to the United States and he was picked up by 
U.S. authorities in May, 1984, on a Liberian extradition warrant. 
</P>
<P>
He escaped from a Massachusetts jail in 1985 to avoid trial on the Liberian 
charges and later appeared in the West African nations of Ghana, Burkina Faso 
and Ivory Coast, where he put together the rebel band now approaching the 
Liberian capital of Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
Those who knew him as a student organizer in Massachusetts and a Cabinet 
officer in Liberia describe him as vain, authoritarian and not too bright, 
according to U.S. officials who are compiling biographical data on the figure 
who may soon lead the impoverished African nation founded by former American 
slaves in 1847. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was born and raised in Liberia but, like many of the descendants of 
former slaves who refer to themselves as Americo-Liberians, went to the United 
States for his higher education. 
</P>
<P>
According to school records, Taylor was graduated from Bentley College, a 
little-known business school in Waltham, Mass., with a degree in economics in 
1977. Peter Kent, a college official, said a quick canvass of faculty members 
could find none who remembered the Liberian undergraduate. 
</P>
<P>
After graduation, Taylor apparently stayed in the Boston area and was active 
with the Union of Liberian Assns. in the Americas, according to a former 
official of the group who testified at Taylor's extradition hearing in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor himself said last month that at the time of the Doe-led coup that 
toppled former Liberian President William R. Tolbert Jr., he had been president 
of the U.S.-based National Liberian Liberation Movement. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in the village of Tapeta, Liberia, on May 18, Taylor 
accused Doe of illegally holding power after leading the 1980 rebellion of 
junior army officers. Back then, Doe was a 30-year-old master sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
"That boy was supposed to return his little self to the barracks and he 
reneged," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
After seizing power, Doe invited Taylor to return to Liberia to serve as 
director general of Liberia's General Services Agency. Taylor served in the 
post from April, 1980, to September, 1983, when he vanished after allegedly 
diverting $922,000 in government funds to a private bank account in New York 
controlled by a fictitious firm called International Earth-Moving Equipment 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberian government, backed by the U.S. Justice Department, sought Taylor 
for extradition to Monrovia to face trial on embezzlement charges. When he was 
traced by Interpol and arrested in Somerville, Mass., Taylor did not ask for 
bail, saying he feared for his life if he were to be released. 
</P>
<P>
At an extradition hearing that September, Taylor's lawyer, former Atty. Gen. 
Ramsey Clark, said that the charges against Taylor were political and warned 
that the former Liberian official would be murdered if he were returned to his 
native country. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. magistrate ordered Taylor extradited in March, 1985, but he escaped from 
prison before he could be transported. When he turned up later that year in 
Ghana, U.S. officials dropped the extradition warrant against him because he 
was already outside of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I skipped from jail to escape Doe's lies," Taylor said at last month's press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in for peace but the peace I'm in for is the peace that does not involve 
Samuel Doe," Taylor said in a recent interview with the British Broadcasting 
Corp. "Now we can talk all the peace in the world, but Doe is in no position to 
talk to our Liberians about peace." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said he felt no need to include other Liberian dissidents in any 
government he might form, and refused to promise elections any time soon. He 
gave no other hints as to the nature of the regime he might establish, except 
that he wanted to maintain friendly ties to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LIBERIA 
</P>
<P>
At-a-Glance 
</P>
<P>
LAND 
</P>
<P>
Lying between Ivory Coast, Guinea and Sierra Leone, the West African nation of 
Liberia covers 37,743 square miles. The coastal plain gives way to rocky 
cliffs, and strong tides make access to the Atlantic Ocean difficult. The 
highest elevations are in the northern highlands, which rise up to 4,500 feet. 
</P>
<P>
THE PEOPLE 
</P>
<P>
The population is estimated at more than 2.5 million, including 16 principal 
tribal groups and about 50,000 descendants of freed American slaves who founded 
the country. English is the official language. The vast majority of the country 
practices traditional African religions. 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY 
</P>
<P>
Even before a 5-month-old guerrilla war began, the economy was near collapse, 
though the country possesses some of the richest iron ore in the world. Liberia 
has been unable to pay its foreign debt, and it has been suspended by the 
International Monetary Fund. Though the currency is tied to the U.S. dollar, 
little money is in circulation, driving up prices and increasing the value of 
the few dollars available. Though mining earns more than 64 percent of 
Liberia's foreign exchange, agricultural remains the main employer. 
</P>
<P>
HISTORY 
</P>
<P>
In 1822, freed American slaves visited Liberia and began settlements. They 
declared Liberia an independent republic in 1847. Descendants of the freed 
slaves, called Americo-Liberians, dominated the country until then-Master Sgt. 
Samuel Doe led a military coup on April 12, 1979. He was popular with the 
majority of Liberians, who resented the dominance of the Americo-Liberians. Doe 
headed a military government until October 1985, when elections were held. He 
claimed a victory, but opposition parties and independent observers said the 
vote was rigged. On Dec. 24, 1989, former Doe aide Charles Taylor invaded with 
a small band of men from Ivory Coast. Taylor said he intended to topple Doe's 
government.
