AL MARTINEZ: PETER AND THE DILETTANTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
I came home the other day smiling and whistling a little tune and my wife said, 
"What's the matter?" 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing," I said, kissing her on the cheek and patting our dog, Hoover, on the 
head. 
</P>
<P>
"Something's the matter," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy, for God's sake. Why do you insist something's the matter?" 
</P>
<P>
"For one thing, happy isn't you. For another, you just kissed the dog." 
</P>
<P>
"I love the dog," I said, wiping my mouth in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
"You may love the idea of the dog, but you don't love the dog. And if you ever 
pat me on the head again you get one right on your mother's nose." 
</P>
<P>
Relatives used to say I had my mother's nose. I still do. Though my mother is 
gone, her nose lives on. 
</P>
<P>
"You only smile when you're miserable," my wife said. "You still being bugged 
by the lady who predicts earthquakes by throwing up?" 
</P>
<P>
"Naw. She stopped calling weeks ago." 
</P>
<P>
"Did an editor challenge your syntax?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to talk about it, OK? Let's just go out and have a nice dinner. 
No cooking tonight." 
</P>
<P>
"Good idea. La Famiglia? Chez Helene? Gaetano's? L'Ermitage?" 
</P>
<P>
"McDonald's." 
</P>
<P>
"Lie on the floor and breathe normally," she said. "I'll call the paramedics." 
</P>
<P>
She doesn't understand. I'm just trying to make contact with what Supervisor 
Pete Schabarum calls the real people. The man on the street. The woman in the 
gingham dress. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote me the other day and said I was a fatuous dilettante and ought to stop 
wandering through rose gardens and get to the blue-collar areas. 
</P>
<P>
I guess that's why I came home happy. No one had ever called me a fatuous 
dilettante before. Most of my critics tend to couch their epithets in cruder 
terms. I love it when an ex-jock talks intellectual. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of going to Fresco Ristorante," the supervisor thundered, "try going 
to McDonald's and ask the real man-on-the-street his thinking on public 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
All this began when "Pistol Pete," angered by AIDS activists, shot from the 
mouth at a Board of Supervisors meeting. Hardly anyone cares about AIDS (bang!) 
or about AIDS funding (bang, bang!), he said. 
</P>
<P>
He set himself up like a pork roast at a glutton's table. I couldn't resist. I 
talked to people I met casually and asked if they cared about AIDS. They were 
at the Huntington Rose Garden and at a restaurant called Fresco. 
</P>
<P>
When the column appeared, Pistol Pete wrote. Fatuous dilettante. Try going to 
McDonald's. Get to the real people. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think there were any fatuous dilettantes that came out of Oakland," 
my wife said. 
</P>
<P>
"He challenged me to eat at McDonald's, where the Joads chow down." 
</P>
<P>
"That's probably where he eats." 
</P>
<P>
"No, I figure him more as a Pioneer Chicken kind of guy, with maybe anniversary 
dinners at the Sizzler." 
</P>
<P>
"All the shrimp you can eat." 
</P>
<P>
OK, so I went to McDonald's. And Denny's. And Carl's Jr. And I asked the people 
-- the real people -- do you care about AIDS? 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, Pete. They do. 
</P>
<P>
I could've told you that. In a Gallup Poll last year, one out of every three 
Californians said they believed AIDS was the most important health care issue 
the state faced. More important than cancer. More important than heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
Ask them. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a little boy," a guy in jeans and a plaid shirt said. "Christ yes I 
care about AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
That was at a McDonald's in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
A woman said, "Now they're saying the test for AIDS is no good. Care? I'm 
scared to death." 
</P>
<P>
Denny's, Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"They say more kids in junior high are testing positive," a delivery man said. 
"That means it's going to get worse. Only a fool wouldn't care." 
</P>
<P>
Carl's Jr. on South Figueroa. 
</P>
<P>
All real people, Pete. Not a journalist, poet, professor or pink-tinted floral 
arranger among them. They were butchers and bakers and candlestick makers. 
Twelve in all. And every one of them gave a damn. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve opinions don't constitute a consensus. But they say to me, if not to 
you, that the concern over AIDS isn't limited to gays or fatuous dilettantes. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so one guy cursed the "faggots." A woman pounded the Bible. But I found 
more compassion than hatred, and not one of them didn't care. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't surprise me. I've been a reporter for 30 years. Trust the people, 
Pete. The people in silk suits at four-star restaurants, and in hard hats at 
fast-food places. 
</P>
<P>
A telephone lineman summed it up when I asked if he cared. He looked at me with 
an expression of incredulity and said, "Man, don't everybody?" 
</P>
<P>
Bob's Big Boy, Highland Park.

<P>
The 16th annual Los Angeles Mayor's Prayer Breakfast will be held next 
Saturday, renewing an event that tends to feature charismatic Protestants and, 
lately, a little political suspense. 
</P>
<P>
The breakfast drew its highest attendance last year -- 2,000 -- when the 
featured speaker was House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), who resigned that 
position Wednesday after defending his handling of personal finances against 
ethical violations charges by the House Ethics Committee. That panel voted to 
begin its investigation shortly before last year's prayer breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
The featured speaker this year is U.S. Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole, who 
is under no such cloud. But questions about financial conflicts of interest 
have been raised recently in Los Angeles about Mayor Tom Bradley, who will be 
present and speak briefly at the 8 a.m. event at Westin Bonaventure Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Keith Phillips said he does not know whether advance ticket sales, 
which reached 1,000 this week, reflect any sympathy for the mayor. "I think the 
sense of the Christian community is that if the mayor ever needed prayers, he 
needs them now," said Phillips, adding that he was making no judgment on the 
validity of various charges. 
</P>
<P>
"The breakfast is not tied specifically to Bradley; we pray for the well-being 
of the city -- for concerns about drug and gang activity," said Phillips, who 
heads World Impact, an inner-city ministry that is handling ticket reservations 
((213) 735-1137). 
</P>
<P>
Among the charismatic Christians taking part in the program are master of 
ceremonies Pat Boone, who will sing; Trinity Broadcasting Network owners Paul 
and Jan Crouch; Bishop Charles E. Blake of the Church of God in Christ; Pastor 
Lloyd John Ogilvie of Hollywood Presbyterian Church and Pastor Jack Hayford of 
the Church on the Way in Van Nuys. Charismatic and Pentecostal Christians 
believe in speaking in tongues and other "gifts of the Holy Spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Last year singer Andrae Crouch, ex-football star Roosevelt Grier, actor Dean 
Jones and the Crouches took part in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said the breakfast's sponsoring committee is only 50% charismatic 
Christian and the predominant participation of charismatics this year and last 
was unintentional. "I am not a charismatic myself," he said. He suggested that 
the selections came about because charismatic clergy and lay people are among 
those who are best known in public life for their Christian identity. 
</P>
<P>
CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
A conference on Jewish spirituality, including mystical traditions in Judaism, 
is being held for the third year by the Westwood Kehilla, which describes 
itself as an eclectic Orthodox community embracing members at varied levels of 
religious observance. Rabbi Abner Weiss, the spiritual leader of Beth Jacob 
Congregation, will give a plenary talk on the "spiritual dimension" of sex, 
love and marriage at the June 11 conference. Workshops include "Hassidic 
Wisdom," "Kabbalah of Love and Meditation," "Music as a Vehicle to God" and one 
by Rabbi Joel Zeff, the congregation's spiritual leader, on "Prayer: Making the 
Rote Meaningful." The conference, which will start at 8:30 a.m., will be held 
at Hillel Hebrew Academy in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE 
</P>
<P>
Mary Elizabeth Moore, a professor at the School of Theology at Claremont, has 
been elected to chair the board and serve as president of the Religious 
Education Assn. She is the first woman to head the board in the 86-year history 
of the organization. Moore said the association is an interfaith body that 
brings together theorists and practitioners, and the only such organization 
"working internationally in religious education." The spring issue of its 
quarterly journal, Religious Education, featured articles on religious 
education trends in Islam and eastern religions. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Stein has resigned as president of Atheists United, a small but active 
Los Angeles-area group with an office in Sherman Oaks, to accept a position as 
associate professor of biology at the University of Rhode Island. Stein, who 
was succeeded by Herb Livingston, edited the two-volume "Encyclopedia of 
Unbelief" and edited two anthologies of atheist and rationalist writings during 
this decade for Prometheus Press. JOHN DART

LOS ANGELES TEACHERS' STRIKE SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This strike has been an education in the truest sense of the word. However, 
this one had little to do with books and pencils. 
</P>
<P>
As educators we have precious little time to spend with one another but we 
won't soon forget one memorable exception. Those of us on strike from my school 
went to breakfast one morning after picketing to assess how we were holding up 
as a group. At that time we each shared our feelings about continuing our 
resolve to stay on strike and the discussion started to grow into something 
else. 
</P>
<P>
Our sharings made me truly proud to be in this beleaguered profession. We spoke 
about ours being one of the most important jobs on the planet. We spoke of 
being separated from those little faces that came to the fence every day and we 
were grieving. There was a growing awareness of real professional pride among 
us. 
</P>
<P>
Something happened that morning and the strike had actually brought us a gift. 
We can now go back to our school knowing we bring with us pride, a sense of 
trust and dignity. At the ratification rally I felt all teachers in Los Angeles 
had gained this and no one can take that away from us now.

I was both saddened and appalled as I heard the fire trucks and helicopters 
trying to save the burning Pan Pacific building. This beautiful Art Deco 
building has remained empty and in disrepair for a number of years. If this 
disregard for buildings is how the people of Los Angeles treat their historic 
landmarks, then maybe the people of Los Angeles do not deserve them.

<P>
As a citizen I was appalled when I watched the LAUSD police manhandle teachers 
who were demonstrating at the district offices on May 22. As a teacher I was 
incensed when I saw men and women grabbed in headlocks, slammed onto the hood 
of a car, arms wrenched behind their backs to be handcuffed and finally placed 
in a patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
As a citizen I was infuriated when it was stated that the reason for this 
brutality was because the teachers were accused of trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
As a teacher all LAUSD police officers I know have always performed their 
duties in a professional manner, displaying restraint when required and showing 
sensitivity when appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
However, the badge-happy "rent-a-cop" mentality displayed by the LAUSD officers 
at the district office on May 22 showed only contempt. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps their actions reflect the district's true feelings toward teachers.

The Times' coverage of the strike was enriched by Marita Hernandez's articles. 
She helped all of us gain insight into the personal turmoils of the strike by 
interviewing the administration, striking teachers, teachers who crossed the 
picket lines, as well as the students of Le Conte Junior High. Her effort to 
elicit all sides of a difficult issue is to be commended.

This item may be of interest to your readers, possibly the older ones like me. 
In 1935 the Pan Pacific put on its first show for the Actors' Benefit Fund. I 
know of this because as a very young dancer I and others like me had the honor 
to be part of this great event. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Chaplin let us practice in his studio; everyone was generous and 
wonderful for the good cause of raising funds for retired actors and actresses. 
On the performance night the stars came out and did skits from their best 
movies -- it was a night! 
</P>
<P>
I feel so sad about what happened. I feel that many dreams went up in smoke for 
us all. A wonderful and historical landmark is gone forever.

I am boiling mad that Laker fans were denied the pleasure of watching earlier 
playoff games because they were broadcast on cable television. 
</P>
<P>
Those of us in the noncable world think of this as a crisis and don't like 
being shut out. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't there anything we can do about this? Is the world so commercial that our 
sports can be enjoyed only by those who contribute to that commercialism?

WHAT WENT AROUND FINALLY CAME AROUND FOR RACING'S UNSERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I respectfully suggest that Jim Murray might be better off reviewing old 
Hollywood racing movies than irresponsibly sensationalizing the Emerson 
Fittipaldi-Al Unser Jr. incident by suggesting that it was anything but an 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
Fittipaldi did not intentionally eliminate Unser Jr. for two reasons: (1) To do 
so would have been equally dangerous to both; and (2) Fittipaldi is a 
gentleman. 
</P>
<P>
More important, neither Unser Jr. nor any of his protective relatives or team 
members has blamed the accident on anything but racing.

ABT, GRAHAM UNITE FOR GALA AT MET 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusual joint gala, Thursday, American Ballet Theatre and the Martha 
Graham Dance Company combined to present an evening at the Metropolitan Opera 
House benefiting the training adjuncts that feed dancers into their companies. 
</P>
<P>
The event opened with 37 Graham schoolchildren ages 8 to 10, enthusiastically 
executing simple floor work, then crossing the stage in runs and leaps. 
</P>
<P>
The movement became twistier and more exultant for teen-agers in Nile green 
unitards, and then the select members of the Martha Graham Ensemble, in black 
and white, declared their identities more fiercely with characteristic 
contractions, gestures of thrusting and pushing away and snaking arms and legs. 
</P>
<P>
Without a break, the program slid into the choral pomposity of "Ritual to the 
Sun," from Graham's 1981 "Acts of Light." The excellent Julian Littleford and 
Maxine Sherman -- whose dancing has become distressingly quirky -- led 17 
dancers through the vigorous routine. 
</P>
<P>
Neat in execution, but not at all docile in manner, eight polite teen-agers 
from ABT's school put their hearts into dancing a waltz, mazurka and Krakoviak 
against a background of white curtains, a terrace and evening sky. Then the 
same set filled with a flood of dancers for a dizzying "Fete Polonaise," the 
final movement of George Balanchine's "Bouree Fantasque," led by Cheryl Yeager 
and John Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
All that was introduction. The meat of the program was in the two Graham 
masterpieces from the 1940s that followed, "Night Journey" (1947) and 
"Appalachian Spring" (1944), with casts that mingled, to a small degree, 
dancers from both companies. 
</P>
<P>
Mikhail Baryshnikov danced the role of Oedipus in "Night Journey" (one of the 
juiciest male roles in the Graham oeuvre) with such riveting ferocity that he 
altered the usual focus of the piece. His character is fully achieved just in 
the domineering way he sets his foot over Jocasta, or flings his cape around 
her shoulders to claim her as his property. 
</P>
<P>
But the whole work was performed with deep understanding -- from Donlin 
Foreman's gloomy, stick-thumping, blind seer, to the frantic Priestess (Thea 
Nerissa Barnes) and her six cohorts, to the wracked Jocasta of Terese 
Capucilli. 
</P>
<P>
Capucilli isn't always as simple as she might be, but I doubt if it's her 
fault. Most Graham roles have been tarted up and exaggerated in recent years, 
as if the-powers-that-be fear that unless everything is blatant, the audience 
won't get it. The only real distraction was the Isamu Noguchi set that, 
somehow, has been turned into a cheap imitation of itself. 
</P>
<P>
In the noble "Appalachian Spring," Martine van Hamel dances the Pioneering 
Woman with more graciousness and infinitely less sternness than anyone in 
recent years. The presiding spirit of the opening frontier, she's less a 
survivor of the hard past than a welcoming, though slightly distant, hostess. 
</P>
<P>
With his light, whirling leaps and sharp knee-slaps, Ricardo Bustamante (of 
ABT) danced the Husbandman with a happy rightness of feeling. Just the way he 
ran his hand tenderly over the house wall on his entrance was so completely 
expressive of his expectant relationship to his new home. But his presence 
wasn't yet as defined sculpturally as the other leading dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Rooks, as the Revivalist, was brisk and comic with his bouncing little 
flock of groupies and particularly fine in the hellfire solo. But Christine 
Dakin as the Bride was fresh and recticent. The dynamic fluidity of Dakin's 
performance was a revelation, particularly in the long solo where she giddily 
turns from girl to woman and back again at a rocketing pace. 
</P>
<P>
The ABT/Graham gala came about, indirectly, as a result of a discussion Graham 
had with Baryshnikov over a year ago regarding the possibility of ABT 
performing her "Diversion of Angels." That event will take place next season 
and will be the first time that Graham choreography enters the regular 
repertory of a classical company. 
</P>
<P>
Baryshnikov performed "El Penitente" with her company last year and danced the 
Husbandman in "Appalachian Spring" at a gala in the fall of 1987. Rudolf 
Nureyev essayed a whole range of Graham roles. 
</P>
<P>
"Diversion of Angels" has an airiness and brightness of surface that may 
facilitate its adoption by ABT. But, in general, Graham's greatest works -- 
more emphatically muscular than ballet, rooted more deeply in a flexible use of 
the torso, and marked by the formal brutality of flexed feet and stiffly cupped 
hands -- would seem less amenable to performance by a ballet company. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence of the gala, however, bodes well for the "Diversion of Angels" 
project. If ABT puts its resources at the service of that work with the 
commitment shown at this gala, both Graham's art and ABT will be well served.

THE FEAT OF CLAY: A TOUGH GUY'S STAND-UP COMEDIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE CHRISTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andrew Dice Clay, who played to a sellout house at the Universal Amphitheatre 
on Thursday, is riding the strangely schizoid phenomenon of a comedian who may 
be one of the most reviled figures in entertainment while remaining one of its 
hottest tickets, like a truly dirty secret everyone wants to hear. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper columnists deride his grossness, his misogyny, homophobia, xenophobia 
and the expletives that fill up his act like lumps in a vile stew. Improv owner 
Budd Friedman has said that Clay is the only comedian he's ever bad-mouthed in 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
Clay earns every epithet thrown his way, but anyone who is either loved too 
much or hated too hard requires a deeper look. He isn't, after all, working in 
a vacuum. You could say that there are millions of pretend tough guys like Clay 
hanging out, indolent and dull-eyed, entertaining rapacious sex-fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
So why has this one become such a cause celebre? 
</P>
<P>
 First, Clay's a showman. He knows how to play big. Ten minutes into his act, 
when your ear is beginning to tune out material that's already run its course, 
he still holds your eye. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the macho image he struts, part Elvis Presley glitter idol and part 
Sylvester Stallone biker, strikes a vibrant chord in the obscure and secretly 
fretful hearts of the young men who make up the bulk of his audience. There 
were a lot of weight-lifter types out there Thursday, a lot of guys in black 
leather jackets, blue-collar figures and people who looked as though they'd 
left school early to go to work; men who, when they get together, talk about 
car engines and admire the Raiders for being the most vicious team in the NFL 
(there were some Raider jackets there, too). 
</P>
<P>
There were younger frat types as well, who looked as though they were checking 
Clay out as a prelude to a beer bust. The entire crowd, in fact, was amazingly 
charged, long before Clay took the stage, with the visceral intensity that 
surrounds a championship prizefight or an NBA final. Clay spoke to their sexual 
energy and their confusion at the same time; if all the women he mentioned were 
just a series of pliant orifices accompanied by plaintive little nagging 
voices, he could take the blunt physical pleasure he wanted, any way he wanted 
it, and disdain the rest (female, during sex: "I just wanted to be held." Clay: 
"Well, ya got the bonus plan, baby"). 
</P>
<P>
It could be said that with all the legitimate and painful struggles women have 
had over the years to gain recognition as equals, it hasn't been all that easy 
for men, either, in their deep apprehension of modern society as a lonely crowd 
with few compass points on which to peg an identity. The macho strut can be 
part sexual vigor, but it can also be part delayed adolescence, where all the 
messy ambiguities of the flesh disappear in the totalitarian allure of the sex 
video in one's head. 
</P>
<P>
Clay speaks to those fantasies of complete physical conquest and emotional 
disengagement. His play at being dumb also appeals to America's stubborn 
penchant for hanging on to ignorance, as though it were a surrogate for youth. 
When he says things like "I hate to use these propatactics" or "I don't have 
anything against gays, it's those transtesticles I can't stand," those 
mispronunciations are a play at one's early clumsiness at learning (he even has 
a litany of obscene nursery rhymes). 
</P>
<P>
Or they're a play, too, on the Latinisms of the educated, those authoritarian 
symbols of the duplicitous, the corrupt, the impotent, the irrelevant. The wise 
leaders who, when not on the take, ceded national pride to Iranian terrorists, 
and the economy to Japan. ("You can't speak the . . . language," goes one of 
his famous lines, "get out of the country!") 
</P>
<P>
Clay also restates one of the underlying tenets of the '80s: In the face of so 
much of our cultural phoniness, attitude travels. Watching him at work and 
hearing his adoring audience call out the lines in his routines in unison, 
high-fiving and cheering, you can understand how a demagogue works the anxious 
hearts of his audience by providing an image, something specific, something 
clear. A sequinned leather jacket. A swastika. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people fear the ripple effect that Clay's mock-thuggish attitude will 
have on other talent that wants to emulate his success, show-biz success being 
the supreme arbiter of popular taste in our time. And there's no question that 
the retrograde simplicity he plays to is perilously allied with our mounting 
tolerance for barbaric self-expression. What's surprising about Clay in person, 
though, is how much of his act seems to be amiable goofin' on a very low level. 
It isn't John Rambo we see up there; it's more an undiluted street version of 
the Fonz.

FACES.....: A CHILD OF MTV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She's the entertainment equivalent of a bonsai tree: a pretty, dark-eyed girl 
who sways to the rock beat, bumps and grinds, flips her hair from side to side, 
punching out soulful bits of melody in a theatrical growl. But the adult moves 
and performance savvy come in a small package: 11-year-old, 60-pound Josephine 
F. Roberto, known to her fans as "Banig." 
</P>
<P>
The Filipina singer, who'll appear in concert Sunday at the Wiltern Theatre, 
credits MTV and radio for shaping her musical tastes. "I like Whitney Houston, 
Tina Turner, Gladys Knight, Aretha Franklin and Michael Jackson," Banig says, 
listing her stylistic mentors. "I watch all of them. But I don't try to copy 
them or look like them. I like to look like myself." 
</P>
<P>
Banig, whose American career took off last winter when she was named a finalist 
in the International Star Search competition, has since appeared as the opening 
act for Duran Duran. Although her native tongue is Tagalog (she'll sing three 
of her own songs in that language), the majority of her repertoire -- which 
includes "Midnight Train to Georgia," "Any Day Now" and "Get Down" -- will be 
sung in English. 
</P>
<P>
The Manila native began performing in 1986, when her parents entered her in a 
local talent contest. Although she only placed third, the performing bug bit 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Banig stresses, pursuing the career has been solely her decision. 
And she has no intention of slowing down. "I never get tired of singing," she 
says in her resolute, little-girl voice. "I'd like to sing and sing and sing . 
. . and make more money." As for stage fright, "S-s-s-sometimes I get it," she 
giggles, stuttering for comic effect. "But I only get scared when there are few 
people in the audience." JANICE ARKATOV

FACES.....: A MAN WITH NO NAME

<P>
Richard Young doesn't have a big role in "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade." 
We never even learn the name of his character -- a roguish adventurer who's 
identified in the credits as "Fedora." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he's mighty pivotal to the Indy Jones saga. As it turns out, it's his 
character who gives the young Indy (played by River Phoenix) his trademark hat. 
And who provides inspiration for the Indy "look." 
</P>
<P>
"When he gives him the hat, it's a kind of passing of the torch," muses Young. 
</P>
<P>
Young is currently in Corsica, where he is starring as a retired secret agent 
in the film, "Eye of the Widow." Co-starring F. Murray Abraham, Martin Landau 
and Ben Cross, it's based on a popular series of European books by Gerard 
DeVilliers. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are rolling along," enthused Young, 38, who will also be seen opposite 
Tom Selleck in the late summer entry, "Hard Rain." (Young plays a narcotics 
agent gone bad.) 
</P>
<P>
It was an episode of the Steven Spielberg-produced "Amazing Stories" -- in 
which he played Davy Crockett -- that led to a phone call ("a year and a half 
later") which led to "Indy III." 
</P>
<P>
"Steven Spielberg's office asked if I could come over for a chat." During that 
chat, Spielberg told him about a role that he called "the Indy prototype." 
</P>
<P>
Filming of the prologue required more than four weeks of shooting in Utah, 
Colorado and New Mexico. "It was great fun," said Young, who did his stunts, 
including running atop a moving train. 
</P>
<P>
During a break in filming, Young discovered that he and star Harrison Ford had 
something in common other than clothes. "I've been pounding nails for years -- 
doing carpentry in between my roles. It's kept me grounded in reality," said 
Young, who is in the midst of building a home for his family in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"So we didn't talk about acting. We swapped carpentry techniques." PAT H. 
BROESKE

JESSICA AND THE DANGER OF UNLICENSED CHILD-CARE FACILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent television dramatization of Jessica McClure's rescue from a well in 
the yard of her child care provider overlooked a major point -- this 
near-tragedy should never have occurred. Jessica, like hundreds of other 
children in California and elsewhere, was injured at an unregulated, unlicensed 
child-care facility. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes lost in such dramas is the fact that there are no national standards 
to regulate child-care quality. As Congress continues to debate the merits of 
child-care legislation, we cannot forget that while the availability and cost 
of child care are pocketbook concerns for every parent, licensing and safety 
standards are truly life-and-death issues.

Of the 52 child-care bills under consideration in Congress now, the Act for 
Better Child Care (ABC) is the only one with adequate provisions. Too often, 
pediatricians are called to treat children like Jessica only after their 
accidents; frankly, we don't want the business.

A PORTRAIT OF CHET BAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Feather's assertion that Baker "was a limited trumpeter . . . and an even less 
talented singer" is way off the mark and damning to Baker's talent ("Film 
Portrait Does Jazz a Disservice"). 
</P>
<P>
The first time I heard Baker's voice, I said to myself, "That's not singing, 
that's communicating!" He didn't take over a song, but rather he made it a 
listener's song. 
</P>
<P>
Baker had a talent to give of himself, like a Nina Simone or a Piaf or a Merle 
Haggard and damn few others. 
</P>
<P>
Chet Baker is gone and so are his troubles. The important thing is that his 
legacy lives on.

We would like to respond to film critic Sheila Benson and jazz writer Leonard 
Feather's dual attack on Bruce Weber's documentary movie "Let's Get Lost," 
about the late trumpeter Chet Baker (May 25). 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't seem like sound policy for The Times to run two damning reviews of 
any film. The criticisms were imbued with a petty viciousness that does a 
disservice to Los Angeles film audiences.

'IMPERIAL BELLS' TO RING IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN TAYLOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ancient music and dance of the Chinese Imperial Court will be re-created at 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center today and Sunday in a 10-act show 
called "The Imperial Bells of China." Sixty-five of the 200 members of the 
Hubei Song and Dance Ensemble, the official performance troupe in the central 
China province of Hubei, will wind up a two-month tour of the United States 
with the two shows here. 
</P>
<P>
(Shows in Los Angeles and Oxnard were to follow the Orange County performances, 
but they have been canceled. A press spokesman blamed the cancellations on poor 
advance ticket sales and said that the student-led demonstrations in Beijing 
for increased freedom were not a factor.) 
</P>
<P>
"Imperial Bells of China" was inspired by the discovery of more than 10,000 
artifacts, including 120 ancient instruments, during an archeological dig in 
Hubei province in 1978. A tomb of a Chinese nobleman, Marquis Yi, was found 
"and in the chamber, 64 bells were discovered, along with drums, string harps, 
and chimes," said Richard Lukens, president of Los Angeles-based China Business 
Management, which is producing the touring show. 
</P>
<P>
The bronze bells are thought to be the oldest fixed-pitched instruments ever 
found. 
</P>
<P>
Weighing as much as 600 pounds and as tall as 5 feet, the bells are on display 
in a museum in the Wuhan area of China and regarded by the Chinese as one of 
the wonders of the world, Lukens said. "The troupe felt it was their duty to 
re-create this ancient music." 
</P>
<P>
But this was no easy task. The ensemble began researching and developing the 
show eight years ago and it took three years to complete the groundwork. In 
addition, each musician designed and constructed his own instrument, modeled 
after the original. 
</P>
<P>
The end result is a re-creation of "the cultural, political and social life of 
the Chinese people 2,400 years ago," Lukens said. 
</P>
<P>
The entire show is in Chinese except for recorded commentaries by actor Gregory 
Peck, who provides descriptions of each scene and translations of the ancient 
poetic lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
Peck is a longtime supporter of cultural exchange between the East and West. 
His interest in the show was sparked during a trip to China a year and a half 
ago, when he saw a documentary in Shanghai about the bells. 
</P>
<P>
"I was fascinated and completely taken," Peck said. "It was a new vision into 
Chinese song. I offered to provide an English translation of the film and 
submit it to the Academy (of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences) in the 
documentary category. But the show was even better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a glimpse into the artistry and creativity of the Chinese, drawing 
on ancient culture, poetry, and folk tales." 
</P>
<P>
Lukens, former international director of Live Aid, became interested in 
continuing his involvement with cross-cultural exchange events while working on 
Live Aid in Beijing. While there, he met his future wife and co-producer of the 
show, Erin Wang-Lukens, the daughter of a Chinese official. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to produce some sort of Chinese show in the United States, and the 
Minister of Culture showed me some of the shows available. I thought this 
troupe was special." 
</P>
<P>
With the help of Wang's family connections with the Ministry of Culture and the 
Chinese government, Lukens brought "Imperial Bells of China" to the United 
States, continuing his commitment to help bring countries together through the 
arts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lui Youcai, one of two leaders of the ensemble, is thrilled with the American 
audience's response to the show. 
</P>
<P>
"They love it, but we have much to learn about America outside of performing 
here," Lui said. 
</P>
<P>
The music director of the troupe, Peng Xian Cheng, welcomed the opportunity to 
tour the United States: "It's on the other side of the earth. We are used to 
the crowds of China, and America is a great big land. 
</P>
<P>
"This type of cultural exchange is important," he said, adding he hopes to 
introduce the show all over the world. "This kind of tour shows friendship 
between the countries."

'SHANNON'S DEAL': COLOR THE LONER-LAWYER GENRE DRAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Sayles wrote "Shannon's Deal" (Sunday at 9 p.m., Channels 4, 36 and 39), a 
pilot that didn't make the cut for next fall. As might be expected from the 
creator of such offbeat films as "Return of the Secaucus Seven," "The Brother 
From Another Planet" and "Eight Men Out," it's a fairly rich script for its 
genre. 
</P>
<P>
That genre is lawyer show, scrappy loner subdivision. Here we have a guy (Jamey 
Sheridan) who, fed up with corporate law and wracked by gambling debts and a 
failed marriage, puts out his own shingle -- in a fleabag building occupied by 
ambulance chasers. Shannon is no chaser -- of ambulances or anything else. He 
appears willing to sit in his office and theorize about poker. But desperate 
women, anxious about their imprisoned boyfriends, come to him -- and he becomes 
entangled in their cases. 
</P>
<P>
The plot ventures into the arena of right-wing zealots who cooperate with drug 
runners in order to ship arms to the Contras -- an unusually ambitious 
departure for this kind of show -- and it doesn't paint Shannon as a pillar of 
political rectitude. The decision he makes near the end of the story is highly 
debatable. Sayles scores points for making Shannon less than a shining white 
knight and for creating a gallery of interesting and sometimes amusing 
subsidiary characters. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those characters, however, are developed more predictably than we might 
expect from Sayles; we can feel the effort to make this show as colorful as 
possible despite its drab milieu. Furthermore, Shannon's adventures get a 
little farfetched. Although Sheridan's Shannon is never less than charming, his 
tendency to view everything as an analogy to a game of cards becomes tiresome. 
</P>
<P>
Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis wrote and arranged the score, brooding and evocative, 
and Lewis Teague directed for producer Stan Rogow.DON SHIRLEY

KCET TO AIR JAPAN NEWSCAST IN ENGLISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As part of its growing interest in Pacific Rim programming, KCET Channel 28 on 
Monday will begin airing a 30-minute Japanese newscast in English. "Today's 
Japan" will air Monday through Thursday nights at 12:05 a.m. throughout the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
The program is produced by the Japanese network NHK for broadcast in that 
country. Norio Shimamura, general manager of NHK America, said that the 
newscast was conceived for English-speaking foreigners in Japan and for 
Japanese who are learning English, but the network found that "the quickly 
changing situation in today's Far East" had created other markets for it. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's Japan" also is carried on PBS stations in San Francisco, New York, 
Boston, Pittsburgh, Miami, Dallas, Washington and Seattle.

Whale toys, whale stories, whale films, sand whales, stained-glass whales -- 
and watermelon. It's all part of today's annual Whale Fiesta, 10 a.m. to 4:30 
p.m. at the Cabrillo Marine Museum, 3720 Stephen White Drive, San Pedro. Most 
of the offerings and museum admission are free. 
</P>
<P>
The big event of the day is the 60-foot humpback whale that will rise out of 
the sand on the beach in front of the museum. Everyone is welcome to help 
because the huge sand creation must be finished by 2 p.m. -- in time for the 
official picture-taking. There's watermelon for all helpers. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the museum, youngsters may step up to the arts-and-crafts tables to 
make whale visors, whale wind socks and origami whales. For 25 cents each, 
there are educational, carnival-type games: feed the squid to the sperm whale, 
whale migration and more. 
</P>
<P>
Marine-life experts will be on hand to answer questions. In the auditorium, 
films on sharks and the Channel Islands will be screened throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
The entries in the Great Cetacean Creation Sensation will be on exhibit and 
judged. These are whales done in wood, papier-mache, stained glass, brass and 
other media, created by children and adult artists. 
</P>
<P>
There will be a how-to-draw-whales workshop at 12:30 p.m., sea chanteys from 11 
a.m. to 1 p.m. and a concert by the Black Label Story Band from 1 to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Food will be available for sale or bring a family picnic and picnic in the 
nearby park or on the sand, within view of the 60-foot humpback, of course.

PLANT OF THE WEEK: GARDENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH SIMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Agapanthus africanus 
</P>
<P>
 Lily of the Nile 
</P>
<P>
Evergreen perennial with straplike leaves and blue or white flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Agapanthus plants are so commonly used in Southern California that they 
sometimes seem to disappear while we notice a more unusual plant. Not that we 
need to worry about its future; agapanthus will probably remain ever popular, 
because it combines ease of care with good looks -- big globe-shaped clusters 
of flowers on leafless stalks that rise well above the leaves -- and an affable 
adaptability to a wide range of growing conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Landscape designers love to place agapanthus under jacaranda trees; the two 
plants frequently bloom at the same time (June and July), and their flowers are 
nearly the same color. The lacy jacaranda leaves are nicely complemented by the 
sturdier, but no less graceful, arching agapanthus leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Agapanthus' second most frequent appearance is in borders. Any border -- 
parking lot, perennial flower, formal front yard, either in combination with 
other greenery or with masses of its own kind. 
</P>
<P>
Agapanthus has a tuberous root, or rhizome, but it is not offered for sale as a 
bare bulb, because it never goes dormant; most of the plants offered in 
containers are grown from seed or propagated by root division. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the standard 18-inch blue- and white-flowered varieties, there 
are dwarfs ("Peter Pan," also in blue or white, is best known) that grow only 
12 inches tall. Agapanthus orientalis, often confused with africanus, has the 
tallest and biggest flowers, with blooms sometimes reaching 4 feet. It is 
definitely showier than its africanus cousin, but because of its size it isn't 
as versatile; 4-foot flowers tend to loom. 
</P>
<P>
An established agapanthus can endure some drought, but it prefers lots of water 
during its blooming season. It will do well under trees because it can take as 
little as three hours of sun a day -- or full sun near the coast. And it 
flourishes in containers, probably because it likes its roots a little crowded. 
Feed agapanthus only during the growing season, and keep it slightly dry and 
hungry in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
If you can't locate agapanthus at a Southern California nursery, you're not 
trying. JUDITH SIMS

WEEKEND CHECKLIST FOR DEDICATED DIGGERS AND PLANTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen: 
</P>
<P>
Use stakes to support the stalks of taller gladiolus or delphiniums. 
</P>
<P>
Decorating the vegetable garden with marigold plantings seems to help keep 
snails away because of the musky smell of the foliage. 
</P>
<P>
If you're partial to Mexican food, plant some tomatillos in your garden this 
year. They're a basic ingredient in salsa verde. 
</P>
<P>
Try gerberas for a brilliant display of daisy-like flowers in a shaded border 
as a container plant or for cut flowers. 
</P>
<P>
If planting nasturtium seeds, they need total darkness, so be sure to cover the 
seeds to a depth of one-quarter inch. 
</P>
<P>
Planters that attach to the railing of an apartment or condo balcony allow 
maximum use of limited space.

SKIP FUCHSIA PAMPERING: PLANT 'EM AND ENJOY 'EM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ELLEN GUFFEY, Mary Ellen Guffey grows hundreds of fuchsias in her 
Malibu garden. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Plant them in the ground and enjoy them," Bill Rietkerk says. 
</P>
<P>
He's the president of the National Fuchsia Society and a champion exhibitor who 
doesn't pamper his fuchsias. Too many people make hard work out of fuchsias, 
surrounding them in a mystique that belies their rugged nature and versatility. 
</P>
<P>
Rietkerk and other fuchsia fanciers will exhibit their prize plants, share 
their expertise and sell special fuchsias this weekend at the NFS Fuchsia Show 
at Descanso Gardens in La Canada Flintridge. At this show, visitors will 
discover some of the latest fuchsia hybrids and rare varieties as well as many 
old favorites rarely available at nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
Once known as "ladies' eardrops" and popular in Victorian gardens, fuchsias 
range from tiny single red and purple blossoms to large, tetraploid specimens 
in hues of violet, coral, cream and mauve. 
</P>
<P>
Rietkerk and his wife, Agnes, also a prize-winning grower, prefer the 
less-demanding varieties with smaller blooms and rugged constitutions. Their 
back yard in Artesia is filled with more than 1,000 fuchsias in pots, some of 
which are being shaped into standards (trees) or trained along wires into rings 
of living blooms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Baskets, Trees, Planters 
</P>
<P>
Fuchsias hang from baskets, drip from trees, shoot up from planters on the 
pavement and spill out from a small corner nursery. Overhead, plastic surah 
cloth and an aging walnut tree provide the filtered light that fuchsias love. 
</P>
<P>
The proportions of Rietkerk's collection and his own personal philosophy 
preclude pampering. The fuchsias in pots are watered only once every two days; 
any that don't make it are lost. Those in the ground require less water. Most 
of his plants are fed with organic pellets (such as GroPower) and a 
slow-release fertilizer (such as Osmocote) in the late fall or early spring 
when they are pruned. 
</P>
<P>
For show plants, he adds liquid doses of a diluted fertilizer (such as Miracle 
Gro). To control pests, notably whitefly, spider mite and fuchsia mite, he 
sprays every two weeks with a mixture of Volck oil (1 tablespoon) and Cooke's 
garden insect spray with thiodan (1 tablespoon per gallon). 
</P>
<P>
Newly purchased plants can be a little temperamental. Fuchsias have to become 
acclimated to new surroundings. Instead of immediately planting a new specimen, 
leave it in its pot and set it where it will be grown. Observe it for a week. 
Let it become accustomed to your microclimate, then plant it in a slightly 
larger container using a light mix (commercial potting soil plus lots of 
perlite). 
</P>
<P>
To plant in the ground, use 1-gallon-size fuchsias. Prepare the soil so that it 
drains well. Add fertilizer and stake the new bush. Some successful varieties 
in the ground are Cardinal, Rocket, Mrs. J. D. Fredericks, Glendale, Nonpareil 
and Voodoo. 
</P>
<P>
Two reasons for the continuing popularity of fuchsias are their long blooming 
period and short propagation period. If you take cuttings now, you can have 
plants in bloom next Christmas. In fact, it's always a good idea to take one or 
two cuttings of a new plant as a safety measure. Select a strong branch, 
preferably without blooms, cut off a 3-inch portion from the tip, remove all 
leaves except two or three at the tip and insert in moist perlite. 
</P>
<P>
Some growers put a plastic bag over the pot to prevent drying out but Rietkerk 
doesn't bother -- and he has hundreds of cuttings that attest to his method. In 
five or six weeks, cuttings are usually ready for potting. 
</P>
<P>
Probably no flowering plant benefits more from pinching than does the fuchsia. 
Pinching out the growing tip forces two, sometimes more branches to emerge, and 
because fuchsias bloom on new growth only, many branches are required to 
produce profuse blooms. Some of the Rietkerks' show plants have more than a 
hundred growing tips, the result of considerable pinching. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Show Competition 
</P>
<P>
The Rietkerks and many other fuchsia enthusiasts will compete for prizes at the 
NFS show this weekend. You can see, in addition to specimen plants, hundreds of 
labeled fuchsia flowers at the bloom display. If you're very lucky, you may get 
to meet America's leading fuchsia hybridizer, Annabelle Stubbs, from Oceanside, 
who has three new introductions this year: Orchid Flame, Pink Parasol and Mary 
Ellen Guffey. 
</P>
<P>
The NFS fuchsia show at Descanso opens to the public at 10 a.m. today, with 
sales of plants from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. today and Sunday. The gardens are 
located at 1418 Descanso Drive, La Canada Flintridge. 
</P>
<P>
For gardeners in the southern area, the South Coast NFS branch will present its 
fuchsia show and sale today and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the South 
Coast Botanic Gardens, 26300 Crenshaw Blvd., Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
If you can't get away this weekend, on June 17-18 the NFS will stage a fuchsia 
show and sale at the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum in Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
Admission to all county gardens is $3 for adults, $1.50 for seniors and 
students with ID and 75 cents for children ages 5-12. To join the National 
Fuchsia Society, send $12 to 15103 McRae St., Norwalk, Calif. 90650.

ETHNIC DEMANDS MAY TEST GORBACHEV HOLD ON UNITY

<P>
Ethnic demands for more independence from Moscow or even full separation from 
the Soviet Union are gaining new legitimacy during fiery debates in the new 
Congress of People's Deputies, and the explosive issue is likely to test 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's ability to hold his country together in coming 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Emboldened by public outcry over the debacle two months ago in the Soviet 
republic of Georgia, when Soviet soldiers killed at least 20 people in 
suppressing a nationalist demonstration, leaders of some of the country's 15 
republics and more than 100 ethnic groups have insisted this week on the floor 
of the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses that they be permitted greater self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the deputies have even called for an examination of the very 
conditions under which their homelands became part of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Official Communist Party media previously said such demands came only from 
"extremist elements," those implied to be anti-social and mentally unbalanced. 
Now, for the first time, millions of people riveted to their television sets 
are hearing independence cries from serious-looking men in suits and ties. 
</P>
<P>
The live broadcasts from the congress' sessions would sweep the ratings if the 
country measured such things, and so the debates over ethnic issues are 
garnering a wide audience and having an enormous influence. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you begin opening up, there is no stopping, really," a senior Western 
diplomat said Friday, commenting on the attention that the assembly's deputies 
have given to issues of nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to dismiss ethnic differences in this vast nation at this point, the 
diplomat said, would be "rather dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
He suggested that one way to defuse tension would be to let the republics and 
autonomous regions have a large measure of self-determination while trying to 
persuade them that their interests would be best served by remaining part of 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, each of the union's republics has the right to secede 
from the Soviet Union and set up its own government. That theoretical right has 
never been put to the test. 
</P>
<P>
But in the last week alone, demands for independence have come from groups as 
diverse as the 100,000 Ingush Muslims living in the Stavropol region in the 
southern Russian republic to the Latvians, Lithuanians and Estonians who have 
insisted on learning the details of a long-secret pact between Adolf Hitler and 
Josef Stalin in 1939 that led to the Soviet annexation of the Baltic republics. 
</P>
<P>
(On Thursday, the congress approved a Kremlin inquiry into the pact, signed by 
German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and his Soviet counterpart, V. 
M. Molotov, in 1939. Although documents related to the pact were destroyed by 
the Nazis, West German Information Minister Hans Klein said Friday that a 
microfilm of the secret protocols has survived and has been inspected by two 
Soviet historians.) 
</P>
<P>
Georgians, Ukrainians and Central Asians also have demanded greater local 
sovereignty. While most are demanding that Moscow loosen the reins of control, 
in one case a shouting match erupted between two deputies representing ethnic 
minorities trying to sort out power between themselves, the Armenians and the 
Azerbaijanis. 
</P>
<P>
The underlying complaint is the same: Ethnic minorities are finally fed up by 
the Soviet policy of slivanie, a Russian word that refers to the effort to 
merge the country's various peoples over the years into one "Soviet man." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the minorities assert that in this effort ethnic Russians, who make up 
just over half of the country's population of 287 million, have traditionally 
displayed a lack of sensitivity to the union's other cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Stalin pursued the merging policy with a particular vigilance. He deported a 
number of non-Russian leaders, restricted the use of minority languages and 
tried to suppress many cultural traditions. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Roy A. Medvedev, a historian recently restored to membership in the 
Communist Party after years of persecution for his accounts of the horrors of 
the Stalin era, drew applause when he told the congress this week that the 
Soviet Union has a history of "failing to respect the rights of small nations." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has sought to douse the flames of passion without appearing to 
belittle the issue. 
</P>
<P>
When he first took over the post as Communist Party leader in 1985 and began a 
drive to reform his country, Gorbachev told delegates in a speech this week, he 
did not fully appreciate the need to review the country's policy toward ethnic 
groups. That led, he said, to "a delay in solving a number of burning 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
One mistake he was probably referring to was his decision to replace a local 
party chief in the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan with a Russian. That 
sparked two days of rioting in the city of Alma Ata in December, 1986, that 
left two people dead and about 200 injured. 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev assured the deputies this week that efforts are now under way to 
hand over greater responsibility to local bodies and that Moscow has recognized 
the "multiformity of national cultures as of great social and historic value." 
</P>
<P>
"We have no right to underestimate, much less lose, any of them," he said, "for 
each is unique." 
</P>
<P>
He offered no specifics, however -- something many deputies will definitely be 
looking for when the lawmaking Supreme Soviet, made up of 542 of the members of 
the congress, begins its work. The difficult task will be to find a formula to 
satisfy heated ethnic demands and still preserve national unity.

RIOT POLICE FORCE DEMONSTRATORS BACK FROM COMMUNIST PARTY HEADQUARTERS

<P>
Thousands of soldiers marched to the edge of Beijing's Tian An Men Square early 
today only to be turned back by protesters, but in midafternoon security forces 
began using tear gas against a crowd outside Communist Party headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of riot police fired tear gas to push back a huge crowd from the gates 
of Zhongnanhai, the Communist Party compound where many leaders live and work, 
witnesses told Western reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Several thousand troops appeared at about the same time outside the nearby 
Great Hall of People facing Tian An Men Square to confront prodemocracy 
protesters, the witnesses added. 
</P>
<P>
The witnesses also said that at least 30 people were beaten by police outside 
the Beijing Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The midafternoon confrontation unfolded after an earlier attempt to move 
soldiers to the square during the predawn hours had failed. 
</P>
<P>
A main column of about 5,000 unarmed soldiers advancing from the east was 
blocked at 3 a.m. by an unyielding crowd of about 8,000 people and a hastily 
assembled barricade of trucks. The soldiers retreated after a brief shoving 
match with the front lines of the protesters just a few hundred yards east of 
the square, which has been occupied for the past three weeks by pro-democracy 
student demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was protecting the students camped in the square, who now number 
about 5,000, and also trying to prevent destruction of a 30-foot-high "Goddess 
of Democracy," modeled after the Statue of Liberty, that was erected in the 
square Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters broke into applause as the sweaty soldiers, looking tired and 
humiliated, silently marched back in the direction from which they came. "An 
enthusiastic send-off!" shouted some in the crowd, made up of both students and 
ordinary Beijing residents. 
</P>
<P>
A similar scene was repeated on the same main street, Changan Avenue, on the 
opposite side of the square. An American television crew reported that 
thousands of people massed around an army truck and several buses near the 
Minzu Hotel, about two miles west of the square. Although most of the troops 
appeared to be unarmed, citizens discovered automatic weapons and clubs inside 
more than one vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Additional troops, some wearing what appeared to be gas masks, had been 
advancing behind the vehicles, United Press International reported. 
</P>
<P>
At least two busloads of troops and an officers' jeep made their way slightly 
closer to the square before being trapped by swarms of protesters, who let the 
air out of the jeep's tires, surrounded the buses and angrily lectured the 
troops that they should not use force against the students gathered in the 
square. 
</P>
<P>
Another group of about 300 soldiers approached the square from the north and 
was trapped by the crowd in a side street just west of the famous Beijing 
Hotel, very near the spot where the main column of troops from the east was 
blocked. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the evening, foreign eyewitnesses shared information about what was 
happening, and many foreign correspondents, including a large number of 
television crews, moved freely through the downtown area. Authorities made 
virtually no effort to enforce martial-law restrictions and rules against press 
coverage imposed Thursday, and journalists thus could piece together a fairly 
broad picture of the night's events. 
</P>
<P>
A young man stood on top of one of the troop buses trapped west of the square 
and shouted to the crowd: "People, rise up!" 
</P>
<P>
"I support it," said a middle-aged man in blue workers' clothes who stood 
beside his bicycle, smiling and laughing at the extraordinary scene. "I simply 
cannot stand to have troops enter the city." 
</P>
<P>
Others in the crowd said they were out in the street because they back the 
students' demands for freedom and democracy. 
</P>
<P>
There were relatively few political chants during the confrontation. But some 
in the crowd shouted, "Li Peng, step down!" in a call for the resignation of 
China's hard-line premier, and one group carried a banner declaring, "Oppose 
martial law!" 
</P>
<P>
Li's resignation and the lifting of martial law, which Li declared on May 20, 
have become the two most immediate demands of the student protests. The 
protests originated in mid-April with demands for freedom of the press, 
improved treatment of intellectuals and an attack on official corruption. 
</P>
<P>
The retreating soldiers appeared bedraggled and demoralized. The Associated 
Press quoted one soldier as saying, "If I'm going to die, I want to die on the 
battlefield, not on Changan Avenue." 
</P>
<P>
The true destination and purpose of the troop advance was not entirely clear. 
It appeared possible that the initial goal of the night-time march could have 
been simply to move the troops into position in secure buildings near the city 
center, rather than immediately confronting the students camped in the square. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the soldiers who came from the east said they had marched all the way 
from suburban Tongxian, about 15 miles outside the city. By dawn, the lead 
members of this group had withdrawn nearly four miles from downtown, but other 
soldiers in the group had stopped and fallen asleep near a subway station only 
about three miles from Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
It also seemed possible that authorities expected to be able to clear the 
square but miscalculated the degree of public resistance. This is what 
apparently happened during the first weekend of martial law, when citizens 
first blocked the army troops on the outskirts of Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the number of citizens in the square after midnight today was unusually 
high because of an incident Friday evening in which a police van or military 
vehicle traveling at excessive speed on the west side of the city ran down 
several pedestrians or bicyclists. Accounts of the incident varied, but it 
appeared that at least one person was killed and three others seriously 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
Many people who were already in the square angrily demonstrating over this 
incident were in the front lines of protesters who blocked the troop movements. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, observers found it hard to believe that whoever ordered the troop 
advance really thought the square could be cleared without violence. 
</P>
<P>
"What the hell did they expect?" commented a Western defense official shortly 
after dawn. "If they send soldiers in unarmed and unprepared, the students are 
going to block them." 
</P>
<P>
This Westerner added, however, that the inability of the army to enforce 
martial law does not necessarily show any incompetence on the part of troops 
and officers, but rather reflects the continuing power struggle and lack of 
political consensus at the top level of the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
The mood among the students in Tian An Men Square as the troops advanced was 
one of quiet tension and determination, mixed with a belief that the army would 
not use violence against them. 
</P>
<P>
"We will stay here and resist with all our strength," said one student after 
the troop advance was reported over student-run loudspeakers. "We will struggle 
for democracy and freedom." 
</P>
<P>
As dawn approached and it became clear that another night would pass without 
the soldiers reaching the square, the loudspeaker in the square began 
broadcasting popular music hits. 
</P>
<P>
"The students are worried, but they're excited, because so many citizens are 
against the soldiers," said a young university instructor who went to the 
square around dawn. 
</P>
<P>
"They're happy," said one of the students camped in the square. "Now there have 
been several attempts like this, and each time the people have blocked the 
soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
This man said that the students are strong because whatever happens now, they 
win -- either by winning concessions leading to democratic reforms, or by being 
suppressed. 
</P>
<P>
"Being suppressed is also victory, because it would show the whole nation that 
the government treats the people as the enemy," he said. "The people would see 
the fearsome face of the government and hate it. The people would understand. . 
. . The students don't care what the government does to them." 
</P>
<P>
Today's pre-dawn events came after the defiant students in Tian An Men Square 
received a boost Friday from a popular singer, Hou Dejian, who together with 
three intellectuals, announced the beginning of another hunger strike in 
support of the demands for greater freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"The students have done everything they could but now they are getting tired 
and they need our help," said Hou, 36, according to a report by Reuters news 
agency. Hou gained fame as a singer in Taiwan, but settled in China several 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Hou will fast for two days and his three colleagues will not eat for three 
days, after which others are expected to replace them, Reuters reported. 
</P>
<P>
A group of about 800 students from the East China city of Nanjing have set off 
on foot in a planned 625-mile march to Beijing in support of protesters here in 
the capital, according to foreigners in Nanjing who spoke by telephone with 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
A loudspeaker announcement in Tian An Men Square said the marchers were 
expected to arrive on June 20, the tentative date for the opening of a session 
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's 
legislature. Students are demanding that the legislative session lift martial 
law and dismiss Li from the premiership. 
</P>
<P>
Friday also was a day of competing government-organized and student protests, 
some of which bordered on street theater of the absurd. 
</P>
<P>
A government-sponsored rally on the outskirts of Beijing took on a sharp 
anti-American tone, with three Chinese men dressed up as Uncle Sam wearing top 
hats emblazoned with the U.S. flag. The intention, apparently, was to imply 
that the United States is behind the student protests. 
</P>
<P>
The protest involved about 10,000 peasants, officials and school children who 
were brought to a sports stadium, United Press International reported. There 
they watched one of the men dressed up as Uncle Sam manipulate a black paper 
heart bearing the name of astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, China's leading dissident. 
Along the rope were tied pieces of white paper marked "American dollars." 
</P>
<P>
UPI reported that the listless and undemonstrative crowd chanted, "Down with 
Fang Lizhi." 
</P>
<P>
Pro-democracy student demonstrators, reaching deeper into a so-far bottomless 
reservoir of innovative ideas, staged a raucous parody of recent 
government-organized demonstrations. About 500 students, some displaying 
swastikas and wearing masks of pigs or demons, staged a march ridiculing 
martial law and chanting, "Oppose Freedom! Oppose Freedom!" 
</P>
<P>
Their antics drew cheers and gales of laughter from onlookers, United Press 
International reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Official profiteering is not a crime. Patriotism -- that's a crime," shouted 
the students in the parody protest. "Support Li Peng. Support Dictatorship. . . 
. Suppress the patriotic students!" 
</P>
<P>
They later bicycled to the offices of the Beijing Daily, where they burned 
copies of the official newspaper to express anger over state-orchestrated 
condemnation of their six-week-old pro-democracy movement, according to reports 
by the Associated Press and Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1. -- A column of about 5,000 white-shirted People's Liberation Army troops 
from the Tongxian area, an eastern Beijing suburb, moved westward on Changan 
Ave. and was stopped by crowds of people in front of the Beijing Hotel. It then 
turned back eastward. 
</P>
<P>
2. -- A group of about 300 troops moving from the north reached the west side 
of the Beijing Hotel, about 100 feet north of Changan Ave., where it was 
blocked by citizens on a side street. 
</P>
<P>
3. -- Hundreds of troops in an army truck and several buses moved from the west 
along Changan Ave. and were blocked by the public near Xidan Street.

STATE HELD LIABLE FOR STRINGFELLOW TOXIC DUMP SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal court jury Friday found the state of California liable to share in 
the estimated $600-million cleanup of the Stringfellow acid pits, concluding 
that the state negligently oversaw construction of the toxic waste dump and 
then delayed taking action to rehabilitate the site. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict, which marks the first time the state has been held liable for 
cleanup of a toxic dump, is likely to mean that taxpayers will bear a large 
portion of the cost of cleaning up the 23-year-old facility near Riverside, 
which is now believed to be leaking dangerous wastes toward a major source of 
drinking water for the Los Angeles basin. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate ruling, a special master appointed to oversee the case also held 
California officials liable for cleanup under the federal Superfund law because 
the state is the current owner and operator of the site. 
</P>
<P>
The two rulings dramatically underscored what has been a longstanding 
contention of companies that trucked their toxic industrial wastes to the Glen 
Avon site throughout the 1950s and 1960s: State officials chose Stringfellow as 
a hazardous waste site after only a cursory geological review, assured 
neighbors that it was safe, invited companies to bring in their wastes -- and 
then attempted to hold them liable when the wastes began leaching into nearby 
water wells. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Unequivocal Success' 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for 14 aerospace and manufacturing companies that dumped at the site, 
who will also be required to pay some share of the cleanup costs, called the 
verdict "a complete, total, unequivocal success in every regard" and predicted 
that the state will now be required to pay most of the bill for reclaiming the 
dump. 
</P>
<P>
"We won everything," said Michael Kahn, the lead counsel for companies that 
dumped at the site. "We believe the implication of today's ruling is the state 
will bear the lion's share, if not all of" of the cleanup costs. 
</P>
<P>
But state officials pointed to other portions of the jury's verdict that held 
that the state was not negligent in choosing the site for the dump, or in 
investigating and designing the facility. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the jury found the state liable on certain other theories, the 
attorney general's office believes that the court's refusal to instruct the 
jury on several statutory defenses was (in) error," Deputy Atty. Gen. Don 
Robinson said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the opinion of the attorney general's office that these defenses would 
have barred any finding of liability against the state on the portion of the 
verdict that dealt with those theories." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson also said the court "failed to follow applicable case law" in its 
directed verdict holding the state liable under the federal Superfund statute, 
but state officials said they had not decided whether to appeal the verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
The six-member jury's verdict Friday was only an interim step in a litigation 
process that has already spanned six years and is likely to go on for many 
years more. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge James M. Ideman has already held that the companies that 
began dumping wastes at Stringfellow in 1956 must share in the cleanup costs 
under the federal Superfund law, simply because they dumped at the site. 
However, that 1987 ruling did not find that any of the companies were legally 
at fault. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the jury's finding that state officials were negligent in supervising 
construction and delaying cleanup activities could weigh heavily against the 
state when a final determination is made on how cleanup costs will be 
apportioned. Lawyers said it is possible that Ideman could ask Special Master 
Harry V. Peetris to conduct another jury trial to decide the apportionment 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Peetris several days earlier had secretly granted a motion holding the state 
liable for cleanup under the federal Superfund law, but his ruling was not 
disclosed publicly until the jury had returned. The jury's verdict and the 
special master's ruling have equal effect. 
</P>
<P>
It was the state that had originally approached rock quarry owner James 
Stringfellow about opening a hazardous waste dump on his property to serve 
burgeoning industrial development throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
60-Minute Survey 
</P>
<P>
A state-appointed geologist surveyed the site and concluded that it was 
underlain by impermeable granite bedrock that would provide a safe repository 
for toxic chemicals. However, the geologist later testified that he had been 
hired only to do "an overview" and had actually spent only about 45 to 60 
minutes investigating the site. 
</P>
<P>
In nearly two months of testimony, lawyers for the so-called "generator" 
companies also argued that state officials delayed doing anything to clean up 
the site for years after Stringfellow closed in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
"For six years, the state fiddled," attorney Barry Goode said. "They studied, 
they talked, they investigated . . . they did everything but clean up the site 
and effectively stop the spread of pollutants." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the "generator" companies, including the Northrop Corp., 
McDonnell Douglas Co., Rockwell International Corp. and a variety of other 
aerospace and manufacturing firms, said that while a number of companies 
throughout the 1950s were illegally dumping their hazardous wastes along the 
highways and in the ocean, the companies that dumped at Stringfellow were 
attempting to comply with the law. 
</P>
<P>
"Our companies were the good citizens," Kahn said. "Our companies called up the 
government and said, 'What should we do with our waste?' And they said, 'Send 
it to Stringfellow.' " 
</P>
<P>
James Stringfellow, now 62, testified that he was forced to move out of 
Riverside, the city in which he had lived for most of his life, because he had 
been blamed for the foul wastes leaching out of his dump site. When his name 
was called for a seat at a restaurant, he said, other customers stared. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been 20 years, a long row to hoe," he said of the verdict. "It's the 
first time that anybody's heard my story. . . . I'm delighted, and that's all I 
can say."

DELEGATES ASSAIL SAKHAROV OVER ATROCITY CHARGE 
</P>

<P>
Andrei D. Sakharov, the Soviet nuclear physicist who won the 1975 Nobel Peace 
Prize for his human rights campaigns, was shouted down in the Soviet Union's 
new assembly Friday as he tried to repeat charges that Moscow's troops had 
committed atrocities during the long war in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
Sakharov, who denounced the nine-year war as a "criminal adventure," was 
attempting to reply to a Soviet veteran of the Afghan war who had angrily 
denied Sakharov's charges. But other members of the Congress of People's 
Deputies began to jeer Sakharov and prevented him from finishing. 
</P>
<P>
"The essence and aims of the irresponsible accusations by Deputy Sakharov are 
far from clear," veteran Sergei Chervonopissky, who lost both of his legs in 
the war, had told the congress, denouncing Sakharov for comments made to a 
Canadian newspaper earlier this year. "We are outraged by his irresponsible and 
provocative assertions." 
</P>
<P>
Chervonopissky's speech brought virtually all the 2,250 deputies, including the 
Communist Party's top leadership, to their feet in several minutes of emotional 
and sustained applause. Then Sakharov came to the podium to defend himself. 
</P>
<P>
As other deputies shouted their disapproval and began clapping their hands and 
stomping their feet in protest, Sakharov recalled how he had been exiled from 
Moscow and forced to live for six years in the industrial city of Gorky. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to cleanse ourselves of this terrible shame," said Sakharov, who was 
clearly shaken by the angry response he drew. "I spoke out against sending 
Soviet soldiers to Afghanistan, and for this I was exiled to Gorky. I am proud 
of that exile, and I wear it like a medal today." 
</P>
<P>
Not a single deputy came to Sakharov's defense as the jeers drove him from the 
podium in the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses where the deputies have been 
meeting for the past 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
"He has opened a very deep wound in our society, a wound that will take a long 
time to heal, and his statements are the same as pouring salt into it," said 
Roy A. Medvedev, a leading Soviet historian who, like Sakharov, was a political 
dissident for many years before his election to the congress. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not defend him because it was not possible to defend him. His statement 
was irresponsible or perhaps naive," Medvedev said. "He is right about that 
war, but he does not understand the conflicting emotions that people feel about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Crimes of the Soviet Army' 
</P>
<P>
Sakharov, 68, told reporters later that his "only regret" was that he had not 
mentioned "all the crimes of the Soviet army in Afghanistan -- the napalm, the 
bombing of schools, hospitals and entire regions." 
</P>
<P>
Sergei Stankevich, a member of the radical "Moscow Group" of deputies, 
commented afterward, "This was the moral lynching of a remarkable man. The war 
was a mistake, it was our national shame." 
</P>
<P>
The furor arose when Chervonopissky, a deputy elected by the Communist Youth 
League, called for the country to honor the Soviet soldiers who served in 
Afghanistan and denounced Sakharov for allegations he had made while touring 
Canada that Soviet helicopter pilots had orders to kill any soldiers they could 
not rescue from probable capture by the moujahedeen, the Muslim rebels fighting 
Afghanistan's government. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union sent troops to Afghanistan in December, 1979, to support the 
Marxist government, and did not withdraw until last February. 
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the soldiers, I say this is not true," Chervonopissky declared. 
</P>
<P>
Sakharov, who has spoken several times to the congress but with diminishing 
effect, tried to defend himself, saying that he had been recounting the 
allegations of others as evidence of the brutality of the war and had called 
for an investigation into the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
"I deeply respect the Soviet army and Soviet soldiers," he told the congress, 
struggling to make himself heard over the shouts of the deputies. "I never 
insulted the heroic Soviet soldiers who served there, but the war itself was a 
criminal adventure and a huge crime by our country that cost the lives of 
almost 1 million Afghans. It was a war of annihilation, a terrible sin." 
</P>
<P>
Sakharov said that the alleged orders to the pilots to kill soldiers threatened 
with capture was still under investigation -- and that he was gathering 
evidence to support it. 
</P>
<P>
"Until that investigation is complete," he said, "no one has the right to call 
me a liar." 
</P>
<P>
But Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, former armed forces chief of staff and now an 
adviser to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said that the charges were "a 
blatant lie." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Such Instruction' 
</P>
<P>
"Neither the General Staff nor the Defense Ministry have issued any order of 
the kind alleged by Academician Sakharov," Akhromeyev said. "We have not 
received any such instruction from our country's political leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"All this is a lie, and Academician Sakharov will not be able to find any 
documents to confirm his lie," Akhromeyev added, using Sakharov's title as a 
member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
Half a dozen other deputies also denounced Sakharov in one of the most 
tumultuous moments in a session that has been marked by heated debates and 
strong emotions. 
</P>
<P>
"With just one step you have canceled all your previous activities," Tursun 
Kazakova from Tashkent in Uzbekistan told Sakharov. "You have insulted our 
entire army, our entire nation, all of our boys who gave their lives. I express 
our common disgust to you."

BUSH BACK IN U.S. IN UPBEAT MOOD, SAYS 'WE MUST GET TO WORK TO END COLD WAR' 
</P>

<P>
President Bush, upbeat but ready for a day off, returned Friday to the United 
States after an eight-day tour of Europe that patched the fraying fabric of the 
Atlantic Alliance and declared: "We must get to work now to end the Cold War." 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the sunny finale of the NATO summit in Brussels, and his quick 
follow-up stops in Bonn and London, Bush told a welcoming crowd at Pease Air 
Force Base in Portsmouth, N.H., that "we are ready to help shape a new world." 
</P>
<P>
Returning with what he said was "a message of hope" at a time of ferment in the 
Soviet Bloc, the President said: "We have a great and historic opportunity to 
shape the changes that are transforming Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Working with our allies in Europe, we set a course for the future," he said. 
"And we must move to fulfill that promise, moving beyond containment, moving 
beyond the era of conflict and Cold War that the world has known for more than 
40 years, because keeping the peace in Europe means keeping the peace for 
America. Our alliance seeks a less militarized Europe -- a safer world for all 
of us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Note of Caution 
</P>
<P>
With the President and his senior aides unanimous in their assessment of the 
summit's success -- and a parade of senior officials marching aft on Air Force 
One to recount to reporters the moments of summit triumphs -- the only note of 
caution was sounded by Brent Scowcroft, Bush's assistant for national security 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One as the President flew from London 
to New Hampshire, Scowcroft replied with a tart "no" when asked whether the 
Soviets could be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the President's proposal to reduce the conventional, or 
non-nuclear, military forces of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact and the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization "is not built on trust," which he said "is the 
last thing that comes between opposing sides." 
</P>
<P>
Rather, Scowcroft said, such an arms reduction agreement "is built on mutual 
self-interest. We trust in their self-interest." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cuts in Forces 
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, Bush won NATO approval for a proposal that East and West agree to 
equal levels of military personnel, combat planes, helicopters, tanks and 
personnel carriers in Europe. The levels specified by Bush would bring deep 
cuts in Warsaw Pact forces, lesser cuts on the part of the Atlantic Alliance -- 
which maintains fewer troops in Europe -- and would, Bush said, "transform the 
military map of Europe." 
</P>
<P>
While Bush told reporters Friday that he had not yet received a response from 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze has described the proposal's limits on Western forces as "a 
serious step in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft said the Administration views the Soviets' initial reaction as "very 
encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
In his own conversation with reporters aboard the aircraft, Bush said he is 
"determined to kick our bureaucracy and the NATO bureaucracy as best I can" to 
flesh out his conventional arms proposal. He has said he would like to see an 
agreement negotiated within six months to a year and put into effect by 1992 or 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
The trip had been viewed in Europe and the United States with some trepidation 
before it began, out of concern that differences over the future role of 
short-range nuclear weapons in Europe could play havoc with allied unity. But 
its upbeat finish, stemming from support for the President's conventional arms 
control proposal, left the entire Administration team proclaiming the Atlantic 
Alliance in better shape than at any point in its past 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
"In this period of historic change, the NATO alliance has never been more 
united, never been stronger," Bush said in his remarks at the air force base. 
"The summit was a triumph for the alliance, a triumph of ideas, and most of 
all, it was a triumph of hope. 
</P>
<P>
"While keeping our defenses up and our eyes wide open, we must go forward," he 
said. "We must stay on the offensive. We must get to work now to end the Cold 
War." 
</P>
<P>
As for Bush's own well-being, political and physical, there is always a 
tendency to credit a President after a successful foreign trip with a handful 
of political points to be cashed in at home -- and a need to relax after the 
grueling pace of the journey. 
</P>
<P>
So, he was asked as he was about to land, did he think he gained in respect 
back in the United States? 
</P>
<P>
"You mean along like Rodney Dangerfield kind of thing?" he jested with 
reporters. "I've not suffered from lack of respect. These fellows have all been 
very pleasant. Haven't you guys? Thank you very much." 
</P>
<P>
As for the fatigue of the four-nation tour, the President confessed when asked 
how he felt, "Feel pretty good. Feel pretty good. Can't wait to take a day 
off." 
</P>
<P>
So, hours after arriving home from London, he headed out into the Atlantic 
aboard his boat, cast a fishing line into the chilly waters, and came up with a 
mackerel.

A Soviet satellite booster rocket re-entered the atmosphere over the 
U.S.-Canadian border with no sign that any debris reached the ground, the State 
Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet news agency Tass reported the launch Wednesday and said in a later 
dispatch that the third stage of the Proton rocket booster, which had put three 
satellites into orbit, descended over the border just north of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
There was "no indication that any debris of any kind hit the ground," State 
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. He said the descent of such boosters 
occurs routinely and that they usually burn up in the atmosphere before 
reaching the ground.

50 ETHNIC ALBANIANS ARRESTED IN SOUTHERN YUGOSLAVIA UNREST

More than 50 ethnic Albanians were jailed for up to 60 days after this week's 
unrest in the southern Yugoslav province of Kosovo, the official Tanjug news 
agency said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
One foreign student at Kosovo's Pristina University said he had seen police 
seize at least 10 students in Wednesday's unrest. He said he and other 
students, counting their numbers later, concluded that at least 50 more had 
been detained. 
</P>
<P>
"Police in riot gear stormed through the dormitory, kicking down doors and 
firing tear gas canisters through the hallways," he said. "Some students were 
dragged out of their rooms." 
</P>
<P>
Security in Kosovo was increased after police shot dead an ethnic Albanian on 
Tuesday in the town of Podujevo, and hundreds of students demonstrated in a 
revival of protests that resulted in the deaths of 24 people in March. 
</P>
<P>
The Albanians were protesting curbs on their political autonomy imposed by 
Serbia, the biggest of Yugoslavia's six republics. 
</P>
<P>
Police were stationed at crossroads leading into Pristina on Friday, and 
armored vehicles were parked on the outskirts. 
</P>
<P>
A police official said the hunt was still on for 12 to 15 Albanians who engaged 
police Tuesday in a gun battle near Podujevo. An ethnic Albanian police 
commander was shot dead in Podujevo in the March unrest. 
</P>
<P>
"We suspect this group was involved in the March events in Podujevo," the 
official said.

<P>
A stern moralist in the Land of the Midnight Sun, Pope John Paul II cautioned 
the rich, secular societies Friday that mankind is more important than machines 
and spirit more valuable than substance. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul's arrival here at the Arctic tip of Europe -- latitude 69 degrees, 40 
minutes north -- in nighttime daylight earned a modest footnote in the list of 
firsts by history's most traveled pontiff: Never before had a Pope traveled 
north of the Arctic Circle. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it here," the Pope told Norwegian interviewers on the second day of a 
10-day swing through the five Nordic countries. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul came to Tromso to call on 621 Catholics, 30 nuns, eight priests and 
one bishop who represent his church in the chill northern fastness. 
</P>
<P>
"As Christians we proclaim a wisdom that recognizes and upholds the priority of 
ethics over technology, the primacy of the person over things, the superiority 
of spirit over matter," the Pope said in an address issued en route to Tromso. 
</P>
<P>
In this "top-of-the-world" fishing and tourist port that is the traditional 
jumping-off point for expeditions to the North Pole 1,375 miles away, John Paul 
led a vesper service at light-as-noon 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The sun, which never sets here at this time of the year, tried mightily to 
break through stratus clouds as the overcoated Pope addressed a festive 
leather-jacket-and-gloves crowd of several thousand in the town's main square. 
</P>
<P>
"(We are) gathered this evening in the long bright twilight of the north, in 
the light of the unsetting sun which so clearly symbolizes Christ, the light of 
the world, who is the same yesterday, today and forever," said a Pope obviously 
enjoying himself. 
</P>
<P>
In the prayer service structured as a papal analysis of the Lord's Prayer, John 
Paul hailed scientific and technological advances that "have dispelled many of 
our fears," but he warned against "the temptation to decide for ourselves what 
is good and evil without reference to the God who made us." 
</P>
<P>
Norway, flush with oil, has one of the highest standards of living in Europe. 
All but a handful of the 4.2 million Norwegians are nominal Lutherans, but few 
practice their faith in a liberal, socialist society. 
</P>
<P>
En route north from Oslo, the Pope spent most of the day in Trondheim, the 
third-largest city in Norway and the birthplace of Norwegian Christianity a 
millennium ago. In a white-robed Mass for central Norway's 1,704 Catholics, he 
distributed first communion to schoolchildren at a state technical university. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Norway's Patron Saint 
</P>
<P>
Formerly Norway's capital, Trondheim, which sits at the mouth of an inviting 
fjord, was home of 11th-Century King Olav II, who is patron saint of both 
Norway's Catholics and Lutherans. The old king's bones once rested inside a 
then-Catholic and now-Lutheran cathedral where the Pope prayed in an ecumenical 
service Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Symbol of historic Lutheran-Catholic hatreds in Norway, Olav's bones were 
stolen during the Reformation and haven't been seen since. Where Olav lies 
today is a Great Norwegian Mystery, although folks in Trondheim, not an 
excitable lot, don't seem to talk much about it any more. 
</P>
<P>
At Trondheim's copper-spired, Gothic Nindaros Cathedral, last rebuilt earlier 
this century, John Paul told his Lutheran interlocutors that "before us lies 
the duty of opening a new Christian chapter in history." Only four of Norway's 
11 Lutheran bishops attended the service, packed with more than 2,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Norwegians in a nationally televised address, the Pope cautioned 
that "science and technology, like the economic life that they generate, cannot 
of themselves articulate the meaning of existence or of human striving. They 
cannot of themselves explain, much less eliminate, evil, suffering and death." 
</P>
<P>
Traditions of community, home and family are being undermined today, the Pope 
warned, "by transformations which do not always acknowledge the ethical 
dimension inherent in all human activity and endeavor." 
</P>
<P>
"We wish to be free, but unless there is common understanding of what we ought 
to do, and not simply what we can do, freedom ends in the tyranny of 
selfishness and superior force," the Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul flies this morning from Norway to Iceland on the third day of his 
Nordic pilgrimage -- the 42nd voyage of his reign -- that will also take him to 
Finland, Denmark and Sweden.

<P>
A beleaguered Sosuke Uno was elected Japanese prime minister Friday, and he 
named a relatively youthful Cabinet and ruling party lineup described as purged 
of soiled strongmen and pledged to reform. 
</P>
<P>
Public distrust of politicians, disgruntlement over a 3% consumption tax, new 
party disunity, his own ties to scandal-tainted former Prime Minister Yasuhiro 
Nakasone and trade frictions with the United States give Uno a tough agenda. 
And he ran into snags immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Two of those newly appointed by Uno, a former Nakasone lieutenant who was 
foreign minister until Parliament elected him to the premiership, admitted at 
their first news conferences that they had received or signed receipts for 
small sums in political contributions from Recruit Co., whose $7.7 million 
worth of favors toppled the government of Noboru Takeshita. 
</P>
<P>
Uno also failed to find an appointee for vice president of the ruling Liberal 
Democratic Party, a post that Takeshita faction leaders had agreed would be 
responsible for carrying out political reform. The post was left unfilled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposition Vote Split 
</P>
<P>
Uno, who was attacked by rebels at a party caucus as a "secret room" appointee, 
handily won election as prime minister in the lower house of Parliament by a 
285-192 vote. Four opposition candidates split the votes against him. The party 
caucus earlier in the day had chosen him to fill the remainder of Takeshita's 
term as party president. The term ends Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Uno, 66, named a Cabinet of 20 ministers whose average age is 59 1/2 years -- 
youngest in the party's 34-year history. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet retained both of Takeshita's key economic aides. Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, 
however, dropped his portfolio at the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry to replace Uno as foreign minister, while Tatsuo Murayama stayed on as 
finance minister. 
</P>
<P>
Both Mitsuzuka and Uno have harshly criticized the United States for branding 
Japan "an unfair trading nation." 
</P>
<P>
Named to head the Defense Agency was a junior member of the upper house of 
Parliament, Taku Yamasaki, 52. 
</P>
<P>
Absent from the new Cabinet were all of the ruling party's strongmen, who were 
tainted in the Recruit scandal. A party reform committee barred them from 
holding any major post for a year. 
</P>
<P>
Uno is the first Liberal Democratic prime minister without a power base of his 
own since the party was formed in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
The new prime minister carefully dispensed Cabinet and party posts evenly among 
the four major factions that control power in the party. He also went out of 
his way to placate one of his severest critics, former Prime Minister Takeo 
Fukuda, 84, by naming a close Fukuda associate, Masajuro Shiokawa, 67, as chief 
Cabinet secretary. The post corresponds to that of the President's chief of 
staff in the White House, but its occupant here holds Cabinet rank. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$7,000 Contribution 
</P>
<P>
Shiokawa admitted at his first news conference that he had signed a receipt for 
a Recruit contribution of $7,000 to another politician. Ryutaro Hashimoto, 51, 
named to the ruling party's No. 2 post as secretary general, acknowledged 
receiving nearly $17,000 in Recruit contributions. 
</P>
<P>
The Asahi newspaper also reported that the chairman of one of Uno's own 
supporters' associations had received Recruit stock preferentially. But in this 
case, the information and real estate conglomerate appeared less interested in 
Uno than in the association chairman, who was Yoshimi Mizukami, chairman of 
Haseco, one of Japan's largest construction firms. 
</P>
<P>
Mizukami, an influential businessman, told Asahi he would resign as chairman of 
the Uno supporters' group "to clear up any misunderstanding." 
</P>
<P>
Mass media, including Asahi, gave minor attention to the disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
Uno pledged to "restore people's faith" in politics and the Liberal Democratic 
Party by implementing the party's plan for political reform. 
</P>
<P>
"This includes party reform, electoral reform and parliamentary reform, as well 
as doing away with the factions" that control the power in the ruling party, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Widely regarded as a pinch hitter, Uno theoretically could serve as prime 
minister until Parliament's lower house is dissolved for a general election. 
That ballot must be held by July, 1990, when the present term of the powerful 
lower house expires. 
</P>
<P>
Already, party critics have declared that they will seek Uno's ouster if he 
fails to lead the Liberal Democrats to victory in an upper house election July 
23. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that as foreign 
minister, Uno had developed a close relationship with President Bush, Secretary 
of State James A. Baker III and many other U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Uno is a distinguished and experienced international 
statesman," Boucher said at a news briefing. "We look forward to working with 
him and the new Japanese Cabinet on the challenges that our two countries face 
in the period ahead."

IN SENEGAL AND MAURITANIA, ETHNIC CONFLICT RAGES AMID TALK OF WAR

DAKAR, Senegal 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For as long as anyone can remember, the so-called white Moors from neighboring 
Mauritania sold engraved silver jewelry and ornate wooden lockboxes in a 
tree-shaded marketplace near the center of this West African capital. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the Courtyard of the Moors, as the marketplace is called, is 
deserted except for a few scavengers sifting through the dirt and debris for 
valuables buried or dropped by the Moors, who not long ago departed hastily in 
the face of angry Senegalese mobs. 
</P>
<P>
In Mauritania, the vast desert country to the north, black Africans, mainly 
from Senegal, were until recently the fishermen, skilled workmen and a key part 
of the professional-intellectual class of that country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thousands Deported Back 
</P>
<P>
But as a result of one of those violent, ethnically based population expulsions 
that have characterized the history of post-colonial Africa, thousands of 
blacks have been deported back here to Senegal, even though many came from 
families that had lived for generations in Mauritania. 
</P>
<P>
In all, a Western diplomat here estimates, as many as 170,000 people have in 
recent weeks been caught up in this massive population shift between the two 
countries. More than 250 people have been killed in violence, on both sides of 
the border. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Senegalese and Mauritanian armies are poised on opposite banks 
of the Senegal River, which forms the border. 
</P>
<P>
Mauritania is prepared for war, that nation's minister of the interior, Djibril 
Ould Abdellahi, warned the other day, "if Senegal starts it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Do Not Want War' 
</P>
<P>
The next day, President Abdou Diouf of Senegal told a press conference in 
Dakar, "There are problems, serious problems, but we do not want war, and I 
don't think they do, either." 
</P>
<P>
The war talk put a damper on a conference of French-speaking nations in Dakar 
last week that was attended by President Francois Mitterrand of France, Prime 
Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada and a dozen other national leaders, mainly 
African. 
</P>
<P>
While the conference was in progress, Mauritania recalled its ambassador to 
Senegal. Senegalese newspapers alternated articles about Francophonic 
brotherhood with tales of atrocities committed by its French-speaking 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
A Dakar opposition party newspaper ran an article, under the headline "When the 
Blood Flowed Into the Sea," that reported a slaughter last month of black 
fishermen in Mauritania. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat 
made surprise visits to both Mauritania and Senegal to ease tension in the 
conflict. After meeting with Mauritanian President Sid Ahmed Ould Taya, Arafat 
told reporters:"We will contribute modestly to find a solution to the tragic 
events which have strained relations between our Mauritanian and Senegalese 
brothers." 
</P>
<P>
The Mauritania-Senegal conflict, the growing divisions between black Africa and 
the Arab region known as the Maghreb, and to a lesser extent tribal battles 
such as those between the Tutsis and the Hutus in the former Belgian colony of 
Burundi, diminish Mitterrand's vision of restoring the French language as a 
glue to hold the old colonies together. And they make it clear that the glue is 
not holding. 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand attempted to make peace at the conference -- and demonstrate 
France's lingering influence in Western Africa -- by sending Foreign Minister 
Roland Dumas to Nouakchott, the Mauritanian capital. But Dumas returned 
empty-handed after meeting with Taya, who is also secretary general of the 
Military Committee for National Salvation, which actually governs the country. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts at mediation by Mali's interior minister, Col. Issa Ongoiba, at the 
behest of the Organization of African Unity, likewise produced no results. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the third summit conference of French-speaking countries -- the 
first in a Third World country -- echoed with bellicosity and charges of 
racism. 
</P>
<P>
"It is simply a question of the color of a man's skin; we are black," said 
Niang Modiane, 43, a petroleum chemist who is among the deported black Africans 
from Mauritania who are sheltered temporarily at an army post outside Dakar. 
</P>
<P>
But in multi-ethnic, multi-sect, multi-tribal Africa, nothing is ever quite 
that simple. In fact, many blacks remain in Mauritania, and some continue in 
high government posts. These are the Haratines, the so-called black Moors, 
descendants of slaves who have been assimilated into the Arab culture. 
</P>
<P>
Approximately one-third of the 2 million Mauritanians are of Arab-Berber 
extraction (white Moors), another third are Haratines while the remaining third 
are black Africans descended mainly from tribes found in Senegal. 
</P>
<P>
Over a period of decades beginning at the turn of the century, under colonial 
rule, the French installed black Africans in key administrative posts in 
Mauritania. Since independence in 1960, Mauritanian politics have been 
characterized by the ruling white Moors' effort to limit the influence in 
government of the black Africans left in place by the French. 
</P>
<P>
This has been done mainly by instituting quotas -- now 20% -- on the number of 
black Africans allowed to serve in government, and by such other acts as 
introducing Arabic as an official language along with French. Arabic is spoken 
by many white Moors but not by many black Africans. 
</P>
<P>
Mauritania is viewed by the Senegalese and other black Africans as one of the 
desert buffer states between them and Arab North Africa. As a result, many see 
the recent events here in the context of an Arab push against black Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mauritanian regime has an objective," said the refugee chemist Modiane, 
who is housed along with 2,700 other black Africans expelled from Mauritania in 
Quonset hut warehouses at Camp Oakam. "It is the conquest of political, 
economic and cultural lives. To do this they must first expel the black African 
intellectuals, who are capable of stopping them from realizing their design." 
</P>
<P>
The Mauritanian government recently added fuel to this fear of Arabization by 
joining Algeria, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia in a new alliance of North African 
countries, the Union of the Great Arab Maghreb. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling here in Senegal," a Western diplomat said, "is that Mauritanians 
are moving more and more toward the Arabization of their country -- that they 
are becoming more and more a community of the Maghreb." 
</P>
<P>
However, some political observers here feel that the true root of the conflict 
between the two formerly friendly countries is competition for land in the 
Senegal River Valley, which has been opened to irrigation by construction of 
two dams at a cost of $1 billion. One of the dams is in the adjacent country of 
Mali; the other at Djama on the Senegal-Mauritania border. 
</P>
<P>
The two dams have assumed great significance in the political life of Senegal 
and Mauritania and have created a catchword -- apres barrage (after the dam) -- 
that describes today's political setting. But the dams, rather than enhancing 
relations between the two countries, have raised the stakes in the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the competition for land, a Western diplomat said: "The issue is 
even more complicated because traditionally Senegalese farmers have worked on 
the Mauritanian side of the river. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diouf Aided by War Talk 
</P>
<P>
In Senegal, which has enjoyed a measure of democratic freedom rare among 
African states, internal political considerations have contributed to the 
atmosphere of war. The war talk has rallied support behind President Diouf, who 
was reelected last year and has been at the center of what one observer 
described as "more than a year of contentious political debate including lots 
of street demonstrations." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the Diouf government has been accused of being too soft 
with Mauritania. 
</P>
<P>
"War would be popular here, from the common man to the highest level of 
government," a Western diplomat observed. 
</P>
<P>
But waging war would be difficult for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Senegal, the more populous of the two with 6.7 million people, is estimated to 
have 10,000 men under arms but traditionally has depended for protection on 
2,000 French soldiers in the country. Mauritania, with its 2 million people, is 
much larger in terms of territory and less dependent on the French. Its army's 
strength is estimated at 14,000. 
</P>
<P>
Neither country has a strong air force nor the equipment needed to cross the 
Senegal River without huge losses. As a result, many observers doubt that the 
recent hostilities will erupt into full-scale war. More likely, they say, are 
continued skirmishes along the river. 
</P>
<P>
The incident that sparked the recent violence and population flight took place 
April 9 in Diawara, a small river town near Bakel in eastern Senegal. According 
to Senegalese officials, two Senegalese were shot and killed by Mauritanian 
border guards. The Mauritanians say the deaths were the result of tribal 
fighting in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly coincidentally, Senegalese newspapers began publishing detailed 
reports of conflicts along the border, including the jailing of some tribesmen 
by Mauritanian officials. Traditionally, Senegalese have farmed on both sides 
of the river and there has always been some conflict. But until recently little 
of this had been reported in the press. 
</P>
<P>
After the April 9 killings, several Mauritanian shops were attacked in Dakar. 
About 80% of the grocery stores and other small shops in Dakar were owned at 
that time by Mauritanians who sold on credit and slept in their stores to be 
available to customers at all hours. 
</P>
<P>
After the attacks in Dakar, counterattacks were undertaken against black 
Africans in Mauritania. Matters escalated until both governments were forced to 
impose a curfew. On the Senegalese side, there were at least 70 deaths, mostly 
in the white Moor communities. In Mauritania, the death toll was believed to be 
higher -- more than 200, almost all of them African blacks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Airlifted Out 
</P>
<P>
In the resulting panic, tens of thousands of refugees were airlifted out of the 
two countries. Between 80,000 and 100,000 Mauritanians were expelled from 
Senegal, and at least 70,000 Senegalese and other blacks were expelled from 
Mauritania. 
</P>
<P>
A typical case was that of a black African from Mauritania who had worked in a 
refinery at Nouadhibou, the Mauritanian port and industrial center on the 
border with Morocco. Interviewed at the Oakam army post, he asked that his name 
not be used because of possible danger to his wife and seven children who 
stayed behind. 
</P>
<P>
"On the eighth of May," he said, "I worked the night at the refinery. When I 
came home, they arrested me without telling me why. They took me here on an 
airplane and left my wife, sister-in-law and seven children there. I have no 
idea where they are now." 
</P>
<P>
The economic impact of the deportations is severe in both countries, although 
perhaps greater in Mauritania, where the black Africans were a crucial element 
in society. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mauritanian economy simply cannot exist without some other kind of skilled 
labor, particularly in the fishing industry, health care area and clerical 
work, being imported to replace the people who left," said a Western observer 
who knows both countries well. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, in Senegal, the sudden departure of the Mauritanian shopkeepers, 
mainly grocers in villages and the residential areas of Dakar, caused food 
shortages for several weeks. In the capital almost every block has a store left 
empty by fleeing Mauritanians. 
</P>
<P>
"We Mauritanians have a genius for commerce," said one of the several junior 
Mauritanian diplomats remaining in Dakar after the recall of the ambassador 
last week. "There are some Senegalese villages with 10,000 people living there 
but with no roads leading in. In the center of these towns you will find a 
Mauritanian petit commercient, his shelves full of goods." 
</P>
<P>
The recent violence against Mauritanian shopkeepers sent a shiver of fear 
through another Arab minority here -- the estimated 28,000 Lebanese 
shopkeepers, whose forebears for the most part migrated here at the turn of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a lot of xenophobia in Senegal," said Hassan Ibrahim, 33, owner 
of a small carpet shop near the Courtyard of the Moors. "We are afraid the 
Lebanese are the next victims."

A member of the Senate Armed Services Committee on Friday suggested reducing 
U.S. forces stationed in South Korea and requiring Tokyo to foot the full bill 
for keeping American troops in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States can no longer sustain a disproportionate burden of 
maintaining a common defense for the free world," said Sen. Carl Levin 
(D-Mich). He is chairman of the Armed Services subcommittee on conventional 
forces and alliance defense. 
</P>
<P>
Levin said in an interview with reporters that he will make his proposals in 
the form of a "sense of the Senate" resolution that reflects the Senate's 
sentiment but has no legal authority. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Levin is proposing that the Bush Administration discuss with 
South Korea a timetable "for a mutually acceptable . . . partial reduction of 
our forces" and a plan to replace the U.S. commander who has operational 
control over Korean forces with a South Korean general. 
</P>
<P>
Levin estimated that the 43,000 U.S. troops in South Korea could be reduced to 
about 10,000.

S. AFRICA HANGINGS PROMPT NEW DEATH PENALTY OUTCRY

Four people, including a 22-year-old woman, were hanged in South Africa on 
Friday, provoking fresh calls from church and civil rights groups for an end to 
the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
A Justice Ministry spokesman said that the four, all convicted murderers, were 
sent to the gallows inside Pretoria Central Prison at dawn. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first execution of a woman in more than two years in South Africa, 
which the London-based human rights organization Amnesty International says has 
the world's third-highest official execution rate after Iran and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Three more prisoners at Pretoria -- the site of South Africa's only gallows -- 
have been told they will hang next week. This will bring the number of 
executions so far this year to 33, according to Lawyers for Human Rights. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the lawyers, a Pretoria-based civil rights group, said they 
were puzzled about the recent surge in executions at a time when a national 
anti-hanging lobby is gaining strength. "People are being notified of their 
executions at an unprecedented rate. It is a tragic trend," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But support for our work is gaining all the time. We hope to succeed soon in 
convincing the government that capital punishment is barbaric." he added. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the first two months of this year, when there were only two 
hangings, the execution rate for 1989 is now close to the average of 10 a month 
that has been maintained for most of the decade, according to the lawyers 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a bomb damaged the home of a top South African Indian politician 
Friday morning as his three sons and 80-year-old mother slept inside, but no 
one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Boetie Abrahamjee, chairman of the Indian house of delegates in South Africa's 
segregated three-chamber Parliament, was visiting Britain at the time of the 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the explosion was caused by a limpet mine planted about 20 yards 
from the security wall of the house in an Indian suburb outside Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
The attack on Abrahamjee's house was the second within a month on the home of a 
politician. On May 7 a bomb damaged the home of a white member of Parliament in 
Krugersdorp.

The large wallposters, the marches and chants, the fists in the air are all 
familiar to Guo, a frustrated engineer turned second-hand clothes salesman and 
a veteran of a failed attempt to alter China's political system. 
</P>
<P>
Guo, 42, views the current democracy effort in Beijing as unfinished business 
-- and perhaps a kind of vindication for activists like himself who once tried 
to push political reform early in post-Mao China. 
</P>
<P>
Guo participated in the 1979 Democracy Wall campaign, which, like the current 
Beijing spring, seemed poised to upset China's seemingly unshakable Communist 
Party Establishment. But he is not taking part in the youthful and so-far 
short-lived Cantonese version of Beijing's pro-democracy agitation. His last 
experience, 10 years ago, was painful, and he views this one as being too risky 
for him to go out on the streets again. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the new generation's turn," Guo told a reporter visiting his shabby 
apartment in a monotonous block of low buildings on Canton's south side. "I 
hope they have better luck. But sometimes, we seem to be like a flea riding an 
elephant." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pasted-Up Demands 
</P>
<P>
Democracy Wall got its name from a block-long stretch of wall on Changan 
Avenue, Beijing's main east-west boulevard, where activists pasted up their 
demands and denunciations of human rights abuses to be read and debated by 
eager passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
The movement was initially urged on by Deng Xiaoping, China's aging top leader, 
who at the time was locked in a power struggle with Maoist conservatives who 
opposed his plans for a more market-oriented economy. 
</P>
<P>
The enthusiasm and spread of the Democracy Wall movement to other parts of 
China helped Deng oust his rivals in China's ruling circle. But once he was 
securely in charge, Deng labeled the democracy activists reactionary and 
anarchistic. Important leaders of the movement were put on trial and jailed. 
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, the best-known victim of the crackdown was a young electrician 
named Wei Jingsheng; in Canton, it was Wang Xizhi, a worker in a cod liver oil 
factory. Both are still imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
Guo, who claimed no greater role for himself in the Democracy Wall activity 
than as a street organizer, was arrested and jailed for six months. He is not 
surprised that Deng is leading a campaign against the new wave of pro-democracy 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strengths, Weaknesses 
</P>
<P>
"Deng Xiaoping took the movement he created and turned it upside down. Why 
should he not oppose a movement that he has nothing to do with?" Guo asked. 
</P>
<P>
Guo views the new democracy agitation as having certain strengths that the 
Democracy Wall movement lacked -- and certain weaknesses that have so far kept 
it relatively confined. 
</P>
<P>
In Canton, for instance, the pro-democracy movement has produced only two major 
demonstrations, and students have now returned to classes, awaiting the outcome 
in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"The students in Beijing are very brave. I am amazed at what they do openly," 
Guo said. "The students are smart. Maybe this is why they have been able to go 
so far. They are intellectuals, the best of the country. They are not like us. 
We were crippled by lack of education, and no one felt we had to be preserved 
for the country's future." 
</P>
<P>
During the Democracy Wall era, Guo worked in a foundry. His formal education, 
like that of millions of others, had been mangled by the turmoil of the 
Cultural Revolution, when young Red Guards, urged on by competing political 
factions, took to the streets for almost a decade. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, many of today's Beijing protesters are the product of the newly 
competitive and upgraded Chinese educational system, which for the past 15 
years has known relative stability. 
</P>
<P>
Guo makes a living buying clothes from a cousin in Hong Kong and selling them 
in the crowded street markets in Canton, which, under China's open economic 
policies, is a city of impressive hustle. 
</P>
<P>
In his tiny apartment, a few remnants of the heyday of Democracy Wall decorate 
the dingy walls: a photograph of a march, another of Wang Xizhi together with 
French reporters, a scrap of a poster with the characters for "freedom." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stirring Moments 
</P>
<P>
He recalled stirring moments even in defeat, especially the famous tract on 
Marxism and democracy that was posted in Canton by Wang and his comrades as 
well as the self-defense of Wei Jingsheng in court. Wei gave a stirring lecture 
to the court on the rights of the Chinese under the law. 
</P>
<P>
"The Goddess of Democracy is attracting attention," Guo said, in reference to 
the Styrofoam-and-plaster statue erected by art students in Beijing's Tian An 
Men Square. "But I don't know exactly what the students want. Is it enough to 
say down with the leadership?" 
</P>
<P>
Guo noted that the demonstrations in Canton, which ended last week, were mere 
reactions to the Beijing turmoil. "They could not stand on their own for lack 
of ideas," Guo said of the local students. 
</P>
<P>
"We, on the other hand, were believers in communism. I was a Red Guard. We 
believed in the ideals of equality and in the socialist system," he continued, 
his voice rising with what seemed like an echo of an earlier fervor. 
</P>
<P>
He sat back in his chair and reconsidered. "We tried to work within the system. 
We were always asking the Communist Party to reform itself. These new students 
seem not to care at all about the party. Perhaps they are right. Caring about 
the Communist Party did not save us at Democracy Wall."

BRAZIL OPPOSES STATE DEPT. OFFICIAL AS NEW U.S. ENVOY

The possibility that Richard Melton, a State Department official with a 
conservative reputation, may be named ambassador to Brazil is raising waves of 
resistance in Latin America's largest country. 
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian Foreign Ministry is making it clear that it would prefer someone 
other than Melton to succeed Ambassador Harry W. Shlaudeman, who recently 
finished his assignment in Brazil. A report in the national newspaper Gazeta 
Mercantil said the ministry is resisting Melton's appointment because of his 
"turbulent professional background." 
</P>
<P>
The issue has been headline news this week in Brazilian newspapers, and it adds 
a note of friction to U.S.-Brazilian relations, which currently are troubled by 
trade disputes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unprecedented Step 
</P>
<P>
"Melton Case Could Provoke a Crisis in Relations With Washington," said a 
headline in the daily Folha de Sao Paulo. If the government accepts Melton, it 
will face "the onus of domestic criticism," but to reject him would be an 
unprecedented step, the newspaper commented. 
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Zarattini, a congressional aide who belongs to the Brazilian Communist 
Party, accused Melton this week of interrogating him in 1968 when he was being 
held by political police and Melton was a U.S. consular officer in the 
northeastern city of Recife. Melton, now in Washington, has said he recalls no 
such incident. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, as ambassador to Nicaragua, Melton was expelled by the Sandinista 
government, which accused him of conspiring with oppositionists. Nicaraguan 
authorities said they had uncovered an alleged "Plan Melton" to destabilize the 
leftist government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consent Requested 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Melton is deputy assistant secretary of state for Central America. 
Brazil's civilian government has been critical of U.S. policy in Central 
America, insisting on the principle of nonintervention. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Zuckerman, public affairs officer for the U.S. Embassy in Brasilia, did 
not deny Brazilian press reports that the United States had requested Brazil's 
prior consent, or agrement, for Melton's nomination. But Zuckerman said: "We 
don't have any comment on the question of whether he is the 
ambassador-designate. That is never discussed pending agrement." 
</P>
<P>
He did say that Melton has denied ever having heard the name of congressional 
aide Zarattini, and that Melton does not recall any involvement in the 
interrogation of a Brazilian political prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Brazilian foreign minister, Zarattini said the police 
allowed Melton to interrogate him two weeks after Zarattini's arrest in 
December, 1968, by the military government then in power. 
</P>
<P>
According to the letter, Melton asked Zarattini why he was against the United 
States, and he replied: "I said I was against the exploitation of imperialist 
monopolies (multinationals) given cover by the government of the U.S.A." 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the Brazilian government does not abdicate its sovereignty and does not 
grant agrement to that pseudo-ambassador, a member of the intelligence service 
of the U.S.A.," Zarrattini said in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
Zarattini, a longtime member of the Communist Party, is administrative 
assistant to Congressman Moema San Thiago, a Social Democrat.

PARKIN, BERLIN SENTENCED FOR PENTAGON FRAUD

<P>
Consultant William L. Parkin and the former Navy engineer he bribed were given 
26-month prison terms Friday for illegally scheming to help two companies get 
lucrative Pentagon contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Parkin, 65, and Stuart E. Berlin, 51, also were each fined $25,000 and ordered 
to serve two years of supervised probation after their release from prison. 
</P>
<P>
Berlin said his crime was "the worst mistake that I ever made in my life." He 
added: "The last year has been a living hell for me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Minimum Security 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton said both defendants, who have cooperated 
with the Justice Department's Operation Ill Wind investigation of Pentagon 
procurement fraud since pleading guilty, could serve their time in 
minimum-security prisons. 
</P>
<P>
Parkin pleaded guilty to charges that he bribed Berlin to provide secret Navy 
bid information that would help Teledyne Electronics, based in Newbury Park, 
Calif., and Hazeltine Corp. of Long Island, N.Y., obtain lucrative contracts to 
sell electronic equipment to the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
Berlin, who admitted from the witness stand in April that he took thousands of 
dollars in bribes while he worked for the Navy, was sentenced for taking nearly 
$5,000 in bribes in return for giving Parkin the bid information. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Joseph J. Aronica said both men, who had testified at the 
trial of two Teledyne executives who were convicted for their roles in the 
conspiracy, are cooperating with the Justice Department's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Motivated by 'Greed' 
</P>
<P>
Aronica said Berlin's receipt of bribes "is perhaps the most serious offense 
that a government official can commit. It is a violation of the public trust. 
It is a corruption that is motivated by nothing more than his own greed." 
</P>
<P>
Parkin's role "as front man and the individual to whom money was paid kept the 
conspiracy afloat," Aronica said. The prosecutor said "corrupting of a public 
official is reprehensible, especially for a former government official." 
</P>
<P>
Parkin, himself a former Navy employee, admitted that he had taken $50,000 in 
bribes over a 10-year period when he worked for the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Center of Scheme 
</P>
<P>
Court documents indicate that after opening a private consulting business in 
1983, Parkin became the center of a bribery scheme involving efforts to trade 
and sell confidential Pentagon information to help companies bid on contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Aronica told the judge that Parkin arranged to be paid $272,000 in consulting 
fees from Teledyne and Hazeltine that he agreed to split with Berlin and others 
to obtain confidential bid information. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Leonard Greenbaum urged the judge to take into account that 
Berlin received less than his share of the bribe money because he was 
"shortchanged at the outset" by Parkin and Fred H. Lackner. Lackner, a Los 
Angeles defense consultant, is awaiting sentencing for his role as go-between 
from Parkin to Berlin.

NEED FOR DISPUTED MEDICARE SURTAX CITED

<P>
The Bush Administration is urging Congress to think twice before cutting taxes 
that will finance a catastrophic illness insurance program for millions of 
older Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Until the government can get a better estimate of how much the surtax will 
bring in and how much the catastrophic coverage will cost, "Treasury would not 
consider it prudent to alter the premium," Assistant Treasury Secretary John G. 
Wilkins told the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The panel and the House Ways and Means Committee are considering several bills 
to repeal or delay the surtax, which was enacted less than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Many older Americans say they do not need the coverage because they have 
private insurance. Others complain that they cannot afford the surtax, which 
this year is 15% of a Medicare beneficiary's federal income tax of $150 or 
more. About 40% of older people would pay the surtax; the maximum tax is $800 
per beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
Unless Congress makes some changes, said Rep. Harris W. Fawell (R-Ill.), "there 
is going to be a popular revolt the likes of which haven't been seen since" a 
massive mail campaign led to repeal of the withholding of taxes from interest 
and dividend payments in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to change the catastrophic law gained momentum recently when Sen. Lloyd 
Bentsen (D-Tex.), chairman of the Finance Committee, disclosed government 
forecasts that the new tax will bring in more than had been estimated just a 
year ago. He raised the possibility of cutting the tax. 
</P>
<P>
During the five years ending in 1993, the Congressional Budget Office now 
estimates, the surtax is likely to bring in about $10 billion more than is 
expected to be spent for catastrophic benefits. 
</P>
<P>
However, Administration officials cautioned that the surplus may never be 
realized because a new drug benefits program starting in 1991 could cost more 
than estimated. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot recommend a reduction in premium (surtax) revenue at this time, 
knowing that the drug benefit faces financial difficulty in the near future," 
said Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of health and human services. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), sponsor of a bill to require upper-income Americans 
of all ages to pay for the program, said the elderly are unwilling to pay the 
surtax. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't understand . . . why they are the only group in our society which 
is being asked to subsidize another part of their group," Levin said.

PRO-ISRAEL ACTIVIST DID NOT TELL OF CAMPAIGN PLAN, CRANSTON AIDE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston's 1986 reelection campaign manager, testifying Friday at the 
trial of pro-Israel activist Michael Goland, said that Goland and Cranston met 
while the campaign was under way, and that Goland volunteered "to work directly 
in Cranston's campaign." 
</P>
<P>
But, said Darry Sragow, Goland personally assured Cranston at a June 21, 1986, 
meeting that he would not engage in any independent campaigns for the purpose 
of drawing votes away from Cranston's Republican rival, Rep. Ed Zschau. 
</P>
<P>
Goland, a San Fernando Valley businessman, and two associates are on trial in 
Los Angeles federal court on charges of secretly paying $120,000 to make and 
air a television commercial for a conservative third-party candidate with the 
aim of costing Zschau votes. Secret contributions from unidentified sources are 
violations of election laws. 
</P>
<P>
Sragow said that, in any event, the Cranston campaign strategists would not 
have wanted such an effort to be conducted because they felt it would inspire 
adverse press coverage and cost Cranston public support. 
</P>
<P>
The Cranston manager said that at the June 21 meeting, he, Cranston and 
Cranston's son, Kim, had met with Goland in a motel room in Westwood and "the 
substance of the discussion was that Mr. Goland would not be conducting an 
independent expenditure campaign and therefore was volunteering to work 
directly in Cranston's campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Sragow said that later he had met with Goland and Colleen Morrow, a Washington, 
D.C., associate of Goland. 
</P>
<P>
But Sragow testified that he was not told about the effort they were going to 
make on behalf of the third-party candidate, Edward B. Vallen of the American 
Independent Party. 
</P>
<P>
Sragow said he could not recall many specifics of the October, 1986, 
conversation in a bar after the regular working day, other than that Morrow 
wanted to work in the Cranston campaign and that the three discussed the theory 
that some conservative Republicans might not be inclined to vote for Zschau, a 
moderate Republican. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Link to Cranston 
</P>
<P>
Sragow's testimony was the first directly linking Cranston to discussions with 
Goland on the question of an independent campaign by Goland in 1986. Two years 
earlier, Goland had spent $1.1 million in an independent effort to defeat 
former Sen. Charles H. Percy (R-Ill.). Goland has generally supported 
candidates favorable to Israel and opposed those who have been critical of the 
Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
Sragow testified that he considered Goland on the "A list" of Cranston 
supporters and a potential fund-raiser, though he said that, actually, Goland 
had done little directly for the Cranston campaign and contact with him ceased 
in the last two weeks, during the time Goland is accused of waging the illegal 
effort for Vallen. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutor George New-house said Cranston would not be called to 
testify at the trial, since he regarded Sragow as an authoritative 
representative of him.

MORNING BRIEFING: ORIOLES' TETTLETON TIMED IT PERFECTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mickey Tettleton, the terror of American League pitchers, figures he broke in 
with the Baltimore Orioles at the perfect time -- not this season, when they're 
leading the East Division, but on May 9 last year when they were 4-26 and 
headed for their worst season ever. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Cal Ripken had been fired, and the front office was more concerned 
about punching tickets out of town for Eddie Murray, Mike Boddicker and friends 
than worrying about who was already in town. Terry Kennedy was in a terrible 
slump, and the new manager, Frank Robinson, was ready to try a new catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton hit .261 with a career-high 11 homers and 37 RBIs, and the Orioles 
couldn't have cared less. 
</P>
<P>
"I was getting to play, and I could go through a slump, get hot, whatever," he 
told Richard Justice of the Washington Post. "No one gave me a second thought." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Tettleton shares the American League lead with 13 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if this is all a dream but whoever wakes me up is going to get 
punched," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Considering how long the Lakers have been sitting around waiting 
to see who they'll play in the NBA Finals, should they have an advantage over a 
team coming off a tough series? 
</P>
<P>
Down on the Farm: New York Mets fans and some players think Manager Dave 
Johnson should send rookie phenom-turned-flop Gregg Jefferies, 21, down to the 
minors for everybody's good. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Mantle also said it might be a good idea. At 19, it happened to him. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was Jefferies, I wouldn't mind," Mantle said. "Me and Casey (Stengel) 
both cried. Now that I look back, it was the best thing that could have 
happened. I was so scared. Can you imagine going from Joplin (Mo.) to New York 
City?" 
</P>
<P>
When the Mets brought Jefferies up last September for a look, he was so good he 
was almost voted rookie of the year, hitting .321 for 29 games. Now he's at 
.187. 
</P>
<P>
Mantle relates. 
</P>
<P>
"I could see I wasn't doin' as good as Casey said I would," Mantle drawled. "He 
had me, Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio rolled into one. I was striking 
out so much it was embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
Even down at Kansas City, then a Yankee farm club, Mantle batted 21 times 
without a hit. 
</P>
<P>
Concidentally, Willie Mays was hitless in his first 21 at-bats with the Giants 
and shrilled to Leo Durocher, the manager, "Send me down, Mr. Leo. I can't hit 
up here." 
</P>
<P>
Mays stayed and Mantle returned. As it turned out, both did all right.

Trivia answer: History says . . . not necessarily. Five times the Lakers have 
gone 4-0 in the next-to-last round, and three times they have met teams coming 
off 4-3 series. In 1968, they lost to the Boston Celtics, 4-2, but in '82, they 
defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 4-2, and in '87, they beat the Boston Celtics, 
4-2. Last season, the Lakers came off consecutive seven-game series against the 
Utah Jazz and the Dallas Mavericks -- and beat the Detroit Pistons in seven.

AQMD HIKES ITS BUDGET, RAISES FEES TO PAY FOR IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District on Friday adopted an 
$80-million budget for fiscal 1989-90 and increased fees to stationary 
polluters nearly 20% to help finance it. 
</P>
<P>
Prodded by Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, the lone dissenter in 
the voice vote, the 12-member board agreed to work toward establishing 
management audits, an extended five-year budget planning process and new ways 
to finance the district's operation. 
</P>
<P>
The district has embarked on a bold plan to bring the Los Angeles Basin into 
compliance with federal air quality standards by the year 2007. Staff members 
contend that the budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 was the minimum 
amount necessary to begin that work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Financial Efficiency 
</P>
<P>
Although passage of the proposed budget and fee increase proceeded as if by 
script, the board clearly sympathized with contractors and small businessmen 
who pleaded for greater financial efficiency, long-range planning to give them 
warning about future fee increases and an end to excessive fees. 
</P>
<P>
Board members appeared particularly moved by the white-haired, 65-year-old 
owner of a Whittier parts painting company who said he would have to go out of 
business if the board did not spread the cost of curbing pollution. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not fair folks, it is not fair," said Harel Martin, who with his family 
runs the Santa Fe Enameling Co. 
</P>
<P>
"Pass a little on to automobiles or homeowners. We want to pay our fair share, 
but not 20%" he urged, winning the day's only applause in the crowded hearing 
room. 
</P>
<P>
District Executive Director James M. Lents, trying to mollify contractors, said 
the district's work traditionally has focused on stationary sources of 
pollution. Therefore, he said, raising revenue for inspections and permit 
processing by assessing fees against the manufacturers and contractors who 
created the pollution was appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
But now that the district is assuming some responsibility for monitoring mobile 
sources of pollution, Lents said, new sources of revenue should and will be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
He said the California Clean Air Act recently empowered the district to collect 
fees from vehicle owners and that his staff will present suggestions to the 
board on how to do that by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Lents also noted that a bill is currently pending in the Legislature to assess 
an additional $3 for each vehicle registration to combat air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Creative Ways' 
</P>
<P>
Robert Rascon, spokesman for the Southern California Air Quality Alliance, a 
part of the California Manufacturers Assn., asked for "more creative ways to 
generate revenue" to ease the burden on manufacturers. He suggested taxing 
homeowners and renters, for example, for using gasoline lawn mowers and leaf 
blowers. 
</P>
<P>
District staff members said the approved 19.8% fee increase will produce only 
7% more revenue next year because emissions, upon which the fees are based, are 
declining. 
</P>
<P>
Fees usually cover about 85% of the district's budget needs -- 88% in the 
current year and 82% in the budget adopted Friday. The remainder is made up 
from state, federal and local government sources. 
</P>
<P>
The budget adopted Friday totals $80.2 million, a 12.3% increase over the $71.4 
million spent this year and includes 40 new staff positions. Some 
manufacturers' representatives, however, said the new budget is actually a 
38.5% increase over the $57.9 million proposed by the district for the current 
fiscal year at this time last year. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich, backing up his argument with arithmetic, criticized both the fee 
assessment and the budget increase. 
</P>
<P>
"Placing the burden on the group responsible for the least amount of emissions 
-- mobile sources are responsible for 70% of it -- is not fair," he said. "And 
it does place an unfair burden on small business owners." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comparisons Made 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich said that the district's budget had increased 185% over the last 
five years, compared to 37.6% for Los Angeles County, 34.8% for the state of 
California and 52.7% for the city of Los Angeles over the same period. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never seen budgets increase to the degree that they have in such a 
short time frame as they have with this agency," the supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
Other board members countered that the district must increase expenditures 
because of duties imposed on it by the federal government to clean up the 
area's air. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not a multipurpose government which can cut services," San Bernardino 
County Supervisor Robert L. Hammock said. "We are a single-purpose agency on a 
crusade."

L.A. SUBWAY CRANE OPERATOR IS A STUDY IN CONCENTRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I operate the biggest damned crane in L.A.," Tony Maes said with a delighted 
grin. "And L.A.'s a pretty . . . big place." 
</P>
<P>
The machine Maes runs -- a 230-ton Manitowoc crawler crane -- may not be the 
biggest. That's open to question. But it is one of the most imposing pieces of 
equipment being used to construct Los Angeles' new subway system. Maes is proud 
of that, and he likes to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a young, single, good-looking Mexican with a zeal for life," he said the 
other day as he swung into the cab of the massive crane, parked beside a subway 
access pit at 5th and Hill streets. "I'm good at this." 
</P>
<P>
Maes pushed a button, and the crane's big Detroit Diesel engine burbled into 
life. His hands fluttered across the forest of control levers, and a huge 
hydraulic piston at the end of the lift cable rose slowly from the ground and 
began to swing through the air. 
</P>
<P>
Winch controls raised and lowered the load. Turntable controls swung it in a 
circle. Boom controls moved the load closer or farther from the cab. Maes 
explained that the art is to initiate all three movements simultaneously in a 
smooth, constantly changing arc. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a challenge -- to become better, to improve," he said. "A push cat is on 
the ground. A backhoe is on the ground. But a crane is in flight -- up, down, 
in, away, left, right. It's like painting a painting." 
</P>
<P>
Maes, one of three crane operators who work shifts at 5th and Hill -- and one 
of about 1,625 workers employed on the subway project -- has been on the job 
for several months now. He expects to continue working there for another year 
or so, when his job will be completed. The 35-year-old Ventura resident 
commutes to work each day on a motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
100-Foot Boom 
</P>
<P>
His crane handles loads ranging from a few pounds to more than 30 tons. Most of 
his work involves lowering construction equipment to the men below, and hauling 
it back out again when they're finished. He also unloads trucks and moves gear 
around the work yard, which is easily spanned by the crane's 100-foot-long 
boom. 
</P>
<P>
The piston he was moving the other day slid gently out of sight as he lowered 
it into the access pit that leads to a vast, underground chasm that is slowly 
evolving into one of the four subterranean stations being built for the initial 
4.4-mile segment of the Metro Rail Red Line subway system. 
</P>
<P>
Maes couldn't see the load any more. A tunnel worker, using a series of hand 
signals, served as the crane operator's eyes, guiding Maes as he maneuvered the 
piston so that it could be inserted into a cylindrical digging shield that will 
be used to excavate another stretch of the subway's twin tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
During the insertion process, which took almost 10 minutes, Maes's eyes never 
left the man's hands. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to concentrate," he said. "An accident can happen so fast. And 
you've got to have confidence." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ran the Streets' 
</P>
<P>
Maes is the first to admit that the confidence wasn't always there. As a youth 
growing up in a tough minority neighborhood, he said he "ran the streets of San 
Francisco" as a boy, "smoking pot, drinking booze." 
</P>
<P>
Maes said things didn't improve much with a subsequent stint in the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
"But somewhere inside, I knew life wasn't supposed to be like that," he said. 
"I knew there was a creative, responsible person inside of me." 
</P>
<P>
Maes said he was working as a roughneck on an offshore oil platform off Point 
Conception when he started watching the platform crane operator. 
</P>
<P>
"One day, I asked him how to operate the thing, and he showed me how to start 
it," Maes said. "When he went to lunch. I climbed in there, started it up, and 
began to practice." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Easy Does It 
</P>
<P>
With practice came skill, along with the realization that a big crane is an 
extremely dangerous piece of equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time you get in that seat, you've got to remember that you've got a 
chance to screw up," he said. "You can misjudge what the machine can handle. Or 
what you can handle. Try to move too much, or too far, or too fast. Maybe tip 
the whole damned thing over. People can die if you screw up. 
</P>
<P>
"There are three kinds of crane operators," he said, flashing another grin. 
"There are those that are just crane operators; those that are good crane 
operators; those that are hot crane operators. 
</P>
<P>
"I happen to be of the hot variety."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOY, 16, ACCUSED OF SHOOTING AT OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 16-year-old gang member was being held Friday at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall 
in Downey after he fired a pistol from the steps of a Norwalk church on 
Wednesday and narrowly missed a passing sheriff's deputy, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
When deputies chased down the Norwalk youth they found another bullet jammed in 
the chamber of his .22-caliber pistol, indicating that he had attempted another 
shot, Sheriff's Lt. Joe Monarrez said. Deputy Eric Barbour, 30, was patroling 
on Shoemaker Avenue and driving by St. Linus Catholic Church when the youth, 
who was standing on the church steps with other teen-agers, fired at him "for 
no apparent reason," Monarrez said. 
</P>
<P>
The youth, whose name was withheld because of his age, was arrested on 
suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ALLEGED 'SKINHEADS' DENIED LOWER BAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A court commissioner Friday refused to reduce the $50,000 bail set for each of 
four reputed neo-Nazi "skinheads" charged with attacking a Middle Eastern 
couple in the mistaken belief that they were Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys argued that the bail was excessive, but Pomona Municipal 
Court Commissioner Joel Hoffman disagreed. The lawyers told the judge that 
their clients had strong community ties, little or no prior criminal records 
and were not likely to flee prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Hyatt Seligman argued that, because the defendants 
apparently "prey on anyone different from them, they represent a grave danger 
to the community." 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner ordered Scott R. Wilson, 28, of West Covina; Timothy Robert 
Zaal, 25, of Glendora; William Killackey, 21, of Yorba Linda, and his sister, 
Amy Killackey, 19, of West Covina, to remain in custody in lieu of $50,000 bail 
each. 
</P>
<P>
The four face charges in connection with the alleged attack and beating of a 
Middle Eastern couple in a La Verne grocery store parking lot May 28.

CHILDREN'S MUSEUM MAY EXPAND TO INCLUDE MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal that would vastly expand the small, crowded Los Angeles Children's 
Museum and transform the troubled Civic Center mall secured official 
endorsements Friday from Mayor Tom Bradley and Councilman Gilbert Lindsay. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and Lindsay, whose district includes the downtown museum, said they 
will urge the City Council to grant museum officials six months to develop a 
plan in which they would take over management of the mall and seek private 
financial commitments expected to exceed $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
Museum officials say it will take at least that much money to achieve their 
goal: five-fold expansion of the museum's space that would potentially 
accommodate a million visitors a year, according to Richard Reinis, museum 
president. It would become, Reinis declared, "the finest children's museum in 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
Officials view the proposal as a cultural complement to such downtown 
attractions as the expanding Music Center, the Museum of Contemporary Art, 
Olvera Street, Chinatown and Little Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an idea we simply cannot turn down. It's too great a possibility for 
the history of this city," Bradley said in a press conference outside the 
museum's front door. 
</P>
<P>
During the six-month study period, the city would place a moratorium on the 
leasing of space in the two-block Los Angeles Mall, a subterranean row of 
restaurants, shops and financial services that cater primarily to Civic Center 
workers. The museum says it needs the moratorium to develop plans for the mall 
space. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal is for the museum's existing 15,000-square-foot quarters on 
the north block of the mall to grow to more than 80,000 square feet, including 
more exhibits and a children's theater. 
</P>
<P>
The street-level plaza would be redesigned as a playground, with the defunct 
Triforium musical tower revived as its centerpiece. The museum draws 270,000 
visitors a year, making it one of the most densely used in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurants and shops serving downtown workers would be centralized on the 
southern block, officials said.

COUNSELING PROGRAM FOR HOMELESS STARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley and county Supervisor Ed Edelman on Friday joined a Skid Row 
anti-homeless agency in kicking off a modest but innovative program for 
fighting homelessness that they said represents a new weapon in tackling the 
seemingly intractable crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The $70,000, five-month pilot program, jointly funded by the city and county, 
will pay salaries for social workers who will act as personal counselors to 
homeless individuals, matching them with existing specialized programs that can 
steer them into jobs, permanent housing, alcohol treatment or other services. 
</P>
<P>
Maxene Johnston, director of the Weingart Center on Skid Row, which will 
oversee the program, said that while her agency has fed 21,000 individuals and 
housed thousands more, such efforts are not enough to return the homeless to 
mainstream life. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston said that while there are no scientific studies on the subject, she 
believes that most individuals and families who spend more than a week on the 
streets "fall into a downward spiral that makes it almost impossible to prevent 
their becoming the long-term homeless." 
</P>
<P>
She said the specialized counselors will be able to get transportation, arrange 
appointments, handle phone calls and offer other assistance to link homeless 
individuals to a vast array of existing programs that they now find out about 
"by accident, if at all." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
32 Hours a Week in Line 
</P>
<P>
Johnston cited a San Francisco study that showed that homeless people are 
forced to spend about 32 hours a week standing in lines to get food, make phone 
calls, talk to a social worker, sign up for job-training, use a bathroom, line 
up a bed for the night, get a shower or secure other necessities. 
</P>
<P>
Because homelessness "is practically a full-time job," she said, few of the 
homeless are able to pull themselves out of the cycle on the streets without 
personal assistance from a knowledgeable social worker. And, Johnston said, as 
they stay longer on the streets, the costs of serving them skyrocket because 
alcoholism, drug use and mental problems strike "even the most steady of them." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and Edelman expressed optimism that the pilot program, known as the 
Homeless Evaluation and Linkage Program, or HELP, will be successful enough to 
warrant more extensive funding from both governmental entities. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether anyone can tell you whether or not we can fully solve the 
problem," Bradley said. But, he added, he will seek City Council funding and 
county funding to turn the pilot effort into a full-fledged program if it is 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman, who along with Supervisor Kenneth Hahn is funding the program out of 
discretionary funds from the supervisors' individual district budgets, said he 
is convinced that beds and food for the homeless "are simply not enough." 
</P>
<P>
He said that while the conservative-dominated Board of Supervisors may not go 
along with funding a new social program even if the pilot succeeds, he and Hahn 
can still find more money, earmarked for their own districts, to turn HELP into 
a permanent program.

RIGGED-ODOMETER INVESTIGATION HAS 'HIT THE JACKPOT'

The lead investigator in what has been termed the largest recent

Chlopek said that some of the seized sales and ownership documents appear to 
show that original mileage figures for some out-of-state pickup trucks brought 
into California had been deleted or covered over. New mileage figures appear to 
have been written in, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, documents that had been signed under penalty of perjury show 
nothing in the space where mileage is supposed to be recorded, he said. "It is 
blank." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
400 Buyers Affected 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of documents were seized over the Memorial Day weekend in an 
investigation that officials say defrauded up to 400 consumers out of an 
estimated $500,000 -- money they would have saved had the true mileage been 
posted. The customers bought trucks whose odometers had been rolled back, 
Chlopek said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the multistate investigation involved a sophisticated ring 
that purchased late-model, high-mileage trucks in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and 
other Western states, brought them to California, falsified paper work on them, 
tampered with the odometers, spruced them up and sold them to 44 dealers, 
mostly in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
In one sale cited in the search warrants, a 1985 Ford pickup with 166,985 miles 
on it showed 48,371 miles on the odometer when it was sold to a Lancaster 
dealer. 
</P>
<P>
Odometer-tampering is a federal offense with a possible prison term of two 
years. Chlopek said the investigation, which he conducted with colleague 
Charlene Arp, will eventually be turned over to the U.S. attorney for 
prosecution. No indictments have been issued and none are expected for months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seized Papers 
</P>
<P>
The investigator said the papers seized during the weekend have opened so many 
new leads that the investigation may be broadened. 
</P>
<P>
"The initial analysis is that we have hit the jackpot," Chlopek said. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor that will delay completion of the investigation is that some 
documents require time-consuming analysis. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, papers that appear to have been falsified will be sent to 
experts who will "try to remove white-out and black felt-tip pen markings," 
Chlopek said. "That will take time." 
</P>
<P>
The search warrants were served on some organizations that are targets in the 
investigation, but Chlopek said two businesses whose records were seized are 
not under suspicion -- Elvia Zapien's VIP Registration Service in Pico Rivera 
and Auction Express Title Service in Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
"'VIP and Auction Express have been cooperating," Chlopek said. "I don't think 
they had any criminal involvement in it at all. It is just that they had the 
records and that is what we needed. At this point in time, they are not 
suspects." 
</P>
<P>
"We are cooperating with the DMV," said Zapien, whose firm expedites and 
processes vehicle transfer documents. "We have an impeccable reputation. We 
worked many years to establish that reputation. Any inference that we are 
involved in an odometer-rigging scheme is absurd and in error." 
</P>
<P>
Also named in the search warrants were Truck Auto Sales in Ontario, owner C .P. 
Mercer and his wife, Mattie Aline Mercer, their home in Chino, Mercer's son, 
Phillip of Bristow, Okla., and Yiser Dean Dabbs of Fullerton.

DEFENDANT BRAGGED OF SLAYING, WITNESS SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McDOUGAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former brother-in-law of Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt testified 
Friday in the so-called "Cotton Club" murder case that one defendant bragged 
about shooting producer Roy Radin six years ago and another had to drink a 
bottle of wine before he could join in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
William Rider, who was also chief of Flynt's personal security force from 1976 
through 1983, testified during the preliminary hearing in Los Angeles Municipal 
Court that the publisher hired as many as 25 bodyguards after an assassination 
attempt in 1976 left him permanently paralyzed and wheelchair bound. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hired 2 Defendants 
</P>
<P>
Among those Rider hired to watch over Flynt's Bel-Air mansion and his 
magazine's headquarters in Century City were Alex Lamota Mentzer and William 
Molony Marti, two of the defendants charged in the murder six years ago of 
Radin. 
</P>
<P>
Radin, a 300-pound producer from Long Island, N.Y., was attempting to 
co-produce the motion picture "The Cotton Club" with former Paramount Pictures 
production head Robert Evans shortly before he was shot to death near Hungry 
Valley Road in northeast Los Angeles County. His body was found June 10, 1983. 
He had been shot repeatedly in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Evans went on to produce "The Cotton Club" with two Las Vegas casino operators, 
Ed and Fred Doumani. The movie, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and written by 
Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist William Kennedy, did not recoup the more than 
$40 million that it cost to make. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fighting Extradition 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that reputed drug dealer Karen DeLayne (Lainie) Greenberger 
contracted for Radin's murder after they quarreled over her share of profits 
from "The Cotton Club." Greenberger allegedly introduced Radin to Evans several 
months before Radin disappeared May 13, 1983. Greenberger is charged along with 
Marti, Mentzer and Robert Ulmer Lowe, all former Flynt bodyguards who worked 
for Rider. Lowe is fighting extradition in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
After Radin's disappearance, but before published reports of the discovery of 
his body, Marti and Mentzer boasted to Rider of shooting Radin to death, he 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
"Alex liked to make fun of Radin and called him Rodan," Rider said. Marti, a 
native of Argentina, was extremely anti-Semitic, Rider testified. 
</P>
<P>
Rider said Marti told him that he had emptied his gun into Radin the night of 
the murder but that Mentzer had to drink a bottle of wine before he, too, could 
find the courage to shoot the producer. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys asked Municipal Judge Patti Jo McKay to halt Rider's 
testimony after less than 30 minutes, arguing that Rider had made several 
statements from the stand that had never turned up in prosecution tapes or 
transcripts the defense had requested in prehearing discovery motions. Under 
rules of evidence, the prosecution is required to turn over such material to 
the defense upon demand. 
</P>
<P>
McKay ordered Deputy Dist. Atty. David Conn to return to court Monday with all 
of Rider's debriefing notes as well as with the investigating homicide officers 
who made those notes to ascertain whether defense attorneys have everything 
they demanded in discovery. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier testimony, actor Grady Demond Wilson, best known as the character 
Lamont Sanford on the late '70s television series "Sanford and Son," ended four 
days on the stand Friday by announcing that his autobiography, chronicling his 
move from cocaine-abusing entertainer to Christian preacher, is due in 
bookstores in September. 
</P>
<P>
His part as the gun-toting bodyguard, actor, friend and client of Radin is not 
included in the book, he testified. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson testified that Radin asked him and his former secretary to park outside 
the Hollywood Regency hotel the night of May 13, 1983, and to follow Radin to 
La Scala restaurant for dinner. Wilson said he has the right to carry a 
concealed weapon because he was once deputized by a judge in Louisville, Ky. 
Radin feared that "something might happen" to him as a result of his 
involvement in "The Cotton Club," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson lost Radin's limousine in traffic on Sunset Boulevard and never saw him 
again, he testified. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary hearing is being conducted to determine whether prosecutors 
have enough evidence to bind Greenberger, Marti and Mentzer over to Superior 
Court for trial in Radin's murder.

BLACKS IN VERMONT SEE CHURCH AS THEIR HAVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

BURLINGTON, Vt.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Strains of black gospel music, punctuated by the ringing of tambourines and 
rhythmic clapping of hands, pulsate from a small church on the campus of the 
University of Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
It is a joyous sound, with booming voices singing, "I got a feeling everything 
is going to be all right," and bodies joining in, with hips, feet and shoulders 
moving to the beat. 
</P>
<P>
Black gospel music is not unusual in most states, but it is in Vermont, the 
whitest of all states. With a population of 546,000, the Green Mountain State 
has only 2,000 black residents, 1988 U.S. census figures show. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Longed for Own Place 
</P>
<P>
The New Alpha Missionary Baptist Church, the first black church in the state, 
was formed in August, fulfilling the dreams of its young pastor, the Rev. 
Rodney Patterson, and about 40 other black residents who longed for their own 
place to worship God in their own way. It is a way that has its origins in the 
deep South but is common in many urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
But the church means more to Georgia Lynch, 37, a computer analyst who moved to 
Vermont from South Carolina 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Hers was the only black family in her neighborhood -- a difficult situation for 
a woman who grew up in an integrated town and chose to attend an all-black 
college. 
</P>
<P>
"Just to see other black people means a lot. When I first moved up here I knew 
there weren't going to be many, but I never dreamed there would be so few," 
Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the church has done a lot to alleviate the feeling of isolation she 
had endured. 
</P>
<P>
"It has really solidified the black community here, as small as it is," she 
said. "It's a place where we can share our own culture, talk about things that 
my (white) co-workers would never comprehend. Small things like where to get 
your hair done. I've had to drive to Albany, Plattsburgh and even Montreal." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Ralston, a contractor for General Electric Co. and president of the Black 
Professional Network of Vermont, said his group had talked about a church for 
several years. He said group members felt a church of their own would provide a 
solid base for blacks in the state to do a number of things to enhance their 
lives, as well as provide them with spiritual guidance. 
</P>
<P>
"All we were waiting for was a minister," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit group of 200 black professionals found what they were looking for 
in Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson, 27, director of cultural affairs at the University of Vermont, has 
been preaching since he was a teen-ager. He started the New Alpha Missionary 
Baptist Church in August. Since then, his congregation has been meeting Sunday 
afternoons in the sanctuary of Christ Church Presbyterian on campus, after the 
mostly white parishioners finish their 9:30 a.m. service. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson said that having a separate church is important. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to remember that historically, blacks had been forbidden to worship 
with just anybody," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch and other parishioners agreed.

SALVADOR'S GRIM PROSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The inauguration of El Salvador's President Alfredo Cristiani was a landmark in 
the history of that country. For the first time, a democratically elected 
civilian peacefully handed power to another democratically elected civilian, no 
small accomplishment in a nation controlled for 140 years by a small landed 
oligarchy and a corrupt military. 
</P>
<P>
That said, however, there is little else positive, or even very hopeful, about 
El Salvador these days. For Cristiani's ascension to the presidency marks the 
final step in a campaign by the most radical elements of the Salvadoran right 
wing, a notorious faction with a sordid history of violence, to take control of 
a Salvadoran government that is already under siege from a fierce and 
persistent Marxist insurgency. Cristiani's Nationalist Republican Alliance, 
best known by its Spanish-language acronym Arena, controlled El Salvador's 
courts and its legislature before his inauguration. Now Arena's grasp of power 
is total. 
</P>
<P>
That bodes trouble for the United States. For the past 10 years U.S. 
policy-makers and diplomats have promoted moderate Salvadoran politicians such 
as former President Jose Napoleon Duarte as alternatives to the extremists of 
right and left. For a while that strategy worked. Duarte helped persuade 
Congress to make El Salvador the largest recipient of U.S. aid in the Western 
Hemisphere. But with Duarte out of office and likely to die of cancer soon, 
there seem to be no moderate alternatives in El Salvador. That puts the 
Administration in the unenviable position of sending about $1.5 million a day 
to a government run by men described by some U.S. officials as neo-Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani, a businessman who was not among the original leaders of Arena when 
the party was founded several years ago, insists that he represents a new breed 
of more moderate Arena leaders. But the old hands lurk in the background, 
including Roberto D'Aubuisson, the alleged godfather of El Salvador's death 
squads, and Hector Antonio Regalado, whom Duarte accused of assassinating 
Archbishop Oscar Romero several years ago. If recent history is any guide, 
Cristiani cannot control the Arena thugs. He was forced to appoint associates 
of D'Aubuisson to important security positions in the government. And when he 
resisted pressure to appoint a hard-line officer as his defense minister, 
Cristiani faced a near-revolt in the Salvadoran military. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to say which faction in El Salvador will pose the greater headache 
for the United States in the coming years -- its "enemies" the rebels or its 
"friends" in the government. Guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front control a third of the country and have an unnerving capacity 
to kill and wound security forces and sabotage the national economy. The 
government now represents reactionary civilians who refer to land reform as 
"U.S.-imposed socialism" and hard-line military officers who want to replace 
the low-intensity warfare urged on them by U.S. advisers with all-out war on 
the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
With more than 60,000 people dead and 1 million refugees -- this in a nation of 
only 5 million people -- El Salvador has had more than enough of war. But the 
only alternative to either high-intensity or low-intensity conflict is a 
revival of peace talks begun by Duarte that stalled when the severity of his 
illness became known. In almost 10 years of fighting, neither side has come 
close to defeating the other. Under the circumstances, it is amazing that 
hard-liners on both sides think victory is possible. But if Arena and the 
Salvadoran military want to pursue a scorched-earth policy to rout the FMLN, 
Washington should make it clear that U.S. taxpayers won't pay the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, this county must use its leverage to downplay the war talk and push for 
a renewal of the dialogue with the FMLN. Peace talks will not be easy between 
two sides that have been at war so long,but there are short-term goals that 
could be a starting point -- specifically, plans to "humanize" the war by 
reducing the level of fighting in areas where innocent people are affected, and 
beyond that the details of a possible cease-fire. Ultimately, any peace talks 
must include a power-sharing arrangement between the various political 
factions, a step hard-liners on both sides have resisted, but one that would 
take the resolution of the divisions within Salvadoran society off the 
battlefield and put it on the conference table.

PILGRIMAGE TO MALLDEN; 
</P>
<P>
CONTEMPLATING HUMANITY IN THE SUBURBAN HABITAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE WATSON, Bruce Watson is a writer who lives in Amherst, Mass. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I wrote the following I lived alone in Mallden, a few stores south of 
ToyTowne, in a house that I had built myself from a Presto Log Cabin Kit. I 
lived there one year and a month. At present I am a catalogue shopper again. 
</P>
<P>
The mass of men lead lives of ambling desperation accompanied by Muzak. Or by 
some glad-handed salesman at a Wurlitzer. My neighbors pass my cabin in an 
endless stream of T-shirts, funny hats and unruly hair. They pause to check a 
sale price, coo at a caged puppy, consume overpriced potato skins. They pay me 
little mind. I join them for a while, shopping for garden tools at Hardware 
World, but soon must return to my cabin to hoe the beans I have planted in the 
last patch of solid earth left amid the Mexican tile, plastic and fiberglass. 
</P>
<P>
Mallden is tribute to post-modern excess, an air-conditioned "shopping 
environment" with 87 stores, 16 restaurants, 12 theaters, a fountain, and one 
resident shopper in his cabin. 
</P>
<P>
I went to the mall because I wished to live materially, to face the essential 
facts of purchase, the need to buy that fuels our economy, and the struggle for 
doodads and gewgaws that defines our lives; so that I could later say that I 
had conquered shopping, had faced down consumerism and not merely browsed. For 
most men, it seems to me, are indifferent toward our material existence. They 
wander these aisles as if detached, letting their wives, daughters, lovers lead 
them from the pants to the dress shirts and back, while they cast an involved 
glance only at the stacked TVs, hoping to catch a baseball score. I wanted more 
from life. I wanted to know the mall as well as my own home, to live there, and 
having lived, to publish my account in one of the glossy, oversized mags that 
adorn the shelves of the Book Nook. One with a celebrity on the cover. Susan 
Sarandon, say. 
</P>
<P>
Our life is frittered away by detail. How many a shopper have I seen enter 
Mallden with a determined look, vowing to buy a mere shower curtain or a pair 
of jogging shoes, only to have his resolve weakened by a window display of 
Springsteen albums and end up, hours later, mindlessly munching a chili dog and 
staring at the flowing waters of the fountain? I say let your shopping be for 
two or three items, not a hundred, and keep a list, a calculator and a small 
box of clipped coupons. Instead of a double burger, buy a plain. Instead of a 
quad, buy a stereo (but with Dolby). Make things simpler! Make things simpler! 
And when they are simple, buy them. On credit, if you are not already 
over-extended. 
</P>
<P>
There are nowadays practitioners of shopping but few shoppers. For to be a 
shopper is not merely to buy, but to live, from sale to sale, a life of credit, 
debt, partial payment and bankruptcy. It is to solve all problems through a 
trip to the mall, to conquer depression with a new outfit, despair with 
appliances, loneliness with CDs. 
</P>
<P>
Men and women, girls and boys, dropped into my cabin. They inquired of my 
health, my frame of mind, if I knew of a sale on sheets. I let them fill my 
room with their bulky bags and sent them on their way with little advice other 
than where they might find a cheap percale. 
</P>
<P>
Every morning before the doors opened I bathed in the central fountain, and 
every night when all were gone I jogged laps, from ToyTowne to the Stuff Shoppe 
and back. Thus did the long summer pass. The days grew short. The winter 
approached. Football games came on the tubes at Video Village. The pumpkins 
appeared in Greetings, Etc. Then the turkeys. Finally came the full blaze of 
winter decor, the tinsel and lights, the calendars in the bookstore, the 
plastic reindeer, and then another cabin on the far end of the mall. This one 
was smaller than mine, fronted by a white picket fence, graced by a huge pine 
growing straight from the concrete, and curiously covered with an indoor 
variety of snow. A neighbor soon took up residence there, one who wore a red 
suit and had perky female friends. But he was busy all day with children and he 
left at night, so I never got to know him. 
</P>
<P>
And soon after these signs appeared came the men bundled in sweaters, the women 
in fake furs, the children all puffing in from the wet, stomping their feet, 
wiping their noses and setting off in search of the goods. Winter had come to 
Mallden. It was October. 
</P>
<P>
My journal has this to say of winter: Today, a Monday, normally quiet in 
Mallden but now teeming with guests, their arms full of treasures, their cheeks 
full of treats from Chuckie's Nut Barn. My cabin was so filled by the curious, 
asking where they might buy such a cabin, did it come with a guarantee, and 
what about the layaway, that I took refuge. I walked out of the mall and into 
the gray symmetry of the parking lot. There I stood on the edge of the 
wilderness and gazed into civilization. Cartloads of mall goods flowed past me 
into station wagons and out to the world beyond. Thus it seems my Mallden wares 
are shared with the humble shoppers of lands I will never see, of Glendale and 
Anaheim and the far-off San Berdoo. I drink deeply from the same well as the 
Shriner in Temple City. I share the same digital readouts as the golf pro in 
Mission Viejo. The Republican and I are united by a common debt. As one we add 
to the trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
I journey back inside and a tumult greets me. A shoplifter has been caught. 
</P>
<P>
Following the exchange of those goods poorly chosen or ill-fitting came the 
rest of winter, brave and lonely in the mall. Spring came haltingly. The 
shoppers trickled in at first, but soon the crowds returned. Stores opened 
their doors wide, grand openings appeared, and spring, Spring! came to Mallden. 
Lots of cleaning products, mine for a song. 
</P>
<P>
I ventured out to shop in the spring air. But I found that I had had my fill of 
shopping and would fain be finished with my experiment. And so I packed my 
things and prepared to leave Mallden. I bid farewell to cabin, shopper, clerk. 
I took my valises, a Styrofoam cup and a flyer from a new fried-dough eatery. I 
walked one last time through Mallden, then wound my way past the 12-cinema 
ticket booth and into the world outside. 
</P>
<P>
We are at great pains to prove ourselves worthy through our purchases, yet our 
purchases themselves are worthy of respect. I know many a man who has placed a 
portion of his possessions in mini-storage, only to go out and buy the same 
ice-cream maker, the same Lil' Boy cooler, yes, the same NFL coasters again, 
forgetting that he already owned a set. How many humidifiers can a man use? I 
say we must shop with care, letting only the best pull the plastic from our 
wallets, as the Yuppies of gentrified countries do. Buy your lamps, your lawn 
chairs, your high-powered rifles so faithfully that you can wake up in the 
night and think of your purchase with satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
The shopping world is full of endless novelty. Who knows but what a trinket, 
once though useless, might be taken up by a skillful marketer, mentioned on 
"Oprah!" and so become the season's craze. Consider the Cabbage Patch Doll.

DUCKING RESPONSIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In bargaining over a modest relaxation of the Gann limits on state spending, 
some Republican legislative leaders have come up with one of the most absurd 
proposals ever to surface in Sacramento. They want to pass a state 
constitutional amendment that would require a statewide vote on any plan to 
increase any state tax. Why not repeal representative government altogether and 
revert to the town meetings of Colonial days? 
</P>
<P>
Government in California is virtually in paralysis now because of restrictive 
amendments and laws adopted through the initiative petition. The Gann limit, 
Proposition 4 approved by voters in 1979, is a case in point. California is 
desperate for additional funds to build and maintain an adequate highway 
system, but could not spend the money under the present Gann limit if raised 
through an increase in the gasoline tax. Even Gov. George Deukmejian appears to 
favor a relaxation in the Gann limit to allow more spending on highways and he 
is not exactly Mr. Big Spender. 
</P>
<P>
The California business community, through the conservative California 
Taxpayers Assn., is supporting a proposed constitutional amendment to provide a 
general easing of the Gann limits by adopting a formula that provides a more 
realistic reflection of state economic growth and state needs. The business 
community recognizes that the entire state's economy will suffer if California 
does not provide the highways and other facilities the state needs to function. 
</P>
<P>
Under Proposition 13, the Jarvis-Gann property tax measure of 1978, the 
Legislature can raise state taxes only by a two-thirds vote of the Legislature. 
So it is virtually impossible to increase any levy now. Passage of the state 
budget also takes a two-thirds vote, meaning that a minority of 14 in the state 
Senate or 27 in the Assembly can thwart the will of the 120-member Legislature. 
The Founding Fathers, recognizing the dangers of the tyranny of a minority, 
provided for majority rule in the Constitution. They had seen that the nation 
could not survive under the impotent structure established by the Articles of 
Confederation. 
</P>
<P>
California needs a Legislature that will legislate and a governor who will 
govern -- not lawmakers who don't believe in making law.

DON'T GET SORE: MITCHELL BACK WITH 2 HOMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Last week, Kevin Mitchell's hands were so sore he had to take a night off. His 
home run stroke suffered. 
</P>
<P>
The soreness was gone by Friday night, and the major leagues' home run leader 
hit two more at Atlanta to help Rick Reuschel become the first 10-game winner 
in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves hammered Reuschel for nine hits and four runs, chasing him in the 
seventh inning, but they fell short as the San Francisco Giants won, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Gossage, continuing his comeback with the Giants, came to the rescue. 
After Craig Lefferts gave up a two-run home run to Andres Thomas in the ninth, 
the lead was only a run. 
</P>
<P>
Gossage walked Dion James but got Ron Gant on a fly to center and Geronimo 
Berroa on strikes for his third save. The clutch pitching enabled Reuschel, who 
recently turned 40, to extend his winning streak to seven games. His record is 
10-2. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell got his home runs off Tom Glavine (5-2). He hit a two-run shot in the 
third inning to put the leaders of the West in front to stay. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth, he hit a 440-foot blast that sent Glavine to the showers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had to start swinging softly, because the hands hurt," Mitchell said. 
"But maybe I've been swinging too hard, anyhow." 
</P>
<P>
One of the concessions Mitchell has made to the tenderness in his hands has 
been to stop taking batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I think maybe I was taking too much batting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With 17 home runs, Mitchell is now only five away from his career high in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
New York 3, Pittsburgh 2 -- Victories do not come easily these days for the 
Mets. In this victory at New York, only the third in their last 13 games, it 
appeared they had lost. 
</P>
<P>
A pinch single by Glenn Wilson in the top of the 11th gave the Pirates a 2-1 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Then, against new Pirate bullpen ace Randy Kramer in the bottom of the inning, 
Dave Magadan hit a two-run home run with one out to pull out the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 2, Philadelphia 1 -- The Phillies are not likely to soon forget the 
final play of Chris James as their third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
With two out in the top of the 13th inning and a runner on third, Andres 
Galarraga hit a bounder down the third-base line. James, normally an 
outfielder, made the stop but couldn't make a play at first, and the winning 
run scored. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the game in Philadelphia, James went to San Diego in a trade 
for a third baseman, Randy Ready. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 5, St. Louis 2 -- Rick Sutcliffe pitched a solid seven innings at St. 
Louis, and the Cubs won for the 12th time in their last 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
Sutcliffe (7-3), in winning his third in a row, had the Cardinals shut out 
until he needed relief in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals, losers of five straight, also lost another pitcher. Joe Magrane 
had to leave with one out in the seventh because of a bruised index finger on 
his left hand. DAN HAFNER

MILACKI'S TURNABOUT IS FAIR PLAY; ORIOLES' STREAK HITS FIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Although Jeff Ballard has emerged as the ace who has ignited the Baltimore 
Orioles' surprising drive to the top of the East, there was another young 
pitcher the organization had higher hopes for. 
</P>
<P>
And after a slow start, hard-throwing right-hander Bob Milacki is showing signs 
of coming to the top. 
</P>
<P>
Milacki gave up only two hits in 8 1/3 innings Friday night at Detroit as the 
Orioles won their fifth in a row, 4-1, to tighten their grip on first place. 
</P>
<P>
Milacki (3-5) gave up both hits, one a home run to Fred Lynn, in the fourth 
inning, then retired 15 consecutive batters. Kevin Hickey came in after Milacki 
issued his second walk with one out in the ninth and retired the last two 
batters for his second save. 
</P>
<P>
In his previous start Sunday against Cleveland, Milacki gave up two hits in 
eight innings but lost, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Orioles made sure in the third inning that Milacki, who will turn 
25 next month, didn't suffer from lack of support again. Larry Sheets singled 
in the first run, Rene Gonzales singled in what proved to be the winning run 
and Billy Ripken's double made it a three-run inning. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales was playing third base so that Manager Frank Robinson could let Craig 
Worthington take another day off. Thursday night, Jim Traber, giving Randy 
Milligan a night off, hit a three-run home run to spark the victory. Both 
Worthington and Milligan have minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Milacki spent four rather uneventful seasons in the lower minors in the 
Baltimore organization. He had a stressful spring training last year -- his car 
was stolen and he expected to be released at any moment. However, he developed 
a change-up, and the Orioles sent him back to Charlotte (N.C) of the Southern 
League for a last chance. 
</P>
<P>
In a startling reversal of form, Milacki streaked through the minor league 
system in 1988 with 15 victories. He closed out the season with two wins for 
the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
When asked last fall if Milacki was for real, Robinson answered, "We'll find 
out next season." 
</P>
<P>
Said Robinson Friday: "What I like about Milacki is he can go out there and get 
the ball over at any time. He's a pitcher. And this wasn't even his best 
outing. He pitched better the last time out." 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles are 28-22, the only team in the East this season that has been six 
games over .500. Last year, after opening with 21 consecutive losses, the 
Orioles didn't win their 28th until July 10. By that time they had lost 59 and 
were 25 games out of first place. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 8, Chicago 0 -- Manager Jeff Torborg is asking for patience with his 
faltering White Sox. After they lost their club-record 10th consecutive home 
game, maybe Torborg is having trouble with his own request. 
</P>
<P>
A charter member of the American League, the White Sox had never lost more than 
nine in a row at home. But Allan Anderson pitched a strong seven innings, and 
the Twins breezed after scoring two runs in the first and two more in the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox, who are 6-20 at home this season, have lost five in a row 
overall and 12 of their last 13. 
</P>
<P>
Carlton Fisk, out of the White Sox lineup since April 11 because of a broken 
hand, returned and went 1 for 3. 
</P>
<P>
New York 3, Milwaukee 2 -- Dave Righetti blew the save for rookie Clay Parker 
in the eighth inning at Milwaukee but wound up getting the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Pinch-hitter Tom Brookens singled in Steve Sax from third base with the winning 
run in the 10th inning. 
</P>
<P>
Righetti, who had not given up a run in his 14 previous appearances, came in 
after Parker held the Brewers to four hits in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
A leadoff walk to Jim Gantner started the tying rally. Robin Yount's squeeze 
bunt won it. 
</P>
<P>
Righetti was shaky in the 10th, too. He loaded the bases with two out before 
getting Greg Brock on a pop-up. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 7, Boston 2 -- Junior Felix got the first inside-the-park home run 
against the Red Sox in Boston since 1973 to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Felix hit a line drive to the base of the wall in center, and when the ball 
eluded Ellis Burks, he scored easily. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 9, Seattle 5 -- Two sets of consecutive home runs at Seattle powered the 
Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
In the third inning Ruben Sierra and Julio Franco hit home runs, and in the 
eighth, it was Chad Kreuter and Cecil Espy. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 5, Oakland 3 -- Joe Carter hit a two-run homer, and Cory Snyder ended 
a slump with a solo shot at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Carney Lansford, leading the league with a .356 average, left the game after 
five innings because of a strained left hamstring. Oakland already has lost 
Jose Canseco, Mark McGwire, Walt Weiss, Glenn Hubbard, Storm Davis and Dennis 
Eckersley to injuries for varying lengths of time this season. DAN HAFNER

COLLEGE WORLD SERIES;

FLORIDA STATE, WICHITA STATE WIN IN FIRST ROUND

<P>
With seven of the nation's 10 winningest pitchers present, this year's College 
World Series has been billed as "A Call to Arms." 
</P>
<P>
And as the eight-team tournament got under way Friday in warm, muggy weather, 
pitchers dominated as expected. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Florida State defeated North Carolina, 4-2, and Wichita State beat 
Arkansas, 3-1, before a crowd of 14,039 at Rosenblatt Stadium, where slugfests 
have been common. 
</P>
<P>
For the second year, the eight-team field is broken into East and West brackets 
that will be played with a double-elimination format. Winners of each bracket 
will advance to a one-game final June 10. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach (50-13) will play Texas (51-17), and Miami (48-16) will 
play Louisiana State (53-15) today in the first round of West Bracket games. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State (53-16) will play Wichita State (64-15), and North Carolina 
(41-17-1) will play Arkansas (50-15) in East Bracket games Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Wichita State Coach Gene Stephenson predicted that the hitting will intensify 
as the tournament progresses. 
</P>
<P>
"First-day jitters affect hitters more than pitchers," Stephenson said. 
</P>
<P>
However, unlike the regional playoffs, which feature consecutive-day playing 
schedules and doubleheaders that can drain a pitching staff, the World Series 
uses an every-other-day format that should keep top pitchers available. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State and Miami both have staff earned-run averages of under 3.00. 
Texas, at 4.26, is the only team with a staff ERA higher than 4.00. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his team's pitching depth, Florida State Coach Mike Martin was able 
to rest staff ace Clyde Keller (12-0, 2.63 ERA) and go instead with Gar 
Finnvold against the Tar Heels. 
</P>
<P>
Finnvold, a junior right-hander, gave up four hits and struck out five in 7 1/3 
innings to improve to 10-3. 
</P>
<P>
Finnvold gave up two hits and a run in the first, then yielded only one hit 
over the next six innings. 
</P>
<P>
"My slider was working real well," Finnvold said. "Once you get the slider 
over, that's a real confidence-builder. From then on I was able to spot my 
fastball." 
</P>
<P>
Florida State led, 4-1, when Finnvold gave way to Ricky Kimball with one out 
and runners at second and third in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball walked Tom Nevin to load the bases and Brad Woodall hit a sacrifice fly 
to center to make the score 4-2. Kimball then hit Ron Maurer to load the bases 
but North Carolina catcher Jesse Levis flied out to left, ending the threat. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball retired the side in order in the ninth to earn his ninth save. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina pitcher John Thoden (12-1) gave up six hits in 7 1/3 innings, 
including a second-inning home run by Florida State designated hitter Buddy 
Cribb that tied the score, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State went ahead, 3-1, in the third on Bob Reboin's single that scored 
Rocky Rau, who had singled to lead off the inning and moved to third on a 
double by Pedro Grifol. Brian Gilliland then grounded into a double play, 
enabling Grifol to score. 
</P>
<P>
The Seminoles scored their final run in the seventh when Rob Bargas scored from 
third on an errant pick-off throw by Levis. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game, Wichita State starter Greg Brummett (16-2), a senior 
All-American right-hander, gave up only four hits in 7 1/3 innings before 
giving way to Jim Newlin, who earned his nation-leading 16th save. 
</P>
<P>
"My fastball kept me in the game," said Brummett, who lasted only 1 1/3 innings 
against Arkansas in February in the Shockers' season-opener. "I moved it in on 
them, making them pound it into the ground." 
</P>
<P>
The Shockers scored first, in the fourth inning when Jim Audley hit a two-run 
homer off starter Mark Swope (7-1), who gave up five hits and struck out five 
in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas scored its only run in the sixth when Greg D'Alexander hit a Brummett 
slider over the left-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Meares scored Wichita State's final run, in the eighth, when he came home 
from third on a wild pitch by reliever Mike Oquist. 
</P>
<P>
College World Series Notes 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach Coach Dave Snow was selected as coach of the year by the 
newspaper Collegiate Baseball. Snow led Long Beach to a 50-13 record and its 
first berth in the College World Series after last season's 14-45 finish. . . . 
Snow is the fourth head coach to bring two different teams to the World Series. 
In 1986, Snow led Loyola Marymount to Omaha. . . . Andy Croghan (12-0, 3.09 
ERA), a freshman right-hander from Yorba Linda, will start tonight for Long 
Beach against Texas. Sophomore right-hander Kirk Dressendorfer (16-2, 2.46) 
will start for the Longhorns. . . . Junior left-hander Kyle Abbott (15-2, 2.37) 
will start for Long Beach on Monday against either Miami or Louisiana State, 
who play each other tonight.

<P>
The first round of qualifying for American speedway motorcycle riders that 
ultimately leads to the World Championship event is scheduled for 8 tonight on 
the quarter-mile track at Long Beach Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The race, the Nissan American Final, pits riders competing overseas in the 
British Speedway League against nine local riders plus two Canadians in 20 
heats. Each rider will race in five heats, with four points awarded for a win, 
three points for second, two points for third and one point for fourth. 
</P>
<P>
The top four scoring riders will advance to the Overseas Final June 25 at Belle 
Vue, England. The World Final is scheduled Sept. 9 at Munich, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Ermolenko of Cypress, who has won at Long Beach three straight years, was a 
full second faster than any other rider in a practice session Tuesday. 
Ermolenko has qualified for three straight appearances in the World 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Moran of Huntington Beach is the leading rider in the British Speedway 
League and is among the favorites but he has been suspended from all World 
Championship competition by the American Motorcyclist Assn. after testing 
positive for alcohol at a race in Denmark last month. 
</P>
<P>
Moran's brother, Kelly, was also scheduled to compete but withdrew after 
breaking the little finger on his right hand in a crash last Saturday and will 
be replaced by reserve Eddie Castro.

1 DIES, OTHERS HURT AS WIND TOPPLES 2 CHURCH STEEPLES

FITCHBURG, Mass.

<TEXT>
<P>
Fierce 70-m.p.h. wind tore through central and eastern Massachusetts on Friday, 
tearing roofs off buildings and killing a woman when a church steeple toppled 
onto her car. 
</P>
<P>
A second church steeple also was felled by the wind, which accompanied a line 
of thunderstorms that uprooted dozens of trees and utility poles, cutting off 
electricity to thousands of customers in many towns. 
</P>
<P>
"The city's in quite rough shape. We got one fatality, the car that got crushed 
by the church steeple," said Fitchburg Mayor Jeffrey Bean, who declared a state 
of emergency following the brief storm. 
</P>
<P>
"It's incredible. I've never seen anything like it before. Debris was just 
blowing by the window," said Rick Gulino, a spokesman for the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
In Fitchburg, the hardest-hit community, steeples fell from the First Parish 
Unitarian Universalist Church, built in 1837, and the Faith United Church, both 
located along the Upper Common on Main Street, which was flooded by the storm. 
</P>
<P>
The steeple from the Unitarian church landed on the car, killing Sandra R. 
Cressey, 53. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Burbank Hospital said at least eight people were treated for 
injuries stemming from the storm. Most of the injuries were caused by the 
toppled Unitarian church steeple, including injuries to a mother and her three 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities evacuated 200 people from a 14-story senior citizens high-rise 
because part of the roof came off and the wall was cracked. The roof on the 
Sanitoy factory, which makes toys for children, also was blown off. 
</P>
<P>
Substantial damage also was reported in nearby communities, including Gardner 
and Leominster, and there was widespread damage in the Boston area before the 
storm swept out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service in Boston reported that the winds exceeded 70 
m.p.h., but the storm was not classified as a tornado. 
</P>
<P>
"We have spoken to people there, meteorologists, who say it's more in the 
nature of a micro-burst, a down-burst, than a tornado," said Gene Auciello, a 
meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no funnel cloud on radar, no eyewitness observation of a funnel 
cloud," he said. "The damage reported, to the upper stories of buildings, is 
more characteristic of a down-burst."

<P>
Iraq is building a $45-million clock in Baghdad, featuring gold-plated hands 
and a 141-foot pendulum, the Iraqi News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
The 167-foot clock tower is rising in the Harithiya district, overlooking the 
highway connecting downtown Baghdad with the international airport, the 
official news agency said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
At the base of the tower will be a museum, shopping mall, restaurants and 
conference halls, the report said. The ground floor of the building will be 
reserved for statues depicting major events in the "heroic life" of President 
Saddam Hussein, starting with his birth, it added. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounding the building will be 23 water fountains, lawns and rose gardens 
covering an area of 15 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
The clock will have hands coated in gold donated to the government by "the 
brave Iraqi women" during the eight-year war with Iran, the news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
In memory of the war dead, a crystal ball "filled with samples of the weapons 
used by our martyrs in defense of their homeland" will be attached to the end 
of the pendulum, the report said.

Ron Lee has never mounted a Brahman bull but he does ride another large type of 
beast: a 25-ton, fully loaded garbage truck in Los Angeles gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
So Friday, the 28-year-old Lee came to San Diego to compete in a rodeo. . . . 
That's ROAD-E-O. 
</P>
<P>
Lee was among 10 trash-truck drivers who met on the parking lot pavement at San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium to determine the top truck handlers in the second 
annual Southern California Regional Refuse Driver's ROAD-E-O. 
</P>
<P>
But, rather than compete with testy commuters, tight alleys or tots on 
tricycles, drivers faced a slew of obstacles that proved just as harrying. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wrestled With Big Rigs 
</P>
<P>
Donning work boots and khakis, the drivers maneuvered big diesel rigs 
(unloaded, they weigh about 15 tons) over a course marked by fluorescent pylons 
and barricades. 
</P>
<P>
Seven categories tested drivers' prowess in various situations, including 
cornering, backing and parallel parking. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes barricades tumbled and clattered loudly, to the groans of supporters 
who watched when a driver miscalculated by less than an inch. 
</P>
<P>
Other times, however, the only sound was the high-pitched burst from air brakes 
or the clang of a warning bell when drivers backed up trucks perfectly into 
tight spots. 
</P>
<P>
The winners Friday of the three categories -- front loader, side loader and 
back loader -- will go on to Tulsa, Okla. to compete in August in the 
international ROAD-E-O with drivers from the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Each man (none of the women drivers made the cut) had to win competitions in 
their own cities. Besides San Diego and Los Angeles, drivers also came from 
Newport Beach and Santa Monica. The competitors also had to have perfect 
driving records and good attendance. 
</P>
<P>
The event was an opportunity for unsung heroes, who hoist tons of rubbish 
daily, to be recognized. Repeated lifting takes a nasty toll on drivers' backs 
and shoulders, said Ernie Anderson, deputy director of refuse collection for 
San Diego. Anderson said that, in the peak summer months, trash collectors lift 
as much as 15 tons daily. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries among drivers on the job are common. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, last year's winner, Bernie Helton, had to bow out of the 
competition after hurting his shoulder this week. 
</P>
<P>
The injury may have been a setback for Helton, but for Albert Villa of San 
Diego it meant a victory and a bonus: a day off. 
</P>
<P>
Villa, 27, won the front-loader competition. He said he was scheduled to work a 
route in Scripps Ranch, but got the nod after Helton was felled. 
</P>
<P>
"I sweat as much today as I would have if I had worked," he joked. "The 
pressure was on this morning." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, Jesus Ruano of Santa Monica nervously smoked a cigarette while watching 
another driver navigate the course, which took about 10 to 12 minutes to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
As the driver knocked over a barrel, Ruano said, "You've got to take your time 
and relax.". 
</P>
<P>
But, behind the wheel of a shiny white and orange rig with Armor All on the 
tires, Ruano tensed up, nicking a few obstacles. He finished fourth in the 
back-loader category. 
</P>
<P>
"I did my best," he shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
Two other San Diegans won their divisions: Danny Munoz in the side-loader and 
Ron Garcia in the back-loader. 
</P>
<P>
One judge on the course said the competition reinforces the importance of the 
garbage collectors' job. 
</P>
<P>
"When they drive through neighborhoods, the kids can look up to them as someone 
to admire and respect," said Donald Reese, a San Diego refuse supervisor, who 
drove a trash truck for five years. 
</P>
<P>
"You're the one who has to do all the decision making. . . . You can't hit a 
vehicle or anything else."

DONALD BALLMAN, FORMER DOW CHIEF, ARTS PATRON, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donald K. Ballman, a former Dow Chemical executive, arts patron and longtime La 
Jolla resident, died Wednesday at his daughter's home in Hinsdale, Ill. He was 
79. 
</P>
<P>
Before his retirement from Dow Chemical Co. in 1973, Ballman's life had been 
dedicated almost completely to the company. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, his hobby was his business," said Robert L. Keyser III, 
Ballman's son-in-law. "He was committed to Dow." 
</P>
<P>
Ballman joined Dow Chemical as a sales trainee and rose to senior executive 
vice president and the board of directors during his 36-year career with the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
He organized and managed the technical service and development departments, and 
he established Dow's marketing research department, which introduced Saran 
Wrap, the company's first consumer product, in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
After he moved to La Jolla in 1973 from Midland, Mich., with his wife, 
Elizabeth, he became a world traveler and a patron of the La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art. He was president and a trustee of the museum, treasurer and a 
board member for the Scripps Clinic &amp; Research Foundation and a member of 
the La Jolla Rotary Club. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a born leader, but he also had a very artistic, sensitive side," said 
Hugh Davies, director of the La Jolla museum. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Marston, a friend of Ballman's for more than 15 years, said, "He was a smart 
cookie. I think he was quite a financial man. He always followed the blue-chip 
companies. He was never for this fly-by-night stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Ballman was born in Indiana in 1910, and he received bachelor and master of 
science degrees in chemistry from Indiana University, which he entered at age 
15. 
</P>
<P>
Ballman's wife died in February. He is survived by his daughter, Brenda Ballman 
Keyser, and his grandchildren, Elise and Hanni Keyser. The family has asked 
that any contributions be made in his memory to the Ballman Building Fund at 
the museum.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEIGHBORHOOD WINS ON ZONING ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the urging of local residents who sought to preserve their neighborhood's 
character, the Torrance City Council has voted to rezone a two-block 
neighborhood from multifamily to single-family zoning. 
</P>
<P>
In a petition to the Planning Department, 21 residents near Border Avenue and 
San Ardo Street asked for the zone change to ban apartment buildings and 
condominiums. There are 26 single-family houses on the two blocks. 
</P>
<P>
The change will take effect June 29. There was no opposition to Tuesday's 
council action. 
</P>
<P>
Residents have told city officials that they oppose the density that apartment 
buildings have brought to surrounding neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar situation last month, 16 residents of the 1000 block of Amapola 
Avenue asked the city to declare the block a historic overlay district. 
Residents said they feared that without the historic zoning, developers would 
replace older homes with condominiums and apartments. The council instead 
approved a zone change that requires a public hearing before any construction 
takes place on that block.

OFFICIALS GIVE SURVIVORS' ACCOUNT OF JULIAN GOLD MINING SHOOT-OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After days of investigating in almost total silence a shoot-out between two 
bands of gold miners on the outskirts of Julian, authorities Friday released a 
detailed account -- as told by the survivors -- describing hostile exchanges 
between the groups that preceded a staccato burst of gunfire that left two men 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies investigating the Memorial Day shooting, which occurred 6 
miles east of Julian, revealed that the dueling groups -- an East County family 
and two Julian men -- were both heavily armed with weapons, including an AK-47 
semiautomatic assault rifle, shotguns and high-powered rifles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One-Sided Version 
</P>
<P>
The shooting is reminiscent of days gone by, when prospectors quarreled 
violently over mineral claims in Julian, a 19th-Century gold mining town. 
Residents and investigators are searching for an accurate account of what 
happened amid rumors and speculation. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the shooting remains shrouded in questions. Deputies' investigations 
have been limited, since only one version of the gun battle exists -- the one 
provided by the East County family. The two Julian men, Edward (Joe) John 
Lopes, 66, and Christopher Mark Zerbe, 34, were both killed. There were no 
independent witnesses to the shooting to corroborate the survivor's tale, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have refused to release the complete names of the survivors, 
claiming disclosure could jeopardize the family's safety and possibly 
compromise investigations. No one has been charged or arrested in the incident, 
said Lt. John Tenwolde of the sheriff's homicide unit. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, investigators released a summary account of the shoot-out, compiled 
from interviews with the seven survivors. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a summary statement about the incident as provided by the family," 
Tenwolde said. "It is also reflective of the evidence we discovered at the 
scene, and it also includes information provided from the coroner's office." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
And the Story . . . 
</P>
<P>
According to authorities, the East County family arrived at the federal-owned 
mining site Monday afternoon to picnic, shoot target practice and explore what 
they said was their mining claim. Once at the site, the family encountered 
Lopes and Zerbe, who insisted that the family was trespassing. Zerbe was 
caretaker of the site for two businessmen, who also hold claims in the area. 
</P>
<P>
During an ensuing debate over who had a legitimate right to be on the property, 
the two Julian men were profane and belligerent, the family claimed. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute ended after the Lopes and Zerbe inspected the family's papers 
showing they had claim to the property. But, as the family entered the 
property, Zerbe allegedly threatened, "Go ahead, but don't touch my (stuff) or 
we'll bury you, and we've got people who will back us up." 
</P>
<P>
Later that day, a female East County group member's movement on the property 
angered the Julian men, who reportedly fired upon the family. The East County 
group retaliated and killed Lopes and Zerbe. No one from the family was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. John Eisele, the county deputy medical examiner who conducted 
the autopsies of the Julian men, Zerbe was struck with six bullets, causing two 
superficial wounds in the head and penetrating wounds, one each, in the chest, 
right knee, right foot and left hip. Lopes was hit twice, producing wounds in 
the head and chest. 
</P>
<P>
Toxicology tests were also conducted to determine whether Lopes and Zerbe were 
under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time, Eisele said. Those test 
results and complete coroner's report are expected in about a month, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Little progress has been made in substantiating the East County family's 
version of the shooting, Tenwolde said. 
</P>
<P>
"Thus far, we are not succeeding in getting a conclusive answer," Tenwolde 
said. "But we are approaching this investigation and trying to get all the 
relevant data so that we can submit the most complete account to the district 
attorney. If someone can provide us with any new information, we would love to 
talk to them." 
</P>
<P>
With few new leads to pursue, authorities have taken to reviewing available 
information with a fine-toothed comb. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators still refuse to release the East County family's name, but did 
disclose the participants' first names on Friday. The cast of characters, 
according to authorities: Gus, 41; his wife, Mary, 41; their son, Matthew, 20; 
their daughter, Heather, 16; and friends, Roberto, 19; Todd, 24; and Brandy, 
14. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 7 p.m. Monday -- several hours after the two group's ominous 
first encounter -- Gus noticed that a vehicle had driven into the area, 
stopping within 200 feet of where he and his wife stood. Trees and foliage 
obscured their view of the vehicle and its occupants, but the couple said they 
heard voices yelling. 
</P>
<P>
While picking up trash and debris, Mary told authorities, she heard a man yell, 
"That's not placer, God damn it!" (Placer is a deposit of gravel or sand in 
water that contains heavy ore minerals, such as gold or platinum.) Then, she 
said, she was fired upon. As she ran for cover behind the couple's motor home, 
Gus moved behind a nearby tree and readied his AK-47. 
</P>
<P>
During the commotion, Gus said he heard yells which sounded like "I'm going to 
kill you" and "I killed him." Meanwhile, Matthew, Roberto, Heather and Brandy, 
who were target-shooting elsewhere with a .22-caliber rifle, 12-gauge shotgun, 
9.2-millimeter rifle and a 9-millimeter pistol, came to the couple's aid. Todd 
was on a nearby hillside. 
</P>
<P>
After a bullet allegedly whizzed by Roberto, the others (Gus, Matthew, Roberto 
and Todd) retaliated simultaneously, firing at the truck. The driver's door of 
the vehicle opened and Zerbe fell out, mortally wounded. He was clutching a 
30-30, lever-action rifle. Lopes lay slumped in the passenger seat; at his side 
rested a double-barreled 12-gauge shotgun. The family then sent several members 
to get help. Emergency medical personnel summoned to the site could not 
resuscitate Lopes and Zerbe. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the weapons found with Lopes and Zerbe, authorities recovered a 30-06 
rifle and a 12-gauge pop shotgun and ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Establishing a Claim 
</P>
<P>
As the investigation continues, Tenwolde said, officials will try to determine 
"who or who all had a right to be on the site." He said the East County family 
showed investigators papers documenting their claim to the land. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't doubt the papers' authenticity at all," Tenwolde said. 
</P>
<P>
But an Encino businessman, Benjamin Haimes, and his associate, James Tweedy, a 
Van Nuys attorney, say Zerbe was entrusted to watch their 25 claims, including 
where the shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the California office of the federal Bureau of Land 
Management confirmed that Haimes indeed has claims to the area. All mining 
claims on public land must be filed with the BLM office. 
</P>
<P>
But BLM officials said it is possible that both groups had claims to the land.

ARIE DE JONG, 88; PATRIARCH OF N. COUNTY DAIRY FAMILY, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arie De Jong, the 88-year-old patriarch of a family of dairy farmers and 
president of Hollandia Dairy, died Friday at his home in Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
De Jong, the oldest of 18 children, came to the United States in 1949 from the 
Netherlands with his wife, Maartge, and 10 children. 
</P>
<P>
His family worked in different dairies until they raised enough money to open 
Hollandia Dairy in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
The dairy employs 200 people, and in an area of 125 acres produces 60,000 
gallons of milk a day from about 1,000 cows. 
</P>
<P>
De Jong came from a long tradition of dairy farmers when he was born May 5, 
1901, and, although he had only had six years of formal schooling, he became a 
prominent and respected member of the Escondido community. 
</P>
<P>
"He did not have book learning, but he had other kinds of learning," said Klaas 
Dehaan, a controller at the dairy who had known De Jong since 1958. "He was a 
good man. He was very optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
De Jong enjoyed taking care of the cows in the dairy more than he enjoyed 
performing the administrative duties of his position as president, Dehaan said. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, De Jong opposed the German occupation of the Netherlands 
and "he made sure that the family and the people around him had plenty to eat," 
said Tom De Jong, 63, De Jong's oldest son. "He came to America because he 
loved this country, and it was a better opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
De Jong is survived by his wife, seven sons, three daughters, 54 grandchildren 
and 36 great-grandchildren.

WILKENING ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL ON 18 COUNTS IN CALL-GIRL CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Karen Wilkening was ordered Friday to stand trial on 18 counts of pimping and 
pandering in connection with a call-girl operation that catered to some 
prominent San Diegans. 
</P>
<P>
Ten counts of pimping and pandering were dismissed at the conclusion of the 
four-day preliminary hearing by San Diego Municipal Judge Lisa Guy-Schall. The 
dismissed counts include those involving witnesses who failed to show up, 
including two counts involving civil attorney Wesley Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, 56, was hospitalized early Friday for high blood pressure on the eve of 
his testimony about his contact with Wilkening, 43. Harris failed to show up 
Tuesday or Wednesday in response to a subpoena, and a $5,000 warrant was issued 
for his arrest. He showed up Thursday afternoon with his attorney, Nelson Brav, 
but was not called to testify. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In the Hospital 
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, Brav informed the court that Harris had to be hospitalized 
before the start of proceedings. He said Harris' doctor feared that his client 
might suffer a stroke or a heart attack if required to testify about his 
dealings with Wilkening. 
</P>
<P>
The claim prompted a dubious Guy-Schall to confer with Harris' doctor, but she 
later declared in court that the sudden illness appeared to be real. 
</P>
<P>
Before Friday's hearing, Harris wrote a series of rambling letters to the 
district attorney's office, asking that he not be required to testify in 
public, claiming "my reputation will be ruined and my family will be 
embarrassed." Harris also claimed he had information that could embarrass the 
district attorney's office -- information that might affect Dist. Atty. Edwin 
Miller's reelection bid. 
</P>
<P>
His letter also stated that the list of Wilkening's customers had been 
"sanitized" to omit the names of judges, police officers and members of the 
media, and that the action against Wilkening is designed to embarrass 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
The civil law specialist also wrote a page titled "personal beliefs of Wesley 
Harris," in which he promoted legalized prostitution, claiming that it reduces 
rape. 
</P>
<P>
Guy-Schall, who commented in court that part of Harris' letter could be 
construed as extortion, scheduled a contempt of court hearing for the attorney 
on Tuesday because of his failure to appear as a witness on Tuesday and 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Also testifying Friday was Jeffrey Benter, who said Wilkening arranged for him 
to have sex with women whom he paid $100. 
</P>
<P>
National City car dealer Tony McCune testified Wednesday that he was a customer 
of the call-girl ring. In addition, a tape played in court identified "I Love 
Lucy" star Desi Arnaz as a Wilkening client. Arnaz died in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
A trial date will be set at Wilkening's arraignment June 16. 
</P>
<P>
In another court action, a preliminary hearing on charges that Wilkening 
conspired to obstruct justice is scheduled for Wednesday. The charges stem from 
her flight to the Philippines to avoid prosecution on the pimping and pandering 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Her former defense lawyer, Buford Wiley Jr., is also charged with aiding her 
flight before a 1987 preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkening is being held in jail on both cases in lieu of $4 million bail.

ALAR CONTENT OF APPLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On April 20 an article by Maura Dolan, Times environmental writer, headlined 
"Alar Found in Apples at Four Upscale Markets," appeared in the Metro Section. 
The article highlights that apples purchased at Mrs. Gooch's purportedly were 
found in independent tests to contain Alar, a potentially hazardous chemical. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Gooch's was informed of the Times article before it went to print. Upon 
receiving that information, Mrs. Gooch's, among other things, determined to 
send the same apples out to two different laboratories for testing. 
</P>
<P>
The Lederman Group, acting on behalf of Mrs. Gooch's, hired Anresco, Inc. (the 
same lab used by The Times) to test the apples from the same supplier and lot 
number tested by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Alar analysis on the four samples of apples provided to the 
Lederman Group from Anresco showed a radically different result than those 
reported by The Times. A chart comparing the Anresco results for The Times and 
the Anresco results for Mrs. Gooch's, both using the same method of analysis, 
PAM II, is set forth below.

The Alar analysis performed by the second laboratory confirmed the results of 
the Anresco tests prepared for Mrs. Gooch's. 
</P>
<P>
Based on information we have received from experts in the field of Alar 
testing, we are at a loss to understand how The Times could have reported that 
Rome Beauty apples sold by Mrs. Gooch's had an Alar content in excess of 9 ppm. 
Samples which assay to 9 ppm are extremely unusual. A sample that high should 
have caused Anresco to recheck it. 
</P>

We have always been dedicated to providing our customers with the finest, most 
natural, wholesome, foods available. This commitment to excellence includes

LAWSUIT ACCUSES ENCINO APARTMENT OPERATORS OF NOT RENTING TO BLACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Operators of an Encino apartment complex who allegedly refused to rent to 
blacks have been accused of racial discrimination by the Fair Housing Congress 
of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Beaumont Property Management Co. and its employees are named in a Los Angeles 
Superior Court lawsuit served last week. 
</P>
<P>
According to the lawsuit, the manager of the 60-unit Casa Verde apartment 
complex at 5500 Newcastle Ave. refused to rent to four different prospective 
black tenants who responded to ads for furnished one-bedroom apartments last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Each was told that no apartments were available. But shortly after each 
rejection, prospective white tenants were invited to inspect apartments that 
they were told were available, according to the complaint filed with the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Beaumont officials were unavailable for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accusation Denied 
</P>
<P>
But Jean B. Katowsky, manager of the Encino complex and who is named as a 
defendant in the lawsuit, denied the accusation. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never do that," Katowsky said. "I have black people living in three 
apartments in the building right now. I have preached ever since I can remember 
that everybody is alike, and everybody's blood is red." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the state's Fair Employment and Housing Commission said the suit 
marks the fourth time that Beaumont Property Management has faced 
discrimination complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The firm paid $20,000 in damages in July to a racially mixed couple turned down 
when they tried to rent an apartment at a Harvard Boulevard complex that 
Beaumont manages in the Hollywood area, said Gloria A. Barrios, an attorney for 
the state Department of Fair Employment and Housing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints Settled 
</P>
<P>
On two earlier occasions, Beaumont settled discrimination complaints filed by 
the department "for nominal amounts," Barrios said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of last year's case, Beaumont was ordered by an administrative judge to 
promise in its advertising that it adhered to "equal housing" guidelines for 
the Harvard Boulevard complex. The firm was also required to allow monitoring 
by fair housing advocates and to teach its managers the law, Barrios said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised they're in trouble again," she said. "You'd think they'd be 
attempting not to discriminate in the future." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit prompted by the Encino incidents was filed for the Fair Housing 
Congress by lawyers for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Responded to Ad 
</P>
<P>
It was triggered when prospective renter Nathan Beams responded to an ad for an 
apartment and was informed by Katowsky that all units had been rented, 
according to the complaint. Four days later, Beams noticed another ad that 
stated one-bedroom apartments were available but was again told none was 
vacant, the complaint stated. 
</P>
<P>
After that, the Fair Housing Congress tested Casa Verde by sending in black 
mock applicants followed by whites, according to the lawsuit. In each instance, 
the blacks were turned down, but the whites were offered $600-per-month 
rentals, the lawsuit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Patrick O. Patterson said the suit seeks a court order that would 
prohibit racial discrimination at the Encino complex in the future. It is also 
seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges that Beaumont has violated both state and federal 
anti-discrimination laws.

COUNTY TO FILE CHARGES OVER CONSTRUCTION OF POLO FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County prosecutors will file criminal charges against officials of 
a Sherman Oaks development company that constructed a polo field in a rugged 
Calabasas canyon without county approval, the district attorney's office said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Misdemeanor complaints will be sought against executives of the Lycon Group who 
were responsible for bulldozing the canyon and building a regulation-sized polo 
field, corrals, a barn and a small grandstand, said Mike Noyes, a deputy 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The equestrian facility -- dubbed the "Calabasas Polo Club" by Lycon officials 
-- is a few hundred yards north of the Ventura Freeway, midway between Parkway 
Calabasas and Las Virgenes Road. 
</P>
<P>
County building inspectors contend that the polo complex was constructed 
without building or grading permits, which are required by law. County 
officials say the project was discovered by accident in March when a building 
inspector checking on a nearby residential project noticed the construction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wrongdoing Denied 
</P>
<P>
Lycon Group officials have denied wrongdoing, blaming an unnamed county 
employee they say told them that no permit was needed. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Department of Public Works, which oversees building inspectors, 
called for criminal action when Lycon officials applied for permits after the 
polo complex was built. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said about 35,000 cubic yards of earth were bulldozed from a hillside 
and piled in the canyon to make room for the facility, decorated with fancy 
"Calabasas Polo Club" signs. 
</P>
<P>
"The D.A. will proceed to file criminal complaints," said Jean Granucci, a 
public works spokeswoman. "We will continue to review the plans the developer 
has now submitted. That will probably take about a month or more, particularly 
because of this situation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Misdemeanor Offense 
</P>
<P>
County officials say it is a misdemeanor to build or grade without proper 
permits. Such offenses are punishable by a $1,000 fine or a six-month jail 
term. 
</P>
<P>
Granucci said Friday that building inspectors plan to pay close attention to a 
grading plan that Lycon submitted this week to the county's building and safety 
office in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
A representative of the civil engineering company that prepared the plan 
acknowledged that it was drawn up after the bulldozing took place. 
</P>
<P>
According to Granucci, county officials will demand that the site be re-graded 
if Lycon cannot prove that a licensed soils engineer was present during every 
step of the earthmoving process. Re-grading would require demolition of the 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, she said, normal grading and building permit fees will be doubled 
for Lycon as a penalty for the company's retroactive permit applications. The 
building permit fee has not been calculated, but the doubled grading fee will 
come to $2,456. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to file criminal complaints came after Noyes met privately 
Wednesday with building and safety officials and a Lycon representative. 
</P>
<P>
Noyes was unavailable for comment Friday, and Lycon officials refused to 
discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, however, Lycon Group partner Rob Franciscan blamed the illegal 
construction on bad advice received from an unknown building inspector. He said 
his firm was naive about the permit process because "we're home builders," not 
developers of horse facilities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Permit Not Required' 
</P>
<P>
"We were told a permit was not required," Franciscan said. "We were told that 
we didn't need a permit because we weren't building a habitable structure. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, some building inspector said we need a permit. At that point, 
we did some additional checking and found that, in fact, we did receive some 
incorrect information."

HOMEOWNERS VOTE TO PAY $123,000 IN SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of a Thousand Oaks homeowners association agreed Friday to pay a 
developer $123,000 to settle a lawsuit in which a federal judge awarded the 
builder $688,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
About 76%, or 181 of the 237 members of the Westlake North Property Owners 
Assn. who voted, approved settlement with the Lang Ranch Co., one of two 
developers of the 2,500-acre Lang Ranch. Twenty-seven members opposed the 
settlement, and 29 abstained. Fifty-seven percent of the association's 413 
members participated in the election. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement followed months of negotiations with Lang Ranch Co. and ended 
homeowners' fears that the association's assets, including a community center 
on an acre of land, would be seized. But it alarmed some slow-growth activists 
who said it would discourage homeowners from challenging developers in court. 
</P>
<P>
"It's regrettable that the homeowners have been so cowed by the developers," 
said Gerald A. Silver, director of the Alliance to Control Development in 
California, a coalition of 1,200 homeowner groups. "What'll happen is 
developers will be encouraged to go after other homeowners who sue them for 
legitimate reasons." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Best Solution' 
</P>
<P>
Rick Dixon, president of the Westlake North group, said the vote "is not a 
statement about the validity of the developer's position or of the monetary 
sanctions the judge imposed. It's just the best solution to a bad situation." 
</P>
<P>
The damages, believed to be among the highest ever imposed on a homeowner 
group, were awarded in February by U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian Jr., 
who dismissed a suit filed by the association against a 2,257-unit housing 
project. Saying the suit was frivolous and cost the developers unnecessary 
legal fees and other costs, Tevrizian ordered the association and its attorneys 
to pay $735,000 to Lang Ranch Co. and Anden Group, the other developer. 
</P>
<P>
The five directors of the homeowner association voted two weeks ago to settle 
the case instead of pursuing it in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The 
election was conducted at a meeting that began Thursday and ended early Friday 
at the association's community center on Westlake Boulevard at Valley Spring 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said the association will pay the $123,000 over five years by dipping 
into its general fund or by voting to impose a special assessment on members. 
He declined to reveal how much money is in the group's general fund or whether 
members can resign to escape an assessment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Close to Agreement 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said the homeowners are "very close" to reaching agreement with Anden 
Group, which was awarded $47,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the association said the group owes its attorneys between $35,000 
and $40,000 in fees. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Hamilton, an attorney for Lang Ranch Co., said the firm will still hold 
Shelby Moore and Teresa Hooks, the association's attorneys, liable for the 
remaining $565,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said he and Hooks have appealed the damages rather than negotiate a 
settlement because they are confident that they will win. 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general's office will file a brief in support of Moore and 
Hooks because it is concerned about the chilling effect that the damages would 
have on other homeowners and their attorneys, Assistant Atty. Gen. Antonette 
Cordero said. She said her office had also planned to support the association 
if it had pursued the case. She declined to comment on the settlement.

<P>
New Spending Bill 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 227 to 197, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 2072) to 
increase spending this fiscal year by $3.7 billion. The so-called dire 
emergency supplemental bill funds several programs that are running out of 
money and others that are politically popular. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats generally defended the spending as necessary to keep vital programs 
in operation, while most Republicans complained the bill violates 
deficit-reduction agreements. President Bush has threatened a veto. 
</P>
<P>
Major outlays are $1.2 billion for veterans, $892 million for student loans, 
$822 million for anti-drug initiatives, $423 million for foster care and $342 
million for fighting last year's forest fires. The bill also provides more 
money for the homeless and unemployed, legislative branch operations and 
agencies such as the Agriculture Department and Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Jamie Whitten (D-Miss.) said, "Give us this bill, which takes care of 
drugs, which takes care of veterans. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Silvio Conte (R-Mass.) said, "Here we go again, spending as if there 
were no tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

GOP Substitute 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 205 to 217, the House rejected a Republican attempt to strip the 
$3.7-billion appropriations bill (above) of all spending except $1.2 billion 
for veterans programs including medical care. The motion expressed GOP and 
White House complaints that the Democratic majority was using popular veterans 
spending to run interference for unwarranted increases this fiscal year in 
other programs. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Gerald Solomon (R-N.Y.) said: "The veterans package is still being 
used as the engine to drive this monstrosity through the Congress." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Neal Smith (D-Iowa), said members voting yes "are voting against 
enhancing and speeding up the war on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted the bill to fund only veterans programs.

New Spending Bill 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 227 to 197, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 2072) to 
increase spending this fiscal year by $3.7 billion. The so-called "dire 
emergency supplemental bill" funds several programs that are running out of 
money and others that are politically popular. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats generally defended the spending as necessary to keep vital programs 
in operation, while most Republicans complained the bill violates 
deficit-reduction agreements. President Bush has threatened a veto. 
</P>
<P>
Major outlays are $1.2 billion for veterans, $892 million for student loans, 
$822 million for anti-drug initiatives, $423 million for foster care and $342 
million for fighting last year's forest fires. The bill also provides more 
money for the homeless and unemployed, legislative branch operations and 
agencies such as the Agriculture Department and Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Jamie Whitten (D-Miss.) said, "Give us this bill, which takes care of 
drugs, which takes care of veterans. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Silvio Conte (R-Mass.) said, "Here we go again, spending as if there 
were no tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRANSIENT GETS 35-YEAR PRISON TERM IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A35-year-old transient was sentenced by a San Fernando Superior Court judge to 
35 years to life in prison for the shooting death of a Burbank prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Leon Martinez was convicted last month of first-degree murder in the 
Dec. 2 killing of 22-year-old Camela Dawn Szafranscki, who authorities said 
worked as a prostitute after she moved to Southern California from Michigan in 
April, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
She was missing for 10 days before her boyfriend discovered her body in a 
Granada Hills office building, Deputy Dist. Atty. Sue G. Lasicka said. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez was arrested four days after the slaying when police pulled him over 
for a traffic violation in the same area and discovered that he was driving the 
woman's car, Lasicka said. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, Martinez was wearing a bloodstained shirt at the 
time of his arrest and had bloody panties and jewels later identified as 
belonging to the victim.

MAN HAD ESCAPED FROM CANADA; 
</P>
<P>
KILLER SENTENCED OVER HANDGUN THEFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A confessed killer who escaped from a mental hospital in Canada was sentenced 
Friday to two years in state prison for stealing handguns, ammunition and 
knives from a North Hollywood outdoor supply store. 
</P>
<P>
But authorities said they will ask U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service 
agents to deport Giovanni Fasciano, 27, before he begins his prison term. 
Fasciano has repeatedly admitted that in 1980 he killed his mother with an ax, 
according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
Fasciano was arrested by Los Angeles police Sept. 27 while attempting to steal 
more than 20 handguns, hunting knives and ammunition from Western Surplus at 
5209 Lankershim Blvd. Police said Fasciano triggered the burglar alarm when he 
broke through the building's roof. He was found inside the store, with the 
weapons stashed in duffel bags. 
</P>
<P>
Fasciano pleaded guilty to charges of burglary and theft in San Fernando 
Superior Court last month. 
</P>
<P>
After his arrest, authorities learned that Fasciano had escaped from a Montreal 
hospital for the criminally insane in May, 1988. Fasciano was committed to the 
hospital by Canadian authorities in 1980, after he killed his mother and 
chopped up her body, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Living in North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
He told authorities that he had been living in a North Hollywood apartment 
since his escape. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Ken Barshop and Deputy Public Defender Tim Murphy, 
Fasciano's attorney, said they believe that Fasciano should be returned to the 
Canadian mental hospital to receive medical attention. They said local 
taxpayers should not have to pay for his incarceration here. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said that Fasciano is eager to return to the hospital and that he left 
only to take a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian authorities are unwilling to pay to extradite Fasciano, which means 
that U.S. officials will have to escort him to Canada, Judge John P. Farrell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell said he could not arrange for Fasciano's deportation, so instead he 
sentenced him to two years in prison without the possibility of probation or 
parole. However, he said he hoped that INS agents will deport Fasciano 
immediately or upon completion of his prison term.

SURGEONS TAKE LARGE TUMOR OUT OF WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 15-pound, watermelon-sized tumor that had grown undetected inside a severely 
overweight Westlake Village woman was surgically removed three weeks after 
being discovered by a doctor who was treating the woman for unexplained 
bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever dreamed that anything was growing inside me," said Bonnie Novak, 49. 
</P>
<P>
Novak said she was thrilled that the surgery to remove the tumor from her 
uterus had gone smoothly. On Friday, three days after the operation, she was 
walking the corridors of Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Once weighing as much as 387 pounds, Novak said in a telephone interview that 
before the operation, she had lost 55 pounds in a commercial weight-loss 
program. She said her clothes had become looser except around her waistline, 
where her girth remained undiminished. 
</P>
<P>
Novak said that she began bleeding May 8 and went to the emergency room at 
Conejo Women's Center in Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
The bleeding was stopped, and she was referred to Dr. Sharon Norling, a 
gynecologist at the clinic. Norling knew immediately that Novak had a growth, 
she said. She referred Novak to specialists to determine the size and location 
of the tumor and whether she was healthy enough to undergo surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"It was difficult to examine her adequately because she was over 300 pounds," 
Norling said. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor said the tumor, which had to be lifted out by two surgeons, was by 
far the largest she had seen during her seven years of practice. "She's done 
remarkably well," Norling said of Novak. 
</P>
<P>
Tests to determine whether the tumor was malignant had not been completed by 
Friday, Norling said. 
</P>
<P>
Her spirits raised by the successful surgery, Novak vowed to keep dieting until 
she weighs 130 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Although she knew she had health problems, she attributed all of them to her 
weight. "Of course, there was something else wrong," Novak said. "It was the 
size of a basketball."

GM MANAGERS GO ON LINE; 
</P>
<P>
TO KEEP CLOSE TO HIS WORKERS, THE REATTA PLANT CHIEF TAKES A TURN BANGING 
METAL. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's 6 a.m. on a Monday morning, and Jim Rucker, with bag lunch in hand, is 
ready for the start of his first day on an automobile assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, seeing as how you're a new hire, I'll take you to your job," a gruff 
union committeeman tells Rucker. 
</P>
<P>
But Jim Rucker is no ordinary production worker; he is the plant manager here 
at General Motors' Buick Reatta assembly plant, the only auto factory in 
America where the top boss regularly takes his turn on the assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
Rucker, a 44-year-old engineer who has just taken over as manager of this small 
plant, is continuing the tradition of his predecessor, Robert Thompson, who 
took it upon himself -- without any goading from upper management -- to work a 
shift on the line at least once a month. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably more managers at GM should do this," says Rucker, clad in a 
sweat-soaked blue T-shirt and blue jeans, as he takes a short break from his 
job in the plant's body shop, hanging doors and welding metal panels on Buick's 
new luxury two-seat models. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't understand what's going on out here on the floor, you can make 
the wrong decisions, and you also might develop a fear about not knowing what's 
really going on. This way, you come to understand that the people on the line 
are regular guys just like you." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Show of Interest 
</P>
<P>
After some initial misgivings, most of the plant's union officials and hourly 
workers now eagerly await the boss' time on the shop floor. 
</P>
<P>
While a few workers grumble that the plant manager's time on the floor is 
little more than a publicity stunt, most say it shows that management really 
cares about them. By having the plant manager come down and get his hands 
dirty, workers say, management is showing a level of interest in their problems 
that Japanese-style "quality circles" and employee involvement programs never 
could. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it, I love it," said Dan Vanneste, a big, friendly bear of a man who 
has spent 18 years on the line, as he shared his job in the body shop with 
Rucker. "This way, they can understand your problems. Before, you know, they 
would walk by and say hello, how are you, and you knew they didn't mean it. But 
now, when they talk about teamwork in the plant, this proves they mean it." 
</P>
<P>
Local union leaders like the arrangement because they get to choose where the 
boss works. Each time, they have tried to give Thompson and Rucker some of the 
toughest jobs in the plant -- jobs that workers have been complaining about -- 
so the manager can get firsthand experience with the most troublesome problems 
that Reatta workers face each day. 
</P>
<P>
"You get much faster feedback on problems when he's out there like that," says 
Ross Sherman, president of United Auto Workers Local 1618, which represents the 
Reatta plant's 630 hourly workers. "Now the people beg us to send him to them, 
so that they can get their problems fixed." 
</P>
<P>
But Rucker's time on the floor is just one of the many innovative labor 
practices that the Reatta plant is now pioneering. 
</P>
<P>
Today, it is the only auto plant in the nation that has done away with many 
aspects of the traditional assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
Because Buick only planned to sell a few thousand Reattas each year, the plant 
has been designed to build only about six cars an hour, compared to 60 per hour 
in a typical auto factory. As a result, GM has been able to take a slow, 
"craft" approach to car production here; the body shop, where Rucker worked his 
shift, is one of the few areas of the plant that still runs on a traditional 
assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the assembly work is instead conducted at 14 "craft centers" where 
teams of workers perform a wide variety of tasks. 
</P>
<P>
When they are finished, workers signal a robotic cart carrying the car body to 
take it to the next craft station. So rather than handling just one or two 
highly repetitive -- and monotonous -- functions the way workers on a typical 
assembly line do, many Reatta workers get the sense that they are actually 
hand-building cars. In fact, this is the only plant in GM where the official 
job description for an assembly worker is that of "craftsman." 
</P>
<P>
GM officials credit the craft center approach with helping the Reatta plant 
gain some of the best quality grades of any GM assembly plant. Over the past 
year, in fact, the Reatta plant has been running neck and neck on quality with 
the GM-Toyota joint venture plant in Fremont for first place in GM's internal 
quality audits of its plants. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem -- the Reatta hasn't been selling as well as expected. Many 
inside GM blame a poor advertising and marketing effort by Buick for the fact 
that Reatta sales have been far below the company's initial forecasts. Although 
Buick officials say they are now pleased with Reatta sales -- which are 
expected to total between 7,000 and 8,000 in the 1989 model year -- 97 workers 
were laid off at the Reatta plant in January, when production was cut back from 
56 cars per day to 42. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slowing the Line 
</P>
<P>
Still, GM seems committed to the Reatta and to the experimental approach being 
followed on the factory floor here. 
</P>
<P>
So Rucker plans to come back each month for his shift on the floor. But his 
supervisors can only hope that he gets the hang of the intricate choreography 
of the assembly line a little quicker next time. After starting his shift at 
six in the morning, it took Rucker until about 9:30 a.m. before he could keep 
up. 
</P>
<P>
But his co-workers didn't mind waiting for him. 
</P>
<P>
"Is he slowing up the line? Yeah," says Charley Barnes, a body shop worker near 
Rucker's station. "But hey, anybody on their first day on a new job takes a 
little extra time."

DISNEY SETTLES FRAUD SUIT WITH MURDOCH'S NEWS CORP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Walt Disney Co. and News Corp. announced late Friday that they have settled a 
lawsuit in which Disney was accused of fraud by the Rupert Murdoch-controlled 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Disney had agreed last November to team with News Corp.'s satellite TV company, 
Sky Television, but problems quickly arose. According to the announcement, 
Disney will sell its stake in the joint venture back to Sky for an undisclosed 
sum and will license motion pictures from its Touchstone and Hollywood Pictures 
units to the British company over a five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed less than three weeks ago, had appeared to pit Disney Chairman 
Michael D. Eisner against his former boss, Barry Diller, who now heads Fox 
Inc., the Los Angeles entertainment conglomerate also owned by News Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The suit claimed that Diller had begged Disney executives to cooperate with the 
satellite TV venture. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Friday, however, Eisner insisted that there was no quarrel 
between the two men, who worked together for nearly 16 years at Paramount 
Pictures and ABC. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had any quarrel with Barry, and Disney never had a quarrel with 20th 
Century Fox. Our dealings were always with the British subsidiary of News 
Corp.," said Eisner, who added that he negotiated directly with Murdoch to 
settle the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe Rupert Murdoch acted extremely honorably, and I do believe he has a 
strong likelihood of being successful with the Sky services," Eisner said. 
</P>
<P>
Sky Television, launched Feb. 5, operates four direct broadcast British TV 
channels. Disney had agreed to launch its Disney Channel in the new market and 
was also to help operate a pay service called Sky Movies. 
</P>
<P>
According to the lawsuit, however, Disney failed to supply its share of funding 
and dragged its feet on decisions in an effort to force a change in terms. 
Despite Diller's plea for cooperation, the suit said, the agreement was 
"repudiated" on May 12. 
</P>
<P>
The News Corp. lawsuit sought $1 billion in punitive damages and $500 million 
in actual damages. 
</P>
<P>
Sky Television, one of several ventures launched in the newly deregulated 
European television market, has a goal of reaching 1 million British homes by 
year's end. Part of its success hinges on the availability of satellite 
receiving dishes, which were in scant supply at the outset. Satellite TV 
involves broadcasting over-the-air to a receiver, rather than via cable. 
</P>
<P>
According to the settlement, Disney and Sky will continue to discuss terms of a 
possible Disney Channel launch, but Disney is no longer obligated to supply its 
popular pay-television programming. 
</P>
<P>
Diller, the chairman of Fox -- which includes the film studio as well as the 
Fox TV network and Fox TV stations -- could not be reached for comment.

EASTERN'S UNIONS GAIN TIME TO INCREASE ANTE

A last-ditch attempt by Eastern Airlines' unions and Chicago commodities dealer 
Joseph Ritchie to buy the carrier won at least three more days of life Friday 
after the unions said they would sweeten the bid with an additional $175 
million to $200 million in wage concessions. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the strike-hobbled carrier announced that, to cut its 
$1.7-million-a-day losses, it will pare executive salaries 20%, require 
non-union employees to work more hours for the same pay and eliminate vacations 
for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Burton R. Lifland extended the deadline for the 
purchase proposal until Monday to allow the unions and Ritchie to further 
refine their offer and present it to court-appointed examiner David I. Shapiro, 
Eastern's unsecured creditors and Eastern officials. The extension came at the 
recommendation of Shapiro, who said the group had "very substantially improved" 
its offer by supplementing an equity stake of $100 million that had been 
disclosed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The carrier was forced to seek the protection of bankruptcy court March 9, five 
days after most of its pilots and flight attendants walked out in sympathy with 
a machinists' union strike. Since then, the airline has been able to operate 
only about 110 flights a day, compared to more than 1,000 before the strike. 
</P>
<P>
The bid by Ritchie and the unions is competing in the bankruptcy court with an 
Eastern proposal that it sell off $1.8 billion in assets to form a radically 
smaller airline. Also on the table is a proposal to liquidate the airline, 
although many consider that a less likely possibility. 
</P>
<P>
The additional union money would take the form of a reserve that the 
reorganized airline could turn to if other funds proved insufficient to cover 
operating costs during its first six months of service. 
</P>
<P>
The new pledge added substantially to union financial promises. Of the 
$100-million equity stake pledged Thursday as part of the union-Ritchie bid, 
$75 million is to come from union sources. The unions had earlier promised $210 
million in wage concessions over a five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Under the austerity measures Eastern announced Friday, full-time ticket agents 
and clerical workers will be scheduled to work 50 hours a week for 40 hours pay 
through Dec. 1. Managers will also be required to work at least 50 hours a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Executive salaries will be reduced 20% through the end of the year and 10% 
through the first six months of 1990, Eastern said.

Trump Files Suit Over Name: Billionaire Donald J. Trump sued in federal court 
to ensure that when you hear the words "Trump Shuttle," you think airline -- 
not moving company. Trump, who bought strikebound Eastern Airlines' shuttle 
service and plans to relaunch it as the "Trump Shuttle," won a court order 
temporarily barring a Washington-based company from using the same name. U.S. 
District Judge Shirley Wohl Kram issued a temporary restraining order barring 
International Trading &amp; Finance Corp. and its owner, Michael Fracassi, from 
using the disputed name until at least later this month, when another hearing 
is scheduled in Manhattan. Trump agreed to purchase Eastern's Washington to New 
York to Boston air shuttle in October, 1988, and incorporated under the name 
Trump Shuttle Inc. a month later in New York. Meanwhile, ITFC registered the 
Trump Shuttle mark in New York in April and filed for rights to the name with 
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: IT'S EASY TO CHECK SOCIAL SECURITY STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

QUESTION: How can a taxpayer find out if all the Social Security contributions 
that have been taken out of her paycheck have been paid to the government and 
that the government has accurate records of these payments? -- L. J. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: It's worthwhile to find out every few years whether your Social 
Security account is at the level it should be, and believe it or not, there is 
a fairly easy way to check. The same procedure will also tell you how much you 
can expect to receive from Social Security upon retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Simply call 1-800-937-2000. This toll-free number has been set aside 
exclusively for telephone requests for Social Security Form SSA-7004, "Personal 
Earnings and Benefit Estimate." If you have difficulty getting through on the 
line, try the general Social Security request line, 1-800-234-5SSA, and ask for 
the same form. 
</P>
<P>
When you get the form, which asks your birth date, Social Security number and a 
few other questions, complete it and mail it back to the address that 
accompanies the form. The Social Security Administration will then send you a 
listing of your Social Security-qualified employment earnings and expected 
retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
If you think that there is an error in the information, you should contact your 
local Social Security office. Be prepared to show agency officials appropriate 
tax returns or earnings statements to support your position. Agency officials 
say they cannot guarantee that they will be able to correct mistakes made more 
than three years earlier, and that's why they recommend filing Form SSA-7004 
every three years. 
</P>

Consult Expert on Property Exchanges 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are a bit confused about tax-deferred exchanges of real estate. How do 
these procedures work, and how much time do we have to complete one of these 
transactions? We have tried to read as much as we can about these exchanges, 
but all of this is still pretty mystifying. For example, these transactions 
seem to go by a lot of different names. Please clarify. -- G. J. B. 
</P>
<P>
A: We'll try to clear matters up for you, but, please understand, tax-deferred 
exchanges are a complicated subject and you will probably want to consult an 
expert -- specifically an "accommodator" -- before proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, tax-deferred exchanges, also known as Starker exchanges because 
of a famous legal case on the subject, are available only for similar types of 
property. You may exchange a piece of investment real estate for another 
investment property, but you may not engage in a tax-deferred exchange of a 
principal residence for a piece of income property. The law outlining the 
requirements is contained in Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, which 
is why these transactions are sometimes referred to as "1031 exchanges." 
</P>
<P>
Under legislation passed in 1984, a seller has 45 days after the close of 
escrow on the sale of his initial property to identify the real estate he 
wishes to acquire through a tax-deferred exchange. He must complete the 
acquisition of that property within 180 days of the escrow closing. Pay 
attention: The government allows a maximum of 180 days from the close of escrow 
on this first property for the completion of a tax-deferred exchange. You do 
not have 45 days to select the property and an additional 180 days in which to 
complete the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
When you enter escrow for the sale of your initial property, you should advise 
your real estate broker as well as your escrow officer that you intend the 
proceeds of the sale to go into a tax-deferred exchange. This is a very 
important matter, and a statement of your intentions should be included in the 
official escrow instructions. Equally important is the requirement that you 
never take possession of the proceeds from the sale of the initial property. If 
you do, the tax-deferred advantage of the transaction is forfeited. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the strict regulations surrounding tax-deferred exchanges, you 
should get help from a qualified third-party accommodator before attempting one 
of these transactions. Your real estate broker, escrow officer or family 
attorney should be able to steer you to an accountant or lawyer who has been 
trained as an accommodator. But be careful. The area is ripe for abuse, and you 
could be out of luck if you select an unskilled or inexperienced, unqualified 
accommodator. 
</P>
<P>
The most important service the accommodator performs is temporarily taking 
possession both of the property you intend to buy and of the funds you receive 
from the first property sale to ensure that you never touch those assets until 
the deal is completed. These are highly sensitive and important duties, and you 
should be sure to interview prospective accommodators carefully before making 
your selection to learn of their experience and qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
For additional information, see Internal Revenue Service publications No. 17, 
"Your Federal Income Tax," or No. 544, "Sales and Other Dispositions of 
Property."

How to Hike Deduction on 2nd Home's Loan 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently purchased a vacation home for $500,000. I know I can deduct the 
mortgage interest on this house. However, I wonder if I can finance the 
vacation house by making a cash down payment of $100,000 and increasing the 
mortgage on my principal residence by $400,000? I can get a better interest 
rate by borrowing on my principal house than I can if I borrow on the vacation 
home. -- R. B. 
</P>
<P>
A: You may be able to get a better interest rate by increasing the mortgage on 
your principal residence, but your borrowing power on this house has been 
severely limited by recent tax code revisions. Under the current law, you are 
limited to increasing the mortgage on your principal residence by just $100,000 
if you want the interest on that loan to be completely tax deductible. 
</P>
<P>
So, in your case, if you want the mortgage interest to be fully deductible, you 
can, at best, borrow $100,000 on your principal house. The remainder of the 
purchase would have to be financed through a combination of a down payment and 
a mortgage on the property for which the loan proceeds are intended: your 
vacation house. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handwritten Will Is Perfectly Legal 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am a widow with assets of less than $100,000. I intend to leave all my 
possessions to my only child, a son. Since my affairs are uncomplicated, will a 
handwritten will, duly signed, stand up legally? -- S. W. G. 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. According to the lawyers we consulted, you can leave a handwritten 
will, also known as a holographic will, indicating how your possessions are to 
be disposed of after your death. You should be sure to write the entire 
document by hand. Do not merely type it and then sign it. Put the complete date 
on the document: month, date and year. You should indicate in the text of the 
will that you are of sound mind and that you intend the document to serve as 
your will. Be sure to sign it with your full legal name. The will does not have 
to be signed by a witness. Keep it with your other important papers.

RIO GRANDE WANTS TO BUY RAIL LINE IN CHICAGO

Rio Grande Industries confirmed Friday that it is trying to buy 500 miles of 
railroad between Kansas City and Chicago from Soo Line Corp of Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The track would give Rio Grande, parent of the Southern Pacific and Denver 
&amp; Rio Grande Western railroads, its first direct link to Chicago from the 
West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the railroad must hand off goods to other lines, including Soo, in 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Rio Grande said it is optimistic it will be able to reach an agreement with Soo 
for the Kansas City-Chicago line, which passes through Missouri, Iowa and 
northern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
"No final agreement has been reached," the railroad said in a statement, "but 
negotiations are progressing and a number of significant issues have been 
resolved in principle." 
</P>
<P>
The railroad's actions indicate that Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz intends 
to act quickly to bolster his privately held rail operation. In October, his 
Rio Grande Industries bought the Southern Pacific from Santa Fe Southern 
Pacific Corp. for $1 billion.

SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Noble Broadcast Group of San Diego and the Griffin Group of Los Angeles have 
called off a purchase agreement announced in April whereby Griffin was to have 
bought two Boston radio stations, WSSH-FM and WKKU-AM, from Noble for $39 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Noble said in a statement that it backed out of the Griffin deal after its 
efforts to buy two radio networks in a separate transaction failed. Proceeds 
from the sale of the stations to the group controlled by entertainer Merv 
Griffin were to have been used to finance the purchase of the networks. 
</P>
<P>
Noble, which bought the stations for a combined price of $22.2 million in 1986 
and 1987, owns 18 radio stations. Griffin owns four radio stations.

NO BULL, LAKERS GET PISTONS AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER SMOKE CLEARS, 'GANGSTERS' HAVE 103-94 VICTORY IN GAME 6 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
By evening's end, one Chicago Bull was in a hospital, the Chicago Bull had 
re-aggravated a groin injury, the highest-scoring Detroit Piston had strained a 
hamstring, two other Pistons had bloody mouths, and one particularly unpopular 
Piston was being cussed out by Chicago's coach and called "a thug" and "a 
gangster" by the Bulls' owner. 
</P>
<P>
In war, there are casualties. 
</P>
<P>
There also are victors, and spoils. The spoils in this case: Detroit, by virtue 
of Friday night's 103-94 disposal of Chicago, wins the Eastern Conference 
championship and gets to play the Lakers -- again -- for the National 
Basketball Assn. title, beginning Tuesday night in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit is going for one in a row. It has never won the NBA title since the 
franchise left Ft. Wayne, Ind., in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons spotted the Bulls a 12-point lead in the first period, then came on 
like gangbusters -- or gangsters, in some eyes -- behind Isiah Thomas' 33 
points to eliminate Michael Jordan and his gang in the best-of-seven series, 4 
games to 2. Jordan went out with 32 points and a limp because of his groin 
injury -- his bid to play the Lakers for the championship put on hold for at 
least another year. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be the bad guys in the black hats, us, against the good guys in the 
white hats, the Lakers," said Piston center Bill Laimbeer. "This time, let's 
hope the bad guys win." 
</P>
<P>
A bad guy is exactly what Laimbeer was being called after Friday's game. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a thug. He's a gangster. He shouldn't be in the league," said Bull owner 
Jerry Reinsdorf, not the only Laimbeer-hater in the crowd of 18,676 at Chicago 
Stadium that booed the Piston player's every move. 
</P>
<P>
It did not aid Chicago's cause that forward Scottie Pippen, the team's No. 2 
scorer during the season, played only 62 seconds. Pippen caught an elbow to the 
head -- "another cheap shot by that . . . Laimbeer," Bull Coach Doug Collins 
said -- and was taken to a nearby hospital with a possible concussion. 
</P>
<P>
Seldom-used Brad Sellers did an admirable job in Pippen's place, scoring 16 
points, but once again, Chicago's offense was left up to Magic Michael. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan this time took 26 shots -- not eight, as he did in Game 5 -- and made 
one shot that will be shown on highlight shows for years to come. Did he stop 
passing off? Not at all. Jordan also had 13 assists. 
</P>
<P>
However, human being that he is, Jordan also committed eight turnovers, more 
than half of Chicago's total. He also made only 5 of 12 free throws, did not 
have an offensive rebound and was guilty of five fouls, which kept him from 
being as aggressive as he might otherwise have been late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Collins took him out with 23 -- Jordan's number -- seconds left in the game, to 
a thunderous ovation. The coach also used that moment to dash down to Detroit's 
bench and give high-fives to everybody on it. Laimbeer was still in the game at 
the time, so Collins did not have to be choosy about whose hands he slapped. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan said: "We desperately wanted to go forward, but Detroit is a great team. 
All I can say is, it was a great series and a great lesson to build on. We got 
to this point, and there is nothing wrong with dreaming, so I'll just spend the 
summer dreaming about next year." 
</P>
<P>
Not blaming him a bit for thinking that way was Detroit Coach Chuck Daly, who 
said: "The Bulls may be the team of the future. They may be the team to beat in 
our division next year." 
</P>
<P>
Intending to pull out all the stops to keep the series alive, Chicago brought 
in everybody from Jordan's good friend, filmmaker Spike Lee, to an NBA 
semi-legend, The Original (as he bills himself) Dancin' Harry, who long ago 
provided timeout entertainment for the Washington Bullets and the New York 
Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
What the Bulls really needed was some of the offense that Detroit had been 
denying them and everybody else. For a time, they had it going, but in the end, 
the Pistons had kept an opponent under 100 points for the 15th straight game. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago overcame the loss of Pippen to take a 16-6 lead, with Jordan supplying 
two dunks, a beautiful assist to Horace Grant for a layup and a shot that will 
stay in eyewitnesses' minds for a long, long time -- a twisting, 
gravity-defying reverse layup over Laimbeer off a steal. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls went ahead by 26-14, with Sellers doing his part, scoring eight 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, with a dozen already, took a brief rest at this point with 2:36 
remaining in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
If only he never had to rest at all. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit went right out and ran off 12 straight points, making the score 26-26, 
and Chicago was never the same. 
</P>
<P>
When Craig Hodges hit a three-point jump shot with 8:34 left in the half, it 
was Chicago's first basket since the 3:58 mark in the first period. That's how 
much the team's offense suffers without Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Hodges ended up with 15 points, while Horace Grant had 13 points and as many 
rebounds. For Detroit, nobody came close to Thomas' 33 points, but Dennis 
Rodman did his job on the boards, getting 15 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas suffered a pulled hamstring muscle in his right leg during the second 
quarter, so neither he nor Jordan was at his best during the second half. And 
still they easily led their teams in scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Dumars and John Salley of the Pistons each ended up with bloody mouths 
during the course of a very physical, almost violent game, and James Edwards 
was struck by a crumpled cup thrown by a fan. No one from Detroit was seriously 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas had 21 of his points in the second half, giving Detroit an outside 
attack to go with the dominating inside work of Rodman and Edwards. Daly moved 
Thomas to No. 2 guard in the second half, something he does periodically, and 
let Isiah shoot rather than quarterback the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit led by a basket at halftime, 49-47. In the third period, after Jordan 
missed two free throws, Laimbeer threw in a rare hook shot -- sort of a ground 
hook -- to give Detroit its largest lead to that moment, 62-57. By the end of 
the third period, the Pistons had widened their lead to nine, even with only 
one basket in the last 5 1/2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls had a run left in them. Jordan completed a four-point play, two 
lay-ups around a missed free throw, and John Paxson followed with a three-point 
basket and a corner jumper for two. With 8:44 left, Chicago suddenly was within 
striking distance at 81-79, and the NBA's loudest arena was rocking. 
</P>
<P>
With a chance to tie, Jordan had his pocket picked by Dumars. The crowd settled 
down, and one-time hometown favorite Thomas rattled off six straight points for 
an 88-80 lead. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Chicago never got closer than six. 
</P>
<P>
Excited about another shot at a pro championship to go along with the national 
college title he won at Indiana, Thomas said: "When we lost that last game of 
the NBA Finals to the Lakers, people said: 'Don't worry, next year you're going 
to have the best record in the NBA, you're going to get to the finals and 
you're going to win.' Well, we've done two out of three. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bill Laimbeer pleaded innocent to charges of causing Scottie Pippen's head 
injury, claiming Pippen's teammate, Horace Grant, hit him. Replays were 
inconclusive to some, but not to Chicago Coach Doug Collins, who said: 
"Laimbeer hit him right in the face with his left elbow, and Scottie ends up in 
the hospital."

PHOENIX FORMULA ONE RACE COULD WIND UP AN EXPENSIVE FIASCO

<P>
Is there naivete in the Valley of the Sun, or has Phoenix been taken in an 
international con job? 
</P>
<P>
The city has anted close to $3 million to bring 39 Formula One drivers and cars 
from 12 countries to race for two hours Sunday in the United States Grand Prix 
over a 2.36-mile circuit laid out on downtown streets. 
</P>
<P>
And city officials have promised to spend upward of $5 million more to bring 
them back for four more years. 
</P>
<P>
They also gave Formula One promoter Bernie Ecclestone all TV rights to the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons, in theory, are publicity and profit -- to get Phoenix on worldwide 
TV, to spread its dateline around the world in newspapers and magazines and to 
attract jet-setting race fans who will bring vast sums of money into the 
community, where they will eat, sleep and party for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
Neither idea sits well with operators of two of the area's existing race 
facilities, Phoenix International Raceway and Firebird Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
"As someone who has lived here all my life, as well as promoting racing, the 
deal the city made really bothers me," said Dennis Wood, operations consultant 
and former owner of PIR. "It was so unnecessary to accomplish what they say 
they want. 
</P>
<P>
"We showcase the finest racing in the country -- Indy cars, Winston Cup stock 
cars and sprint cars -- in three major events that are televised nationally. 
And we've never received a single cent in subsidy from the city. Never in the 
track's history. And we've never asked for any. Buddy Jobe owns the raceway 
now, and he spends his own money to put on attractive races, as I did before 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Allen, owner-proprietor of Firebird, expressed the same sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
"We conduct racing every week of the year at Firebird, and our major drag races 
and boat races are seen on TV and carry Phoenix's name on the news wires," 
Allen said. "We estimate we generate $8 million to $11 million to the economy 
of the area. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's real wrong that the city is spending the taxpayers' money to 
subsidize a race like this just to stroke some city officials' egos. If they 
want to subsidize racing, why don't they do something for us, or PIR. Our 
racing is better than anything they're likely to see Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
Another stated reason for bringing the race here, although it lacks a great 
deal of validity when it means sitting or standing in the sun on a 100-degree 
day, is that the race gives residents of the Valley of the Sun the chance to 
see Formula One cars at race speeds. 
</P>
<P>
They were given an opportunity to watch them free Friday, a decision that was 
made partially to accommodate office workers inside the race course who did not 
feel like paying admission to go to work. Only a smattering of spectators lined 
the fences to watch the first round of qualifying, dominated as usual by 
Brazilian Ayrton Senna at 94.287 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Senna has been the pole-sitter for the last seven Formula One races, and 11 of 
the last 12, in his McLaren-Honda. 
</P>
<P>
Today, though, it starts to cost big money to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Standing room is $25 today, $35 on Sunday. Grandstand seats for the weekend 
range from $85 to $200. Only the $200 seats have an awning cover. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate boxes cost $6,000 each for 12 seats, and Paddock Club Suites, which 
are located above the 40 garages built to accommodate the race cars and crews, 
cost $25,000 each for 40 people. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the city's original investment went to build the permanent garages and 
a two-story operations tower. The open-air garages will be used later as a 
covered parking lot for city employees. 
</P>
<P>
Another $300,000 was allocated for overtime pay for the police and fire 
departments. Much of that is going to a special fire department unit and the 
Good Samaritan Medical Center, which is anticipating a number of heat 
prostration cases. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, the center is across the alley from A. L. Moore &amp; Son 
Mortuary. 
</P>
<P>
"Not intentional, I can assure you," said one fireman with a sweaty grin. 
</P>
<P>
The funeral home is inside the track fencing, which severely curtails its 
business, according to Bill Gumbert, manager. 
</P>
<P>
"We have two other places in the area to accommodate our customers, but the 
race certainly has a negative impact on our business," Gumbert said. "If the 
city had been a bit more considerate at the beginning, I would look more 
favorably on it, but we have been supportive of the downtown area since 1906, 
and we had no input into the planning. 
</P>
<P>
"Even answering our phones has been difficult, because the noise is so 
intense." 
</P>
<P>
Another who complained about the noise from 650-horsepower engines 
reverberating among the high-rise buildings along Washington and Jefferson 
streets was Ralph Johnson, who operates a shoeshine stand a block from the 
course. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my customers come here to sit and talk while I'm putting on the 
spit-and-polish," Johnson said. "With all this damn noise, we can't hear a 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Worse than the noise, according to many downtown workers, was the chain-link 
fencing that surrounds the course. 
</P>
<P>
"This is ridiculous," said Ray McClure, an attorney. "I work across the street 
from the county courthouse and I have to wander around for six blocks to get 
there. The city must have spent half their $3 million just for fencing." 
</P>
<P>
Among the major benefactors were expected to be hotels and motels, which were 
projected to be at capacity. But a survey of downtown hotels, including race 
headquarters at the Hyatt Regency and at the Phoenix Sheraton, found that rooms 
were plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
Crowd estimates are falling in the same manner. Last April, news services 
reported that on-the-site promoter Jack Long expected 60,000 on race day. His 
estimate is now "between 35,000 to 40,000." 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate naivete might have been one resident's reaction to the event's 
official name: Iceberg Phoenix Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't that cute, calling it the Iceberg race so visitors won't think about the 
heat so much," a Sheraton waitress said with a straight face. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, Iceberg is the name of an exclusive line of Italian casual clothing 
that specializes in very expensive sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
Which are definitely not going to be needed in Phoenix this weekend.

FRENCH OPEN AIMS TO SERVE; 
</P>
<P>
IT MAY RAIN ON THE TENNIS, BUT FLAVOR DOESN'T CHANGE

<P>
The sun will play hide-and-seek behind white, inoffensive clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Weather report for Day 4 of the French Open 
</P>
<P>
On Day 5, those clouds got downright offensive. 
</P>
<P>
A steady, cold drizzle fell upon Roland Garros Stadium Friday afternoon, 
preceding the appearance of a raft of umbrellas and turning the storied clay 
courts into something like red putty. 
</P>
<P>
In France, this is regarded as both tragedy and opportunity. The matches might 
have been postponed for a while, but at the same time the rain provided an 
invitation to dine without the interruption of tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Poor weather chased thousands of tennis fans under the green-and-white striped 
canopies in front of the many food booths. There they could sample such items 
as a croque monsieur, sort of a grilled cheese with ham, for about $3.50. 
</P>
<P>
Also available were strawberry tarts, chicken and fries and the French version 
of a hot dog. The sausage is dropped into a hollowed-out area in the end of a 
loaf of fresh bread and then laced with spicy mustard that American TV 
commentator Bud Collins called "hotter than Steffi Graf's forehand." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, food and its consumption are a national pastime of the 
French, who naturally expect no dropoff in quality whether the setting is a 
restaurant on the Champs Elysees or a concession stand at a sporting event. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, this is nothing new. Noted tennis historian Ted Tinling said that 
more than 30 years ago, bread was carried in baskets once an hour to Roland 
Garros from a nearby village. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to say in the 1950s that it was the best bread in the world," Tinling 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, French tennis was in a class with its bread, but that was more 
than 50 years ago, when the great French Davis Cup teams ruled the tennis 
world. They were the Four Musketeers -- Jean Borotra, Rene Lacoste, Henri 
Cochet and Jacques Brugnon. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty years ago, Lacoste defeated Borotra, 8-6, in the fifth set of a French 
Open final that is still a lively topic of conversation here. 
</P>
<P>
Borotra and Lacoste now stand in bronze in a plaza just beyond stadium court. 
Soon the other two Musketeers, and French women's legend Suzanne Lenglen, will 
be joining them in Roland Garros. 
</P>
<P>
Center court itself is a fortress of gray stone that opened on May 19, 1928. 
The chair umpire for the first match was 17-year-old Ted Tinling, who traveled 
with Lenglen as her personal umpire. 
</P>
<P>
Tinling recalled how the French decided to embrace the maverick sport of tennis 
with a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Sport had been a dirty word in France," Tinling said. "Sport used to be rowing 
and shooting and horse racing." 
</P>
<P>
The success of Max Decugis, the first great Parisian tennis star, persuaded the 
city's elders to construct a suitable place to stage tennis events. Since then, 
there have been several additions made to the buildings, which give the complex 
a unique architectural appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"You now have to climb steps to get anywhere," Tinling said. "They must have 
had a sort of mania for stairs." 
</P>
<P>
The French Open is the premier clay-court tournament in the world, and among 
the men, the names of its winners are dominated by players from nearly 
everywhere but North America, where clay is not the surface to which the 
players are accustomed. 
</P>
<P>
The surface at Roland Garros is screened and graded natural red clay one-inch 
thick. The clay is made of special crushed brick from the village of Hermenon, 
which is about an hour's drive from here. 
</P>
<P>
It is the clay that makes the French Open different. Like the grass courts at 
Wimbledon or the hard courts at the U.S. Open, the clay courts of Roland Garros 
require a completely different type of player and tactics. 
</P>
<P>
Clay, especially damp clay, slows the bounce of the ball. Shots that would be 
winners on other surfaces are returned with ease on clay, where matches become 
tests of endurance and patience. 
</P>
<P>
When Jimmy Connors lost to Jay Berger in the second round this week, he said 
that clay is certainly not his favorite surface, but admitted that he had 
enjoyed his experience on it nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I don't mind moving on to a surface where I can hit a winner or maybe cut 
the points a little shorter," he said. "Here, you give the ball a pretty good 
ride and it's coming right back at you." 
</P>
<P>
Tennis purists, historians and guardians of the game are steadfast in their 
zeal that the Grand Slam be played on different surfaces so that a winner will 
be a true champion. Clay is unlike any other. 
</P>
<P>
In a uniquely clay feature, there will be many times in the French Open when 
players point to the mark the ball left on the court to settle questions of 
whether it was in or out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderful feeling to see the mark of the ball," Tinling said. "When I 
umpired for Suzanne, I looked at the type of grouping after points to see how 
she planned the point. 
</P>
<P>
"If she hit a confident ball, I would see a long, pointed oval. Without 
exaggeration, a half-hour after the match I could count the winners." 
</P>
<P>
France is in the business of counting winners. A country with a national daily 
sports newspaper, France takes its clay-court tennis seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The French booed countryman Henri Leconte when he lost to Mats Wilander in the 
final last year, something that Leconte has never quite gotten over. 
</P>
<P>
When Yannick Noah won his country's national championship on center court in 
1983, he became an instant hero. Conversely, his first-round loss this week was 
treated as a national tragedy. As he addressed a phalanx of television cameras, 
Noah wasn't quite as devastated. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going somewhere to take my shoes off and relax," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And he added that he would find a beach with sand, not clay.

RODMAN IS PISTONS' UNIQUE SUPERSUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER MAY, The Hartford Courant 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the beginning, there always was one truism about Dennis Rodman: there 
hadn't been one like him and there probably won't be another. 
</P>
<P>
What reserve in the NBA has the total package, emotionally and talentwise, that 
the 6-foot-7 Detroit Pistons supersub possesses? Who plays better defense? Who 
rebounds better? Who has a higher capacity to aggravate? To instigate? Who 
would dare to imply Larry Bird's many accolades were due primarily to 
pigmentation? 
</P>
<P>
And who has ever done what Rodman did Wednesday night in the Pistons' 94-85 
victory over the Bulls in the Eastern Conference finals? All he did was grab 10 
rebounds (of his total haul of 14) in the fourth quarter. A substantial intake, 
certainly, but what makes it even more mind-boggling is that no other Piston 
had a single rebound in the quarter. He had them all. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a first for me," Mark Aguirre said. "I've never seen that happen." 
</P>
<P>
Rodman also blocked a shot, though he admitted Thursday that he had fouled the 
shooter, Michael Jordan, on the play. "I got him. I got him good," he says. 
(And who else would admit that?) 
</P>
<P>
And he made himself an enormous presence when the game was on the line -- by 
not scoring a single point. Only one other NBA sub, Manute Bol, can possibly be 
termed an impact player without a point portfolio. And Bol doesn't approach 
Rodman for versatility. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seems like the game changes when I come in and get into the flow," 
said Rodman, whose team can eliminate the Bulls with a victory Friday night in 
Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals. "I mean, I don't have to even score 
one point. You just get this energy. You can feel it. And all of a sudden, the 
momentum changes." 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: The Pistons were clinging to an 80-77 lead after Craig Hodges 
hit a three-point field goal with 6:27 to play in Game 5. The Pistons set up 
James Edwards for a turnaround, but the shot missed. But Rodman was there for a 
big rebound. The ball subsequently found its way into the white-hot hands of 
Vinnie Johnson, who answered Hodges' three-pointer with one of his own. The 
Bulls were through for the night. 
</P>
<P>
Rodman is averaging an astonishing 25.2 rebounds per 48 minutes in this series 
(13.0 a game). He is continuing a regular-season trend in which he has more 
rebounds than points; in this series he is doubling his scoring with his 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Every ball that goes to the rim is mine," he said. "Even if Bill Laimbeer gets 
it. I'm so elusive. And I'm always working. When the ball goes up, I think I'm 
going to get that rebound or tip-in. I just don't like to disappoint anyone, 
especially the coaches." 
</P>
<P>
He rarely does. "I'd hate to even think what our record would be without him," 
assistant coach Brendan Suhr said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Coach Chuck Daly: "I've seen him do it so many times before. It's like 
they say about Superman leaping over tall buildings in a single bound. That's 
what we're seeing. If he's not the premier offensive rebounder in the league, I 
don't know who is. He has a gift for it. A knack. A sense." 
</P>
<P>
Rodman recognized early that he had to do the so-called dirty work to survive. 
Although he led the league in field-goal percentage this season, scoring and 
shooting are not his strengths. Dunks and layups account for about 99.99996% of 
his baskets, and he averaged only 9.0 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Defense and rebounding are his calling cards and always have been. The Pistons 
salivate at the prospect of him adding a reliable offensive dimension to his 
game, but they'll gladly settle for what they have now. So will Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy doing the things that people don't do, like rebounding, playing 
defense, taking a charge," he said. "And getting the crowd in the game. The 
type of things that make me stand out from other people in the league." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Rodman, it is only lately that his undeniable talent has 
begun to overshadow his showboating proclivities. He still waves the finger and 
pounds the fist and exhorts the fans and his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
And he isn't going to stop. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been hyper," he explained. "I just love the game so much and I 
want people to know that I enjoy my work. The money just isn't that important 
to me. 
</P>
<P>
"And the kids relate to that. They relate to the fist-pounding and the 
finger-waving and the antics. . . . But I'm not trying to show up anyone. A lot 
of guys have egos and no one has done that to them before. Now, I think, guys 
are more accustomed to it. They know I love the game."

DREES' BID FOR THIRD NO-HITTER IN ROW IS ENDED BY WOODSON'S HOMER IN FIRST

Vancouver's Tom Drees lost his bid to become the first professional to pitch 
three no-hitters in a row but survived a shaky first inning for his third 
straight Pacific Coast League win as the Canadians defeated Albuquerque, 10-7, 
before 13,258 fans Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Drees' hitless string ended quickly when Tracy Woodson hit a fastball for a 
two-run, first-inning homer. 
</P>
<P>
Drees, 25, had pitched no-hitters within five days in May to join former Johnny 
Vander Meer of the Cincinnati Reds and Bill Bell of Bristol (Va.) in the 
Appalachian League as the only pros to pitch consecutive no-hit games. Vander 
Meer did it 1938, Bell in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
Woodson's homer was his 11th of the season and the first given up by Drees this 
season. It ended Drees' string of hitless innings at 18 1/3. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-6 left-hander, who has a 35-34 career record, pitched a 1-0 
no-hitter against Calgary May 23 before 298 fans in Vancouver, then came back 
May 28 with a seven-inning 1-0 no-hitter against Edmonton in the first game of 
a doubleheader.

HEAD OF NHL PLAYERS' UNION TO FACE CHALLENGE AT MEMBERSHIP MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alan Eagleson, executive director of the National Hockey League Players Assn. 
since it was formed in 1967, faces a challenge this weekend in West Palm Beach, 
Fla., at the union's annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Questions that have been raised concern the handling of union funds, the 
apparent conflicts involved in having a leader who also represents individual 
players and who works as a promoter of tournaments, and the possibly 
too-friendly relationship Eagleson enjoys with NHL President John Ziegler. 
</P>
<P>
In questioning Eagleson's effectiveness as a union leader, the challengers -- a 
faction headed by player agents Ron Salcer and Rich Winter, and Ed Garvey, 
former head of the National Football League players' union -- point out that 
hockey salaries run far behind those in other major sports, that free agency as 
it exists in the NHL "with compensation" is really not free agency, and that, 
right or wrong, Bob Probert of the Detroit Red Wings should have had some union 
support when he was expelled from the league without so much as a hearing after 
his arrest for a drug violation. 
</P>
<P>
Salcer, who lives in Southern California, contends that the players interested 
in challenging Eagleson number at least 225. "That is strong support," Salcer 
said. "I think there is a very strong possibility that they would vote to buy 
him out."

The San Francisco 49ers want their former team doctor to pay a $1-million 
settlement to former lineman Charlie Krueger, saying the doctor was responsible 
for the effects of Krueger's crippling knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the 49ers were found liable by a state court for fraudulently failing 
to reveal the severity of Krueger's knee injury, which has left him unable to 
stand for long periods of time. 
</P>
<P>
Krueger won $2.36 million in damages last year from a San Francisco Superior 
Court judge in a non-jury trial. The case was settled for a reported $1 million 
to avoid an appeal. The 49ers asked to have the entire cost shifted to Dr. 
Lloyd Milburn, their physician during the period of Krueger's injuries.

Reggie Williams, Cincinnati Bengal linebacker, said he will run for a 
Cincinnati City Council seat in the fall, after having served for a year as an 
appointee.

<P>
Williams, who can become Cincinnati's mayor if he is the council's top 
vote-getter, is a member of the Charter Committee party in Cincinnati. He said 
the Bengals have agreed to excuse him from Wednesday meetings and practice

the fastball hits the catcher's mitt. 
</P>
<P>
"Eighty-five," the white-haired man with the clear blue eyes says. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Teed doesn't have a speed gun. 
</P>
<P>
The 15 men, each holding a speed gun, check their digital readings and write 
down either 84, 85 or 86 mph in their notebooks. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in using the gun for every pitch," Teed says. "Often a pitcher 
will see all these guns and overthrow. I want to see his normal motion. At 
night, because of the lights and the different perception, I'll use the gun 
more. I won't that much during the day. Nine times out of 10, I'll be within 3 
mph. If I'm off by more than that, I'll use the gun." 
</P>
<P>
Teed, the Dodgers' Northeast scouting supervisor, rarely has a speed gun. But 
he is always prepared for duty, driving 35,000 miles from February to October 
along highways and byways in Florida, New England, west to Ohio and south to 
West Virginia to watch about 600 games and examine prospective professional 
players. 
</P>
<P>
This sunny May day, Teed has a third baseman and a pitcher to "cross-check," 
which in baseball parlance means to scout for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
He arrives two hours before game time to watch warmups. It is here he can see 
the power and accuracy of the fielders' throws, and their range. "Sometimes a 
player will have a bad day, won't get a play in the field or never swing the 
bat," he says. "In warmups, you can learn a great deal." 
</P>
<P>
During the game, Teed sits on the first-base side to see a right-handed hitter 
swing. He moves behind the plate to scout pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Teed places a stop watch, hanging on a black necklace, in his right hand and 
times the third baseman running to first. He clutches the watch, glancing only 
to note the time. He releases his grip and returns his hand to his side. He 
checks the batter's swing. Is it inside out? Can he handle the fastball? He 
watches the pitcher's motion, arm speed and movement of his fastball. He jots 
down words and numbers in his Dodger-blue notebook. 
</P>
<P>
Teed does not discuss his findings or judgments. He guards what he says to 
fellow scouts. When one asks where he's going tomorrow, he says, "I'm going to 
be either here or see a guy in Syracuse or Boston." 
</P>
<P>
Successful scouting demands such attempts at secrecy -- though Teed admits most 
scouts know of the same prospects. The preparation for the June 5-7 free-agent 
draft is a yearlong culmination of analyses and projections of players: Can 
this one be a major leaguer? Is he a first, second or third-round pick? Finding 
talent to replenish and sustain a club's entire system is essential. No club 
can afford to leak out any of its decisions before the draft. 
</P>
<P>
"The first four or five rounds are the most important," Teed says. "But when 
should a club draft a player and will he sign? When you see a 17-year-old, you 
have to project what kind of player he'll be in three years. What is his 
personal makeup? These are the questions a scout has to answer." 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati Reds reliever John Franco is the most notable of Teed's 10 major 
league signings. Franco was a fifth-round pick of the Dodgers in 1981. Teed 
says he has signed 65 to 70 players who became minor leaguers. His says his 
biggest disappointment might have been Tom DeMerit, an outfielder with 
Dartmouth who didn't stick with professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"He was our fourth pick in the '87 draft," Teed says. "And an important element 
in judging players is their inner drive and hunger to play. I thought he had 
this. He was the son of a former major league player (John, an outfielder with 
the Milwaukee Braves and the Mets). He played a year at Vero Beach and was in a 
slump (hitting .194). Then he just gave it up. He had awesome tools, but he 
didn't give it enough time." 
</P>
<P>
Teed, 63, a major league scout since 1968, says the true measure of success for 
a scout is not the number of major league players signed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's that you work and know your area, so that you know every player and you 
don't miss anyone," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Teed's season starts in the winter when letters, requesting schedules, are sent 
to high schools and colleges in his area. Prospects, impressive high school 
underclassmen, and games he wants to see are noted. He fills in a calendar of 
games for virtually every day. But it's not one game a day. Most days, it's 
two, three or four. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you'll only stay a few innings and then go to another game," he 
says. "You have to have backup games, if one gets rained out or if the player 
you want to see is not playing." 
</P>
<P>
Teed goes to Florida in late February with the Dodgers' entourage to scout high 
school, college and pro games. 
</P>
<P>
"I've missed a lot of birthdays," he says. "But I have a wife, Ginny, -- we'll 
be married 40 years in September -- and four daughters who have been great 
support. There are no shortcuts to do this job right. You've got to be honest 
with yourself and on your grading of players." 
</P>
<P>
Teed leans back in the bleachers and says, "After two days of rain, we need 
this. This morning I was either going to Syracuse or here. Here's the sun, and 
here I am." 
</P>
<P>
His face is bronzed and his forehead furrowed. He looks as if he just walked 
off the deck of a Cape Cod fishing boat. With his hair combed back, he 
resembles actor Lloyd Bridges. 
</P>
<P>
Teed is on an unending hunt for major league players. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost impossible to find some gem out there that no one knows about," he 
says. "But every day I go out, I never know what I'm going to see. That's 
what's great about it." 
</P>
<P>
This is Teed's 42nd year in pro baseball. He was a catcher with the 
Brooklyn-Los Angeles Dodgers farm system from 1947-1960. He struck out in his 
only major league at-bat in 1953. He completed his minor league career with the 
Philadelphia Phillies in 1960 and was a Phillies minor league coach and manager 
until 1967. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies asked Teed to be a scout the next year, but he was uncertain if 
the profession was right for him. "They said I would be good at this," he says. 
"I figured I'd give it three years and see." 
</P>
<P>
He remained with the Phillies until 1978 and has been with the Dodgers since, 
collecting memories: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "I had seen Frank Viola at St. John's and was real high on him. The great 
thing was that not many other scouts thought as highly of him because he hadn't 
really progressed through his career. Then came his game against Yale's Ron 
Darling. Viola was outstanding. And scouts were saying, 'Wow, he's something.' 
I called Steve Lembo, one of our scouts in New York, and said, 'We just lost 
Viola.' " 
</P>
<P>
 -- "You can't believe clocks all the time. When I scouted Willie Wilson, he 
had a 4.5 time to first. That's not great. But from first to third, you didn't 
need a clock. He just flew." 
</P>
<P>
After watching about 200 games, Teed has no more players to see, pitchers to 
time or hitters to judge before the draft. Last week he submitted a list of 45 
players to the Dodgers for draft consideration. Teed and seven other team 
scouts and administrators gathered in Los Angeles Monday to begin the process 
of pouring over reports of 300 prospects. Each player will be given a numerical 
rating for the draft. 
</P>
<P>
"Your work is done and all you can do is wait," Teed says. "With 25 other 
clubs, you may be ready to draft one of your guys, then, boom, he's picked by 
another team. It's frustrating, but that's the way the game goes sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
After the draft, Teed will have a few days off. Then work begins anew to the 
Eastern, International and Cape Cod leagues and to Red Sox, Mets and Yankees 
games to judge players for possible trades. 
</P>
<P>
"I listen to the forecast every morning on the radio," Teed says. "If they say 
'rain,' I don't necessarily believe them. Because, for a scout, every day is a 
sunny one."

NO TIME FOR THE PAIN: DAVIS HITS FOR THE CYCLE AS REDS BEAT PADRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER

<TEXT>
<P>
Eric Davis insists that his hamstring still hurts. If he ever gets healthy, 
pitchers will have to run for cover. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who came off the disabled list May 19 and has been hitting solidly ever 
since, had his biggest night of the season when he led the Reds to a 9-4 
victory over the San Diego Padres Friday at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, the first Cincinnati batter to hit for the cycle in the last 30 years, 
drove in six runs while going four for four. 
</P>
<P>
Davis doubled home Barry Larkin in the first, singled him home in the third and 
hit a three-run home run in the fourth off Walt Terrell. 
</P>
<P>
Davis tripled to center field in the seventh to complete the cycle. 
</P>
<P>
The last Red to perform the feat was Frank Robinson, who did it against the 
Dodgers on May 2, 1959. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has four consecutive multiple-hit games, going 10 for 15 during the span. 
</P>
<P>
Larkin scored four times and extended his hitting streak to 13 games. His 
batting average has improved to .339. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, the Padres announced that they had traded outfielder John Kruk 
and infielder Randy Ready to the Philadelphia Phillies for outfielder Chris 
James. Ready will replace retired third baseman Mike Schmidt. DAN HAFNER

CAL POLY SLO SCORES LATE TO WIN ITS FIRST DIVISION II WORLD SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Daly's single scored Doug Noce in the eighth to break a 5-5 tie and Robert 
Hale's two-run triple later in the inning broke the game open as Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo defeated New Haven (Conn.), 9-5, to win the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. Division II World Series Friday night at Montgomery, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs (37-24), who lost their opening game to Lewis (Tenn.), last 
Saturday, came back to win five straight in the double-elimination tournament. 
It's the first title for Cal Poly, which was making its first appearance in the 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
New Haven ace Steve DiBartolomeo (17-2) took the loss, and Cal Poly reliever 
Bob Ryan (7-8) got the win. New Haven finished 36-5. 
</P>
<P>
DiBartolomeo was named the tournament's most valuable player. He threw 494 
pitches in five games during the tournament. He was 2-2 with one save. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly's Billy Smith, who got on base on an infield throwing error, scored on 
a sacrifice fly by Matt Drake to make it 4-4 in the top of the third. Todd Rice 
hit a sacrifice fly to right in the seventh, scoring Drake, who had doubled, to 
make it 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
In the top of the eighth, The Mustangs broke the 5-5 tie when Daly singled, 
scoring Noce; Drake singled, scoring Smith to make it 7-5, and Hale tripled, 
scoring Daly and Drake.

AGOURA TO FACE BIG BEAR FOR SOFTBALL TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Coach Linda Moule took over as Agoura High softball coach last year, she 
inherited a team that had won only one game in the two previous seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Moule, who coached the Chargers' junior varsity in 1987, has since turned the 
program around. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura tied Santa Paula for the Frontier League championship in 1988 and won 
the title outright this year with a 9-0 league record. The Chargers last won 
the league crown in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Now Agoura (22-2), which had never survived the first round of the Southern 
Section playoffs, will play for the 1-A Division championship. The Chargers, 
winners of 19 in a row after starting the season 3-2, will play second-seeded 
Big Bear at 2:30 p.m. Saturday at Mayfair Park in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
Because they lack experience in a major tournament championship, the Chargers 
are slightly numb to the feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"I know they're excited," Moule said. "But I don't think the real meaning of it 
has hit them yet." 
</P>
<P>
The realization should have sunk in Tuesday when Agoura eliminated top-seeded 
Paraclete, 10-3, in a semifinal. Big Bear defeated St. Bonaventure, 5-1, in the 
other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Big Bear (22-3) is no stranger to postseason play. The defending Small Schools 
Division champion is making its fifth consecutive playoff appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura (22-2), the fourth-seeded team, will rely on pitcher Melissa Thatcher -- 
the Frontier League's most valuable player -- in its attempt to dethrone Big 
Bear. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher (22-2), who has an earned-run average of 0.56 and averages six 
strikeouts a game, threw a four-hitter and struck out four against Paraclete. 
The sophomore right-hander is a low-ball pitcher who gets a lot of outs on 
ground balls. 
</P>
<P>
Big Bear, the De Anza League champion, will counter with starter Marjie Sievers 
(20-3), who has struck out 199 of the 547 batters she has faced this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers are led by catcher Lisa Little, the only senior on the team and, 
according to her coach, a sound defensive player. "We haven't had very many 
people steal against us this year," Moule said, adding that at 6-foot-1 she 
blocks the plate well. "If she puts her shoulder down, you can forget it." 
</P>
<P>
Little (.430 batting average) Jill Hartwig (.380) and Leslie North (.400) are 
the team's top batters. Wendy Baertschiger had three hits against Paraclete. 
</P>
<P>
Big Bear's Chelcee Clifton, Coach Mike Clifton's daughter, is batting a 
team-high .635 and has five home runs. She is also the team leader in runs 
batted in (39) and runs scored (40).

SAUGUS SEEKS BASEBALL TITLE IN 3-A FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saugus High will attempt to win the first baseball title in its 14-year history 
today when the Golden League champion Centurions play Kennedy of La Palma for 
the Southern Section 3-A Division championship at 1 p.m. at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"We've played some tough teams. But this team has really good chemistry," said 
Coach Doug Worley, who led Saugus to the 2-A Division title game in 1986 before 
losing to Artesia. "I think we're strong everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Especially when it comes to pitching. The game will bring to a close the 
magnificent high school career of senior right-hander Roger Salkeld, who 
probably will make a beeline for professional baseball after Monday's amateur 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld (6-foot-5, 210 pounds) is 13-0 with 168 strikeouts in 100 1/3 innings 
and is expected to be an early first-round draft choice, according to Sports 
Illustrated, ESPN and Baseball America. Salkeld's career record is 30-6 and he 
has 395 strikeouts in 257 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld, who posted his second postseason complete-game win in Tuesday's 10-3 
semifinal win over Ontario, is expected to start. Senior left-hander Scott 
Warr, who is 8-2 with a 1.77 earned-run average, is available for relief duty. 
Warr also leads Saugus (23-4-2) with seven home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy Coach Chris Pascal says that his team is ready and waiting for Salkeld. 
</P>
<P>
"Our guys are anxious to see the guy," Pascal said. "They respect him, but 
we're gonna go after him. My kids have risen to the occasion all year." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (25-5), which won the Garden Grove League title -- its first league 
title in 20 years -- has made a turnaround under Pascal. Last season, Kennedy 
posted its first winning record in 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
"There are liable to be some big boys on the hill," said Pascal, who is in his 
fourth year. 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish have their own 6-foot-5, hard-throwing right-hander. Senior 
Greg Hansell (12-1, 1.36 ERA) is scheduled to start. Hansell, a four-year 
varsity player, has posted two playoff wins and has a 23-12 career record. 
</P>
<P>
Senior right-hander Pete Montera (11-2, 0.95 ERA) also is 2-0 in the playoffs. 
Shortstop Steve Rath, another four-year varsity member, is batting .446 and has 
45 hits. 
</P>
<P>
For Saugus, senior outfielder Matt Tull is batting .448 with a school-record 14 
doubles this season. Senior center fielder Darrell Davis, who bats leadoff, has 
29 stolen bases. Davis stole a school-record 30 bases last season.

HART, CERRITOS TO PLAY FOR 4-A BASEBALL TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A list of the top baseball teams in the Southern Section 4-A Division is taped 
to a wall in the Cerritos High dugout. As the playoffs progressed, teams that 
were eliminated were crossed off. 
</P>
<P>
Now only two -- Cerritos and Hart -- remain. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Emard, the second-year coach at Cerritos who posted the list, would 
like to cross off Hart (23-6) after the 4-A title game at 4:30 p.m. today at 
Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
To do so, Cerritos (26-6) will have to shut down a high-powered offense that 
boasts seven starters batting better than .300 and has produced 57 hits and 57 
runs in four playoff games. Mark Mattingly (10-2), a senior right-hander, will 
start for the Cerritos. Mattingly, who has three wins and a save in four 
playoff games, has lost only to Westminster, a 7-4 winner over Hart in March, 
and Lakewood, ranked 13th in the nation by USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder Cobi Cradle, a three-year All-San Gabriel Valley League 
selection, is batting .470 and has 23 steals. Cradle, who has signed with Long 
Beach State, is one of seven starting seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Cradle is joined by Robert Hinds, a UCLA-bound shortstop who is batting .390 
and has 29 steals. Second baseman Curt Knabe is batting .410.

MARTINEZ STARTS FAST, HANGS ON TO WIN SINGLES

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a while Friday, it appeared as though St. Augustine's Ignacio Martinez was 
going to blow Hilltop's Francisco Santillan off the court in less than an hour. 
Santillan's unforced errors and Martinez's steady play were making for a very 
uneven match. 
</P>
<P>
But a funny thing happened on the way to Martinez's straight-set victory -- 
Santillan decided he wanted to play a little longer, picking up the pace and 
the pressure. Martinez faltered but then held on to win the San Diego Section 
boys' singles title, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), at the San Diego Tennis and Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
Efrem Zimbalist and Jason Wurl defeated Torrey Pines teammates Mike Kestler and 
Jim Sunderland, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), for the doubles championship. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 5-1, in the third set and facing match point, Santillan suddenly 
began to come in behind his backhand. The strategy enabled him to win the next 
three points to force an eighth game. 
</P>
<P>
Santillan, a junior from Cuernavaca, Mexico, held serve and then broke Martinez 
again with a backhand passing shot down the line. After Santillan held again to 
tie the set at 5-5, Martinez's throat began to tighten. 
</P>
<P>
"I was feeling kind of nervous," Martinez said. "I lost my confidence." 
</P>
<P>
And Santillan's began to grow. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was going to get the set," said Santillan, who last played 
Martinez some five years ago in a junior tournament in Mexico. "He wasn't doing 
what he was doing early. I think he thought he had the match. He started to 
miss shots." 
</P>
<P>
But in the 11th game, Martinez started to make them again and held serve. 
Santillan also held to force a tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez went up, 4-1, before Santillan scored three consecutive points to tie. 
Martinez hit an overhead winner, and Santillan netted a backhand volley to send 
it to match point. Martinez closed it out by lobbing Santillan, who barely 
netted a backhand. 
</P>
<P>
"He did what he had to do," Santillan said. "He played the big points pretty 
good." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez plans to play the Southern California sectionals later this month and 
the Mexican national tournament in Guadalajara in August. Santillan wants to go 
to Europe to play in some summer satellite tournaments. Both may return to this 
final next year; each is a junior. 
</P>
<P>
In doubles, Zimbalist and Wurl won the first set with ease, then had to fight 
back from 4-1 and 5-2 deficits in the second set to force the tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
Kestler, a senior, and Sunderland, only a sophomore, had a set point in the 
eighth game but let it slip away. From there, Zimbalist and Wurl began to take 
control. 
</P>
<P>
"We noticed their frustration," Wurl said. "We just tried to keep it in play." 
</P>
<P>
Zimbalist and Wurl, both seniors, had trailed, 3-0, Thursday in the third set 
of their semifinal before coming back to win. 
</P>
<P>
"Our pattern has been to win the first set easily then blow the next set and 
then come back in the third," Wurl said. "We realized today we couldn't let 
that happen." 
</P>
<P>
Zimbalist and Wurl, who also played together last year, were seeded No. 3, 
while Sunderland and Kestler were No. 5. The teams met in the Palomar League 
finals last month, with Zimbalist and Wurl winning in a third-set tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
"They were out to get us, but we wanted it really bad," said Zimbalist, 
grandson of actor Efrem Zimbalist Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Zimbalist plans to try and walk on at Northern Arizona next year. Wurl will 
attempt to do the same at USC.

MABEL BECKMAN, NOTED PHILANTHROPIST, DIES AT 88 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mabel Beckman, wife of Arnold O. Beckman, an inventor and entrepreneur who made 
a fortune developing and marketing scientific instruments, died early Thursday 
at her home in Corona del Mar. She was 88. 
</P>
<P>
She had been repeatedly hospitalized for cancer at Hoag Hospital in Newport 
Beach over the past two weeks, according to friends and hospital officials. 
</P>
<P>
During 64 years of marriage, the Beckmans were nearly inseparable. About 10 
years ago they formed a foundation to direct their philanthropy in support of 
scientific and medical research at hospitals and universities. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly disclosed gifts from the Arnold O. and Mabel M. Beckman Foundation 
total more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Among the gifts were $20 million for the construction and endowment of the 
western headquarters and study center of the National Academies of Sciences and 
Engineering in Irvine, more than $6 million to the Beckman Laser Institute on 
the campus of the UC Irvine College of Medicine, $40 million to establish a 
research center at Caltech and $2 million toward development of the Hoag Cancer 
Center at Hoag Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Friends of the couple said Arnold Beckman always relied upon his wife for 
advice in deciding which projects deserved support. He has said their goal was 
to distribute their personal fortune, once estimated to be in excess of $500 
million, before their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the money was realized from the sale in 1981 of Fullerton-based Beckman 
Instruments Inc., which Beckman founded in 1935, to SmithKline Corp. of 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
At Husband's Side 
</P>
<P>
Michael Berns, director of the Beckman Laser Institute and professor of surgery 
and cell biology at the UCI Medical School where he fills the Arnold and Mabel 
Beckman chair, said Mabel Beckman always showed up at her husband's side when 
the institute held meetings for members of the community who were interested in 
its work. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Stevens, president of Hoag Hospital, said: "Mabel Beckman was a very 
delightful person. I personally was very fond of her and will miss her." He 
said that when he informed members of the Hoag board of directors of her death, 
they remarked on the closeness of the Beckmans' marriage. "Despite his (Dr. 
Beckman's) eminence in the scientific community, they had a very down-to-earth, 
loving relationship," Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
Friends said Arnold Beckman likes to recount how he met his wife in 1918 when 
he was an 18-year-old Marine whose train arrived late to New York, causing him 
to miss a ship that had already set sail. Stranded in the city for 
Thanksgiving, he went to a dinner hosted by the Red Cross. One of the Red Cross 
volunteers whom he met at the dinner was Mabel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Employees Notified 
</P>
<P>
Elke Eastman, a spokeswoman for Beckman Instruments, said the company Thursday 
notified its employees throughout the world of Mabel Beckman's death because 
"Mrs. Beckman was a part of the company since its beginnings in 1935." 
</P>
<P>
Eastman said Arnold Beckman told her it was his wife's wish that no flowers be 
sent. She said he suggested that instead donations could be made to the Hoag 
Cancer Center. Details about funeral arrangements were not disclosed. Only 
family members will be invited to attend, Eastman said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides her husband, Mabel Beckman is survived by a daughter, Patricia, and a 
son, Arnold O. Beckman Jr., as well as grandchildren and great grandchildren.

SLASHER RUINS $50,000 MORE IN SUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN O'LEARY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An elusive vandal who slashes designer clothes at upscale stores is back at 
work with a vengeance, destroying six more suits over the Memorial Day weekend 
and bringing to $50,000 the total damage inflicted in the last six weeks alone. 
</P>
<P>
The heightened pace of the attacks, in which men's designer suits at mall 
stores are the primary targets, has frustrated police, worried merchants, and 
baffled psychiatrists, who suggest that the spree may represent anything from a 
prank to a protest against materialism. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no suspects, no (psychological) profile, no idea," said Mike 
Millington, a Costa Mesa police detective. "There is nothing to say it is the 
same person, but at the same time it could be one person." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the suits are men's, dark in color, 100% wool, sizes 38 to 46, and 
priced over $300. Most of the attacks have occurred at South Coast Plaza in 
Costa Mesa and Fashion Island in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
A small incision, usually around 2 inches long, is made in the coat "right 
about where the shoulder blade is," said Officer Bill Ellwood of the Costa Mesa 
Police Department. "The slacks are never touched." 
</P>
<P>
While authorities know what the vandal likes to destroy, they are uncertain 
about the motive. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, these are not feelings of love that he is trying to express," said 
Dr. Kaushal Sharma, a psychiatrist who specializes in criminal behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The slasher may feel hostility toward department stores or against expensive 
designer-label clothes, possibly because he or someone he loves was fired by a 
department store, Sharma said. 
</P>
<P>
"But we can be thrown off track by concentrating too much on the clothes," he 
said. While it is clear that the person is expressing anger, without more 
information the actual motivation cannot be known, Sharma said. "With this 
little evidence, we can't do a psychological profile," Sharma said. 
</P>
<P>
"This person has to be mentally intact, not psychotic. He or she needs to be 
functioning reasonably well to do one after another (acts of vandalism) and not 
get caught," Sharma observed. 
</P>
<P>
The slasher may be "ventilating his anger toward symbols of wealth and 
affluence, making a statement about the unequal distribution of wealth that 
borders on a quasi-political statement," said Charles Grob, assistant professor 
of psychiatry and human behavior at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Crinella, a clinical professor of psychiatry at UCI, said the culprit 
sounded "more like a prankster than an angry vandal." 
</P>
<P>
The vandalism is "certainly destructive and a great concern to merchants, but 
the behavior sounds basically mischievous," said Crinella, comparing it to 
college pranks. 
</P>
<P>
Catching the slasher, who is believed to have operated for two years, is 
difficult because there is no pattern to the incidents, and police lack 
resources, Millington said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the manpower," said Millington. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for detectives is that, thus far, there are no evidence and no 
witnesses, and "it is difficult to do much with that type of crime," Millington 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast with psychiatrists, stores that have been victims were very 
cautious about discussing the recent attacks. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't comment on security," said Linda Luna, a spokesperson for Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
"The stores are extremely concerned, they want this guy arrested," Officer 
Aaron Thomas of the Costa Mesa police said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't patrol every store. . . . We're out in parking lots watching for 
vehicle burglaries and dealing with shoplifters," Thomas said. "These stores 
have their own security. . . . If anyone is going to catch them, it will be 
internal security." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Khilcott, manager of Nordstrom at South Coast Plaza, said that the 
merchandise is "damaged goods that are not usable or sellable." Neither 
Nordstrom nor Robinson's (another store hit by the slasher) would respond to 
inquires about what they do with the damaged suits. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last six weeks, at least 87 designer suits, the majority of them 
men's, have been slashed. There have been at least six separate attacks on 
local retailers, usually such major department stores as Robinson's, Neiman 
Marcus and Nordstrom, but a small tennis accessories store on Fashion Island 
has also been hit. 
</P>
<P>
A similar series of clothes slashings was reported between November, 1986, and 
July, 1987, at South Coast Plaza and Fashion Island in which more than $48,000 
in damage was inflicted. 
</P>
<P>
After an 18-month lull, men's suits at Harris &amp; Frank in South Coast Plaza 
were slashed in January, with losses totaling $2,270, Police Officer Ellwood 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
On April 24, at South Coast Plaza, more than $22,000 worth of expensive men's 
suits, dress shoes and jogging clothes at Nordstrom and Bullock's department 
stores were slashed. On the weekend of May 6 and 7 at Fashion Island, 30 ruined 
suits worth $18,000 were discovered at Robinson's and eight slashed suits worth 
$5,600 were found at Neiman Marcus. The next week three Sergio Tacchini warm-up 
suits were discovered cut at Forty Love, a tennis accessory shop at Fashion 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, eight suits, priced between $350 and $490, and one red blouse, were 
found cut at Robinson's in South Coast Plaza. Then on Saturday there was 
another episode at Robinson's when two black Nino Cerruti suits and one gray 
Evan Picone suit were discovered slit. The one unusual feature about the 
Saturday attack was that the slashes were 3 to 4 inches long, Ellwood said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the last reported attack occurred on Monday at Nordstrom in South 
Coast Plaza when three suits worth $1,020 were discovered slashed.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
SHOOTING GALLERY DEATH IS RULED A SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The death of a 19-year-old man who shot himself Thursday night at a public 
shooting gallery was not an accident but a suicide, the Orange County coroner's 
office said on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Ricky Son Dang of Huntington Beach, died after shooting himself in 
the head at 7:44 p.m. at the Firing Line, 17921 Jamestown Lane. Police 
initially reported the death as an accidental shooting. 
</P>
<P>
But on Friday, authorities said that subsequent investigation determined that 
the man deliberately shot himself. 
</P>
<P>
Apparent reasons were the young man's despondence over "education and family 
problems," authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Police Lt. Charles Poe said Friday that investigators found 
that Dang went to the shooting gallery Thursday night with several male 
teen-age friends. Poe said Dang rented a .380-caliber pistol, put it to his 
head and shot himself. Poe said Dang did not disclose his suicide intentions to 
his friends and fired the shot with no warning. The young friends "were shocked 
and stunned," Poe said.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: SANTA ANA; 
</P>
<P>
DMV OFFICE CLOSES FOR REMODELING JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Come Monday, it will take a bit more driving for Santa Ana motorists to take 
care of their DMV business. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Motor Vehicles office at 1330 E. 1st St. closed its doors at 
5 p.m. Friday for seven months. During that time, asbestos will be removed from 
walls, an elevator will be installed, restrooms will be redone to accommodate 
the handicapped, a new air-conditioning system will be added, and the interior 
will be repainted. 
</P>
<P>
The services provided by the Santa Ana office will be divided among other 
offices in the county until the remodeling is finished, according to Jeanne 
Tibbets, the Santa Ana office manager. 
</P>
<P>
The driver's license services will move one mile north, to an office building 
at 1345 N. Grand Ave. The temporary office will have about half of the 58 Santa 
Ana employees there to issue licenses and California identification cards, 
Tibbets said. Although the temporary Santa Ana office will administer the 
written driver's license test, no road tests will be given there. Drivers will 
have to go to one of the other DMV offices -- in Westminster, Fullerton or 
Costa Mesa -- to complete that part of the test, Tibbets said. 
</P>
<P>
The auto-registration portion will also be handled by existing DMV offices, and 
the remainder of the Santa Ana DMV staff will be reassigned to these offices, 
she said. In order to handle the extra workload, the offices will extend their 
hours, opening at 7 a.m. and closing at 6 p.m., adding two hours to the usual 
8-a.m.-to-5-p.m. day. 
</P>
<P>
The relocation of services during the Santa Ana office's remodeling is similar 
to the plan used when the Westminster office was renovated a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Tibbets said she hopes that drivers will not be inconvenienced or have to wait 
in longer lines. "We hope we've compensated by the longer hours," she said. "It 
should work out because of our experience with the Westminster office. We had 
their personnel and clients here, and we were able to handle it." 
</P>
<P>
The addresses for the other offices are 650 West 19th St., Costa Mesa; 909 W. 
Valencia Drive, Fullerton, and 13700 Hoover St., Westminster.

MAN HELD ON SUSPICION OF MOLESTING 6 CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 64-year-old Santa Ana widower has been arrested on suspicion of sexually 
molesting at least six children in his neighborhood over the past two years and 
forcing them to pose for pornographic photos, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Seferino Sarinana, 64, a retired laborer, was arrested May 24 on 26 felony 
counts of child molestation, Santa Ana police investigator Benny Rodriguez 
said. Sarinana is being held in Orange County Jail without bail pending 
arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said a 7-year-old neighbor implicated Sarinana during an interview at 
Orangewood Children's Home in Orange where the child, a victim of physical 
abuse by her father, had been medically examined. The exam showed evidence of 
sexual molestation, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
"She disclosed names to me of other children who frequented (Sarinana's) 
residence often," the officer said. "Subsequent interviews of those children 
led to other names of child victims." Sarinana allegedly threatened the 
children with force, including the use of an unspecified weapon, Rodriguez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sarinana was arrested at his home without incident. The six alleged molestation 
victims were taken to Orangewood where they were examined and held for six days 
before being returned to their parents, Rodriguez added. 
</P>
<P>
A search of Sarinana's duplex, in the 800 block of North Gunther Street where 
he lived alone, revealed photographs of more neighborhood children under the 
age of 14 in pornographic poses, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer said he finished interviewing several children who were 
photographed on Friday and expected that related charges involving three more 
victims would be filed against Sarinana. 
</P>
<P>
Sarinana had lived for more than 30 years in the stable, working-class Latino 
neighborhood where "everybody knows everybody," Rodriguez said. "They all knew 
him. He was a typical nice guy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He's a grandfather-type figure," Rodriguez said. "He'd buy them (the victims) 
whatever they needed. Toys. Clothing." 
</P>
<P>
Children, mostly between the ages of 7 and 11, came to Sarinana's house at "all 
hours of the day," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the victims are traumatized, the officer said, and are undergoing 
therapy through the Orange County Child Abuse Service Team at Orangewood. 
</P>
<P>
Their parents, he added, are in "total shock. They couldn't believe it. How 
could it happen to their neighborhood? Or their child?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those things that happens every once in a while to a neighborhood. 
You never know who your neighbor is going to be."

HOPE SEEN IN COUNSELING; 
</P>
<P>
JUVENILES ARE INVOLVED IN MOST ARSON FIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN O'LEARY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Juveniles are involved in 82% of all fires that are intentionally set, but the 
destructive tendencies of young arsonists can be controlled with counseling, 
experts at a statewide conference in Anaheim said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Participants at the two-day conference at the Inn at the Park hotel, sponsored 
by the Orange County Burn Assn., were told that juvenile arson can be 
controlled through the cooperative efforts of firefighters, mental-health 
professionals and educators. 
</P>
<P>
In California, 38 deaths and more than 450 injuries were caused by fires 
started by children in the last three years, said state Fire Marshal James F. 
McMullen, the keynote speaker. 
</P>
<P>
"Nationally, during 1986 alone, children playing with fire caused nearly 
100,000 fires that did about $200 million worth of damage, caused 4,000 
injuries and led to over 300 deaths," McMullen said. Experts said young fire 
starters fall into three categories: 
</P>
<P>
* Children between ages 2 and 7 usually play with fire out of innocent 
curiosity. A total of 65% of the children who have started fires over the past 
two years were simply playing with fire, McMullen said. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably half of all children have played with matches," according to 
McMullen. Parents should teach their children that there are friendly and 
unfriendly fires and that "even friendly fires can burn and injure you," 
McMullen said. 
</P>
<P>
* Children ages 7 to 11 are more likely to set fires in response to a crisis, 
such as abuse, neglect or the remarriage of a parent. These children have some 
understanding of the consequences of their actions and are often seeking 
attention, McMullen said. 
</P>
<P>
* Finally, the majority of recurrent fire setters are delinquents, usually ages 
11 through 14, requiring special help. 
</P>
<P>
Of all arson fires in 1987, juveniles were responsible for 25% and were 
involved with an adult in another 57%, for an 82% total, McMullen said. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers said that under California law, at age 12 a child becomes legally 
responsible for his or her actions, McMullen said. Several experts noted that 
parents of young arsonists may be potentially responsible for the damage done 
by their children. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional responses to the juvenile arsonist are expanding beyond 
firefighters, according to several speakers. 
</P>
<P>
"What is needed is a multidisciplinary approach that includes educators, 
mental-health professionals, the legal community as well as firefighters," said 
Clyde Bragdon, the chief fire official for the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
"We can suppress the firesetting behavior in all three age groups if we can get 
the child in for treatment," said Kenneth Fineman, a psychologist who 
specializes in dealing with young arsonists.

BUILDER GETS PROMISE FOR PAY, PLANS TO RETURN TO AIRPORT JOB

The firm building an elevated roadway at John Wayne Airport refused to work 
Friday in a pay dispute but is expected to return Monday after receiving a 
promise that it will be paid $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
James McGee, attorney for Kettering-Krussman Inc. of Artesia, said a tentative 
agreement was reached Friday morning in which the firm would return workers to 
the construction site Monday morning to pour concrete it had been scheduled to 
pour Friday. 
</P>
<P>
McGee said, however, that the employees will not perform any work Monday unless 
the $300,000 has actually been received. The firm claims that it is owed a 
total of $1.3 million for the project. 
</P>
<P>
Kettering-Krussman's 60-person work crew did not report to the job site Friday 
after being told late Thursday that it should not return until the pay issue 
was settled. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Godwin, a project supervisor for general contractor Taylor Woodrow 
California Construction Ltd., said his firm agreed during a negotiating session 
Friday morning to make the payment.

Godwin said the company had been at odds with Kettering-Krussman over "other 
contractual matters" that led to the dispute, but he declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the county paid the Taylor Woodrow firm $1.74 million on Friday for 
work done in April on the roadway and a garage project. Taylor Woodrow 
officials had complained that the payment was overdue, but county officials 
said Taylor Woodrow had not filed adequately documented payment requests. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Elliott, project manager for the Taylor Woodrow firm, said Friday: "The 
county is nit-picking and nickeling and diming us to death." Elliott denied, 
however, that payment problems were threatening his firm's ability to stay on 
the $310-million John Wayne Airport expansion project.

POLICE LOOK AT DRUG SALES AS MURDER MOTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anaheim police are investigating reports of cocaine trafficking in an attempt 
to determine a motive for the May 31 gunshot slaying of an Anaheim couple, 
authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"That is definitely one of the avenues," said Anaheim Police Sgt. Chet Barry. 
"We are looking at that information, and we are concerned." 
</P>
<P>
So far, he said, investigators have no substantial leads in the deaths of Louis 
Arturo Herrera, 24, and his girlfriend, Diane Patrice Swarbrick, 23, whose 
bodies were found in their apartment at 729 S. Knott Ave. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera had been shot three times in the head and Swarbrick twice in the chest, 
Barry said. Coroner's deputies placed the time of death around 2:30 a.m. 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
According to investigators, a neighbor reported hearing five shots and saw two 
men leave the apartment about that time. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies were discovered later in the day, after the couple's 20-month-old 
daughter and Herrera's 18-month-old son made their way out of the apartment and 
told a neighbor, "Mommy has a boo-boo and I can't wake her up." 
</P>
<P>
Both children were apparently in the apartment at the time of the shooting and 
alone with the bodies for 10 hours, Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera was reportedly awaiting trial on theft charges at the time of his 
death, but Barry said investigators have no reason to link the slayings with 
the court appearance.

Buena High School pitcher Kim Maher hit the fourth pitch of the game over the 
center-field fence and made the run stand up to lead the Bulldogs to a 1-0 
victory over Western in the Southern Section 4-A softball championship game 
Friday at Mayfair Park in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
Western (26-6), which upset top-seeded Hart and fourth-seeded Kennedy to make 
the final, ran out of offense in the championship game, managing only one hit 
off Maher (24-2). 
</P>
<P>
Buena (28-2), on the other hand, had five hits off Western's freshman pitcher 
Dawn Fowler (14-5), but the first hit was all the Bulldogs needed. 
</P>
<P>
On a one-ball and two-strike count, Maher made solid contact, sending a long 
fly ball over center fielder Tania Sieks' head. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was going over the bleachers," Western Coach Debbie Harless said. 
"I was in shock. That one pitch didn't drop. It was hanging up there and she 
just poked it, but Fowler pitched great the rest of the way." 
</P>
<P>
Fowler, 14, pitched a five-hitter with eight strikeouts and two walks. 
</P>
<P>
Western played well defensively, particularly catcher Lisa Sciarrino, who 
picked off a runner at first base in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
She also threw out a runner attempting to take third on an overthrow from 
center field to second with one out and two runners on in the top of the 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth inning, Buena's Annette Bell reached on an error and advanced to 
second on a wild pitch. Maher hit a high chopper over third. Misty Pinkerton 
stretched overhead to snag the ball and prevent it from going into the 
outfield, then caught Bell trying to advance to third in a rundown. Her sister, 
shortstop Ivy Pinkerton, eventually tagged Bell out to retire the side. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensively we played great," Harless said. "We just had a hard time hitting. 
When you're not hitting, how do you win?" 
</P>
<P>
No Western runners reached base through the first five innings. The Pioneers' 
lone hit, Misty Pinkerton's bloop single to right-center, came in the sixth 
with one out. Pinkerton advanced to second on Dena Petersen's sacrifice bunt, 
bringing up leadoff hitter Sieks. 
</P>
<P>
Sieks hit a sharp line drive back to Maher, who stabbed it for the final out of 
the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Western's final scoring opportunity came in the bottom of the seventh. Collene 
Conahan reached on an error to start the inning. The next two batters grounded 
out, with Conahan advancing to third. 
</P>
<P>
But freshman Beth Queypo struck out, leaving Conahan on third to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
Maher was not the best pitcher her players faced, Harless said. Nonetheless, 
her dropping curve seemed to give the Western hitters trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"She threw smart and hit the ball hard," Harless said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers were distracted earlier in the week when shortstop Ivy Pinkerton 
temporarily quit the team because she wanted to attend Western's senior prom, 
which was also Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
But Harless said she was not going to blame the loss on the prom distraction. 
</P>
<P>
"The girls were here to play. They played hard," she said. "I think they are 
champions just for getting this far. We beat the number one-seeded team (Hart) 
and Kennedy too.

MISSION VIEJO'S BOND FEELS A TIE TO THIS GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amy Bond, Mission Viejo High School center fielder, asks that we ignore her if 
she rambles on about baseball. It's just that she is a self-proclaimed "nut" 
about the sport. 
</P>
<P>
A sample: "I have always been brought up on the glory of the underdog. Ever 
since I was about 7, I have been brought up knowing the ballplayers on the 1955 
Brooklyn Dodgers. They were the boys of summer. They faced the Yankees and they 
won (the World Series). 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the excitement of the Brooklyn Dodgers was that it was a ball club 
made up of all kinds of -- I like to call 'em winkies -- not the greatest 
hitters and not a whole lot of talented players, but with a lot of heart and 
hustle, they pulled it together and that is the motto I like to live by." 
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that Bond doesn't just enjoy baseball and softball, she reveres 
them. And, like some of the players on that 1955 Dodger team, she considers 
herself a bit of a winkie and Mission Viejo a bit of an underdog. 
</P>
<P>
The Diablos (18-10), who got an at-large berth and then upset top-seeded La 
Mirada in the second round, are playing second-seeded Covina (25-0-1) for the 
Southern Section 3-A title at 5:30 tonight at Mayfair Park in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
Bond, with a sacrifice bunt here and a few highlight-film catches there, has 
been a major factor in Mission Viejo's success this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically she is the consummate team player," Diablo Coach Jeff Cunningham 
said. "She has sacrificed herself consistently throughout the year. In her 
position in the batting order we ask her to do a lot, instead of just trying to 
pull the ball or go for her own individual stats." 
</P>
<P>
Bond follows co-captain Renee Pina, whom Cunningham calls the "prototype 
leadoff hitter for softball -- someone who gets the ball on the ground, who is 
left-handed with good speed, who can slap and has great bat control." 
</P>
<P>
Pina, a first baseman, hit .400, scored 19 runs and stole 10 bases this season. 
She is hitting .363 in the playoffs. Bond is hitting .197 this season, but has 
scored 12 runs, driven in eight and has 13 sacrifice bunts. 
</P>
<P>
Pina is the catalyst of the offense, but Bond has given the team a boost with 
spectacular game-saving catches in three of four playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
Against top-seeded La Mirada, with runners on second and third and two outs, 
she made a diving catch to save the Diablos' 2-1 victory. Against Montclair, 
she charged a ball in shallow center field and rifled a perfect throw to get a 
runner at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
When conversation turns to defense, Bond hagain goes into her rambling reverie: 
</P>
<P>
"I used to be a big Chicago Cub fan. There was an outfielder by the name of Mel 
Hall. I used to watch him play and he made some of the most fantastic diving 
catches I have ever seen . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I have always analyzed outfielders and watched their moves. I have learned a 
lot about the unseen things that go on in a baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm really on when the ball is in flight, I can see the seams. It's kind 
of a strange phenomenon. When a ball is hit, it's almost as if something inside 
clicks. At the time I'm not even sure where I'm going or what I'm doing, and 
all of a sudden I'm in mid-air. And I will look over into the web of my glove 
and I will have caught it. Everything is in complete slow motion." 
</P>
<P>
The key to Bond's success in the outfield is her intensity. 
</P>
<P>
"Every single play, every single pitch of every game, she is 100 percent into 
it," Cunningham said. "She might go two games without making a play, but she is 
never mentally out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Bond's love of the game and defense were instilled in her by her dad, Mike 
Bond. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to go out to the parks and my dad used to throw balls and chuck the 
ball over my head and I would run and catch the ball. I get really teary-eyed 
over it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Making the catch is almost an out-of-body experience for Bond. 
</P>
<P>
"When you snag it in the web and hit the grass and slide, and you can feel it 
in the web of the glove and you know you have caught it. To me, if I can make 
one of those, I feel my job has been done," she said. "It feels unbelievable. 
Sometimes the adrenaline gets going so much I feel like I could turn back flips 
and still catch the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Her teammates have come to accept her great catches as routine. They also have 
gotten comfortable with success. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to believe we've come this far, being the underdogs," Pina said. 
"Just at practice today (Friday) . . . we don't even think about losing. We 
think about getting those patches and playing our game. We want that CIF win."

DANA HILLS' RICH SKELTON IS SUSPENDED; 
</P>
<P>
'UNDUE INFLUENCE' WITH STUDENT COSTS HIM ONE SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rich Skelton, who in his first year as boys' basketball coach at Dana Hills 
High School led the Dolphins to the Southern Section 5-A playoffs last 
February, will not coach the team next season. 
</P>
<P>
He has been suspended from his coaching duties for one year by the Capistrano 
Unified School District for using "undue influence" with a student-athlete. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Thomas, Southern Section commissioner, ruled that Skelton violated Rule 
510 of the California Interscholastic Federation's bylaws by making contact 
with a parent and a student before the student's enrollment at Dana Hills by 
temporarily housing the student at the coach's home. 
</P>
<P>
District officials agreed with Thomas' ruling that Skelton violated the rule by 
responding to contacts made to him by the student's father prior to the boy's 
enrollment at Dana Hills. Skelton also provided temporary housing for the 
student for approximately three weeks during the family's relocation to a 
permanent residence within the school's attendance boundary. 
</P>
<P>
Skelton will continue to teach history at Dana Hills next year, but will not be 
allowed to have contact with the school's basketball program or its players 
until the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Skelton agrees he used poor judgement in this situation, but at the 
time, he felt he was within CIF (Southern Section) rules as he understood them 
when he was contacted by the parent of the student involved," said John Smart, 
Dana Hills principal. 
</P>
<P>
Before coming to Dana Hills, Skelton, 46, spent 12 years as a high school head 
coach, including four years at San Clemente.

EDISON'S TAYLOR LEARNS A LESSON WHILE QUALIFYING IN 1,600 
</P>

<P>
Edison High School freshman Shelley Taylor learned a quick lesson about the 
quality of competition found at the State track and field championships Friday 
night at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Her teacher? Rancho Buena Vista's Kira Jorgensen. 
</P>
<P>
Running in a preliminary heat of the girls' 1,600 meters, Jorgensen, the 
two-time defending State champion at 1,600 meters and a two-time national 
champion in cross-country, cruised to an easy victory in 4 minutes 55.44 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Athletes who won their heat, plus the next five fastest overall, qualified for 
tonight's finals, beginning at Cerritos College at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who despite being in her first year of competitive running had not lost 
a 1,600-meter race since mid-April, could only watch as Jorgensen loped away at 
the start for a commanding lead. Taylor started out in mid-pack and eventually 
made her way to second, where she finished in 4:58.77, a half-second personal 
improvement and good enough to qualify for tonight's final. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's improvement, her fourth in as many races, didn't seem to satisfy her, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel great in the race," she said. "I guess I put a lot of pressure 
on myself (to win). I think I expect too much out of myself sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Although Taylor wasn't impressed with her finish, Jorgensen certainly was. Said 
Jorgensen: "She's not depressed is she? She should be proud of herself, 
especially making it this far as a freshman. I never made it to State finals as 
a freshman." 
</P>
<P>
In the boys' 1,600, Mater Dei's Mike Nielsen advanced with a third-place finish 
in his heat in 4:15.05, the fifth-fastest time overall. Nielsen, who last year 
did not advance past the Southern Section preliminaries, started out in 
mid-pack, then gradually worked his way into fourth. 
</P>
<P>
With 200 meters to go, Nielsen, trying to maintain his crisp, efficient stride, 
charged to third and then tried to catch Burbank's Todd Lewis and Arroyo 
Grande's Louie Quintana but could not. Lewis won in 4:12.66, and Quintana was 
second in 4:13.00. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt pretty good," Nielsen said. "I think I have a lot left. They went by me 
and beat me fair and square." 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar's Eddie Lavelle finished a surprising and disappointing eighth 
in his 1,600 heat and did not advance. Lavelle, who has a best time -- and 
county-leading time -- of 4:11.95, came through the first 300 meters fourth 
from last but worked his way into what appeared to be a comfortable third. 
</P>
<P>
But with 200 meters to go, Lavelle faded and, without a kick, dropped to 
eighth. After the race, he walked off the track with a noticeable limp, his 
left shin bleeding from spike marks. 
</P>
<P>
After a disappointing finish in the long jump, Canyon's Allison Franke 
qualified in her specialty, the discus, with a toss of 151-feet-10, fourth best 
overall. Franke, who fouled twice in the long jump before leaping 17-7, made up 
for the disappointment with an discus series of 151-5, 151-10 and 150-8. 
Bakersfield's Melisa Weis leads the field at 163-9, her first and only throw of 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' shotput, Irvine's Bev Oden advanced with a mark of 40-9, 
eighth-best overall. Edison's Leslee Briggs, the county's season leader at 
41-11 1/2, fouled on two of her three attempts. Her only legal mark was 39-8, 
which tied her for tenth. Only 2 3/4 inches separated Briggs from advancing to 
tonight's final. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' high jump, El Dorado's Lori Svoboda advanced with a leap of 5-6. 
That mark tied her for first with defending state champion Crissy Mills of 
North Hollywood Campbell Hall. Svoboda, who defeated Mills last Friday to win 
the Masters title, passed on the first three heights, cleared 5-4 on her first 
attempt, passed at 5-5 and cleared 5-6 again on her first try. Mills duplicated 
Svoboda's series exactly. 
</P>
<P>
Other county athletes who advanced to tonight's finals were Edison's Doug 
Nichols (sixth-best 800 at 1:54.11); Capistrano Valley's Laurinda Mulhaupt 
(fifth-best 800 at 2:15.38); Magnolia's Phouphet Singbandith (fourth-best 
triple jump at 49-7 3/4); Westminster's Shelly Tochluk (the final 400 qualifier 
at 56.34); Valencia's Eric Whitcomb, and Irvine's Sean Rogan (both 14-4 in the 
pole vault); Edison's Greg Thurston (56-3 3/4 shotput) and Edison's boys' 
1,600-meter relay team (3:19.84). 
</P>
<P>
State Meet Notes 
</P>
<P>
The boys' and girls' 3,200-meter finals are tonight and include Santa Ana 
Valley's Jimmy Rodriguez and Katella sophomore Martha Pinto . . . Other county 
athletes whose season came to an end Friday included: Esperanza's Chuck 
Underwood (54-2 1/2 shotput); Foothill's Elizabeth Bauer (5-2 in the high 
jump); Woodbridge's Louie Muniz (39.56 in the 300 hurdles); Sonora's Shannon 
Bryant (300 hurdles); Mater Dei sophomore Melissa McDonald (17-11 1/4 in the 
long jump); Mission Viejo's Allison Axtell (17-5 in the long jump); San 
Clemente sophomore Tim Martin (10.77 in the 100 meters; ties for alternate 
position); Foothill's Janette Reed (2:21 in the 800).

<P>
FIDELITY NATIONAL BUYS HAMMOND CO. STAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fidelity National Financial Inc. in Irvine said Friday it has bought a 16.3% 
stake in the Hammond Co. and will try to gain a seat on the board of the 
Newport Beach-based mortgage banking firm. 
</P>
<P>
Fidelity, a title insurance company operating in 30 states, purchased the stock 
to set up a working relationship with Hammond, said Frank P. Willey, Fidelity's 
executive vice president and general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Fidelity hopes to offer title policies to those who take home loans out through 
Hammond, Willey said. But he emphasized that any such working relationship 
would be strictly on a friendly basis. 
</P>
<P>
In its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Fidelity said it was 
purchasing the stock for investment purposes only. Willey said the company 
would consider purchasing more stock but does not intend to turn its purchases 
into a takeover attempt or a "hostile situation." 
</P>
<P>
He said his colleagues plan to talk with Hammond executives soon to discuss 
working together and giving Fidelity a seat on the board at the next annual 
meeting of shareholders, scheduled for July 25. 
</P>
<P>
With the purchase, Fidelity becomes Hammond's second largest shareholder and 
would be entitled to one seat on the board. But Willey said his company does 
not want to force its way on to the board. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas T. Hammond, the company's chairman and president, owns 32.5% of the 
stock. He and five other board members own more than 43% of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond said he did not know if he would willingly accept any Fidelity 
representatives on the board. While Fidelity's managers are "well-regarded," he 
said, "I just don't know them." 
</P>
<P>
Fidelity started buying its shares April 20 on the open market, the SEC filing 
states. It picked up 77,785 shares in five transactions over the next month for 
prices ranging from $3.50 a share to $5 a share. On May 24, it purchased its 
biggest block, 255,500 shares, for $5 a share from Clark Estates Inc., a New 
York investment manager. 
</P>
<P>
The Hammond Co. is trying to buy back 13.5% of its stock in an effort to 
enhance the stock, which executives believe is undervalued. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock price had been steadily declining since the spring of 1987 
when it was selling for $8.75 a share. It hit a low of $2.50 a share during the 
first three months this year and has been climbing since. It closed Friday at 
$5 a share, unchanged from Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
The company recently reported a loss of $1.1 million for the 1989 fiscal year, 
ended March 31. Hammond attributed the loss to fewer new loans, lower interest 
income and a $450,000 write-off related to its failed bid last fall to buy 
Mission Savings &amp; Loan in Riverside.

RETIREMENT FUND WILL SELL, NOT REDO, ANAHEIM PLAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owner of the Anaheim Plaza mall has decided to sell the center rather than 
spend millions to renovate it, a spokeswoman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The California State Teachers Retirement System pension fund, which owns the 
center, made the decision to sell the mall this week after receiving several 
unsolicited offers from developers interested in buying it, said Charlotte 
Ellis, vice president of marketing for the Lehndorff Group in Dallas, the 
property manager for the mall. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the flurry of inquiries from developers about the 34-year-old 
mall are not clear. The result, however, Ellis said, is that the pension fund 
plans to hire a Wall Street investment firm to actively market the 
827,000-square-foot center. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Plaza has for some time suffered from sagging sales and a loss of 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the center reported the sharpest sales drop of any county mall; its 
taxable sales had slipped 5.6% to $84 million. In 1987 -- the last year for 
which numbers are available -- sales dipped 1.2% to $83 million, ranking it No. 
10 in sales among the county's 13 major malls, according to the State Board of 
Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
The mall suffered a serious blow last year when Robinson's closed its store 
there. The building it occupied -- now owned by the pension fund -- is vacant. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's departure left only the Broadway and Mervyn's department stores as 
anchor tenants. The vacancy rate at the mall is now 31%, Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Renovated in Early 1970s 
</P>
<P>
Last December, in a move intended to boost sales, the pension fund approved a 
multimillion-dollar face-lift for the mall, last updated in the early 1970s. 
Elaborate plans called for new entrance facades and awnings, brighter lighting, 
new windows and floors, and outdoor seating. Long-range plans called for adding 
two department stores, a second retail level and possibly a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
But spending the money to renovate, Ellis said, would have involved "a certain 
amount of risk -- and it's a greater risk than a pension fund ordinarily can 
take." 
</P>
<P>
Pension fund officials in Sacramento could not be reached Friday.

FBI IN PHOENIX JOINS PROBE OF LINCOLN S &amp; L 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer

<P>
The FBI office in Phoenix has decided to open a preliminary inquiry into the 
affairs of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan and its parent firm, American Continental 
Corp., the special agent in charge of the office said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona agents will coordinate their inquiry with a federal grand jury and the 
FBI office in Los Angeles, where a criminal investigation already has been 
launched, Special Agent Herb Hawkins said in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins said a preliminary inquiry is a routine step "to determine if further 
facts warrant a more detailed investigation" of Lincoln or American 
Continental, which filed for bankruptcy on April 13. Lincoln, an Irvine thrift 
with major operations in Arizona, was seized by federal regulators the next 
day. 
</P>
<P>
A. Melvin McDonald, a Phoenix lawyer representing American Continental, said 
the Phoenix FBI office has asked for a list of corporate bondholders. About 
22,000 investors bought around $200 million in bonds through Lincoln's 29 
branches in Southern California. Those bonds now are nearly worthless, and the 
bondholders are near the bottom of the list of American Continental creditors 
who hope to recover funds from U.S. Bankruptcy Court proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental denies any wrongdoing and welcomes the FBI inquiry, 
McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Home Loan Bank Board has asked for a criminal investigation into 
allegations that American Continental officials illegally profited from their 
operation of Lincoln. A federal official has said the alleged misdeeds include 
improper insider loans, fraudulent land sales and manipulation of stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission also has been investigating the company.

THEATERS PITCH IN TO HELP ART SURVIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Things are looking up -- slightly -- at the Alternative Repertory Theatre in 
Santa Ana, which is faced with a financial crisis because of poor attendance. 
</P>
<P>
The plucky troupe drew an overflow audience last Saturday for its production of 
William Hanley's "Slow Dance on the Killing Ground," according to artistic 
director Patricia Terry. So far, Terry said, ART has raised $1,000 toward the 
$7,000 it needs by mid-June to survive. "Slow Dance" runs Fridays and Saturdays 
through June 17. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the local theater community has responded to news of the 
troupe's plight by donating items for auction at a fund-raiser, "The Slaves to 
ART Parking Lot Sale," to be held June 10 at the storefront theater (1636 S. 
Grand Ave.) from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Playhouse has offered a pair of season tickets to its 1989-90 
subscription series at the Moulton Theatre, as well as a pair of season tickets 
to its youth drama series. 
</P>
<P>
The Grove Shakespeare Festival has given a pair of tickets to a production this 
summer at the Festival Amphitheatre. And South Coast Repertory has donated a 
pair to "Sunday in the Park With George," the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine 
musical now in previews for a June 9 opening. 
</P>
<P>
"We also have three sets of dinners from various restaurants," Terry said, "and 
we're thinking of putting together a dinner-theater package." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, The L.P.R. Dinner Theatre in Tustin, reported elsewhere as folding, 
is very much alive and "far from closing," said board member Suzi Cunningham. 
"Things are looking very good." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the company is about to offer two shows rather than the usual one to 
maximize use of its 150-seat storefront theater (15732 D. Tustin Village Way) 
</P>
<P>
"Play It Again, Sam," Woody Allen's comedy about a neurotic divorce who 
idolizes Humphrey Bogart, opened there last night and will run Thursdays 
through Saturdays in the evenings with matinees on Sundays through July 30. 
</P>
<P>
"Tracers," a wrenching Vietnam war drama conceived by John DiFusco, will be 
offered on Mondays and Tuesdays in the evenings through the month of July. This 
show, which is being staged by an independent producer, will pre-empt "Play It 
Again, Sam" for its opening two performances, June 15 and 16. 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute. "Tracers?" At a dinner theater? The producers thought of that 
and have decided that during this engagement, no dinners will be served. Maybe 
just hors d'oeuvres.

HARRIET'S HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
FOR YEARS NELSONS' WEEKEND RETREAT, LAGUNA BEACH HIDEAWAY IS NOW HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a cool breeze blowing in off the steel-gray ocean below, Harriet Nelson 
stood on the deck of her cliff-top Laguna Beach house and remembered warmer 
days. 
</P>
<P>
"Ozzie would swim way out past the rocks, and then he'd swim all the way down 
there," she said, pointing to the rocks off Victoria Beach to the north and 
then down to Blue Lagoon a half mile to the south. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first came down here he'd swim twice a day and play volleyball with 
all the kids," she said, adding with a throaty laugh: "He'd knock his brains 
out. Ozzie had to win, you know. Ozzie could not come in second. No way." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1932, when bandleader Ozzie Nelson hired Harriet Hilliard to be the 
vocalist in his band, it has been difficult not to imagine one without the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
And for anyone who grew up watching "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" on 
television each week in the 1950s and '60s, it is difficult to picture the 
Nelsons without also thinking of their white, two-story Cape Cod house (footage 
of the family's actual home in Hollywood was used in the opening credits of the 
early episodes). 
</P>
<P>
This is Ozzie and Harriet's other house. 
</P>
<P>
They built the one-story, two-bedroom beach house in Lagunita -- a gated 
community on Coast Highway where homes now sell for up to $4 million -- in 1955 
as a weekend retreat. 
</P>
<P>
And while it is a lot less familiar than their Hollywood house, it figures no 
less prominently in the Nelsons' family history. 
</P>
<P>
It's where the entire family came on weekends to unwind after filming all week 
and during summers when the show was on hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
It's where Ozzie and Harriet retreated the day they finished filming their 
final "adventure" in 1966, ending the show's phenomenal 14 years on television 
and 10 years on radio. 
</P>
<P>
And it's where, two years after Ozzie died of cancer in 1975, Harriet moved 
after selling the big house in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Lagunita house has been Harriet Nelson's full-time residence. 
And with frequent weekend visits by son David and his wife, Yvonne, and 
Harriet's grandchildren and their friends, the house is still very much a 
family home that reflects the casual beach life style that originally drew the 
Nelsons to Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
From the road above, the gray house with the French blue trim is hidden from 
view by the garage and a one-room guest house. 
</P>
<P>
A visitor enters through a plain wooden door that opens onto brick steps that 
separate the garage and guest house. The steps lead down to a large, 
plant-filled brick patio. (The plants, like the surrounding landscaping, are 
tended by gardeners from Roger's Gardens in Corona del Mar.) 
</P>
<P>
The L-shaped house has an airy, wood-paneled living room with a beam ceiling 
and a stone fireplace between a large picture window and a sliding glass door 
that offer spectacular views of the ocean and the beach 20 feet below. Harriet 
had the beam ceiling and mahogany paneling painted a warm white color a few 
years ago. ("I'm glad I did it," she says in that familiar, good-humored voice. 
"It makes such a cheerful house.") 
</P>
<P>
The stylish yet unpretentious living room features off-white carpeting and a 
long white couch facing the fireplace. Above the fireplace is an original oil 
painting by the renowned primitive artist Streeter Blair, a family friend, who 
also did the painting of Ozzie's and Harriet's first house in New Jersey that 
hangs above an antique Shaker herb chest. (Harriet has been collecting antiques 
since 1934, "when it didn't cost your right arm," but had to sell much of her 
collection when she left her Hollywood home for the much smaller Lagunita 
house.) 
</P>
<P>
One wall of the living room is devoted to a built-in television and a built-in 
mirrored wet bar where Ozzie would often stand while working on scripts for the 
TV show. 
</P>
<P>
On the shelf above the TV is a collection of personal family photographs, 
including pictures of Rick, who died in a 1985 plane crash, and David, who is a 
Hollywood film director. On the wall above is another primitive painting, a 
seaside town painted by Harriet's former daughter-in law, Kris Nelson, who 
divorced Rick in 1981. The whimsical painting incorporates family members: 
Harriet is shown gardening; Ozzie is holding a volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
A framed black-and-white photograph of Ozzie and Harriet, taken shortly before 
they were married in 1935, sits atop an antique oak cricket table next to a 
wingback chair. The inscription down the side of the clear frame reads: 
"Ozzie's Girl." The frame was a gift from friends during the making of Ozzie 
and Harriet's short-lived television comeback in "Ozzie's Girls" in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Harriet converted the small second bedroom into a study, which has an antique 
mahogany desk where she does her "desk work." Built-in shelves, filled with 
books and family photographs, frame a love seat where Harriet often sits while 
reading her mail -- including occasional fan letters from a new generation of 
viewers who watch "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" on the Disney Channel. 
</P>
<P>
As viewers of the old show know, the TV Harriet Nelson spent a lot of time in 
the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is that although her Hollywood house had a spacious kitchen, complete 
with a butler's pantry, Harriet was too busy during the show years to cook for 
the family. She employed a full-time cook-housekeeper. The kitchen in the 
Lagunita house is small, with a breakfast bar, and is distinguished by a 
vintage stainless-steel refrigerator and built-in stove and oven (gifts from 
Hotpoint, "Ozzie and Harriet's" sponsor at the time the house was built). 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, Harriet Nelson does know how to cook: "I'll get on kicks where I see 
a recipe and then I'll do it, but it isn't necessary. Everybody knows what 
cooking for yourself is like." When she entertains, it's usually with a few 
close friends and, she says, she keeps it "very simple. Nothing elaborate. It's 
very homey." 
</P>
<P>
In Lagunita, the Nelsons always had an "open-refrigerator policy" for guests. 
"This was called Hospitality Hall: everybody helped themselves. Thank God they 
did," says Harriet. 
</P>
<P>
During the '50s, David and Rick's friends would often show up on weekends, 
camping out on the living room floor. "I'd have to step over them to get to the 
kitchen in the morning," she says with a laugh, adding, "Now I've got the 
grandchildren's friends. Fortunately." 
</P>
<P>
The guest house, in fact, was built to give David and Rick -- and their friends 
-- more room. But turning the original two-car garage into a guest house and 
building another garage next to it actually served a more practical purpose: It 
gave the Nelsons much-needed privacy. 
</P>
<P>
While eating dinner one evening shortly after the house was built, Harriet 
recalls, they looked up to find a man and a woman and their two children 
staring at them through the front picture window. "I said, 'Can I help you?' 
And they said, 'We just heard the Nelsons lived here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Wearing an ivory silk blouse and navy blue pants, with her reading glasses 
hanging from a gold chain around her neck, Harriet sat at her French country 
dining table and discussed what Laguna and her Lagunita home have meant to her. 
</P>
<P>
It was Ozzie's love of the ocean, she said, that originally brought them to 
Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't care for it at first, but he loved it so," she said. "I learned to 
put up with it and then, gradually, I learned to love it, too. Now I find I 
don't want to live any place else." 
</P>
<P>
The Lagunita house is the second weekend home Ozzie and Harriet bought in 
Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
In the late '40s, during the peak of their radio show's popularity, they bought 
a big old Mediterranean-style house down the coast at Camel Point. But the 
house was too large and too difficult to take care of. They sold it in 1954 and 
as part payment received an empty lot in Lagunita. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar architect William Blurock, in association with architect Richard 
Pleger, designed the Lagunita house in accordance with Harriet's 
specifications. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew what I wanted," she said. "I'd sit on the beach and make notes of what 
I'd do if I built a house down here. Just from experience: 'Well, I don't like 
this, I wouldn't want this' -- that kind of notes." 
</P>
<P>
(Today Blurock recalls installing "black-out" drapes -- "double drapes like 
they have in hotels" -- in Ozzie and Harriet's bedroom: "Ozzie wanted his 
bedroom, which was all glass, absolutely blacked out so he could sleep," he 
said.) 
</P>
<P>
As with all the windows in the house, Harriet's bedroom now features wide-slat, 
natural wood shutters which, she says, "makes more sense than anything else if 
you live at the beach" because they are adjustable and let in as little or as 
much light as desired. 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis in designing their new weekend retreat, Harriet said, was that it 
require minimum upkeep. "I had that in mind all the way through, and I'm 
certainly grateful for it now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Home has always been important to Harriet. 
</P>
<P>
During the '30s when she and Ozzie were on the road with Ozzie's band, she used 
to clip pictures of homes and furniture out of magazines and paste them into a 
scrapbook. With a laugh, she recalled: "The boys in the band used to call it 
'Harriet's house.' I'm a nester." 
</P>
<P>
In the late '60s, Lagunita became something of a Nelson family compound. At one 
point, Rick and Kris Nelson had a condominium down the beach at Blue Lagoon, 
and Rick's in-laws, Tom and Elyse Harmon, lived a few doors down from Ozzie and 
Harriet. Ozzie's brother Don, who wrote for the show, still has a house in 
Lagunita. So does actor Kent McCord, who got his acting start playing one of 
Rick's fraternity brothers on the show, and producer Joe Byrne, a high school 
friend of David who began his career working as a gofer on the series. 
</P>
<P>
Harriet, who does her own shopping at the supermarket across the highway and at 
other Laguna stores, enjoys the "village atmosphere of Laguna." 
</P>
<P>
"I like almost everything about it," she said. "I know everyone down here, and 
they are all such nice people." 
</P>
<P>
Harriet said she spends a lot of time on her deck, especially in the evening 
"because it's so lovely. The ocean's noisy, but it's a quiet noise." She also 
enjoys sitting on the beach but says, "if you've got stuff to do upstairs you'd 
better not go down to the beach because you won't come back up. I don't. It's a 
different world down there and you kind of leave everything else upstairs. I 
could be a beachcomber very easily." 
</P>
<P>
Harriet is a member of the women's advisory council of South Coast Medical 
Center and is a patron of Las Marineras, an auxiliary to Family Service of 
America, a family counseling service. Although virtually retired from acting, 
Harriet earlier this year did a guest shot as a nun on granddaughter Tracy 
Nelson's television series, "Father Dowling Mysteries." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, thinking she'd like to be closer to family and friends in Los 
Angeles, Harriet bought a second home in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
Her intention was to divide her time between Studio City and Laguna. But 
despite spending several months having the Studio City house remodeled, Harriet 
recently put it up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very nice house," she said. "It's just that I find I can't live with 
one foot in one and one foot in the other." 
</P>
<P>
Although she has lived in the Lagunita house for 12 years, it has only recently 
come to feel like home to her, Harriet said, explaining that it was a wrenching 
experience for her to give up the Hollywood house where she and Ozzie lived for 
35 years. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I didn't realize (the Lagunita house) was really home until I bought 
that house up in Los Angeles. Then I realized it didn't feel like home, and 
that this is it. So that's the good that came out of it for me." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to describe what the Lagunita house has meant to the Nelson family over 
the years, Harriet recalled something her 14-year-old grandson, Sam Nelson, 
said while spending the weekend with her recently. 
</P>
<P>
"We were sitting in the living room and he said, 'Grandma, this is the nicest 
house in the world,' " she said. "Later on I told that to Tracy, who was down 
here with him, and she said, 'You know what he meant, Grandma? You're a 
constant to us.' She said, 'No matter what comes and goes, you're always here.' 
"

Photographer Jim Gallagher does not have to leave his Huntington Beach back 
yard to snap pictures of his favorite subjects. 
</P>
<P>
From their living room, he and his wife, Sylvia, can see a rich variety of 
avian life attracted to the birdbath, feeders and fruit trees in their small 
suburban garden. Common local birds are joined by migrating species that find 
the tiny back-yard oasis too enticing to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Gallagher has photographed 43 bird species in his garden; another 15 to 
20 species got away before he could get his camera. Many of his back-yard 
slides end up in the huge library of the local Sea and Sage Audubon Society 
(5,000-plus images and counting, more than half taken by Gallagher). 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Gallagher, meanwhile, leads the group's workshops on birding skills, 
often illustrating the lessons with slides taken in her back yard. 
</P>
<P>
This had been a particularly good spring for the Gallaghers: "Jim's taken 
wonderful pictures of lots of new birds," his wife said. "It's been just 
great." 
</P>
<P>
Attracting wildlife can bring a new dimension to the enjoyment of suburban 
yards, with birds and butterflies the most popular focus of gardeners' 
attentions. Approaches vary from simple touches, such as a solitary hummingbird 
feeder, to an integrated landscaping approach that attempts to duplicate a 
small slice of nature. 
</P>
<P>
Books on gardening for wildlife have become a common item on bookstore shelves 
in recent years. The National Wildlife Federation has been promoting the 
concept since 1976 and has certified more than 8,000 "back-yard habitats" 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
But several experts say the wildlife gardening concept has been more popular in 
the East than locally. 
</P>
<P>
"Southern California, unfortunately, seems to be moving at a slower pace," said 
Mike Evans, owner of Tree of Life Nursery in San Juan Capistrano. "Interesting 
forms of gardening don't seem to appeal to people that much. I don't know what 
it is." 
</P>
<P>
Tree of Life, a wholesale-only nursery on 15 acres of Rancho Mission Viejo near 
Caspers Wilderness Park, is the state's largest nursery dealing entirely in 
native plants. The 10-year-old nursery grows more than 300 local plant species, 
many of which had never before been commercially propagated. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, active in the California Native Plant Society, has taught classes 
through UC Irvine Extension on gardening for wildlife. Planting with 
drought-tolerant native species -- rather than thirsty suburban lawns -- has 
been touted in recent years as a way to save precious water, but the practice 
can also help give a home to critters that are being displaced at an increasing 
rate by development. 
</P>
<P>
Gardening for wildlife could help make up for some of the lost habitat if it 
caught on among homeowners and especially developers, who often plant common 
slope areas in a single exotic plant. "Plants on those slopes are useless to 
wildlife," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the traditional home landscape of a neatly manicured suburban lawn 
bordered with exotic plant species may look lush and green, but to wildlife it 
can be a virtual desert. 
</P>
<P>
While there are many approaches to making yards more hospitable to wildlife, 
Evans espouses a comprehensive ideal that stresses "local wildlife in its own 
season." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of wildlife gardening, he said, "is a whole concept of duplicating 
nature." 
</P>
<P>
Evans' approach is based on four basic principles: 
</P>
<P>
Use native species. Local wildlife evolved with local vegetation and often can 
make no use of the exotic plants so popular among gardeners. 
</P>
<P>
Use a variety of plants that provide animals with three basic requirements: 
food, cover and nesting materials. 
</P>
<P>
Use a layered scheme that duplicates the native coastal sage scrub plant 
community that predominates in the local hills. The layers graduate from 
grasses to soft-branched shrubs (two to three feet high), to taller shrubs such 
as toyon and lemonade berry (six to eight feet high), to native trees, 
especially oak and sycamore. There should be an edge separating the various 
layers, Evans said, rather than a mixture of plant sizes. 
</P>
<P>
Do not disturb. As they grow and mature, native plants require little pruning 
or other maintenance. Raking should also be kept to a minimum because fallen 
leaves provide a rich environment for insects that attract birds and lizards. 
Dead wood in trees, if left intact, can provide a home for cavity-nesting 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
"What you're ending up with is a very natural-looking garden," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to popular misconception, that is not the same thing as a weed lot. 
Native plants, in addition to requiring little water or maintenance, are green 
all year and often very attractive, Evans said. Aesthetically, they are 
especially appropriate in foothills, where development is escalating and where 
exotic plants can look out of place alongside the planned natural areas. 
</P>
<P>
"They look like they belong," Evans said of indigenous plants. "These aren't 
inferior landscape plants. They look quite good on their own." 
</P>
<P>
While most nurseries carry but a few natives, the Fullerton Arboretum sells 
varied native plants and can special-order particular species not on hand. 
(Tree of Life is not open to the public.) 
</P>
<P>
In addition to such common back-yard birds as house finches and house sparrows, 
a native garden can attract such woodland natives as phoebes, towhees, acorn 
woodpeckers and flycatchers. Large trees can provide homeowners with a glimpse 
of red-shouldered hawks, barn owls and great horned owls. Non-pest insects, 
especially butterflies, are another bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Among landlocked animals, "we are blessed with a couple of good lizard 
species," Evans said. Small mammals might include the deer mouse and the meadow 
mouse (not associated with the house mice or roof rats). 
</P>
<P>
There is no guarantee, however, that following Evans' recipe will lead to an 
abundance of wildlife. The degree of success is difficult to foresee and 
depends on such factors as proximity to large, undeveloped open areas. A couple 
of neighborhood cats can raise havoc, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Evans argued, a native plant garden is a pleasure in its own right: "If 
I'm reminded of neat natural areas when I go out and look at my garden, that's 
wildlife too." 
</P>
<P>
For gardeners unable or unwilling to tackle Evans' comprehensive approach, 
there are other, less involved ways to make gardens attractive to wildlife. 
Most of these focus on a particular kind of creature: The Gallaghers, for 
instance, try to attract birds that pass through the county along the Pacific 
flyway, a major north-south migration route. 
</P>
<P>
A birdbath is the essential element in the Gallaghers' back-yard sanctuary. The 
fairly simple arrangement includes water that drips slowly from a hose and 
splashes into the bath; some birds, such as warblers, prefer moving water to a 
still pool. 
</P>
<P>
The bath is placed near a bush. "Birds like to be able to escape into a bush or 
a very low tree," Gallagher said. "It's important to have shrubs." 
</P>
<P>
A bucket collects the run-over and is used to water the garden when full. 
</P>
<P>
Seed is placed in a high feeder and spread on the patio (some birds prefer to 
feed on the ground). Of course, not all birds are seed-eaters. The Gallaghers 
have a fruit tree that not only provides a meal to fruit-eating birds but also 
attracts bugs that bring in the insect-eating birds. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Gallagher also recommends some kind of berry plant, with the native 
toyon a good candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement not only attracts migrating birds, but is also popular among 
such common year-round birds as house sparrows and house finches. In addition, 
seeing these birds feeding below helps to clue transient species that a meal 
and bath are available below. 
</P>
<P>
Butterflies are another popular creature that can thrive in the suburban 
environment. While adult butterflies can often feed on a variety of 
nectar-producing flowers, the caterpillars are usually much more picky, perhaps 
feeding on just one species of plant. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure a local butterfly population, food for both the adult and larvae 
should be available (for a listing of common local butterflies and their food 
plants, see Clipboard on Page 2). 
</P>
<P>
Some local butterflies depend on exotic plants; the gulf fritillary, for 
instance, is particular to passion vine because the butterfly itself is not 
native and became established locally when the passion vine became a popular 
plant. However, many popular ornamentals planted in the county are of no value 
to butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
Attracting butterflies is more than a way to bring life and color to a garden; 
entomologist Larry Orsak said new habitat may be crucial to the survival of 
local butterfly populations. 
</P>
<P>
"Urbanization has greatly reduced the county's lowland butterfly fauna," Orsak 
wrote in a guide to county butterfly gardening while he was a student at UC 
Irvine. "Butterfly gardening can partly remedy this situation."

ABUNDANCE OF HERBS DISPLAYS DIVERSITY OF CUISINES, CULTURES

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's growing ethnic diversity is obvious in many ways, and it 
extends to what people are growing in their back-yard herb gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Many Vietnamese have patches of onion and mint as well as other herbs. Some 
grow lemon grass, the long, flat-leaved scallion-appearing grass that imparts a 
lemon flavor to fish and soups. Others have dill, which is used in a variety of 
foods, especially catfish. 
</P>
<P>
For Italian cooks, this is herb paradise. Mediterranean herbs like thyme, 
rosemary and lavender grow here as if Orange County were somewhere just south 
of Naples. So does basil, which may have originated in India but has become a 
Mediterranean staple. 
</P>
<P>
It is no trick here to grow several varieties of basil and oregano, onion, 
garlic, shallots and chives. Lemon basil is especially good with chicken and 
fish, Spicy Globe and Dark Opal basil make attractive container plants, and 
Italian sweet basil is the most prized for cooking and is the base for pesto 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Coriander, favored in Mexican cooking for its leaves (cilantro) and in Indian 
curries for its seeds, also grows effortlessly here and can take over your 
garden if not pruned. The same goes for mint, which has a wandering root 
system. 
</P>
<P>
To get an idea of what grows here and how big it gets, a stroll through the 
herb garden at Fullerton Arboretum at Cal State Fullerton is instructive. 
</P>
<P>
Situated behind the historic house built by Dr. George C. Clark, Fullerton's 
first physician, the herb garden consists of four plots with edible or 
medicinal herbs and ornamental flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Here you can find well-marked samples of Genoa, Napoletano and Greek miniature 
basils as well as fennel, borage, lemon verbena, sweet bay leaves, French 
Tarragon, ginger, garlic, chives, sweet marjoram, creeping rosemary, orange 
bergamot, savory, sage, and chamomile, to mention a few. 
</P>
<P>
All can be grown easily in small spaces, except for the bay tree, which can 
achieve considerable height and breadth. 
</P>
<P>
One popular method is to fill a terra cotta container with several different 
varieties, creating an herb bowl that can be moved around the garden or patio, 
or brought into a bright kitchen window or atrium. 
</P>
<P>
Most herbs take very little care, says Joyce Smith, the arboretum's Heritage 
Garden coordinator. In fact, you can plant herbs and just "let them grow, 
unless you know it is going to throw a lot of seeds out," such as the coriander 
or fennel. Many herbs are ornamental as well as edible, and pruning can help 
keep them full by facilitating new growth. Smith says she trims back large, 
bush-like herbs such as rosemary to keep them from getting "woody" with too 
much stem and not enough greenery. 
</P>
<P>
Most herbs need substantial sunlight and good drainage, and can thrive in 
sandy, semi-arid conditions. Smith says she doesn't use insecticides, since 
many of the herbs are fragrant enough to repel pests. 
</P>
<P>
There is no set schedule for watering, and it depends on how dry the weather 
has been. Touching the soil every few days is Smith's recommended method. When 
she does water, she sprays it overhead instead of irrigating because "it keeps 
the plants cleaner and keeps the insects off." 
</P>
<P>
As for fertilizing, she suggests that less is better. Smith uses mulch, but no 
fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
"You can over-fertilize, and if you do, they kind of lose their flavor," she 
explains. 
</P>
<P>
Once every few weeks is probably sufficient for most herbs, and many can grow 
without any help at all, thanks to their wild heritage. 
</P>
<P>
"They were weeds to begin with in the forests and fields and were brought into 
the garden," Smith says, noting that "any wild thing" can pretty much take care 
of itself. 
</P>
<P>
Herbs grow in Orange County year-round, and some bloom periodically with small 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
The cinnamon basil flowers have deep purple petals, while the lemon basil 
sports tiny white blossoms. Fennel is an annual or biannual with yellow 
flowers, and borage has blue-violet flowers and leaves with a cucumber-like 
taste that can be used in salads or candied and put on cakes as edible 
ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
Lemon verbena, a deciduous plant that is dormant in the winter, can grow as a 
shrub or tree and has long slender leaves and tiny white flowers. The leaves 
have (what else?) a lemony taste. Smith says you can get more leaves of verbena 
as well as basil and marjoram by cutting off the blossoms, pretty as they are. 
It all depends on whether you prize the plant more for cooking or decoration. 
</P>
<P>
When cooking with fresh herbs, a good rule is to add twice as much as a recipe 
calls for of the dried version. An exception is rosemary, for which one-third 
as much fresh as is called for dry will do nicely, since it is "pretty strong," 
Smith says. 
</P>
<P>
The alliums -- onions, garlic and shallots -- can be pulled from the ground 
when the bulb begins to protrude, but Smith warns gardeners to wait until the 
tops are dried before cutting them off. If you cut the stalks before they are 
completely dry, mold will ruin the bulbs. Once dry, however, they will keep for 
weeks in a cool, dry, well ventilated place 
</P>
<P>
Next to the arboretum's herb garden is a small plot with several varieties of 
chili peppers. A pepper garden is a natural complement to an herb garden, 
especially for Oriental and Latin cuisines. The peppers take up little space 
and can be dried and crushed for use in sauces, soups or to sprinkle on a piece 
of meat in Cajun fashion. 
</P>
<P>
The garden has cayenne, serrano and poblano/ancho peppers. The latter is mild 
and can be used for chili relleno, the Mexican recipe for chili peppers stuffed 
with jack cheese. 
</P>
<P>
The others should be used with care, however. "The smaller the pepper, the 
hotter it is," Smith says, pointing out a tiny chili fit for asbestos palates.

THE HANDYMAN;

<P>
WHEN IT COMES TO HANGING WALLPAPER, ALWAYS REMEMBER STEP 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When John T. Hall goes to work each morning, he eagerly confronts something 
most of us would just as soon pass by -- walls in need of wallpaper, and 
sometimes wallpaper that needs to be stripped. 
</P>
<P>
Hall is a professional paperhanger, an artist whose canvas is a bare wall on 
which he carefully creates the special looks his customers crave. 
</P>
<P>
From Hall's perspective, of course, most people would be better off turning to 
a professional if papering is part of their decorating plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Niguel resident has been hanging paper since 1973 and has learned a 
few tricks in the ensuing 16 years. He agreed to share some of his knowledge to 
make the task easier for those who would like to tackle it on their own. 
</P>
<P>
And hanging wallpaper is something that the average handyman can do. All it 
takes is the right tools, a positive attitude, patience, a little time and a 
willingness to get a bit messy. 
</P>
<P>
If you've been a homeowner for more than a month or two, chances are you have a 
neighbor or friend who has botched a wallpapering job; you may even have blown 
one yourself. 
</P>
<P>
That's because after spending lots of money and time finding just the right 
wallpaper, Hall says, many do-it-yourselfers doom themselves to failure at the 
first step (often by skipping the first step entirely). 
</P>
<P>
So here is the one thing to remember, if you remember nothing else about 
wallpapering after reading this column: 
</P>
<P>
Always, always, always prepare the wall you are going to paper, and prepare it 
properly. No matter how expensive your paper, how carefully you match patterns 
and fit the paper around corners and into window sills, no matter how carefully 
you measure -- if the wall isn't prepared properly, the paper ultimately will 
pop off, leaving you with ugly bubbles and peeling edges. 
</P>
<P>
If you are starting with a smooth, painted plaster or gypsum-board wall, the 
basic preparation is fairly simple. Wash the walls to be papered and fill any 
holes, dents or gouges with spackling compound or other interior filler. Then 
remove the light switch and wall plug plates and any other hardware or 
ornamentation. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, prime the walls, using a primer made specifically to be applied under 
wallpaper. An oil-base primer is the absolute best -- and most expensive -- way 
to go, but Hall said there are several good latex primers now on the market. 
The primer takes the place of wallpaper sizing, gives you a surface with plenty 
of "slip" for sliding the paper around once you've got it on the wall, seals 
the wall and gives the paste a proper surface to adhere to. 
</P>
<P>
If you are dealing with a textured wall, you have three options: Sand it 
smooth; fill it out with spackling, wallboard compound or plaster until the 
texture disappears; or, if it is only a very light texture, hang a lining paper 
before putting up the wallpaper (for all but the most dedicated homeowner, 
papering textured walls often calls for professional help). 
</P>
<P>
The other common mistakes made by novice paperhangers, and Hall's tips for 
avoiding them, are: 
</P>
<P>
Trying to hang Mylar, foil or hand-printed papers themselves. These all require 
special skills and tools, and are best left to a professional. 
</P>
<P>
Not using the right type of paste for the paper being hung. A heavy-bodied 
paste with a light paper is just as bad as a light paste with a heavy paper. 
Hill and most other professionals also recommend pasting all wallpapers, even 
those that come prepasted. Soaking prepasted papers is messy and the paper 
usually comes out either too wet, so that some of the glue is dissolved, or not 
wet enough, so that it won't adhere to the wall. 
</P>
<P>
When pasting paper, using too light a paste can cause the paper to peel away 
from the wall after a while, but using too heavy a paste can cause more 
immediate grief. The tackier, heavy-bodied pastes set up fast and won't give 
you much time to slide the paper around on the wall as you try to line each 
strip up with its neighbor. Heavy pastes on light papers also can grab too 
hard, both on the wall and when "booking" the paper prior to hanging it. In 
either case, the backing can pull away from the printed surface, leaving you 
with an unhangable paper. 
</P>
<P>
Not buying enough paper. This comes either from a misplaced sense of thrift or 
from mismeasuring. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you are using a paper with no pattern or with a completely random 
design, you will have a lot of waste on each roll. And you will find that doors 
and windows don't save that much paper. Inevitably you won't be able to simply 
cut strips 30 inches long for the wall under the window and 18 inches long for 
the wall at the top. 
</P>
<P>
You will have to cut full 8-foot strips, at least for the ends of the windows, 
and trim big-but-not-quite-full-width pieces out of the center. If you don't 
buy enough paper the first time, you will wind up either piecing things 
together from scraps or face being left with a strip that doesn't quite match 
because you had to pick up a roll from a different printing run. 
</P>
<P>
To measure, Hill offers the following rules of thumb to determine how many 
rolls you will need: 
</P>
<P>
European, or metric, rolls contain 28 square feet of paper per single roll. 
When the pattern repeats vertically every 18 inches or less, divide the total 
square footage of the area to be papered by 22. If the pattern repeats at 
intervals greater than 18 inches, for every additional 6 inches, subtract 1 
from the divisor. For example, divide by 21 for pattern repeat intervals of 19 
to 24 inches, by 20 for pattern repeats of 25 to 30 inches, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
American rolls contain 36 square feet per single roll. When the pattern repeats 
every 18 inches or less, divide the total square footage by 30. For pattern 
repeats longer than 18 inches, subtract 1 from the divisor for each additional 
6 inches; i.e., divide by 29 for pattern repeats of 19 to 24 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Failing to use a plumb line to mark a perfectly vertical line on the wall at 
each corner and for the first strip you hang. Once you get a strip of paper on 
the wall even slightly crooked, the tilt magnifies with each subsequent strip. 
The plumb line is a weighted, chalk-impregnated string that is snapped sharply 
against the wall to mark a straight vertical line. The line should be made to 
mark where the edge of the paper will be placed. 
</P>
<P>
Not starting in the right place. Most wallpaper instructions tell you to begin 
in a corner. But Hall suggests starting your layout at a window. In either 
case, when you get to a corner, don't just wrap the paper around and keep 
going. Each strip going into a corner should be cut so that about one-half inch 
wraps around. Then a new chalk line is snapped on the unpapered wall, and a new 
strip of paper is cut to butt into the corner, overlapping the excess half-inch 
from the first piece and matching the pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Not using the proper tools. That hunting knife in the junk drawer in the 
kitchen might be sharp, but it isn't what you need to cut wallpaper. Use sharp 
razor-type knives; a good steel straightedge; a high-quality sponge to wipe 
down and clean the glue from the face of each strip after it is hung, and a 
plastic squeegee or bristle brush for smoothing the paper once you've 
positioned it on the wall. Use brushes for lightweight papers, squeegees for 
heavier papers. 
</P>
<P>
Going too fast. Take your time. The walls won't go anywhere, and if you can't 
finish the job in one day, there is always another. It is better to take two or 
three days to do a good job than to take one day to put it up, two days to peel 
it off and two months to earn enough money to buy more paper.

Chef Buddy Hungerford recalls the time that a friend tried to barbecue a whole 
pork butt and wound up with a bonfire instead. 
</P>
<P>
It was "one of those (get-togethers) where you're cooking outside and drinking 
inside and you go back out and your barbecue's afire," Hungerford says with a 
laugh. Pork butt is a fatty cut of meat and "the fat just dripped right down in 
the charcoals and (ignited). We had to get the fire extinguisher." 
</P>
<P>
Not all barbecue mistakes are this spectacular, but many back-yard chefs find 
barbecuing a hit-and-miss proposition (anyone who has suffered through raw 
hamburgers or steaks charred beyond recognition can testify that it is not an 
easily mastered art). 
</P>
<P>
That is why the experts say that those who are really serious about barbecuing 
need to remember the three "Ps" -- patience, practice and preparation. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say we have a standard barbecue at home, that we're going to do chicken 
breasts," says Hungerford, a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America and 
executive chef at Caliente in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
A common error is to jump the gun, he says, to start before the fire has cooled 
properly or to bathe the raw meat in sauce. Hungerford says the fire -- whether 
gas or charcoal -- should be a medium heat, not too hot to hold your hand over 
for 5 to 10 seconds. And to avoid burning, the chicken breasts should be cooked 
at least a minute on each side before any sauce is applied. 
</P>
<P>
He says a general rule of thumb is to apply barbecue sauce only once during 
cooking, either halfway through the process or at the end, and to apply it 
sparingly. Extra sauce can always be served on the side. 
</P>
<P>
(Many cooks sidestep all the problems by baking the chicken beforehand, 
marinating it in barbecue sauce and using the barbecue grill to singe and heat 
before serving.) 
</P>
<P>
Jim Traywick, general manager of R.J.'s The Rib Joint in Newport Beach and a 
connoisseur of the Southern-style barbecue of his youth, stresses the 
importance of patience. 
</P>
<P>
"Cook it slow and low," Traywick says. "We cook our ribs here at 250 degrees 
for 3 1/2 hours. To get the true Southern barbecue, you need that longer period 
of time to get the meat to be tender and to have the smoky flavor that you 
want." 
</P>
<P>
He points out that meat dries when cooked at high temperatures while slow 
cooking produces a self-basting process that keeps it moist. 
</P>
<P>
Learning how to regulate a fire is a key to successful barbecues, the experts 
agree. Traywick suggests purchasing an inexpensive oven thermometer (available 
in most grocery stores) and using it to monitor charcoal temperature, adding 
coals as needed. 
</P>
<P>
He also recommends a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of 
poultry, inserting it into the thickest part of the chicken or turkey and being 
careful not to touch bone. "Once it reaches 160 degrees, it's done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Rassinoux, who began cooking in his native Paris, France, and is now 
executive chef at the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point, prefers to test the doneness 
of meat by practiced touch. 
</P>
<P>
"If the meat is very soft," he says, "the meat will be rare. If it's harder, it 
will be medium, and if it has a hard touch, it's well done. 
</P>
<P>
"On chicken, I would suggest that if you are not sure of the result, make an 
incision in it. If you see some blood coming out, that means the chicken is not 
done." 
</P>
<P>
Rassinoux notes that many people have difficulty barbecuing fish, which he says 
requires "a very, very clean barbecue," a hot fire and brushing the fish 
lightly with oil to prevent sticking. 
</P>
<P>
"It's also better for fish to have the skin on," he says, "unless you have a 
thick steak of bass or halibut or tuna." 
</P>
<P>
(Another method of preventing the fish from sticking to the grill is to place 
the fish on aluminum foil on the grill for a few minutes and then slip the foil 
out.) 
</P>
<P>
Rassinoux points out that the time it takes for the coals to cool down also 
allows the starter fluid to fully dissipate. He suggests you wait at least 30 
minutes before you put the food on the grill. 
</P>
<P>
And if it's a distinctive flavor you want, he recommends sprinkling a few fresh 
herbs, such as rosemary, on the coals, or using mesquite or hickory chunks or 
chips in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
The chips, which can be used with charcoal or gas barbecues, should be soaked 
in water for an hour, put in a shallow dish or pan and placed on the cooler 
side of the fire and not directly under the meat, Traywick says. They will 
slowly smolder and give meat a smoked flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Marinades also can provide zesty flavor, in addition to acting as tenderizers 
when the meat is left in them for 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Rassinoux recommends a simple marinade of olive oil, fresh herbs, onion and a 
touch of sherry, or perhaps olive oil with roast garlic, lemon, thyme or 
rosemary. 
</P>
<P>
For many people, barbecue just isn't barbecue without sauce, and practice and 
preference are what's important here. 
</P>
<P>
"In California," Traywick says, "people tend to lean a little more toward the 
sweeter barbecue." He suggests taking a "store-bought" sauce and experimenting 
by adding honey, orange juice, onions, pickle relish or even chocolate -- 
whatever appeals to your taste buds. 
</P>
<P>
He also suggests reading "The All-American Barbecue Book" ($8.95, Vintage 
Press) by Rich Davis and Shifra Stein. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the barbecue books he owns, this is Traywick's favorite because it gives 
a comparison survey of how barbecue differs from region to region across the 
country and includes different sauces. "And it's got recipes from some of the 
most famous barbecue houses in the United States," he says.
