THE SCARCITY OF VACCINE, OUTREACH HAS MEASLES RUNNING WILD; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: THE VACCINATION SYSTEM IS BREAKING DOWN. SO FAR, 34 CHILDREN HAVE DIED 
IN CALIFORNIA.

"Mom, I'm hungry," Hector Lopez used to say when his mother came home from 
cosmetology school. "Nobody feeds me around here." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody feeds you?" she'd exclaim in mock exasperation, pointing out the big 
snacks his older sister had given him. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I forgot," Hector would laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Lopez smiles secretly about her chubby 10-year-old boy, then a shadow 
falls across her eyes. Hector died of measles in February. 
</P>
<P>
He was a victim of the worst measles epidemic in California in over a decade. 
Thirty-four deaths -- most of them among children under 4 -- and more than 
4,000 cases have been reported so far in 1990, a 10-fold increase over 1989. 
Many more children will die unless a comprehensive vaccination and 
revaccination program is instituted. 
</P>
<P>
Measles was once virtually wiped out in California. When a case first appeared 
at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center a few years ago, medical residents 
couldn't identify it. Now, the hospital admits five cases a day. Minorities are 
particularly hard-hit. There have been three deaths on the Morongo Indian 
Reservation in San Bernardino County. In one Fresno hospital, eight Hmong 
people have died of measles. 
</P>
<P>
The rise of the epidemic reflects plunging vaccination levels nationwide. 
One-third of American babies don't have all needed vaccinations by the 
government's recommended 18-month deadline. Half of the children in inner 
cities don't have complete childhood vaccinations until they enter school. This 
threatens babies and unvaccinated adults who have not previously had measles. 
School-age children generally have the best measles survival rate, but even 
otherwise healthy kids can die or suffer permanent brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
Measles is just the tip of the iceberg of the unmet health needs of children, 
who are both the poorest age group in the United States and the most poorly 
served by the medical community. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, a new vaccine rapidly became available to all children," says Dr. 
Edgar Marcuse of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Half received it through 
private doctors and the other half through public clinics. But now the 
vaccination system is breaking down; under-funded and understaffed clinics were 
not prepared for the resurgence of measles. The vaccine is scarce and 
expensive, as is the outreach needed in an era when more and more people can't 
afford routine health care. 
</P>
<P>
Hector had a healthy appetite for life. He loved Garfield and pizza and riding 
his bike and playing Nintendo with his big brother, Richard. He didn't like 
"spinnich, slopy joys, suishi and green beans," according to the brief 
autobiography he wrote in school. "My favorite birthday was when we went to the 
circus. I ate cotten candy and I seen the trapeez." 
</P>
<P>
Every day he rode the bus 20 miles from his insular gang-dominated neighborhood 
in East San Diego to Sunset View Magnet School, with its breathtaking view of 
the Pacific. His mother didn't send her children there because of the beauty, 
but because she valued an education and didn't want them "in a bad crowd with 
gangs." 
</P>
<P>
When Hector started school, he'd had all his shots, his mother says. But, like 
so many parents, she didn't know that one measles vaccination is not sufficient 
protection. Last July the American Academy of Pediatrics began recommending two 
doses of the vaccine for all children and, where there are school outbreaks, 
revaccination for all students and their siblings. The U.S. Public Health 
Service also recommends two doses -- one by 18 months, and a second upon 
entering school. Congress has not appropriated sufficient funds to provide a 
first dose to all children who must rely on public clinics, much less for 
revaccination. Yet the federal government may have to spend as much as $40 
million to control the outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
America now falls behind some Third World countries in its perilously low 
vaccination levels, and some fear that polio may return. 
</P>
<P>
California could change at least this state's spending priorities. A bill 
authorizing an $11.8-million program of early-childhood health care, including 
immunization and outreach, will be considered next month by the Senate 
Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Hector was a happy child, always full of smiles," his mother remembers. He 
used to tell her, "When I grow up, you know what kinda house I'm gonna buy 
you?" 
</P>
<P>
"What, mi hijo?" 
</P>
<P>
"A fixer-upper. That way I can fix it just the way you want it." 
</P>
<P>
When Hector and his brother Richard were exposed to babies with measles, their 
mother thought nothing of it. After all, her boys had been vaccinated. When 
Richard told her he had a headache, she thought it was just a cold coming on. 
Over the weekend, Hector caught it. She put them to bed. Monday, when she came 
home, "they were just laying there, silent; they had no strength." 
</P>
<P>
She rushed them to a small community hospital, where a doctor diagnosed 
measles. He prescribed plenty of liquids, Tylenol and diarrhea medicine, and 
told the mother not to worry. Then he sent the boys home. 
</P>
<P>
On the second day, Hector whispered, "Just sit by me. Hold my hand, Mom." 
</P>
<P>
His feverish body went from hot to cold. Then he stayed cold. She began 
dressing him to go to the hospital. He got as far as the living room. His teeth 
tightened. His eyes rolled up. He went into convulsions. 
</P>
<P>
"We put him on the floor over there," Donna Lopez recalls, pointing to a patch 
of carpet. "We tried to give him mouth-to-mouth. I kept yelling, 'My son's 
dying.' It seemed like forever before the ambulance came." 
</P>
<P>
Hector and Richard were brought back to the same hospital. For two hours she 
waited. "You pray and pray. God has listened for a long time. But he's not 
gonna listen that time. If it hadn't been for Richard being in the other room, 
I couldn't have survived." 
</P>
<P>
The doctor told her that Hector was dead and, in the next breath, said that she 
shouldn't worry about Richard. This time, she didn't follow his advice. She 
demanded that they do something more for Richard than they had for Hector. 
Richard was transferred to Children's Hospital, where they put him in intensive 
care. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's Hector? How's Hector?" he kept asking in his fever. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Donna Lopez's two youngest children also had measles. The day she 
buried Hector, she had three children in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Grieving is hard for a death that could have been prevented. On a warm 
afternoon in May, the little ones scuffle in the living room. Sunlight streams 
on the green carpet where Hector collapsed. A hand-made Mother's Day decoration 
trails faded paper streamers. Roses bloom by the walk and cypress trees rise on 
the hill. 
</P>
<P>
"You and God are the most speishel peeple in my life," Hector wrote in a 
Mother's Day card last year. "I love you and God very much." 
</P>
<P>
Donna Lopez puts down the card and looks at the counter where Hector used to 
watch her cook. He was always asking for a sip of coffee. "I wouldn't let him 
have any," she muses. Her brown eyes fill to the brim. "Now I wish I had given 
him more coffee." Contemplating all the things she would have liked to give 
Hector, her voice deepens. "Isn't it funny? They have enough money for weapons, 
but there's no money to give our kids a second shot. My son was worth more than 
$40!" 
</P>
<P>
She urges parents to get measles shots -- $40 with a private doctor, free at a 
public clinic -- even if it's a financial sacrifice. She cautions them not to 
be easily turned away from care when their children are very sick. 
</P>
<P>
When she took the boys' bunk bed apart after Hector died, she found some words 
he had written on the bottom of his brother's bunk: "Richard and Hector 
together, forever." She shudders to think how close they came to being together 
in death.

STRIVING FOR TOCQUEVILLE'S AMERICA; 
</P>
<P>
DEMOCRACY: CAMPAIGN REFORMS MAY BE NEEDED, BUT RECONNECTING WITH ONE ANOTHER 
AND WITH THE COMMONWEAL IS MORE URGENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Americans have taken justifiable satisfaction from this year's triumphs of 
democracy worldwide. But before hastening to tutor others about 
self-government, we must reckon with Americans' discontent with our own 
democracy -- a "politics of irrelevance, of obscurantism," in the words of 
Walter Mondale; a democracy in which "bull permeates everything," according to 
Lee Atwater. Revitalizing our democracy should be at the top of our national 
agenda, but to make progress, we need to be clearer about what we strive for. 
</P>
<P>
Our contemporary conception of democracy owes more than most observers 
recognize to the Austrian economic historian Joseph Schumpeter, who emigrated 
to this country in the 1930s. Impatient with idealistic theories about popular 
rule, Schumpeter defined democracy as merely " . . . a competitive struggle for 
the people's vote." Think of political parties as firms competing for market 
share, he said, much as Cheerios and corn flakes vie for a place at our 
breakfast tables today. Think of politicians as merchandisers, a modern-day 
Schumpeter might say. Think of voters as manipulable consumers, uninformed 
about public issues, swayable through jingles and cartoons. Think of public 
policy, not as the outcome of a collective deliberation about the public 
interest, but as a byproduct of private interest, the mere residue of campaign 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Schumpeter's interpretation of modern democratic politics turned out to be 
remarkably prescient. He forecast, in effect, the central trend in American 
politics of the last half-century. When we talk now about democracy and its 
discontents, we focus almost entirely on political campaigns and marketing. We 
worry about sound bites and campaign spending. We lament "attack ads" and 
trivializing press coverage and low voter turnout. We propose public financing 
of campaigns and journalistic restraint. And this inside-the-Beltway debate 
about political reform follows Schumpeter's lead by mindlessly assuming that 
the core of democracy is the electoral campaign. 
</P>
<P>
But it need not be so. An even earlier European visitor to our shores, Alexis 
de Tocqueville, offered a quite different view of "democracy in America." 
Tocqueville's vision, admittedly rooted in the less urban, less frenetic 
America of the early 19th Century, highlighted the engagement of ordinary 
citizens in public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
American democracy, according to Tocqueville, presumed a widely shared sense of 
social solidarity and civic obligation. The organizational sinews of our 
democracy were community associations, not electoral marketeers. Our democracy 
relied on our readiness to share responsibility for common problems. Democratic 
deliberation, a modern Tocqueville would say, rests on black churches and 
Rotary Clubs and Mothers Against Drunk Driving and Drop-a-Dime anti-drug 
crusades. 
</P>
<P>
Democracy cannot be subcontracted to campaign strategists and focus groups. 
Responsible consideration of the "big" questions of our time -- the twin 
deficits, the future of East-West relations, and so on -- must grow from 
practical experience in civic discussions of dozens of local issues -- school 
reform, homelessness, environmental abuses -- in thousands of communities 
across the land. It is no accident that recent evidence suggests that the most 
effective means of combatting the plague of drugs is to engage the active 
participation of neighborhood groups. 
</P>
<P>
If the paramount issue in American politics of the 1980s was making markets 
work better, the principal challenge of the 1990s will be to make democracy 
work better. A new era of practical reform is urgently needed. But lasting 
reform must begin at the grass roots, with Tocqueville's robust vision rather 
than Schumpeter's crass and shallow view. Our schools and universities, our 
civic, business and religious leaders, our press -- and yes, even our 
politicians -- must join in an effort to restore vigor to grass-roots 
organizations, to reconnect with one another and with the commonweal. Campaign 
reforms may be needed, but a reinvigorated emphasis on public engagement and 
civic solidarity is even more urgent. 
</P>
<P>
The key to revitalizing American democracy rests not in the hands of the 
campaign strategist, or even the quavering candidate, but in our own. We must 
take responsibility for attacking our problems together, rather than just 
pointing angrily from the sidelines at those who fail to do it for us. 
</P>
<P>
To the extent that the recent revolutions in Eastern Europe are grass-roots 
initiatives by millions of newly unfettered citizens, and that their elections 
are vehicles for debating basic political principles and philosophies, these 
new nations are closer to adopting Tocqueville's vision of democracy than 
Schumpeter's. And to that extent, we have something to learn about democracy 
from them, as well.

PROP. 115: RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND CRIME VICTIMS' REFORM ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is my first letter to the editor and I am writing in hopes that maybe this 
will reach people who are not aware of how important Prop. 115 is to all of us. 
Five years ago before my son was murdered I would not of known or really 
thought about how important this one proposition was. 
</P>
<P>
Many who have not suffered the devastation of losing a loved one should be 
angry enough about the price that lengthy trials cost us the taxpayers let 
alone having a torturous rapist set free to live among us because he has served 
his sentence. Those of us who have had to deal personally with the system have 
had our eyes opened to the reality that it is not only our sorrow that makes us 
suffer. This is our chance to make our system more fair. 
</P>
<P>
Prop. 115 is the most important criminal justice reform measure to be put 
before the voters in 15 years. It will speed up trials by shortening 
preliminary hearings and the jury selection process. It will create a new crime 
of torture. 
</P>
<P>
Prop. 115 changes California law so that those accused of crimes would have the 
rights already guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution, but no more. 
</P>
<P>
If Prop. 115 passes, the scales of justice may even out a little more instead 
of swaying so heavily for the criminals.

RELOCATING UCLA LAB SCHOOL

<TEXT>
<P>
I have read all the recent articles on the proposed move of UCLA's Corrine A. 
Seeds University Elementary School to Santa Monica, including the Chancellor 
Charles Young's reply (letter, May 22). 
</P>
<P>
The chancellor is using fancy words and funny rationale, it seems to me, just 
to try to get his hands on more land to build more buildings on UCLA's campus, 
all at taxpayers' expense. And probably at UES' expense, too. 
</P>
<P>
What I want to know is, are taxpayers going to have foot a multimillion-dollar 
bill to build a new school building for UES in the city of Santa Monica, which 
already has a declining school-age population and empty classrooms?

THE OPPOSITION GROWS TO NEW I-5 CHECKPOINT; 
</P>
<P>
MIGRANTS: SOME NORTH COUNTY OFFICIALS SAY THE PROPOSED $33-MILLION CHECKPOINT 
IN CAMP PENDLETON WOULD ONLY ADD TO THE AREA'S ILLEGAL ALIEN PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first stirring of political opposition to a $33-million, 16-lane border 
checkpoint on Interstate 5 at Camp Pendleton is quietly rippling through North 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Several elected leaders, including County Supervisor John MacDonald, Carlsbad 
Mayor Bud Lewis and Vista Mayor Gloria McClellan, are either flatly against the 
new checkpoint or have doubts about it. 
</P>
<P>
With North County flooded by thousands of illegal migrants, the officials have 
concerns that the checkpoint, which would be built in 1992 if Congress approves 
funding, might make the local migrant situation worse. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis will meet soon with Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) to press his pleas 
that the federal government junk the checkpoint and marshal forces at the 
U.S.-Mexico border to stop undocumented migrants there. 
</P>
<P>
"That thing should be down at the border, that's where the problem is," said 
Lewis, who contends that a North County checkpoint only serves to trap migrants 
who can't pass farther north to Orange County and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Packard, Lewis said, "I do not feel that a new border checkpoint 
would benefit North County. Rather it would intensify the problem by making 
this area the stopping point for those who cannot cross the checkpoint. We do 
not need the additional problems of a larger migrant population." 
</P>
<P>
While Lewis has been complaining to Washington, MacDonald, whose sprawling 5th 
District includes nearly all of North County, has created a special 12-member 
group to advise him on Latino issues. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first things MacDonald asked members to do at their inaugural 
meeting this month is study the checkpoint and return with a recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
"I support investigating the possibility of taking that checkpoint out," said 
MacDonald, who questions the effectiveness of the existing Border Patrol 
checkpoint at San Onofre, just south of the Orange County line. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people go through Camp Pendleton to evade the checkpoint," said the 
county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, one reason for building an expanded checkpoint on Camp Pendleton 
land was to end the controversy over the facility at San Onofre. For years, San 
Clemente and other cities north of the checkpoint have complained about 
dangerous high-speed chases as authorities pursued suspects through their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
When the Bush Administration put $10 million in the proposed federal budget for 
fiscal 1991, the reason was partly to calm Orange County's fears by putting a 
new checkpoint in more open area several miles south. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration also wanted an expanded checkpoint that would stem the 
migrant problem and possibly slow the flow of illicit drugs coming into the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
It's expected that the Administration will seek an additional $23 million 
appropriation for fiscal 1992 to complete the new checkpoint, near the Las 
Pulgas Road exit. At that point, I-5 will be widened into 16 lanes, encroaching 
onto Camp Pendleton for additional space, and a row of inspection booths will 
be installed. 
</P>
<P>
The checkpoint would be manned by 150 Border Patrol agents, double the staffing 
at the San Onofre facility. 
</P>
<P>
There has been little publicity about the new checkpoint, and it is only slowly 
becoming an issue to some North County elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
In Vista, a city less troubled by migrants than Carlsbad or Encinitas, Mayor 
McClellan objects to the checkpoint chiefly because to her it represents 
another effort by Orange County to solve its problems at San Diego County's 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should we be worrying about the problems in Orange County and take the 
pain here?" she asked. "It seems every time Orange County doesn't want 
something, we get it. It gets a little old." 
</P>
<P>
But MacDonald began having doubts about the checkpoint because of the high 
number of migrants being injured or killed as they dart across the freeway 
while trying to work their way around the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that brought this to our attention was the frequent deaths 
and the accidents that occur as (drivers) dodge those incidents," MacDonald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the California Highway Patrol, so far this year five collisions in 
the checkpoint area have claimed the lives of five pedestrians and injured a 
sixth. In 1989, the CHP reported that 16 accidents in the area killed 13 
pedestrians and hurt three others. Most victims are believed to be migrants. 
</P>
<P>
While MacDonald is awaiting a recommendation from his advisory group, there is 
clearly some sentiment among members that the new checkpoint might only 
compound the migrant problem. 
</P>
<P>
George Lopez of Oceanside, a group member and executive director of a North 
County job training organization for low-income people, said when he talks to 
people about the checkpoint, "in general, 95% of the time, I get the comment 
back, 'What good does it do in North County?' " 
</P>
<P>
He believes the checkpoint accomplishes little except to bottle up undocumented 
migrants in North County. "I'd be comfortable sitting up here in North County 
if I didn't have to cross that checkpoint," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis hopes that meeting with Packard and showing the congressman where 
Carlsbad's migrants sleep in canyon camps and wait for work during the day will 
change federal thinking about the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Lewis intends to openly seek support from other elected 
leaders in North County to oppose the checkpoint. He wants "simply to bombard 
our federal representatives how we feel about it," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis may have his work cut out. 
</P>
<P>
Besides having modest influence over the federal budget, Lewis will have a 
difficult time convincing Packard and Border Patrol officials to abandon the 
new checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
Packard said he's willing to discuss the checkpoint with Lewis, but he 
considers the facility a critical second line of defense to keep immigrants 
from passing through San Diego County for other destinations. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important we prevent them from escaping into the rest of the country and 
lose track of them, so I think (the checkpoint) has to be done," Packard said. 
</P>
<P>
He agrees with Lewis that the federal government must do more at the 
international border to stop the flow of migrants, but even so, he insists that 
the North County checkpoint remain. "I don't believe opening up the checkpoint 
is an acceptable solution," Packard said. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does the Border Patrol yield on the issue, and Ted Swofford, a supervisory 
agent, pointed to the number of illegal immigrants caught at the existing 
checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
From Jan. 1 to May 23, agents detained 29,465 undocumented aliens at the San 
Onofre facility. Agents also seized 100 vehicles a month and "an awful lot of 
narcotics," Swofford said. 
</P>
<P>
He disputes Lewis' assertion that the checkpoint forces many migrants to stay 
in North County. "Considering the volume of people we're catching, I get the 
feeling the people in Carlsbad and Encinitas would be there whether there's a 
checkpoint or not," Swofford said. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is clearly the beginning of a political dispute over the 
checkpoint, so far, not everybody is prepared to become partisan. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pam Slater of Encinitas, where the City Council has declared a state of 
emergency because of its migrant problems, said "it would be foolish and 
irresponsible not to improve" the North County checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
But she emphasized that the new checkpoint "could exacerbate our problem" 
unless tough measures also are undertaken at the U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
While Lewis is strident on the issue, some North County politicians hardly 
think about it. A spokesman for Oceanside Mayor Larry Bagley said, "the mayor 
just doesn't have an opinion one way or another on it."

SORRENTO VALLEY CEMETERY A FINAL RESTING PLACE FOR PETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like the quiet eye in the center of a hurricane, a tiny plot of land lies in 
the midst of Sorrento Valley's growing industrial complex. 
</P>
<P>
Overhead, the roar of traffic echoes from Interstates 5 and 805 as drivers 
jockey for position. Across narrow Sorrento Valley Road, Amtrak trains rocket 
by with increasing frequency and freight trains rumble through the night. Each 
weekday morning and night, the macadam road carries a bumper-to-bumper cargo of 
valley workers. 
</P>
<P>
But none of this human uproar bothers the residents of Sorrento Valley Pet 
Cemetery, 1 1/2 acres of serenity. Here Fifi and Fido rest beneath metal 
markers (flush to the ground so they don't interfere with the lawn mower) and 
the cremated remains of beloved kittens and parakeets rest in a 
mini-columbarium. 
</P>
<P>
In all, there have been 157 burials -- some complete with satin-lined coffins 
and services in the tiny chapel -- during the cemetery's 35 years. In addition, 
there have been more than 5,000 cremations in the pet-sized crematorium. 
</P>
<P>
Velma Matthews, who bought the land in 1978, said there is no threat that the 
remains that have been resting here since the first pet burial in January, 
1956, ever will be evicted. But modern buildings are rising nearer to the site 
and the pet cemetery crew must stay ever alert to prevent huge moving vans from 
a company next door from parking on the cemetery grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Little services are about all we can handle," said Matthews. The tiny chapel 
can hold about four or five humans and the pet's last remains. "We sometimes 
just have a normal, simple interment outside. Or sometimes we have the pet on 
view in the chapel, where the family can say their last goodbys." 
</P>
<P>
A statue of St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals, stands near the 
chapel, but Matthews stresses that the chapel is non-sectarian. She recalls one 
service in which a rabbi eulogized the departed pet. 
</P>
<P>
B.J. Shelton of San Diego settled for a simple interment for Shawna, her 
19-year-old Irish setter and "my best friend." 
</P>
<P>
Shawna joins 17 other Shelton pets in the plot, many of them Brittany spaniels, 
which Shelton's late husband favored, but others were just pick-me- ups that 
joined the family and won a lasting place in the Sheltons' hearts. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of love in there," Shelton said, indicating the plot where her 
departed pets are resting. "We talked about it and we agreed that we wanted to 
know just where they were. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that they would be safe here," Shelton said. The Sorrento Valley pet 
cemetery has the same perpetual zoning protection as a human cemetery, she 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
When Shelton visits her pets, she often strolls a few yards beyond to tend the 
grave of Hoover the Sparrow. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover was just an ordinary sparrow that earned a place in the heart of a widow 
by perching on the window sill and watching television with her. When, after 
nine years of companionship, Hoover died, its benefactor gathered it up and 
brought it to the pet cemetery for burial. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen her around for a while," Shelton mused about Hoover's mistress 
as she pushed away the grass encroaching on Hoover's tiny brass marker. "She 
may have gone on. So I sometimes leave flowers here too when I come because I 
think it is a touching story." 
</P>
<P>
Sorrento Valley Pet Cemetery's most recent celebrity burial occurred a few 
months ago when the Oceanside Police Department's K-9 Corps turned out in full 
uniform to bury Irk, a four-year veteran of the force who was credited with 
assists in 28 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Irk, a German shepherd, had chased a suspect into a ravine and into the water, 
where the man was trying to hide. Irk apparently caught pneumonia, went into 
convulsions and died. 
</P>
<P>
At Irk's funeral in February, Officer Chris McDonough, his handler, McDonough's 
wife and three children looked on as Oceanside K-9 officers stood at parade 
rest and their charges sat at attention while Irk's coffin was lowered into the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very touching ceremony," Matthews said. "We had a number of calls 
from people asking if it would be open to the public. I decided not to do so 
because we have such a small parking area and it was crowded with police cars." 
</P>
<P>
Near the entrance to the pet cemetery, a tall double-trunked sycamore tree 
shades the pet memory wall, where plaques commemorate beloved pets whose ashes 
have been scattered there. 
</P>
<P>
According to the pet cemetery's advertising brochure, cremation is available 
for any type of pet, from small ponies (250-pound limit) to tiny baby birds. A 
variety of urns are for sale if grieving owners want to keep their pet at home. 
Cremation costs from $40 up, depending on the size of the pet. 
</P>
<P>
"We only do individual cremations," Matthews said, describing the steps taken 
to ensure that every owner ends up with his or her own pet's remains and a 
simple metal tag identifying the deceased. 
</P>
<P>
The small crematorium with its tall black smokestack is licensed by the San 
Diego Air Pollution Control District. 
</P>
<P>
"They were very good to us," Matthews said of the APCD. "No restrictions on our 
permit. We are a fully licensed pet crematory." 
</P>
<P>
The permit restrictions do cause some distress to bereaved clients, however, 
because crematory rules do not allow the cremation of a pet's favorite blanket 
or toy along with the body. A collar or bow-ribbon might be allowed, Matthews 
said, but nothing that could create ash and pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Paper flowers dot the graves that stretch across the wide cemetery lawn, and on 
Memorial Day weekend, small U.S. flags were set for visitors to decorate the 
tiny grave sites. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral plus burial costs about $500, with a $10 yearly charge for care of 
the plot. If a person fails to pay the yearly fee for five years in a row, the 
pet's remains can be removed and the land reused, Matthews said. It happens, 
she said, when families move away or when youngsters grow up and forget their 
childhood pets. 
</P>
<P>
Cemetery staff will pick up dead pets on a 24-hour basis, with an extra charge 
for after-hours services. 
</P>
<P>
"We collect the animals in style, in a station wagon," Matthews said proudly, 
"not in a pickup truck as some do." 
</P>
<P>
"San Diegans are very lucky. Although there are only about 500 pet cemeteries 
in the world, we have two of them right in this area," Matthews said. She said 
that only about 1% of pet owners seek burial or cremation of their pets after 
death, "but they are a very special group." 
</P>
<P>
The other area pet cemetery, San Diego Pet Memorial Park, is only a few miles 
away, east of Interstate 805 near Miramar Road. It was started in 1962 by 
former employees of the Sorrento Valley Pet Cemetery, Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
B.J. Shelton concedes that "a lot of people might make fun of it, caring so 
much for a pet. But, I don't care." When her husband passed away nine years 
ago, Shawna was there for her. 
</P>
<P>
"She kept me from going crazy," Shelton said. "She was my best friend."

RECOVERY FROM TRYPTOPHAN POISONING IS A PAINFUL FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last summer, Debra Baxter often could be found on the beaches ofSan Diego, 
sunning herself as she watched her son play. 
</P>
<P>
But the summer of 1990 won't find her back at the beach with 5-year-old Ian The 
36-year-old woman is sure that just getting in or out of a sand chair would be 
impossible for her weakened muscles. Besides, when one spends 20 hours a day in 
bed there isn't much time left for a trip to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter is one of 32 San Diego County residents, 275 Californians and 1,517 
Americans who health officials have confirmed were somehow poisoned by 
tryptophan pills. 
</P>
<P>
Like Baxter, the most seriously affected live a day-to-day existence of 
constant pain, overwhelming fatigue, disabling muscle weakness or paralysis, 
and distressing memory loss. 
</P>
<P>
Touted as a "natural" remedy, tryptophan was supposed to make these people 
sleep better. Instead, today they wonder if they'll ever awaken from a medical 
nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing is not knowing if I'll get better," Baxter said. "It's to just 
keep looking at your doctor saying, 'When is this hell going to end? When is 
this pain going to end?' 
</P>
<P>
"I have pain all the time. I take pills and I sleep -- the sleeping is the only 
part that takes the pain away." 
</P>
<P>
Baxter's nightmare has a name, eosinophilia myalgia syndrome (EMS). It is a 
previously rare disorder in which the body makes too many eosinophils, a type 
of white blood cell that usually fights off bacteria or worms. A normal 
eosinophil count is 50 to 350 cells per cubic millimeter of blood. EMS patients 
have counts of several thousand or more. 
</P>
<P>
Since last summer, 24 Americans have died, four of them in California, because 
of complications of EMS. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials confirmed last week that still-unidentified contaminants 
appear to be responsible for the nationwide EMS outbreak. The Food and Drug 
Administration has ordered nearly all tryptophan-containing products removed 
from store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
In November, the Food and Drug Administration recalled all dietary supplements 
that would result in a daily intake of more than 100 milligrams of the amino 
acid. In March, the recall was expanded to products that contain smaller 
amounts of tryptophan. 
</P>
<P>
The November action came after public health officials in New Mexico discovered 
an EMS outbreak there associated with tryptophan use. The U.S. Centers for 
Disease Control then began collecting case reports from other states, and the 
EMS total mounted quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Tryptophan is an amino acid necessary to the human body and found in a wide 
variety of foods. Before the recalls, it had grown by word of mouth into a 
widely recommended "natural" remedy for everything from insomnia to stress and 
premenstrual syndrome. Even physicians were suggesting it to their patients. 
</P>
<P>
They did so based on a few studies indicating that tryptophan elevates the 
level of the sleep-inducing chemical serotonin in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
Studies done since the recall in Oregon and Minnesota appear to point primarily 
to tryptophan made by one amino acid manufacturer as linked to EMS cases. This 
idea is not universally embraced, however, because some EMS cases are not 
linked to that manufacturer at all. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to turn out that there is a contaminant that somehow 
interacts in certain susceptible individuals to set their metabolism of 
tryptophan off in an altered direction," said Dr. Phillip Hertzman, a New 
Mexico physician who helped identify the tryptophan connection to EMS last 
year. "Which would be why not everybody who takes it gets sick." 
</P>
<P>
As a federal investigation continues, an international conference on the 
problem is being planned for June 12 and 13 in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, not knowing what toxin is causing the illness has made EMS difficult 
to treat, and impossible for patients to know if their damaged bodies will 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter had been regularly taking tryptophan for insomnia for about two years 
before she began having early symptoms of EMS last August. By Sept. 11, muscle 
pain was so bad that she went on disability from her job as a materials buyer 
at General Dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter's count of eosinophils has returned to normal, but the condition's 
crushing symptoms remain. 
</P>
<P>
She began a conversation recently by stumbling over her own age: "37. No, wait. 
I just had a birthday. 1954. I'm 36." 
</P>
<P>
It's the kind of memory lapse that's common among EMS-ers, as victims call 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I can't remember my address," Baxter said, beginning a litany of her 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Periodically her voice gets muddy, as muscle spasms in her jaw overtake her 
words: 
</P>
<P>
"I can't put on my socks. I can't put on my underwear. I can't put on my shoes. 
I can bend at the waist, but if I bend at the knees I immediately fall to the 
floor. I have fallen so many times I am black and blue. I can't lift my child. 
I can't do anything around the house. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't do the laundry because I fell in the laundry room. I'm scared to be 
alone sometimes. That's why I don't do anything, because I'm afraid if I fall 
I'll just lie there. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked to do art things, but now my hands go arthritic and so it's very 
difficult. I can hardly write. I forget things. I don't even get the mail 
anymore because I forget where I put it." 
</P>
<P>
To get up from the couch, where she rests when not in bed at her Pacific Beach 
home, Baxter has to push off with both arms. 
</P>
<P>
Like Baxter, Escondido resident Charleen Brown, 61, is still struggling with 
the aftereffects of tryptophan, which she used to help her sleep after getting 
off work as a registered nurse at 12:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I never wanted to take, like, a sleeping pill or any kind of tranquilizer 
because I know how addicting they are," Brown recalled. "As it turned out, I 
probably would have been better off if I had taken a drug." 
</P>
<P>
Her first symptoms last October were shoulder and leg pain so severe that she 
had to quit her job. In December, she spent three weeks in a hospital intensive 
care unit because of circulatory problems in her left arm; her left hand has 
since frozen into a useless claw. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's right leg is paralyzed from the knee down. Although she spends most of 
her time in bed, she can walk short distances by dragging the leg along. 
</P>
<P>
"If I stay up for two hours I consider that a real bonus," Brown said. "This 
has literally destroyed my life." 
</P>
<P>
One of Brown's few outings is a monthly meeting of a support group that Baxter 
put together by calling all the rheumatologists in the Yellow Pages and asking 
them to refer patients to her. About 40 people are in it now. 
</P>
<P>
(This is more than the official tally of 32 EMS cases in San Diego County, but 
public health officials say they are certain many cases have gone unreported.) 
</P>
<P>
Support groups have sprung up all over the country, and they exchange 
information regularly via newsletters and phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Bullock, a Spring Valley woman who took over leadership of the support 
group when Baxter's energy flagged, said the group is especially important to 
its members because most spent months going from doctor to doctor trying to 
find an explanation for their problems. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the FDA's recall of tryptophan last November that doctors 
recognized EMS as a disorder connected to dietary supplements of the amino 
acid. Bullock had begun seeing doctors a year before that. 
</P>
<P>
Her main symptoms were muscle weakness -- "I couldn't get a glass of water to 
my mouth" -- and intense pain that seemed to come in layers. 
</P>
<P>
"I swore I could feel the bone, the tissue around it and the skin all hurting 
separately," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the support group also exchange information about lawsuits that some 
of them have filed against stores where they bought tryptophan, and about 
medical treatments. 
</P>
<P>
Steroids are the primary treatment used against EMS, but in some people they 
provide little relief, patients and doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
Cleansing the blood with a procedure similar to kidney dialysis also has been 
tried, and at least one San Diego patient underwent chelation -- a chemical 
cleansing of the blood usually used to treat lead or mercury poisoning. Baxter 
had several treatments with an anti-cancer drug to bring her eosinophil count 
down. 
</P>
<P>
But the victims with the most serious symptoms confirm what the doctors 
studying EMS say: No single treatment works for everyone, and recovery, if it 
will come at all, is very slow. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the problems EMS victims are experiencing resemble "toxic oil 
syndrome" seen in Spain in 1981, when people bought contaminated olive oil, 
doctors say. About a quarter of those people sustained long-term nerve damage, 
and there is concern that this might also prove the case with EMS, said Dr. 
Edwin Kilbourne, chief of the health studies branch at the U.S. Centers for 
Disease Control. 
</P>
<P>
"In particular, the nerve damage did not seem to get better very quickly," 
Kilbourne said. "There are a substantial number of people in Spain who still 
have residual paralysis or limitations of movement." 
</P>
<P>
That's the kind of outlook that EMS victims hope is proven wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Bullock, who stopped taking tryptophan 18 months ago, so she is farther along 
in her recovery than most, says she has seen slow improvement. 
</P>
<P>
But she still doesn't feel strong enough to re-enroll at Cuyamaca Community 
College: "It's a long walk up to campus from the parking lot. I don't know if I 
could do that and have any energy left for class. Every morning I get up and I 
have to plan my day as to how much energy I will use." 
</P>
<P>
Baxter longs to be able to do simple things like pick up her son, or straighten 
her arm. One characteristic of EMS is broad patches of thick, tough, shiny skin 
that doesn't stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"I just pray that it's not permanent damage -- that I'm going to be able to 
straighten my arms out like normal people, completely straight, without feeling 
that stretching, that tightness of the skin. That the pain is going to go away 
someday," Baxter said. 
</P>
<P>
"I sit here and look at this wheelchair in my living room and think, God, I 
want that damned thing out of here so bad," she said. "I hate to think the rest 
of my life is going to be without being able to walk the dog. Or run. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm not going to die. But I also don't want to live like this."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: WHEN IT COMES TO INSULTS, ALL IS NOT FAIR AT THE FAIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even in an age of assertiveness, Andrew the Ugly (that's what it says on his 
business card) stands out. 
</P>
<P>
For a dollar, he'll insult the victim of your choice. 
</P>
<P>
And not just street-corner, in-your-face insults, but insults with a Monty 
Python tang or an Olde English flair. 
</P>
<P>
Scalding oaths such as, "Go away or I'll unclog my nose at you," or "Your 
mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries." 
</P>
<P>
Or, my favorite, "You're an anal-retentive son of an impotent boil-popper." 
</P>
<P>
Andrew, a.k.a. Andrew Cameron, 23, a resident of Ocean Beach and student at 
Mesa College, peddles his insouciant insolence at Renaissance/pleasure fairs 
throughout the state, including the San Marcos Renaissance Faire each October. 
</P>
<P>
A good insult, he says, "is pleasing to the ear and offensive to the soul." 
</P>
<P>
The insult trade, of course, leans heavily on an excremental vision and concern 
with bodily functions: "You festering heap of yak dung," "You shovelful of 
sun-laden camel snot," etc. 
</P>
<P>
On a good day, he can hurl 50 to 60 insults. 
</P>
<P>
"I take frequent breaks," he said. "I have to think up new material, recompose 
myself and let my voice rest." 
</P>
<P>
He's never been punched, but he was ruled out of bounds by the 
Renaissance-Pleasure Faire now under way at Glen Helen Regional Park in San 
Bernardino. The faire fathers ruled that insults were not in keeping with the 
period theme. 
</P>
<P>
"Cow cookies," responds Andrew the Ugly. "The Elizabethans were a very bawdy 
group." 
</P>
<P>
He notes that the fair is also selling artichokes and churros (Mexican sweet 
breads), delicacies unknown in Renaissance times. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he's not letting his insult-ouster keep him away. He has merely shifted 
to his secondary specialties: 
</P>
<P>
Dung sales and creative passing-out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sorting Things Out 
</P>
<P>
Voice of the people.

* The San Diego Libertarian Party plans a float in the North Park Toyland 
Parade next December. 
</P>
<P>

course), a Boston Tea Party tableau, or Anti-Tax Muppets.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SON HELPS CATCH DRIVER OF MOTHER'S STOLEN CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who witnessed his mother's car being stolen from a Saugus mini-mart 
jumped into his own pickup truck and chased the vehicle four miles, colliding 
with it once, before it broke down just as sheriff's deputies arrived and 
arrested the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Alejandro Ortiz, 20, of Los Angeles was being held on suspicion of auto theft 
and assault with a deadly weapon, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Tim 
Peters. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
The son, Saul Holguin of Canyon Country, had accompanied his mother, Ramona 
Holguin, to a mini-mart in the 16300 block of Sierra Highway. She left the keys 
in the ignition of her 1986 Cougar and the thief got in the car and drove off, 
Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
Saul Holguin chased him north on Sierra Highway. Holguin swerved when the thief 
tried to ram his truck, but the vehicles sideswiped each other. As sheriff's 
patrol cars joined in the chase, the stolen car stalled.

<P>
VETERAN ARCHITECT LOUIS NAIDORF TO HEAD PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Woodbury University's architecture program will take on a new staff design with 
the appointment of veteran architect Louis Naidorf as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The architect, whose work ranges from architecture and urban design to research 
and design methods, succeeds Donald Conway. Naidorf, 61, who will take over the 
post June 18, is an architect at the Santa Monica architecture firm Ellerbe 
Becket and will continue working there part time. 
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline Powers Doud, vice president of academic affairs at the college, 
said: "We are delighted that a professional of such distinction will be leading 
the architecture program. His distinction speaks for itself, including the 40 
years professional experience at Ellerbe Becket, his academic background . . . 
and his extensive teaching experience." 
</P>
<P>
His principal architecture projects include the Hyatt Regency in Dallas, the 
Capitol Records Building in Los Angeles, the restoration of the California 
State Capitol in Sacramento and the Naval Medical Center in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
During the past 18 years, Naidorf also has become increasingly interested and 
involved in the education of architects. 
</P>
<P>
He has been an instructor, guest critic, seminar coordinator and lecturer at 
architecture and design programs at UCLA, USC, Cal Poly Pomona, Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo, the Southern California Institute of Architecture and the Otis Art 
Institute of Parsons School of Design. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to give students the confidence to provide both art and function 
without compromise in the design of their buildings," Naidorf said. 
</P>
<P>
Naidorf has won numerous professional awards and is widely published in 
professional journals.

COLLEGE of the CANYONS 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors Protest Board's Plans for Swap Meets 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors of College of the Canyons in Valencia have gathered more than 500 
signatures on a petition protesting a recent decision by the college's 
governing board to allow a swap meet to use the campus on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
A contract between the Santa Clarita Community College District Board of 
Trustees and swap meet organizers has not been signed, but the meets were to 
begin the first weekend of July. The trustees had requested minor changes in 
the proposed contract when they endorsed the on-campus swap meets recently. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty homeowners attended a trustees meeting last month, and many said the 
swap meets would bring additional traffic, noise and trash to their 
neighborhood and would cause the value of their homes to drop. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Michele Jenkins said the audience was the largest she had seen at a 
meeting in five years. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe a swap meet would cause a severe environmental impact," said Alan 
Zada, director of the Valencia Summit Homeowner Assn. He said post-swap meet 
trash would line the area's streets. 
</P>
<P>
Nazareth Chobanian, one of the swap meet organizers, said the area would be 
cleaned up after each week's event. Residents whose homes face the college said 
they paid up to $30,000 more for their homes because of the view they have of 
the campus. Several said locating a swap meet there would decrease the value of 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners acknowledged that the college needs to raise money and offered 
to develop alternative sources of funds. 
</P>
<P>
College Supt.-President Dianne Van Hook assured homeowners that their views 
would be considered before trustees decide whether to sign the final contract 
with the swap meet organizers. 
</P>

PIERCE COLLEGE 
</P>
<P>
Rodeo Back in the Saddle Again After 4 Years 
</P>
<P>
The 34th annual Pierce College Intercollegiate Rodeo, which last month returned 
to Pierce after a four-year absence, came off virtually without a hitch, 
according to its organizer. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been, without a doubt, the finest rodeo in the 19 years I've been 
here," said Ron Wechsler, an animal science instructor who is in charge of the 
rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
A small protest by about a dozen animal-rights activists didn't affect the 
two-day rodeo, attended by 10,000 people. The rodeo was held May 11 and 12. The 
rodeo's hiatus had resulted because the college had been unable to secure 
liability insurance for the event. 
</P>
<P>
Five college teams, from as far away as Nevada, competed in eight events during 
the weekend. West Hills College of Coalinga, which is ranked first nationally, 
won the meet. Cal Poly San Luis Obispo finished second. 
</P>
<P>
The Pierce team placed third overall and was led by saddle bronc rider Richard 
Bucher. Bucher, who is ranked second in the West Coast Intercollegiate Rodeo 
Assn., won a second place on one of the rodeo's two nights and placed fourth 
overall. Pierce's Michelle Morrison won second place in the Girl's Barrel Race 
and also placed fourth overall. 
</P>
<P>
Though he characterized the rodeo as a success, Wechsler said he is unsure 
whether it will become an annual event. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy to get funding with all the cutbacks" at Pierce, "but we did it 
and it worked well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The rodeo grossed about $30,000, but the net profit from the event is not yet 
known. Profits will go to support agriculture programs at Pierce.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
CARDINALS STEAL WAY TO VICTORY OVER CUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The St. Louis Cardinals might not have the most power in the major leagues, but 
they certainly can steal bases as well as any other team. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've got the best percentage in the league," Manager Whitey Herzog 
said Sunday after the speedy but light-hitting Cardinals stole eight bases in 
as many tries and beat the Chicago Cubs, 7-4, at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been too many days when we haven't had the opportunities," Herzog 
said. "We haven't had many days like this." 
</P>
<P>
Vince Coleman had four of the eight steals, giving him a major league-leading 
28 in 33 tries. 
</P>
<P>
"I have high expectations from here on out throughout my career," Coleman said. 
"My approach to the game right now is I know what I'm doing. I know what I have 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's stolen-base total matched his one-game career high, which he has 
accomplished seven times. Ozzie Smith stole three bases, also matching a career 
high, and Willie McGee had the other. 
</P>
<P>
"There's only one way to stop them," Chicago Manager Don Zimmer said. "The 
pitchers have got to give the catcher a chance. If you're slow getting the ball 
to the plate, then you've got no chance." 
</P>
<P>
Although not noted for their power, the Cardinals also got home runs by Tom 
Pagnozzi and Milt Thompson. The combination of power and speed was a rarity for 
the Cardinals, who entered the game tied for last in the NL in batting. 
</P>
<P>
The eight stolen bases matched the single-game high in the majors this season. 
Houston had eight against Pittsburgh May 23. The last time the Cardinals stole 
eight bases was Sept. 13, 1985, also against the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals' homers were their first in six games and only 20th and 21st of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 7, Houston 3-Robby Thompson hit a three-run homer and Kevin 
Mitchell had a two-run homer at Candlestick Park as the Giants won for the 
fifth time in the last six games. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson hit his fifth homer of the season in the second inning and Mitchell 
added his 14th in the third as the Giants routed Mike Scott (2-6), scoring 
their seven runs in four innings. 
</P>
<P>
Houston's Glenn Davis had another productive day, driving in all three runs. He 
has nine RBIs in the last three games. He hit a solo homer -- his fifth in 
seven at-bats over three games and league-leading 15th of the season -- and had 
a two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' leadoff homer in the second inning was the Astros' only hit off Atlee 
Hammaker until the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 8, New York 3 -- At Philadelphia, Von Hayes hit a home run and 
drove in four runs and Lenny Dykstra, the major leagues' leading hitter, had 
two singles and a double in four official at-bats, extending his hitting streak 
to 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
Dykstra, who was eight for 12 in the three-game series against his former team, 
raised his average to .413. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Harrelson is 1-3 since replacing Dave Johnson as manager of the Mets 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 4, Pittsburgh 3 -- Mike Fitzgerald doubled home the go-ahead run off 
rookie reliever Stan Belinda in a three-run ninth inning at Pittsburgh to give 
the Expos their fifth victory in six games. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Raines walked to lead off the ninth, stole second and continued to third 
when catcher Don Slaught threw the ball into center field. Slaught had thrown 
out runners attempting to steal in the sixth and seventh innings. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Wallach singled home Raines with the tying run and moved to second when 
right fielder Bobby Bonilla's throw hit him in the leg. After pinch-hitter 
Wallace Johnson was walked intentionally, Fitzgerald doubled, driving in 
pinch-runner Spike Owen. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 4, San Diego 2 -- Pinch-hitter Jeff Treadway doubled in the go-ahead 
run in the 10th inning at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Treadway's double to left-center drove in Alexis Infante. Greg Olson led off 
with a walk against Greg Harris (3-1). Infante attempted a sacrifice bunt, but 
instead forced pinch-runner John Smoltz. Ron Gant's two-out single, his third 
hit of the game, scored Treadway. 
</P>
<P>
The game marked the first Atlanta appearance by left-hander Charlie Leibrandt, 
who who was obtained from Kansas City last winter. Leibrandt was activated from 
the disabled list Saturday after missing nearly two months with a slightly torn 
rotator cuff. 
</P>
<P>
Leibrandt yielded seven hits, including a run-scoring single by Mark Parent in 
the second inning, walked one and struck out three in seven innings.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
CLEMENS GETS EVEN, THEN EARNS 9TH WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before concentrating on Sunday's game with at Cleveland, Boston's Roger Clemens 
had some unfinished business to attend to. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens fired his second pitch at the midsection of leadoff hitter Stan 
Jefferson, clipping him just above the elbow in retaliation for a brushback 
pitch thrown by Cleveland's Doug Jones the night before. 
</P>
<P>
A bench-clearing brawl followed before Clemens settled down to strike out a 
season-high 11 hitters and become the first nine-game winner in the major 
leagues as the Red Sox beat the Indians, 8-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved it. We got even, didn't we?" Boston Manager Joe Morgan said. "We voted 
as a team 34-0 that it would be such. I think they figured after last night, 
this was inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
Jones threw a pitch past the head of Boston's Tony Pena in the ninth inning 
Saturday night, after Pena tripled home a run off Jones on Friday. Pena and 
Cleveland's Chris James were ejected during Sunday's fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody on this team has to come up and tell a pitcher how to pitch," Clemens 
said. "I'm going to try to pitch effectively and do what the situation calls 
for. I wouldn't have nine wins if not for the guys in this dressing room. You 
can take that anyway you want. I've seen situations where guys got hit in the 
head, and you want to stay out of that." 
</P>
<P>
Caught in the middle of it all was Jefferson. He did not charge the mound when 
he was hit, but he did ask Clemens for an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the incident with Jonesy and Pena was harmless," Jefferson said. "I 
didn't think it would carry over to today. I guess it did. Clemens said he was 
sorry it was me, and he said if I was on his team, he'd do the same for me." 
</P>
<P>
X-rays of Jefferson's arm were negative. 
</P>
<P>
Two Boston batters were hit by pitches later in the game, but neither caused an 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Pena was not in the starting lineup Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens (9-2), who pitched eight innings, gave up seven hits and walked one, 
improving to 12-2 against the Indians in his career. He is 5-0 with a 1.69 
earned-run average in six starts since May 9. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 8, Oakland 2 -- Mark Gubicza restricted the Athletics to four hits 
in eight innings and Jim Eisenreich and Kurt Stillwell each drove in two runs 
as the Royals beat Dave Stewart at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals split the four-game series after losing the first two. The 
West-leading Athletics stayed 11 games ahead of the last-place Royals. 
</P>
<P>
Gubicza (3-5) gave up a run-scoring double to Willie Randolph in the third 
inning before retiring 15 straight. He struck out eight and walked none. Jeff 
Montgomery struck out the side in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart (8-3), the winningest pitcher in the major leagues the past three 
seasons, gave up seven runs on seven hits and six walks in 5 1/3 innings. It's 
only the second time in two years he has lost consecutive decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart's league-leading ERA jumped from 1.79 to 2.45. He walked six batters in 
a game for the first time since Aug. 16, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 2, Seattle 0 -- One day after Randy Johnson pitched the first no-hitter 
in Mariner history, Frank Tanana gave up only three hits in 8 1/3 innings at 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Tanana (4-3) struck out four and walked two. He left after Harold Reynolds 
singled with one out in the ninth. Mike Henneman finished to get his 13th save. 
</P>
<P>
Tanana's performance came after Johnson's 2-0 victory over the Tigers Saturday 
night. Johnson walked six and struck out eight in pitching the only no-hitter 
in the Mariners' 14-year existence. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the Tigers wasted no time in getting a hit. Lou Whitaker led off the 
game with a double and scored on Alan Trammell's single off Erik Hanson (5-4). 
</P>
<P>
Whitaker, who began the game batting .192, led off the fifth inning with his 
seventh homer of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 4, New York 3 -- Mickey Tettleton's two-run homer broke an 
eighth-inning tie at Yankee Stadium as the Orioles handed the Yankees their 
seventh loss in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Witt (0-4) walked Cal Ripken and Tettleton followed with his sixth homer 
to make it 4-2. It was Witt's first decision since the Yankees got him from the 
Angels for Dave Winfield. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Milacki (3-3) left after Steve Sax singled with one out in the eighth. Mark 
Williamson gave up Roberto Kelly's single and Kevin Hickey yielded Don 
Mattingly's RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Olson relieved and retired pinch-hitter Steve Balboni and Jesse Barfield 
on fly balls. Olson pitched the ninth for his 11th save. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 7, Milwaukee 4 -- Fred McGriff and Pat Borders each drove in two runs 
as the Blue Jays celebrated the one-year anniversary of the SkyDome by 
defeating the team that beat them in their first game there last June 5. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 49,702, the largest regular-season crowd in team history, watched as 
the Blue Jays ended a three-game losing streak. The Blue Jays are 51-38 at home 
since the stadium opened. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stieb (7-2) gave up three runs and nine hits in six innings to become the 
first Toronto starter to win at home since he beat the Chicago White Sox on May 
8. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 5, Minnesota 2 -- Jack McDowell won for the first time since April 25 
and the White Sox salvaged a split of the four-game series at Chicago between 
two of the hottest teams in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago has won 10 of 14 games and is 20-8 at home, tops in the majors. The 
Twins lost for just the third time in their last 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
McDowell (2-3), the former Stanford star, pitched 6 1/3 innings, yielded six 
hits, struck out seven and walked one as he snapped a winless streak of six 
starts (two losses and four no-decisions). 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox scored four runs in the second to erase a 1-0 deficit. Carlton 
Fisk led off with an infield single and took second on Scott Fletcher's single. 
Lance Johnson and Ozzie Guillen followed with RBI singles. Sammy Sosa capped 
the rally with a two-run single.

CLARK'S DRIVE KEYS VICTORY FOR 2-A 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
It didn't take long for Tony Clark to show why he's been compared to Darryl 
Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did it take long for him to show why he's expected to be selected by the 
Detroit Tigers with the second pick in today's free-agent draft. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, the 6-foot-7 senior from Christian High School, hit a prodigious two-run 
double off the center field wall at San Diego State's Smith field Sunday night, 
keying the 2-A's 10-6 victory over the 3-A in the Jack Taylor Memorial All-Star 
Game. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave the 2-A a 2-1 series lead. The 2-A won last year's game, 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
This year's game was again dominated by the offenses, though some of the 
county's best pitchers were on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-A scored 10 runs on 11 hits and committed three errors. The 3-A scored 
six runs on 10 hits and had five errors. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the San Diego County Baseball Coaches Assn., which selected both 
teams from among the county's best seniors, the game offered something for 
everybody. 
</P>
<P>
Especially those who had not yet seen Clark play. 
</P>
<P>
Although Clark provided the game's most memorable moment, it was Sweetwater's 
Larry Meza who had the best overall performance at the plate. He went three for 
four and won most valuable player honors for the 3-A. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont's John Tatum, who went two for three, scored a run, drove in a run 
and pitched the final inning, was named the player of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-A MVP was Clark, who got a look at some pretty tough pitching. He faced 
Poway's 12-game winner, Danny Miller, in the first inning and was robbed of a 
hit when Miller dived to his left to field Clark's ball up the middle. Miller 
threw out Clark. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't supposed to get any easier in the second when Clark faced Eric 
Nicholson of Helix. All Nicholson did this year was win 11 games without a 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
But with Escondido's Tom Afenir and Crawford's Todd Davis on base, Clark 
feasted on a Nicholson pitch and hammered a towering fly ball off the wall in 
center field, 395-feet away. Clark stopped at second on the two-run double. He 
then scored from second when Grossmont's John Tatum hit a grounder that slipped 
under the glove of Meza at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
That gave the 2-A a 6-1 lead and put them out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
But Clark, showing that anything can happen, struck out in his final at-bat, 
against Torrey Pines' Shaw Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
The winner was starter Ferdie Hollis of Santana, who pitched the first two 
innings. The loser was Miller, who surrendered two unearned runs in the first 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Miller was one of four players who earlier in the day earned spots on the South 
Team for the North-South All-Star Series which takes place next weekend in San 
Jose. The others were Rob Ippolito of Helix, Afenir of Escondido, and Brett 
Callan of Point Loma.

JACK SMITH: A MOMENT OF HAPPINESS AT THE SHORE OF GALILEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By JACK SMITH

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We rushed through the Old City of Jerusalem, visiting various mosques and 
shrines and holy places. Here and there priests of one sect or another were 
singing their prayers before altars, oblivious of the herds of tourists. The 
places seemed too ancient and too holy to be profaned by mere tourists. 
</P>
<P>
The shops along the narrow lanes in the Arab quarter closed at noon. Our guide 
told us that Palestinian protesters had insisted on the closing. Graffito was 
scrawled on shop walls as a warning. But he said they needed the business, so 
the half-day closing was a compromise. "Business before politics," he said 
cynically. 
</P>
<P>
That afternoon we drove the short distance to Bethlehem to see the birthplace 
of Jesus in the Church of the Nativity, brushing past swarms of peddlers 
outside the doors. The birthplace and the manger were contained in a grotto or 
cave. It seemed strange to me that the exact site would be known, but our 
guidebook explained that the knowledge had been passed down from father to son, 
and the Christian emperor Constantine's pious mother, Helena, found it and 
built a basilica over it in 325. 
</P>
<P>
The next day we set out for Tiberias, on the Sea of Galilee. Everywhere I was 
struck by the newness of Israel and the antiquity of its setting. At the foot 
of the Mount of Olives we passed an automobile junkyard. On the desert roads we 
passed several low-slung Bedouin tents surrounded by sheep, goats and donkeys. 
Outside one, a woman on a horse was leading 200 to 300 sheep. A man on a horse 
was following with some kind of flute. Our guide said, "Most of them use 
cassette recorders now." 
</P>
<P>
In Jericho, a green oasis in the desert and perhaps the world's oldest city, we 
stopped at a stand where brilliantly colored fruit was laid out for sale. 
Tangerines, grapefruit, melons, dates, kumquats, apples and prunes. The prunes 
were imported from California. 
</P>
<P>
Above the Sea of Galilee we stopped to visit a kibbutz. It seemed strangely 
tranquil. Its residents lived in small row houses behind small yards filled 
with bright flowers. A very young man sat at a table outdoors in front of his 
house with his wife and a small child. His garden was vivid. "My grandfather 
planted that garden," he volunteered as we strolled past. Another young man 
rode down the walk in a John Deere tractor pulling a wagon full of children. It 
seemed almost too idyllic, especially when one remembered that the hills of 
Lebanon were not far away. 
</P>
<P>
We arrived in Tiberias in time for lunch aboard a boat on the Sea of Galilee. 
Though the day was clouded and the sea was not its storied blue, it was indeed 
beautiful in its ring of mountains. I was offered a Joseph's fish but elected 
chicken. The fish was large and whole, the shape of a deflated football, and I 
did not like its baleful eye. 
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon we visited several sites where Jesus is said to have preached 
or performed miracles, including Capernaum, where he preached in the synagogue 
and "healed great multitudes," and the Church of the Beatitudes, where Jesus 
spoke the immortal words -- "Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the 
kingdom of heaven. . . ." and the spot where he is said to have fed 5,000 
followers with five loaves of bread and two fishes. A new church stands over 
the site of ancient Byzantine mosaics. On a stone that served as the altar is a 
mosaic of a basket of loaves and two fishes. Our guide asked for someone to 
read an appropriate verse. One of our group, Ann Conway, obliged: 
</P>
<P>
"He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? Go and see. And when they knew, 
they say, Five, and two fishes. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
She read it beautifully, and then we were on our bus again, arriving finally at 
the beautiful Galei Kinneret Hotel at the Sea of Galilee. 
</P>
<P>
Our room had a small balcony that overlooked the sea. It was late in the day 
and the sea was dark bronze. A magnificent eucalyptus tree stood on the shore 
against the cloudy sky. We had no sooner entered the room than my wife went out 
onto the balcony and sat in the chair, facing the sea. I left her alone. 
</P>
<P>
Half an hour later she came in. By then the sea was dark and a nearly full moon 
had risen. She said, "I don't know when I've had time to spend half an hour 
just looking at something beautiful. I cried." 
</P>
<P>
I think it was the high point of our trip.

* Booked: The authors of a book about the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over 
Lockerbie, Scotland, are mailing a copy to Ahmed Jibril, identified in the book 
as the architect of the bombing. Steven Emerson and Brian Duffy inscribed "The 
Fall of Pan Am 103" with the phrase "In the interest of truth and justice" and 
mailed a copy to Jibril's Paris contact. Emerson said they are sending the copy 
without the dust jacket, which contains their pictures. 
</P>
<P>
* M Is for Mistake: The book "E Is For Elvis" calls James Kingsley "a friend of 
Elvis Presley" and "a reporter for the Memphis Commercial Appeal" who "died of 
a self-inflicted gunshot wound" on Feb. 22 last year. But reports of Kingsley's 
death were greatly exaggerated; he's still alive. His reaction to the book: "I 
didn't know what to think." An unrelated movie stuntman named James Kingsley 
did die of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on that date. An editor for the 
publisher said last week he was trying to sort it out. 
</P>
<P>
* Higher Appeal: A petition was sent Friday to the U.N. Commission on Human 
Rights asking that a representative attend the trial of Washington, D.C., Mayor 
Marion Barry. The United Nations has not responded, said attorney Mary Cox, who 
filed the request. The petition claims the U.S. government violated Barry's 
human rights in the sting operation Jan. 18 that led to his arrest and trial on 
perjury and drug charges, which is scheduled to start today. 
</P>
<P>
* The Show Goes On: Oglethorpe University in Atlanta has come to the rescue of 
a Soviet circus troupe that ran out of money last month on its U.S. tour and 
was kicked out of a hotel. About 40 performers will stay in a dormitory on the 
campus. "They agreed to do it out of the kindness of their hearts," said Great 
Circus Bim Bom spokesman Bob Liberman.

INTO THE NIGHT: CELEBRITY AND CELESTIAL STARGAZING MAKE 'TOTAL RECALL' BASH 
MEMORABLE

<P>
The Scene: Mega-bash Thursday night for "Total Recall," a Tri-Star release that 
promises to be boffo at the box office. After a packed screening at the 
Hollywood Pacific (where, outside, fans chanted, "Ah-nald! Ah-nald!" when 
"Total Recall" star Schwarzenegger arrived), Columbia hosted a party at 
Griffith Observatory, where guests were treated to laser shows, dancing, 
psychics, tarot card and palm readers and a great view of L.A. from the roof. 
Guests could gaze at the grid and privately hope that, someday, all that would 
be theirs. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: Ronny Cox, one of the film's co-stars, summed it up when he excitedly 
said to a friend, "I think the buzz on this is good." While some seemed alarmed 
by the film's screechy noise level, spurting blood and high body count, most 
seemed sure it would bring in audiences -- even if they have to pay the new 
inflated ticket price of $7.50 at some theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: Schwarzenegger, with his wife, Maria Shriver, and his mother, 
Aurelia; director Paul Verhoeven, co-stars Michael Ironside, Rachel Ticotin and 
Sharon Stone; plus Mimi Rogers, Grace Jones, Paul Michael Glaser, Debbie Allen, 
Jack and Elaine LaLanne, Mr. T, Nicholas Cage, Laura Dern, Pat Riley, Tony 
Danza, Pierce Brosnan, Wayne Gretzky and wife Janet Jones, Michael Nouri, Ivan 
Reitman, Sandra Bernhard, Robert Davi, Lou Ferrigno, Julian Sands, Esai 
Morales, Timothy and Barbara Leary, and Sondra Locke. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Mode: Standouts in the mostly business-suited crowd included Mr. T's neon 
graffiti-printed shorts and jacket accessorized with his usual colossal 
collection of gold chains; Grace Jones' slinky grape-colored dress and 
painted-on eyebrows; Debbie Allen's hot-pink satin pouf jacket; Jack LaLanne's 
red and black pin-striped suit; Wayne Gretzky's stubble, and Mimi Rogers' 
tailored jacket over low-cut T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: Along Came Mary fed the hungry troops buffet-style, with mini-hamburgers, 
onion rings, pizza, scallop skewers, baby racks of lamb, and sundaes, cookies 
and brownies. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: Who is Schwarzenegger's toughest critic? His mother, of course. But not 
to worry -- "She loved it," he said. "I always ask her what she thinks. She 
thought the action was great, all the futuristic things." 
</P>
<P>
Overheard: "I knew I needed earplugs for the Roxy, but I didn't think I'd need 
to bring them to a movie," said one woman whose ears were still ringing an hour 
after the movie had ended. 
</P>
<P>
A Movie by Any Other Name . . .: One industry wag has already re-dubbed the 
film, "Like, I Recall -- Totally!" 
</P>
<P>
OK, but Is There Going to Be a Total Recall II?: Not directed by Verhoeven, it 
seems. "I don't think I could do this again," he admitted. "I'd get kind of 
bored, probably."

A NOVEL DOOMED BY ITS OWN PACE

<P>
ONE TRUE THING by Greg Matthews Grove Weidenfeld $18.95, 306 pages 
</P>
<P>
"One True Thing" is about the weirdness of Middle America, at least I hope 
that's what it's about. It's also about the nature of longing and yearning and 
about how desperately difficult it can be to fulfill even the most minimal 
ambition. You can also tab this as a flawed novel, since it's full of signs and 
symbols that lend the narrative a portentousness that never pans out. 
Alternately, you can label Greg Matthews as an author doomed to be 
misunderstood by his critics. (Or at least this critic.) 
</P>
<P>
Here is the story: Out on the plains of Kansas in the somewhat faraway past 
("the unexciting months that followed Hiroshima"), a war veteran named Lowell 
Kootz comes home with a burning vision for the betterment of his town, 
Callisto, Kan.: a new motel, called the Thunderbird, a circle of concrete 
tepees with a big concrete tepee in the middle, and an 80-foot concrete totem 
pole, crackling with neon, outside, beckoning to drivers on the interstate. 
</P>
<P>
Lowell gets his dream, marries a waitress -- to the chagrin of respectable folk 
in the town of Callisto -- and has a son named Ray. Lowell soon turns to 
womanizing and drink, and manages to kill himself off in a car accident. Ray, 
desperately lonely, lives with his mom in the big concrete tepee; joins a gun 
club, seduces a sad girl, then drops her, then watches his best friend go off 
to war. (Is the pace too fast here? In the novel, decades go by in a paragraph, 
which may indeed be the nature of the reality the author is trying to mirror, 
but leaves the reader leafing back through the pages to keep everything in 
order.) 
</P>
<P>
All Ray wants is love, and a family. He never wants to leave Callisto, Kan., 
and never does; he wants no more of a career than managing the Thunderbird 
Motel, and that's all the career he gets. His wife-to-be rides by (with a son 
from a previous marriage) and Ray rouses himself enough to slash her tires, so 
that he will have time with her to mount a courtship. . . . 
</P>
<P>
So Ray and Holly get married. Ray and his stepson, Milo, never get along. Ray 
and Holly have a kid of their own, Kevin, but Ray's wife fools around, because 
that's just the way she is, and about two-thirds of the way through the novel, 
a bizarre and grotesque death occurs, and the narrative turns to devil worship, 
cocaine dealing, snuff movies, and the possibility of redemption by the love of 
a good woman. (Meanwhile, Ray Kootz is still back behind the desk of the lobby 
of the Thunderbird, checking customers in and signing them out; sinking into 
hopelessness and coming up for a breath of hope every once in a while.) 
</P>
<P>
'One True Thing" is a very interesting novel, and the author has set himself an 
ambitious assignment. Surely "literature" in this country must remember and 
immortalize all the Ray Kootzes of this world: If we call Kansas our 
"Heartland," that must be where the American heart is. And every human being 
must have a human soul, even if he or she is unable to articulate anything but 
the most ill-humored cliches. But other literary cliches also hold true here: 
How do you write about ill-tempered dumbbells and still hold the reader's 
interest? How can we be made to care about the fate of Ray Kootz and his 
children? What is the "meaning" of the Thunderbird Motel, and why does Milo 
insist on four gold teeth? What's the function of the snuff movie in the 
narrative? Finally, if the nature of Middle America has changed so violently 
since 1950, wouldn't the author like to take a stab at saying why? It looks as 
if Greg Matthews started one novel and finished another. It happens sometimes. 
Or, this whole story went right over my head. God knows, that happens too.

A Bee of a Sale: An auction of belongings of the late Francis Bavier, better 
known as Aunt Bee on the popular "Andy Griffith Show," stirred up a fuss at her 
Raleigh, N.C., home Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Everything offered for sale, from the actress's yellowed contracts to her 
guacamole-green Studebaker Daytona with 43,000 miles, rotting tires and a 
ceramic donkey on the dashboard were snapped up by fans. A sofa was auctioned 
for $1,400 and a Queen Anne dining table with six chairs went for $1,800. One 
fan bought Bavier's rake for $45. GREG BRAXTON

Rap It Up: Amateur rappers will soon get an opportunity to "get on the mike" 
and maybe appear on a rap album. 
</P>
<P>
Music Plus and Epic Records are co-sponsoring a statewide contest for unsigned 
rap musicians, and the winners will be included on a compilation cassette, 
"Music Plus Street Rap '90." Music Plus officials said the project reflected 
the company's commitment to supporting rap music with a positive message and 
fighting the stereotype that all rap music is a threat. Entrants should submit 
a cassette with their original rap song and an official entry form at any Music 
Plus store between June 21 and July 15. GREG BRAXTON

ENGLAND'S PSYCHIC TV RECEIVES SPOTTY RECEPTION

Genesis P-Orridge created the forerunner of all industrial terror-music groups 
(Throbbing Gristle), led a pseudo-religion and has exhibited his body piercings 
in underground publications. These days the Englishman and his group Psychic TV 
play a style called acid house that mixes minimal, disco-dub "house" rhythms 
with psychedelic electronic effects. 
</P>
<P>
With its light shows, films and writhing fans in both gloom-doom and neo-hippie 
attire, Psychic TV's show at Helter Skelter on Friday resembled a '90s version 
of a Merry Pranksters' hippie-era acid test. As three musicians played along 
with tapes and P-Orridge's wife Paula manipulated a drum machine, he started 
out lucid, but as the night throbbed on, he slipped into his own altered state, 
droning indistinguishable slogans against a never-ending, never-changing trance 
groove. It might have provided some with hypnotic catharsis, but one man's 
ecstasy was another man's agony. CRAIG LEE

marathon, which will start at midnight on July 3, will include "On the 
Waterfront," "Now Voyager," "The Right Stuff," "The Alamo," "The Music Man," 
"West Side Story," "A Star is Born (with Judy Garland)," "Red River" and

VIVECA VASQUEZ DEFIES EXPECTATIONS AT LACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Puerto Rican choreographer Viveca Vasquez makes works that seem to announce 
their themes but then defy expectations by expressing something entirely 
different. 
</P>
<P>
At LACE on Friday, the three parts of Vasquez's "Malad Justed" began with a 
slide show, movie and/or videotape establishing a subject or context: footage 
of a woman in bed ("Mira y que -- 3rd Wash"), glimpses of a woman doing laundry 
and snapshots of growing up ("Bothbirth"), views of a produce market, people on 
a beach and a landscape rushing by ("Vieques Ain't Nor Was No Fish"). 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez's choreography occasionally referred to this screen imagery -- the use 
of a mattress in "Mira y que," for instance, along with the rocking-a-baby 
gestures in "Bothbirth" and the swimming motions in "Vieques." However, much of 
the time she explored only formal dance issues. 
</P>
<P>
Loss of balance formed the heart of her choreography, with hopping on one foot, 
knee-walking and lunge-like falls occurring throughout the program. Shared 
weight and other tactics of support between Vasquez and Eduardo Alegria 
dominated "Mira y que." Even more than the frequent, sudden shifts of impetus, 
the action of teetering unified the "Bothbirth" solo. And though "Vieques" 
added a text to its visuals spelling out the devastation wrought upon a small 
island by both the U.S. Navy and Hurricane Hugo, the dancing (especially in the 
solo for Dorcas Roman) again made tests of equilibrium its primary concern. 
</P>
<P>
Is Vasquez commenting ironically on the new political imperatives of '90s 
artmaking -- or trying to cloak a hermetic movement style in contemporary 
multimedia effects and social references? Impossible to determine in this first 
West Coast performance. But the suspicion lingers that she is a very private 
artist making an uneasy bargain with the world outside her dance studio. LEWIS

LOS ANGELES BAROQUE ORCHESTRA CLOSES ITS SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The period-instrument Los Angeles Baroque Orchestra ended its season this 
weekend in characteristic fashion -- three lithe, pointed performances of 
strong, unhackneyed repertory. 
</P>
<P>
The program was devoted to Italian cantatas by Handel, sung by sopranos Mary 
Rawcliffe and Virginia Sublett. As heard Friday at St. Paul's Lutheran Church 
in Santa Monica, the pairing of voices and music proved well-nigh ideal. 
</P>
<P>
"Aminta e Fillide," a lengthy pastoral lovers' dialogue, capped the evening. 
Each singer had ample opportunity to prove her agility, breath control and 
interpretive focus over 10 varied arias, culminating in a joyful, irresistible 
gem of a duet. 
</P>
<P>
Each also had a solo cantata. Sublett's was the angry plaint of "Tu fedel? tu 
costante?" to which she brought a generous supply of cool, round sound and 
expressive clarity. Her voice had a fine shimmer suggesting untapped depths, 
and her dramatic instincts with this mannered text proved sure. 
</P>
<P>
Rawcliffe's assignment was "Tra le fiamme," a contrasting vehicle for her 
brighter, lighter sound and narrative poise. Shadowed by florid viola da gamba 
obbligatos -- bravely executed by Mark Chatfield, though not projecting well -- 
she sang with purity and grace. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the long program -- 22 arias and duos, plus recitatives and 
instrumental preludes -- was the blithely sung duet "No, di voi non vo' 
fidarmi," which Handel soon translated into two "Messiah" choruses. 
</P>
<P>
Once past patches of misintonation in the opening Sonata of "Tu fedel?" the 
orchestra played with lean, limber, characterful zest. Led by concertmaster and 
music director Gregory Maldonado, the band sounded fresh yet well-drilled, 
pertinent and responsive. 
</P>
<P>
The Achilles heel of this ensemble was the inconsistency of its solo flights. 
Harpsichordist Edward Murray and the indefatigable Chatfield anchored a large 
and solid continuo section, but individual efforts throughout the orchestra 
could be desperate gambles on sour notes and fumbled articulation. JOHN HENKEN

NEUBAUER SOLOIST IN LONG BEACH SEASON FINALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looking back at JoAnn Falletta's first season as conductor of the Long Beach 
Symphony, supporters of that orchestra have good reason to rejoice. Concerts 
are sold out, the pre-concert lectures are well-attended, and the orchestra 
plays better than ever. 
</P>
<P>
And certainly among Falletta's triumphs is an entire season of brilliantly 
planned programs. The final regular subscription program of the season -- 
Saturday at the Terrace Theater -- is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
There are those who deny the existance of a viola concerto repertoire, but 
William Walton's handsomely wrought, highly original and adroitly scored 
concerto disproves that immediately. Paul Neubauer, who at 27 already has 
behind him a 5-year tenure as principal violist of the New York Philharmonic 
(he resigned from that post about a year ago), delivered an absorbing and 
utterly convincing account of the 1929 composition. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-born violist produced a rich, warm sound and infused the 
haunting melodies of the slow movements with great ardor. To the crackling 
Scherzo he brought clarity and remarkable control. The orchestra supported him 
with vitality and, for the most part, rhythmic security. 
</P>
<P>
After intermission, Falletta and the orchestra brought probing depth and 
telling insight to Brahms' First Symphony. The conductor paid fine attention to 
detail, and textures remained clear and balances judicious -- until the very 
end, where the brass were allowed to exert to the point to raucousness. 
</P>
<P>
John Harbison's "Remembering Gatsby: Foxtrot for Orchestra" opened the program 
with spirited good nature. TERRY McQUILKIN

MOZART PROGRAM SHOWS OFF EARLY WORKS

Ideally, a well-planned festival invites excursions on musical paths less 
traveled. Saturday evening at the Lowell Davies Festival Theatre, Mainly 
Mozart's second program followed the rule and balanced Mozart's early Piano 
Concerto in E-flat, K. 271, with the even earlier Symphony No. 21 in A Major, 
K. 134. Music director David Atherton's unhackneyed programming was but the 
concert's first virtue. 
</P>
<P>
The second virtue was enlisting pianist Gustavo Romero as the concerto soloist. 
While he made his Mainly Mozart Festival debut on this program, the San Diego 
native is hardly unknown to local audiences. More than a Mozart specialist, 
Romero plays Mozart's keyboard music with uncommon insight. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his creamy legato and consistently elegant phrasing, Romero 
knows how to build his interpretation from the composer's smallest motifs. With 
diligent articulation and subtle accent, for example, Romero infused the simple 
unaccompanied theme at the opening of the Andantino with a lyrical sensibility 
that radiated throughout the movement. Unlike those pianists who mindlessly 
dispatch Mozart's passagework as if to say, "But wait until you hear my 
Beethoven -- it's smashing!" Romero brought a sense of urgency and mental 
presence to the concerto's bravura finale. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the festival's Kawai grand piano did not provide the soloist 
with adequate sonic resources. In the treble range, where the composer outlines 
his most tender melodies, the instrument sounded particularly thin and shallow. 
Having heard Romero play eloquently on better pianos many times, this reviewer 
has no doubt that the Kawai was at fault. 
</P>
<P>
Violist Cynthia Phelps, who was the San Diego Symphony's acting principal 
violist several seasons back, served up Johann Hummel's Viola Fantasy with 
predictable verve and a burnished sonority. At age 10, Hummel was a pupil of 
Mozart, and in this Fantasy he quotes an aria from his teacher's opera "Don 
Giovanni." Phelps imparted a sure sense of direction to an otherwise rambling 
bauble. 
</P>
<P>
As it made clear in last week's opening concert, the festival orchestra took 
its task seriously. The response to Atherton's meticulously detailed A Major 
Symphony was both solid and stylish, although the horn players besmirched their 
colleagues' precise intonation and clean phrasing. Atherton opened the program 
with a rare Haydn morsel, the Overture to "L'infedelta Delusa." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mainly Mozart Festival continues with a chamber concert at the Old Globe 
Theatre at 7 tonight.

GORBACHEV SEES CLOSER RELATIONS AS SUMMIT ENDS;

<P>
SUPERPOWERS: LEADERS TAKE MODERATE APPROACHES TO THE EXPLOSIVE ISSUES OF 
LITHUANIA AND GERMANY.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev ended four days of 
meetings on a trumpet note of conciliation and cooperation Sunday, resolved to 
increase the pace of summitry and to conclude a treaty before the year is out 
cutting conventional arms in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
And, seemingly determined not just to avoid confrontation but to help each 
other with mutual problems, Bush and Gorbachev in a joint news conference 
Sunday took notably moderate approaches to the two most explosive issues now 
dividing the superpowers -- freedom for Lithuania and the future of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Both leaders emphasized what they described as an increasingly trusting and 
effective personal relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere and the results of this meeting make it possible for us to 
speak really of a new phase of cooperation," Gorbachev said. "I believe that 
this transition is both the result and a factor for further changes that affect 
all countries." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet president said that his relationship with Bush is rooted in personal 
impressions he formed of the then-vice president during the Reagan 
Administration. "Mr. Bush and I met each other a bit earlier, before finding 
ourselves in this position together," Gorbachev said. "And during my contacts 
with him I felt -- and it was during my first visit here, in 1987 -- that this 
is the kind of person to do business with, to build our relations with." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Bush said: "We've moved a long, long way from the depths of the 
Cold War" to achieve a "dramatic" improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations. "The 
more this reform and openness takes place, the more compatible the relationship 
becomes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On the issue of reducing non-nuclear arms in Europe, Gorbachev said: "We have 
agreed to make sure that we will complete the Vienna talks this year and sign 
an agreement on conventional arms at a European summit by the end of this year. 
. . . Not everything depends on us, but this is our position. We want to 
achieve that." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier a stalemate had developed in the negotiations, but on Saturday, U.S. 
and Soviet officials said in interviews that negotiators had broken the 
deadlock even though serious unresolved issues remain. 
</P>
<P>
The treaty to slash the level of troops and weapons in Europe is being 
negotiated in Vienna by representatives of the 16 North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization members and seven Warsaw Pact nations. While much work remains to 
be done on the treaty, and those nations -- as well as 12 other members of the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe -- must approve the final 
document, Gorbachev expressed optimism that the pact will be achieved in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Seemingly determined not just to avoid confrontation but to help each other 
with mutual problems, Bush and Gorbachev in their news conference took notably 
moderate approaches to the two most explosive issues now dividing the 
superpowers -- freedom for Lithuania and the future of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that while the United States remains concerned about Soviet sanctions 
against the break-away republic, the question of trade concessions for Moscow 
-- a politically critical issue for Gorbachev -- is formally linked only to 
liberalization of Soviet emigration policy, not to Lithuanian independence. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives had pressed the Administration to take a tough line on the issue 
with Gorbachev at the summit. 
</P>
<P>
But on Sunday, when a reporter pointed out that six weeks ago Bush had 
suggested that his patience with the Soviets' handling of Lithuania was nearing 
an end, the President said he did not recall putting it that way and added that 
he and Gorbachev had had "some good discussions on the issue." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev pledged to resolve the Lithuanian issue. "We are going to do it 
ourselves," he declared. "With full responsibility, I wish to declare here 
(and) now for all of you to know that we are anxious to see this issue resolved 
in such a way as everybody's interests would be taken into account and within 
the constitution's framework." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet constitution guarantees the right of secession but only after a 
lengthy legal process. 
</P>
<P>
If Bush sidestepped confrontation on trade and Lithuania, Gorbachev returned 
the favor on a reunified Germany. Without minimizing Soviet concern about a 
resurgent Germany, he refrained from repeating the relatively strident 
statements he has sometimes made on the question of German membership in NATO. 
</P>
<P>
He expressed willingness to work toward a "mutually acceptable solution" to the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Bush, who insists that a united Germany should be in NATO, said 
Gorbachev is "in full agreement" with him that the issue is a matter for the 
Germans themselves to decide under the Helsinki Final Act negotiated in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
The Helsinki Final Act declared that Europe's postwar borders are permanent, 
called for more East-West cooperation on security and committed each signatory 
nation to guaranteeing a broad range of human rights. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Bush 
and his advisers viewed Gorbachev's statement that Germany could determine to 
which alliance it would belong as a significant development. However, hearing 
such a commitment from the Soviet leader and seeing it translated into action, 
they said, are two different things. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hopeful this reflects some movement in the Soviet position," a senior 
Administration official said. "But we'll have to wait to see." 
</P>
<P>
At Sunday's press conference, Gorbachev suggested that a transition period 
would be necessary before a united Germany gains full independence. And he 
offered a low-key reminder that if Moscow's concerns are ignored, it may 
reassess its commitment to arms reductions in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the second closed-door meeting between Bush and Gorbachev on Thursday 
afternoon, during a discussion of a united Germany's role in Europe, that the 
suggestion arose to deal with the issue in terms of the Helsinki Final Act, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush brought up the subject, saying that the 35-nation Helsinki agreement 
commits the signatories, which include the United States and the Soviet Union, 
to a declaration that nations could choose their own alliance memberships. 
Gorbachev, the Administration official said, told Bush that he agreed with that 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
But while officials took heart in this approach, they said that a more 
important indication of Gorbachev's position will be the approach the Soviets 
take in the so-called two-plus-four talks on German unification by the major 
World War II Allies -- the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France, 
along with East and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to see if the Soviet position is evolving," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's reading of Gorbachev's apparent acceptance of this view 
prompted what one official described as "a big debate" among Bush's advisers 
during the summit. In the end, they decided that "the important thing here is 
(that) this is the first time we've heard it from Gorbachev." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who declared the Cold War over at the end of their first superpower 
summit in Malta last December, called the Washington summit "an event of 
enormous importance, both for our bilateral relations and in the context of 
world politics." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that "the constructive spirit of these days, the spirit of 
responsibility in which we discussed all questions, has made our success 
possible, and that's really important because that has a stabilizing effect on 
the entire international situation. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In that optimistic spirit, the two leaders disclosed at the wrap-up press 
conference that they have agreed to schedule summits on a regular, perhaps 
annual, basis. 
</P>
<P>
While flying aboard the Marine One helicopter to Camp David, Md., for their 
Saturday meetings, the two men looked down at the Virginia suburbs just beyond 
the nation's capital. Bush talked to Gorbachev about private ownership of 
homes, bank loans "and how the system works," said Marlin Fitzwater, the White 
House press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Later, at a dinner at Laurel Lodge, the dining hall at Camp David, "Gorbachev 
got quite emotional" in delivering a toast to Bush, Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet president earlier in the day tried his hand at horseshoes, a sport 
he was said to have played in the Soviet Union, and scored a ringer on his 
first toss. Later the horseshoe was mounted and was presented to him at the 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev responded, according to Fitzwater, by saying: "I hope this means good 
luck on your house. I hope it brings good luck to your people and good luck to 
my people." 
</P>
<P>
"They had a very good interaction," Fitzwater said. "The two guys are very much 
alike. When they debate across a table they see a mirror image," he said, 
describing them both as "very aggressive" in their styles of discussion, ready 
to challenge each other about the basis of their arguments. 
</P>
<P>
"They even have a similar sense of humor," Fitzwater said. "They make fun of 
things. They tease each other." 
</P>
<P>
In a small concluding sign of their closer tactical relationship, when 
Gorbachev finished his lengthy answer on Lithuania, he held up his arm and -- 
like a press conference veteran -- looked at his watch to indicate the press 
conference had lasted the scheduled hour. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev then glanced at Bush. The President picked up the cue instantly and 
ended the session. Turning to Gorbachev, Bush said, "Well done, well done." 
</P>
<P>
From Washington, Gorbachev flew to Minneapolis, where he appealed, as he had 
several times over the past few days, for global support of his embattled 
internal reform programs. 
</P>
<P>
He sketched his view of the alternatives for an audience of Minneapolis 
business leaders: "Does America want to see a Soviet Union that lacks 
confidence, that is unstable, that is in turmoil," he asked, or "one full of 
life, working with the entire global civilization, integrated into that 
civilization." 
</P>
<P>
The agreements that Bush struck with Gorbachev during the summit were not the 
final word. The trade agreement, in particular, must go before Congress, where 
there is significant resistance to lowering tariffs while the Soviet Union 
continues its embargo of Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told 
NBC News that congressional sentiment against Bush's negotiating strategy "has 
been stirred up even more with this decision by President Bush to unlink or 
de-link the trade agreement from the Lithuanian situation." 
</P>
<P>
"The question is, is Congress going to vote for the trade agreement without 
Lithuania?" he said, noting that the terms agreed to by Bush and Gorbachev are 
executive agreements, not treaties, and so would require only a majority vote 
in both houses of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, said that Gorbachev appeared to have "improvised a good 
bit" in his closing remarks.

Hundreds of students at Beijing University staged a bold anti-government 
protest early today, the anniversary of last year's bloody crackdown on 
pro-democracy demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after midnight, the crowd of students marched through the campus 
shouting anti-government slogans despite the pleas of a Communist Party 
official to return to their dormitories, witnesses said. About 200 of the 
students then gathered to listen to speeches calling for democratic reforms and 
better treatment of intellectuals. 
</P>
<P>
Paramilitary police sealed entry into the suburban campus district shortly 
after the demonstrations began. 
</P>
<P>
But some foreign journalists were already gathered on a public street running 
outside one edge of campus, where graduate students had thrown bottles and 
rocks from windows late Sunday evening. Some were thrown at police, who 
initially left the area. 
</P>
<P>
By 1 a.m. today, only about eight foreigners remained at this spot, which by 
then was quiet. Then four or five paramilitary police vehicles arrived. Police 
jumped out and ordered those present to leave. As the foreigners moved quickly 
toward their cars, two were assaulted. Helmeted men carrying semiautomatic 
weapons and pistols beat this reporter's wife, who is Japanese. She sustained a 
severe bruise topped by a four-inch-long red welt on her back. This reporter 
was also knocked to the ground but was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, at the edge of Tian An Men Square, Richard Ellis, a 
photographer for the British news agency Reuters, was assaulted by plainclothes 
officers when he attempted to photograph police harassing a CBS cameraman. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis was pushed to the ground and kicked in the head, suffering a bruise, and 
a man smashed his camera on the concrete, Reuters reported. The CBS cameraman, 
Bradley Simpson, was not beaten, Reuters reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Beijing University protest came exactly one year after army troops shot 
their way into central Beijing to suppress pro-democracy demonstrations, 
killing hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people in crowds that sought to block 
their path. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night's demonstration began about 10:30 p.m., when students in an 
undergraduate dormitory began setting off firecrackers and throwing beer 
bottles out of windows. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking bottles in public is a brazen act of political protest in China, 
because the Chinese word for "small bottle" -- xiaoping -- sounds like the 
given name of senior leader Deng Xiaoping. During last year's demonstrations, 
protesters sometimes broke bottles to show their dissatisfaction with Deng. 
</P>
<P>
The bottle-throwing then was taken up by many people in the graduate student 
dormitories near the edge of campus. Some students also began singing 
"Internationale." This socialist anthem, learned by all Chinese as 
schoolchildren, calls on slaves to rise up against their oppressors. Students 
last year, without changing any words, turned it against their rulers as an 
anthem of the protest movement. 
</P>
<P>
Around midnight, Lin Yanzhi, head of the university's Communist Party 
organization, was booed by students when he urged them to return to their 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of students then marched around campus, shouting slogans against the 
government, including calls for Premier Li Peng to step down. Li and Deng are 
the two leaders most widely blamed for ordering army troops to shoot their way 
into Beijing last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Go ahead and shoot us," some students shouted, according to a report by United 
Press International. "Rise up. Rise up. Beijing University, have no fear." 
</P>
<P>
About 200 students then gathered in an area where anti-government posters were 
put up during last year's demonstrations, and where political rallies were 
sometimes held. One man gave a speech calling for direct election of members of 
China's National People's Congress, or Parliament, which is now selected 
through an indirect process tightly controlled by the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
According to a witness, he also called for factories to be turned over to the 
control of workers, for peasants to have control of their land and for greater 
respect for intellectuals. Two men, apparently plainclothes police officers, 
attempted to grab the man but were initially blocked by students, the witness 
said. They soon made a second attempt and many students stood and crowded 
around, blocking the witness's view. Later, word spread on campus that the man 
had been detained, but this could not be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Security forces briefly detained about a dozen foreign correspondents as they 
left the campus area and forced them to line up against a wall, the Associated 
Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Guns were in our faces," said an American reporter, speaking with AP on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
ABC News in New York sent a telegram to the Chinese ambassador to the United 
States protesting "the unprovoked physical attack" and detention of the 
network's Beijing bureau chief and a camera operator by university guards. 
</P>
<P>
A West German reporter in the campus area said police struck her with an 
electric truncheon, a device often called a cattle prod. 
</P>
<P>
By 2 a.m., nearly all students had returned to their dormitory rooms and the 
campus was quiet. 
</P>
<P>
Security was tight throughout the city Sunday, with scattered truckloads of 
paramilitary police cruising the streets during the day. By late evening, 
checkpoints were in place at major intersections. 
</P>
<P>
The main part of Tian An Men Square, center of last year's protests, was closed 
to the public, but pedestrians were allowed to walk along the perimeter of the 
square. 
</P>
<P>
Here, there were several incidents of individual protest and arrests. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning, a middle-aged man who appeared to be a worker, approached a 
Canadian Broadcasting Co. television crew in front of the great gate of Tian An 
Men and tried to display a poster that declared: "To all the world's 
journalists, we report that a new philosophy has been invented." 
</P>
<P>
Within seconds, he was grabbed by uniformed police officers. 
</P>
<P>
One woman was dragged off after she approached a West German television crew at 
the square. 
</P>
<P>
In the evening, as lightning bolts lit the Beijing sky, another man stood at 
the edge of the square for about 25 minutes, his hands folded in prayer. 
Finally, plainclothes police grabbed him, United Press International reported. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you doing?" a paramilitary police officer yelled, while plainclothes 
officers held the man. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm praying," the man replied in a clear voice, UPI reported. "Can't a man 
pray in peace?" 
</P>
<P>
The man was questioned, his identity papers were checked, and then he was taken 
away.

GORBACHEV THREATENS HALT IN EXODUS OF SOVIET JEWS

<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Sunday that Moscow may suspend its 
relaxed emigration policy and once again prevent Jews from leaving the country 
unless Israel provides guarantees that Soviet citizens will not be settled in 
the occupied West Bank or Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Talking to a joint press conference at the conclusion of their Washington 
summit, Gorbachev and President Bush both called on the Israeli government to 
end Jewish settlement in the predominantly Arab territories that Israel has 
occupied since the 1967 Middle East War. But Gorbachev took the issue a step 
further by linking emigration and settlements. 
</P>
<P>
"Either -- after these meetings and exchanges with the President of the United 
States of America on this particular issue -- our concern will be heeded in 
Israel and they will make certain conclusions, or else we must give further 
thought to it in terms of what we can do with issuing permits for exit," 
Gorbachev said through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, addressing the issue before Gorbachev dropped his bombshell, said that 
the United States opposes West Bank and Gaza settlements and will "try to 
persuade the government of Israel that it is counterproductive to go forward 
with additional settlements in these territories." 
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, the government of caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir 
rejected the call for ending its policy of encouraging Jewish settlement in the 
occupied territories. However, a spokesman said that very few Soviet Jews have 
settled in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and that Gorbachev should not be 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said he is coming under increasing pressure from Arab governments to 
keep Soviet Jews from settling in the West Bank and Gaza. He said that one 
response might be "to postpone issuing permits for exit." 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of guarantees can we issue so that those who want to leave, those 
who have chosen Israel as their place of residence, those who leave from the 
Soviet Union, should not be resettled in occupied territories?" he added. 
</P>
<P>
It was Gorbachev's first public suggestion that Moscow might end about two 
years of relatively unfettered emigration of Soviet Jews. However, Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III said later that Soviet officials raised the issue with 
him in private last month when he visited Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said that the U.S. government supports "unconditional" emigration of Jews 
and other Soviet citizens, although it continues to oppose Jewish settlement in 
the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
If the Soviet Union did choke off Jewish emigration, the United States would 
surely withhold the most-favored-nation trade status that Moscow long has 
sought. Bush and Gorbachev signed a new trade agreement Friday that will not go 
into effect until the Soviet legislature passes a new law guaranteeing the 
freedom of emigration, which Gorbachev now says may be curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
The National Conference on Soviet Jewry immediately issued a statement calling 
on Bush to insist on continued liberal emigration as a condition of improved 
U.S.-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot accept the Soviet President's upping the ante regarding conditions 
for free Jewish emigration, and we urgently remind President Bush that his 
agreement to the condition set down today by the Soviet leader would be a 
flagrant debasement by the United States of (human rights)," the conference 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government said that only a few hundred Soviet Jews -- less than 
0.5% of the total -- have chosen to live in West Bank and Gaza settlements. In 
similar statements issued in Jerusalem and by the embassy in Washington, the 
government accused Arab states of using that small number "as an excuse to try 
to stop (all) Soviet Jewish emigration." 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli figures for settlement in the occupied territories do not include 
persons living in the eastern suburbs of Jerusalem on land annexed by Israel 
after the 1967 war. By some estimates, as many as 10% of the total number of 
Soviet immigrants live in formerly Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the United States nor the Soviet Union have officially recognized the 
annexation of East Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a well-defined policy," Avi Pazner, Shamir's spokesman, said in 
Jerusalem. "We do not send (Soviet Jews) and do not encourage them to settle in 
the territories. We leave them complete freedom of choice. It's a free country. 
We will make a special effort to explain to Mr. Gorbachev that this is not a 
problem. It is an illusion." 
</P>
<P>
About 40,000 Soviet citizens have moved to Israel since the beginning of this 
year. The number of Jews allowed to emigrate has been increasing steadily since 
Moscow first eased the restrictions in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet immigration is expected to pick up steam this summer as transit through 
Finland and Poland expands. Officials in Israel estimate that 20,000 newcomers 
will arrive monthly starting in July. Upwards of 150,000 are expected to settle 
in Israel by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 70,000 Israelis live in the occupied territories. The Shamir government 
recently approved at least four new settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. In 
January, Shamir told members of his Likud Party that the occupied land was 
needed to make room for the expected wave of Soviet immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
In response to Arab pressure, Moscow earlier suspended plans for direct flights 
to Israel, requiring emigrants to change planes in third countries. 
</P>

'GORBY! GORBY!' CHANT HIS FANS IN MINNEAPOLIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

MINNEAPOLIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a cold, dreary Sunday, the leader of the Soviet Union flew to the Great 
Plains for the sort of warm, hearty welcome that he no longer gets at home. 
</P>
<P>
Greeted by the orchestral music of Shostakovich at the airport, the sound of 
ringing bells at the governor's mansion and chants of "Gorby! Gorby!" at nearly 
all points in between, Mikhail S. Gorbachev proved that while he may be a bust 
in St. Petersburg, he's still boffo in St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
"We're excited to have you here, and the whole state is excited," Gov. Rudy 
Perpich told Gorbachev as he stepped down the stairs from his airplane. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Gorbachev's customized Ilyushin jet with the hammer and sickle flag 
painted high on its tail had left Washington's Andrews Air Force Base, "Gorby 
fever" had seized the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
Back home in Moscow or Leningrad -- which was known as St. Petersburg in the 
pre-revolutionary days when it served as the czarist capital -- Gorbachev's 
political stock has been dropping in tandem with the production figures for the 
Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
But it was different here. "You're a great man! You're a great man!" two young 
college students shouted to Gorbachev as he did one of his by-now signature 
impromptu walks outside his motorcade. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev left Minnesotans with only one disappointment. At his request, he 
originally had been scheduled to make a visit to a true bit of Midwestern 
Americana: a tour of the Brand family dairy farm 20 miles south of St. Paul. 
But the Soviet leader fell so far behind on his schedule that he had to cancel 
the visit. 
</P>
<P>
But this could not rob the day of its demonstration of unabashed enthusiasm for 
Gorbachev. Even the dissenters -- Baltic nationalists, Eritrean separatists, 
Vietnamese patriots -- seemed good-natured in their dissent. 
</P>
<P>
As he left a luncheon at the governor's mansion, Gorbachev, wearing a black 
raincoat and a gray fedora to guard him from the drizzle and temperatures 
hovering below 50, stopped to talk to an 11-year-old boy, Brandon Peterson. 
Speaking through a translator, he asked, "What grade are you in?" 
</P>
<P>
"Sixth," the boy replied. 
</P>
<P>
"That's as old as my granddaughter," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
He then stepped into his long black Zil limousine and proceeded on a motorcade 
through the streets of St. Paul and Minneapolis. The Soviet leader twice 
stopped the motorcade so he could clamber out of the Zil and shake hands with 
eager, cheering Minnesotans. 
</P>
<P>
At one stop, as Gorbachev held his hands out to a throng of approximately 80 
onlookers, a U.S. official murmured: "He ought to run for office here." 
</P>
<P>
Two admirers handed Raisa Gorbachev a sign that featured a heart and the 
message: "We love Mikhail (and) Raisa Gorbachev." The Soviet first lady waved 
the sign at the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesotans offered other encouraging words on the placards they held along the 
motorcade route: "Go Glasnost," "President Gorbachev, Keep Hope Alive" and 
"We're With You, Gorby." One that may have defied translation was the sign 
lauding "Mr. Gorbachev: A Cool Dude." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev found the largest crowd, several thousand Minnesotans, waiting along 
the driveway to the state Capitol in St. Paul. A large minority were 
Baltic-American nationalists waving Lithuanian, Estonian and Latvian flags. 
</P>
<P>
While waiting, the Baltic-Americans tried to inspire the crowd with a chant, 
"Negotiations. No occupations." 
</P>
<P>
But a group of young university students drowned out the chant with a 
well-known chant from a beer commercial, "Tastes great. Less filling." Even the 
Baltic-Americans laughed. 
</P>
<P>
One Minnesotan in the crowd told his wife: "He's an amazing charmer. Not 
folksy, but you respect him. He's quite a guy." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the region, residents planned their day around the Gorbachev visit. 
Road crews rose early Sunday morning, braving a chill and driving rain to line 
15 miles of Interstate 35 from the airport through downtown with shining new 
bright orange plastic highway cones to mark off Gorbachev's motorcade route. 
</P>
<P>
Portable highway signs that normally flash messages like "Traffic Delay" and 
"Construction Next 10 Miles" were reprogrammed to display "Welcome President 
Gorbachev" in English and Russian. 
</P>
<P>
The obvious purpose of the Soviet leader's visit here, as well as his next stop 
in San Francisco, where Gorbachev was to arrive about 10:30 p.m. PDT, was a 
combination of trade and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an opportunity for him to get out and see the United States," said 
Jack F. Matlock, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow. He noted that during 
Gorbachev's previous two summit trips to the United States, the Soviet leader 
saw only Washington and New York. 
</P>
<P>
The visit also gave Gorbachev an opportunity to meet with Midwestern business 
leaders, from both agribusiness and high technology, in an afternoon conference 
in Minneapolis. Calling for investment, Gorbachev assured his listeners: "You 
will not lose your money in the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev underscored that point at his final stop here, a visit to the Control 
Data Corp. plant, where he tried out a computer terminal. Control Data has been 
exporting mainframe computers to the Soviets since 1968. It was one of the 
first U.S. firms to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The cancellation of the visit to the Brand farm did not surprise American 
officials. For days, they had been saying that his schedule was too crowded. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't visit a man's farm in a few minutes. A farmer wants to show you his 
pigs, his chickens and so forth, and rightfully so," said U.S. Assistant Chief 
of Protocol William F. Black. 
</P>
<P>
As a consolation, officials announced that Richard and Cecilia Brand, who own 
the farm, would be at the airport to shake hands with Gorbachev before he left 
town for San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The Brands and about two dozen of their relatives showed up at the airport to 
say goodby to the Gorbachavs. As Richard and Cecilia chatted with the 
Gorbachevs, some of the relatives kept taking photos of the scene at the side 
of the departing plane. A few minutes later, Brand told a reporter, "I can't 
begin to tell you how disappointed I am." 
</P>
<P>
There is little doubt that the trip had another special dividend for Gorbachev 
beyond trade and tourism: It gave a politician who has been through a rough 
period a chance to renew himself in the unaccustomed warmth of friendly crowds. 
</P>
<P>
At the airport, before Gorbachev arrived, security was tight, with U.S. Marine 
guards sternly warning reporters against venturing outside the designated press 
area. "If you stray, you will be shot. They will take you out," a security 
agent, who declined to identify himself, announced at one point. 
</P>
<P>
But such excessive precautions relaxed within minutes of Gorbachev's arrival, 
as he stopped his 42-car motorcade and took a 10- to 15-minute stroll down a 
street in downtown Minneapolis before walking up a red-carpeted path into the 
governor's mansion complex. 
</P>
<P>
Arm-in-arm with his wife, Raisa, Gorbachev looked like an American political 
candidate in his blue pinstripe suit and red tie. The Soviet leader left aside 
an overcoat as he crossed repeatedly from one side of the street to the other. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd included a group of about 40 demonstrators who were protesting Soviet 
policy in Afghanistan and Azerbaijan. Some who identified themselves as 
Minnesota Muslims for Peace and Justice in the World, passed out green leaflets 
charging: "Soviet genocide against Muslims continues." 
</P>
<P>
At the airport in Minneapolis, Gorbachev was met by a series of Minnesota 
leaders. Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale approached the U.S. 
ambassador, Matlock, and quietly asked him what to make of the recent election 
of Boris N. Yeltsin as president of the Russian republic. "They (Gorbachev and 
Yeltsin) are going to have to work together," Matlock said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Raisa Gorbachev joined her husband for most of the day's activities, 
she left the conference with business leaders to follow a brief program of her 
own at the end of the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
En route to the south Minneapolis home of what had been billed as a typical 
American family, the Soviet first lady decided to stop at two typical American 
stores -- Pepito's Mexican delicatessen and the Snyder drug store. At the drug 
store, the Soviet leader's wife questioned Carey Kilbo, the merchandise 
manager, about pay, working conditions and the ingredients in some of the 
products. 
</P>
<P>
She asked, for example, why one nail polish cost more than another. Kilbo 
explained that the expensive nail polish stays on longer.

GUARD PATROLS IN MIDWEST AS WINDS, TWISTERS KILL 10

A funnel cloud was reported in Indiana on Sunday, the second day that 
Midwestern states were raked by severe weather. 
</P>
<P>
The National Guard on Sunday patrolled areas of southern Indiana hit hardest 
overnight by tornadoes that left 10 people dead and hundreds injured in five 
states. 
</P>
<P>
In Indiana, Illinois, Ohio and Kentucky, homes were sucked from their 
foundations, tractor-trailers were blown from highways and countless utility 
poles were toppled late Saturday and early Sunday, cutting off electrical 
service to thousands of homes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight people were killed in Indiana and one in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday high winds at a campground in a state park in south-central Wisconsin 
toppled a tree onto a tent, killing one woman and injuring another, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service said a funnel cloud was seen near Lafayette, Ind., 
Sunday afternoon as thunderstorms and high winds continued to plague the state. 
The severe weather Sunday uprooted trees, downed power lines and was blamed for 
an 18-vehicle accident near South Bend. No serious injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Indiana National Guard moved into the hardest-hit towns in the southern 
part of the state Sunday to prevent looting and provide medical assistance 
after Gov. Evan Bayh declared an emergency Saturday night. Officials said it 
was the worst outbreak of tornadoes in Indiana since April, 1974, when 48 
deaths were reported. 
</P>
<P>
The weather service said 44 tornadoes moved through Indiana on Saturday night, 
sparing only the northwestern part of the state. The twisters touched down at 
least 50 times, said Jerome Hauer, director of the State Emergency Management 
Agency. More than 200 were injured in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Severe thunderstorms also spawned 22 tornadoes in Illinois and 14 in Kentucky 
on Saturday night and early Sunday, the weather service said. 
</P>
<P>
Six people were injured in Kentucky when the twisters roared through the state, 
causing more than $1 million in damage to about 30 homes, authorities said. 
Some mobile homes in Trimble County were thrown into a road by high winds, and 
mobile homes in other areas were destroyed.

ONCE BURNED: Judging from his annual financial disclosure report, Senate 
Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) is still smarting from the firestorm of 
controversy he sparked among Jews earlier this year by suggesting that at least 
$330 million in U.S. foreign aid could be shifted from Israel to Eastern 
Europe, Panama and the drug-fighting countries in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
In a special cover letter attached to his 1989 report, Dole emphasized that a 
$2,000 honorarium he received from the National U.S.-Arab Chamber of Commerce 
did not go into his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, the money never even touched his hands. "No honorarium from 
this organization was accepted," he wrote, "but was donated instead directly to 
charity by the sponsoring organization." 
</P>
<P>
Dole reported no honorariums from pro-Israel groups. 
</P>
<P>
FOOD FOR THOUGHT: Also in the quest for honorariums last year, Rep. Charles 
Hatcher (D-Ga.) may have set a new record for the largest number of fees 
received by a member of Congress in a single day. On June 19, 1989, Hatcher 
took in 19 honorariums ranging in size from $150 to $1,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
Total receipts: $4,400. 
</P>
<P>
Just reading the list of Hatcher's benefactors on that day could inspire a 
healthy appetite. They include the California Pear Growers, California Bean 
Growers, California Beet Growers, California Apricot Growers, the Prune 
Bargaining Assn., California Kiwi Fruit Commission and California Grape and 
Tree Fruit League. 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher's administrative assistant, Krysta Harden, explained that the groups 
got together and invited Hatcher to talk with them at a joint meeting in 
Sacramento shortly after he was appointed chairman of an Agriculture 
subcommittee that holds sway over the domestic marketing of these fruits. 
</P>
<P>
HOUSE CALLS: Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) was only 31 when he was 
elected to the California Assembly in 1963. Now, his son Peter, 30, seeks to 
follow in his father's footsteps -- by running for a seat in the Maryland House 
of Delegates. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Beilenson, a Baltimore physician, is challenging three incumbent 
Democrats in the September primary. With three seats open, the three biggest 
vote-getters will be nominated. In the heavily Democratic district, winning the 
nomination is tantamount to election. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson, who would be the only physician in the Maryland Legislature, is 
running on a slogan: "Baltimore needs a doctor in the House." 
</P>
<P>
His father has advised him to go door to door, as he did in his own first 
Assembly race. Beyond that, the younger Beilenson, a father of three himself, 
said: "His biggest help is that he and mom baby-sit our kids so my wife can 
join me campaigning." 
</P>
<P>
OOPS! Although most members of Congress rely on their staffs or their 
accountants to fill out the annual financial disclosure report, Sen. Jesse 
Helms (R-N.C.) clearly does it himself. 
</P>
<P>
On a page provided for them to list their "liabilities" -- mortgages, personal 
loans and other debts -- there was a large ink blot. Something had clearly been 
inked out. 
</P>
<P>
And underneath, in hand-printed capital letters, was this notation: "Oops! 
Wrong page."

AMERICAN ALBUM: LUXURY HOUSES CAUSE STIR IN HOME OF THE ELK; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPERS SAY THEIR PLAN TAKES PAINS TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE ANIMALS. SOME 
ENVIRONMENTALISTS HAVE DOUBTS.

SNOWMASS VILLAGE, Colo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is calving season here in the Colorado Rockies, that annual window in time 
when the pregnant elk that roam the mountains surrounding this ski town split 
from their herd for three weeks to give birth. 
</P>
<P>
Amateur naturalist Dan Kitchen waits all year for this moment. The 
self-employed window washer recently crouched for hours in the scrub oak and 
pinon pine before finally spotting a newborn calf toddling along in the 
moonglow behind its dun-colored mother. 
</P>
<P>
But now Kitchen and fellow environmentalists in the Roaring Fork Valley are 
uneasy. Actor Michael Douglas -- the latest in a flock of rich and famous folk 
to invest in this resort area -- wants to build a luxury subdivision on 6,500 
acres he owns 10 minutes from the Snowmass ski slopes. 
</P>
<P>
Among Southern California conservationists, the actor's project might seem a 
godsend: Douglas and his Houston partner, Niel Morgan, plan to scatter just 31 
homes amid the aspens, spruce fir and sage that carpet their land. The smallest 
lot in Wildcat Ranch would be 44 acres, the largest, 390 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Only trouble is, the scenic property is home to 125 elk and is used as a 
migration route, breeding area and calving ground by as many as 500 more of the 
animals. Elk -- magnificent creatures that were hunted to near extinction by 
miners around the turn of the century -- have an almost sacred place in the 
region's history. "There has been so much development on the elk's historic 
habitat that Wildcat Ranch is one of the last undisturbed refuges they have 
left," said Kitchen, 38, whose fight against the development is backed by the 
local Sierra Club chapter. "Elk are very timid. . . . You just can't keep 
squeezing them into smaller and smaller spaces." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, a frequent visitor to Snowmass who plans to build a vacation home of 
his own on the site, was out of the country and unavailable for comment. But 
the actor's representatives in Colorado say he has taken pains to create a 
project that will allow humans and elk to coexist in harmony. 
</P>
<P>
"The concept here is very unique -- to permit homeowners to live in a wildlife 
preserve, not a real estate development," said Bill Hegbert, whose Snowmass 
firm is marketing the $1-million to $3-million lots. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Pitkin County commissioners have given the project their blessing. 
In February, the development was approved in concept, but the layout of the 
homes could shift after a biologist completes a study of its impacts. As 
commission Chairman Herschel Ross sees it, Douglas' plan is the best deal local 
officials can hope to cut for the land, a stunning tract of hollows, meadows 
and ridges that is by far the largest remaining private parcel in Pitkin 
County. Several previous owners -- among them, Commerce Secretary Robert A. 
Mosbacher, who sold the land to Douglas for a reported $17 million last year -- 
have proposed developments of far higher densities. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the best solution from a wildlife standpoint would be no 
development," Commissioner Wayne Ethridge said. "But let's face it, this is 
private land, and that's not realistic." 
</P>
<P>
With the astronomical real estate prices in the area -- the median home price 
was $937,000 in 1989 -- the county cannot afford to buy Wildcat Ranch. So, 
"while some of the elk are bound to be displaced, we've just got to do our best 
to limit the disturbance," Ethridge said. 
</P>
<P>
By most measures, it would seem the developers have gone to great lengths to do 
just that. For starters, they down-zoned the property dramatically. To 
accommodate the elk, Douglas has left a mile-wide "migration corridor" through 
the project. Critics are skeptical, but proponents say this elk freeway will 
allow the animals to move unhindered through the homes. 
</P>
<P>
Snowmobiles, dogs and fences too high for elk to scale will be banned in 
Wildcat Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing we want to do is lose the elk," said project manager Chuck 
Vidal. "So it's frustrating when our opponents, who seem to be born-again, 
armchair wildlife enthusiasts, suggest otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
Kitchen contends the only way to build without harming the elk is to cluster 
the homes in one section of the property, a solution that is also favored by a 
state biologist. 
</P>
<P>
"If he is truly an environmentalist," Kitchen said referring to Douglas' recent 
roles in an Earth Day television special and a documentary on dolphins, "then 
he'd do the right thing. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Clustering the homes, however, appears to be out of the question. As Vidal put 
it, to sell a lot for $3 million, "You have to make each person feel he and the 
elk are the only ones there."

PROTEST: POLICE ESTIMATE THAT 100,000 MARCHED IN HONG KONG TO DEMONSTRATE

Tens of thousands of people in Hong Kong and other cities outside China rallied 
Sunday in remembrance of those killed when Beijing's troops crushed the 
pro-democracy movement a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We Won't Forget June 4" and "We Are Not Scared," read banners carried by 
marchers in Hong Kong, which reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Police estimated 100,000 people joined in the march, but organizers put the 
figure at more than 200,000. It was the biggest rally in the British colony 
since nearly 1 million people demonstrated last summer in support of China's 
pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
"Only democracy can save China, and we won't back down despite pressure from 
Beijing," said Szeto Wah, chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the 
Patriotic Democratic Movement in China, which staged the protest. 
</P>
<P>
Rallies also were staged in cities across the United States and the world. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Chinese expatriates and other supporters of the pro-democracy 
movement scheduled a protest outside the Chinese Consulate. Another rally at 
the same site was set for today. 
</P>
<P>
A New York City rally drew about 1,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan, organizers set up an altar for victims who died when Chinese troops 
moved against demonstrators in Beijing and other cities last June 3-4, killing 
hundreds, perhaps thousands. 
</P>
<P>
"The June 4 massacre was a historical wound, which we hope can be healed with 
support from people in Taiwan and the mainland," said Wu Sheng-nung, chief 
organizer of the demonstration in Taipei, which drew about 400 Taiwanese. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators in Tokyo gathered in a park with wreaths and banners in Chinese 
and Japanese saying, "Long Live Freedom and Democracy in Tian An Men Square" 
and "The June 4 Massacre Is the World's Shame." About 200 Chinese, many of them 
students, joined in the Tokyo demonstration.

U.S. NAVY OFFICER SLAIN BY MASKED MEN IN PHILIPPINES;

Two masked men fatally stabbed a U.S. Navy lieutenant in his home near the 
Subic Bay Naval Base in an apparent robbery, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials ordered all personnel restricted to the naval base immediately 
after the Saturday night attack, but they lifted the restrictions Sunday after 
determining the killing was not politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
Police identified the stabbing victim as Lt. Richard Brown, 33. No hometown was 
given. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Filipino troops drove through Communist-held neighborhoods in the 
city of Angeles on Saturday near the U.S.-run Clark Air Base in a show of force 
after U.S. troops were restricted to the garrison for security reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Philippine military also warned foreign aid workers to watch for terrorism. 
Five days ago, guerrillas suspected of belonging to the Marxist New People's 
Army kidnaped a Japanese development official on the central island of Negros. 
</P>
<P>
The provincial governor of Negros Occidental province on Sunday threatened 
military action to free the Japanese aid worker unless his abductors make 
contact with authorities soon. 
</P>
<P>
Security has been stepped up around Subic, Clark and four other U.S. bases 
after the killing of three American servicemen in the past month. 
</P>
<P>
In Olongapo, the base town near Subic, police said Brown was having a manicure 
in his apartment when the two assailants forced their way in around 10:45 p.m. 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The assailants, whose faces were covered with T-shirts, locked up three 
Filipino beauticians in a room, threatening to kill them if they resisted, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the suspects fled after ransacking the apartment. The beauticians 
managed to free themselves and found Brown's bloody body in the dining room, 
police said. It was not known how much money or property was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
Communist rebels oppose extension of the lease for U.S. bases, which expires 
next year.

<P>
In the newspaper game, the guy from Izvestia pitched a fast one right down the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
Where Sam Donaldson once stood, trying his best to stump Ronald Reagan on 
prime-time television, Stanislav Kondrashev faced down "Comrade Gorbachev" 
Sunday morning. The political commentator for the Soviet government newspaper 
Izvestia told the Communist Party chief and Soviet president that this 
perestroika business and buddy-buddy summit with George Bush were all well and 
good, but what about Yeltsin? 
</P>
<P>
The stunned silence, particularly among U.S. reporters, gave way to nervous 
laughter. There, in the elegant East Room of the White House, the drama of 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's glasnost was played out live for all to see, including a 
nationwide audience in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the White House had been the setting for a joint press 
conference featuring the President of the United States and the leader of the 
Soviet Union. The two sat side by side for an hour, answering questions from 
the White House press corps, traveling Moscow reporters and the international 
media assembled in Washington for the four-day summit. 
</P>
<P>
As for the hardball question on Boris N. Yeltsin, Gorbachev's maverick nemesis 
who was elected president of the Soviet Union's Russian republic last Tuesday, 
the Soviet president told his questioner: "I don't think you have chosen the 
best place for clarifying our internal problems, but c'est la vie, as they 
say." 
</P>
<P>
With that, he proceeded into a characteristically lengthy response. Gorbachev, 
it seems, has not learned to just say nyet to a microphone. 
</P>
<P>
Nor has he mastered the art of sound bites -- those pithy phrases that invite 
television network headlines. In fact, brevity of any kind is not his forte. At 
the start of the news conference, Bush delivered an opening statement of about 
470 words. Gorbachev stretched his out to 1,250. 
</P>
<P>
There was nothing in the demeanor of the two presidents that indicated this 
East Room press conference was unprecedented. If anything, they displayed the 
ease of all-stars who have opposed each other in the past and may very well do 
so in the future, but who for this game find themselves on the same team. 
</P>
<P>
They sat at a heavy wooden table, with pairs of U.S. and Soviet flags standing 
to each side. They tossed their answers back and forth, first one, then the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
After Bush had tackled a question and follow-up, Gorbachev took the first crack 
at the next question, addressed to both of them. "Let me begin first, in order 
to let President Bush have a little rest," he said playfully. 
</P>
<P>
The questions came in English and Russian -- English from the American 
reporters seated in front of Bush and Russian from the reporters from Izvestia; 
Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, and the New Times weekly Soviet 
magazine. Each president wore a cup-like earpiece through which he received a 
simultaneous translation of the questions and answers. 
</P>
<P>
An attempt at Russian by the Moscow correspondent of The Guardian, the British 
newspaper, led Gorbachev to fiddle with his earpiece, as if in a struggle to 
determine just what language he was hearing. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the question about Yeltsin, there were few surprises in 
the topics raised. 
</P>
<P>
A news agency reporter who frequently asks about the Middle East wanted to 
know: "Why is it that President Gorbachev has shown so much human sympathy for 
the Palestinians while the U.S. vetoes even a U.N. look at their plight under 
military siege?" 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev initially deferred to Bush on that one but then followed Bush's 
answer by saying: "Just a moment, I'd like to respond too." 
</P>
<P>
He went on to drop a minor bombshell, saying that the Soviet Union may once 
again bar Jews from emigrating unless Israel provides guarantees that the new 
arrivals will not be settled in the occupied West Bank or Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Other questions dealt with whether differences over the future of a united 
Germany had been narrowed -- Bush said that he wasn't sure they had been -- and 
with the just-signed U.S.-Soviet trade agreement, among other topics. 
</P>
<P>
The two men wore the sober news conference uniform -- dark business suits -- 
and each put on metal-frame glasses to read his opening statement. Bush took 
notes while Gorbachev spoke. 
</P>
<P>
When the hour had passed, both stood as if to leave but lingered a minute or so 
to answer more questions before retreating down the red carpet of the White 
House's long first-floor hallway.

<P>
Today, on the final day of his American tour, Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev will make one last grand move on the global chessboard by meeting 
here with the president of South Korea, Roh Tae Woo. 
</P>
<P>
Both the economic and political aspects of the meeting with Roh could be of 
crucial importance to the two countries involved. For the Bush Administration, 
which helped arrange the meeting, better relations between the Soviets and the 
South Koreans could offer several major advantages. 
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two nations have been hostile since South Korea's 
creation at the end of World War II. At that time, the Soviet and American 
armies divided the Korean Peninsula between them. As happened in Germany, the 
two occupation zones evolved into two separate countries -- a capitalistic 
south and communistic north. 
</P>
<P>
Relations went from hostile to bitter in the wake of the Korean War, in which 
North Korea's army, backed by the Soviets and Chinese, almost overran the south 
before being pushed back by South Korean and American troops. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last year, however, relations have begun to thaw, with today's meeting 
marking a major step in that warming process. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economics 
</P>
<P>
For South Korea, the Soviet Union offers a potentially huge market for both 
consumer goods and labor. Korean business leaders are hoping to get entree to 
the Soviet economy before their rivals in Japan do. Japanese-Soviet relations 
remain tense because of territory the Soviets seized at the end of the war -- 
land that the Japanese still want back. 
</P>
<P>
For the Soviets, Korea represents a potential source of badly needed, often 
inexpensive, consumer goods and even more badly needed investment capital. One 
major question about today's meeting will be how much aid Roh is prepared to 
offer Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Politics 
</P>
<P>
Roh may be prepared to offer a lot because better relations with the Soviets 
will help him outflank North Korea, whose armies the South Koreans regard as an 
ever-present threat. 
</P>
<P>
For years, North Korea has prospered militarily from the rivalry between the 
Soviets and China, playing one Communist power against the other and extracting 
military aid from both. Good relations between South Korea and the Soviets 
could cut off the flow of Soviet aid to the North Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
For the Soviets, meanwhile, better ties with Korea could help prod the Japanese 
into improving their relations with Moscow to avoid being left behind. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Position 
</P>
<P>
For the Administration, virtually any improvement in Soviet-South Korean 
relations would be a major plus. Korean economic aid could further Washington's 
objective of strengthening Gorbachev's position at home. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, reduced Soviet military aid to North Korea would ease the way 
for a withdrawal of some American troops from Korea -- a move welcome in a time 
of shrinking defense budgets.

GORBACHEV HINTS OF FLEXIBILITY ON A UNITED GERMANY IN NATO; 
</P>
<P>
REUNIFICATION: BUT HE WARNS AGAINST THE IMPOSITION OF ANY SOLUTION OVER HIS 
NATION'S OBJECTIONS.

<P>
Although he again warned against the imposition of any solution over his 
nation's objections, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev hinted Sunday that 
he may be less opposed than previously to a united Germany inside the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's response to questions in the U.S.-Soviet summit's final press 
conference, taken with earlier comments to President Bush, suggest that he is 
coming to accept the inevitability of German membership in the North Atlantic 
alliance, if Soviet security concerns can be allayed. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said in an interview after 
Gorbachev's departure that the Soviets made a new proposal that NATO and the 
Warsaw Pact sign a political agreement that would give East European nations, 
including the Soviet Union, increased assurance against threats from the new 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
With both the Bush Administration and the Soviets struggling to find a way to 
resolve the highly divisive issue, Baker said that the idea, though still very 
vague, is "worth at least exploring and taking a look at. We need to flesh out 
the details of what . . . shape that agreement might have." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States will consult with its allies before deciding how 
to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Some Administration officials urged caution in attaching too much significance 
to Gorbachev's hints indicating a softer stance on Germany -- the chief issue 
addressed at the summit. But most said that they see signs of a concessionary 
step. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hopeful this reflects some movement in the Soviet position," a senior 
Administration official said. "The important thing here is, this is the first 
time we've heard it from Gorbachev." 
</P>
<P>
At the summit-ending press conference at the White House, Bush repeated the 
U.S. and Western position that a unified Germany must remain in NATO. 
Gorbachev, however, did not repeat his opposition when his turn to speak came. 
</P>
<P>
Bush then added that "we are in full agreement that the matter of alliance 
membership is . . . a matter for the Germans to decide" in accordance with the 
Helsinki Final Act, the 1975 agreement signed by the United States, the Soviet 
Union and European nations on European borders and security rights. 
</P>
<P>
Again, Gorbachev did not dispute the statement. The elected leaders of both 
West and East Germany already have said that they and their countrymen want 
their united nation inside NATO. Gorbachev's silence -- and comments Gorbachev 
made to Bush Thursday -- implied a willingness to accept that prospect, U.S. 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, at the press conference, made several other remarks that raised 
hopes of an eventual compromise on the issue of German membership. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke of the need for a "transitional period" of some years during which 
Soviet forces would be withdrawn from East Germany and during which the World 
War II victor nations would give up their residual powers over Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union would support any solution that would "strengthen, not weaken" 
security in Europe, Gorbachev said. And he expressed optimism that a solution 
acceptable to both the United States and the Soviet Union will be found. 
</P>
<P>
But "nobody wants his security diminished," Gorbachev said. As the Soviets 
would be concerned if the United States felt its security threatened, he said, 
so the United States -- with equal desire for global stability -- should be 
concerned about Soviet apprehensions. 
</P>
<P>
"If decisions are made of the kinds that will cause concern to the Soviet 
Union, this would not be beneficial to the Soviet Union," he said. "This would 
not be beneficial to others as well." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader reiterated that his nation would react strongly to any sign 
that its concerns were being disregarded, including perhaps pulling out of arms 
control negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
If such an impasse were reached, "we (the Soviets) should go back and see where 
we are," he said. "What should we be doing with our armed forces, which we are 
both reforming and reducing? What should we do about Vienna (where NATO and the 
Warsaw Pact members are negotiating cuts in conventional forces in Europe)? How 
should we behave there?" 
</P>
<P>
Such a reassessment would "certainly slow things down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But, stressing an optimistic note, he also said: "I believe that a way out will 
be found to mutual satisfaction." He joined Bush in directing that the Vienna 
negotiations be intensified and in pledging to complete a treaty there before 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press," said the Soviet side complained 
that the nine Western moves offered to assuage Moscow's concerns about a 
Germany inside NATO are "not enough." 
</P>
<P>
Those included a Western willingness to consider limits on the military of 
Germany and other nations in a broader conventional forces treaty, speeding up 
of talks on limiting battlefield nuclear weapons in Europe, allowing Soviet 
troops to remain in East German territory for a transition period and helping 
build housing in the Soviet Union for returning Soviet troops. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking further assurances against a possible German threat, he said, the 
Soviets spoke of "the potential for some sort of an agreement between the NATO 
alliance and the Warsaw Pact" that covers other important security points. 
"Maybe it's just some sort of dialogue that begins, or some sort of 
confidence-building measures" between the two alliances, Baker said. The idea 
could bear promise, or "we may find in the final analysis that it has very 
little support on either side," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
THE TWO GERMANYS 
</P>
<P>
New Germany will merge two contrasting nations and political traditions. 
Capitalist West is larger and more prosperous, with twice the area and five 
times the GNP of its formerly Communist neighbor. Both are heavily 
industrialized and include iron, steel and chemicals among top products.

A British double-decker tourist bus taking vacationers home from Spanish 
beaches flipped Sunday on a French highway, killing 11 Britons and injuring 61, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The bus burst a tire on the main north-south highway, swerved into a ditch, 
tumbled onto its side and slid more than 100 yards before coming to rest in a 
wheat field. 
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Office said the bus was carrying 69 passengers, six guides 
and the driver. 
</P>
<P>
The British television network Sky TV reported that many victims were children. 
Most of the tourists were from the Midlands or Liverpool, police said.

EXPERTS VIEW THE SUMMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of the Washington summit, what are the key issues that remain 
unresolved? 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important issue concerns the problems of Germany and the shape of 
European security. 
</P>
<P>
It is not just the question of Germany in NATO; in the rush toward German 
reunification, little thought has been given by either side to the reshaping of 
Europe. It has suddenly dawned on the Soviet leadership that they're faced with 
a situation in which the new Germany will emerge in the next decade as the 
dominant power in Eastern Europe and probably Western Europe as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Among the summit meetings with Gorbachev, this has probably been the most 
productive. But neither side is really prepared to think about what kind of a 
security structure is feasible. Both will have to settle for interim, 
transitional solutions." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Shulman 
</P>
<P>
Professor emeritus of political science, Columbia University 
</P>
<P>
"The most dicey issues that lie ahead may have to do with the breakup of a 
Soviet Union armed to the teeth with nuclear weapons. However, I'm not sure 
that this situation is susceptible to resolution through the leaders' own 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"This summit has sort of brought old-fashioned summitry to a new plateau. In 
the past the most important issue was avoiding nuclear war; therefore, meetings 
of presidential minds were crucial. But the world the leaders face and the 
problems that loom -- especially the potential breakup of the USSR and the 
reunification of Germany -- may be less susceptible to their influence. 
Although this summit is historic, it may be that this kind of summitry itself 
is less relevant to the problems of the age."

'GOOD COP' BUSH CRAFTS TRADE PACT; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMIC TIES: HE REFUSES TO LINK LITHUANIA AND MOST-FAVORED STATUS FOR 
SOVIETS. NOW CONGRESS CAN PLAY 'BAD COP.'

President Bush, by retreating from the idea that trade relations with the 
Soviet Union should be closely linked to Moscow's actions in Lithuania, risked 
a quarrel with Congress but avoided setting a potentially dangerous precedent: 
tying future U.S. policies to the tortuous struggle that lies ahead between the 
Kremlin and its 15 restive republics. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks, Bush aides had warned that the Kremlin's economic embargo of 
Lithuania, imposed to force the Baltic republic to suspend its declaration of 
independence, "shadowed . . . our entire economic relationship," in the words 
of one official. 
</P>
<P>
But on Friday, Bush went ahead and signed a trade agreement with Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, without any apparent assurances that the 
embargo would be lifted. And on Sunday, Bush said that -- as far as his 
official policy is concerned, at least -- the only obstacle standing in the way 
of most-favored-nation trade status for the Soviet Union is not Lithuania, but 
the completion of a Soviet law to permit free emigration. 
</P>
<P>
"The linkage is (with) the emigration, and that's it," Bush said at his joint 
news conference with Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Mandelbaum, a Soviet expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in New 
York, praised Bush for "de-linking" Lithuania and the trade agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"He's dodged a bullet on that one," Mandelbaum said. "The issue had the 
potential to become a huge policy nightmare. If you link trade policy or some 
other policy to what happens in the Soviet Union on the nationalities issue, 
you've made your policy hostage to a long and bloody struggle." 
</P>
<P>
If Bush had formally linked the trade agreement to Lithuania's independence, 
Mandelbaum explained, he would have set a precedent that would have demanded 
similar action whenever Moscow came into conflict with any of its 15 republics 
-- a number of which are already talking of independence. 
</P>
<P>
The President insisted that his action did not signal any lessening of U.S. 
concern over continued Soviet rule in the three Baltic states, which have 
demanded independence. But he said that the issue will remain "one of the 
thorns in the side of an overall relationship" -- not a specific obstacle to 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Secretary of State James A. Baker III reminded reporters 
that, as long as the Lithuanian impasse persists, Congress is still unlikely to 
grant Moscow the next, more important step on trade: most-favored-nation 
status. "This trade agreement has no effect whatsoever until it is approved by 
the Congress," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
As far as the question of Lithuania is concerned, Bush and his aides were 
enjoying a chance to have the issue both ways. 
</P>
<P>
In dealing with Gorbachev, his new partner in world affairs, the President 
could point out that he is taking some short-term political heat in signing a 
trade agreement that the Soviet leader desperately wanted. Yet Bush could rely 
on Congress to stand firm against any further movement on trade until there is 
progress on the Baltic issue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good cop, bad cop," explained Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), author of 
a Senate resolution demanding an end to the Soviet embargo. Bush has the luxury 
of playing the diplomatic good cop; Congress is only too happy to play the 
scowling bad cop. 
</P>
<P>
The President's men are also trying to avoid trampling on Gorbachev's dignity 
over an issue that has become a very public test of the Soviet president's 
ability to lead a disintegrating nation. White House Chief of Staff John H. 
Sununu, who was once considered a hard-line conservative, argued on Sunday that 
Bush's new semi-soft line is the best way to give Gorbachev room to grant 
independence to the Baltics. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to avoid linking Lithuania and the trade agreement "is a very 
important one in order to get any movement at all that assures, over a 
reasonable period of time, (that) there will be freedom for Lithuania," Sununu 
said on ABC-TV's "This Week with David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in his private talks with Bush, Gorbachev assured the President that he 
believes he can get peaceful negotiations started with Lithuania within the 
next few weeks. The two presidents reached an "understanding" over the issue, a 
White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
Even Lithuania's president, Vytautas Landsbergis, stopped short of criticizing 
Bush for signing the trade agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not as concerned with the treaty as we are with the stance the United 
States is taking toward the (economic) sanctions," Landsbergis said on NBC-TV's 
"Sunday Today." "If Gorbachev gets the opinion that he is able to continue 
these sanctions, that will be a bad thing." 
</P>
<P>
But Baltic-American leaders still declared themselves upset. "I thought 
President Bush would stand up for our rights," said John Jekabsons, a 
Latvian-American who is an official of the Baltic Alliance in Oakland. "Now we 
have to look to Congress to make the point on trade."

A former accounting clerk with the legislative analyst's office and two other 
Sacramento residents have been arrested on charges they defrauded the state out 
of $119,000. The attorney general's office said the three concocted an 
elaborate plot to forge state checks and bill the state for airline tickets for 
trips that were not taken. 
</P>
<P>
Charged with conspiracy to embezzle public funds and tax violations are Diana 
Stuller, 31, the former legislative analyst's office employee; Willie Cabrera, 
39, a former employee of Davis Travel Service, and Patricia Rommel, 32, 
Stuller's sister. Agents said Stuller and Cabrera are accused of illegally 
charging the analyst's office for more than $28,000 worth of airline tickets. 
Stuller also is charged with forging state checks totaling $86,445.

A youth enrolled in a VisionQuest program featuring a wagon train that traveled 
from Arizona to California has drowned while trying to escape, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
John Vincent Garrison, 18, of Stockton, drowned in the Grant Line Canal north 
of Tracy, a San Joaquin County sheriff's spokesman said. Garrison and two other 
youths were attempting to swim the canal to escape authorities when he went 
under. The spokesman said VisionQuest supervisors tracked the boys and when 
they were confronted, the boys apparently decided to swim across the 
75-yard-wide canal. The boys who survived, a 16-year-old from Imperial County, 
and a 17-year-old from Stockton, were placed in Juvenile Hall.

Chunks of concrete plummeted from a bridge onto an interstate highway 75 feet 
below Sunday, damaging at least 20 vehicles and injuring three motorists. 
</P>
<P>
"A rock came out of the sky, bounced off our hood and smashed the windshield," 
said motorist Laura Nizankiewicz. 
</P>
<P>
"There was glass all over the car. My sister got a piece in her eye, and our 
arms were covered with little slivers." 
</P>
<P>
State Trooper W. Hughes said 20 vehicles received damage to hoods, roofs, 
windshields and bumpers as they passed on Interstate 376 under the city-owned 
bridge about 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
At least three people were injured, Hughes said. Two people were treated at the 
scene, and one woman was in stable condition at Presbyterian-University 
Hospital in Pittsburgh, he said. 
</P>

An advisory panel will recommend to Congress next month the use of foreign aid 
to curtail illegal immigration from parts of Mexico, Central America and the 
Caribbean, according to a New York Times report. The 12-member Commission for 
the Study of International Migration and Cooperative Economic Development, 
headed by Diego Asencio, a former ambassador to Brazil and Colombia, concluded 
that some U.S. trade policies, such as import quotas, had the unintended effect 
of retarding foreign economic growth and encouraging illegal immigration. The 
panel's report will also call for a free-trade agreement between the United 
States and Mexico such as the one signed in 1988 between the United States and 
Canada.

THE DROUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
RECLAIMED WATER MAY BE ANSWER FOR THIRSTY FIELDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As water supplies shrink, Ventura County officials have begun looking at a 
virtual sea of reclaimed water to float them out of the drought. 
</P>
<P>
At least four water-reclamation projects are under review. They could supply a 
steady stream of treated waste water to nurture farmers' fields and keep golf 
courses and parks from turning brown. 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that reclaimed water projects could supply Ventura County with 
up to 37,000 acre-feet of water a year, which is 9% of the county's total 
annual demand. 
</P>
<P>
"People are very aware of the drought and the significant impact reclaimed 
water has on keeping public places green without having to give something up to 
do it," said David Burkhardt, assistant manager for the Ventura County Regional 
Sanitation District. 
</P>
<P>
Already, waste water that once was discharged by local sewage plants into the 
oceans and streams is being put to an increasing number of uses. 
</P>
<P>
In Lake Sherwood, the Triunfo County Sanitation District sells 6,000 acre-feet 
of treated waste water each year from the Tapia Wastewater Reclamation Facility 
to nearby golf courses. An acre-foot is equivalent to about 326,000 gallons of 
water, enough to supply a family of four for a year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 10 years, the city of Ventura has been recycling 820 acre-feet of 
waste water annually to irrigate two city golf courses and parks near the 
treatment plant. And in Camarillo, the city has for the past 10 years provided 
a portion of its waste water to Smith's Ranch, a 400-acre vegetable farm that 
grows crops used in processed foods. 
</P>
<P>
Additional water reclamation projects planned in Thousand Oaks, Moorpark and 
the Oak Park-North Ranch area could supply millions of gallons more water each 
day, Burkhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Oak Park-North Ranch facility, reclaimed water would 
completely replace the potable water used to irrigate the golf course. And in 
Moorpark, Ventura County Waterworks District No. 1 is polling 60 agricultural 
customers to determine what the demand for water will be, manager Reddy Pakala 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But reclaimed water will never completely replace water intended for drinking 
and farming. Because of health concerns, reclaimed water, even if it is 
subjected to rigorous treatment to remove all the bacterial impurities, is 
restricted for use only on certain crops. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, even farmers allowed to use it have not been enthusiastic about 
reclaimed water supplies, citing health concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"The big thing about reclaimed water is health," said Dave Pommer, who manages 
the 900-acre lemon orchard owned by U.T.T. Development. Pommer also is a board 
member of the Assn. of California Water Agencies and the Ventura County Farm 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can clear up the health issue, I'm sure farmers will use it," Pommer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tertiary treatment removes most of the impurities and bacteria in sewage. But 
it leaves in some of the nitrates that would actually be beneficial to farmers 
who use fertilizers for their crops, said Bob Quinn, an engineer for the county 
Water Resources Department. But some farmers still object to the very idea of 
using waste water, no matter how much it is cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem in expanding the use of treated waste water is the up-front 
costs of building reclamation facilities and installing pipelines to distribute 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
At Lake Sherwood, reclaimed water costs $436 an acre-foot, nearly 50% more than 
the highest prices farmers in Ventura County pay for irrigation water. 
</P>
<P>
"Farmers can't buy water at $436 per acre-foot and stay in business. Nobody 
would be able to buy the crops they grow," Burkhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts believe that, as the cost of imported water rises, reclaimed water 
could become more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest selling point that proponents of reclaimed water make is about the 
availability of the supplies. Households dump the same amount of sewage into 
the sewer system year-round, and reclaimed water can be counted on when other 
supplies are low. 
</P>
<P>
"The supply of reclaimed water is very steady. The number of houses doesn't 
change very fast," Burkhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
There is so much demand on Triunfo's reclaimed water supplies that the agency 
is planning the construction of a reservoir somewhere in the Malibu Creek 
drainage basin to store water for use during periods of high demand. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary studies indicate the dam would cost about $18 million to build and 
would likely require the preparation of an environmental impact report, 
Burkhardt added. 
</P>
<P>
Still, agency officials are looking for a site for the dam and have identified 
at least two in Ventura County. One is near the Ahmanson Ranch and another site 
straddles the Ventura-Los Angeles county line at Donnell Ranch south of Lake 
Sherwood. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a project that would make a lot of water available to customers by 
1995," Burkhardt said.

HIGHWAY CLOSED FOR 12 HOURS AFTER VAN TOPPLES POWER POLE

A toppled electrical pole caused officials to close California 118 -- one of 
Ventura County's main east-west roads -- for 12 hours Sunday, forcing motorists 
to detour nearly nine miles. 
</P>
<P>
A van ran off the road and knocked down the pole at 5:49 a.m., blocking the 
road about a mile west of Moorpark, said Officer David Wighton of the 
California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists were detoured onto Grimes Canyon Road, Broadway, Stockton Road and 
Balcom Canyon Road until 5:49 p.m., when California 118 reopened. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had traffic going by here all day long," said Fauvette Rollyson, who 
lives on Stockton. "Fortunately, this was not a weekday or the trucks would be 
unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Wighton agreed. "On a weekday you get a heavy commuter traffic, but today was 
pretty light," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another Stockton Road resident, Richard Allen, said he counted almost 100 cars 
a minute going in both directions during peak traffic on the detour. "It was 
steady, almost bumper-to-bumper," Allen said, adding that Stockton Road 
normally is seldom used. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, on a weekend, if someone goes by I go out to see who it is," Allen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Sheldon, a spokesman for Southern California Edison Co., said the toppled 
wires were "live" and had to be handled carefully. Then a new pole had to be 
installed and wires restrung before the road could be reopened. 
</P>
<P>
The accident cut power to residents in the immediate area, Sheldon said. 
Rollyson said her home lost power for about 75 minutes, but Allen had no power 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred when Salvador Padilla, 28, of Pomona, driving a Chevrolet 
van west on 118, veered across the opposing lane, left the roadway and hit the 
pole, Wighton said. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla left the scene but was found in Moorpark about 5 1/2 hours later by 
deputies of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, Lt. Kelly McIlvain said. 
He has not been cited, Wighton said.

3 DIE IN CRASH WITH SUSPECTED DRUNK DRIVER 
</P>

<P>
Three women -- all relatives who had immigrated from Mexico -- and a 7-month 
fetus were killed in a collision involving a suspected drunk driver in 
Wilmington, and a fourth woman, also related, was hospitalized in critical 
condition, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities identified the dead women as Veronica Aguilar, 24, who was 
pregnant; Olga Zamora, 18, and Marisela Arias, 19. 
</P>
<P>
Arias' 24-year-old sister, Rosalia, was in critical but stable condition at 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center with a broken arm and internal injuries, friends of 
the family said. The hospital would not comment on her condition. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar's fetus was delivered by Cesarean section three hours after the 
accident, but was stillborn, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar and Zamora were first cousins, and they were also first cousins of the 
Arias sisters, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
Friends are seeking funds to cover burial expenses and Rosalia Arias' medical 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
"They had no life insurance or medical insurance," said Cynthia Estrada, a 
neighbor and friend of the Arias sisters and Zamora, who lived on Hawaiian 
Avenue in a public housing project in Wilmington. "We want to see if we can get 
some funds or donations from the public to cover the burial and medical costs." 
</P>
<P>
She said she will open an account at a Bank of America Branch in Wilmington 
today to accept donations. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred late Saturday as the women were driving Aguilar, who had 
been visiting the Ariases and Zamora, back to her home in Wilmington, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A suspected drunk driver ran a red light at Pacific Coast Highway and Neptune 
Avenue at 11:30 p.m., slamming into the women's 1984 Ford Escort, police said. 
Hubaldo Calderon, 21, of Wilmington was arrested and booked for investigation 
of murder and drunk driving.

THE DROUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
FARMERS LET TREES DIE AS WATER COSTS RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
High in the hills above Moorpark, the drought is drinking up the water under 
the Leavens family ranch. 
</P>
<P>
In a normal season, sprinklers would tap into three wells 550 feet below the 
surface to water 500 acres of citrus and avocado groves. 
</P>
<P>
But in the past four years, the water level has dropped about 100 feet to the 
lowest level in the 67-year history of the farm, manager Link Leavens said. 
Pumping costs have risen about 15%. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought last year was bad," said Leavens, a veteran of 16 years of farming. 
But this year has been "progressively worse. . . . It's the worst year that we 
collectively have experienced as a farming community." 
</P>
<P>
In an average year, cities and farmers in Ventura County remove 35,000 acre 
feet more water from the ground than is replaced by rainfall. But as the 
drought has worsened, that deficit has more than doubled, to 80,000 acre feet 
(an acre foot serves a family of four for a year). 
</P>
<P>
While there is still an estimated 540-year supply in the Fox Canyon aquifer, 
the largest water basin in the county, stretching from Moorpark to the Pacific 
Ocean, farmers are facing mounting hardships in a county where water quality is 
slowly eroding and the cost of bringing it to the surface is rising, Leavens 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The most immediate effects of the drought may be seen in the supermarket as 
increasing farm operating costs result in higher produce prices. And for some 
farmers, who are allowing avocado trees to die rather than pay more to water 
them, the drought has already become painful. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the inconvenience and threats of water cutbacks to agriculture, most 
farmers have not yet been hard hit by water problems. But they are worried 
about what will happen if the drought continues. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's hoping for the best, hoping that the crisis won't come to 
fruition," said Larry Rose, who heads the California Avocado Society. 
</P>
<P>
But many are doing more than hoping. They are girding for future dry years by 
investing in expensive water-stingy irrigation systems and planning to scale 
back on marginal crops, or cutting down some orchards. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 acres of land are devoted to agriculture in Ventura County, 
where 1,752 farms depend on local underground water sources to irrigate crops. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers make up the largest group of water users in the county, consuming 68% 
of the 407,000 acre feet used each year. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers such as Leavens must drill deeper and deeper to find water. But if 
their subterranean wells are close to the coast on the Oxnard Plain, there is 
another problem: too little fresh water and too much seawater. 
</P>
<P>
The Fox Canyon aquifer covers a 185-square-mile area, but the continued mining 
of the aquifer by cities and farmers during dry years is causing the water 
level to drop. Seawater has swept into a 22.8-square-mile area, a zone that 
increases as the water level declines. 
</P>
<P>
To address this problem, officials at the Groundwater Management Agency have 
proposed a 25% cutback in pumping until the year 2015. Farmers who use too much 
water could face stiff penalties under the proposal, which is now being 
reviewed by agency lawyers in advance of a meeting June 22 to consider adopting 
the measure, said John Turner, staff hydrologist for the GMA. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, farmers in the eastern part of the county who depend on imported 
water also are being forced to cut back by 10%, said Reddy Pakala, manager of 
the Ventura County Waterworks District No. 1. Pakala said that due to the 
statewide drought, the Metropolitan Water District has warned its distributors 
of an impending curtailment. 
</P>
<P>
Cutbacks also are being ordered in the western part of the county, where a 
resolution by the Casitas Municipal Water District asks agricultural customers 
to conserve by about 20%. 
</P>
<P>
If voluntary measures fail to achieve that goal, the district will be forced to 
impose mandatory measures next year, said Dick Barnett, engineering department 
manager for Casitas. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers say they waste little of the water they use. 
</P>
<P>
"Farmers are cutting back because there is a water shortage," Ventura County 
Farm Bureau President Don Reeder said. "Everybody I've seen is cooperating in 
saving water one way or the other." 
</P>
<P>
The owner of Pro-Ag, a land management firm that operates 100 farms in Ventura 
County, Reeder said other farmers have spent thousands of dollars on irrigation 
systems to regulate water use. Some have switched to low-flow sprinklers to 
avoid overwatering, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Others have changed crop rotation schedules or left land temporarily untilled 
in hopes of more rainfall later in the year, Reeder said. As an extreme 
measure, growers have stopped growing crops that use a lot of water. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Fricke, an avocado grower in Moorpark, said he has cut down trees that 
bear a low-value fruit, the thin-skinned bacon avocado, and some trees that 
bear the higher-priced Haas avocados. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those measures, the price of water has forced him to pinch pennies. He 
says it is unlikely he will see a return on his investment. 
</P>
<P>
"This year the fruit's not even going to pay for the water, let alone the 
irrigation or maintenance," Fricke said. 
</P>
<P>
Along Grimes Canyon Road and Hitch Boulevard west of Moorpark, other avocado 
growers have shut off the water to some orchards where imported water is so 
expensive that it amounts to half the costs of growing the crop, Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
Leaves on trees that took decades to cultivate are turning brown because of 
increasing salt content in the soil from irrigation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had enough rain to leach it out of the soils," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
Costs are prohibitive for some farmers to upgrade their irrigation systems, 
said Dave Pommer, who manages a 900-acre lemon orchard in Oxnard for the U.T.T. 
Development Co., which still uses an old-fashioned furrow irrigation system. 
Installing a new system would cost about $1,300 an acre, Pommer said, and "we 
might never see our money back." 
</P>
<P>
Farmers are doing more than buying new irrigation systems and cutting back on 
production. They have gone back to school. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance at seminars on irrigation and conservation has climbed, said Lee 
Waddle, an irrigation specialist with the Ventura County Resource Conservation 
District. 
</P>
<P>
During the past year and a half, a mobile irrigation laboratory operated by the 
district has succeeded in getting 177 farmers to volunteer to review their 
practices and has encouraged them to use more scientific methods of evaluating 
weather conditions and crops, Waddle said. 
</P>
<P>
Some farmers have not been eager to face the music, Waddle said. 
</P>
<P>
However, "as time goes on, I can see there's more acceptance of the mobile 
lab," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If voluntary conservation measures fail, water officials said, it is because 
farmers have no reason to cut back while water is still available and pumping 
costs are still relatively low, compared to the costs of imported water. 
</P>
<P>
Pumping costs range from $60 to $160 per acre foot, while farmers pay up to 
$325 per acre foot for imported water. Homeowners, by comparison, pay an 
average of twice as much as farmers for the percentage of water they use, about 
22% of the entire amount used in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"That's probably what the biggest problem is, there isn't any economic 
pressure" on farmers, said Frank Brommenschenkel, president of the Assn. of 
Water Agencies in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying ag can't improve their efficiency any more than local 
homeowners can't improve their efficiency," Brommenschenkel said. 
</P>
<P>
Some farmers say they are doing all they can to conserve water. 
</P>
<P>
"If you cut down 40%, in essence you've lost your crop," Pommer said. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers' greatest fear is that the current drought cycle might continue. 
Ventura County is in the middle of a multi-year drought that some think could 
last into the middle of the decade, farm adviser Bob Brendler said. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of rain has not forced the Leavens farm out of business, but dwindling 
water supplies might force Leavens to allow the least productive fields to die. 
</P>
<P>
"We're mining a resource that's a finite resource," Leavens said. "We're 
banking on borrowed time."

COUNCIL TO CONSIDER SCULPTURE PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Paula City Council will consider a proposal tonight by artist Helle 
Scharling to create a six-foot-tall sculpture with fruit as its theme for the 
city's Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
Scharling chose fruit as the theme for the piece because the fruit industry is 
so prominent in the area, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula once called itself the Citrus Capital of the World and the logo 
still appears on some business cards carried by council members. 
</P>
<P>
Scharling said she hopes to finance the project with a California Arts Council 
grant, matched by funds from private industry. She said local businesses and 
the Santa Paula Chamber of Commerce have reacted positively to presentations of 
the idea. 
</P>
<P>
A 10-year resident of Ventura, Scharling left her native Denmark to learn 
mosaic work in Italy. Later, she studied art history in Germany and murals in 
Mexico City. Scharling has created "public art" in several countries. "It's a 
way for an artist to be less isolated," she said recently. 
</P>
<P>
One of Scharling's mosaics covers a wall and part of the floor in the lobby of 
the Ray D. Prueter Library in Port Hueneme. She is designing another for the 
Wright Library on Day Road in Ventura with a grant from the Ventura Arts 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
The council will also consider tonight a request by the Mexican American 
Chamber of Commerce to hold its third annual Fourth of July Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Food and game booths are part of the event set to begin at noon in Harding Park 
near the Santa Paula Boys and Girls Club. One block of Harvard Boulevard would 
be closed to traffic during the festival, which will feature a fireworks 
display beginning at 8 p.m. JANET BERGAMO

TEMPORARY HOMES SOUGHT FOR CHILDREN OF FAMILIES IN CRISIS

<TEXT>
<P>
Volunteers are being sought to provide temporary housing, known as "cool 
homes," for children of families undergoing counseling for serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a cooling off for both parents and kids," said Brenda Benedict, crisis 
services outreach coordinator for Interface, a nonprofit family services group. 
</P>
<P>
"If tempers are still high or if kids are afraid to go home, we offer them a 
safe place to stay." 
</P>
<P>
Interface now has 10 cool homes and is looking for about 10 more. Interface 
reimburses families for the children's expenses during the four- to five-day 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
Home volunteers are licensed in the same manner as foster families, and undergo 
a lengthy application process. "We . . . go out and look at the arrangement," 
Benedict said. KIM KASH

HELLS ANGEL LECTURES ON NEWS ETHICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just before his talk the other night, George Christie Jr. noted that he had 
given a speech only once before: when he testified at his 
solicitation-of-murder trial three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Christie, president of the Ventura chapter of the Hells Angels motorcycle club, 
was acquitted of soliciting the murder of a government informant. The not 
guilty verdict was due in part to his ability to persuade a jury to trust him 
and ignore preconceived notions about the motorcycle gang. 
</P>
<P>
But Saturday night, Christie had the audience on his side even before he 
stepped to the microphone and addressed the Ventura College Press Club. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 aspiring journalists and professors cheered him when he spoke about 
the power of the media and the need for morality in journalism. They laughed 
when he talked about his run-ins with the law. They nodded in agreement when he 
warned about the dangers of sloppy journalism. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not the monsters that some people have created us to be," he said of 
the Hells Angels. "Preconceived images are certainly a problem that I've had to 
deal with." 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the college invites an editor or reporter to speak at the annual 
awards banquet, said Linda Wolf, office manager of the college newspaper. But 
this year, staff members decided they wanted someone who had been on the 
receiving end of news reports. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to hear about reality," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Christie has gotten both positive and negative coverage. The positive press 
came when he raised $3,000 from his fellow bikers and ran in the 1984 Olympic 
Torch Relay. The money was eventually directed to the Special Olympics in 
Pottstown, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
But Christie got less favorable headlines in 1987, when he was indicted and 
later acquitted on charges of hiring a hit man to kill an Arizona prison 
inmate. Federal authorities later acknowledged that they had faked the inmate's 
death to entrap Christie. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a black leather vest with the Hells Angels logo emblazoned across the 
back, Christie told his audience at the Doubletree Inn that the Angels had not 
made a conscious decision to improve their image. They did, however, want to be 
more accessible to journalists and the public, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Christie has been interviewed for newspaper articles, by Mike Wallace for "60 
Minutes" and by Regis Philbin for "Live With Regis and Kathie Lee." He said he 
has turned down interviews with "tabloid" television shows, because, they tend 
to exploit misery. 
</P>
<P>
Some journalists have portrayed him as an honest family man, the target of 
harassment by law enforcement officials, he said, while others painted him as 
an outlaw. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, Christie advised the aspiring journalists to be honest with the 
subject of their news reports and to live by their own sense of morality. "If 
you can look yourself in the mirror in the morning," he said, "you should be 
happy with yourself."

DDC DRUG MADE AVAILABLE FOR AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week made Hoffman-La Roche's drug 
DDC available to AIDS patients in a "compassionate use program" designed to 
test the safety of the drug, the pharmaceutical firm and the FDA announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"The most exciting thing about DDC is that it is looking more and more to be 
the drug that DDI was supposed to be," said Dr. Jay Lalezari, co-director to 
the HIV Clinical Research Center at Mt. 
</P>
<P>
Zion Hospital in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know the efficacy, but it looks like it is well-tolerated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based Bristol-Myers has been distributing the experimental drug DDI 
free in a similar compassionate use program to about 8,000 patients who are not 
responding to AZT treatment or cannot tolerate AZT. 
</P>
<P>
The side effects of DDI include nausea, diarrhea and depression, but DDC, which 
stands for dideoxycytidine, has shown few side effects, Lalezari said.

FLAWS IN CARBON-14 DATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The widely used carbon-14 method of determining the age of fossils, rocks and 
ancient human artifacts may be off by as much as 3,500 years, scientists said 
last week. Geologists from Columbia University in New York said the carbon-14 
dating method appears to have significantly underestimated the age of many 
prehistoric objects. 
</P>
<P>
The findings will probably lead to revisions of many important archeological 
and geological dates, such as the first cave paintings and other hallmarks of 
human culture, times of early human migrations and the dates of recent glacial 
advances. For example, the peak of the last Ice Age would shift from 18,000 to 
21,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Carbon-14, a radioactive form of carbon, steadily decays into nitrogen. For 
decades, scientists have determined the age of objects dating back 10,000 to 
40,000 years by looking at the ratio of carbon-14 to nitrogen. 
</P>
<P>
The Columbia team used a new, highly accurate technique based on the decay of 
uranium into thorium to date fossilized coral found near Barbados, and then 
compared those dates to results of carbon-14 dating.

BACKPACKS AND ARM PARALYSIS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hikers who carry around heavy, poorly adjusted backpacks that put pressure on 
their shoulders risk developing a temporary but "frightening," paralysis of 
their arms, a doctor warned last week. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Patrick Rosario said he first noticed a syndrome he called "trekker's 
shoulder" when he was hiking through the Himalayas in Nepal and came across a 
young man who could not move his right arm after a day spent walking down steep 
trails. 
</P>
<P>
"The weakness started soon after he began a moderately steep descent, wearing a 
heavily laden, loosely slung backpack, and it became progressively worse by 
evening," Rosario and Dr. Sylvia Fernandes said in a letter to the New England 
Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Rosario and Fernandes, staff members at Bronx Lebanon Hospital in New York, 
said the man had developed a condition known as "Erb's palsy" in which nerves 
that travel from the neck through the shoulders and into the arms become 
stretched, often resulting in muscle weakness and numbness. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the condition is temporary and clears up without treatment if the 
pressure on the nerves is removed, he said. Rosario said the Himalayan hiker 
got better after a few days of rest and not carrying the backpack.

ORIOLES ARE HOT -- BY AL EAST STANDARDS

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Baltimore Orioles are the hottest team in the American League East. How hot 
are they? They are as hot as room temperature. They are as hot as road warrior 
Mikhail Gorbachev in Minsk. They are as hot, right now, as Alberta, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Let us put it this way, even if the Orioles were going a lot better, nobody 
would want to break them up. 
</P>
<P>
And still, hot enough. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an ugly job," says Orioles relief ace Gregg Olson, "but somebody's got to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
Oh, it's ugly all right. It is no compliment to be the beast of this east. In 
the National Football League, they have parity. In the American League East, it 
is parody. 
</P>
<P>
Let's go to the standings. Since May 18, it looks this way: 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore Orioles 9-7 (-) 
</P>
<P>
Detroit Tigers 8-8 (1) 
</P>
<P>
Toronto Blue Jays 7-9 (2) 
</P>
<P>
Boston Red Sox 7-9 (2) 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland Indians 6-9 (2 1/2) 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee Breweres 6-10 (3) 
</P>
<P>
New York Yankees 5-11 (4) 
</P>
<P>
Since April 9 when the season began, the Orioles, at 23-27, are 3 1/2 games out 
of first place. 
</P>
<P>
To the question, can't anybody here play this game, the right answer is: Not so 
you would notice. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Orioles have not noticed. They knocked off the Yankees Sunday, 4-3, 
when Mickey Tettleton, finally deciding to swing the bat, hit a two-run homer, 
and Olson, who did not have his good stuff, got the save anyway. Did they feel 
hot? Nobody was passing around thermometers. 
</P>
<P>
I took a tour of the triumphant clubhouse and asked the question of the day: 
Who's the hottest team in the East? 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Hickey: "Is this a trick question? Toronto?" 
</P>
<P>
Olson: "Not us." 
</P>
<P>
Randy Milligan: "Not the Orioles. No way." 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton: "Nobody?" 
</P>
<P>
Well, you can't blame them. Nobody thinks the Orioles are actually playing 
well, although they are playing better than they had been. The starting 
pitching is sporadic, and the hitting is the worst in the American League, 
either division. The Orioles' lone star player is in the worst slump of his 
life, and Craig Worthington, last year's clutch RBI man, has one more run 
batted in this season than Bob Melvin, who has yet to get a hit at Baltimore's 
Memorial Stadium. Yeah, these guys are hot, all right. 
</P>
<P>
But, on this road trip, the Orioles are 6-3, heading into Milwaukee Monday for 
a big showdown series with the first-place Brewers. That five of the wins came 
against the Texas Rangers and New York should not matter. Any win is a good 
win. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering how we've played," Tettleton said, "we're in pretty good shape. Of 
course, everyone's in pretty good shape in this division." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone. Say, the managers of the respective teams. They should all have 
unlisted phone numbers. The hottest manager is, of course, Johnny Oates, who 
just lost his job to Frank Robinson. Where is the justice? In Robinson's 
absence, Oates went 2-1, which should win him some votes as Manager of the Year 
and must make him a shoo-in for the Yankees job. Managing the Yankees is, of 
course, a decidedly mixed blessing. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the Bucky Dent watch continues, but I would not exactly plan my 
summer around it. The only way Bucky Dent will not eventually pick up the phone 
to hear he has been fired is if he never picks up the phone -- ever again. 
</P>
<P>
It does not matter who manages the Yankees. They are not going anywhere. There 
was some thought, though, that Toronto, a talented team, ought to breeze 
through this division, before meeting with the Oakland Athletics in the 
playoffs again. The Blue Jays are 27-25. They are the team that always seems to 
need a wake-up call. The Blue Jays got one last year by changing managers in 
midseason. Oates is still available. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles will make do with Robinson (with a 7-6 record in his past 13 games, 
a pretty hot manager himself). He does have one thing going for him, and that 
is Olson, who picked up his 11th save in 11 tries. Even in the East, the 
Orioles would be lost without Olson, who has allowed one run all season. For 
the first time this year, they pitched him 3 2-3 innings over two days, risking 
his valuable arm. He said he did not mind. And that is how Oates got so good. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not in bad shape, you know, considering how the season has gone," Olson 
said. "We're starting to put it together a little. You win a few games in a 
row, and you can make a real move." 
</P>
<P>
You win five in a row, and they probably stop the season in what passes for 
this long, hot summer.

A MARQUEE MATCHUP FOR CITY OF LIGHTS;

TENNIS: AGASSI AND CHANG EARN FOURTH-ROUND VICTORIES AND WILL MEET IN THE 
QUARTERFINALS OF THE FRENCH OPEN.

This just in from the French Open: Andre Agassi versus Michael Chang. 
</P>
<P>
It's the quarterfinals. It's flash versus dash. It's the last two Americans in 
the men's singles field. It's not Boris or Stefan or Ivan or McEnroe, but it's 
certain to be the most interesting match yet at a Grand Slam missing its normal 
array of stars. 
</P>
<P>
Quicker than you can say voila, Agassi made French toast of Jim Courier, 6-7 
(10-8), 6-1, 6-4, 6-0, and rolled through the fourth round on a rainy Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Said Agassi: "I felt strong, I felt confident." 
</P>
<P>
Later Agassi had another clothes encounter with Philippe Chatrier, president of 
the French Tennis Federation. Chatrier wants the French Open to ban colorful 
tennis clothes such as the ones Agassi wears in favor of the traditional whites 
like those worn at Wimbledon. Agassi called the federation members "bozos" when 
Chatrier's plan was announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi pointed out that unlike Wimbledon, there are several advertisements 
around the sides of the courts here. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess when it comes to Chatrier's benefit, tradition goes out the window," 
Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
Out, too, went Javier Sanchez Vicario of Spain, eliminated in the fourth round 
by Chang, whose 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 victory propelled the defending champion into a 
showdown with Agassi, his contemporary in age and nationality, if not style. 
</P>
<P>
"That just makes it all the more fun," Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi had a ball against Courier, who simply got trampled. Agassi, who proved 
he has something in his bag besides clothes, outslugged Courier at his own 
game. 
</P>
<P>
His plan was to stay with the quick-starting Courier at the beginning, then 
wait for his chance. He found it in early in the second set when he broke 
Courier in the second game, then saved four break points to jump ahead, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was in good shape," Agassi said. "After the first set was over, then 
I kicked it into gear." 
</P>
<P>
At last year's French Open, Courier beat Agassi in four sets and hoped for a 
rematch that might propel him in the tournament he has been gearing himself for 
all year. 
</P>
<P>
Courier saved three set points in the first-set tiebreaker, the last when 
Agassi fell down to leave Courier with an open court for a backhand. Another 
backhand winner sent down the line provided Courier with a set point, which he 
cashed in when Agassi sent a backhand into the net. 
</P>
<P>
Courier turned toward the stands and said to Coach Sergio Cruz, "That's one 
set." 
</P>
<P>
That's the only one he got. Agassi, who beat Courier at the Lipton 
International Players Championship in April, said their French Open meeting of 
a year ago was of no consequence. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was a long time ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chang continued searching for last year's magic, a quest that has led him to 
Agassi. Against Sanchez Vicario, Chang led, 5-2, and was serving for the second 
set, but failed to hold serve. 
</P>
<P>
Chang was patient, though, and eliminated the last Sanchez Vicario from the 
tournament. Emilio and Arantxa were eliminated in the first and second rounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just happy to get this one over with," Chang said. "That was one of the 
toughest straight-set matches I've ever had in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Dispatching Agassi is likely to be even more difficult for Chang, who lost 
their only previous encounter, 7-5, 6-3, 6-2, in the fourth round of the 1988 
U. S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, I was just happy to be in the fourth round," Chang said. "Now, the 
situation has changed a little bit. I've had a taste of what it's like to be at 
the top." 
</P>
<P>
Chang, who failed to win a match in three clay court tournaments prior to the 
French Open, said he seems to play harder here. 
</P>
<P>
"You fight extra hard and you don't go out to somebody you shouldn't go out 
to," he said. "Now, the pressure has been taken a little bit off. I can go out 
and play without the mind frame 'You have to win, you have to win.' " 
</P>
<P>
Andres Gomez of Ecuador reached the quarterfinals without having to win. Gomez, 
fourth-seeded, advanced when Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden withdrew because of a 
knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Two other fourth-round matches were held over because of rain: Andrei Chesnokov 
of the Soviet Union against Henri Leconte of France; and Guillermo Perez-Roldan 
of Argentina versus Jonas Svensson of Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Courier said he lost contact with Agassi when he let down in the second set, 
missing the four break points. Chang cannot afford many errors if he wants to 
avoid a similar fate. 
</P>
<P>
"If Andre can play as close to the baseline and not make mistakes, I see him 
winning fairly comfortably," Courier said. "But if Andre gets impatient, it'll 
be a long match. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't be disappointed to lose the way he played," Courier said. "I was 
just hoping he couldn't keep it up. Time after time, he was just greasing the 
baseline." 
</P>
<P>
In Agassi's opinion, he may be tough to beat no matter what. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a bit more explosive than him," Agassi said. "I have more capability to 
hit winners than him. I'm beaten him every time we've played, so I'll go in 
confident."

VICTORY LETS ABBOTT ERASE BITTER MEMORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

ARLINGTON, Tex. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The clubhouse TV set showed Jim Abbott throwing perfect touchdown passes, Jim 
Abbott pitching the U.S. Olympic team to gold-medal glory, Jim Abbott coolly 
performing wondrous athletic feats. By contrast, the Abbott who sat in the 
Angels' clubhouse Sunday watching his filmed image was sweaty and weary, 
evidence of his labors in the hot Texas night. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing came easily for the 22-year-old left-hander, but at least his 
six-inning effort in the Angels' 7-4 victory over the Rangers Sunday was 
appreciated by his manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was heroic," Manager Doug Rader said of Abbott's two-run, 
six-strikeout performance. "He was really tired in the sixth, but he got us in 
an area where we could use Ike (Mark Eichhorn) and Harv (Bryan Harvey). He did 
a real nice job. . . . He was a little wobbly, but he got us through the sixth, 
and that was important to us." 
</P>
<P>
Equally important was Abbott's ability to overcome the disappointment he felt 
last Monday, when he pitched nine shutout innings against Cleveland only to 
lose in the 10th. That defeat lingered until Abbott (3-4) could consign it to 
the heap of learning experiences. 
</P>
<P>
"That last game was kind of hard to swallow," he said. "It took me a couple of 
days. I kept going over and over it. I finally realized that if you pitch like 
that and give your team a chance to win, you have to take some solace in that 
and try to do it again next time." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't pitch as precisely Sunday, but he had more offensive support this 
time. The Angels scored four runs in the first inning against knuckleballer 
Charlie Hough (5-4) with two outs, an outburst highlighted by Dante Bichette's 
bases-clearing bloop double to short right. A two-run home run in the seventh 
by Chili Davis and a 406-foot home run to center by Bichette in the eighth 
allowed Abbott to challenge the Rangers' free-swinging hitters. 
</P>
<P>
"Abbott was cutting that fastball in and off the plate and we couldn't lay off 
it," Ranger Manager Bobby Valentine said. "He's a good pitcher with pretty good 
stuff. . . . We battled back. We had some opportunities but didn't get enough 
on the board." 
</P>
<P>
Texas scored in the first on two singles and a grounder and in the fifth on a 
walk, a force play, a hit batter and a single by Julio Franco, but the Angels 
maintained a safe distance most of the game. Eichhorn was hit hard in the 
seventh as the Rangers cut the Angels' lead to 6-4, but Bichette's home run off 
reliever Brad Arnsberg clinched the Angels' 12th victory in their last 16 games 
and brought them within a game of .500 (25-26) for the fourth time in the last 
week. They also trimmed a game off the A's lead, reducing it to nine games. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a good team win," said Abbott, who had won only one of his previous 
six decisions. "Chili hit a two-out home run and Dante's home run puts us back 
up three runs. I felt like (Saturday) night's loss could have hurt us because 
we knew Oakland had lost and we scored some runs early and we had our ace 
(Chuck Finley) on the mound, but things kind of got away from us. Tonight, by 
the team having such a good game against Charlie Hough, who's having a solid 
year, that puts us back in a positive trend." 
</P>
<P>
Bichette's career-high four RBIs was another positive sign, for several 
reasons. He feared he had given Rader ample reason to bench him after striking 
out four times Friday against Bobby Witt and by going one for four Saturday. 
His home run came after Arnsberg had tried to move him off the plate with a 
fastball up and in. "That was a major-league home run," teammate Dave Winfield 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Proud as Bichette was of his perseverance, he was even more pleased with the 
Angels' persistence and progress over the last month. "We're starting to play 
better and Oakland is starting to slip a little bit," he said. "The quicker we 
get back in it, the better. When we win, we don't have to worry what Oakland 
does. If we keep winning, we're right there." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Results of tests on infielder Donnie Hill's right shoulder showed only a 
slightly strained muscle, and he is scheduled to rest for two days before 
beginning two or three days' rehabilitation. Manager Doug Rader said the club 
will remain short an infielder until Hill can return rather than recalling 
anyone from triple-A Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Rader said shortstop Dick Schofield, playing with Edmonton on rehabilitation, 
is a few days away from being ready and could be in the lineup when the Angels 
return to Anaheim Stadium this weekend. Jack Howell (sprained left knee) is 
eligible to be activated this week and could rejoin the lineup Friday. Mark 
McLemore, on rehabilitation with Edmonton, is still having problems with his 
sprained right wrist and is not expected back soon. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Finley, who lasted only 2 2/3 innings Saturday, told Rader he would be 
available in the bullpen Sunday if needed. Rader laughed. . . . Saturday's game 
was the first in which Chili Davis did not appear. Only first baseman Wally 
Joyner has played in all 50 games. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Gary DiSarcina got his first hit in 26 at-bats, a ground-single to 
center Sunday. That improved his major league statistics to two for 37 (.054). 
Rader said earlier in the week that DiSarcina's woes at the plate stem from an 
old hamstring injury. "After that, he got into some real bad habits," Rader 
said. "It takes a lot of work to get out of bad habits. For every bad swing you 
take, it takes 100 good swings to correct them." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels have no first-round pick in this week's amateur free agent draft, 
having lost it to Montreal for signing Mark Langston. The pick is 24th overall.

MIKE DOWNEY: A TRUE WINNER IS DENIED CHANCE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Well, this Detroit-Portland NBA championship series -- which should attract 
tens of television viewers throughout the country -- should be a good one. 
Forgive me, though, if I don't get too excited about it. It just won't be any 
fun without Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Did you ever pull for an athlete to do well in a big game? Sure you have. 
</P>
<P>
But did you ever root for one particular athlete to succeed in a team sport, no 
matter how successful this athlete might already have been, how much money he 
might already make, how many cheers he might already have heard? 
</P>
<P>
That's the way I felt Sunday about Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
I did not want the Detroit Pistons to eliminate Jordan and the Chicago Bulls 
from the NBA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Because I dislike Detroit? 
</P>
<P>
Not in the least. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, I have no problem with the Pistons. Matter of fact, I am sick to death of 
all the Detroit-bashing that is going on, about what a "cry baby" Bill Laimbeer 
is (as though Kareem Abdul-Jabbar wasn't), or what a "hotdog" Dennis Rodman is 
(as though the Lakers never celebrated a big basket) or what "dirty" players 
the Pistons are (it's always dirty if some other team is doing it). 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Daly's Pistons earned everything they have. Had Isiah Thomas not thrown 
that ball into Larry Bird's hands in 1987, and if Laimbeer hadn't fouled 
Abdul-Jabbar in 1988, the Pistons very well could have won four NBA 
championships in a row. 
</P>
<P>
No, forget the Pistons. I hope they split Portland like a log. 
</P>
<P>
I just can't stop thinking about Michael Jordan for now. 
</P>
<P>
If I have to hear one more time how the one thing that separates Magic Johnson 
from Michael Jordan is that Magic is a proven winner, I am going to throw a 
basketball through somebody's window. 
</P>
<P>
Magic is great, granted. 
</P>
<P>
But do you think it just might have made a teensy-weensy difference to 
Johnson's career that he won all those championships while a teammate of the 
greatest scorer in NBA history? That he fed the ball night after night to one 
of the five greatest players in the history of the sport? 
</P>
<P>
While Magic was out there playing with Abdul-Jabbar, Michael has been out there 
playing with Dave Corzine, Bill Cartwright and Will Perdue. 
</P>
<P>
Give me a break with this "winner" business, will you? 
</P>
<P>
Hey, Magic has always been a champion, you argue. He even won a college 
national championship with Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
Fine. And what was that thing Jordan won with North Carolina -- the national 
spelling bee? 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan cannot help it that the organization that drafted him did not 
happen to have Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jamaal Wilkes, James Worthy, Byron Scott 
and A.C. Green on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson has been surrounded by All-Stars his whole life. Even his 
collegiate lineup had guys like Greg Kelser and Jay Vincent, a couple of 
All-Americans in their own right. 
</P>
<P>
The next-best player in Jordan's camp since coming to Chicago was some nobody 
from nowhere named Scottie Pippen, who turned out to be a truly fine player. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose that's why I was rooting so hard for the Bulls in Sunday's Game 7 of 
the Eastern Conference finals at Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, somebody is bound to come up with an ulterior motive for why I wanted the 
Bulls to win. Remember, if you write for a newspaper, you have to have an 
ulterior motive. That's the law in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that I simply wanted to see Air Jordan get his day in the sun, even 
if he got it indoors. 
</P>
<P>
I am not surprised that Chicago lost, any more than I am surprised that Jordan 
had 31 of the team's 74 points. This home-court thing, after all, means a lot. 
</P>
<P>
Every so often, some pinhead comes up with a novel idea -- like, that the NBA 
playoffs should be played on a neutral court. Oh, sure. Let's play 82 
regular-season games for nothing, why don't we? 
</P>
<P>
An NBA championship series between Portland and Chicago would have been 
entertaining. If you were one of the lucky 20,000 or so who jammed every inch 
of Chicago Stadium in 1977 for a playoff series between Bill Walton's Trail 
Blazers and Jerry Sloan's Bulls, you know the meaning of the word loud. 
Woodstock wasn't that loud. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, well. 
</P>
<P>
We still have this year's NBA Finals to look forward to, with those compelling 
battles between Kevin Duckworth and James Edwards. Ooooh. Makes your mouth 
water just thinking about it, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>
And I know that Michael Jordan is going to have his day, one of these days. He 
just doesn't have to prove that "winner" stuff to me. Jordan is a winner 
already. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, it isn't as though the Chicago Bulls are never going to win an NBA 
championship -- like, oh, you know, the Phoenix Suns.

NEWSWIRE: SOUTHWEST TALKS OF COMBINING WITH BIG EIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Southwest Conference, fearful that Arkansas might leave it to join the 
Southeastern Conference, held a hastily called meeting at the College Football 
Association's annual meeting in Dallas and discussed expansion to 16 or 17 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
SWC officials discussed the "Big Southwest," an alliance with the Big Eight 
Conference, The Dallas Morning News reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
A Big Eight-Southwest Conference alliance could be a lure to keep Texas and 
Texas A&amp;M, if Arkansas decided to leave. The alliance would control two 
bowls, the Orange and the Cotton. 
</P>
<P>
Also at the meeting, CFA coaches called on the NFL to reschedule minicamps and 
scouting combines later to preclude athletes missing class time. The CFA said 
NFL scouts are no longer welcome in film rooms and facilities of the more than 
60 CFA member schools until the league becomes more sensitive to the problem.

MISTER FRISKY IMPROVING, IS NOW ABLE TO EAT

<TEXT>
<P>
Mister Frisky, the beaten favorite in the Kentucky Derby, was said to be 
responding to treatment Sunday and gaining in his battle against a 
life-threatening abscess in his throat. 
</P>
<P>
The colt, who finished third in the Preakness, "is alert and responsive, 
breathes normally and can eat hay and drink water with little difficulty," said 
Dr. Scott E. Palmer, surgeon at the New Jersey Equine Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky lost about 100 pounds because he was unable to eat. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not out of the woods yet, but he's making good progress and we can relax 
a little," Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
The colt was listed in stable condition, responding well to antibiotics, but 
remains in intensive care. Palmer said the abscess was drained and the 
infection does not appear to have spread. The colt was being given medication 
for a slight fever. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Fritz, the horse's veterinarian at Belmont Park, transferred Mister 
Frisky to the clinic Thursday. Fritz said the growth probably interfered with 
Mister Frisky's performance in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
Fritz believes the growth started before the Kentucky Derby. Mister Frisky won 
his first 16 starts, but was beaten by 19 1/4 lengths at Churchill Downs, 
finishing eighth.

Jones has committed to a baseball scholarship at the University of Miami but is 
likely to exchange that commitment for a large bonus.

Atlanta had sought to pick right-handed pitcher Todd Van Poppel of Arlington,

Minivan Seats in Safety Probe: Possible rear-seat defects in some 1986-89 
Chrysler minivans are being investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration as the result of the death of a 2-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
Noah Z. George of Washington County, Pa., died Feb. 11 after the 1987 Voyager 
in which he was riding crashed. He was strapped in a booster seat secured to 
the rear seat by a seat belt. The back seat collapsed and the boy was thrown 35 
feet. A coroner's jury ruled that the seat was "flimsy and poorly constructed 
and is unsafe for public use."

ONE SYMPTOM OF 'MAD COW' DISEASE IS TRADE FRICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KAYE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Mad cow" disease, an enigmatic nervous disorder that has killed thousands of 
cattle in Britain, is causing trade friction in Europe and is threatening the 
$3.7-billion British beef industry. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, West Germany joined France in a ban on British beef imports, citing 
health fears related to the mysterious ailment, whose technical name is bovine 
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). 
</P>
<P>
Concern that the disease can be transmitted to humans has made the subject 
Topic A in the pubs and press of Britain, and has put a serious crimp in 
domestic beef sales. Despite assurances from the British government that the 
beef is safe, consumers and some scientists remain skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
British officials complain that the French and German import ban is a result of 
economic, not health, concerns. The price of British beef is dropping in the 
wake of the "mad cow" scare. Therefore, British officials believe, France and 
West Germany imposed the bans to protect their domestic sales. 
</P>
<P>
"It's totally unjustified and illegal," said Patrick Barrow, spokesman for the 
Meat and Livestock Commission, a trade organization. 
</P>
<P>
France accounted for slightly more than half of Britain's beef exports last 
year, buying 70,000 tons of beef worth $264 million. West Germany bought $50 
million worth last year. 
</P>
<P>
Although other countries have recently placed some restrictions on British beef 
and cattle, the French and German moves were the strongest by far. The United 
States does not import British beef and recently rescinded permits for the 
importation of live cattle. 
</P>
<P>
British officials have been joined by European Community commissioners in 
protesting the French and Germany import ban. 
</P>
<P>
Mad cow disease has been responsible for the deaths of nearly 14,000 cows since 
it was first noticed in the mid-1980s. BSE-infected cows "degenerate very 
quickly," said a spokeswoman from Britain's Ministry of Agriculture. The cows 
become aggressive and then wobbly-legged before dying. 
</P>
<P>
No one is certain what causes the disease, which affects the cow's brain. But 
the prime suspect is tainted cow feed. Some experts believe that cattle 
contracted the disease as a result of eating food contaminated with the remains 
of sheep infected with a BSE-like disease called scrapie. 
</P>
<P>
Although government and industry officials have been concerned for some time, 
mad cow disease did not become a household word until recently. 
</P>
<P>
On May 11, the Ministry of Agriculture revealed that a Siamese cat had died 
from a disease identical to BSE. The press went wild with the story, 
suggesting, in boldface, that if cats can get it, people can too. Panic ensued. 
</P>
<P>
"BSE has been around for six or seven years," said David Lewis of the Meat and 
Livestock Commission. "And until the cat, it hadn't been brought into the 
home." 
</P>
<P>
Beef sales dropped, with surveys showing that about a quarter of British 
households had stopped eating it. Two thousand schools dropped beef from their 
menus. 
</P>
<P>
The government and meat industry fought back. Some regulations were enacted to 
fight the disease, but more overt was the publicity campaign: Princess Anne 
said her family was still eating British beef.

U.S. SAYS JAPAN'S BACKSLIDING MAY THREATEN PACT; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: OFFICIALS SAY TOKYO IS NOT FOLLOWING THROUGH ON PROMISES MADE IN APRIL 
ON THE STRUCTURAL IMPEDIMENTS INITIATIVE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration is becoming increasingly annoyed at Japan for what it 
considers Tokyo's backsliding on promises made in the sweeping Structural 
Impediments Initiative, intended to open Japan's markets and signed by both 
sides on April 5. 
</P>
<P>
Senior officials in several key departments and agencies say Tokyo is not 
following through on some pledges that Japanese negotiators made during the 
talks and is refusing to come forward with details on other agreements that 
they had promised to "flesh out." 
</P>
<P>
They say that, unless Tokyo changes its tune soon, the accord -- which the two 
governments hailed as historic when the interim draft was negotiated -- could 
be in jeopardy. A failure would prove a major embarrassment for the White House 
and possibly provoke Congress' ire, too. 
</P>
<P>
The April 5 document contained pledges by Japan to take a spate of bold new 
actions to open its markets to more foreign imports and businesses, including 
deregulation of Japan's complex goods-distribution system and stepped-up 
enforcement of antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
It promised liberalization of foreign investment regulations in Japan to make 
it easier for foreigners to build plants or take over existing firms. And it 
promised an increase in government spending for infrastructure and public 
works. 
</P>
<P>
Largely because of the promises that Japan made in the accord, the White House 
decided not to brand Tokyo as an unfair trading partner this year, brushing 
aside demands by key lawmakers that it file additional trade complaints that 
could lead to U.S. retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials cautioned then that the pact was only an "interim" report and 
that negotiations would continue in an effort to nail down specifics and come 
up with additional proposals for a final agreement to be completed in mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. negotiators found in a post-accord meeting with their Japanese 
counterparts that Tokyo apparently had no intention of following through with 
some of the promises and had little interest in discussing additional 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the dispute has been referred to the Cabinet level. It may require 
new efforts by President Bush to resolve the dispute in time to avoid a 
squabble at the annual seven-nation economic summit in Houston on July 9. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials concede that some backsliding was expected because 
that has been a traditional Japanese negotiating tactic. But they said Tokyo's 
intransigence has exceeded expectations. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear whether Bush would consider reversing his earlier 
decision not to threaten Japan with new trade sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most egregious issue, in U.S. eyes, has been the refusal of 
Japanese negotiators to set a target for boosting government spending on 
infrastructure. But U.S. negotiators complain that Japan also is declining to 
"flesh out" other promises -- such as giving specifics on how much it will 
increase fines for violating antitrust and anti-competitive laws. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said time is running out for achieving a meaningful final 
report. Negotiators have one more meeting before the June 25 summit.

Keck Divorce Case Request Fails: A Los Angeles Superior Court judge refused to 
grant a preliminary order disqualifying a Los Angeles law firm, Trope &amp; 
Trope, from representing Elizabeth Avery Keck in her divorce proceeding against 
Howard B. Keck Sr., whose father founded Superior Oil Co. 
</P>
<P>
The order was sought in a legal malpractice suit filed by the couple's son, oil 
heir Howard B. Keck Jr., who contended that Trope &amp; Trope, while 
representing his mother, used confidential information it learned while 
representing him for 20 years. The younger Keck fears that his inheritance will 
be diluted if his father loses the divorce case. (Filed April 30, 1990. Case 
No. C759915)

AS 'CONCEPT' STOCKS GO, URCARCO VEERING WRONG WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By ALLAN SLOAN, ALLAN SLOAN is a financial columnist for Newsday in New York. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
If someone you don't know tries to sell you a used car for $6,000, you don't 
just smile, say "thank you" and hand over 6,000 bucks. You're skeptical. You 
want to kick the tires, you want to bargain, you might want to have your own 
mechanic check the car out. 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to shelling out $600 million to buy a used-car company, 
investors seem to be suspending all skepticism. Welcome to the wonderful world 
of Urcarco Inc., the latest example of how Wall Street can go bonkers when it 
sells itself on a "concept stock." 
</P>
<P>
Urcarco, for those of you who aren't trendy, is one of the market's hottest 
stocks. Its stock, which recently sold for about $20, has almost tripled since 
November, when the company sold shares for $7.34 (adjusted for a stock split) 
in its initial public offering. Counting the 5.75 million shares that Urcarco 
sold last week to raise new cash, the company now has 31.4 million outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
So a $20 stock price means the market is valuing Urcarco at more than $600 
million -- 31.4 million times $20. Not exactly chump change. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Urcarco worth all this money? Certainly not anything visible on the 
financial statements. The company, based in Ft. Worth, operates 17 used-car 
lots in Ft. Worth, Houston and Austin, Tex., and owned $84 million of its 
customers' promissory notes as of March 30. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Urcarco's delightful stock symbol -- CARS -- there are no hidden 
assets in this company. No car lots sitting on valuable downtown real estate or 
atop oil fields or diamond mines. No secret stash of antique used cars. 
</P>
<P>
What you are really paying for here is a concept. To wit, the concept that 
Urcarco is bringing professional management to the used-car business. Or, as 
the company's supporters say, "to the $40-billion used-car business." The idea 
is that Urcarco will be to used cars what Toys R Us is to toys: a company that 
will become the dominant factor in a fragmented business. 
</P>
<P>
Good luck. 
</P>
<P>
All it takes is a cursory look at Urcarco's cash flow numbers to see that the 
company has a major problem: The more cars it sells, the more cash it loses. 
This, even though the more cars it sells, the more money it reports as profit. 
</P>
<P>
Reported profits have risen from $248,000 in the year ended June 30, 1988, to 
$2.9 million in 1989 to $10.1 million in the nine months ended March 30. At the 
same time, by my calculations, the company's basic business ran a cash deficit 
of $4.2 million in 1988, $19 million in 1989 and $48.7 million in the nine 
months ended March 30. 
</P>
<P>
Urcarco closes its cash gap by borrowing money or selling new shares. In fact, 
the company is up front about saying that it constantly needs infusions of 
cash. In documents it issued in May as part of last week's stock sale, Urcarco 
says its cash shortfall runs from $6 million to $8 million a month. But after I 
asked some detailed questions about why debt had risen by $10.2 million in 
April, the company conceded that $6 million to $10 million a month is the range 
now. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, last week's stock sale, which produced something over $100 
million after investment banker fees and other expenses, will probably carry 
the company for less than a year. Without that sale, Urcarco would have been 
bumping up against its $45-million bank borrowing limit before summer was over. 
</P>
<P>
The disparity between the glowing reported earnings and the insatiable need for 
cash has attracted short-sellers, one of Wall Street's feared predator species. 
These creatures, who make money if a stock's price falls, borrow shares of the 
target company and sell them, hoping to ultimately replace the borrowed shares 
with stock purchased at a cheaper price. 
</P>
<P>
As you might suspect, I looked into Urcarco at the suggestion of short-sellers. 
However, this article is based on my own research and analysis, plus 
information provided by the company, which answered my questions but didn't 
want to talk while its latest stock offering was pending. 
</P>
<P>
To be blunt about it, there is less to Urcarco than meets the eye. This company 
isn't about selling used cars; it's about trying to collect money from people 
who are going to have trouble paying it. 
</P>
<P>
It's obvious that Urcarco, which runs what it calls "we finance" lots, is 
charging customers more than they would pay elsewhere for the same car; but 
elsewhere, the customers wouldn't be able to buy the car because they lack the 
necessary down payment and credit standing. 
</P>
<P>
Urcarco accepts down payments of 5% to 15%, much less than most other used-car 
dealers. Urcarco lends the customer the balance of the purchase price, will 
finance the insurance and sometimes even give the customer a 30-day loan for 
the sales tax. In return for this generosity, Urcarco charges not only high 
prices, but also the maximum interest rate allowed by the state of Texas: 18% 
to 24% a year. 
</P>
<P>
Forget any question of the morality of selling expensive merchandise to 
marginal buyers -- at least for now. The problem with Urcarco, from an 
investor's point of view, is that you can't figure out if the company is ahead 
or behind. 
</P>
<P>
Most used-car dealers make sure the down payment covers most or all of their 
costs, so whatever the dealer collects on buyers' promissory notes is profit. 
Urcarco pays cash for the cars it buys at wholesale and for its other expenses, 
but it collects almost no cash when it sells cars. Urcarco's real profit, if 
any, comes not when it moves the car off the lot, but when it collects on the 
customer's note. If it collects. 
</P>
<P>
The company argues that it's being financially conservative by assuming that 
the paper it gets from customers is worth only 82 cents on the dollar. The 
company implies that this works out to a repossession rate of about 38% of the 
cars it sells. Is that enough? Who knows? 
</P>
<P>
The company says it doesn't know how the value of the cars on which it holds 
customers' notes compares to the value of the paper. 
</P>
<P>
Urcarco may, in fact, some day become the Toys R Us of used cardom. But until 
(and unless) that happy day dawns, the cash deficit makes the company 
vulnerable. If a stock offering can't be completed, if a lender gets nervous or 
if anything else untoward happens, Urcarco can be in big trouble in almost no 
time at all. If you want to buy this stock -- or any "concept" stock -- for 
more than a short-term trade, you had better go out and kick some tires instead 
of just buying a fancy story.

MARKET BEAT: MARKET WATCH;

<P>
ROCKETING TOWARD 3,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The most appropriate rallying cry on Wall Street now may be "3,000 or Bust!" -- 
because either the bulls know exactly what they're doing, or they're going to 
have a very rude awakening soon. 
</P>
<P>
With a 24.31-point rally Friday to a record 2,900.97 close on the Dow Jones 
industrial average, Wall Street can now focus on the historic 3,000 mark. A key 
ingredient in the fuel mix for this market rocket is the belief that interest 
rates are coming down. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's rally was sparked by the government's report that job creation was 
extremely slow in May, which prompted new recession concerns. Bond yields 
plunged on the news, because bond traders believe it's now inevitable that the 
Federal Reserve will ease credit to reignite the economy. 
</P>
<P>
If you assume that that frame of mind will dominate on Wall Street for the next 
few weeks, it's easy to make a case for a Dow of 3,000 soon. Figure it this 
way: A lot of big investors are still flush with cash, having sat on the 
sidelines in disbelief as the stock and bond markets rallied since April. If 
they buy stocks with that cash, they send the market up directly. If they buy 
bonds, they send interest rates lower, boosting stocks indirectly. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy who's running real money has to feel the pressure now," said John 
Connolly, investment strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street brokerages, which advise many big investors on the proper portfolio 
mix of stocks, bonds and cash (money market investments), may help drive the 
stock rally by changing their recommended mixes further in favor of stocks 
and/or bonds over the next few weeks. Although some brokerages, such as Dean 
Witter, are already super-bullish, others, such as Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; 
Jenrette, are still recommending substantial cash holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Clough, strategist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in Boston, recommends a 
portfolio of 40% stocks, 55% bonds and 5% cash. Yet Clough admits that "my 
heart is probably 50-50 (stocks and bonds)." Why not raise the stock portion 
officially? If 30-year Treasury bond yields fall from about 8.5% now to 8% 
during the next six months, "the Dow would have to go to 3,300 to beat a bond," 
if you're figuring in the bond's interest earnings plus capital gain potential, 
Clough says. He sees less risk in bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Connolly, however, maintains that the best place to be now is in stocks that do 
well in a slow-growth economy, because that's what we have, he says. He sees 
investors continuing to bid shares of drug, retail and beverage companies 
sharply higher, and sees the overall market driving the Dow to a peak of 3,200 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
What could go wrong with the bulls' outlook? Simple: Either interest rates 
don't fall or a recession arrives. On the rate front, the big question is how 
long Wall Street will wait for the Fed to cut. If there's no signal by late 
June, it may be time to reassess stocks' chances of going much higher near 
term, some analysts suggest. Of course, by then the Dow could be well over 
3,000. 
</P>
<P>
As for economic worries, Eric Miller, strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; 
Jenrette, still sees the chance of a recession as 50-50. That's a view that few 
Wall Streeters share; which means it doesn't take much imagination to figure 
out what would happen to stocks if Miller is right and the rest of the Street 
is wrong.

What if the Economy Booms? While many investors are concentrating on the 
business slowdown, economist David Levine at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. in 
New York predicts that the surprise will soon be the start of a dramatic 
rebound. Levine notes that businesses have been liquidating their product 
inventories for six straight months. Historically, such massive liquidations 
almost always have presaged economic booms rather than ended them, he says. 
"Presumably, we've primed the economy for a big pickup," he says, as businesses 
begin restocking shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Levine sees annualized gross national product growth soaring from 2.3% this 
quarter to 4.3% in the third quarter and 5.5% in the fourth. And with that 
growth, he sees interest rates rising again. While on the face of it that 
should be bad for stocks, Levine also says corporate profits should soar with 
the economy, supporting stock prices. He notes that as companies have 
streamlined in recent years, they've gained extraordinary earnings leverage: It 
doesn't take much of an increase in demand to translate into sharply higher 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly: The plunge in L.A. Gear's stock price last week could mean trouble for 
Pacoima-based K Swiss, a rival athletic shoe maker. K Swiss plans to go public 
this month, but investors may balk at paying a high price for the shares if 
they fear something's amiss in the shoe business. . . .

Broad Inc., the Los Angeles-based financial services giant, is running some 
dramatic new ads to hype its SunAmerica trade name, the line under which it 
sells insurance and mutual funds. The ad, a four-page centerfold in the June 11 
issue of Forbes, features an almost blinding photo of a sun, printed on 
heavy-stock glossy paper. It may be only a coincidence that the stock got a big 
lift last week, to $8.75, up $1.125 for the week. Frederick Wise at Bear 
Stearns says Broad remains a cheap stock, hurt by what he says are unwarranted 
fears about its small junk-bond holdings.

GREASE BUILDUP CAUSES SEWAGE SPILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Household grease clogged two eight-inch sewage pipes and caused two raw sewage 
spills in Oxnard last month, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In the first of the two spills, about 2,000 gallons of sewage seeped onto city 
streets May 21 at Santa Lucia Avenue and Balsam Street, said Robert Montgomery, 
environmental control supervisor for the Oxnard sewage treatment plant on 
Perkins Road at Ormond Beach. 
</P>
<P>
That spill washed into a storm drain that eventually empties into the ocean at 
Ormond Beach, but was treated with chlorine and probably dried up before 
reaching the ocean, Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
On May 22, about 1,000 gallons of raw sewage seeped out of a manhole and onto 
the street in the 3000 block of Via Marina Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The sewage was treated with chlorine and washed into a storm drain that empties 
into Mandalay Bay. Tests of the water revealed bacteria counts 160 times the 
state's standard for safe water for swimming, but no warning notices were 
posted, Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery said he believed that the spill did not pose a health hazard because 
that area of Mandalay Bay is not used for swimming. He said he contacted the 
county Environmental Health Department, which decides whether to post beaches, 
and "this time they didn't." 
</P>
<P>
The bacteria dissipated within 24 hours, he said. JOANNA M. MILLER

HOWARD ROSENBERG: FEAR, LOATHING AND CONFUSION IN POLITICAL TV AD BLITZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By HOWARD ROSENBERG

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My wife is running for president of our homeowners' association. So we put 
together a little ad campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 We're all friends and neighbors here, God-fearing folks and good Americans 
living decent lives in Norman Rockwell country. We like and respect each other. 
We chat across the back fences, have cozy block parties, borrow eggs and sugar 
from the family next door and car pool together. So the ad campaign is nice and 
clean. It's not much, really. Strictly small time. Hardly worth mentioning. A 
modest flier under every door. It begins like this: 
</P>
<P>
 MY OPPONENT IS A MURDERER!!! 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It's a bad dream, another nightmare from which I awaken in a sweat! 
</P>
<P>
I'm having them regularly, the result of overexposure to the orgy of political 
ads threading TV in advance of Tuesday's statewide election. 
</P>
<P>
Take the Democratic gubernatorial chase, for example. Pretty please! 
</P>
<P>
The other night, I watched Dianne Feinstein's ad showing deputies carrying a 
covered body up a hillside, you know, the tasteful spot that stops just short 
of charging that Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp is personal friends with mass 
murderers. Then I watched Van de Kamp's ad with Ralph Nader accusing Feinstein 
of being a "Republican in Democratic clothing." 
</P>
<P>
The ads produce back-to-back nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
Dream 1: Not only was Van de Kamp soft on the Hillside Strangler case while 
district attorney of Los Angeles County in 1981, he and Nader are Hillside 
Stranglers. 
</P>
<P>
Dream 2: The candidate on the screen attacking Van de Kamp is Bart Simpson in 
Feinstein's clothing. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend turns out to be especially painful, as candidates blitz the 
airwaves in a bold last-minute attempt to fuzz the issues and confuse voters. 
</P>
<P>
As James Garner says in an ad opposing Props 118 and 119: "You've heard the 
campaign rhetoric." Right, again and again. 
</P>
<P>
After sorting through the weekend's crush of commercials, I now have a clear 
idea of what Tuesday's election is about: 
</P>
<P>
For the third consecutive year, not only has Acura "outranked every other 
automobile in America," but "since Elton Gallegly went to Washington, not a 
single federal dollar has trickled back for home-town projects" that support 
Calvin Klein's political cronies who are "spending a million dollars of trial 
lawyer money on unfair negative advertising." 
</P>
<P>
What's more, state Treasurer Tom Hayes has "the experience to do the job" 
because Ira Reiner and Charlton Heston wrote Prop 103 and Bill Press has 
totally mishandled the McMartin Case while Jack Lemmon was "busting our butts 
trying to get the insurance companies to obey the law" during which 
"politicians have taken millions in cash gifts, fancy meals and free trips" 
that are available in limited quantities as long as Arlo Smith is the "Democrat 
for attorney general." 
</P>
<P>
And, by the way, if you make a wrong choice Tuesday, don't worry. Every 
candidate and proposition on the ballot comes with a 14-day guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
Let's get serious here! It's time for heavy analysis. 
</P>
<P>
"Think of your tax dollars as a stream of water," says a spot for Republican 
congressional candidate Sang Korman showing water gushing from a hose -- for 20 
seconds! HASN'T THIS MAN HEARD ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S WATER SHORTAGE??? 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, why don't other candidates look as divinely touched as Ira Reiner 
does in his commercials. Grab your hankies and just look at that angelic mug, 
the eyes gazing upward ever so subtly, as if in contact with some greater 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
What about the weekend's juxtaposition of ads? 
</P>
<P>
* A Smith spot accuses Reiner of one heinous act after another, including 
personally "losing the battle against crime." Zap! Suddenly it's James Garner: 
"Can you believe this?" Although Garner's spot addresses Props 118 and 119 and 
not the Democratic race for attorney general, his question applies to all of 
the weekend's political spots, including his own. 
</P>
<P>
* A Harvey Rosenfield spot supporting Conway Collis for insurance commissioner 
features a curiously small picture of candidate Collis followed by a shot of 
Rosenfield that brings him so close to the camera that I can almost see up his 
nose. Zap! The next voice I hear is a woman's in a commercial for Calvin 
Klein's well-known scent: "Between love and madness, lies Obsession." Seconds 
later, she adds: "Ah, the smell of it." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Feinstein's campaign to impale Van de Kamp on his past gets 
inadvertent help from NBC, which repeatedly runs promos for its Sunday movie 
about a "sex killer" who "terrorizes the women of Hawaii," and a beautiful 
female D.A. who becomes a decoy to capture him. The movie's title? "Revealing 
Evidence: Stalking the Honolulu Strangler." 
</P>
<P>
In effect, the oft-aired promo becomes an echo, giving shrill resonance to 
Feinstein's own spot blasting Van de Kamp: "Do you know he tried to drop murder 
charges against the Hillside Stranger?" 
</P>
<P>
Politics in California. Ah, the smell of it.

Everybody understands the blues 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ray Charles 
</P>
<P>
Ain't it the truth. If you've ever been down, sad, miserable or otherwise out 
of sorts, then you've had the blues. 
</P>
<P>
Getting rid of the blues can be as simple as listening to the blues, one of the 
oldest American song forms and musical styles around. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're feeling low, the blues picks you up like a spirit," says John Lee 
Hooker, the veteran guitarist/singer who won a 1989 Best Traditional Blues 
Grammy for his rendition, with Bonnie Raitt, of "I'm in the Mood." 
</P>
<P>
Blues lovers and other enthusiasts can get their fair share of a wide variety 
of the blues from Benson &amp; Hedges Blues, a weeklong festival of free and 
ticketed blues performances that begins tonight and roars on until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Blues greats Hooker, B.B. King, Dr. John and Stevie Ray Vaughan, along with 
many Los Angeles area musicians -- Doug MacLeod, Bernie Pearl and Jimmy and 
Jeannie Cheatham among them -- will take part in the festival, which will 
feature shows at area venues from Banger's in Tarzana to Marla's Memory Lane in 
Los Angeles. The event is highlighted by a concert by King, Hooker, Joe Cocker, 
John, Vaughan and Irma Thomas at the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa on 
Saturday. That concert is also a benefit -- $1 from each ticket sold will go to 
Shelter Partnership Inc., an umbrella organization that aids a variety of 
groups that work with the homeless in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The celebration, which is produced by George Wein's Festival Productions, kicks 
off tonight with five "Stormy Monday" shows in nightclubs across Southern 
California, including guitarist MacLeod at Reuben's in Redondo Beach, singer 
Dee Dee McNeil at Cafe Lido in Newport Beach and singer/guitarist Roy Gaines at 
Moody's in the downtown L.A.'s Sheraton Grand Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
This year marks the first time Los Angeles is a site for the festival, which 
debuted in St. Louis, Atlanta and New York in 1988 and will be held in five 
cities in 1990. "We chose Los Angeles because of its heritage in the rhythm and 
blues field," says Jane Yusko, manager of the festival for Benson &amp; Hedges. 
</P>
<P>
The recognition is a long time coming as far as Johnny Otis is concerned. Otis 
has been an integral part of the Southland's R&amp;B scene -- which he defines 
as a mixture of "blues, jazz and gospel" -- since the mid-'40s. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been grossly overlooked in terms our contribution to the history of 
rhythm and blues. Los Angeles was the one of most important and earliest 
incubators of R&amp;B," says the man who discovered such artists as singers 
Charles Brown and the late Esther Phillips, and who is perhaps best known for 
his 1958 hit, "Willie and the Hand Jive." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, from the mid-'40s to mid-'50s, such artists as pianist Floyd Dixon, 
guitarists T-Bone Walker (composer of "Stormy Monday Blues"), Lowell Fulson and 
Pee Wee Crayton, saxmen Louis Jordan and and Eddie "Cleanhead" Vinson and 
singers Big Joe Turner and Big Mama Thornton (who wrote "Hound Dog") either 
made Los Angeles their home or worked here extensively. They often performed in 
the Central Avenue area, long renowned for the presence of jazz giants like 
Charlie Parker, Dexter Gordon and Art Tatum, but a showcase for many blues and 
R&amp;B musicians as well. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Pearl, who produces the annual Long Beach blues festival in September 
and who, in association with Festival Productions, helped coordinate talent for 
this week's festival, says that while the blues scene here has rarely hit the 
heights of the '40s and '50s heydays, things are looking up. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like we've reached a stage where blues is an accepted part of the 
(music) scene, whereas a few years ago, it was unusual to see blues acts," 
Pearl says. "And a lot of local artists like (harmonica player) James Harman 
and (guitarist) Phillip Walker also tour out-of-town often." 
</P>
<P>
And if blues is on the rise in the Southland -- clubs such as the Music 
Machine, the Grand Avenue Bar and St. Mark's spotlight blues regularly -- it 
seems its appeal is also on the upswing on a national and international basis. 
</P>

"The blues are hot," says Hooker, whose "I'm in the Mood" was originally a 
Number One R&amp;B hit in 1951. "They're being appreciated the way they should 
have been appreciated a long time ago. Young fans are coming out and everywhere 
I go it's a sell-out." 
</P>
<P>
Younger artists like Vaughan and Robert Cray are in the spotlight, spreading 
the blues word. "People like Stevie Ray turn their audiences on to men like 
B.B. King, Albert Collins or whoever, and it really helps," says Mac Rebennack, 
also known as Dr. John. 
</P>
<P>
The Louisiana-born Rebennack has his own reasons for the enduring, although not 
always highly commercial, presence of the blues on the American popular music 
scene. "It's real," he says. "Anyway you chop it up, you can't dodge this 
thing. Either you get real and you deal with it or you just melt. The blues is 
crucial chronic music. It's like six by six -- as serious as death." 
</P>
<P>
 Other events on tap are the "Boat Full of Blues," a cruise around L.A. harbor 
with Pearl, John Mayall and Floyd Dixon, departing from Pier 93C, San Pedro, on 
Friday, 8 p.m., (213) 426-4616; an evening of rare blues films screened by 
archivist Mark Cantor at the Laemmle's Monica Fourplex in Santa Monica on

SOUTH AFRICA LOOSENS THE REINS OF MOVIE CENSORSHIP; 
</P>
<P>
FREE SPEECH: THE COUNTRY'S MORE RELAXED APPROACH TO LANGUAGE AND NUDITY 
REFLECTS A FUNDAMENTAL BREAK FROM ITS STRICT, CALVINIST PAST.

PRETORIA, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The censors thought Marlon Brando was all wrong as the crusty South African 
barrister. He met privately with his client. He wore the wrong robe in court. 
And then he stalked the courtroom like, well, an American lawyer, while 
questioning witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
No respectable barrister would do such things here. 
</P>
<P>
But that turned out to be one of the reasons South Africa's censors gave for 
unbanning "A Dry White Season." Such "obvious flaws," they concluded recently, 
"would lead the South African viewer to grimace or smirk . . . and immediately 
realize" that the film was fiction. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa has one of the most exhaustive film censorship systems of any 
country in the Western world. About 1,300 films a year are studied, often frame 
by frame, and cuts for nudity, language and politics are the subject of lengthy 
public appeals argued by batteries of lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Today that complex process is undergoing dramatic changes, reflecting a 
fundamental break from South Africa's traditionally strict, Calvinist past to a 
new, more relaxed and secular approach to cultural gatekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is the trend more evident than on the marquees of South Africa, where 
such R-rated fare as "Born on the Fourth of July," "Harlem Nights," "Cry 
Freedom," "sex, lies, and videotape" and "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" 
have been appearing. 
</P>
<P>
This is the same country that once banned "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" 
because too many people were watching it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting things through the censors that we never would have dreamed of 
getting through five or 10 years ago," said lawyer Johann van der Westhuizen, 
who has handled hundreds of censorship-board appeals for film distributors 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Film distributors credit the Publications Appeals Board, the ultimate censor in 
South Africa, with adapting a liberal interpretation of censorship laws -- and 
dragging the country's conservatives along, albeit reluctantly. 
</P>
<P>
"For years we've argued that you can't ban something because it's extremely 
irritating or unpleasant to watch or even highly critical," Van der Westhuizen 
said. "And now they are listening." 
</P>
<P>
South African censors have always been most sensitive about language -- not 
four-letter swear words but expressions such as "Jesus!," "Christ!" and "Oh, 
God!" Film companies still have more success getting nudity than raw language 
past the censors, but "we're getting a lot of the language through now," said 
Van der Westhuizen. 
</P>
<P>
When the censors ordered 10 dialogue cuts for language in Eddie Murphy's 
"Harlem Nights," Van der Westhuizen put a social-linguistics professor on the 
stand during the appeal. The professor testified that, in the street culture of 
Harlem, language has historically played an important role as an instrument of 
resistance to a white-dominated society. 
</P>
<P>
The censors were at least partly convinced. They restored five of the cuts, and 
the film was released on the condition that no one under 19 could see it. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa's censors say their changing attitudes are simply tracking 
worldwide trends. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole world is in a process of secularization, and one must accept that," 
said Braam Coetzee, director of South Africa's censorship body, the 
Publications Directorate. "Films no longer just tell a story. They show 
problems of life in their splendor and their sordidness. They show real people 
-- and real people use swear words." 
</P>
<P>
But some conservative whites think the censors have opened the door too wide, 
especially for language and nudity. And President Frederik W. de Klerk may have 
been feeling pressure from his own theologically conservative church when he 
decided not to reappoint Kobus van Rooyen to a third term as head of the 
censorship appeals board. 
</P>
<P>
Until Van Rooyen's appointment 10 years ago, the cultural revolution had 
virtually passed South Africa by. 
</P>
<P>
Television wasn't introduced here until 1976, and even today its heavy dose of 
American fare is strictly censored, without appeal. The word God is routinely 
excised from programs, penis was cut from a recent episode of 
"thirtysomething," and an interracial kiss in a past "L.A. Law" also got the 
ax. 
</P>
<P>
The censors apply looser standards for movies, though, taking into account the 
artistic merit of the film and its likely audience. 
</P>
<P>
An Academy Award nomination or critical acclaim in the United States often has 
saved movies from the censors' scissors in South Africa. "The Unbearable 
Lightness of Being," "A Clockwork Orange" and "The Big Chill" all made it to 
South Africa's screens uncut due, at least in part, to praise from overseas 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
"Born on the Fourth of July," an Oscar-nominated film with especially frank 
language, was cut in five places by the first round of censors but released 
uncut on appeal for a long run here. 
</P>
<P>
"We give priority to the goals of viewers who would like to see films of 
caliber with as few cuts as possible," said Van Rooyen. 
</P>
<P>
The initial hurdle for films in South Africa is the Publications Directorate in 
Cape Town, where panels of three or four citizens view the films and issue a 
ruling. (Most reviewers are white; blacks, who make up 75% of the population, 
have no say in government censorship.) 
</P>
<P>
Coetzee, the censorship director, tells the citizen panels to use the standards 
of "a reasonable member of the community who doesn't hurry to judgment. Our 
golden rule is that if something is integral to the film, you're not entitled 
to take it away." 
</P>
<P>
Two of the board's decisions -- in the cases of "Cry Freedom" and "A Dry White 
Season" -- marked a turning point for censorship in South Africa and reflected 
the new, more relaxed political atmosphere introduced by President De Klerk's 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"Cry Freedom," a film about the friendship between a white newspaper editor and 
Black Consciousness leader Steve Biko, was approved in 1988. But on opening day 
police confiscated the reels, saying it was a threat to state security. The 
authorities returned the film this year, and "Cry Freedom" opened, uncut, in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
The difficult journey of "A Dry White Season" reflected the rigorous test that 
political films still must undergo. The story, about a white schoolteacher's 
political awakening after police kill his gardener, was banned in January as a 
threat to national security, but the distributors appealed. 
</P>
<P>
The state's attorney argued that the film portrayed the police and judges in a 
bad light and that Brando's courtroom scene misrepresented South Africa's 
judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
The state also argued that the film's epilogue, which said the government 
"continues to ban, imprison, torture and murder (those) who oppose apartheid," 
was inaccurate and inflammatory. 
</P>
<P>
Van der Westhuizen, arguing for the film distributors, United International 
Pictures, countered that film was a work of fiction that would incite no one to 
violence and presented no "clear and present danger" to the state. 
</P>
<P>
"For black people who lived through these times, it's nothing new. They may 
feel emotional, but it's not going to cause a revolution," Van der Westhuizen 
said. He acknowledged that whites who see the film "may get angry. But they 
won't hate blacks. They'll be angry at the filmmakers in America." 
</P>
<P>
The appeals board agreed with Van der Westhuizen. It said the factual flaws in 
the film, including Brando's courtroom behavior, would be obvious to any South 
African. It added that most viewers would more likely "discuss, criticize and 
rethink" the film than "to feel more inclined to unrest or to hatred." The film 
was approved, uncut, for showing to audiences over 21. 
</P>
<P>
To cut a film like "A Dry White Season," Van der Westhuizen said later, "would 
be worse than banning it as far as the country's image is concerned. It would 
look as if they were taking the sting out. And we wouldn't screen it."

STARRY, STARRY NIGHT MAKES WARNER BROS. BASH AN OCCASION TO REMEMBER; 
</P>

MOVIES: STUDIO THROWS A SPECTACULAR PARTY TO MARK THE RECLAIMING OF THE LOT IT 
HAD SHARED WITH COLUMBIA.

Saturday night, Warner Bros. threw itself a glittering party that even 
Hollywood veterans said was without compare. One-thousand invited guests, 
including a larger contingent of stars than the Oscars customarily draw, were 
greeted by a marching band, 300 costumed extras and countless singers and 
dancers re-creating production numbers from such vintage Warner movies as "The 
Jazz Singer," "Hollywood Hotel" and "Yankee Doodle Dandy." All this -- and much 
more -- served as mere prologue to the elaborate banquet and show on Stage 18, 
which had been transformed into an outsize Rick's Cafe Americain from 
"Casablanca" but was actually more reminiscent of the Cocoanut Grove in its 
heyday, even to the palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion -- which drew everyone from Mae Clark (who had that grapefruit 
shoved in her face by James Cagney in "The Public Enemy," 1931) and Ronald 
Reagan (who starred or was featured in more Warner movies than any other living 
actor) to Sylvester Stallone and Jack Nicholson -- was a "Celebration of 
Tradition," produced by David Wolper, Jack Haley Jr. (who also directed) and 
Steven Spielberg to commemorate Warner's reclaiming of its entire lot, which 
for the last 18 years it had co-owned in Burbank with Columbia. A high point 
was the unveiling of the studio's water tower, once again bearing the Warner 
logo. 
</P>
<P>
The evening was pure Hollywood: one extravagant number after another, big and 
brassy, sentimental and nostalgic, tremendously affecting clips and personal 
appearances, spangles and sequins, humor and foolishness and 
self-congratulation, elegance and glamour. It was like the Oscars minus the 
awards and with far better musical numbers. (Clearly, there's a terrific TV 
special in all this.) A radiant Ruby Keeler, the studio's first female musical 
star, said it all when she remarked: "Reporters always ask me how it used to 
be. After tonight they won't have to ask anymore." 
</P>
<P>
What made the evening, with Clint Eastwood greeting the guests, truly special 
was that its producers, writers and choreographers had done their homework and 
made an all-out attempt to call attention -- in under three hours yet -- to the 
studio's key contributors in its nearly seven-decade history. Indeed, opening 
the show was a group of studio staffers, whose terms of service ranged from 
eight months to well over 50 years, singing "We're the Warner Brothers." When 
Loretta Young graciously read off a roll call of departed Warner stars, the 
roster included not just Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney and Edward 
G. Robinson, but also such invaluable character actors as Allen Jenkins and 
George Tobias. And when a clip of Busby Berkeley's "By a Waterfall" was 
followed by a live contemporary-style re-enactment, Keeler's sister Gertrude 
was introduced at its conclusion as one of the original Berkeley Girls. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, who was introduced by Spielberg as "the star of 'Girls on Probation' 
and the 40th President of the United States," hosted a segment of memorable 
moments from Warner movies -- and then found himself spotlighted in the 
hilarious "Best of the Bloopers" segment that featured him struggling 
unsuccessfully with the pants zipper on his Army uniform. (This was during the 
shooting of "John Loves Mary," 1949.) There was a heavy emphasis on musicals -- 
salutes to songwriter Harry Warren, to Warner films of Broadway musicals, to 
Busby Berkeley, to Warner composers from Max Steiner to Danny Elfman, and a 
medley of songs from Warner movies sung by Liza Minnelli, who capped the 
evening by reading off the names of every star present, all of whom then came 
forward for an historic group photograph. (Notable by their absence: Lauren 
Bacall and Doris Day.) 
</P>
<P>
While waiting for his car, Cesar Romero, who has probably been to more 
Hollywood galas than anyone else, said that the evening was wonderful and that 
he was thrilled to have been included, yet added wistfully: "I don't think 
we'll ever see anything like it again."

CHECKPOINT PLAN BEING OPPOSED; 
</P>
<P>
MIGRANTS: SOME SAN DIEGO COUNTY OFFICIALS SAY THE PROPOSED $33-MILLION BORDER 
PATROL STATION ON I-5 AT CAMP PENDLETON WOULD ONLY ADD TO THE AREA'S ILLEGAL 
ALIEN PROBLEM.

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first stirring of political opposition to a $33-million, 16-lane border 
checkpoint on Interstate 5 at Camp Pendleton is quietly rippling through 
northern San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Several elected leaders, including County Supervisor John MacDonald, Carlsbad 
Mayor Bud Lewis and Vista Mayor Gloria McClellan, are either flatly against the 
new checkpoint or have doubts about it. 
</P>
<P>
With northern San Diego County flooded by thousands of illegal migrants, the 
officials have concerns that the checkpoint, which would be built in 1992 if 
Congress approves funding, might make the local migrant situation worse. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis will meet soon with Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) to press his pleas 
that the federal government junk the checkpoint and marshal forces at the 
U.S.-Mexico border to stop undocumented migrants there. 
</P>
<P>
"That thing should be down at the border, that's where the problem is," said 
Lewis, who contends that a north county checkpoint only serves to trap migrants 
who can't pass farther north to Orange County and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Packard, Lewis said, "I do not feel that a new border checkpoint 
would benefit North County. Rather it would intensify the problem by making 
this area the stopping point for those who cannot cross the checkpoint. We do 
not need the additional problems of a larger migrant population." 
</P>
<P>
While Lewis has been complaining to Washington, MacDonald, whose sprawling 5th 
District includes nearly all of the north county area, has created a special 
12-member group to advise him on Latino issues. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first things MacDonald asked members to do at their inaugural 
meeting this month is study the checkpoint and return with a recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
"I support investigating the possibility of taking that checkpoint out," said 
MacDonald, who questions the effectiveness of the existing Border Patrol 
checkpoint at San Onofre, south of the Orange County line. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people go through Camp Pendleton to evade the checkpoint," said the 
county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, one reason for building an expanded checkpoint on Camp Pendleton 
land was to end the controversy over the facility at San Onofre. For years, San 
Clemente and other cities north of the checkpoint have complained about 
dangerous high-speed chases as authorities pursued suspects through their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
When the Bush Administration put $10 million in the proposed federal budget for 
fiscal 1991, the reason was partly to calm Orange County's fears by putting a 
new checkpoint in more open area several miles south. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration also wanted an expanded checkpoint that would stem the 
migrant problem and possibly slow the flow of illicit drugs coming into the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
It's expected that the Administration will seek an additional $23-million 
appropriation for fiscal 1992 to complete the new checkpoint, near the Las 
Pulgas Road exit. At that point, I-5 would be widened into 16 lanes, 
encroaching onto Camp Pendleton for additional space, and a row of inspection 
booths would be installed. 
</P>
<P>
The checkpoint would be manned by 150 Border Patrol agents, double the staffing 
at the San Onofre facility. 
</P>
<P>
There has been little publicity about the new checkpoint, and it is only slowly 
becoming an issue to some northern San Diego County elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
In Vista, a city less troubled by migrants than Carlsbad or Encinitas, Mayor 
McClellan objects to the checkpoint chiefly because to her it represents 
another effort by Orange County to solve its problems at San Diego County's 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should we be worrying about the problems in Orange County and take the 
pain here?" she asked. "It seems every time Orange County doesn't want 
something, we get it. It gets a little old." 
</P>
<P>
But MacDonald began having doubts about the checkpoint because of the high 
number of migrants being injured or killed as they dart across the freeway 
while trying to work their way around the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that brought this to our attention was the frequent deaths 
and the accidents that occur as (drivers) dodge those incidents," MacDonald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the California Highway Patrol, so far this year five collisions in 
the checkpoint area have claimed the lives of five pedestrians and injured a 
sixth. In 1989, the CHP reported that 16 accidents in the area killed 13 
pedestrians and hurt three others. Most victims are believed to be migrants. 
</P>
<P>
While MacDonald is awaiting a recommendation from his advisory group, there is 
clearly some sentiment among members that the new checkpoint might only 
compound the migrant problem. 
</P>
<P>
George Lopez of Oceanside, a group member and executive director of a north San 
Diego County job training organization for low-income people, said when he 
talks to people about the checkpoint, "in general, 95% of the time, I get the 
comment back, 'What good does it do in North County?' " 
</P>
<P>
He believes the checkpoint accomplishes little except to bottle up undocumented 
migrants in North County. "I'd be comfortable sitting up here in North County 
if I didn't have to cross that checkpoint," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis hopes that meeting with Packard and showing the congressman where 
Carlsbad's migrants sleep in canyon camps and wait for work during the day will 
change federal thinking about the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Lewis intends to openly seek support from other elected 
leaders in north San Diego County to oppose the checkpoint. He wants "simply to 
bombard our federal representatives how we feel about it," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis may have his work cut out. 
</P>
<P>
Besides having modest influence over the federal budget, Lewis will have a 
difficult time convincing Packard and Border Patrol officials to abandon the 
new checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
Packard said he's willing to discuss the checkpoint with Lewis, but he 
considers the facility a critical second line of defense to keep immigrants 
from passing through San Diego County for other destinations. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important we prevent them from escaping into the rest of the country and 
lose track of them, so I think (the checkpoint) has to be done," Packard said. 
</P>
<P>
He agrees with Lewis that the federal government must do more at the 
international border to stop the flow of migrants, but even so, he insists that 
the north county checkpoint remain. "I don't believe opening up the checkpoint 
is an acceptable solution," Packard said. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does the Border Patrol yield on the issue, and Ted Swofford, a supervisory 
agent, pointed to the number of illegal immigrants caught at the existing 
checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
From Jan. 1 to May 23, agents detained 29,465 undocumented aliens at the San 
Onofre facility. Agents also seized 100 vehicles a month and "an awful lot of 
narcotics," Swofford said. 
</P>
<P>
He disputes Lewis' assertion that the checkpoint forces many migrants to stay 
in north county. "Considering the volume of people we're catching, I get the 
feeling the people in Carlsbad and Encinitas would be there whether there's a 
checkpoint or not," Swofford said. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is clearly the beginning of a political dispute over the 
checkpoint, so far, not everybody is prepared to become partisan. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pam Slater of Encinitas, where the City Council has declared a state of 
emergency because of its migrant problems, said "it would be foolish and 
irresponsible not to improve" the north county checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
But she emphasized that the new checkpoint "could exacerbate our problem" 
unless tough measures also are undertaken at the U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
While Lewis is strident on the issue, some north San Diego County politicians 
hardly think about it. A spokesman for Oceanside Mayor Larry Bagley said, "the 
mayor just doesn't have an opinion one way or another on it."

3 KILLED IN GANGLAND ATTACK DURING LYNWOOD RIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
Even by Los Angeles-area gangland standards, the shooting at California and 
Sanborn avenues Sunday morning was a bloody piece of work -- a minute's worth 
of gunplay in Lynwood that turned a car ride into a triple murder. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Perez, 19, of Compton and two others died after gunmen pelted their 
late-model Oldsmobile with bullets at 1:20 a.m. Sunday, authorities said. A 
fourth occupant of the car escaped harm by ducking in the rear seat. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's homicide investigators have not released the name 
of the 17-year-old survivor, a Lynwood resident, and were trying to confirm the 
identities of the other victims. 
</P>
<P>
When the shooting started, Perez was driving at the tail end of a four-car 
caravan en route to a nearby party, investigators said in a report based on 
eyewitness accounts. As Perez negotiated a three-point turn, two other vehicles 
approached -- a white Toyota pickup and a white, two-door Datsun. 
</P>
<P>
Someone in the pickup yelled, "Where you from?" a common gang challenge, 
detectives said. Before anyone responded, another person in the pickup opened 
fire with a shotgun. Another man, armed with a handgun, bolted from the Datsun 
and riddled the victims' car with bullets. 
</P>
<P>
The assailants raced away as the sleeping neighborhood awoke to the horror 
outside their doorsteps. 
</P>
<P>
To Johnny Morris, 17, who arrived at the scene before deputies, it appeared 
that the victims never had a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Both doors were shut," he said. "It looks like they were ducking, trying not 
to get hit." 
</P>
<P>
Street noise at the busy intersection is not unusual. That's why Tomas Padilla, 
who rents a house nearby, wondered if the early morning cacophony had been a 
traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did he find the carnage on the street, but also two bullet holes in an 
outside wall of his house and seven more in a living room window -- just above 
the top of the couch where he, his wife and 16-year-old daughter usually sit to 
watch television.

CITY HOPES TO WEATHER WATER-TIGHT SUMMER; 
</P>
<P>
DROUGHT: A WATER RATIONING PLAN THAT SAN CLEMENTE OFFICIALS HOPE WILL AVERT THE 
CRISIS OF LAST SUMMER WILL GO INTO EFFECT JUNE 15.

<P>
The beginning of last summer's water crisis can be pinpointed on a smudged 
paper graph tucked away in a Tri-Cities Municipal Water District desk at 
Palisades Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
"There it is right there," district supervisor Tony E. Gomez said, pointing to 
a line of red ink indicating that the water level began to dip toward the 
center of the platter-shaped chart. 
</P>
<P>
It was Sunday, June 25, 1989, at 9 a.m., to be precise. 
</P>
<P>
That was the moment, water officials say, when the 5.9-acre reservoir began a 
steady two-month decline from 44 million gallons of drinking water to less than 
half that amount. 
</P>
<P>
The unexpected dip in the city's major water supply sent ripples of fear 
through the beach community and created political waves that ended with passage 
of the strictest rationing ordinance in the county. 
</P>
<P>
This year, city and water district officials in San Clemente are hoping that a 
slew of measures aimed at reducing water consumption will help the city get 
through another long, hot summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll just have to wait and see," Mayor Candace Haggard said. "(But) I think 
that what we are doing is a very good first step" toward avoiding a relapse 
into the shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Tri-Cities Municipal Water District serves San Clemente -- its largest customer 
-- the Capistrano Beach district of Dana Point, San Onofre State Park and the 
San Onofre Nuclear Power Station. Since last summer, the district has initiated 
a rationing plan that will take effect June 15, a 5-month-old building 
moratorium, a new well and an agreement to reroute some reclaimed water for 
irrigation and grading. 
</P>
<P>
Because of increased awareness and unusually mild temperatures for the last few 
months, water use is down 4% in San Clemente and 20% in Capistrano Beach, in 
contrast with last year, Gomez said. For the last nine months, the district has 
kept filled to the brim its 48-million-gallon reservoir in the hills northeast 
of Interstate 5 off Avenida Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"But what happens when you get warm weather?" Gomez asked rhetorically. "Bam! 
You have increased demand." 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente, a 19-square-mile city of 39,100 residents, is not the only city 
facing water shortages this summer. With Southern California locked in a 
four-year drought, other municipalities, including Los Angeles, are pondering 
measures that range from surcharges for excessive use to simple warnings to 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara, the city with probably the strictest water rationing law in 
Southern California, recently mailed water bills that charged certain high-use 
customers thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Newport Beach recently passed an ordinance fixing surcharges 
on residential consumption and construction water use, but the law is not 
expected to be as stringent, expensive or controversial as the Santa Barbara 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, water districts in Huntington Beach, Orange, Anaheim, Fullerton, 
Laguna Beach and other county areas have been adopting or considering 
ordinances asking customers to conserve water voluntarily by up to 10%. 
</P>
<P>
More stringent measures could be considered next year if the drought persists 
into a fifth year. But San Clemente officials said that after the 1989 scare, 
they decided not to wait for a law requiring fines and cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Passed in October, the city's ordinance takes effect during this year's driest 
months and lasts through Sept. 15. Lawn watering and other residential 
irrigation will be permitted only on odd or even days, with the days determined 
by residents' addresses. Further, residents will be limited to no more than 650 
gallons a day. Violators will face fines of up to $100. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, developers will be barred from using potable water during grading 
and will be required to treat exposed slopes with anti-erosion materials before 
planting, said Greg Morehead, the city utilities manager. More stringent 
restrictions will result if the reservoir's water level drops to 35 million 
gallons, and even more at 25 million gallons. 
</P>
<P>
"We know we are going to have a water shortage," Morehead said. 
</P>
<P>
Hanging on the wall beside the front door of Morehead's office is a framed 
needlepoint that depicts a small well. Underneath is the slogan, "When the well 
runs dry, we know the worth of water." 
</P>
<P>
"People will have to think about that," Morehead said. "We all have to learn 
how not to waste water." 
</P>
<P>
The reason for last year's unusual water shortage is simple, city officials 
said. San Clemente, like other South County cities, has had rapid residential 
growth in recent years. But the only pipe that brings water to Palisades 
Reservoir has not been enlarged to accommodate demand. 
</P>
<P>
Relief is expected to come from a $114-million South County pipeline project 
that will double the supply to San Clemente. It is expected to be finished next 
summer, but the project has been delayed by right-of-way issues. 
</P>
<P>
Until the project's completion, seeking some of the solutions to the water 
shortage will be left up to local politicians. Water activist Karoline Koester, 
who wants to regain a City Council seat she lost four years ago, and Councilman 
Thomas Lorch, a political ally, have criticized a plan to use treated waste 
water for irrigating the year-old Pacific Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
Reclaimed water would also be used to grade a large construction site for 5,000 
homes in Talega Valley, just outside the city limits. Construction of a pipe 
that will link the private golf course and the residential project to the 
city's reclamation plant is under way, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But Koester and Lorch said the water is not treated enough and could pose a 
health risk to golfers and construction workers, as well as contaminate an 
underground water source that is used by the Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that I am against reclaimed water," said Lorch, a slow-growth 
advocate who has long been critical of the Talega Valley project. "We just want 
to make sure that the water is going to be used in a safe way." 
</P>
<P>
Morehead and other city officials dispute the claim that the chlorinated water 
is unhealthy. They also point out that the golf course uses up to 650,000 
gallons of drinking water each day to keep the manicured fairways green. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Water Resources is reviewing the proposal to use the 
reclaimed water.

FISHING, CARDS AND CAMARADERIE ARE LURES RETIREE CAN'T RESIST 
</P>

<P>
He clocks in punctually each day a bit before noon, bearing the tools of his 
trade. A fishing pole is in one hand, an old scuffed tackle box in the other. 
He sports a plaid flannel shirt, baggy blue jeans and a dirt-smudged, canvas 
hat with a thin twine of dock rope stitched to the brim and gold portholes on 
the sides. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Peach has arrived. As he does four or five days a week, the 75-year-old 
retiree steps aboard the charter fishing boat Western Pride, docked at Davey's 
Locker on the Balboa Peninsula, and prepares for an afternoon on the water. 
</P>
<P>
Time to go after some bonito, a barracuda or two, or a few calico bass. During 
the jaunt in and out to the fishing spots, Peach and his buddies will also deal 
a few dozen rounds of seven-card stud, nickel a hand, and high spade in the 
hole splits the pot. 
</P>
<P>
These are the common sights of summer, the fishing charters heading out of 
Newport Harbor loaded with a cargo of tourists and locals armed with fishing 
rods and hopes of snagging that behemoth we all know lurks beneath the choppy 
swells. But none is more regular than Peach and his gang, an avuncular 
contingent of fishermen who know the waters off Orange County like they know 
their grandkids. Maybe better. 
</P>
<P>
Peach has been doing this for about a decade, heading out on the Western Pride 
every weekday, skipping the weekends when too many teen-agers and landlubbers 
clog the boat's wooden rails. His post-retirement stint aboard the charter boat 
represents just a fraction of his fishing career. Peach has been angling the 
local waters since he was 10. 
</P>
<P>
He looks the part of the old man and the sea. Deep lines crease his face, a 
bushy white mustache rests below wire-rimmed glasses. His hands are thick and 
stubby, callused from the years. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the Western Pride's engines roared to life and the boat swung away 
from the dock, Peach and his cohorts were huddled around one of the booths in 
the cafeteria below deck, playing poker. 
</P>
<P>
As the Western Pride lunged across the waves, the cards were dealt hard and 
fast. Nickels and quarters flew. And the table listed decidedly toward Claude 
Wright, a gregarious retired Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy affectionately 
known as "the Sheriff" while aboard the Western Pride. Wright was winning most 
of the nickels this day. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll change. It'll change," Peach muttered, peering at his fan of cards from 
a corner of the booth. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, Jeanne Harris settled into a booth to watch the game and offer up some 
homemade brownies she had brought aboard for the men. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all characters, but really nice guys," said Harris, a Corona del Mar 
resident who spends one afternoon a week fishing on the Western Pride with her 
husband John. "None of them are foul-mouthed or anything." 
</P>
<P>
But they are competitive when it comes to fishing. Harris recalled how it stuck 
in the craw of Peach and the rest when she returned from a trip off Key West, 
Fla., having reeled in a record 46-pound fish. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course they didn't talk to me for a while after that," she said, "But they 
got over it." 
</P>
<P>
Peach kept getting lousy cards, so he turned his attention to talking fishing. 
He's done it all -- the ocean, lakes, streams -- and remembers the way it was 
in the old days, "before everything was fished out." 
</P>
<P>
A week earlier he returned from a trout fishing trip among the lakes flanking 
Mt. Shasta. But he much prefers the ocean to fly fishing in some mountain 
brook. "It's close and convenient," Peach said. "I live in Huntington Beach, 
only about 10 miles up the coast from here. Anyway, I'm too old for that 
mountain stuff. It's too cold." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the boat slowed. Peach and his buddies jumped up from the table. 
"Here we are!" Peach said, scurrying up the ladder and out the hatch like a man 
several springs younger. There were fish to be caught. 
</P>
<P>
Left in their wake to clean the table of discarded beer cans was Fran Maxwell, 
the boat's fry chef. "The regulars like Gene, I just really love them," she 
said. "They're all like grandfathers to me. The old stories they tell you, of 
how it was 25, 35 years ago. All the construction, it scares them. They feel 
like they're being pushed away." 
</P>
<P>
The boat motored slowly, trolling for just the right spot. Capt. Bob Ezell 
scanned an electronic fish-finding scope, hunting for the bright red blob that 
would indicate a school directly below. At the stern, deckhand Mike Hennessy 
chucked handfuls of live anchovies he pulled with a small net from a big 
storage tank. 
</P>
<P>
Then someone spotted a fish flop off in the distance. "They're jumping back 
there!" 
</P>
<P>
"They're boiling, Mike," someone else yelled. 
</P>
<P>
The deck was abuzz with activity. Captain Bob swung the boat around, while 
Peach and the rest grabbed their poles and began casting off in all directions. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Orstad, 68, stood just off Peach's right elbow, and within a minute he 
pulled a hefty bonito from the sea. A few minutes later, Orstad pulled up 
another fish, its silver and turquoise sides gleaming in the sunlight. A smile 
lighted Orstad's face. 
</P>
<P>
Peach, meanwhile, was being shut out. He shook his head and muttered something. 
This, obviously, was getting hard to take. But within 10 minutes, no one was 
catching fish, not even Orstad. 
</P>
<P>
"OK boys and girls, time to go," Ezell announced over the boat's public address 
system. "The fish took off and left us. That's the way it's been all day." 
</P>
<P>
As Peach reeled in his line and the boat set off for new waters, the Sheriff 
scampered over to console him. Friends could see Peach was mildly irked that 
the fish were avoiding his hook. 
</P>
<P>
Several times a week, Peach wins the fishing derby held each day aboard the 
Western Pride (the boat's scrapbook has a picture of him holding two salmon, 
one of them a 25-pound whopper he caught off Orange County in April). Each 
participant pays $3 to enter the contest, and the angler who catches the 
biggest fish takes the pot. Today nearly $70 was at stake, and Peach was off to 
a bad start. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a reputation as the man with the most jackpots," said the Sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, you can see how good I'm doing today," Peach muttered. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff ignored this. "They call him Gene the fishing machine," he said 
with a grin. "Jackpot Gene." 
</P>
<P>
Even Peach, a no-nonsense guy who normally wears a poker face, smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no rhyme or reason to the fish," he said. "There's a little skill to 
it, but not particularly this type of fishing. This is just finding schools of 
fish and having them hit your hook." 
</P>
<P>
Peach didn't always spend afternoons fishing. For 45 years he was a truck 
driver, running loads of gasoline, diesel and propane from refineries. He never 
had an accident. 
</P>
<P>
Last Dec. 26, he and wife Eileen celebrated their 50th year of marriage. After 
all the years, she still approves of his afternoons on the water. "She knows 
I'm not chasing around somewhere, not sitting in a bar . . . ," Peach says. 
"The secret of marriage, I think, is the longer you're away from one another 
the better." 
</P>
<P>
After a few more attempts to find a flock of fish in deep water, Capt. Bob gave 
up and headed toward shore. The crew set anchor south of Crystal Cove just a 
few hundred yards offshore, and the fishermen cast from the stern. They should 
have good luck with calico bass in this spot, the captain explained over the 
loudspeaker. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Patrick, relief captain and deckhand, teased Peach by nudging his rod from 
behind, simulating a fish nibbling on the other end. Peach didn't even turn, 
just muttered, "Keep it up and I'll throw you in the water." 
</P>
<P>
Your luck will change, Gene. It'll change. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, on his first cast Peach reeled in a fat little calico. "Yeah, he caught 
a fish, he caught a fish," chanted Patrick, seizing the opportunity to josh the 
old fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
Pulling out the hook with a pair of pliers, Peach tossed the fish back in the 
water. It was not a keeper. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them I don't throw back I give away," he said. "I give them to people 
on the boat, people who don't catch any fish. I eat bass maybe one day a week, 
that's it." 
</P>
<P>
For the next half hour, Peach pulled in fish on nearly every cast. His luck 
continued on the trip back to port. The cards turned friendly, and he took hand 
after hand in poker. 
</P>
<P>
What lures Peach to this boat and this stretch of ocean are the people, the 
camaraderie, the feel of a fish hitting his line like a lightning bolt under 
the waves. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the companionship, the poker game, not getting bored riding in and out," 
he allows. "And it's just the thrill of hooking a fish. It's just still a 
thrill to me."

MALATHION IS STILL AN ISSUE, SAYS YUDELSON

GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Underscoring his campaign image as an activist and an environmentalist, 
Democratic Assembly candidate Jerry Yudelson and a group of Hollywood celebrity 
supporters sought Sunday to turn Orange County's outrage over malathion 
spraying into an election victory on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County's heaviest malathion spray area, all three candidates seeking 
the 72nd Assembly District seat -- including Yudelson's Democratic opponent, 
Tom Umberg -- have called for a halt to the aerial spraying. And state 
officials said the last scheduled aerial application of the pesticide in Orange 
County was completed last week. 
</P>
<P>
But at a noontime rally on a grassy field in Garden Grove that was sprayed just 
last Wednesday, Yudelson told a sparse audience of about 40 people that the 
issue must be kept alive or state officials will try again to eradicate the 
Medfly with helicopter spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"All we need is one more fly to be found and they will be back," he said. "If 
you have to go into the streets to protest your own government, I'll be there 
with you." 
</P>
<P>
Yudelson, whose wife, Jessica Stuart, is an actress, was joined by celebrities 
Gary Busey, Jan Smithers and James Brolin. Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic, who 
considered running for an Orange County congressional seat this year and is the 
subject of the movie "Born on the Fourth of July," also attended. 
</P>
<P>
Umberg, meanwhile, walked door-to-door in Westminster on Sunday as one of 
Orange County's most contentious campaigns of the year wound down toward the 
election. With just one day left, the two Democrats are competing in a race too 
close for experts to predict. The winner will face Assemblyman Curt Pringle 
(R-Garden Grove) in the November general election. 
</P>
<P>
The district includes parts of Garden Grove, Santa Ana, Westminster and 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The primary has been dominated by unabashed hostility between the candidates, 
which has split the loyalty of county Democrats and worried some that the 
contest might damage the party's chances of unseating Pringle. Democrats 
consider this seat their best chance in 1990 of breaking the GOP's lock on 
Orange County's state assembly seats.

STREET SMART: SIGN MARKING ON-RAMP ISN'T MUCH HELP TO MOTORISTS 
</P>

<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
I'd like to call attention to the sign for the Costa Mesa Freeway on Katella 
Avenue going west in Orange. It is almost at the freeway on-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
In order to go north, contrary to expectations, you have to be in the left 
lane. Anyone unfamiliar with the area would have great difficulty, especially 
in heavy traffic, to get over in time. What's more, the sign is almost 
completely obscured by leaves of a nearby tree. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Freedman 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
Ah ha, one of my own pet peeves. There are more than 300 freeway ramps in 
Orange County, and a fair percentage of them are flanked by signs that really 
don't do the best job of advising a motorist exactly what lane swings onto the 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Even local officials with the California Department of Transportation admit 
that there's room for improvement on this score. But they say there's 
insufficient money these days to pay for many upgrades of street signs that 
point the way to a freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The Katella Avenue on-ramp you speak of is particularly notorious because of 
its odd arrangement, which defies the typical setup of freeway ramps. Of 
course, the tree obscuring the sign doesn't help matters much. 
</P>
<P>
After being alerted to the problem, Caltrans officials promised to do something 
about the offending branches. But life is never easy. A Caltrans spokesman 
later said the tree is on private property, so it remains to be seen if the 
state, the city or the homeowner will get out the pruning sheers. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
I took a snapshot of a one-of-a-kind camper that I have designed and built as a 
hobby. I wanted to have a vehicle with more miles per gallon than is commonly 
characteristic of this kind of a recreational vehicle. With the aerodynamic 
body shape as shown, I was successful. The car gives better gas mileage now 
than it formerly did as a sedan, in spite of its increased cross-sectional 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The car started out as a six-passenger Chevrolet Impala. The new top is a shell 
of fiberglass plastic laid up in a mold that I built. I can stand up in the 
camper immediately behind the front seats and it has a queen-sized sleeping 
deck off the rear axle with storage underneath. The car weighs about the same 
now as it formerly did as a sedan. 
</P>
<P>
Richard B. Wilson 
</P>
<P>
Westminster 
</P>
<P>
Holy camper shell! Paint that thing black and Batman would kill to get a ride 
in it. 
</P>
<P>
Seriously, I commend your efforts, especially since your new Impala camper gets 
better gas mileage than the original clunker. Goodness knows, most recreational 
vehicles are gas guzzlers. 
</P>
<P>
I should know. My father owns an RV. The thing gets about two miles a gallon 
but could sleep the starting offense of the Rams. Even with massive fuel tanks, 
dear dad seems to be stopping for gas about every fifth freeway exit. 
</P>
<P>
Richard B. Wilson should be an example to us all. I would like to see other 
folks send in snapshots of their bold automotive creations. There's a little 
Preston Tucker in us all, so get busy with that blow torch and drop a line to 
Street Smart. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that car-pool lanes were devised to reduce the number of cars on 
the freeways by giving car-poolers an advantage. The question I have is what 
makes a car a car pool? 
</P>
<P>
In my opinion, a motorist with a baby or a small child or a non-driving senior 
citizen as a passenger should not be considered pool. These passengers do not 
reduce the number of cars on the freeways because they would not be driving by 
themselves anyway. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that the wording on the car-pool signs should read "2 drivers or 
more" instead of "2 persons or more." My two cats are as capable of driving as 
babies, children and non-driving senior citizens. Shouldn't I, therefore, be 
allowed to use the car-pool lane with them in the car? They are persons to me! 
</P>
<P>
Ute Hertel 
</P>
<P>
Irvine 
</P>
<P>
Don't laugh. My own cat thinks she's Mario Andretti. 
</P>
<P>
Your point, of course, is well taken. Even the rule makers at Caltrans 
sympathize with your position. But there are several problems with enacting 
car-pool lane rules that discriminate based on age. 
</P>
<P>
"It becomes an enforcement problem," said Joe El-Harake, commuter lanes 
coordinator for Caltrans in Orange County. "And it complicates signage, too." 
</P>
<P>
El-Harake cited the example of a mother who picks up the children of another 
woman to get them to school. By doing so, she is eliminating a freeway trip the 
other mother would have taken. 
</P>
<P>
Another example: How would a Highway Patrol officer know if that gray-haired 
man in the passenger seat is a driver? 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, car-pool lane rules will never be perfect, nor will they always 
act to do the job originally intended -- to get drivers to buddy up and ease 
the congestion on our freeways.

LOWRIDERS DRAW HIGH PRAISE AT SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Ramos looked at the restored dark green 1948 Chevrolet Fleetwood, complete 
with the optional dash electric razor, that his car club was displaying at 
Sunday's second annual Salsa Custom Lowrider Show and Family Fiesta, and beamed 
with what he called "Latino pride." 
</P>
<P>
"This is all part of our culture," said the 28-year-old vice president of the 
Orange County chapter of the Dukes. "It's not involved with gangs, it's safe 
and it's a good investment." 
</P>
<P>
Whether they had classic oldies like Ramos' club's or the newer "tricked-out" 
mini-trucks equipped with hydraulic, jumping suspensions and exotic paint jobs, 
the exhibitors at the show said the cars are much more than just unique sets of 
wheels. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a whole lifestyle," boasted 29-year-old Art Vazicaion, who owns a yellow, 
1984 Isuzu truck with an $8,000 stereo system. 
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 people attended the show at the Orange County Fairgrounds. It 
featured not only cars and trucks but also authentic Latino food, art, crafts, 
music and dance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really cool to walk around here. There's lots to see," said Rosa Mera, 
16, of El Toro. "The guys are pretty cute too." 
</P>
<P>
But for the most part, the 500 vehicles were the main attraction. 
</P>
<P>
Alfonzo Serrano showed passers-by his cousin's lowriding 1978 Cadillac Coup de 
Ville painted psychedelic colors. 
</P>
<P>
"He's put at least $15,000 into this," Serrano said. "There's chrome on the 
brakes and 14-karat gold on parts underneath the car." Pointing to the apricot 
interior he said, "These seats alone cost $3,000." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the traditional lowriding Chevrolet Impalas, there were 
Mercedeses, Porsches, BMWs and even Suzuki Samurais built to hug the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Woods was showing off a 1988 white Mercedes with flashy gold rims and 
about a six-inch ground clearance. 
</P>
<P>
"I do these conversions for a living," he said. He smiled as he looked at the 
car, which he charged a man in Tennessee $22,000 to customize. "I'm not saying 
it's done in good taste or bad taste . . . this one is a little gaudy." 
</P>
<P>
Mini-truck lowriders with high riding hydraulic beds were also a big draw. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really amazing what these trucks can do," said Jeanne Sleeper, a 
spokeswoman for Inter-Shows, which organized the event. "They shoot up into the 
air and do 360s," she said. MATT LAIT

PEOPLE FLEE TO BEACH AS THE MERCURY SOARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Record-breaking temperatures in parts of Orange County sent tens of thousands 
of people to the beach on Sunday, while a dense layer of smog prompted health 
officials to urge those most affected to stay inside. 
</P>
<P>
The mercury was pushed to 91 degrees in Santa Ana on Sunday, breaking a 
previous record temperature of 89 degrees set in 1957, said Steve Burback, a 
meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides weather information for The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
Burback said record temperatures were probably set in other parts of the county 
as well, but immediate information was not available. Temperatures "should 
start cooling off by a couple of degrees on Monday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim reported the highest temperature in the county at 94 degrees, according 
to WeatherData. 
</P>
<P>
To escape the weather, thousands of people flocked to the county's beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the most crowded day we've had so far this year," said Huntington 
Beach lifeguard Brent Peters, who estimated that more than 60,000 people showed 
up on that city's beaches. 
</P>
<P>
The hot weather was aggravated by a thick layer of smog, which prompted the 
South Coast Air Quality Management District to call a first-stage smog alert in 
North Orange County. A stage-one alert means that a potential health hazard 
exists. 
</P>
<P>
A first-stage episode usually affects only smog-sensitive people with chronic 
lung or heart disease, the elderly, the chronically ill and youngsters who are 
exercising. A more advanced-stage smog alert indicates a possible hazard to 
everyone.

SPILL DOESN'T SPOIL KEARNS' BICYCLE RIDE TO VICTORY

<P>
Brad Kearns had a big lead after the bicycle leg of the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center Triathlon Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
His lead was big enough that even after taking a spill during the transition to 
the running leg, Kearns was still able to win the race by 52 seconds, finishing 
in 1 hour 49 minutes 33 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Welch was second in 1:50:25. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I got a little too excited," Kearns said about his accident. "I 
haven't been (that far) in the lead (after the cycling leg) like that before." 
</P>
<P>
Kearns, 25, said he accidentally locked his front brake while coasting toward 
his rack and fell over the front end of his bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
After racing poorly on the bicycle leg of the biathlon in Irvine May 27, Kearns 
said he was trying hard to improve. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't ride too well (in the biathlon), but it was a good experience," 
Kearns said. "It motivated me for this one." 
</P>
<P>
Kearns, who lives in Malibu, placed sixth in the biathlon. 
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's triathlon, Kearns emerged from the 1.5-kilometer swim in Lake 
Mission Viejo somewhere in the pack behind Andrew Carlson of Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
But Kearns said he "never rode so well, ever," as he did on the 40K bicycle 
ride that followed. 
</P>
<P>
Kearns came into the transition area to rack his bicycle before the 10K run two 
minutes ahead of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
Colleen Cannon, winner of the women's professional division in 1988, won again 
Sunday after battling second-place finisher Karen Smyer throughout the race. 
</P>
<P>
Kearns and Cannon each received $2,000 for winning the professional divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Cannon, 29, said she broke away from Smyer and the rest of the pack about a 
mile into the run but was pushed hard by Smyer for the whole 10 kilometers. 
</P>
<P>
"Karen's such a fabulous runner, you just never know," said Cannon, who lives 
in Nederland, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
But Smyer, of Medford, Me., said she knew Cannon was running too hard for her 
to pass when she broke away. So Smyer held back, waiting for a chance to take 
the lead. That chance never came. 
</P>
<P>
"She came up on me so quickly," Smyer said. "She was just there. And she passed 
me with such confidence. . . . She goes as quickly as she needs to, to be in 
first." 
</P>
<P>
Cannon finished in 2:02:46 and Smyer finished in 2:03:02. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Tinley, winner of four Performing Arts Center Triathlons, including last 
year's race, finished third among the men Sunday, in 1:51:33. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a way, way more competitive field than we've had here in the past," 
Tinley said. 
</P>
<P>
Tinley, from Del Mar, lost second place to Welch. 
</P>
<P>
"He's probably one of the strongest runners on the course," Tinley said of 
Welch. 
</P>
<P>
Welch, 25, estimated that he picked up about 50 seconds during the run after 
coming off the bicycle course in third place in a tight pack. 
</P>
<P>
"(The run is) my favorite leg," said Welch, a native of Australia now residing 
in Del Mar. "I work hard on it. I'm going to have to work harder on my swimming 
and biking so, hopefully, I can crack a few of those wins." 
</P>
<P>
Kearns, Welch and Tinley were followed by Stephan Foster of Leucadia, Bryan 
Fahrenbach of Clovis, and Nick Taylor of Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Carlson, who led after the swimming leg, finished 19th in 1:58:43. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
In the women's professional division, Colleen Cannon and Karen Smyer were 
followed in the top five by Laurie Samuelson of Cupertino, Melissa Mantak of 
Denver and Kimberly Cohen of Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Local triathletes finishing among the top 40 men were Bob Belzer of Irvine 
(16th), Kerry Classon of Mission Viejo (31st), Rick Mountain of Anaheim (33rd), 
Michael Herman of Laguna Niguel (35th), Walter Morris of Laguna Beach (36th) 
and Craig Calvin of Mission Viejo (37th). 
</P>
<P>
Local triathletes who finished among the top 40 women were Gina Aubrey of San 
Clemente (23rd), Claudia Beristain of Mission Viejo (26th), Marilyn Ganahl of 
Orange (28th), Laura Anthony of Capistrano Beach (33rd), Annette Batley of 
Laguna Niguel (36th), Schery Braunhardt of Fullerton (39th), and Joan Jeter of 
Newport Beach (40th). 
</P>
<P>
The top relay team, called "Your Name Here," from Irvine finished in 1:51:17.

NEWFIELD FEELS HEAT OF DRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baseball scouts have compared Marc Newfield to Cincinnati Reds slugger Eric 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
And if the projections of Baseball America magazine hold true, Newfield and 
Davis could someday be teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball America projects the Marina High School first baseman as the No. 8 
pick in today's amateur draft, and the Reds own the seventh pick. 
</P>
<P>
"They say I have the same stance as Davis does and I approach the plate the 
same way he does," said Newfield, 6 feet 4, 205 pounds. "They say my swing 
looks like (Darryl) Strawberry's." 
</P>
<P>
Does he mind the comparisons? 
</P>
<P>
"No, I kind of like that," Newfield said. "It's great be compared to a pro 
player." 
</P>
<P>
By this afternoon, he could be one. 
</P>
<P>
Scouts have assured Newfield that he will be drafted in the first round. The 
only question left is how much of a signing bonus he'll get. 
</P>
<P>
Newfield has been recruited by Arizona State, Cal State Fullerton, Cal State 
Long Beach and the University of the Pacific, but says he will probably attend 
a junior college if he doesn't turn professional. 
</P>
<P>
Junior college players are eligible for the draft after one season while 
players at four-year colleges must stay in school at least three years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll probably go to Rancho Santiago or Golden West," said Newfield, who has a 
2.5 grade-point average but said he scored 690 points on his first attempt at 
the Scholastic Aptitude Test, 10 points shy of the NCAA requirement for 
freshman eligibility. "I'll probably play there a year and then sign (with a 
pro team) or transfer to a bigger school." 
</P>
<P>
If he decides to play professional baseball, Newfield can't sign a contract. 
He's only 17 and will need his parents, Richard and Dee, to sign for him. 
</P>
<P>
"It all depends on the money and stuff, and what my parents think," Newfield 
said. "They'll have a lot to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
Newfield said he has no minimum for a signing bonus, although he is almost 
guaranteed a six-figure signing bonus if he's taken in the first round. The 
smallest bonus for a first-rounder last year was $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to wait and see what first and second picks get and base my bonus 
on that," Newfield said. "I have no set amount. It'll be whatever they (club) 
think I'm worth." 
</P>
<P>
This weekend has been a busy one for Newfield, a senior first baseman. He was 
one for four and scored twice Saturday in the Vikings' 6-4 victory over Diamond 
Bar in the Southern Section 5-A championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Newfield, a designated hitter who moved to first base last summer, said scouts 
told him he will move to the outfield in the pros. 
</P>
<P>
Newfield, who hit .481 with four homers and 37 hits during the regular season, 
has been named the California Player of the Year by Scholastic Coach Magazine. 
He's one of 46 state winners who are eligible to be named the Gatorade Circle 
of Champions National Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball America lists Newfield as the third-best power hitter in high school 
behind Tony Clark of El Cajon Christian and Adam Hyzdu of Moeller High in 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Newfield's stock has risen quickly even though he hit only four home runs in 
the regular season, six fewer than last year. He wasn't even rated in Baseball 
America's preseason list, but was the magazine's best high school first baseman 
by midseason. 
</P>
<P>
Marina Coach Paul Renfrow said Newfield's statistics this season are deceiving. 
Pitchers are more wary of Newfield's reputation this season, and give him few 
pitches he can hit. 
</P>
<P>
Newfield, who bats right-handed, led the county in home runs last season with 
10 and was expected to challenge the county record of 12. Instead, that honor 
went to Fullerton High junior D.C. Olsen, who had 13. 
</P>
<P>
Still, news of Newfield's hitting has spread. As many as 30 scouts have lined 
the backstop at Marina games and practices. Newfield has a collection of their 
business cards on his dresser in his Huntington Beach home. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Phillies own the No. 3 pick in the draft, a Philadelphia newspaper 
has charted his progress the last few weeks. Reporters from Detroit papers have 
interviewed him, wondering if the Tigers will draft him with the second 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
The team that has shown the most interest is the Seattle Mariners, who have the 
sixth pick. 
</P>
<P>
Renfrow has said the attention and pressure have bothered Newfield. The once 
easy-going player now gets nervous before games. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been real fun," Newfield said. "I've been enjoying it, but it has been 
pretty hectic, too." 
</P>
<P>
Volleyball is the fastest-growing sport in the Southern Section, and it appears 
to be growing too fast for some. 
</P>
<P>
Consider what happened at the Southern Section 4-A finals May 26 at Marina High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 fans waiting for the start of the 4-A game between Edison and Mira 
Costa stood outside for more than an hour while the 3-A game between Brentwood 
and Arcadia went five games. 
</P>
<P>
Marina's gym seats 2,500, but it was filled to capacity with fans for the 3-A 
game and early arrivals for the 4-A game. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-A match started at 5:30 p.m., but pushed the 4-A title game past its 
scheduled start of 7:30 by an hour and a half. The mob of fans were let inside 
after the 3-A game was finished and the Arcadia and Brentwood fans had gone. 
</P>
<P>
Edison Coach Brian Rofer said the finals "weren't very well organized." 
</P>
<P>
"The sport's getting bigger and the players are getting better, (but) the 
administration is not keeping up with it," Rofer said. "The CIF did the best it 
could, but someone needs to step in there and do something." 
</P>
<P>
One idea would be to move the event to a larger arena, which Southern Section 
officials say they haven't considered in the past because crowds weren't as 
large. The volleyball finals have been held at the Marina or Westminster High

Words not to be minced: Saddleback distance runner Robby Price has a 4.5 
cumulative grade-point average and was a National Merit Scholarship finalist. 
But perhaps the reason Price was chosen over nearly 600 applicants to be the 
CIF Southern Section Scholar Athlete of the Year lies in his essay, "The Value 
of Participation in High School Athletics." 
</P>
<P>
An excerpt: 
</P>
<P>
"Sports teach the establishment of long term goals, an outlook toward 
investment in the future, and instill an orientation toward delayed 
gratification," wrote Price. "These attitudes transcend merely athletic 
parameters, and apply to virtually every facet of life. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Perseverance becomes the modus operandi of every effort, be it the acquisition 
of knowledge through education, faith through devotion, or financial security 
through personal management. Sports mold the universally relevant behavioral 
characteristics that are prerequisite to success, to victory in life. . . . "

BRIGGS AND KRONEMANN TEAM UP TO WIN AGAIN

After a year's separation, Mike Briggs and Trevor Kronemann held a tennis 
reunion they hope to make permanent. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in identical beach-cum-tennis outfits, Briggs and Kronemann, who as UC 
Irvine teammates last year lost in the NCAA finals, defeated Ian Aler and Craig 
Johnson, 6-4, 6-7 (6-8), 6-3, in the finals of the men's open division of the 
Adoption Guild Charity tournament at the Newport Beach Tennis Club Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's open final, Kathy May Paben and Stephanie Rehe defeated Linda 
Howell and Barbara Gerken, 6-7 (7-3), 6-4, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Briggs turned professional after his sophomore season at Irvine, so he and 
Kronemann never got the chance to return to the NCAA final, which they lost to 
Eric Amend and Byron Black of USC last year. But now that Kronemann, who 
accepted his share of the $4,000 that went to the winning men's team Sunday, 
has completed his collegiate eligibility, the two plan to get together again. 
</P>
<P>
Kronemann likely will play Team Tennis, possibly with the Charlotte Heat, and 
once that is over, he said he and Briggs will team up again with their sights 
on qualifying for the French Open next year. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine tennis Coach Greg Patton put the reunion into his usual hyperbolic 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like two guys who were just dating other girls and couldn't wait to get 
back to their true love," Patton said. 
</P>
<P>
Briggs said it was like Bonnie and Clyde reuniting. Kronemann used another 
analogy about lovers. "He brings out the best in me and I bring out the best in 
him," Kronemann said. 
</P>
<P>
Briggs and Kronemann struggled to hold serve early in the first set, but by the 
finish of the set they were pumping their fists and rousing the crowd with 
spectacular plays at the net, winning, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the second set, Aler and Johnson broke Briggs, who was serving for the 
match at 5-4. Aler and Johnson later forced a tiebreaker and won it. But Aler 
was broken early in the third set and Briggs and Kronemann took a 3-0 lead and 
held serve for the match. 
</P>
<P>
The women's title was won by Rehe and May Paben, a pair of professional players 
on the mend. May Paben, 33, retired from the tour nine years ago. Then known as 
Kathy May or Kathy May Teacher, she was ranked as high as 10th in the world. 
Rehe, 20, was ranked 14th when she was knocked off the tour in November, 1988 
after injuring her back in a car accident.

Baseball's June draft begins today, a matter of vital interest to many Orange 
County players. But the fascination is gone for at least three. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Tewell of Cypress College, Gary Christopherson of Golden West and David 
Stevens of Fullerton College all signed minor league contracts last week. 
</P>
<P>
Each was drafted last June but didn't sign. Teams retain the rights of unsigned 
players until the next draft (this year's draft starts today and continues 
through Wednesday) with only results of the first round made public. 
</P>
<P>
Tewell, a catcher, was picked last June by the Philadelphia Phillies after a 
successful freshman season at Cypress in which he earned all-Orange Empire 
Conference team honors. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies did not make a genuine effort to sign Tewell, but told him they 
would try to sign him if his sophomore season went as well. Tewell hit .343 
with six home runs, 42 runs batted in and 12 steals this season, and was an 
all-conference selection again. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies started talking with Tewell May 10, and the sides reached 
agreement last week. 
</P>
<P>
Signing early was one of three alternatives for Tewell. He could have waited 
for today's draft, or gone to Cal State Fullerton, to which he had made an oral 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
"It was good to have options," Tewell said. "We went back and forth until the 
offer was right. It's a good organization and it seemed right. It hasn't really 
hit me that I'm going to play professionally, but it's getting closer." 
</P>
<P>
Tewell will report later this week to the Phillies' minor league camp in 
Clearwater, Fla., where he will be given his assignment. 
</P>
<P>
Christopherson, who plays both third base and first, and Stevens, a pitcher, 
will skip their sophomore seasons to try the minors. 
</P>
<P>
Christopherson is the cousin of San Diego State catcher Eric Christopherson, a 
highly regarded prospect who is expected to be selected in the first two 
rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Christopherson didn't want to wait to see how he would fare in this year's 
draft, so he signed with the Astros, who picked him last June when he was a 
senior at Ocean View High School. 
</P>
<P>
"The time was right," said Christopherson, who hit .386 with 10 home runs and 
51 RBIs for Golden West. "It sounded like a good opportunity, so I took it." 
</P>
<P>
Christopherson will report this week to the Astros' rookie league team in 
Kissimmee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, who had a 4.21 earned-run average with a team-leading three saves, 
signed with the Cubs, who picked him last June out of La Habra High School. 
</P>
<P>
He will report this week to the Cubs' Class-A Appalachian League team at 
Huntington, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
Draft trivia: Who was the first player taken in the initial draft in 1965 and 
by what team? Also, who is the only drafted player to reach the baseball Hall 
of Fame? 
</P>
<P>
Answers below. 
</P>
<P>
Five players with Orange County connections are listed in Baseball America's 
top 100 draft list. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine lists Marc Newfield of Marina High School as the third-best high 
school power hitter and predicted he will be the No. 8 pick overall. 
</P>
<P>
Other local players listed: 
</P>
<P>
No. 23 -- Catcher Eric Christopherson. 
</P>
<P>
No. 34 -- Outfielder Gary Mota of Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
No. 51 -- Infielder Bret Boone of USC and El Dorado High. 
</P>
<P>
No. 73 -- Pitcher John Cummings of USC and Canyon High School. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine also lists the number of players taken from each state in the 
first 25 years of the draft. 
</P>
<P>
California is by far the leader with 8,555. Florida (2,747) is second and Texas 
(1,825) is third. Alaska is last with three. 
</P>
<P>
In the first 25 years of the draft, the Angels had the first pick only once -- 
in 1975. That year they took catcher Danny Goodwin of Southern University. 
</P>
<P>
Goodwin reached the majors with the Angels, playing in four games at the end of 
the same year. He went on to play for the Twins and Athletics, and left 
baseball after the 1982 season. 
</P>
<P>
In his career, he played in 252 games and hit .236 with 13 home runs and 81 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Goodwin also was the only player to be picked as the top selection twice. He 
was the No. 1 pick in 1971 out of high school in Peoria, Ill., by the White 
Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Goodwin and the White Sox couldn't reach terms and he elected to attend 
Southern University. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answers: Rick Monday was the No. 1 selection of the Kansas City 
Athletics in 1965 out of Arizona State. Johnny Bench, a second-round pick of 
the Reds in 1965, was inducted into the Hall of Fame last year.

SUAVE TONY BENNETT SINGS HIS HEART OUT AT O.C. ARTS CENTER

<P>
Near the end of his performance Saturday night, Tony Bennett said some nice 
things about the sound at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, then asked 
that the microphones be turned off. 
</P>
<P>
The rendition of "Fly Me to the Moon" that followed was the evening's most 
revealing moment. A hushed, capacity crowd hung on Bennett's every word as the 
singer projected his husky baritone to different parts of the hall and up to 
the balcony. His strengths (a strong sense of phrasing and an honest ability to 
convey a lyric's feeling), as well as his weakness (an occasional tendency to 
wander off-key), were there for all to hear at a very delicate volume. It was a 
gutsy thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
Though it's not unusual for Bennett to do an unamplified number during a 
performance, this time it was especially welcome because for much of the 
evening, his voice was overamplified and, at times, irritatingly loud. 
Crescendos and big, strong endings -- Bennett's favorite way to close a tune -- 
were a little hard on the ears, though not through any fault of the vocalist. 
</P>
<P>
Overlook the amplification problem and Bennett's appearance was all his fans 
could have wished for. His repertoire represents an impeccable selection of 
classics (which he credited to his longtime associate and pianist Ralph Sharon) 
from such composers as Irving Berlin, Johnny Mercer and the Gershwin brothers, 
as well as a couple of new numbers pulled from his latest album, "Astoria: 
Portrait of the Artist." They were all delivered with the usual Bennett flair 
for milking a lyric of all its meaning. Bennett looked fit as he hopped on and 
off the bandstand, and his voice carried the strength that has been his 
trademark for 40 some years. 
</P>
<P>
The singer's suave rhythmic sense came through best during jazz tempos. His 
ballad-paced "Autumn Leaves" had him suggestively following just a step behind 
the beat. "The Girl I Love," Ira Gershwin's verse for his brother's "The Man I 
Love," broke from its relaxed tempo into upbeat swing with Bennett's hardy 
scat. He treated Ogden Nash's lyric to Kurt Weill's "Speak Low," supported only 
by bassist Paul Langosch's sturdy walking bass, in considered, thoughtful tones 
that came as a breathy whisper. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon, Langosch and drummer Joe LaBarbera provided firm accompaniment that 
never overshadowed what the singer was doing. Pianist Sharon's brief solo 
during "A Little Street Where Old Friends Meet" from the new album was sweet, 
yet to the point. The keyboardist has an agile right hand and a smart way with 
fills and embellishments. 
</P>
<P>
But the night belonged to Bennett, who showed that his emotive powers are well 
intact. For a guy who claims night after night to have left that vital organ 
somewhere up in San Francisco, Bennett showed a lot of heart. 
</P>
<P>
Preceding the singer was the 14-piece vocal group, the Californians, doing a 
medley of Academy Award-winning music from years past. The singers' strong 
ensemble work was marred by needless announcements of song titles that covered 
voices and broke the flow of the program. 
</P>
<P>
The evening opened with the Master Chorale of Orange County (and orchestra) 
performing medleys of movie classics under the spirited direction of William 
Hall. The program, "Sing a Song of Hollywood," relied on projected visual 
images and even some recorded dialogue from "Casablanca" to supplement the 
chorale's mostly competent presentation.

PERCUSSIONIST GIVES RECITAL AT ART MUSEUM

First impressions can be deceiving when considering the music of 
percussionist-composer Ron George. Although his compositions generally use 
simple ideas in easy ways, they are not always easily comprehended. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night at Newport Harbor Art Museum, George gave a recital of three of 
his works (plus another work written for him) that displayed this paradox 
between simplicity and deeply meditative esoterica. 
</P>
<P>
Half the program utilized his visually spectacular, carefully designed 
percussion setup -- dubbed the "ballad console" -- while two other smaller 
setups derived from it served in the other half. Unobtrusive prerecorded 
percussion sounds also were used sparingly in two of the works. 
</P>
<P>
Due to the small size of the room used, the space was thoroughly saturated with 
the sound (at times deafening) of the large gongs, tam-tams, modified 
vibraphone ("super vibe"), marimba, chimes, bells and other found objects that 
constituted George's homemade, piecemeal instruments. Nearby, uninsulated, 
exposed pipes added an unintended whooshing sound every time the commode in an 
adjacent washroom was flushed. 
</P>
<P>
But the music oddly maintained its fragility throughout. Sometimes it lulled, 
but more often it fascinated with its unusual, overpowering inwardness. 
</P>
<P>
In three tonal pieces from "Album of Lullabies" -- described as a piece in 
progress for super vibe and electronics -- George explored a range of 
improvisatory, childlike ideas. Between pieces, his similarly elementary 
explanations and demonstrations revealed a remarkably gentle personality -- 
almost like a Zen version of Mister Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
Two other of George's works proved equally engaging: the tonally pulsating 
"Improv on a Broken Nose" -- another work in progress for ballad console and 
electronics -- and the lyrical, metallic study "Variations on a Butterfly" 
(1988) for a series of graduated gongs and bells. Opening the program, a 1973 
opus for ballad console by Joseph Julian, "Windows and Clouds," satisfactorily 
ran the gamut of sounds offered by the instrument, creating a routine but 
pleasant collage of timbres and sound effects.

GARDEN GROVE SYMPHONY CLOSES ITS SEASON

GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe it was the heat. Perhaps it was the hall. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the cause, the Garden Grove Symphony spent the first half of its 
season finale Saturday making music in a decidedly inconsistent manner. Guest 
conductor Philippe Bender, director of the Orchestre Regional de 
Cannes-Provence, did a great deal more than just beat time and oversee 
orchestral traffic, yet memorable results of a positive nature were a long time 
in coming. 
</P>
<P>
Billed "A French Gala," the proceedings opened with Berlioz's Overture to 
"Benvenuto Cellini." Bender mustered a mighty sound, impressive if one could 
overlook its blaring and diffused quality. The quieter moments fared no better, 
rife with ragged entrances and questionable intonation. 
</P>
<P>
The normally suitable Don Wash Auditorium revealed its true place in the scheme 
of things as a high-school facility first, symphony hall a distant second. More 
than adequate on previous occasions, it proved barely able to support an 
ensemble of Berliozian girth. In roaring fortissimos, several hardy string 
players appeared ready to spill right over the edge of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Of course the piano didn't help the space problem, but they had to have it for 
Ravel's Piano Concerto in G. Or did they? As matters turned out, this usually 
scintillating masterpiece had (on the whole) all the musical personality of a 
fallen souffle. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Deborah Kiszely displayed occasional glimpses of substantial talent, 
particularly when unfettered by the orchestra in the extended solo opening the 
second movement. But the first movement transpired in slow motion, the 
rhapsodic central passages reduced to a virtual standstill. Even generous doses 
of sass and insouciance, however, would not have obviated careless orchestral 
transitions and phrasing. 
</P>
<P>
So just when one began to dread sitting through a potentially deadly reading of 
Franck's Symphony in D-minor, a minor miracle occurred. Bender showed that his 
podium skills not only look right, but can produce music that sounds right. And 
the Garden Grove Symphony reminded us that at its best it is far more than just 
another little orchestra south of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The warhorse had sweep and power to be sure, but subtlety of dynamic shading 
was in welcome abundance as well. Bender persuasively delineated both inner and 
overall structures, culminating in climaxes of inevitability, rather than 
predictability. The push-button standing ovation was a little slow in coming, 
but the crowd eventually staggered to its collective feet. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was the heat.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clean Air Act 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 401 to 21, the House sent to a conference with the Senate a bill 
(HR 3030) giving the Clean Air Act its first upgrade since 1977. In part, the 
measure drastically cuts emissions from Midwest and Appalachian power plants 
that cause acid rain, imposes tailpipe controls on motor vehicles and 
introduces cleaner gasoline to cities with the dirtiest air. 
</P>
<P>
It curbs the discharge of a wide range of toxic chemicals from factories such 
as petrochemical plants and harmful emissions from small businesses such as dry 
cleaners. Estimates are that the bill will cost the private sector up to $20 
billion over the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Norman F. Lent (R-N.Y.) said the bill "will significantly improve the 
air we breathe without placing the American economy in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) said, "This should be renamed the 
Third World Redevelopment Act of 1990" because it exports many jobs. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported the bill.

New Relief Program 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 274 to 146, the House adopted an amendment establishing special 
relief for workers who lose their jobs or have their hours reduced by at least 
20% as a result of the new Clean Air Act. The maximum benefit would be an 
additional six months of unemployment payments and two years of retraining 
assistance, at a cost to the Treasury of up to $250 million over five years. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Harley O. Staggers Jr. (D-W.Va.) said, "This is a vote for the little 
guys" such as coal miners who lose work because of the Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Jack Fields (R-Tex.) called the program "an open-ended liability for 
the federal government." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported special aid to workers hurt by new clean-air legislation.

Longer Warranties 
</P>
<P>
The House adopted, 239 to 180, an amendment toughening warranties on the 
catalytic converters and electronic control units needed to meet tailpipe 
emission standards set by the new clean-air legislation. Auto makers would have 
to provide eight-year, 80,000-mile protection on the equipment, compared to the 
five years and 50,000 miles required by current law.

D.A. SPECIAL UNIT AIMS TO CLEAN UP ON COUNTY POLLUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jonathan Weber, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the public discovers environmental protection, prosecutors are discovering 
environmental crime. From the Justice Department in Washington to city 
attorney's offices around the country, environmental protection has suddenly 
become a front-burner issue, and new resources are being devoted to the complex 
task of enforcing pollution laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental crimes can range from clandestine dumping of toxic waste to 
unauthorized emissions of chemicals to violations of obscure monitoring or 
record-keeping rules. In the past, most such transgressions drew only small 
fines or warnings, and criminal prosecutions were rare. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, empowered by new legislation beefing up the penalties for many 
environmental crimes, prosecutors are seeking felony convictions carrying heavy 
fines and jail sentences for polluters. Illegal dumping accounts for the most 
serious cases, but less damaging violations of previously unenforced laws -- 
such as those requiring the monitoring of underground fuel tanks -- are also 
drawing attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The complexity of many environmental regulations, however, can make 
environmental prosecution a difficult business. Prosecutors must undertake 
lengthy investigations to determine the source of pollution, for example, and 
then make tricky judgments about who is ultimately responsible for it and how 
heavily they should be punished. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Orange County district attorney's office, the environmental crime unit 
has more than doubled in size over the past year, and now includes two 
full-time and one part-time deputy district attorneys, two investigators and a 
paralegal. Times staff writer Jonathan Weber recently spoke with unit 
supervisor Jan J. Nolan and deputies Christopher P. Kralick and Gerald G. 
Johnston about their priorities as environmental prosecutors and about how they 
handle some of the more difficult aspects of this new area of law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. What are some of the more serious environmental crime cases that have been 
prosecuted over the past several years? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nolan: First of all, you have to understand that this unit is fairly new. It 
started about four years ago, but in the past year we have had a significant 
change in personnel, and we have enlarged the unit. So we can go back about a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
One of our major current cases is against the Metropolitan Water District. 
Their plumbing system (allegedly) discharged some toxic chemicals into a creek 
in Santa Ana Canyon, and several bicyclists who rode through the creek suffered 
burns on their legs. So we have felony charges pending against the MWD, and we 
have misdemeanors against some of the officers and directors of the 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What other major cases are pending? 
</P>
<P>
A. Johnston: We are reviewing allegations against W.C. Richards Co. (operator 
of an Anaheim paint manufacturing plant). In that case, we were anonymously 
informed that the company was unlawfully disposing of its hazardous wastes, 
solvents and other things that were byproducts of the paint manfacturing 
process. Ordinarily, you have to manifest (register) these products and dispose 
of them at a proper facility. It's very expensive, about $500 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
What allegedly was happening at W.C. Richards was that employees each day were 
taking those waste products and mixing them with sawdust. They would then take 
that mixture and shovel it into a dumpster, which was put out for disposal at 
an ordinary landfill. As far as we know, all those substances went to the 
Brea-Olinda landfill, and under state law that is not a proper disposition of 
those kinds of waste. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You said that you got an anonymous tip. How do you generally find your leads 
in these kinds of cases? 
</P>
<P>
A. Johnston: In cases where you have unlawful dumping, you often have employees 
who are aware of it and become disgruntled, or become worried about their 
safety or the safety of others, and they will call some regulatory agency. 
Whatever agency hears about it will then usually come to our environmental 
crime task force, which meets once a month to discuss cases that have come up. 
From there, we will frequently initiate investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Who is on the task force? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nolan: It's chaired by our office, and it includes the California Highway 
Patrol, the Department of Fish and Game, the Health Services Department, the 
Regional Water Quality Control Board, the Orange County Sanitation District, 
the Orange County Environmental Management Agency, and the County Fire 
Department and local fire departments. The Air Quality Management District is 
part of it, and we hope to get them to start attending. 
</P>
<P>
Q. When was this task force put together? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nolan: About three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You said the task force meets once a month. How many cases are discussed at 
each meeting? 
</P>
<P>
A. Kralick: About 15 or 20. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston: And a lot of these things carry over from month to month. Many of 
these investigations are lengthy and complex, and it might take four or five or 
six months to put one of these cases together. We put together the 
investigations, and the agencies with the proper authority and interest will 
coordinate in different cases. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How many cases do you expect to prosecute this year? 
</P>
<P>
A. Johnston: Probably around 100. But we have a lot of cases coming in. 
Environmental awareness is expanding so much that many more agencies are now 
becoming interested and coming to us with the cases. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are the largest categories of violations? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nolan: About half will have to do with underground storage tanks. We've made 
a big effort in enforcing those rules. (Owners of underground storage tanks 
used for fuel and waste are required to monitor them for leaks and remove them 
if leaks are found.) 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are the other large categories of environmental crime? 
</P>
<P>
A. Kralick: Illegal disposal of hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston: Business emergency plans is another area where we have a lot of 
material coming in. 
</P>
<P>
Q. That's the requirement that businesses using hazardous materials have 
storage and emergency evacuation plans? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nolan: Yes. In most of those cases we're concentrating on compliance with 
the law rather than prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston: We also have quite a few smaller cases, involving dumping of 
materials into the bays and harbors. There is a real problem with that in 
Orange County, especially in Newport Harbor, and in Dana Point. The people in 
the boats are not always following the rules in regard to what they do with the 
waste from the toilets. 
</P>
<P>
The materials they dump tend to concentrate in the bays, and then you get 
production of coliform (fecal) bacteria and the water becomes unhealthy. So 
we're trying to do what we can to prosecute those cases when we can find them. 
We're getting the word out: You have to take more care in dumping waste from 
boats. 
</P>
<P>
Q. In cases where you have a choice, how do you decide whether to go for felony 
charges or misdemeanor charges? 
</P>
<P>
A. Johnston: It's a little hard to enumerate exactly, but I think it just 
depends on how serious we feel the conduct is, the degree of knowledge that the 
person had about the damage they were doing, the actual damage -- if we can 
figure it out -- and the volume and type of hazardous material. Generally, 
we're looking for someone who has dumped a significant quantity of hazardous 
material for us to file a felony. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How about the issue of knowing or not knowing? The law has been interpreted 
to say that you can bring felony charges even when someone didn't realize that 
what they were doing was illegal. Supposing someone has dumped a significant 
amount of waste, but the person really thought that the disposal method was 
proper when it wasn't. You could file felony charges, but some people might 
think that's not fair. 
</P>
<P>
A. Nolan: It depends on the amount of damage they have done, and the quantity 
of waste. In a situation like that, where they really didn't know, and there is 
a problem with whether or not they should have known, we also have the civil 
remedy. But based on that one element, we couldn't say whether we would file a 
felony. 
</P>
<P>
We would have to look at all the facts. It's a very serious situation for a 
corporation to have felony charges filed against them, so we don't take that 
lightly. On the other hand, neither do we take lightly what they do to our 
environment and community. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How do you decide between civil and criminal charges? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nolan: That's another very difficult evaluation. It's going to depend on 
culpability, on how egregious the conduct was, on the knowledge factor, on 
whether or not the officers and directors of the corporation were involved. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston: It's a difficult thing to quantify. You have to evaluate all the 
circumstances and do what you think is correct. 
</P>
<P>
Q. That seems like a pretty soft definition. There is a big difference between 
criminal and civil charges, and I would think there would be a more defined 
standard as to what is a criminal violation and what is not. 
</P>
<P>
A. Nolan: We look at every case from the aspect of filing criminally. That's 
what a prosecutors office does. We file criminally. If there is a lot of 
mitigating circumstance, such as a lack of knowledge, we may determine that 
it's better for the community and the corporation to handle the case civilly. 
Sometimes it may hurt the corporation more to go civil. But primarily we go 
criminal unless there is sufficient mitigation to go civil. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are some of the special difficulties involved in environmental 
prosecutions? You said these are often very complex and difficult cases. What 
makes them complicated? 
</P>
<P>
A. Kralick: The first problem is detection. When you have someone doing illegal 
disposal, it's the whole nature of illegal disposal to avoid detection in any 
way, shape or form. Then, even if you are detected, there is the question of 
who will be held ultimately responsible for that act. 
</P>
<P>
If you have an individual working for a company and operating a truck, and he 
just flushes the tanker (of hazardous material) in some vacant field, the 
question is whether he was acting under the authority and direction of some 
corporate officer, or just acting on his own to save time because he's running 
behind on his schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Then we have what you would have with any criminal case: lab reports, 
collection of the samples, preservation of the samples, analysis, getting the 
witnesses into court, and whatever is associated with any case. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston: In addition, there are complexities you wouldn't normally have. For 
one, the statutory framework is different. There is a large body of statutes 
and regulations that you wouldn't normally see. There are a lot of regulatory 
agencies that would potentially have jurisdiction, and that will require 
coordination to figure out who should be doing what. 
</P>
<P>
That's one reason we have the task force, to make sure all the proper 
authorities are in there and participating. To give an example: If we had a 
spill of solvents into the ground in a waterway, we might have the 
Environmental Management Agency, because it's a manmade waterway; the AQMD, 
because the solvents are evaporating into the atmosphere; the Health Care 
Agency, because it involves soil contamination; and the Regional Water Quality 
Board, because there is the potential that it could migrate into ground water. 
So there is a lot you have to think about any time these spills happen. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How much time do you spend on coordination? 
</P>
<P>
A. Kralick: We have an investigator, Kip Kinnings, who coordinates most of that 
for us. We're very lucky. He's very experienced, and has been doing this for a 
number of years, and he has developed very good communication with all the 
different agencies, which helps us tremendously. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you do any kind of special training to handle these cases? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nolan: When we enlarged the section, the deputies got together and decided 
it would be a good idea to go to classes at UC Irvine having to do with the 
regulatory framework, investigations and a series of other things. Also, the 
California District Attorneys Assn. puts on seminars, and recently they had a 
three-day seminar here in Garden Grove on environmental issues. In June, there 
will be an advanced seminar on environmental crime. It's a continual training 
process that we either do on our own or through the D.A.s' association. We're 
constantly learning. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Clearly, environmental crime is a rapidly growing field. Los Angeles Dist. 
Atty. Ira Reiner has made it a major priority in his office. How big a priority 
is it in this office? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nolan: In the last year, we have made it a bigger priority. Our district 
attorney, Mike Capizzi, has taken a great interest in this unit, allowed us to 
expand it with the deputies we have, and I've been told that if we need 
additional deputies to handle the workload, we certainly will get them. It's 
getting a lot of attention. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think you will need more deputies? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nolan: Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you have an ideal size in mind? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nolan: You never know where it's going. As environmental crime gets more 
attention, as more people call in with information, as we get more information 
from other agencies, we could grow up to 25 or 30 deputies. Let's hope it 
doesn't get that big, because a lot of our work here is prevention. As we get 
the word out about what we're doing and how we're working, we're hoping 
corporations will comply with the rules and we won't be in a position to have 
to expand the unit.

A 25-year-old man was arrested today and was being held in lieu of $250,000 
bond in connection with the fatal shooting of a 13-year-old youth and the 
injuring of four men in an Anaheim drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Edward Perez of Anaheim was arrested without incident in his 
apartment this morning, 12 hours after Sunday's shooting, Anaheim Lt. Marc 
Hedgpeth said. 
</P>
<P>
A second suspect is being sought, Hedgpeth added. 
</P>
<P>
Eulises Carranza Pineda, a seventh-grader at Anaheim's Sycamore Junior High 
School, was pronounced dead at Anaheim Memorial Hospital shortly after he was 
shot at 9:30 p.m. Sunday from the alley behind his apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
Listed in satisfactory condition this morning at two local hospitals were Jesus 
Gomez, 44; Jesus Gomez, 25; Mario Cruz, 23, and Hernan Cortes, 32, all of 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that two men in a car drove slowly down the alley behind 
the apartment in the 600 block of North Sabina Street and that the passenger 
shot into the courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
According to a resident at the scene, the four men who were wounded were 
drinking beer in the courtyard while Pineda was collecting bottles for his 
father to sell. 
</P>
<P>
Rasmon Sorias Barajas, who was drinking with the men, said the shooting was as 
a result of an earlier argument between the men in the apartment complex and 
the two men in the car.

Doctors today ran a battery of tests to find out what ails pop star Michael 
Jackson who was hospitalized late Sunday with chest pains after several days of 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
"He's undergoing several important tests today," said Jackson spokesman Bob 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it was a heart attack. He just experienced some discomfort. He 
had been feeling bad the past two or three days." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, 31, was rehearsing dance steps, which he uses as a form of exercise, 
at his Encino home when he began experiencing the chest pains Sunday night, 
Jones, said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was taken to the emergency room at St. John's Hospital and Health 
Center in Santa Monica about 9 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was staying in the same hospital as his friend Elizabeth Taylor, who 
has been recovering from a near-fatal bout of pneumonia and complications for 
nearly two months.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and former President Ronald Reagan, 
partners in breaking the Cold War ice in five summits, greeted each other 
warmly today and looked forward to closer East-West ties. 
</P>
<P>
The reunion in a midmorning coffee klatch with their wives gave Gorbachev an 
opportunity to enlist Reagan's help in winning conservative support for arms 
and trade pacts signed last week by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
For Reagan, the meeting marked one of his few moments back in the limelight 
since leaving office last year. They met at the home of the Soviet consul 
general, where the Gorbachevs slept after flying in late Sunday from 
Minneapolis-St. Paul, and spent a few minutes at the start gazing at a view of 
the Golden Gate Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan said he and Gorbachev discussed the independence drive of the Baltic 
states and other issues during their 40 minutes together. 
</P>
<P>
"We discussed the obstacles that must be overcome," Reagan said as he left 
holding a medal Gorbachev had given him for the American people in thanks for 
their help after the Armenian earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan declined to discuss specifics of their talk or comment on the summit 
between Gorbachev and Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who told U.S. officials he was tired and delayed the start of the 
Reagan breakfast 45 minutes, left immediately afterward for a speech at 
Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's 50-car motorcade reached Stanford shortly before noon, about an 
hour behind schedule. He was greeted by former Secretary of State George P. 
Shultz, university President Donald Kennedy and Sens. Alan Cranston and Pete 
Wilson of California. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of students, cheering "Gorby! Gorby!" welcomed the Soviet leader as 
he walked through the inner quad of the scenic campus. Gorbachev waded into the 
crowd, shaking hands with the students and smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Also left in his schedule: lunch with 150 captains of industry in oil, banking, 
food, entertainment, airlines, hotels, real estate and computers and a meeting 
with the South Korean president. The Soviet president heads home from San 
Francisco late today, wrapping up a seven-day North American visit. 
</P>
<P>
Former First Lady Nancy Reagan bristled at a question suggesting that she and 
Raisa Gorbachev once had a cool relationship. "I think there's been a great 
misunderstanding about our relationship," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Reagan characterized her hourlong meeting with Mrs. Gorbachev as "very 
nice." She wore a black and white outfit, while Mrs. Gorbachev had donned a 
more businesslike gray suit. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Reagan's kind words for Mrs. Gorbachev contrasted with her 
characterization of her in "My Turn," her memoir of her White House years. 
</P>
<P>
"From the moment we met, she talked and talked and talked -- so much that I 
could barely get a word in, edgewise or otherwise," Mrs. Reagan wrote. "Perhaps 
it was insecurity on her part, but during about a dozen encounters in three 
different countries, my fundamental impression of Raisa Gorbachev was that she 
never stopped talking. 
</P>
<P>
"Or lecturing, to be more accurate," Mrs. Reagan wrote.

Defense attorneys for Ray Buckey, the sole defendant remaining in the McMartin 
Pre-School molestation case, asked the judge today to acquit Buckey of five of 
the eight charges on which he is being retried. 
</P>
<P>
In a written motion, Danny Davis, the chief defense attorney, argued that 
prosecutors, who rested their case Friday, failed to present evidence in 
support of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
The motion will be argued Tuesday, after which time Superior Court Judge 
Stanley Weisberg will render his decision. Buckey, 32, is scheduled to testify 
that day.

Police closed off roads leading to Beijing's university area today after a 
protest in which hundreds of students hurled bricks and bottles at security 
forces on the anniversary of the bloody suppression of the pro-democracy 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
Rifle-toting police set up roadblocks near universities in northwest Beijing 
and stopped most cars from entering. 
</P>
<P>
All foreign journalists were turned back. 
</P>
<P>
One Western reporter saw three truckloads of riot police, armed with shields 
and rifles, entering the university area. Security forces armed with AK-47 
rifles also patrolled near Beijing University. 
</P>
<P>
About midnight Sunday, Western reporters outside Beijing University heard glass 
breaking and students clapping. Students hurled bottles and other objects at 
security forces on the street beneath their dormitory windows, setting off a 
campus rally of about 1,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
The protest was the boldest anti-government demonstration since troops crushed 
the pro-democracy movement one year ago, and it defied the heaviest security 
Beijing has seen since martial law was lifted in January.

A grim-looking Washington Mayor Marion Barry, accompanied by his wife and 
mother, appeared for the start of his trial on cocaine charges today, a 
criminal case peppered with sex, drugs, lies and videotape. 
</P>
<P>
A major challenge confronting both defense and prosecution was finding an 
unbiased jury to try the flamboyant city leader, who is in his 12th year in 
office and whose exploits have been the subject of intense publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Judge Thomas Jackson barred reporters and the public from the opening 
session while he read a statement to 100 prospective jurors who also filled in 
questionnaires to determine their impartiality. 
</P>
<P>
The normally up-beat Barry, 54, one of the best known and now the most 
notorious black mayor in the nation, looked unusually serious as he waved at 
several dozen photographers as he stepped from his limousine for the trial. 
</P>
<P>
He faces 14 charges of cocaine use, perjury and conspiracy involving cocaine 
dating to 1984, counts carrying a maximum 26 years in prison and $1,250,000 
fine upon conviction on all charges.

The racketeering trial of former Philippines First Lady Imelda Marcos, who was 
hospitalized after collapsing in court last week, was rescheduled today to 
resume June 12. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos was released from New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center on Sunday 
after being treated for a stomach ailment. She was taken to the hospital 
Thursday after coughing up blood and collapsing in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors diagnosed her condition as "erosive gastritis," an acid-related 
condition unrelated to Marcos's high blood pressure, which has twice forced 
postponement of the trial.

Robert Maxwell, a leading publisher in Britain who has gone on a buying spree 
in the U.S. publishing industry in recent years, said today he is in talks to 
buy a major American newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell, speaking at the annual meeting of one of his companies, Berlitz 
International Inc., declined to identify his target but said the property is 
valued "obviously in the mid-hundreds of millions." 
</P>
<P>
Speculation centered on the Tribune Co.'s high-circulation but marginally 
profitable New York Daily News. Its owner, the diversified publisher of the 
Chicago Tribune newspaper, said it has no comment. Tribune put the Daily News 
up for sale several years ago but then took it off the market. 
</P>
<P>
A quick sale of the Daily News would be difficult because of strained labor 
relations at the newspaper, where employees have been working for weeks without 
a contract, industry sources said.

The Supreme Court today strengthened the government's power to keep the taxes 
withheld from businesses about to declare bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Voting 9 to 0, the justices ruled that the trustee of bankrupt American 
International Airways is not entitled to recover $700,000 in taxes paid to the 
Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
The airline had become delinquent by the spring of 1984 in withholding Social 
Security and income taxes from employee wages and excise taxes collected from 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS then ordered the airline to file monthly, instead of quarterly, tax 
returns and open a special bank account to handle the tax deposits. 
</P>
<P>
American International filed for bankruptcy in July, 1984, to try to reorganize 
the business and pay off some of the money owed creditors. That effort failed, 
and three months later a trustee was appointed to liquidate the company. 
</P>
<P>
The trustee sought to recover $1.6 million in taxes paid to the IRS in the 
months leading up to the liquidation. 
</P>
<P>
A bankruptcy judge in Pennsylvania permitted the trustee to recover $700,000 
from the government and the IRS appealed to the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of 
Appeals based in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court said the trustee may not recover the $700,000.

"Late Night With David Letterman" debuted in 1982. Showcasing humorous pet

In 1987, Leno succeeded Joan Rivers as the sole guest host of "the Tonight Show

Their new contracts were announced at the annual NBC affiliates convention in

Most Americans would welcome cable television competition, according to a 
Gallup Poll released today by one of the telephone companies eager to get into 
the business. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of those surveyed also said they would like to have two-way video 
services -- such as movies on demand, library services and office-in-the-home 
-- that could be provided through a network of high-capacity, fiber-optic 
telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a clear indication that the public would favor competition and 
innovation," said Kent B. Foster, president of GTE Telephone Operations, which 
commissioned the study. 
</P>
<P>
The poll results were released as congressional committees, beset by 
constituent complaints of high prices and poor service, consider legislation to 
re-regulate the cable industry. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal by Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) would lift some provisions of the 
1984 Cable Act that prohibit companies such as GTE from providing video 
programming within their telephone service areas. 
</P>
<P>
Other federal laws prohibit the seven regional Bell companies from selling 
cable TV programming. In April, 1989, GTE won a five-year waiver from the 
Federal Communications Commission to build a cable TV system and test a 
state-of-the-art fiber-optic cable system in Cerritos, Calif., where GTE also 
offers phone service.

ask Tennessee Gov. Ned McWherter to move them to a minimum-security prison so 
they can get out to perform for churches, schools and civic groups. 
</P>
<P>
New Faith has been incorporated as a nonprofit ministry so any proceeds from 
their music will go to their crime victims, Dillard said. Lead singer Victor 
Shears, serving a life term for burglary, said he just wants to repay those he 
victimized. 
</P>
<P>
Dillard organized the singers while ministering to them in prison. He said the 
state refused to allow them to leave for recording sessions, so a temporary 
studio was built in the prison chapel. Two studio musicians came in every day 
to back up the singers.

Timothy Busfield plays a naval officer in the Broadway play "A Few Good Men," 
which means he had to shave the red beard he wears on "thirtysomething." 
</P>
<P>
Busfield told the New York Daily News that the beard was merely a gimmick to 
help him get the Elliot role on "thirtysomething." "I know I look young and, 
when I auditioned for the part four years ago, I wasn't even thirty-something," 
he said. "I was 29. But I wanted the part, so I figured one way of making 
myself look older was growing a beard. I kept putting off an audition until I 
thought it was full enough. Now I guess I'll have to start growing it again."

Robert Redford urged a new crop of university graduates to force politicians 
into ending a decade of "naked greed and profit at the expense of the 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
The actor and longtime environmental activist spoke Saturday at commencement 
ceremonies on the Boston campus of the University of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time to send a message to our elected officials that if they do not 
protect our environment, they will be voted out of office or never get elected 
in the first place," Redford said. 
</P>
<P>
Redford said the 1980s were devastating for the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"Never can I remember a time of such naked greed and profit at the expense of 
the environment as the last decade," he said.

IS ROBERT DE NIRO, the legendary "actor's actor," preparing to portray another 
legend of our time, Lech Walesa? Nobody has signed on the dotted line and De 
Niro's asking price is now way up there, but a team of Warner execs did jet to 
Poland to buy up all rights to Walesa's story. And Lech, although bemused by 
all the Hollywood types in their Armani suits, is said to be enthusiastic about 
the idea of De Niro playing him for the screen. If Lech's story gets De Niro 
and a green light from Warner, it would begin shooting early next year in 
Poland.

I HAVE been unable to speak to the principals in the domestic fracas of late, 
but the hot skinny is that Donald Trump is now trying to break down Ivana's 
resistance with his "charm" and get back on her good side. Recently, Mrs. Trump 
went almost three weeks without even speaking to her estranged mate. (I gather 
this is a matter of self-preservation because when they do speak, he upsets 
her.) I'm told Donald recently made an attempt to be affectionate and asked: 
"Will you still love me when I don't have any money?" Ivana reportedly snapped: 
"Yes. I already DID love you when you didn't have any money, remember?" 
</P>
<P>
Ivana made a quick trip to Czechoslovakia over the Memorial Day weekend with 
her father and son Donny. Upon return, she was furious to learn that Donald had 
not even seen their two younger children during the three-day holiday.

TOM HANKS was not working on "Bonfire of the Vanities" on the Memorial Day 
Saturday, but his wife, Rita Wilson, was. She plays a literary publicist who is 
at a party with principal actors Bruce Willis and F. Murray Abraham. Both 
Rita's character and Rita herself are visibly pregnant. The Hanks' real-life 
baby is due in August. Director Brian De Palma shaved off his beard to play a 
cameo as a guard in this same night's filming. It isn't that he likes to act, 
but it was the only way he could direct a 360-degree, fluid-motion Steadicam 
shot that goes on for five minutes without a cut. Said to be the longest moving 
shot in movie history, the camera follows Bruce Willis from an underground 
garage, along corridors, through a kitchen, up an elevator and finally into a 
formal dinner party at the Winter Garden in the World Financial Center.

BASKETBALL: THE OUSTED NORTH CAROLINA STATE COACH WILL TEAM UP WITH BRENT

<P>
Jim Valvano, forced out last winter as North Carolina State basketball coach, 
has agreed to a three-year deal with ABC for a reported $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Swanson, the president of ABC Sports, said Valvano will be teamed on 
college basketball telecasts with Brent Musburger, who recently signed with the 
network after being let go by CBS the day before he broadcast the NCAA final 
for that network. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano agreed to a buyout of his contract on April 7 after unsubstantiated 
allegations, made ironically by ABC News, that N.C. State players had been 
involved in fixed games. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano had also been criticized about a lack of academic progress in the 
program, which was placed on probation for violations involving complimentary 
tickets and sneakers. He finally agreed to have his lifetime contract bought 
out for $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson said he doesn't think Valvano will present image problems for the 
network. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the keys are a knowledge of basketball and the ability to 
communicate," he said. "We think Jim has both." 
</P>
<P>
Valvano said the problems at N.C. State might allow him to bring to 
broadcasting an insight into college athletics that others don't have. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand more than most analysts what is going on in college basketball 
today," he said. "I feel very comfortable in not just talking about a pick and 
roll and making a comical comment." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Jackson and Dick Vitale will be the other team for ABC, which will carry 
college basketball on 11 weekends next season.

SABATINI, CHESNOKOV JOIN THE RANKS OF TOP SEEDS STUMBLING IN FRANCE

<TEXT>
<P>
The French Open, already bereft of half a dozen top tennis players through 
early round upsets, lost another glamour player today when fourth-seeded 
Gabriela Sabatini was upset by 11th-seeded Jana Novotna of Czechoslovakia 6-4, 
7-5. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second year in a row that the 20-year-old Argentine was eliminated 
in the fourth round at the French and the second year in a row that Novotna has 
reached the quarters here. 
</P>
<P>
Also out was men's eighth seed Andrei Chesnokov, beaten in an emotional 
roller-coaster match on center court by Frenchman Henri Leconte. The 1988 
runner-up, who needed a wild card to get into the tournament, held on for a 
6-4, 6-3, 4-6, 2-6, 6-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
He goes in the quarters against another unseeded player, Jonas Svensson, who 
upset 15th-seeded Guillermo Perez-Roldan 2-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
The defeats of Chesnokov and Perez-Roldan left Americans Michael Chang and 
Andre Agassi as the only seeded players in their half of the draw. They meet in 
the quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Monica Seles was on her game today, playing near-perfect tennis over the final 
11 games to breeze past Laura Gildemeister and into the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Down 1-4 in the first set and having trouble controlling her two-fisted shots, 
the 16-year-old second seed suddenly seemed invincible as she put Gildemeister 
away 6-4, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini is one of the biggest names in tennis but has reached just one Grand 
Slam final and never has won one. Her frustration continued on the Paris clay. 
</P>
<P>
Novotna eased through the first set and was up 2-0 in the second when she 
twisted her left ankle. After courtside treatment, the Czech broke for 3-0 and 
went up 4-0 on serve. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini saved two match points in the seventh game and started a 
mini-comeback, breaking for 5-3 and 5-5. But Novotna broke back for 6-5 and, 
after saving a break point with a forehand winner, won the match when a 
Sabatini backhand hit the letcord. 
</P>
<P>
"I played my best match of the year. I played very smartly," Novotna said. 
"Today I felt stronger on the important points." 
</P>
<P>
The Czech also said Sabatini let up a bit when she thought her opponent was 
hurt. Sabatini, who has been questioned in the past for her mental toughness, 
said she never tried to ease the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"When I am in that position, I try to move the player and find the right 
angles," she said. "I think it was a bad day for me. I don't think I should 
lose to her. It is a very big upset because I thought I was going to do much 
better in this tournament." 
</P>
<P>
Leconte pulled off perhaps the biggest upset since the first-round eliminations 
of top seeds Stefan Edberg and Boris Becker. Chesnokov was a legitimate 
contender for the title and Leconte was lucky to be here at all, his ranking 
slipping to 161st in the world earlier this spring.

About 40 fans, mainly teen-age girls, swamped the players as they took a few

Although the United States will stage the 1994 finals, few Americans would

The United States, making its first appearance in the World Cup finals since

Special Project earned $101,329.54 for owners Lindsey Burbank and John Douglas

MELVIN DURSLAG: L.A. WAITED IN PAIN FOR GIBSON TO GET THAT HEALING FEELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the royal hamstring was found to be torn last July, Kirk Gibson departed 
the active forces of the Los Angeles Dodgers for a medical patchup. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Mr. Gibson was hitting .213, meaning he left behind a bat not 
exactly labeled white-hot. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, staggering suspense would follow, society asking nervously when the royal 
hamstring would heal, permitting this entertainer to return to the game. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Gibson was voted the National League's Most Valuable Player, ending 
the season with a bad knee rendering him mostly inoperative, but remaining 
mobile enough for him to bash dramatic home runs in the league playoff and the 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
By midseason last year, he was out of commission again, leading to the 
hamstring surgery and continuing speculation on when conditions would allow his 
return. 
</P>
<P>
"Day-to-day," the Dodgers called it, until they ran out of days in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing at spring camp in Florida, Gibson was working up to a return, testing 
the hamstring scientifically. 
</P>
<P>
But when it failed to meet specifications he outlined, he was placed on the 
15-day disabled list, after which he was removed for 21 days more. 
</P>
<P>
How long would it take for this malfunctioning part to heal? And how could the 
Dodgers get an accurate line on the healing process? 
</P>
<P>
You don't take a hamstring into the shop and run it up, checking it for RPMs. 
You go by the judgment of the person owning the hamstring, and this one claimed 
it wasn't right. 
</P>
<P>
It next would develop that the Dodgers would send Gibson to Albuquerque, not to 
visit an Indian healer, but to test the hamstring in the employ of the 
Albuquerque Dukes, a Dodger farm branch. 
</P>
<P>
Just as easily, the Dodgers could have sent him to the Yakima Bears, another 
affiliate, but New Mexico was chosen presumably with another thought in mind. 
</P>
<P>
When Sandy Koufax suffered from an arthritic elbow, remedies by the hundreds 
were tendered, one of which suggested that Koufax be lowered into an abandoned 
mine in New Mexico and left there for three days. 
</P>
<P>
Radiation from the mine, it was guaranteed, would cure the arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy never availed himself of this golden opportunity to get well, but there 
was no reason to believe Gibson wouldn't try it. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk played five games at Albuquerque and returned to Los Angeles, where he was 
supposed to start against Cincinnati last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Kirk made a great deal of progress during his rehab period at Albuquerque," 
announced Fred Clare, Dodger executive vice president. "We will continue to 
evaluate his progress on a daily basis." 
</P>
<P>
Well, on the first daily basis, Kirk checked the hamstring that worked in 
Albuquerque and decided it wasn't working in Los Angeles. He missed Thursday's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Nor was the hamstring functioning to his satisfaction Friday. He missed that 
game, too. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until Saturday that the hamstring informed him it was ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the City of Angels, church bells ring. A grateful populace rejoices. 
Gibson moves into the lineup against the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
He also goes 0 for 4, as he does Sunday, but this is incidental to the fact his 
evaluation on a daily basis leads, at last, to a start. 
</P>
<P>
Could things be worse? Indeed. The Dodgers could have been evaluating him on a 
weekly basis, if not semiannually. 
</P>
<P>
Rising 6 feet 3, at 225 pounds, Gibson isn't what you would call a frail 
specimen. Macho is his trademark, this image dramatized by the fact he often 
doesn't shave. He also cusses out photographers. 
</P>
<P>
He is a tough hombre, leading to two schools of thought on his infirmities. One 
holds that for all his muscle and rugged demeanor, he has less than exceptional 
pain tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
And the other school contends he simply has fragile parts, subject to 
breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
In his time, Gibson has bowed out with an injury to the right knee, then the 
left. His ankle has failed him, along with his calf, his rib cage and his 
wrist. 
</P>
<P>
On one occasion, his stomach muscles went bad. 
</P>
<P>
If all the foregoing benched him, he survived, amazingly, a pitch that hit him 
in the mouth. He required 17 stitches. He was back the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Circumstances didn't permit his coming back with a smile. But he came back. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lasorda, field commander of the Dodgers, often has described Gibson as a 
"leader." 
</P>
<P>
"Do you say that figuratively," Lasorda is asked, "or do you honestly believe 
one guy can lead a team?" 
</P>
<P>
"Hustle and determination are contagious," he answers, "just as loafing and 
malingering are. When a guy is out there, giving it his best shot, I feel this 
is a leadership quality, and I feel Gibson has it when he is able to play." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he was able to play in 71 games, not as many as the Dodgers 
envisioned when they gave Kirk a three-year contract worth roughly $4.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
He seems to want to play, and the Dodgers hope he can, because if they continue 
to evaluate him on a daily basis, they continue to pay him by the year.

Scratches and complaints at Longacres Racetrack have ebbed dramatically, three 
days after several jockeys withdrew from riding for one day to protest what 
they said were dangerous conditions at the rain-soaked track. 
</P>
<P>
The protesting jockeys Thursday included some of the premier riders at 
Longacres: Vicky Aragon, Gary Boulanger, Frank Gonsalves, James Corral and Tim 
Camargo. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated trainers also scratched 21 horses from Thursday's nine races after a 
thunderstorm drenched the track. On Sunday, they scratched 11. 
</P>
<P>
The track was sloppy Sunday but apparently much better after being sealed, or 
rolled. 
</P>
<P>
Gonsalves said the surface was greatly improved despite periodic downpours 
since the boycott. The change was "like night and day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One horse, a 3-year-old maiden that was galloped during a Thursday workout, had 
to be killed when it snapped the bones in both front legs.

IN THE BOOTH, EVERT FEELS LIKE 'ROOKIE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF HASEN, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Evert needed to retire to feel like a kid again. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm like a rookie coming in," said Evert, a new member of NBC's announcing 
team. "It's like being 8 years old and playing in my first tournament." 
</P>
<P>
Evert, who made her debut during coverage of the Family Circle tourney in 
April, is working the French Open -- a tourney she won seven times. 
</P>
<P>
"Clay was my claim to fame," Evert said. "It's bittersweet for me. It's been 
less than a year (since she retired)." 
</P>
<P>
She said that although she has pangs of regret that her career as a player is 
over, she realizes that "I don't want to put in the time and put in the effort 
full time." 
</P>
<P>
Evert, 35, has already found her new profession more taxing than she had 
imagined. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to articulate what's going on on the court," she said. "I was 
always more of a mental player more than anything else. I was always 
instinctive and never one who took notes on a player or talked to my coach for 
an hour before a match. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm having to think more off the court than on." 
</P>
<P>
That thinking involves details Evert used to find extraneous. 
</P>
<P>
"I never really needed a media guide," she said. "When I played someone, I 
never had to know her mother's name. Now I have to know all about the player -- 
not just the style of the player, but the temperament and the personality. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing tennis was a lot easier. Now I'm using my head more for articulating 
and doing research. It just came naturally to play tennis." 
</P>
<P>
Evert said she will be critical when the situation demands it. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's a fair comment, I have no problem with that at all," she said. "I 
don't want to all of a sudden have a good relationship and good rapport with 
the players, then become a broadcaster and be too critical. If I'm fair and 
logical, that's fair criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"If Martina (Navratilova) is playing awful, I'll say it. I won't say that she 
is choking like a dog. That's not my style." 
</P>
<P>
Evert said she was pleased with her performance at the Family Circle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for me to watch myself," she said. "I'm very critical. I need to 
work on instant replays. They come up all of a sudden. NBC wants me to talk 
more of technique and to volunteer a little more information about the players 
and maybe my experience playing them. I need to do more matches. You have 
someone talking in your ear, giving you three seconds to finish and be quiet 
before a commercial. All of these things, I have to get used to."

SKID ROW ARTIST EXPERIENCING A RENAISSANCE; 
</P>
<P>
HOMELESS: HIS WORK GOES ON DISPLAY IN LACE PROGRAM TO HELP THE DOWN AND OUT WHO 
HAVE VISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Some might consider Frank Parker lucky by Skid Row standards. An artist with 
his own "studio," Parker has found several small shops in which to sell his 
works. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Parker has become fairly prominent among the surprisingly large 
group of artists living on Skid Row. His drawings grace the covers of 
publications by the Homeless Writers Coalition. Now, his works are being 
displayed in two simultaneous downtown shows -- one at Los Angeles Contemporary 
Exhibitions and the other at the Weingart Center Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the going for Parker is not easy. While preparing for his current shows, 
Parker found that several years' worth of his drawings, as well as a number of 
his sculptures, had disappeared from his makeshift storage space in a friend's 
garage. But rather than getting discouraged, Parker looked at the experience as 
"a great excuse to do new works." 
</P>
<P>
He's working in his "studio" -- actually an oblong concrete and brick storage 
space with intermittently dripping overhead pipes adjacent to an unused loading 
dock in an old Skid Row building. 
</P>
<P>
Parker is one of more than 30 artists working through LACE's Skid Row Artists' 
Fund, which provides artists with up to $25 monthly in art supplies. The newest 
feature of the program, called "Art From the Streets," allows artists to show 
their works in rotating lobby exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
"Through the exhibition program, people can see that people that are homeless 
are creative, that they can make serious art and that they do have vision," 
said the program's coordinator, Adriene Jenik. "I'm not just interested in 
showing homeless art because it's homeless art, and I don't think the artists 
want to be exploited that way either. I want to show something that can be 
taken seriously." 
</P>
<P>
The "seriousness" of his art is why Jenik selected Parker for this particular 
exhibition, which opens tonight and runs through July 29. On view are works 
from Parker's "Conversation" series -- mixed-media pieces made of Scotch tape 
and interwoven colored bits of telephone wire, as well as a sculptural piece 
made from objects such as old mattress springs. 
</P>
<P>
Before finding himself on Skid Row, Parker, 44, had shows at several locations 
including a number of colleges and community spaces and galleries in Santa 
Barbara, San Diego, New York and Pennsylvania. In 1977, he was featured in the 
Long Beach Museum of Art's "Studio Z: Individual Collective." He lived for a 
time in Venice, had a studio on Slauson Avenue, a steady job as an exhibit 
technician at the Museum of Science and Industry, and was taking art courses at 
Claremont Graduate School. 
</P>
<P>
But when personal problems -- which he declined to discuss -- disrupted his 
life in the late '70s, Parker began taking odd jobs. He dropped out of graduate 
school, vowing to return someday, but eventually his money ran out. A little 
over a year ago, he found himself on the streets of Skid Row, which he said was 
"a better alternative" to some of his other options. 
</P>
<P>
He was a regular at "Another Planet," the celebrated Skid Row cultural center 
that had been formed out of a converted garage. But like many artists, Parker 
was hit hard when the building burned down last August. He lost many of his 
artworks, as well as all his slides and documentation of past works stored 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"Just doing my own work was hard to do," Parker said, noting that now he works 
daily on his art. "I had no space of my own, it was hard to hold on to my tools 
and there was no privacy." 
</P>
<P>
Today he works as a handyman in exchange for his small studio/living space in 
the old Wall and Boyd Building -- the same building in which noted artists 
George Herms and Lita Albuquerque have their studios -- he is able to support 
himself through sales of his small sculptures, which can be worn as jewelry 
(most are priced from $5-$25). Also a big help, Parker said, are the free 
supplies and the verbal support he receives from LACE. 
</P>
<P>
The original Skid Row Artists' Fund -- paid for by an anonymous donor -- was 
set up about a year ago through downtown's Roark Art Supplies, which sells 
goods to LACE at below wholesale costs. Artists then come to LACE's Jenik for 
their monthly supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"We began the artists' fund basically because of where LACE is situated," Jenik 
said. "Skid Row and (its) community members are certainly a part of our 
community. People would come by looking for a job and see what we were doing 
and say, 'Hey, I'm an artist, too.' So we began to set up a program to work 
with the Skid Row people." 
</P>
<P>
With the help of $5,000 from the city's Cultural Affairs Department, Jenik is 
expanding the homeless artists' program once again. Beginning June 13, LACE 
will co-sponsor weekly art classes to be taught by visiting artists at the 
Homeless Outreach Program offices. Also provided will be desperately needed 
storage space for artists to keep their art and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a step toward the ideal situation, which would be for (the Skid Row 
artists) to get a space of their own," Jenik said. "We hope to start 
(money-making) projects and things like sales of artworks to make the program 
self-maintaining." 
</P>
<P>
Establishing the homeless artists programs has not been easy, Jenik said. Many 
of the artists have no addresses or phone numbers, and sometimes she must 
search the streets to find them. In addition, health problems have interfered, 
such as with the first "Art From the Streets" exhibition, in which the 
scheduled artist -- portraitist Myshicka Jerome -- was hospitalized with a bone 
disease a few days before his show's opening. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really crazy sometimes working with (homeless artists). There's no 
telling what could happen at any moment," Jenik said. "So with all this stuff, 
we're really flexible -- we have to be."

ETHICS INSTITUTE MAPS OUT ROAD TO 'NEW CIVIC VIRTUE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is it too soon to worry about the equivalent of a "Keating Five" blight on the 
tender flower of democracy in Eastern Europe? 
</P>
<P>
Not for attorney Michael Josephson. 
</P>
<P>
Josephson believes governments emerging from communism's collapse could fritter 
away moral capital on scandals analogous to the savings and loan fiasco that 
has enveloped five U.S. Senators. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're afraid of is that you start with this massive euphoria of 
pro-democracy (in Eastern Europe), and it will start turning into the reality 
of contending self-interests and corruption and selfishness," says Josephson, 
sitting in his antique-furnished office in Marina del Rey. "That in turn could 
create another small revolution, which leads to dictatorship." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, for this independently wealthy ethics advocate, it's never too early 
to fret about the insidious inroads of corruption, whether in the Iron Curtain 
rust belt or the mountain-rimmed vastness of Juneau, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
And those are exactly the places where Josephson -- a singled-minded, voluble 
former law professor who made his money in publishing and bar exam review 
courses -- has made inroads of his own lately. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Alaska Senate passed -- largely intact -- ethics legislation 
drafted by the 5-year-old Joseph and Edna Josephson Institute for the 
Advancement of Ethics, founded by the 47-year-old lawyer in honor of his 
parents. Josephson's interest in ethics was fanned by a class he taught on the 
subject at Loyola University Law School in 1976. Today, ethics has become an 
all-consuming interest, he says, explaining that his only outside interest is 
his 14-year-old son, Justin. "A lot of this for me is fun. . . . It's just 
great stuff to do." 
</P>
<P>
This week, a paper drafted by the institute, "Preserving the Public Trust: 
Principles of Public Service Ethics," will be distributed to 175 political and 
economic officials from former Eastern Bloc countries at a meeting in 
Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
The paper, first issued in March, is a manifesto on the "moral obligations" of 
public servants that "transcend obligations imposed by laws and formal codes of 
conduct." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Josephson touts "Preserving the Public Trust" as a document that 
breaks new ground in mapping out the straight and narrow for public officials. 
It details, he maintains, "the root of not only the fundamental ethical 
obligation of public officials, but the root of every corruption of public 
officials." 
</P>
<P>
A statement of five principles in 23 pages, the paper represents perhaps the 
first coherent articulation of how democratic leaders can keep the faith with 
constituents, Josephson claims. Forged over 18 months, the paper was drafted by 
a commission of former government officials, politicians, journalists and 
scholars, including former State Department spokesman Hodding Carter III. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the paper asserts that public officials should use their 
offices "to advance public interests, and not to attain personal benefits or 
pursue any other private interest incompatible with the public good." The paper 
also emphasizes that officials should always make decisions objectively, 
conduct public business openly, honor "the principles and spirit of 
representative democracy," and avoid even the appearance of impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
While these points may seem elementary, Josephson says the paper grew out of 
his discovery of widespread imprecision regarding ethical concepts, even among 
veterans of public life. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no coherent understanding or statement of what do we mean by that -- 
what does it mean to live up to the notion of public trust?" he says. 
</P>
<P>
But Josephson is a realist. He says he does not expect the paper to change 
anyone -- at least not immediately -- including the officials of the Soviet 
Union, Hungary, Romania and other Eastern European countries who will get 
copies this week. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not -- and I want to stress this -- ever something that will make a 
bad person good," he says. "Statements of principle don't make bad people good. 
Statements of principle will, however, guide people of good will." 
</P>
<P>
Distribution of the paper to Eastern Europe officials was engineered by Richard 
Shubert, a former president of Bethlehem Steel and the American Red Cross, who 
is a consultant to the Institute for East West Securities Studies of New York, 
which is sponsoring the Stockholm conference. 
</P>
<P>
Schubert, who helped draft the paper, says he sees it as a "a think-provoking 
document" that will outline some problems of democracy for novices in 
representative government. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, Josephson says, the paper will serve as a counterweight to 
other American political exports to fledgling democracies. "What are we sending 
to Eastern Europe? Pollsters, all our campaign manager types who are advising 
people on how to run campaigns," he says with chagrin. "In some of our views, 
not the highest and best of what we have to offer in a political system." 
</P>
<P>
Both Josephson and Schubert say, however, that problems other than ethics are 
going to top the officials' agenda. "The last thing they want to hear about 
probably is ethics and principles," says Josephson. "They're very much 
concerned with food and getting their economies going." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the Alaska Legislature saw ethics as a top priority when it asked 
Josephson's institute to draft legislation on proper conduct for lawmakers 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The bill struck some Alaska politicians as Draconian. It severely limited 
campaign fund raising, imposed a ban on converting campaign funds to personal 
use, put a one-year ban on former legislators and legislative aides lobbying in 
the Legislature, required stricter financial disclosure, placed an almost total 
ban on privately funded travel, prohibited legislators from representing legal 
clients before state agencies and established general standards of rectitude 
for legislators. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was not welcomed in some quarters, acknowledges Alaska Senate 
President Tim Kelly, a strong backer of the bill who noted that Josephson's 
brash attitude was sometimes an impediment. 
</P>
<P>
"His argumentative nature sometimes rubbed people the wrong way," Kelly says, 
adding that this provided ammunition for the bill's enemies. "Some thought they 
could discredit the message if they could discredit the messenger." 
</P>
<P>
The Anchorage Daily News reported one hallway encounter between Josephson and a 
lobbyist Bill Ray: 
</P>
<P>
Josephson: "I thought you were a lobbyist." 
</P>
<P>
Ray: "I'm a consultant." 
</P>
<P>
Josephson: "OK, that's precisely the kind of distinctions that aren't 
acceptable under this code. I mean, you call a spade a spade. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Ray: "I know a hell of a lot more about the Alaska Legislature than you do, 
I'll tell you that much." 
</P>
<P>
Josephson: "You certainly do. And that's why they needed an outsider." 
</P>
<P>
Josephson recalls that he had many spirited exchanges in Juneau -- and met with 
a good deal of incomprehension. One legislator, he was told, reacted to 
proposed publication of floor votes by saying, "That's nobody's business." 
Unfortunately for Josephson, his bill was not passed by the Alaskan House, 
which dropped the legislation on a procedural vote minutes before adjournment 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
Both Kelly and Josephson say, however, that the bill will come up again, either 
in next year's session or in a special session this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Josephson will keep spreading his message, using "Preserving the 
Public Trust" as "a kind of a road map for a new civic virtue." 
</P>
<P>
After these words roll off his tongue, he quickly adds: "I know that sounds 
pretentious, I know that makes people nervous, but democracy is so inherently 
idealistic . . . if we can't be idealistic about our ideals, we lose them."

SOCCER: ITALY'S LUCA CORDERO DI MONTEZEMOLO IS CONSUMED BY DETAILS IN A LAND OF 
PROCRASTINATION.

<P>
Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, a man waiting for a whistle, is unabashed 
embodiment of Italy future and Italy past. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a full-of-contradictions kind of guy," di Montezemolo mused one recent 
morning in the frazzling countdown for the 1990 World Cup. He directs 
preparations with a blend of high-tech drive and old-world patience, wheedling 
harmony from a nation of brilliant but obstinate soloists. 
</P>
<P>
"I laugh when somebody thinks that a soccer ball can change tradition, 
mentality, procedure, bureaucracy," he said. "We will be ready, as usual, but 
my opinion is that in the work up in Italy, a miracle happened." 
</P>
<P>
Getting a nation of 57 million individualist soccer fanatics and their 
bickering politicians to play together has been a four-year crusade for di 
Montezemolo. He's a polyglot, resolutely modern and worldly wise executive who 
is on the one hand all international big business, and on the other assertively 
close to his roots. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the world, but I feel very, very Italian," he said. "I love the small 
parts of my country: Tuscany, Capri in the winter. I don't like big towns." 
</P>
<P>
Di Montezemolo brought newfangled managerial initiatives to this biggest of 
World Cups, and he brought down-home tradition of the sort that tells him it 
would be inviting bad luck to plan a post-tournament vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very superstitious. I don't want to make plans in advance," he said. "We 
hope things are done -- at least medium rare -- not well done, because in Italy 
it's impossible to make everybody happy. . . . My feelings have changed often, 
like day and night, but I'm . . . optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
All the planning gets its acid test later this week when the whistle blows for 
an inaugural game between defending champion Argentina and Cameroon in Milan. 
Di Montezemolo will remain at razor's edge until the surviving two of 24 
competing national teams meet in the final July 8 in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still a lot to do," he said. "It's a big mosaic and every aspect of it 
must go well. We keep our fingers crossed because there are still a lot of 
delicate aspects to cover. Believe me, to organize this event of 52 matches in 
12 towns in one month in our country is not very easy." 
</P>
<P>
At 42, sandy-haired, wiry Luca di Montezemolo is a natural for Italy's most 
visible encounter with the world since the 1960 Olympics: a home-loving Italian 
and a slick international operator whose expertise is management, 
communications and sports. 
</P>
<P>
The combination was, di Montezemolo concedes, barely enough in a country where 
Latin temperament and 2,000 years of tradition decree that all truly important 
things are left until the last minute. Italy knew for eight years that it would 
be the host country but, in a welter of changing national and local 
governments, the enabling legislation funding preparations was not passed until 
1989. Di Montezemolo's arms rise skyward in that palms up gesture meaning, 
"That's the way it is," that all Italians learn in the womb. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Bologna, scion of an ancient and noble, cardinals-in-the-blood northern 
Italian family, di Montezemolo is a Rome-trained lawyer who did an additional 
two years of international commercial law at Columbia University in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"The best two years of my life," he calls them. 
</P>
<P>
He is, by almost all accounts, a favorite of industrialist mogul Gianni 
Agnelli, the Mr. Italy president of the giant Fiat automotive empire. Much of 
di Montezemolo's career has been spent under Agnelli's wing. Di Montezemolo 
went to Fiat in 1975 in public relations after a stint as assistant to Enzo 
Ferrari and director of auto racing for Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, at 36, di Montezemolo became director of an Agnelli holding company 
that controls the Fiat group's huge publishing ventures. Three years later, he 
moved to Switzerland as director of Cinzano International, a company best known 
to Europeans for its white and red aperitif vermouths. By 1985, he was shopping 
for a challenging job in Rome, where his parents live. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted a serious job in Rome, and this was theoretically a serious job -- so 
I came," he said. "For me it was interesting to put together my background 
experience in such a big event. I wanted a job outside a private company, and 
for me it is useful to understand the big problems we face in Italy, 
translating projects into reality. This is the biggest problem in our country." 
</P>
<P>
His salary as manager of Italia 90 pays 400 million lire a year -- about 
$340,000. 
</P>
<P>
To finance Italia 90, di Montezemolo persuaded eight Italian corporate giants 
to pay big up front as sponsors and also got their know-how and the loan of 
bright young executives to form his brain trust. He vigorously licensed the 
stick figure World Cup logo to other companies, sold tickets to games even 
before anybody knew who would play in them -- and the money came rolling in. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't borrow a single lire," he said. "We didn't buy one line of 
advertising. We have sold more tickets than we have anticipated -- and we will 
finish in the black." 
</P>
<P>
Di Montezemolo, a divorced father of two whose current companion is Edwige 
Fenech, a raven-haired Italian actress and television personality, is a 
born-to-it pillar of the Italian entrepreneurial aristocracy: a member of the 
board of Ferrari, the Fiat-owned Turin newspaper La Stampa; and vice president 
of Juventus, Fiat's major league soccer team in Turin. 
</P>
<P>
If the Italia 90 job has been challenging, di Montezemolo has also found it 
constraining. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very provincial job; it is not international," he said. "I have been 
in this office 12 hours a day for four years, focusing on the problems of Bari, 
Turin, Naples. . . . I'm a curious guy and this is a fantastic moment in the 
world, not only in the East, but all over; and here I was working in the 
stadiums, working with problems like lights, discussing with city and 
government officials. I couldn't go on a holiday anywhere -- the States, 
Russia. Believe me, it was a prison." 
</P>
<P>
The sentence is up July 9. After that, di Montezemolo has no next job, but 
bright prospects if the cup comes off successfully. He's thinking about a book, 
and he's thinking about a vacation -- just thinking. 
</P>
<P>
There are stray quiet moments when Luca di Montezemolo imagines that it's all 
over: He sees himself, in mid-July, zooming through the American heartland, 
where soccer is still a kids' game, letting it all hang out astride a big 
motorcycle. A dream, but no plans; not until after the final whistle blows in 
Rome.

MELLINGER, FOUNDER OF FREDERICK'S OF HOLLYWOOD, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Frederick Mellinger, whose fascination with a World War II pinup picture 
eventually became the provocatively popular and profitable Frederick's of 
Hollywood, died Saturday night at his Brentwood home. 
</P>
<P>
Morton Field, attorney for the nationally known purveyor of naughty nightwear 
and women's undergarments, said Sunday that Mellinger, who had retired in 1984, 
was 76. 
</P>
<P>
He died of the complications of pneumonia and had also been suffering from 
Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
Until his retirement, Mellinger ran his retail chain of 160 stores and a 
multimillion-dollar mail-order business from a garish two-story building on 
Hollywood Boulevard that was as colorful as the push-up bras, crotchless 
panties and derriere-enhancing lingerie it contained. 
</P>
<P>
The dapper, mustachioed Mellinger, who said he was successful because "I never 
listen to Paris designers . . . they don't dress women for men," had the 
exterior of his headquarters building painted purple and the interior cranberry 
and peach. 
</P>
<P>
From there his passion fashion grew to a multimillion-dollar concern thanks in 
no small part to Mellinger himself. 
</P>
<P>
He was a tireless promoter on TV talk shows, including Johnny Carson, and his 
annual report to stockholders included summaries of the media attention the 
founder of the padded or paste-on empire had generated in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
The genesis of what was then considered Mellinger's scandalous enterprise came 
in World War II when he was a GI stationed in the Midwest. Like millions of 
other soldiers, he had pinned a picture on a wall of Betty Grable displaying 
her famous legs. Unlike his fellow soldiers, he asked his buddies what they 
found attractive in women's dress. 
</P>
<P>
Equipped with this less than scientific survey, he opened a 4-by-4-foot office 
in New York City, calling it Frederick's of Fifth Avenue. There he designed 
women's clothes from a man's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
He nearly went broke and in 1947 moved to Los Angeles, where he sold lingerie 
from a small shop in Chinatown. A movie fan since childhood, (many of the early 
Frederick's catalogues contained drawings suggestive of the starlets of the 
1930s and '40s), Mellinger next moved to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
For years all the American public knew of Frederick's came from those 
catalogues, but in the 1960s Mellinger began to open outlets in malls. They 
proved an immediate success for, as Mellinger liked to observe, "sex never goes 
out of fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the daring designs and the cost, most of his customers came not from 
the fleshpots of large cities but from Middle America. 
</P>
<P>
Women shopped for his wares while pushing baby strollers and men could be seen 
on their lunch hours buying nighties for the mothers of their children. 
</P>
<P>
In what some saw as a ploy to obviate charges of sexism, Mellinger in 1979 
introduced a line of briefs for men, though the business remained oriented 
toward women. 
</P>
<P>
Yet styles do change, and some of Frederick's stock-in-trade came to be seen as 
routine rather than risque. The firm suffered its first yearly loss in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Mellinger stepped down as chairman and chief executive, replaced by George W. 
Townson, who set about changing Frederick's image. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick's catalogues no longer push sexual aids, bondage devices and X-rated 
videos. Tasteful clothing and underwear are worn by wholesome-looking models. 
</P>
<P>
And last fall, the purple Hollywood headquarters was painted gray. 
</P>
<P>
Mellinger himself, unlike his building and inventory, presented a conservative 
facade, seated in an office filled with family photos. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people," he said in a 1981 Times interview, "expect me to be a dirty, old 
lecherous man. I think they're kind of disappointed when I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Harriett, a son, daughter and five grandchildren. 
Services will be private and contributions are asked to the John Douglas French 
Foundation for Alzheimer's Research, 11620 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, 90025.
