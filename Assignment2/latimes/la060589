SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: TO SERVE AND PROTECT THE SEAPORT SHOPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes the changes in San Diego go unnoticed for years. Then one day people 
notice something is different and begin asking what happened. 
</P>
<P>
Take the rally in downtown San Diego last week. The topic was drugs and money, 
but a lot of attention was paid to five sharply dressed, heavily armed 
individuals marching in the parade. 
</P>
<P>
The five wore crisp, dark blue pants and shirts, with bright yellow chevrons on 
their sleeves, shiny badges and Smokey Bear hats. They were armed with 
handguns, batons and tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
They were older than the San Diego cops. But a heckler trying to shout down the 
head of the Urban League made sure to position himself far away from the 
ferocious-looking five. 
</P>
<P>
"Who are those guys?" was a common refrain. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: private security guards from Seaport Village. 
</P>
<P>
The shopping complex has had its own 24-hour security force since 1982, now 
numbering 10 full-time members, headed by a former suburban police chief from 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
All of this is seen as economically necessary for a trendy shopping complex 
that, until recently, was cheek-by-jowl with San Diego Police Department 
headquarters. (A new headquarters opened two years ago.) 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's a deterrent," said Seaport Village manager Phyllis Cicchetto. "We 
want people to feel safe here." 
</P>
<P>
It's simple: If upscale shoppers feel threatened, they quickly take their 
business elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
When crime (real or imagined) menaces the affluent, merchants take notice, 
public officials catch hell and things happen. It's different for people 
farther down the economic scale. 
</P>
<P>
They're allowed to hold marches and send petitions to politicians.And Another 
Thing . . . 
</P>
<P>
Notes from everywhere: 
</P>
<P>
* A support organization has formed at San Diego State University for a 
much-maligned group to discuss common problems: the Heterosexual Student Union. 
</P>
<P>
* With its garish yellow paint job, the Paddock restaurant in Encinitas was a 
civic eyesore for years, squat on the city's busiest street, Encinitas 
Boulevard, just east of Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungry Hunter chain has now bought the restaurant and taken two steps to 
curry community favor. 
</P>
<P>
The building has been repainted a pleasing tan. And half the revenue from 
Tuesday's gala opening is pledged to Jenny Pratt, a local teen-ager who was 
crippled in an unsolved 1987 attack. 
</P>
<P>
* After some financial reshuffling, the BodyWorks fitness parlor on 7th Avenue 
in downtown San Diego has a new advertising tactic. 
</P>
<P>
Signs (including one offering a free cholesterol test) have been placed flat on 
the roof of the two-story building, looking skyward. They're visible to flabby 
office workers in surrounding high-rises.Barber Buddies 
</P>
<P>
One of the nagging questions from the alleged money-laundering caper of Richard 
T. Silberman has been: How did Silberman, a respected businessman and political 
insider, ever become pals with Chris Petti, a reputed mobster? 
</P>
<P>
Their natural habitats seem quite dissimilar. Silberman is La Jolla, Petti is 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman has been telling friends that Petti 
</P>
<P>
is just some guy he met at the barber shop at the Town &amp; Country Hotel in 
Mission Valley. They used to talk while waiting to get trimmed, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Stafford, who has owned the shop for 15 years, confirms that both were 
steady customers but says he never saw them in the shop at the same time. "It 
could have happened, but I doubt it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
What does Stafford think of the criminal case in which the FBI allegedly stung 
the pair into thinking they were dealing in Colombian drug money? 
</P>
<P>
"It cost me a very good customer," Stafford said. 
</P>
<P>
Petti is getting his hair cut free these days at the Metropolitan Correctional 
Center.

SAN DIEGO SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
CHANGES ARE CLEAR; FUTURE STILL CLOUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In June, 1987, an independent commission of prominent San Diegans issued a 
major study calling for teachers and principals to try new ways of teaching, 
for stronger community support and for better use of technology. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, many regular observers of the San Diego city school system 
predicted that the "schools of the future" report would follow the traditional 
path of many such documents, gathering dust as it sat neglected on office 
bookshelves. 
</P>
<P>
But two years later, the San Diego Unified School District seems awash in 
reform after a series of seminars to explain the report to teachers -- although 
no one can quite define what the word reform means and where the efforts might 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major and Minor Steps 
</P>
<P>
Teachers and principals at about a quarter of the district's 150 educational 
facilities have taken steps -- some minor, some major -- toward gaining 
flexibility in implementing curriculum and other general policies set by the 
state and district. 
</P>
<P>
These restructuring efforts so far range from school-wide meetings of 
interested staff members at Hamilton Elementary to the rearranging of 
curriculum at Linda Vista Elementary to help its large population of immigrant 
and English-as-a-second-language students grasp reading and mathematics skills 
more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The ferment for reform is being helped along by consultants sponsored by 
Matsushita Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the Japanese conglomerate best 
known in this country for its Panasonic electronics products. For more than a 
year, Matsushita has had specialists at various schools almost on a weekly 
basis to provide ideas, make suggestions, help crystallize good intentions and 
focus debate. 
</P>
<P>
"We're farther along than I thought we would be a year ago," city schools Supt. 
Tom Payzant said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Philosophy Pushed 
</P>
<P>
Payzant and the Board of Education have pushed their philosophy that schools 
will be better able to teach students -- and in particular the growing ethnic 
mix in San Diego -- if they are allowed greater control over their own budgets, 
organization and curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
"I initially thought it would take longer to start getting people to ask basic 
questions if whether what they are doing (at their schools) is working for all 
kids," Payzant said. "And that meant persuading them that restructuring was not 
going to be just another idea or program conceived by the central office 
staff." 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, Payzant said, the district has deliberately kept the reform 
movement loosely structured, allowing individual schools to ask for help in 
debating the merits of reform, but not forcing change on unwilling 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
"There is still a good deal of ambiguity and many schools are still looking to 
the traditional sources of direction at the central office," Payzant said. 
"They are uneasy when they don't see that direction coming. So no one is quite 
sure where all of this is going to take us." 
</P>
<P>
In one case, at Silver Gate Elementary in Point Loma, the first stirrings for 
action have come from a group of parents who have heard about meetings at other 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
The president of the local teachers union expresses optimism that reform will 
take permanent root. Hugh Boyle, a 30-year district veteran who took the union 
out on strike in the mid-1970s, worked out a four-year contract with the 
district last November that brought not only substantial pay raises but also 
flexibility in carrying out educational reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"It was clear to everyone in the district and to Matsushita that we can't do 
any real reform without the union and everyone else cooperating," Boyle said. 
"It was a painful process to go through (negotiations), but the district has 
learned the hard way that you cannot mandate something from the top and think 
it will really work." 
</P>
<P>
The contract created a special committee of district and teacher 
representatives to consider waivers for schools asking to try new ways of 
staffing, of approving budgets, of peer coaching, of team teaching and other 
strategies that could conflict with the basic labor contract. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Retirements Loom 
</P>
<P>
Boyle said San Diego is in a unique position for change because a large number 
of teachers and administrators will retire in the next three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
"The district is growing and hiring new teachers by the hundreds as those of us 
leave who long ago became part of the system that we wanted to change when we 
were first hired," Boyle said. "That is going to bring greater opportunities 
for reform, and I think it is a realistic hope." 
</P>
<P>
With prodding from the Matsushita consultants, informal committees of teachers 
and administrators from schools with reforms under way are trying to define 
more precisely what a restructured school should look like. 
</P>
<P>
But while the so-called pioneers would like more schools to join in the 
process, they remain wary of requiring participation. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that once the level of confidence and trust is better, we can be more 
provocative in suggesting some specifics and not have that perceived by schools 
as the game plan to be followed by everyone," Payzant said. 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita consultant Ken Tewel, a former New York City principal, said each 
school must follow its own instincts in deciding what to do and how fast to do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Minimal Interest at First 
</P>
<P>
Tewel has helped the staff at Kearny High School, where the faculty expressed 
minimal interest when he first came to meetings there last year. 
</P>
<P>
"There was what I would call adult 'wilding,' with teachers railing at 
themselves, at the district, at the principal over all sorts of things," said 
Tewel, now a professor of education at Queens College, part of the City 
University of New York. 
</P>
<P>
Not until the decision for how to eliminate some teaching positions was handed 
over to a faculty committee -- and not simply made from the top -- did the 
school community begin to consider restructuring as something more than a sham, 
Tewel said. 
</P>
<P>
"That led to teachers taking a look at instruction as well, and soon they had 
conceived a planning group and were looking at the school's future direction, 
and, while I was making regular visits, they were doing the substance 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Kearny successfully presented its plan to trustees to expand 
its technology magnet program to the ninth grade and is now considering more 
changes, such as a language immersion approach for immigrant students. 
</P>
<P>
"And now, when the principal gets a letter from the faculty asking for him to 
do something, he instead asks 'Why?' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
They Can Make a Difference 
</P>
<P>
Small successes at the start give teachers confidence and power to believe they 
can make a difference in making things better for students, which is the goal 
that should always be kept in mind, according to Matsushita executive director 
Sophie Sa. 
</P>
<P>
"The key is in bridging the gap between how teachers see their schools now and 
the belief in education . . . that they had when (long ago) deciding to become 
teachers," Tewel said. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle said some principals do perceive restructuring as "the way to go" if they 
want future promotions, despite district promises that nothing will be required 
from the "top down." 
</P>
<P>
"Some feel that there is nevertheless a subtle message to do it," Boyle said. 
</P>
<P>
But Payzant and others say the message is rather one of asking whether a school 
can afford not to consider change. 
</P>
<P>
"Every school should be asking not how its best students are doing, but how its 
lowest students are doing and whether it can do something about improving 
that," Payzant said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a lot of problems in this district with dropouts, with the 
performance of black males, etcetera," Payzant said. "The definition of the 
problems, the exhortations of what to do, will continue to be discussed at the 
central office, and there will be policy direction from the board. 
</P>
<P>
"But instead of a solution traditionally coming from a few at the district, it 
now can be up to a school to figure out what would solve things best for it. In 
this way, we're going to draw on a much broader base of talent."

A slap on the wrist for a stab in the back: 
</P>
<P>
When I saw the headline "Junior High Student Who Stabbed Teacher Given 8-Year 
Sentence" (Metro, May 26) I immediately scanned the article to determine the 
true sentence. 
</P>
<P>
I was not surprised: "Although committed for a maximum detention time of eight 
years at a California Youth Authority facility, a prison for young people, the 
boy could be eligible for parole in two to four years, authorities said." 
</P>
<P>
No doubt the boy needs help, and the state will give it. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the teacher cannot be paroled from her injury and suffering, and 
it is doubtful if the state will be as ready to help the teacher as it is to 
help the student.

DEBT-REDUCTION STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pushed by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, both the International 
Monetary Fund and the World Bank have now agreed on guidelines to divert as 
much as $25 billion over the next three years to help developing nations to 
reduce their debt burdens. In effect, the Brady strategy for debt reduction is 
under way, although without significant American participation. 
</P>
<P>
The IMF and World Bank have, most wisely, made clear that the prime 
responsibility still remains with the commercial banks. The response of the 
banks has been mixed. There have been some helpful agreements on rescheduling 
small portions of the debt, including the plan worked out this week in Paris to 
extend for 10 years the deadline for Mexico to pay $2.6 billion. But that 
affected only marginally Mexico's total indebtedness of $107.4 billion, of 
which about 78% is owed commercial banks. And in the broader based negotiations 
between the banks and the Mexican government in New York, the banks have been 
resisting the kind of significant and realistic write-offs and other 
concessions that most observers think are essential. 
</P>
<P>
Guidelines adopted by the IMF and World Bank over the last two weeks are 
intended to expedite action by the commercial banks to forgive substantial 
portions of the debts and debt-service interest that were accumulated at a time 
when the flood of oil-generated dollars encouraged banks to promote lending 
wherever borrowers could be found. The amount of money available for debt 
reduction from the two international agencies is miniscule compared to the 
staggering $1.3 trillion owed by developing nations. But IMF and bank officials 
are confident that the funds can be leveraged by the debtor nations to win 
major concessions from the banks, which, sooner or later, will recognize that 
they will be fortunate to collect even half of the money. 
</P>
<P>
The IMF has already approved three loans, the equivalent of $3.5 billion for 
Mexico, $825 million for the Philippines and $55 million for Costa Rica, to 
give each of these nations something with which to negotiate with their 
creditors. Venezuela is expected to be next. 
</P>
<P>
Michel Camdessus, managing director of the IMF, dressed down French bankers 
Wednesday with a message intended for all commercial bankers, a reiteration of 
the firm policy of the IMF and the World Bank that they are in business to bail 
out indebted nations, not commercial banks. 
</P>
<P>
"Our governors have repeatedly underlined the fact that the official sector 
cannot continue substituting for the private sector," Camdessus said. "Do not 
ignore their message." 
</P>
<P>
Barber B. Conable, president of the World Bank, issued a similar word of 
caution Thursday when the bank completed its debt-help guidelines. "Executive 
directors (of the World Bank) were firm in the view that the bank's operations 
should not result in a significant transfer of debt or risk to the public 
sector." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, leaders of the IMF and World Bank have reminded the debtor 
nations that their eligibility for help will depend on their willingness to 
accept structural reforms at home that hold out the promise that the debt 
relief will contribute to authentic economic development. 
</P>
<P>
The developing nations most deeply in debt at the end of 1988 were Brazil, 
owing $120.1 billion; Mexico, $107.4 billion; Argentina, $59.6 billion; 
Venezuela, $35 billion; Nigeria, $30.5 billion, and the Philippines, $30.2 
billion.

U.S. HYPOCRISY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consider these three newspaper items: 
</P>
<P>
1. The U.S., hot on the heels of drug dealers and producers all over the world, 
stands unmasked as one of the big "dealers," according to a column by Peter G. 
Bourne (Op-Ed Page, May 15). Bourne reveals that the U.S. exerts intense 
pressure on countries attempting to ban or curtail tobacco advertising, though 
we are trying to accomplish that very thing here. A double standard? 
</P>
<P>
2. President Bush (speaking from behind bullet-proof glass) gives his usual 
tough speech on crime, favoring the continued banning of assault rifles. Well, 
those made elsewhere; domestic production is fine. This may be the civilian 
version of "friendly fire." 
</P>
<P>
3. Panama strongman Gen. Manuel Noriega, for years the friend of U.S. 
administrations, now takes the role of enemy, though his drug connections were 
known for all that time. What has converted him from friend to foe? Could he be 
needed to take the part abandoned by the Soviet Union? We need someone against 
whom to carry on our War to Save Hypocrisy.

MINORITY HIRING ON CAMPUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thompson's column caught my eye. The writer discusses minority hiring in 
colleges -- this is a problem, even in private institutions. As a student at a 
private graduate school, I found myself, a black, older woman, pretty much 
excluded, even in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Issues were discussed in relation to the white population. As a black, older 
woman it was as though I did not exist. If I asked a question it was not given 
serious consideration -- it was "entertained" shall we say, and then it was 
time to get down to "serious" questions. 
</P>
<P>
There is a pervasive attitude in the schools of learning toward women. They are 
not looked upon as prospective "professors." One white woman in the class who 
was about 60 was treated as though she was possessed of dementia. Her questions 
were deferred and demurred. 
</P>
<P>
What is at issue here is that minorities -- and that includes women of all 
colors -- are discriminated against in colleges and graduate schools when it 
comes to faculty hiring. 
</P>
<P>
The colleges and graduate schools want their tuition monies but they do not 
want to hire them. But comes the fund-raising from the alumni-alumnae -- we are 
brothers all of us and we must support the venerable institutions of learning. 
Let us pray!

MINORITY HIRING ON CAMPUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'll tell you why affirmative action is not working in universities, or any 
place else for that matter. Reaganomics! The legacy of Ronald Reagan is rearing 
its ugly head again. With fewer and fewer minorities entering college today, 
I'm not surprised "the number of full-time black faculty in American colleges 
dropped 4%." You can't hire what is becoming an endangered species, black 
college graduates. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, college students all over America cried out for Reagan to have mercy 
and not cut government grants and loans -- grants and loans which were the only 
means available by which most minorities could attend college. 
</P>
<P>
I applaud Thompson's concern. But it may be too late.

DEMOCRATS LOST THEIR FIX ON ORDINARY PEOPLE, LEAVING MOST AMERICANS WITHOUT A

Democratic Party: born May 13, 1792; place of birth, Virginia; parent, Thomas 
Jefferson. Died sometime during the 1980s, aged almost 200. 
</P>
<P>
The exact time of death is difficult to establish since, in defiance of all 
previously known natural laws, the outward body continues to thrive, masking 
the fact that the spirit, the animating flame of purpose and principle, has 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
The departure of Reps. Jim Wright and Tony Coelho are but trivial outward 
signs, evidentiary shreds, of a moribund state that had deteriorated for over a 
decade. Political scandal and retribution are as old as the republic, and both 
major parties have survived, even flourished, under far more brutal and 
egregious blows. It has been a far more profound and progressive debilitation 
that has led toward the end. 
</P>
<P>
But first some explanations. After all, how can one speak of the extinction of 
a political organization that "controls" both houses of Congress, a number of 
governorships and state legislatures? Only by understanding that a political 
party is something more than a mechanism that offers ambitious individuals 
access to public office. By that criterion, the Democratic Party does fairly 
well. 
</P>
<P>
But merely winning elections is neither justification nor meaning of a 
political party. A great political party, Woodrow Wilson wrote, "must have a 
great purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Democratic Party has always contained a varied and ample coalition 
of beliefs, it has, for the most part, represented those excluded from the 
ranks of unearned privilege and the power of concentrated wealth. Describing 
his new party, Jefferson said that whereas his opponent felt government should 
be run for the people by the aristocracy, he wished a government for the people 
run by the people. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats have occasionally deviated from that principle, but -- with the 
lone exception of Lincoln -- the Democratic Party has been the principal engine 
of change designed to enhance the opportunity of "ordinary" men and women. The 
most enlightened and progressive forces of economic democracy have found their 
natural home and their source of power in the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
But that is no longer true. In fact, the great majority of Americans -- not 
merely the voiceless and impotent poor -- have been excluded from the concerns 
of both major parties, and thus effectively disenfranchised. And they know it, 
which is why so many of them no longer even participate in an electoral process 
that -- whomever wins -- will not govern in their interest. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "Reagan Revolution" brought about the most grotesquely unjust 
distribution of income and opportunity in modern history. The figures to 
document this reality have been widely printed and circulated. It is not only 
the poor who have gotten poorer; but the great middle-class -- the backbone of 
American society -- have seen their stake in America dwindle, their standard of 
living diminished. 
</P>
<P>
These "facts" are now so commonly admitted as to have become cliches. Less 
remarked is the fact that the Democratic leaders acquiesce in the legislation 
and executive acts that reverse the progress of generations. The destruction of 
the environment, the deepening of poverty, the creation of a permanent 
underclass were a collaborative effort of officials from both parties. 
</P>
<P>
One would have expected the Democrats -- who possessed, still possess, 
considerable authority in the federal government -- to have conducted a fierce 
and clamorous battle against these trends. Instead there was little more than 
silence from those who have found it more profitable -- financially and 
politically -- to unite with their political adversaries and with the large 
economic interests that have gained a powerful hold over government. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan is gone, but the silent collaboration continues. Although the Democrats 
have a majority in Congress they have, as a party, offered no alternative 
budget, no policy for justice in the distribution of income, no laws to rescue 
the environment from life-threatening decay, or no way to save the political 
process -- democracy itself -- from the swelling power of moneyed interests 
which is stifling the essence of American liberty. 
</P>
<P>
This immense failure does not flow from some temporary defect in leadership. It 
has continued for a decade and shows no sign of remedy. Indeed, many of the 
loudest voices in the Democratic Party call for movement toward an even more 
"centrist" position; a euphemism for an attempt to duplicate the Republican 
alliance with the already powerful. And few voices are heard to defy these 
counselors who would distance the "party of the people," the party of "hope" 
even further from the immense numbers of Americans whose lives are a continual 
struggle to enhance their lives and the prospects for their children. 
</P>
<P>
It is fruitless to ask the Democratic Party to mend its ways and restore its 
progressive purpose. For that party as we knew it -- as Jefferson and Jackson 
and Roosevelt conceived and nurtured it -- no longer exists. The soul has fled; 
only the machine remains. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, we no longer have a two-party system; no clash of competing ideologies, 
attitudes, beliefs. There is only one party -- The Washington Party -- 
committed to that thickly obscuring cloud of interests that swarm the streets 
and chambers of our capital city. 
</P>
<P>
The remedy? There is only one possibility -- the people, already distrustful, 
indeed, contemptuous of their own government, will -- when the pain is great 
enough or injustice clear enough -- take the country back. They may or may not 
act through the Democratic Party. It really doesn't matter. Because whatever 
the label, they will have to start from the beginning.

IF A MORE MODERATE ERA COMES TO POST-KHOMEINI IRAN, IT WILL BE SLOW IN ARRIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUL BAKHASH, Shaul Bakhash is a professor of history at George Mason 
University in Fairfax, Va. and the author of The Reign of the Ayatollahs: Iran 
and the Islamic Revolution. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The era of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died in Tehran on Saturday, 
witnessed a radical reversal in Iran's regional and international role and in 
many of its foreign policies. Khomeini, claiming spiritual leadership of the 
Islamic world, believed that he had a special mission: to reinvigorate the 
Muslim community for confrontation with the two hostile superpowers and an 
exploitative West. 
</P>
<P>
Under Khomeini, Iran's foreign policy underwent dramatic changes. The shah 
viewed the United States as Iran's closest ally; Khomeini labeled it the "Great 
Satan" and Iran's principal enemy. The shah befriended Israel; Khomeini called 
for Israel's destruction. The shah sought alliances with the moderate states of 
the Middle East such as Egypt; Khomeini, with Arabic radicals such as Syria and 
Libya. 
</P>
<P>
The shah saw himself as guarantor of Persian Gulf stability; Khomeini sought to 
destabilize gulf regimes. And while under the shah, Iran established a 
reasonable working relationship with Iraq, under Khomeini, Iraq invaded Iran, 
launching a bloody, destructive war that ended only eight years later. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini, moreover, came to power believing Muslim states could stand up to the 
West and to the communist world -- each the purveyor of an alien and dangerous 
culture -- by reverting to Islam. He sought to encourage other Muslim states to 
follow the Iranian example, to overthrow regimes he regarded as subservient to 
the West, and to establish Islamic governments on the Iranian model. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini won admiration, even adulation, in many parts of the Islamic world for 
standing up to America and humiliating the Great Satan. But the limits of his 
vision and Iran's influence became evident even during his own lifetime. Iran 
did succeed in spreading its version of revolutionary Islam among Lebanon's 
disadvantaged Shiites. But it was unable to export the revolution to other 
Persian Gulf states, and the example of the Iranian revolution has not been 
duplicated elsewhere in the Islamic world. The war with Iraq was enormously 
destructive in human life and in material terms. 
</P>
<P>
Iran, it is true, helped fuel resistance to Israel in Lebanon but the enmity 
toward Israel has often been a matter of words rather than action. Iran, after 
all, bought arms from the Israelis. During the Iran-Contra affair, Iran dealt 
and negotiated with the United States. Repeatedly the country has reached out 
for normalization of relations with West European states. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, these two strains of fierce hostility to the West and a search for 
accommodation often have been pursued, sometimes simultaneously, sometimes in 
bewildering succession, in Khomeini's Iran. The inconsistency is itself a 
reflection of the division in Iran's leadership. If Khomeini had at times 
listened to the advocates of accommodation, his instinct toward confrontation 
and hostility to the West repeatedly asserted itself. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to believe any successor to Khomeini would enjoy the powerful 
devotion he could arouse both in Iran and in other parts of the Islamic world. 
A "death sentence," such as that issued by Khomeini against Salman Rushdie, the 
author of "The Satanic Verses," would hardly carry the same weight or arouse 
the same passions issued by any conceivable successor. 
</P>
<P>
However, it would be wrong to anticipate a sudden shift in Iran's foreign 
policy in the post-Khomeini period. There are powerful constituencies within 
the Iranian leadership opposed to normalization with western Europe, let alone 
with the United States. Over the next two months, Iran's leaders will be 
absorbed in revision of the constitution to ensure stability and viable 
government in the difficult post-Khomeini period. 
</P>
<P>
Even those who favor more moderate policies abroad will wish to avoid being 
accused by rivals of compromise or of abandoning the Khomeini legacy. The 
regime is limited in its freedom of action by many years of anti-Western 
rhetoric and the fierce assertion of the principle of Iranian independence and 
self-sufficiency. The next few months will not be a time for new initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Iran cannot continue as an international pariah. The repeated, if 
often abortive attempts to normalize relations with Europe and to repair 
relations with the Persian Gulf states, and the more moderate Iranian position 
in the Organizaton of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reflect a 
realization at least in one faction in the Iranian leadership that Iran needs 
to trade, sell oil, secure international credit and technology, and get on with 
the task of postwar reconstruction. The pragmatists will in due course reassert 
themselves, but they will need time.

PORTER RANCH GRADING PLAN BIGGEST EVER; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPER WANTS TO MOVE 40 MILLION CUBIC YARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plan to develop 1,300 hilly acres in Porter Ranch calls for moving enough 
earth to fill the Rose Bowl about 50 times. 
</P>
<P>
The developer of the $2-billion residential and commercial project estimates 
that 40 million cubic yards of earth must be graded during a 20-year 
construction period. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles city officials say they have not kept a running total of grading 
approved in recent history, but they cannot remember a single project in the 
city with more grading than proposed in Porter Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody remembers anything in terms of grading on that scale," said Frank 
Orbin, assistant chief of the city Department of Building and Safety's grading 
division. "Not even close to that size." 
</P>
<P>
"We're certainly up there," Paul Clarke, spokesman for Porter Ranch Development 
Co., said about the huge amount of grading proposed. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics of the development proposal say the grading and reshaping of the 
hills north of the Simi Valley Freeway are excessive. But Clarke noted that 
existing Los Angeles zoning law allows home construction that would result in 
substantial grading anyway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Least Controversial Segment 
</P>
<P>
The least controversial part of the Porter Ranch proposal is development of 
single-family houses, and that portion of the plan alone accounts for about 80% 
of the project's estimated grading, according to the developer's environmental 
impact report. 
</P>
<P>
The development firm, run by Beverly Hills builder Nathan Shapell, wants to 
build 2,195 single-family houses, 800 multifamily housing units and 7.5 million 
square feet of commercial space in the hilly Porter Ranch area of Chatsworth. 
City Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the area, has recommended reducing 
the commercial area to about 6 million square feet and adding 400 multifamily 
housing units. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Planning Commission is scheduled to consider the plan Thursday, 
although the panel is awaiting a decision from the city attorney's office on 
whether two members have a conflict of interest that would bar the commission 
from hearing the matter. 
</P>
<P>
If the commission cannot hear the application, the Board of Referred Powers, 
which is made up of City Council members, would have to make recommendations on 
the plan to the full council. 
</P>
<P>
To comprehend the amount of grading proposed for the Porter Ranch project, 
consider how much soil it would take to fill the Rose Bowl. Since the facility 
has a volume of about 814,000 cubic yards, according to the city of Pasadena, 
the amount of earth to be graded at Porter Ranch would fill the stadium about 
50 times. 
</P>
<P>
Or consider the amount of concrete used to build Hoover Dam in Nevada -- 3.25 
million cubic yards. The amount of earth to be graded in Porter Ranch would be 
about 12 times that amount. 
</P>
<P>
The 40 million cubic yards to be graded, if massed into a giant cube, would be 
1,026 feet high. By comparison, City Hall is about 450 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
Workers operating 100 bulldozers eight hours a day, five days a week would need 
at least two years to grade 40 million cubic yards, said Frank Byron, an 
engineer with McCoy Construction Co., a Calabasas firm that specializes in 
grading. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke has described the project as the largest in the city's history by one 
landowner on one piece of land. The elevation of the hilly site ranges from 
1,150 to 1,850 feet above sea level. 
</P>
<P>
The grading is described in the project's environmental impact report as "cut 
and fill." "Cut" refers to the taking of land off hilltops, and "fill" refers 
to the movement of that earth into valleys. In other words, little or no earth 
is removed from the site, which becomes more level. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hillside Development 
</P>
<P>
The grading proposed for Porter Ranch would take place over the life of the 
project, development company officials said. And the environmental impact 
report points out that far smaller hillside developments in Los Angeles have 
resulted in moving more earth per acre or per home than is proposed in Porter 
Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in the Santa Monica Mountains, the 117-acre Bel-Air Crest Estates 
project resulted in 6.7 million cubic yards of grading, or about 57,000 per 
acre. The grading proposed for Porter Ranch is about 30,000 cubic yards per 
acre. 
</P>
<P>
With any project, heavy grading can become necessary because housing demand and 
the high cost of land prompt developers to make projects as dense as possible, 
said Brian Heller, an Agoura Hills builder. 
</P>
<P>
Building more homes means doing more grading, Heller said. "If the land prices 
hadn't escalated so much and demand hadn't been so high, they could have built 
five-acre lots" in Porter Ranch, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, McCoy Construction recently completed grading 56 million 
cubic yards for a 3,500-home project in the San Clemente area, Byron said. The 
original estimate was 30 million cubic yards, but buttressing the project to 
prevent landslides resulted in nearly twice as much grading, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, the Porter Ranch spokesman, noted that the total amount of grading in 
the past 20 years for the 5,000 existing homes in the Porter Ranch area of 
Northridge probably exceeds 40 million cubic yards, although the homes were not 
approved as a single project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sheer Amount 
</P>
<P>
Still, the sheer amount of grading has drawn criticism from some opponents of 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
"There won't be anything left of nature when they get through," said Jan 
Hinkston, founder of the Santa Susana Mountain Park Assn. "It's too much of an 
impact." 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously 40 million cubic yards is egregiously too much," said Robert Birch, 
a spokesman for the PRIDE residents group, which opposes the project. 
</P>
<P>
The developer's environmental impact report said the grading effects would be 
minimal because of various measures to control erosion and prevent landslides. 
But the report also addresses how the project's reshaping of hills would affect 
the visual appearance of the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Development of the specific plan area would permanently alter the visual 
character of the site from surrounding areas," the report said. "Views of 
existing undeveloped rolling hills would be changed to views of residential and 
commercial development and landscaping with some open space remaining." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Big Dig 
</P>
<P>
City Hall gives some perspective to the amount of soil that would be moved at 
Porter Ranch. The development calls for an estimated 40 million cubic yard (a 
cube 1,026 ft. on all sides of grading during the 20-year construction period. 
It is the largest total amount for any Los Angeles project in recent memory, 
although builders of smaller hillside projects in the city have graded more per 
acre or per housing unit. The total amount of earth that would be moved in 
Porter Ranch is about 50 times the volume of the Rose Bowl and 12 times the 
volume of concrete in the Hoover Dam. A fleet of 100 bulldozers would take at 
least two years to complete the job.

MEXICO FOR THE MOMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manuel Escobedo, atop a galloping palomino, thundered alongside a fleeing steer 
and seized its tail barehanded. But the steer slipped his grasp and dashed off, 
its dignity intact. 
</P>
<P>
"No luck for Manuel Escobedo," an announcer boomed in Spanish over loudspeakers 
to a few dozen spectators in the grandstands. Escobedo, disappointed that the 
steer had not fallen, trotted off while a ragtag brass band pumped out an 
energetic Mexican march. 
</P>
<P>
It was a scene straight out of a Mexican rancho. One would never guess that 
this was really Saugus, just three miles up a canyon road from a burgeoning 
suburban housing tract. But for six months, 20 to 30 horsemen have gathered 
each Sunday afternoon at a whitewashed riding ring in San Francisquito Canyon 
to test their horses and their skills in the classic Mexican rodeo or 
charreada. 
</P>
<P>
For just a few hours, Saugus is transformed into Zacatecas, Durango or Jalisco, 
all Mexican states rich in the traditions of the Mexican cowboy or charro. The 
weekly events are a chance, said Escobedo, "to conserve our Mexican culture." 
</P>
<P>
The arena was built along San Francisquito Canyon Road a year ago by Leonardo 
Lopez, an Encino resident and owner of a chain of Mexican restaurants. 
Originally from the Mexican state of Durango, Lopez, 39, also heads an 
association of charros that includes horsemen from the San Fernando, Santa 
Clarita and neighboring valleys. 
</P>
<P>
The ring has become a regular stopping place for some of the 27 other charro 
associations in the state. For a $6 fee, fans can cheer and jeer the charros 
and listen to a brass band or mariachis. A few extra dollars buys beer and 
tacos. Cheapskates, unwilling to pay, sometimes park their trucks on a nearby 
bluff and, standing on the roofs, watch the proceedings from afar. 
</P>
<P>
The rodeos have not gone without criticism. Some neighbors have complained 
about the band music that fills San Francisquito Canyon each Sunday. Some 
spectators have blocked driveways with their cars or dumped litter. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them are pretty careless about throwing away their beer cans," said 
Linda Cullen, who lives on the 80-acre Lady Linda Ranch next door. But, Cullen 
added, Lopez has responded to the complaints. "It's improved since they first 
came out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'100% Mexican' 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Sunday, the ever-present announcer promised a sparse crowd that 
"these charreadas are 100% Mexican." For the most part, that's true. Spanish 
was the language of the day, and the tempting aroma of carnitas -- pork 
simmering in a big black caldron -- overpowered the smell of corrals. 
</P>
<P>
But the charreadas, through an appealing mix of American mass culture and 
Mexican tradition, offered reminders that this really was Saugus. Two fans in 
the grandstands recorded the competition on videotape. A little boy twirling a 
lasso wore a western shirt, chaps -- and a Boston Red Sox cap. While most 
charros swigged Budweisers, one sipped Perrier. 
</P>
<P>
The events in the charreada, however, have not been changed and differ from 
those in American rodeos. While cowboys ride bulls and broncos one-handed for a 
maximum eight seconds, charros use two hands and hold on until they give out or 
the animals give up. 
</P>
<P>
Only Mexicans perform the coleadero, a feat in which points are awarded for 
sending a charging steer tumbling with a yank on the tail. The points vary, 
depending on where and how the animal falls down. Charros can even lose points 
for a bad performance. The scoring is so complicated, the charros said, judges 
often keep an open rule book at their side. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Activists Disapprove 
</P>
<P>
Animal activists have branded the coleadero and other charreada events as 
inhumane to animals. But on a recent Sunday in Saugus, the steers seemed to be 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Escobedo was the fourth charro to fail in the coleadero. Seven more 
tried without success. Some never touched the tail. "Zero points for Ruben 
Gutierrez," blared the loudspeaker. 
</P>
<P>
The 12th rider up was Fernando Lopez, the 11-year-old son of Leonardo Lopez. 
Perhaps by accident, or perhaps as a joke, he was sent after the largest steer 
of the day, a muscular animal of mottled brown and black. He held the tail 
briefly before letting go. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando later recalled that once, at a different charreada, a steer actually 
went down after he tugged its tail. "That was luck," he said. "It tripped over 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Fernando would have no such luck today. It seemed that neither would anyone 
else. The steers outwitted three riders after him. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, charro Rodrigo Barunda snatched a steer's tail and wrapped it around 
his outstretched right leg. The steer pulled right, but Barunda pulled left. 
The steer went down and the crowd cheered. Even the spectators on the nearby 
bluff applauded. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard work. Risky too. "They can lose fingers," Escobedo said. In the world 
of charros, "everything is dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Tradition 
</P>
<P>
Escobedo, like most of the charros, is originally from Mexico. A ruggedly 
handsome man of 42, he learned to ride on a ranch in Zacatecas. As his father 
had taught him, he is teaching his own son, Esteban, 10, to rope and ride. "He 
rides well," he said with satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
The lure of the charreada is understandable for Escobedo and other Mexican 
immigrants. The rodeo is the national sport of Mexico and charros have been 
long celebrated in songs, movies and on television. So just as the charreada 
transforms Saugus into a slice of Jalisco, the weekly event also transforms 
ordinary men into the dashing Mexican equivalent of John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Gerardo Gandara, 29, a native of Zacatecas living in Sylmar. During 
the week, "I'm a truck driver," he said. But on horseback, the stocky man is 
surprisingly agile and graceful, completely in control. The tiny crowd cheered 
as Gandara skillfully roped a sprinting mare. 
</P>
<P>
It's doubtful that the Saugus charros perform to hear the roar of the crowd. 
The grandstands could hold more than 100, but sometimes just 60 people attend. 
Sometimes 40.

"Sometimes, nobody," said a guard at the gate.

Friendly Competition 
</P>
<P>
The small crowd does not discourage the riders. "This is nothing more than 
practice," Escobedo said. And although the announcer awarded points for 
well-performed feats, nobody kept score. "This is a friendly competition," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the state's charro associations sometimes compete for titles. But 
often enough, they ride just for the sake of riding. James H. Nottage, chief 
curator of the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum in Griffith Park, said 
charros traditionally have savored their sport not for awards, but for the 
demands it places on man and beast. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1800s, Mexican cowboys in California sometimes would rope grizzly bears 
"as a matter of sport," Nottage said. "Of course, it was a very risky 
competition."

EDUCATORS SAY FORMER BOSS'S ELECTION WOULD BE 'DISASTER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of teachers and administrators who worked under Los Angeles school 
board candidate Jerry Horowitz during his 10-year tenure as principal of Frost 
Junior High School said Sunday that his election would be "a disaster of 
gigantic proportions." 
</P>
<P>
The educators characterized Horowitz as a vindictive administrator who used his 
authority to harass and intimidate those who questioned his policies and 
administrative style. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 educators, who kept silent when parents of Frost students complained 
about Horowitz's transfer to Byrd Junior High last year, said they do not 
necessarily support incumbent Julie Korenstein. But, they said, they organized 
Sunday's impromptu press conference because they fear for the future of 
education in Los Angeles if Horowitz is elected to represent the West San 
Fernando Valley in Tuesday's runoff. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not doing this because I want to see Korenstein elected. I am doing this 
because Horowitz is so unfit for public office," said Paul Sickler, who taught 
English at Frost from its 1969 opening until 1980. He was English Department 
chairman for two years. "He is divisive, scheming and unproductive. His 
election would be a disaster of gigantic proportions." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blames Korenstein 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz said that the accusations are groundless and that he believes 
Korenstein engineered the gathering in an effort to sully his reputation and 
keep her on the school board. 
</P>
<P>
"This is desperation politics -- a continuation of a mudslinging campaign," he 
said. "It's obvious that her failing campaign needed a shot in the arm to help 
her sink to this level." 
</P>
<P>
Irena Szewiola, who was assistant principal under Horowitz, said Horowitz's 
"technique for someone who doesn't fall in line was getting revenge." 
</P>
<P>
The teachers claimed that Horowitz frequently berated faculty members in front 
of students and other teachers, and that he used teacher evaluations as weapons 
in personal vendettas against teachers he did not like. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Trout, who was a counselor at Frost, and Szewiola said counselors and 
administrators often arrived at work to discover that Horowitz had removed 
their nameplates from their office doors. Faculty members who crossed Horowitz 
were sometimes ordered to change offices overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the sign that you had done something wrong," Trout said. "And our 
powers kept changing on a monthly basis. He always wanted to keep you off 
guard." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong-Arm Tactics 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz denied using strong-arm tactics to intimidate staff members he 
disliked. He added that he is dedicated to "getting rid of incompetent 
teachers." He said he has received high evaluations from many of his teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Porter, the financial manager at Frost until November, 1987, said 
Horowitz refused to allow a late afternoon bus so that minority students from 
the inner city could participate in extracurricular activities after school. 
The only buses, she said, left immediately after school. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why there were no black cheerleaders," she said. "They couldn't stay." 
</P>
<P>
But Horowitz said that there generally were late afternoon buses two days a 
week and that school officials tried to coordinate extracurricular activities 
with the afternoon buses. When the buses didn't run, he said, other 
transportation, such as private cars, was available to students. 
</P>
<P>
Porter charged that Horowitz used $1,800 in student body funds to buy a 
high-technology typewriter for his executive secretary. Student body funds are 
reserved for student services, Porter said. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz said the typewriter was purchased to print documents for students at 
their request. He said his secretary also used it. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz said Porter is disgruntled that she no longer is at the school.

NBA CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES; 
</P>
<P>
A DEEPER CUT; 
</P>
<P>
COOPER WASN'T HURT BY STITCHES AS MUCH AS DWINDLING RESPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scar is barely noticeable now, much to Michael Cooper's displeasure. He 
thought it quite becoming, a perfect embellishment for the half-crazed, 
tough-guy image the Laker guard has long cultivated. 
</P>
<P>
There is only a trace of his infamous accident in which Cooper butted his head 
against a metal railing in the Forum the morning of the Lakers' playoff opener 
against the Portland Trail Blazers, resulting in a deep cut that required 21 
stitches. 
</P>
<P>
The stitches have long since dissolved, even though his teammates' laughter has 
not. A patch of hair has covered most of the two-inch scar. Drops of blood at 
the accident scene, left as a sort of a shrine in what now is dubbed Coop's 
Corner, have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad, really. More than ever Cooper needs to look, as well as act, tough. 
There will be no backing down, Cooper said, when the Lakers meet the physical 
and -- some say -- thuggish Detroit Pistons in the National Basketball Assn. 
championship series. 
</P>
<P>
Starting Tuesday with Game 1, the versatile Cooper will be asked to guard any 
number of Pistons -- from Isiah Thomas to Bill Laimbeer to Dennis Rodman -- as 
well as match Rodman in "bad" behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gone, man," said a rueful Cooper, putting hand to head. "I'll have to 
think of something else. They may be the Bad Boys, but they gotta know I'm bad, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons might remember Cooper as bad, but in a different context than 
Cooper would hope. In last season's finals against Detroit, Cooper made only 
nine of 44 shots while being hampered throughout the playoffs by a lingering 
left ankle sprain. 
</P>
<P>
Traces of the ankle injury are gone. And the 33-year-old Cooper, second only to 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in seasons of service with the Lakers, has undergone a 
renewal in the playoffs after a sub-par regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Going into the finals, Cooper has averaged 6.1 points. He sank seven 
three-point baskets in the Western Conference finals sweep of Phoenix. And, he 
has returned to his role as a defensive specialist by helping to contain 
Seattle's Dale Ellis and the Suns' Kevin Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper's play, especially during the Suns' series, was part of a rejuvenation 
of the Lakers' reserves, who will need to continue to play well if they are to 
challenge the Pistons deep and talented bench. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's been any change in my game," said Cooper, who made only 
43% of his shots and was even occasionally benched by Coach Pat Riley during 
the regular season. "I've just picked up my game." 
</P>
<P>
It is as if that shot to the forehead has erased Cooper's memory of his 
troubled regular season, which had some thinking Cooper's time had passed. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't lost anything," Cooper said, shaking his head indignantly. "There's 
nothing I can't still do." 
</P>
<P>
That includes, apparently, retaining his title as, by far, the wackiest Laker 
player. Teammates were aghast when Cooper ran into the locker room with blood 
oozing from his forehead. But when Cooper came back later that night all 
stitched up but smiling, they dismissed it as just another manifestation of 
Cooper's zany persona. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, teammates suggested that the injury was not serious, because it 
was only Cooper's head. Jerry West, the Lakers' general manager, started 
affectionately calling Cooper "zipperhead." His reputation soared. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knows I'm the team masochist," Cooper said at the time of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Cooper has reveled in the retelling of the incident. Now, he is 
claiming that running into the railing was intentional. 
</P>
<P>
His thinking? Well, since the injury required 21 stitches, and since Cooper 
wears No. 21, the head butting must have been cosmically preordained or 
something. 
</P>
<P>
While being interviewed by a reporter from Phoenix a week ago, Cooper winked at 
a few Los Angeles writers and launched into his act with mock sincerity. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't mellowed at all," Cooper said. "It's getting worse. This time of 
year, it's very difficult around the Cooper household, and I have to act 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
"The craziest thing I've done is, to get myself ready for the playoffs, I ran 
into this thing on purpose. A lot of people thought it was an accident." 
</P>
<P>
But if Cooper can joke about this playoff injury, last season's left ankle 
sprain is still a sore spot. Actually, the pain is gone, but Cooper said he so 
feels the sting of his poor performance against the Pistons that he does not 
want to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
By the same token, Cooper doesn't really like to talk about the first half of 
this season. It was a continuation of his playoff problems, prompting some to 
say Cooper was losing it. 
</P>
<P>
The low point, by most accounts, came on Jan. 3 at Seattle, when Riley benched 
Cooper after he had played three non-productive and uninspired minutes in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
"That (a benching) is never a low point," Cooper said. "I don't think anyone 
who's competitive and has to be sat down is going to be happy about it. But my 
game showed why I should be benched, and Coach Riley acted accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
"It got everybody thinking and got me going. After that, I had to get back into 
myself first before I could even get back with the team. I had to reevaluate my 
priorities. My No. 1 priority for this ballclub is to play defense, and I 
wasn't doing that. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why. Maybe I thought it was going to be a given this year, taking 
it too easy, too laid back." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he sensed Cooper's malaise. He said he tried to dismiss it for a 
while, but eventually had to take action to try to shock Cooper out of his 
stupor. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it," Riley said. "We knew in training camp that we had eight spots 
and we'd divvy up playing time, so there's not a lot of incentive. The only 
motivation for professionals is the bench. Sometimes, that doesn't even 
motivate them. But, if you've got proud players they'll want to perform well, 
and you don't have to threaten them with the bench." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly thereafter, Cooper's playing time increased because of Byron Scott's 
urological disorder and the partially torn left hamstring that sidelined Magic 
Johnson for six games. 
</P>
<P>
In 13 games as a starter, Cooper averaged 10.4 points and 6.6 assists. More 
important to the Lakers, Cooper's defensive prowess returned whether he was 
starting or coming off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
It did not return in time for Cooper to be named to the league's all-defensive 
team in a vote of NBA coaches. Cooper had been voted defensive player of the 
year in 1986-87 and, until this season, was included on either the first or 
second teams for eight consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
Snubbed this season, though, Cooper took it as a personal affront. On the day 
the team was announced, Cooper graphically said that being excluded would only 
give him more motivation to stop Suns' point-guard Kevin Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Cooper's defensive surge was evident in the Seattle series. Early in 
the fourth quarter of Game 1, SuperSonic guard Sedale Threatt sliced through a 
Laker trap for what looked to be an easy layup. 
</P>
<P>
But, Cooper came over from the baseline, glided across the lane and swatted 
Threatt's shot to Magic Johnson, who converted it into a Laker fast-break 
basket. What might have been a three-point Laker lead swelled to a seven-point 
advantage. The Lakers were not threatened again. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Cooper's defensive work has not been as flashy. As part of a 
double-team on the Suns' Kevin Johnson, Cooper merely helped keep the ball out 
of Johnson's hands and often forced him to turn it over when he did have it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody needs a kick in the pants sometime during the season," 
Cooper said. "Mine came when I didn't make the defensive team. That just 
happened to be the motivating point for me." 
</P>
<P>
Another motivational tool for Cooper was when people whispered early in the 
season that age had caught up with him. After all, when was the last time you 
have seen a Coop-a-loop? 
</P>
<P>
"I never doubted that with Michael," Riley said. "I still saw enough quickness, 
intensity, three-point shooting and defense. That was always there. Those 
intangibles are what he's best at. 
</P>
<P>
"He did have some poor shooting games, and it bent people out of shape. They 
wrote him off." 
</P>
<P>
Even worse, as far as Cooper was concerned, they weren't writing about him at 
all. When he played poorly, he was merely another symptom of a team-wide slump. 
</P>
<P>
"They say I'm too old, but I haven't even played half the time in games," said 
Cooper, who has averaged 27.5 minutes per game in his 11-season career. "I'm a 
young 33. I haven't had to sustain 40 minutes a game. I don't feel old. The 
only time I feel old is when I go home and see my son getting bigger." 
</P>
<P>
Said teammate James Worthy: "Coop's in great shape. He can keep up with players 
a lot younger than him. He has a young body. Look at him. Age doesn't indicate 
what kind of shape he's in." 
</P>
<P>
Physically and mentally, Cooper appears in playoff shape. He has segued into 
his aggressive attitude, bordering on his own kind of lunacy in the Lakers' 
week off before Tuesday night's opener at the Palace. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper once said that, "I'm not schizo; I have three personalities." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he has amended that. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to about six now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And who says the Laker bench lacks depth.

REDS FINISH THREE-GAME SWEEP BY BRUSHING OFF THE PADRES, 5-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

CINCINNATI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Padres pulled into Cincinnati three days ago for the start of a 10-game 
swing through the heart of the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
They were riding a three-game winning streak, one of the best road records in 
the majors and talking like the best of times were just ahead. 
</P>
<P>
They left Sunday afternoon with a whole new perspective. 
</P>
<P>
That is what a three-game sweep by the Reds can do, especially one accomplished 
in such a dominating way. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds finished off their weekend cleaning with a 5-3 victory in front of 
29,005 at Riverfront Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the Reds' fourth in a row and, combined with San Francisco's 
loss in Atlanta, moved them into first place, percentage points ahead of the 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who started the series 1 1/2 games behind the leading Giants, are 3 
1/2 games back of the Reds and Giants after losing to Cincinnati for the fifth 
time in six games. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to mosey into town at an inopportune time," said Tony Gwynn, who had 
his second consecutive three-hit game. "We didn't play that bad, it is just 
that they had the big innings each game of the series. That kind of got us down 
a few runs and made it tough for us to come back." 
</P>
<P>
This time the Reds used a four-run sixth inning off starter Bruce Hurst to sink 
the Padres. Some of the damage was the Padres' own doing. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the Cincinnati runs scored on first baseman Jack Clark's wild throw to 
the plate on abases-loaded grounder with one out in the fifth. The throw sailed 
over the head of Mark Parent, the Padres' 6-foot 5-inch catcher, and hit off 
the wall near the Padre dugout. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hurried it," Clark said. "I was rushing, trying to get two outs, when I 
should have been worried about one." 
</P>
<P>
Around Clark's error, the Reds sandwiched an RBI double by Paul O'Neill and a 
run-scoring single by starting pitcher Danny Jackson. That was more than enough 
to wipe out what was left of a Padre 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We just gave them a win, that's all," Padre Manager Jack McKeon said. "You 
can't give that club an opening; you give them an opening and they are tough. 
They are tough hitters in the clutch." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres caught the Reds at a time when Eric Davis was revving up after 
returning from a hamstring injury that put him on the 15-day disabled list 
until May 19 and Barry Larkin was in the midst of stretching his hitting streak 
to 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who started the Reds' fifth-inning rally with a one-out single, was six 
for 11 in the series with two home runs and nine RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Larkin also went went six for 11 in the three games and scored five runs. His 
hitting streak, in which he has batted 26 for 56 to raise his average to .346, 
ties him with Milt Thompson of St. Louis for the longest in the National 
League. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a good team, and they are swinging the bat real well now," Hurst 
said. "We caught them at time when they probably are at one of their best 
streaks in the season. It would have taken a much better game from me to beat 
them." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who have not been generous in their support of Hurst, scoring 34 
runs in his previous 11 starts, did provide a 2-0 lead in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
The first run scored on a groundout to shortstop by Carmelo Martinez that 
brought home Gwynn, who had singled to lead off the inning. A throwing error by 
Larkin on a grounder by the next batter, Parent, allowed Clark to score. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who added a single in fifth, had reached base on a single. That extended 
his hitting streak to nine games, matching Gwynn for the team season high and 
raising his batting to .232, his highest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
But the lead quickly slipped away. 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Luis Quinones' home run in the fifth cut the advantage to 2-1 
before the Reds took the lead for good with four runs in the sixth, only one of 
which was earned. Hurst (5-4) left the game in the next inning for a 
pinch-hitter, having allowed five runs (two earned) and eight hits with two 
walks and five strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, meanwhile, pitched admirably for the Reds. Making his first start 
since receiving a cortisone injection after an examination Tuesday showed a 
calcium deposit in his big left toe, he struck out seven before leaving with 
one out in the seventh after the Padres scored their final run on Gwynn's RBI 
single. 
</P>
<P>
That made way for the Reds' bullpen duo of Rob Dibble and John Franco. 
</P>
<P>
Dibble struck out four of the five hitters he faced, including Martinez, Parent 
and Garry Templeton on the minimum nine pitches in the eighth. That gave Dibble 
23 strikeouts in his past 12 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Franco came on in the ninth, retiring the Padres in order to pick up his 16th 
save in 17 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
The only Padre of the five Dibble faced to avoid striking out was newly 
acquired Chris James, who flied out to end the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
The game was James' Padre debut. It was not a night to remember. 
</P>
<P>
James, acquired from Philadelphia Friday night, went zero for four to extend 
his hitless streak to 36 at-bats over 11 games. Included in the performance was 
an inning-ending called third strike with runners on second and third in the 
fifth and his fly out to right-center with two on against Dibble. 
</P>
<P>
In all, James left a total of six runners on base, four in scoring position, 
before he was replaced by Bip Roberts in the bottom of the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
James' last hit was an RBI single in a May 23 game in Los Angeles. That, by the 
way, was the last victory for the Phillies, who lost to Montreal Sunday to 
extend their streak to 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
James, who was acquired in exchange for John Kruk and Randy Ready, opened in 
right field. It was his first start in right this season after playing 37 games 
in left for the Phillies and seven at third base. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm going to break out of this some time," James said. "I hope it is 
soon."

Only a doubleheader against the Braves awaits them. 
</P>
<P>
After what the Houston Astros put them through over the weekend, the Dodgers 
might look at two nine-inning games as a breather. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, they're only scheduled for nine innings. 
</P>
<P>
They could go longer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just glad to be getting the hell out of here," Tim Belcher told reporters 
in the Astrodome. "These guys could beat the '27 Yankees, the way they're 
playing." 
</P>
<P>
His reference was to the Astros, who overcame a six-run deficit to beat the 
Dodgers, 7-6, on a 13th-inning sacrifice fly by Mike Scott. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the Astros' 10th straight, extending the longest such streak in 
the major leagues this season and equaling a club record. 
</P>
<P>
Among the victories were four straight over the Dodgers, including a 22-inning 
marathon Saturday night that wasn't decided until Rafael Ramirez produced a 
run-scoring single Sunday at 2:50 a.m., CST, ending the longest night game in 
major league history after 7 hours 14 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Those who speculated that such a loss might send the Dodgers into an even 
deeper tailspin -- they've lost six of seven -- were surprised when the Dodgers 
scored five runs in the first inning Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"Our mood was good all morning," said catcher Mike Scioscia, whose first career 
grand slam was the inning's highlight. "It was good even when they came back 
and tied the score." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hamilton's run-scoring double made it 6-0 in the third. 
</P>
<P>
So how did the Dodgers lose it? 
</P>
<P>
The game turned on a disputed call in the fifth inning by first-base umpire 
Paul Runge, who ruled that pinch-hitter Billy Hatcher, after grounding to first 
baseman Eddie Murray, beat the throw from Murray to Belcher. 
</P>
<P>
Television replays indicated that Hatcher was out. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have to see the replay," Belcher said. "In my opinion, it wasn't even 
close." 
</P>
<P>
The disputed single scored a run, cutting the Astros' deficit to 6-1, and left 
the bases loaded with one out. 
</P>
<P>
More important, it seemed to leave Belcher unnerved. 
</P>
<P>
The next batter, seldom-used Louie Meadows, launched a grand slam, his first 
home run of the season, over the wall in right field. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be the first one in line to congratulate Louie Meadows for hitting the . . 
. out of the ball," Belcher said, "but, in my opinion, the whole inning was set 
up by a bad call at first base. If we get the correct call there, it's a 
different inning. 
</P>
<P>
"And if they don't bloop a couple, it's different." 
</P>
<P>
Before the controversial call, Ramirez reached first on an infield single, 
Craig Reynolds flared a single to shallow center and Craig Biggio walked. 
</P>
<P>
If Hatcher had been called out, Belcher said, "I certainly wouldn't have given 
in to (Meadows) and given him any fastballs even close. But the bases were 
loaded and I fell behind, 2-0, in the count. 
</P>
<P>
"And he beat me." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the Astros still trailed, 6-5, as they did with two out in the ninth 
and Biggio at the plate to face reliever Jay Howell. 
</P>
<P>
What happened next? 
</P>
<P>
"I threw it and he hit it," Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
It landed 390 feet away, beyond the left-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
"That's about the size of it," Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers managed only four hits after the third inning, but one of them was 
a one-out triple by Chris Gwynn in the 12th. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds, the Astros' left fielder, then made a running catch on a looping fly 
ball by Dave Anderson. Usually an infielder, Reynolds followed with a 
one-bounce side-arm throw to the plate to nail Gwynn, who had tagged. 
</P>
<P>
In the 13th, the Dodgers' Alejandro Pena walked Bill Doran, who stole second 
and continued to third when catcher Rick Dempsey threw the ball into center 
field. Pena then walked Ramirez and intentionally walked Reynolds before second 
baseman Willie Randolph made a nice play, gloving a sharp grounder by Biggio 
and throwing home for a force. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, though, followed with a fly ball to center fielder Jose Gonzalez, whose 
throw to the plate was too late to get Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros had their sweep. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't say we lost these games here or we lost these games there," Scioscia 
said. "You've got to give the Astros some credit." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Jim Deshaies took a no-hitter into the eighth inning of the first game 
of the series, a 7-2 Astro victory, and Scott pitched a four-hit shutout 
Friday. And then the Astros survived two marathons. 
</P>
<P>
They had a starting pitcher, making his first relief appearance, win a game 
with a sacrifice fly. And an infielder make a key play in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some breakdowns," Scioscia said, "but overall we've played good 
baseball. We're starting to do the job offensively. We're moving runners along. 
Now, we just have to get some hits with guys on base. 
</P>
<P>
"Things will work out." 
</P>
<P>
Escaping Texas, perhaps, will hasten the process. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Never before had a game at Houston included two grand slams. The expansion 
Astros joined the National League in 1962. . . . Mike Scott worked the 13th 
inning for the Astros to improve his record to 9-3. . . . Before Saturday, the 
Dodgers were 17-3 in games in which they scored at least four runs. . . . 
Mickey Hatcher, who strained his left hamstring while running from first base 
to third in the first inning of Saturday night's game, was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list by the Dodgers, who moved relief pitcher Ray Searage to the 
21-day list. . . . Hatcher was replaced on the roster by pitcher Ramon 
Martinez, who was recalled from the Dodgers' triple-A affiliate at Albuquerque, 
N.M., where he was 8-1 with a 2.61 earned-run average and 88 strikeouts in 76 
innings. Martinez will start the first game of today's doubleheader at Atlanta.

ANGEL PITCHING IS NO RELIEF TO THE ROYALS, WHO LOSE, 5-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We've seen Chuck Finley and Kirk McCaskill throw back-to-back shutouts in 
Fenway Park. We've seen Jim Abbott outduel Roger Clemens. But did we ever 
expect the day when Angel starting pitching might be too good? 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of another near shutout and another Angel victory Sunday 
afternoon, this by 5-1 over the Kansas City Royals, Manager Doug Rader said it 
is reaching that point, which is one reason why stopper Bryan Harvey was 
pitching in the ninth inning with a four-run lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not getting enough people work," Rader said. "We're at a point where 
we're going to have to start expanding roles, where we have to put people in 
slightly off-center roles to get them some work, like Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, we can't possibly expect him to be ready to do his assigned job." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey's assigned job is to save games, to face the potential tying run with 
two out in the ninth inning and to pump three pressurized strikes past the 
batter. His territory is close games, his mission is to close them. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, however, Harvey's right arm has done little more than fill one sleeve 
in his warmup jacket. And on those rare dates when he does pitch, Harvey has 
been worse for his lack of wear, blowing his last two save opportunities along 
with a 2-0 lead May 10 at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
The inactivity has led to rustiness, Rader said, which is why Harvey has only a 
total of five saves, a figure on which he has been stuck for a month. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely," Rader said. "Especially when we had that real good run (in early 
May), when our starters would go into the seventh and eighth innings every game 
and we'd be working with big leads. Many games, the lead would call for Moonie 
(set-up reliever Greg Minton) and he did so well, you tend to go with the hot 
hand." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Harvey would remain on the shelf, getting cold. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday figured to be another day of Harvey sitting idly by, watching Bert 
Blyleven polish off the staff's latest complete game. Through eight innings, 
Blyleven (6-2) had a shutout intact, yielding only four hits and striking out 
Bo Jackson three times. 
</P>
<P>
But Bert-Bo IV saw the other side of all-or-nothing, with Jackson delivering a 
Blyleven change-up into the right-field seats for his 13th home run of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Blyleven walked Pat Tabler. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Rader decided to call in Harvey, who had pitched only one inning in the 
previous nine days. 
</P>
<P>
There was no save to nail down, but, Rader thought, three crisp outs would be 
nice. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey came through, sandwiching strikeouts of Danny Tartabull and Mike 
Macfarlane around a routine fly-ball out by Bill Buckner. 
</P>
<P>
"Phew," Harvey said. "That's the best I've thrown probably since the first 
month. It's been a long time. Finally, I was getting prepared in my head and 
getting people out, instead of worrying about everything else." 
</P>
<P>
Such as? 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe just sitting so long," he said. "And, having a couple bad outings. After 
a while, you start worrying." 
</P>
<P>
And, for a relief pitcher, Harvey notes, worrying is a bad thing. 
</P>
<P>
"This game gets you in trouble if you start thinking about it," he said, 
grinning. 
</P>
<P>
Until the ninth inning, Blyleven had turned this one into a no-brainer. Just 
send the 38-year-old out there and let him throw curveballs until the Royals 
drop. 
</P>
<P>
Through seven innings, the only solid hit allowed by Blyleven was a line-drive 
single by Kevin Seitzer in the first inning. Two others never left the infield 
-- a ground ball to third base that Tabler beat out and a high chopper to first 
by Buckner. 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Stillwell stroked a double with two out in the eighth, but Blyleven came 
back to retire Seitzer on a ground ball to take the shutout bid into the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
A historic shutout it would have been, too. With it, Blyleven would have moved 
into a tie for 11th on the all-time list -- Pud Galvin also recorded 57 
shutouts -- and it would have given the Angels their 12th shutout of 1989, 
tying their single-season high for this decade. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven was working with a 5-0 lead, courtesy of a few major league debut 
jitters from Royal starter Kevin Appier, who allowed a run-scoring single to 
Chili Davis and bases-loaded walk to Brian Downing in the fourth inning, and a 
two-run home run by Jack Howell in the sixth. Blyleven opened the ninth against 
Jackson, who had gone 0 for 3 -- getting caught twice on curveballs and once on 
a fastball. 
</P>
<P>
So what does Blyleven show him on the first pitch? 
</P>
<P>
A changeup. 
</P>
<P>
All it wound up changing was the final score. 
</P>
<P>
"It was some kind of pitch Bert tried to invent," Rader quipped. 
</P>
<P>
Professor Blyleven said he thought it wasn't a bad idea, at least for a few 
seconds, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd struck him out three times," Blyleven reasoned, "and I knew he'd be 
looking for a curveball. I had a 5-0 lead, why not try something? 
</P>
<P>
"Mentally, I outsmarted myself. I took something off a fastball and he smacked 
it." 
</P>
<P>
With the shutout spoiled, Rader moved as quickly as it took Blyleven to walk 
Tabler, the next batter he faced. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy has pitched I-don't-know-how-many shutouts and I'm sure every one 
means something to him," Rader said. "With a big lead, I'm going to give him a 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
"When (the shutout) is no longer reality, that's when you've got to go with 
other people." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jack Howell, hitting .201 entering Sunday's game, came up with a two-run home 
run and single in three at-bats. Howell admitted the Angels' quick start has 
helped camouflage his own struggles and for that, he said, he is grateful. 
"Instead of being that real big obvious weak link in the lineup on a mediocre 
club," Howell said, "we're winning and, hopefully, you get overlooked so you 
can fight through some things. Basically, we've had such great pitching and 
we've been winning (so many) games that it's allowed me to be able to stay in 
the lineup and fight through it. Thank God for that." 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City rookie Kevin Appier, making his major league debut as a replacement 
for the injured Bret Saberhagen, lasted 5 1/3 innings, allowing four runs on 
eight hits and four walks. His opponent, 19-year veteran Bert Blyleven, chalked 
it up to nerves -- and the lineup he had to break in against. "I knew going 
into the game that he was going to have a lot of adrenaline going," Blyleven 
said. "I think he's got good stuff and he threw pretty well. He just ran into a 
ballclub that's hot right now."

WICHITA STATE CAN'T HANDLE KELLER

Clyde Keller hears the baiting every time he takes the mound for Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated hitters at the plate and in the dugout are never shy or tactful with 
their requests for something more macho than Keller's deceptive palmball. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're going to yell and scream about not getting enough fastballs, that's 
fine," said Keller, a senior right-hander from Carmichael, Calif. "But, I'm 
just going to go out and get them out with I've got." 
</P>
<P>
Keller had Wichita State in the palm of his hand Sunday night, pitching a 
complete-game, four-hitter as the top-seeded Seminoles defeated the Shockers, 
4-2, in the second round of the College World Series before a crowd of 15,800 
at Rosenblatt Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State (54-16), which remains unbeaten in the East Division of the 
eight-team double-elimination tournament, will play Wednesday against the 
winner of Tuesday's game between Wichita State (64-16) and Arkansas (51-15). 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas defeated North Carolina, 7-3, Sunday afternoon, eliminating the Tar 
Heels (41-18-1). 
</P>
<P>
Wichita State arrived in Omaha with a .327 team batting average -- the highest 
in the tournament. The Shockers, however, never got a bead on the 5-foot-9, 
160-pound Keller (13-0) who struck out four and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
Keller surrendered two runs in the sixth, then retired the final 11 batters he 
faced. 
</P>
<P>
"His palmball comes in there looking pretty fat," Wichita State catcher Eric 
Wedge said. "Then it just blows away." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Reboin broke a 2-2 tie in the seventh inning with a single off Wichita 
State starter Pat Cedeno (12-4) that scored Rocky Rau, who had singled to lead 
off the inning and moved to second on a sacrifice by Pedro Grifol. 
</P>
<P>
Grifol, the Seminole catcher, provided the final run in the ninth with a solo 
homer to left off Shocker relief ace Jim Newlin. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a big step forward in the first game," said Wichita State Coach Gene 
Stephenson, whose team defeated Arkansas on Friday, "and a giant step back 
tonight."

Cal State Long Beach (50-14) plays Louisiana State (53-16) today in a West

TINLEY WINS TRIATHLON AT MISSION VIEJO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One way to win a race is to make sure the only race is behind you, which is 
what Scott Tinley did Sunday in the Orange County Performing Arts Center 
Triathlon. 
</P>
<P>
"My whole tactic was out of sight, out of mind," Tinley said. 
</P>
<P>
Tinley of Encinitas came out of the water of Lake Mission Viejo in third place 
after the 1,500-meter swim, bolted to the lead in a pack of three in the first 
mile of the 40-kilometer bike ride and pulled away by the midway point. 
</P>
<P>
He was soon out of sight, and on the way to victory in 1 hour 54 minutes 14 
seconds, finishing more than three minutes ahead of Emilio DeSoto of San Diego 
for his third victory in the triathlon's four-year history. His only loss was 
last year, to Scott Molina of Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's race, Laurie Samuelson, 33, of Carlsbad, opened up a lead of as 
much as a mile on the bike ride, and never let up, winning in 2:13.37, 49 
seconds ahead of Sue Latshaw, 28, a plant pathologist from Berkeley who won the 
first triathlon she entered in 1986. Melissa Mantak, 27, of Denver was third, 
31 seconds behind Latshaw. 
</P>
<P>
In Tinley's wake, 43-year-old Bill Leach of Irvine dueled Peter Kain, 25, of 
Los Gatos. After negotiating the hills and turns of a course he called his 
"home-court," Leach pulled into the transition area, second among more than 
1,500 entrants. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Murchison, 27, of Denver, ran down Kain for third. Kain finished fifth, 
and Leach finished eighth, one place and 51 seconds out of the money.

Fignon finished the sprint in 24th place, 2 minutes 16 seconds behind Piasecki,

CONNER TO RACE FOR NEW SYNDICATE IN 1992

Whether the America's Cup is in San Diego or Auckland, New Zealand, skipper 
Dennis Conner will be racing for it in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Conner announced Sunday the formation of "Team Dennis Conner," the syndicate 
under which he will race for the next challenge, either in Auckland or San 
Diego -- pending an appeal by the America's Cup Organizing Committee to 
overturn a court decision that awarded New Zealand the cup. 
</P>
<P>
John Marshall, Conner's boat designer in 1987 and 1988, will head the 
syndicate, which Conner hopes will raise up to $35 million through private 
donations and corporate sponsorships. 
</P>
<P>
Conner said the funds are needed to build two boats, campaign worldwide and to 
run the crews, which will grow from 28 people to 60. 
</P>
<P>
He is confident that the syndicate can help the United States' chances of 
winning the America's Cup in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel this syndicate has hit the ground running with experienced, qualified 
winners that are capable of doing the job one more time," Conner said during a 
press conference at his home in Point Loma. "We can step up to bat and do an 
excellent job of representing America, whether it's in San Diego or New 
Zealand." 
</P>
<P>
The syndicate will be one of 26 challengers from 11 countries. Additional yacht 
clubs could join the race up until 30 days after the court decision has been 
rendered, the same time period that Conner must decide what club he will 
represent. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping to be sailing for the San Diego Yacht Club," he said. "I'm not 
deciding until the decision comes down." 
</P>
<P>
Conner put to rest any speculation that he would retire from America's Cup 
racing. After five appearances and with the current controversy, he said it 
wasn't the time to quit. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I may have retired," Conner said, "but it just doesn't seem right to 
me to have some judge in New York take the America's Cup, put a postage stamp 
on it and send it to New Zealand. They never beat us on the water . . . and 
it's not my way to stand by and not do what I can to bring the cup back."

IT WAS A DIFFERENCE OF STYLES IN THE PREAKNESS; 
</P>
<P>
VALENZUELA'S AGGRESSIVE WESTERN RIDING OVERWHELMED DAY'S EASTERN PATIENCE

<P>
A few years ago, near the end of his riding career, Don Pierce talked about the 
difference between riding horses in California and in the East. 
</P>
<P>
"In California, there is a completely different style of riding," said Pierce, 
who rode more than 180 stakes winners at Santa Anita and Hollywood Park before 
he turned to training. "Out here (California), the tendency is to ride tight. 
There's usually not a whole lot of room between horses. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to ride back East, when there wasn't year-round racing in California, 
and you could tell the difference. Back there, the style is to spread the 
horses out, with everybody giving everybody else a lot of room. You could drive 
a truck between horses in many of the Eastern races, compared to the tight 
quarters we're used to in California." 
</P>
<P>
Some Easterners do not like the aggressive Western style. They see tight riding 
as rough riding. When his Alydar won the 1978 Travers because of a foul by 
Affirmed and California jockey Laffit Pincay, trainer John Veitch said: "I 
expected Affirmed's number to come down. Pincay was using that bareback stuff 
that they get away with in California, but it doesn't cut it in New York." 
</P>
<P>
Similar tactics by Pat Valenzuela two weeks ago at Pimlico won the Preakness 
for Sunday Silence and kept the 3-year-old colt eligible for a Triple Crown 
sweep when the 121st Belmont Stakes is run here Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, who had already won the Kentucky Derby, took the Preakness by 
the bob of a nose over Easy Goer, in what was a classic example of the 
hell-for-leather style against the patient, more relaxed Eastern manner. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela's superb performance in the Preakness was not unlike some other 
memorable rides by West Coast jockeys in recent Triple Crown races. In the 1983 
Belmont, Pincay might have been the country's only rider who would have tried 
to squeeze Caveat through a small hole on the rail at the top of the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Caveat bounced off the rail not once but twice, but the move was instrumental 
in the colt's three-and-one-half-length victory. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1986 Kentucky Derby, it was Bill Shoemaker, with a Derring-Do hardly 
characteristic of his brilliant career, who sent Ferdinand through a 
rapidly-closing hole at the top of the stretch, and the rest was easy. Had 
Rampage been just slightly quicker and been able to reach the same hole, his 
jockey, Pat Day, said that they would have won the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
If Shoemaker stole a page from Pincay in winning the '86 Derby, Valenzuela did 
another pretty good imitation in this year's Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence may be a better horse than Easy Goer, anyway. He was 2 1/2 
lengths better in the mud at Churchill Downs, and though the issue was in doubt 
until the last stride of the Preakness, Sunday Silence nevertheless showed the 
kind of championship gameness that was the calling card of Affirmed when he 
edged out Alydar all three times in 1978 to become the last Triple Crown 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the abilities of the horses, the Preakness was still a jockeys' 
race, and horseplayers forever will be saying that the outcome turned on 
Valenzuela outriding Day, the more experienced Eastern jockey. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela made two moves to help him win; Day made three mistakes that might 
have cost him the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Day, who later suggested that he erred, prematurely moved Easy Goer to the 
front on the far turn. Valenzuela, along with just about everybody else 
watching the race, was surprised that Easy Goer would go when he did, but he 
didn't panic. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Easy Goer go by me so quick," Valenzuela said. "But I knew I had plenty 
of horse and just waited. He stopped us a little (by forcing Sunday Silence 
dangerously close to the heels of Houston, who had been on the lead), but I had 
plenty of horse and then I moved up outside of him (Easy Goer)." 
</P>
<P>
That was move No. 2 by Valenzuela, boxing Easy Goer into the rail, which is the 
worst place to be in a knock-down-drag-out stretch duel. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela told friends he had Easy Goer where he wanted him. 
</P>
<P>
Besides moving too soon, Day also allowed Valenzuela to outmaneuver him for the 
stretch drive. Before the Kentucky Derby, Charlie Whittingham, Sunday Silence's 
trainer, was caught defending his choice of Valenzuela as the colt's jockey. 
Several California jockeys with bigger names were available and Valenzuela had 
had an erratic spring in riding some of Whittingham's other stakes horses. 
</P>
<P>
But Wittingham kept saying Valenzuela was an excellent position rider. In the 
Preakness, that proved to be true. 
</P>
<P>
Day's last mistake was made in the final yards when he jerked Easy Goer's head 
in the direction of Sunday Silence. Before Day's explanation, it appeared that 
Easy Goer might have even been trying to bite Sunday Silence. 
</P>
<P>
Day said that he cocked Easy Goer's head at a 45-degree angle because he wanted 
his mount to see Sunday Silence just outside him. But this was wasted motion in 
a race that was decided by inches. Easy Goer and Sunday Silence were so close 
that they were brushing. Even without having his head cocked, Easy Goer would 
have had to be blind not to notice his rival. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, though, it still looked as if the Preakness might be a repeat of 
one of Day's most exceptional rides -- in the first Breeders' Cup Classic, at 
Hollywood Park in 1984. That afternoon, Day was trapped on the rail by two 
horses, one of them the undisciplined, Lugging-In Gate Dancer on the far 
outside. But Day persevered, and got Wild Again home in a three-way photo 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's Belmont could be another jockeys' race, with the pressure on Day. 
Sunday Silence figures to be ahead of Easy Goer in the early going, and Day 
can't let Valenzuela's colt get too far ahead. Day also must decide when to 
move on Sunday Silence, and hope that his decision isn't as ill-timed as it was 
at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
Both horses are bred to run 1 1/2 miles, so the jockeys, as they were in the 
Preakness, are likely to be the tell-tale ingredient. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't see any way Easy Goer can beat us in the Belmont," Valenzuela 
said. 
</P>
<P>
There is a way, of course, because Easy Goer is a good horse behind another 
good horse in a light year for 3-year-olds, and even a colt as talented as 
Sunday Silence is not invincible. But because of what has happened in this 
brief, two-race rivalry, the younger rider from the West is suddenly looming 
larger than the more heralded jockey from the East.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

BLUE JAY ROOKIE HAS A VERY ENJOYABLE WEEKEND IN BOSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You talk about a weekend. Rookie Junior Felix of the Toronto Blue Jays is not 
likely to forget his. And for an entirely different reason, the Boston Red Sox 
won't forget it, either. 
</P>
<P>
It all happened in Boston. The climax came Sunday when the Red Sox, who had 
lost 11 straight to the Blue Jays at Fenway Park, built a 10-0 lead after six 
innings, then blew it when Felix hit a two-run homer in the 12th inning. The 
final score was 13-11. 
</P>
<P>
Felix, yet another talented player from the Dominican Republic, was the hitting 
star of all three victories. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, Felix, 21, hit an inside-the-park grand slam in the ninth inning 
in a 7-2 victory. Saturday, he drove in four more runs with three hits. In the 
three games, Felix was eight for 16, drove in 11 runs and scored four. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Smithson had the Blue Jays beaten, 10-0, but developed a blister on his 
foot and had to leave in the seventh. The Blue Jays went to work on the Red Sox 
bullpen. They scored two in the seventh, four in the eighth and five in the 
ninth as Ernie Whitt hit a grand slam to put them in front, 11-10. Jody Reed 
singled home Nick Esasky in the bottom of the ninth to send it into extra 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe this is the only park you can come back from a 10-run deficit," Toronto 
Manager Cito Gaston said. "It was amazing." 
</P>
<P>
Felix didn't even know the name of the pitcher he tagged for the winning homer. 
It was Dennis Lamp. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 4, Cleveland 0 -- The Indians figured out a way to get Dave Stewart out 
of the game at Oakland, but it was too late to prevent him from becoming the 
American League's first 10-game winner. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart (10-2) was ahead, 4-0, and pitching a three-hitter when he hit 
Cleveland catcher Andy Allanson with a pitch with two out in the seventh. As 
Allanson went to first, the two exchanged words, but were restrained by 
umpires. 
</P>
<P>
When the inning ended, Allanson and Stewart met between second base and the 
pitching mound and began exchanging punches. Both benches emptied and Allanson 
and Stewart were ejected. 
</P>
<P>
With bullpen ace Dennis Eckersley on the disabled list, that could have been 
costly to the Athletics. But Todd Burns pitched a scoreless eighth and Rick 
Honeycutt a perfect ninth. 
</P>
<P>
In improving their record to 36-19 with a makeshift lineup caused mostly by 
injuries, the Athletics remained in a virtual tie with the Angels for first 
place in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Polonia singled in the first run in a three-run third inning and Dave 
Parker capped the uprising with a run-scoring double. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 7, Detroit 4 -- Randy Milligan, after missing three games because of 
a sore left hand, hit a three-run home run at Detroit and the Orioles swept the 
four-game series and extended their winning streak to seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Bradley hit a two-run homer for the Orioles, who are 30-22. After 52 games 
last season they were 11-41 and in last place, 23 1/2 games out of first. 
</P>
<P>
New York 12, Milwaukee 9 -- County Stadium in Milwaukee was another park where 
the ball was carrying well. 
</P>
<P>
Football star Deion Sanders hit his first major league home run, and Jesse 
Barfield, who had two, Mel Hall and Steve Balboni also homered as the Yankees 
built a 10-0 lead after four innings. Five Milwaukee errors made six of the 
runs unearned. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Red Sox, though, the Yankees didn't blow the lead -- not quite. 
</P>
<P>
Before runing out of time, the Brewers fought back to make the score 11-9. But 
Lee Guetterman, stopped a rally in the eighth and went on to pick up his eighth 
save. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 2, Texas 1 -- Randy Johnson, the Mariners' 6-10 left-hander, made a 
successful debut at the Kingdome. Ken Griffey Jr. hit a tie-breaking home run 
in the seventh to give Johnson a 2-0 record since being acquired from Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 2, Minnesota 1 -- After being sent to the bullpen a couple of weeks 
ago, Jerry Reuss was ineffective as a relief pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Jeff Torborg, hampered by a shortage of starters because of injuries, 
put Reuss back into the rotation -- at least for one game. Reuss responded by 
shutting out the Twins on three hits in six innings at Chicago and improved his 
record to 4-2. DAN HAFNER

IRVINE ELITE TRACK MEET; 
</P>
<P>
CUBANS IMPRESSIVE IN NEW EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Edwin Moses called a few friends from near and far and put on a track and field 
meet Sunday afternoon at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
And if this, his first such attempt, is any indication, Moses has a future in 
this promoting racket. A three-time Olympian and two-time gold medal winner in 
the 400-meter hurdler, Moses and Danny Williams, UC Irvine women's coach, 
staged the first Irvine Elite track and field meet Sunday before a crowd of 
500. 
</P>
<P>
Competitors included Roger Kingdom, Evelyn Ashford, Alisa Harvey, a foursome of 
Cuban athletes and a host of other world-class athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Kingdom, the two-time Olympic gold medalist in the 110-meter high hurdles, and 
Ashford, a three-time Olympian in the 100 meters, were making their outdoor 
debuts and preparing for The Athletics Congress national championships next 
week in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey tuned up for next week's meet by outkicking Rose Monday and Tara Arnold 
in the final 10 meters to win the women's 800 in 2 minutes 3.95 seconds in the 
most exciting race of the meet, and the only non-sprint event scheduled. Monday 
was second in 2:03.99 and Arnold was third in 2:04.21. 
</P>
<P>
But the most impressive performances were turned in by the Cubans, all of whom 
competed Saturday at the Prefontaine meet in Eugene, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Ana Quirot powered away from the field with 80 meters left to win the women's 
400 meters in 50.45, Roberto Hernandez took the men's 400 in 45.89. Luis Delis 
won the discus with a throw of 214 feet 8 inches and Juan Martinez was second 
with a toss of 213-10. 
</P>
<P>
Quirot, who was top-ranked in the 800 and won the 400 and 800 at the Pan Am 
Games in 1987, ran the fastest 400 in the world this year with her 50.14 
Saturday. She said she was tired from traveling Sunday morning but had little 
trouble pulling away from Jearl Miles and Marciel Malone, her closest pursuers. 
</P>
<P>
"The competition here was much better (than in Eugene)," Quirot said through an 
interpreter. "I could have run much faster today but the conditions were 
windy." 
</P>
<P>
Miles was a well-beaten second in 51.89 and Malone finished third in 52.09. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez outdueled former Hawthorne High School star Henry Thomas, competing 
unattached, in the final 50 meters. Thomas was second in 46.22. 
</P>
<P>
Delis and Martinez finished ahead of Ade Olukoju of Nigeria, who also competes 
for Azusa Pacific. Olukoju, who won the shotput and discus at the NAIA 
championships last week at Azusa, finished third with a throw of 210-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubans leave for Spain today to start their summer tour on the Grand Prix 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Kingdom and Ashford said they're not quite ready for the challenge of such 
high-profile meets. 
</P>
<P>
Kingdom's plans include a week of intensive training back home in Pittsburgh in 
preparation for the TAC meet. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't run as fast as I would have liked today, but that's what meets like 
this one do for you -- show you where you're at," Kingdom said. 
</P>
<P>
His time of 13.35 was a good first outing, particularly in light of what 
Kingdom hopes to accomplish this season. 
</P>
<P>
"There are three things I want to do," he said. "Win the national championships 
next week. Win the Grand Prix in the 110 highs. And the third thing I want to 
do is break the world record." 
</P>
<P>
Ashford, after watching Florence Griffith-Joyner step into the limelight at the 
Seoul Olympics then retire after the Games, said it's now time for her to prove 
herself all over again. 
</P>
<P>
She started in that direction by winning the 100 in 11.27, just ahead of former 
UCLA runner Diane Williams, who was second in 11.32, and Grace Jackson, an 
Olympian from Jamaica who was third in 11.36.

AGE DOESN'T CUT INTO JERRY BARBER'S GAME ON SUPER SENIORS TOUR

Jerry Barber says he is surprised that others are surprised that he's still 
winning tournaments at 73. 
</P>
<P>
"After all, I know how to play and I used to be a real good player," Barber 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He's still a good player, having already won two super seniors events this 
year. The super seniors are players 60 and older and they participate in the 
regular Senior PGA Tour events in what is a tournament within a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if the senior tour event is a 54-hole tournament, the super 
seniors' competition is based on 36 of those holes. 
</P>
<P>
With victories in the St. Christopher's and Southwestern Bell tournaments, 
Barber has earned $22,300. Charlie Sifford, with $23,100, is the only super 
senior to have earned more money this year. Barber has earned an additional 
$16,270 on the regular senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
A contemporary of such famous players as Ben Hogan, Sam Snead and Cary 
Middlecoff of another era, Barber is not slowing down but gearing up. 
</P>
<P>
He played in 32 senior events last season and only six seniors played more 
rounds. The adage that you're only as old as you feel would seem to apply to 
Barber. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always taken pretty good care of myself and get plenty of rest," Barber 
said. "I've also been driving the ball better lately and my iron shots into the 
green are a little better. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time I was a good putter but, as you get older, your nerves aren't 
as good as they used to be. However, in the last couple of weeks I've holed a 
few putts and there you are." 
</P>
<P>
Barber, the co-head pro at Griffith Park with his son, Tom, walks two or three 
miles a day when he's home, does knee bends and takes 200 to 300 swings with 
his practice driver. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very fortunate because my parents lived a long time," he said. "My dad 
passed away a year ago at the age of 96. My mother passed away three years ago 
at the age of 103. 
</P>
<P>
"I have eight brothers and sisters and four of them are in their 80s and four 
of them are in their 70s and they're all in reasonably good health." 
</P>
<P>
Barber, who won the PGA championship in 1961, joined the regular tour in 1948. 
He recalled that in 1954 he was the fourth-leading money winner with $18,500 in 
earnings. Last year, he earned $60,000 as a super senior. 
</P>
<P>
That's a nice living, but not comparable to what some players are earning on 
the regular tour. For example, Curtis Strange earned more than $1 million in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, there isn't a dominant player on the PGA Tour now. Strange has yet 
to win a tournament this year, and no player has won more than twice. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems is, perhaps, that players don't work on their games as 
much now," Barber said. "Snead practiced more than people thought he did. Hogan 
worked as hard at the game as anyone, if not more. 
</P>
<P>
"When Hogan won the U.S. Open in the early '50s, someone asked him if it was 
hard. Hogan said, 'That wasn't hard. It was the four hours of practice a day 
since last September that was tough.' 
</P>
<P>
"You can't find a guy today who practices four hours a day. The players are 
making so much money now without winning that they don't have to do what Hogan 
did." 
</P>
<P>
Barber also noted another aspect relevant to the inflated purses on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to give caddies $75 to $100," he said. "Now if you give them less than 
$300, or $400, they hand it back to you. But it's not a problem. The caddies 
have a lot of expenses traveling around." 
</P>
<P>
Golf magazines devote most of their space to instructional devices, and there 
are many books on the market on how to play the game. 
</P>
<P>
Barber says such information generally is misleading. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know any game that has poorer instruction than golf," he said. "It 
needs to be taught better and simpler. Golf is not that complicated. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a ball and a club and you're trying to hit the ball with the club and 
they (magazines and books) have devoted all their attention to the movements of 
the body and the movements are, more or less, a reflex action. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're always thinking of your left arm, shoulder, or hip, you have a 
problem. You should concentrate on holding onto the club without getting your 
feet too close together, or too close to the ball. Just use your hands, 
forearms and wrist and you ought to hit the ball pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Barber is still doing it at 73. That should be a lesson in itself. 
</P>
<P>
For those who pound balls on ranges at all hours of the day, all is not lost. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Trevino says that practice is more likely to produce a better golf game 
than playing a course. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're on the course and you hit a bad five-iron, you just hit it and 
forget it and go on to the next shot," Trevino said. "But if you're practicing 
and you hit a bad five-iron, you can work on that five-iron shot until you 
figure out what you're doing wrong and get it right." 
</P>
<P>
However, Trevino makes an exception with his driver. 
</P>
<P>
"I never hit the driver on the practice tee," he said. "It's too wide open. It 
doesn't mean anything. There's no trouble out there on the range, no trees, no 
out of bounds, no nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"I only hit the driver on the course. Get out there by yourself and hit a bunch 
of drives off every tee. That gives you an idea of what you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Calcavecchia and Ken Green have well-earned nicknames on the PGA pro tour. 
</P>
<P>
"We call them the Fearless Flies," said Robert Wrenn of the aggressive duo. 
"They're not afraid to stand up there on the tee and let it fly." 
</P>
<P>
For identification purposes Calcavecchia is Fly I and Green is Fly II.

Striking musicians closed the "Folies Bergere" extravaganza on the Las Vegas 
Strip Saturday night in a labor dispute with the Tropicana Hotel. The 
Ramada-owned 2,000-room resort employs 14 musicians in the main showroom where 
the curtain routinely goes up twice nightly, seven days a week. The dark 
showroom put about 170 waiters, waitresses, dancers, showgirls, stagehands and 
entertainers out of work. About 1,400 people had reservations for the two 
performances Saturday night. It was unclear whether the Tropicana would resume 
a showroom policy by hiring non-union musicians. The musicians union has been 
threatened in recent years by high technology, which has replaced large musical 
groups and orchestras with tape and synthesizers. The strike marked the first 
walkout on the Strip since the expiration on June 2 of a contract covering 
30,000 bartenders, culinary workers, stagehands and musicians at more than 30 
gambling resorts. John Chiero, president and general manager of the Tropicana 
Hotel, said all other hotel workers remained on the job, despite musician 
picket lines. He said closure of the showroom "will not economically impact the 
hotel because historically, showrooms in Las Vegas lose money." "The Folies 
Bergere," a French extravaganza, has played the Tropicana Hotel for more than a 
decade. ALEENE MacMINN and Claudia Puig

POP CAPSULES: RAMONES' PUNK BRILLIANCE THRIVES ON LACK OF GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can a performance be both perfunctory and truly great at the same time? This is 
the question that arises when the Ramones -- a national treasure, an American 
institution -- come to town each year to do another amazing-on-its-own-terms 
show that's largely indistinguishable from the previous year. That they rarely 
show signs of growth somehow doesn't diminish the historical brilliance of 
their conceit. 
</P>
<P>
The new album from punk's founding fathers, "Brain Drain," is one of the lesser 
efforts of a 13-year recording career. Naturally, it was all but ignored during 
the course of a typically relentless 75-minute show Friday at the Hollywood 
Palladium that mostly reprised old classics, starting with a medley of 
(speaking of American institutions) "Teenage Lobotomy" and "Psycho Therapy." 
The only recent song of any import: the suitably catchy and morbidly 
melancholic theme from the movie "Pet Sematary," the only memorable thing about 
that inexplicably beloved motion picture. 
</P>
<P>
As always, the band members looked like mimes girding themselves against a 
wind, as if they'd rush forward and leap off the stage if the sold-out beehive 
crowd's hot air didn't blow them back. Yet they're also as businesslike as ever 
-- aggressive and indifferent, they are. Ramonesmania is still as senselessly 
exhilarating as ever; at this late date, there remains no need to ask 
gabba-gabba-why. CHRIS WILLMAN

POP CAPSULES: PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS OVERPLAYS ITS STRENGTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pursuit of Happiness is no revolutionary rock band, but it is one worth 
rallying around for listeners who think that a catchy melody and a hammering 
beat is a pop fan's inalienable right. The strength of the Canadian band's show 
on Saturday at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano was its ability to send 
time and again a capsule of captivating melody into orbit on the shoulders of a 
booster-rocket instrumental surge. 
</P>
<P>
But by overplaying its strength, TPOH turned it into a flaw. Like space 
launches, those catchy pop blast-offs became a little routine with successful 
repetition, no matter how magnificent they might be individually. It would have 
helped if the band, which plays again Tuesday at Bogart's, had slowed the pace 
from time to time during the 80-minute set, instead of making nearly everything 
hurtle ahead at full thrust. 
</P>
<P>
If The Pursuit of Happiness can be criticized for following a formula, it's 
only fair to appreciate how much fun that formula is, with bright, 
Bangles-quality female backing vocals cushioning the propulsive attack and 
propping up Moe Berg's Everyman lead voice. Berg's songs about "Love Junk" -- 
the title of TPOH's debut album -- address matters of the heart and loins from 
shifting perspectives that ranged from crude to offbeat to winsomely innocent. 
The five new songs confirmed old strengths rather than pointing toward new 
directions. MIKE BOEHM

Perhaps to see if you can go home again, Bob Dylan will make a rare concert 
appearance in his home state of Minnesota, performing Aug. 3 at the RiverFest 
in St. Paul. Dylan, who was born in Duluth and raised in Hibbing, started as a 
folk singer in a coffeehouse near the University of Minnesota in 1959 but has 
performed locally only three times since -- at the Minneapolis Auditorium in 
1965, the St. Paul Civic Center in 1978 and the Metrodome in 1986. ALEENE

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: MEDIA / KEVIN BRASS; 
</P>
<P>
ADVERTISING, CONTENT CAN CLASH IN LOCAL NEWS SPECIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS

<TEXT>
<P>
When KNSD-TV (Channel 39) was developing its recent "Third Thursday" segment on 
the proposed San Diego Gas &amp; Electric merger with Southern California 
Edison, someone in the sales department thought it might be a good idea to 
approach SDG&amp;E about sponsoring the program. 
</P>
<P>
It was slowly explained to the salesman that such a deal might appear to be, 
well . . . a little bit of a conflict of interest. I see, the salesman said. 
The idea was quickly dropped. 
</P>
<P>
In the growing business of locally produced news specials, such moral 
quandaries involving the editorial and sales staffs are not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
The promotional spots for this month's edition of "Third Thursday," due to air 
June 15, announce that the show is sponsored by the San Diego County Teachers 
Credit Union. The topic of the show is education. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no direct conflict -- certainly the advertiser won't affect 
the content of the show, nor is it directly related to the topic -- the 
appearance is enough to bother some staffers. 
</P>
<P>
"People on the editorial side don't like the concept one bit," one station 
employee said. 
</P>
<P>
Some newsroom employees don't like anything that blurs the separation between 
the advertising and editorial departments. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more concerned about the editorials" aired at the end of each "Third 
Thursday," another staffer said. "Ninety percent of the viewers don't know one 
department does one thing and another department does another." 
</P>
<P>
Channel 39 employees have been assured that the situation with the teachers 
credit union is a one-shot deal, a problem that won't be repeated. However, the 
topic of interaction between the sales and editorial departments at Channel 39 
was raised a few months ago by the direct sponsorship of segments during the 
news programs, such as "Project Lifeplanning." 
</P>
<P>
It is not a topic unique to Channel 39. For KGTV's (Channel 10) upcoming 
"Signature Series" special on San Diego's trauma care system, "Trauma!" 
scheduled to air Thursday, the Channel 10 sales department raised the idea of 
approaching a local ambulance company about sponsoring the show. The idea was 
quickly squashed when it was learned that the ambulance company was part of the 
special. 
</P>
<P>
The question of appropriate advertising is being raised more often simply 
because stations are doing more of these types of shows, as local affiliates 
continue to stake out their territory independent of the networks. Instead of 
being simply afterthoughts, or a way to do a little community service, public 
information programming is becoming an integral part of affiliates' program 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
Shows like "Third Thursday," which produced a decent 5.0 rating in the last 
ratings period, and the "Signature Series" are not exactly gold mines for the 
stations, but they are revenue producers. When the network supplies a show to 
an affiliate, the two split the number of advertising spots. But for locally 
produced shows, the affiliate can keep the revenue from all the spots. 
</P>
<P>
There is a "growing interest" in advertising on "Signature Series" shows, said 
Darrell Brown, Channel 10's general sales manager. "They target upscale people, 
people concerned about their community." 
</P>
<P>
The ability to offer advertisers direct sponsorship of the program, so-called 
"billboards" that tell viewers the show is "sponsored by . . ." make the shows 
particularly attractive to some advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts a bow on the package for them," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people get me mixed up with Samantha Fox, porno movie queen," bimbo 
rocker Samantha Fox said in an article in the 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Union. Sure enough, in the May 25 issue of the Reader, critic Stephen 
Esmedina wrote of Fox, "It is her sordid past as a porn starlet that inspires 
crude, lascivious remarks. . . . Having seen a number of Samantha Fox classics, 
I can only say that her dimensions have blossomed since some porn rag voted her 
'the most skillful porno actress in films.' . . . Porno films are her turf. 
It's where she belongs." Fox may have bared her breasts as one of England's 
leading "Page 3 girls," but she wasn't the porno star Esmedina ogled. . . .

XTRA-AM's Mark Williams is scheduled to go to Boston this week to participate 
in a convention of talk show hosts, but he no longer has a show. Looking to 
boost its anemic morning ratings, XTRA (690) has dropped Williams, who has been 
valiantly trying to boost his exposure lately by attacking his competition at 
KSDO-AM (1130). XTRA is a classy operation, said Williams, who will remain with 
XTRA, albeit off the air, through July 1. "They handled it the right way. They 
made a decision and they had to do what is right for XTRA." Larry Roberts takes 
over the morning show on a temporary basis, beginning this morning. XTRA is 
expected to announce the hiring of former Padre Steve Garvey later this week. 
Management won't say yet what Garvey will do.

With "Star Trek XXI," "Karate Kid, Part IX: The Kid Buys a Gun" and "Fright 
Night IX: The Bob Uecker Story" set to be the foundation of the summer movie 
season, Landmark Theaters, operators of the Ken, Cove, Guild and Park, have 
adopted a new theme for the summer: "Just say no to sequels." It has purposely 
left all sequels off the summer rosters for its theaters. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Responding to letters from readers, this month's issue of San Diego magazine 
includes an apology for running an ad for a water company with the slogan, "A 
few good reasons to get your jugs removed." A note from the publisher reads, 
"The advertisement came in after our deadline, ready to run, and was published 
without review. We didn't see it until the March issue came out." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Noble Broadcasting President John Lynch wasn't happy that his station, XTRA-AM, 
didn't get the contract to broadcast Padres games. But he could take 
satisfaction in knowing KKLQ (Q106) didn't get the contract, either. (Incumbent 
KFMB retained the rights.) "I didn't want to see Q106 get it," Lynch said. "If 
Q106 got it, they would have been another competitive factor on the AM. I 
wanted to beat them out more than anything else." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Escondido-based KOW is now simulcasting mainstream country music on both AM and 
FM, dropping the traditional country music on the AM station. As part of the 
economizing move, the station laid off announcer Clip Helps, who had been with 
the station for more than 20 years. Helps, who has been doing weekend and 
fill-in work with KJQY-FM (103.7) since December, said he had made it clear to 
KOW management that he was looking for a change anyway. The station also has a 
new general manager, consultant David Moore, who replaces Al Gordon. . . .

Artie Ojeda has turned down a gig with KABC-TV's (Channel 7) Orange County 
bureau to be the No. 2 sports guy at KFMB-TV (Channel 8). He moved into the 
spot vacated by Jim Laslavic, who is moving to Channel 39. Laslavic's last day 
with Channel 8 was Saturday. . . . Lee (Hacksaw) Hamilton's show with Channel 
39 is set to begin June 17. The live phone-in show will follow NBC baseball 
games on Saturday afternoons. . . . Channel 39 had a problem with the 
prime-time show on entrepreneurs scheduled to air June 21. After looking at the 
first edits of the interviews with the entrepreneurs, it was, well . . . 
boring. So the script was changed to include more dramatic tales, such as 
stories about those who have been unsuccessful in their attempts to develop 
businesses.

HULK STEPS INTO RING IN 'HOLDS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pro wrestling phenomenon Hulk Hogan is the main attraction of the garish, 
sub-"Rocky" action-satire, "No Holds Barred" (citywide), and he has a peculiar 
Jekyll-Hyde persona during the movie. Outside the ring, he's quiet, gentlemanly 
and deferential. While wrestling, his face becomes distorted and maniacal: eyes 
bulging, neck muscles taut, mouth stretched into a silent but leonine scream. 
</P>
<P>
It's the beast unleashed, the hulk unbuckled. The movie itself is about the war 
of nerves between a gentle but heroic wrestler and a raving madman who runs a 
national TV network. And, if you've labored under the delusion all these years 
that there was something phony about TV wrestling, "No Holds Barred" will set 
you straight. In the film's world, every ludicrous chokehold, every laughable 
belly-flop, every preposterous rope-slam is totally legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it's TV that's phony. Here, it's run by greedy, dangerous lunatics and 
sniveling toadies who, in the pursuit of higher ratings, will stop at nothing: 
including prostitution, murder or screaming and hollering until their faces 
turn blue. 
</P>
<P>
Hogan plays Rip, good-natured wrestling superstar and benign blond behemoth; 
the movie's ingenuity has not extended to finding him a last name (Rip Rogan? 
Rip Roxoff?). Kurt Fuller plays his demented nemesis: the unspeakable network 
executive Tom Brell. 
</P>
<P>
Brell first tries to woo soft-spoken Rip to his lineup with the gentle approach 
(for him): waving money in his face, shoving and pummeling him. When these 
restrained tactics fail, Brell turns to kidnaping, extortion, assault and 
attempted murder. He enlists the services of a homicidal maniac named Zeus 
(Tiny Lister) who challenges the champ to a match with no rules. Zeus also 
beats Rip's brother to a bloody pulp. (Lest critics accuse the movie of veiled 
racism -- Zeus is black -- other blacks are always included, hiding behind Rip 
or cheering him on at fights, whenever Zeus appears.)

Obviously Brell is not rational. There must be easier ways to win good ratings 
than this. But Rip and his friends are irrational too; they never call the 
police to complain that a maniac is threatening them and committing violent 
crimes. Instead, Rip fights it out as he always has: alone, indomitable, in the 
ring, mano-a-mano. Will he win? Will he smash, bash and thrash the obstreperous 
Zeus? Will he rescue the lissome Samantha (Joan Severance)? Will his little 
brother walk again? Will the vile Brell get his comeuppance? Will the sun rise 
tomorrow?

"No Holds Barred" gets no points for originality. It's written with the 
subtlety of a body-slam and directed with the finesse of a hammerlock. But the 
movie never takes itself seriously and director Tom Wright (TV's "Beauty and 
the Beast") has fun with the wrestling montages. Hogan himself has an appealing 
screen presence -- like a gallant teddy bear who goes berserk every 10 minutes 
or so. Kurt Fuller, last seen gibbering insanely in "Miracle Mile," comes up 
with the kind of congenitally sneering, wild-man bully who might have harassed 
Abbott and Costello. 
</P>
<P>
And if you still think TV wrestling is mostly phony, consider this: "No Holds 
Barred" was produced by Shane Productions, which is, according to the press 
book, run by the "executive brain trust" behind the World Wrestling Foundation 
of which Hulk Hogan is currently world champion. What group would know better 
whether pro wrestling is just a big show?

MARGALIT PERFORMS AT SANTA MONICA COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elfin and mischievous, Margalit scampers about in a delicate and private way 
and tells simple little tales amplified by her expressive face and powerful 
voice. At Santa Monica College on Friday night, her solo program ranged from a 
delicious yarn about her youth in Aden, the former British protectorate, to a 
collection of rather fey little pieces about motherhood, children and world 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
Outfitted in a bright yellow gown and a fanciful headdress concocted by Leslie 
Yarmo, she evoked a land of "hot wind, hot sun" and a loving, vivacious family 
in "Through the Gates of Aden." Sketching in the details with rhythmic, 
repetitious bursts of simple words -- in the fashion of a story for small 
children -- she would stop to wail with the harsh, sustained tones of a muezzin 
calling the faithful. Her birdlike intensity and quicksilver shifts in tone and 
posture made the piece truly magical. 
</P>
<P>
In "I Wish" and "Mom, Goliath is Dead" -- groups of short, simple poems 
delivered with passages of drumming, piping, eccentric, springy little walks 
and animal sounds -- Margalit became a feisty little child. ("I wish my mom 
were president of the world!") A trifle cloying, these pieces were nonetheless 
peppered with wit and invention, qualities in short supply in "I Am a Mother; I 
Am a Wonderful Mother." 
</P>
<P>
The final piece, "Yemenite Wedding," looked -- with its elaborate costumes and 
tapestry set (by David Sharir) as though it would unfold at a leisurely pace. 
Alas, it was over before the five characters had quite taken root in the mind's 
eye.CATHY CURTIS

Sunspot activity is rapidly increasing and could reach record levels within 
months, possibly threatening radio transmissions, satellites and electrical 
systems, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported. The 
current sunspot cycle began in 1986 and is expected to peak by the end of this 
year or the beginning of 1990, according to Joseph Hirman of NOAA's Space 
Environment Service Center in Boulder, Colo. Increasing solar activity and 
subsequent bursts of radiation have already had serious effects. In March, a 
solar flare precipitated a power blackout in Canada, interfered with some 
satellites and provoked an intense display of the northern lights.

South African writer and editor Richard Rive, whose works depicted the plight 
of Colored (mixed race) people under apartheid, was found murdered in his house 
near Cape Town. Police said that friends of Rive, 59, discovered him lying in a 
passageway. He was covered in blood and had been stabbed several times in the 
chest and beaten in the face. A play based on Rive's short novel "Buckingham 
Palace, District Six" is due to open in Cape Town on June 16. It describes life 
in Rive's birthplace, a vibrant district of the city that was forcibly cleared 
of its Colored population to make room for whites and now stands devastated.

Syrian and Christian gunners unleashed artillery barrages across Beirut, 
killing two civilians and wounding 19 others, police said. Police said the 
deaths in the latest round of Lebanon's civil war occurred in Christian East 
Beirut when Syrian gunners pounded that side of the divided capital. Fourteen 
people were wounded in the Christian sector, police said. Five others were 
wounded when shells struck Muslim West Beirut. The casualties were the first 
since May 11, when the Arab League called a cease-fire to halt nine weeks of 
fierce artillery duels. Officials said the renewed violence dimmed prospects 
for this week's meeting in Morocco of a three-member Arab League committee 
seeking to find a permanent solution to the war.

Wildlife officials in Alaska are confronting new problems related to the Exxon 
Valdez oil spill in March. Recently, it has been discovered that some bald 
eagles have abandoned their nests, sometimes with oil-blotched eggs containing 
dead embryos, said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials. Theories on why 
the birds are deserting their nests include the possibility that eagles 
scavenging on fouled shorelines may be getting their feathers soiled and 
spreading oil to their eggs, where it penetrates porous shells and kills unborn 
chicks. Or eagles may be frightened by cleanup crews working near their nests, 
experts said. Meanwhile, mother seals and pups are being coated with oil at 
rookeries. Even so, the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Coast Guard 
warned against capturing seal pups because they are better off with their 
mothers in the wild.

NEW SOVIET ETHNIC RIOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two days of ethnic rioting in Uzbekistan left an undisclosed number of dead, 
and Soviet authorities have imposed a curfew in portions of the southern 
republic, the official Tass news agency reported. "Extremist elements provoked 
unrest," Tass said. It said police and Interior Ministry troops were used to 
quell the rioting in the republic, which borders Afghanistan. Tass did not say 
what caused the flare-up. The conflict was among mostly Muslim Uzbeks and 
ethnic Turk-Meskhetis, Tass said. The Meskhetis are a small minority originally 
from southern Georgia. Conquered by Turks in the 16th Century, they were 
absorbed into Russia in the 19th Century.

STATES SPEND MORE ON AIDS EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AIDS education and state dollars to pay for it are on the rise, with all but 
nine states now requiring or recommending what should be taught about the 
disease and when, according to a new survey. The survey of education 
departments found that 41 states have a curriculum or curriculum guide for use 
in teaching students about AIDS -- 13 more than last year. The number of states 
appropriating their own money for AIDS instruction has more than tripled, from 
8 to 27, since last year. The findings are based on a December, 1988, survey of 
AIDS education coordinators in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, 
American Samoa, Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands by the Council of Chief State 
School Officers.

A moderate earthquake rumbled through the Mojave Desert, shaking houses and 
rattling windows but apparently causing no damage, authorities said. The 2:34 
p.m. quake was measured at a magnitude of 4.5 and the epicenter was pinpointed 
23 miles south of Barstow in the Lucerne Valley area, said Robert Finn of 
Caltech. "I felt it here in Pasadena," said Finn, whose office is more than 70 
miles from the epicenter. The temblor was also felt in Victorville, Big Bear 
City and Lake Arrowhead.

CANCER SOURCE NOT FOUND

Another study has failed to turn up any single connection among a dozen cancers 
of various types that struck children in McFarland early in this decade. 
Between Feb. 6 and April 28, a medical team from the state Department of Health 
examined 1,885 McFarland children, which represented 95% of all the children 
ages 1 to 12 who live in the Kern County community and surrounding farming 
area. As was the case with earlier studies, this one pinpointed no single 
environmental or other cause for the childhood cancers, said Dr. Rick Kreutzer, 
a state public health officer. "Using the technology now available, it would 
appear at this point that we cannot find anything in the McFarland environment 
that makes it unusual or more dangerous to the residents," Kreutzer said.

SCIENCE STRUGGLES TO EASE THE NIGHTMARE

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By KATHLEEN DOHENY, Doheny is a free-lance writer in Burbank who frequently 
writes about health issues for View. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The woman loved mirrors and had placed them lavishly around her apartment, 
where she lived alone. 
</P>
<P>
Normally an easygoing, sociable type, she seemed agitated one day and finally 
confessed to her visiting sister that her house mates made her angry. They 
never returned her friendly greetings. 
</P>
<P>
Later, her doctor listened sympathetically and explained to the woman's family 
that such delusional beliefs -- springing from an inability to recognize people 
-- are common in patients with Alzheimer's disease, a degenerative brain 
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Alzheimer's disease afflicts 2.5 million to 4 million Americans and is a type 
of senile dementia, a broad disease category that also includes other types of 
organic brain disorders. 
</P>
<P>
Although he usually cautions against reinforcing delusions, her physician, Dr. 
Stephen L. Read, medical director of the John Douglas French Center, a facility 
for Alzheimer's patients in Los Alamitos, suggested draping the mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm almost embarrassed to admit I did this," he said recently. "But she got 
better. She believed the people were still there, but she felt a lot better 
because they weren't looking at her all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Read's anecdote, relayed at a recent medical conference, reflects the challenge 
facing Alzheimer's disease researchers and physicians. For them, focusing on 
science alone -- searching for the cause, diagnostic methods and treatments -- 
isn't enough. They must also create common-sense solutions to help ease the 
often nightmarish lives of patients and those who care for them. And they must 
alert care givers about behavior changes, a phenomenon not yet completely 
understood. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, the ranks of Alzheimer's disease researchers has swelled 
from a handful to more than 500 nationwide, estimated Zaven Khachaturian of the 
National Institute on Aging at a recent conference sponsored by the John 
Douglas French Foundation for Alzheimer's Disease, Los Angeles. Research 
funding has increased from $90 million last fiscal year to $130 million in 
1989, according to Claire McCullough, an NIA spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that explosion of interest and infusion of funds, scientists are still 
not certain about what causes the disorder, first described in 1906. At 
autopsy, the brains of Alzheimer's patients show two abnormalities: plaques, 
clusters of degenerating nerve cell ends, and tangles, masses of twisted 
filaments that accumulate in previously healthy nerve cells. And there is as 
yet no definitive treatment for the disorder, marked by memory loss and 
personality changes, communication difficulties and time disorientation. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a number of research avenues may ultimately help unlock the puzzle. 
While some researchers focus on the origin of the disease, others are 
investigating better diagnostic methods. And others are zeroing in on 
psychosocial aspects. Research presented at the recent conference, along with 
investigations at the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at USC, one of 10 NIA 
research centers nationwide, have shed light on a number of areas. 
</P>
<P>
The long-term debate over the cause of Alzheimer's disease continues, with 
scientists suggesting genetic, viral and environmental origins, or a 
combination. Activation of some genetic factor is probably responsible, Dr. 
Leslie P. Weiner, USC chair of neurology and professor of microbiology, told 
conference participants. "There's no hard evidence for the viral theory," 
Weiner claims. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer researchers today espouse the viral theory than in the past, Read 
believes. The idea that a viral infection causes brain cell death "remains a 
theoretical possibility, but there is very little experimental evidence," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some researchers now believe that there are different forms of the 
disease. In a study of 100 Alzheimer's patients, David Freed, psychologist on 
staff at the USC Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, identified three 
subgroups. One subgroup has a loss of nerve cells containing acetylcholine (a 
type of "messenger" brain chemical called a neurotransmitter) in the basal 
forebrain. Another group has loss of nerve cells with norepinephrine, another 
neurotransmitter, in the brain stem, and may also lack acetylcholine. In 
another subgroup, Freed found movement changes, including tremor and rigidity, 
and he speculates there may be a loss of nerve cells containing dopamine. This 
form of the disease is thought to result from long-term exposure to workplace 
toxins such as metals and solvents, Freed said. 
</P>
<P>
Another USC researcher, Dr. Helena Chui, associate professor of neurology, is 
studying how the plaques form and has developed two hypotheses. Something may 
go awry in the nerve cells themselves, or the plaque may originate from the 
blood vessels. "The capillaries in Alzheimer's disease patients are very 
irregular," she said. In her studies of autopsied brains, she has found some 
capillary parts in the plaque. 
</P>
<P>
Another researcher, Dr. Carol Miller, USC associate professor of pathology and 
chief of neuropathology, is using molecular probes to determine exactly which 
nerve cells are affected in the disease and to track the pattern of 
progression. Among other questions she's investigating: Does the disease have 
identical progression from one patient to another? And how do healthy nerve 
cells differ on a molecular level from affected ones? 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other researchers are trying to find better diagnostic methods. 
Definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is only possible, experts say, by 
biopsy, a procedure rarely done for the disease, or by autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
But several less invasive techniques are yielding diagnostic clues as well. An 
imaging technique called SPECT (single photon emission computerized tomography) 
is "the best noninvasive procedure we have for making the diagnosis of 
Alzheimer's disease," claims Dr. Ismael Mena, director of the division of 
nuclear medicine at Harbor/UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, and a UCLA professor 
of radiological sciences. When memory loss is the presenting symptom, Mena 
said, SPECT can help determine whether it's due to stroke, depression or 
Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
In the procedure, a radioactive isotope is injected into a vein and an hour 
later an image is taken of the brain. From the computerized brain picture, the 
clinician can study the perfusion of blood into the the brain's temporal and 
parietal lobes. Reduced blood flow into both temporal and both parietal lobes 
is "a fingerprint of Alzheimer's disease," Mena said, but not of depression or 
stroke. Since early 1988, Mena has used SPECT on more than 100 Alzheimer's 
patients and predicts its use will increase dramatically, partly due to the 
recent availability of new and better imaging agents. 
</P>
<P>
Also under study as a diagnostic method is the computerized 
electroencephalogram, a tracing of the brain's electrical activity. 
</P>
<P>
In healthy people, brain waves in the alpha range predominate and wave 
frequencies don't change much with age, explained Dr. Cyrus K. Mody, clinical 
instructor of neurology, and Dr. Hugh McIntrye, professor of neurology, both at 
Harbor/UCLA Medical Center. But in Alzheimer's patients, alpha waves decrease 
and are replaced with slower delta or theta waves. The computerized EEG 
technique correctly diagnosed all but one of 50 patients in a recent study at 
Harbor/UCLA, according to researchers there. The method can also evaluate 
severity, say the scientists, with greater changes suggesting more advanced 
disease. Currently, several teaching hospitals and about four Los Angeles area 
hospitals perform the computerized EEGs for Alzheimer's detection. 
</P>
<P>
Other researchers are piecing together typical behavior patterns and 
psychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer's patients. Delusional beliefs such as those 
affecting the interior decorator are common, Read finds. "Families often 
consider the beliefs trivial in talking to doctors," he said. Patients often 
believe someone has stolen everyday objects like wallets or purses and accuse 
the vague "they." Some patients who no longer recognize a spouse "accuse the 
care givers of not being there when in fact they are present 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes a delusion is really an unconscious response to an environment that 
has become very much too complicated for a patient," he said. In general, Read 
advises family and friends not to reinforce delusional beliefs, but 
acknowledges that in the case of the interior decorator, he successfully broke 
his own rule. 
</P>
<P>
Behavior changes vary greatly, he finds. Besides having delusions, patients 
might become more out of touch, more listless and dependent, act more 
childishly or become cruel or mean-spirited. Not all Alzheimer's disease 
patients become more agitated as the disease progresses, Read said, although 
that stereotype flourishes. Some become more passive; some display more 
self-centered behavior. Agitation is more common in patients who have had the 
disease longer, Read said. 
</P>
<P>
Another common behavior, wandering, can provoke anxiety and exhaustion in 
family members and nursing home staff, especially when patients escape from 
home or facility. But wandering is believed to be a coping mechanism, a way to 
adjust to altered perceptions of the environment, and perhaps a response to 
loneliness, said Lynne Morishita, director of the Center for Geriatric Health 
at Century City Hospital and UCLA assistant clinical professor of nursing who 
also spoke at the conference. Most likely to wander, she finds, are patients 
who tended to pace or fidget in their younger days. 
</P>
<P>
As Alzheimer's disease becomes more well-known by the public, physicians face 
another dilemma. Aware of the disease, older Americans begin to worry about 
becoming a victim. 
</P>
<P>
"A lady came to see me recently because she ran a red light," Read said. "We 
spend a fair amount of time undiagnosing Alzheimer's disease these days." And 
according to the experts, the patient who says to his doctor, "I think I have 
Alzheimer's disease," almost never does. 
</P>

harbor / UCLA Medical Center a less invasive way to look for Alzheimer's 
disease. In a normal brain, the blood flow is evenly distributed throughout

in the rear portion particularly the parietal lobes.

What has been called "a powerful new means for introducing foreign DNA into 
animals" has been developed by Italian researchers at the Institute of 
Biomedical Technology in Rome. The new technique should make it much simpler 
and less expensive to produce transgenic animals (animals carrying a foreign 
gene), which are useful in medical research and have great potential value for 
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Molecular biologist C. Spadafora and his colleagues reported last week in the 
journal Cell that they simply incubated mouse sperm cells in a solution 
containing the genes they desired to add to the animals. When mouse eggs were 
fertilized with this sperm, 30% of the mice obtained had the new genetic trait. 
The process had previously been carried out, with less success, by laboriously 
inoculating fertilized eggs with the foreign DNA. 
</P>
<P>
In an editorial commentary, geneticist Max Birnstiel of the Research Institute 
of Molecular pathology in Vienna, wrote that, "if confirmed by others, this 
publication will be a cornerstone in biology, not only because the technique 
promises to do away with the laborious and technically demanding needle work . 
. . but also because of its potential usefulness for introducing commercially 
important features into animal species that have so far proved difficult to 
deal with."

Transplant doctors predict that pigs will become a main source of donor organs 
for people once the many technical problems of cross-species transplantation 
are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
While primates such as chimpanzees and baboons might be a better match, pigs 
are cheaper, more plentiful and easier to breed, says Dr. Hugh Auchincloss Jr., 
assistant professor of surgery at Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
"What could change, I suppose, is that we could become better at making 
artificial organs than we are now. Then we wouldn't need the animal organs. But 
I don't see that as coming first," Auchincloss said last week at the annual 
meeting of the American Society of Transplant Physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Only 50 to 60 chimpanzees are available in any given year for all types of 
research, Auchincloss said. "It doesn't make any sense to use chimpanzees 
because you're going to make such a small impact in the well-being of humans. 
And you'll make people so mad, because it is where they focus from the point of 
view of animal rights, understandably so," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can eat the pig, I'm not sure you can't transplant the liver," said 
Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University 
of Minnesota.

AIDS STUDY USES POLIO VIRUS

<P>
Researchers last week reported the development of a possible AIDS vaccine that 
hooks up a key part of the deadly AIDS virus with a safe polio virus widely 
used in immunization programs. The potential vaccine was able to disarm a wide 
range of AIDS viral strains in studies of laboratory rabbits, but it has not 
yet been tested in humans, the scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
Reporting in the journal Nature, British researchers said they used genetic 
engineering techniques to tailor a model vaccine consisting of the Sabin polio 
virus and a protein from the outer membrane of the human immunodeficiency 
virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
A team headed by Jeffrey Almond of England's Reading University said its 
custom-made molecule not only neutralized a wide variety of HIV strains in 
rabbits, but also reduced the virus's ability to fuse cells into giant 
non-functional masses. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers speculated that their model employing polio virus may offer 
"considerable advantages" over other AIDS vaccine models because it might 
trigger production of antibodies in mucous fluids.

U.N. AGENCY EXPECTS JUMP IN AIDS CASES 
</P>

More than nine times as many adults are expected to come down with AIDS in the 
1990s as have already become ill in the history of the epidemic, according to 
startling figures presented Sunday by the World Health Organization on the 
opening day of the largest-ever international conference on AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, three times as many people are expected to become infected with 
the AIDS virus in the 1990s as have become infected in the 1980s, the decade in 
which cases were first identified. Five million people worldwide already carry 
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, the health 
organization estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"The HIV/AIDS situation in the decade of the 1990s will be more serious, and 
perhaps much more serious, than that which we have experienced in the 1980s," 
said Dr. Jonathan Mann, director of the organization's AIDS program. Mann cited 
the results of a recent World Health Organization analysis of the direction of 
the epidemic over the next 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
The organization's researchers, in making their predictions, relied on reports 
on statistics it received from 155 governments as well as individual 
researchers worldwide. It is the most comprehensive effort yet to predict the 
course of the epidemic to the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bilingual Demonstration 
</P>
<P>
Mann made his comments during an opening session that was delayed one hour by a 
raucous demonstration by several hundred people with AIDS and AIDS-related 
conditions. The protesters, shouting, stomping and waving banners and signs, 
paraded to the podium of the conference hall and presented, in French and 
English, a "Montreal manifesto." 
</P>
<P>
The 10-point declaration called, among other things, for an international code 
protecting the rights of infected people to medical care, jobs and civil 
liberties. It also demanded faster access to promising treatments, an end to 
the use of inactive placebos for purposes of comparison in experimental drug 
trials and the elimination of misconceptions about how the disease has spread. 
</P>
<P>
The protest had been approved in advance by the conference organizers, who say 
they have gone to great lengths to include people with AIDS in the meeting, 
giving them for the first time a significant role in designing the curriculum 
and shaping its emphasis on the social, ethical, economic and legal issues 
raised by AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disease Spreading 
</P>
<P>
In his address to many of the estimated 11,000 scientists and others expected 
to attend the weeklong Fifth International Conference on AIDS, Mann attributed 
the predicted rise in cases to several factors. These include the fact that HIV 
infection is now spreading beyond countries and regions already infected to 
areas of the world previously spared. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the infection rate among intravenous drug users in Bangkok, 
Thailand, has leaped from 1% in 1987 to more than 40%, Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
The virus also appears to be spreading rapidly among female prostitutes in 
southeastern India, and among the general adult population throughout the 
larger cities of West Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Yet zeal for fighting the disease may be waning, Mann warned. 
</P>
<P>
"Around the world, there is evidence of growing complacency among some -- and 
growing fatalism among others," he said. Mann predicted that complacency could 
reduce the commitment of resources to fight AIDS, while fatalism could lead to 
"proposals for simplistic and extreme solutions." 
</P>
<P>
As of June 1, about 157,191 AIDS cases, from 149 countries, had been reported 
to Mann's Geneva-based organization. But the organization estimates the actual 
number at more than three times that figure, or nearly 500,000 cases, because 
of poor reporting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Largest Share From U.S. 
</P>
<P>
The largest share of the reported cases has come from the United States, where 
more than 90,000 people have been reported to have the disease. African 
countries have reported nearly 25,000 cases, and European countries nearly 
22,000. 
</P>
<P>
Mann predicted that a total of more than 6 million adult cases will have 
occurred by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Mann also said the number of new AIDS cases are rising sharply -- from 70,000 
between 1980 and 1985 to 300,000 between 1986 and 1988 to a projected 700,000 
new cases between 1989 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Conference delegates from 87 countries poured into Montreal this weekend, 
jamming airport terminals, currency exchange offices and hotels. Nearly 1,000 
scientific papers are to be presented, in addition to 3,546 summaries of 
research to be displayed in a forest of printed posters. 
</P>
<P>
While the presentations will include more biomedical research than was 
presented at any of the four previous annual international AIDS meetings, 
organizers of the Montreal conference say there is for the first time a special 
emphasis on "the social challenge" posed by the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Alastair Clayton, director of Canada's Federal Center for AIDS, said the 
Canadian government had worked with Canadian and U.S. border officials to 
assure that people with AIDS or infected with the virus would not be prevented 
from entering the country to attend the conference. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Organization Policy 
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization, a co-sponsor of the conference, has developed a 
policy under which it will neither co-sponsor nor contribute to any AIDS 
meeting that does not include patient participation. The agency has no similar 
policy for any other disease. 
</P>
<P>
"While many tragedies and struggles leave no visible trace once they are 
passed, no imprint on the world's spirit, we know that AIDS in the 1980s has 
altered us -- in our world, in our countries, in our communities, and in our 
hearts," Mann concluded in his address.

MIAMI BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sunday they came back, some of the few who survived, old folks now, staring 
through the tincture of memory, passengers on the "Voyage of the Damned." 
</P>
<P>
"Fifty years ago, it wasn't such a celebration like this, let me tell you," 
said Herb Karliner, squinting at the shoreline. "Fifty years ago, we were 
turned away." 
</P>
<P>
On this very day, half a century ago, they were passengers aboard the St. 
Louis, a ship with 937 Jews fleeing the persecution of Adolf Hitler's Germany 
and circling desperately off the coast of Miami Beach. 
</P>
<P>
They had hoped to find asylum. Instead, a U.S. Coast Guard patrol boat chased 
them farther out to sea. Eventually, the ship returned to Europe and most 
aboard perished in the Nazi death mills. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday the Coast Guard showed up again, this time to provide escort. In the 
morning sun, the survivors boarded a yacht. Then they sailed out to the spot 
where they had once been sent away. "God bless America now; before, maybe not," 
said Eric Spitz, 64. 
</P>
<P>
Those were typical sentiments during the commemoration. The survivors tossed 
red and white carnations into a choppy sea. They chanted the mourner's prayer 
and sang the anthems of Israel and America. They counted up their blessings and 
griefs and wondered aloud. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Holman, 80 and a little wobbly these days, said: "I look in the mirror and 
I ask: Is it true? How can I still be here when so many others are dead? And 
may they all rest in peace." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
28 Attend Reunion 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Herb Karliner, a retired Miami Beach pastry chef, has located 
70 survivors of the sorrowful voyage. They are scattered across two continents. 
Twenty-eight came here this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Most often, they did not recognize each other, though sometimes there was a 
tiny glint of recollection across the years. Then they would ask: So what 
happened to you? And how did you come to escape? 
</P>
<P>
Aboard the rental yacht Florida Princess, renamed this one Sunday the St. 
Louis, they mostly sipped juice and tried to keep cool. The vessel was jammed 
with reporters and well-wishers. Seasickness added to the solemnity. 
</P>
<P>
A Miami Beach city commissioner had arranged for a barge to pull alongside. It 
held the remnant hull of the Ostwind, a pleasure boat that had belonged to 
Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose was to dump the donated relic into the sea and make a big show of 
it -- and this was done, though many survivors considered it a publicity stunt. 
There was only timid applause. 
</P>
<P>
To the majority, this was a day for recounting old memories, not making new 
ones, a time to reflect on when the madness in the world seemed to grow 
collective and the doors of sanctuary closed. A day to tell their story: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Persecution by Nazis 
</P>
<P>
In 1933, Hitler, arch-villain in a century's worst nightmare, rose to power. 
The anti-Semitic thuggery of his Nazi Party would soon warp toward genocide. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the Nazis' aim was to force the Jews to flee. They stripped them of 
their legal rights and placed them under the boot of the security police. 
Possessions were seized, businesses shut. Arrests were arbitrary. 
</P>
<P>
Some Jews did go, but most remained, believing the terror would spend itself 
over time, like a storm. That is what Liesl Loeb's father, a prominent lawyer, 
told his family. "Then came Kristallnacht," Loeb recalled Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 9, 1938, was the night of broken glass. Brown-shirted mobs burned 
synagogues and ransacked stores and pummeled Jews in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Karliner's father, a shopkeeper in a town near the Polish border, was 
taken to a concentration camp: "When he came back, we almost didn't recognize 
him. And my uncle, he was taken too, and the (police) eventually came to the 
door with a little box and said: 'Here is what's left of him.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Escape Became Obsession 
</P>
<P>
There would be no more talk of riding things out. Every Jewish life was in 
danger. People were afraid to leave their homes. Escape became an obsession -- 
and the greatest hope of all was to make one's way to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
America, after all, was not only a nation of freedom and justice, but a land 
made great by the toil of immigrants. The Statue of Liberty in New York harbor 
welcomed refugees. Its inscription concludes: Send these, the homeless, the 
tempest-tost to me. I lift my lamp beside the golden door! 
</P>
<P>
"And President Franklin Roosevelt, he had been built up to us larger than life, 
a great humanitarian," said Eric Stein, then a boy of 11. 
</P>
<P>
But Americans had their own anxieties. They were emerging from the Great 
Depression and worried that foreigners would take their jobs. Many wanted no 
part of the trouble in Europe. Besides, it wasn't so clear to some people what 
side to be on. 
</P>
<P>
And what of the tempest-tost Jews? Well, maybe they were asking for it, many 
said. Anti-Semitism did not hide in America. It was as easy to find as a radio 
show or a rally in Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Years on Waiting Lists 
</P>
<P>
The United States, like most other countries, preferred that the Jews find some 
place else to go. Country by country, immigration quotas were rigidly enforced. 
Jews were given no preference. Their names filled waiting lists. Years from the 
top. 
</P>
<P>
That was why the voyage of the St. Louis was so remarkable. Officially, the 937 
Jewish passengers were booked for Havana, Cuba. But most of them also had 
fulfilled U.S. requirements and held quota numbers. In a year or two or three 
they might take the step across the Florida Straits to America. 
</P>
<P>
For them, this change in fates seemed almost surreal. They left behind the 
persecution of Germany on May 13, 1939, aboard a luxurious ocean liner, their 
comforts elegantly tended to and the chaos of the world kept away by a moat as 
wide as the sea. 
</P>
<P>
The ship's captain was Gustav Schroeder, an honorable man who insisted that the 
passengers -- many just freed from concentration camps -- be treated to all the 
customary amenities. 
</P>
<P>
"We were transported into another world," remembered Ruth Holman, 30 years old 
then, the wife of a pharmacist. "Oh, it was elegant. The mood was wonderful. I 
would dress up to go dancing every night." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hitler's Photo Removed 
</P>
<P>
The long, tapered vessel had a beauty salon, card rooms, a gym, a library, a 
swimming pool. Winding staircases led to the ballrooms, where the orchestra 
played spirited waltzes. Movies were shown, absent the depressing newsreels. 
Hitler's photo was removed from the social hall during Sabbath services. 
</P>
<P>
Crystal chandeliers hung above the grand dining room. The tables were set with 
fine china and cutlery, and gourmet meals were served by uniformed waiters. 
Coffee, meats, tropical fruits; these were things the passengers had not tasted 
in months. 
</P>
<P>
Children played tag on the decks. "This was paradise for a kid," Eric Stein 
said. "Before the ship, the world had gone completely nuts. Now, all of a 
sudden, it was one big party." 
</P>
<P>
But Hitler and his propagandists knew something that Schroeder did not: The 
ship was no longer welcome in Havana, according to authors Gordon Thomas and 
Max Morgan Witts, who wrote the book "Voyage of the Damned." 
</P>
<P>
Cuba had been an important refuge, accepting far more Jews than most countries. 
To some extent, this was owed to corruption. Trouble began when the jefes began 
to quarrel over splitting bribes. At any rate, Cuba's president, Federico Bru, 
tightened the immigration loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brutal Treatment Denounced 
</P>
<P>
This set up a confrontation that appealed to the German fuhrer. Diplomats from 
around the world had denounced his brutal treatment of the Jews. All right, 
then, he would call their bluff. Who among them would take these people? 
</P>
<P>
The passengers, of course, knew nothing of this scheming. When the St. Louis 
entered Havana's harbor, they rushed to the railings and scanned the outline of 
their supposed sanctuary. Delays in disembarking at first only seemed the stuff 
of bureaucratic sluggishness. 
</P>
<P>
Jews already in Havana greeted the ship. Many used motor launches to nudge up 
beside the mammoth vessel so they could recite prayers and shout hosannas to 
relatives and friends on board. 
</P>
<P>
One of those in the small boats was Karliner's uncle. "The first word of 
Spanish I learned was manana; we would all leave the ship tomorrow," Karliner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But days passed, and Cuba's decision to rebuff the refugees became more and 
more clear. Newspapers sent correspondents. The unwelcome St. Louis became an 
international story. 
</P>
<P>
On shore, the docks took on the ambience of a carnival. Vendors peddled food. 
People rented binoculars. What would these desperate Jews do next? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Passenger Slits Wrists 
</P>
<P>
During the afternoon of the fourth day, passenger Max Loewe slit his wrists 
with a straight razor and leaped over the side into the bay, where he was 
rescued. "I remember him racing by, the blood dripping . . . " Eric Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Cuban officials remained firm: The Jews must go. Privately, however, 
they agreed to relent for a hefty bond. Backdoor negotiations proceeded with 
representatives from the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC). 
</P>
<P>
There was an offer and then a counteroffer. Then, suddenly, for whatever 
reasons, Bru broke things off. He ordered the ship away. And on June 2, 1939 -- 
20 days after departing Germany and six days after arriving in Havana -- the 
languishing St. Louis headed back out. 
</P>
<P>
On board, rejoicing had become lament. For 12 hours the ship circled in an 
ever-widening arc off the Cuban coast, hoping to be recalled. Then, finally, 
Schroeder gave the order to proceed slowly northward toward Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"America was my dream nirvana," Liesl Loeb recalled. "From the time I was a 
child, this was all our family hoped for: America." 
</P>
<P>
In the brightness of early morning they saw the shores of Miami Beach. The ship 
moved close enough for the city to reveal itself -- the bend of the palm trees 
and the creamy colors of the oceanfront hotels. 
</P>
<P>
But any hope of docking was soon blunted by the appearance of U.S. Coast Guard 
patrol boat CG244. It chased the St. Louis farther out and made sure no one 
aboard jumped off and swam for land. 
</P>
<P>
The front page of the June 5, 1939, New York Times contained an article 
headlined: "Refugee Ship Idles Off Florida Coast." By coincidence, a headline 
in an adjoining column said: "Roosevelt Appeals To World To Join Moral 
Rearming" -- an appeal by the President for "moral fiber" among people of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Historian David Wyman, an esteemed Holocaust scholar, finds the inadvertent 
pairing of stories ironic. What about America's moral fiber? he asks. "If the 
world had opened its doors, hundreds of thousands of Jews would have been 
saved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1939, we did not know there would be genocide; but we surely knew lives 
were in danger . . . . Only when expulsion failed did the Nazis turn toward 
extermination." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Joint Telegram to Roosevelt 
</P>
<P>
On June 6, no help forthcoming, the St. Louis ended its futile inching along 
the U.S. coast. In a final clutch at rescue, the passengers sent a joint 
telegram to Roosevelt. There was no reply. 
</P>
<P>
"No one listened; the world turned its back," Karliner said. 
</P>
<P>
Not entirely. As the ship returned toward Germany -- its passengers in a dour, 
almost funereal gloom -- the JDC was able to arrange for the Jews to be split 
among England, Belgium, Holland and France. 
</P>
<P>
For some, this was a saving grace. Those sent to England survived. But after 
World War II broke out, Germany occupied the other three nations. Jews there, 
in monstrous numbers, were sent to the death chambers. 
</P>
<P>
So Sunday, 28 of the survivors came back and relived a part of it. Most of them 
had long since made it to America and adopted it as home. "The bloody page of 
history has turned," said Hans Fisher, 61. "We are here; the Nazis are gone." 
</P>
<P>
For many, any bitterness toward the America of 1939 has turned to vapor; but to 
others it is too stubborn an ache for time to soothe. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, yes, 50 years ago I was here," said Gisela Lenneberg, now 91, seated on a 
deck chair, the buildings of the city in her sight just beyond the surf. "They 
didn't let us in." 
</P>
<P>
Her voice rose slightly: "We were desperate. And you know what they said? Go 
back to Hitler."

VOTERS BACKING OPPOSITION IN POLISH ELECTION

Poland's voters poured out by the millions Sunday and cast their ballots in 
what the official news agency PAP called "an atmosphere of calm, seriousness 
and responsibility" in the first partially democratic elections here in more 
than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
When the polls closed at 10 p.m., PAP hailed the balloting as a "new chapter of 
socialist parliamentary democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Official results may not be available for two days, but preliminary indications 
were that candidates backed by Solidarity were beating Communist candidates by 
huge margins in those races where head-to-head contests were allowed. 
</P>
<P>
An elderly woman voter, referring to the Communist-controlled elections of the 
past, said after casting her ballot: "It feels totally different. Now there is 
freedom of choice." 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since a national election in January, 1947, that Poles 
were given a meaningful choice among candidates, though political power will 
remain with the ruling Communist Party under an agreement with the Solidarity 
trade union and other opposition forces. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 27.2 million Poles were eligible to choose among nearly 2,300 
candidates for 525 contested seats in a new bicameral legislature. Poles in 
foreign countries cast absentee ballots at embassies and consulates around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
More than 73% of the eligible voters cast ballots, a StateElectoral Commission 
spokesman said early today. 
</P>
<P>
For some the choice was bewildering. In rural areas, some voters, especially 
elderly and ill-educated farmer folk, were confused over the voting procedure, 
according to local poll watchers. Voters were presented with as many as seven 
paper ballots and were instructed to cross out the names of candidates they 
opposed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Too Many Names' 
</P>
<P>
In some places, people had to cross out more than 100 closely printed names of 
candidates for various posts to pick their choices. "Too many names," 
complained one rural voter. "People are getting lost. They don't know who is 
who." 
</P>
<P>
However, most voters seemed well coached on the complicated process of 
selecting candidates. Many reported that they were voting for the first time in 
40 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important this time," said one man outside a suburban Warsaw polling 
station. "This time something could change here." 
</P>
<P>
For 48 cloistered nuns, the election was a rare venture into the mundane world. 
They had received special permission to vote at a Warsaw polling station. One 
made a broad, sweeping sign of the cross before dropping her ballot into the 
ballot box marked with Poland's national colors, red and white. 
</P>
<P>
If the election can be viewed as a referendum on four decades of Communist 
rule, as most Solidarity supporters contend, it seems likely to turn out as an 
embarrassing rout for the authorities of Poland, whose list of 35 candidates 
for the national Parliament were failing to win election, even though they were 
running unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa warned against an overwhelming defeat of the 
Communist slate and its supporters, fearing a backlash by hard-liners that 
would set back Poland's march to greater democracy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Single Red Rose 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a single red rose tucked in the breast pocket of his coat, Walesa, his 
wife, Danuta, and their 19-year-old son, Bogdan, walked 100 yards from their 
home in the Oliwa section of the Baltic port city of Gdansk to the polling 
station to cast their ballots. 
</P>
<P>
"Poland has started on the road to progress," Walesa told a throng of cheering 
supporters. But he cautioned that when the elections are over, "the hard work 
will begin. That is why we should stick to moderation." 
</P>
<P>
Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski, whose regime had at one time outlawed 
Solidarity and sent Walesa to prison, cast his ballot in the Mokotow district 
of Warsaw, spending three minutes to make his choice. 
</P>
<P>
At stake in the election are 100 seats in a newly revived Senate and 460 seats 
in the Sejm, or Parliament. The Senate seats are all freely contested, but the 
proportions in the Sejm are to be divided -- 65% for the Communist coalition 
and 35% for all others, including Solidarity candidates. Walesa said he would 
be satisfied if Solidarity won 25% of Sejm seats and 75% of the Senate seats. 
</P>
<P>
Exit polls conducted by representatives of Western news agencies showed 76% of 
those polled as voting only for Solidarity, while only 3.9% voted for Communist 
coalition candidates. Nineteen percent said they selected candidates from both 
slates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Against Government Candidates 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more significantly, 87% said they voted against all or some of the 
government's select national list candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The vote survey was highly informal and taken mainly in Warsaw, but it 
conformed closely to more thorough pre-vote polls that indicated 75% of the 
voters would back Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
If the government's national slate fails to be elected, it could throw into 
disarray the closely-worked balance in the national Parliament. Strategists for 
both Solidarity and the government say they are uncertain what steps will be 
taken, and under what authority, to replace candidates who might be wiped off 
the national list. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is important because if Solidarity were to dominate the Senate and 
win all the seats available to it in the Sejm, it could split the votes in both 
houses of the new National Assembly virtually in half. The Communist 
authorities here had banked on having at least a narrow majority to control the 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The voting was orderly and generally efficient throughout the country, with 
poll watchers from both the opposition and the government present at each 
polling station. The well-organized Solidarity activists set up information 
stations near each polling place, handing out sample ballots to any voter 
seeking instruction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Democratic Reforms In Poland 
</P>
<P>
Constitutional reforms enacted in Poland as a result of negotiations between 
the ruling Communists and the opposition groups led by the trade union 
Solidarity radically change the structure of the government, giving Polish 
voters unprecedented freedom of choice and reducing the power of the 
Communists. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the key elements of the new structure: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Office of President 
</P>
<P>
Chief executive elected to six-year term by a joint vote of both houses of 
National Assembly. Appoints government ministers; can veto legislation passed 
by the Sejm. Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who is currently first secretary of the 
Politburo of the ruling Polish United Workers' Party and president of the 
Council of State, is expected to be elected to this new post after this 
Sunday's voting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Polish National Assembly 
</P>
<P>
Advises lower house; empowered to veto legislation passed by the Sejm. Two 
seats per province, with one extra seat each for Warsaw and Katowice. No party 
quota or screening of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
100 seats / Freely Elected 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restructured lower house: Sejm 
</P>
<P>
Adopts legislation by a majority vote; can override veto of upper house by a 
two-thirds vote. Opposition agreed not to contest seats of governing parties 
this year, but may in next election in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
460 Seats 
</P>
<P>
Government Parties 
</P>
<P>
Polish United Workers'Party (Communists) 175 Seats 38% 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Party and United Peasants' Party (Communist allies) 124 seats 27% 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposition 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity, Rural Solidarity and other groups 161 seats 35%

IRAN FACES KEY CHALLENGES AT HOME, ABROAD

<P>
The death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini presents Iran's Islamic revolution 
with political challenges, both internal and external, potentially more ominous 
than any it has faced in the decade since the ouster of the shah. 
</P>
<P>
For all the purges, infighting and executions that marked the Khomeini epoch, 
according to U.S. analysts and Iran specialists, the immediate post-Khomeini 
period may turn out to be even more divisive. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, several opposition groups vowed to wage new military and 
political campaigns and openly predicted the collapse of the 20th Century's 
only theocracy. "We are going to witness the downfall of the regime in the near 
future," claimed Aladdin Touran, spokesman for the Moujahedeen, or Holy 
Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
And Reza Pahlavi, who crowned himself shah shortly after his father's death in 
exile in 1980, said, "The Islamic Republic is dead with the passing away of 
Khomeini." 
</P>
<P>
Yet in contrast to the early 1980s, when Islamic fundamentalists were 
relatively united against challenges from leftist, secular and monarchical 
groups, the challenges facing the revolutionary cadre now are likely to pit the 
mullahs, or clergy members, against themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Now they must finally confront the disputes that have stalemated movement on 
key economic and political issues for almost six years -- since major 
opposition groups were largely eliminated inside Iran. 
</P>
<P>
If the revolution is to survive, specialists generally agree, it will have to 
act on two broad issues: domestically, loosening the revolution's draconian 
grip on society and, in foreign affairs, coming to terms with the outside 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"Short-term, Iran is likely to witness great tension and uncertainty. What we 
have seen of the power struggle so far may seem insignificant in comparison 
with what lies ahead," said one U.S. analyst. "But long-term, the government 
will have to become more realistic and more tolerant if it hopes to survive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Breaking Point 
</P>
<P>
"For one thing, it no longer has Khomeini's magic to provide cohesion. For 
another, its problems have reached the breaking point." 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini's absence is likely to be most deeply felt on the issue of national 
unity. While he antagonized much of the outside world, he was, in fact, the 
conciliator in keeping rivals under the same political roof at home. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the key roles that Khomeini always played was to act as a mediator, as 
an intermediary between the various warring factions," said Gary Sick, the 
National Security Council official in charge of Iran during the Carter 
Administration. "Now that he is gone, there is nobody to stand between those 
factions." 
</P>
<P>
The divisions among so-called pragmatists and hard-liners are so entrenched 
that the Islamic Republic's first president, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, predicted 
from his exile in Paris that Iran might be engulfed in a civil war as bloody as 
Lebanon's strife. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who are the remnants of Khomeini's government and regime are not 
people with the authority to issue decrees from the Islamic vantage point. 
Technically today, the regime is no longer an Islamic republic," Pahlavi said 
on ABC's "This Week with David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rebel Claims 
</P>
<P>
And the Moujahedeen's Touran told The Times that the Moujahedeen's National 
Liberation Army, which is based in Iraq, would launch a military assault on 
Iran. The Moujahedeen, an Islamic Marxist group, made its first military gains 
in the final stages of the Iran-Iraq War in 1988. It claims to have increased 
its combat ability by 50% in the past four months in preparation for a final 
confrontation with Tehran's clerics. 
</P>
<P>
Tehran's political spectrum is labyrinthine and often complicated by clan and 
business intrigue. But, in simple terms, it pits those favoring gradual reforms 
at home combined with better relations with the outside world against others 
determined to endure sacrifice in the name of revolutionary purity. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, the theocracy's swift selection of at least a 
temporary successor, President Ali Khamenei, within 24 hours of the imam's 
death may calm fears of instability and violence. 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official expressed "a certain amount of admiration" 
that the mullahs so quickly agreed on a new leader. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Organized Quickly 
</P>
<P>
"Either they were able to get organized more quickly than outsiders thought 
possible or they had gone a long way toward consolidating things already," he 
commented. 
</P>
<P>
The widespread consensus among U.S. intelligence and State Department officials 
has been that no single figure would be able to replace Khomeini. The prevalent 
analysis had predicted that he would be replaced by a council of three to five 
senior clerics, which Iran's constitution provides as an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Winning agreement on the members of such a council might have only further 
entrenched the divisions, since the major factions would each have insisted on 
representation. While Khamenei's role is likely, at least short-term, to be 
more ceremonial than authoritative, a single well-known figure at the helm may 
help alleviate public anxiety in the short-term. 
</P>
<P>
The next three months will be crucial in determining the leadership and shape 
of post-Khomeini Iran, and whether the revolution can survive without the 
charismatic authoritarian who pulled off one of the greatest political feats of 
the century. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Self-Imposed Timetable 
</P>
<P>
In effect, the Islamic Republic has a self-imposed timetable to sort through 
several political issues because of presidential elections, scheduled before 
the imam's passing, in mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few similarities between Iran and the United States is that 
presidents are limited to two terms. Khamenei's second term expires this year. 
</P>
<P>
In large part because of the deadlocks created by the power struggle, a 
movement was launched earlier this year to strengthen the presidency and to 
streamline the cumbersome policy-making apparatus in other branches of 
government. In the run-up to the election, a special assembly of religious and 
political experts was enmeshed in outlining the first amendments to the Islamic 
Republic's constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The changes were widely expected to pave the way for Speaker of Parliament 
Hashemi Rafsanjani to become Iran's first executive president. Although he has 
long been the de facto second-in-command, his attempts at pragmatic reform have 
been repeatedly blocked by both more conservative and more radical internal 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economic Hardship 
</P>
<P>
The pressures for political change and for solutions to growing economic 
hardships were reaching crisis proportions. They were also beginning to 
threaten public support for the revolution. The two-step plan this summer was 
designed to break the logjam. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini's passing, however, could not have come at a worse time for Iran, 
State Department sources said. All major initiatives required the imam's 
imprimatur to win endorsement. Without him, they predicted, the constitutional 
changes now being debated and the presidential contest could well become the 
focal points for an escalating internal clash. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if they recognize they must pull together after Khomeini's death, we're 
going to see a lot of factionalism for quite a long time," said Shaul Bakhash, 
an Iranian-born professor of history at George Mason University and author of 
"The Reign of the Ayatollahs." 
</P>
<P>
Western hopes of an imminent turn in Iranian foreign policy after Khomeini's 
death are also unlikely, Iran specialists said, particularly on terrorism and 
an opening up to the West. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Renewal of Relations 
</P>
<P>
"The prospects for renewal of relations with the United States or the release 
of the nine American hostages (held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon) remain as 
remote as ever," said one American analyst. 
</P>
<P>
"While a power struggle looms, every leader and every contender will try to 
appear more militant than anyone else, in keeping with Khomeini's last edicts." 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the imam's final orders are as important as his last will and 
testament, which was read Sunday in Tehran, in setting the tone for the 
immediate future. Although he reluctantly agreed to a cease-fire with Iraq last 
summer and subsequently relaxed societal bans on music, chess and theater last 
fall, his tone turned hard again this spring. 
</P>
<P>
His "death sentence" in February on Salman Rushdie, author of "The Satanic 
Verses," and the firing of his heir apparent in March were followed by public 
condemnations of "liberals" who were selling out the revolution to Western 
interests.

"Jerome Robbins' Broadway," a collection of dazzling dance numbers from some of 
the famed choreographer's biggest hits, won the Tony Award on Sunday as best 
musical of the 1988-89 Broadway season. 
</P>
<P>
The show, which features excerpts from "West Side Story," "Fiddler on the 
Roof," "Gypsy" and other Robbins musicals, took a total of six Tonys, including 
one for Robbins as director of the musical. 
</P>
<P>
"The Heidi Chronicles," Wendy Wasserstein's comedy about one woman's 20-year 
journey to self-fulfillment, was named best play. 
</P>
<P>
After thanking the cast, the crew, the production team and her family, 
Wasserstein said: "One last word, which is for women playwrights. I think this 
is great for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Although "The Heidi Chronicles" took the top play award, it could manage only 
one other prize -- a featured actor award for Boyd Gaines. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Bosco, a sentimental favorite, won the award for best actor in a play, 
and Pauline Collins was named best actress. 
</P>
<P>
The audience cheered as Bosco, a veteran New York actor who had never won a 
Tony before, went to the stage of the Lunt-Fontanne Theater. He accepted the 
prize for his portrayal of an apoplectic opera impresario in the farce, "Lend 
Me a Tenor." 
</P>
<P>
The director of "Lend Me a Tenor," Jerry Zaks, picked up the prize for best 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
Collins won for her portrait of "Shirley Valentine," in a one-woman play about 
a bored but never boring middle-aged English housewife. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerome Robbins' Broadway" dominated the musical performance awards. It won for 
Jason Alexander, the show's ebullient master of ceremonies, and for two 
featured performers -- Debbie Shapiro and Scott Wise. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Brown, the 1950s rhythm and blues queen, was picked as best actress in a 
musical for the revue "Black and Blue." 
</P>
<P>
Christine Baranski, who played a neurotic, twitching housewife in Neil Simon's 
farce, "Rumors," won for best featured actress in a play. 
</P>
<P>
The technical honors were split among three shows and four designers. Jennifer 
Tipton won the lighting award for "Jerome Robbins' Broadway," Santo Loquasto 
the scenic prize for "Cafe Crown" and Claudio Segovia and Hector Orezzoli the 
costume award for "Black and Blue."

627 ARRESTED IN SEABROOK PROTEST

<P>
Hundreds of opponents of nuclear power swarmed over or crawled under the outer 
perimeter fence at the Seabrook nuclear power plant Sunday, and police made 627 
arrests without resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, engineers hit a snag when a problem developed in a water feed pump 
valve. The problem, officials said, has put the countdown for the plant's first 
atomic chain reaction on hold. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, including children and a woman in a wheelchair, climbed or 
were helped over the seven-foot chain-link barrier at three points. Hundreds of 
other protesters remained outside the fence. 
</P>
<P>
The number of arrests was the second-highest in the many protests at the plant, 
a focal point of the anti-nuclear movement since construction began 13 years 
ago. More than 1,400 arrests were made at a May, 1977, demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
The civil disobedience came the day after a rally attracted 4,000 protesters, 
the protests coinciding with preparations at the plant for low-power testing, 
now expected to begin late this week. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Paul Cronin said 627 arrests in all were made. About 75 people who 
were arrested in the afternoon returned to the plant and were taken into 
custody again, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Seabrook opponents, led by the Clamshell Alliance of protest groups, maintain 
that the $6-billion plant is not safe and that the congested beach tourist area 
around it could not be evacuated safely in case of an accident.

Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh denied Sunday that the Justice Department has 
targeted Democrats for investigation and defended his agency against charges of 
politicization, saying: "We will investigate Republicans or Democrats . . . 
make no mistake about that." 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh, speaking on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation," refused to talk about an 
FBI inquiry regarding Rep. William H. Gray III (D-Pa.), who is seeking his 
party's third-ranking post in the House, but insisted that the Justice 
Department had not singled out Democrats for scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely not," he said. "I couldn't state it more firmly. We will 
investigate Republicans or Democrats where there are credible allegations of 
wrongdoing, and we will prosecute them if the evidence indicates they are 
violating federal criminal law." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Stake in Integrity' 
</P>
<P>
He added: "We have a very high stake in the integrity of this department. 
During my career as a prosecutor, during the department's history, we have 
never hesitated to go where the evidence leads us. If it's a Republican or a 
Democrat, including some of the highest offices in the land, that's our charge. 
It's a charge that we take seriously, and it's a charge I assure you we will be 
faithful to." 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said that a full investigation was under way to determine the source 
of damaging leaks about Gray, who is seeking to replace Rep. Tony Coelho 
(D-Merced) as majority whip. Coelho announced his resignation in the midst of 
the ethics scandal that has engulfed the Capitol and led to the announced 
departure last week of House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
Gray, who chairs the House Democratic Caucus, has said that FBI agents 
questioned him on Memorial Day, but has denied that he is the focus of a 
criminal inquiry. The investigation reportedly involves allegations that a 
"ghost" employee was on the payroll of the House Budget Committee in 1988 while 
Gray was the panel's chairman. But Gray said last week there was no such 
employee on his staff. 
</P>
<P>
"The concern about leaks is one that I stand second to no one in the 
seriousness of the matter," Thornburgh said. "If the leaks are true, then they 
have the potential to compromise seriously ongoing criminal investigations. If 
they are false, then they have the potential to seriously jeopardize the 
reputation of persons who may not be guilty of any wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demand Outside Counsel 
</P>
<P>
Angry Democrats demanded last week that Thornburgh appoint an independent 
outside counsel to investigate the leaks, saying that the department could not 
effectively investigate itself. But Thornburgh on Sunday staunchly defended his 
decision to conduct an in-house examination. 
</P>
<P>
"I have directed that every resource that we have in the Department of Justice 
be brought to bear on the investigation of the leaks," he said. "And I've 
stated, I think quite clearly, my intention to see that anyone who's been 
guilty of unauthorized disclosure of any information regarding pending 
investigations will be fired immediately. . . . I've directed that a thorough 
investigation be carried out so that we can get to the bottom of where these 
leaks come from." 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh declined to discuss a rumor put forth by some Republicans that as 
many as 10 other Democrats are under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to comment on any pending investigations, only to assert once 
again that these are not political investigations," he said. "We have to very 
carefully protect our integrity from these kinds of charges by simply dealing 
in one commodity and one commodity only: and that's legally admissible evidence 
of violation of federal criminal laws. Be they Republican or Democrat, they're 
going to be pursued."

Muslims the world over mourned the death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of 
Iran, and leaders of several governments proclaimed periods of mourning. 
</P>
<P>
"Leaders like Imam Khomeini are born but once in centuries," Pakistani Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto said in a message to Iran before her departure for a 
visit to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of Iran have lost a divine guide and the world of Islam a spiritual 
leader of unique qualities and strength," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In a 10-day period of state mourning for Khomeini, the Pakistani flag will be 
flown at half-staff at government buildings and at its missions abroad, the 
government said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OPEC Delay 
</P>
<P>
In Vienna, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries delayed opening 
its midyear conference today by several hours in honor of Khomeini. Iran is one 
of 13 OPEC members. 
</P>
<P>
Afghan President Najibullah described the ayatollah's death as "an irreparable 
loss" and declared three days of national mourning, state-run Kabul Radio 
reported. "The vacuum created by his death cannot be filled," Najibullah said 
in condolences sent to the Iranian leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shiite militant group in Lebanon, staged marches 
in eastern Lebanon to express grief over Khomeini's death. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grieving Crowds 
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, the Muslim Cabinet of Premier Salim Hoss announced three days of 
mourning in Muslim areas and lowered flags to half-staff. Thousands of grieving 
men, women and children took to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Syria, Iran's only Arab ally in its devastating eight-year war with Iraq, 
declared a week of mourning. 
</P>
<P>
In Iraq itself, news of the ayatollah's death was reported with little comment. 
Arab states that generally backed Iraq in the conflict, which ended in a 
cease-fire last August, were also restrained in their reactions.

1,500 AT CONSULATE IN L.A. MOURN BEIJING DEAD

Chinese students in Los Angeles replaced the blue ribbons they have worn to 
support the struggle for democracy in their homeland with black and white ones 
of mourning Sunday when 1,500 demonstrators gathered at the Chinese Consulate 
to grieve for the dead in Beijing and to condemn the government that carried 
out the violence. 
</P>
<P>
It was an emotional gathering in front of consulate headquarters in the 
mid-Wilshire district -- one that united students from China, who had only 
recently arrived here to attend college, with Chinese-Americans who have lived 
in the United States all their lives. 
</P>
<P>
During the course of the five-hour demonstration, the students staged a mock 
funeral procession in memory of those killed, played a tape-recording of a 
telephone conversation that took place on Saturday between students in China 
and the United States, then read a "letter to the world" condemning the actions 
of the Chinese government and calling on the world community to investigate the 
Beijing massacre. 
</P>
<P>
Although many of the songs, chants and speeches used during the protest were in 
Mandarin, the emotions and actions of the demonstrators spoke a universal 
language. 
</P>
<P>
There was the quiet sobbing that permeated the stillness when six men, in the 
center of a small procession, carried a gray coffin through the crowd, laid it 
on the steps of the consulate and covered it with a red, white and blue flag 
symbolizing Chinese solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
There were the solemn expressions and tears of the protesters as they listened 
to a 12-minute tape in which a student at Beijing University told students at 
Caltech in Pasadena to let the people know "that the darkest and bloodiest 
tragedy in human history is happening in China. But . . . the final victory 
belongs to the people." 
</P>
<P>
There were also moments marked by bursts of applause and song. The crowd 
clapped when Weichang Li, 32, a UCLA graduate student and lifelong Chinese 
Communist, stood up and, with tears in his eyes, denounced his party. They 
clapped when a student representative, speaking for the Southern California 
Chinese Student and Scholar Assns., asked for all Chinese people to unite and 
told China's leaders that "in the heart of 1 billion Chinese people, you are 
dead." 
</P>
<P>
And they sang. The song was called "If We Unite, We Will Have the Power," said 
Chang Lei, a 29-year-old student at USC. 
</P>
<P>
The tune was appropriate, the students said, in an ironic way. It was the song 
the Chinese people sang during the Communist revolution, which triumphed 40 
years ago.

<P>
After calling upon the troops of the People's Liberation Army to slaughter 
unarmed civilians, China's Communist Party leadership has set itself on a new 
course in which it will face a daunting, perhaps overwhelming, series of 
problems caused by its own fateful decision. 
</P>
<P>
The first and foremost obstacle will be to win over the support of a divided 
Chinese Communist Party and of China's own population. "They're going to be 
dealing with a sullen, resentful country on a permanent go-slow," observed one 
Western diplomat here. 
</P>
<P>
No one here knows for sure whether the Chinese leaders identified with the 
actions of the past few weeks -- particularly Premier Li Peng and President 
Yang Shangkun -- will be able to hold on to the power they now seem to be 
wielding. As long as many people in China think these men will eventually be 
deposed and disgraced, few will want to cooperate too closely with them. 
</P>
<P>
The result, experts say, will be a China which is much less stable and much 
less capable than it has appeared for the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
"The likelihood of a strong, stable, forward-looking China has diminished," 
said Kenneth Lieberthal, head of the University of Michigan's Center for 
Chinese Studies, in an interview here. "This place faces enormous problems, and 
the ability to manage those problems has been diminished. What you're seeing 
now is political decay, a deterioration of the political system." 
</P>
<P>
The triumph of the new hard-line leadership will have a dramatic impact on 
China's dealings with the rest of the world, too. "This regime has lost all its 
credibility," said one Western European diplomat Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
It will be much harder for China to obtain from the West the advanced 
technology, the foreign investment and the loans it needs for its economic 
development. And, realizing how difficult it will be, the Chinese leadership 
may not try so hard to obtain it. 
</P>
<P>
China could try to turn to other Communist countries for whatever economic help 
they can provide. Or, alternatively, the Chinese leadership could try to turn 
inward again, reviving the old policies of "self-sufficiency" with which Mao 
Tse-tung once sought to have China go it alone. 
</P>
<P>
How did it happen? What prompted China's political leadership to take what 
seems, on the surface, to be such a drastic step? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Old Men Clinging to Power 
</P>
<P>
One reason clearly is the advancing age of China's leaders and their insistence 
on clinging to power. 
</P>
<P>
One joke making the rounds here is that China's current political crisis can be 
explained as "a bunch of 80-year-olds telling a bunch of 70-year-olds which 
60-year-olds should retire." 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the surface changes of the past decade, the Chinese Communist Party 
is still dominated by Deng and his contemporaries from the Long March 
generation -- old party stalwarts such as Chen Yun and Peng Zhen who, while 
officially retired from their posts in the government and Politburo, continue 
to wield tremendous influence over major party decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"The leadership seems completely out of touch with what is going on in 
(Chinese) society," Lieberthal observed. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States or some other Western country, a troublesome 84-year-old 
who sought to cling to power would be nudged aside. A favored son or daughter 
might well be dispatched to tell father it is time to give up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Easy to Let Go 
</P>
<P>
But in China, getting an octogenarian to let go is not so easy. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is not merely one of Confucian filial piety, but of China's 
still-feudal social and economic system. In China, sons, daughters and other 
relatives enjoy enormous privileges and power based on their parents' position 
-- and when the father falls from power, so does the rest of his family. Sons 
and daughters have a vested stake in preserving their parents' position. 
</P>
<P>
Deng and his old allies grew up together in the secret underworld of the 
Chinese Communist Party. They fought wars together, killed enemies together, 
built a country together, and suffered together during the Cultural Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're seeing is the workings of a mystical secret society," said one 
Western diplomat here last week after Deng's old allies re-emerged in positions 
of influence once again. 
</P>
<P>
In times of crisis, the old party stalwarts come together once again, their 
personal bonds tighter than those of whoever serves on the Politburo of the 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leaders Facing Two Crises 
</P>
<P>
For China's Old Guard, this spring has been a time not just of one crisis but 
of two. 
</P>
<P>
The first crisis is one of political succession. By all appearances, Deng, 84, 
is in frail health. Within the Communist Party, Premier Li and Communist Party 
General Secretary Zhao Ziyang have for most of the past year been maneuvering 
for influence, thinking ahead to the post-Deng era. 
</P>
<P>
So, too, within the People's Liberation Army, which Deng heads as chairman of 
the party's Military Commission, rival factions have been feuding with one 
another, military analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
Yang, the Chinese president and Deng's close ally, leads one faction which 
includes his own relatives. His own younger brother, Yang Baibing, holds one of 
the top Chinese military posts as head of the PLA's political department. The 
PLA's chief of general staff, Chi Haotian, is said to be Yang Shangkun's 
son-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rival Group in Army 
</P>
<P>
A rival group within the PLA is clustered around Chinese Defense Minister Qin 
Jiwei. He was formerly the head of the Beijing Military District, some of whose 
troops are said to have opposed the imposition of martial law here. 
</P>
<P>
The second crisis of the past spring, of course, was the burgeoning student 
movement for democracy, which grew to the point where more than 1 million 
Beijing residents joined in the protests. 
</P>
<P>
To Westerners, the China of the past decade may not seem like a place where 
ideology matters very much. But to the Old Guard of the Chinese Communist 
Party, it still matters a great deal. 
</P>
<P>
Deng and his allies do not share Mao's ideology of radical egalitarianism. They 
have been willing to tolerate economic forms -- free markets, private plots for 
peasants -- which Mao would never have allowed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Belief in the Party 
</P>
<P>
But the Old Guard, including Deng, have always insisted upon rigid adherence to 
a belief in the unchallenged leadership of the Communist Party. In their minds, 
that is what the student demonstrations for democracy had begun to threaten. 
</P>
<P>
In a remarkable speech to the Military Commission on May 24, explaining the 
imposition of martial law, Yang said he and the other party elders "feel there 
is no way to retreat." 
</P>
<P>
"Back-stepping will be the end of us," Yang said. "It will be the end of the 
People's Republic of China, will be the restoration of capitalism, (the goal) 
which was sought by (U.S. Secretary of State John Foster) Dulles. After several 
generations, our socialism would be turned into liberalism." 
</P>
<P>
Within 10 days, Chinese troops began to crush China's movement for democracy.

Bewildered Beijing residents, venturing out Sunday to view the damage or 
huddled nervously in darkened homes, despaired over a feeling that the clock 
had been turned back to earlier oppressive times. 
</P>
<P>
Many were angered and sickened by the extent of the bloodletting early Sunday 
at Tian An Men Square. They railed at the government for its cruelty and for 
disgracing China. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a crime that cannot go unpunished. We in China have let these things 
happen too often. There is never an end," said Song Weiming, a resident of the 
Qianmen district, a block south of Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
For many, there was a feeling of deja vu in the bleak appearance of Beijing a 
day after government troops gunned down hundreds of pro-democracy students and 
other civilians. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Back to Bicycle Bells 
</P>
<P>
Motor vehicles all but disappeared from the streets, taking Beijing back to the 
days when the tinkle of bicycle bells was a dominant sound. 
</P>
<P>
Few stores were open; the relative abundance that had enlivened Beijing streets 
in recent years seemed to have evaporated at a stroke. Commerce was limited to 
vegetable stands set up by traveling farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Power went out in large sections of the city, making a gray and stormy 
afternoon even grayer. It was not clear whether the government had ordered a 
blackout or whether electricity lines had been damaged by the overnight 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the Cultural Revolution," said Zhao Lao, an elderly resident of the 
Hepingmen district less than a mile from Tian An Men. "Or worse, like war." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the concern over the disruption of daily life, residents appeared to be 
burdened by a fear of chaos and repression not known for almost 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assault a 'Great Victory' 
</P>
<P>
Government rhetoric added to the atmosphere. Official Chinese radio referred to 
the massacre in Tian An Men Square as a "great victory," saying that the 
violence was caused by a "gang of thieves bent on throwing the whole country 
into confusion." 
</P>
<P>
The army's "heroic acts and glorious exploits have won fervent praise and 
strong support from the masses," the broadcast concluded. 
</P>
<P>
In strongly worded posters, the government also ordered residents to sit at 
home, an order ignored by many who wanted at least to escape the heat of their 
crowded homes. 
</P>
<P>
"We hoped to leave behind the days when the Chinese people could be flogged and 
beaten like animals," said Zhao Yi, Zhao Lao's son, who works as a tailor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Affluence and Fear 
</P>
<P>
Zhao Yi lives in a hutong, the typical winding alleyway that is the 
characteristic style of old neighborhoods in Beijing. With the combined income 
of his two brothers and their wives, Zhao was able to buy a refrigerator as 
well as an electric fan and floor heater for his home, all goods available to 
many Chinese in the recent years of rising economic growth and consumption. 
</P>
<P>
"But what does all this mean if they are shooting people outside your door?" 
Zhao asked. "Our government is completely bankrupt." 
</P>
<P>
A few doors down the alley, Liu, who said he is a stage actor, asked a visitor 
how it would be possible to emigrate to the United States. "I never thought 
this way before, even during the Cultural Revolution, when I saw my father 
beaten and humiliated just because he was a teacher," Liu said, shaking his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I see there is no hope for China." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smoldering Jeep Carcass 
</P>
<P>
Just a block from the hutong at the corner of West Qianmen and South Xinhua 
streets, passers-by gaped at the smoldering carcass of an overturned jeep. 
Behind it, a pair of twisted buses that army tanks had pushed out of the way 
blocked the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the street crowd walked up to touch the scorched jeep. One middle-aged 
man put his 3-year-old child in the seat of a bus and snapped his picture. 
</P>
<P>
"Does this happen in foreign countries?" a young bicyclist asked a foreigner, 
observing the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"Is America going to do anything about the killing?" asked another. 
</P>
<P>
"What will happen next, do you think?" a third inquired. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rifle Fire Echoes in Square 
</P>
<P>
Just then, a sharp rat-a-tat-tat of rifle fire echoed down from Tian An Men 
Square. Sightseers and loiterers scurried for cover. It was the kind of scene 
played out all around the square: Groups of bicyclists and pedestrians would 
approach; some would yell at soldiers to go home; more troops would arrive and 
fire, spreading panic down the adjacent streets. 
</P>
<P>
"This is too scary," said a young father, clutching his baby daughter. "Now we 
do not know who is in charge. I used to follow these things but I just don't 
know. I am confused, totally confused." 
</P>
<P>
Rain began to fall, and thunder punctuated the sound of gunfire. The crowd on 
Qianmen Street began to disperse, exposing a line of troops looking on 
impassively in their rain ponchos, rifles held across their chests.

ON THE OVERNIGHT SHANGHAI-TO-BEIJING TRAIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first thing one noticed about the students traveling eagerly to Beijing 
early Sunday was how sure they were that they would not be punished for 
opposing the government. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been promised by our teachers that the army would do nothing to harm 
us if we remained peaceful," said Chai Chishan, an engineering scholar from the 
prestigious Qinghua University in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not afraid of the soldiers," added Wang Binghai, a classmate who 
studies nuclear engineering. 
</P>
<P>
The students had not heard. They knew nothing of the army assault on Tian An 
Man Square and other parts of the capital. They knew nothing of the tanks, the 
armored personnel carriers or the machine guns. Nor of the slaughter -- the 
seemingly random shooting of men, women and children alike. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rejoining the Movement 
</P>
<P>
All they knew was that they were on their way to Beijing to rejoin the student 
movement they had left a week ago. Chai and Wang had gone to Shanghai to whip 
up support among provincial college students. 
</P>
<P>
Campaigns run by such students had their effect; all the universities and other 
institutes of higher learning in Shanghai were closed and trains were filled 
with recruits coming to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks, thousands of students had been traveling from as far away as Canton 
in the south and Manchuria in the northeast to get a firsthand look at the 
turmoil, and to take part despite orders by the government to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
"I read a wallposter and decided it was time to come," said Wing Wei, a student 
of international law at Shanghai Institute of Politics and Economics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thermos Bottles, Knapsacks 
</P>
<P>
Wing and two classmates came with at least a dozen other students in car seven 
of the nonstop overnight train that had departed Shanghai at 4:02 p.m. 
Saturday. They traveled with only little thermos bottles and knapsacks in hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to spend the night in Tian An Men Square," said an English literature 
major who called himself Ben. "I want to see what it's like. We cannot trust 
what our government tells us." 
</P>
<P>
"Our government is a gangster government," said Wing Wei. 
</P>
<P>
"Our government tells lies," chimed in another student, Zhi Jen, from the East 
China Institute of Chemical Technology. 
</P>
<P>
"We want a free press!" Wang called out. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the English and American system of law!" yelled another student. 
</P>
<P>
The outcry was beginning to attract curious, silent stares from other 
passengers in the crowded car. The students quieted down, passing time by 
watching the countryside go by. In the south, the soybean harvest was under 
way. In the north, wheat was ripening. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the students played bridge, sometimes they sipped tea or slept. When 
they talked, however, the chatter always returned to politics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Premier 'Incompetent' 
</P>
<P>
Wang wondered whether the students had not gone too far by calling for Li Peng, 
the hard-line premier, to step down. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us think we should ask for something less, something we can agree on. 
Perhaps just to enforce constitutional rights," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But," argued Chai Chishan, "we asked for very little at the beginning. We only 
wanted a meeting and an open press. Li Peng refused." 
</P>
<P>
"Li Peng is incompetent," said a student from the Shanghai Foreign Languages 
School. 
</P>
<P>
"IN-competent," he repeated, with excessive elocution. 
</P>
<P>
Reminded that in China's recent past, such talk meant jail, the youth seemed 
uncomprehending. "It is not dangerous to dream," Wing Wei interjected. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, of all the things the youths needed to fear, the people they were 
most afraid of were their parents. Not a one had told their father and mother 
they were going to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"My father would whip me good if he knew," said Zhi Jen. 
</P>
<P>
"I said that, with school on strike, I wanted to see China. My parents even 
gave me money!" boasted the foreign language student. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fears Mother's Wrath 
</P>
<P>
"I am more afraid of my mother than the soldiers," joked Ben. 
</P>
<P>
The train approached Beijing early Sunday morning. The loudspeaker system in 
the car played cha cha cha music, alternating with Chinese pop. 
</P>
<P>
The train crossed over a main boulevard. Something was burning at a distant 
intersection. The students looked at the passing image in silence. 
</P>
<P>
The piped-in music stopped, and a recorded announcement welcomed passengers to 
Beijing and listed famous sites, including Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
"Tian An Men is the center of national life," the bouncy announcement said. "It 
is there where the Forbidden City is located, as well as Mao Tse-tung's tomb, 
the Great Hall of the People and the National History Museum." 
</P>
<P>
"Tian An Men -- that's where I'm off to," said Zhi Jen. Others said they were 
going to Beijing University and other campuses to search for friends. 
</P>
<P>
The train arrived with a screech, and the students grabbed their knapsacks, 
joining the throng heading for the exits. Outside, there were no buses or 
taxis. Flatbed bicycle cart operators offered rides for $10 to points just a 
mile away. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the meaning of this?" asked Wang, using a common Beijing expression. 
</P>
<P>
"They have killed the people," responded a ragged cart man. 
</P>
<P>
The gathering students said nothing, and counted up their money to see how far 
it would take them in a city and situation they had never imagined.

The trauma of bloodshed showed on the faces of hundreds of Beijing citizens 
waiting outside emergency clinics at the city's hospitals Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky," said a middle-aged man outside the Sino-Japanese Friendship 
Hospital in northeast Beijing, his arm in a sling after being hit by a bullet. 
</P>
<P>
"Six came with me here in the ambulance. Four are dead, including a child and 
two lady students. All of us were shot about 2 o'clock this morning when we 
went outside our homes in Nanheyuan to see what was going on," he said 
</P>
<P>
Nanheyuan is a street close to Tian An Men Square, into which heavily armed 
troops and tanks moved before dawn to crush a seven-week student protest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doctors Reticent 
</P>
<P>
A doctor at the Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital said staff members have been 
ordered not to give information to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens waiting outside were not so reticent. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I know the real meaning of fascism," said a student at the Petroleum 
University who left the square before midnight Saturday, escaping the killings. 
</P>
<P>
"Two of my colleagues there when the soldiers moved in said they issued a 
warning that all should leave the square but did not give them enough time. A 
few minutes later they started firing into the air, then at the students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants to Oust Regime 
</P>
<P>
"We must overthrow this cruel government. We must have a general strike." 
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged man nearby added: "We want the United Nations to come and 
investigate who are these counterrevolutionary thugs the government keeps 
talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Official accounts blame the disturbances on counterrevolutionaries. 
</P>
<P>
"The official news is all lies. Please tell the world of what the army has 
done. It no longer deserves to be called the People's Army, it is the army of a 
few families," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In another hospital, a copper bullet was being extracted from the lower back of 
a man in his 50s, who grimaced with pain, his mouth full of gauze. 
</P>
<P>
"He was cycling to work this morning as usual," one of the staff said. "The 
troops opened fire indiscriminately." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Displays Extracted Bullet 
</P>
<P>
When the bullet was pulled out, a nurse showed it to her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the government's present to an innocent worker. Is he a 
counterrevolutionary too?" 
</P>
<P>
A more senior hospital official intervened and told a reporter to leave. 
</P>
<P>
At a third hospital were two corpses. One was a student; grieving friends and 
relatives surrounded the other, a worker, and lifted his jacket to show the 
bullet wounds in the heart. 
</P>
<P>
"He was going to work as usual," said a colleague, fighting back tears. 
</P>
<P>
"The soldiers were firing at anyone. (Premier) Li Peng is a murderer. He must 
be punished." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shock, Calls for Revenge 
</P>
<P>
Reaction among bystanders outside was a mixture of shock and a call for 
revenge. 
</P>
<P>
"We must punish this illegal government," said one worker. "We should strike or 
at least work as little as possible. This will hurt China's economy but it is 
necessary to get rid of this government." 
</P>
<P>
Another was more fatalistic. 
</P>
<P>
"The Beijing people will never forget this day," he said. "But what can we do? 
We earn little and have no power. The government has the guns. 
</P>
<P>
"We must eat, so we must work." 
</P>

Soviet television on Sunday broadcast dramatic footage of clashes between 
Chinese troops and protesters in Beijing in a report that balanced official 
Chinese claims with Western casualty estimates. 
</P>
<P>
There was no official comment from Soviet authorities on the bloody clashes. 
</P>
<P>
The nightly news program "Vremya" quoted official Chinese announcements that 
the troops "were brought in to maintain order and bring life back to normal in 
the capital, and have the support of the population and students." 
</P>
<P>
But it added Japanese estimates that hundreds died when troops stormed Tian An 
Men Square. The report quoted a Western diplomat saying unrest was continuing 
in Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
The TV report, which ran more than three minutes, showed crowds surrounding a 
truck full of troops. The crowds were shown grabbing at soldiers and shouting 
amid confusion, fire and smoke. 
</P>
<P>
The report also showed army tanks rumbling through deserted Beijing early 
Sunday after troops had cleared the streets. 
</P>
<P>
The official news agency Tass and Radio Moscow carried factual reports about 
the incident, with no commentary.

Patlex Boosts Stake in ESRAC: Patlex Corp. said it has boosted by $2 million 
its investment in ESRAC Publishing, a New York company publishing a rival to 
the Daily Racing Form. Patlex, which holds a 64% interest in three key laser 
patents, also made a $900,000 investment in ESRAC in February. ESRAC publishes 
FIGS FORM, a daily thoroughbred horse racing newspaper distributed in 
Connecticut, New Jersey and New York. Its current paid circulation, at $2 a 
copy, is about 10,000, said ESRAC President Robert Sinn. He said the paper will 
start distribution next month in California and the Las Vegas area and sell for 
$2.50 a copy.

Regulation for Traders to Be Proposed: Responding to charges of cheating in 
U.S. futures pits, the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said 
the agency will propose a bill by July 1 to require all traders to register 
with federal authorities. In a letter to Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman 
Patrick Leahy, CFTC Chairman Wendy Gramm said the agency will also propose 
regulatory changes in trade monitoring standards and dual trading by September 
if those changes are warranted. Some critics say exchanges, now required to 
keep track of all trades to the nearest minute, should be required to tighten 
the standard, called the audit trail, to prevent unscrupulous traders from 
cheating.

TRADE LEADERS PLEDGE WORLD PACT IN 1990;

Top trade officials of the United States and its major economic allies, anxious 
about the pace of sweeping negotiations to overhaul the world's outmoded 
trading system, launched a major push Sunday to instill new urgency into the 
talks to prevent them from bogging down. 
</P>
<P>
At a weekend meeting here, the officials -- representing the United States, 
Japan, the European Community and Canada -- reaffirmed their intention to 
shepherd the negotiations to a close by the original late-1990 deadline, 
instead of allowing them to slip, as some countries have proposed. 
</P>
<P>
They also pledged to place their individual proposals for changes in world 
trade rules on the table by the end of December to allow time for the 
106-country negotiating group to address the broad array of issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Energizing the Talks 
</P>
<P>
The move by the Big Four trade ministers was designed to breathe new life into 
the negotiations -- which are known more formally as the Uruguay Round -- in 
order to head off delaying tactics by smaller countries that ultimately could 
derail the effort to overhaul global trading rules. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the senior trade officials participating in this weekend's session 
in this tidy Dutch capital said the major challenge now will be to persuade the 
newly industrializing countries -- such as Brazil, India and South Korea -- to 
join in the necessary compromises as the late-1990 deadline approaches. The 
developing countries, which historically have maintained tight restrictions on 
trade and investment, have balked at the prospect of too sweeping a change in 
either sector. 
</P>
<P>
After 2 1/2 years of preliminaries, the negotiations -- launched in October, 
1986, at Punta del Este, Uruguay, under the aegis of the Geneva-based General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- are just entering the hard-bargaining stage. 
</P>
<P>
A major goal of U.S. trade policy since the early 1980s, the negotiations are 
seeking to slash agricultural subsidies around the world and to extend world 
trading rules to things such as services, investment and intellectual property 
-- patents, copyrights and trademarks -- that have not been covered before. 
</P>
<P>
By any measure, they constitute the most sweeping agenda for global trade 
negotiations ever attempted. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here Sunday, trade ministers of the four major trading 
blocs expressed optimism about the talks, but decided that the industrialized 
nations would have to increase their pressure or the negotiations might well 
slip -- possibly fatally -- beyond the 1990 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Much Time Left 
</P>
<P>
Frans Andriessen, the EC's trade minister, told reporters that the industrial 
powers are increasingly aware that "not very much time has been left" to 
complete the negotiations. "We're all agreed that we have to keep the momentum 
going, so that no one can get the impression that it can slip," he added. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills echoed those views. And Japan's Vice 
Minister of Trade, Shigeo Muraoka, said the group had shown "strong political 
will" to push the talks forward. 
</P>
<P>
Muraoka took an opportunity at a press conference following the two-day meeting 
to again berate the United States for using the new Omnibus Trade Act to 
threaten Japan with retaliation if it does not reduce alleged trade barriers 
involving forest products, super computers, and satellites. 
</P>
<P>
Repeating Japan's contention that the new Super 301 provision of that law -- 
under which the United States acted May 25 when it cited Japan, India and 
Brazil for employing unfair trade practices -- was illegal, he noted: "We 
should seriously question ourselves what would happen to the GATT if many other 
countries" follow the United States' example. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, both U.S. and foreign officials said the Super 301 actions were 
not a major point of discussion at the meeting this weekend. The industrial 
nations already had formally rebuked Washington for using such threats at a 
meeting in Paris last week of the 24-country Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development. 
</P>
<P>
Work is going ahead to develop broad trade proposals to place on the 
negotiating table. The United States, for example, has said it will outline a 
new system for converting agricultural subsidies into tariffs, so they can be 
measured -- and ultimately reduced -- more easily. 
</P>
<P>
Japan is working on a plan for deciding what country should be listed as the 
country-of-origin in cases where a product is assembled in several different 
parts of the world. Canada is drafting a new plan for reducing government 
subsidies for specific products. And the EC will propose new ways for countries 
to deal with cases in which domestic industries are hurt by unexpected surges 
of foreign imports. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and its trading partners remained split on one procedural 
point -- whether to design proposed reductions in tariffs and subsidies to 
apply equally across the board, or to negotiate them individually according to 
product category.

The U.S. economy cooled slightly in May for the first time since July, 1986, in 
a further indication that inflation could be easing, the nation's purchasing 
managers said in their monthly report. 
</P>
<P>
Production by the nation's factories continued to grow, although at a 
significantly slower pace than in April, according to the report issued Friday 
by the National Assn. of Purchasing Management. 
</P>
<P>
"The total economy resumed its ratcheting path toward slower growth during May 
as the manufacturing economy reported the first decline in growth in almost 
three years," said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the trade group, which is based 
in Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
"Once again, expanding exports and increased capital expenditures are providing 
the real growth," he said. "Virtually all indicators confirmed the slowing of 
the economy and, perhaps most importantly, the sharp slowing of inflation 
growth along with it." 
</P>
<P>
The group's purchasing managers' index declined to 49.7% in May, down sharply 
from 53% in April, the group said. It was the first time in 33 months that the 
indicator had dropped below 50% and indicated that the economy was slowing 
further, the group stated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Price Index Drops 
</P>

A reading above 50 indicates that the economy is generally expanding; below 50, 
that the economy is generally declining. 
</P>
<P>
"The PMI has averaged 51.9% for the first five months of 1989," Bretz said. 
"Past experience indicates that if this average were to continue for the 
balance of the year it would be consistent with real GNP growth of about 2.5%, 
or roughly the same as in the first quarter. The PMI would have to fall below 
44% before signaling negative real GNP." 
</P>
<P>
The group's price index plunged to 57.6% in May from 66.5% in April, the lowest 
since December, 1986. Prices of only 11 items in the group's survey rose last 
month, the fewest since February 1987. 
</P>
<P>
New orders continued to expand in May but also at a reduced rate, the group 
said. Once again, inventory buying did not supply the growth in production; 
inventories decreased sharply in May for the fifth consecutive month.

Driving for Dollars: What may be one of the best jobs on the East Coast was 
uncovered recently when Boston Edison Co. sought a rate increase: Budget 
documents revealed that the chairman's chauffeur is paid $60,000 a year. Not 
even Donald J. Trump's driver makes that much and he's been with the real 
estate tycoon for 10 years. The chauffeur's salary is among the $185,000 that 
the utility spent last year to provide company officials with cars and 
chauffeurs. News of the expenditures comes as the company seeks an $85-million 
rate increase, or about $50 more a year from its customers.

Casino Workers OK Contracts: Workers at six of Nevada's largest hotel-casinos 
ratified new five-year contracts by a near-unanimous vote, apparently ending 
the threat of a crippling gaming industry strike that would have dampened a 
booming Las Vegas economy. Members of Culinary Local 226 and Bartenders Local 
165 ratified agreements, by a vote of 4,378 to 130, with Circus Circus, the 
Tropicana, Bally's, Caesars Palace, the Las Vegas Hilton and the Flamingo 
Hilton. The contracts provided for a $1.25-an-hour wage increase over the life 
of the contract, a 95-cent-an-hour boost to health and welfare pension funds 
and tightened job security.

Sony Expands Line: Sony Corp. said response has been so strong to the first 
Video Walkman TV/VCR introduced two months ago that it is adding another model 
to its line. The GV-9 is being introduced by Sony to expand the personal video 
market and consumers' options for video entertainment. This new unit has a 
4-inch color liquid crystal display screen, providing about an 80% increase in 
viewing area over the original model. It includes an 8-millimeter videocassette 
recorder, a programmable timer and many other features in a package measuring 
just 2 pounds 14 ounces. The suggested retail price is $1,500.

Sears Boycott Threatened: The American Postal Workers Union has demanded that 
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. remove mini-post offices set up in 11 of its stores 
and threatened to boycott the retailer if it ignored the request. "We view this 
as a menace to postal jobs, postal workers and the general public," union 
President Moe Biller said. A Sears spokeswoman said the Chicago-based retailer 
planned to continue the one-year pilot program at least through October. She 
said she was unaware of plans to expand the program. Biller said he was told by 
Postal Service officials that as many as 100 Sears stores may soon have the 
counters.

CBS' ROTH FREED, BACK ON CHINA FRONT LINES 
</P>

CBS correspondent Richard Roth was freed Sunday after nearly 20 hours in 
captivity in Beijing, during which time he said he was kicked and punched by 
the Chinese troops who had arrested him and his cameraman. He immediately 
resumed reporting from Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
His release and news reports came as the three major TV networks and CNN aired 
graphic photographs and videotape footage -- the latter flown out by couriers 
-- of the pre-dawn carnage in Tian An Men Square, where army troops late 
Saturday and early Sunday crushed the long student demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
The networks' first video footage of the bloodshed, broadcast before dawn 
Sunday and later that morning, included scenes of bloodied bodies lying on the 
ground, a tent being crushed by a tank and dramatic shots on ABC of a stalled 
armored personnel carrier exploding after being set afire by student-thrown 
Molotov cocktails. 
</P>
<P>
Under martial law imposed May 20, live TV and taped video transmissions from 
Beijing are banned. Network correspondents largely have ignored the taping 
prohibition, however, and have been flying their news footage from Beijing to 
Hong Kong, Tokyo and other points. They also have continued to file live 
telephone reports from Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
In a phone conversation with CBS anchor Dan Rather that was broadcast live 
Sunday morning, Roth said that he and cameraman Derek Williams "were well 
treated" following the initial encounter with Chinese troops the day before 
during another live phone call to CBS. That report from a vantage point near 
Tian An Men Square abruptly halted amid sounds of a scuffle and Roth's cries of 
"oh, no!" when he was seized. 
</P>
<P>
Williams and eight other Westerners, including an unidentified Italian 
journalist whom Roth said had been badly beaten, also were released Sunday with 
Roth, a 17-year veteran with CBS News. 
</P>
<P>
Roth's release came after CBS News President David Burke sought help from 
Secretary of State James Baker. Burke had written Baker that Roth's violent 
seizure "represents the worst form of interference with our obligation to 
report on the events in China and gives us great concern for the safety of our 
newsmen." 
</P>
<P>
CBS on Sunday said it was indebted to Baker, the United States Information 
Agency and Sen. Brock Adams (D-Wash.), who has ties with top Chinese officials, 
for their efforts to secure the release of its two staffers. Exactly what role 
they played was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Roth reported that shortly before his release, civilian authorities asked him 
to "sign a waiver saying that 'you recognize that it (his reporting) was a 
risky thing to do and you're responsible for your own security." He did not 
indicate whether he complied. 
</P>
<P>
Roth said he suffered "a small cut" under one eye and a gash on his head when 
seized by a small group of Chinese troops shortly before dawn Saturday in 
Beijing. He said he offered no resistance when the armed soldiers grabbed him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pulled along . . . and stumbled a bit and tried to get myself up," he 
told Rather. "And in the course of . . . righting myself, (I) was then kicked 
down by one of the soldiers. As I picked myself up, he threw a left hook at me 
. . . and I didn't duck." 
</P>
<P>
He said the cut under his eye later was "treated gently and, it seemed, capably 
by a Chinese army medic." 
</P>
<P>
The troops held Roth and Williams, a New Zealand national who was not hurt, for 
about 40 minutes in the Great Hall of the People near the square, Roth 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't see what was going on but we could hear the assault (by the army 
against the demonstrators) that had just begun," he said. "The sounds we heard 
were ferocious sounds." 
</P>
<P>
The troops later took Roth, Williams and a Chinese-speaking American music 
student who also had been arrested on a Jeep trip through the then-empty Tian 
An Men Square to a military encampment at the Forbidden City enclosure in 
Beijing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roth described the scene as one that seemed "out of a movie," with torn and 
ripped tents that had housed the protesting students, troops sitting around and 
several armored personnel carriers, six to eight light tanks and truck-drawn 
heavy artillery in the square. 
</P>
<P>
Turned over to civilian authorities, "we were treated quiet well," he reported, 
adding that while the holding facility was uncomfortable, his captors "were all 
essentially courteous to us. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Others held with him included a couple from Long Island, N.Y.; three Swiss 
tourists; the son of Pakistan's ambassador to China; the Italian journalist, 
and the Chinese-speaking American music student who had acted as an interpreter 
for the CBS staffers. All apparently had been watching the demonstrations when 
arrested. Roth didn't identify the Americans in the group. 
</P>
<P>
When they got word that they were being released and prepared to leave the 
Forbidden City by one exit, he said, a group of soldiers noting that the area 
outside was ringed by angry students "came to us and said we were crazy to 
leave through there, it's too dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
They walked to a government visa office and were driven away in a government 
car. 
</P>
<P>
During Saturday's pre-dawn violence, network correspondents had been able to 
report from the scene live by portable telephones and walkie-talkies patched 
into network offices at Beijing hotels, and relayed both live and on tape by 
commercial phone lines to network headquarters in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
ABC correspondent Kyle Gibson reported that she came under fire three times, 
but was not hit. 
</P>
<P>
NBC feared for the safety of one of its two-member camera crews when it was out 
of contact for several hours. But staffers Tony Wasserman and Maurice Odell, 
who'd been separated from correspondent Arthur Kent, showed up safe later 
Saturday, said Jerry Lamprecht, NBC vice president for news coverage.

'WKRP' PRODUCER FASHIONS 'TEDDY Z' FOR RISE TO FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When CBS previewed its fall pilots to advertisers recently, producer Hugh 
Wilson was called upon to make an impromptu speech about his new half-hour 
comedy "The Famous Teddy Z." "Don't worry," Wilson told the advertisers, a wry 
smile revealing a shining mouthful of braces. "It has plenty of jokes and lots 
of white people." 
</P>
<P>
Only those familiar with Wilson's track record as a producer would understand 
his cryptic and somewhat bitter comment. 
</P>
<P>
"Teddy Z," which will debut this fall in the 9:30 p.m. Monday time slot 
sandwiched between the successful comedies "Murphy Brown" and "Designing 
Women," is a traditional sitcom that stars Jon Cryer ("Pretty in Pink") as a 
21-year-old mail-room clerk who suddenly finds himself rocketed to the big time 
at a fictional Hollywood talent agency. It's a far cry from Wilson's last 
project: CBS' now-defunct "Frank's Place," a decidedly non-traditional 
half-hour that featured very few jokes and lots of black people. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank's Place," launched in the fall of 1987, starred Tim Reid as a Boston 
college professor who inherited a New Orleans Creole restaurant. It was one of 
several of that season's so-called "dramedies" -- one-camera, filmed shows that 
broke sitcom tradition by blending drama and comedy, as well as removing the 
studio audience and its laughs from the mix. 
</P>
<P>
"I never liked that -- dramedy," Wilson says now. "It sounded like we were all 
post-Impressionists or something." 
</P>
<P>
The show won critical praise and an Emmy (for outstanding writing in a comedy) 
but never won a large TV audience; though CBS tried "Frank's Place" in numerous 
different time slots throughout the season, it consistently ranked among the 
five lowest-rated prime-time shows. Last October, the network finally, 
apologetically, axed it. 
</P>
<P>
The cancellation came as a relief to Wilson, if not to star and co-executive 
producer Reid, whom Wilson says would have liked to continue. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so hard to do; it took so long to shoot and to write," Wilson said. "If 
it had been successful, none of that effort would have made you tired. But to 
work that hard and have the show put in (disadvantageous) time slots, and then 
we were off the air on hiatus -- 'on hiatus' is a lovely word for 
'we-don't-know-what-to-do-with-you-so-we're-going-to-throw-you-on-the-shelf'. . 
. . All that was really emotionally grinding. 
</P>
<P>
"Plus, it was angering, and somewhat embarrassing, to work that hard on a show 
and see it ranked 70th, or 71st. You almost say: 'Oh, what the hell. The hell 
with it.' I'm a little bitter -- yeah." 
</P>
<P>
After the death of "Frank's Place," the weary Wilson signed a contract to 
develop new programs for Columbia Pictures Television; "Teddy Z" is the first. 
Wilson, always appreciative of CBS' putting "Frank's Place" on the air at all, 
gave the network first dibs on the show. 
</P>
<P>
No one at Columbia told Wilson to create the sort of mainstream, commercial 
comedy that "Teddy Z" is, but, he said, "I knew it would be inappropriate at 
this time for me to attempt anything like 'Frank's Place.' 
</P>
<P>
"I had more of a cynical feeling (about producing 'Teddy Z')," Wilson said. 
"Columbia made me an outstanding offer I just couldn't refuse, and I guess I 
thought I'd be doing this for the money. 
</P>
<P>
"But now, with this cast and this show, I've fallen in love again." 
</P>
<P>
The show centers on Teddy Zakalokis, a nice Greek kid from Torrance whose 
father and grandmother expect him to work in the family bakery, and who is 
unexpectedly thrust into the show-business maelstrom when Major Talent Agency's 
biggest star demands that Teddy be promoted from the mail room to represent him 
after a chance meeting. Along with Cryer, "Teddy Z" features Milton Selzer, 
Jane Sibbett, Tom La Grua, Josh Blake and Alex Rocco. (Lainie Kazan left the 
show after taping the first six episodes as Teddy's mother; the part was 
re-tooled, and Erica Yohn plays Teddy's grandmother.) 
</P>
<P>
Wilson noted that while "Teddy Z" is different from "Frank's Place," it marks a 
return to the "gang comedy" format of Wilson's first television series, "WKRP 
in Cincinnati," which ran on CBS from 1978 to 1982. And, he added, it's a lot 
easier to satirize Teddy's place, Hollywood, than to re-create life at a 
Cincinnati radio station or in the muggy New Orleans of "Frank's Place." 
</P>
<P>
The story of Teddy Z is loosely based on the career of Jay Kanter, 62, now 
president of production at Pathe Entertainment Inc. Kanter became a legend at 
MCA in the late 1950s when, in his early 20s, like Teddy Z, he was sent to a 
local train station to pick up Marlon Brando and transport him to visit 
relatives in San Marino. Brando took a liking to young Kanter and, much to 
everyone's surprise, asked Kanter to be his agent. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the hot young star, and he was always very difficult to reach," Canter 
shyly reminisced in a recent interview at his Beverly Hills office. "In 
essence, he said if anybody wanted to reach him, they'd have to talk to me. 
Suddenly, I became very popular." 
</P>
<P>
As his career burgeoned, Brando stuck with Kanter. "There are those who want to 
be represented by the more important agents with the company as they get more 
famous, but that was not the case with Brando," Kanter said. Kanter continues 
to serve as the agent-less Brando's unofficial liaison with Hollywood. "They 
still call me," he said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Other characters in "Teddy Z" bear resemblance to real-life Hollywood figures. 
The venerable chairman of Major Talent Agency, Abe Werkfinder, is based on the 
late Abe Lastfogel, patriarch of the William Morris Agency; Al Floss, the 
hyperkinetic agent, is "a composite of three or four agents I've met in my 
lifetime," Wilson said. "I should say, that I've met in the last three or four 
years. I didn't meet any agents as a child. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I have to be very careful about is not to let the show be too 
'inside,' " Wilson added. "That's why I like to have the studio audiences come 
in. 
</P>
<P>
"When we screened the pilot, the audience reaction was excellent, but a bit 
confusing. So many agents and network executives and studio executives 
participated in that screening, I'd say, 'Is this an industry laugh or a 
civilian laugh?' I call (the nonindustry audience) civilians. From then on, I 
tried very hard to limit the number of seats going to people in the business." 
</P>
<P>
Although he won't use inside references if they detract from the action, Wilson 
doesn't mind an occasional in-joke. He also doesn't mind a few gags that only 
he gets. 
</P>
<P>
"I once heard an agent out here who kept calling one of his clients 'the 
greatest actor in the American language.' I put that in; nobody laughed. But 
who cares?" Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who defected from the advertising business in Atlanta in his early 30s 
to break into the entertainment industry, beginning at a low-level position 
with MTM Enterprises, said his experience differed greatly from Teddy 
Zakalokis' meteoric rise to the top. 
</P>
<P>
"He's awfully young and this is all so sudden, and so accidental," he said. "In 
a way, though, when he tells his (grandmother), 'You know, all these people 
drive Mercedes, but they don't seem all that much smarter to me,' I think I 
might be quoting myself."

THE DISPUTED LEGACY OF ANSEL ADAMS; 
</P>
<P>
COURT CASE TO EXAMINE NEW BOOK FEATURING SOME WORKS OF FAMED PHOTOGRAPHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trustees of the estate of the late photographer Ansel Adams are involved in an 
increasingly venomous court battle over a new book of photographs drawn from 
more than 200 images that Adams shot while working for the federal government 
in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Adams' trustees are seeking a court order against promotion of the book, "The 
Mural Project," and contend it falsely claims a copyright for the photographs. 
The two authors and the Santa Barbara publisher of the new volume have 
counterattacked, claiming that Adams may have improperly retained negatives to 
the photos in question. 
</P>
<P>
Central to the dispute is the status of hundreds of uncopyrighted, so-called 
"public-domain" photographs by Adams and other prominent photographers that are 
held by various U.S. government agencies. For fees of about $10 per picture, 
virtually anyone can obtain a print of such images and legally publish them. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles federal judge has scheduled a June 19 hearing on a request by the 
Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust and Adams' longtime publisher, Boston-based 
Little, Brown &amp; Co., for an injunction against allegedly improper use of 
Adams' name in promotion of the book. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed Feb. 14, has attracted almost no public attention. 
</P>
<P>
But behind it is a growing reservoir of bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
The negatives are still in Adams' vault in Carmel Highlands, Calif., according 
to court filings by the publishing rights trust. Adams died of a heart attack 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Adams and the publishing rights trust) have been hiding and lying about 
those negatives for years," author John Armor charged of the Mural Project 
pictures in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
In the suit, the Adams trust charges that Santa Barbara-based Day Dream 
Publishing Inc. and subsidiary, Reverie Press, and the two authors, Peter 
Wright and Armor, are trying to make a fast profit from Adams' reputation with 
a book designed to look like an Adams fine art book published by Little, Brown 
but filled with prints "of markedly inferior quality." 
</P>
<P>
"What they are doing is stealing his (Adams') name and his reputation," said 
William Turnage, Adams' longtime business manager and former head of the 
Wilderness Society who is one of the four members of the publishing rights 
trust. Adams' widow, Virginia Best Adams, is also a member the trust. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Adams) was terribly afraid that, when he died, people would come along and 
start ripping him off," Turnage said. "We're worried not only by the poor 
quality of this book and what it does to his reputation, but we're also worried 
about opening Pandora's box. 
</P>
<P>
"If you let somebody get away with this, then other people will say, 'What the 
hell.' If they hadn't been able to put Ansel's name (on it), they wouldn't have 
been able to sell three copies of this book." 
</P>
<P>
David Vena, a Los Angeles attorney and another Adams trustee, said that while 
the publishing rights trust has taken legal action against several dozen small 
publishers who sought to market fraudulent Adams posters, the new case is the 
first entire book subject to court action. 
</P>
<P>
The photographs directly in dispute date from 1941 and 1942 when Adams worked 
for the National Park Service, to produce images of park scenes to be blown up 
mural size for display in government buildings. The mural prints were never 
executed. 
</P>
<P>
It was during the same period that Adams shot his famous "Moonrise, Hernandez, 
N.M." Wright, Armor and their publisher have suggested that "Moonrise" might 
itself be considered a public domain work that is part of the Mural Project. 
The government has made no such claim. 
</P>
<P>
Then Interior Secretary Harold Ickes hired Adams for $22.22 a day in salary, 
plus expenses, government documents obtained by The Times show. 
</P>
<P>
The project is described by Adams in his autobiography, published the year 
after he died: "It sounded perfect to me -- one of the best ideas ever to come 
out of Washington." Adams wrote that the effect of the agreement with Ickes was 
that he would retain ownership of the negatives while prints of the photographs 
were to be turned over to the government. 
</P>
<P>
A set of prints of the entire collection, signed by Adams, has been in the 
National Archives in Washington since sometime after World War II. Their 
existence has never been kept secret by the government, and 15 of the images 
were published in authorized Adams books. Others were used in a government book 
10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But about two years ago, Wright and Armor, who were researching a book -- 
subsequently published in 1988 -- on Adams' photography of the Manzanar 
relocation camp, learned of the existence of the Mural Project collection in 
Adams' government personnel files. 
</P>
<P>
Wright and Armor have characterized both collections as "virtually unseen" and 
"all but forgotten." But officials of the Adams trust and an attorney for the 
National Archives say such descriptions overstate. Christopher Runkel, a staff 
attorney at the National Archives, said the characterization "kind of annoyed 
us." 
</P>
<P>
After Wright, a photo editor for the Associated Press in Washington, and Armor, 
an attorney, signed a publication contract with Times Books, a subsidiary of 
Random House Inc., to publish "Manzanar," the Adams trust stepped in. The trust 
obtained an agreement that the cover design and typography of the book would 
differ from Little, Brown's standard format for Adams volumes. 
</P>
<P>
But in February of this year, Vena and Turnage said and court documents charge, 
the Adams trust learned that Wright and Armor intended to issue a second book, 
on the Mural Project, to be printed from what are called "copy negatives," 
photographs taken of photographic prints for the purpose of duplication -- 
necessitated, Wright said, because government records indicated the Mural 
Project negatives had vanished without a trace. Dave Forgang, curator of the 
Yosemite National Park museum, said the fate of the negatives had also been of 
interest to park officials because documents, including a Sept. 30, 1942 letter 
to Adams from E.K. Burlew, an assistant interior secretary, observe that the 
negatives "are the property of the United States government." 
</P>
<P>
Forgang said two letters sent to Adams seeking information on the fate of the 
negatives went without reply in 1983 and 1984 -- though one, he said, would 
have reached Adams just days before his death. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, Armor and Forgang said they did not learn the fate of the negatives 
until Adams trust court documents disclosed that the negatives were housed in 
Adams' vault. 
</P>
<P>
Runkel said a review of the legal status of the Mural Project images led him to 
conclude that all 226 images in the Archives' possession are in the public 
domain. "In our opinion," said Runkel, "they could be used freely by anyone who 
wanted to." 
</P>
<P>
The Adams trust does not dispute the public domain ownership. Court papers 
indicate that the trust filed its suit because Reverie announced it would also 
publish wall and personal calendars containing the Adams images. Documents also 
charge "The Mural Project" was advertised and promoted to erroneously imply the 
book and calendars were sanctioned by the trust. Little, Brown also publishes 
its own line of authorized calendars. 
</P>
<P>
The suit charges the book's copyright notation falsely claims the photographs 
are included in the copyright for the text. The suit maintains the authors and 
the publisher improperly used Adams' name and contends Adams' reputation could 
be damaged by what the trust, in court documents, calls poor printing and 
reproduction. 
</P>
<P>
The injunction request to be heard by U.S. Dist. Court Judge William D. Keller 
June 19 demands a court order prohibiting advertising statements implying the 
Mural Project images have not been previously made public. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are just jackals," said Vena of the authors and Reverie Press. "If 
they want to go out and market his name, we'll try to stop them. That's 
exploitation at its worst." 
</P>
<P>
John Diamond, executive vice president of Day Dream and head of Reverie, said 
he had received a draft contract from the Book-of-the-Month Club, which, like 
Little, Brown, is a subsidiary of Time Inc., weeks before the book was 
published but that the contract offer was rescinded. He charged the decision 
was made under pressure from Little, Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Book-of-the-Month Club declined to discuss the contract, but a spokeswoman 
characterized the it as "a delicate situation." An attorney for Little, Brown 
said no official contract offer had been made by Book-of-the-Month. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond said "The Mural Project" is selling well. Priced at $34.95, the book, 
Diamond said, is in its third printing, having sold out two previous printings 
totaling 70,000 copies. Little, Brown said it does not make public sales 
figures for any of its books and would not comment on how the claimed sale of 
"The Mural Project" compares with other Adams properties. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond, a lawyer himself, said the Adams trust and Little, Brown "are 
incorrect, both in fact and in law," in their suit. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a great fan of Ansel Adams since I first got into photography," 
Wright said. "I remembering sitting in awe of this man. (But) once I got into 
this collection, I realized the only reason they never put it together and 
published it as a book was the fact that it was public domain stuff. I don't 
see it as greed, (but) the value (of the work) would decrease if any Joe Blow 
could go to the National Archives and get a print from (Adams') original 
negatives." 
</P>
<P>
Armor compared Little, Brown to "a schoolyard bully using high priced lawyers 
for fists." 
</P>
<P>
Diamond and Wright said still more Adams photographs have been located in the 
collections of private corporations for which Adams once did free-lance 
commercial photography. Both men said a third Adams book is under development, 
but they would not discuss its subject matter. Some additional Adams images are 
in the National Archives and Library of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Vena said the case may eventually bring pressure on Congress to redefine laws 
governing how publicly owned artworks may be used. Adams is not the only famous 
photographer whose work is in government hands. The Library of Congress has 
custody of a large collection of pictures taken during the Depression for the 
Farm Security Administration, including images by Dorothea Lange and Walker 
Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Vena said a variety of papers show that Adams' negatives were properly kept by 
him. "There are other documents" aside from the limited number introduced by 
Wright and Armor, Vena said. "It is our position that the negatives were not 
government property." But more important, he said, the dispute raises a larger 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some question in my mind whether the National Archives is abusing a 
trust in making this work available for commercial reproduction in a manner in 
which (the pictures weren't intended,)" he said. "I think one of the 
possibilities is the introduction of federal legislation to preclude work like 
this from being used by unrelated people for personal profit and gain."

LES MORMONS ATTACK PREJUDICE WITH HUMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joel Grey clones they are not. But musical cabaret artists Curtis York and 
Robert Daniels, the two young iconoclasts known as Les Mormons, do share a 
certain flamboyance with the Kit Kat Club's androgynous emcee. 
</P>
<P>
Mixing song, dance and theater in a variety act rife with black humor, Les 
Mormons call attention to the contradictions facing gays today. Like Grey's 
host in Weimar Germany, Les Mormons have fun in the midst of an urgent 
situation, employing show-biz strategies to mitigate against prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
They'll perform "Meet the Mormons" as part of Highways' "Ecce Lesbo, Ecce Homo" 
festival celebrating Gay Pride Month today and next Monday and June 19. 
</P>
<P>
"Meet the Mormons" is largely autobiographical. York, 26, was a Navy brat 
raised "all over the West Coast until my sister smoked pot and (my parents) 
decided it was time to go home to Utah." In college there, he met performance 
artist Rachel Rosenthal and moved to Los Angeles to study with her. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-year-old Daniels was born the towheaded child of Mormon American Indian 
parents. "I always stuck out and, when I hit 14, all hell broke loose," he 
recalls. "I was a rebellious brat -- which led me to exploring the arts." 
</P>
<P>
After getting involved with a nightclub in Salt Lake City that had lip-sync 
shows on the weekends and a stint with a late night TV dance show, Daniels 
moved to L.A. 
</P>
<P>
York has been excommunicated from the Mormon Church; Daniels just "dropped 
out." They met a year ago and, according to York, "freaked out at how funny we 
were and how much of a sensibility we shared." 
</P>
<P>
They prefer to remain ambiguous about the nature of their offstage 
relationship, saying only that they're "nameless incestuous lesbian twins." 
</P>
<P>
A Church representative who declined to be identified said that the Church 
allows gay men to belong if they never act on their homosexuality, but that 
there's no official position on the performance work of Les Mormons. 
</P>
<P>
The duo's work began when Daniels wanted to write a song for his father. York 
calls that song -- "My Father's Glands" -- "the seed of this performance." 
</P>
<P>
And as silly as that title may be, there's also a serious side to Les Mormons. 
York performs a monologue about "three experiences (he) had with Mormonism in 
relation to (his) sexuality: one as a child, one as a teen-ager and one very 
recently." 
</P>
<P>
"(In each case) I was the one who was victimized (and yet also) made to feel 
like the criminal," he explains with obvious pain at the memory. "I was told 
there was something wrong with me and I believed it." 
</P>
<P>
"As in the case of rape when the woman is made to feel guilty, I never talked 
about it," York continues. "But the statistics for child molestation and teen 
suicide are very high in Utah. These things could be helped if people would 
talk, but they're in a state of denial." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels, who says his association with York and their performance have made him 
more political, stresses the empowering aspects of cross-dressing, a tactic 
also used in feminist theater. 
</P>
<P>
"Cross-dressing is the correct word, not drag," he cautions, referring to the 
male and female roles both performers play in "Meet the Mormons." "Drag is 
someone trying to be a woman and it can be misogynistic. 
</P>
<P>
"(We're) the opposite of that: supporting women, showing how they're 
suppressed, especially in Utah where their Moms have been taught to make sure 
they go to Home Ec.," says Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the power attributed to gay people in the time before Christianity was 
their ability to go back and forth between aggressive and submissive, male and 
female," York explains. 
</P>
<P>
"I see gay men turning their backs or suppressing the feminine inside the gay 
community. It's not OK to be flamboyant, (and that's why) it's a very political 
thing to cross-dress." 
</P>
<P>
"There's this movement in the gay community to want to be James Dean-macho-'50s 
again while straight men are learning about feminism from their girlfriends and 
wives," he continues. "But in a male-dominated society, one of the ways that 
feminism and the power of the feminine can infiltrate would be through gay 
men." 
</P>
<P>
And proving that there's no place like home to begin changing the world, Les 
Mormons opened "Meet the Mormons" in Salt Lake City a couple of weeks ago in 
what they both agree was a "healing" experience. 
</P>
<P>
"As performers we have a public voice and a responsibility," York asserts. "I 
wanted to go back (to Utah to perform) because performance is one of the few 
forums in which people are going to listen about being gay and about AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
York also had more personal reasons. "(Utah) had become this horrible monster 
from which I had to escape and when I returned having developed a sense of 
myself and accomplishment, I found it wasn't the place, it was me," he offers. 
"It no longer has the power to do me harm."

JACK SMITH: THE TAX MAN COMETH, EVEN AFTER THE BOMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unsigned letter encloses a clipping from the San Jose Mercury News that is 
at once demoralizing and reassuring. It is credited to the Mercury News staff 
and wire reports and is datelined Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Its essence is that, in the event of a nuclear attack on America, we can expect 
at least two phenomena to survive -- cockroaches and the Internal Revenue 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
I had already heard it said that cockroaches, if anything, might survive a 
nuclear war. They are as ancient as civilization; they have survived man's 
resolute and ingenious attempts at eradication; they thrive today, despite the 
lethal effect of modern pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
I have an idea too that moles and gophers may survive, since they live in 
underground tunnels in which they might escape the effects of blast and 
radiation until it was safe to surface. But a world populated only by 
cockroaches, moles and gophers is not one most of us would want to inhabit. 
</P>
<P>
Remember back in the early 1960s when we underwent the nuclear bomb shelter 
craze? People were actually building bomb shelters in their back yards, with 
the naive notion that in a nuclear attack these holes in the ground, stocked 
with food, water, aspirin and gin, would see them through. We even argued 
whether people in San Bernardino County, say, should share their shelters with 
people fleeing from Los Angeles County, or hold them off with shotguns; but 
fortunately the craze died out before any of these confrontations ever 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
People stopped building bomb shelters, I suspect, because they finally realized 
that if their cities were leveled by atomic bombs, there would be little to 
come up for. We decided that nuclear war was too horrible to contemplate. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the Cold War is over, and we seem to have survived its hazards, we 
learn that certain members of our species, to wit Internal Revenue Service 
agents, are not only expected to survive a nuclear attack but to go on doing 
their job. 
</P>
<P>
The Mercury News said that the IRS expects to be back in business "within 30 
days." The story said, "That's the bad news." The good news is that residents 
of neighborhoods that are really devastated may get a break on delinquent 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The thinking here is that the government will be in such desperate need of 
money that the IRS will concentrate on taxes that can be expected to produce 
more of it. 
</P>
<P>
Instructions for agents working in bombed-out areas are spelled out in a new 
section of the Internal Revenue Manual, the tax agency's bible. The two new 
pages were added on orders of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"In the event of a national emergency (especially resulting from a nuclear 
attack) the primary function of the service is to support the secretary of the 
Treasury. This support at a minimum will consist of analyzing and reporting 
upon emergency tax legislation, prescribing regulations and forms, and issuing 
rulings and technical information of an emergency nature." 
</P>
<P>
So much for our hopes that after a nuclear attack we might never see another 
income tax form. 
</P>
<P>
The section on delinquent accounts reads: "On the premise that the collection 
of delinquent accounts would be most adversely affected, and in many cases 
would be impossible in a disaster area, the service will concentrate on the 
collection of current taxes." 
</P>
<P>
I'm not sure I like the moral implications of that stand. Those who pay their 
taxes on time would be the first to be harassed, while those who do not would 
be excused. The moral there is that if you expect a nuclear attack, don't pay 
your taxes. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the prospect of tax agents surviving does give us some hope. 
Imagine that you are sitting on your kitchen floor, having miraculously 
survived a nuclear attack. You see two cockroaches, mating, and you know that 
all life has not perished. 
</P>
<P>
And then, suddenly, you see standing in the rubble a smiling young man in a 
pinstripe suit with a yellow necktie, polished shoes and a chic briefcase. He 
says, "Would you be Jack C. Smith?" 
</P>
<P>
Not really knowing, you mumble, "I guess so." 
</P>
<P>
"Ho ho!" he says. "I'm your Internal Revenue Agent!" 
</P>
<P>
"But I paid my taxes," you protest. 
</P>
<P>
He says, "You're just the man we're looking for." 
</P>
<P>
You'd know then that life goes on. 
</P>
<P>
Wouldn't it make you cry?

A NEW TACK ON HUNGER; 
</P>
<P>
FRANCES LAPPE SEES OUR SMALL PLANET NEEDING BIG DIET OF ECONOMIC REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN HENDRIX, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1971, Frances Moore Lappe turned her one-page handout on the causes of world 
hunger into a book that she figured "would appeal to maybe 500 people around 
the Bay Area," where she was then a graduate-school dropout. 
</P>
<P>
Rooted in the thesis that hunger exists in the world not because of 
overpopulation or insufficient food production but because of a wasteful 
fixation on meat production, "Diet for a Small Planet" was an odd mix of 
ethical, political and economic analysis, autobiographical details and recipes 
for mung beans, tofu, grains and legumes. 
</P>
<P>
Three editions, 3 1/2 million copies and 18 years later, "Diet," as Lappe 
usually refers to it, is still selling and making its impact felt around the 
planet. So is its author. 
</P>
<P>
Lappe has written or co-authored a host of books and reports on social 
conditions around the world, always with food as a focus or starting point; 
spoken on hunger to countless groups, and co-founded with public-policy expert 
Joseph Collins the Institute for Food and Development Policy, an organization 
here to research and educate on the root causes of hunger and related societal 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
And now she has produced a new book, "Rediscovering America's Values" 
(Ballantine), which is written in dialogue format about "freedom, fairness and 
democracy." Using it as an organizing tool, she and the institute are about to 
participate in an ambitious five-year national effort called Project Public 
Life. Some of Lappe's favorite words are attached to this project: democracy, 
citizen action, public decision making, community, commonwealth, participation, 
empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
"Thinking big," she calls it. 
</P>
<P>
If mung-bean recipes do not seem on an obvious track with "democracy," they do 
to Frankie Lappe. 
</P>
<P>
"We have hunger in the United States," she exclaims. "How can we say we're a 
democracy?" 
</P>
<P>
She is an alumna of the think-globally-act-locally school of political action; 
a person who believes that if you would change the world, you must first change 
yourself; thus a change in life style, such as reducing one's meat consumption, 
Lappe reasons, is a personal first step for anyone interested in eradicating 
hunger at home and worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
And, having spent more than 20 years figuring out such connections, she has 
decided she knows how to fix what is out of whack that allows hunger in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
Starting from "Diet's" central message -- that meat production wastes grain (it 
takes 16 pounds to produce a pound of beef), wastes water and land and, she has 
now concluded, destroys land and water supplies -- Lappe says that the solution 
for putting an end to hunger and poverty is economic and political. It can be 
simply stated, but it is not exactly a quick fix: redistribute wealth and 
power. 
</P>
<P>
That may sound radical to some; to her it is plain old Fourth-of-July 
solid-citizen democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"In shorthand, we're talking about democracy as a broad concept of 
accountability," she said recently of Project Public Life. "We have to take 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
A former community organizer who retreated from action when she decided her 
need to understand the root causes of society's problems had reached a critical 
point, Lappe says of the project: "This is where my life has come full circle. 
It's one thing to stand at a podium telling people that to change anything, you 
have to believe you can change it. . . . It's time now to practice what I've 
been preaching, to step out from behind the podium and try to organize a 
national coalition. I've never tried it before in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Frankie Lappe, as she is called by most who know her, is a calmly busy woman 
with a cheerful, bright-eyed face and soft-spoken manner. Slender and lithe, 
she can move quickly without seeming rushed or impatient, and manage to talk, 
listen and connect while on the run. 
</P>
<P>
That was how she was during a recent encounter that started at the institute, 
continued with a walk to the nearest BART station, a ride to Oakland, a stop at 
the delicatessen, a walk through her neighborhood of tree-lined streets and 
modest homes until she finally reached her back yard, there to catch the late 
afternoon sun, eat a piece of pizza as a substitute for the lunch she skipped, 
and talk about her life and her work. 
</P>
<P>
She lives in a small, pleasant house with her husband of four years, Baird 
Callicott, and her two children, Anthony and Anna, from her first marriage. 
Anthony will go to New York University in the fall; Anna is in high school. 
Lappe was, she said, married for 10 years and single for 10, before marrying 
Callicott, a childhood friend from church camp. They caught up with each other 
after 25 years, and now have a commuter marriage. He teaches environmental 
ethics at the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vegetarian Kitchen 
</P>
<P>
When they are together, she said, it is her husband who does the cooking in 
their inviting, well-stocked vegetarian kitchen. That, said the world-famous 
vegetarian who sometimes refers to herself as "the Julia Child of the soybean 
circuit," is how they have divided up the work in the household. 
</P>
<P>
Although not a purist, Lappe said it has been so long since meat has been in 
her diet that she finds "the thought of eating flesh repulsive." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, she said, she is not the sort to make a great performance of 
picking the pieces of ham out of an omelet: "That is precisely the way not to 
convert people." 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, she does eat eggs. She respects vegetarians who come to their 
practice out of ethical beliefs but, she said, she has no moral stand that 
dictates never eating animal flesh. In fact, she says, eating meat as a 
supplement to grain is how the diet of humans evolved and it may be more 
feasible in some places now (such as rural or tribal communities) than a strict 
vegetarian diet. 
</P>
<P>
In general, a plant-centered diet, with meat contributing to it -- or not eaten 
at all -- is "consistent with what our bodies need as protein" as opposed to a 
16-ounce hunk of meat, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides," she said, "my husband is such a great cook, I've come to realize 
that the plant world is really where the joys of taste are." 
</P>
<P>
Lappe is on the road a lot, to visit her husband in Wisconsin, to raise funds 
for the institute, to speak. (Her speaking fees go to the institute.) And with 
the book out and the project beginning, she said, the pace has picked up. 
</P>
<P>
She had been on the East Coast, and had come home over the weekend to rest, to 
make a quick trip to her office at the institute, and to finish a "concept 
paper" for an upcoming meeting in Minnesota. She was due to leave for 
Minneapolis the following day for what would be the first organizing meeting of 
Project Public Life, a joint undertaking of the institute and the University of 
Minnesota's Hubert Humphrey Institute for Public Affairs. Next stop, 
commencement exercises at Kenyon College in Ohio where she was to receive an 
honorary degree, and then on to New York for more networking and fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
To her it is all connected, and a conversation with Lappe moves easily back and 
forth from the personal to the political, public and private, abstract and 
concrete -- the same odd mix that "Diet" contains. 
</P>
<P>
Lappe, now 45, grew up in the '50s in Ft. Worth, Tex., in a closely knit family 
that consisted of her, her brother and parents, both of whom were founders of 
that city's First Unitarian Church. 
</P>
<P>
It was a household where the talk at the kitchen table was about how to make 
the world better. So when Lappe speaks about saving the world, she sounds 
neither self-conscious nor boastful. Of course she wants to save the world. 
Doesn't everyone? 
</P>
<P>
"It was a politically argumentative family. My parents were about as critical 
of society as I could imagine anyone being. Their basic attitude was that the 
work left to be done by us caring people was to clean up the residual problems, 
like racism, but that everything was basically in place." 
</P>
<P>
Such assumptions did not withstand the test of the Vietnam War for Lappe. By 
then, she was at Earlham, a small Quaker college in Indiana. Her parents 
supported the war, trusting that the government, with privileged information, 
was making the right decisions. Troubled, she read everything and concluded 
differently: She was being lied to. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like my whole world had collapsed," she said of the war's effect on 
her. "I was almost in shock." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Desperate and Driven 
</P>
<P>
She thought at first of going to Vietnam and doing "reparations work" but soon 
decided she had best stay home "and make my country live up to its ideals." 
</P>
<P>
Feeling desperate and driven, she trained as a community organizer and worked 
in Philadelphia in the early days of the welfare-rights movement, she said, 
then moved on to graduate school in social work at Berkeley, becoming, "if 
anything, even more desperate." 
</P>
<P>
Unable to see how anything she was doing related to the root problems of 
poverty, she dropped out of graduate school and made a private vow "not to do 
anything more to save the world until I understood." 
</P>
<P>
She had first to figure out what the questions were. 
</P>
<P>
She read, audited courses and for the first time in her life, she says, she 
listened. Having chosen food as her entry point, and "following my nose," 
letting one discovery lead her to the next, she eventually arrived at her 
one-page handout. 
</P>
<P>
She was terrified when Ballantine Books published "Diet." She said: "What I 
said seemed so obvious, I figured it must be wrong or everyone would be saying 
it. But so many agreed, it was like I was the little boy who said, 'The emperor 
has no clothes.' " 
</P>
<P>
It made her trust her common sense, she said. "Formal training (she had none in 
agriculture, economics or public policy) narrows our ability to ask the right 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
However, involved with her two babies and not sure what to do next, she did 
little until 1974 when she went as an observer to the World Food Conference in 
Rome. "The experts were drawing up the blueprints to end world hunger," and 
Lappe found herself still mystified by them and looking for leadership. She 
found herself the center of media attention and it made her realize the book's 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
"I came back feeling like Superwoman. I had to take my own work more 
seriously." The experts still were not asking basic enough questions, she 
thought, and she decided to rewrite her book, making the political message 
stronger and more emphatic. The new edition came out in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Analysis of Hunger 
</P>
<P>
At about this time, she met Joseph Collins, who had studied the political and 
economic causes of hunger and was attached to the Institute for Policy Studies 
in Washington. They were thinking along similar lines and decided to write a 
book together. "Food First" came out in 1977, and by then the two had decided 
to found an institute "to provide an ongoing analysis of hunger," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our analysis and purpose has always been popular education," she said of the 
institute. "We're not making policy statements to send to Washington. We're 
directly reaching out to the broadest lay audience. . . . People need an 
overall framework so they can see the importance of their own actions, that 
problems are solvable, to see why something is important and how it contributes 
to something bigger." 
</P>
<P>
The institute's concept of "something bigger" is diverse. Lappe describes 
hunger as a measuring rod of political and economic systems, but says, 
"whatever you choose as your starting point, you have to address the structures 
of power." Thus the institute's publications, research materials and outreach 
work include analyses of foreign aid, the World Bank, the international debt, 
military support of Third World governments, pesticides, population studies. 
</P>
<P>
Lappe and the institute do not say there is no population problem; but they 
reject the notion that overpopulation is causing hunger. They are commonly 
misunderstood or misquoted on that, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a Jehovah's Witness come to my door once and start quoting Frances Moore 
Lappe to me as proof that God has provided for (all of) us. I can't remember, 
but I think I introduced myself to her," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the effect of the institute to date, she said: "Our biggest single success 
is that we have helped shift the ground of the debate (about hunger) to one of 
human responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
However, as the decade of the '80s progressed, Lappe said, it became apparent 
she and the institute needed to take a step further. When she spoke to groups, 
people wanted leadership from her. They were asking, "What do we do? What does 
it mean?" 
</P>
<P>
"As we approach the end of the century, it is less useful just to point out the 
problem," she said. "I spent the first part of my life figuring out the 
questions and building a framework. Now it's time to work out the solutions to 
what private and public life should be about." 
</P>
<P>
She is concerned, she said, that in recent years the right wing has 
"monopolized the language" and narrowly defined what is morality, in the 
process shifting public discourse and attention away from public values to 
private ones. 
</P>
<P>
"Progressives have been profoundly misunderstood. They're accused of being more 
concerned about freedom than justice. I want to make it clear that a fair 
society is a freer society. I want to get out of a freedom-versus-justice 
trade-off." 
</P>
<P>
Project Public Life aims to do something about it, she said: Return public 
values to the proper domain of public discourse. 
</P>
<P>
It sounds a little vague when she tries to pin it down and that concerns her 
because she means it to be practical, pragmatic, specific. It will involve town 
meetings, classroom discussions, community organizing and, she hopes, a 
television series. When she talks of democracy in action, she envisions, she 
said, people concerning themselves with campaign financing and the role of 
political advisory committees, with approaching "toxic waste as a problem of 
democratic failure." 
</P>
<P>
She doesn't stop there. Should corporations be accountable only to their boards 
or to their communities? Should employees be represented on boards? All, she 
said, are the proper domain of the citizens. 
</P>
<P>
To many, the project will sound impossibly idealistic or dangerously radical. 
Lappe herself seems constitutionally incapable of seeing it in such a light. To 
her this is clearly the kitchen table, practical and positive, solid-citizen 
stuff of her childhood and it fires her. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a concept of values based on social change. We've got to get beyond 
defending or not defending capitalism. It's democracy as an unending process. . 
. . It's the notion of the unfinished society consciously realizing itself. 
We've gotten away from it." 
</P>
<P>
A humorous poster hangs over the sink in her kitchen, a '60s relic of 
radicalism, rebellion and idealism, a message that is not quite in sync with 
her constructive approach to the world's ills:: "When you're mashin' your 
organic raisins, remember, you still gotta smash the state." 
</P>
<P>
When a visitor asked about it, Lappe distanced herself from it, saying it had 
been a gift from a friend in the '60s who had found it amusing. She did not 
want it publicized and protested, "I don't want to come off sounding like a 
revolutionary."

ON HOT CAPITAL SCENE, WHO STILL SIZZLES? NANCY REAGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trying out her new persona as author, former First Lady Nancy Reagan returned 
to the capital over the weekend for the first time since her husband left 
office in January and promptly proved to be the town's hottest celebrity 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Book sellers and book publishers, who normally are relatively star-jaded, 
flocked to a reception at the Library of Congress Saturday night, hoping for a 
glimpse of Mrs. Reagan, or better yet, one of her notoriously genteel 
handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Random House, which in October will publish Mrs. Reagan's 
memoir, "My Turn," said 615 people sent replies for this most-coveted party of 
the four-day, Washington convention of the American Booksellers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But closer to 900 people queued up for a receiving line that snaked around the 
Library's majestic mezzanine level. A caterer, frantically trying to keep 
tables filled with grilled eggplant and tiny rolls stuffed with Peking duck, 
said the crowd was eating as if it were twice that number. 
</P>
<P>
While Mrs. Reagan dutifully pumped hands and exchanged cheery small talk, her 
co-author, Bill Novak, described the travails of collaborating with a "very, 
very private lady" like Nancy Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
"Nancy Reagan is a person who is used to being very private, and who worked 
very hard to be as candid as possible in this book," said Novak, who has been 
the co-author of books with former House Speaker Tip O'Neill, Chrysler Chairman 
Lee Iacocca and Mayflower Madam Sydney Biddle Barrows, among others. Novak 
refused to compare Mrs. Reagan with any of his earlier subjects, demurring: 
"Each one is difficult in their own way. Each person is their own universe." 
</P>
<P>
Nor would he discuss his own political leanings or his views about the Reagans 
before he began this project. 
</P>
<P>
When Random House Publisher Joni Evans first telephoned to propose that he take 
on the book, Novak said he checked with his wife, Linda, to see how she felt 
about it. "She didn't miss a beat," Novak said. "She said, 'Just say yes.' " 
</P>
<P>
Novak said that "roughly a year ago," he began meeting regularly with Mrs. 
Reagan, traveling to the White House as often as once a week to conduct 
interviews with her and the President. But he added that much of the material 
came also from the extensive diaries Mrs. Reagan kept during her years in the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
The book contains no "overriding shocker," Novak said, "so much as intimate 
details of what it is like to live in the White House." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he promised that "My Turn" would be "a very emotionally rich 
book" with surprises about Mrs. Reagan's White House tenure, as well as her 
relationships with her family and others in her immediate circle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Generous First-Run Printing 
</P>
<P>
For Random House, the surprises are expected to translate into big sales. The 
publisher has scheduled a 350,000-copy first-run printing of "My Turn," a 
figure considered generous by industry standards. 
</P>
<P>
But Mrs. Reagan's maiden literary effort was only one of a score of "highly 
commercial" fall titles that some publishing officials felt accounted for the 
record crowd at this year's ABA convention. 
</P>
<P>
Her fellow big-draw authors for the fall included names such as Erma Bombeck, 
Stephen King and Danielle Steel -- as well as former Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese 
III, and Robert H. Bork, Supreme Court justice manque. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, why else would you go into the Administration except to sell the rights 
when you get out?" columnist Art Buchwald wondered. 
</P>
<P>
In the opinion of longtime Washington-watcher Buchwald, "The Administration is 
only a step toward getting a good literary agent." 
</P>
<P>
With his own book, "Whose Rose Garden Is It, Anyway?" scheduled for fall 
publication by Putnam's, Buchwald playfully lauded the "packaging" of Ronald 
Reagan, now at work on two books about his Presidency. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you realize what a fortune Abe Lincoln could have made?" Buchwald asked. 
"Or Ulysses S. Grant?" Grant, known for his fondness for the grape, "could have 
gone to the Betty Ford Clinic," Buchwald suggested, "and then written about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jim Wright's Misfortune 
</P>
<P>
As for the misfortunes of another recent Washington author, outgoing House 
Speaker Jim Wright, Buchwald offered an easy explanation for the troubles that 
forced Wright to step down from his job. Wright only had problems, Buchwald 
said, "because he was selling wholesale." 
</P>
<P>
At the book sessions, a crowd the size of many small cities roamed a Convention 
Center designed to accommodate, at best, a tiny village. When the air 
conditioning gave out midway through the first day, the atmosphere turned 
particularly oppressive. Washington's infamous summer came early this year, and 
the sticky, 90-plus-degree temperatures outside seemed rapidly to find their 
way inside. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just like the subway," said Dan Weiler, a media consultant in New 
York. "Only the subway is cooler." 
</P>
<P>
Initial estimates placed the count at 20,000 book sellers, publishers, authors, 
literary agents and others connected with the industry. 
</P>
<P>
But working her way through a bruising mob that bore eerie resemblance to a 
fire sale at Tiffany's, one ABA spokeswoman said the weekend's daily attendance 
was probably closer to 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time at an ABA convention, every one had to work his way through 
a metal detector to enter the meeting area. The heightened security was a 
response to death threats by Muslim fundamentalists against Salman Rushdie, 
author of the best-selling "Satanic Verses," and anyone associated with its 
publication or sale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'So Many Lunatics Out There' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind the security one bit. I really like it," said Lori Ames, working 
at the William Morrow booth, just across the aisle from the Penguin display 
space. Penguin, the paperback imprint of Viking, Rushdie's hardcover publisher, 
was among those targeted for threats when the book first came out. "You just 
never know," Ames said. "There are so many lunatics out there." 
</P>
<P>
Stuart Applebaum, Bantam vice president, characteristically found a humorous 
side to the increased security. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, you just have book sellers sniffing out what the bombs will be," 
Applebaum deadpanned. "This time, you have book sellers and trained guard 
dogs." 
</P>
<P>
Conspicuously absent at this year's ABA were the two-person dogs and dancing 
bears that have clogged the halls at earlier conventions. Handouts were 
abandoned, as always, but hype was at a decided minimum. Only one adult in a 
gorilla suit was spotted, and even Spiderman was unaccompanied by any of his 
other comic book cohorts. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seemed that people were rushing around with their noses to the 
grindstone," said Martha Jackson of A Clean, Well Lighted Place for Books in 
Larkspur, Calif. "I think people are working hard." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
500 Uninvited Guests 
</P>
<P>
But after hours, they also were partying hard. Book people may like to read, 
but it also turns out that they love to have fun. Almost 500 uninvited guests 
showed up at Houghton Mifflin's party at the Phillips Collection, for example, 
making vice president Marly Russoff feel "like I was conducting the invasion at 
Normandy" as she warded off crashers at the staid old museum. It looked "like a 
New York nightclub on Friday night, everyone lined up and getting in two by 
two," Russoff said. 
</P>
<P>
But Russoff, too, took the enthusiastic masses as a positive sign for the 
publishing industry. "Business is good, for one thing," she said. "Bookstores 
are selling books. Sales are up, and we're publishing more aggressively than 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
Even as they pushed their way through the throng to inspect displays of new 
books or products, convention goers seemed eager and upbeat, Russoff observed, 
adding: "There's a great sense of optimism this year."

GRACE KELLY BRIDESMAIDS: REAL LIFE FOLLOWS FAIRY-TALE WEDDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the wedding to end all weddings, and the media event to end all media 
events: the marriage in 1956 of American movie star-glamour queen Grace Kelly 
to the dashing Prince Rainier of Monaco. 
</P>
<P>
Caught up in this fast-lane fairy tale were six young women chosen to be Grace 
Kelly's bridesmaids. And now one of them has written a book about it, titled 
"The Bridesmaids." 
</P>
<P>
Author Judith Balaban Quine was one of the six who wore a daffodil yellow dress 
the day Kelly married her prince, along with Maree Frisby, Rita Gam, Carolyn 
Scott, Sally Parrish and Bettina Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to write a story of seven women," says Quine during lunch one day at 
Trumps. "From the perspective of women of my generation, we were ill-prepared 
for anything called change. I grew up in that era where once the war was over, 
everything got safe, and everything was going to be comfortable for the rest of 
your life if you did all the right things." 
</P>
<P>
Quine, the daughter of Barney Balaban, former president of Paramount Pictures, 
led the glamorous life in Manhattan in the '50s that included dates with 
Montgomery Clift and a brief engagement to Merv Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kelly Came to Quine's Wedding 
</P>
<P>
She became the young bride of Kelly's agent, Jay Kanter, the two women meeting 
on Quine's wedding day. They were Gracie and Judybird to one another, 
maintaining a friendship that endured until Kelly's death in 1982 from a car 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the book came to Quine in the summer of 1978, while she was in 
Monaco attending Princess Caroline's wedding. Family and professional 
obligations kept her from pursuing it until three years ago, although she says 
Kelly thoroughly endorsed the idea from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
She interviewed all the bridesmaids and other key players, even tracking down 
Carolyn Scott Reybold, whom she found living in a New York City women's 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Of that experience Quine says, "I think the notion of it was mystifying and 
perhaps scary. But the label of it meant nothing. She has her health and she is 
an incredibly spiritual person." 
</P>
<P>
The book is hardly a "Gracie Dearest" account of the star/princess, although 
readers are privy to such observations as, "Her maverick sense of adventure 
seemed all but suppressed, though we could still hear its wings fluttering 
against the walls, yearning to escape" as the '70s wore on. 
</P>
<P>
"You know something?" Quine says, her voice barely rising above the 
restaurant's din, "I don't think people are trashy, so I don't like to trash 
them. I wrote about people I know, which meant I cared for them. I wanted to 
write about what it meant to be alive then, a woman trying to be a wife, a 
mother, a worker, a person and that's not a trashy experience. That's called 
being alive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Story of Their Lives 
</P>
<P>
"The Bridesmaids" is something of a deceptive title; the book is not 
exclusively an account of the wedding. It includes the ensuing years, complete 
with marriages, children and divorces for some among Quine, Kelly and their 
friends, making Quine less a biographer -- or autobiographer -- and more a 
chronicler of an era. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow bridesmaid Bettina Thompson Gray is "very proud" of her friend. "She's a 
very brave girl to have written that, putting her life out there for everyone 
to see," she says, speaking from her home in Dedham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Gray admits that she was "dead set against" the book at first. "I said, 'Judy, 
everybody's written enough. It's so boring, billions of people having gone 
through what we went through.' " 
</P>
<P>
But once she realized that Quine was serious, she relented and cooperated. 
"When I first read the book, one minute I was in tears, the next I was bursting 
out laughing." 
</P>
<P>
The publication of "The Bridesmaids" was recently celebrated at the home of 
film producer John Foreman, a longtime friend of Quine and Kelly's. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrities such as Tom Hulce, Polly Bergen, Vanna White, Valerie Harper and 
Roddy McDowall meandered through the living room and back yard as Quine 
announced that the book is headed for miniseries-land, the rights having just 
been purchased by David Wolper and Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Kanter, one of Quine's daughters, shivered in the evening chill as she 
talked about the book. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard stories growing up, but I didn't realize how my mother's and Grace's 
relationship evolved. I see their lives, and it was always so much fun in the 
beginning. But the realities they came to are much the same as women of our age 
are coming to. There were these two very brave women discussing things and 
allowing changes in their lives that other women might not have at that time." 
</P>
<P>
Said Polly Bergen, another Quine/Kelly contemporary, "Looking back on those 
times, there's a part of you that misses it, and there's a part of you that 
says, 'How could I have been so stupid? How could I have believed in the things 
that I believed in in those years? How could I have allowed myself to be led by 
all of those myths that Prince Charming will be there to take care of you 
forever, and all of those things?' So the concept she writes about, in terms of 
the conditioning that women lived with in those days strike so home to me, and 
so many women." 
</P>
<P>
Quine is married for the third time, to Don Quine (her second marriage was to 
actor Tony Franciosa). The couple founded and ran the Professional Karate Assn. 
Now he is writing a screenplay and she is at work on a novel while embarking on 
a book tour. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stories to Tell 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in a lot of places in my life," she says, "And there are a lot of 
stories I want to tell." 
</P>
<P>
And who would she want to play her in a miniseries? 
</P>
<P>
"God, I don't know," she says. "Thoughts pop in and out of my head. I suppose 
the harder thing is, who will play Grace? I think the important thing is, 
whoever plays her, that they have the essence that was her. 
</P>
<P>
"When Grace died, it was an awful time for her to go. It was just at that time 
that women who have raised children and invested so much time in them and their 
husbands have a whole new beginning. God knows she had done the rest of it so 
magnificently. The notion of Gracie going out and having her time, her own 
healthy sense of self -- she so had it coming."

<P>
ORANGE COUNTY -- HOME OF THE HAPPY AND OPTIMISTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County is a state of mind. 
</P>
<P>
Over its 100-year history, dreams, big plans and fantasy have played a vital 
role in turning this seaside desert by stages into bean fields, citrus groves, 
thriving communities, theme parks, marinas, airports, shopping malls, and 
booming centers of technology. 
</P>
<P>
New arrivals continue to drive median home values to levels that are among the 
highest in the nation. In each of the last three decades, 500,000 new shoppers 
have made the pilgrimage to this swap meet of the American dream. 
</P>
<P>
And, Times Orange County Polls indicate, once they become residents, they 
continue to believe in the dream. 
</P>
<P>
An astonishing 96% of those polled say that they are happy, and one-third go so 
far as to agree that "Living in Orange County is the closest thing to paradise 
in America today." 
</P>
<P>
A majority -- 51% -- say they prefer living in the county to anywhere else. 
Only 3% would rather live in New York City, and a mere four respondents in a 
polling sample of 600 prefer Los Angeles. What's more, the pollsters did not 
find anyone over the age of 35 who wanted to move to Los Angeles County, even 
though about one-half of the adults lived there at one time. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking about a major rejection of not only Los Angeles, but of a past 
life," said Mark Baldassare, whose firm, Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates, 
conducted the poll for The Times on Jan. 13-17. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, together with others taken in previous years, offers a kind of 
statistical portrait of Orange County residents, and the image that emerges on 
Orange County's centennial is not of a conformist community but of one 
attempting to balance competing goals: personal liberty against a safe, 
crime-free environment, a strong national defense against low taxes, and 
effective use of the national political system against a suspicion of 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The polls also indicate that social expectations and values are far more 
complex than the county's reputation as a leading center of conservative 
culture might suggest. What has been true through the county's 100-year history 
still holds today: There is nothing simple or predictable about the response of 
its residents to a host of social issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Abortion Issue 
</P>
<P>
For example, despite their political conservatism and although about one-third 
say they accept a literal interpretation of the Bible, a majority of Orange 
County residents oppose a ban on abortions or on the rental of X-rated 
videotapes. An earlier survey shows that they also tend to be more tolerant of 
homosexual rights than the national average. 
</P>
<P>
In present-day Orange County, shifting values and other signs of profound 
social change do not seem to have produced the widespread sense of dismay or 
disorientation they occasionally did in past generations. 
</P>
<P>
Historians have attributed the appearance of a virulent Ku Klux Klan in the 
1920s and the ultraconservative John Birch Society in the 1960s to the sense of 
social disarray brought on by waves of newcomers and by economic development. 
</P>
<P>
Today, changes in the economic environment are more profound than previously, 
but the public appears to have taken it all in stride. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent Times Orange County Poll, which has a margin of error of plus 
or minus 4%, shows that while there is a keen awareness of persistent problems, 
optimism is endemic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Are Happy 
</P>
<P>
For many, the survey indicates, this may be that rare community where fantasy 
and reality coincide -- 56% of the respondents called themselves "very happy," 
and 40% said they were "somewhat happy," while only 4% said they were "not too 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
When a nationwide survey asked the same questions a year earlier, it found that 
only 34% described themselves as "very happy." 
</P>
<P>
But if Orange County is pleased with itself, it also admits concerns. Asked 
what is the biggest social problem facing youth in the county today, 45% of the 
respondents named "drugs," 18% chose "no sense of values" and 13% said 
"alcohol." No other choice got more than 8%. When the same question was asked 
about social problems facing adults, alcohol moved to first place with 28%, a 
lack of values remained second at 16%, lack of work ethic moved to third at 15% 
and drugs was fourth at 14%. 
</P>
<P>
The Times polls and other evidence do reveal one major area of discontent with 
the county itself -- traffic and growth. The revolution of unbridled growth 
that has marked the very essence of Orange County has been betrayed by traffic 
gridlock and smog. Now the idea of curtailing growth -- and indeed government 
planning of growth, once a dangerous heresy -- is a popular cause. Conservatism 
in Orange County turns out to be highly pragmatic, that which does not work is 
rejected and, as a result, planning is no longer a curse word. 
</P>
<P>
"For the last three years, three out of four residents named traffic and growth 
as the main issues facing the county," Baldassare said, referring to the annual 
survey of the county conducted by UC Irvine. "Everybody agrees that something 
should be done but there is no consensus on who should do it and how to pay for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Cost-Free Miracle 
</P>
<P>
A number of surveys show that most people think car-pooling is a solution but 
most don't want to car-pool. There is no agreement on how to pay for improving 
the freeways. In concept, residents approve of mass transit, but in practice 
use of mass transit has declined, and most respondents say it is not a method 
of commuting that they would use. "What it comes down to is that people are 
hoping for a miracle that won't cost them anything and that will allow them to 
commute the way they always have, which is driving alone in to work," 
Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
In the current survey, those who would prefer to live elsewhere object 
primarily to growth and traffic, and the largest group among those who would 
leave -- 17% -- said they would choose "rural America." 
</P>
<P>
But if they reject the urban environment of major cities, Orange County 
residents are not provincial. In two decades there has been a 600-fold increase 
in companies doing business here, and increasingly workers are transferred 
about by high-tech corporations so that many of those here are newcomers from 
other parts of the world or nation. The county's residents also represent a 
very large concentration of personal wealth, with 40% of families having 
incomes of more than $50,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The newly cosmopolitan nature of the county may account for the complexity and 
contradictions of its political and social views. 
</P>
<P>
The county remains highly conservative in voting patterns but somewhat less so 
in self-identification. When polled, two out of three respondents identified 
themselves as middle of the road (31%) or as somewhat conservative (35%). Only 
10% called themselves very conservative, while 19% said they were somewhat 
liberal and 5% called themselves very liberal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Predictable 
</P>
<P>
And, as polling data indicate, there is nothing "monolithic" or in any other 
way predictable about the views of county residents, including Republicans, on 
the more controversial issues. 
</P>
<P>
Not only are they more tolerant of homosexual rights and more inclined to 
oppose banning abortion than respondents in national polls, but they also are 
less inclined to cut social spending to balance the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
When asked in the 1986 UCI Orange County Annual Survey, "Do you think that 
homosexual relations between consenting adults in the privacy of their home 
should be legal or illegal?" 67% said such activity should be legal and 27% 
said illegal. Nationally, in a Los Angeles Times Poll that same year 53% said 
it should be legal and 35% said illegal. 
</P>
<P>
And even with a conservative government in Washington, county residents appear 
to feel alienated from national governmental power. Although the county voted 
overwhelmingly for the winning candidate in the last three presidential 
elections, those polled in The Times' most recent survey stated by a 5-1 margin 
that the government in Washington responds to the large corporations rather 
than people like themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Even among Republicans, 46% said that the federal government responds most to 
the needs of major corporations and only 15% said it responds to people like 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
There seems to be no strong inclination to want government to set standards of 
individual morality even on issues like pornography and sexual abstinence among 
teenagers. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the moral climate in their community was permissive or strict, 
66% said permissive, and they apparently like it that way -- 69% of those 
polled approved of the community's moral climate. This was a sentiment held 
across the board, from those who classified themselves as liberal to those who 
called themselves conservative. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of abortion does offer a clearer example of a split between 
liberal/moderate and conservative factions. Here, while 60% of all those polled 
opposed a Supreme Court ruling that would ban abortions, 74% of those calling 
themselves liberal opposed such a ban and 65% of the moderates opposed it. But 
even among those calling themselves conservatives, 48% opposed a ban, while 47% 
favored one. 
</P>
<P>
On social spending issues, conservative opinion again does not conform to the 
national stereotype. A solid majority across the ideological spectrum support 
health care for the elderly, and fewer than 3% in any group say they are 
unconcerned about this issue. 
</P>
<P>
The poll also shows that a majority across the ideological spectrum are opposed 
to cutting social and health programs "in an effort to reduce the federal 
deficit." Even among those who call themselves conservatives, 52% oppose cuts 
and only 35% favor them. 
</P>
<P>
Being a conservative in Orange County has nothing to do with denominational 
religious preference; 47% of Jews, 49% of Protestants and 48% of Catholics say 
they are conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
The breakdown only varies with those who say that they would call themselves 
religious fundamentalists. One-third of those polled said they are 
fundamentalists in the sense of "someone who takes the Bible literally on 
issues such as the creation of life." In this group 56% say they are 
conservatives, but even here more than 40% say they are liberal or moderate in 
political orientation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diversity of Views 
</P>
<P>
While references to fundamentalist Christians in the media have tended to imply 
a uniformity of outlook on social issues, this Orange County survey indicates a 
more complex set of views. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a majority -- 52% -- of those who identify themselves as 
fundamentalists do favor a ban on abortions, but a strong minority -- 41% -- 
are opposed to such a ban. And while 45% in this group favor a ban "on the 
rental of adult X-rated movies in home video stores in your community," 47% 
oppose such a ban. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also suggests that political conservatives in the county are 
rethinking their foreign policy views. It shows that only 23% of conservatives 
and only 8% of liberals regard the Soviet Union as the "biggest threat to 
America's future." At least 30% of conservatives, moderates and liberals alike 
name the Third World as the main threat and at least 20% in each group name 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"We're witnessing the emergence of a new type of conservative in Orange 
County," Baldassare said, "someone who is young and affluent, sophisticated on 
social issues and traditional on economic ones." 
</P>
<P>
Times researcher Nina Green also contributed to this report.

O.C. FAMILY KEEPS VIGIL FOR STUDENT IN BEIJING

<TEXT>
<P>
Janette Fletcher of San Clemente is proud her son, Adam, is studying abroad. On 
Sunday, however, she was wishing it wasn't Chinese culture -- in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Fletcher, 23, is with two dozen other California college students at the 
vortex of a revolution in the world's most populous country. And as of Sunday 
morning, all the single mother knew was that the second of her four children 
was said to be accounted for and hiding in a dormitory at Beijing University, 
which was surrounded by troops. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst part was, I was watching the news and (ABC News anchor) Tom Brokaw 
came on, and he said that the army was going to invade the university, and that 
the foreign students were hiding under the bed, and the Chinese students were 
making Molotov cocktails, presumably to lob at the soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
"And that," she said, "is when I fell apart." 
</P>
<P>
That was around 9 a.m. She called the American Red Cross and said she was told 
that she could only get information if her son was a serviceman in China. She 
called the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles and never got an answer. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, about noon Sunday, Fletcher reached an administrator of UC Santa 
Barbara's Education Abroad program whose home number happened to be listed in 
the phone book. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Blackmore, the program's associate director, told her that all 22 
students who traveled from University of California schools to China were 
unharmed and accounted for and in the company of a Prof. Chen, the Chinese 
director of the program at Beijing University. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmore could not be reached later Sunday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Chen, who lives in a guest house on the Beijing campus, talked to program 
officials Saturday night and said the students were hiding in one of the dorms, 
according to Fletcher. 
</P>
<P>
"He said they would get them out, and if they didn't have the money to get 
home, they could charge (the traveling expenses) to the professor's credit 
card," Fletcher said. "At that time, they were surrounded by the Chinese army 
at the university." 
</P>
<P>
The program abroad began in September and was not to end for a few more weeks 
but has officially ended now, Fletcher said. She said Blackmore told her that 
"as soon as it's safe they will be getting them out one way or another." For 
now, however, Fletcher's only link to her son is a television screen in the 
living room of her San Clemente home, where the Fletcher family sits riveted 
around the clock, flipping channels for developments in the student revolt for 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher, 51, a secretary for the Southern California Edison Co., received a 
letter from Adam on Friday. It was dated May 22. For the first time the young 
man, whose fascination with China started with his first job at a Chinese 
restaurant, said he was looking forward to coming home. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll just tell you that the feeling is pretty intense here, and everybody is 
getting into the act," Adam wrote of the atmosphere in Beijing before troops 
began firing on protesters over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"It just shows that when people act together they can get almost anything done, 
even in China, where governments have traditionally ruled with an iron grip. 
Lately, I've been doing pretty good. It's not easy when everybody's not going 
to class (foreigners still are), and everybody is marching." 
</P>
<P>
A native of Paisley, Scotland, a town on the west coast near Glasgow, Janette 
Fletcher traveled alone at age 19 to the United States, where all but her 
oldest child was born. Their father is an American, though Fletcher alone has 
raised them: Bill, 26, an engineer living in Hawaii; Adam; Mark, 21, a 
construction worker; and Kathleen, 18, a senior at San Clemente High School and 
part-time waitress. The youngest two still live at home. 
</P>
<P>
All four of her children have at least a bit of wanderlust, Fletcher said, but 
Adam Fletcher has always seemed "the most single-minded about it." 
</P>
<P>
From the time he got his first job, busing dishes at the Eastern Winds 
restaurant in San Clemente, Adam Fletcher was fascinated by China. 
</P>
<P>
He stayed for hours after the restaurant closed, talking with the Chinese 
waiters about their homeland. One of them arranged for Adam to stay in his 
family's home in Taiwan, and he ended up traveling around the country for six 
months and teaching English. Then 19, he learned to write and speak Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher remembers talking to Adam about visiting China someday herself. With 
some amusement, she recalled Sunday that her son had pointed out that, "It's an 
intriguing place, but you don't go to China for fun." 
</P>
<P>
Of her son's college degree -- he is majoring in both Chinese and economics and 
has discussed working in the foreign service or for an American company in 
China -- Fletcher said he is certainly earning it. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say he's getting the education of his life. It's something he will 
never forget. He is seeing it from start to finish."

DEVOTED GRUNION HUNTERS GET GRABBY WHEN SLIPPERY FISH START SPAWNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Lifeguard Ray Graver says he will never forget the first time he saw them. It 
was after midnight on the beach near the Newport Pier. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a big wave, someone switched on a flashlight and suddenly there were 
hundreds and hundreds of grunion. The beach was covered with tiny silver fish," 
recalled Graver, now a lieutenant with the Newport Beach Marine Safety 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
To the uninitiated, first-time grunion hunting can be wet and wild. Because 
grunion stalkers by law can only use their hands to nab the candy bar-size fish 
as they wash ashore, the hunters usually wind up soggy from being sprayed by 
the waves. 
</P>
<P>
But grunion enthusiasts say the spoils of a successful hunt are tasty. That's 
why each year about this time, those with an appetite for the fish gear up for 
the annual grunion runs, the first of which is expected tonight. 
</P>
<P>
About 10:45, along sandy beaches from Santa Barbara to northern Baja 
California, the first waves of slithery, silver grunion will come ashore during 
high tide. The assault will continue for up to three hours on the wet sand as 
female grunions lay eggs, which the males fertilize. 
</P>
<P>
It is a ritual that will repeat itself for four consecutive nights, beginning a 
half-hour later each successive night. The four-night cycle is played out twice 
a month through August, when the grunion's spawning season ends. The spawning 
runs always follow a full moon, when tides are at their highest. 
</P>
<P>
That's why tonight is the night for Robert Winston of Buena Park. A carpenter 
by day, Winston is a grunion grabber on certain summer nights. His obvious 
thrill for the hunt is typical of others bitten by the grunion bug. "We've been 
waiting a long time," Winston said. "We're going to have some dinner, then 
drink a lot of strong coffee and then pile into my pickup and head for our 
secret spot. If we're lucky, we'll be home by 2 or so with several buckets full 
of breakfast. I can smell those little guys frying right now." 
</P>
<P>
For competitive reasons, Winston declined to disclose the location of his 
grunion hot spot. He did provide one clue though. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sandy beach in Orange County. Good huntin'." 
</P>
<P>
Biologists, lifeguards and experienced grunion trackers say there are at least 
a dozen sure-fire beachheads in the county where grunion gravitate to do their 
thing. Many of the spots are within walking distance of public parking lots and 
streets. And there are plenty of grunion to go around. 
</P>
<P>
Although other marine species have been decimated by man's increasing use -- 
and abuse -- of local coastal waters, the grunion population, by most accounts, 
is healthy. One reason is the species' remarkable reproductive powers. A single 
female, 5 to 7 inches long, can lay up to 3,000 eggs, each the size of a 
pinhead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adult Fish Return to Sea 
</P>
<P>
It takes two, sometimes three males to fertilize the clutch of eggs. After 
that, the adult grunions catch the first wave back to sea, leaving the eggs 
hidden in the sand. Ten to 14 days later, when the full-moon high tides return, 
the eggs are swept into the ocean where they quickly hatch or are eaten by 
predators. 
</P>
<P>
The mortality rate is high, but biologists say the species is in no danger 
because the females are able to produce so many eggs. State fish and game 
officials help greatly in this regard. The spawning season runs from March to 
August, but grunion hunting is prohibited in April and May, the height of the 
mating season. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to give them some peace and quiet," said Paul A. Gregory, a state 
fish and game biologist. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the year, grunion spend their leisure time close to shore in water 
15 to 40 feet deep, feeding on plankton. Their life span is two to three years 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Fishing License Required 
</P>
<P>
Grunion hunters who are 15 or older must have a state fishing license, and the 
slippery fish may be caught only with bare hands. It is illegal to trap the 
fish by digging a hole in the sand or by scooping them with a bucket or shovel. 
</P>
<P>
There is no catch limit, but aficionados advise that you take only what you can 
eat promptly. 
</P>
<P>
"They are best fresh," Gregory said. "People eat them a lot of ways, but the 
best is breaded with flour or cornmeal and fried. If you like anchovies, you'll 
love grunion." 
</P>
<P>
Winston, a strapping 22-year-old who lifts weights to stay "tuned and toned," 
swears by what he calls the grunion's "protein punch." 
</P>
<P>
"After a dozen or so, you feel this surge of energy," he said. "We cook them 
all up, and then put them in salads and even use them as substitutes for bacon 
on our burgers." 
</P>
<P>
Not everybody's palate is aroused at the mention of grunion. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I think they are way overrated," said Rich Clemson of Laguna Beach, 
who prefers watching to catching grunions. "They are bony and flat-tasting. 
Thank goodness you can't order them out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Not Be Served in Restaurants 
</P>
<P>
Because grunion are classified as game animals, they may not be served in 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
So if you want to get a good look at grunions, put on a pair of old jeans, a 
sweat shirt and go to a beach that is relatively flat or near a breakwater or 
pier, which for some reason is where the wave action attracts the female 
grunion. 
</P>
<P>
One hint: Don't point a bright flashlight at the fish. Gregory says they spook 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be patient and let the grunion's scouts wash ashore and check out 
to make sure it's safe," Gregory said. "Once they feel secure, the rest will 
follow. And if they do, it's an amazing sight."

UCI INFECTION RATE IN CESAREANS DOUBLE LEVEL DEEMED ACCEPTABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The infection rate among some laboring mothers at UCI Medical Center is more 
than twice an acceptable rate because of patient overcrowding, the hospital's 
acting chief of obstetrics said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Thomas J. Garite said 30% to 40% of the obstetrical ward's patients who 
have Cesarean sections now end up with an infection. An acceptable infection 
rate would be about 15%. 
</P>
<P>
A hospital committee has taken some measures to control the problem, Garite 
said. But he and several other obstetricians said the ward was so busy, 
treating more than 500 patients a month in a unit designed for 250, that 
overworked staff members don't always have time to maintain rigorous hospital 
standards for cleanliness. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't always maintain sterile technique," said Dr. Joseph Lucci III, an 
obstetrician who is on a fellowship at the medical center. 
</P>
<P>
The complaints came Sunday as a Times reporter and photographer toured the ward 
and heard some of its doctors and nurses describe what happens when a 
university hospital's obstetrics ward, designed to offer state-of-the-art care, 
becomes inundated with more patients than it can handle. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to rising infection rates, frustrated doctors and nurses complained 
that fetal monitors, which signal if a baby is in distress, are not always 
available and that patients often go through labor in hallways, where no oxygen 
units are on hand. Staff members are so overloaded with patients, they said, 
that they are not able to closely watch each woman. 
</P>
<P>
Also three rooms that function as labor-delivery rooms do not comply with state 
licensing standards for that use, Garite said. "But if they tell us we can't do 
this anymore, then we have to deliver in the hall. It becomes ludicrous after a 
while," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Conditions have become so bad recently, one young doctor said, that she would 
not want to refer private patients there nor would she want to deliver there 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
"The way it is, absolutely not," said obstetrician Jean Marie Costello, a 
second-year resident at the medical center. "We haven't had a baby die in labor 
because somebody couldn't get to them, but I just don't think a woman should 
labor in the hall without a (fetal) monitor, period." 
</P>
<P>
Saying overcrowding has made conditions on the ward "unsafe," Garite and Mary 
A. Piccione, the hospital's executive director, warned other county hospitals 
on Friday that the medical center would begin turning away women in "active 
labor" when both its emergency room and obstetrics unit are full. Active labor 
occurs when a woman has regular contractions and dilation of the cervix. The 
only exception to the new policy would be women who have received prenatal care 
at UCI Medical Center, who would receive priority admission, according to the 
new policy. 
</P>
<P>
Starting Friday night, when the medical center first notified area hospitals it 
had reached "obstetrical diversion" status, medical center security guards were 
to hand out maps and a list of area hospitals to women in labor. But Garite 
said he believed that only women who had received prenatal care showed up 
Friday, so all were admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, medical center officials have criticized other hospitals and 
clinics for giving indigent patients maps to their hospital instead of caring 
for these patients themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Poor patients around Orange County regularly come to UCI, in part because the 
493-bed hospital in Orange is a former county hospital and has a reputation for 
treating the poor. 
</P>
<P>
But part of the problem, medical center officials have said, is that other 
local hospitals have recently canceled Medi-Cal contracts, and their patients 
now come to the medical center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bankruptcy Threat 
</P>
<P>
UCI Medical Center officials say they are treating 65% of the county's indigent 
patients -- many of these on the obstetrics unit. These patients are not only 
causing overcrowding at the teaching hospital but may force it into bankruptcy, 
hospital officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
However, at least one administrator at another Orange County hospital was not 
entirely sympathetic to the medical center's decision to turn away women in 
labor. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Stephens, administrator of Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach said he was 
unsure whether the medical center had done all it could to ease the 
overcrowding situation before taking this "drastic action" of turning away 
women in labor. He said he was uncertain whether the action was legal. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens also criticized state officials and Gov. George Deukmejian for failing 
to take action on improving Medi-Cal reimbursements to hospitals. He also 
blamed county supervisors for a lack of leadership in providing health care for 
the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"Something more logical has to be done than just greeting patients at the door 
with (a map) telling them to go elsewhere. As health-care providers, we 
certainly have an obligation to patients," Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
But rather than unilaterally turning women in labor away, Stephens said he 
believed that the medical center should petition the Hospital Council of 
Southern California to bring other hospitals together. "I understand UCIMC's 
problems," he said, "but as providers, we certainly have an obligation of care 
to the patients instead of telling them to go elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sunday began as an atypically quiet day on UCI Medical Center's 
obstetrics ward. 
</P>
<P>
As fetal monitors beeped in the background, Garite donned a yellow medical gown 
and showed visitors his unit's three delivery rooms and 14 other beds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Six Women in Labor 
</P>
<P>
At midday, only six women were in labor when lately there have been as many as 
25 at once. 
</P>
<P>
But if most of the sparsely decorated rooms were empty now, Garite said he 
doubted that they would stay that way. "All you have to do is wait and it picks 
up," the 45-year-old obstetrician said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, he flipped through a thick patient registry that showed each 
day's census. 
</P>
<P>
In the first four days of June, 79 women delivered babies, Garite said, "so 
we're cooking at about a 600 (patient-a-month) pace if we keep this up." 
</P>
<P>
Conditions have become so difficult that Garite, an expert on fetal monitoring 
who would like to be named the permanent chairman of obstetrics and gynecology, 
has also been "exploring other alternatives" -- although, he added quickly, he 
would like to stay on at the medical center. 
</P>
<P>
Garite was sympathetic toward his overworked staff and to patients who were 
sometimes "stuffed" together in a room. 
</P>
<P>
Garite's doctors and nurses agreed with him that the situation had become 
unusually difficult -- stressful for the staff, sometimes "unsafe" for 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dr. Lucci: "There are days when I put my name on a chart and I feel bad. 
I'm not implying any malpractice, but for a patient who had to wait several 
hours (to be taken care of), I do occasionally feel almost angry or upset." 
</P>
<P>
Added nurse Carol Patillo: "You give the best care. I think I give quality care 
to my patients. I'm the one who's stressed out about it. I have to work harder, 
run further" between laboring women. 
</P>
<P>
Like some of the other nurses and doctors, Patillo was also concerned about the 
women in active labor who will now be turned away when the medical center's 
unit is full. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too bad we had to resort to that," Patillo said. "If she comes here, she 
could deliver in the parking lot. Who knows if she is going to find her way to 
the next hospital?"

SERVING SUSHI AT BASEBALL GAMES? SAY IT AIN'T SO, JOE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SECTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There has been considerable hand-wringing in recent years about America losing 
its competitive edge to the Japanese. We invent it, they make it. Cars, TVs, 
VCRs, computer chips, farm equipment, high-tech gizmos of all sorts. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese are even gobbling up huge chunks of swank real estate, movie 
studios and other symbols of Americana. 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe all that was inevitable, interest rates, labor costs, and 
free-market competition being what they are. But its time to take a stand. 
They're threatening to horn in on something that strikes at the very heart of 
our culture. We're talking social significance. We're talking moral outrage. 
We're talking baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball may be the only hallowed American institution untouched by Japanese 
influence, the only one they've copied and still not been able to beat us at. 
In fact, its even good for the balance of trade. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, Japanese teams import a few dozen nearsighted sluggers and 
sore-armed pitchers, the real meatballs of the national pastime. No longer 
terrorized by the likes of a Roger Clemens on the mound or Dave Winfield at the 
plate, even the American rejects start banging and bopping the ball like 
all-stars and ship back a few million dollars apiece for their troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Now this last vestige of American dominance may be crumbling. Japanese 
influence is starting to trickle into major league stadiums. This season for 
the first time ever, they're selling sushi -- that's right, those dainty little 
globs of raw squid, grouper, shark, fish eggs and what have you -- at the old 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
Think about it. You're sitting in the grandstand on a sweltering summer day. 
It's the bottom of the ninth, a tense, scoreless pitcher's duel on the field, 
and that empty, gnawing feeling rumbles up from the pit of your stomach. You 
turn to your buddy in the next seat and say, "Gee, you know what would really 
hit the spot at a time like this? An ice cold brew and a hunk of eel, that's 
what." 
</P>
<P>
Ridiculous, right? Well, the San Diego Padres have been selling crab rolls 
along with the peanuts, popcorn and Cracker Jack ever since opening day this 
season. And fans have actually been snapping them up. 
</P>
<P>
What's worse, the Angels are slated to be next. Ed Elias, the general manager 
of the catering firm that runs concession stands at the Big A, says he hopes to 
offer sushi later this season or early in 1990. If that sounds unpatriotic, get 
a load of this: The sushi shack is going to go in where an ice cream parlor now 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
Why would any red-blooded fan nibble on slimy, uncooked seaweed at the ballpark 
when they could choose from a virtual cornucopia of all-American favorites to 
munch on, dishes like nachos, tostadas and bratwurst? "Why do they eat baked 
potatoes, fish and chips or cinnamon rolls at a ballpark?" asked Elias, 
rhetorically. "I think the fans will eat about anything you offer them. We're 
even going to build a pasta house." 
</P>
<P>
Just because they'll eat it, Ed, doesn't mean you have to give it to them. I'm 
all for change, innovation and variety, but some things are sacred. With domed 
stadiums, artificial turf, designated hitters and mascots parading around the 
park in chicken costumes, hasn't the game already been perverted enough? 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Abner Doubleday kicked dirt on his first umpire, generations of 
American youth have been raised to believe that a balanced ballpark diet meant 
a hot dog in one hand, a beer in the other and maybe a bag of peanuts on their 
lap. But these days, Angel fans are already munching on wilted seafood salads 
and sipping on sweet frozen daiquiris. No wonder snobby Easterners resisted 
letting the game move West for all those years. 
</P>
<P>
If fans here want the privilege of watching Big League games, the least they 
could do is eat like Big Leaguers. You think Joe DiMaggio or Babe Ruth ever 
slurped up a plate of raw mackerel on rice? 
</P>
<P>
No, the Babe had an appetite and thirst that was legendary. When the Yankees 
played in Chicago, for example, he would sometimes duck out between innings to 
McCuddy's Tavern across the street from the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
And you can bet it wasn't to order a watercress sandwich and a white wine 
spritzer.

MOTORIST SNATCHES SQUAD CAR, DRAGS OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 19-year-old man pulled over for making an illegal U-turn jumped into a Buena 
Park policeman's patrol car and drove off as the officer wrestled for control 
of the steering wheel and was dragged through a market parking area, 
authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The officer suffered a broken collarbone and cuts that required stitches on his 
elbow and head. The suspect was spotted in the marked squad car half an hour 
later in Orange and, after a 20-minute chase, was captured. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officer Recuperating at Home 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park Police Lt. Tony Kelly said the officer had been hospitalized but was 
recuperating at home Sunday. Kelly would not identify the officer because the 
official press release did not and because "there might be some embarrassment 
to the poor kid. He's injured and kind of sitting at home." 
</P>
<P>
Adolph Denny Chavez, 19, of Buena Park was arrested on suspicion of auto theft, 
assaulting an officer with a deadly weapon and related charges. He was taken to 
Orange County Jail, where he was being held Sunday in lieu of $10,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
"He had no previous record, he was a local kid," Kelly said of Chavez, who told 
police that he is a student. "As for motive, we have no idea why he would 
decide to steal a police car instead of signing a ticket." 
</P>
<P>
The incident began at 8:25 p.m. Saturday, when the Buena Park officer stopped a 
Volkswagen bus in the 7700 block of 8th Street -- a 100-foot-long stretch of 
pavement that Kelly said is better known as the parking area for Jack's Market 
at Beach Boulevard and Manchester Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez and the officer were standing between their vehicles as the ticket was 
written. Kelly said the officer was near the rear of the squad car, the suspect 
closer to the passenger door. Suddenly, Chavez opened the passenger door and 
climbed over the police equipment, Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer ran around to the driver's door as Chavez allegedly started the 
car. They struggled over the wheel, "but Chavez had the upper hand because he 
was behind the wheel in the seat," Kelly said. As the officer tried to hang on, 
the suspect stepped on the gas, briefly dragging the policeman before the 
officer was thrown off the car. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park Police Officer Rich McMillan in a prepared statement said: "For 
unknown reasons" the motorist "attacked and overpowered the officer and fled in 
the marked Buena Park police unit." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Description of Suspect and Car Broadcast 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park police broadcast a description of the suspect and car over 
countywide police radio channels. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty minutes later in Orange, police spotted the patrol car traveling east on 
Chapman Avenue, McMillan stated. Orange police followed it onto Santiago Canyon 
Road, and Orange County Sheriff's Department deputies joined the pursuit. 
Chavez was arrested without trouble near El Toro Road and Muirlands Boulevard 
in El Toro, police said.

POSTSCRIPT: STILL REELING, DEMOCRATS FACE CONFLICT WITHIN LEADERS' RANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA LUTHER, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year was a tough one for county Democrats, even tougher than most in a 
county where a Democrat can sometimes feel like Sisyphus eternally rolling his 
stone up the hill in Hades. 
</P>
<P>
It was, of course, expected that Democratic presidential candidate Michael S. 
Dukakis would lose in the overwhelmingly Republican county. But many had hoped 
that he would lose by a small enough margin to gain a statewide victory, when 
balanced against heavily Democratic areas of the state. Bush, however, won the 
county by more than 300,000 votes as part of a national landslide. 
</P>
<P>
But what hurt local Democratic leaders even more was their loss in the 72nd 
Assembly District after a bitter $1.9-million battle. They finally had a 
candidate -- a prosecutor and school board member -- who they thought had all 
the qualities needed to recapture the mid-county legislative district that is 
the only one they had a chance to win. Out of 66,000 votes cast on Election 
Day, however, he fell a tantalizing 867 short of the target. 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder that it's hard to get Democrats motivated. "The party keeps 
pumping itself up for races, and we keep losing," said one county Democratic 
leader who asked not to be identified. "We seem to be moving backward, not 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
Now would seem to be a time of healing for Democrats. But it hasn't been. Party 
leaders have been concerned that two officials who should be pulling together 
have been sniping at each other. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a political soap opera," one Democrat said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tempest in a teapot," another said. "They're both trying to prove what 
hotshots they are." 
</P>
<P>
The two people involved were elected to leadership roles this year: Michael 
Balmages, 42, chairman of the county Democratic Party, and Audrey Redfearn, 58, 
chairwoman of the Democratic Foundation, a support group of $1,000-per-year 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
While there are several other smaller -- some say even petty -- issues 
involved, the main disagreement between the two appears to be over whether the 
foundation can continue its $1,000-per-month support of the party under the new 
restrictions imposed by Proposition 73, the campaign contribution law that 
passed last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Balmages said he has checked with the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission, which said the foundation can legally contribute money to the party 
for operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Redfearn said a legal opinion obtained by the foundation indicated that it 
could not contribute more than $2,500 in the current reporting period, an 
amount it has already reached. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I understand . . . it's not clear yet," she said. "They keep 
reinterpreting the law." 
</P>
<P>
She said she and the board are waiting for a written opinion from the 
commission that would clear the way for further contributions to the party. 
</P>
<P>
"The foundation is committed to supporting the party, but we want to make sure 
we're on good legal ground," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Balmages and Redfearn tried to downplay differences. "I have one style, 
and he has another," Redfearn said. 
</P>
<P>
She described Balmages as "quite flamboyant" and herself as a consensus-seeker. 
"I take my politics very seriously," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Redfearn is an elegant, quiet-spoken, behind-the-scenes worker who has come up 
through the ranks with such mentors as Democratic stalwarts Richard J. O'Neill 
and Howard Adler. Together, they could be called the "old guard." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Balmages, a bearded, one-time trial lawyer-turned-corporate 
attorney, has high energy to the point of being almost swashbuckling. He 
represents the "new guard." 
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the foundation, Redfearn's job is to attract bigger givers to 
the party and provide a place for them to rally around Democratic candidates. 
During the last election, the foundation brought several presidential nominees 
to the county, including Dukakis, Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) and Sen. Albert 
Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.). 
</P>
<P>
Balmages' job is different. He must foster party-building activities, including 
gathering the volunteers needed for voter registration and get-out-the-vote 
efforts. He must also scour the political landscape for Democratic candidates 
to run in legislative and congressional races. That's not easy when Republicans 
dominate by a registration margin of 55.3% to 34.6% and hold every legislative 
and congressional office, except a small piece of a state Senate district in 
northeastern Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish this, Balmages has ideas. He wants to get a mail campaign under 
way to try to reach the county's nearly 400,000 Democrats. He wants to find 
good candidates to challenge the GOP's lock on local offices. He talks about 
such things as the need for a "critical mass" of Democratic support that will 
cause a "chain reaction" in rebuilding the party. 
</P>
<P>
To do that, he needs money. The county Democratic Party was counting on the 
foundation to provide the monthly $1,000 base of support for the party. 
Balmages said he will build a body of contributors to provide the rest of the 
$5,000 a month he believes is needed to put Democrats back on the map. "Orange 
County is a wealthy enough place to support that," Balmages said. 
</P>
<P>
(By comparison, the county GOP has a budget in its off-election years of 
$20,000 to $25,000 a month, which nearly doubles in campaign years.) 
</P>
<P>
Redfearn was not present at a foundation board meeting where Balmages most 
clearly spelled out his problems with her and the foundation. He was variously 
described at this gathering as "confrontational" and "direct." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a trial lawyer by profession," Balmages said afterward. "Trial lawyers are 
confrontational. If they're not, they're not worth a damn." 
</P>
<P>
Balmages is aware that Democrats need to pull together if they ever want to 
compete again in the county. He does not seem to be afraid of dissension as a 
means to that end. "I view my job (as being) to maximize the interests of the 
Democratic Party," Balmages said. "Anything I do with the Democratic Foundation 
is to further that goal. If that is viewed as confrontational and demanding, so 
be it."

THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS: POUNDING POP TO A PULP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pursuit of Happiness is no revolutionary rock band, but it is one worth 
rallying around for listeners who think that a catchy melody and a hammering 
beat is a pop fan's inalienable right. 
</P>
<P>
The strength of the Canadian band's show Saturday night at the Coach House in 
San Juan Capistrano was its ability, time and again, to send a capsule of 
captivating melody into orbit on the shoulders of a booster-rocket instrumental 
surge. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, by overplaying its strength, the band turned it into a flaw. Like space 
launches, those catchy pop blast-offs became a little routine with successful 
repetition, no matter how magnificent they might be when taken individually. It 
would have helped if the Pursuit of Happiness, which plays again Tuesday at 
Bogart's in Long Beach, slowed the pace from time to time, instead of making 
nearly everything hurtle ahead at full thrust. Even a band with the power to 
launch moon shots should occasionally take a hint from that old 
declaration-signer, Ben Franklin, and realize that sometimes you can get 
electrifying results just by flying a kite. 
</P>
<P>
The band's single-mindedness about rocking out led to stretches of sameness 
during the 80-minute set, and the emphasis on muscle led to a sound mix that 
sometimes obscured the shine on the band's harmony-glazed pop hooks. But if the 
Pursuit of Happiness can be criticized for following a formula to excess, it's 
only fair to appreciate how much fun that formula is. 
</P>
<P>
Moe Berg, who sings, writes the band's songs and plays lead guitar, has an 
Everyman rock voice -- a little nasal, a little flat, a little thin. But 
bright, Bangles-quality harmonies from Kris Abbott and Leslie Stanwyck 
cushioned Berg's voice and balanced out a slashing, driving instrumental attack 
that featured Berg's raw but concise guitar solos. If the band fell into 
sameness from song to song, it achieved a nice sense of proportion and 
development within individual tunes. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Berg's lyrics got lost in the din, but they are another strength. 
Essentially, Berg has one subject, summed up by the title of the band's debut 
album, "Love Junk." But he addresses matters of the heart and loins with wit 
and comes at them from shifting perspectives and odd angles, ranging from crude 
to jarring to winningly innocent. 
</P>
<P>
The band interspersed five new songs in a set that included all of "Love Junk," 
plus a jukebox encore of Mountain's "Mississippi Queen," Badfinger's "No Matter 
What," and Elvis Presley's "Little Sister." The new material followed the style 
of "Love Junk" rather than exploring new directions. 
</P>
<P>
The Pursuit of Happiness was happily free from pretensions. Berg, with his 
wire-frame glasses, long stringy hair and high forehead, looks as if he could 
as easily be a computer hacker as a rocker; between songs, he was a friendly 
host who addressed the audience as "folks" and talked wryly about such things 
as old high-school jealousies and his new Three Stooges T-shirt (it featured 
Larry, rather than Berg's namesake, Moe). Even backup singer Stanwyck, the 
band's only source of glamour, was unassuming in her sultry way. Instead of 
dancing like a performer, with video-choreographed steps, she danced with the 
natural movements of a fan caught up in the music pouring from a powerful band. 
</P>
<P>
Middle act Legal Rein may not cast melodic hooks quite as tastily baited as the 
Pursuit of Happiness', but the San Francisco band played a grabbing set that 
displayed an impressive range -- from noisy, spirited bashing a la the 
Replacements to topical folk balladry, anthem rock and an atmospheric, 
strikingly original remake of the Beatles' "Dear Prudence" that was alternately 
crashing and delicate. A band to watch. 
</P>
<P>
One Day's opening set was capably played and well-received, but the local band 
still seems bogged down in musical territory already staked out by R.E.M. and 
the Smithereens. A wider range of feelings might help: while One Day played 
with bite, Alan Dugan's singing had an unvaryingly tremulous quality that 
limited the band.

RAVI SHANKAR AND SON SHUBHO BRING SOUNDS OF CLASSICAL SITAR TO ARTS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Western ears become more accustomed to the largely improvised, slowly 
unfolding classical music of Northern India, appreciating the talents of a 
virtuoso like Ravi Shankar becomes a more sophisticated task. Yet when the 
69-year-old sitarist appeared at the Orange County Performing Arts Center on 
Friday, it wasn't hard to enjoy his polished, expert musicianship with the awe 
and wonder of a child. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied on sitar by his son Shubho -- an Orange County resident -- and on 
tabla by Indian musician Kumar Bose, Shankar relished each sound from the 
smallest intervallic step to the quickest of passages, creating music that was 
surprisingly accessible given the long duration and absence of contrast in each 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
The five members of the ensemble, which also included two droning tambouras (a 
lute-like stringed instrument), sat on the floor between two large ferns while 
candles burned and incense fumed. 
</P>
<P>
Four presentations averaging about 35 minutes apiece used a traditional format 
that Shankar carries on from his late mentor, Allauddin Khan. An opening 
section without meter called the alap introduces the raga -- a predetermined 
set of pitches and melodic motives -- and then develops into a climactic, 
rhythmic section called the gat. 
</P>
<P>
The first two improvisatory sessions utilized traditional ragas. The two 
Shankars often broke off into imitative sections, trading off different motives 
and virtuosic passages. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to his father, the younger Shankar chose to be more daring, often 
vigorously bending pitches while quickly maneuvering up and down the neck of 
his instrument. Bose's contribution on tabla provided tasteful, expert support 
when appropriate and busy, rapid-fire tappings while soloing. 
</P>
<P>
After an intermission, the ensemble improvised on one of Ravi Shankar's 
original ragas called pancam-segara. The pitch materials proved more complex 
than the traditional ragas, creating multifarious combinations and ending with 
a virtuosic tabla solo, undoubtedly borrowed from the jazz or rock music 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
The three-hour evening ended with a shorter, showy performance that seemingly 
pulled out as many virtuosic stops as possible. The audience responded with an 
immediate standing ovation.

ACCOUNTING DIRECTOR OF CARL'S JR. FREED OF CRIMINAL CHARGE OF INSIDER TRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alvin DeShano, the accounting director for the Carl's Jr. hamburger chain, was 
acquitted today of a criminal charge of insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm obviously very happy," DeShano said after U.S. District Judge A. Wallace 
Tashima announced the verdict. "I screwed up and sold at the wrong time -- but 
I definitely did not intend" to violate securities laws. "I think they saw I 
was an honorable man." 
</P>
<P>
DeShano, 55, of Orange was accused of using confidential company information to 
avoid a $7,107 loss on stock of Anaheim-based Carl Karcher Enterprises, which 
runs the Carl's Jr. fast-food chains. 
</P>
<P>
His criminal trial stems from a broader civil suit filed 14 months ago by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission against Carl N. Karcher, chairman and chief 
executive of Karcher Enterprises, 14 Karcher relatives and DeShano. The SEC 
accused the 16 defendants of avoiding market losses of at least $310,000 in 
1984 by selling securities before a dramatic earnings decline was made public. 
</P>
<P>
The civil case is pending against Carl Karcher and six of his relatives, but 
trial has been indefinitely postponed. Six other relatives settled with the SEC 
and agreed to pay fines; Carl Karcher's son, Carl Leo, was judged to have 
violated securities laws, and Carl Karcher's wife was dropped from the civil 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
DeShano, who has worked at Karcher Enterprises for 15 years, was the only one 
who was criminally charged. He remains a defendant in the SEC's civil suit. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors reached their decision after almost two days of deliberations. After the 
verdict was announced, Assistant U.S. Atty. James Sanders said, "The jurors 
deliberated and spent time with the case. . . . We accept their verdict." 
</P>
<P>
DeShano sold his 1,725 shares of Karcher stock Oct. 15, 1984, the first trading 
day after company executives received a preliminary internal report estimating 
that earnings for one month would be as much as $900,000 below earlier 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
When news of the chain's lower earnings became public on Oct. 23, Karcher stock 
plunged $4.125 per share to $17.375. 
</P>
<P>
During five days of testimony, defense lawyer David Wiechert of Irvine 
portrayed DeShano as an unsophisticated investor who never intended to use 
confidential information or defraud investors. He called witnesses who 
testified that DeShano had discussed selling his company stock with two Karcher 
executives before he had any idea about the impending drop in the company's 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
DeShano testified that he sold company stock because he wanted to diversify his 
investments, not because he believed that the price was about to plummet. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Wiech, co-defense counsel, said jurors told her that they believed 
DeShano's testimony during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
"The system worked," Wiechert said. DeShano "is an individual who spent 55 
years as an honest, upstanding citizen. The jurors didn't believe you're going 
to buy someone like that for $7,000."

<P>
The fourth-grader with buzz-cut hair told reporters at a press conference that 
he was not nervous. "It's like flying anywhere," he said, standing on a stool 
to be seen over a podium. 
</P>
<P>
Tony's 17,000-mile journey has been dubbed the "Friendship Flight" because its 
highlight will be delivering about 50,000 letters from American schoolchildren 
to Soviet children. He also hopes to present Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
with a 1,000-foot-long scroll filled with children's signatures. 
</P>
<P>
The nonchalant pilot described his anticipated meeting with the Soviet leader: 
"I'll shake his hand. Then he'll say something. Then I'll show him my scroll." 
</P>
<P>
One Soviet official at the press conference at Martin Aviation called Tony's 
trip "a historical moment." Tony's trip will touch "millions and millions of 
children and open the door for global communication," said Gennady P. 
Alferenko, chairman of the Foundation for Social Inventions of the U.S.S.R., 
who helped arrange the flight. 
</P>
<P>
Tony was expected to land in Salt Lake City this afternoon to end the first leg 
of the trip. With him in the six-seat Cessna 210 Turbo are his parents, Gary 
and Susan, his 10-year-old sister, Alaina, and a representative of the National 
Aeronautics Assn., to verify that Tony pilots the plane the entire distance.

POLISH COMMUNIST PARTY CONCEDES DEFEAT AFTER SOLIDARITY SWEEPS FREE ELECTIONS

The Communist Party conceded defeat today in the country's first free 
parliamentary elections in four decades, saying Solidarity won a landslide and 
top party reformers were voted out of office. 
</P>
<P>
"Solidarity got an overwhelming majority," Communist Party spokesman Jan 
Bisztyga said in a statement on the nationally televised evening news program. 
"The result must be that the opposition must take co-responsibility for the 
state." 
</P>
<P>
The official news agency PAP said Solidarity candidates won up to 80% of the 
vote against government candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the resounding defeat, "We shall not retreat from the road of democracy 
and reforms," Bisztyga said. 
</P>
<P>
He warned that a feeling of excessive triumph and adventurism among Poles 
"might lead to a situation of anarchy in Poland, then democracy and social 
peace will be jeopardized." 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said all 161 Solidarity candidates for 
the Sejm, or lower chamber of Parliament, got more than 50% of the votes to 
qualify for their seats outright, but several running for the Senate missed the 
50% cutoff and will take part in a runoff election June 18. 
</P>
<P>
"Poland is marching on the road of reforms -- in contrast to what has happened 
in China," Onyszkiewicz said, referring to the army massacre of pro-democracy 
demonstrators in Beijing. "I hope force will never be used in Poland to solve 
our internal problems." 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement with Solidarity, the Communist Party was to receive 65% of 
the Sejm. To achieve that, some Communist Party candidates ran unopposed, but 
the party's results indicated that some of them did not get the 50% voter 
approval required to be elected. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear what would happen to any Sejm seats not filled in 
the election. Solidarity argued that they should be left vacant, but the 
government left open the possibility of another election for just those seats. 
</P>
<P>
Jerzy Urban, the government's point man during its repression of Solidarity 
from 1981 until two months ago, got 17.5% of the vote in his bid for the Sejm 
while his rival, Solidarity's Andrzej Lapicki, scored 75%, preliminary figures 
showed. 
</P>
<P>
Prominent Solidarity adviser Jacek Kuron, a frequent target of government 
attacks until recently, got 66% in his race.

Neighbors of the Lopez Canyon Landfill blocked garbage trucks from entering the 
dump today, for the third time this year. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 protesters, who live in Lake View Terrace, Pacoima and Kagel Canyon, 
said they believe that the city-operated landfill is hazardous to their health. 
The Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation denies that the dump is dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Today's protest was aimed at a meeting of the California Waste Management Board 
scheduled for Friday in Los Angeles. At that meeting, board members will review 
the dump's operating permit, which is out of date. 
</P>
<P>
The protest ended after about an hour, when Los Angeles police officers 
threatened to arrest protesters if they did not disperse.

BUSH CALLS ON IRAN FOR RELEASE OF HOSTAGES;

SAYS 'THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO'; 8 DIE IN MOURNING CRUSH

<P>
President Bush today called on the new Iranian government to help release 
American hostages if it wants improved relations with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
At a televised news conference in Washington, Bush was asked about Iran's new 
government following the death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said it is "hard to predict" if there will be change under the leadership 
of Khomeini's appointed successor, President Ali Khamenei. 
</P>
<P>
"I would simply repeat what I said on January 20th," Bush said, referring to 
his inaugural address. "There is a way for a relationship with the United 
States to improve -- and that is for a release of the American hostages." 
</P>
<P>
Nine Americans are believed to be hostages in Lebanon, held by factions 
suspected of close ties with Iran. They include Associated Press correspondent 
Terry Anderson, who has been held the longest, abducted on March 16, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The United States broke ties with Iran after Khomeini came to power in 1979 and 
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran was seized, with 52 Americans held hostage for 444 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he is going to make any new overtures to Iran, Bush said brusquely, 
"They know what they need to do. They have been a terrorist state. As soon as 
we see some movement away from repression and extremism, we will review our 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Millions in Mourning 
</P>
<P>
In Tehran, millions of mourners today flooded into a square where Khomeini's 
body lay, causing a stampede the official news agency said killed eight people 
and injured at least 500. 
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency said in addition to those killed and injured 
in the stampede outside Mosalla Mosque, scores of people were rendered 
unconscious as temperatures soared to 100. 
</P>
<P>
State television showed victims being carried out of the square as crowds 
scrambled to get closer to the air-conditioned cubicle where Khomeini's 
shrouded body lay on a glass-covered bier. 
</P>
<P>
Television cameras zoomed in on a bearded young man cooling mourners with a 
water hose. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini, 86, died Saturday of a heart attack, 12 days after intestinal 
surgery, leaving the country gripped by its worst political crisis since the 
revolution that catapulted the Muslim cleric to power in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Muslims today beat on their breasts and heads in a traditional Shiite sign of 
mourning and screamed "Sorrow, sorrow is this day . . . Khomeini the idol 
smasher is with God today!" 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini's only son, Ahmad, read over Tehran Radio the first pages of his 
father's political testament, which is believed to contain guidelines on how 
the Islamic Republic should be governed. The section broadcast warned against 
U.S. plots and called for unity, but it made no reference to the problem of 
succession.

A man who went on trial today for the 1986 murder of Olof Palme denied that he 
gunned down the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not kill Prime Minister Olof Palme. I did not try to kill Mrs. Palme," 
defendant Carl Gustaf Christer Pettersson told the court. "The shooting was an 
infamous crime that I could never have committed." 
</P>
<P>
Palme was shot in the back from a distance of eight inches Feb. 28, 1986, as he 
walked home from a movie. The gunman escaped down a dark side street. Mrs. 
Palme was slightly wounded by a second bullet. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Magistrate Michael af Geijerstam broke a five-month news blackout on the 
defendant's identity by reading Pettersson's name live on a radio broadcast. 
Under Swedish law his name could not be released until the trial, and he has 
been identified in Swedish media only as "the 42-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
Pettersson has a history of drug and alcohol abuse and a long criminal record.

Iran must withdraw the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death edict against 
author Salman Rushdie before relations between Tehran and London can return to 
normal, Britain said today. 
</P>
<P>
"We shall be looking to Iran to renounce publicly the use or threat of the use 
of terrorism and violence," a Foreign Office spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie has been in hiding under police guard since Khomeini's order last 
February. Iran broke diplomatic ties with Britain last March in the furor that 
followed Khomeini's call on Muslims to kill Rushdie because his novel, "The 
Satanic Verses," blasphemed Islam.

MAJOR BANKS LOWER PRIME RATE TO 11%; 
</P>
<P>
3 CALIF. INSTITUTIONS JOIN IN FOLLOWING LEAD OF CITIBANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Major banks lowered their prime lending rates half a percentage point to 11% 
today, responding to the decline of interest rates on financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based Citibank, the nation's largest bank, was the first to announce 
that it had lowered its prime lending rate. Several other big banks, including 
Chase Manhattan Bank, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., Chemical Bank, Bank of 
America, Security Pacific National Bank and the Bank of California quickly 
followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
Today's decline was the first drop in the major banks' prime rate -- used as a 
base for a variety of other interest rates, including those on consumer loans 
-- since Feb. 2, 1988. On that day, the prime fell 0.25 percentage points to 
8.5%, but then began a climb that ended today. 
</P>
<P>
The latest decline places the prime rate back at the level it reached Feb. 10 
of this year, when it rose to 11% from 10.5%. Two weeks later, on Feb. 24, it 
rose another 0.5 percentage points to 11.5%, and remained at that level until 
today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lost a Lot of Steam' 
</P>
<P>
Economists said today's decline came in response to market interest rate 
trends. 
</P>
<P>
"The banks have finally acknowledged the drop in rates that has occurred in 
recent weeks," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director of Stone &amp; McCarthy 
Research Associates Inc., a money market research firm based in Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve pushed interest rates higher early this year to keep the 
economy from overheating. But rates have fallen recently "primarily because the 
economy has clearly lost a lot of steam," McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 24, the interest rate on the Treasury's 30-year bond was 9.18%, while 
today, the yield was quoted at 8.43%. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy said it is somewhat surprising that the banks decided to act although 
the Fed has not yet eased its stand on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's pretty much a foregone conclusion that the Fed will ease policy," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Doubt Fed Action 
</P>
<P>
But some economists did not agree that the Fed will allow interest rates to 
plunge. 
</P>
<P>
"They have not yet been convinced that the inflation dragon has been tamed," 
said Donald Ratajczk, director of economic forecasting at Georgia State 
University in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The prime rate reflects a bank's costs of borrowing money, including interest 
it pays on customer accounts, short-term certificates of deposit and bonds, and 
as such mirrors rather than forecasts rate trends. 
</P>
<P>
William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., 
said that in addition to the easing in short-term rates, the catalyst for the 
prime cut came Friday with the release of the May unemployment report. 
</P>
<P>
The government said that the overall jobless rate slipped to 5.2% from April's 
5.3%, but non-farm payrolls rose only 101,000, the lowest increase in months 
and far below market forecasts of more than 200,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The report was a further indication of economic weakness," Sullivan said.

Panic selling in reaction to the crackdown in China sent stocks in Hong Kong, 
which reverts to Chinese rule in 1997, plummeting today to their worst loss 
since the worldwide market collapse in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher came under growing pressure today 
to re-examine turning over the British colony. The crackdown on the mainland 
has heightened Hong Kong residents' anxieties over the colony's future. 
</P>
<P>
Officials reported a run on some Chinese banks in Hong Kong -- the world's 
third-largest banking center -- after calls to withdraw funds from the 
institutions to protest the killings. 
</P>
<P>
Some banks said their rate of withdrawal was 30% higher than usual. 
</P>
<P>
The stock exchange lost 100 points in the first minute of trading in its 
morning session, before closing at 2,085.29, down 590.09 points from Friday. 
All major shares suffered losses. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the exchange was flooded with selling orders, many from overseas 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate specialists said property values could fall between 15% and 20% 
unless the situation in China stabilizes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst scenario come to pass," said Paul Varty, an executive of a 
major real estate firm. 
</P>
<P>
Leading British newspapers said China's military crackdown has intensified 
doubt that the British colony will be allowed to uphold civil rights and 
maintain its freewheeling socioeconomic life style under Chinese rule. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said today that work on the agreement to 
turn over the colony has "been put on ice while all these troubles are taking 
place." 
</P>
<P>
"But it's much too soon to conclude that we should set all that to one side, 
because Hong Kong's future is inextricably bound up, geographically and 
historically, with mainland China," he said in a British Broadcasting Corp. 
interview.

The Italian telecommunications equipment maker Italtel today signed an 
agreement with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. for a far-reaching 
partnership in manufacturing and sales of equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, AT&amp;T will acquire 20% of Italtel. In exchange, Italtel's 
parent, the Italian state holding company STET, will take a 20% share of 
AT&amp;T-Network Systems International (ATT-NSI), a joint venture between 
AT&amp;T and Philips NV of the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, AT&amp;T has agreed to make a direct investment of almost $150 
million in Italtel, said an official involved in the deal who requested 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The accord, which was widely expected, was an important victory for AT&amp;T. 
It allows the U.S. giant access to the ripe Italian telecommunications market, 
which is dominated by Italtel, and improves AT&amp;T's position for the 
post-1992 unified European market.

On Nov. 28, 1979, Smith became the first NHL goalie to be credited with scoring 
a goal when he was the last Islanders' player to touch the puck before a 
Colorado player put it into an empty net. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was known for his tough play around the net, amassing 484 penalty minutes 
in 17 seasons.

Ben McDonald, who went 14-3 for Louisiana State this year and began the season 
by pitching 44 2/3 consecutive scoreless innings, was chosen by the Baltimore 
Orioles today as the first pick in the amateur baseball draft. 
</P>
<P>
Pitchers from Saugus (Calif.) High School and Cal State Long Beach were 
included as third and ninth draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
"In college, Ben throws 70% fastballs and challenges all of the hitters," LSU 
Coach Skip Bertman said. "When he gets into pro ball, when he can pitch more, 
use all of his pitches, he'll be even more effective." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, a 6-foot, 7-inch right-hander, could be with the Orioles by the end 
of the season. He has struck out 194 in 148 1/3 innings and has a 2.91 
earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure on Ben has been tremendous," Bertman said. "There was an ESPN 
camera right in the bullpen when he was warming up. He has been hounded for a 
month. He had to disconnect his telephone. That drains you." 
</P>
<P>
Tyler Houston, a strong-armed catcher from Valley High in Las Vegas, was taken 
second by the Atlanta Braves. In 87 at-bats, he hit .563 with 12 homers and 57 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
The Seattle Mariners then took Roger Salkeld, a right-handed pitcher from 
Saugus (Calif.) High School. The 6-foot, 5-inch, 205-pound Salkeld posted a 
10-0 record this year with a 0.65 earned run average. He struck out 140 batters 
in 82 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia, with the fourth pick, took Jeff Jackson, an outfielder from 
Simeon High in Chicago. He hit .493 in 71 at-bats with 12 homers, 51 RBIs and 
30 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
Texas, picking fifth, selected Don Harris, an outfielder from Texas Tech and 
the first big surprise of the draft. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis then took Paul Coleman, an outfielder from Frankston (Tex.) High. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Thomas, a first baseman from Auburn, went to the Chicago White Sox with 
the seventh pick. 
</P>
<P>
"He's strong, with outstanding power and not that bad defensively," White Sox 
scouting director Al Goldis said of Thomas. "He does need to lose weight, 
though." 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Cubs, picking eighth, took Earl Cunningham, an outfielder from 
Lancaster (S.C.) High. Through his first 65 at-bats this season, Cunningham was 
batting .446 with 11 homers and 25 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Kyle Abbott, a left-hander from Cal State Long Beach, was taken by the Angels 
with the ninth pick, and Charles Johnson, a catcher from Westwood High School 
in Ft. Pierce, Fla., was the 10th pick, selected by the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
Only the first round of the three-day draft is made public immediately. Teams 
are fearful that colleges will use the draft as recruiting lists, so they don't 
release the complete list for about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Dodgers had four picks in the first two rounds. In addition to 
their own picks (22nd and 48th), they had the 15th pick from the New York 
Yankees as compensation for Steve Sax and the 37th pick from Cleveland as 
compensation for Jesse Orosco. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees, because of free-agent signings, did not have a first-round pick 
for the fifth consecutive season and the 10th time in 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
Boston, in addition to its own pick (23rd), had San Diego's choice (16th) as 
compensation for Bruce Hurst. Seattle picked third and got Oakland's pick 
(26th) as compensation for Mike Moore.

CHANG, 17, OUSTS LENDL IN STUNNER;

CROWD CHEERS WILDLY AS AMERICAN FIGHTS OFF PAINFUL CRAMPS

Michael Chang, writhing with leg cramps and hardly able to serve, staged a 
sensational rally to upset top-seeded Ivan Lendl 4-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 today 
and reached the quarterfinals of the French Open tennis championships. 
</P>
<P>
In a match of high drama and excitement, the 17-year-old from Placentia brought 
off an improbable victory on Center Court that had the capacity crowd of 14,000 
wildly supporting the underdog. 
</P>
<P>
After playing the whole of the fifth set in pain, Chang fell on his back in 
relief after Lendl double-faulted on match point to end the 4-hour, 38-minute 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
The American, the youngest-ever quarterfinalist in the men's event, was in 
tears as he left the court. 
</P>
<P>
While Chang's comeback was the focus of attention, countryman Jim Courier lost 
a two-set lead and went out of the tournament as the second week began. 
</P>
<P>
The unseeded Courier was beaten 2-6, 3-6, 7-6, 6-2, 7-5 by Andrei Chesnokov of 
the Soviet Union. Courier, 18, had upset No. 5 seed Andre Agassi on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wilander Moves Ahead 
</P>
<P>
With tension all around him, defending champion Mats Wilander of Sweden eased 
into the quarterfinals. Wilander, yet to drop a set in the tournament, hammered 
Lawson Duncan of Asheville, N.C., 7-5, 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
If the quality of the Chang-Lendl match was patchy, the emotion of the occasion 
was super-charged. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl was warned in the first set and penalized a point in the fourth, both 
times for arguing over line calls. Chang also was warned, for taking too much 
time in the fifth game of the final set, when he was in the most pain. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised I was able to hang on so long," Chang said. "When he gave me 
the warning, both my thighs were cramping. If I put any pressure on any of my 
muscles, I'd cramp. I just tried to win as many points as I could. When I had a 
chance, I went for it." 
</P>
<P>
After being outhit by Lendl for two long sets of marathon rallies, Chang got 
back into the match by trying to finish off the points quicker and going for 
the lines. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl's concentration was badly shaken, but as Chang was suddenly hit by 
dehydration and cramps, there seemed only one winner. Chang, whose mother was 
watching from the stands, sometimes screamed in pain as he chased Lendl's deep 
ground strokes in the fifth set. 
</P>
<P>
Every opportunity he got, the tournament's No. 15 seed drank from a court-side 
water bottle and declined to sit down during the changeovers to keep his legs 
from collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
To stay in the points, Chang slowed the game down with high looping balls, in 
contrast with his tactics in the third and fourth sets. Whenever he found the 
strength, he continued to smash home winners. 
</P>
<P>
The American's serve suffered the most. Tightened with cramps, he gave Lendl 
short, soft balls to return and, in his last service game, Chang even served 
one point underhanded. 
</P>
<P>
It took Lendl so much by surprise that the 29-year-old Czechoslovakian ended a 
point when he hit a volley wide. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl's concentration was shattered by then and Chang, saving his energy for 
his opponent's service games, broke the top seed for a fourth straight time. 
</P>
<P>
When Lendl served to save the match at 3-5, 15-40, Chang moved to within two 
feet of the service line to receive a second serve by Lendl. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a double fault, the first time since 1982 that Lendl had exited 
so early at Stade Roland Garros. It also ended his hopes of winning the Grand 
Slam after his victory at the Australian Open in January. 
</P>
<P>
"After the third set, I wasn't moving well," Chang said. "I tried to do 
whatever I could to win. If I were to play all long rallies with Ivan, I would 
have lost. Whenever I had a chance, I reached for it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attempts to Rattle Lendl 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the last point, Chang said it was just a way of trying to rattle 
Lendl. 
</P>
<P>
"When I do that, it's just to make him think. I just stood up there to bother 
his concentration," Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he understands how tough it must have been for Lendl to keep his 
control and concentration. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really hard mentally to play against someone you know is tired and 
cramping," Chang said. "You don't want to miss. You play conservatively, you 
don't play your game." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl said that by the time he knew Chang was hurt, he could not find the power 
to finish off his opponent. 
</P>
<P>
"I had trouble generating pace," Lendl said. "When your opponent cramps 
reasonably early, you can put pace on the ball. When it happens later, it's 
very difficult. The ball was not coming off my racket and it probably cost me 
the match." 
</P>
<P>
He was gracious in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael showed a lot of courage and deserves credit for it. When you get 
cramps, it's very painful," Lendl said. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, a three-time French Open champion, had won six tournaments this year 
coming into Paris and had lost only two Grand Prix matches in one of his best 
seasons for several years. 
</P>
<P>
With his hopes of a fourth French crown in tatters, he now has to concentrate 
his thoughts on Wimbledon, where he has never won the men's title.

The World Boxing Organization featherweight title fight between Italian 
champion Maurizio Stecca and Venezuelan challenger Levy Mayor has been 
postponed one week to June 16. 
</P>
<P>
The bout was originally scheduled at Milan's Palatrussardi arena Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Stecca's manager, Umberto Branchini, said today that a delayed recognition of 
the title fight by the Italian Boxing Federation caused the postponement. 
</P>
<P>
"We were informed that the authorization will be given by June 16," Branchini 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Italian officials initially had opposed Mayor, claiming that he was not a boxer 
of international level.
