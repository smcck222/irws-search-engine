CONTROVERSY OVER STATE LOTTERY'S NEW GAME TO INCREASE JACKPOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack M. Tuell's column (commentary, May 19) points out convincingly the damage 
being perpetrated upon California's citizenry by the state lottery. We need to 
be reminded again that: 
</P>
<P>
* The lottery is a regressive tax on the poor, often robbing families of the 
necessities of life. 
</P>
<P>
* Schools obtain only a minuscule percentage of their budgets from lottery 
support. 
</P>
<P>
* Promotional publicity for the lottery is misleading since it emphasizes the 
drama of winning, playing down the overwhelming odds against any windfall. 
</P>
<P>
* Gambling itself embodies the principle of getting something for nothing -- 
not a very commendable lesson for our youth. 
</P>
<P>
The manner in which TV, radio and the press glamorize and promote the lottery 
is to be soundly condemned. True, a majority voted for it, mesmerized by a 
deceptive campaign financed by a lottery-equipment manufacturer, but it must be 
remembered that more than 40% of the electorate opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
Tuell's revelations should awaken Californians to the threat of the lottery to 
the moral foundations of their common life.

CONTROVERSY OVER STATE LOTTERY'S NEW GAME TO INCREASE JACKPOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the state goes into the numbers racket, the consequences are bound to be 
embarrassing -- for everyone involved. 
</P>
<P>
As a Californian, I am embarrassed to see a state commission hawking lottery 
tickets as if its enterprise were a legitimate function of government. 
</P>
<P>
Parents in our school district are embarrassed to learn that their support of 
the California lottery, touted as a major source of help for our faltering 
educational system, has brought no relief from overcrowded classrooms and 
over-stressed teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators must be embarrassed to realize that the big jackpots which entice 
poorly educated citizens to double their bets will never actually be paid from 
the betting pool. The operators of this grandest of all scams have the 
government's own blessing on a formula which spreads the payoff over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Time enough for them to invest the money and cover the winners' annual checks 
with the interest. Twenty years from now they will still have the principal. 
</P>
<P>
Now you tell us ("New Lotto Game Aims at Super Jackpots," Part A, May 25) that 
lottery officials will try to boost revenues by further diminishing the odds on 
the new Lotto game in order to produce more giant jackpots. (Starting on June 
21, players will pick six numbers from a field of 53 instead of the present 
49.) 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it's time to change the motto on the official seal of our great state. 
</P>
<P>
From "Eureka" to "Never Give a Sucker an Even Break." Sort of a Lotto motto.

ISRAEL'S IMAGE ON THE NIGHTLY NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Schram's column is incredibly naive. He correctly reflects in words what we see 
on TV, yet he, as a syndicated columnist, should know that "powerful pictures 
tell powerful truths" is often not true -- that is one reason we need 
syndicated columnists! 
</P>
<P>
While agreeing that "Israel's cause remains just," he believes that "Israel 
alone can act to win the peace." He should know that Israel cannot win any 
peace without the cooperation not only of the Palestinians, but of the Arab 
nations surrounding Israel, which are, but for Egypt, still at war with her. It 
is a pity he did not read the next column in The Times, "Deep Biases, Short 
Memories" by Cal Thomas! He would have understood why Israel lost the TV war. 
Even he admits that "occupying forces will always be seen as persecuting 
forces." 
</P>
<P>
All this raises a mind-shattering possibility. Perhaps Israel should have done 
what the Egyptians did at the beginning of the intifada -- send in a couple of 
truckloads of soldiers and brutally, but efficiently, put down the first 
rustlings of revolt. Ironically, it would have saved 400 to 500 lives. (The 
media, of course, would have reacted violently as they did not do when Egypt 
moved against the Palestinians in Gaza). The revolt would not have gotten off 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
This was the reasoning that justified the use of the A-bomb on the Japanese. I 
shudder to think that it might have been what the Israelis should have done 
more than two years ago in the "occupied territories." I shudder because this 
is what the far right in Israel has been saying all along.

<P>
At the first full-fledged post-Cold War summit meeting, two questions were 
paramount: 
</P>
<P>
 -- What kind of security order will replace NATO and the Warsaw Pact? 
</P>
<P>
 -- And what kind of Soviet Union will emerge from the revolutionary upheavals 
that are under way there? 
</P>
<P>
The meetings between Presidents Bush and Gorbachev did not, and could not, 
supply definitive answers. But certainly the American preferences are clear: 
Washington wants a peaceful Europe with a united Germany belonging to NATO, and 
it wants a democratic Soviet Union with a market economy. The test of this 
summit from the American point of view is whether it paves the way for progress 
toward these goals at a series of other important international meetings later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
The American government rightly insists that Europe will be stable if, and only 
if, a united Germany remains part of an American-led alliance. Mikhail 
Gorbachev used his visit to Washington to register his reservations about the 
idea. The message he delivered was not so much that he would never permit the 
new Germany to belong to NATO, but rather that this would be acceptable to 
Moscow only if NATO were transformed. Privately, the Bush Administration has 
sought to assure him that NATO will change. Instead of containing the Soviet 
Union, the Atlantic Alliance will be designed to provide insurance against more 
abstract and distant threats -- uncertainty and instability. 
</P>
<P>
The task for the United States and its allies is to move as quickly as possible 
to make these changes. The appropriate occasion for announcing a new mission 
and a new military strategy for the alliance is the special NATO summit meeting 
that is scheduled for July. 
</P>
<P>
Reducing Western forces in Europe, especially in Germany, is also important. To 
avoid singling out the Germans for special treatment, this will require 
establishing a central European zone encompassing several countries, including 
Germany, where all armed forces will be strictly limited. The appropriate 
vehicle for such limits is a treaty on conventional forces in Europe, now being 
negotiated and which Bush has committed himself to sign by the end of this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
A CFE treaty would be signed not at another U.S.-Soviet meeting, but at an 
all-European summit conference, to be held under the auspices of the Conference 
on Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Such a meeting, tentatively scheduled for Paris near the end of the year, would 
also be the occasion for addressing another Soviet concern by upgrading the 
status of the CSCE. 
</P>
<P>
While the United States and the West will have considerable influence on 
Europe's new security arrangements, they can do far less to shape the political 
institutions and economic system of the Soviet Union. Still, modest leverage is 
available, and the United States made a good start on using it by signing a 
conditional trade treaty with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
There is more that the West can do to encourage the Soviet Union to move to a 
market economy. The economic summit meeting of the major Western industrial 
countries, which will be held next month in Houston, can be the occasion for a 
thorough discussion of how the world's economic great powers can assist 
formerly Communist countries in making this transition. 
</P>
<P>
There is something to be said for inviting a Soviet representative to the 
economic summit, if only as an observer. This would have symbolic importance. 
For if the Soviet Union should ever come to participate regularly and fully in 
these annual meetings, this would mark the final success of American and 
Western policy. 
</P>
<P>
It would mean that America's Cold War adversary had transformed itself into 
what, in the long centuries of Russian history, it has never been. It would 
mean that sweeping reform had made the Soviet Union precisely what it is in the 
interest of the West to have it become -- a large, prosperous, industrial and 
above all democratic country.

A LOOSE SEMANTIC CANNON BOOMS OF IRRESPONSIBILITY; 
</P>
<P>
ABORTION: 'FOR BIRTH CONTROL' IS VERBAL DRESSING FOR AN OLD PROHIBITION, A 
MEANS OF TURNING MORAL DISTINCTIONS INTO LAWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When some future archaeologists come to explore the battlefield on which 
abortion was waged during the late 20th Century, they'll have to dig through 
layers of words and decades of phrases. Semantics, they will discover, are the 
weapons with which this civil war is being fought. 
</P>
<P>
On this beleaguered turf, every capture of new territory is marked by the 
phrases that catch on. Every victory site is littered with the shells of 
propaganda that became part of our everyday language. 
</P>
<P>
In this linguistic dig, they will find banner phrases like "pro-choice" and 
"pro-life" -- words as loaded with meaning as any cannon. They will unearth 
debates between those who said "unborn child" and those who said "fetus." They 
will rediscover arguments between those who said "mother" and those who said 
"pregnant woman." 
</P>
<P>
And at the layer marked 1990, they may even see the shards of the most current 
phrase in the battle for the abortion middleground. One expression has 
infiltrated the media and the legislation this year: "abortion for birth 
control." 
</P>
<P>
I heard these words dozens of times before they hit my own language-alarm 
button. They came across my consciousness like a nail on a blackboard, abrasive 
but brief. Hold your ears and it will pass. 
</P>
<P>
But the phrase finally stuck in South Dakota when a local television anchor 
asked me what I thought about the "fact" that 90% of all abortions were done 
for birth control. Tape rolling, I asked my colleague: Did he believe that a 
woman literally chose abortion, that her preferred method of family planning 
was to place her feet in stirrups while a doctor put a vacuum aspirator into 
her body? My response never made the news. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion for birth control. The phrase was born in right-to-life publications 
as a deliberate attempt to capture the ambivalent majority. It appeared 
full-grown on legislation in Utah, Minnesota, Alabama, Idaho. It acquired 
respectability on television, in print, and in polling data. 
</P>
<P>
What does it mean? This week, Louisiana will hold hearings on two such bills 
that simply define every abortion -- except those for rape, incest, the life of 
the pregnant woman and, in one bill, fetal deformity -- as an "abortion for 
birth control." Abortion "for birth control" is verbal dressing for an old 
prohibition. But the phrase is also a kind of Rosetta stone for the abortion 
debate, circa 1990. 
</P>
<P>
This expression plays to the widespread belief that somewhere out there are 
women choosing abortion frivolously, sexually active women consciously choosing 
aspiration over a diaphragm, young and single women choosing termination 
because motherhood would be "inconvenient." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new and improved packaging of an anti-abortion message," says Frances 
Kissling of Catholics for a Free Choice, "It's also a way of saying, 'We're not 
opposed to all abortions, only to these irresponsible abortions.' " 
</P>
<P>
After reading the polling data with a fine eye, political scientist Ethel Klein 
ties this into the general feeling that society is out of control. "Sexual 
irresponsibility has become a metaphor for irresponsibility in general. People 
want more boundaries and discipline. The immediate reaction is punitive." 
</P>
<P>
But abortion is used as birth control only in the most literal sense of those 
words: It prevents the birth of a child. In countries like the Soviet Union, 
where contraceptives are crude or unavailable, women are indeed forced to use 
abortion as the "method of family planning." But here, half of the women 
seeking abortions had used contraceptives during sex. A full 84% of women 
seeking abortions had none, or one, previously. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, reminds Walter Dellinger of Duke University, people talked about 
"therapeutic" and "non-therapeutic" abortions. In the '70s and '80s, they 
talked about abortion "for convenience." The linguistic thread has followed a 
desire to distinguish good reasons from bad. And then to turn moral 
distinctions into laws. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, however, is in executing morals. If indeed we are to ban abortions 
"for birth control," how would we separate out the responsible from the 
irresponsible women? Have them bring their diaphragm or pill case to a 
tribunal? If we succeed in that, does motherhood become a punishment? 
Responsible women may have abortions while irresponsible women have children? 
</P>
<P>
Or, like the bills wending their way through Louisiana, do we define as 
frivolous the intimate, private details of more than a million strangers' lives 
a year? 
</P>
<P>
Whichever way the archaeologists cut through the language of this costly war of 
attrition, they will come upon the same powerful question pushing through all 
the fancy semantics: Who is going to decide?

Endowment for International Peace.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet-American relationship is beginning to resemble the medieval dance in 
which the partners take two steps forward, a half step back. Stepping back is 
not unusual; it has always been part of the rhythm of the superpower dance. Yet 
the failure of both powers at the Washington summit to advance a significantly 
new quality to their relationship has demonstrated that they have not yet freed 
themselves from the habits and shadows of the Cold War. Their inability to wind 
up a very old agenda is preventing them from charting a new course. 
</P>
<P>
The American problem is that of intentions. The Cold War gave American foreign 
policy a clear direction. Now we have lost our compass. The question awaiting 
public consensus is, what direction should we take? To what ends, and with what 
means, should we shape world affairs? And should we work with Gorbachev to 
devise new international arrangements to guide a cooperative security regime in 
the post-Cold War era? Or do we still retain sufficient skepticism of Soviet 
behavior and Gorbachev's chances of survival to warrant a much more cautious 
approach as changes keep unfolding before us? 
</P>
<P>
It will take time to arrive at that consensus and set a new course for the 
American ship of state. The Soviets already have a strong consensus, for 
reform; their problem lies in a troubling inability to move ahead. Gorbachev 
has assumed broad powers, yet his authority to effect change appears to be 
fading. The old system has been destroyed, but the new system cannot emerge. 
Internal divisions are widening. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's intense interest in a Soviet-American trade agreement illustrates 
his desperate need to demonstrate tangible economic accomplishments to his 
people. Given Congress' ambivalence, however, the agreement is likely to prove 
more symbol than substance. 
</P>
<P>
The dynamic between the American problem of intention and the Soviet problem of 
implementation is hindering the evolution of a modern relationship geared to 
the challenges facing the two powers in the 1990s. The superpower two-step is 
stuttering as the world moves on. The summit was thus significant less as a 
marker of change in the relationship between Moscow and Washington as of the 
change in the relationship of both countries to the world. 
</P>
<P>
Power is diffusing. International events are less driven by the Soviet-American 
relationship. New powers have emerged. Other nations have grown in power, to 
the point where the ambitions of the United States and the Soviet Union are 
likely to be constrained less by one another than by regional actors. 
</P>
<P>
The very nature of power itself has changed: There is a growing discrepancy 
between power measured in military resources and power measured in terms of 
control over the outcome of events. 
</P>
<P>
These trends have been energized and clarified by the dynamic of German 
unification and the collapse of the Soviet Union's external empire in Eastern 
Europe. As a result of these events, Americans and Soviets are sliding into new 
world roles. 
</P>
<P>
America may no longer be a clear Number One, but it has become the Only One: 
the only nation that still retains significant attributes of power in all its 
dimensions -- military, political, economic, technological, demographic -- and 
the only nation with the opportunity to leverage its central influence with 
Japan, Europe and Germany, the Soviet Union and other major nations to advance 
its own interests together with those of its partners. It could emerge as the 
world balancer. Yet Americans are distracted and complacent. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, on the other hand, remains a formidable second in global 
military power, yet is deficient in most other attributes of power. While the 
military component of Soviet-American relations will remain central, the 
purposeful use of military power for direct political or economic influence has 
become relatively ineffective. Beset by grave internal difficulties, the Soviet 
Union will remain selectively strong, handicapped by a relative incapacity to 
translate its great potential into prosperity for its people or effective power 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The swirl and flash of the Washington summit distracted attention from a 
central fact: Until we can cut the knot tying American ambivalence to Soviet 
paralysis, Moscow and Washington will continue to be preoccupied with the 
vestiges of the Cold War while summits involving other nations become more 
relevant to defining a positive agenda for change in the world.

Cal Ripken, in an eight-for-57 slump, hit a sacrifice fly in the sixth inning 
that gave the Baltimore Orioles the go-ahead run in a 6-4 victory over the 
Milwaukee Brewers Monday night at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore's third consecutive victory came on a night when Manager Frank 
Robinson returned from a three-game suspension he received for criticizing 
umpire Drew Coble in Minneapolis last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles squandered a 4-1 lead but got the go-ahead run with the help of 
Milwaukee's 58th error of the season. 
</P>
<P>
With the score 4-4, Craig Worthington singled off reliever Bill Krueger (2-2). 
Billy Ripken bunted and when third baseman Gary Sheffield threw high to first, 
Ripken was safe. Phil Bradley singled to load the bases and after pinch-hitter 
Brad Komminsk struck out, Ripken hit his sacrifice fly. 
</P>

Boston 5, New York 3 -- Tom Brunansky drove in four runs with a homer, a 
sacrifice fly and a tiebreaking double in the eighth inning as the Red Sox beat 
Yankees at Boston.

In eight games at Fenway Park since being acquired from St. Louis in a trade 
for Lee Smith May 4, Brunansky is 13 for 31 (.419).

Coming home with Bud Harrelson as manager didn't seem to help the New York Mets 
much Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 24,433 didn't respond when Harrelson popped out of the dugout the 
first time, and so far the Mets have showed few signs of turning things around. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Santovenia, hitting only .150, delivered a two-run pinch-single with the 
bases loaded in the seventh inning as the Montreal Expos rallied for a 5-3 
victory over the struggling Mets at New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think we're getting close to busting out," Harrelson said. "I'm still 
positive." 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped New York to 21-26, its worst record this late in the season 
since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Since Harrelson replaced Dave Johnson last Tuesday, the Mets have lost four of 
five games. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos, who outhit the Mets, 13-5, have won seven of eight road games and 
their last six of seven overall. 
</P>
<P>
Met starter David Cone (1-4), who matched a career high with 12 strikeouts, 
also gave up five runs and 11 hits in 6 1/3 innings as the Mets lost for the 
seventh time in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 6, Chicago 2 -- The Pirates went looking for a left-handed starter 
when John Smiley went on the disabled list last month. They may have found one 
on their own pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Patterson earned his second consecutive victory as a starter and Barry 
Bonds hit a two-run triple, leading the Pirates to a 6-2 victory over the Cubs 
at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson (4-1) had a 3-7 record and 5.97 earned-run average as a starter 
before this season. In his two 1990 starts, he has given up 11 hits and four 
runs, and struck out nine in 13 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Cubs, Patterson lowered his ERA this season to 2.91 while giving up 
five hits in seven innings. He pitched six shutout innings before giving up 
Hector Villaneuva's solo homer. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 10, Cincinnati 1 -- John Burkett pitched the first complete game 
of his career and every Giant starter got a hit by the fourth inning as the 
Reds were routed at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants got 16 hits and batted around twice in the first four innings to 
take an 8-0 lead. They scored five runs on seven hits in the first off Ron 
Robinson (2-2), who had a 6-1 lifetime record against the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Burkett (5-1) gave up seven hits and got 16 outs on grounders. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 10, Houston 2 -- Garry Templeton had four hits and the Padres enjoyed 
their biggest inning of the season -- eight runs in the eighth -- and trounced 
the Astros at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Bip Roberts had three of San Diego's 15 hits and Tony Gwynn and Benito Santiago 
had two-run singles as the Padres won for the sixth time in seven games and 
handed Houston its fourth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros' Glenn Davis hit his fourth homer in six games and leads the NL with 
16. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 3, Philadelphia 2 -- Terry Pendleton's RBI single over a drawn-in 
outfield in the 11th inning gave the Cardinals a victory over the Phillies at 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals won despite getting only four hits in the last 10 innings after 
Pedro Guerrero's two-run double in the first.

COLLEGE DIVISION: RIVAL SOUTHLAND COACHES TEAM UP TO GUIDE SQUAD IN SUMMER 
LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the college baseball season, they are fierce coaching rivals in District 
3 of the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
But this summer, Rich Hill of Cal Lutheran and Tony Barbone of Azusa Pacific 
will be coaching the same team. 
</P>
<P>
Hill will coach the Chatham (Mass.) squad in the Cape Cod Summer Baseball 
League and Barbone will be his assistant. 
</P>
<P>
The league is financially subsidized by major league baseball, which provides 
balls and wooden bats, and features many of the top players in the NCAA 
Division I. It is regarded as the nation's premier summer league for college 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Hill and Barbone are the only NAIA coaches in the 10-team league, which 
conducts its season from June 14 through mid-August. The teams are within an 
hour's drive of each other on Cape Cod. 
</P>
<P>
This will be Hill's second year there. Last summer, Hill was an assistant at 
Brewster. Barbone is going for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Hill said he earned of the 1989 opening through a Division I coach. 
</P>
<P>
"We were playing San Diego State in a winter league game and their pitching 
coach was with Brewster and he said he wasn't going back (the next season)," 
Hill said. "So I applied and I got it and that kind of opened the door for this 
position." 
</P>
<P>
He heard about the opening in Chatham from Bobby Whelan, who was coach of the 
team last season but left when he became coach at Dartmouth. 
</P>
<P>
"I had known Bobby Whelan and when he got the job at Dartmouth; he said he 
didn't think he'd have time to coach the team," Hill said. "He had mentioned it 
would be available and if I wanted to apply I should go ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Then, at the National Baseball Coaches convention in January in San Francisco, 
Hill approached Barbone about possibly becoming his assistant. Later in the 
month, Hill learned that he had been hired as Chatham's coach. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Hill said, a lot of people didn't understand why he chose Barbone -- 
coach of a district rival -- as his assistant. 
</P>
<P>
"People thought I was crazy to take Tony Barbone with me because we're rivals 
and we fight like dogs on the field," he said. "But he's such a good coach, 
especially with the pitchers. I just thought he could really help us." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Barbone added, they have become pretty good friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Rich and I have a pretty good relationship and our teams always play good, 
spirited games against each other," he said. "Throughout the entire (district) 
season, we were talking back and forth about this and we've become pretty 
close." 
</P>
<P>
Barbone said, however, that it will be a strain to be away from his wife and 
two small children for most of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
He also had to get clearance from Azusa Pacific, but he reached an agreement 
with Athletic Director Cliff Hamlow. 
</P>
<P>
"We came to an understanding of how we're going to work it out, so that I take 
care of the things I have to do here," Barbone said. (Hamlow) . . . was very 
supportive." 
</P>
<P>
Barbone said it would be worth the strain because coaching in the league is an 
opportunity that most college coaches do not get. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard nothing but good things about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hill has fond memories of his Cape Cod season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely a great experience as a coach," he said. "I had a great time 
last year. It was fun as an assistant and it's going to be a good experience as 
a head coach this time. 
</P>
<P>
"You have the elite college baseball players in the country playing in one of 
the best vacation spots in the country. It's like a Norman Rockwell painting 
come to life." 
</P>
<P>
Not only is there strong fan support from each town, Hill said, the league is a 
haven for major league scouts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely good in terms of exposure," Hill said. "There are at least five 
or six scouts at every game. They want to see what a kid can do with a wood 
bat." 
</P>
<P>
Hill said the league is similar in structure to a minor league. 
</P>
<P>
"There's great competition but it's not the pressure situation that exists in 
the minors," he said. "They (players) all have a day job, a place to stay and 
they know they're going back to college regardless of what happens." 
</P>
<P>
With the attention from the major leagues, Hill and Barbone agree that coaching 
in the Cape Cod league provides good exposure for themselves as well as the 
NAIA and District 3. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is really great for our district," Barbone said. "It speaks very 
well for our league and the type of baseball we play. The NAIA is seen in some 
ways as the ugly stepchild of the NCAA, but I think we've always been a very 
good district for baseball and we've done very well against NCAA teams." 
</P>
<P>
Added Hill: "When you're coaching at the small-college level you have to really 
coach. A lot of people don't realize the difficulties of coaching at this 
level. We're not always blessed with great players but we've still won a lot of 
games." 
</P>
<P>
That was true for both Cal Lutheran and Azusa Pacific this season. Azusa 
Pacific won the regular-season district title and finished with a 34-12 record, 
losing to Cal Lutheran in the final of the district tournament. Cal Lutheran 
advanced to the NAIA area playoffs before losing in the final to Lewis and 
Clark College of Portland, Ore., 35-16. 
</P>
<P>
But Hill wants to cast aside any rivalry with Barbone, at least for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to forget about the Azusa Pacific and Cal Lutheran rivalry for a 
while," he said. "I just want to bring home a championship (at Chatham), and 
that's how Tony feels." 
</P>
<P>
In its final season of competition in the NCAA Division II before moving up to 
Division I next season, Cal State Northridge finished short of winning a 
national title. 
</P>
<P>
But the Matadors came close to a title in several spring sports. 
</P>
<P>
The closest call may have been in baseball, where Northridge reached the 
Division II championship game last week only to lose to Jacksonville State of 
Alabama, 12-8, in Montgomery. The Matadors (39-22), who began the Division II 
World Series seeded second, behind Jacksonville, couldn't hold a 6-1 lead in 
the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge also came close to a title in women's softball, dropping a 6-2 
decision to Cal State Bakersfield, its California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
rival, in the title game two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Four other Northridge teams finished among the national leaders in the spring 
season. The Matadors placed second in men's track, fifth in women's track, 
third in men's golf and tied for fifth in women's tennis. 
</P>
<P>
That left the school with 34 national titles in 12 sports. Nine of those titles 
were won in men's swimming and four in women's softball and swimming. 
</P>
<P>
College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
Two players from Cal State Northridge were selected to the NCAA Division II 
All-American baseball team. Scott Sharts, who led Division II with 29 home 
runs, was named as an infielder and Craig Clayton as a designated hitter. 
Sharts is also a pitcher and Clayton is an outfielder, first baseman and 
pitcher. . . . Two other players from the CCAA, outfielder Pete Weber of UC 
Riverside and catcher Doug Noce of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, were also chosen 
to the 15-player squad. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State San Bernardino men's golf team capped an outstanding season by 
finishing in a tie for fourth with Wittenberg of Ohio in the NCAA Division III 
tournament last week at Jekyll Island, Ga. The Coyotes started the tournament 
ranked fifth in the division.

Imagine That: Jim Bakker's cellmate Monday denied tabloid reports that the 
evangelist preaches to imaginary congregations. David Miskavige, wrote a 
reporter that Bakker instead spends his days comforting the sick at the federal 
prison hospital in Rochester, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker was found guilty last year of fraud and conspiracy related to his PTL 
ministry. 
</P>
<P>
Getting Closer: Paul Olum, retired president of the University of Oregon who 
has been linked to Margaret Papandreou, the ex-wife of former Greek Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou, says he's moving to Greece for good. "Athens has 
something that Eugene doesn't have," Olum, 71, said, "and I don't mean the 
Acropolis. . . . I'm going to Greece to be with a very good friend."

Royal Birth: Marina Mowatt, the 23-year-old cousin to Queen Elizabeth who 
caused an uproar by becoming pregnant out of wedlock, has given birth to a 
daughter. Mowatt, 27th in line to the throne, had a girl late last month in 
West London. Mowatt announced last year she was having the child of her 
boyfriend Paul Mowatt, who she later married. The name and exact birth date of 
the healthy 7-pound girl were not announced.

Question: At first my husband thought he must have a cold because his nose was 
always stopped up. When the stuffiness didn't clear up within a couple of 
weeks, he was certain he had an allergy. 
</P>
<P>
When that didn't clear up within a couple of months, he went to his doctor and 
was told he had a deviated septum. I'd like to know what that is, what causes 
it, and how common it is. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Obstruction of the nasal passage, as with a deviated septum, is not 
uncommon. As in your husband's case, many people tend to attribute nasal 
congestion to a cold or an allergy. Quite often they don't think of seeing a 
physician until they begin to realize that they are not being helped with 
medication. The symptoms of nasal obstruction include breathing through the 
mouth, noisy breathing, and an inability to breathe deeply. 
</P>
<P>
Some nasal passage obstructions, such as a deviated septum, are due to injury; 
some may have occurred at the time of birth. In individuals with a deviated 
septum, the wall dividing the two nostrils is pushed to one side so that one of 
the passages is blocked.

STILL TREATING THE DEBATE ON CANCER;

THE CANCER INDUSTRY: UNRAVELLING THE POLITICS BY RALPH W. MOSS PARAGON HOUSE

<P>
In the end, nearly all disputes are theological. The reasons we give for what 
we believe are rationalizations we make up after we've decided. Reason and 
logic make our beliefs look respectable. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph W. Moss is a science writer who has spent 15 years studying cancer 
research and treatment. He believes that the conventional treatments -- 
surgery, radiation and chemotherapy -- largely do not work and that 
unconventional treatments -- Laetrile, diet and vitamins, for example -- are 
promising approaches that have been dismissed by the medical establishment. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that this debate never ends is yet further proof of people's 
willingness to believe nonsense (not that there is any shortage of such 
evidence). Laetrile has been tested. And tested. And tested. And tested. The 
National Cancer Institute did a major nationwide study in the early 1980s and 
concluded that Laetrile is "ineffective as a treatment for cancer." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the true believers, Moss among them, will not give up. The National Cancer 
Institute did not use real Laetrile, they say. The study was just a way to 
discredit Laetrile. 
</P>
<P>
"More laetrile is being used in the late '80s than it was a decade before," 
Moss writes. He seems to think that this demonstrates that Laetrile works 
rather than recognizing what it does demonstrate: that desperate people will 
try anything. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the war on cancer (like the war on drugs and the war on poverty) 
has gotten essentially nowhere. The incidence of cancer continues to increase, 
and mortality rates remain high. More than a million Americans are diagnosed 
with cancer yearly, and more than 500,000 die of the disease every year. So 
far, cancer treatment is not one of orthodox medicine's success stories. 
</P>
<P>
But I do not understand why otherwise sensible people conclude that the answer 
lies with unorthodox medicine -- particularly when the data show otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Moss argues that the medical establishment suppresses data that does not agree 
with its view and harasses or jails health-care providers who try to do things 
differently. "Scientific theories are suppressed, medical records seized, 
clinics shut down, and innovative clinicians thrown in prison," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
But he never adequately explains why this great conspiracy exists or how it is 
maintained. His book is chockablock with alleged skulduggery by the medical 
establishment. Does he really believe that doctors don't want to cure cancer? 
That they want to see their patients suffer and die? That they blindly turn 
their backs on promising treatments in order to preserve their erroneous view 
of disease? 
</P>
<P>
Why is it that only a tiny number of doctors (I'm sure I'll hear from them and 
their adherents) continue to believe in the claptrap that Moss is spewing? The 
great weight of evidence and informed scientific opinion rejects this book out 
of hand. 
</P>
<P>
The Laetrilists, dietitians, vitamin advocates and believers in the power of 
positive thinking will respond by pointing to Galileo, a single individual who 
stood up to and defeated the weight of scientific opinion. The majority of 
scientists can be -- and are -- wrong, they will say. 
</P>
<P>
Until effective cures for cancer are found, this dispute cannot be resolved. 
The orthodox view will continue to dismiss alternate treatments as quackery. 
The unorthodox view will continue to dismiss the medical establishment as 
narrow-minded dogmatists. As in most disputes, neither side can persuade the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
Moss' personal history exemplifies the problem. He used to be assistant 
director of public relations for the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in 
New York, a very orthodox institution. But he was fired because of his views 
about Laetrile. 
</P>
<P>
He says he was dismissed because he refused to participate in falsifying 
evidence. Sloan-Kettering undoubtedly says that his judgment is faulty and that 
he ceased to be an effective spokesman for cancer research. Take your pick. 
</P>
<P>
In this century, medicine has scored tremendous successes in treating and 
curing communicable diseases -- the first time in history that doctors have 
actually been able to intervene and help their patients, not just hold their 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
Cancer has proved much more intractable. There is no cancer equivalent to 
antibiotics. But the approach of orthodox medicine is sound, and it should not 
be abandoned in the desperate search to find a cure for cancer.

FLURRY OF TV ADS, SPEECHES SET STAGE FOR TODAY'S VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The long and tempestuous primary campaign came to a frenzied close Monday, the 
airwaves filled with a rush of television ads and candidates scouring the state 
to round up any undecided or teetering voters. 
</P>
<P>
Ushering in an Election Day on which only 44% of California's voters are 
expected to cast ballots, front-runners and underdogs alike put on confident 
faces and got in a few last digs at their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Both of the candidates in the state's headline race -- the Democratic 
gubernatorial primary -- navigated the spine of California by airplane for 
get-out-the-vote rallies. For Dianne Feinstein, it was time to sound 
magnanimous and counsel her supporters not to take victory for granted -- 
despite a comfortable double-digit lead in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
At a rev-'em-up breakfast in Culver City that preceded stops in Stockton, Tracy 
and San Francisco, the former San Francisco mayor expressed confidence that 
California's Democrats are ready to nominate a woman. 
</P>
<P>
"They do want to have someone strong who is going to take care of them and take 
care of their families, and they really don't care what kind of shell that 
individual comes in," Feinstein said of voters she hopes will ultimately make 
her the state's first woman governor. 
</P>
<P>
For John K. Van de Kamp, the state attorney general, Monday brought one last 
flurry of criticisms aimed at his opponent, one last urging for voters to 
ignore Feinstein's gender and "vote for the best candidate." Van de Kamp's 
hopes are riding on the notion that the polls, which show Feinstein leading 
him, are wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the people being polled, and particularly women, might be telling the 
pollsters one thing and doing another," said Van de Kamp, who campaigned Monday 
in San Diego, Los Angeles' Watts neighborhood and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Today's election holds the potential for sweeping change in California, quite 
apart from the governor's race. Proposition 111 on the ballot would raise the 
state's spending limit and double the state's gasoline tax -- perhaps signaling 
the beginning of the end of the Proposition 13 era. Two additional 
propositions, 108 and 116, would sharply increase spending for rail 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Stricter ethical standards -- and the potential for a raise in pay -- for 
legislators hang in the balance with Proposition 112. The legislators' 
controversial power to draw their own district lines would be altered with the 
passage of Proposition 118 or 119, the competing reapportionment initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
And the emotional issue of crime is at the heart of Proposition 115, which 
promises to speed up criminal trials and make it easier for prosecutors to seek 
the death penalty. Opponents counter that its passage would endanger the right 
to an abortion, which currently is guarded by the California Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
All of those issues will be in the hands of fewer than half of the state's 13 
million registered voters, according to predictions by Secretary of State March 
Fong Eu. If she is right, the percentage of voters would be within range of the 
state's worst turnout -- 40% in 1988. The polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the statewide races, there are contests of interest throughout 
California. In Oakland, Lionel Wilson, the 13-year incumbent who made history 
when he was elected the city's first black mayor, is an underdog in a contest 
against seven challengers. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, 10 people are vying for the seat being given up by 
veteran county Supervisor Pete Schabarum -- but the outcome of the election is 
shadowed by a federal court judge's decision Monday that the county board 
discriminated against Latinos in its last reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
And in the city of Los Angeles, voters will decide whether to give council 
members a $25,000 raise in exchange for enforcing limits on the outside income 
they can receive. The measure also would give the mayor a salary boost and 
would establish the public financing of political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats running for their party's nomination for governor closed off 
their multimillion-dollar election efforts the same way they began them -- 
trying to persuade voters that their brand of change is the most compelling. 
</P>
<P>
Urging her supporters to rally others to vote, Feinstein said she believes that 
California is "on the cusp of a very real change" in improving its education 
system and protecting victims of crime. 
</P>
<P>
"People do want change, not for the sake of change but for the sake of 
leadership . . . and solving the problems," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, looking tired but maintaining a public confidence as he addressed 
dozens of senior citizens at a luncheon in Watts, described himself as being 
"in a battle for the soul of our Democratic Party" against an opponent he has 
described as a Republican in ideology. 
</P>
<P>
He read a list of those he said oppose him because of initiatives he has 
proposed and actions he has taken as attorney general -- oil and insurance 
companies, chemical concerns and the National Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't hard to avoid making enemies," he said in a swipe at Feinstein. "Just 
don't do much. Campaign on generalities. Run on a smile. Run on a promise. Do 
that and you can still take power lunches with the Establishment and with the 
powerful." 
</P>
<P>
The winner will face Republican Sen. Pete Wilson, who is assured of his party's 
nomination for governor. 
</P>
<P>
Like Van de Kamp and Feinstein, candidates in the state's other races also 
bounced around California in search of votes -- once with unintended 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Arlo Smith, the San Francisco district attorney who is running for the 
Democratic nomination for attorney general was threatened with arrest for 
shaking the hands of potential voters in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Security guards at the Arco Tower called police on Smith, who is vying with Los 
Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner for the top law enforcement job, when 
Smith decided to greet office employees on their way to work. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the building's owner, Japanese-based Shuwa Investments 
Corp., wanted no part of it and pointedly told Smith's entourage that the 
sidewalk was private property. 
</P>
<P>
Between handshakes, Smith called the corporation's demands that he move 
"ridiculous," but he moved on down the street. 
</P>
<P>
By the time two Los Angeles Police Department cruisers arrived, the guards had 
decided not to press their case. And leaving, Smith decided to shake hands with 
three more potential voters -- the cops.

HIGH COURT LETS RELIGIOUS CLUBS MEET IN SCHOOLS 
</P>

<P>
The Supreme Court Monday opened the doors of public high schools to prayer and 
Bible reading, ruling that secondary schools that allow extracurricular 
activities on campus must also permit religious students to meet for prayer. 
</P>
<P>
On an 8-1 vote, the court said that religious clubs may meet as long as the 
groups are student-sponsored. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Christian evangelicals said that the ruling will stop 
discrimination against religious students in the public schools. But critics 
said that it will open the school doors to everything from the Ku Klux Klan to 
the Young Communists League, because the law that the ruling upheld also 
forbids discrimination against groups based on their political or philosophical 
views. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly three decades ago, the high court set off a national furor by forbidding 
official prayer and school-sponsored Bible readings. Despite the uproar, 
however, the court has held firm to the view that the Constitution prohibits 
the government from injecting religion into the public schools. Just three 
years ago, the justices knocked down a Louisiana law that required teachers to 
give equal time to the teaching of evolution and "creation science," calling 
the latter a religious doctrine in thin disguise. 
</P>
<P>
But conservatives and Christian legal activists have complained that the 
doctrine of "separation of church and state" had been extended so far that it 
had turned into hostility toward religion. In fact, many school officials 
interpreted the court's decision against school-sponsored prayer as a ban on 
all religious activities on school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department attorneys under the Ronald Reagan and Bush administrations 
challenged that interpretation, saying that religious students should have the 
same rights as others to meet on campus. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the high court agreed, ruling that the Constitution does not require 
that the schools be off-limits to religion. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a crucial difference between government speech endorsing religion, 
which the establishment clause (of the First Amendment) forbids, and private 
speech endorsing religion," Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said for the court. 
Allowing students to meet on campus and discuss religion is constitutional, 
O'Connor said, because it does not amount to "state sponsorship of religion." 
</P>
<P>
If a high school allows meetings of groups such as the chess or the stamp club, 
whose activities are "not directly related to" the curriculum, it must also 
allow religious groups to meet there, O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, school district attorney Richard Mason said the Los Angeles 
Unified School District -- the nation's second largest school system -- will 
reevaluate its policy of forbidding school religious clubs, which has been 
based on a California appeals court decision that precludes school-sanctioned 
religious activities. 
</P>
<P>
"Students have requested those kinds of activities in the past, but have been 
discouraged based on our understanding of what the law required us to do," 
Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
"This decision will cause us to review our policies to determine whether 
greater latitude should be given to religious clubs. I suspect the practice 
will have to be changed." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the religious students, delighted with the court decision, 
predicted that prayer clubs will spring up on high school campuses nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"This decision sends a loud and clear message that religious speech on school 
campuses is protected and that public school officials can't stand in the way," 
said Atlanta lawyer Jay Alan Sekulow, general counsel for Christian Advocates 
Serving Evangelism, who represented the students in this case. 
</P>
<P>
But an array of religious and civil liberties groups said that the ruling will 
result in students being pressured to join religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Undoubtedly, the evangelicals will try to put one of these clubs into every 
school in the country, and they have made clear the purpose will be to spread 
the good news of the Gospel. I think students will be pressured by their peers 
to join these groups," said Marc Stern, a lawyer for the American Jewish 
Congress, who represented a Nebraska school board in this case. 
</P>
<P>
"This decision will also allow Louis Farrakan and David Duke to organize groups 
at school," Stern added. 
</P>
<P>
Justice John Paul Stevens, the lone dissenter, said that the ruling "creates a 
constitutional obligation to allow student members of the Ku Klux Klan or the 
Communist Party to have access to school facilities." 
</P>
<P>
But O'Connor noted that the federal law allows school authorities to ban 
disruptive groups. 
</P>
<P>
This case (Board of Education vs. Mergens, 88-1597) arose in 1985, when Bridget 
Mergens and several other students at a high school in Omaha, Neb., told their 
principal that they wanted to form a Christian club to meet after school. 
</P>
<P>
The year before, Congress had enacted the Equal Access Act, which said that 
public secondary schools that allow extracurricular student clubs may not 
"discriminate" against some clubs because of their members' "religious, 
political (or) philosophical" views. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the principal, backed by the school board, rejected the request. 
He said that all the school clubs were "curricular," so the federal law did not 
apply. Secondly, he contended that allowing a religious club to meet on campus 
would violate the First Amendment's ban on the "establishment of religion" by 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court rejected both arguments Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the more conservative court has backed away from the view that 
the First Amendment demands a "separation of church and state." As long as the 
government does not "endorse" or "advance" a religion, it does not violate the 
First Amendment, the court has said. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling on the constitutionality of the Equal Access Act left open the 
question of whether prayer groups could operate in elementary schools, because 
the act applies only to secondary schools. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to deciding the constitutional question, the court defined one of 
the act's key terms -- "non-curriculum-related student group" -- in a way that 
applies the law to nearly every high school. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's ruling said that if French is taught in a high school, a French club 
would be a curricular club. But, if chess and stamp collecting are not taught 
as subjects, those clubs are "non-curriculum" groups. Once the school allows 
any of those clubs to meet, she said, it must open the door to all clubs 
without regard to their religious, political or philosophical views. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling leaves high school officials with three choices, said August 
Steinhilber, general counsel for the National School Boards Assn. They may 
eliminate all student clubs. They may allow only clubs that are tied directly 
to the curriculum. Or they must open their doors to all clubs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The first real fight will be over abortion," he said. "Planned Parenthood has 
wanted to have chapters in the schools. If they do, the right-to-life groups 
will want to come in, too." 
</P>
<P>
Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan concurred in the outcome of 
the Westside High School case but expressed serious reservations. 
</P>
<P>
In another case decided Monday, the court ruled unanimously that nuclear 
"whistle-blowers" who are disciplined by their employers may sue for damages in 
a state court, in addition to filing claims under a 1974 federal law that 
protects whistle-blowers (English vs. General Electric Co., 89-152).

GOVERNMENT: LAW GROUP THAT WON A SUIT OVER BUDGET FOR FAMILY PLANNING CLINICS 
CALLS ACTION 'POLITICAL RETALIATION.' A FEDERAL AGENCY SAYS THE LAWYERS BACKED 
CLINICS THAT 'PROMOTE ABORTION.'

<P>
The public interest law firm that successfully challenged Gov. George 
Deukmejian's decision to slash funding to the state's family planning clinics 
now faces a cut in its own funding, a move that the law firm contends is 
"political retaliation." 
</P>
<P>
California Rural Legal Assistance recently received a letter from a federal 
agency announcing that it intends to reduce the poverty law firm's funding by 
up to $450,000. The federal Legal Services Corp. said CRLA violated a ban 
prohibiting federally funded law firms from using public funds in abortion 
cases. CRLA contends that the issue was about family planning, not abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The federal cut would force layoffs of nine of CRLA's 54 attorneys unless other 
sources of funding are found, said Jose Padilla, CRLA's director. 
</P>
<P>
CRLA filed suit last year against the state to restore $24 million in family 
planning funds that Deukmejian had slashed in a budget veto. The family 
planning clinics provide health care to thousands of poor women, and the loss 
of funding created a statewide controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The case particularly rankled the governor because the suit, which was under 
appeal, was successful in the lower courts. In January, Deukmejian, bowing to 
pressure from fellow Republicans, put an end to what had been an embarrassing 
political issue by allowing a $20-million family planning bill to become law 
without his signature. 
</P>
<P>
But CRLA did not have long to savor its victory. The next day, Legal Services 
faxed CRLA a letter announcing that it was sending four officials from 
Washington to begin an investigation into whether the law firm was involved in 
abortion litigation. The agency gave CRLA one business day's notice to prepare 
for the investigation, said Joel Diringer, a CRLA staff attorney who filed the 
lawsuit against the state. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can't punish poor women, they're going to punish their 
representatives," Diringer said. "Because of our success in defeating one 
Republican administration, another Republican administration is now 
retaliating." 
</P>
<P>
Terrance Wear, president of Legal Services, said he intends to cut CRLA's 
funding because family planning clinics, which the firm represented, "promote 
abortions." 
</P>
<P>
Diringer said the funding cut is harassment by "right-wing ideologues." He said 
family planning clinics are prohibited by state law from providing or promoting 
abortions. They simply discuss all options with pregnant women, including 
adoption, keeping the baby and abortion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Legal Services is a private, nonprofit organization established by Congress in 
1974 to provide legal help to low-income people. But former President Ronald 
Reagan appointed a board of directors with a majority that was remarkably 
hostile toward its own agency. In 1988, the board hired two outside law firms 
to lobby Congress to cut its own budget. And the next year, the board paid a 
former Reagan Administration lawyer to draft a memorandum that contended the 
federal agency was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Many in Congress were outraged that while Legal Services was cutting funding to 
law firms that represented the poor, it was paying high-priced lawyers to 
dismantle its own agency. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan and many in his Administration frequently criticized poverty lawyers and 
claimed that they used government funds to promote a liberal agenda. In seven 
out of eight budgets, Reagan recommended no funding for Legal Services. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush appointed an entirely new board in January, but Wear, a holdover 
from the Reagan era, will not be stepping down until next month. Wear, a former 
staff member on a committee headed by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), said it was 
his decision to propose the funding reduction for CRLA. 
</P>
<P>
Wear said his actions are motivated by "federal law," not ideology, and 
proposed the funding cut because the firm "ran afoul of the statutes on 
abortion." 
</P>
<P>
Wear proposed cutting CRLA's budget by up to 9.95%. A 10% reduction, he 
acknowledged, would entitle CRLA, under Legal Services bylaws, to a full 
hearing before the agency's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
The poverty law firm's only recourse is to respond in writing to the charges in 
Wear's letter. CRLA officials said they plan to request a full hearing anyway 
-- before an independent hearing examiner -- but if they are refused, they will 
file suit against the agency. 
</P>
<P>
CRLA, which has 15 field offices throughout the state, receives 80% of its 
funding from Legal Services. 
</P>
<P>
CRLA and the National Health Law Program filed suit last year against the state 
on behalf of four plaintiffs: the Economic Opportunity Commission of San Luis 
Obispo, which sponsors a family planning clinic, two patients at the clinic and 
Dr. Dan Lickness, who works there as a volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleged that the $24 million cut from the state's 500 clinics violated 
state welfare law that provides for family planning services to all women who 
request it. 
</P>
<P>
Lickness, who is a member of two anti-abortion organizations and is "personally 
opposed to abortion on demand," said he would not work at a clinic that 
promotes abortion. Family planning clinics, he said, prevent abortions by 
preventing unwanted pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
The family planning clinics throughout the state provide an array of services 
for poor women, including birth control services, Pap smears to detect cervical 
cancer, breast exams and tests for sexually transmitted diseases and the AIDS 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
Janice Wolf, program supervisor for the San Luis Obispo family planning clinic, 
said her clinic gives pregnant women a sheet of paper listing all their 
options. 
</P>
<P>
"We're publicly funded and according to both state and federal guidelines we 
have to give women all the options," she said. "If we left one of these options 
out we'd be violating our own funding regulations."

LINDEN, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every spring, Linda and Peter Lindberg meticulously select their seed, place it 
by hand into the San Joaquin Valley loam, nurture the crop -- and wait eagerly 
for the first frost to kill their handiwork. 
</P>
<P>
It is, in its way, absurd. But it is the life of an average gourd grower. 
</P>
<P>
The Lindbergs, however, are not average gourders. They are, in the minds of 
many, the finest gourd growers in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Their smooth, shapely bottle gourds, canteen gourds, Nigerian kettle gourds and 
other varieties are coveted by folk artisans and ethnic musicians from the 
Ozarks to the New York Philharmonic for their remarkable quality and beauty. 
</P>
<P>
Their produce is not to eat, but to fashion into works of art. In the small but 
ordered world of gourd-workers, the Lindbergs' fare has the reputation for 
making the finest ethnic rhythm instruments and most beautiful folk-art pieces 
around. 
</P>
<P>
Even artists who grow their own gourds in the eternal quest for the perfect 
dried, woody vegetable concede that they inevitably return to tiny Linden -- to 
the metal shed that constitutes the Lindbergs' "Gourd Factory" -- whenever they 
can't settle for less than perfection. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just the best," said Yael Powell, co-owner with her husband, Doug, of 
Rhythm Makers, a Eureka Springs, Ark., manufacturer of kalimbas, or African 
thumb drums. "Their gourds are real consistent -- thick shell, well cared for, 
very clean. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried growers all over the country -- in Florida, Georgia, Louisiana -- 
and we always come back to (the Lindbergs)." 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of California's gourds, perhaps the most whimsical specialty 
crop in a state famous for specialty crops, rests on two things, the Lindbergs 
said. One is consistent shape, the result of careful plant breeding. The other 
is the gourds' thick and unblemished shells, the result of careful growing and 
San Joaquin County's long, slow growing season. 
</P>
<P>
"We set the worldwide standard for quality, and the worldwide standard for 
price," said Peter. 
</P>
<P>
He would brook no arguments from his delighted customers, and none from the 
American Gourd Society, the club for only discerning calabash connoisseurs. The 
3,000-member society, based in Mt. Gilead, Ohio, recently hailed the Lindbergs 
in its quarterly journal, The Gourd. 
</P>
<P>
Lest anyone scoff -- and the Lindbergs said that many of the neighboring nut 
growers and vegetable farmers do indeed scoff at their unorthodox crop -- Linda 
said some of their prime examples of Lagenaria siceraria, or bottle gourd, can 
fetch up to $40 apiece. Individual orders for hundreds of gourds worth $25,000 
or $30,000 are not uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
Most, of course, sell for far less. Some small gourds, barely larger than an 
egg, can be had for 50 cents. But the relatively high prices -- no farmer sells 
individual tomatoes for anything close to 50 cents, much less $40 -- illustrate 
the patient care that goes into the Lindbergs' gourd growing. 
</P>
<P>
Seeds must be collected and catalogued by hand each spring, as the previous 
year's crop is brought in from the field. A new grower must be contracted for, 
because gourds pull so much nitrogen from the soil that gourds cannot be grown 
well in the same field twice in a row, Linda said. 
</P>
<P>
The seeds -- many of which are the size of small arrowheads and too large for a 
mechanical planter -- must be placed in the earth by hand, at the right depth 
and distance from one another. The plants must be precisely watered and weeded 
to discourage insects. Bugs scar the gourds and insecticides wither them. 
</P>
<P>
Frost -- which kills the vines and starts the process in which the inedible, 
melon-plump ripe gourds dry into their useful, woody state -- must come after 
the gourds thicken and mature, but must come soon enough to let them thoroughly 
dry by spring. 
</P>
<P>
Drying is done on the vine, but must be watched closely to make sure gourds do 
not dry too fast or overheat in the scorching Central Valley sun, phenomena 
that can cause gourds to burst or split. 
</P>
<P>
Harvesting is done by hand, as well, to cull inferior specimens and protect 
marketable gourds from blemishes. Once the annual harvest of 100,000 gourds are 
deposited behind the Lindberg homestead, they are carefully processed in small 
batches to remove the ashen skin of mold that collects on them. 
</P>
<P>
They are then taken inside the metal shed to be sized, marked, packed and 
shipped -- all by hand. The Lindbergs and a small cadre of employees spend most 
of the entire year working or worrying about the gourds. A new crop is planted 
each spring as soon as the last one is harvested. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't worry too much about competition," said Linda. "It is too much work." 
</P>
<P>
And not always profitable. A disastrous 1986, when a poor crop not only did in 
that year's gourd shipments but also the next year's seed stocks, convinced the 
Lindbergs to diversify. They now also grow another quirky specialty crop -- 
microwaveable, multicolored popcorn-on-the-cob. 
</P>
<P>
Linda backed into the gourd game in the late 1970s after she and her first 
husband left Corona del Mar for what they thought would be the simpler, easier 
life of farming. Unable to pursue her old floral wholesale business so distant 
from major markets, she began selling battered milk cans and lug boxes to city 
folks, calling them country decorator items. 
</P>
<P>
A local grower, impressed with her sales skills and eager to build a market for 
his new specialty crop, challenged her to peddle the odd-looking gourds he was 
starting to harvest. She pitched them as planters, but failed. 
</P>
<P>
Discouraged after an especially disappointing Los Angeles trade show, Linda 
said, she was about to quit the gourd business when a man approached her to ask 
if she could supply his chain of Native American-themed Southwest gift shops. 
</P>
<P>
Once in a gourd groove, she met Wilbur Bradley, a National City gourd grower 
who is venerated -- even now, years after his death -- as the "Gourd King." 
Linda said Bradley shared with her his secret for growing the superior gourds 
sought by the manufacturers of a Hawaiian musical instrument called the ipu and 
by other Polynesian artisans. 
</P>
<P>
That introduced the Lindbergs to the makers of other gourd-dependent ethnic 
musical instruments -- African skekeres and mbiras, Cuban guiros, and Brazilian 
berimbaus, among others. Their clients range from the Women of the Calabash to 
the percussion section of the New York Philharmonic, as well as craftsmen, 
American Indians and others who whittle, gouge or paint gourds into everything 
from sculpture to masks to talismans. 
</P>
<P>
"Their gourds are the best -- beautiful, beautiful gourds," said Karenlee 
Spencer, a Charleston, Ill., artisan who supplements her own crop with gourds 
from the Lindbergs. "They are hard, thick and perfect. I don't know how they do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Spencer uses the figure-8-shaped bottle gourds to produce dolls, from Uncle Sam 
to Santa Claus, that can be seen at the Museum of American Folk Art in New York 
or bought at Goods from the Woods, the company she runs with her husband, 
Chuck. He uses gourds to make Indian-influenced spirit pots, jewelry and other 
items. 
</P>
<P>
The Lindbergs ship gourds throughout North America as well as to two other 
continents, Australia and Europe. Through her volunteer work as international 
outreach coordinator for California Women for Agriculture, Linda has even been 
able to sell some gourds to visiting farmers from Africa -- birthplace of the 
gourd. 
</P>
<P>
"I know, I know -- coals to Newcastle; refrigerators to Eskimos. I've heard 
them all," she said with a laugh.

FESTIVAL AT JAPAN AMERICAN CULTURE CENTER PROVES A SIZZLING SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
At 1 p.m. Sunday, there wasn't enough breeze to budge the balloon arches that 
festooned the plaza at the Japan American Culture Center in downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It was hot outdoors, verging on beastly. And Jack Shakely, director of the 
California Community Foundation, was worried. 
</P>
<P>
The free, multicultural festival scheduled from 1 to 5 p.m. was to be a 75th 
birthday party for the CCF, which has endowments of $90 million and gives away 
$10 million each year to Californians involved in the arts, education, 
environment, health, human services and public affairs. But what if nobody 
came? 
</P>
<P>
Dressed for the tropics in navy polo shirt and khaki shorts, Shakeley surveyed 
the near-empty plaza with food tents ready to serve those not yet there, and 
chairs set up in front of an empty outdoor stage. He explained that this was 
CCF's first attempt at a multicultural street festival of the arts, and "it 
will probably be our last." 
</P>
<P>
By 3 p.m. he had changed his tune. And by 5, with the plaza filled, he thought 
maybe this should be an annual affair. 
</P>
<P>
Shakely's expertise as head of the under-publicized foundation is, as he puts 
it, "to know what the community needs and to invest in those things." And what 
the community needs, it became apparent on Sunday, is a festival where people 
can congregate, free of charge, to celebrate the cultural diversity and 
creative energies of Los Angeles' most talented new artists. Actors, dancers, 
poets, musicians, composers and performance artists of many stripes offered 
their creations to an audience which responded with joy and gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
All who entertained were recipients of grants from the CCF. The impassioned 
monologue of actor Roger G. Smith was an excerpt from a work in progress about 
a self-educated slave, "Frederick Douglass Now." It will be presented at the 
Inner City Cultural Foundation later this year, with help from a CCF grant. 
(Smith, who grew up in the Crenshaw area of Los Angeles, played the stuttering 
Smiley in Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing.") 
</P>
<P>
Also on the outdoor stage were a variety of ethnic dance troupes (Peruvian, 
Persian, African, Croation), including a rousing crowd pleaser, Trinidadian 
limbo dancer Perry Hernandez. All now live and work in California. 
</P>
<P>
As food lines lengthened and outdoor action continued, performances of a more 
delicate nature took place in the air-conditioned Japan America Theater that 
opens onto the plaza. Actor-writer Michael Kearns presented excerpts from his 
solo performance piece, "more intimacies," in which he portrays a priest with 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Rhapsody in Taps tap-danced to jazz; The Theatre Workers Project presented 
seven Latino immigrant workers never on stage before, in a piece focusing on 
their lives and aspirations. Cold Tofu (a comedy improvisation group), the Lula 
Washington/Los Angeles Contemporary Dance Theater and the Koto String Society 
were among other groups who performed indoors. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd eventually swelled to between 1,000 and 3,000 people; civilized 
people who didn't push, shout or litter and many of whom said they'd like to 
come back if the event were held again. 
</P>
<P>
"I envisioned 500,000 people here, fighting for 300 parking places. But it 
wasn't like that at all," said Michelle deLude, a writer for the auto club. 
Lois Arkin didn't worry about parking, because she pedaled downtown to the 
festival on her bicycle. Arkin loved the entertainment and food, she said, but 
worried that the "elegant" clear plastic plates on which it was served might 
not be recycled.

TESTS FOR DE KLERK

<TEXT>
<P>
South Africa's four-year-old state of emergency expires next Monday, and there 
is speculation it either will not be renewed or will be extended in sharply 
curtailed form. Either option would presumably help pave the way for 
negotiations with the African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, voters in the coastal town of Umlazi, near Durban, go to the polls 
to fill a vacant seat in Parliament in what amounts to the first referendum on 
President Frederik W. de Klerk's reforms since last September's general 
elections brought his ruling National Party back into power.

<TEXT>
<P>
Peruvians elect their next president Sunday, and the winner is certain to be a 
man making his first run for public office. 
</P>
<P>
Agronomist and university administrator Alberto Fujimori, a centrist with 
vaguely defined proposals for economic reform, is the surprise front-runner in 
the two-man runoff ballot. Famed novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, offering a more 
detailed -- and harsher -- program for a pure free-market economy, is trailing 
in the polls but narrowing the gap. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever wins will confront galloping inflation, a leftist guerrilla war, abuses 
of human rights and widespread coca cultivation in the jungle interior.

NEW 'OPIUM WAR' CUTS ACROSS THE THIRD WORLD; 
</P>
<P>
THE CURRENT STRUGGLE IS OVER TOBACCO AS WESTERN FIRMS EYE GROWING MARKETS 
ABROAD TO REPLACE SHRINKING DEMAND AT HOME. THEY FACE OPPOSITION FROM LOCAL 
GROWERS, HEALTH ADVOCATES. 
</P>

BEIJING 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Across East Asia and through much of the developing world, a battle is raging 
that some are calling a new Opium War. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's victory in that 19th-Century conflict enabled its traders to continue 
exchanging Indian opium for Chinese tea and silk, making huge profits while 
devastating China. 
</P>
<P>
Today's fight is over tobacco. Western firms, faced with declining demand at 
home, are seeking to expand overseas. But they face fierce resistance from 
local tobacco industries, nationalist advocates of protective farm policies and 
outraged anti-smoking activists. 
</P>
<P>
Lines are drawn for growing political conflict within and between nations. In 
the United States and Europe, those opposing the trade on health and ethical 
grounds are sharpening their attacks on tobacco defenders. Internationally, 
some tobacco disputes are escalating and more are waiting to erupt. 
</P>
<P>
The new Tobacco Wars sometimes reveal sparks of humor, as when leaflets passed 
out at a rally outside the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand, declared: "If 
smokers have to die, they should die with Thai tobacco." 
</P>
<P>
But the battles are mostly serious. 
</P>
<P>
Approximately 500 million people alive today will die of tobacco-caused 
diseases, according to an estimate presented by Richard Peto, an Oxford 
University cancer expert, at an April conference on tobacco and health held in 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government, viewing tobacco sales as a trade issue, has weighed in on 
the side of the tobacco firms, using the threat of trade sanctions to force 
markets open in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration is due to decide in November whether to impose punitive 
tariffs on Thailand for refusing to open its cigarette market to foreign 
brands. Before then, officials of the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade will examine the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The tobacco industry argues that it is only seeking fair access to existing 
markets, not creating new smokers overseas. Some also note that American and 
European cigarettes often have less tar than local brands common in developing 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
But with each new inroad, opponents become more vocal. Opium War imagery adds 
power to their cause. 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's anti-smoking activist David Yen, who lost a lung to cancer in 1972, 
has been compared to Lin Zexu, the Qing Dynasty official who led the anti-opium 
campaign that touched off that long-ago conflict with England. 
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, where resistance to foreign cigarettes has strong nationalistic 
overtones, anti-imports leader Kang Moon Kyu told the Hong Kong-based Far 
Eastern Economic Review that the key issue is protection of tobacco farmers, 
and "health is secondary." 
</P>
<P>
But Kang, too, reached back to the powerful old image. "This is Korea's version 
of the Opium War," he said. 
</P>
<P>
People like Yen and Kang are finding increasingly vocal allies in the richer 
developed countries. 
</P>
<P>
Tobacco companies are "marketing death in the Third World," American Cancer 
Society chief executive William Tipping declared at the April health conference 
held in Perth, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"American corporations are the carriers of an epidemic, and our government has 
become a willing instrument for the enforced export of that epidemic," Tipping 
said. "Those of us from America can only feel ashamed at our Administration's 
role in undermining world health." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. tobacco exports are booming. American firms shipped nearly $5 billion 
worth of tobacco products overseas in 1989, according to a study released in 
April by the Tobacco Merchants Assn. of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
At a health conference in Boston late last month, former U.S. Surgeon General 
C. Everett Koop called the rise in tobacco exports "a moral outrage." 
</P>
<P>
Koop noted that while smoking in the United States dropped 5% last year, U.S. 
tobacco exports rose 20%. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe the United States will ever again be a good market for 
tobacco products," Koop said. "The curve is going down and accelerating. But if 
we feel good because we have beaten the cigarette industry on its own turf, we 
must realize that we've driven them to scour the rest of the earth for new 
victims." 
</P>
<P>
The tobacco issue is also heating up in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
London's Sunday Times reported last month that thousands of tons of high-tar 
tobacco is being exported from European Community countries to developing 
nations at low, taxpayer-subsidized prices. 
</P>
<P>
Such exports are expected to grow once a new ruling comes into effect at the 
end of 1992 banning the sale within the European Community of any cigarettes 
containing more than 15 milligrams of tar, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
"It is totally unacceptable, and against all ethics, for the European Community 
to dump high-tar tobacco on the Third World," Roberto Masironi, head of a World 
Health Organization program on tobacco and health, commented in the Sunday 
Times report. Keith Ball, a chest surgeon and adviser to the World Health 
Organization, told the Sunday Times that today's European tobacco exports, much 
of which go to Africa, will eventually bring sharply increased cancer rates 
there. "We have lit the fuse," he said. "We're just waiting for the explosion." 
</P>
<P>
Those who focus not on health issues but on tobacco's contribution to exporting 
countries' balance of payments often take a very different view. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. tobacco industry lobbying group called COMET (Coalition for Open Markets 
and Expanded Trade) recently noted that "in the face of the chronic American 
foreign trade deficit, the U.S. tobacco export industry has steadily increased 
its foreign trade surplus, ending 1989 with a net surplus of $4.3 billion." 
</P>
<P>
Despite this growing trade surplus, U.S. cigarette exports account for less 
than 3% of worldwide consumption, according to COMET. 
</P>
<P>
In an April statement on tobacco exports, Dean Kleckner, president of the 
American Farm Bureau Federation, praised the growth in overseas sales as 
benefiting American farmers and the U.S. economy. "The success of tobacco has 
meant thousands of jobs in this country and has provided many farm families a 
good income." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration says it respects health restrictions that foreign 
governments place on smoking and cigarette sales, but that when a country 
allows domestic firms to sell cigarettes, foreign producers should have the 
same opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, however, sometimes has attacked other countries' 
restrictions on cigarette advertising, further angering anti-smoking forces. 
Tobacco industry officials and Administration policy-makers argue that, because 
imports have long been shut out, American cigarette makers must advertise in 
these countries to let people know their products are available. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-smoking activists in developing nations usually view such advertising as 
anathema. 
</P>
<P>
In Latin America, tobacco advertising "is everywhere, at all times -- theaters, 
opera houses, many sporting events, popular concerts," Carlos Alvarez Herrera, 
president of the Argentina-based Latin America Coordinating Council on Smoking 
Control, complained at the recent Boston conference. 
</P>
<P>
Some, however, believe that by introducing a nationalistic element to the 
tobacco issue, Western firms are provoking developing countries to look more 
seriously at the question of tobacco and health. 
</P>
<P>
"The Western blitzkrieg . . . seems to have backfired," reported Asiaweek, a 
Hong Kong-based magazine. "Asian opinion seems to have tipped toward seeing a 
commercial dispute as an issue of public health." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills, sticking to the view that this 
is still a commercial dispute, recently defended the American stance this way: 
"In a situation in which a foreign government judges it acceptable to sell 
cigarettes to its citizens, we see no basis for refraining from ensuring equal 
access for U.S. cigarette manufacturers. The sale of cigarettes is legal in the 
United States and legal in those markets in which we have challenged their 
practices." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), speaking at the recent health conference in 
Boston, ridiculed Hills' stance. "Carla Hills is supposed to be the U.S. trade 
representative," he declared, "not the U.S. cancer representative." 
</P>
<P>
The General Accounting Office, Congress' own watchdog agency, issued a mid-May 
report noting that American health and trade policies appear to be in conflict. 
The report noted that "if Congress believes that health considerations should 
have primacy," it has the option of enacting laws to bring that about. So far, 
one such bill has been introduced. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tobacco companies continue to develop markets even in countries 
where U.S. pressure is not yet a major issue. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris Asia Inc., for example, recently sponsored a Beijing exhibit of 
its Formula One racing cars. A few days later, sports officials and a Philip 
Morris representative appeared at a news conference in the Great Hall of the 
People to announce the Marlboro Dynasty Cup soccer tournament, which will bring 
together teams from North Korea, South Korea, China and Japan in Beijing this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
A reporter at the news conference asked for a response to criticism in the 
United States and elsewhere that, since cigarettes are not good for health, 
companies should not try to develop new markets in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Leiber, Hong Kong-based marketing coordinator for Philip Morris, replied 
that Marlboro helps "put sports on the map in countries that otherwise wouldn't 
have the opportunity to compete at this level." 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of our visibility as a company," she added, "we take great pride in 
the knowledge that we market a legal product around the world." 
</P>
<P>
Organizations such as the London-based International Tobacco Growers Assn. are 
also fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
"Evidence from a number of major authoritative studies has emphasized the 
economic and social importance of tobacco growing for many developing 
countries," Alan F. Ravenscroft, chairman of the growers association, wrote in 
an association report on tobacco in the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet anti-tobacco policies are being designed to reduce and even eliminate the 
use of tobacco by the year 2000," Ravenscroft continued. "Little allowance 
appears to have been made for the very significant losses in jobs, 
foreign-exchange earnings and revenue that would result if these policies were 
ever implemented. As a consequence of these losses, many developing countries 
would face serious problems of social instability and economic ruin." 
</P>
<P>
The report estimates that 33 million people engage in tobacco growing 
worldwide, 90% of them in the developing countries. Including their families, 
about 100 million people derive their livelihoods from tobacco cultivation, the 
study says. 
</P>
<P>
The world's leading tobacco grower is China, which produced 2.9 million tons in 
1989, about 40% of the world total. This is slightly more than four times the 
production of the United States, which ranks No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Market penetration by foreign brands remains at just 1% in China, which still 
severely restricts cigarette imports. 
</P>
<P>
The tobacco issue in China may ultimately be of greater significance than in 
any other country. Most Chinese men are heavy smokers. Offering cigarettes is 
an important social ritual, and few people take the risk of cancer very 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has recently given some support to anti-smoking efforts, 
and the Chinese media are beginning to be aware of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
A recent report by the official New China News Agency quoted World Health 
Organization figures showing that tobacco-related diseases now take about 2.7 
million lives per year worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
"Predictions for the future are grim," it added. "Of all the children alive 
today in China under 20 years of age, it is estimated that 50 million will die 
from the effects of tobacco use." 
</P>
<P>
The news agency reported last month that survey results show 37% of high school 
boys and just 2% of high school girls in China are smokers. The report added, 
without giving details, that China is drafting laws "to control the dangers of 
tobacco." 
</P>
<P>
No-smoking signs are beginning to appear in airport departure lounges and on 
some trains. But they are often disregarded. Virtually no one in China has any 
concept of personal rights to clean air. 
</P>
<P>
"In America, you cannot smoke anywhere -- not at work, not in airplanes, not in 
restaurants," marveled an elderly Chinese man who recently visited relatives in 
the United States. "In China, you can smoke everywhere, even if there's a law 
against it. That's why all the American tobacco companies have started to sell 
in China. They can make more money here. You can't smoke American cigarettes in 
America, but you can in China!"

NOW ARRIVING IN ISRAEL, A WEALTH OF NEW TALENT; 
</P>
<P>
THE CURRENT CROP OF SOVIET IMMIGRANTS ARE CALLED THE BEST EDUCATED GROUP EVER 
TO COME TO ISRAEL. THE QUESTION: HOW BEST TO USE THEIR ABILITIES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

JERUSALEM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a riddle current in Jerusalem that reflects the great expectations of 
the massive wave of Soviet immigration into Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Question: What do you call a Soviet immigrant who is not an engineer or a 
physician? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: A computer programmer. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, the Soviet newcomers are the best educated -- especially in 
science -- ever to come in a bunch to Israel. The unprecedented infusion of 
talent has raised hopes that a golden age of technology is about to commence in 
a country that since its birth put a high priority on knowledge as the key to 
national development. 
</P>
<P>
But there is another, more serious riddle also making the rounds -- one with no 
answer yet: How to tap this new resource? Israel is small, and it is difficult 
for even its home-grown technical graduates to find work. Many professionals go 
abroad every year where grants and salaries are bigger and more plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
One Israeli company thinks it has the answer to this dilemma of riches and is 
pressing the government to help -- through incentives. It is Satec, a small 
research and development firm located in Jerusalem and manned in part by Soviet 
Jews who came in migrations past. 
</P>
<P>
Founded three years ago with a $2-million investment from an Australian 
millionaire, Satec is a hybrid: Soviet researchers working under the direction 
of Western managers to produce new ideas and products for export. Of the 
company's 70 employees, half are Soviet immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Satec currently produces compact digital electric power meters, heating 
elements for home and industry and new nontoxic methods of extracting precious 
metals from waste. Managers say the company is soon to break even on sales this 
year of about $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe we're a model. If there are no steps to absorb this immigration 
properly, the country will have a crisis. If we take special measures, it will 
benefit the whole economy," said Daniel Branover, president of Satec and son of 
the founder, Herman, who has been active for many years in supplying Jewish 
books to Jews in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Satec was established specifically to soak up high-tech newcomers at a time 
when the vast majority of Soviet migrants were choosing the United States over 
Israel as their new home. But three factors altered that pattern. The Soviet 
Union, under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, greatly liberalized emigration, 
fears of anti-Semitic outbreaks began to spread in the country and, finally, 
the United States limited the numbers of Soviet Jews who could go to America. 
</P>
<P>
This year, more than 100,000 Soviets are expected to settle in Israel, eight 
times the number that came in all of 1989. The immigrants are coming whether 
Israel is their first choice or not. There is no grand scheme in place to 
employ them. Gone are the days when the government, through affiliated unions 
and state-owned farms and industries, could place workers at will. The old 
companies are in decline and being sold off. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, Israel is caught between two ideological worlds: the fading 
socialist origins of the nation and the new wave of free-market thinking. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Satec's mission has also changed. Company managers say firms like 
Satec should be encouraged to employ the newcomers in imaginative ways. Israel, 
for instance, could become a leader in exporting research and development under 
contract: a company abroad could give the Israelis a problem to solve and then 
take the solution and turn it into a product back home. 
</P>
<P>
"Israel cannot compete with the countries of Asia in manufacturing, but we can 
become a center for technology and ideas," Branover predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Branover believes that investment in Satec clones should be encouraged through 
government matching funds. If someone puts up money for a research and 
development company, then the government should, too, without going into 
laborious feasibility studies. "If an investor wants to invest $10 million, 
that should be enough insurance," Branover said. "Sure, there may be a few 
flops, but this is an emergency situation. We have to take risks. The 
government should stand back and let us work." 
</P>
<P>
Branover also thinks that the government, mired as it has been in political 
wrangling, is hopelessly tangled in red tape and Cabinet rivalries. He suggests 
an immigration czar who could approve new housing -- and industrial investment 
-- without having to horse-trade with numerous ministries and municipal 
bureaucracies. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir visited Satec in early May and was presented such 
a proposal. He said he would think about it. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet employees at Satec say that finding suitable work for their compatriots 
is a key to the success of this immigration. In the past, they pointed out, 
Soviet newcomers were committed to Israel through nationalistic yearnings and 
thus were patient with the vagaries of their new home. Many of the new 
arrivals, on the other hand, did not necessarily want to leave the Soviet Union 
-- at least not until they smelled trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"This immigration is quite different," said Vladimir Kislik, a metallurgist who 
was persecuted for 16 years in the Soviet Union for his desire to leave for 
Israel. "The new ones come not for love of Israel but for fear of the U.S.S.R. 
If there is a problem here, will they wait or pack their bags and go somewhere 
else?" 
</P>
<P>
Added researcher Yaacov Katz: "The Soviets will not be happy to be sent to 
raise chickens in the desert. They will want to use their skills."

HOW PRAVDA'S TOP EDITOR PAID THE PRICE OF PICKING ON YELTSIN

<P>
In the typically Byzantine ways of journalism Soviet style, the man now at 
Pravda's helm owes his job at least in part to Communist Party gadfly and 
populist Boris N. Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
When Yeltsin, now Russia's president, was in the United States last September, 
Pravda reprinted an Italian newspaper article claiming he was shopping and 
boozing his way across America -- for him, "a bar 5,000 kilometers long." 
</P>
<P>
The front-page article was an obvious attempt to hurt Yeltsin's standing, but 
it backfired badly. Yeltsin denounced the story as "delirium," and his 
popularity only kept rising. In an apparently unprecedented episode in the 
annals of Soviet journalism, Pravda publicly apologized, saying that its 
accusations were unsubstantiated. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, Viktor G. Afanasyev, the editor-in-chief since 1976, was 
transferred to unspecified "scientific work" and replaced by Ivan T. Frolov, 
Gorbachev's handpicked adviser on ideological issues during the previous two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The Yeltsin affair may have been the last straw for Afanasyev -- under his 
tutelage, Pravda had been losing credibility with many readers for its 
distortions or one-sided reporting on ethnic disputes in the Caucasus and 
Baltic republics and for attacks on party reformers. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, a member of the party Central Committee that is Pravda's publisher, 
remains on the outs with the Kremlin hierarchy, but by conviction or cold 
calculation, Pravda now treats him more gingerly. 
</P>
<P>
When he was elected the new president of the Russian Federation last week, 
Yeltsin's name was back on Pravda's front page -- this time in a matter-of-fact 
account of his victory.

For inquiring Ivans worried about the future, the organ of the Communist Party 
produced a presumably qualified source: the official spokesman of the 
400-year-old Russian Order of Sorcerers. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, the sorcerer prophesied to Pravda on a recent weekend that the 
Soviet Union would overcome its economic difficulties within five years, 
possibly assisted by beings he said were circling the globe in flying saucers. 
</P>
<P>
Now citing black magic, and not just Marxism, the newspaper founded in 1912 to 
promote Communist revolution in Russia has a new look and style, although its 
front page still carries the call "Workers of the World, Unite!" 
</P>
<P>
This year, Vladimir I. Lenin's journalistic offspring has been experimenting 
with color -- but only one color at a time -- on Sundays. One day last month, 
most of Pravda's last page was covered with paid advertisements, including one 
for the West German airline Lufthansa. Forerunners of the current editors would 
no doubt have denounced it all as capitalist propaganda. But not now. "We're 
being offered $30,000 or more per advertisement," Pravda's editor in chief, 
Ivan T. Frolov, noted recently, his pride evident. 
</P>
<P>
Frolov, a philosopher and former adviser to Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, was parachuted into the editor's chair last October. He is not a 
journalist in the Western sense. But like a socialist version of British 
publisher Rupert Murdoch, he has begun to dream of founding a multi-media 
empire to convey the Communist Party line to the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to have a unified printing house, a sort of publishing 
amalgamation," Frolov, 60, said during a recent visit to Los Angeles. "Of 
course, this amalgamation would also have its own television station -- Pravda 
Television. 
</P>
<P>
"To do all this, I'd need $1 billion to $2 billion," the white-haired Frolov 
added wistfully. 
</P>
<P>
The use of blue ink to print headlines on Sundays, the article about Russian 
sorcery, and Frolov's vision of a Pravda-based publishing empire spring from 
the same impetus: the collapse of Pravda's readership under glasnost and the 
emerging new rules of the Soviet media game. 
</P>
<P>
From 11 million, the circulation of the flagship party daily has plummeted to 
around 6.5 million, although Frolov says it is now showing a modest rise. 
Soviet newspaper readership on the whole is down -- "glasnost has allowed the 
printing of bad news, and people are now tired of it," Frolov says -- but a 
number of papers still print in the millions. And Pravda's readership is now 
dwarfed by the 20-million circulations of Komsomolskaya Pravda, the more daring 
Communist youth daily, and Trud, a paper printed by the labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
The political implications of this must be worrisome to party officials in 
charge of propaganda. Now that other political parties are legal in the Soviet 
Union, the Communist Party Central Committee, Pravda's publisher of record, 
must learn to sell its ideas in the marketplace. And if Pravda's fall from 
grace is any indication, it needs to retool its sales pitch. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 1, a "new look" Pravda appeared, with eight pages instead of six, a 
portrait of a left-looking Lenin beside the nameplate and a splashier and 
bolder design, although one that would still look dense and gray beside most 
Western dailies. 
</P>
<P>
The paper resumed printing a "Discussion Sheet" of various points of view on 
current affairs, a favorite feature of one of Frolov's predecessors, Nikolai 
Bukharin, who was purged by Josef Stalin in the 1930s and later executed. 
</P>
<P>
This month, a "Pravda festival" was held at exposition grounds in north Moscow 
to bring together editors, readers and VIPs, including Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"I find nothing more refreshing than good analysis," Frolov told the Moscow 
press corps when it assembled in Pravda's offices last fall to hear what plans 
he would pursue as editor. 
</P>
<P>
But the appointment of the former chief of the party theoretical journal 
Kommunist has done nothing readily apparent to make much of Pravda's contents 
more decipherable to the average Soviet citizen. For example, take that weekend 
issue in which Pravda quoted self-described Russian wizard Yuri V. Tarasov -- 
although without endorsing his views. 
</P>
<P>
On that day, U.S. dailies topped their front page with news of the superpowers 
agreeing during Secretary of State James A. Baker III's visit to Moscow on 
limits for air- and sea-launched cruise missiles, a key issue in a new 
strategic arms treaty with important implications for the coming U.S.-Soviet 
summit. 
</P>
<P>
Pravda put the story on Page 5, where, it is true, it is customary to find 
foreign-related news. But reproducing a Tass dispatch, its long report began: 
"The talks with U.S.A. State Secretary J. Baker exceeded the calculated agenda, 
although this time from the very beginning they had been scheduled to last 
longer than usual." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on Page 1, Pravda printed a long, complex presidential decree from 
Gorbachev ordering the use of new ways to solve the nation's critical housing 
shortage. All it published was the three-column text of the decree itself; 
readers were left to figure out for themselves what it might mean to them. 
</P>
<P>
Pravda, whose name means "the truth," is still considered by many Soviet 
citizens to be overly timid and conservative. In times of crisis, such as the 
current dispute over Lithuanian secession, its reports customarily avoid 
completeness and objectivity to highlight official Kremlin thinking instead. 
</P>
<P>
When the Communist Party holds its national congress this summer, Pravda's 
contents and the issue of its control are certain to be hotly debated topics. 
In an article Monday, Pravda special correspondent Stanislav Oganyan said a 
party paper's future is defined "in the creative interaction of journalists and 
party workers," meaning that Communist Party ideologues, as well as editors, 
will be charting Pravda's course at least in the near term. 
</P>
<P>
But as radical publications such as the weeklies Ogonyok and Moscow News wage 
war on hard-line rivals such as the Sovietskaya Rossiya daily or the 
Literaturnaya Gazeta literary journal, some Russians are finding Pravda 
refreshingly dispassionate and above the fray. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like taxes. It may be unpopular, but it's needed," said one middle-aged 
Muscovite, who admits to reading up to 17 newspapers daily, including Pravda.

HIGH NOON IN HOUSTON? WHITE HOUSE FEARS CONFRONTATION;

SUMMIT ALLIES MAY FORCE SHOWDOWN WITH PRESIDENT BUSH OVER GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT.

<TEXT>
<P>
The world economy usually leads the agenda when the leaders of the world's 
seven largest industrial nations hold their annual summit. But when President 
Bush and his six counterparts gather in Houston on July 9, U.S. strategists are 
worried that the others will gang up on him over another issue -- the global 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Western European countries, Japan and Canada already have served 
notice that they consider the environment the summit's most important topic and 
plan to press for international initiatives on a host of issues, from global 
warming to ocean pollution. 
</P>
<P>
But the White House is firmly resisting any dramatic new moves, arguing that 
there is still not enough evidence that these problems are genuine or that they 
merit the massive spending that would be required to deal with them seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The rigid U.S. stance comes on orders from White House Chief of Staff John H. 
Sununu and Budget Director Richard G. Darman, who have drawn a similar line in 
response to demands by domestic environmentalists that the Administration move 
more aggressively on these issues. 
</P>
<P>
The White House position has upset several other top Administration 
policy-makers, who worry that Bush could be isolated at Houston and dealt an 
embarrassing setback -- particularly on efforts to reduce carbon dioxide 
emissions, which are thought to contribute to global warming. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the President may have lost his last ally last week, when British Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher broke with the Administration's go-slow policies on 
carbon dioxide emissions and agreed to join in global efforts to stabilize them 
by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
"The Europeans have been very specific on what they'd like to see the summit 
accomplish," said one high-ranking U.S. official. "This isn't something that it 
will be easy for the U.S. to brush aside. These folks regard the issue as 
important, and they're unlikely to back off." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Bush, the summit leaders are Britain's Thatcher, West German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl, Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, French President Francois 
Mitterrand, Italian Premier Giulio Andreotti and Canadian Prime Minister Brian 
Mulroney. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to tackling environmental issues, the summiteers are also expected 
to intensify the pressure to complete the current global trade-liberalization 
talks and to consider new moves to help the Soviet Union and the emerging 
democracies in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But strategists concede that the biggest potential for a U.S. rift with its 
allies is over the environment. "If the summit is to have any credibility on 
this issue, then there has to be something more responsive than what Washington 
is willing to back," a foreign official said. 
</P>
<P>
If the Bush Administration is isolated at the Houston summit, it would mark the 
first time in recent memory that the other industrial countries have dealt a 
major setback to the United States on an initiative that U.S. leaders 
vigorously opposed. 
</P>
<P>
The summit leaders will take no votes and adopt no resolutions. But they can 
mobilize the pressure of world opinion on the United States if they can show 
that Bush alone resisted the sort of worldwide cooperation that is thought 
necessary to combat some of the globe's environmental woes. 
</P>
<P>
Highest on the European leaders' environmental priority list is a declaration 
of support for the effort to head off global climate change by cracking down on 
carbon-dioxide emissions, in preparation for signing an international protocol 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Summit participants also hope to gain support for a new World Bank plan that 
would set up a special lending pool to help poor countries tackle their 
environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
And they want Washington to back the creation of an international fund designed 
to help less-developed countries pay for altering their factories and equipment 
so that they can phase out the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which deplete 
the atmosphere's protective ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bush Administration has expressed opposition to each of these 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
The President singled out the plan for immediate action to cope with global 
climate change at a White House-sponsored international conference earlier this 
year, saying the need had not yet been proved beyond doubt. The Treasury 
Department recently refused to back the World Bank plan. And U.S. negotiators, 
at a meeting in Geneva in mid-May, declined to join a new multilateral fund for 
helping developing countries rid themselves of CFCs. Washington's share would 
have been $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Europeans will not be the only ones pressuring the Administration. U.S. 
environmental groups have set up a summit-nations accountability project 
designed to spotlight the Houston meeting and keep up the pressure for 
more-sweeping change.

DEUKMEJIAN SEIZES CHANCE, PLEADS CASE OF ANCESTRAL PEOPLE; 
</P>
<P>
ARMENIANS: THE GOVERNOR HAS A 'MINI-SUMMIT' WITH THE SOVIET LEADER, WHO PROVED 
WELL-VERSED ON CALIFORNIA.

<P>
For George Deukmejian, governor of California and folk hero to thousands of 
Armenians the world over, it was the opportunity of a lifetime: the chance to 
plead the case of his suffering ancestral people to the leader of the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
It was not exactly a summit conference. They met standing in the chill night 
air in a courtyard at the Soviet Consulate, between an iron entry gate and the 
front door. It lasted about seven or eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The time was late -- after 11 p.m., Sunday, which was early morning Monday by 
the body clock of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and he was tired, 
having just flown from Washington with a stop in Minneapolis. So an on-again, 
off-again, delicately negotiated "tea" inside turned into a brief, 
spare-the-small-talk exchange surrounded by floodlights and KGB agents. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a security and logistical nightmare," commented Greg Kahwajian, a 
special assistant to the governor who, among other things, is Deukemejian's 
liaison to California's Armenian-American community, which numbers around 
250,000. That is the largest group of Armenians anywhere outside of the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
And Deukmejian is this nation's highest-ranking elected official of Armenian 
descent. So, even if he did not get invited inside, the governor happily 
grabbed whatever opportunity offered to lobby the Kremlin leader about the 
plight of Soviet Armenians. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, Deukmejian gently lectured Gorbachev about Moscow's need to provide 
more protection for the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh in their long simmering, 
often bloody conflict with the Azerbaijanis in the surrounding republic. He 
also asked for more sensitivity from Soviet troops, who last month killed two 
dozen Armenians whom Moscow characterized as "terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
Armenians living in the enclave want to secede from Azerbaijan and be governed 
by the nearby republic of Soviet Armenia. The conflict continues not just 
between Azerbaijanis and Armenians of both the enclave and the republic, but 
with Soviet troops sent to keep peace between them. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian urged Gorbachev to break up an Azerbaijani blockade of relief 
supplies destined for Armenia to rebuild the republic after its devastation 
from a 1988 earthquake that killed an estimated 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
As Deukmejian stood with Gorbachev and their wives, the Soviet consul general, 
an interpreter and some gubernatorial aides, he began to tell the Soviet 
president of his ancestry -- how his parents had fled the massacres of 
Armenians by Ottoman Turks and come to America early in the century. 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev, according to a Deukmejian aide, interrupted him and said: "Let 
me tell you frankly, governor, that I totally understand your concerns. The 
earthquake was a tragedy. And the violence is very sad. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Later, the aide, trade specialist Jim Robinson, said: "Nobody is reading any 
tea leaves about policy implementation or anything, but the governor is 
convinced there was concern there (by Gorbachev)." 
</P>
<P>
For good measure, Deukmejian handed Gorbachev a personal letter talking about 
the "very tragic history" of Soviet Armenians and "strongly" urging him to 
"ensure" their present safety. The letter also urged peaceful 
self-determination for the Baltic states, and trade between California and the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Indicating he had been well-briefed about the state, Gorbachev also interrupted 
Deukmejian when the governor briefly discussed his desire for more 
California-Soviet trade, observing: "Oh yes, you're a nation within a nation." 
</P>
<P>
This may not have been a summit, but some sticky negotiations went into setting 
it up. According to one adviser who asked not to be identified, the 
back-and-forth went like this: Deukmejian requested a personal meeting and the 
Soviet officials agreed that Gorbachev would present the governor a medal for 
his help in the Armenian earthquake relief effort. Deukmejian had donated 
$100,000 of his personal political funds to relief organizations. 
</P>
<P>
But Deukmejian said no -- if he as an Armenian-American accepted a medal from 
the Soviet Union it could be used as propaganda in Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
"Their two purposes were at loggerheads," said the adviser, speaking of 
Deukmejian and the Soviet government. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a compromise was reached. Deukmejian would accept a medallion on 
behalf of California -- not himself. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian later told reporters he was pleased with the meeting and felt that 
Gorbachev was "very sympathetic to the plight of the Armenian people," adding, 
in reference to ethnic unrest throughout the Soviet Union, "I think it's a very 
difficult situation he's in." 
</P>
<P>
Not all Armenian-Americans in San Francisco were as sympathetic, however. A few 
hundred demonstrators chanted "Gorby-Stalin" near the consulate. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian wound up several hours of being around Gorbachev at various events 
by introducing him at a gala civic luncheon Monday -- and doing it with 
uncharacteristic humor that drew long applause and laughter. 
</P>
<P>
"It occurs to me, Mr. President, that if your father had become a member of the 
Russian settlement at Ft. Ross (in Northern California) and my father had gone 
from Turkish Armenia to Soviet Armenia instead of coming to the United States, 
that our positions would perhaps be reversed," he addressed Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure you would have been elected as governor of California."

"The Hunt for Red Raisa" was playing all over town here Monday.

Like the submarine captain in the movie, Raisa Gorbachev jettisoned many of her

fans, some local police and even the Soviets' local public relations team, 
which finally gave up trying to track the elusive First Lady.

<P>
"A Soviet security woman said she does that all the time," sighed one of the 
public relations men. 
</P>
<P>
After dutifully breakfasting with Nancy Reagan and accompanying Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev to Stanford University, Raisa Gorbachev made the afternoon her own. 
</P>
<P>
She leaped aboard a motorized-tour cable car at Fisherman's Wharf, waving and 
shaking hands with one hand as she held onto a brass pole with the other, as if 
to keep herself from being pulled into the clamoring crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"Want a free ride?" offered tour guide Misty Grey. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting on an oak bench next to Grey, Raisa Gorbachev tugged at her auburn hair 
as she turned down Grey's offer of dinner and a haircut from Grey's hairdresser 
roommate. 
</P>
<P>
"She liked the dinner part, but (said) her hair was already OK," said Grey, 
whose locks are a trendy, short white-blonde. She judged her "a beautiful 
lady." 
</P>
<P>
Raisa Gorbachev pointed to the blocks of souvenir shops; purist San Franciscans 
had moaned when they heard she would visit what one called 'that ticky-tacky 
wharf.' 
</P>
<P>
"Tell me," she asked, "are those stores down there?" 
</P>
<P>
"All the way down," said Grey proudly. 
</P>
<P>
From her black Zil limousine, the First Lady -- wearing the same black-checked 
suit and fuchsia blouse she wore Friday at Wellesley College -- gestured to 
sweatshirt vendor Doris Pedemonte, who wanted to give her a free $10 aqua 
zip-neck sweatshirt that said "San Francisco" in pink. "The cops wouldn't let 
me give it to her -- they shoved me back." 
</P>
<P>
Raisa Gorbachev had dumped the Bank of America and the opera from her hour-late 
itinerary, preferring to stop in at a little grocery, where she was happy to 
hear how well Soviet vodka Stolichnaya was selling. Then she was driven through 
Chinatown and Russian Hill. She was, she said later, "overwhelmed at this 
beautiful city." 
</P>
<P>
"It seems while I was busy in session, she was doing sightseeing," her husband 
said genially, calling hers "people diplomacy." 
</P>
<P>
In fact it was more drive-by diplomacy, part tour of duty, part plain tour. 
Plans were made and plans were dumped; it made Raisa-watching quite iffy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the silliest thing I've ever done," moaned a preteen boy, following 
his mother as she dodged parked cars to run toward the sirens, where Raisa 
Gorbachev might be heading, or might not. 
</P>
<P>
"Raisa Gorbachev is NOT coming down here -- so sorry," droned a San Francisco 
cop over his loudspeaker, rolling through hundreds of tourists waiting with 
open lenses near Fisherman's Wharf. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, moments later, she was there. "We saw her head -- she looked 
lovely," gushed New Jersey tourist Rosalie McKeon. "I got about eight pictures 
of her head," said her husband, Bob. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe she was going to the Oakland children's hospital, once on her itinerary. 
So some people headed there. Maybe she was going to the Safeway, where a carful 
of U.S. agents wheeled in, and where bakery worker Rick Wood was laying out 
cookies, just in case. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's on his own. Everyone's playing their own hunches," said a hapless 
public relations person. 
</P>
<P>
But Raisa Gorbachev drove right by. She had already gone to a mom-and-pop 
grocery store in the Twin Peaks area instead. 
</P>
<P>
For 10 minutes, she had prowled the shelves of the New Terrace market, asking 
about the prices -- more expensive than home, she noted -- and why there was 
more U.S.-made vodka than Russian-made Stolichnaya on the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her it was because Stolichnaya is the best-selling vodka we have," said 
the owner, Hea Kim, no slouch at diplomacy herself. "She smiled." 
</P>
<P>
Twin Peaks, where she also shook hands with construction workers and locals, 
was an apt choice, for her itinerary Monday was about as quirky as the TV show 
that goes by the same name. But there was method in all this. 
</P>
<P>
The first Russian to come to San Francisco showed up in 1806, and that visit 
too was seeking business. Count Nikolai Rezanov came looking for supplies for 
the starving Russian colony at Sitka. The answer was "no," but he scored points 
on romance, wooing the 15-year-old daughter of the Presidio commandant. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, all Monday's meetings and flesh-pressing with proletarians and power 
brokers may pay off for trade-hungry Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
At Stanford, Raisa Gorbachev, who has been a university lecturer, talked to art 
students. Richard Payne gave her his painting of a Christ figure that bears the 
phrase in Spanish, "Lord Have Mercy." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Gorbachev pointed to it and said, "That's a warning about the apocalypse." 
Payne replied, "No, that's a blessing. Then she told me 'it's a bit of both.' 
She was the only person who's been able to understand my artwork. It's the best 
critique I've ever had," Payne marveled. 
</P>
<P>
Raisa Gorbachev started the day with another kind of critic, Nancy Reagan. The 
fabled Nancy-Raisa hostilities, the "power glower" frost once pitched as the 
last and most trivial battle of the Cold War, was not in evidence as the two 
women talked while their husbands met separately. They even held hands briefly 
on the balcony of the consul general's red brick mansion. 
</P>
<P>
"We get along fine," said Nancy Reagan after the 45-minute visit. "I think 
there's been a great misunderstanding about our relationship." This breakfast, 
on the heels of Raisa Gorbachev's public lovefest with Barbara Bush, came on 
the day that astrology believer Nancy Reagan's horoscope said, "Be willing to 
make changes." Raisa Gorbachev's -- who has said 'Not me, sorry' when it comes 
to astrology -- advised, "Financial gain results from career, business 
activity," a hopeful omen for this investment-seeking trip. 
</P>
<P>
She had tea with a trio from Friends of Raisa Gorbachev, high-powered business 
and academic admirers who got autographed photos but not yet the promise they 
had wanted for a return trip. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of her thinking and philosophy have contributed to some of the changes 
in the Soviet Union," said Ingrid Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Raisa Gorbachev did tell them that "she really could relate" to the grocery she 
visited, "coming from a very poor family herself." 
</P>
<P>
As for the society, Raisa Gorbachev teased them, she "used to get a lot of 
letters requesting permission to name their kids with my first name" -- and 
"here I have a whole society named after me."

THE GORBACHEVS IN CALIFORNIA; 
</P>
<P>
GORBACHEV AT STANFORD: CALIFORNIA IS 'SPECIAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here is a partial text of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's address at 
Stanford University: 
</P>
<P>
Ladies and gentleman, I'm very pleased that within the framework of my state 
visit to the United States, I am here among you within the walls of (this) 
world-famous university. Thank you for your warm hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
I think that those who work or study in your university are doubly lucky it is 
in California. . . . California is a special place, even by international 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
And I'm saying this not just by way of a compliment and to say pleasant things 
to the governor of this state, who is here with his wife. I think I am just 
stating a fact. It is said that only five countries in the world produce a 
greater gross output than your state. The ideas and technologies of tomorrow 
are born here in California. California is closely linked economically with 
Europe, Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Role of the U.N. 
</P>
<P>
So, this is a good place to live and for me an appropriate place for discussing 
how the Soviet Union and the United States have positioned themselves on the 
dividing line between the centuries and the eras on the coasts of the Pacific . 
. . described as the Mediterranean of the future. It is appropriate now to 
ponder the destinies of the world, since it was here in San Francisco the 
United Nations was founded precisely 45 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
I think this is symbolic, that it is this sunny city that was selected as the 
place . . . to . . . proclaim the foundation, the establishment of this 
organization whose efficiency we all need very much. 
</P>
<P>
Let us look at the conclusions drawn that time, right after the horrible war. 
The United Nations was set up to . . . remove the political, economic and 
social causes of war . . . to promote relations among nations . . . on the 
equal rights and self-determination of peoples, with respect for human rights. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
It is only now that international politics is really starting to adjust itself 
to these ideologies and principles, and all of us felt how much we need the 
United Nations if we really are to move the world. . . . For a long time, the 
Pacific was a center of confrontations and the arms race. . . . Nations found 
themselves on the opposite sides of the barricades of ancient revolutions. But 
new winds are now blowing. . . . The Japanese and Koreans and Chinese and other 
Asian peoples have lessons for the entire world to learn. . . . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
After the Cold War 
</P>
<P>
Let us think about the future. . . . I am under no illusions regarding the 
possibility of faster convergence (of) societies . . . They probably will never 
be fully alike. There is no need for that. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Cold War is now behind us. Let us not wrangle over who won it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when military procurement orders were considered -- are still 
considered by some -- to be the best incentive for economic and technological 
progress. . . . (In the 1970s) Santa Clara County, which was first in 
per-capita military contracts, began to explore ways of demilitarizing the 
local economy. I hope that as Soviet-American relations improve . . . 
participation in the arms race will become a thing of the past . . . not only 
for your beautiful state but both our great powers. 
</P>
<P>
Science has played a major role in the arms race. Science was the first to seek 
out . . . and to look for a way out. . . . Here we have to give credit to the 
joint efforts of Soviet and American scientists, to which Stanford University 
scientists have made a very substantial contribution in their program for the 
development of the basic principles for such concepts as international security 
and strategic stability. 
</P>
<P>
Without a . . . similar and objective approach to defining strategic stability 
and national security, without a scientific analysis taking into account all 
factors -- economic, political, scientific, military, technical and 
political-military -- it is impossible to make the right decisions on . . . 
nuclear and conventional arms reductions. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists of our two countries worked together to make the necessary 
estimates and discussed them over and over again. They . . . put aside the 
political and military ambitions which had long stood in the way of a solution. 
Thus they have arrived at major political decisions, including those adopted 
over these days in Washington. . . .

Colombia's cocaine traffickers have threatened to kill Japanese Prime Minister 
Toshiki Kaifu and other top officials if Tokyo refuses to free three Colombians 
held here on drugs charges, Japanese police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A senior National Police Agency official said the Medellin drug cartel sent 
three letters to Japan's police demanding the release of three Colombians 
arrested in Japan in the past year. Japanese media quoted one of the letters as 
saying, "This is not a mere threat. The Japanese police are no match for us."

1 MILLION IN TEHRAN MOURN KHOMEINI ON FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH

More than 1 million mourners on Monday gathered around the gold-domed tomb of 
the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to mark the first anniversary of his death, 
some beating their chests in grief. 
</P>
<P>
"Death To America!" blared loudspeakers around the compound. 
</P>
<P>
"Death To Israel!" 
</P>
<P>
Inside the packed shrine, mourners listened as speakers recited verses from the 
Koran, the Islamic holy book. The gray-bearded Khomeini seemed to stare sternly 
at the crowd from pictures hung on the pillars. 
</P>
<P>
"While There Is Islam, We Will Not Forget The Imam" read one banner. Khomeini 
was considered to be Iran's supreme leader and the inspiration for the Islamic 
revolution that overtook his nation in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Some in the crowd, including a group of Pakistanis, beat their chests in a 
traditional sign of mourning as others sat under makeshift tents. 
</P>
<P>
The event, which climaxed a four-day mourning period, brought a gathering of up 
to 3 million people around the shrine at Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery on the 
outskirts of Tehran, according to foreign reporters who flew over the scene in 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news media, however, said the occasion drew 8 million to 9 
million people. 
</P>
<P>
When Khomeini's death at age 86 was announced June 4, 1989, the day after he 
died, millions poured into the streets, pounding themselves, scratching their 
faces and beating their chests in grief. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's events were a replay of those scenes. Hundreds of people, many of them 
conscripts or civil servants who had been ordered to attend, walked for days to 
arrive at the tomb.

<P>
No solution to Canada's growing constitutional and linguistic problems emerged 
Monday as Prime Minister Brian Mulroney completed a second day of make-or-break 
talks with this country's 10 provincial premiers. 
</P>
<P>
Months of debate over a package of constitutional amendments has awakened such 
sharp bitterness over language issues in Canada that some analysts fear the 
country could finally split into French and English-speaking sub-states, as it 
last threatened to do 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Mulroney called all the provincial premiers to Ottawa this week to cool off the 
crisis -- an unusual move here that would be equivalent to President Bush 
summoning all 50 U.S. governors to Washington for high-powered negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough sledding in there," Mulroney said as he walked out of the final, 
closed-door session of the day. "We have a long way to go." He declined to 
answer a reporter's question about whether he thought the conference, which 
will continue today, would succeed. 
</P>
<P>
By late afternoon Monday, the only good news coming out of the meeting was that 
no one had yet walked out in a huff. 
</P>
<P>
Canadians perceive the talks as a crucial event for their country. Wags called 
Sunday's working dinner, which opened the negotiations, "The Last Supper." 
</P>
<P>
And when the premiers began arriving at Ottawa's futuristic Museum of 
Civilization for the first round of talks, a crowd of demonstrators greeted 
them with placards showing the Canadian maple leaf being torn in two and 
bearing slogans pleading with them not to let the country break apart. 
</P>
<P>
Some sang "O Canada," the national anthem, while Mulroney made brief remarks to 
the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"One Canada, indivisible, renouncing all kinds of separations," called 
protester Deepak Massand, an India-born Montrealer who sported images of the 
Quebec and Canadian flags on his T-shirt. Massand, whose family sought safety 
in Canada during the bloody partition of British India into modern-day Pakistan 
and India, was horrified to think that his adopted country might now split 
apart, too. 
</P>
<P>
The premiers went into the first day in fairly good spirits, but as the talks 
moved into their second day and it became clear that no easy compromise would 
be forthcoming, the mood soured. The main sticking point is the formula by 
which Canada amends its constitution. Quebec wants to have a veto over 
constitutional amendments; some other premiers want to deny Quebec this power. 
</P>
<P>
Canada has arrived at this impasse through Mulroney's attempts to get Quebec to 
sign the national constitution. Quebec has resisted signing the document for 
years, citing as many as 22 objections. Mulroney decided to win Quebec over, 
and in 1987, he brought the country's 10 premiers together at a resort called 
Meech Lake, to amend the constitution in ways palatable to Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec's premier, Robert Bourassa, narrowed Quebec's list of objections to just 
five items, and presented them to the Meech Lake gathering as his province's 
"minimal demands" for signing the constitution. The other nine premiers 
accepted the demands, and most Canadians assumed that the so-called Meech Lake 
Accord would be ratified without a hitch by the legal deadline of this June 23. 
</P>
<P>
But before ratification could be completed, various provinces held elections 
and elected new premiers. Three of the newcomers -- those from Manitoba, 
Newfoundland and New Brunswick -- have repudiated their predecessors' support 
for the Meech Lake Accord, saying it gives too much power to Quebec and could 
cause a variety of problems for the country. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the country's political leaders have been engaged in an 
increasingly high-stakes game of chicken to see who will break first: Whether 
the three holdout premiers will break down and ratify the accord, or whether 
Bourassa will back down on one of his five demands. 
</P>
<P>
Bourassa is under intense pressure in his home province not to give an inch. 
Anything resembling a concession will be used against him by his main 
opposition, the Parti Quebecois, which advocates secession for the province.

<P>
Communist officials of Beijing University and at least one other Beijing-area 
campus held emergency meetings Monday seeking to avert further student unrest, 
Chinese sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The meetings came as word spread among students in Beijing of a raucous 
anti-government protest Sunday night at Beijing University, in which hundreds 
of students threw bottles from windows, marched around campus and listened to 
speakers. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of paramilitary police were stationed in Beijing's main suburban 
campus district Monday, seeking to head off any more demonstrations marking the 
anniversary of the violent suppression of last year's massive pro-democracy 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
Just before midnight, Western reporters outside the Beijing University campus 
heard bottles breaking and students clapping. But as of 1 a.m. this morning, 
there had been no major incidents, and the campus seemed quiet. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 2 a.m., a convoy including 17 open-backed trucks, each carrying 
about 40 paramilitary police, plus six military jeeps, three vans and a bus, 
was seen leaving the campus district. But several small groups of riot police 
equipped with shields and face masks, some on foot and others on three-wheeled, 
side-car motorcycles, remained in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Late-night checkpoints operated by plainclothes and armed security officers 
were set up at many intersections. Journalists who tried to drive to the 
Beijing University area Monday evening were stopped at checkpoints and turned 
back, the Associated Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said soldiers beat two African students from Burundi with truncheons 
near a gate of the walled campus and threatened other onlookers and reporters 
with their AK-47 assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
Tian An Men Square, the focus of last spring's demonstrations for greater 
freedom, was closed for the fourth day and police on guard there kept 
pedestrians out of its north plaza and away from the Monument to the People's 
Heroes, the obelisk that became the headquarters of the student demonstrators 
last June. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses at the square said police quickly pounced on four young women who lit 
candles beneath the huge portrait of Mao Tse-tung, Communist China's founder, 
that overlooks the north end of the square. They put out one of the candles 
with a kick and blew out another, dispersing a gathering crowd of onlookers and 
detaining several foreigners briefly. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign reporters also saw police arrest at least three Chinese there. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the heavy security measures, there was some feeling at Beijing 
University on Monday of having won at least a small triumph. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have really let down the ones who died last year if we hadn't done 
anything to commemorate June 4 and the demonstrations before it," a Beijing 
University student explained Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Beijing residents and students were killed last 
June when army troops shot their way into Beijing to end the protests. 
</P>
<P>
"All the way from the Qing Ming Festival" -- in early April, when Chinese 
traditionally mourn their dead -- "to now, we haven't done anything to 
commemorate last year," he said. "We just got together last night, and decided 
we had to do something to commemorate the students who died last year." 
</P>
<P>
This student said he believes that the Beijing University protest developed 
spontaneously, partly because many students had been drinking heavily. The 
alcohol, he said, let their feelings out. 
</P>
<P>
"We originally didn't think about planning any activity," he said. "But after 
getting together with close friends in our rooms, we didn't want to stay in our 
rooms any more, and we started talking with other groups of friends in other 
rooms. And that's how it came about . . . We were very satisfied with last 
night's activity." 
</P>
<P>
The main speaker at Sunday night's protest, identified by the Associated Press 
as 21-year-old economics major Li Minqi, disappeared Monday. Although initially 
word circulated on campus that he had been detained, many students believe that 
he slipped into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
A Beijing University student quoted by the British news agency Reuters on 
Monday declared that "this government has tried to make us afraid to say 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to make us so that we can no longer tell the difference between 
truth and lies," he said. "But last night showed that we still know the 
difference, and we are not afraid." 
</P>
<P>
Students at two other Beijing area campuses also staged bottle-throwing 
protests Sunday night, United Press International reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese phrase for "little bottle" -- xiaoping -- sounds very similar to 
senior leader Deng Xiaoping's given name. Breaking bottles has become a widely 
recognized form of political protest. 
</P>
<P>
Students at Qinghua University, one of China's most prestigious schools of 
science and technology, threw bottles at a procession of police on motorcycles, 
hitting one officer, according to witnesses quoted by UPI on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
At People's University, students tossed bottles from their dormitory windows 
along with pieces of white paper twisted to look like flowers. White flowers 
and white clothes are symbols of mourning in China. 
</P>
<P>
At the University of Science and Technology, which experienced no unrest 
Sunday, one student commented Monday, with some wonderment, that teachers had 
been required to make dormitory bed checks the previous night. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very silly," the student said. "What are they afraid of? 
Everything is so calm now." 
</P>
<P>
Along with the sense of triumph felt by many, however, also came some 
foreboding. 
</P>
<P>
A Beijing University student noted that the famous school, a traditional 
bastion of free thinking that is the most prestigious educational institution 
in all of China, now finds itself in a state of virtually perpetual 
confrontation with the government. 
</P>
<P>
"Our school is really going to have some bad times for the next few years," he 
said.

JUDGE DELAYS RESUMING TRIAL OF AILING MARCOS 
</P>

The federal fraud and racketeering trial of Imelda Marcos, who collapsed in 
court last week, will not resume until next week, but her attorney said Monday 
that she is feeling much better and is "determined to go on and defend her 
family's name." 
</P>
<P>
"That's what she's living for," said Wyoming attorney Gerry Spence. 
</P>
<P>
Spence, the flamboyant lead attorney who recently has been a target of 
criticism from other members of the Marcos family, also said he has given no 
thought to resigning. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't consider it. Mrs. Marcos wouldn't have it -- that would break her 
heart," Spence said. 
</P>
<P>
He would not discuss the family's criticism of his defense efforts, first 
reported last week. He would say only that "the family supports their mother . 
. . and she is my client. I'm going to defend her." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, U.S. Dist. Judge John F. Keenan said he will suspend the 
two-month-old trial for the week, resuming June 12, because "a little rest 
wouldn't hurt" Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
"A few days would do her good and there would be the likelihood of no more 
interruptions," Keenan told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos was rushed to New York Hospital-Cornell University Medical Center last 
Thursday after she coughed up blood and fainted at the defense table as jurors 
and the courtroom audience gasped. 
</P>
<P>
Medical tests showed that she was suffering from erosive gastritis, bleeding of 
the stomach lining, that doctors said could be related to stress. 
</P>
<P>
The night before, Marcos had spent a sleepless night after considering family 
recommendations to replace Spence as her lead counsel with longtime attorney 
John Bartko of San Francisco. A day before, Spence had been rebuked publicly by 
Judge Keenan for making potentially "misleading statements to the jury." The 
lawyer also had been criticized by others in the defense camp for being 
unprepared and disorganized in court. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, however, Spence said that his defense team "has never been closer." 
He called the controversy that has swirled around him in recent days a way to 
"take the heat off my client and put it on me -- and I'm sure willing to take 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Spence called Marcos "a remarkable woman" who has shown courage under great 
stress. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine if you had been going for four years, the way Mrs. Marcos has, being 
called a thief, being blamed for the poverty of her own beloved people, having 
to face people who are more interested in her shoes than the truth. . . . 
Wouldn't that cause you stress?" the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
The last round of prosecution witnesses is expected to be called when the trial 
resumes next week. 
</P>
<P>
Kristina M. Luz, a Philippine journalist, also contributed to this story.

POLL FINDS AMERICANS OPPOSING INCREASE IN LEGAL IMMIGRATION 
</P>

<P>
Nearly half of all Americans believe that the nation accepts too many 
immigrants and an overwhelming majority opposes bills that would allow even 
more to enter, according to a poll released Monday by a Washington lobby that 
advocates stricter immigration limits. 
</P>
<P>
The Roper Organization poll, which was commissioned by the Federation for 
American Immigration Reform, was immediately criticized by immigration 
advocates, who contend that it asked the wrong questions of a public that is 
misinformed on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether current laws "allow too many immigrants, too few immigrants 
or about the right number" into the country annually, 48% of the respondents 
said that too many are permitted to live here. Only 9% said too few, and 29% 
said about the right number are allowed to enter. Fourteen percent had no 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
More than seven in 10 expressed opposition to legislation that could double the 
estimated 600,000 immigrants allowed to enter the country legally each year, 
20% supported such a bill and 8% were undecided. Congress is considering 
legislation that would raise the limits on legal immigration in order to 
reunite American citizens with their families or attract foreign workers who 
have skills that are in demand here. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that Americans want less, not more, immigration," FAIR 
President Dan Stein said. "The poll shows that the age of large-scale 
immigration is coming to an end in America." 
</P>
<P>
Cecelia Munoz, a lobbyist with the National Council of La Raza, a 
Washington-based organization that supports increased immigration, said that 
the poll's findings were not surprising, given the way the questions were 
framed. 
</P>
<P>
"When you ask the general public should there be more immigration the answer is 
always no," Munoz said. "But when you talk about families -- reuniting a 
married couple or a mother with her children -- the American public is very 
generous. It's all a matter of the kind of question you ask." 
</P>
<P>
The Roper Organization polled 1,000 adults, 18 years or older, by telephone 
between April 20 and May 2. In a supplemental survey, 144 Latino adults were 
questioned, bringing the total number of Latino respondents to 201. The poll 
has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
Additional findings: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nearly four of five respondents (79%) believe that the federal government 
is doing no better than a fair job in controlling illegal immigration, but 14% 
believe that the government is doing an excellent or good job. The remainder 
were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Almost two in three (62%) believe that the country has a "serious problem" 
with illegal border crossings, 29% believe border security is "pretty good" and 
10% had no opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nearly half (48%) said that U.S. immigration policy needs revision, but 30% 
believe that current policy is sufficient, and 22% were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Stein acknowledged a "tiny" measure of racism or xenophobic concerns among the 
poll's results but downplayed that aspect.

POTENTIAL BARRY CASE JURORS FACE BATTERY OF QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Selection of a jury began Monday in the drug use and perjury trial of Mayor 
Marion Barry amid reports that plea bargaining talks have broken down. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson distributed written questionnaires 
to 250 prospective jurors who will be screened for what is expected to be a 
monthlong trial. Reflecting more in-depth probing because of the sensitivity of 
the case, the questionnaires asked potential jurors about their attitudes 
toward drug use and alcoholism, whether anyone close to them has been 
chemically addicted and what they think about someone lying after "having taken 
an oath to tell the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said that he and attorneys in the case would begin questioning members 
of the jury pool individually this morning in search of an "unbiased and 
unprejudiced" 12-member jury and six alternate jurors. The process will take 
several days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, avoiding reporters, entered the U.S. Courthouse through a side entrance 
accompanied by his wife, Effi. The mayor, who has been in office for 12 years, 
reportedly has been willing to plead guilty to several misdemeanors involving 
the use of cocaine, but U.S. Atty. Jay B. Stephens has said that any plea 
agreement must include at least one felony, which could involve a prison term. 
</P>
<P>
A plea bargain still could develop later this week, although sources said that 
the two sides presently are far apart. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 14 charges facing Barry, three are felonies charging that he lied by 
denying under oath to a federal grand jury that he ever had used cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The other counts are misdemeanors involving 10 charges of drug possession and 
one charge of conspiracy to use cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
While some of the mayor's past associates are expected to testify about his 
drug use dating back to 1984, the government has described as its most graphic 
evidence an hourlong FBI videotape, taken with a hidden camera. The videotape 
allegedly shows Barry smoking crack cocaine with a former girlfriend, model 
Rasheeda Moore, in a hotel room last January. 
</P>
<P>
Barry said in a local radio interview Monday that such invasions of his privacy 
are akin to "a totalitarian kind of society." He previously accused the FBI of 
endangering his life by providing Moore with powerful cocaine and cognac that 
was to be offered him. 
</P>
<P>
Government attorneys have responded in court that Barry voluntarily used the 
drug. 
</P>
<P>
One of the 69 questions being asked of prospective jurors seeks their opinion 
"about the fairness of law enforcement agencies using concealed video and audio 
recording devices during the course of an undercover investigation." 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on all counts, Barry could be sentenced to a maximum term of 26 
years in prison and subjected to fines of more than $1.8 million. Incarceration 
after conviction of any crime also would prevent him from seeking a fourth term 
in office this year.

Sixty-one percent of American adults are overweight, and only one in three gets 
regular strenuous exercise, a national survey released Monday said. 
</P>
<P>
The levels are about where they were in 1983, when Louis Harris and Associates 
began the annual survey for Prevention magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"As a nation, we do not seem to be hearing the message about the long-term 
risks of being overweight, or we do not care, or we are woefully unsuccessful 
in being able to control our weight," the magazine said in its latest report 
card on the nation's health. 
</P>
<P>
The random telephone survey, conducted Nov. 6 through Dec. 13, 1989, also found 
some bright spots, including a continued reduction in the number of people 
eating fatty and high-cholesterol foods. 
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that 50% of those polled said they "try a lot" to avoid 
eating high-cholesterol foods such as eggs, dairy products and fatty meats. 
That's up from 42% in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-eight percent said they avoid eating too much fat, up from 55% in 1983 
and 54% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who are overweight, more than half are at least 10% over the 
recommended weight range for their height and build. 
</P>
<P>
A quarter of the survey respondents were within their recommended range, and 
15% were underweight. 
</P>
<P>
About 35% said they exercise strenuously at least three times a week, including 
42% of the men and 29% of the women. 
</P>
<P>
Although men were more likely to exercise strenuously and frequently, women 
were found to be more nutrition-conscious.

Lithuania's president said Monday he hopes that Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev will reassess his stance toward the breakaway Baltic state after 
returning from the Washington summit. 
</P>
<P>
But President Vytautas Landsbergis added in an interview with the Voice of 
America radio that he did not hear any encouraging words from Gorbachev during 
his meetings with President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst would have been if Mikhail Gorbachev came out with the impression 
that everything he is doing vis-a-vis Lithuania is permitted," Landsbergis said 
in the interview. 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis said he hopes that the Soviet leader will "thoroughly review" the 
matter when he returns home. 
</P>
<P>
He accused Gorbachev of using "propaganda methods" in dealing with the 
republic, which declared independence from Moscow on March 11 and triggered a 
Kremlin economic embargo of all fuel and most food supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has demanded that the republic revoke the declaration before starting 
negotiations on Lithuanian secession on the basis of the Soviet constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis on Monday reiterated Lithuania's refusal to reverse its 
declaration, saying, "I don't think we'll ever be able to take this step." 
</P>
<P>
At the summit, Bush and Gorbachev agreed to a trade pact that Bush said is 
conditioned only on the Soviet government's approval of liberalized emigration 
laws. Bush previously had said Moscow also must end its blockade against 
Lithuania, but he changed that position on Sunday.

U.S. ASKS JAPAN TO PARTICIPATE IN $8-BILLION SUPERCOLLIDER PROJECT 
</P>

<P>
Japan has been asked to make participation in an $8-billion superconducting 
supercollider "a symbol of the global partnership" that President Bush has 
offered Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, W. Henson Moore, deputy energy secretary, 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
After holding formal talks with Japanese officials Monday, Moore added that the 
Bush Administration would be willing to raise the ceiling on foreign 
participation of one-third, or $2.6 billion, of the projected cost of the 
massive project if Japan and other countries wanted to make a larger 
investment. The House has authorized the $2.6-billion level of investment but 
the Senate has not yet acted. 
</P>
<P>
"We in the U.S. government would prefer to receive that amount and are even 
willing to discuss a greater amount," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Due to the size of this project, it will not be possible to build it with U.S. 
funding only. It's too big for any one country. It needs to be an international 
project. . . ," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government is planning to finance up to $5 billion of the cost and the 
state of Texas has shouldered a $1-billion burden. A 54-mile underground tunnel 
is to be built around the small town of Waxahachie, Tex., near Dallas, in which 
streams of protons, guided by powerful superconducting magnets, will be shot at 
nearly the speed of light to collide against each other. This will enable 
physicists to learn more about the nature of matter and energy. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said he has high hopes that Japan will join the project "because it wants 
to give meaning to the agreement between President Bush and Prime Minister 
Kaifu to make the U.S.-Japan relationship a global partnership." He added that 
the U.S. government also believes that Japanese participation would "give 
meaning and life to a global partnership." 
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department official refused to disclose how much money he asked 
Japan to contribute but emphasized that the United States wants Japan to be a 
full partner in the project. Nor did he reveal how Japanese officials responded 
to his invitation. 
</P>
<P>
The next step, if Japan decides to take it, "would be for the Japanese 
government to send a team of officials and scientists to the United States to 
go into more detail on how the project will look," he told a new conference 
shortly before leaving for Seoul. There, his team will invite the South Korean 
government to join the project. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no limitations . . . at present" concerning what companies might 
build 8,150 of the 12,000 magnets that will go into the supercollider, he said. 
Japanese firms are reported to be interested in bidding to build the magnets, 
which will cost about $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from considerations of cost, some Japanese political leaders are 
reportedly worried that if they decide to take part, American critics might 
complain about a giveaway of American technology. Others fear that a decision 
not to join will be attacked as a sign of a Japanese desire to benefit 
scientifically, once the projects' results are released, without bearing a 
monetary burden.

BAD NEIGHBORS MAKE GOOD COURT FOES; 
</P>
<P>
LAWSUIT: AN ENCINITAS ATTORNEY WHO OBJECTED TO A NEXT-DOOR FENCE MAY HAVE LOST 
THE BATTLE, BUT HE WON THE WAR, TO THE TUNE OF $10,000. THE TARGET OF HIS WRATH 
IS FURIOUS.

The court case goes like this: 
</P>
<P>
Guy builds fence. Angry neighbor -- who is an attorney -- doesn't like it and 
sues. Judge rules the fence is legal, but agrees with the angry neighbor that 
the fence owner's property wasn't very well maintained. The judge awards the 
upset neighbor a $1,000 judgment -- then orders the fence builder to pay his 
angry neighbor about $10,000 in legal and court costs. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Federmack says it's the most expensive $400 fence he ever built. 
</P>
<P>
"The lesson is, don't live next door to a lawyer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge shakes her head. "This case should have been handled on 'The People's 
Court.' This is like the Hatfields and the McCoys." 
</P>
<P>
The feuding began on Silver Peak Place, a neighborhood street in Ranch View 
Estates, an attractive, 32-home Encinitas subdivision complete with views of 
Olivenhain, on Encinitas' back side, and CC&amp;Rs -- those covenants, 
conditions and restrictions that homeowners place on themselves to make sure 
the neighborhood doesn't go to pot. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Charles Federmack, who bought his home on a third-acre lot and, over the 
years, slowly and surely erected a 5-foot-high, redwood-post fence with wide, 
plastic-coated wire meshing. Not chicken wire, but the nice stuff. 
</P>
<P>
The fence ran up his back yard, toward a higher terrace that happened to be on 
the same level as Lawrence Eden's back yard. In fact, Federmack's property line 
comes to within 15 feet or so of Eden's back patio. 
</P>
<P>
Not wanting to peer through his neighbor's fence, Eden had offered to landscape 
and tend to that upper terrace of Federmack's back yard, without even 
pretending to take ownership of the land, court records show. Federmack 
effectively said no, don't touch my property. 
</P>
<P>
Eden, who didn't want to look at the fence, threatened to sue. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody told me that there's no way he'd sue, that he's just bluffing," says 
Federmack, a retired movie industry sound expert. "We all thought he was just 
blowing hot air." 
</P>
<P>
With the blessing of the homeowners association and the county, Federmack put 
up the fence. 
</P>
<P>
A double dog dare by any other name. 
</P>
<P>
Eden, an attorney, hired another attorney to represent him, and sued Federmack 
in Vista Municipal Court. That was two years ago; civil lawsuits don't move too 
quickly in busy courtrooms. Eden even filed requests for two temporary 
restraining orders, to stop Federmack from working on that part of the yard 
where the fence would go, just outside Eden's back patio. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge S. Patricia Rosenbaum ruled against Eden's requests for 
restraining orders, and even ordered Eden to pay Federmack $1,200 in legal 
costs he had to pay to fight the requests. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbaum also agreed that the fence is legal. But the judge said she would 
entertain an amendment to Eden's lawsuit, allowing him to contend that 
Federmack, who has since sold the property, had not maintained his back yard up 
to CC&amp;R standards. Eden did just that. 
</P>
<P>
"Homeowners are legally entitled to enforce the CC&amp;Rs of their homeowners 
association," Rosenbaum says, and, looking at pictures, she agreed with Eden 
that Federmack's property wasn't properly maintained. 
</P>
<P>
The judge ruled that Federmack should pay $1,000 to Eden as punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Great, said Eden. His attorney wrote up the technical paper work, and offered 
that each side should absorb his own legal costs. Call it a wash, Eden said. 
</P>
<P>
Federmack disagreed, and argued through his attorney that Eden should pay the 
entire court costs for the litigation because, after all, the fence was legal. 
The judge ruled that, in the end, Eden won the case because of the CC&amp;R 
violation on yard maintenance, and said that, if anybody should pay anything, 
it should be Federmack. 
</P>
<P>
Eden submitted a bill to Federmack for $38,265. Federmack flinched. On Monday, 
Federmack was in court, and Eden and his attorney were on the phone. They 
huddled in Rosenbaum's chambers, and talked on the telephone squawk box. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbaum pared down Eden's request, and ordered Federmack to pay about $10,000 
in court costs. 
</P>
<P>
Federmack, who is looking at about $25,000 in his own court and legal costs, 
was furious. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an outrage," he said. "This is why attorneys drive BMWs and Mercedeses 
with car phones." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Eden nor his attorney could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Federmack says he can't afford to appeal. "I'm financially destitute now," he 
says. "There's nothing more he can milk out of me." 
</P>
<P>
End of story? Not quite. 
</P>
<P>
Federmack says Eden illegally trespassed on his property to install a gas line 
to Eden's back-yard spa. 
</P>
<P>
"I've already sued him for trespassing," Federmack said. 
</P>
<P>
He says he'd be willing to settle that case for the amount of Monday's 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Says Rosenbaum: "The two of them have spent an enormous amount of money -- both 
their own and the public's -- to resolve what is a relatively minor dispute 
over landscaping." She sighed. "But there are legal principles at stake."

WOMAN SAYS RAPE STORY WAS A HOAX; 
</P>
<P>
CRIMES: POLICE SPENT 100 HOURS INVESTIGATING THE SUPPOSED KIDNAPING AND RAPE OF 
A FORMER OXNARD RESIDENT. SHE NOW SAYS THE TALE WAS CONCOCTED AS A WORK ALIBI.

<P>
A woman who claimed in April that she was abducted from a Port Hueneme shopping 
complex and repeatedly raped over the next 27 hours made up the story as an 
excuse for missing work, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The lurid account of the alleged rape given by Jacqueline Morgan, 24, a former 
Oxnard resident who now lives in Oceanside, was a complete hoax, said Sgt. 
Dennis Fitzgerald of the Port Hueneme Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The phony story was uncovered only after weeks of police work that gradually 
convinced detectives that the woman was lying and led to a showdown this 
weekend in which she confessed that she invented the story, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt fairly early on that there were problems with her story," he said. "We 
decided to give her the benefit of the doubt and make sure." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan told police that she had been raped six times and sodomized by a man who 
kidnaped her in broad daylight on April 3, from the alley behind the French 
Connection Haircutters salon at 475 W. Channel Islands Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
She said the man had forced her to remain blindfolded in the bedroom of a 
house, where she was not allowed to eat, drink or use the bathroom for 27 
hours, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
In describing the attack to police, Morgan said the man had driven her back to 
her car the next day and warned "I'll be watching you," before he left. 
</P>
<P>
Her story was full of details, and medical evidence revealed that she had had 
sexual intercourse, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
But Fitzgerald said that he and the two detectives assigned to the case quickly 
discovered holes in Morgan's story. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan said she was forced to park in the alley behind the salon's building 
because no spaces were available in front of the hair shop. When police 
questioned area merchants, they learned there had been plenty of parking spots 
in front of the salon that day. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan said that the attacker had bitten her on the back of the neck. But two 
doctors who examined her after the alleged rape did not believe the injury was 
recent or that it was a bite mark. 
</P>
<P>
A forensic dentist in San Diego County confirmed that the wound was not a bite 
mark after examining a photo that police sent him of it, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan later revealed it was a hickey her boyfriend had given her, Fitzgerald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police had a description of the white Ford Escort station wagon the rapist 
supposedly drove and a composite of the alleged attacker. They distributed it 
to local businesses in hopes of finding a suspect and 12 people called to tip 
police off to possible attackers. All were dead ends, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
After eight weeks of investigating the alleged attack, Fitzgerald confronted 
Morgan on Friday with his suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
She became upset, denying that she had lied, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
But when Fitzgerald questioned Morgan again on Saturday, she admitted that she 
had concocted the story of the rape to cover two missed evening shifts from 
work at Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of reporting to her job as a technician monitoring vital signs in the 
hospital's critical care unit, Fitzgerald said Morgan had spent the time with 
her boyfriend in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Morgan was on probation at the hospital, where she had worked 
since December, for too many absences, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
She resigned from the job on May 16, a hospital spokeswoman said. Morgan, a 
divorced mother of a 2-year-old girl, is now unemployed and living with her 
boyfriend in Oceanside, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
The Port Hueneme Police Department is considering referring the case to the 
Ventura County district attorney's office, which would decide whether to file 
charges against Morgan for filing a false police report. The maximum penalty 
for the misdemeanor is six months, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory D. Totten. 
</P>
<P>
Totten said false reports of crimes are relatively rare in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
People sometimes report false burglaries in order to collect insurance money or 
get someone in trouble. Falsely reporting a rape is extremely unusual, Totten 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The department may also seek restitution from Morgan for the 100 hours 
detectives spent investigating the case, Fitzgerald said. But Fitzgerald said 
the department is leaning away from seeking restitution or criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that upsets us more than anything is that it takes away from the 
legitimate complaints when we have to spend time following up false ones," 
Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, publicity about the rape story generated fear among women in Port 
Hueneme, who called the department concerned about safety in the area, 
Fitzgerald said . 
</P>
<P>
For the last two months, women have been afraid to park behind the stores in 
the 400 block of West Channel Islands Boulevard. Many of them have mentioned 
the rape, shop employees said. 
</P>
<P>
And almost no one will come to the French Connection Haircutters salon in the 
morning -- when Morgan said the rape occurred -- or after 6 p.m., when fewer 
people are around, owner Sylvia Martinez said.

OXNARD MAN ACCIDENTALLY RUNS OVER, KILLS BABY DAUGHTER

An Oxnard man accidentally ran over and killed his 18-month-old daughter Monday 
morning in the alley behind their home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Felipe Serrato, 22, had backed his 1976 Oldsmobile Cutlass into the alley 
behind the 1200 block of West Fir Avenue, police traffic investigator Jeff 
Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
As Serrato pulled forward, Adeline Serrato ran from the fenced yard and was 
struck by the car. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't see her," Shelton said. "It happened so fast." 
</P>
<P>
Adeline was pronounced dead at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard at 
11:35 a.m., about 45 minutes after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy was pending, but Deputy Coroner Dale Zentzis said the cause of death 
appeared to be head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
No charges were filed, Shelton said. "It wasn't his fault," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The baby's mother did not see the accident but was home when it occurred, 
Shelton said, adding that the mother is seven months pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole family has been destroyed," Serrato's brother, Melchor Serrato, said 
in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Spanish as the parents and other family members sobbed in the 
background, he said that Felipe Serrato is a farm worker and that the couple 
have no other children. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad one," Zentzis said. "The poor dad . . . that would be awful."

12-YEAR-OLD BOY WOWS EDUCATORS WITH TEST SCORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 12-year-old Camarillo boy was among three top scorers in California under age 
13 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test and has been honored by Johns Hopkins 
University in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey A. Smith was among 11 preteens nationally who were cited by the 
university for scoring at least 700 on the math portion and at least 630 on the 
verbal section of the test, said Angela James, talent search coordinator for 
the Johns Hopkins Center for the Advancement of Academically Talented Youth. 
</P>
<P>
Smith scored 1,360 of a possible 1,600 points on the exam, which measures a 
student's college preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty tricky," Smith said of the test, which has intimidated many high 
school juniors and seniors seeking high scores for college admission. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the most problems on reading comprehension but felt pretty comfortable 
on the science section," Smith said. He said his only preparation was taking 
the practice test in the SAT registration booklet. 
</P>
<P>
A seventh-grade student at Mesa Union School, Smith took the SAT in January 
with more than 46,000 other gifted students in 19 states and the District of 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Johns Hopkins asked schools to choose their best students from among those who 
scored in the top 3% of standardized achievement or aptitude tests to take the 
SAT along with high school students, James said. Other universities conducted 
similar programs in the other states. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who scored 630 on the verbal portion and 730 in math, won two $100 merit 
scholarships -- one each in math and English -- to be used toward accelerated 
summer programs that Johns Hopkins offers through several California colleges, 
including Redlands University in the Los Angeles area, James said. 
</P>
<P>
Clay Smith, Jeffrey's father, said he knew that Jeffrey is "pretty smart on the 
local level," but the family was pleasantly surprised that he had done so well 
nationally. Jeffrey has won his school's spelling bee for the past three years 
and also placed first in math and science earlier this year in the Camarillo 
Academic Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
He also participates in track and field and is an accomplished clarinetist who 
plays at local functions with a six-piece clarinet ensemble whose other members 
are high school students. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis J. Convery, superintendent of the one-school, 350-student Mesa Union 
Elementary School District, said Smith "excels in just about everything." 
</P>
<P>
Convery said the district is proud because Smith has been a student there since 
he was in kindergarten. "We feel that the learning that's taken place here, and 
being able to help him reach his potential and keep him challenged, is a 
reflection on the staff," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he has profited from the district's small size. "I like it," he 
said. "You get lots of personal involvement from the teachers, and you know 
everybody at the school." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he would probably wait until his junior year in high school before 
taking the test again, and would try to score even higher. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his high SAT scores, Smith said he would not try to skip a grade or two 
and graduate ahead of his classmates. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh no," he said. "I wouldn't want to do that."

BOARD TO STUDY SALE OF RECLAIMED WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THIA BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the objections of environmentalists, the Ojai Valley Sanitary District 
decided Monday to consider selling treated waste water being dumped from its 
sewage plant into the Ventura River. 
</P>
<P>
The district's board of directors voted 5 to 2 to set aside $50,000 to study 
the market potential, legal issues and environmental impacts of selling 
reclaimed water from the sewage plant south of Foster Park. 
</P>
<P>
The sewer district board, serving 11,000 customers in Ojai Valley and in the 
city of Ventura north of Shell Road, also was expected to vote late Monday to 
raise rates by 55%, which will cost the average homeowner an extra $5.58 per 
month beginning in August. 
</P>
<P>
The money is needed to raise $725,000 to install new filters in the sewage 
treatment plant, which will make the 2.1-million gallons of waste water 
released from the plant every day nearly drinkable. The project is scheduled 
for completion in three years. 
</P>
<P>
Ojai Mayor Nina Shelley and James Brady, district board members, objected to 
moving ahead with a plan to resell the water, which they said might jeopardize 
river habitats during a drought. 
</P>
<P>
But more than half of the discharged amount could be sold, because the 
Environmental Protection Agency has required that only 840,000 gallons per day 
be released from the plant to replenish the river and protect spawning areas 
for fish and other wildlife, said Eric Oltmann, district general manager. 
</P>
<P>
So far, none of the water from the treatment plant has been sold, but customers 
have been lining up for months to buy the higher quality water, Oltmann said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be a question of whether that water is reclaimed," Oltmann 
said. "It will be a question of who is going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Oltmann said that if the sewer district doesn't sell its treated water, the 
city of Ventura could lay claim to it under a 1963 agreement that allows the 
district to lease the land for the treatment plant for $1 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Water resale offers the district "a glimmer of hope," Oltmann said, as a means 
of offsetting sewer-rate increases that could jump by $32 a month in the next 
few years for the average residential customer. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural use would be given priority for the reclaimed water. Among those 
who have expressed interest in using reclaimed waste water are representatives 
for the Farmont Golf Club, a proposed 18-hole golf course near Lake Casitas, 
and California State University for its proposed four-year college on the 
Taylor Ranch northwest of Ventura. THIA BELL

SCHOOL PANEL STUDIES $626,500 IN GRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Simi Valley school officials will be asked tonight to restore $626,500 of the 
$8 million they planned to cut from the district's budget to fund two assistant 
principal positions, supplies and noontime supervisors, but no additional 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
However, Supt. John W. Duncan said Monday that about $300,000 in overpaid 
teachers' salaries could be used to hire up to 10 of the 32 temporary teachers 
the board voted last month to lay off on July 1. A recent in-house audit showed 
the districts' 750 teachers were overpaid $200 to $400 during the 1989-1990 
school year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a windfall to the general fund that could be used to restore more 
teachers," Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
But teachers' union officials were not pleased, even though they admitted more 
teachers could keep their jobs as a result of the error. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm extremely upset by the error. It's bad that it happened, and we need to 
see why we didn't catch it," said Ronald Myren, representative of the Simi 
Valley Educators Assn. "We have no agreement with the district on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
The district will consider various methods of repayment, including payroll 
deductions over a five-month period, Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to get it back, because if we don't, it would be a gift of public 
funds," said board member Helen Beebe. "The teachers are already upset at so 
many things, there's going to be no great delight in paying back money." 
</P>
<P>
Myren said Duncan informed him of the error during a meeting late Friday 
afternoon. According to a preliminary legal opinion obtained by the union, the 
school district must allow teachers to repay the money over a 36-month period 
and cannot deduct it from their paychecks. He said he will be talking to 
another attorney before tonight's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mistake that was made a year ago, and now the district is giving us 
three days to come up with an answer. The teachers know nothing of this. It 
puts us in a tight spot," Myren said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have been grappling with an $8-million shortfall in the $69.9-million 
budget for 1990-91 that prompted them to lay off 32 temporary and 28 clerical 
and service employees, including five nurses. They also reassigned dozens of 
administrators to lower-level positions with reduced salaries, cut back 
purchases of instructional materials and froze hiring and travel expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, school officials will consider relieving some of the financial 
pressure with $626,500 in grant funds. However, money is intended for specific 
purposes and cannot be used for teachers' or nurses' salaries, Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
It is proposed that an assistant principal position at both Garden Grove and 
Berylwood Elementary schools be financed with $115,000 in grant money; a total 
of $366,000 be spent for two educational consultants, a special projects 
coordinator, a vocational technician and a student welfare-attendance 
assistant; $45,000 for district supplies; $40,000 for districtwide maintenance 
supplies; $30,000 for school supplies; $20,500 for noon duty supervisors at 
elementary schools; $5,000 for a classified in-service day, and $5,000 for 
transportation of Career Academy students, according to a report by Duncan.

WATER-SAVING LAW TARGETS NEW PROJECTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Simi Valley City Council voted Monday to require all new construction 
projects to use ultra-low flush toilets and urinals. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-0 vote makes the ordinance effective July 5. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Coons, director of Simi Valley's Department of Public Works, said the 
new ordinance will save 14,000 gallons of water from the amount that would be 
used by conventional toilets in each new building. 
</P>
<P>
Coons said the ultra-low flush toilets use about 1.6 gallons per flush, 
compared with about 3.5 gallons in a standard toilet. The new urinals use one 
gallon of water per flush, about a gallon less than the amount used by a 
standard urinal. 
</P>
<P>
State law mandates that water conservation fixtures be installed in all 
construction projects beginning in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Coons said that adopting such an ordinance now will help the city and the 
county avoid passing more drastic water-rationing measures later. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County and the cities of Ventura, Ojai, Oxnard, Fillmore and Thousand 
Oaks have already adopted similar ordinances. The cities of Port Hueneme and 
Moorpark also are considering such measures. CARLOS V. LOZANO

PROBATION OFFICERS ASSN. MERGES WITH LARGER LOCAL; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: THE VOTE MAKES SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION, LOCAL 102 THE 
SECOND LARGEST UNION FOR COUNTY WORKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Service Employees International Union, Local 102 became the second-largest 
county workers' union Monday when it merged with the 748-member San Diego 
County Probation Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the merger, Local 102 represents more than 2,000 county 
employees, second only to the troubled County Employees Assn., which has about 
6,500 members. 
</P>
<P>
The merger is significant because it represents the second major county unit to 
merge with a bigger union in recent months, as county officials discuss 
proposed cutbacks for 1991 because of a budget crunch. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, about 400 Superior Court employees merged with the American 
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Local 127. 
</P>
<P>
"We're tired of year after year going to the bargaining table, presenting 
reasonable arguments and winning nothing," said Don Reeves, executive director 
of the Probation Officers Assn. "It's been clear to us for some time that it's 
been a futile endeavor. We voted overwhelmingly to go with Local 102 because 
it's an aggressive and very professional union." 
</P>
<P>
The probation officers' contract with the county expired in December, and both 
sides have been negotiating a contract since October. Salaries for probation 
officers range from $17,000 to $35,000 annually, Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Reeves, wages and the length of a contract are the main stumbling 
blocks in the negotiations. The county has offered the group a 30-month 
contract, while the association seeks an 18-month pact. 
</P>
<P>
Most county workers are represented by the County Employees Assn., which at one 
time was the largest independent union in the state. However, in the past three 
years, the association has been torn apart by dissension. Former General 
Manager Wyleen Luoma and her top aide were fired last year when allegations of 
misconduct and abuse of authority were leveled at Luoma. 
</P>
<P>
A new CEA executive board has failed to heal the differences among the various 
units, which range from office workers and professionals to blue-collar 
employees. Leaders of some units represented by the CEA have said they are 
afraid the group is too weak and in too much turmoil to represent workers who 
may be threatened by the proposed cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, nervous workers from some units are hoping to merge with an 
outside union.

METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL BOARD CONSIDERS ELIMINATING 1,300 
JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Facing its biggest financial crisis in a decade, the Los Angeles school board 
is considering eliminating 1,300 positions -- including more than 600 teaching 
jobs -- as it tries to trim $220 million from next year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
The board already has approved $119 million in cuts, including eliminating 635 
clerical and administrative jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But the district's chief financial officer, Robert Booker, said another $101 
million in cuts are needed to meet state requirements. Booker blamed the 
shortfall on lower-than-expected revenue from the state, sharply rising program 
costs and the 8% salary increase the board gave to nearly every employee. 
</P>
<P>
The board will hold public hearings on the proposed cuts next week and vote on 
the cuts in two weeks.

EX-ASSEMBLYMAN TO HEAD U.S. FUEL PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Assemblyman Charles R. Imbrecht of Ventura has been appointed 
co-chairman of the U.S. Alternative Fuels Council, a federal panel charged with 
devising a national policy on alternative automobile fuels that can reduce 
pollution and American dependence on foreign oil. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are going to clean up the air, it is essential for us to explore 
alternative fuels at the national level," Imbrecht said. For the past decade, 
the California Energy Commission has had the most ambitious alternative fuels 
program in the country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The federal council will study a number of alternative fuels, including 
methanol, ethanol, compressed natural gas and electricity. Some of those fuels 
already are in use in California, and the goal of the council will be to expand 
the use here and to cause other states to adopt similar programs. 
</P>
<P>
Imbrecht said it is important to develop new fuels for cars and trucks to 
reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil. Currently, he said, the nation 
imports 56% of its oil from abroad, 6% more than in 1973, when the country was 
hit by the OPEC oil embargo. 
</P>
<P>
The council was established by the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 to 
advise Congress and the President on long-term energy policy. It must make its 
policy suggestions to Congress and the U.S. Department of Energy by September, 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
Imbrecht, who represented Ventura County in the state Assembly from 1976 to 
1982, will share the chairmanship of the federal panel with Robert Hahn, an 
economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Other council members include Sens. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) and John D. (Jay) 
Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.), Reps. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) and Bill Alexander 
(D-Ark.) and a variety of energy experts. 
</P>
<P>
Imbrecht has been chairman of the state Energy Commission since 1982 when he 
lost a close race for the state Senate to Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara).

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS MEASURE PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Simi Valley City Council tentatively decided Monday to require businesses 
to prove that they are handling hazardous materials safely. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance is designed to help the city prevent accidents connected 
with the manufacture, storage and disposal of hazardous chemicals, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure everyone is operating safely," said Jocelyn Reed, deputy 
director of the city's Department of Environmental Services. "We're making sure 
nothing slips through the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, all businesses would be required to obtain "tenancy 
certificates" from the city, Reed said. To obtain a certificate, business 
operators would have to provide information about the types of materials 
manufactured and stored on their premises. 
</P>
<P>
If those materials are considered hazardous, operators would be required to 
prove they are in compliance with all local and state safety regulations, Reed 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Existing businesses that violate safety regulations or fail to provide the 
necessary information would be subject to fines and other penalties. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is expected to give final approval to the ordinance in the 
next few weeks. CARLOS V. LOZANO

TRIAL ORDERED IN KILLING OF 8-YEAR-OLD BOY; 
</P>
<P>
CRIMES: A FORMER DAY-CARE WORKER WAS ORDERED MONDAY TO STAND TRIAL FOR MURDER, 
KIDNAPING AND ARSON IN THE KILLING OF PAUL BAILLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Canoga Park man was ordered Monday to stand trial in the slaying of an 
8-year-old Northridge boy who was gagged and strangled, then set afire near 
Simi Valley on March 23. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Municipal Judge Lee E. Cooper Jr. ruled that there is enough 
evidence to prosecute Gregory Scott Smith, 21, on charges of murder, kidnaping 
and arson in the death of Paul Bailly. Following a five-hour preliminary 
hearing, sheriff's deputies returned Smith to jail without bond to await 
arraignment in county Superior Court on June 18. 
</P>
<P>
Paul was kidnaped after his mother dropped him off at the Darby Avenue 
Elementary School day-care center. His body was found on fire several hours 
later in a field. The next day, police arrested Smith, a fired day-care worker 
who witnesses said had threatened Paul Bailly. 
</P>
<P>
County Coroner Dr. F. Warren Lovell testified that Paul was "strangled with the 
thumb and forefingers of the hand" and then suffocated after vomiting while his 
mouth was taped shut. 
</P>
<P>
Lovell testified that a pair of handcuffs found near Paul's body could have 
slipped off his wrists during the fire, which was set after the boy died. 
</P>
<P>
Paul's mother, Mary Bailly, sat stiffly in the courtroom during Lovell's 
testimony, showing little emotion. She did not look at Smith, who rested his 
chin on his hands and clicked his leg irons together beneath the defense table. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses testified that Smith was an immature, vengeful day-care worker who 
singled Paul out for punishment at the Darby Avenue Elementary School latchkey 
program and once threatened him. 
</P>
<P>
Smith often threw balls at Paul and frequently "benched" the boy, forbidding 
him to play with other children, testified Nichole Garrett, 11. 
</P>
<P>
"There was really no reason for him to be benched," she testified. 
</P>
<P>
Paul complained about the frequent benchings to the program supervisor one day, 
the girl said. "I heard him say that he didn't want Greg to work there any 
more, that he wanted him fired." 
</P>
<P>
Smith walked into the office and overheard Paul's comments, then muttered to 
him in the hallway afterward "that he was gonna get him back for it," the girl 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
Smith had worked part time, beginning in September, 1988, in latchkey programs 
at Darby, Andasol and Chatsworth Park elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
He was fired from Andasol and Chatsworth Park on Dec. 13 for benching children 
without good cause, and for once forcing children to clean up another child's 
vomit, testified the latchkey program's regional executive director, Harold 
Kuhn. 
</P>
<P>
Smith promised that day to "try harder to do a better job," Kuhn testified. 
</P>
<P>
But Kuhn said he and fellow supervisor Ellen Pollack were forced to fire Smith 
from Darby on March 6 because "he was not supervising the youngsters the way we 
would expect." 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn said Smith often left children unsupervised on the playground and once 
abandoned them to help a woman fix her car alarm. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn also testified that Smith once asked Paul, "Where did you get those 
clothes from, Goodwill?" 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn said Smith threatened to "get me back" for being fired, and told him, "I'm 
not out to get the children, I'm out to get you." 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing he said to me was a comment that he would get me. He said he 
was going to report us to the Health Department" for letting children use the 
same bowl of dip at snack time, Kuhn testified. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses also testified that Smith had handcuffed children twice before he was 
fired, once to punish a child in a summer recreation program in 1988, and about 
a year ago during play with a kindergartner. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Bailly testified that she last saw her son alive at 7 a.m. on March 23 
when she dropped him off at Darby Avenue Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
Julio Gramajo, a Rocketdyne employee who was riding to work with a friend that 
morning, testified that he saw Smith driving Paul through Canoga Park along 
Saticoy Street just before 7 a.m. Gramajo said the pair looked like "a big 
brother taking a kid to school," but he also saw a pair of handcuffs hanging 
from the passenger door arm rest. 
</P>
<P>
At 11:50 a.m. that day, motorists found Paul's body in a burning field in the 
Santa Susana Knolls area. 
</P>
<P>
Before taking him into custody they allowed Smith to speak to his mother, 
Sharon Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Smith testified that her son whispered to her, without being asked, that 
he threw out a pair of handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
Smith also testified that she found a pair of blue shorts in the dryer, from 
which a piece of fabric was cut. 
</P>
<P>
The fabric matched the wad of blue cloth which investigators found in Paul's 
mouth under four layers of duct tape, testified sheriff's criminologist Edwin 
Jones Jr.

TRAILER PARK, CITY REACH RENT ACCORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city has reached an agreement with the owners of the Ventura Marina Mobile 
Home Park, ending a lengthy court battle over the park's right to raise rents 
above the limits imposed by the city's mobile home rent control ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura City Council voted 5 to 2 on Monday to uphold an agreement reached 
last week between the city and the Peterson Family Trust, which operates the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
"We have preserved the ordinance, and that was the ultimate goal," said Mayor 
Richard Francis, who voted with the majority. "Had we pursued the issue in 
court I think it's very likely we would have lost." 
</P>
<P>
The 1981 ordinance had restricted rent increases to the rise in housing 
maintenance costs plus a portion of the annual increase in the consumer price 
index. But under the agreement, the city will allow the mobile home park's 
owners to raise rents by $36 over the next three years, starting in 1991, and 
to increase rents by up to $35 each time a new family moves in. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the Petersons have agreed to drop two lawsuits filed last year 
challenging the city's rent control ordinance. They also will waive damages for 
any injuries suffered as a result of the rent control ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Peter D. Bulens said the city decided to seek a negotiated 
settlement with Ventura Marina after a recent string of court decisions 
nullified mobile home rent control ordinances in California and elsewhere in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Council members John McWherter and Jim Monahan opposed the agreement. "We're 
caving into pressures from attorneys," Monahan said. "Let our ordinance have 
its day in court."

REVISIONS IN MASSAGE LAW TENTATIVELY OKD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Massage parlor employees operating in Ventura would no longer be tested for 
venereal diseases under an amendment to a city ordinance that received 
tentative approval Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council gave unanimous approval to a revised version of the massage 
ordinance that also requires all new massage technicians to be graduates of "a 
recognized school" of massage technique, said city Administrative Assistant 
Deborah Millais. 
</P>
<P>
Millais said the revisions were proposed in response to claims by massage 
parlors that the "tone" of the original massage ordinance, adopted in 1982, 
"suggested that massage was something less than a legitimate business." 
</P>
<P>
The revisions, which will be up for a final vote next Monday, "leave the 
ordinance strong enough to allow police to pursue enforcement should it become 
necessary, while amending those sections most disturbing to the massage 
business people," Millais said. 
</P>
<P>
She said that the ordinance was passed at a time when massage parlors were 
sometimes used as fronts for prostitution but that since then the business has 
gained respectability. 
</P>
<P>
One provision that didn't change, despite objections from the parlor operators, 
would disqualify anyone who had a "massage establishment, escort service, nude 
entertainment, wrap parlor, nude photo studio or similar permit suspended 
within a year." SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

SAN DIEGO TO BE HOME TO MAJOR MORMON TEMPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BONNA M. DE LA CRUZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is building in San Diego its 
first California temple in more than 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
The 75-room temple will be only the third of the church's large temples in the 
state; the others are in Oakland and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
For years, church members in the San Diego area trekked to the Los Angeles 
temple for marriage ceremonies and other rites. The new temple will serve not 
only them, but Imperial County and parts of southern Orange County and northern 
Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
"We build a temple in an area when membership warrants it -- that is, keeps it 
busy and operating," said Don LeFevre, a spokesman at church headquarters in 
Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Robert McGraw, a local church representative, placed the San-Diego area's 
Mormon population at more than 45,000, with about 100 congregations. 
</P>
<P>
The temple was planned six years ago and ground was broken on the 8-acre 
University City site in February, 1988. But design changes and other 
refinements held up construction until four months ago. Completion is expected 
by spring, 1992, although Dennis Agle, spokesman for Deems Lewis McKinley, the 
architectural firm that designed the temple, said that is flexible. "The 
project will be finished when it's finished." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Magnuson, project architect, said he considers the temple a 
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Magnuson said the Mormon church allowed the design team to redesign the 
original draft, which simply called for construction of a standard temple. "We 
then started from scratch," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The four-level Charmant Drive temple, with twin towers soaring up to 190 feet, 
will be visible from Interstate 5. White marble, light golden cherrywood and 
gold leafing are some of the materials being used in the design. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted the temple to stand out. We wanted it to stand out like the 
governmental buildings in Washington, the cathedrals in Europe. We wanted that 
kind of pride and power behind it," Magnuson said. 
</P>
<P>
The temple will not replace the 20 or so Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints' meeting houses in San Diego County. Sunday morning worship services, as 
well as other church activities, will continue at those buildings. In fact, the 
temple will be closed on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
Considered the sacred house of the Lord, the temple instead will serve the 
Mormon community as the place for marriage, baptism and other rituals. 
</P>
<P>
LeFevre said ceremonies such as those sealing the family together as a unit 
will be held in the new temple. 
</P>
<P>
Such special ceremonies for area Mormons are now held in the Los Angeles 
temple, 2 1/2 hours away. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to place temples so that there is reasonable access to all people," 
LeFevre said. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego temple is different in style and smaller than its counterparts in 
Los Angeles, but McGraw said it is comparable in size to other temples recently 
built. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles temple was built in 1956, and the Oakland temple was built in 
1964. 
</P>
<P>
When construction is completed, an open house will be held -- the only time the 
facility will be open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"After that, only those worthy can go through it," said Bill Lewis, an 
architect on the design team and a church member. "To go to the temple, you 
must be a member. The temple is not so much a secret, but sacred," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
The temple will house instructional areas, assembly rooms, offices and other 
areas. It will not feature one large room, as do many cathedrals. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego temple will be the 45th Mormon temple in the world. Worldwide, 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has 17,000 congregations. 
Temples in Portland, Ore., and Las Vegas, Nev., were completed last year. Plans 
are being made for two temples in South America -- one in Bogota, Colombia, and 
the other in Guayaquil, Ecuador -- and for temples in Orlando, Fla., and 
Bountiful, Utah.

Three men were arrested Monday on suspicion of false imprisonment after they 
allegedly held five Mexicans at knifepoint. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, the three men were smuggling the illegal immigrants to Los 
Angeles, but stopped at a load house in San Diego, where they demanded more 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Load houses are used by smugglers to hold undocumented immigrants and transfer 
them to vehicles used to transport them to their destination. 
</P>
<P>
The five men were held at the house for about five hours until one escaped 
through a second-story window and called San Diego police at 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Sergio Cruz Pena, 18; Jesus Lopez Rivera, 23, and Alberto Sanchez-Ortega are 
being held in County Jail. The three are also undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
The five immigrants were released to Border Patrol officers to be deported back 
to Mexico.

An Oxnard man was being held Monday on suspicion of assault with a deadly 
weapon after family members said he threatened them with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard police responded to a domestic disturbance in the 1400 block of West 
Juniper Street about 8 p.m. Sunday and heard someone screaming inside the 
house, Sgt. Fred Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers forced their way in, Berry said, and found Roger Urango, 35, waving a 
knife at his wife, Amelia, 30, father-in-law, Joe Hernandez, 53, and two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief standoff, the officers persuaded Urango to surrender. No one was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
Urango was being held at the Ventura County Jail on suspicion of assault with a 
deadly weapon and two misdemeanor drug offenses. Normal bail for the assault 
charge is $5,000, a jail official said, but because of the nature of the 
offense investigators persuaded a judge to increase Urango's bail to $250,000.

HONIG CHANGES MIND ON UCLA SCHOOL MOVE

<P>
A delegation of parents flew into Sacramento Monday and persuaded State Supt. 
of Public Instruction Bill Honig to support their campaign to keep the 
University Elementary School on the UCLA campus and not move it into the Santa 
Monica public school system. 
</P>
<P>
Until Monday, Honig favored the move because he likes the idea of 
university-run lab schools in public school settings. Honig's staff was working 
with UCLA administrators and officials of the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified 
School District to smooth the way for the move. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the lab school delegation and members of his staff for 45 
minutes Monday afternoon, Honig changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a good idea -- taking that school and making it not just a research 
institution but a place where we can take some of these curriculum framework 
ideas and figure out how this could happen in regular schools," Honig said. 
</P>
<P>
Honig was referring to new state curriculum requirements in math, science, 
history, English and language arts. "I hope UCLA will give this suggestion 
serious consideration," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the parents' plan endorsed by Honig also calls for the 450-pupil 
University Elementary School to remain on campus, working closely with a new 
Center for Human Development and Cultural Diversity. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Seal, a member of the delegation that met with Honig, said the parents 
"got what we came for." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA officials want to move the lab school, the last in the state, to Santa 
Monica to make way for a $76-million Graduate School of Management. 
</P>
<P>
They also have argued that the lab school could fulfill its research function 
better as part of an urban school environment. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Family School Alliance -- the lab school's main support group -- 
has pointed out that the Ocean Park neighborhood of Santa Monica, where the 
school would be relocated, is rapidly becoming gentrified and upper-income and 
no longer offers much of an urban mix. 
</P>
<P>
They also question the wisdom of building a $7-million to $10-million school in 
Santa Monica-Malibu, a district where enrollment is declining.

<P>
A man awaiting a murder trial and who already is serving a 9-year sentence for 
bilking women he met in bars pleaded guilty Monday to escaping the El Cajon 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Stone, 41, pleaded guilty on the day that his trial for the Feb. 27 
escape was to begin in San Diego County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
He could be sentenced to a maximum of five years, which could run either 
concurrently or consecutively with his nine-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Stone's escape rope, made of bedsheets, ripped while he was dangling outside 
the jail, and he suffered back injuries in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
He is charged with murdering and robbing Anita Dalfoss, 50, of El Cajon, who 
was last seen March 14, 1989. Her skeletal remains were found near Lake Henshaw 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Judge William Mudd set July 2 for sentencing Stone on the escape case. The 
murder trial is scheduled for July 16.

LIMITS PROPOSED ON COMPANIES CLOSING FACILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, TIMES LABOR WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pending closure of an Oscar Mayer plant in Vernon that will leave 537 
workers jobless sparked a call Monday for federal and state laws that would 
limit the freedom of healthy firms such as Oscar Mayer to shut facilities and 
move elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
At a congressional hearing in Vernon, Rep. Matthew Martinez (D-Montebello) 
suggested that Congress require corporations that wish to shut plants to file 
"economic impact statements" justifying their business decision and providing 
compensation for the financial and social problems caused by a closure. 
</P>
<P>
And state Sen. Bill Greene (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Senate Industrial 
Relations Committee, said he favored a state law conditioning tax breaks for 
business on a corporation's pledge to keep its business operating in a fixed 
location for a certain number of years. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin-based Oscar Mayer Foods Corp., which operates 21 manufacturing plants 
throughout the country and reported $2.3 billion in revenues last year, 
announced last March that it was closing the 39-year-old Vernon plant in 
September because it is too small and too old. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, whose district is home to a number of the plant's workers, called 
Monday's hearing as chairman of a House subcommittee on employment 
opportunities. He said he did so after failing to persuade Oscar Mayer's parent 
corporation, Philip Morris Companies, to reconsider the plant closing in 
exchange for possible government assistance in modernizing the plant. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that a corporation should have a responsibility to communities 
in which it operates . . . before turning out that final light on the plant. 
Forty years of devotion and productivity dedicated to the company should earn 
the community a similar measure of caring," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 770, which represents about 
three-quarters of the workers at the plant, have charged that Oscar Mayer's 
true reason for shutting the Vernon plant is not its physical condition but the 
cost of its employees. 
</P>
<P>
In shutting down the plant, Oscar Mayer is joining a national trend in which 
cost-conscious companies attempt to rid themselves of union shops and older 
workers. The Vernon plant meets both tests. Because it is unionized, workers 
make about $10 an hour. By contrast, non-union packing house workers often make 
only $6 an hour. And because 57% of the Vernon workers have 20 years or more 
seniority, their health, benefit and pension costs are relatively high. 
</P>
<P>
The age of the work force and the fact that 75% of the employees are Latino 
will mean painful social dislocation for many workers once Oscar Mayer closes, 
the union says. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's hearing, Ricardo Icaza, president of UFCW Local 770, vowed that his 
28,000-member local is prepared to launch a consumer boycott of products 
marketed by Philip Morris Companies and its Kraft General Foods and Miller 
Brewing subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Ironically, Philip Morris spends millions of dollars each year on advertising 
and philanthropic activities directed at (the Latino) community. . . . We 
believe an appeal from the Vernon workers to Hispanics across the nation, 
citing specially targeted Philip Morris products, would prove very effective," 
Icaza said.

QUESTIONS RAISED ON COURT-ORDERED COMMUNITY WORK; 
</P>
<P>
JUDICIAL SYSTEM: FORMER SUPERVISOR AT ANIMAL SHELTER PLEADS NO CONTEST TO 
HELPING CONCEAL THAT ASSIGNMENTS WERE NOT BEING PERFORMED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A former supervisor of a Los Angeles County animal shelter in Baldwin Park 
pleaded no contest Monday to a felony charge that he prepared false documents 
concealing the fact that court-ordered community service work assigned at the 
shelter was not being performed. 
</P>
<P>
Jaime Meraz, 44, a Chino resident who is a 20-year employee of the Los Angeles 
Department of Animal Care and Control, entered his plea before Municipal Court 
Judge Rand Schrader, who set sentencing for July 2 in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The case, like the controversy last month over actress Zsa Zsa Gabor's 
performance of community service work after slapping a Beverly Hills police 
officer, raised more questions about how well court-ordered community service 
work is monitored. 
</P>
<P>
An official with the Los Angeles County Probation Department said action will 
soon be taken to improve oversight of the referral system, which was 
responsible for an estimated 52,000 community service sentences last year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the issue in Gabor's case was whether her fund-raising activities for 
a Venice program for the elderly met the requirements of her sentence to 
perform community service, the issue in the Meraz case was whether a county 
employee wrongly certified that court-ordered service had been performed. 
</P>
<P>
Meraz's case is related to charges leveled a year ago against one of his 
Baldwin Park shelter employees, Jorge A. Gamont, who was accused in June, 1989, 
of accepting bribes from three people assigned to do community service work as 
an alternative to jail sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Gamont pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of falsifying evidence and was 
sentenced to three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Dist. Atty. Reid A. Rose of the special investigations 
division, which investigates cases of official misconduct, there was no 
evidence showing that Meraz knew of the bribes. 
</P>
<P>
But, Rose said, "As manager of the shelter, he was responsible for approving 
the referral forms verifying service had been performed. . . . He was aware the 
work was not being performed." 
</P>
<P>
Meraz on Monday had no comment. "Mr. Meraz never knowingly did anything wrong," 
said his attorney, William A. Hinz. "He never benefited one iota." Hinz 
declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in the district attorney's office and the county Probation Department 
said no officials there monitor community-service sentences, usually imposed 
for misdemeanor cases such as traffic violations, driving while intoxicated or 
petty theft. 
</P>
<P>
The monitoring falls to the seven community volunteer centers -- all members of 
the Volunteer Centers of Southern California -- which are under contract with 
the Probation Department, said Carol Koelle, a regional director of the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect them to do whatever monitoring is necessary to make sure that people 
do their time," Koelle said. 
</P>
<P>
But Lenore Jacoby, head of one of the seven centers -- the Volunteer Center of 
Greater Pomona Valley -- said that although the number of community service 
referrals climbs steadily, with an 8% increase projected for this year, the 
centers "are paid a very small amount . . . $7 or $8 a case. . . . That leaves 
little money to do follow-up monitoring." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Wada, a Hacienda-La Puente School District official who is familiar with 
the district's court-referral program, said: "There are people who take 
advantage of the system. You'd really need to monitor almost 24 hours a day to 
make sure there isn't hanky-panky going on." 
</P>
<P>
De-De Hicks, president of the Volunteer Centers of Southern California and head 
of another contracting center, said, however, that cases such as Baldwin Park 
were "an isolated incident," and that the community-service programs were "one 
of the most problem-free anyone could ask for." 
</P>
<P>
But, Koelle said, "We are concerned with instances of highly inappropriate or 
improper behavior." She said that she and other probation department officials 
hoped to have a plan for better oversight by mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
Wada said his program has been making community-service referrals to the 
Baldwin Park shelter, but added that its status as a referral agency would now 
be reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Meraz was transferred from Baldwin Park in 1989 after Gamont was charged with 
bribery, county animal control spokesman Bob Ballinger said. Despite his 
conviction, Gamont remains a department employee, Ballinger said. 
</P>
<P>
Meraz was also Baldwin Park supervisor during a period in 1988 when a monthlong 
county audit of the shelter found 145 animals, mostly cats and dogs, were 
apparently missing and could not be accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
Until mid-May, Meraz was assigned tasks such as overseeing department vehicles, 
Ballinger said, but then he was named deputy manager at the county's shelter in 
Downey. Ballinger called this "a lateral move, not a promotion," and said the 
department will not consider any change in Meraz's employment status until 
after the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Meraz faces up to three years in prison on the charge. But the district 
attorney has recommended that he be sentenced to three years' probation, a $500 
fine and, ironically, 100 hours of community service.

PAYMENT OF $850,000 URGED IN COMPLAINTS INVOLVING DEPUTIES; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: CLAIMS BOARD'S ACTION NOW GOES TO SUPERVISORS. ANOTHER 
$160,000 SETTLEMENT IS ENDORSED.

<P>
Los Angeles County moved Monday to pay $850,000 to settle a new series of 
brutality complaints lodged against sheriff's deputies -- including two cases 
that resulted in deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the county Claims Board approved the settlements to head off five 
lawsuits filed by alleged victims or their families, after being told the 
county could face greater liability by allowing the matters to go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
The board also endorsed a sixth settlement, for $160,000, to a 19-year-old man 
injured four years ago when his auto was struck by a sheriff's patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
The settlements were the result of negotiations between county lawyers and 
attorneys for plaintiffs who have sued the county in Superior Court. Board 
Chairwoman Nancy Singer said payments over $100,000 must be ratified by county 
supervisors, who are tentatively scheduled to review the cases June 19. 
</P>
<P>
Action by the three-member board followed disclosures by The Times last week 
that 151 excessive-force lawsuits were filed against the Sheriff's Department 
last year. Over a three-year period that ended last September, such cases cost 
the county $8.5 million in jury settlements and awards. 
</P>
<P>
The latest settlements included $520,000 in restitution for the fatal shooting 
of a Pico Rivera man by deputies during a 1987 family dispute, and a $100,000 
payment to the family of a Carson man who died in 1984 after struggling with 
deputies outside a rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
Pascual Solis, 28, a self-employed contractor, was shot to death after 
allegedly fighting with deputies called to break up a disturbance at the home 
of his girlfriend. The settlement will be divided among the woman, Sarah Lilian 
Chavez Donis of Los Angeles; Solis' estranged wife, Liduvina Reyes of 
Bakersfield; and his six children, county lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
Enrique Rodriguez, a 33-year-old food services worker, died of a heart attack 
after fighting with deputies. Five officers were called to restrain Rodriguez, 
who reportedly had a history of mental illness, after he allegedly caused a 
disturbance at a rodeo in the City of Industry. The settlement will be paid to 
his wife and four children, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Other settlements approved Monday included: 
</P>
<P>
* A $45,000 payment to brothers Jose and Edward Rodriguez for injuries they 
received while fighting with deputies two years ago. Authorities alleged that 
the Pomona residents, who were 14 and 12 at the time, attempted to run away 
after deputies stopped a stolen car driven by Jose Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
* An $80,000 award to Stephanie Edwards-Norfleet, 33, of Inglewood, whose arm 
was broken in 1985 by a deputy attempting to handcuff her. Officials said she 
was restrained when she argued with jailers after posting bail on traffic 
warrants. 
</P>
<P>
* A $105,000 settlement to three men allegedly beaten by deputies after being 
arrested in 1987 on suspicion of public drunkenness. Christopher Bonzoumet, 35, 
Michael Espinoza, 30, both of Long Beach, and Craig Steinmetz, 25, of Los 
Angeles, were released 10 hours later without being charged. 
</P>
<P>
* A $160,000 payment to Daniel Concepcion Jr., of Moreno Valley, who suffered 
serious injuries in 1986 when the auto in which he was riding was struck by a 
sheriff's patrol car in Carson. Concepcion, who was 15 at the time, claimed 
that the deputies' car was speeding. Officials said the deputies were 
transporting a prisoner to the Carson sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Sheriff's Department had no comment on the settlements.

Attorneys for the man charged with the murder of a 14-year-old Chatsworth girl 
and the shooting of her best friend sought Monday to discredit the chief 
witness in the case against him -- the girl he is accused of sexually 
assaulting and leaving for dead in an abandoned station wagon. 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments in the trial of Roland Norman Comtois, court-appointed 
defense attorney Thomas F. Kascoutas urged jurors not to place too much 
credence in the testimony of the girl, now 16, because her memory of the events 
of Sept. 18, 1987, may have faded. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to believe her," he said. "You feel compelled to believe her. . . . 
But do not enhance her powers of perception and recollection." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege Comtois, a 60-year-old transient who has been convicted of 
attempted rape, robbery and drug dealing, fatally shot Wendy Masuhara after 
kidnaping the two girls near their Chatsworth homes. Comtois faces the death 
penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Kascoutas also contended that no physical evidence introduced during the trial 
connected Comtois to the crimes. Prosecutors acknowledged that claim, but said 
it should have no bearing on the case. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't always have physical evidence," Deputy Dist. Atty. Harold S. Lynn 
told the jury. "Sometimes you just have eyewitnesses." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the case against Comtois has relied on the testimony of the girl he is 
accused of abducting, sexually assaulting and shooting in an abandoned station 
wagon in Woolsey Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn called the girl a "wondrous waif of destiny" who was "meant to survive to 
tell you . . . what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Answering Kascoutas' claim that the girl's memory may have faded, Lynn said: 
"The issue is not whether she can remember. She issue is whether she can ever 
forget. . . . Is she going to forget the man who fired at point-blank range 
into the head of her best friend?" 
</P>
<P>
During earlier testimony, the girl, whose name was not made public, testified 
that she and Masuhara were abducted at gunpoint by Comtois and a female 
accomplice, whom police have identified as 36-year-old Marsha Lynn Ramos, as 
they walked along their Chatsworth street at about 11:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who is being tried separately, also faces the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The girl said Comtois bound and gagged both girls before ordering her to 
undress. He undressed himself and ordered the girl to orally copulate him 
before he attempted to sodomize her, she said. He later ordered Ramos to inject 
the girl with cocaine, she said. 
</P>
<P>
He then took the two girls to a deserted canyon, where he shot both in the back 
of the head as they sat in an abandoned station wagon. 
</P>
<P>
Masuhara died instantly. The other girl survived because she held up her hand 
as the gun was being fired and deflected the bullet. The bullet lodged in her 
neck, and she was found wandering Valley Circle Boulevard, holding a bloody 
sweater to her wound. 
</P>
<P>
She later identified Comtois and Ramos. 
</P>
<P>
"She must have had a guardian angel hovering over her, a guardian angel who 
saved her life," Lynn said. 
</P>
<P>
The case is expected to go to the jury later this week, following judge's 
instructions that may take several days because of the number of counts 
involved. Instructions were to begin this morning.

CLOSING REMARKS IN DRUG SLAYING DRAW 2 PICTURES OF MOTHER; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: JURORS ARE ASKED TO DECIDE WHETHER BELITA FOX IS A REMORSELESS KILLER 
OR A GOOD MOTHER WHO SHOT TO DEATH A MAN TO PROTECT HER DAUGHTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Opposing lawyers asked a Lancaster jury Monday to decide whether Belita Fox is 
a calculating, remorseless killer or a good mother whose motive for shooting a 
construction worker to death last year was to stop a him from corrupting her 
17-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments, defense and prosecuting attorneys painted contrasting 
portraits of Fox and the man she killed, Kevin Furman, and of the small house 
on a dirt road in Lancaster where Furman was shot four times in his bed just 
after midnight Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Fox, 41, has testified at her murder trial in Lancaster Superior Court that she 
was drunk the night she went to Furman's house to warn Furman not to give drugs 
to her runaway daughter Cheryl. Fox said she shot Furman because he rose and 
moved at her menacingly. Her daughter was not at the house at the time. 
</P>
<P>
But prosectors cite physical evidence and a witness's testimony that Fox shot 
Furman, 23, repeatedly as he lay in bed, with one bullet hitting him in the 
back, and then sat by the bed as Furman died, failing to summon help for about 
40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Vincent Oliver told the jury that Fox is only guilty of "being 
a mother who wanted to protect her child." He called Furman and his roommate 
Ron McCreary, the only witness to the shooting, "drug scum" who ran a house 
where methamphetamine and other drugs were used, sold and given to teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"You've seen the news on television," Oliver said. He said the drug problem is 
"absolutely tearing our country apart. These are not good people. . . . Is 
there any wonder why Belita Fox was concerned about her daughter?" 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Foltz scoffed at the descriptions of a drug house and 
of Fox as a sympathetic figure. He accused Fox of lying, feigning emotion 
during often tearful testimony and irrationally blaming Furman for drug-related 
family problems involving Cheryl and her stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a crank house, whatever that is, just because people do crank in 
the house," Foltz said. "This is not a reasonable person. . . . She tried him, 
she judged him and she executed him." 
</P>
<P>
McCreary admitted buying drugs from Furman twice and seeing Cheryl use drugs at 
the house. But he also testified that Furman did not let Cheryl or other minors 
at the house use drugs. Homicide detectives have said they found no evidence 
that Furman was a dealer. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver called McCreary's account of the shooting biased and questioned the 
credibility of another key prosecution witness, Cynthia Wilson, a cocktail 
waitress who testified that Fox drank at a bar about four hours before the 
incident and talked of killing a man. 
</P>
<P>
"You do not have an objective witness up here testifying on the most critical 
issue on the case," Oliver said. He said the prosecution did not prove that Fox 
planned the crime, which is required for a first-degree murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
But Foltz said Wilson, who admitted that she disliked Fox, did not have enough 
motive to lie. He said further evidence of premeditation was a phone call Fox 
made to Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies a week before the shooting to 
report drug activity at Furman's house. Fox gave only vague information because 
her true motive was to build an alibi for a murder she was already planning, 
Foltz said. 
</P>
<P>
"She may be pitiful," he said. "She may be a mother. Her family may have been 
leaving her. But that does not mean that she gets to go out and kill people in 
order to get back the emotions she hasn't been getting from her family." 
</P>
<P>
The jury will begin deliberating today after receiving instructions from Judge 
Margaret Grignon. They can convict Fox as charged, convict her of a lesser 
crime such as second-degree murder or voluntary manslaughter, or acquit her 
altogether, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted as charged, Fox faces from 27 years to life in prison, Foltz said.

APPEAL COURT UPHOLDS JAIL TIME FOR ANTI-ABORTION ATTORNEY; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: THE RULING AGAINST OPERATION RESCUE'S LAWYER IS THE GROUP'S SECOND 
SETBACK IN TWO WEEKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Anti-abortion lawyer Cyrus Zal, slapped with a 90-day jail term by an El Cajon 
judge, was ordered Monday to report to jail by a San Diego appeals court that 
found his sentence justified. 
</P>
<P>
The Folsom-based lawyer was ordered to show up at the San Diego County Jail on 
June 15 by the 4th District Court of Appeal, which rejected his appeal of the 
contempt-of-court citations that El Cajon Municipal Court Judge Larrie R. 
Brainard imposed at a February trial. 
</P>
<P>
Zal was cited for repeatedly ignoring Brainard's order not to discuss abortion 
in the case, in which the lawyer represented six anti-abortion advocates 
convicted of trespass in connection with a protest last October in La Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Zal had been dispatched to the trial by the anti-abortion group Operation 
Rescue, which he then served as general counsel. The rejection of his appeal 
marked another in a recent series of legal and financial setbacks suffered both 
in San Diego and around the nation by the militant organization. 
</P>
<P>
Known for his ever-present Bible and for making it clear that he wishes to use 
the trials of abortion protesters as a platform for debating and condemning 
abortion, Zal, 42, said Monday that he was "saddened but was not surprised" by 
the appellate court decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid that the judicial system seems to have lost its conscience and any 
sense of morality, and they are simply protecting a system that protects 
child-killing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 4th District court delayed the imposition of Zal's jail term by 10 days, 
giving him time to appeal to the California Supreme Court. Zal said Monday he 
will probably pursue that avenue if he can raise $10,000 to cover his costs. 
</P>
<P>
But the three-judge 4th District panel also suggested Zal is unlikely to 
succeed in a subsequent appeal. In its opinion, the panel detailed the reasons 
for its decision -- an unusual action, considering the case was the kind in 
which courts commonly announce only a summary approval or rejection -- and 
called Brainard "patient and even-handed." 
</P>
<P>
The trial stemmed from a protest last Oct. 21 at the Family Planning Associates 
clinic in La Mesa. Before the trial began, Brainard ordered Zal not to discuss 
the morality of abortion in court, saying it was not relevant in a trespass 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
After citing Zal for contempt 20 times during the trial for disobeying that 
order, Brainard sentenced him Feb. 2 to 90 days in jail and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Zal's sentence could reach 290 days. The lawyer told the judge he could not 
afford the $10,000 fine -- and wouldn't pay it even if he could -- so Brainard 
gave him the option of paying it off at $50 for each additional day in jail, or 
200 days. 
</P>
<P>
In its opinion, the 4th District court noted that Brainard immediately held a 
hearing each time Zal violated his order not to refer to abortion and gave the 
lawyer a chance to explain his conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Although Brainard cited Zal 20 times, the judge "did not act precipitously or 
capriciously," the appeal court said. "Indeed, (Brainard) was patient and 
even-handed." 
</P>
<P>
"The jail sentence and fines do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment," 
Judge Gilbert Nares said. 
</P>
<P>
Judges Howard Wiener and Patricia Benke also took part in the appeal. The 
opinion did not indicate whether the ruling was unanimous or split. 
</P>
<P>
If he can afford to appeal Monday's decision, Zal said, the appeal will rely on 
a technicality of legal procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Though Brainard issued a written order Feb. 1 detailing the contempt citations, 
Zal said proper procedure demands that the judge issue a written order each 
time he issued a contempt citation. The 4th District court, which was presented 
with that claim, rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
In another trial last fall in Fresno, Zal was handed a 16-day jail term for 
contempt but never served it, winning an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The court decision Monday handed Operation Rescue its second significant court 
loss in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
On May 21, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand a ruling banning Operation Rescue 
activists from blocking access to New York clinics and fining the organization 
$70,000 for harassing women seeking abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The fine seems certain to add to the financial and management difficulties the 
militant group has experienced in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry announced that he was stepping 
down from day-to-day leadership of the group. Two months earlier, Terry had 
disclosed that the group was closing its Binghamton, N.Y., national 
headquarters because of debt. 
</P>
<P>
Zal said he resigned as general counsel to Operation Rescue last month, forced 
to "branch out in other fields to try to pay the bills." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, meanwhile, anti-abortion protesters arrested last year at clinic 
blockades suffered overwhelming losses in jury trials last fall and earlier 
this year, prompting dramatic alterations in the style and form of local 
demonstrations against abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than rally at one clinic, where police would arrest dozens of people, 
anti-abortion advocates have taken to brief, simultaneous protests at a number 
of clinics, where arrests have been minimal. Abortion protests also have been 
staged along Harbor Drive, with thousands of activists holding signs and 
forming what they call a "life chain." 
</P>
<P>
In March, confirming the change in strategy, Zal said San Diego anti-abortion 
forces were no longer interested in putting police and courts "through all this 
unnecessary work."

COMMENTARY;

MIKAN WAS THE GIANT OF HIS DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Mikan likes to tell about being the good-natured giant of his day, of 
the time he made the mistake of bringing an offensive rebound low enough for 
Red Holzman to tie him up. So they had a jump ball at Mikan's free-throw line 
-- little Red against big George. "The referee tossed the ball up and I tipped 
it into the basket; two points," Mikan said. Ha, ha. Holzman called him a big 
(unprintable). Ha, ha again. In the enormous boom of basketball, the game never 
has properly honored its roots. At the recent "Night of 100 Stars," Mikan was 
introduced, limped across the stage and waved to a crowd of mostly unknowing 
stares. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's he?" 
</P>
<P>
He's the Babe Ruth of basketball, that's all. Except that they didn't move the 
fences back and make them tall for Ruth the way they did for Mikan. He changed 
the course of basketball as a player. He wore No. 99. It was only 35 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The National Basketball Association was called the Basketball Association of 
America for two years before the merger. Mikan played in the National 
Basketball League, which was poo-pooed because it had teams in Sheboygan, Wis., 
and Anderson, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
It had Mikan, who invented the big man. He was 6-foot-10 and as broad at a time 
when hardly anybody else was. "He could move down the court," Bob Cousy 
recalls. "He'd get down and wipe you out at his end." 
</P>
<P>
Mikan's Minneapolis Lakers won the NBL championship and then earned five titles 
in their first six seasons in the merged NBA. It was like the Cleveland Browns 
joining the haughty National Football League and doing the same thing they did 
to the All-America Conference. The one year the Lakers lost, in 1951, was when 
Mikan had a broken leg and Rochester with Holzman beat them. "The doctors taped 
a plate on it for the playoffs," Mikan said. "I played all right, scored in the 
20s. I couldn't run, sort of hopped down the court." 
</P>
<P>
He says if you watch the old black-and-white films you'll see that the game 
hasn't changed all that much -- except they used the two-hand set shot and the 
jump shot was still being invented and all the black players were still with 
the Harlem Globetrotters. That's all. 
</P>
<P>
And you won't see a dunk. It was illegal because of him, he says. In college, 
at DePaul, he would bat the ball out of the basket, so they instituted rules 
against goaltending, and included offensive goaltending. "We used to dunk in 
pregame practice, not in the game," Mikan said. "If they didn't get rid of that 
rule, there'd be no Michael Jordan." 
</P>
<P>
Because of Mikan the three-second lane was widened from 6 feet to 12 feet, and 
to the present 16 feet. And the shot clock was created. 
</P>
<P>
In 1950 the Fort Wayne Pistons held the ball against the Lakers, beating them 
19-18 in the lowest-scoring game in NBA history. "They wouldn't play," Mikan 
said. The 24-second rule came in three seasons later. "That game was the 
biggest cause," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also was the first commissioner of the red-white-and-blue ABA. The 
three-colored ball came and went with his league, but the three-point shot 
stayed. Mikan might have changed the history of the game again if he'd been 
more effective. Uniondale might have been the capital of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was graduating from UCLA as Lew Alcindor and Mikan's owners 
got together to draft Alcindor and share the cost for the New York franchise, 
which was the Nets en route from Commack to the Nassau Coliseum. "We felt if we 
could get accepted in New York, we'd be accepted anywhere," Mikan said. "The 
secondary plan was to have each team sign one top player from the other league. 
They wouldn't follow my direction." 
</P>
<P>
They did steal Rick Barry and prepared a check for $1 million for Alcindor, who 
said he wanted to play in New York or California. He said that he'd take just 
one offer from each league. "One million was beyond anybody's imagination," 
Mikan said. "It was a shock when he turned us down and went to Milwaukee. We 
thought a million was a pretty good deal in 1968." We can only guess what would 
have evolved if Abdul-Jabbar had played his 19 seasons with the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
Mikan left his mark as a player. "We were playing Rochester and when I got a 
defensive rebound, Les Harrison wanted Holzman to stand right in front of me so 
I couldn't get upcourt. The first time, I knocked Red 15 feet. He yelled to 
Harrison, 'If you want it done, do it yourself."' 
</P>
<P>
I'd take my chances with this team against anybody: Jerry West, Oscar Robertson 
and Bob Cousy at guard; Elgin Baylor, Bob Pettit and Bill Russell at forward 
and Wilt Chamberlain at center. 
</P>
<P>
Today Cousy would be John Stockton. An assist was an assist then; none of these 
assists for passing out for a three-point shot. 
</P>
<P>
"No question they'd do fine," Knicks assistant Paul Silas said. "Those guys 
were a lot more fundamentally sound than players of today. Today there's a lot 
of flash. These guys throw passes behind their backs; what a pass is supposed 
to do is get the ball from one point to the other. The two-hand chest pass is 
still the best pass." 
</P>
<P>
Mikan said that he loves the present game; he buys the excesses as so much show 
business. Silas and Cousy are not quite so permissive. 
</P>
<P>
"The game hasn't changed, the athlete has changed," Cousy said not too long 
ago, citing the 6-7, 280-pound football player who runs 40 yards in four 
seconds. "In basketball you see 7-foot guys doing things of a 6-footer. We shot 
40 percent; that wouldn't get you by in Division III." 
</P>
<P>
Cousy popularized the flash that consumes so much of today's game, except that 
he used the flash when the orthodox wouldn't do. He dribbled behind his back 
the first time in a game because he was being overplayed. "Today every 
12-year-old in the schoolyard is doing it, probably better," he said. "But they 
do it bringing it upcourt to no advantage."

SOCKERS' MOP MOPS THE BLAST INTO A CORNER 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
The mop mopped up the Baltimore Blast Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
That's really about what this Wes Wade guy looks like. A muscular mop. When the 
rookie Socker forward comes flying down the carpet, you almost look for a 
microphone and expect him to start belting out "Stairway to Heaven" or 
something equally rock-and-rollish. 
</P>
<P>
But the only melody he created Monday was with his feet, scoring a hat trick to 
help the Sockers to a 4-1 victory over the Blast before 7,834 in the San Diego 
Sports Arena. The Sockers now have a 3-1 advantage in the best-of-seven MISL 
championship series and can wrap it up at home with a victory in Game 5 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
First things first. Wes, thought about a rock and roll career? 
</P>
<P>
"No," he said. "I have no rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not on stage. On the field, certainly. 
</P>
<P>
A recap: 
</P>
<P>
Third quarter. Wade took a pass from midfielder Brian Quinn in full stride and 
sent one in from 30 feet with his right foot. Sockers 1, Blast 0. 
</P>
<P>
After a Freddie Thompson goal tied the score, forward Paul Wright took an 
errant Blast pass off the boards and advanced it up the left sideline. Wade 
moved to his inside and took a pass near the top of the penalty box and scored 
right footed. Sox 2, Blast 1. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth quarter. Midfielder Branko Segota puts the Sockers up 3-1 with 8:01 to 
play. Then, after Baltimore put in Bruce Savage as its sixth attacker, Wade 
sent the ball through his legs for his final goal. 
</P>
<P>
Never in his wildest dreams did this 21-year-old guy who serves mainly as a 
defensive runner imagine he would do this. 
</P>
<P>
"I did surprise them," he said, "because I surprised myself." 
</P>
<P>
And what his accomplishment did most was prove that this Socker team is more 
versatile and diverse than last year's. It relies on many rather than few. A 
star was found in the supporting cast on this night. 
</P>
<P>
"He's paid his dues," Quinn said. "He's the kind of player that does whatever 
is asked of him. That's the kind of thing that makes a team click." 
</P>
<P>
Wade's first two goals helped the Sockers win the third quarter, 2-1. Baltimore 
sandwiched a goal in between Wade's when Thompson touched in a nice pass from 
defender Rusty Troy, who hit the ball cleanly as it came down from high in the 
air off the boards. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore was awarded a power play with 23 seconds remaining in the third 
quarter when Socker midfielder Ben Collins was called for tripping Thompson. 
The Sockers killed the penalty with relative ease. 
</P>
<P>
Blast defender Mike Stankovic gave the Sockers their second power play 
opportunity 4:36 into the fourth quarter when he tripped Wright. As usual, the 
Sockers failed to capitalize. They have scored just three times in 26 
opportunities during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, it made no difference. Less than a minute later, Segota 
scored his fourth goal in three games, slipping behind Stankovic and sending it 
into the left corner with his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Saturday's game, Baltimore went conservative on the Sockers in 
the first half, falling back on their goal and pushing it forward only when it 
was safe. The Sockers matched them defensively, making timely blocks and 
relying on the steady goal keeping of Zoltan Toth, who won his seventh playoff 
game in eight starts. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers had their best opportunity of the first half with just more than 
three minutes remaining in the first quarter. Forward Paul Wright was doing a 
few jitterbug steps in the middle of the Blast penalty box and was bumped to 
the ground. He managed to get his heel on the ball and it rolled through the 
legs of goalie Scoop Stanisic. 
</P>
<P>
Stanisic did an about-face and pounced on the ball as it rolled onto the goal 
line. Socker forward Rod Castro smashed into Stanisic. It looked as if the ball 
might be over the line but the referee called a foul and Castro and Baltimore 
received a free kick. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the second quarter, former Socker Paul Dougherty was assessed a 
two-minute penalty for tripping Castro and the Sockers went on the power play. 
Midfielders Waad Hirmez and Segota took their hacks to no avail and the Blast 
killed off the penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gives the Sockers the same opportunity they had last year. All 
week, this team has talked of winning a championship in front of the San Diego 
fans, something they it hasn't done since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the Socker were up 3-1 in this series and lost Game 5 and had to 
return to Baltimore. Will the Blast do that to them again? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think so," Wright said. "I don't see it. I think we're playing really 
well right now." 
</P>
<P>
Socker Coach Ron Newman remains cautious but you can tell he has a good feeling 
about this series. Maybe he has finally found the team he has searched for 
through a season of mishaps.

Tony Skole singled home Anthony Jenkins in the 12th inning Monday to lift The 
Citadel to an 8-7 victory over Cal State Fullerton in an elimination game of 
the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins singled to open the inning, moved up on a wild pitch by Chris Robinson 
(3-4) and came home on Skole's single to right. 
</P>
<P>
Skole's single in the 10th inning drove in Chris Coker for a 7-6 Citadel lead. 
But Fullerton tied it in the bottom of the inning when Kevin Farlow singled, 
took third on a sacrifice and an infield single, and scored on Phil Nevin's 
single to left. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Kraft (4-1), who pitched out of a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the 10th, 
ended the game by striking out Mate Borgogno with the tying run at third. 
</P>
<P>
The Citadel (46-13), at No. 7 the lowest remaining seed in the tournament, 
faces another elimination game Tuesday night against the loser of Monday 
night's Louisiana State-Oklahoma State game. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (36-23) led, 4-1, early but had to come back from a 6-4 deficit in 
the eighth to force extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Bunch walked to open the eighth, went to third on a single by Dave Ayala 
and scored when catcher Larry Hutto threw wildly to second on Ayala's steal 
attempt. Ayala went to third on the play and scored the tying run on Domingo 
Mota's single. 
</P>
<P>
Doubles by Jenkins and Coker gave The Citadel a 1-0 lead in the first. 
Fullerton tied it in the second when Frank Charles scored from second on 
Farlow's two-out single. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans scored twice in the third after Nevin reached base on a throwing 
error by shortstop Scott Elvington, one of seven Citadel miscues that led to 
three unearned runs. Nevin scored from second on a single by Borgogno, who came 
around on singles by Matt Hattabaugh and Charles. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton made it 4-1 in the sixth, when Farlow singled and went to second when 
Elvington booted Ayala's potential double-play grounder. Mota grounded to 
second baseman Dan McDonnell, who stepped on second for the force. McDonnell's 
relay throw to first was in the dirt and Farlow scored. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Baker's home run leading off the seventh brought the Citadel to within 
4-2, and the Bulldogs made it 4-3 when Jason Rychlick reached base on Farlow's 
fielding error at shortstop and scored out later on McDonnell's double. 
</P>
<P>
Baker singled in a run and Rychlick had a two-run, two-out single to give the 
Citadel a 6-4 lead in the eighth.

PADRES DRAFT HARD-THROWING, TEXAS HIGH SCHOOL LEFT-HANDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Padres went for youth and power Monday with their first-round choice in the 
major league draft. 
</P>
<P>
They used their pick -- 25th -- on left-handed pitcher Robbie Beckett, a 
hard-thrower from McCallum High School in Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great feeling to know the Padres wanted me," Beckett said. "I'm happy 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
Beckett, 6-feet-5 and 225 pounds, went 5-6 this season with a 3.05 earned-run 
average. 
</P>
<P>
But those aren't the numbers that tell Beckett's story. The important ones: 
First, he is 17. Next, take a look at this: in 70 innings this season, he 
allowed just 27 hits, struck out 128 -- and walked 127. But he throws in the 
90-mile-per-hour range, and the Padres figure he can work out the control 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"You can correct a control problem," Padre Manager Jack McKeon said. "If a guy 
doesn't have a good arm, you can't correct that." 
</P>
<P>
Beckett said he was watching a movie when Padre scout Kevin Towers called with 
the news that he had been drafted at 2:30 p.m. The movie was "Major League." 
And, no, he said, he didn't necessarily identify with Wild Thing, the goofy 
relief pitcher played by Charlie Sheen, despite his inconsistent control. 
</P>
<P>
Quite simply, his arm is what has the Padres excited. And it didn't matter that 
he was in high school instead of college. 
</P>
<P>
"College, high school . . . we wanted the best available athlete to us," said 
Randy Smith, Padre director of scouting. 
</P>
<P>
Beckett is the first high school player selected by the Padres in the first 
round since pitcher Jimmy Jones in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Towers, also a first-round Padre selection in the 1982 June draft, is the Padre 
scout responsible for the Austin, Tex. area and first saw Beckett last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I said he was Steve Carlton the first time I saw him," Towers said. "He has an 
above-average fastball and a slider in the 80-82 m.p.h. range. In competition, 
he showed fairly good poise for a high school kid, and I liked the way he went 
after hitters." 
</P>
<P>
Beckett, who won't turn 18 until July, thought he might go in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping and praying and dreaming I would," he said. "I was looking at the 
first three rounds. When it happened, it knocked my socks off." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Padres have to sign him before whisking him off to one of their minor 
league teams this summer. Beckett said he doesn't have an agent, and wouldn't 
comment on what it will take for the Padres to sign him. 
</P>
<P>
He did say, though, that he has enrolled at McLennan Community College in Waco, 
Tex. in case things don't work out with the Padres. If he plays at a community 
college, he would be eligible for next year's major league draft. If he would 
play at a four-year school, rules stipulate that he would have to wait three 
years before being eligible for the draft again. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents want me to do whatever makes me happy," Beckett said. "They're 
behind me, whatever decision I make." 
</P>
<P>
Beckett said he first realized he may have the tools to play professional 
baseball last summer, when his fastball first reached the 90 m.p.h. range. He 
said it happened in a summer league game, coincidentally, against fellow Texan 
Todd Van Poppel's team. Van Poppel was the most highly publicized high school 
player in this year's draft, but wasn't chosen until 14th overall -- by Oakland 
-- because he made it clear that he will attend the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"In the south part of the state -- my region -- (Beckett's) name was the big 
name," Towers said. "He was the guy going into the season that everybody wanted 
to see." 
</P>
<P>
Beckett throws hard, mostly fastballs and sliders. He said he has been working 
on his curve, and needs to work on a change-up. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I've needed to do against competition so far is throw a 
fastball, slider and occasional curve," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One other thing. Beckett says he is 6-5, but he said doctors say he's 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"Six-six seems kind of Amazonish," he said. "I should be playing basketball if 
I'm 6-6." 
</P>
<P>
Oh.

CALIFORNIA &amp; CO.: FOR LEVERAGETTES, BIG DEBT IS A WAY OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY ANDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Californians seem to go further into debt than any other people on Earth. Let's 
call them the Leveragettes. 
</P>
<P>
They borrow much more to buy a house; the median home loan in California last 
year was $145,500 -- more than four times the state's typical household income. 
They're fearless about buying cars on time; 53% of the more than 25 million 
vehicles registered to California owners are still being paid for. They also 
run up their credit card balances higher and take out more personal loans than 
anybody else would dare to. 
</P>
<P>
This makes them a banker's dream, as they flagrantly ignore their grandparents' 
warnings about going into debt and courting disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Are the Leveragettes living as if there were no tomorrow? Will they panic if 
the state's inflated home prices continue to drop and big aerospace layoffs 
continue to result from the "peace dividend?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer, surprisingly, seems to be no. Perhaps more than any other 
Americans, Californians have become sophisticated users of consumer credit and 
creative managers of the household budget. For longer than anybody else, they 
have been buying on the installment plan and somehow making payments through 
good times and bad. 
</P>
<P>
The credit for this sophistication about credit must go, in large part, to 
Amadeo Peter Giannini (1870-1949), founder of San Francisco's Bank of Italy, 
which later became Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
The son of immigrants, Giannini built up his little bank with innovations that 
made credit easy to get and that have been copied by banks around the world. 
The most notable were home loans with low down payments and monthly 
installments, lending to people who were good risks but had little or no 
collateral and opening convenient neighborhood branches across the state. 
</P>
<P>
His successors went a step further in the 1960s with Bankamericard, which 
became the first successful mass-market bank credit card and opened the door to 
vastly increased consumer installment debt in the past 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Giannini's legacy continues to turn credit-fearing immigrants from places as 
different as Taiwan and Indiana into credit-embracing Californians, unafraid to 
borrow money and amazingly good about paying it back. 
</P>
<P>
One measure of how well state residents handle credit is the relatively low 
rate of delinquency on loans. Banks define delinquency as being two months 
behind on payments. Nationally, according to the American Bankers Assn., 2.64% 
of all consumer debt -- from car loans to credit cards -- was delinquent at the 
end of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But in California, despite its huge and economically diverse population, the 
rate was just 1.9%. For car loans by themselves, the national rate was 2.03% 
and the California rate was 1.2%. Maybe that reflects the importance that 
Californians attach to their cars. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we carry more debt here is neither good nor bad," says Brian 
O'Hare, Bank of America's senior vice president for consumer credit cards. "But 
in terms of repayment, we are better than many other states. People in 
California treat their credit with respect." 
</P>
<P>
More is at work here, however, than just a tradition of borrowing to afford the 
California lifestyle. It has to do with the sense of economic well-being and 
what that depends on. 
</P>
<P>
Californians enjoy higher personal and household incomes than the nation as a 
whole. The state's per-capita income in 1988 was $18,866, more than 14% higher 
than the national average. The typical household income in California was 
$30,200 in 1987, about 16% higher than the nation as a whole. That means that 
people here have more money to spend -- and therefore are less worried about 
going into debt. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest form of consumer debt, of course, is the home mortgage. And in 
California people spend far more for a house than Americans do anyplace else. 
</P>
<P>
The median sale price of an existing single-family house in California last 
year was $189,500, up a whopping 65% from 1984. That compares to the U.S. 
median price of $93,900 -- up 30% in five years but still less than half the 
typical California price. 
</P>
<P>
Californians have grown accustomed to, even comfortable with, soaring home 
prices. It seems to give them an underpinning for all their other credit 
purchases. After all, so the reasoning goes, if you already owe $150,000 on the 
house, what's a mere $20,000 for a car? 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the comfort of knowing that your house is worth so much money may 
give you confidence to take on more debt, since the home equity could always be 
tapped to pay bills. 
</P>
<P>
And, in the tradition of A. P. Giannini, Californians continue to find 
innovative ways to buy expensive homes and consumer goods. For instance, a 
growing number of "economic households" are being formed: unrelated people who 
otherwise could not afford the payments coming together to buy a house or car. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the immigrants who arrived in the 1980s are adapting Old World 
financing methods to Golden State needs. Many of the state's new Korean-born 
merchants, for instance, use investment clubs -- a type of private savings pool 
-- to buy their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
And Californians are stretching out their payments ever longer to bring down 
their monthly expenditures. The typical car loan is now 54 months; a generation 
ago it was 24 months. The percentage of people who run a balance on their bank 
credit cards has grown to 50%; 25 years ago, it was virtually zero. 
</P>
<P>
These days, a number of economists are worried about a potential long-term 
stall in the California housing market. The typical price of a single-family 
house here dropped by 2% in April compared to April, 1989, the first 
year-to-year decline in five years. 
</P>
<P>
If the price of California homes stops rising or worse, what happens to the 
carefree Leveragette lifestyle? If the expectation of expensive houses 
evaporates, what supports the urge to borrow freely -- especially if 
unemployment begins to rise? In the end, some support may still come from 
Giannini's legacy. He made his reputation by offering easy credit to those 
whose economic lives were shattered by the San Francisco earthquake of 1906. 
</P>
<P>
And since then, Californians have seemed to breathe easy, believing that credit 
will still be available here in bad times as well as good.

MIKE GLICKMAN REALTY EXPECTED TO CEASE ALL OPERATIONS THIS WEEK; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: A SHUTDOWN WOULD BE AN EMBARRASSING TURNABOUT FOR THE 30-YEAR-OLD 
WHO BUILT THE VALLEY'S BIGGEST RESIDENTIAL BROKERAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Glickman Realty Inc., the San Fernando Valley's largest residential real 
estate brokerage firm, will close all of its offices and lay off its more than 
1,200 agents by Wednesday, industry sources and Glickman agents said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, agents said owner Mike Glickman has told them that he intends to 
liquidate the company through bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Glickman, who until recently steadfastly denied rumors of impending failure, 
would not return phone calls. A company spokeswoman said only that a "major 
announcement" will be made Wednesday morning at Glickman's Woodland Hills 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The downfall of the firm would represent an embarrassing turnabout for the 
30-year-old Glickman, once a Wunderkind of the local real estate market. 
Glickman started in the real estate business when he was 15 by delivering 
flyers for local real estate agents. He started his own company in 1983 and 
quickly built it into the Valley's largest brokerage firm. But Glickman's rapid 
expansion during the overheated market of 1987 and 1988 and the subsequent 
slowdown of real estate sales were blamed Monday for the company's demise. 
</P>
<P>
In April, sales of existing, single-family homes declined 27% in the Los 
Angeles area from a year earlier, according to the California Assn. of 
Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a young man. He built a large organization. He grew too quickly. 
Frankly, I feel sorry for him," said Fred Sands, owner of Brentwood-based Fred 
Sands Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Glickman's agents said they were notified at a companywide meeting 
Sunday night that they were being laid off and that they had until Wednesday 
morning to clear out of their offices. "He said he's going to go through 
bankruptcy and then look for what to do in the real estate business," said 
Sammy Yosef, a Glickman agent in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
On May 1, Glickman closed offices in Brentwood, Beverly Hills and Sherman Oaks 
and said he would cut his work force -- then about 1,600 agents -- by about 15% 
during the next several months. The five remaining offices to close Wednesday 
are in Woodland Hills, Encino, Sherman Oaks, Northridge and Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
There was speculation throughout the industry Monday that another large real 
estate company, such as Jon Douglas Co. of Beverly Hills, would buy some of 
Glickman's offices. In a phone interview, Douglas would not confirm or deny 
those rumors but said he hadn't spoken to Glickman since last week, when he had 
a "general discussion" with him regarding the real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas added that "if Mike or his top people were available, we'd be 
interested." 
</P>
<P>
Sands said Glickman was letting his agents take their listings with them as 
they moved to other companies, but Glickman would retain a 10% referral fee. 
</P>
<P>
What remains to be determined is what would happen to commissions on properties 
currently in escrow if Glickman liquidates his company in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
After last month's office closures, rumors proliferated throughout the real 
estate community that Glickman was in a financial crisis. In an interview with 
The Times, Glickman admitted that he was behind in payments to creditors and 
that he was cutting expenses such as free lunches and valet parking for his 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
Glickman said the company had more than 200 creditors. The Los Angeles Times 
and the Daily News were the two biggest creditors, and he owed them more than 
$100,000 apiece, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also acknowledged that he had sold his interest in seven Valley-area homes 
in order to raise $150,000 for Glickman Realty. 
</P>
<P>
However, Glickman at the time also said: "We definitely have not considered 
bankruptcy. I'll be around forever." 
</P>
<P>
Ofra Levensohn, an agent at Glickman's Woodland Hills office, said she was 
shocked and angry when she learned about the office closures Monday morning. 
"He kept telling us everything was nice and dandy," Levensohn said. 
</P>
<P>
But others said they weren't surprised by Glickman's announcement. "I knew it 
was coming for a long time," said Omar Sadat, also a Glickman agent in Woodland 
Hills. "The signs started about a month ago, the way he started cutting 
things." 
</P>
<P>
Other real estate companies moved quickly Monday to lure Glickman agents -- and 
their listings -- to their firms. At various hotels around the Valley, hundreds 
of Glickman agents met with officials of Fred Sands, Prudential California 
Realty and other firms. 
</P>
<P>
At the Marriott in Woodland Hills, more than 100 Glickman agents turned out to 
discuss opportunities with Prudential executives. "Our phones have been ringing 
off the hook" with calls from Glickman agents looking for work, said Rick 
Merrill, president of Prudential's central region, which includes the Valley.

SEMATECH ALLIANCE FACES NEW HURDLE WITH NOYCE'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the beginning, life has been difficult for Sematech. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, the charter of the ambitious 3-year-old government-and-industry 
consortium -- to breathe new life into the domestic chip business by developing 
and dispersing state-of-the-art technology -- is enormous. Even with Robert 
Noyce, the larger-than-life scientist and businessman, at its helm, the 
consortium endured criticism from within its own industry, and was the target 
of Bush Administration officials anxious to scale back projects smacking of an 
"industrial policy." 
</P>
<P>
Now, with Noyce's death from a heart attack Sunday, Sematech faces an array of 
new challenges, not the least of which will be to persuade the federal 
government to continue, or even increase, its annual $100 million in 
contributions to the consortium after the initial funding expires in 2 1/2 
years. Sematech's 14 members contribute a total of more than $100 million each 
year, and lend the services of hundreds of scientists. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Noyce's death, success was far from assured. And without the 
charismatic leader, its prospects are less certain.

"The support for Sematech has been building in Congress," said Rep. Mel Levine, 
(D-Santa Monica). "But without Bob Noyce, whose voice transcended politics, the 
bad guys in the Administration have one fewer adversary to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
A strong voice for cooperative efforts in the electronics industry was lost 
earlier this spring when Craig Fields, a high-ranking official in the Defense 
Department's advanced research funding office, was forced to step aside amid 
Administration concerns that he was going too far in his advocacy of government 
assistance for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Noyce, co-inventor of the integrated circuit and co-founder of chip maker Intel 
Corp., reluctantly accepted Sematech's top spot nearly two years ago after the 
consortium tried for months to find a willing and suitable leader. However, he 
always was the group's top choice for the job, the one man industry leaders 
said could pull together the consortium's 14 member companies and U.S. 
government into a unified research and manufacturing operation dedicated to 
jump-starting the sagging U.S. semiconductor industry. 
</P>
<P>
But the job proved difficult in the beginning, even for Noyce. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said it took Sematech at least 18 months to develop a 
potentially winning strategy and then begin to execute it. The game plan, which 
came together in the last year, focuses the consortium's efforts to shore up 
the nation's "semiconductor infrastructure," a loose-knit set of technologies 
and companies required to manufacture the state-of-the-art chips that are a 
part of a wide spectrum of consumer and industrial electronics. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Borrus, from the Berkeley Roundtable on International Economics, said 
Sematech had to choose between two possible strategies early on. On the one 
hand, he said, they could take a short-term approach of improving the overall 
abilities of basic semiconductor manufacturing and its suppliers, or they could 
pursue a longer-term strategy of developing new technologies, gambling that 
they could steal a beat on the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"They chose the short term on the theory that if they didn't focus on that 
immediately, the long term wouldn't matter," Borrus said. 
</P>
<P>
Over its first five years, Sematech's goal is to develop the technological and 
manufacturing expertise to produce large quantities of semiconductors with 
circuit widths of 0.35 microns, or about 300 times finer than a human hair. 
</P>
<P>
Sematech officials say they are on target for achieving that objective. 
</P>
<P>
According to Borrus, Sematech's most obvious accomplishment to date was its 
role in guiding the purchase of Perkin-Elmer's optical lithography unit by a 
small Silicon Valley company, away from the Japanese camera giant, Nikon. 
</P>
<P>
Noyce apparently sensed that the consortium was finally on an even keel 
operationally in April when he signalled his intention to step away from 
guiding daily operations by year-end to concentrate exclusively on lobbying the 
government and public on the group's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Noyce had begun to search for his own replacement before he died. 
Sematech insiders said Noyce had already prepared a list of eight possible 
replacements and had started to talk to consortium members and others about the 
selection. Insiders said no front-runner has emerged. 
</P>
<P>
However, three men are said to have expressed strong interest in the position 
before Noyce's death: Sanford Kane, a former IBM executive who headed the 
unsuccessful effort last year to create U.S. Memories, a chip-making 
cooperative; Paul Castrucci, a former IBM executive and second-ranking Sematech 
official forced out last year by Noyce, and Larry W. Sumney, a former Pentagon 
official now heading the Semiconductor Research Corp. in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Sematech members have their own favorites. Among those 
mentioned as Noyce's successor are: Gil Amelio, head of Rockwell 
International's semiconductor operation; Gordon Moore, co-chairman of Intel; 
Andrew Grove, Intel's chief executive, and Robert Galvin, the retired leader of 
Motorola Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Sematech officials and members said a selection should be made within 60 days.

AUDIOVISUAL DEVICE -- THE NEXT WAVE IN HOME ELECTRONICS? ; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: DUBBED CD-I, IT COMBINES THE INTERACTION OF VIDEO GAMES WITH THE 
PICTURE CLARITY OF VIDEOTAPES AND THE SOUND OF A COMPACT DISC. 
</P>

<P>
Bored with video games? Seen all the latest videos? Your compact discs 
collecting dust? Not to worry. The creators of CDs are working on the next wave 
in home entertainment: an audiovisual device that combines the interaction of 
video games, the visual quality of videotapes and the sound of a compact disc. 
</P>
<P>
Called Compact Disc Interactive (or CD-I), the product being developed by Sony 
Corp. and N. V. Philips is so unlike any other home electronic product offered 
to consumers that the two companies have had difficulty even describing what it 
does. The machine, which resembles a CD player and plays existing CDs as well 
as the new CD-I software, connects to any television and allows viewers to use 
a remote control device and joystick to randomly journey through -- and 
sometimes alter the sequence, color, sound or context of -- video presentations 
that explore everything from golf games to exhibits at the Smithsonian 
Institution. 
</P>
<P>
Based on so-called multimedia technology, a professional version of the product 
is already being sold to industrial users such as French car maker Renault, 
which employs CD-I to help train its mechanics. But next year, Philips, Sony 
and a dozen other big Japanese consumer electronics companies say they will 
enter the potentially more lucrative mass market and sell a $1,000 consumer 
version. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the next major revolution in home entertainment," said Gordon 
Stulburg, chairman of American Media Interactive, the Los Angeles-based 
subsidiary of Philips that is overseeing the development of CD-I. "It's a 
single . . . user-friendly machine that, in addition to playing a standard CD, 
will do a whole lot of other things when hooked up to your TV." 
</P>
<P>
The new product, which aims to compete with the hugely successful videocassette 
recorder, comes at a critical time for Philips. The Dutch conglomerate in the 
past five years has closed more than 75 factories and cut its work force by 
more than 40,000. Although Philips is a major computer manufacturer, its CD-I 
product will face a crowded field that has already attracted some of the 
biggest names in entertainment and electronics, including International 
Business Machines Corp., Intel Corp., Microsoft Corp., Apple Computer Co., Time 
Warner Inc. and a host of others. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be very difficult to capture the part of the market they are 
going after," said Stan Cornyn, president of Warner New Media, a unit of Time 
Warner that is developing multimedia software for a variety of companies. "The 
CD had no competitors. All they had to do was lift the music off the LP and put 
it on CD. What has to happen with . . . this technology is you start from zero 
and invent the content that will go on the discs. Then you have to persuade a 
consumer that it's something he really needs in his home." 
</P>
<P>
The product that American Media has been quietly developing is a 
computer-controlled audiovisual system, which, like competitors' devices, is 
loosely based on multimedia technology. 
</P>
<P>
A multimedia computer is one that has the capability to process various types 
of media such as text, graphics, animation, video and audio at the same time. 
The systems permit enormous flexibility in how video and sound information can 
be edited, manipulated and displayed and thus, say some observers, provides a 
richer viewing experience than watching ordinary TV or simple computer 
graphics. 
</P>
<P>
American Media has several disc programs under development including a video 
golf game that features a motion-picture quality 18-hole course, 
user-selectable golf clubs and a color commentator who describes shots made by 
the player. Also in the works are discs based on the TV show "Sesame Street" as 
well as a video tour of 200 Smithsonian Institution exhibits, including one 
featuring a special sonic effect that imitates an airplane breaking the sound 
barrier. 
</P>
<P>
Not since 1984, when Apple popularized easy-to-use graphics with its Macintosh 
computer, has there been such a big leap forward in computer user-friendliness 
or such excitement in the computer and entertainment fields about the potential 
commercial applications of a new technology, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"Multimedia has profound implications; it will alter the very fundamentals of 
our business," said Peter B. Blakeney, who heads IBM's multimedia division. 
"Multimedia will change the world in the 1990s as personal computing did in the 
1980s," Apple Chairman John Sculley has declared. 
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 300,000 computers equipped with CD drives and about 
2,500 commercial CD titles, according to Nick Arnett, president of Multimedia 
Computing, an industry publishing and consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Multimedia retail sales are forecast to rise to $13.6 billion by 1994 from $3.7 
billion this year, with consumer products representing about 25% of the 1994 
total, according to Information Workstation Group in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
But with at least 10 major companies promoting several different multimedia 
systems, confusion and incompatibility problems may thwart quick consumer and 
U.S. industry acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, experts expect the multimedia market will settle into three broad 
applications: low-priced systems offering interactive video games; a 
medium-priced system such as CD-I, marketed as a fancy VCR for families, and 
expensive computer-based systems allowing broader creative control over the 
presentation of information for business and education. 
</P>
<P>
"There's lots of excitement about" the technology, said Elizabeth Daley, 
chairwoman of USC's film and television production program. But she cautioned 
that "for a generation that grew up with the printed page, I think the learning 
curve (for multimedia) will be long." 
</P>
<P>
Philips thought the evolution to multimedia would be fairly easy back in 1986 
when it teamed up with Sony in an important European-Japanese partnership. But 
in October, 1988, Intel Corp. acquired a technology from General Electric Co. 
that stole CD-I's thunder. 
</P>
<P>
The technology, called Digital Video Interactive, features full-motion video 
and can electronically compress video images to produce animated scenes. 
Philips and Sony had forecast that such technology would not be available until 
the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Already four years behind schedule, the prospects for CD-I seemed to dim 
further at the 1989 Microsoft CD-ROM conference when IBM endorsed Intel's 
technology, while Philips remained mum about its plans. 
</P>
<P>
The company is now more upbeat and predicts CD-I will sell 40,000 units next 
year and eventually achieve the 20% penetration of U.S. homes now held by CD 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to our approach is that, instead of getting consumers to buy a whole 
bunch of different types of black boxes for their home, we will be promoting 
only one multifunction box -- CD-I," said Emiel N. Petrone, a former Polygram 
executive who is American Media' senior vice president for sales. 
</P>
<P>
Although more than 60 firms, including Time-Life, Rand McNally and the 
Smithsonian are developing multimedia programs for CD-I, their efforts are 
being slowed by the technical hurdles of combining audio, still images, text 
and full motion video into the new format. 
</P>
<P>
A relatively sophisticated computer game can cost $250,000 to produce. But the 
average multimedia presentation costs upwards of $400,000 and takes months to 
produce, said David Riordan, vice president of product development at 
Cinemaware Corp., a Westlake Village company that makes multimedia 
presentations for NEC, Walt Disney Co. and American Media. 
</P>
<P>
Yet a great deal will be riding on the initial CD-I discs turned out by 
American Media, and consumers could be turned off by presentations that are too 
complex or boring, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"People really get into this product and they get hooked fast," said Riordan, 
who has watched consumer focus groups sample the CD-I product. "But they have 
to see it first. That's the key."

Ford Issues Directive on Warranty Work: Ford Motor Co. has told its dealers 
that it expects them to perform warranty service on all Ford, Lincoln or 
Mercury cars, even if the car was purchased elsewhere, a company spokeswoman 
said. The new policy will take effect Sept. 1. N.Y. York Atty. Gen. Robert 
Abrams, who announced the change in Albany, N.Y., said a Ford dealer's decision 
to provide warranty service on cars purchased elsewhere is the exception rather 
than the rule, adding that Ford agreed to change its policy after talks with 
his office.

RALPHS NARROWS ITS LOSS SHARPLY DURING QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ralphs Grocery Co., showing strong improvement financially, said Monday that it 
narrowed its first-quarter loss to $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
The heavily indebted company, the No. 3 supermarket chain in Southern 
California, lost $7 million a year earlier. Sales climbed 8.5% to $620.9 
million in the quarter ended April 22. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts were particularly impressed with the company's operating cash flow. A 
key gauge of performance for companies burdened with debt, operating cash flow 
is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other 
accounting adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
Ralphs' first-quarter cash flow totaled $52.9 million, or 8.5% of its sales 
volume, up from 7.1% a year ago. By comparison, the cash flow of Vons -- the 
No. 1 supermarket chain in Southern California -- was 4.9% of sales in its 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"To even be anywhere near 8% is phenomenal," said Meredith Adler, an analyst 
with First Boston Corp. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Byron Allumbaugh, Ralphs chairman and chief executive, called the company "a 
highly leveraged, LBO-type situation that's working out extremely well." 
</P>
<P>
Ralphs officials noted that the results were helped somewhat by the 
Compton-based company's lack of new store openings and remodeling projects in 
the quarter. The chain expects to open 39 stores later this year and in 1991 
and will step up its remodeling program. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the company's net income continued to be pushed down by 
interest expenses on the $400 million in junk bonds Ralphs issued when it was 
spun off as an independent subsidiary of Campeau Corp. in August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Ralphs' profit also was hurt by two other factors: acceleration of a writeoff 
related to the 1988 spinoff and a charge for future executive compensation tied 
to the company's market value. Allumbaugh said some of the increased accounting 
charges now will produce higher profit in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
Along with being pleased by Ralphs' recent performance, Wall Street appears to 
have grown more confident that the company will not be hurt by the problems of 
Toronto-based Campeau. Ralphs' bonds closed at a bid price of 87.25 cents on 
the dollar Monday, up from around 70 in early March.

MAXWELL SEEKS TO BUY BIG U.S. NEWSPAPER

<P>
British media entrepreneur Robert Maxwell said Monday that he is involved in 
negotiations to buy a U.S. newspaper valued "in the hundreds of millions of 
dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell declined to identify the newspaper, but his comments prompted industry 
speculation that it might be Gannett's USA Today, Tribune Co.'s New York Daily 
News or the Chicago Sun-Times. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of each of those newspapers denied that they were negotiating with 
Maxwell. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell's comments were made to reporters at the annual meeting in New York of 
Maxwell's Berlitz International and were confirmed later by a spokesman for 
Maxwell Communications, the investor's London-based holding company. The 
spokesman declined to elaborate on the remarks, and said Maxwell had left the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily News has one of the United States' largest circulations, but in 
recent years it has struggled to restore profitability and maintain circulation 
in a market with three other dailies. The paper is conducting difficult labor 
contract negotiations with its unions. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said it might make sense for Maxwell to try to purchase USA 
Today, since it would mesh well with his efforts to print and distribute his 
month-old "pan-European" English-language paper, The European, in this country. 
Maxwell has already been in negotiations with USA Today officials about 
printing the paper for U.S. distribution. 
</P>
<P>
Other industry officials conjectured that Maxwell might be talking to the 
Chicago Sun-Times, which has seen daily circulation slide more than 100,000 
papers, to about 533,000, since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell, who publishes Britain's Daily Mirror, recently bought three U.S. 
supermarket tabloids, the Globe, National Examiner and the Sun, for an 
estimated $100 million.

LABOR: SCRIMMAGE ON NFL FREE AGENCY

<TEXT>
<P>
It may be hard for some to understand how such angry arguments can arise 
between 1,500 rich, young professional football players and a few dozen richer, 
older club owners -- six of whom are billionaires -- when the clubs' revenue 
from television alone will soar 85% this year. 
</P>
<P>
It would seem they would be laughing all the way to the bank, or wherever they 
stash their money, since their TV income will be a record $3.6 billion over the 
next four years. 
</P>
<P>
Their arguments may seem to be energy misspent, but they are not unusual. Other 
wealthy people fight over money too. 
</P>
<P>
It is harder, though, to understand the ludicrous way that players and owners 
have reversed roles as they battle in and out of the courts. 
</P>
<P>
A look at the topsy-turvy world of professional football shows how this mess 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
It is quite a twist for the National Football League to be pressing hard for a 
court order to make the NFL Players Assn. admit that it is a real union and 
that it acts like one by demanding that the owners pay players more money. 
</P>
<P>
The other day, Jack Donlan, chief negotiator for the owners, tried in vain to 
tempt the players with this extraordinary observation: 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it. We (management) have a lot of money. We have had a lot of 
committee meetings to discuss how far we can go. A ballpark figure is, we could 
double the benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Equally unprecedented in the world of labor-management relations is the odd 
posture of the players association. Although the association never before 
objected to being called a union, it is now fighting in court to prove that it 
is not legally a union and therefore cannot be forced to demand anything from 
the owners. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Upshaw, head of the players association, wasn't kidding a while back when 
he left a luncheon with this startling remark: "Well, I've got a union to 
break." He was referring to his own. 
</P>
<P>
The strange behavior by both sides stems from the impact of federal antitrust 
laws on the real issue in dispute: the seemingly perpetual argument over the 
free-agency question. 
</P>
<P>
The players want to be free agents, which means that they want to be allowed to 
sell their talents to the highest bidder in the league. That isn't asking too 
much in our free market system. They also want a union to negotiate their 
minimum salaries and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 20 years, the association and management fought constantly. 
Contract negotiations ended in strikes or lockouts five times without resolving 
the free-agency issue. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current system, the owners have agreed to let each team "protect" 37 
players -- generally their best ones -- from free-agency status. The remaining 
players have limited freedom to put their talents up for competitive bidding. 
The "protected" players remain captives of their team unless the owner chooses 
to trade or release them. 
</P>
<P>
The owners still act as though they own the players, who, after some strikes, 
won only limited freedom to put their services up for competitive bidding among 
the 28 teams. To resolve the dispute without more picket lines, the association 
went to court asking that its members be allowed to sue the owners under 
federal antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
The association contends that the owners are violating antitrust laws by 
conspiring among themselves to refuse to bid against one another for the 
talents of individual players, except when the owners agree that they are ready 
to bid. That amounts to an illegal attempt by the owners to fix wages, the 
association argues. 
</P>
<P>
In the early part of this century, workers and their unions were dragged to 
court when they collectively demanded pay raises. They were accused of 
violating antitrust laws by "conspiring" among themselves to try to fix their 
wages. 
</P>
<P>
But in the 1930s under new antitrust laws, the Supreme Court decided that 
workers have a right to try to "fix" their wages -- if they do it collectively 
through a union. 
</P>
<P>
Now NFL owners say players cannot sue under antitrust laws to become free 
agents because the law says players and owners are exempt from those laws as 
long as they have a collective bargaining relationship. In other words, the 
owners are trying to restrain players' salaries by using the law that was 
developed to protect workers' rights to raise their wages. 
</P>
<P>
To defeat the owners' slick legal trick, the union tried one of its own. It 
declared that it is not a union and no longer has any collective bargaining 
relationship with the owners. Since it has no union contract, the association 
says, players can sue the owners, who refuse to bid competitively for the 
players' services. 
</P>
<P>
There are three cases before the courts, including one before the Supreme 
Court, that might untangle the legal mix-up that many people see as a rich 
men's squabble in which both sides are at fault. But it is a mistake to 
denounce both sides equally in their strange labor war. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, while the players are paid well -- the average annual salary is 
$301,000 -- so are other popular entertainers whose careers can go on for 
years. The average professional life of the players is 3.2 years, and they are 
frequently injured. 
</P>
<P>
The owners' careers, by contrast, are measured in decades, and the physical 
risk is mainly to their nervous systems as they fret over money. 
</P>
<P>
The owners don't fret, though, about competition from rival football leagues. 
There is none in what has been accurately called their corporate socialist 
monopoly: The 28 teams in the country's only league divide 95% of all their 
income equally. 
</P>
<P>
The players, while handsomely rewarded as entertainers, are in competition with 
one another for their handsome salaries. 
</P>
<P>
The good news for the fans in all this is that the squabbling over money is now 
in the courts, not on picket lines, and training camps will open next month in 
time to begin the regular football season.

ROUT BY PORTLAND SHOOK UP DETROIT; 
</P>
<P>
NBA FINALS: A 102-82 LOSS TO THE TRAIL BLAZERS NOV. 26 BROUGHT A LINEUP CHANGE. 
</P>

<P>
The defending champion Detroit Pistons begin the NBA's final round of the 
playoffs tonight against the Portland Trail Blazers, the team that blew them 
out as few others have done this season, triggering a lineup change. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons were 7-4 heading into their game at Portland Nov. 26 and had 
already lost to Miami and Atlanta, two non-playoff teams to be. The Trail 
Blazers throttled Detroit, 102-82. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a pretty good idea to do something after you get clobbered like 
that," Coach Chuck Daly said. "We had long conversations after that game, well 
into the night -- players, coaches -- and the decision was then made." 
</P>
<P>
John Salley, who had replaced the departed Rick Mahorn at forward, was benched 
in favor of James Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
The new lineup needed some time to get its act together and the Pistons' record 
was 13-10 in mid-December, but they took off soon enough. A 13-3 January was 
followed by 10-0 February and 11-4 March, and Detroit had the foundation that 
carried it back to the finals for the third consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons had to win Game 7 of the Eastern Conference championship series 
Sunday against Chicago to do it, but the last step to becoming the third 
franchise to win consecutive titles -- the others were Boston and 
Minneapolis-Los Angeles -- begins tonight at the Palace of Auburn Hills. The 
Trail Blazers have been waiting since last Thursday, having dispatched the 
Phoenix Suns in six games. 
</P>
<P>
These teams are both guard-oriented on offense: Portland with Clyde Drexler and 
Terry Porter, Detroit with Joe Dumars, Isiah Thomas and Vinnie Johnson. They 
are both balanced teams, each with four players who averaged at least 16 points 
during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
And in Portland, the Pistons might have met their match inside. Almost to a 
man, that's what worries Detroit most about the Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
"Rebounding is their strength," said Thomas, the Piston captain. "Sometimes I 
think they intentionally miss so they can get closer to the basket for shots." 
</P>
<P>
Or as Brendan Malone, a Detroit assistant coach, put it: "They're the best 
offensive rebounding team in the league." 
</P>
<P>
Buck Williams gets much of the credit. While in NBA purgatory -- he played for 
the New Jersey Nets for eight seasons -- Williams was often rumored to be 
Detroit-bound. Sent to Portland instead in a trade that turned the Trail 
Blazers into contenders, he is suddenly the Piston expert among teammates, most 
of whom saw the Bad Boys only twice a season while playing in the Western 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
He knows the similarities of the teams and the subtle tricks Detroit may use 
against a franchise making its first appearance in the finals since 1977 -- 
such as trying to get the Trail Blazers overconfident because of their 
statistical edge in rebounding and scoring. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just trying to get me up for the games," Williams said Monday at the 
Palace, where Portland practiced. "(Bill) Laimbeer and Isiah, they should be 
psychologists." 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons needed rest more than a workout. Dennis Rodman is bothered by a 
sprained left ankle, and Joe Dumars suffered a groin injury Sunday against the 
Bulls. Monday, Dumars said the inside of his thigh was sore and prevented him 
from making hard cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Although Rodman is the NBA's defensive player of the year, Dumars' condition is 
of particular concern because he will guard Drexler, the Blazers' leading 
scorer. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Michael Jordan, Dumars' assignment in the last series, Drexler relies 
almost solely on charges to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons will always have experience to fall back on against Portland. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not hiding the fact that we've never been here," Drexler said. "But it's 
still a game of basketball. If we stick to our plan, we'll be OK."

MARTINEZ STRIKES OUT 18, TIES KOUFAX; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: YOUNGEST DODGER GIVES UP ONLY THREE HITS IN 6-0 VICTORY OVER ATLANTA. 
HE LEADS MAJOR LEAGUES WITH 87 STRIKEOUTS. 
</P>

Like punch-drunk boxers, the Atlanta Brave hitters swung. And missed. And 
swung. And missed. 
</P>
<P>
They could barely lay a bat on Ramon Martinez, who struck out a Dodger 
record-tying 18 Monday in a 6-0 victory that even had the sound of greatness. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a couple of pitches where he let it go and boof! the ball was in 
the catcher's glove," third baseman Mike Sharperson said. "I never saw it." 
</P>
<P>
Throwing as fast as 96 m.p.h., Martinez, the youngest Dodger at 22, tied a club 
record set twice by Sandy Koufax, most recently on April 24, 1962. Martinez 
fell one short of the National League record of 19, shared by Steve Carlton for 
the St. Louis Cardinals in 1969 and Tom Seaver for the New York Mets in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston Red Sox' Roger Clemens holds the major league record for strikeouts 
in a nine-inning game with 20 against the Seattle Mariners in 1986. But at 
least one expert thought this was more impressive. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he threw harder than Clemens," said Atlanta third baseman Jim Presley, 
who played for the Seattle team that Clemens embarrassed. "This guy was on all 
night. The only pitch he missed with was a slider, and we still swung and 
missed at those." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez reached 18 strikeouts in front of 22,098 at Dodger Stadium with two 
outs in the eighth. Then Greg Olson ended the eighth and what would be 
Martinez's best chance to reach 19 by bouncing a two-strike pitch to first 
base. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked at the scoreboard, I saw where he tied Koufax, and all I could tell 
myself was, great, here we go, I'm going to become the answer to a trivia 
question," Olson said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth, with Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda leading the team in dugout 
cheers, Martinez could not find one more strikeout pitch. It was the only 
inning in which he had no strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Pinch-hitter Tommy Gregg popped to second baseman Juan Samuel with one strike. 
Oddibe McDowell grounded to diving first baseman Mickey Hatcher on the first 
pitch. And two baserunners later, Presley ended the game with a one-strike 
grounder to shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
One of those baserunners, Ron Gant, was Martinez's final chance to break the 
record, as he fell behind 1-and-2. But Gant survived to a full count and then 
singled up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
"I was throwing as hard as I was in the beginning, I was doing everything I 
could do . . . he just hit it," Martinez said of Gant. "I still got the 
complete game and the shutout and we won. And I am with a superstar like Sandy 
Koufax. I feel honored." 
</P>
<P>
Said catcher Mike Scioscia: "I was trying to get him one more. We just couldn't 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia downplayed his role in the record, saying, "Ramon could have thrown 
against a brick wall tonight." 
</P>
<P>
After the game, going against his tradition of throwing the baseball in the 
stands after complete games, Martinez tucked the ball in his glove. 
</P>
<P>
"I save this ball," Martinez said, describing his 123-pitch, 83-strike effort. 
"Tonight in the bullpen before the game, I feel it. I have everything. 
Fastball, changeup, everything. I feel relaxed and I just go throw. That's all 
I do is throw." 
</P>
<P>
Of Martinez's 18 strikeouts, 12 were swinging and six were called by home plate 
umpire Dutch Rennert. Only one of those called victims, Presley in the fourth 
inning, dared complain. Martinez walked only one, Jeff Treadway in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez struck out the side twice. He had five consecutive strikeouts twice. 
His first six outs were strikeouts. He struck out McDowell, Presley, Dave 
Justice and Jeff Blauser three times each. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody that went up (to the plate) took a right turn," said Russ Nixon, the 
Braves' manager. "He made us look absolutely awful." 
</P>
<P>
And made his Dodger teammates look twice. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that impressed me was his location," said Samuel, who hit a two-run 
homer and a single. "Mike Scioscia would put the glove outside, and that is 
where he would put the ball. He was painting it. He was not missing." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez's previous career high was 12 strikeouts, against Atlanta Sept. 15. On 
Monday he had 12 strikeouts by 9 p.m., departing the field with that total 
after the fifth inning, accompanied by the first of many standing ovations. 
</P>
<P>
He now leads the major leagues with 87 strikeouts in 69 innings. He is 6-3 with 
a 3.17 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"Early in the game, the Braves' third base coach, Roy Majtyka, told the umpire 
(Jim Quick), 'Well, I guess there won't be much action over here tonight," 
Sharperson said. "Martinez was that impressive." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers scored three runs each in the fourth and sixth innings. Their runs 
in the fourth were their first off Tom Glavine since Sept. 12, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Hubie Brooks started the inning with a single over second base, then Mickey 
Hatcher fought off a 1-and-2 pitch for a double to right field. Scioscia hit a 
grounder to score one run, and then Samuel hit an 0-and-2 pitch over the right 
field wall for his fourth homer. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez had an RBI ground single and Jose Gonzalez added a two-run single in 
the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
The setting was right for strikeouts. In four previous career appearances 
against the Braves, Martinez had thrown two shutouts and combined for another 
shutout, giving up only one run in 28 innings with 31 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Add the fact that three members of the Braves' starting lineup -- Olson, 
Presley and Justice -- had never faced him. The Braves' offense also ranked 
10th in the National League in hitting, and fifth in strikeouts with 295. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Fay Vincent, baseball commissioner, visited Dodger Stadium Monday during a West 
Coast tour. Vincent said one of baseball's problems is the lack of black fans. 
"The black community is not involved like it was some time ago, we have to do a 
better job at that," Vincent said. "Baseball was the first institution to 
desegregate without the force of law when Jackie Robinson joined the Dodgers in 
1947, but that was a long time ago. We are going to do work in the inner cities 
to get more fields, more coaching, that sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson took 10 minutes of batting practice Monday before deciding his left 
knee needed a rest after consecutive weekend starts, his first games in nearly 
a year. . . . Eddie Murray missed his fifth consecutive start Monday because of 
a strained left hamstring, but he said he is feeling better. . . . Mickey 
Hatcher was feeling better after suffering a twisted knee in an accident at his 
home. Hatcher said that he had made both of his weekend starts despite the sore 
knee. He had one hit in eight at-bats during that time. "It's feeling fine now, 
but I was worried for a while," said Hatcher, who suffered a torn hamstring 
last season while chasing vandals outside his house. "I thought, 'Oh, no, 
another weird injury.' " 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's free agent draft, which began Monday, brought back memories for 
Chris Gwynn, who was the Dodgers' top pick in the 1985 draft. Gwynn was the 
10th player chosen overall, but was not informed of his selection until 2 1/2 
hours after the start of the draft. "The Dodgers either didn't have my phone 
number, or had the wrong phone number," said Gwynn, a student at San Diego 
State at the time. "My college coach finally called me and told me." Gwynn said 
that because he was being bothered by so many scouts, he gave the Major League 
Scouting Bureau a wrong number. . . . Dodger batboy Thomas Lee, who has 
benefited from Tom Lasorda's pitching instructions, said he was drafted in the 
13th round by Kansas City. . . . The Dodgers' top picks the past two seasons, 
pitchers Bill Bene and Kiki Jones, are sidelined because of shoulder pain. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hamilton, who was supposed to sidelined as long as six weeks after 
shoulder surgery May 4, said that his shoulder has not regained strength as 
quickly as he had hoped. It could be another week before he starts throwing, 
and another two weeks after that before he is ready to play.

JIM MURRAY: HE'S NOT REALLY HOT TO TROT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The home run trot is a very personal, individual thing. 
</P>
<P>
Some people want to get it over with as quickly as possible. Others want to 
savor it. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose used to act as if he were ashamed of himself. He ran the fastest home 
runs in history. He streaked around the bases as if the sheriff were after him. 
It used to annoy teammate Frank Robinson, who hit 586 home runs in his career. 
</P>
<P>
"Kid," he advised, "you better leave those home runs to those of us who can act 
them out." 
</P>
<P>
Babe Ruth, who hit 714, could act them out. He chugged around the bases in 
these little mincing steps till he milked every last morsel of the crowd 
adulation. Babe was the Barrymore of the home run hitters. 
</P>
<P>
Kal Daniels of the Dodgers is also a pretty fair thespian of this method 
theater. Kal is a pretty fast baserunner. He can get down to first in under 
four seconds in a pinch. But his home runs are three-act plays with prologues 
and curtain calls. He gets around the bases just faster than a guy laying 
brick. 
</P>
<P>
The league expects it of Kal Daniels. They just catch up on a little sleep or 
light housekeeping or light reading when he goes into his home run -- well, 
trot is not exactly the word for his home runs -- crawl would be more like it. 
He could swim faster. 
</P>
<P>
But, when he dawdled around the bases against his old teammates, the Cincinnati 
Reds, the other night, after beating them with a 10th inning homer one night 
and belting an opposite-field homer the next, his former pals thought he was 
overdoing it just a trifle. In baseball, this is the cardinal sin. It's known 
as "showing us up" in dugout parlance. Baseball's sack dance. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds thought that, for a man of Kal Daniels' speed, to take 30 seconds to 
get around the bases was his form of thumbing his nose at them for trading him. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels is outraged at the very idea. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you have your coffee this morning?" he snapped at the interviewer who 
brought it up. "Those guys over there know how I run out my homers. I was over 
there for three years and I hit 52 of them. I run all my homers the same way -- 
slow. I like to enjoy them. How long does it take me? I don't know. I don't 
wear a watch on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Kal Daniels doesn't consider himself a home run hitter anyway -- even though he 
has hit 64 in only a little more than 400 big league games and 1,369 at-bats. 
This is a homer nearly every 21 times at bat, which is not Ruth's pace of a 
homer every 11.7 times at bat but compares favorably with Henry Aaron's or 
Willie Mays' mark of a homer every 16 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit the ball where it is pitched," Kal growls. "If it goes out of the lot, 
fine. My job is to get hits, produce runs. I don't try to hit home runs. I 
don't even have a home run swing. I have this short, compact swing. I'm a line 
drive hitter." 
</P>
<P>
There are those in the game who consider Daniels the best striker of the ball 
in the league. Joe Amalfitano, coach of the Dodgers, who played or coached with 
them both, considers Daniels the best since Billy Williams, whose near-perfect 
batting style put him in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"They both have a perfect understanding of the strike zone," Amalfitano says. 
"I don't think there's a hitter in the game as selective as Kal Daniels. He's 
selective but aggressive. He makes you pitch. Every at-bat is a war. I imagine 
the other Williams, Ted, was like this, too. He never gives in to the pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
His manager, Tommy Lasorda agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best-balanced hitter in the league," Lasorda says. "He's a very 
disciplined, very patient hitter. He's never fooled on a pitch. He never loses 
the pitch, pulls his head off it. He's the best pure hitter in the league." 
</P>
<P>
Does he study the pitchers? Kal Daniels is asked. He shakes his head. 
</P>
<P>
"No," he says. "Because what they throw to you is not what they're throwing to 
other guys." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels is what is known as a "good-pitch hitter." Lots of players in the 
league can hit mistakes. Daniels can hit mistakes, but he can also hit the 
pitches that the pitcher gets where he wants them. 
</P>
<P>
Which is curious, because Daniels has never played in an All-Star game -- not 
even the year he hit .334 with 26 home runs in Cincinnati. At Cincinnati, he 
was pretty much in the shadow of Eric Davis and Pete Rose. 
</P>
<P>
He's not playing in anyone's shadow on the Dodgers. He's their All-Star, to 
date, with his average of .312, 10 home runs and 31 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Kalvoski Daniels -- he got his first name from the nurse who helped his mother 
in delivery -- is the most dangerous hitter in the league when the wheels are 
on. But he has had arthroscopic surgery on his knees twice in three years, 
which is too bad because he was a baserunner who stole 43 bases in 122 games 
before his hinges began to give out. 
</P>
<P>
Kal Daniels is as painstaking as Jack Nicklaus over a putt. Some batters go to 
the plate like a kid going to the woodshed. Daniels goes up like a guy getting 
ready to sing Carmen. 
</P>
<P>
First, he steps in and keeps his back to the plate, while he carefully and 
meticulously scrapes himself a toehold in the box. He flexes the bat once or 
twice, adjusts his helmet and then, and only then, turns and locks himself in 
the cool, poised stance of a guy expecting a box of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
He scrutinizes the pitches as carefully as a jeweler with a loupe. When he sees 
a strike, he strikes. He doesn't like to be hurried. Particularly if he hits a 
home run. To Kal Daniels, home runs are like fine wines with gourmet meals. 
They shouldn't be gulped. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels' home runs should have intermissions in them. But Kal feels the 
pitcher's position should be clear. If they can't stand the time, don't commit 
the crime. If they can't stand the trots, don't throw the home runs.

NEWSWIRE: ABC HIRES FORMER N.C. STATE COACH VALVANO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Valvano, forced out after last season as North Carolina State's basketball 
coach, has agreed to a three-year deal with ABC for a reported $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano agreed to a buyout of his coaching contract April 7 after allegations 
were made by ABC News that N.C. State players were involved in fixed games. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano also was criticized about a lack of academic progress by players in the 
program, which was put on probation for violations involving sales of 
complimentary tickets and athletic gear. He agreed to have his lifetime 
contract bought out for $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano will be teamed on basketball telecasts with Brent Musburger, who 
recently signed with the network after being fired by CBS. Keith Jackson and 
Dick Vitale will be the other ABC team. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano will also appear on ESPN, which is owned by ABC-Capital Cities.

THREAT OF FAN VIOLENCE DOESN'T SPOIL JOY AT SOCCER SITES 
</P>

CAGLIARI, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is nearly time to play international soccer in this breeze-swept island 
capital dressed festively for its World Cup debut. There are new roads, a 
remodeled stadium, and excited townsfolk framed by violet sprays of jacaranda 
and spills of bougainvillea in brilliant red and orange. 
</P>
<P>
There are two large cops on every downtown corner. Riot wagons, command 
helicopters and shock troops dressed like Darth Vader wait in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
For the rest of Italy, there's the thrill of playing host to the 1990 World 
Cup. For the Italian islands of Sardinia and Sicily, there's the trauma of 
welcoming foreign fans for whom drink and violence are also sport. On Monday, a 
Sardinian magistrate sentenced three young British fans who got drunk and 
vandalized a hotel room during the weekend to 20 days in an 18th-Century jail 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Sardinia has the worst of it: Among well-behaved English fans, a visit from 
louts called hooligans whose vandalism at home and abroad have made British 
soccer teams international pariahs. England, the seeded team in the Cup's Group 
F, is alone on Sardinia. The other teams in the group, Holland -- no treat, 
thanks to some young Dutch fans -- Ireland and Egypt will be headquartered in 
Sicily. 
</P>
<P>
For the British, Sardinia is a test. If there's trouble here, a ban against 
English play in international matches, lifted for the World Cup tournament, 
probably will be extended indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
For Sardinia, being one of the 12 Italian World Cup sites amounts to a coming 
of age for an island of agriculture and tourism that is one of Italy's poorer 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the hooligans will ruin Cagliari's party has become as much a topic of 
civic debate as the shortage of water on a Mediterranean island where three 
years of drought has brought rationing that leaves most homes with dry faucets 
for up to 16 hours a day. English players practicing here said an unexpected 
day of rain last week made Sardinia feel like home. Sardinians welcomed it as 
an unexpected gift, a good omen, perhaps, before the deluge. 
</P>
<P>
"There is apprehension," said Arturo Clavuot, editor of L'Unione Sarda, the 
major newspaper on this mountainous island of 1.7 million. "People realize that 
their city is besieged by police. They are surprised, but also comforted: The 
cocktail of English, Dutch and Irish is an explosive one. Something will happen 
-- but it won't get out of control." 
</P>
<P>
Stefano Aricca, president of the Sardinian branch of Italia 90, the organizing 
group, takes a more sanguine view. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many police of all sorts already, and more are coming. There's no 
reason to panic. We are a proud and hospitable people. We can take care of 
ourselves if necessary," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Aricca thinks the Dutch hooligans bear the most watching. 
</P>
<P>
Opposite logic prevails in Sicily. Poor Sardinia with all those English louts, 
say Italia 90 officials in Palermo, where about 10,000 Dutch fans will 
concentrate except on June 16 when Holland plays England here. 
</P>
<P>
The Sicilians expect about 5,000 Irish and about 950 Egyptians will arrive 
aboard the Achille Lauro, a cruise ship seized by terrorists who killed an 
American tourist in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"The police have been increased, and they are ready," said Giuseppe Barbera, 
Italia 90 president for Sicily. "Authorities have taken exceptional measures. 
We don't expect bad trouble, but we are ready if it comes. There is great 
excitement here, particularly at having the powerful Dutch team. We think the 
Cup will help the world understand that there's more to Sicily than Mafiosi." 
</P>
<P>
Palermo's La Favorita stadium, reopening for Cup play after a two-year face 
lift that claimed the lives of five workmen, is proclaimed "a jewel," one of 
the world's best modern stadiums. La Favorita and Palermo figure to get their 
liveliest workout at the Holland-Ireland game June 21. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Sardinia, the apocalypse, if it comes, will be June 16 -- England vs. 
Holland. Everyone will be here for the encounter between two potential 
finalists. 
</P>
<P>
Joao Havelenge, president of the international soccer federation, expects no 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"I am certain that young people who come to the World Cup will arrive with the 
right attitude," he said. "You wouldn't expect a guest you invited into your 
home to smash the place up. We have to make sure we don't treat the finals as 
if it were a battle campaign." 
</P>
<P>
British police last week said that intelligence reports indicated a planned 
confrontation between English and Dutch louts, but Italy's reinforced and 
soccer-wise carabinieri promise that any trouble will be quickly snuffed. 
</P>
<P>
Italian police have been working closely with British and Dutch anti-hooligan 
experts for months, hoping to head off the worst troublemakers long before they 
get to the stadiums. The sale of alcohol on game days has already been banned 
in Sicily, and there is strong pressure for Sardinia to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
For England's appearance, security concerns have been paramount from the 
outset. It was seeded and sent to Sardinia expressly because an island is 
harder and more expensive for lager louts to reach. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Pappalardo, the Italia 90 secretary for Sardinia, expects about 9,000 
fans, of whom perhaps 10% will merit police attention. About 6,000 Dutch and 
Irish fans are expected for their games in Sardinia, and 7,000 or more 
Egyptians, Pappalardo said. 
</P>
<P>
Known troublemakers will find it hard to board planes or ferries to Sardinia 
from the Italian mainland. The British have coached Italian police in 
everything from crowd control to understanding abuse in gutter English, and the 
two forces say they will shadow the worst of hooligans every step of the way. 
</P>
<P>
An awesome security net surrounds the teams and stadiums all over the country. 
England's team is staying at a spectacular but isolated golf club 20 miles from 
Cagliari in the Sardinian countryside. 
</P>
<P>
For this World Cup, there will be a seat in every stadium for every ticket, 
which is unique in Europe. In England, and in many European stadiums, end zone 
fans are packed into areas without seats. A classic tactic of ticketless 
hooligans is to force the gate at the last minute. Italian police promise that 
won't happen here. 
</P>
<P>
Game-bound fans will pass a series of security checks and body searches 
beginning hundreds of yards away. Nothing that could become a weapon -- flag 
poles to soft drink cans -- will make it into the stadium, police say. Only 
non-alcoholic drinks will be sold inside, and they will come in high-tech 
plastic containers with special tops that are designed to fly off if thrown. 
</P>
<P>
In each stadium, remote-controlled television cameras will scan the crowd. They 
will be able to zoom in on any seat in the stadium, and a computer will print 
an instant portrait of trouble in the making. 
</P>
<P>
Confident Italia 90 officials predict that if trouble does come, it will be 
outside the stadiums, rather than inside, where the world will be watching. 
Aricca optimistically expects a television audience of three billion for the 
match between England and Holland. 
</P>
<P>
Fans from opposing teams will be kept apart on their way to the stadiums, while 
they are inside and after they leave, Italian officials say. For Cagliari, a 
seaside town of 350,000 normally policed by a few hundred officers, 3,000 more 
have been flown in, according to Mayor Paolo De Magistris. 
</P>
<P>
"We worry about losers and winners coming to blows outside the stadium, and we 
worry about local youths who might like to join in," De Magistris said. "But 
the Cup has meant great development for Cagliari, public works like roads, 
parking, the stadium and airport improvements that will remain after everybody 
has gone home." 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that the Cup makes Cagliari a winner even if sirens howl. 
</P>
<P>
And amid the anticipation and trepidation, Cagliari's mayor is, hands down, the 
most laconic of Italy's World Cup organizers. He is a slight, white-haired 
aristocrat whose idea of a good time is reading history -- currently a study of 
6th Century Byzantium -- while muscles flex all around him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased that my fellow citizens who are sports enthusiasts have this 
chance they have never had before," he said. "But I have never been to a soccer 
game, and I won't be going this time, either."

<TEXT>
<P>
In Argentina, soccer fans -- everyone in the country old enough to kick a ball 
-- nervously await the latest news about the injured big toe on the right foot 
of star midfielder Diego Maradona. 
</P>
<P>
In Scotland, fans are updated daily in the newspapers, and hourly on television 
and radio, about striker Mo Johnston's "mystery ailment," believed to be a torn 
abdominal muscle. "Johnston Leaves Scots Quaking," reads a headline in the 
Guardian. 
</P>
<P>
The London press reports that the English team is in chaos, having been saved 
from a humiliating loss in an exhibition game against Tunisia by a last-minute 
goal. A Brazilian newspaper's poll of the country's leading doctors determines 
that one of the team's key players, Romario, is unfit to play. 
</P>
<P>
Spain's coach, Luis Suarez, tells that country's sports daily, Marca, that no 
one will commit suicide if his team does not win the World Cup. Marca is not so 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
Four days before Friday's opening game in Milan between defending champion 
Argentina and Cameroon, much of the world's population is experiencing severe 
lightheadedness believed to be connected with World Cup fever. 
</P>
<P>
The United States appears to have immunity, acquired through years of 
indifference to the world's most popular championship. 
</P>
<P>
North American sporting events need not apply for the designation, as Norwegian 
marathon runner Grete Waitz once so eloquently pointed out in a discussion of 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"The World Series?" she said. "How many countries are playing?" 
</P>
<P>
So, as the United States, making its first World Cup appearance in 40 years, 
opened its training camp Monday in this seaside resort about 10 miles from 
Pisa, all was appropriately calm. 
</P>
<P>
No one was quaking. No one was even injured. Even if someone had been, it is 
doubtful the United States' leading doctors would have offered opinions about 
whether he was or was not fit to play in Sunday's opener against Czechoslovakia 
in Florence. 
</P>
<P>
Not knowing what to expect, the U.S. Soccer Federation arranged to have 
security guards at the training camp, drawn from Italy's police and military as 
well as the U.S. Army base at nearby Camp Darby. They had a quiet day Monday, 
when the only visitors were about 20 reporters who showed up for a morning 
practice. The afternoon practice was closed to the press. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Coach Bob Gansler patiently answered all questions, but he appeared to 
most enjoy the ones from an Italian journalist. Ever since the Italians 
announced that their players could not have sex during the month of the World 
Cup, officials from each of the 24 teams have been asked by reporters if they 
have a similar policy. 
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians can have sex, but not the Irish. The Austrians announced that 
their team cannot have sex the night before games. 
</P>
<P>
And the U.S. players? 
</P>
<P>
"Not at halftime," Gansler said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Wives and girlfriends are not welcome at the camp, in the Italian Olympic 
training center, but Gansler said he could not prevent the players from 
visiting them in Florence. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the moments of pleasure that concern me," he said. "It's the hours of 
pursuit." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Italian journalist tried to bait Gansler into criticizing the 
Italian approach. 
</P>
<P>
"Sex is very important to Latin peoples," the journalist said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sex is very important to Americans, too," Gansler said. "That's why there are 
250 million of us." 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the only issue involved Eric Wynalda's suitability to play midfield. 
He is a forward by experience and nature, but last month Gansler moved him to 
the midfield so that the team can have another scorer in the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Wynalda, who is from Westlake Village, says that he is not comfortable in the 
midfield, but he said Monday that he is more comfortable there than on the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
That is where he spent the last 40 minutes of Saturday's 2-1 loss to 
Switzerland in an exhibition game. Afterward, Wynalda let off steam, 
complaining that he was not suited for the position's defensive 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a lot of time to cool off," he said Monday. "I was a little 
disappointed with the loss. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the position goes, I think I can handle it. I don't think there's 
any reason to pull me off the field. I'd like to be up front (at forward), 
though. That would be nice." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he felt Gansler might move him out of the starting line-up, Wynalda 
said, "Anything's possible." 
</P>
<P>
But Gansler did not seem to be leaning that way. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric has played that position before, but it's a learning experience for him 
to play it at this level," he said. "He's got to have some patience. He's 
certainly more frustrated with his play there than I am." 
</P>
<P>
If Wynalda does not contribute, the man to replace him in the midfield might be 
UCLA freshman Chris Henderson, 19, who learned Monday that he is the youngest 
player in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, some day I can be the oldest," he said.

SURGEONS IMPLANT METAL ROD TO AID MCCARRON'S THIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Jockey Chris McCarron, who suffered broken legs and a broken arm in a spill 
Sunday at Hollywood Park, underwent three hours of surgery Monday night and 
will be sidelined an estimated four to five months. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Doug Garland, the surgeon who operated on McCarron after he was involved in 
another major spill in 1986 at Santa Anita, led a team of surgeons who 
performed the operation on the 35-year-old jockey Monday at Centinela Hospital 
Medical Center in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
A pin was placed in McCarron's broken right forearm and a rod was inserted in 
his broken left thighbone. McCarron also suffered a broken bone in his lower 
right leg, an injury that apparently won't require surgery. 
</P>
<P>
McCarron will remain in the hospital until the end of the week and then begin 
therapy at home. Because of the broken arm, he will be given a special set of 
crutches that will help his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Although McCarron sustained more injuries in this spill, the damage is not 
believed to be as serious as the accident that resulted in a shattered left 
thighbone 3 1/2 years ago. That injury was high on the thighbone, near the hip, 
and consisted of four breaks that required separate mendings. 
</P>
<P>
McCarron returned to action in March of 1987, five months after the spill, and 
in May of that year he won the Kentucky Derby with Alysheba. The breaks in the 
thighbone were fused with an eight-ounce metal plate, which was removed later. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, in the fourth race, McCarron's mount fell when the horse in front of 
him, ridden by Kent Desormeaux, broke a leg and went down. A trailing horse ran 
over McCarron. Desormeaux's horse was destroyed, and he suffered a cracked rib 
and contusions. 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux was released from the hospital Monday and is expected to resume 
riding as soon as the soreness subsides. 
</P>
<P>
"Chris' spirits are good," Scott McClellan, his agent, said Monday night. "The 
main thing is that he'll be back riding, and that's the name of the game. He's 
a tough guy. He went from 10 at night until 1 the next afternoon without 
needing medication, which shows what kind of a guy he is." 
</P>
<P>
McCarron has ridden more than 5,200 winners and his horses have earned almost 
$124 million. This year he was running second to Gary Stevens on the national 
money list with purses just under $5 million. Last year, McCarron was inducted 
into the racing Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in the first year that 
he was eligible. 
</P>
<P>
McCarron's latest spill came about three hours before he was scheduled to ride 
Sunday Silence, last year's horse of the year, in his 1990 debut. Sunday 
Silence, with McCarron riding him for the first time, clinched the national 
title last November with a victory over Easy Goer in the Breeders' Cup Classic 
at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Valenzuela, who had been Sunday Silence's regular rider -- including a 
victory in the 1989 Kentucky Derby -- before drug problems resulted in McCarron 
getting the mount, took over for McCarron Sunday and rode the 4-year-old colt 
to a three-quarter-length victory in the $300,000 Californian.

'RECALL' TOTALLY OUTDISTANCES 'FUTURE' IN BOX-OFFICE RACE; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: SCHWARZENEGGER'S SCI-FI FLICK OPENS WITH $25.5 MILLION. BUT IT ONLY 
JUST EDGES THE 'TURTLES' ' $25.3-MILLION RECORD. 
</P>

Michael J. Fox was no match for muscleman Arnold Schwarzenegger at the weekend 
box office. With ticket sales of $25.5 million, Tri-Star Pictures' "Total 
Recall" -- which sends Schwarzenegger to Mars -- sent the box office into 
hyperspace for the year's biggest three-day opening. 
</P>
<P>
"Total Recall" edged out the previous record-holder, New Line Cinema's "Teenage 
Mutant Ninja Turtles," by a hair: the "Turtles" opened with $25.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
With its startling victory, the R-rated "Total Recall" -- which opened to mixed 
reviews -- got the summer movie sweepstakes war off to a formidable start and 
marked Schwarzenegger's successful re-entry to the action-adventure genre 
following a string of titles which misfired at the box office. (Among them: 
"Red Heat" (1988), which earned $29 million; "Predator" (1987), $25 million; 
"The Running Man" (1987), $27 million.) 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Universal Pictures' "Back to the Future III," starring Fox as 
time-traveling teen Marty McFly, continued in the tradition of "Future II," 
which had a strong opening (last November) and then spiraled downward. 
</P>
<P>
The second-place ranked "Future III" had ticket sales of $10.3 million, 
following its splashy Memorial Day holiday weekend debut, in which it earned 
$23.7 million over four days. This represents a tumble of more than 50%, which 
doesn't bode well for the box office future of "Future III." 
</P>
<P>
Continuing on its successful flight, Universal's "Bird on a Wire," was ranked 
third, with ticket sales of $6.3 million. The action-comedy starring Mel Gibson 
and Goldie Hawn, has now flown off with more than $42 million. 
</P>
<P>
With ticket sales of $4.7 million, Touchstone Pictures' "Pretty Woman" came in 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Orion Pictures' Robin Williams' comedy, "Cadillac Man," came in a sputtering 
fifth, with ticket sales of $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Touchstone's "Fire Birds," about Apache attack helicopters fighting the war on 
drugs, also sputtered to sixth place, with earnings of $2.6 million in its 
second week, after opening to $6.3 million its first weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Schwarzenegger film's entry also marks a victorious end to a decade-long 
Hollywood quest to bring Phillip K. Dick's short story, "I Can Remember It for 
You Wholesale" -- about a man with a memory implant -- to the screen. After 
several false starts -- and stops -- Carolco Pictures finally succeeded in 
teaming Schwarzenegger with "RoboCop" director Paul Verhoeven. 
</P>
<P>
Set on both Earth and Mars in the year 2084, the science fiction epic 
reportedly required a budget of nearly $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
Now it must face tough opposition in the coming weeks, warring against Eddie 
Murphy-Nick Nolte re-teaming in "Another 48 HRS." (opening Friday), Warren 
Beatty's long-awaited "Dick Tracy" (June 15), "Gremlins II: The New Batch" 
(also June 15) and Tom Cruise's race car movie, "Days of Thunder" (June 27).

DAT SOUND SYSTEMS ON WAY TO U.S. MARKET; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: AFTER A THREE-YEAR WAIT, THE RIVAL TO CD-QUALITY SOUND WILL ARRIVE 
THIS MONTH -- AT PRICES FROM $900 TO $1,700.

<P>
The biggest news to come out of the Consumer Electronics Show now in progress 
here is that digital audio tape decks -- a cassette system said to rival 
compact discs in sound quality -- will finally be available on the American 
market by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
But they're not cheap. The decks will be priced in the $900 to $1,700 range. 
</P>
<P>
Several companies, including JVC, Technics and Denon, will be shipping units by 
fall, but Sony announced Sunday that it plans to be the first to market, 
delivering tape decks to retailers by the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
Sony's announcement generated the most interest because its decks not only will 
be marketed first but also at the lowest cost: the DTC75ES at $950 and the 
DTC-700 at $900. Discount stores may sell the latter unit for under $800. 
</P>
<P>
Digital audio tape, or DAT, has been promised to American consumers for the 
past three years. It's an audio-cassette system that uses a mini-tape to 
generate CD-quality sound. Some industry observers have predicted that, just as 
the CD has made the album obsolete, DAT will ultimately wipe out the standard 
audio cassette, now the most popular format among music listeners. 
</P>
<P>
What's kept DAT off the American market is fear that it would lead to extensive 
consumer copying of CDs, which in turn would cheat artists out of royalties, 
cut down on CD sales and ruin the standard audio-cassette market. But last 
August a compromise to limit DAT copying was reached that satisfied both the 
Electronic Industries Assn. and the Recording Industry Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
The DAT decks will be equipped with copy-limiting circuitry developed by 
Phillips that will enable consumers to make unlimited copies of CDs on DAT 
tapes, but none of those tapes can be used to make other copies. So a DAT tape 
must be purchased for each copy. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, most DAT owners will be limited to making copies of CDs because 
there's very little prerecorded DAT software on the market. Sony will market a 
classical line of prerecorded DAT tapes, offering 10 titles at $19.95 each. 
</P>
<P>
Blank DAT tapes won't be cheap either. Available in 60-, 90- and 120-minute 
sizes, Sony, for instance, will market them in the $12-$18 range, while Fuji 
will offer a less-expensive line, $11-$13. 
</P>
<P>
Sony owns CBS Records but, according to a Sony spokesman, there's no indication 
that Sony will force the label to rush into the prerecorded DAT market. 
</P>
<P>
Of the technological advances announced at the show, one, by Hitachi, may have 
far-reaching effects. In the fall, the company will market a full line of VCRs 
-- both expensive and inexpensive -- featuring a built-in automatic 
head-cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
Dirty video heads, as most VCR owners know, cause all sorts of visual and audio 
distortions. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at the company's exhibit, which included a see-through machine 
showing the cleaner in action, said that this feature will be added without a 
price increase. 
</P>
<P>
The cleaner is a drum-shaped mechanism that gently brushes the video heads each 
time a tape is loaded or unloaded. The system doesn't require maintenance. Its 
non-abrasive, assuring longer life for the video heads, and expels the debris. 
</P>
<P>
If this system is successful, other VCR makers will undoubtely adopt it, which 
will ultimately cut down on VCR maintenance and maintain a high level of 
picture-quality.

HITTING THE JACKPOT;

BROADWAY: THE SCREENPLAYS FOR 'PRELUDE TO A KISS' AND 'A BRONX TALE' HAVE SOLD 
FOR MEGA-DOLLARS. BUT THE PLAYWRIGHTS ALSO RAISED EYEBROWS BY RETAINING 
CREATIVE CONTROL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Of the big money Hollywood has spent on screenplays in the last few months, the 
mega-dollars showered on stage plays -- and the creative control the 
playwrights have won -- have raised the most eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of Craig Lucas' "Prelude to a Kiss" to 20th Century Fox for $1 
million-plus, and the sale of the relatively unknown Chazz Palminteri's "A 
Bronx Tale" to Universal for $1.5 million, are stunners more for the terms they 
include than the price each has commanded. ("Prelude" received a Tony 
nomination, but the award for best play at Sunday's ceremonies went to "The 
Grapes of Wrath.") 
</P>
<P>
Both plays had their start in Hollywood's own back yard. Palminteri's one-man 
piece opened in March 1989 at the West Coast Ensemble's 75-seat theater on 
Hollywood Boulevard and later moved to the 200-seat Theatre West. "Prelude to a 
Kiss" first played in January 1988 at Costa Mesa's South Coast Repertory, which 
had commissioned the play for $12,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Prelude" and "Bronx Tale" did not go entirely unnoticed by the industry during 
their Southern California runs, but the circumstances were not ripe for a sale 
to films. "Prelude" was extensively rewritten after its debut at South Coast 
and went on to an interim production at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre in 1989 
before opening this year -- first Off Broadway then on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
"The show at South Coast was a first draft," Lucas said on the phone from New 
York. "It's been rewritten a great deal. The story line has been (strengthened) 
and it has many fewer characters. When we did the play at Berkeley Rep, it was 
already a lot stronger. And it's even stronger in New York." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not different but deeper," added Norman Rene, who has directed all 
productions of the play. "Its lyricism is more high-flown and the romantic core 
of the story clarified." 
</P>
<P>
Palminteri, on the other hand, was a cocky young newcomer who turned down 
million-dollar offers during his play's L.A. run, secure in his conviction that 
he could get more than money -- and he did. 
</P>
<P>
Is the stepped up interest in stage properties a fallout from the unexpected 
success of "Driving Miss Daisy," bought for a mere $375,000 and made by the 
Zanuck Company for $7.5 million, with grosses topping $100 million? 
</P>
<P>
William Morris agent Michael Peretzian, who handled the deal on "Prelude" with 
his New York-based associate Peter Franklin, allows only that the glowing 
reviews for the Off Broadway and Broadway productions, plus "Daisy's" high 
grosses, were factors that drove up "Prelude's" price. 
</P>
<P>
His partner Franklin also sees "Daisy's" success as "an influence, certainly," 
but believes the sale of "Prelude," described as an adult fairy tale, is merely 
"further evidence that Hollywood these days is looking for good stories and 
depth of character. The price is higher than usual, but romance is Hollywood's 
stock in trade. If you look back over the years, all of the best writing in 
Hollywood has been done by playwrights. What I see is a return to that kind of 
depth." 
</P>
<P>
The strength of the play and the support it received in New York won Lucas 
unusual control over the film. Although none of the participants would confirm 
it, a source close to the deal makers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, 
said that in addition to the basic $1 million for "Prelude," the deal's 
so-called "escalator clauses" included an additional $100,000 for Lucas if the 
play won the Pulitzer Prize (which it did not). Lucas did receive an additional 
$50,000 for the Tony nomination and would have been given another $50,000 had 
it won a Tony. The deal also provides $50,000 for each month that the play 
remains on Broadway (it opened May 1), with a ceiling of $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
According to Peretzian, there were seven serious bidders: independent producer 
Ed Pressman ("Talk Radio"), Columbia, 20th Century Fox, Quincy Jones (for 
Warner Bros.), Alan Pakula (for Touchstone) and the Sam Goldwyn Jr. company 
(which just released the Lucas/Rene film "Longtime Companion"). Steven 
Spielberg and Dawn Steel showed interest, Peretzian said, but came too late. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas' conditions were that Rene must direct the film, that no other producers 
could be brought on without his and Rene's approval and that he could not be 
rewritten. The amount that Rene will earn was also stipulated. No one is saying 
how much, but, quipped Rene, "It's more than I'm used to." 
</P>
<P>
Said Peretzian: "We told the (bidders) the criteria: First: Did they see the 
darker elements of the play and would they protect the integrity of the piece? 
Second: How much money did they offer? Whoever came in highest in both 
categories became our first choice. We would then talk to them exclusively. It 
stopped the craziness." 
</P>
<P>
Producers Michael Gruskoff and Michael Levy at 20th Century emerged the 
victors. They met with Lucas last June after reading the script. He gave them 
the green light to run with the play and approach some studios. "It worked 
mostly thanks to my partner's relationship with Lucas," Levy said, "and his 
feeling for the material. We were all in sync." 
</P>
<P>
Gruskoff and Levy agreed that Rene should direct. They knew Joe Roth, head of 
production at Fox, who is a fan of Alec Baldwin (he played one of the leads in 
"Prelude" during its Off Broadway run). Roth put in his oar after he too had 
read the script. 
</P>
<P>
"I was counseled that Fox would be a good way to go," Lucas said. "Roth was 
quite terrific. I don't mean to sound like a Pollyanna, but even the other 
Hollywood people we talked to seemed quite reasonable. Nobody tried to ram 
anything down our throats." 
</P>
<P>
A later conversation with Roth, "not hinged on who you cast, but on how you 
handle the property," Peretzian said, cinched it. 
</P>
<P>
"Peretzian told me it wasn't about offers," Roth concurred. "He said he could 
negotiate with anybody. So I called Rene and Lucas and told them how much I 
liked the script. I told them I was trying to make Fox a place where filmmakers 
felt comfortable and have their vision shared. I kept calling during the week 
they were deciding. I told them who to call on my behalf and assured them they 
would have this play faithfully reproduced." 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Rep won't get much out of this deal. "Our contract stipulates that 
if a commercial production opens within two years of ours, we should have a 
participation in the gross receipts," SCR artistic co-director David Emmes 
explained. "But it's been more than two years, and we don't believe the 
production on Broadway was caused by our production." Because it commissioned 
the play, however, the theater retains a five-to-seven-year participation in 
the author's subsidiary rights. 
</P>
<P>
Emmes wouldn't say how much South Coast stands to gain from the movie sale of 
"Prelude," but when asked if the $25,000 reported in a trade publication was 
correct, he answered, "I imagine it would be in that ballpark. Depending on how 
it goes, it could even be more -- probably somewhere between $20,000 and 
$40,000." 
</P>
<P>
Lucas is currently writing the screenplay, though he has no shooting date. "I 
don't feel pressure (to set one)," Roth explained. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no casting imperative, no competing projects. A story that good, as 
long as we faithfully execute it, people will come. Alec (Baldwin) would like 
to do it. We hope he will." 
</P>
<P>
"The planets were all lined up for this negotiation," Peretzian said, citing 
the coincidence of the good reviews, the quasi-simultaneous release of "The 
Hunt for Red October" (which features Baldwin, drawing ancillary attention to 
the play) and the "buying fever" that has gripped Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"What's wonderful," he added, "is that a play as intelligent as this one can 
find a film market. But fundamentally, good art sells." 
</P>
<P>
Palminteri's case is somewhat different and perhaps more remarkable. He blew in 
out of nowhere, with no "name" and no track record, developed "A Bronx Tale" in 
a Theatre West workshop, and took an unprecedented David-like stand against the 
Hollywood Goliath. 
</P>
<P>
He had written his one-man play based on childhood memories as a vehicle for 
himself, turning down lucrative offers for film rights to the piece from Robert 
De Niro and others during the consecutive Los Angeles runs of the show. He 
vowed to write his own screenplay and star in it. 
</P>
<P>
"We first saw the show at the West Coast Ensemble," said William Morris agent 
Fred Westheimer who, with Lee Cohen, offered to represent Palminteri. "Every 
agent and producer we knew was in that little theater. There was a buzz going 
on about Chazz and the play at that time. It involved a number of stars, 
including De Niro and (Al) Pacino, (directors) Rob Reiner, John Avildsen, Peter 
Weir, Jim Brooks," among others. 
</P>
<P>
Palminteri held on. In addition to money, he wanted a New York run of the show 
(for his family to see) and major creative control -- the kind he eventually 
got. Offers in the $1-million range came in before there was a film script. He 
started writing his screenplay in Los Angeles, finishing it on the day of his 
New York opening. 
</P>
<P>
There was a reading of it in De Niro's Tribeca studios. De Niro loved it. It 
also turned out to have Universal appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"Casey Silver, president of Universal, was the engine that drove this deal," 
Westheimer said. "He loved the play, wanted the property, wouldn't let it go. 
We didn't know if it would be best for Chazz to go studio or go independent. 
But Universal offered us the controls usually given by independent producers. 
We chose to go to Universal because they basically said they were interested on 
the same grounds that we were. The way Universal distributes markets and 
promotes their films was also key in our decision to be there. 
</P>
<P>
"With the support of Tom Pollock (chairman of Universal) the whole thing came 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"Chazz is locked in to play in it, locked in to write it, has mutual control 
over who directs it, who casts it -- things that usually only go to people with 
a lot of clout." 
</P>
<P>
"Chazz was very brave to hold on to (his play) and not give it away," Cohen 
said. "But good things sell," he said, echoing Peretzian. "This is a top flight 
deal -- a seven-figure deal," he offered, declining to say how high. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no trouble with that," Palminteri replied when asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It was $1.5 million." 
</P>
<P>
So when the movie is made (target date: Spring, 1991), Palminteri will have 
written the screenplay and will play Johnny, the gangster who befriended him as 
a kid. De Niro will make his directorial debut with the film and play the 
father. De Niro is also co-producing with Peter Gatien, entrepreneur and friend 
of Palminteri, who co-produced the play in New York and owns an international 
chain of nightclubs. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked as a doorman at Peter's nightclub in New York in 1982," Palminteri 
said. "We became good friends. I left when my career started taking off." But 
they remained close and when Palminteri needed money to stage "Bronx Tale" in 
Hollywood, he called Gatien, who sent $25,000 by express mail. "Peter stood by 
me when I needed it. I was determined to stand by him," Palminteri said. 
</P>
<P>
"Chazz got what he wanted," Westheimer emphasized, "an all-inclusive services 
deal -- a vehicle for Peter, himself and De Niro. The only thing they're not 
doing is catering the food." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the unprecedented surge of power to the writer, the pattern remains 
as inconclusive as ever. There was a lucrative movie in Robert Harling's "Steel 
Magnolias" -- and a terrible one in "A Chorus Line," which Universal bought for 
a whopping $5.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
During the last two years, Terrence McNally's "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair 
de Lune" was sold to Paramount for a reported $600,000 (with an escalator 
deal). And Ken Ludwig's "Lend Me a Tenor" was optioned by the Price Company for 
an unconfirmed $150,000 (to include screenplay and option, in a complex deal 
that could go as high as $750,000 if the movie gets made and the author gets 
sole screenplay credit). 
</P>
<P>
Some deals are less terrific than others, as in the case of "Other People's 
Money" (which, ironically, topped $1 million in operating profits at the 
Minetta Lane Theatre early in May). There was a low-cost resale of Jerry 
Sterner's hugely popular Off Broadway hit to Norman Jewison for Warner Bros. 
(Alvin Sargent, who won Oscars for "Ordinary People" and "Julia," is writing 
the screenplay). Sterner had made his own deal, selling the rights to producer 
Devina Belling before his play ever hit the stage. Belling took it to King's 
Road Productions. 
</P>
<P>
"That was 1986-87," Sterner said from New York, declining to name a dollar 
amount. "For an unknown, unproduced play by an unknown playwright, the offer 
was very flattering. At the time, it was a fortune. And King's Road was small 
enough that I was told it would not get lost in the machinations of a larger 
company." 
</P>
<P>
But when King's Road stock fell from $8 to less than $1, Belling took the 
script to Warner Bros. and a renegotiation took place, which, this time, was 
handled by Sterner's agent, Esther Sherman, who says she's not proud of it. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been great to have had an auction," she said. "That's good 
agenting. But I had to choreograph Devina's making a deal with Warner's when 
Jewison and Warner's became involved." 
</P>
<P>
For how much? Sherman would only venture a ballpark figure: 
</P>
<P>
"Under $500,000. I also did the deal for 'Little Shop of Horrors.' For about 
$500,000. Today it would be $1.5 million. But it was Howard Ashman's first 
film, and he just won the Oscar for 'Little Mermaid.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Esther did great and I'm thrilled," Sterner insisted. "Listen, I'm a 
businessman. Money has never been an object. If 'Other People's Money' never 
made a dime it wouldn't matter," said the 51-year-old writer who only started 
writing at age 42. "In the rush for the numbers we sometimes lose sight of the 
real success."

Jailbirds for Jesus: A group of convicted murderers and other criminals in 
Nashville, Tenn., have recorded four gospel songs in hopes of repaying the 
victims of their misdeeds. The New Faith Singers, made up of a dozen Tennessee 
State Penitentiary inmates, recorded their songs for Warner Bros., which has 
the option of releasing the music. 
</P>
<P>
Songwriter and minister Moses Dillard is promoting the singers and said he will 
ask Gov. Ned McWherter to move them to a minimum-security prison so they can 
get out to perform for churches, schools and civic groups. Dillard organized 
the singers while ministering to them in prison. He said the state refused to 
allow them to leave for recording sessions, so a temporary studio was built in 
the prison chapel. Two studio musicians came in every day to back up the 
singers. GREG BRAXTON

Redford the Environmentalist: Robert Redford urged a new crop of university 
graduates over the weekend to force politicians into ending a decade of "naked 
greed and profit at the expense of the environment." 
</P>
<P>
The actor and longtime environmental activist spoke Saturday at commencement 
ceremonies on the Boston campus of the University of Massachusetts. "It is time 
to send a message to our elected officials that if they do not protect our 
environment they will be voted out of office or never get elected in the first 
place," he said. Redford, who received an honorary doctorate of science degree, 
also criticized President Bush for failing to follow up on campaign promises to 
improve the environment. GREG BRAXTON

LARRY KING SIGNS PACT WITH CNN FOR A REPORTED $8 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Talk show host Larry King has signed a new five-year contract to remain with 
CNN for what may be a record-breaking agreement for cable, reportedly about $8 
million, sources reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The multi-year contract was confirmed by CNN and King's Boston-based attorney, 
Bob Woolf. 
</P>
<P>
In a phone interview from Washington, where his show originates, King said that 
there had been approaches from CBS, Lorimar Productions, Warner Bros., Disney, 
Columbia Pictures and producer Peter Guber to present him in TV projects 
especially tailored to him. 
</P>
<P>
"They all made very attractive offers," King said. "But I'm 56 years old. I 
have a special place at CNN. In an insecure business, I have a secure job. A 
five-year contract is very unusual. If you know where you're at, why move? And 
I can certainly live on what they pay me. It's in the high seven figures." 
</P>
<P>
According to King, CBS proposed putting him in the late-night slot recently 
occupied by "The Pat Sajak Show," which was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
"Except that it would have been 1 1/2 hours with phone calls," he said. 
</P>
<P>
King's nightly, one-hour CNN show, "Larry King Live," which is seen here at 6 
p.m. and 1 a.m., consists of interviews and phone calls from viewers. 
</P>
<P>
CNN, the cable network owned by Ted Turner, celebrated its 10th year last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Of his new contract, King remarked, "I don't think Ted Turner ever expected to 
pay that kind of money. But he's been very successful." 
</P>
<P>
The new deal calls for King to also do occasional specials for other Turner 
cable channels, including TNT and superstation TBS, said a CNN spokeswoman. 
Woolf said that Turner also has given King permission to host occasional, 
worldwide, Ed Sullivan-type variety shows for NBC if a deal is worked out. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, King turned down an ABC offer to host a talk show following 
Ted Koppel's "Nightline," opting to remain with CNN.

A SONG FOR VICTIMS OF TIAN AN MEN SQUARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK PHILIPS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds, possibly thousands, of Chinese students were slaughtered at Beijing's 
Tian An Men Square one year ago on June 4, 1989. Philip Woo does not want 
anyone to forget it. 
</P>
<P>
In commemoration of the massacre, the 33-year-old New York musician composed a 
song, "Tian An Men Square," and convinced more than 40 artists and musicians, 
including Living Colour's Vernon Reid, Michelle Shocked, Richie Havens and 
Valerie Simpson, to participate in a music video, which will be featured on 
segments of MTV News tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"This song speaks about the struggle for human freedom in China and the passion 
for democracy demonstrated in the protest," Woo said in a telephone interview 
from his New York office. "It's important that the memory of these brave 
students lives on." 
</P>
<P>
Woo is a third-generation Seattle-born Chinese American with distant relatives 
in the province of Guandong, China. As a musician he has played keyboards and 
written music for recording artists such as Whitney Houston, Gladys Knight and 
Maze. 
</P>
<P>
He founded the nonprofit Project for Tian An Men Square in December and asked 
his brothers Roger and John (owners of the New York film design and production 
company Woo Art International), to direct and produce the video for the song. 
The video fuses broadcast footage of the bloody massacre with studio 
performances from the artists, as well as material gathered from independent 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the one-night "We Are the World" recording date, the Project for Tian An 
Men Square took seven sessions and more than a month to complete. The song was 
recorded and mixed at several New York studios, each of which donated their 
time and materials. A number of Los Angeles artists and musicians were 
originally expected to add their voices to the project, but scheduling 
conflicts and time restrictions prevented their participation. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought by now that we would have a record distribution deal for the song, 
but we don't," Woo said. "Still, we intend to keep pushing. This project is 
dear to all of us involved. If we have to put out the record and video 
ourselves, that's what we're going to do." 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the project, Woo says, will be used to underwrite groups 
dedicated to supporting humanitarian, educational and informational goals in 
China. The first recipient targeted for aid is the Boston-based Democracy for 
China Fund, a nonprofit organization run by Shen Tong, a student leader who 
escaped from China following the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
But the issue of raising money, Woo says, is secondary. His primary concern is 
to raise awareness in the United States regarding the plight of people 
struggling for freedom in China and around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people are not allowed access to information. They are denied the most 
basic human and economic rights," Woo said. "All around the globe, people are 
willing to die for privileges that we, as Americans, simply take for granted."

KIDBEAT: LITHGOW TAKES ON A NEW ROLE IN MUSIC VIDEO

John Lithgow, children's entertainer? 
</P>
<P>
The Oscar-nominated, Tony- and Emmy Award-winning actor -- who wore a dress 
when he burst on the national scene in "The World According to Garp," played a 
psychopathic murderer in Brian DePalma's "Blow Out" and was Glenda Jackson's 
sparring partner onstage in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" -- has made a 
singing, guitar-strumming video for small fry. 
</P>
<P>
In "Baby Songs Presents John Lithgow's Kid-Size Concert," the actor accompanies 
himself on acoustic guitar and sings simple, upbeat traditional fare and his 
own original nonsense songs to a group of elementary school children. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-minute video, produced for Hi-Tops Video, is the fourth in the "Baby 
Songs" series. It will be released Wednesday, at a suggested retail price of 
$14.98. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, Lithgow said that his new kid-sized role is not such a 
departure, nor is it new. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been singing for children for years -- at home to my own, in their 
classrooms and at benefit concerts for their schools," he said. "I did a 
concert a year ago (for UCLA Child Care Services) and the producers of 'Baby 
Songs' came, I guess on a little talent search. I had had sort of a vague idea 
of doing a video; they pulled it together." 
</P>
<P>
How did his songs evolve? 
</P>
<P>
"I always made them up with my children -- they're 6 and 7 and 18 now," Lithgow 
said. "In 'Big Kids Scare the Heck Out of Me,' I thought kids would enjoy 
seeing a big man talk about being afraid of big kids; it brings out the 
compassion in them." He laughed. "Makes them feel they want to help me through 
this terrible crisis." 
</P>
<P>
" 'Mr. McCloud' emerged through improvising with kids over the years. It's 
wonderful to get kids to sing along and make a big racket and then bring them 
back to earth. That song is about impulse control." 
</P>
<P>
Lithgow even added his own touch to the familiar "She'll Be Comin' Round the 
Mountain," with comic lyrics such as "we'll put ice cubes down her collar." 
Each verse is illustrated by a variety of raucous noises. It ends, "in a 
complete cacophony of sound." 
</P>
<P>
Music is important for children, Lithgow said, because "it can help put them in 
touch with their feelings and gives them something they can learn and master. 
Kids have to learn they can do things, to feel good about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Lithgow, who recently completed work on "L.A. Story," with Steve Martin, "a 
film for childish grown-ups," is about to begin Hector Babenco's "At Play in 
the Fields of the Lord," now filming in the Amazon. "It's definitely not for 
children," said the actor. 
</P>
<P>
Are there more kids' concert videos in Lithgow's future? 
</P>
<P>
"I'll return by public demand," he joked, "but I'm going to have to get 
somebody to help me write songs. These few have taken me 18 years to write." 
</P>
<P>
Lithgow does admit to some tongue-in-cheek anxiety that his new venture may get 
him typecast. "I'm afraid I'll never work again in my chosen profession."

WISCONSIN GROUP OPPOSES STATES' NEA PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: RESISTANCE TO THE PROPOSAL DEALS A BLOW TO HOUSE REPUBLICANS. 
CALIFORNIA COULD SUFFER A $3-MILLION CUT IN FEDERAL SUPPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In a blow to House Republicans, Wisconsin's state arts council came out in 
opposition Monday to a proposal to radically alter federal support for the 
arts. 
</P>
<P>
The council joined growing political opposition to the plan, which would divert 
60% of the budget of the National Endowment for the Arts to states. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, meanwhile, the California Legislative Joint Committee on the 
Arts released calculations concluding that the restructuring of the NEA would 
produce a net cut in the state's federal arts money of $6 million to $9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Direct federal aid to the California Arts Council would be increased from 
$727,000 this year to $2.8 million using budget projections for future funding 
under the plan, according to the staff of the committee. But its chair, State 
Sen. Henry Mello (D-Watsonville), said California's share of total money would 
be cut as much as 50% or more. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican proposal would reserve 40% of NEA money for grants to large 
established arts organizations. The remaining 60% would go to state agencies -- 
triple the proportion now. 
</P>
<P>
The unrelated Wisconsin and California announcements raised new questions about 
the controversial Republican proposal two days before a House subcommittee 
resumes consideration of legislative reauthorization of the NEA, which has been 
wracked by political controversy for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
But the chairman of the subcommittee observed Monday that the continuing swirl 
of concern about the endowment's political future makes it increasingly likely 
that the NEA will undergo some form of restructuring this year. Rep. Pat 
Williams (D-Mont.) said in a telephone interview that the GOP proposal and 
political uncertainties facing the NEA "do seem to me to create the opportunity 
to consider necessary changes." 
</P>
<P>
The House subcommittee, Williams said, "has moved a little now from total 
defense in trying to keep the NEA alive to serious consideration of necessary 
changes." He offered no specifics and said he believes it may be fall -- when 
separate House and Senate reauthorization bills are rationalized in conference 
committee -- before the NEA's fate is known. 
</P>
<P>
The Wisconsin action -- a unanimous vote of the five-member executive committee 
of the Wisconsin Arts Board in Madison -- was significant because a co-sponsor 
of the Republican plan is Rep. Steve Gunderson (R-Wis.), the House chief deputy 
whip, who now must grapple with the dilemma of advocating a shift in funding 
that his own state arts agency opposes. Gunderson did not return calls seeking 
his reaction to the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Gunderson's political plight is complicated by the fact that the Missouri Arts 
Council -- home agency of the other co-sponsor, Rep. Tom Coleman (R-Mo.) -- 
opposed the plan May 16. 
</P>
<P>
Rejection of the Coleman-Gunderson plan by the two councils appeared to create 
significant difficulties for advancing the proposal. The Wednesday hearing is 
to hear further testimony on the Republican proposal, as well as on a competing 
plan drawn up by a coalition of arts organizations at Williams' behest. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, the Wisconsin statement was of support for the arts organization 
plan, which, in turn, emphatically rejected the 60%/40% split. The strategy 
enabled the Wisconsin arts board to avoid opposing Gunderson directly. The 
Missouri Arts Council chose a similar tactic by opposing the National Assembly 
of State Arts Agencies, which proposed the alternative in the first place -- 
but has since backed off from it -- and leaving Coleman unnamed. 
</P>
<P>
The Wisconsin action came after three members of the arts board met in 
Milwaukee Friday with representatives of several large cultural institutions, 
including the Milwaukee Repertory Theater, Pabst Theater, Milwaukee Ballet and 
Milwaukee Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman said Monday that the opposition left him undeterred. "I think the 
effort here by Missouri and Wisconsin obviously is to embarrass the two 
sponsors," Coleman said. "I think the wagons have been circled and there is an 
effort (by) these agencies to get back in step with the so-called arts 
community." 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, Mello attacked the Republican proposal, which has been opposed 
by at least eight influential state arts councils. The California Arts Council 
was the first in the country to announce its opposition. "I understand the 
motives of Congressmen Coleman and Gunderson are good in that they are trying 
to find a compromise for reauthorization," Mello said in a statement, "but this 
proposal has a very negative impact on California."

PARENTING MAGAZINES DO BATTLE; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLISHING: A LAWSUIT IS A SIGN OF THE INTENSE COMPETITION TO REACH THE 
LUCRATIVE MARKET OF BABY BOOMERS WITH BABIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Frank Dobrucki says he got into the business of publishing magazines for 
parents because he thought it was "safe" -- non-controversial and, as he puts 
it, "wholesome." 
</P>
<P>
But now Dobrucki, editor and publisher of Valley Family Magazine and L.A. 
Family Magazine, says that his biggest rival, L.A. Parent Magazine, has made 
the business anything but safe for him and his C.D. Publications Inc. in 
Encino. 
</P>
<P>
Dobrucki contended in a lawsuit filed May 23 in Superior Court in Los Angeles 
that Burbank-based Wingate Enterprises, which publishes L.A. Parent, has tried 
to put him out of business by encouraging -- and even threatening -- 
advertisers to get them to stop placing ads in Valley Family and L.A. Family. 
</P>
<P>
Carey Bierman, L.A. Parent's publisher, denies the accusations. "Come on, 
nobody does that," he said. "This isn't Chicago in the '50s." 
</P>
<P>
But the suit, which seeks an injunction against L.A. Parent and unspecified 
damages, is a sure sign of the intense competition to be the magazine favored 
by retailers and other businesses to reach upscale moms and dads. Each 
publisher says he doesn't worry about what the other's magazine is doing. But 
they surely compete: Both publish free circulation magazines -- distributed in 
toy stores, children's clothing stores, supermarkets and the like -- whose only 
revenue is advertising sales. 
</P>
<P>
The competing magazines both try to cash in on the raising of baby boomers' 
babies. Along with articles, they print schedules of educational and 
entertainment events for children and run lots of ads for clothes, toys, camps, 
children's movies and safety equipment such as pool covers. 
</P>
<P>
The business has been good for L.A. Parent, which has been published for more 
than a decade, compared with 20 months for Valley Family. 
</P>
<P>
But Dobrucki's suit contends that beginning last September, Wingate set out to 
"drive" Valley Family and L.A. Family "out of business and to injure 
competition so that defendant Wingate would once again become the only 
participant in the market for family-oriented monthly magazines in Los Angeles 
County." 
</P>
<P>
According to the suit, L.A. Parent told advertising clients that Valley Family 
and L.A. Family "were going out of business." The suit alleges that L.A. Parent 
also tried to coax advertisers with "rates that were substantially below their 
regular advertising rates, contingent upon such advertisers agreeing not to 
advertise in Valley Family Magazine or L.A. Family Magazine." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most serious charge in Dobrucki's suit is that Wingate encouraged 
its employees "to take whatever measures are necessary" to pry advertisers from 
L.A. Family and Valley Family -- "including acts constituting threats, 
intimidation, fraudulent misrepresentations and other wrongful means." 
</P>
<P>
The alleged threats, according to the suit, included warnings that advertisers 
"would be put out of business" or "would be unable to remain in business" if 
they advertised in Dobrucki's magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Bierman of L.A. Parent denied each of the allegations in the suit. He also 
complained that because the charges are not specific -- names and dates are not 
cited -- it's hard for him to respond effectively. 
</P>
<P>
But Dobrucki and his attorney, Peter Aronson, refused to elaborate on the 
claims, saying specifics will come out later. 
</P>
<P>
Bierman also said that Dobrucki had never brought up his allegations before the 
suit, a claim that Aronson denied. 
</P>
<P>
"We're totally perplexed by this," Bierman said. "There was no indication of 
anything to come." 
</P>
<P>
Bierman and his brother, Jack, also publish Parenting Magazine in Orange County 
and San Diego Parent. According to Parenting Publications of America, a trade 
group, L.A. Parent's 100,000 circulation makes it the biggest publication of 
its kind in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But Dobrucki contends that his two publications also have a circulation of 
100,000. 
</P>
<P>
The local parent-oriented magazines, along with their nationally circulated 
counterparts, are responding to an increase in spending on children's products. 
From 1979 to 1988, for instance, U.S. sales of children's products (excluding 
clothes and toys) increased 179% -- to $1.95 billion -- according to the 
Juvenile Products Manufacturers Assn., a trade group. 
</P>
<P>
That spending, which has created a lucrative surge in advertising, has mostly 
been fueled by baby boomers, who now dominate the ranks of parents.

<P>
EXPANSION: THE BURBANK TITLE COMPANY IS AMONG THOSE EXPANDING BEYOND LOS 
ANGELES TO INCREASE BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Title insurance -- now there's an unsexy business. Even Norman (Spike) 
Burlingame, who with Martin S. Evans runs Gateway Title Co. in Burbank, 
concedes that most customers view title insurance "as a necessary evil." 
</P>
<P>
But Evans and Burlingame aren't after glamour, they're after growth. And in the 
nine years since they bought a then-dormant Gateway, they've managed to keep 
the company growing in a hotly competitive title industry that serves Southern 
California's enormous real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
The revenue of privately held Gateway, which the pair bought with $450,000 
after both left Safeco Title Insurance Co., reached $38.5 million last year and 
should climb to $50 million in 1990, they said. They also are shooting for $100 
million in revenue by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Gateway, in fact, is one of several local title companies that are expanding 
beyond their back yards. A Gateway neighbor, World Title Co. in Burbank, now 
operates 11 offices in seven counties, expects $40 million in revenue this year 
and plans to move into the Antelope and San Joaquin valleys, said World 
President Michael Lowther. 
</P>
<P>
"Gateway reflects the emergence of a more aggressive style" of title companies 
"by virtue of expanding into new markets," said Lawrence Green, executive vice 
president of the California Land Title Assn., the industry's statewide trade 
group. 
</P>
<P>
For a fee, title companies such as Gateway guarantee titles to real estate when 
the property changes hands, or when someone borrows money using the property as 
collateral. When someone buys a house, for instance, the title company makes 
sure that no one else has any right to the property, such as a lien or right of 
way. 
</P>
<P>
If later it turns out that the title company erred, and someone does have a 
right to the property, the title company is liable for reimbursing the person 
to whom it originally sold the title insurance. The exact amount is usually 
negotiated, and most policies have a cap that limits the dollar amount of 
claims, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
Banks and other lenders in California, to protect their investment, almost 
always require title insurance before funding a mortgage loan, he said. There 
are about a dozen major title insurers that operate nationwide, and thousands 
of title agencies, such as Gateway, that sell and service policies actually 
underwritten by the insurers. Gateway's main underwriter, for example, is 
Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Co., a unit of financier Saul Steinberg's 
Reliance Group Holdings Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Some title companies are focusing their expansion on such burgeoning real 
estate markets as the Antelope Valley, the Riverside/San Bernardino area and 
north San Diego, where they can fight for business with fewer rivals than in 
Los Angeles County, where nearly 30 competitors vie for market share. 
</P>
<P>
A good part of Gateway's expansion will come from its planned march into 
Northern California, a move that will include acquisitions. Currently pending 
is Gateway's purchase of American Title Insurance Co. in Santa Clara County, 
and once completed, Gateway will have 770 employees spread over 16 offices in 
seven counties. 
</P>
<P>
There are other reasons for Gateway's growth: the area's strong real estate 
market and inflation, both of which keep lifting property values and hence 
Gateway's fees, which generally are set as a percentage of value of the 
property involved. California alone accounts for about a quarter of the 
nation's $4-billion title business. 
</P>
<P>
And there's another factor that doesn't hurt Gateway. Fred Sands, whose Fred 
Sands Realtors is one of the biggest real estate agencies in Los Angeles, is 
one of Gateway's two outside stockholders and naturally a customer, although 
Sands said his firm accounts for less than 5% of Gateway's business. (Evans, 
58, and Burlingame, 49, together own the controlling stake in Gateway.) 
</P>
<P>
Still, Sands asserted that Gateway "is the best title company in L.A." because 
of its service. "We've had occasions where agents have called them at night and 
end up talking to the president because they have a problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Burlingame said Gateway wants to expand because "there's a vibrancy created 
with growth that translates to people's attitudes in the company. The monetary 
rewards speak for themselves," he said without disclosing specific earnings 
figures. "If you can make 5% or 10% profit on $100 million versus 5% or 10% on 
$10 million, it's better for the stockholders, too." 
</P>
<P>
Title executives agree there's not much difference between companies in terms 
of prices, which must be approved by state insurance regulators and typically 
are set as a percentage of the value of the property involved. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty narrow spectrum" of prices between companies, Burlingame said. 
</P>
<P>
The trick in generating business, he and Evans said, is in having top-rate 
personnel, client relationships and service -- as mundane as that sounds. 
Gateway salespeople hound real estate agents, escrow companies, lenders and 
real estate lawyers trying to get Gateway involved in their deals. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a product that's differentiated from our competitors', except 
insofar as the people we have are better," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
Sands, the real estate chief, agreed. "That's all a title company can offer is 
service," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gateway's service has its competitors taking notice. Lawrence White, executive 
vice president of First American Title Insurance, a unit of First American 
Financial Corp. in Santa Ana and one of the nation's biggest title insurers, 
said Gateway has "good people and they know the markets they're in." 
</P>
<P>
But like all title companies, Gateway must watch the kind of business it 
writes. Along with California's swelling real estate market has come an 
increase in title fraud and forgery, which can increase a title company's 
losses. Evans estimated that Gateway pays out about $7.50 in claims for every 
$100 that its title policies generate in revenue. The California Land Title 
Assn. said the average in the state is $10 or more. 
</P>
<P>
Gateway's record also has attracted potential suitors. Evans said the company 
gets about a phone call per month from would-be buyers, but that Gateway turns 
them away. However, the company does plan to consider issuing its first stock 
to the public during the next year, to raise cash for -- what else -- 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Said Evans: "The major counties in the north would all be possible targets for 
us down the line."

REGIONAL EARNINGS: DAMON GROUP REPORTS LOSS IN 2ND QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Damon Group Inc. in Sherman Oaks said it lost $1.89 million in its fiscal 
second quarter that ended March 31, compared with a loss of $371,000 a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Damon Group, which recently changed its name from American Magnetics Corp., 
also has changed its focus to medical testing labs from manufacturing 
electronic bank card and credit card readers. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the company invested in a chain of medical labs and recently it 
announced the $12-million sale of its magnetic card business, which is to be 
completed June 15. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the lab chain's contribution, Damon Group's sales soared to 
$51.7 million in the second quarter from $322,000 for the same period a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
For the six months ended March 31, Damon lost $2.7 million, compared to a 
$531,000 loss a year earlier. Its six-month sales climbed to $101.9 million 
from $640,000.

cost controls, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
For its full fiscal year, PerfectData earned $132,000, compared with $10,000 
the previous year, and its annual sales climbed to $4.05 million from $3.6

COURT LETS RELIGIOUS CLUBS MEET IN SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
RULING: THE U.S. SUPREME COURT DECIDES THAT HIGH SCHOOLS THAT ALLOW 
EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES ON CAMPUS MUST ALSO PERMIT STUDENTS TO GATHER FOR 
PRAYER.

<P>
The Supreme Court Monday opened the doors of public high schools to prayer and 
Bible reading, ruling that secondary schools that allow extracurricular 
activities on campus must also permit religious students to meet for prayer. 
</P>
<P>
On an 8-1 vote, the court said that religious clubs may meet as long as the 
groups are student-sponsored. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Christian evangelicals said that the ruling will stop 
discrimination against religious students in the public schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, we're dancing in the sky," said the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, head of the 
Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition. "It means that a student does not 
have to check his values and beliefs at the school's front door anymore. . . . 
That's what equal access is all about." 
</P>
<P>
But critics said that the ruling will also open the school doors to every 
organization from the Ku Klux Klan to the Young Communists League, because the 
law that the ruling upheld also forbids discrimination against groups based on 
their political or philosophical views. 
</P>
<P>
The case was watched closely by Orange County's Saddleback Valley Unified 
School District, which was involved in another Bible club case that went to the 
U.S. Supreme Court in 1988. The earlier case had the opposite outcome. 
</P>
<P>
That time, the high court allowed to stand a lower court ruling that denied 
students at two Saddleback high schools the right to promote or advertise 
religious-oriented clubs during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
Student members of the New Life Christian Club at El Toro and Mission Viejo 
high schools are allowed to meet informally on the campus but must do so 
outdoors, during their lunch period. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Hartman, superintendent of the Saddleback Valley school district, said 
Monday that it did not appear at first glance he did not believe at first 
glance that Monday's decision would contradict his district's policy. 
</P>
<P>
that the court's latest decision contradict's his district's policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Our policy is that groups that we feel are not related to the curriculum 
cannot meet during the school day," Hartman said. "It's called the 
closed-campus rule. If someone wanted to form a ski club and we do not have 
skiing in our curriculum, for example, they could not meet during the school 
day." 
</P>
<P>
He said the district will study the decision more closely this week. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly three decades ago, the high court set off a national furor by outlawing 
official prayer and school-sponsored Bible readings. The court has held firmly 
to the view that the Constitution forbids the government from injecting 
religion into the public schools. 
</P>
<P>
But conservatives and Christian legal activists have complained that the 
doctrine of "separation of church and state" has been extended so far that it 
has turned into hostility toward religion. In fact, many school officials 
interpreted the court's decision against school-sponsored prayer as a ban on 
all religious activities on school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department attorneys under the Ronald Reagan and Bush administrations 
challenged that interpretation, saying that religious students should have the 
same rights as others to meet on campus. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the high court agreed, ruling that the Constitution does not require 
that the schools be off-limits to religion. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a crucial difference between government speech endorsing religion, 
which the Establishment Clause (of the First Amendment) forbids, and private 
speech endorsing religion," said Justice Sandra Day O'Connor for the court. 
Allowing students to meet on campus and discuss religion is constitutional, 
O'Connor said, because it does not amount to "state sponsorship of religion." 
</P>
<P>
If a high school allows meetings of groups such as the chess or the stamp club, 
whose activities are "not directly related to" the curriculum, it must also 
allow religious groups to meet there, O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the Christian students predicted that prayer clubs will spring up 
on high school campuses nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"This decision sends a loud and clear message that religious speech on school 
campuses is protected, and that public school officials can't stand in the 
way," said Atlanta lawyer Jay Alan Sekulow, general counsel for Christian 
Advocates Serving Evangelism, who represented the students in this case. 
</P>
<P>
But an array of religious and civil liberties groups said that the ruling will 
result in students being pressured to join religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Undoubtedly, the evangelicals will try to put one of these clubs into every 
school in the country . . . I think students will be pressured by their peers 
to join these groups," said Marc Stern, an attorney for the American Jewish 
Congress, who represented a Nebraska school board in this case. 
</P>
<P>
Justice John Paul Stevens, the lone dissenter, said that the ruling "creates a 
constitutional obligation to allow student members of the Ku Klux Klan or the 
Communist Party to have access to school facilities." 
</P>
<P>
But O'Connor noted that the federal law allows school authorities to ban 
disruptive groups. 
</P>
<P>
This case (Board of Education vs. Mergens, 88-1597) arose in 1985 when Bridget 
Mergens and several other students at a high school in Omaha, Neb., told their 
principal that they wanted to form a Christian club to meet after school. 
</P>
<P>
The year before, Congress had passed the Equal Access Act which said that 
public secondary schools which allow extracurricular student clubs may not 
"discriminate" against some clubs because of their members "religious, 
political (or) philosophical" views. 
</P>
<P>
The principal, backed by the school board, refused. He said that all the school 
clubs were "curricular," so the federal law did not apply. Second, he contended 
that allowing a religious club to meet on campus would violate the First 
Amendment's ban on the "establishment of religion" by the government. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court rejected both arguments Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The court also defined one of the act's key terms -- "noncurriculum-related 
student group" -- in a way that applies the law to nearly every high school. 
</P>
<P>
If French is taught in a high school, a French club would be a curricular club, 
O'Connor said. But if chess and stamp collecting are not taught as subjects, 
those clubs are "noncurriculum" groups. Once the school allows any of these 
clubs to meet, she said, it must open the door to all clubs. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling leaves high school officials with three choices, said August 
Steinhilber, general counsel for the National School Boards Assn. They could 
eliminate all student clubs. They could allow only clubs that are tied directly 
to the curriculum. Or they must open their doors to all clubs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 Equal Access Act says that teachers may not participate in the student 
clubs, nor may the clubs be controlled by parents or other outsiders. But 
school attorneys said that outside groups can encourage the formation of a 
school club. 
</P>
<P>
"Planned Parenthood has wanted to have chapters in the schools. If they do, the 
right-to-life groups will want to come in, too," Steinhilber said. "When the 
young Nazis and the Satanic clubs show up, too, the school may figure it's not 
worth the fight, and they will limit it to curriculum-related clubs only." 
</P>
<P>
Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan concurred in the outcome of 
the Westside High School case but expressed serious reservations. Marshall, in 
an opinion joined by Brennan, said that schools such as Westside must be 
careful to "effectively disassociate themselves from the religious speech that 
now may become commonplace in their facilities." 
</P>
<P>
In another case decided Monday the court ruled unanimously that nuclear 
"whistle-blowers" who are disciplined by their employers may sue for damages in 
a state court, in addition to filing claims under a 1974 federal law that 
protects whistle-blowers (English vs. General Electric Co., 89-152). An appeals 
court in Richmond, Va., said last year that a federal complaint was the only 
remedy for discharged nuclear employees.

L.A. SUPERVISOR DISTRICTS ILLEGAL, JUDGE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge ruled Monday that the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors 
intentionally discriminated against Latinos in 1981 when it drew new district 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
In a decision that could dramatically alter the county's political landscape, 
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon found that the supervisors violated the 
federal Voting Rights Act and must draft a new redistricting plan designed to 
help the first Latino win a seat on the powerful board. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he would wait until a hearing Thursday to decide whether to 
throw out the results of balloting today for two supervisorial seats. He also 
urged the supervisors to reconsider expanding the five-member board to remedy 
discrimination against Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
In a 131-page opinion, Kenyon said, "The Hispanic community has sadly been 
denied an equal opportunity to participate in the political process and to 
elect candidates of their choice to the Board of Supervisors. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"During the 1981 redistricting process," the judge wrote, "the supervisors' 
primary objective was to protect their incumbencies and that of their allies. 
This objective, however, was inescapably linked to the continued fragmentation 
of the Hispanic population core." 
</P>
<P>
The historic voting rights lawsuit was filed by the U.S. Justice Department and 
civil rights groups in 1988, two years after the Los Angeles City Council 
settled a similar suit and created a Latino district. 
</P>
<P>
The suit against the county alleged that the all-Anglo Board of Supervisors met 
secretly in 1981 and divided heavily Latino neighborhoods in East Los Angeles 
and the San Gabriel Valley into three districts, diluting the voting strength 
of Latinos. All five members of the current board participated in the 
redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos account for a third of the county's population, but no Spanish-surnamed 
person has ever been elected to the board. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling not only enhances the chances for the first Latino to be elected, it 
also may have broader repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling could end a decade of conservative dominance of the board, which 
oversees a $10-billion budget and serves 8 1/2 million residents -- a 
population that is greater than those of 42 states. It also could threaten the 
political security of some board members. 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, attorneys for both sides said, the district boundaries face 
a radical realignment, altering the political representation for hundreds of 
thousands of county residents. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich denied Monday that the board discriminated against 
Latinos and called the ruling a "joy ride of judicial activism." He said that 
he is certain that the board will appeal the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn said he will introduce a motion at today's meeting 
asking supervisors to place on the November ballot a measure expanding the 
five-member board to seven members. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Peter Schabarum called it "unfortunate" that Kenyon would rule on 
the eve of the election, "further confusing the election." 
</P>
<P>
"I continue to believe that district lines should not be based on ethnic 
factors," said Schabarum, who decided not to run for reelection this year. 
Supervisors Ed Edelman, who is seeking reelection today in the 3rd District, 
and Deane Dana had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the county, which spent more than $3 million fighting the voting 
rights lawsuit, did not return calls Monday. They had previously asked Kenyon 
to allow today's election winners to serve until a special election can be held 
under a new redistricting plan. The plaintiffs have asked that today's election 
results be thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
One of the top contenders in today's 10-candidate race to succeed Schabarum in 
the 1st District is a Latina, Sarah Flores. 
</P>
<P>
"What is this telling (our supporters), that all that work and all that energy 
is wasted?" Flores lamented Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But civil rights attorneys have argued that even if a Latino wins, it does not 
resolve the issues that prompted the lawsuit -- that Latinos are denied an 
opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice to the board. 
</P>
<P>
"We will ask for the results of the election to be set aside," said Mark 
Rosenbaum, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, a plaintiff in 
the suit. "The judge's decision means the election in Districts 1 and 3 are 
illegal." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbaum said he will "argue for a special election and for an expanded 
board." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for both sides previously have said that they believe the judge will 
give the supervisors time -- Kenyon may decide Thursday how long -- to redraw 
their lines for five or more districts. If the judge disapproves of the new 
redistricting plan, he can redraw the boundaries. The plaintiffs have said they 
will recommend plans to the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was brought by the Justice Department, the ACLU and the Mexican 
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund to reverse what the plaintiffs said 
was a decades-long pattern of discrimination. The suit was filed on behalf of 
five Latino voters. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, the plaintiffs alleged that since the 1950s, the county had 
deliberately fashioned district lines to deny Latinos political representation 
on the board. Witnesses testified that the discrimination ranged from 
restricted access to swimming pools and movie theaters in the early 1900s to 
English literacy requirements for voting in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
In a hastily called press conference at the MALDEF office in downtown Los 
Angeles, Latino leaders praised the judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"We want a remedy now," said Antonia Hernandez, president and general counsel 
of MALDEF. "To be told once again to wait is not acceptable. We will not wait." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said MALDEF will seek to have a redistricting plan formulated within 
a month. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbaum said a new election could be held by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Gloria Molina, who had earlier said she would 
consider running for supervisor, praised the ruling. "It means we have a fair 
opportunity to elect our own . . . and finally, finally, get Latino 
representation on the Board of Supervisors." 
</P>
<P>
For Yolanda Garza, the East Los Angeles chemical engineer on whose behalf the 
ACLU-MALDEF suit was filed, the victory was particularly sweet. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was going to happen," she said. "Now I can go back and tell my 
community that it made a difference." 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, Kenyon urged supervisors to reconsider expanding the board, 
saying he believes the districts are too large for one person to adequately 
represent. 
</P>
<P>
The judge did not recommend a size for an expanded board. But plaintiffs have 
talked about increasing the board from five to seven or nine seats. Expansion 
has been opposed by the board's conservative majority. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, the explosive and continuous growth of the Los Angeles County 
Hispanic community was evident at the time of the adoption of the 1981 
redistricting plan as was the steady decline of the county's non-Hispanic white 
population," Kenyon wrote. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, the county argued that it was not possible for the board to 
carve out a district in which a majority of the voters are Latino because many 
Latinos are not citizens or old enough to vote. The county also denied that it 
engaged in discrimination and said that some supervisors attempted 
unsuccessfully to carve out a Latino district. 
</P>
<P>
But Kenyon ruled, "The court finds that Hispanic community is sufficiently 
large and geographically compact such that a five-district plan can be drawn in 
which Hispanics comprise a majority of the citizen voting-age population in one 
of the five districts." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's last supervisorial redistricting also took place in 1981, but 
no legal objections have been raised to it, so Monday's decision is not 
expected to have any effect there, said County Counsel Adrian Kupyer. 
</P>
<P>
Kupyer said Orange County officials will review the ruling in preparing for the 
county's next redistricting, scheduled for 1991, but added that he does not 
expect it alter the government's redistricting practices.

About 200 people from the Latino rights group Hermandad Mexicana Nacional 
demonstrated against the City Council Monday night after it refused to award 
any federal funds to a nonprofit organization that wanted $1.4 million to build 
a police substation and install street lighting in the eastern part of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say that police patrols have already been increased in the area 
and new lighting will be installed using other public funds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real farce," said Hermandad director Nativo Lopez. "The city talks big 
about fighting crime but does not want to do anything to curb the conditions 
that lead to crime." 
</P>
<P>
The Civic Center Barrio Housing Corp., a nonprofit group that helps low-income 
residents buy their own homes, had been seeking the $1.4 million in 
city-controlled federal funds to build a police substation at Madison Park. The 
organization also wanted the city to install street lighting in a neighborhood 
bordered by First Street and Edinger, Standard and Grand avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Hermandad members, who support the Civic Center Barrio, have been filling the 
council chambers since April to lobby on behalf of the organization. On Monday, 
however, the city granted $3.6 million in federal money to more than 30 
organizations but refused to award any money to the Civic Center Barrio. LILY

Like many others in this 22-block area in the southeast section of the city, 
the mother had come to the Neighborhood Service Center at 430 S. Standard Ave. 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
But help may not be so readily available after June 17, when the center must 
vacate the church it has rented for more than two years. The Latino and 
Cambodian immigrants who have come to rely on the center for emergency food and 
clothing, paralegal and counseling services, literacy classes and medical 
referrals may be left without a place to go unless the center can find a new 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's devastating for us," said Mary Ann Salamida, the center's executive 
director. "We not only have to find a permanent site but also an interim site. 
If we interrupt our services for any longer than two weeks, we will lose much 
of our funding" from the city and the state. 
</P>
<P>
Salamida has been looking into various sites to use temporarily, including 
property owned by local developer Chris Kackar, who has offered use of an 
apartment complex on Minnie Street for a reduced rate. But that possibility 
might be snagged by city zoning laws. 
</P>
<P>
The center received a 30-day eviction notice on April 30 from the landlord, the 
Orange County Southern Baptist Assn., which wants to bring a congregation to 
the church. The center got a two-week extention, but Salamida said that still 
doesn't give her enough time. 
</P>
<P>
"The time frame is unrealistic," Salamida said. "You can't even move out of a 
house in 30 days." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Doyle Braden said the association tried to avoid evicting the center 
by searching for alternate sites for their new church for almost a year. He 
said the church couldn't give the center, which is on a month-to-month lease, 
more time because the association needs to have a new congregation in by the 
the end of June or face losing a $30,000 grant. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a matter of what we want to do," Braden said. "We were placed in a 
situation where we don't have very good choices to make." 
</P>
<P>
Program director Irene Martinez said it is vital that the center continue to 
provide services to the estimated 12,000 Latinos and Cambodians in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the link between services and the community," Martinez said. "A lot of 
residents don't know what's available to them or even if they qualify for 
services. They don't know where to start and have no idea who to trust." 
</P>
<P>
Salamida said the toughest part about the situation is having to tell the more 
than 1,000 people that the center serves each week that there may be a 
temporary shutdown of services. Last Friday, she broke the news to an English 
language class. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Battres, a student in the class, was visibly concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important that we continue," Battres said in broken English. 
"Everyone is very grateful for these classes." 
</P>
<P>
Salamida, a former administrator with United Way, remains determined to keep 
the Neighborhood Service Center running. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really a low point," she said. "But we're definitely here to stay."

FATHER TAKES BOY, 3 IN FREEWAY SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three-year-old Andre Keith Bakker IV, who witnessed the weekend shooting death 
of his mother and watched her boyfriend turn the gun on himself as they drove 
down the San Diego Freeway, was released Monday from an Orange County 
children's shelter to the custody of his father. 
</P>
<P>
The boy "is aware that his mother is dead," said Kim Berry, a friend of the 
family. "But he just says that 'Mommy's in heaven.' " 
</P>
<P>
Young Andre is described as a "precocious but mature" toddler, but relatives 
and officials at Orange County Children's Services remain concerned that he may 
suffer psychological trauma from the weekend ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
A California Highway Patrol officer found the boy in a back seat of his 
mother's car after she had been shot repeatedly by George Charles Woodford III, 
28, on Saturday night. The mother, Audrey Denise Davis, 33, died from bullet 
wounds to her head and body. Woodford, who had been arguing with Davis, then 
shot himself in the head. 
</P>
<P>
The car continued down the freeway out of control, finally grinding to a halt 
in the southbound car-pool lane north of the Springdale Street exit in 
Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Howard, Children's Services director, said that releasing the boy to the 
custody of his father, Andre Bakker III, of Los Angeles, was the "best thing" 
to do for Andre. Bakker could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The father has had regular contact with the boy and has visits every other 
week. The child knew him and called him 'Dad' and obviously showed very 
appropriate reaction to his father," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities initially believed that Bakker did not play an active role in young 
Andre's upbringing, but they found otherwise after conducting a background 
check, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, this man had been involved with the child," Howard said, describing 
a warm reunion between Andre and his father at Orangewood Children's Home in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Police continued to puzzle Monday over exactly what motivated Woodford, a 
self-employed car detailer, to fire the fatal gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
But the dead woman's family described Woodford as "extremely possessive" and 
jealous of Audrey Davis. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Kentucky, Woodford met Davis while she was buying a car. Davis 
became the registered owner of a 1976 AMC Pacer, the vehicle in which the 
murder-suicide occurred Saturday, according to the state Department of Motor 
Vehicles. Woodford moved into her Long Beach home just four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster police consider their investigation of the tragedy almost 
concluded, Lt. Andrew Hall said. Police do not know how and when Woodford got 
his hands on the weapon used. 
</P>
<P>
Audrey Davis told her family that Woodford owned a gun but had hocked it for 
cash from a pawnbroker, said Berry, the girlfriend of Davis' brother, Vincent 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Woodford, Audrey Davis and young Andre were on the way to the home of the boy's 
grandmother when the tragedy occurred Saturday night. Audrey Davis' other son, 
13-year-old Frankie, was being tended by Berry and Vincent Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
If the other youngster had been along, the episode might not have exploded out 
of control, Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankie didn't want to go to his grandmother's house, so Audrey and George 
left him with us," Berry said. "Had he been with them, maybe he would have 
prevented it or stopped it because he's a very big 13-year-old." DAVID REYES

END TO EMERGENCY MEDFLY STATUS SEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County supervisors, who have been forced to grapple with declaring a 
county state of emergency every two weeks for the past six months because of 
the Mediterranean fruit fly, will gratefully wash their hands of the subject 
today, officials predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Don R. Roth circulated a letter to his colleagues Monday in 
which he asked them to join him in formally ending the state of emergency now 
that the state has completed its aerial malathion-spraying program in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, the county was obligated to review its emergency declaration 
every two weeks. That process had become a forum for citizens to complain to 
the supervisors, creating some tense sessions and prompting disagreement among 
board members. Although none of the board members supported aerial spraying of 
the controversial pesticide, the supervisors differed about the best way to 
intervene in the state-mandated program.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
LAND ISSUE WILL BE ON BALLOT, GROUP SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A measure to protect public parks and beaches in the city is headed for the 
November ballot, a conservation group announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Save Our Parks, which has been soliciting voter signatures for a proposed city 
charter amendment, turned in 18,661 signatures to the city clerk Monday. The 
proposal needed at least 15,302 signatures to make the ballot, City Clerk 
Connie Brockway said. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Cook, spokeswoman for Save Our Parks, said the six-month effort to 
solicit voter signatures was successful because Huntington Beach residents are 
worried about City Council proposals to sell or lease beach and park land. 
</P>
<P>
"People in the city are really mad about things like Pierside Village," said 
Cook, referring to a proposed development of restaurants on the ocean side of 
Pacific Coast Highway near the pier. 
</P>
<P>
Save Our Parks has adamantly opposed the project, saying more restaurants will 
ruin the view and block public access to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Save Our Parks effort proposes an amendment to the city charter that would 
forbid the city from selling or leasing park or beach land unless approved by 
both a majority of the seven-member City Council and a majority of city voters. 
</P>
<P>
Current law allows the city to sell or lease land by a majority vote of the 
council; no voter referendum is required. 
</P>
<P>
Brockway said the county registrar of voters office will review the signatures. 
If at least 15,302 are valid, she said, the measure automatically goes on the 
November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"This is only the second initiative in the history of our city, and the first 
one for a charter amendment," Brockway said. The first initiative to qualify in 
the city was in 1988 when voters petitioned to place a slow-growth measure on 
the ballot that year. That proposal was narrowly defeated in the election. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting this charter amendment to the ballot is only half the battle," Cook 
said. "Now we must get the support of voters so it will be passed in November."

CHRISTIAN SCHOOL MAY LEASE CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNDA NATALI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite grumblings from school district officials, the City Council is going 
ahead with plans to sublease the former Oxford Junior High School to a private 
Christian school. "Basically, everything is in its final form," said City 
Manager Darrell Essex. 
</P>
<P>
The council made one last revision to the lease at a meeting last month, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After learning that the city was thinking about leasing the school, officials 
of the Anaheim Union High School District sent a letter protesting the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some concern about leasing it to a school that competes with the 
district," said Bobbi Zane, public information officer for the district. 
Because the school district holds the lease, the city will have to obtain 
approval from district officials before the new school can open, Essex said. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the city leases the school from the district and allows the Parks 
and Recreation Department to use the facilities. The school was closed more 
than nine years ago because of declining enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
Several private groups also sublease portions of the site, but none of these 
organizations will be affected by the Christian school's coming in, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Greater Long Beach Christian school wants to move 700 students from their 
present location in Paramount in southeast Los Angeles County to Cypress. The 
Cypress location would include students in grades seven to 12 and 46 staff 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Three modular units will be added to house a weight room, band room and 
maintenance facility. If the lease is approved, the school is expected to open 
in the fall. The school district will consider the lease at its June 14 
meeting, Zane said. LYNDA NATALI

MOBILE HOME RENT ISSUE UP FOR ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unable to persuade owners of the city's three mobile home parks to agree on a 
uniform rent increase, the Laguna Beach City Council will decide tonight 
whether to lift a moratorium which has frozen rents since December. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted May 1 to accept a plan from the owners of Treasure Island 
Mobile Home Park, which would have allowed a 7% increase for one year while 
freezing rents for low-income senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The rent freeze was extended to today to allow the city staff time to seek a 
consensus with owners of the other two parks. 
</P>
<P>
However, the agreement reached with Treasure Island owners was not accepted by 
the city's two smaller parks. The owner of Thurston Mobile Home Park was 
willing to accept a 6% increase but would not allow a special allowance for 
senior citizens, while the Laguna Terrace Mobile Home Park owner agreed 
verbally to increases only slightly higher than 7%, according to City Manager 
Kenneth C. Frank. 
</P>
<P>
Connie Vlasis, treasurer of Treasure Island Residents Owners Assn., said that 
tenants already have received notices of 7% rent increases. "The people are 
really upset," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Vlasis said some mobile home owners at the other two parks are now upset with 
Treasure Island residents, who have been by far the most vocal group about 
their differences with park owners. Vlasis said her 80-year-old mother, who 
lives in Laguna Terrace, probably will have to move: "It's too expensive for 
her now." 
</P>
<P>
Frank is recommending that the council approve the agreements with Treasure 
Island and Thurston while negotiating "within the spirit of preventing 
extraordinary increases" with Laguna Terrace. Thurston residents are expected 
to receive a 6% increase in August, Frank said. LESLIE EARNEST

PEOPLE: HER DREAM: ARISE AND BE FUNNY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lynda Towle Moss figures the world is ready for her as a stand-up comedienne 
and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
"I've wanted to be a star since I was 3 years old," announced Moss, a clinical 
psychologist, academician and, wonder of wonders, a self-admitted nerd. 
</P>
<P>
Said Moss: "As a child I was one of those smarties, and the kids called me a 
nerd. Well, nerds do well in life." 
</P>
<P>
And while she has a thriving practice as a psychologist in Orange, Moss also 
wants to get on with her life as a stand-up comedienne. But she vows to 
continue her practice, no matter how successful she is as a comic. 
</P>
<P>
"I had dreams of Hollywood when I was living in (Burlington) Vermont," recounts 
Moss, who has lost weight to help get in shape for her assault on the comedy 
world. 
</P>
<P>
She said losing weight also helps in her practice. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm good on helping people with eating disorders," she boasted, although 
admitting that she really didn't want to do jokes about how fat she was. "I 
have 15 more pounds to go." 
</P>
<P>
While she has spent a good part of her life studying psychology -- she has a 
bachelor's degree, three master's degrees and two doctorates -- "Now I really 
want to be a famous comedienne," she said in an interview in her office in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
So it was time for her to do a little shtick: 
</P>
<P>
"My mother told me to marry a doctor and my father told me to become a doctor. 
I may have been the only child in all of Vermont who got a stethoscope for her 
third birthday present." 
</P>
<P>
Moss said her mother used to "parade guys home for me to look at. They were all 
medical students because we only lived a couple of blocks away from the 
University of Vermont Medical School." 
</P>
<P>
So she married Herbert A. Moss, an attorney who practices in Santa Ana.. 
</P>
<P>
"It was funny how I met my husband," said Moss, who lives in Villa Park. "I 
crashed a party with a friend and met him there, and later he said if he was 
the guy at the door protecting against party crashers, he wouldn't have let me 
in." 
</P>
<P>
Her first stage appearance some months ago, an unpaid comedy gig at the Laff 
Stop in Santa Ana, is still fresh in her mind: 
</P>
<P>
"The minute I got up on the stage, I said to myself, this is wonderful. This is 
easy. It was like an addiction. It felt good, it felt wonderful. I loved it. I 
mean, I loved it." 
</P>
<P>
She has yet to be paid as a stand-up comedienne, but Moss had comedic exposure 
when she gave the commencement address at a private college a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The students really cracked up. They couldn't sit in their seats," she said. 
"Everyone liked it except the people in charge of the school." 
</P>
<P>
She said the school now requires commencement speakers to submit their speeches 
in advance. 
</P>
<P>
"I was poking fun at the school," she said. "I remember saying people were 
ransacking homes near the college but didn't take anything from the college 
because it didn't have anything worthwhile to take." 
</P>
<P>
Moss will give a sample of her comedic skills when she gives a sort of lecture 
on "A Belly Laugh a Day . . . the Mental and Physical Benefits of Laughter" at 
7:30 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The benefit performance will be at the South Orange County YMCA Hotel for 
Women, 1411 N. Broadway, Santa Ana. Admission is $5, although there are 
"scholarships" available for those unable to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Moss doesn't divulge her age. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a different age at different times, and I'm many people at many times," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
But she is confident of success as a comedienne. 
</P>
<P>
"I have all the ingredients, and I'm Jewish." she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsuko Yasukochi Funakoshi said she realized her life's dream last week by 
receiving her associate in arts degree from Fullerton College after 48 years of 
waiting. 
</P>
<P>
She completed her graduation requirements at what was then Fullerton Junior 
College in 1941, but like many Americans of Japanese ancestry, she was forced 
into a relocation camp after the start of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"Mitsie," as she is called by friends, recently petitioned the college to 
review her transcripts of 48 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
They were accepted and last week with others in full graduation regalia, 
66-year-old Mitsie received her diploma.

MIKE PENNER: THE CITADEL STANDS TALL -- HUGO, ERRORS AND ALL

The Citadel? The Citadel? What happened to The Fullerton? 
</P>
<P>
Wichita State failed to qualify for the College World Series this season, but 
there was a shocker at Rosenblatt Stadium nonetheless. The Citadel 8, Cal State 
Fullerton 7. The Titan team that won the Big West and swept through Austin with 
aluminum bats blazing is headed home, oh-for-Omaha. Those Titans milked the 
underdog angle for all it was worth -- We have no money, please pitch us down 
the middle -- but in the end, they were undone by an opponent who looks at 
Fullerton's bare-bones budget and sees nothing but a feast. 
</P>
<P>
The Citadel recruits officers, not outfielders. It's a school where you can 
major in Major and play baseball on a weekend pass. The Citadel has all of two 
players on full baseball scholarship. It survives on football players and 
walk-ons and baseball players who Clemson and South Carolina don't want. "We 
get great people," Coach Chal Port says, "not great ballplayers." 
</P>
<P>
So this is how Port makes do. 
</P>
<P>
When his starting shortstop, Phillip Tobin, dislocates a shoulder during The 
Citadel's World Series opener against Louisiana State, Port substitutes with 
Scott Elvington. This is The Citadel equivalent of breaking glass in case of 
emergency. Before Monday, Elvington had three at-bats this season and had never 
started a college game. 
</P>
<P>
When Elvington's nerves overwhelm him -- he commits two errors and loses his 
glove chasing another grounder -- Port dials another shortstop. Chris Coker, 
Port's regular first baseman, answers and moves across the infield, which 
brings Billy Baker, Port's regular right fielder, in to play first. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Port also needs a relief pitcher. More patching, more juggling. 
Catcher Gettys Glaze takes off his gear, picks up a resin bag and walks to the 
mound. Glaze needs someone to throw to, so Port has to use his backup catcher, 
Larry Hutto. 
</P>
<P>
Hutto has a stress fracture in his right leg. 
</P>
<P>
Port knows he can't stay with this alignment for long. Glaze lasts about as 
long as Hutto does -- 3 1/3 innings -- before Port has to move again. In to 
pitch comes Hank Kraft. Back to catcher goes Glaze. And onto the trainer's 
table goes Hutto. 
</P>
<P>
The Citadel. The proud. The few. The overworked. 
</P>
<P>
"What we did today is not unusual," Port said. "We are limited in personnel. We 
move them around and hope for the best." 
</P>
<P>
More often, Port takes what he can get. Monday, his Bulldogs committed seven 
errors, yielded 15 hits, walked six Titans. . . . and still won in 12 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton couldn't believe it. "This is my worst defeat ever," said a stunned 
Phil Nevin, the Titan third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
Port merely shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
"We have these kind of games all the time," Port said. "During our 26-game 
winning streak this year, we beat George Mason and had seven errors and only 
four hits. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Things go haywire in a hurry for us. We just kind of play through the errors. 
They're part of the game for us." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to blame the Bulldogs. Most of the time, most of them are playing out 
of position. 
</P>
<P>
So blame the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton scored seven runs, but left 13 runners stranded. In one inning, the 
Titans managed two hits and had a deep fly ball dropped by The Citadel's right 
fielder, but failed to score because Mate Borgogno ran into Nevin while running 
the bases and was called out for passing the lead runner. In another inning, 
the ninth, Fullerton had the winning run at second base, but Steve Sisco and 
Paul Bunch struck out. In the 10th, the Titans left the bases loaded. And in 
the 12th, Borgogno took three called strikes with the tying run on third. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the situation we wanted, but it just didn't break for us," Fullerton 
Coach Larry Cochell complained. "In fact, we had two or three situations we 
wanted in the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing broke for the Titans on this day, except, maybe, their concentration. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this game was part of ESPN's broadcast package, so it was 
televised live into cable-ready homes across the country. Millions of Little 
Leaguers will be scarred for life. Yes, you, too, can throw to imaginary cutoff 
men and drop balls on the warning track and let foul pops land untouched and 
still win in the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
The secret of The Citadel, according to Port, the Bulldogs' 26-year head coach, 
is a willingness to lose. "We can lose to anybody," Port says, proudly. "We're 
not afraid to lose. That's why we play loose." 
</P>
<P>
And, the Bulldogs realize, there are worse things to lose than a baseball game. 
Last year, the Bulldogs almost lost their city. Charleston had a horrible home 
stand against Hurricane Hugo in 1989, losing buildings and power lines and the 
stadium where The Citadel plays its home baseball games. 
</P>
<P>
"The lights, the fence, the grandstands, the press box, the batting cage -- all 
gone, all destroyed," Port says. "The field had to be completely restored. And 
they were still working on it when we started playing this season. We had guys 
still working on the field during our first few home games. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the reason our attendance was so high. We counted the workers." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the ballpark wasn't the only thing restored at The Citadel. The 
Bulldogs reached their first College World Series by beating Miami twice in the 
regionals -- in Florida, no less -- and now have their first College World 
Series victory, having weathered a different kind of storm. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that was a great game," Port exclaimed. "I'm not saying it was great 
baseball, but, my God, that was exciting." 
</P>
<P>
And that, in a bombshell, is the College World Series. Strange things happen 
here. Strange teams win here. The Citadel stays. Fullerton goes. 
</P>
<P>
More than one can play the woe-is-me game. Someone now even plays it better 
than the Titans.

TITANS ELIMINATED AFTER EARLY LEAD;

COLLEGE WORLD : FULLERTON DOESN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ITS CHANCES AND LOSES TO 
THE CITADEL, 8-7, IN 12 INNINGS.

<P>
The Cal State Fullerton baseball team that swept through the NCAA Central 
regional at Austin, Tex., must have missed a connecting flight to Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans were in Rosenblatt Stadium and on ESPN Monday, but they didn't 
appear to be the same team. The Fullerton team that lost to The Citadel, 8-7, 
in 12 innings and made a quick exit from the College World Series bore little 
resemblance to the team that beat Texas twice on the Longhorns' field to earn 
the trip to Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
Gone was the consistent, effective pitching, the clutch hitting, the solid 
defense and the killer instinct that helped the Titans get ahead of their 
regional opponents and stay ahead of them. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (36-23) spent much of Monday afternoon watching scoring opportunities 
pass them by, and the game and season ended with Mate Borgogno, the team's 
leader in runs batted in, watching three consecutive fastballs from Hank Kraft 
hit the outside corner with the potential tying run on third base. 
</P>
<P>
When Borgogno was called out on strikes to end the game, it brought an end to 3 
1/2 hours of frustration for the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs of Charleston, S.C., it seemed, did everything they could to give 
Fullerton the game. They committed seven errors to help Fullerton score three 
unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
But the Titans, who had 15 hits, failed to capitalize on many other 
opportunities and left 13 men on base. 
</P>
<P>
"It's better to be lucky than good," The Citadel Coach Chal Port said. "That 
was true in this game." 
</P>
<P>
After scoring twice in the third, the Titans had runners on first and second 
with one out and couldn't score again. They had runners on first and second 
with none out in the fifth and didn't score. 
</P>
<P>
They had runners on first and second with one out in the ninth and failed to 
score. After scoring once to tie the score, 7-7, in the bottom of the 10th, 
Fullerton couldn't score after loading the bases with one out. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, which committed one error in four regional games, made a 
seventh-inning error that led to a run for The Citadel. And the Titans' 
pitching broke down in the late innings, as starter Huck Flener and reliever 
Chris Robinson combined to allow seven runs in the last six innings, and 
Fullerton blew a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We had so many opportunities to win the game, it wasn't funny," said Coach 
Larry Cochell of Fullerton, which lost to Oklahoma State, 14-4, in its series 
opener. "We just didn't get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
Bulldog shortstop Phillip Tobin was out with a dislocated shoulder and his 
replacement, Scott Elvington, made two errors, one in the third that paved the 
way for two Fullerton runs. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs (46-13) made two more errors in the sixth, including second 
baseman Dan McDonnell's overthrow of first that allowed Kevin Farlow to score 
and give the Titans a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
After The Citadel scored two runs in the seventh and three in the eighth to 
take a 6-4 lead, the Bulldogs gave Fullerton two more runs in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
With Paul Bunch on third and Dave Ayala on first, Ayala broke for second. 
Catcher Larry Hutto threw to second, but McDonnell forgot to cover the bag. The 
throw went into center field, allowing Bunch to score and Ayala to take third. 
Domingo Mota singled Ayala home to tie the score, 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
The Citadel went ahead, 7-6, on Tony Skole's RBI single to right field, but the 
Titans came back in the bottom of the 10th to tie it. 
</P>
<P>
Farlow, who had three hits, led off with a single, took second on Tom Manley's 
sacrifice and reached third on Mota's infield hit. Phil Nevin singled to score 
Farlow. Mota reached third ahead of Anthony Jenkins' throw, and Nevin took 
second on the play. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft replaced Gettys Glaze, who started the game at catcher, and walked 
Borgogno intentionally, struck out Matt Hattabaugh and got Charles to hit into 
a force play. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins, who had three hits and scored three runs, started the Bulldogs' 
winning rally in the 12th by singling and advancing to second on a one-out wild 
pitch. Billy Baker, who had two hits and two RBIs, was walked intentionally but 
Skole lined a single to give The Citadel an 8-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Manley, a 10th-inning replacement for Fullerton, started the 12th with a bunt 
single but was forced at second on Mota's attempted sacrifice. But Mota took 
second when Coker, who moved from first to shortstop in the seventh, threw the 
relay past first. 
</P>
<P>
Mota took third on Nevin's groundout but was stranded when Borgogno struck out. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma State 7, Louisiana State 1 -- Freshman right-hander Brad Gore allowed 
only two hits in 7 1/3 innings and struck out six to lead the Cowboys past the 
Tigers in a winners bracket game. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Daniel had two hits, including a three-run homer in the seventh, and 
Neil Szeryk and Bobby Carlsen each had two hits for Oklahoma State (55-16). 
Lyle Mouton homered for LSU (53-18). 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma State and Georgia are the tournament's only undefeated teams. Oklahoma 
State will play on Thursday against the winner of tonight's LSU-The Citadel 
elimination game. The Cowboys need one victory to reach Saturday's title game.

CHANG MEETS AGASSI A THIRD TIME IN FRENCH OPEN QUARTERFINAL

When Michael Chang moves on to Center Court of Roland Garros Stadium this 
morning to meet third-seeded Andre Agassi in the quarterfinals of the French 
Open, the 18-year-old from Placentia will find himself in the familiar role of 
a decided underdog to his older opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, the 11th seed and defending French Open champion, has met 20-year-old 
Agassi twice since the former turned pro in April, 1988, and has yet to win a 
set against him. 
</P>
<P>
Their first meeting came in May, 1988, in the Tournament of Champions. As an 
18-year-old, fifth-seeded Agassi won the first set, 6-2, on the clay at the 
West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, N.Y., before rain interrupted play. 
Because of a downpour the next day, the match was moved indoors to the 
hard-surfaced Port Washington Tennis Academy, where Agassi finished off Chang, 
6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Four months later, an unseeded Chang met Agassi, by then ranked fourth in the 
world, in the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open at the National Tennis Center in 
Flushing Meadow, N.Y. The flashy Agassi made quick work of his outmatched 
opponent, 7-5, 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
The French Open quarterfinal match between Chang and Agassi today will be 
televised live on ESPN, with tournament coverage beginning at 6 a.m.

Hughes Aircraft Co. has confirmed that it is not planning to acquire a major 
defense contractor, ending speculation that the company might bid for all of 
Ford Aerospace's Aeroneutronic Division in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes spokesman Richard Doree on Monday confirmed a published statement by 
Hughes Chairman Malcom R. Currie that, given the current uncertainty of the 
defense budget, the company is not interested in buying another big defense 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
However, Currie left open the possibility that Hughes might bid on parts of the 
division if it is parceled out to bidders. Ford Motor Co. put the division up 
for sale in January.

UVA BLOCKER FINDS A PLACE IN THE SUN; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETING: HERBERT LABORATORIES' PHOTOPLEX IS SOLD OVER THE COUNTER -- AND IT'S 
DOING BETTER THAN THE COMPANY'S NEW PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS. 
</P>

<P>
In planning a new business course, Herbert Laboratories decided in the early 
1980s that it would make its mark by developing prescription drugs to treat 
skin diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert, the smallest division of Irvine-based Allergan Inc., sold or swapped 
all of its non-prescription preparations to other firms. Among the discarded 
products was a sunscreen called Eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Labs President Tom Bender says the company wanted nothing more to do 
with "lotions and potions," his nickname for over-the-counter drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The subsidiary is still dedicated to the prescription market. But now Herbert 
has another over-the-counter potion on its hands -- a sunscreen that so far has 
outpaced sales of its new prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The product is Photoplex, and it is the only sunscreen sold in this country to 
have U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to claim that it provides 
significant protection against ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation. 
</P>
<P>
UVA was once considered a harmless part of the light spectrum, but it is now 
believed to play a significant role in causing skin damage. Photoplex, like 
other sunscreens, also combats UVB radiation, which can cause burning, 
premature aging and skin cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The sunscreen market into which Herbert Labs has reluctantly stepped is 
intensely competitive, filled with a wide array of products that beckon 
shoppers not with the promise of a stunning tan but with a chemical shade to 
prevent burning and worse. 
</P>
<P>
Since making its market debut in December, 1988, Photoplex has quickly become a 
formidable contender among sunscreens, despite little advertising and a high 
retail price -- about $8.50 for a four-ounce bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert will not divulge sales figures for Photoplex. But results of a recent 
national survey by American Druggist, a trade magazine, show that it is the 
sunscreen that pharmacists at chain drugstores recommend most often. When the 
opinions of pharmacists at independent drugstores were also included, however, 
Photoplex slid to third place. 
</P>
<P>
But there may be trouble ahead. This season, Photoplex is for the first time 
being sold away from the druggist's counter, on shelves with other sunscreens, 
some of which also claim to offer "broad spectrum" protection. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Killey, vice president of clinical affairs at Herbert Labs, said 
Photoplex was developed to be a prescription drug that dermatologists would 
prescribe for patients with light-activated skin diseases or who were on other 
medications that made them ultrasensitive to sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
The product was formulated with Parsol 1789, a UVA-absorbing chemical made by 
the Swiss Givaudan Corp. that was already being used in some European 
sunscreens. Because Parsol 1789 was not on the FDA list of approved sunscreen 
ingredients, Herbert Labs had to take it through the agency's lengthy 
new-drug-application process. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, research laboratories produced more evidence that UVA, in 
concert with UVB, probably contributes to skin cancer and premature aging of 
the skin -- the two problems that worry the general public. 
</P>
<P>
Killey said the FDA approved the product for sale over the counter -- rather 
than having it be limited it to prescription sales -- because the product poses 
no safety problem and because there is a need for a product available to the 
public that has been proven to absorb UVA rays. To the company, however, Killey 
said, that decision was "disappointing because it meant we would have to do 
things differently to make this a success." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other sunscreen and suntanning lotion makers such as Schering-Plough -- 
which produces Coppertone -- Herbert did not have a large enough sales force or 
advertising budget to wage a consumer marketing blitz. The company decided 
instead to sell Photoplex principally behind the pharmacy counter, as if it was 
a prescription drug. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert sales people concentrated on telling dermatologists and pharmacists the 
scientific story of the product, in hope that they would recommend it to their 
patients and customers. The company also launched an aggressive public 
relations campaign to tell the public about the dangers of UVA exposure. 
</P>
<P>
To set Photoplex apart from other sun products, the company describes it as a 
"therapeutic drug" and moisturizer that should be used daily year-round. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign did win attention: Photoplex has been written about in numerous 
national women's magazines and discussed on radio and television talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Manabe, director of professional services for Fedco Pharmacies, recalled 
that after Photoplex was plugged in fashion magazines, "people were coming in 
and asking for it." 
</P>
<P>
Herbert has recognized that it could have been losing sales by keeping 
Photoplex behind the pharmacy counter. So this year, the company began pressing 
pharmacists to display Photoplex on top of their counters and urging drugstores 
to place it in their seasonal sunscreen displays. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, Photoplex wasn't even in our sun-care program," said Malcolm 
Proudfoot, toiletries buyer for American Drug Stores Inc., which operates the 
Sav-On and Osco Drugs chains. But in the first half of this year, Photoplex 
ranked in the top half in sales of suntanning and screening items stocked by 
stores in his organization. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Herbert is concerned that it may have a hard time competing because the 
labels for other companies' products have begun claiming that they too provide 
UVA protection. 
</P>
<P>
Those companies' claims have attracted the interest of the FDA as well as the 
ire of Herbert Labs, which argues that those companies' claims are misleading 
and confusing to the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA recently sent letters to several sunscreen manufacturers to advise them 
that they may not claim that their products protect against UVA until the 
agency adopts a standardized test for the effectiveness of existing 
over-the-counter sunscreen ingredients against UVA. FDA officials acknowledge 
that some ingredients in other sunscreens do absorb some UVA, but they say 
their degree of effectiveness is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Until it is clear, the FDA says, the only way a manufacturer can properly make 
UVA protection claims for its product is to take it through the same expensive 
and time-consuming new drug application procedure that Herbert did with 
Photoplex. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody else who makes claims is doing so at their own risk. They risk 
regulatory action," said Jeanne Rippere, a microbiologist in charge of 
sunscreens for the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
As the UVA controversy has heated up, Herbert officials have tried to keep 
their cool. "We are not getting caught up in this consumer game. We are not 
going to get out and shout and scream with everybody," Bender said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Photoplex so far has not generated enough sales to recoup the cost of 
its development. Usually that process takes about five years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is too early to tell when we will get a pay-back on this," he said. "There 
is so much controversy in the marketplace today on the UVA claim that I think 
we will just have to wait and see."

HIRING PLANS TO SLOW A BIT, SURVEY SHOWS

<P>
Orange County employers are gearing up for a productive but not spectacular 
summer season and are adjusting their hiring goals accordingly, according to a 
new survey by Manpower Inc. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 22% of the county's employers expect to add to their payrolls 
during the summer months, with 7% anticipating layoffs or payroll reductions 
through attrition, the employment firm found. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, 25% said they intended to add staff while 8% predicted cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Manpower, which specializes in placing temporary hourly workers, surveys about 
1,500 employers nationally each quarter to gauge national and regional hiring 
outlooks. The most recent survey covers hiring for July, August and September. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also deals with hourly employment, generally in clerical, office, 
and assembly or manufacturing positions. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Foigelman, area manager for Manpower's Irvine-based Orange County 
operations, said Monday that the results of the local portion of the survey 
show a slight slowing of job growth as county employers echo the national trend 
of cautious concern about the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she said, the survey results don't point to a downturn. The number of 
firms hiring or maintaining the status quo far outweighs the number expecting 
to cut back. 
</P>
<P>
Manpower does not break down local hiring trends by job category, as it does 
nationally, but Foigelman said the local results show that manufacturing, 
education, services and public administration are areas with the strongest 
potential for job hunters. 
</P>
<P>
She said job opportunities in construction are expected to slow a bit, largely 
because builders have slowed new development activity in the wake of a sales 
slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
Foigelman said that while the requests for temporary workers that her office 
handles don't always mirror the demand for permanent employees, she has noticed 
a sharp increase in recent months in demand for clerical workers with computer 
skills, especially those familiar with major word-processing software programs. 
</P>
<P>
"There is also a great demand for (temporary) receptionists," she said. 
</P>
<P>
That, she said, means there is a marked shortage of receptionists and 
word-processing specialists in the permanent job market. 
</P>
<P>
"I have also noticed that in the past six months, there is almost no demand for 
anyone without some level of computer knowledge," Foigelman added. "Almost 
every job request we get requires some computer knowledge, even in 
manufacturing, warehousing and assembly-type jobs." O.C. JOB MARKET

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: GENATRON ACQUIRES 60% OF START-UP IN STOCK SWAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fullerton-based Genatron Inc., a start-up company that is developing a line of 
pollution-free motors and generators, has acquired 60% of another fledgling 
company, Clean Air Resins Inc. of Santa Ana, in a stock swap. The value of the 
deal, which gives Genatron a two-year option on the remaining 40% of Clean Air 
Resins shares, was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Clean Air Resins has developed a line of water-based resins for use in paints, 
gels, synthetic foam, coatings and other products. New clean-air rules, 
especially in Southern California, are expected to stimulate the development of 
a market for such products as a replacement for smog-causing oil-based resins. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Marzicola, vice president of Genatron, said the deal is expected to close 
within 30 days. He said that Clean Air Resins is currently negotiating an 
agreement with a subcontractor to manufacture the products and that Genatron 
needs additional financing to begin building its engines.

SCR IN SINGAPORE;

<P>
FESTIVAL RAISES ISSUE OF EAST-WEST ETHNIC FOCUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As warmly as South Coast Repertory has been received here for its vibrant 
production of George Bernard Shaw's "You Never Can Tell," the contemporary 
Japanese dance company Sankai Juko made a bigger splash over the weekend at the 
opening of the Singapore Festival of Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The most obvious reason was that festival officials had promoted the five-man 
dance troupe as "erotic" and "shocking" -- sensationalist hype picked up and 
flogged in the local press. 
</P>
<P>
This was bound to stir avid curiosity, particularly in a society seemingly bent 
on achieving moral purity along with economic might: All sex is edited out of 
movies here. Playboy and similar magazines are not allowed into the country. 
Videotapes, including those brought in by tourists, must be screened by 
customs. Recently, two teen-agers came under intense public scrutiny for 
kissing on a bus, an open intimacy frowned on even by the young. 
</P>
<P>
"We must keep up the standards," said Aquila Moses, a genial Singaporean who 
can't be more than 20 years old. "They were not married." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all theatrical productions -- amateur or professional -- must be 
licensed by a government censor. Yet festival officials are also government 
officials. And so the paradox of the government promoting Sankai Juko as 
something forbidden served only to heighten the curiosity about its two 
performances at the 1,744-seat Kallang Theatre, one of the six main venues of 
the monthlong festival. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the dance cognoscenti were primed for Sankai Juko by the fact that 
it has toured the world many times -- the troupe was last seen in Los Angeles 
during the 1984 Olympics -- but had never been to the Asian Pacific outside of 
Japan, Australia and New Zealand. The appearance was, therefore, long awaited. 
By contrast, nobody had heard of SCR. Before coming here, it had never toured 
beyond California. 
</P>
<P>
Further, butoh dancing as performed by Sankai Juko can be stunning, and the 
piece it presented -- "Unetso," which premiered in Paris in 1986 -- did not 
disappoint. For 90 minutes without intermission, the dancers put on a 
ritualistic sand-and-water show about birth and death that was visually 
spectacular, musically entrancing and conceptually profound. Nothing about it, 
however, was remotely erotic or shocking. 
</P>
<P>
The less obvious but perhaps more significant underlying reason for the intense 
interest in Sankai Juko had to do with regional cultural relevance and the 
question of whether the influence of Eurocentric culture in particular should 
be embraced whole, assimilated and transformed, or simply rejected. It is an 
issue that the whole arts festival of several hundred acts is grappling with, 
not always successfully. 
</P>
<P>
In one respect, butoh embodies European influences without for a moment 
resembling anything Western. Sankai Juko is based in Paris -- its completely 
Japanese flavor notwithstanding -- and its works are a derivation of everything 
from Kabuki and Noh theater forms to German Expressionism, environmental 
activism and performance art. 
</P>
<P>
The successful amalgamation of such various artistic strains makes considerable 
sense for Singapore's multiracial, multicultural, multilingual mix of Chinese, 
Malays, Indians and Caucasians. Shaw, on the other hand, would seem to require 
a strictly Eurocentric focus both from its audience and its players. 
</P>
<P>
That, at least, was an issue raised by Wong Chek Hooi, a student at the 
National University of Singapore who attended an SCR workshop Saturday on 
producing "You Never Can Tell" and other Shaw plays. The workshop, attended by 
two dozen members of the Singaporean theater community, was led by SCR's 
producing artistic director David Emmes, artistic director Martin Benson, 
costume designer Shigeru Yaji and scenic designer Cliff Faulkner. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hooi did not use the label Eurocentrism, it very definitely applied. 
</P>
<P>
"I think one of the greatest difficulties in the local context of Asian actors 
is interpreting this traditional play," he noted. "For example, the costumes 
reflect a strong (British) cultural background. I can't imagine an Asian actor 
wearing Victorian costumes without the audience laughing. 
</P>
<P>
"If we really want to integrate G.B. Shaw into the local context, what is the 
best way possible?" Hooi asked. "What things can we do to bring him across 
without looking ridiculous? Even the Asian facial structure is different (from 
Caucasians'). Nobody would believe us." 
</P>
<P>
The SCR panelists gave a wide range of answers, citing the move toward 
color-blind casting in the United States as well as successful adaptation of 
Western dramatic material for Eastern consumption, such as some of Akira 
Kurosawa's movies. But it was Faulkner who waxed most eloquent. 
</P>
<P>
"One way to answer the question is to look at both extremes," Faulkner said. 
"You can do Shaw absolutely authentic to the period, with every last detail, 
and ignore the discrepancies you are talking about. Or you can ask yourself 
what makes Shaw exciting for an Asian company? 
</P>
<P>
"Does the particular play have values and issues that pertain to the Asian 
cultural experience? I'm certain Shaw has resonances. One way to make a 
production exciting would be to find design elements from an Asian background, 
and put those on stage -- either entirely within an Asian design scheme or 
mixing Eastern and Western together. 
</P>
<P>
"You can show visually that the play relates to your culture, and to more than 
one culture. I think the discrepancies you mention should never be seen as a 
hindrance, but rather as a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
However, when the festival itself has tried to meet that challenge, it has made 
some peculiar choices. For instance, the Repertory Philippines has been invited 
to do Robert Harling's "Steel Magnolias" as a main event in what is called the 
Core program, while W.S. Rendra, Indonesia's leading playwright and a literary 
figure of world stature, has been shunted off to the Fringe festival without a 
production, although he did lecture. 
</P>
<P>
The festival has little artistic cohesion and almost no daring vision. It is, 
for the most part, a safe festival. At the same time, festival officials 
deserve credit for bringing the South African exiled dancers, the Amandla 
Cultural Ensemble, to the Fringe. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Fringe as a whole is probably more interesting than the Core and a 
lot like the remarkably eclectic shopping here: If you know what you're looking 
for, it's a bargain hunter's paradise. But you have to be able to spot the 
genuine article.

DEL MAR FAIR CONCERTS GOING VIDEO THIS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The popular Del Mar Fair grandstand concerts have finally entered the Video 
Age. 
</P>
<P>
This year's series of 20 evening pop concerts, starting June 15 with a 
performance by the Little River Band, will also be broadcast live on a 20-foot 
video screen in the newly erected Infield Stage, across the race track from the 
grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if the 15,000-seat grandstand fills up for a show, concert-goers who get 
turned away at the door no longer will have to miss out on the action. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we had several concerts that sold out," said fair spokeswoman Diane 
Scholfield. "We couldn't fit any more people in the grandstand, and we had to 
turn people away. It was really too bad: We felt as bad as the people who got 
turned away. 
</P>
<P>
"So this year, we've arranged for a second stage in the infield of the race 
track, where at night, a few thousand more people can see and hear the 
grandstand concert on a video screen." 
</P>
<P>
The complete lineup of grandstand performers in the 1990 series is the usual 
grab-bag of pop, rock, soul, country, and jazz acts: the Little River Band, 
June 15; Tom Jones, June 16; the Charlie Daniels Band, June 17; Lisa Lisa and 
Cult Jam, June 18; the Robert Cray Band, June 19; Donny Osmond, June 20; Dionne 
Warwick, June 21; Expose, June 22; Johnny Rivers, June 23; Poco, June 24; and 
Kool and the Gang, June 25. 
</P>
<P>
Also on tap: Willie Nelson, June 26; the Band, June 27; Gordon Lightfoot, June 
28; Laura Branigan, June 29; John Kay and Steppenwolf, June 30; Air Supply, 
July 1; Natalie Cole, July 2; the Gap Band, July 3; and the Oak Ridge Boys, 
July 4 (the fair's closing night). 
</P>
<P>
In addition to these 20 evening shows, which start at 7:30 p.m., there will be 
two afternoon concerts starting at 2 p.m.: the Harry James Orchestra, June 21, 
and Carmen McRae, June 28. 
</P>
<P>
"We always try to get a wide variety of entertainment," Scholfield said. "The 
fair is for people of all ages, with all sorts of different musical tastes. And 
we have to take that into account when deciding on which acts to book: We try 
to get a little something for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Also as usual, there's a heavy emphasis on nostalgia, with no fewer than eight 
oldies acts in the lineup-including such 1960s hit machines as Jones, Warwick, 
Rivers, the Band, and Steppenwolf. 
</P>
<P>
"People are really into nostalgia," Scholfield said, "and these artists 
certainly bring back a lot of old memories. But at the same time, many of them 
are recording new stuff instead of merely living off oldies, thus broadening 
their appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"To give you an example, Tom Jones, who was Mr. '60s, recently recorded a cover 
of Prince's 'Kiss' (with Art of Noise) and it was a big hit. So now, a second 
generation is discovering his music from earlier times and liking it, and we'll 
probably get a cross-generational crowd for his show-and for shows by other 
so-called oldies acts like him." 
</P>
<P>
While the Infield Stage will broadcast grandstand concerts at night, during the 
day, it will host a separate series of afternoon concerts. 
</P>
<P>
The lineup: local classic-rockers Dr. Feelgood and the Interns of Love, 2 and 5 
p.m., June 15; 1960s singles band the Guess Who, 2 and 5 p.m., June 16 and 17; 
rhythm-and-blues group the Dynatones, 2 p.m., June 18-20; country singer Mel 
McDaniel, 2 and 5 p.m., June 22-24; country singer Claudia Nyggard, 2 p.m., 
June 25-27; "Animal House" frat-rockers Otis Day and the Knights, 2 and 5 p.m., 
June 29-July 1; and rhythm-and-blues band Jack Mack and the Heart Attack, 2 
p.m., July 2-4.

'OLD DOG' IS READY TO TROT OUT SOME NEW DANCE TRICKS

In the late 1950s, Ellen Segal performed principal roles with the prestigious 
Martha Graham Dance Company, and her mentor's modern dance technique is still 
the backbone of Segal's quirky choreography. 
</P>
<P>
But, as the 56-year-old dance maker boasted during a break from rehearsal, 
"This old dog is starting to learn new tricks. I decided my work isn't really 
rhythmic, so I took lessons from percussionist Will Parsons to get a handle on 
the batucada rhythms (of Brazil)," she said. "I fell in love with the energetic 
and sensual qualities of the music and got really stimulated." 
</P>
<P>
Those intoxicating rhythms of Brazilian ethnic music inspired Segal to 
integrate a new set of moves and spatial patterns into her dancing. But the 
complex, 13-section suite, "Brazilian Explosion," is not just about movement. 
It features four sections of pure percussive music and three sections of song. 
</P>
<P>
This ambitious work will be the centerpiece of Segal's latest "Garage Dance" 
concert, slated for 8:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at Three's Company's 
Hillcrest studio. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it's risky," Segal acknowledged, "but I was really very clear about 
what I wanted to do. I'm going to try new things in this concert. I'm 
addressing serious themes, and working with live musicians. It was a risk I 
wanted to take. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a jazz fan all my life -- since I was a little girl," she recalled. 
"The mixture of jazz and the bossa nova that was popular in the '50s is now 
coming back, and it's an exciting combination. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether I'll be successful with it. You never do until you try. 
You just keep making work and hoping that the quality and the passion will be 
strong. That's what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
This set of "Garage Dance" -- the third in the series named for its spawning 
ground -- will showcase some of Segal's closest collaborators (choreographers 
Erling Sunde and Patricia Sandback). 
</P>
<P>
But it will also bring some new blood into the fold, most notably percussionist 
Omar Ernest Moore, whose ethnic drum solo will ignite the "Brazilian 
Explosion," and lyric soprano Ellen Lawson. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking about maybe changing the title of this concert, but my studio 
is still in the garage, and I'm still developing dances there," Segal 
explained. "This time it's exciting. I have live music, and Omar's Brazilian 
piece is wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Segal was timid about recruiting Lawson for the project but, after hearing the 
singer's rendition of a Portuguese lullaby last fall, she decided to give it 
her best shot. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know if she would even consider singing with a dance work, but I just 
decided, why not? When I told her it was Brazilian music, she was delighted. 
</P>
<P>
"Brazilian Explosion" is only one of six new works to be premiered at Three's 
Company's Studio this weekend. The most serious dance on the program is a 
tribute to fellow Graham soloist Tim Wengerd -- Segal's kindred spirit -- who 
lost a battle with AIDS last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Tim is with me all the time," said Segal. "We never worked together at the 
Graham company. He wasn't even dancing yet by the time I left, but there's a 
certain bond that comes between Graham people. We're very connected." 
</P>
<P>
Although Segal's cockeyed sense of humor has a way of creeping into almost 
everything she creates, "Timness" is a highly emotional odyssey for the 
choreographer. And, since Wengerd was a vital part of the San Diego dance scene 
(he taught summer workshops and gave performances here many times over the 
years), this elegy may have a similar effect on the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no fooling around," Segal pointed out. "I'm dancing this piece, and 
I'm skinning myself alive to come anywhere near his power. Tim's dancing 
knocked us out. You can't fake that. 
</P>
<P>
"But all my choreography -- even the serious stuff -- is a little funny or 
sardonic. When you're 56, you look at things differently. It's at least more 
philosophical." 
</P>
<P>
Sunde, whose classical dance credits hark back to the renowned Royal Ballet, 
will contribute the most balletic dance of the evening. Titled "Enigma," the 
trio reveals another side of Graham-trained Segal, who joins two dancers many 
years her junior in the piece. 
</P>
<P>
Like most unaffiliated dance makers, Segal is not a stranger to low-tech 
environments. But her weekend stint at Three's Company's studio is a first for 
this San Diego-based iconoclast. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I needed a change of venue, and Three's Company has just fixed up the 
studio," Segal said. "The grant I received from the dance alliance helped make 
it possible. This concert represents a new adventure for me, and I'm very 
excited."

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC: UCSD GOSPEL CHOIR COURSE DRAWS RECORD 362 
STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ken Anderson, director of UC San Diego's Gospel Choir, must be doing something 
right. Under his direction, this popular university course has doubled its 
enrollment to 362 members, a number very few rooms on the UCSD campus can 
accommodate. This is Anderson's first year as the choir's director, but for the 
previous six years he was the group's piano accompanist. 
</P>
<P>
"Each quarter, the enrollment kept growing," said Anderson. "Then, this last 
quarter, we started with 258 students pre-registered, and on the first night 
they just kept 
</P>
<P>
coming through the door until we were almost at 370. Only Mandeville Auditorium 
and the ballroom of the Price Student Center are big enough for us." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's charges will sing their annual concert of spirituals and 
contemporary Gospel music tonight at 8 p.m. in Mandeville Auditorium. Unlike 
most choral groups, the Gospel Choir learns most of its music by rote. 
</P>
<P>
"For the Gospel music, I sing every line to each section to teach them the 
piece. Of course, most of the old spirituals have been arranged by various 
composers, so we use printed music for them." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson added that he often has to compose his own bass lines for the Gospel 
music he hears on recordings because the traditional Gospel sound only includes 
soprano, alto, and tenor voices. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who also teaches elementary school music in San Diego and National 
City, first encountered Gospel music at the age of 6 in church, where he 
accompanied choirs on the piano. By age 14 he had become minister of music at 
the Mt. Olive Church of God in Christ in East San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
His UCSD choir encompasses a mix of racial and ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's a place on the planet that is not represented by someone 
in the choir." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson attributes the choir's popularity to the drawing power of the music. 
</P>
<P>
"I think many find the music more alive. Compared to other choral music it has 
a modern sound, which is an advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson appreciates the enthusiasm of his UCSD students, although many are 
encountering the tradition of Gospel music for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"Compared to a Gospel choir made up of singers who know the style, the only 
difference is in the sound. A traditional church choir of singers who have 
grown up in the tradition have twice the power of the UCSD group." 
</P>
<P>
Edging out the classics. When classical music listeners tuned in KPBS-FM (89.5) 
Monday, they discovered a significant decrease in classical music programming 
on the local public radio station. KPBS-FM has decided to reduce its previous 
six-hour midday music segment to a mere four hours, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to do what public radio does best," explained program director Michael 
Flaster, "and that's not playing music from discs." 
</P>
<P>
After KPBS-FM changed to its midday classical music format in October, 1986, 
the station enjoyed a significant boost in its ratings during that time slot. 
It has not been great enough, however, to satisfy the station's management. 
Flaster noted that their strongest audience response is to news shows such as 
"Morning Edition" and the evening "All Things Considered" as well as to the 
syndicated daily interview program "Fresh Air." 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with these highly verbal programs, the playing of classical 
recordings on KPBS-FM will gradually give way to interviews with local 
musicians and visiting performers conducted by the station's current classical 
music disc jockeys Dan Erwine and Dave Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to keep our 'Morning Edition' listeners with this new format," said 
Flaster, "because that is the way people use radio. People watch specific 
television programs, but radio is different -- it's format. They turn to a 
radio station if they want a certain type of programming , although television 
is moving in this direction with the all-news CNN and the all-sports ESPN 
channels." 
</P>
<P>
The station will also broadcast live concerts, something not done by other 
local stations. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to present that which isn't available elsewhere," he added, "although 
I think we need to have a musical presence on the air. Overall, I'm looking for 
a good balance." 
</P>
<P>
Supertitles win again. San Diego Opera sent a short questionnaire to all of its 
subscribers last week asking whether the company should provide supertitles 
(which this company calls "OperaText") for two English-language operas in the 
upcoming season. The result, according to opera spokeswoman Brenda Hughes, was 
a landslide 93% in favor of having the supertitles for Benjamin Britten's comic 
opera "Albert Herring" and Carlisle Floyd's newly revised grand opera "The 
Passion of Jonathan Wade." 
</P>
<P>
Since the introduction of OperaText to San Diego Opera productions in 1984, 
these simultaneous translations of the foreign language librettos have been 
well-received by opera patrons, although some critics passionately despise 
them. Most American opera companies use them to some extent, although New York 
City's staid Metropolitan Opera staunchly refuses to accommodate this modern 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 4,200 questionnaires sent, nearly half have been returned, an unusually 
high percentage for any survey. Many opera subscribers commented that English 
is a difficult language to understand when sung, especially in a 3,000-seat 
hall such as Civic Theatre. One response surprised even the opera staff: an 
opera subscriber explained that OperaText meant a lot to her because she was 
hard of hearing.

STEEL ANTI-DRUG BARRIERS SET UP

<TEXT>
<P>
Using money from apartment owners in a formerly drug-infested Sepulveda 
neighborhood, authorities today began replacing sawhorse barricades on streets 
in the 12-block area with permanent steel barriers. 
</P>
<P>
The barriers, which are implanted in the street, replace the barricades that 
were installed by the city in November to help keep drive-through drug-buyers 
out of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The barricaded area stretches south along Columbus Avenue from Nordhoff Street, 
and the barriers leave only one entrance to the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Capt. Mark Stevens said drug-dealing in the area has dropped 
dramatically since the neighborhood was barricaded. He said the police continue 
to run undercover operations there because customers continue to come to the 
area to buy drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The four steel barriers, which can be opened for emergency vehicles, cost 
$6,500 and were paid for by owners of the many apartment buildings in the 
neighborhood. The city will pay the cost of maintaining them. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Joel Wachs said the barriers eventually could be removed if the 
neighborhood improves to the point that drug-dealing will not return.

SOVIETS VOW TO CUT EUROPEAN ARMS;

<P>
U.S. EXPRESSES CAUTION OVER PLAN TO TRIM 1,500 WARHEADS

The Soviet Union said today it plans to withdraw 1,500 nuclear warheads and 
other tactical short-range nuclear weapons from Central Europe by the end of 
the year, but the United States expressed caution about the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who made the announcement, said 
later that "a very small amount, relatively," of Soviet battlefield nuclear 
weapons will remain in Europe after the withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a very substantive amount," said Shevardnadze, in 
Copenhagen for a 35-nation human rights conference. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, also at the conference, was 
cautious in his assessment of the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still in the process of taking a look at it, analyzing it," Baker said. 
He said the extent of the withdrawal is not clear, nor is whether the Soviets 
would destroy or simply remove the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Baker said, it was not clear whether the arms Shevardnadze spoke about 
would have been withdrawn in any event with the Soviet troops being pulled out 
of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze and Baker are meeting during the human rights conference to push 
ahead with issues discussed during the Washington summit between Soviet leader 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
A central issue is the military future of a united Germany. Europe and the 
United States want Germany as part of NATO, but the Soviet Union has balked at 
that idea. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the conference, Shevardnadze said a compromise could be found in 
Soviet differences with Washington over Germany. He said that the Soviet-led 
Warsaw Pact would begin a "transformation" at its next meeting and that NATO 
should do the same. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the way, as we underlined in the past, that we can find a compromise 
on the German issue," Shevardnadze said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker planned to assure Shevardnadze at a meeting tonight that the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization would undertake a review of its mission in light 
of easing East-West tensions.

Dr. Erich Foretich today denied a report that he is giving up the international 
custody battle for his 7-year-old daughter, Hilary, now living in New Zealand 
where she was secreted by her maternal grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
Foretich, in an interview published in New Zealand's Christchurch Star, was 
quoted as saying he was forced to accept that Hilary would live in New Zealand 
with her grandparents and Foretich's former wife, Dr. Elizabeth Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
The dental surgeon also was quoted as saying he would not pursue the custody 
case unless he had evidence that Hilary was in physical danger. 
</P>
<P>
The case has been before the New Zealand courts since Hilary was discovered 
living there in February. 
</P>
<P>
"While I continue to believe that protracted litigation is not in the best 
interest of my daughter, I continue to oppose Dr. Morgan's application for 
custody in New Zealand," Foretich said in a statement released through his U.S. 
attorney, Elaine Mittleman.

MANILA COURT KILLS INDICTMENT OF ENRILE; 
</P>
<P>
PHILIPPINES: CHARGES AGAINST 22 OTHERS IN DECEMBER COUP ATTEMPT ALSO RULED 
INVALID.

<P>
The Supreme Court today threw out indictments against Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile 
and 22 others accused of participating in December's failed coup, ruling the 
charges were not valid. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice Marcelo Fernan said the justices voted 11 to 2 against reviewing 
a 1956 court decision, thereby overturning the charges, which combined 
rebellion and murder. Two justices were absent or abstained, Fernan said. 
</P>
<P>
Enrile and the others faced charges stemming from the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt, in 
which 113 people were killed. It was the sixth and most serious attempt to 
overthrow the government of President Corazon Aquino. 
</P>
<P>
In 1956, the court ruled that killings occurring during an armed uprising 
should be treated differently than crimes with common motives. The court said 
defendants should be charged simply with rebellion and not murder. 
</P>
<P>
Rebellion is punishable by six to 12 years imprisonment, and defendants are 
allowed bail. Murder is non-bailable and is punishable by life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino's legal adviser, Adolfo Azcuna, said the government will abide by the 
decision but may seek reconsideration. Under Philippine law, Supreme Court 
rulings become final after 10 days, during which parties to the case can ask 
for reconsideration. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon had said earlier that the government would 
charge Enrile with rebellion if the court upheld the 1956 decision. 
</P>
<P>
Fernan said the majority believed that there were grounds to prosecute Enrile 
and the others for rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
Under Philippine law, charges are ordinarily filed after lengthy 
investigations. It was unclear whether authorities will have to conduct another 
investigation against Enrile and the others before new charges can be filed. 
</P>
<P>
The government's decision to indict Enrile and the others on the joint 
murder-rebellion charge was widely criticized at the time. The late President 
Ferdinand E. Marcos revived the joint charge during martial law. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Aquino canceled the charge, terming it "oppressive." She then approved 
its application against Enrile and the others, in an apparent bid to deny them 
bail.

The Tokyo area was shaken today by a moderate earthquake for the second time in 
five days. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries or damage were reported although high-speed "bullet" train services 
out of Tokyo were disrupted for several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"These kinds of earthquakes are fairly common, and it doesn't mean we're in for 
a big one," a Meteorological Agency official said. 
</P>
<P>
The tremor had a magnitude of 5.3. Buildings in the capital swayed and windows 
rattled, but people in cars were generally unaware that a quake had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's tremor had a reading of 6.0.

The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) today approved a statement of faith that mixes 
traditional Christian beliefs with environmental concerns and images of God as 
both mother and father. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners stood and cheered after approving the statement -- the church's 
first since a 1983 merger of its northern and southern branches following a 
122-year split over slavery -- in a 499-25 vote. 
</P>
<P>
The statement upholds centuries-old church teachings that Jesus Christ was both 
fully human and fully God, and that God raised Jesus from the dead to offer 
eternal life. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting more recent church developments, the statement also declares that 
God calls women and men to all ministries of the church, "and makes everyone 
equally in God's image, male and female, of every race and people, to live as 
one community." 
</P>
<P>
The statement also says that human beings have exploited nature, "and 
threatened death to the planet entrusted to our care."

<P>
The town's president, two of his sons, and a councilman were electrocuted when 
a flagpole they were taking down touched a high-voltage line, state police said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The men were removing the flagpole Monday night for painting and repairs when 
it touched a 7,200-volt power line. 
</P>
<P>
The pole was outside the community center in this mountain town of 350 people, 
75 miles south of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Screams from the mother of one victim drew Kathy Lawson to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"They were still on fire, and I held onto his mother to keep her back," Lawson 
said. "The whole town was running over to them, but nobody could get to them 
because the pole was right over them and electricity was still running through 
it." 
</P>
<P>
An emergency crew eventually shut off the power. 
</P>
<P>
Killed were Borough President Robert Friend, 59; his sons, Randall Friend, 23, 
and Robert Friend II, 22, and Councilman Keith Coppett, 35.

The Philippines today refused for the first time to accept Vietnamese boat 
people rescued by American ships at sea unless the United States guarantees to 
resettle them elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The 101 people have been stranded at the U.S. Subic Bay naval station north of 
Manila since May 30 after being picked up from two wooden boats in the South 
China Sea by the Beaufort. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not prepared to accept asylum seekers in open-ended cases without any 
commitment when and how they will be resettled," said Romualdo Ong, director 
general for Asia and Pacific Affairs at the Foreign Office. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said Manila's refusal to automatically accept the Vietnamese was a 
protest against U.S. opposition to a planned forcible repatriation to Vietnam 
of boat people who do not qualify for refugee status.

THATCHER CALLS FRENCH, GERMAN BAN ON BRITISH BEEF 'ILLEGAL'

<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said today that the French and West German 
bans on British beef are "quite illegal" and she insisted that there is no 
health danger. 
</P>
<P>
"British beef is safe," the prime minister said during a question period in the 
House of Commons. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who have banned it have done so more as a measure of protection for 
their own farmers." 
</P>
<P>
France imposed the ban last week, saying some meat might be tainted with "mad 
cow" disease. The disease, technically called bovine spongiform encephalopathy, 
is an incurable and fatal nervous disorder identified in Britain in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany and Luxembourg imposed their own bans later in the week. West 
Germany's Agriculture Ministry said it feared that British beef normally 
destined for France might be rerouted to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative Party lawmaker John Watts said it would be improper for Britain to 
respond in kind, but he urged British consumers to use their purchasing power 
to boycott French goods, including "appalling French Golden Delicious apples." 
</P>
<P>
Another Tory, Alan Amos, was cheered when he said he had eaten British beef for 
lunch and medical evidence showed that it was "perfectly safe."

OIL PRICES DROP AS SAUDIS LOWER COSTS; 
</P>
<P>
OPEC: A NEW PRICING FORMULA MAY SIGNAL AN END TO THE SAUDIS' SINGLE-HANDED BID 
TO SUPPORT A SAGGING OIL MARKET.

<P>
Oil prices fell sharply today on fears that Saudi Arabia has abandoned its 
single-handed, monthlong attempt to support the sagging oil market. 
</P>
<P>
Traders, alerted to a change in the kingdom's oil price formula, said that the 
Gulf nation may now be intent on forcing prices lower to punish other OPEC 
members for overproducing crude. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate crude, fell 52 cents to $16.62 per 
barrel -- its lowest level in more than two months -- while overseas oil prices 
dropped even further. 
</P>
<P>
North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded crude, was quoted below $15 a 
barrel for the first time since December, 1988. It fetched $23 early this year. 
</P>
<P>
The latest fall in spot prices accelerated a steady decline of recent weeks 
that is taking the real value of the barrel, allowing for inflation, to levels 
last seen in the gluts of the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The new drop reflects concern among traders that Saudi Arabia, exasperated by 
continued quota violations by others in the 13-member Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries, may soon increase output again to punish the 
transgressors. 
</P>
<P>
The fears were prompted by telexes that Saudi Arabia was lowering its contract 
price formula for its July oil shipments. 
</P>
<P>
Several traders saw this as a signal that the Saudis might be getting ready to 
raise volume after a cut in its output in May, which it made under a new OPEC 
agreement intended to reduce the glut. Saudi Arabia has already made known that 
it is vexed by how few of the 12 other members joined in cutting output. 
</P>
<P>
But Gulf sources said today that the kingdom regarded its pricing step as a 
marketing matter not connected with any decision on output. "We are still at 
quota and continue to be," one said. 
</P>
<P>
Western industry officials say that the Saudis will fix their July loading 
program in mid-June. If output indiscipline in the rest of OPEC is still trying 
their patience then, they could yet rescind their production cut. 
</P>
<P>
"A lower pricing formula would help them push more volume if they wanted to," 
said Steve Turner, an analyst with London stockbrokerage Smith New Court. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi terms are based on a formula of average spot values minus a discount. 
Traders said Saudi Arabia was widening the discount by 35 cents to Europe, 40 
cents to the United States and up to 70 cents for heavy grades sold in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
The West's energy watchdog, the Paris-based International Energy Agency, today 
assessed total OPEC output in May at 23.4 million barrels per day, down only 
400,000 from April. 
</P>
<P>
The new output agreement aimed to cut more than three times as much oil as 
that.

<P>
Stock prices fell today, countering a recent rally that produced record highs. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials declined 10.19 to 2,925.00. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues edged out advances on the New York Stock Exchange, with 755 
up, 811 down and 470 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 199.72 million shares, against 175.52 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell .28 to 199.93. 
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index declined .57 to 363.83. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the decline to scattered selling to take profits after a 
runup in the Dow Jones industrial average of more than 10% since late April. 
</P>
<P>
A sharp drop in crude oil prices and a weaker bond market contributed to the 
sell-off. Bond prices rose sharply and interest rates declined -- good for 
stocks -- in a rally late last week. 
</P>
<P>
Declines in several major oil and oilfield industry stocks because of lower oil 
prices offset gains in financial issues. Airlines, benefitting from the 
potential for cheaper jet fuel, also fared well. 
</P>
<P>
But some market players predicted that the decline was just a pause before a 
further jump. 
</P>
<P>
Money managers with large cash reserves when the market began moving upward 
have bought stock in recent days, boosting the market to its new highs. That 
enthusiasm was not seen as waning today. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices dipped lower in early trading today in the absence of any major 
news to move the market. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was off 3/16 point, or about $1.87 per 
$1,000 face amount, at midday. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction 
from its price, rose to 8.44% from 8.42% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said there were no developments to affect trading. 
</P>
<P>
The market had moved higher earlier in the session in anticipation of lower 
energy prices but retreated although crude oil futures were down at midday. The 
July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, 
was down 59 cents at $16.55 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 7.93%.

Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. is developing an engine noise-reduction device that 
will make older jet aircraft quieter and more fuel-efficient, company Chairman 
Allen Paulson said today. 
</P>
<P>
Paulson said he has applied for a patent on the device and production could 
begin in 1 1/2 to 2 years. 
</P>
<P>
The device is being designed not only for Gulfstream's older G-II and G-III 
corporate jet aircraft but also for commercial jets, including Boeing 707s and 
727s and McDonnell-Douglas DC-9s, said Paulson. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be bigger than anything we've ever done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Paulson said the device will give airlines a cost-effective answer to 
environmental pressures to reduce engine noise emissions. He said airports in 
Van Nuys and Long Beach, Calif., have tightened jet engine noise emission 
standards, and he expects others to follow.

Americans gave nearly 10.5% more to charity last year, and about half the 
$114.7 billion donated went to religious groups, according to a report. 
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the increase to an 8.9% rise in personal income, a 21.1% 
jump in the stock market, intensified fund-raising and growing awareness of 
AIDS, homelessness, the environment and other concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The report was issued by the AAFRC Trust for Philanthropy, an arm of the 
American Assn. of Fund-Raising Counsel. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest chunk of last year's donations, 47.4%, went to houses of worship, 
religious organizations and the social services they provide. 
</P>
<P>
Two natural disasters in 1989, the San Francisco earthquake and Hurricane Hugo, 
generated an outpouring of financial aid. The Red Cross, for example, received 
$155 million for both disasters in mostly small, individual donations.

'THE SIMPSONS' VAULT FOX INTO NIELSEN TOP 10

"The Simpsons" became the first Fox Broadcasting show to make the Nielsen top 
10, tying for fourth place, and Fox had two other shows in the top 20 last 
week, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
NBC won for the week, but Fox was the big gainer. Bart and the other Simpsons 
acted as lead-in for "Married . . . With Children," which finished 11th. The 
innovative "In Living Color" was 19th. 
</P>
<P>
Fox was quick to point out that "The Simpsons" did better in the ratings than 
"The Cosby Show," which tied for eighth. Fox has scheduled The Simpson family 
to move in on Thursday nights next fall to take on the Cosby clan in the 
leadoff time period. Thursday is a new night for Fox. 
</P>
<P>
Not everything came up roses for Fox last week, however. Its special Rolling 
Stones Steel Wheels concert ranked 77th. 
</P>
<P>
The good news for NBC was the strong reception given "Seinfeld," as most of the 
folks who watched No. 1 "Cheers" stuck around to make amiable Jerry Seinfeld 
No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
There really was only one Sunday movie in the usual time period -- NBC's 
"Revealing Evidence," which took the time period in 13th place. ABC's repeat of 
its Sammy Davis tribute came in 29th and the CBS airing of the Tony Awards was 
in a three-way tie for 61st. 
</P>
<P>
The poor showing for the Tonys did not stop CBS from winning on Sunday night, 
the most-watched night on television, thanks to "60 Minutes" in sixth place -- 
the only CBS show in the top 10 -- and "Murder, She Wrote" in 17th. 
</P>
<P>
That was CBS's only night -- NBC took Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday, and ABC 
had Monday, Tuesday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
NBC won the week ending June 3 with a 10.9 rating and a 20 share. ABC was 
second with a 10.2 rating and a 19 share, while CBS had an 8.9 rating and a 16 
share. 
</P>
<P>
TOP 10 SHOWS 
</P>
<P>
The top 10 programs for the week ending Sunday, June 3, according to the A.C. 
Nielsen Co., were: 
</P>
<P>
1. Cheers (NBC) 
</P>
<P>
2. Roseanne (ABC) 
</P>
<P>
3. Seinfeld (NBC) 
</P>

"Tonight Show" producer Fred De Cordova was in stable condition in a North 
Carolina hospital after surgery for swelling of the main artery carrying blood 
from his heart, NBC said today. 
</P>
<P>
De Cordova, 79, who has produced "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson" for 
two decades, underwent surgery Friday for an aneurysm of the abdominal portion 
of his aorta, network spokeswoman Merry Aronson said on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
She would not reveal the name of the hospital, but said he was rushed there 
from his hotel room last Friday. De Cordova had been in Winston-Salem playing 
in a golf tournament, Aronson said. Aronson didn't specify what type of aortic 
aneurysm De Cordova had. She also didn't elaborate on his condition, other than 
to say he was stable. 
</P>
<P>
After a stint as a stage director that ended with "Ziegfeld Follies" in 1943, 
De Cordova signed with Warner Brothers. Among about 50 films he directed was 
"Bedtime for Bonzo," starring Ronald Reagan and a chimpanzee. 
</P>
<P>
In 1953, De Cordova moved to television, directing or producing "My Three 
Sons," "Burns and Allen" and "The Jack Benny Show," before joining Carson in 
what he has called "the best job in television."

BROADWAY AUDIENCES PEAK BUT TICKET SALES HIT RECORD

<P>
Broadway's annual audience has hit a plateau of about 8 million people but its 
gross ticket sales of 1989-90 were up 8%, reflecting a rise in box office 
prices of up to $60 a ticket, the League of American Theaters and Producers 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
The league's report on the season, which ended last Sunday, noted that gross 
ticket sales had set a record for the third consecutive year and were at an 
all-time high at $283 million. Ticket sales for the 1988-89 season were $262 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The news from the road was even better. 
</P>
<P>
Box office receipts for Broadway shows touring the United States and Canada 
soared to a new record of $367 million, a 43% increase from $256 million last 
season. The national audience was 12.9 million according to the number of 
tickets sold, up 33% from 9.7 million last season. 
</P>
<P>
Road companies of Broadway shows had a total of 944 playing weeks, an increase 
of 9% over last season. 
</P>
<P>
Broadway's gross ticket sales increase of 8% was realized despite fewer playing 
weeks, 1,061, for all 35 productions on Broadway, compared to last season's 
1,116 weeks, and could only be ascribed to higher ticket prices. 
</P>
<P>
The season saw orchestra seats for a musical -- "Jerome Robbins Broadway" -- 
hit $60 for the first time, up $5 from the $55 ticket price for such hits as 
"Les Miserables," "Phantom of the Opera," "City of Angels" and "Grand Hotel." 
Musicals accounted for 75% of gross receipts and 67% of attendance. 
</P>
<P>
The top price for straight plays was $50, with some charging $40 and $45. Plays 
represented only 24% of gross receipts and 32% of attendance. The league said 
the average theatergoer paid $35.25 for a ticket, up 7% over last season. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance totaled 8.03 million tickets sold, slightly up from last season's 
7.97 million but down from 8.14 million for 1987-88, an all-time high.

BRAVES' JONES TO GET RECORD $275,000 BONUS

The Atlanta Braves and their No. 1 draft choice, Chipper Jones, wasted no time 
in coming to terms after the team made Jones the top pick in baseball's free 
agent draft. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who had accepted a scholarship to play at Miami of Florida, decided to 
forgo college and signed a contract late Monday that contains a record signing 
bonus of $275,000. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' father, Larry Jones, said the terms are "extremely fair," covering 
$68,000 in college education and a bonus that tops the record $241,000 the 
Braves gave prep catcher Tyler Houston last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most substantial signing bonus a high school kid has gotten," said 
Larry Jones, who negotiated the deal with Braves Assistant Vice President Paul 
Snyder at the Jones home in Pierson, Fla., after Monday's draft. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in the ballpark right away," Chipper Jones said. "We said what we 
wanted, and they said what they wanted to give, and I said why don't we split 
the difference both ways." 
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old shortstop also is to receive incentives for each level attained 
and a life insurance annuity that pushes the total value of the package to 
about $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very high on Chipper," said Braves General Manager Bobby Cox. "He's 
already an excellent defensive player and has shown outstanding ability as a 
switch-hitter." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-3, 185-pound Jones, who played at The Bolles School in Jacksonville, 
Fla., is Florida's high school player of the year. He hit .488 this season with 
10 doubles, five home runs, 25 runs batted in and 14 stolen bases.

Lithuanian basketball star Arvydas Sabonis, expected to play for the Portland 
Trail Blazers in the National Basketball Assn. next season, signed a one-year 
contract extension today with Forum Filatelico of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Team officials announced the signing but declined to say how much they would 
pay Sabonis, who helped the Soviet Union win the Olympic gold medal in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Sabonis, a 7-foot-3 center, originally signed with the Spanish club in June, 
1989. That contract was worth $1 million, but most of the money was to go to 
sports authorities in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Sabonis said at the time that he hoped to play in the NBA after one year in 
Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Portland, which drafted Sabonis in 1986, holds NBA rights to the 25-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Sabonis had hoped that the less strenuous schedule in the Spanish league would 
help him to recover from an Achilles' tendon injury that had bothered him since 
before the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last May, Sabonis said the tendon was better.

Bob Bass, whose wheeling and dealing brought the San Antonio Spurs 10 new 
players and a record-setting season, has been named NBA Executive of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Team officials from throughout the NBA vote on the Executive of the Year award. 
</P>
<P>
Bass received 24 votes, followed by Jerry West of the Lakers with 18. John Nash 
of the Philadelphia 76ers was third with seven votes. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA-sanctioned award comes after a season in which the Spurs captured the 
Midwest Division title, set a league record for the best single-season 
improvement and a franchise record for most victories. The Spurs' regular 
season record of 56-26 was a 35-game improvement over their 21-61 finish in 
1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio defeated the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the Western 
Conference playoffs, then forced their semifinal round to seven games before 
losing in overtime to the Portland Trail Blazers.

Seattle Mariners pitcher Scott Bankhead is scheduled to undergo surgery on his 
right shoulder next Tuesday to repair a shoulder bone spur and expects to miss 
the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Arthur Pappas will operate on the acromnio clavicular joint in Bankhead's 
right shoulder in Boston, the Mariners said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
Bankhead was placed on the disabled list Sunday for the second time this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Bankhead, 26, led the Mariners with a 14-6 record and a 3.34 earned run average 
last season but is 0-2 with an 11.08 ERA in four starts this season. 
</P>
<P>
He had been scheduled to undergo arthroscopic surgery two weeks ago, but that 
was put on hold when examination indicated the soreness in his shoulder might 
be from inflammation. He subsequently pitched twice for five innings without 
pain, only to have the pain return and force him to leave a game Friday night 
after 1 2/3 innings.

</P>
<P>
Lendl, ranked No. 1 in the world, has made Wimbledon his top priority. 
</P>
<P>
His two-month practice for the title that has always eluded him included 
workouts with former Australian tennis greats Ken Rosewall, John Newcombe and 
his personal coach, Tony Roche. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to win it, there's no secret about that," Lendl said. "It would 
mean I achieved what I wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl even passed up the French Open, an event he's won three times, in his 
desire for success on the manicured lawns of the All England Club. 
</P>
<P>
"The French is something I've accomplished," said Lendl, noting the tournament 
still holds great importance as a Grand Slam event.

"I wish there would be four weeks between these two and I could play both of 
them."

Andre Agassi muscled defending champion Michael Chang out of the French Open 
today, while 14-year-old Jennifer Capriati pranced into the semifinals with 
another straight-set victory. 
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded Agassi, with stubble bristling and hot-pink outfit brighter 
than ever, reached his fourth Grand Slam semifinal and his second in three 
years here with an overpowering 6-2, 6-1, 4-6, 6-2 victory built on sheer 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati, now the youngest semifinalist in Grand Slam history, bopped around 
the baseline and beat seventh-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez, 6-2, 6-4. The Florida 
teen-ager has made the final four without dropping a set and meets 
second-seeded Monica Seles next. 
</P>
<P>
Two streaks -- five games in a row in the first set, the last six in the second 
-- put Agassi in a dominating position over his fellow American. And when he is 
in such a spot, he gets even stronger. He finished the match by breaking Chang 
with a powerful backhand volley. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I had an edge over him in my serve, and I was going for winners more," 
Agassi said. "We both played well and I just came out on top." 
</P>
<P>
Chang, who is from Placentia, Calif., said: "Andre played too well today. He 
was too strong off the ground for me. He didn't miss too many balls. He's 
learning when to hit hard and when to play safe." 
</P>
<P>
Agassi next plays Jonas Svensson, ranked 25th in the world. The unseeded Swede 
beat Frenchman Henri Leconte, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3, 6-4, to the disappointment of 
hometown fans who jammed center court. 
</P>
<P>
Top-ranked Steffi Graf shook off a mid-match charge by Conchita Martinez and 
reached the women's semifinals of the 14th consecutive Grand Slam tournament 
she has played. Graf opened the day of six quarterfinals with a 6-1, 6-3 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Seles, the second seed and hottest player in tennis, survived a scare to win 
her 30th consecutive match. She came back from a 1-4 deficit in the third set 
to beat sixth-seeded Manuela Maleeva, 3-6, 6-1, 7-5. Maleeva, who cracked 
herself in the head with her racket on a second-set shot, was two points from 
victory at 5-4, 0-30, when Seles took off to win the final three games. 
</P>
<P>
Jana Novotna then beat Katerina Maleeva, 4-6, 6-2, 6-4, and will meet Graf in 
the semifinal Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi, the No. 3 seed in search of his first Grand Slam title, has never lost 
to Chang in tournament play and rarely looked in danger in a match lasting 
almost 2 3/4 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed once again as if he had arrived at the stadium on a skateboard, the 
20-year-old from Las Vegas cruised through the first two sets with minimal 
effort, demonstrating the difference his improved fitness has made in his game. 
</P>
<P>
But Chang, who rarely seems to strike his true form unless staring defeat in 
the face, responded by taking the third set, 6-4, to raise momentary hopes of 
yet another great escape. 
</P>
<P>
It was not to be as Agassi reeled off the first three games of the fourth set. 
Chang then wasted three break points which would have brought him back to 3-2 
and found himself serving to stay in the match at 5-2 down. 
</P>
<P>
In the most gripping game of the contest, Chang saved two match points but 
Agassi, crossing himself before the final point, finished the match with a 
midcourt volley that left his opponent helpless. 
</P>
<P>
"Me and Michael have played one another so many times our games are very 
similar. It was more a matter of who hit the ball harder," said Agassi, who has 
now reached his fourth Grand Slam semifinal.

A novice executive at a foreign-owned factory here arrived to find his 200 
workers lined up outside the gates, refusing to go in. It seems a witch doctor 
had cast a spell on the grounds by cutting off a chicken head and spraying its 
blood around the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
The executive put through a panicky call to John Moore, an American who had 
been running a neighboring steel fabricating plant for six years. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I didn't have much practical experience, but I told him he had to get 
another witch doctor to cast a stronger spell," Moore recalls. "Luckily, one of 
my drivers had a relative who was one, and that's what we did." 
</P>
<P>
Not all the advice Moore offers expatriate businessmen coming to Africa is 
quite so outre. But being a Westerner in the virtually unique position of 
owning and managing an entirely local enterprise -- rather than an African 
subsidiary of a large multinational -- gives the 51-year-old Moore an unrivaled 
feel for how to function in what must be one of the most difficult and unusual 
business climates in the world. 
</P>
<P>
It's not only the vast, often hostile, bureaucracies and almost complete 
absence of modern infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa that make business 
tough. Labor is cheap, but energy is expensive. The currencies are either close 
to worthless or, like the French-subsidized CFA franc that is legal tender in 
Togo and 12 other African countries, so overvalued that you cannot hold too 
much cash, lest you lose a bundle if and when it is officially devalued. 
</P>
<P>
The market is minuscule; a World Bank estimate last year found that the gross 
national products of all 42 countries of sub-Saharan Africa, taken together, 
were roughly equal to that of Belgium. That makes much of the strain of 
establishing business in Africa seem less than worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
Africa's reputation as a continent of war, disaster and corruption is a great 
obstacle to attracting new business. 
</P>
<P>
With the 1980s considered a lost decade in terms of the continent's economic 
development, and with the example of Eastern Europe before it, many governments 
here are starting to open their doors to the kind of private foreign investors 
they spent the last 30 years cursing as greedy exploiters. 
</P>
<P>
They should not be surprised if there is no flood of interested parties, 
despite the proliferation of Western-style investment codes guaranteeing 
protection from nationalization and the right to send 100% of their local 
profits back home. 
</P>
<P>
Many Western businessmen consider Africa politically hostile, and with good 
reason. Even countries with a professed goal of attracting new investors still 
pay lip service to the old political credos. Just last April, for instance, 
President Jerry J. Rawlings of Ghana -- a country that has been held up by the 
World Bank as a "model" of progressive economic policy -- stunned a meeting of 
potential foreign investors by launching an attack on capitalist exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
For all that, Moore argues that much of Africa's sour image is unearned. Take 
corruption: "I tell people that Africa didn't invent it. The rest of the world, 
in my opinion, is just as corrupt." Here, at least, it's understandable. "In 
Benin, the civil service hasn't been paid in four or five months. Of course 
they're going to ask you for a little 'contribution.' " 
</P>
<P>
Moore moved to Togo in 1983 to lease a steel mill the government was trying to 
divest. Since then he has expanded by picking up steel fabricating plants in 
nearby Ivory Coast and Benin. He is among the first applicants for space in 
Togo's latest economic initiative, a free-trade zone where he hopes to assemble 
steel pylons and manufacture wire, all for export duty free. Last year the 
three-country group made sales of about $15 million, and Moore is hoping to 
raise that to $20 million this year and to $35 million in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile he spends a lot of time helping the Togolese promote their country as 
the best place in West Africa for foreigners to do business -- its military 
government notwithstanding. The government is committed to moving into a 
free-market economy, he says, and both the bureaucracy and the military keep a 
low profile. 
</P>
<P>
"The Togolese are lucky to have him here," remarked one Western diplomat. "He's 
sharp and well-financed, and he's an experienced businessman." 
</P>
<P>
Moore's experience makes him think the free-trade zone idea has been oversold 
as an economic panacea. Some Togolese officials are predicting it will bring in 
15,000 new jobs, a wildly optimistic figure given the fact, among others, that 
Togo's zone is one of four being proposed for the West African coast alone. 
</P>
<P>
"T hese sorts of initiatives become the flavor of the month," Moore says. And 
he does not see a lot of eager investors slavering to enter the African market. 
"I doubt many others will come along after me." 
</P>
<P>
Why not? The risks of doing business, including political instability, economic 
calamity and distance from decent markets, mean that an investor requires as 
much as a 25% return on invested capital. That's a level that not even Moore 
has reached. His firm, STS (for Societe Togolaise de Siderurgie), makes about 
14%, he says, although he takes a lot more out in management fees. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem is staff. Start with the African work force. "The African 
worker, if properly motivated, is very good," he says. The tremendous 
underemployment in most African countries, coupled with the size of the 
extended families each employed person must support, means that workers will 
respond eagerly to incentives. Sometimes too eagerly: To meet production 
targets they also tend to take unnecessary risks, Moore says. At his Lome 
rolling mill he has installed a production incentive, but the rule is that any 
accident on the line will wipe out the entire bonus for that shift. 
</P>
<P>
Expatriate help is hard to recruit. "I'm constantly looking for new people," he 
says. "The best and the brightest don't want to move to Africa. So you get 
retreads just short of retirement or green kids." 
</P>
<P>
Those who do come over tend to burn out from the isolation. "It's difficult if 
you're single, because there are no white women around. We send them home for R 
&amp; R every six months." 
</P>
<P>
Like so many expatriates one meets in remote corners of Africa, Moore's resume 
is what one might charitably call picaresque. He was born in India to American 
parents and educated in Britain and at the University of Virginia. There was a 
stint in the army before he took a job with a Swiss banking group and resigned 
to start a company to build hospitals in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
After that he did some publishing in South America, running a magazine that was 
later partially sold to the French publishers Hachette. In the late 1970s his 
father, in the steel business, got him involved in a steel plant in Panama; 
when Gen. Manuel A. Noriega began his rise there, Moore left. He says his 
Britain-based investment firm still owns 10% of the Panama venture. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way Moore spent some time in New York selling Russian art, until a 
deal with the Soviet government to market reproductions of paintings from the 
Tretyakov Gallery fell through. 
</P>
<P>
One advantage of all of this travel, Moore maintains, is a good feel for what 
goes on in places outside the mainstream of Western business. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen too much here that I hadn't seen already in South America and 
the Mideast," he says. "There are no new moves." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the old moves he views with nonchalance. "We don't have a week that 
goes by here in which a minister doesn't call up and say he has a grandson, or 
a cousin, who needs a job. We interview him, and if there's an opening we give 
it to him. If not, the minister gets a form letter. You've got to give him that 
much. You have to give the minister the courtesy of interviewing his 
candidate." 
</P>
<P>
Then there's bribery. As much as Moore contends it's a world-wide problem, he 
does take steps to deflect it. 
</P>
<P>
"The minute you start paying (bribes) you're a marked man," he says. His 
alternative: "We build up I.O.U.s," he says. "If an official's got a sick kid 
and he needs to fly him out of the country, I might come up with an air ticket. 
If he happens to be head of customs, that's good luck for me. But I never do it 
as a tie-in for something I want. I'd rather give it to him ahead of time." 
</P>
<P>
Doing business in Africa has given Moore a window on the place that few other 
travelers see. One time he was invited to meet the chief economics adviser to 
Liberian President Samuel K. Doe. "I don't know why you won't invest in this 
country," the man said, adding in all seriousness: "The Liberian dollar trades 
at two-to-one to the American dollar. But the Japanese yen is only 140 to one. 
We're obviously much stronger." 
</P>
<P>
At another point he found himself on an endless train ride into the interior of 
the Congo bush in search of a $12-million steel plant the government had put up 
for sale. The plant turned out to be 30 kilometers from the railhead, which 
itself could only be used eight months of the year. At the site itself, Moore 
discovered the plant equipment still disassembled in the original shipping 
crates. The government nevertheless wanted the full $12 million for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'You've got the world's largest collection of mushrooms out there.' I 
offered to take the embarrassment off their hands for $500,000." 
</P>
<P>
The ministers were appalled. "They said, 'But this belongs to the people. We 
can't sell it at that price. The people would rebel.' " 
</P>
<P>
Naturally enough, Moore has his critics in Togo. These include the French, who 
are irked that American economic proposals, like the free-trade zone, are being 
accepted so readily in France's old colonial back yard. French diplomats here 
whisper dark suggestions about Moore's business dealings in Latin America, but 
they have never produced any hard evidence against him to the Togolese. 
</P>
<P>
More important are the complaints of the World Bank, always a potent economic 
force in a country as poor as Togo. Although Moore says he got a letter from 
the World Bank accepting the deal in principle before buying the plant, the 
institution has since criticized the high tariffs Togo levies on imported steel 
products to keep Moore's product saleable. 
</P>
<P>
The World Bank says it is not opposed to all high tariffs in developing 
countries -- only to those protecting industries that don't do much. "We're 
looking at excessive protection where the value-added is small," says Jacques 
Daniel, the World Bank's resident representative in Lome. 
</P>
<P>
Since Moore buys his raw steel from abroad, the only gain for Togo from his 
operation is a small amount of tax on those imports and from salaries paid to 
345 workers. That's not enough to justify a 43% tariff on imported steel 
products, Daniel suggests. 
</P>
<P>
But Moore contends that with Africa looking increasingly marginal in the world 
economy, even greater incentives are needed to attract capital. Competition is 
too great today elsewhere. "If I were looking for a place to invest right now, 
would I be here?" he asks. "I'd be in Eastern Europe."

WORK OF CELEBRITY PHOTOGRAPHER GREG GORMAN ON EXHIBIT IN O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The most difficult things that photographer Greg Gorman has to deal with have 
nothing to do with photography per se. Most of his work comes in trying to 
elicit the personalities of people whose job it is to act like anyone but 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
As a photographer whose specialty is celebrities, Gorman must be a 
psychologist. He must be an intimidator. He must be a leader. And, most of all, 
he must be persuasive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's winning through intimidation," said Gorman, 40, whose subjects have 
included Bette Midler, Mel Gibson and David Bowie. A selection of Gorman's 
portraits will be on exhibit until June 13 at Rizzoli International Bookstore 
&amp; Gallery in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Gorman, who lives in Los Angeles, is often hired by major magazines, studios, 
advertisers and public relations firms. His assignments include such projects 
as shooting movie posters, magazine covers and shots for advertising campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, the name of my profession is psychology," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorman, who was reared in Kansas City, Kan., got his introduction to 
photography in the late '60s by taking shots at a Jimi Hendrix concert with a 
friend's camera that he had borrowed. A few weeks later, he shot a Doors 
concert in St. Louis and, at that point, he was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
He enrolled in a photojournalism class at the University of Kansas, then 
continued his studies at USC, majoring in cinematography, which eventually 
provided his entree to celebrity photography. 
</P>
<P>
Gorman did a little bit of film work but felt that he had more creative control 
as a still photographer than as a cinematographer. He also enjoyed the 
one-on-one relationship he had with the people he was photographing. 
</P>
<P>
His first work in Los Angeles was shooting models and actors on a free-lance 
basis, for which he earned about $35 a day. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky," Gorman said. "After I got out here, I shot a few (celebrities), 
which led to shooting a few more. Little by little, it snowballed. It was guilt 
by association. It wasn't me going after them; it was more word of mouth." 
</P>
<P>
Gorman says that competition has become much tougher since he started, but he 
doesn't see it as a battle between photographers for assignments. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone who is really good is suffering from not working," Gorman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He describes his style as pretty straightforward -- neither particularly trendy 
nor avant-garde. In some photographs, however, he creates a dark mood that 
leaves much to the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
"(If) I'm shooting a specific assignment, but there's something about the 
person I find intriguing, I will ask them to (let me) do a shot for me at the 
end of the session," Gorman said. "I'll take some pictures for me, separate and 
away from any stock publicity photo. 
</P>
<P>
"The back cover of my book ("Greg Gorman Volume 1") is a good example. There is 
a picture of Tiger Williams, the hockey player. He was here shooting an ad 
campaign for Sporting News. He walked in the door, and I loved his face. He was 
a little guy who has one of the most ferocious reputations in hockey. He's 
taken over 200 stitches in his face." 
</P>
<P>
Gorman's comments on some of the other stars he has photographed: 
</P>
<P>
* Bette Midler -- "She has been a client of mine for years. As a matter of 
fact, we just finished putting together her new album cover. She was a person 
who took winning through intimidation. She was often irascible, not 
particularly easy to get to know. But once you get to know her and once you win 
her trust, she's one of the most down-to-earth human beings to work with. She 
is one of the few celebrities who isn't into 'yes' people. She and I fight more 
than we get along. It's mainly because I tell her exactly what I think, and I 
push her during the photo sessions." 
</P>
<P>
* Kirk Douglas -- "Kirk is great. I've shot him a number of times. The 
photograph in the book is a perfect example about my personal work. I told him 
I was just finishing up a book and I wanted something that had a little edge to 
it, a little more like the Kirk Douglas people know. I like it more than 
anything I shot for him." 
</P>
<P>
* Arnold Schwarzenegger -- "He is one of my all-time favorites. Arnold is 
really a giant. I think there are few people in the business today with his 
looks, integrity, personality, sense of business and charm. He will be on top 
forever. There are few people I have worked with who are so charismatic to be 
around, that have as great a sense of humor or such a terrific understanding of 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
* Al Pacino -- "I was hired as a special photographer to shoot him in the movie 
'Scarface.' I was warned he would be difficult: I would need to use long 
lenses, and he probably wouldn't pose for me; I would probably be thrown off 
the set, so I should just try to get a few head shots. He was exactly the 
opposite. . . . He was fantastic, always giving of his time." 
</P>
<P>
* Grace Jones -- "Grace is absolutely larger than life. There are few people 
that, when you turn on the camera, . . . can perform like Grace Jones. She has 
the best awareness of anybody I have photographed. I directed my first video 
for Grace for her single 'Love on Top of Love.' We've had a long working 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
* Michael Jackson -- "Michael Jackson is great. I think he is misrepresented in 
a lot of ways because I don't think he is that strange. I think he is extremely 
eccentric and childlike in his feeling. He loves kids. He always came over 
without an entourage and was very down-to-earth. He was very open to sharing 
ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Gorman says that nine times out of 10, celebrities aren't as tough as their 
reputations, though sometimes they use those reputations to their advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is their bark is always louder than their bite," Gorman said. 
</P>
<P>
