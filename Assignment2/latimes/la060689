OILY BEACHES IN ALASKA TO BE FERTILIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Exxon will spread fertilizer on oil-soaked Alaskan beaches in a test effort to 
accelerate the growth of natural bacteria that break down toxic hydrocarbons 
from oil, the Environmental Protection Agency said. Under an agreement with the 
EPA, Exxon will apply nitrogen and phosphorous to about two acres of beach 
along the southern shore of Snug Harbor on Knight Island, one of the areas of 
Prince William Sound hardest hit by the 11 million gallons of oil spilled by 
the supertanker Exxon Valdez on March 24. The nitrogen and phosphorus are 
nutrients intended to stimulate the growth of native microorganisms in the 
sound that "eat" certain toxic elements of the spilled crude oil. The 
experiment, which is to begin Thursday, could result in the breakdown of toxic 
hydrocarbons within two to three years rather than the five- to 10-year period 
required under normal circumstances, said Dick Valentinetti of EPA's Office of 
Research and Development.

Israel's six-member diplomatic delegation moved into its old embassy in Moscow 
in another tiny step toward normalized relations with the Soviet Union. The 
building is still officially under the control of the Netherlands, which has 
looked after Israel's interests since the Kremlin broke relations with the 
Jewish state in 1967, and the refurnished Israeli Embassy cannot fly the 
blue-and-white Israeli flag or display any emblem. President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev has been re-establishing contacts with the Jewish state, leading to a 
Soviet consular group going to Tel Aviv and the Israeli delegation to Moscow.

Two communications satellites were lifted into orbit in the fourth of nine 
space flights planned by the European consortium Arianespace. An upgraded 
version of the Ariane 4, Europe's most powerful rocket, carried the double 
payload aloft to complete the European Space Agency's 13th successful mission. 
The three-stage, 192-foot-long rocket, launched from the agency's jungle 
complex in French Guiana, delivered Japan's $100-million Superbird-A 
communications satellite and a West German television-relay station known as 
DFS Kopernikus 1 into orbit.

A judge in New York City set high bail for a teen-ager indicted in the gang 
rape of a jogger after Assistant Manhattan Dist. Atty. Elizabeth Lederer 
revealed that other suspects accused him of going "wild on her," punching her 
in the face and stomach and raping her. Bail for the 14-year-old was set at 
$250,000 bond or $25,000 cash at the close of a dramatic hearing before Justice 
Thomas Galligan at state Supreme Court in Manhattan. The Harlem teen-ager's 
attorney, who had asked for $15,000 cash to secure a $50,000 bond, said the 
boy's parents -- a postal worker and a stroke victim -- would never be able to 
raise the heavier bail.

San Luis Obispo County Supervisor Dave Blakely sold cocaine to friends between 
1983 and 1985, but no charges will be filed because the three-year statute of 
limitations has run out, the San Luis Obispo County district attorney's office 
said. Senior district attorney's investigator William Hanley said informants 
indicated that Blakely, then a teacher, sold cocaine about 30 times. Blakely, 
who has publicly admitted using cocaine, marijuana and other drugs before 1985, 
called Hanley's report "character assassination" and denied selling drugs.

Ethiopia's Parliament unanimously endorsed the idea of unconditional peace 
talks with rebels in Eritrea aimed at ending the 28-year-old civil war in 
northeastern Africa. The government's six-point peace plan was approved by all 
750 deputies present at a special session of the 835-member body convened to 
discuss the war in Eritrea. Diplomats said it was the first time President 
Mengistu Haile Mariam had set no conditions for negotiating with the rebels in 
the north. Under the plan, the talks would be attended by international 
observers.

A standard blood test for kidney functioning may indicate a heightened risk of 
dying within eight years among people with high blood pressure, a study 
suggests. The study, of 10,768 people with high blood pressure, found that 
those with high levels of creatinine, a waste product produced by muscle 
tissue, in their blood showed higher death rates from heart attack and stroke 
as well as kidney disease, the researchers said. Death rates rose with rising 
creatinine levels. Kidneys normally remove creatinine from blood, so high 
levels can signal kidney trouble. The work by researchers at several medical 
schools is presented in the May issue of the journal Hypertension.

The state's Health Services Division announced Monday that it will investigate 
UC Irvine Medical Center's unprecedented "obstetrical diversion" policy, in 
which women in labor are turned away if the facility is overcrowded. "The 
intent of the law is to ensure that a woman in labor can get help. . . . It 
doesn't say you can send them away," said Dr. Patricia E. Chase, consultant to 
the state's Licensing and Certification Division, the enforcement arm of the 
Health Services Division which oversees hospitals. "I've clearly got some 
concerns with this (new policy)," said Chase, who is charged with enforcing the 
state's "anti-patient-dumping law." The law, passed last year, makes it illegal 
to turn away emergency patients to other hospitals. The medical center, which 
instituted the policy over the weekend, has long complained that it is burdened 
with most of the county's indigent patients. The only exception to the new 
policy would be women who have received pre-natal care at UCI Medical.

The Administration is considering the sale of 60 F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan 
at a cost of $1.4 billion and may make an announcement of an agreement during 
the current visit to Washington of Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, 
U.S. officials said. Bhutto is to hold talks today with President Bush and 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, and an official said the sale "will 
certainly be discussed." But he refused to comment on any timetable for the 
purchase. The wisdom of the proposed sale has already been questioned by some 
members of Congress who fear it will only add more fuel to the arms race under 
between Pakistan and India and divert Pakistani resources from needed economic 
investment at home.

An associate of Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. was sentenced in Leesburg, Va., to 10 
years in prison on securities violations stemming from the political 
extremist's fund-raising activities. Rochelle Ascher, 38, of Towson, Md., had 
been convicted on charges of selling an unregistered security with intent to 
defraud, sale of a security by an unregistered agent with intent to defraud and 
conspiracy, and six counts of securities fraud involving six sales to four 
individuals. Loudoun County Circuit Judge Carlton Penn sentenced Ascher to 56 
years and ordered that the sentences be served in such a way that her term in 
prison would be 10 years. State officials had maintained that Ascher, 15 
co-defendants and five LaRouche organizations allegedly bilked hundreds of 
people out of as much as $30 million.

HARVEST OF BRUTALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the end, the old men who cling to power in China could think of no better 
way to deal with six weeks of popular clamor for change than by ordering the 
army to turn its machine guns and tanks against the protesters. The ensuing 
slaughter in the streets of Beijing has appalled the world and quite probably 
severed the final cords of respect linking China's ruled with their rulers. The 
students and their supporters who demonstrated in and around Tian An Men Square 
had sought only modest legal and political reforms. A divided regime answered 
them first with patronizing equivocation, then with threats, finally with 
brutal repression. It was the response of men who remember the past all too 
well but who lack any relevant vision of the future. It was a response of a 
kind that invites open rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
At no point throughout the long demonstrations did the protesters ever attack 
the unique authority claimed and exercised by the Communist Party. While there 
was much talk of the need for more democracy -- if little clarity or agreement 
about just what that means -- there were no demands for a multiparty system 
that, as in Hungary and Poland, could in time lead to the electoral replacement 
of the Communist regime. Instead there were calls for a freer press, for curbs 
on rampant official corruption and nepotism, for the regime to pay more 
attention to what the students and the masses want. This was hardly a radical, 
let alone a counter-revolutionary program. Yet Deng Xiaoping, his fellow ruling 
octogenarians and their proteges chose to respond to it virtually as an 
insurrection that threatened national chaos. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to bring the full weight of state power to bear came only after an 
evident power struggle in the party's upper ranks, the full nature and extent 
of which remain uncertain and perhaps still inconclusive. For now, obviously, 
the hard-liners have carried the day, invoking vicious, relentless and shameful 
force in an effort to reassert unquestioned control. But whether they can 
maintain control, as Deng's health deteriorates and popular outrage swells, is 
another matter. 
</P>
<P>
The regime has claimed from the beginning and claims now that only a handful of 
troublemakers were involved in the calls for a freer society. That attempt to 
minimize the depth of the protests fools no politically aware person in China. 
What has taken place, what still goes on, is a mass protest triggered by 
frustration and anger over economic and political conditions. Even the military 
is now seen to be less than wholly on the side of those who would have it turn 
its guns on the people. Deng and the others who made the decision to smash the 
protests have -- perhaps -- got what they wanted in the short term. But the 
costs of this morally odious action to China's stability, to its international 
standing, to its prospects for future development are certain to prove 
enormous.

Your revealing article (May 20) on the gift-grubbing gluttony of Sen. Strom 
Thurmond (R-S.C.), matched only by his lavishly extravagant life-style 
cheerfully subsidized by the tobacco industry he protects. For the most of his 
50 years in public life he was greedily gorging himself at the public trough of 
free hotel, motel, planes, vacations etc. Anything "Ol Strom" wants, he gets. 
</P>
<P>
Of course the thick-skinned Strom defiantly reports all this baksheesh as 
required by law. Reelection is just a formality, no question. Malfeasance, a 
nettlesome word occasionally crops up when someone has the effrontery and folly 
to run against "Ol Strom." 
</P>
<P>
This voracious repository of covetousness will be welcoming the 21st Century, 
leaning against a bale of tobacco, waiting with his goody-bag to refill to the 
detriment of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
All this while many senators meticulously divulge the most trivial of presents 
for fear of electoral backlash. This double standard exists at a time of 
national revulsion against the death-dealing drug. 
</P>
<P>
The demand for the weed in America has diminished through legal and moral 
legislation. To offset this loss the United States has been actively pushing 
tobacco exports to reluctant Third World countries at attractive prices. 
</P>
<P>
To fulminate against this ancient anachronism seems futile. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina should cover itself in shame with a tobacconists fig leaf to 
hide the suffering the drug represents.

The series by Mark A. Stein and Louis Sahagun paints a bleak picture of the 
BLM's stewardship of the nation's public lands. However, this story pales 
against the enormous waste of taxpayer money and the rape of the Western 
environment perpetrated by the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers over the last century. The bitter rivalry between these two giant 
bureaucracies over the right to manage the invaluable water resources west of 
the Mississippi has led to waste, fraud and abuse of unprecedented proportions.

This appalling saga has been documented by Marc Reisner in a book titled 
"Cadillac Desert."

When an agency fails to perform well, as documented by the Stein-Sahagun series 
on the BLM, the problems are funding, foul-ups and philosophy. The series 
carefully made these distinctions. 
</P>
<P>
When a miner bulldozes and illegal road in a wilderness study area and the BLM 
doesn't know about it, the problem is funding. 
</P>
<P>
When it learns of the illegal road and then gives the miner a permit to 
bulldoze, it is a foul-up. 
</P>
<P>
When the miner then does a lot more illegal damage and the BLM hasn't required 
a bond for the permit, the problem is philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, in the California Desert Protection Act, Congress will mandate the 
wilderness and create the national parks so vital to protecting our desert. 
Congress will set the philosophical course for the next century.

We applaud your article on the BLM (May 24), which provides an informative, if 
rare, peek at what is often called the "forgotten legacy" in the public lands 
system. The message should be clear to anyone reading about the haphazardness 
of BLM's management, especially here in California; the agency's policy-making 
apparatus is badly adrift. Ultimately, under federal law, Congress must decide 
how to protect the California desert. 
</P>
<P>
Today the new regime has failed to offer any substantive, much less minor, 
changes in the agency's land management programs or policies. As a result, many 
illogical, discredited and potentially ruinous practices continue unabated. 
Current policies, as contained in the California BLM Desert Plan, would also 
sanction large-scale cyanide gold strip mining. Such practices will dry up 
surrounding wells and streams and destroy wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
There is a well-documented pattern of mismanagement by BLM in the California 
desert. There is a significant leadership vacuum at the highest levels of the 
Department of Interior and BLM. Congress must act quickly to protect the 
desert. The California Desert Protection Act, introduced by Sen. Alan Cranston 
(D-Calif.) and Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), would ensure that 3 million 
acres of the desert will be preserved as national parklands. The National Park 
Service, with its respected record on preservation, can be entrusted to enhance 
the unique natural qualities found throughout areas such as Death Valley, East 
Mojave and Joshua Tree. 
</P>
<P>
This transfer of land from BLM to the Park Service does not threaten to gut 
BLM's management role in the California desert. Under the Cranston-Levine 
legislation, there would be an additional 4.5 million acres of BLM wilderness 
to manage. Miners, off-road vehicles and other interests would also have 
approximately 4.5 million acres to work with, under BLM jurisdiction, of 
course.

IRAN: TOO EARLY TO TELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most savage tyranny of recent history ended with the death of Iran's 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini over the weekend. From his overthrow of the shah in 
1979 through his commitment of battalions of children to slaughter in the war 
against Iraq to the taking of hostages in the Middle East, Khomeini led with an 
unrelenting loathing for the West and a contempt for life. 
</P>
<P>
But the masses of grieving faithful around his glass coffin in Tehran and the 
quick decision on a successor to show that the clergy remains in control make 
it unlikely that major change in Iran's relations with the West are in 
prospect. Khomeini may have failed to export his revolution of Islamic 
fundamentalism, but it still will restrain any impulse for major change on the 
part of his immediate successor, President Ali Khamenei, or other leaders who 
may emerge after elections in August. That does not mean that Iran will, or 
should, forever stand apart from the global community of nations. It just means 
it will be along time before it feels free to make a conciliatory move toward 
the United States, Khomeini's "Great Satan," or other Western countries. 
</P>
<P>
It will take time even to discover whether the tyrant's death sentence imposed 
on author Salman Rushdie for writing "Satanic Verses" will be lifted. It will 
take even longer, no doubt, to discern the effect that his death will have on 
hostages taken in the Middle East by, or in behalf of, Iranians. Just which of 
several candidates for power, none of whom could carry the moral authority of 
Khomeini, will wind up on top is not clear. But being seen as soft on America 
by signaling an imminent end to the nightmare of hostages would almost 
certainly guarantee a candidate's winding up near the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
The Iran-Contra scandal gave the word moderate a bad name, but there are 
leaders and emerging leaders who understand that they need to heal relations 
with the West. They will have their day, as the memory of Khomeini fades.

MORNING BRIEFING: MANTLE CHOSE TO QUIT CALLING SIGNALS WHILE HE WAS AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mickey Mantle was only kidding when he told Yogi Berra that catching was 
overrated, but Yogi took him seriously, and therein lies a tale. 
</P>
<P>
"It was before a series with Detroit," Mantle told Phil Mushnick of the New 
York Post. "I was telling Yogi I could call pitches better than he could. I was 
just pulling his leg, but he got mad and we wound up in an argument. 
</P>
<P>
"So when it was Whitey Ford's turn to pitch, the three of us made a deal. I'd 
call the pitches from the outfield. If I bent over, it was a curve; if I stood 
up, fastball; and so on. Yogi'd throw back to Whitey, then Whitey would turn 
around to rub up the ball, and I'd give him the signal. Since it was Whitey, I 
mostly called for the curve. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it's about the seventh inning, and we're winning, 1-0. No kidding. 
That's when I'd had enough and I stopped. I got scared. I thought I'd give up a 
home run, or something." 
</P>
<P>
Add Mantle: Recalling the trade of Billy Martin to Kansas City, he said, "They 
said he was a bad influence on me. They traded him after the season I batted 
.353 with 52 home runs and 130 RBIs. Three years later, they found out the bad 
influence was Whitey Ford." 
</P>
<P>
Add Mushnick: Of Al McGuire's new three-year contract with NBC as a college 
basketball analyst, he wrote: "It's reportedly worth close to $500,000 a year, 
or roughly $100,000 for every current player he's heard of." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: When a golfer says, "I had a Red Grange," what does he mean? 
</P>
<P>
Attn., Al Davis: Auburn baseball Coach Hal Baird, asked which sport he thinks 
Bo Jackson will eventually choose, told the New York Times: "It's only my 
opinion, but I think football will be the thing to go. When he comes back here 
in the off-season, we always talk about the Raiders, but invariably he turns 
the conversation to George Brett and the Royals." 
</P>
<P>
Says Jackson: "Baseball was fun when I was in college. It's my job now. But I 
like my 3-to-11 shift. 
</P>
<P>
Says Brett, marveling at Jackson's build, especially since he doesn't lift 
weights: "I've never even seen him do a sit-up. I say to myself all the time, 
'I wish I could be in that body for just one day.' " 
</P>
<P>
It-had-to-happen Dept.: Said golf analyst Ken Venturi, as Don Pooley addressed 
a tap-in putt for par in the TPC: "Watch how smooth this is." 
</P>
<P>
Pooley smoothly bogeyed. 
</P>
<P>
Cow's that? Tim Flannery, quirky infielder for the San Diego Padres, tells USA 
Today why he uses old-model gloves: "Because of the Greenhouse effect, they've 
had to give the cows steroids. That's why the leather on the old gloves is 
better than the leather on the new ones." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: He shot a 77. That was Grange's number in football. 
</P>
<P>
Add Grange: One year when John McKay was coaching the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, a 
linebacker named Jeff Davis intercepted a pass and ran it back for a touchdown 
the first time he touched the ball as a professional. 
</P>
<P>
Said McKay: "I told the team that the last time that happened was when Red 
Grange did it, and they all just stared at me. They didn't know who the hell 
Red Grange was." 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Mitch (Blood) Green, oft-arrested heavyweight fighter, on why he 
doesn't fear going to jail: "When I go to the jailhouse, I run the jailhouse."

CARLSBAD VOTING TODAY ON HOTEL TAX, RECREATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carlsbad voters will decide today on whether to increase the city's hotel room 
tax from 8% to 10% to provide funds to build major recreational facilities, 
including two public golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad's 36,000 registered voters face two propositions in the special 
election: Proposition F seeks to raise the transient occupancy tax rate by 2%, 
with the revenue earmarked for the General Fund; Proposition G, an advisory 
measure, asks voters to approve the spending of more than $1 million in city 
funds to build recreational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the two propositions -- endorsed unanimously by Carlsbad's five 
council members -- will enable the city to pursue its long-sought goal of 
constructing two golf courses, a multicourt tennis complex, two multipurpose 
recreational fields and an enclosed soccer facility. The facilities are 
expected to cost from $6 million to $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Room Tax Raised Last Year 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the ballot measures, including the city's hotel and motel 
association, say the tax rise would inflate room rates and send tourists 
elsewhere. The room tax was already raised last year, from 6% to 8%. 
</P>
<P>
The Carlsbad Chamber of Commerce also opposes Proposition F, but backs 
Proposition G. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing is we feel Proposition F is unfairly hitting one industry for 
recreational facilities that will benefit everyone in the community," said Lee 
Bohlmann, chamber executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
But, advocates say, the recreational facilities would make Carlsbad more 
attractive and help boost tourism. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Mamaux said the recreational facilities would pay back 
residents who often bear the burdens of tourism -- crowds and traffic. The 
transient occupancy tax rate had stood at 6% for 23 years, from 1965 until 
1988, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Although city leaders' attempts to raise the hotel tax to pay for recreation 
have failed twice before, council members hope the third try will be a charm. 
</P>
<P>
In previous elections -- most recently last November -- ballot measures asked 
that tax-rise revenue be earmarked for recreational facilities. Such a 
provision requires two-thirds voter support. In each prior case, the tax rise 
failed to get the needed votes, but did receive majority support, proponents 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to avoid a similar defeat this time, city leaders drafted propositions 
that only need majority support for approval.

PLANS FOR NEW FACILITIES IN LEGAL LIMBO; 
</P>
<P>
JUDGE UPHOLDS REJECTION OF JAIL TAX OKD BY VOTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leaving San Diego County's plans for new jails and courts in legal limbo, a 
Superior Court judge Monday upheld his March ruling invalidating a half-cent 
sales tax narrowly approved by voters last June to raise $1.6 billion for 
criminal-justice facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Reaffirming his March 23 decision, Riverside County Superior Court Judge Gordon 
Burkhart rejected San Diego County officials' request that he set aside his 
earlier order that struck down Proposition A, thereby setting the stage for a 
possibly protracted appeals battle. 
</P>
<P>
In his decision, Burkhart declared the half-cent sales tax illegal on the 
grounds that its 50.6% countywide approval at the polls fell short of the 
two-thirds margin mandated by Proposition 13, the landmark 1978 property 
tax-cutting initiative approved by statewide voters in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Appeals of Burkhart's decision, expected to ultimately reach the state Supreme 
Court, could last as long as two years, according to lawyers on both sides of 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Collection to Continue 
</P>
<P>
During that period, the half-cent sales tax will continue to be collected, but 
county officials have indicated that the funds will not be spent unless 
Burkhart's order is overturned. 
</P>
<P>
If, on the other hand, the 4th District Court of Appeal and the California 
Supreme Court uphold the judge's ruling, the local sales tax would be 
temporarily rolled back to enable local consumers to recoup the funds 
"illegally" collected under Proposition A. 
</P>
<P>
Over its 10-year life, it is estimated, Proposition A, which raised the local 
sales tax to 7%, will generate $1.6 billion for new jails and courts to 
alleviate San Diego's longstanding jail crowding and a badly overextended court 
system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heard in Riverside County 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit against the tax, filed on behalf of leaders of the San Diego County 
Libertarian Party, was heard in Riverside County because of San Diego judges' 
conflict of interest in a matter affecting courtroom space. 
</P>
<P>
Officials representing San Diego County and the Regional Justice Facility 
Financing Agency, the board set up to administer Proposition A's revenues, 
argued that 1987 state legislation that set the stage for last June's 
Proposition A election stated that a majority vote would be sufficient for 
passage. 
</P>
<P>
The seven attorneys who filed the lawsuit for the Libertarians, however, 
described that 1987 bill as a sham that violated both the spirit and the letter 
of Proposition 13 -- an argument that Burkhart sided with in his ruling.

LAWMAKERS PAY LAST RESPECTS TO BRADLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the flag at the Capitol flying at half staff, the state Assembly was quiet 
during normal working hours Monday as many colleagues of the late Bill Bradley 
flew to San Diego to pay their respects at the funeral of the San Marcos 
Republican assemblyman. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, 70, died Thursday morning after a nearly four-year struggle against 
cancer, which was complicated by a chronic bleeding ulcer. 
</P>
<P>
Out of respect to the well-liked Bradley, lawmakers put off their business 
until Monday night or today. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we learned what time the funeral would be and we knew that 
everybody or most everybody wanted to attend because Bill Bradley was very 
popular, then we started making arrangements to change the session around," 
said Susan Jetton, press secretary to Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
Assembly committee meetings scheduled for Monday afternoon, normally a light 
work day anyway, were postponed until this morning. Usually, no committees meet 
Tuesday mornings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suspension Not Unusual 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Brown convened the full Assembly at 5 p.m. -- late enough to allow 
lawmakers to scramble back from San Diego -- to finish deliberations over a 
$50-billion version of the state budget package before it is delivered to an 
Assembly-Senate conference committee for final revisions. 
</P>
<P>
Suspending legislative business during the funeral of a lawmaker is not 
unusual, said R. Brian Kidney, the assembly's chief clerk. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever they've had a funeral of one of their own members, usually an 
extremely large contingent of the membership go," said Kidney. "If need be, 
they will work around that." 
</P>
<P>
Kidney said that the last time the Assembly suspended proceedings was when 
Assemblyman Richard E. Longshore (R-Santa Ana) died last June. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, a civil engineer and former San Marcos city manager who was first 
elected to the Assembly in 1982, was known more for his candor and low-keyed, 
nuts-and-bolts style than for legislative accomplishments. An ardent backer of 
property rights, Bradley often fought environmentalists over the right of the 
California Coastal Commission to restrict development along the coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley also helped free state funding for dyslexic students and advocated the 
mandatory death penalty for people convicted of killing children 7 years or 
younger. 
</P>
<P>
When he first learned in 1985 that he had terminal cancer of the liver and 
colon, Bradley announced that he would serve out his term and then retire. But 
he changed his mind and easily won re-election in 1986 after doctors 
successfully implanted a pump in his stomach to send chemotherapy to his 
afflicted liver.

BARRIO LOGAN KIDS GET A SPECIAL SUMMER OFFER: SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Summer school will be offered this year to as many as 115 elementary students 
in the Barrio Logan area as a result of an unusual collaboration between the 
San Diego city school district and UC San Diego, which school trustees are 
expected to approve today. 
</P>
<P>
The principal of Torrey Pines Elementary School in La Jolla has arranged for 
UCSD to help sponsor for two weeks in August transportation and special 
instruction for students -- and their parents -- who voluntarily bus to the 
school every day under the school district's integration program. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the schools in the students' neighborhoods are on year-round schedules 
and do not offer summer school within walking distance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transportation the Key 
</P>
<P>
"We've had an obvious concern that many of our (bused) kids don't have summer 
school opportunities," Principal Barry Bernstein said. "Many of these kids 
could benefit from a chance for some enrichment and motivation during the 
summer, but the main hurdle has always been to get them transportation," since 
many of the families have no cars. 
</P>
<P>
Students living in the La Jolla area have family transportation and are able to 
take advantage of summer school offered at nearby La Jolla and Pacific 
Beach-area schools, Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of limited district funding, Bernstein earlier this spring contacted 
UCSD officials with whom he has established an informal working relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Watson, UCSD vice chancellor for undergraduate affairs, said: "Bernstein 
approached us and indicated that, given our closeness to his school and our 
interest in having a diverse student body, it might be a good idea if UCSD 
would work with him to encourage students and parents to start thinking about 
college early." 
</P>
<P>
Watson oversees UCSD programs that encourage more minority students to attend 
college, which Watson believes must increasingly reach not only high school 
juniors and seniors, but students in elementary and junior high schools as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"We told Bernstein that his was an excellent idea, particularly if we can get 
both students and parents to think about getting a good, early, solid start on 
academic matters and develop skills early," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

He has made available about $1,000 in discretionary funds for transportation. 
In addition, teaching assistants from the UCSD Teacher Education Program will 
help in classrooms during the two-week session, as well as with parents who 
will visit both Torrey Pines and UCSD twice during the program. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to have more than just two weeks, and I know that there is a 
limitation to what we can do academically in that time," Bernstein said. "But 
the motivation and inspiration aspects will have an effect over the long run, 
and just as important for some of the children is the maintenance English 
program during the summer months, because many live in Spanish-speaking 
environments." 
</P>
<P>
The parent component will continue into the regular school year next fall, 
Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Watson said that, although the UCSD commitment is not "institutional in a major 
way," it could pave the way for larger future efforts with elementary schools, 
"particularly with community-initiated efforts." 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of optimism but also some caution. . . . This is a seeding 
effort but not a long-term commitment."

Occupants of two pickup trucks opened fire on each other in a blazing gun 
battle Monday night near the Fashion Valley shopping center that ended with one 
man dead and police searching for suspects. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified victim, who had been in one of the trucks, was pronounced dead 
at Sharp Memorial Hospital with a chest wound. His name was not released, 
pending notification of his family. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Timothy Smith said the shooting occurred about 7 p.m. as two groups of men 
in the trucks began shooting at each other as they drove south on Ulric Street, 
approaching Fashion Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Police found bullet casings from a 9-millimeter pistol, a .22-caliber handgun 
and a .45-caliber weapon in the area, but no suspects were immediately taken 
into custody. 
</P>
<P>
The truck with the wounded man in it stopped just north of Fashion Valley on 
Ulric. The other truck sped away. Paramedics were summoned, and the victim was 
taken by ambulance to the hospital.

The San Diego City Council on Monday authorized two studies to determine the 
proposed new civic center's impact on traffic and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted, 7 to 2, to spend $40,630 for an environmental impact 
analysis and $19,370 for a traffic impact analysis. The money is in addition to 
the $1.2 million already spent to purchase a parcel of property needed for the 
project and $200,000 for the work of consultants and city staff, said Deputy 
City Manager Maureen Stapleton. 
</P>
<P>
Pressed for office space, the council is proposing to build a $241-million City 
Hall complex in a 7-square-block area just south of San Diego City College and 
west of the new 14th street police headquarters. The plan may be expanded to 
include a $78-million Central Library. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Bruce Henderson and Judy McCarty voted against approving the 
studies, saying they believe there are less expensive alternatives to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager John Lockwood's office has recommended construction of the new 
City Hall as a cost-effective alternative to continuing to lease space in 
downtown office buildings.

<P>
The owner of eight horses killed for insurance money was sentenced Monday to 
one year in prison for defrauding an insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
Two others connected with the scheme, in which the horses were driven to their 
deaths in a trailer off Interstate 8 near Jacumba in 1983, were placed on 
probation and fined, but given no jail terms. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Paul, 53, of Keyes, Calif., received the one-year sentence from U. S. 
District Judge J. Lawrence Irving. Paul had pleaded guilty several months ago 
to mail fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the trailer, Leonard Autterson, 49, of Lakeside, and horse trader 
Bobby Griffin, 46, of Lufkin, Tex., received fines of $500 and $1,000. 
Autterson has previously served 10 months on a separate state conviction for 
animal cruelty. 
</P>
<P>
The judge ordered Griffin placed on 30 months' probation and Autterson on 36 
months' probation. 
</P>
<P>
Autterson and Griffin pleaded guilty in March, 1988, to conspiracy to defraud 
the Hartford Fire Insurance Co., which had insured the horses for $83,000. All 
of them could have received five years in federal prison and $250,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
Awaiting sentencing July 17 on a mail fraud conviction is Rocky Beene, 48, of 
Junction, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
The staged accident occurred May 16, 1983, while the horses were being shipped 
to Griffin, who is a well-known horse trader in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Originally two others were named in the 1988 indictment, but one of them, 
Martin Bailey, 44, of Santee, had all charges dismissed last year, and Beene's 
son, Brent Beene, 25, of Vandervordt, Ark., negotiated a "deferred prosecution" 
agreement, under which charges will be dismissed next year if he stays out of 
trouble.

WOMAN WHO STABBED COUPLE SENTENCED TO 6-YEAR PRISON TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A 23-year-old woman was sentenced Monday to six years in state prison for 
stabbing a Northridge couple who brought her to their home from a Hollywood 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
Aurora Harris of Durham, Calif., pleaded guilty in March to two counts of 
assault with a deadly weapon for attacking Edward Todd Hume, 26, and his 
girlfriend, Heather Mahoney, 17, in what Superior Court Judge John H. Farrell 
called "a frenzy of violence." 
</P>
<P>
Harris punctured Hume's lung with an eight-inch butcher knife and stabbed 
Mahoney three times. Harris met the victims when they and two friends, who had 
been drinking, picked her up in their rented limousine in front of the Cat 
House bar in Hollywood, Hume and Mahoney testified at a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Her attorney, Public Defender Nelda Barrett, said the Aug. 4 crime was the 
"tragic result" of Harris' abuse of prescription drugs. Before the stabbing, 
Harris admitted that she took codeine and also had several drinks, court 
documents state. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt that she wouldn't be before the court were it not for the 
abuse of drugs," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ken Barshop. 
</P>
<P>
Harris and her mother told court officials before the sentencing that Harris 
had planned to move back to Durham, near Redding, and enroll in a drug 
treatment program. 
</P>
<P>
Hume and Mahoney brought Harris to their home in the 17700 block of Kinzie 
Street because she told them that she had nowhere to spend the night, Barshop 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple said Harris could sleep on their living room sofa and went upstairs, 
court documents said. Hume later went downstairs to investigate after hearing a 
refrigerator door open. 
</P>
<P>
Hume said at the preliminary hearing that he found Harris spilling a wine 
cooler on the kitchen floor. He tried to push her out of the house and she 
stabbed him in the hip with a small kitchen knife, he said. Mahoney testified 
that she heard Hume scream, "I'm stabbed!" so she came downstairs and tried to 
wrestle the knife out of Harris' hands. Harris stabbed her twice in the arm and 
slashed her across the back as she tried to flee, Mahoney said. 
</P>
<P>
Harris then grabbed a butcher knife and stabbed Hume in the chest, Hume said. 
She was arrested shortly afterward while sitting in Hume's truck.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PROMOTER OF CAR SENT TO PRISON FOR EMBEZZLEMENT OF 
$2 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Encino resident who fled prosecution eight years ago has been 
sentenced to state prison for embezzling more than $2 million that he raised to 
market a three-wheeled car, which was never manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
G. Elizabeth Carmichael, 51, is expected to serve about 4 1/2 years of a 
2-to-20-year sentence imposed Friday by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David 
A. Horowitz, said his attorney, Joseph Shemaria. 
</P>
<P>
Carmichael, who considers himself a woman although he discontinued a sex change 
operation and remains biologically male, was sent to the men's prison system, 
but hopes to be placed in a special facility for transvestites, Shemaria said. 
</P>
<P>
Carmichael was convicted in 1977 on grand theft, corporate securities fraud and 
conspiracy charges, Shemaria said. The charges stemmed from Carmichael's 
operation of the now-defunct 20th Century Motor Car Corp. in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
Carmichael appealed the conviction, which was later upheld, and fled while 
facing imposition of the same sentence, Shemaria said. He was arrested April 20 
in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors charged that Carmichael embezzled investments in the Dale car, 
which Carmichael claimed could travel 70 m.p.h. using an electric elevator 
engine, Shemaria said. Three prototypes were built, but the car was never 
marketed. 
</P>
<P>
Shemaria said his client had "a good-faith belief in the product and an honest 
belief that the cars would be made and delivered. It was an unrealistic belief, 
however."

$13.7 MILLION FOR 16 ACRES; 
</P>
<P>
BURBANK AIRPORT TO BUY ADJACENT LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority voted Monday to spend $13.7 
million to purchase about 16 acres of land that may eventually be used for 
parking and taxiways. 
</P>
<P>
The authority voted 8 to 0 to approve the purchase. Commissioner Mary Lou 
Howard, who represents Burbank, was not present. 
</P>
<P>
Airport spokesman Victor Gill said no definite uses for the two properties have 
been determined yet, "but it's our policy to purchase land whenever it's 
contiguous to the airport." 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners voted to buy a 15.4-acre parcel where several machine shops 
and factories are located, south of Sherman Way and north of Clybourn Avenue, 
for $13.1 million from Lockheed Corp. Gill said the Lockheed property may be 
used for a taxiway parallel to the airport's east-west runway. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a one-acre parcel at Hollywood Way and Winona Avenue will be 
purchased from the Burbank Redevelopment Agency for $600,000. That property 
will probably be used for remote parking and could accommodate up to 200 cars, 
airport spokeswoman Elly Mixsell said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tested for Contamination 
</P>
<P>
Mixsell said the Lockheed parcel will be tested for soil contamination and 
toxic chemicals, although it is not thought to be contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
The company is using a $4-million treatment system to clean chemically tainted 
ground water beneath its Burbank plant. The state Water Quality Control Board 
has said the Lockheed plant contributed to pollution of ground water that 
forced the closure of more than 30 municipal water wells in Burbank and North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed will vacate the property by December, and environmental work will be 
completed by June 30, 1990, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed is transferring virtually all manufacturing, parts fabrication and 
engineering activities to newer facilities in Palmdale, Rye Canyon and 
Marietta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
The purchases will bring the total area of the airport to around 450 acres, 
officials said. The state law that established the airport authority allows the 
airport to grow in acreage, but prohibits the lengthening of its two runways, 
Gill said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA CLARITA FIRES CITY PLANS EXAMINER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Clarita city officials on Monday fired a plans examiner who is under 
investigation for allegedly using his position with the city to steer private 
consulting work to himself. 
</P>
<P>
At the city's request, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is 
investigating, Sheriff's Lt. Harvey Cantor said. Cantor identified the employee 
as Miguel Enrique Zepeda-Vaquero, 43, of Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager Ken Pulskamp announced Zepeda-Vaquero's dismissal 
Monday, but would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Zepeda-Vaquero is an employee of Willdan Associates, a consulting firm working 
for the city, and served as a building and safety plans examiner, Cantor said. 
He said city officials accused Zepeda-Vaquero of offering to perform work for 
citizens privately, rather than referring those inquiries to the city.

CLARK LEADS PADRES PAST ASTROS, 10-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURT HOLBREICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With one powerful swing of the bat, Jack Clark not only sent a ball over the 
Astrodome fence Monday night, he began to openly cleanse himself of the 
confusion and frustration that has stalked him through the worst start of his 
13-year career. 
</P>
<P>
The two-run homer was only part of a 10-2 Padre victory that ended the Houston 
Astros' club-record 10-game winning streak and broke a three-game Padre losing 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
But after the game, Clark didn't want to talk so much about the home run, his 
first since May 16, as his he did about what has gone through his mind the past 
few months. 
</P>
<P>
His off-season trade to the Padres from the New York Yankees was supposed to be 
a new start, instead it began as the worst time in his baseball life. Not 
because of San Diego, not because of the Padres, not because of the fans, but 
because of what was swirling in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming over here was a breath of fresh air, but it doesn't last forever," 
Clark said. "They expect you to hit. Where are the results? I felt bad for Jack 
(McKeon) and for the fans. I felt bad for San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably was not enjoying baseball as much as ever." 
</P>
<P>
On the field, Clark was struggling. A .273-career hitter, his average stood at 
.193 on May 24. That was before he started a 10-game hitting streak (15 for 37) 
that has raised his average to .240, his highest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't consider myself a .300 hitter," Clark said. "But I knew I'm better 
than a .190 hitter. If that is the best I can generate, I don't deserve to be 
playing. But what do they do? Sit down a guy making all that money? But they 
figure they have to play me. They have to get their money's worth." 
</P>
<P>
Clark said the streak has coincided with a change in how he views his role with 
the Padres. He decided to just get hits, any hits. Forget about home runs, just 
get on base. 
</P>
<P>
He took it slowly. Until his home run and a double in the fifth, 12 of the 
previous 13 hits in his streak were singles. The only exception was one double. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon had talked to Clark a few days ago on just that topic. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him forget about the home runs," McKeon said. "I told him the Jack 
Clark I remember in St. Louis was hitting balls in the gaps, singles, doubles. 
If he does that, the home runs will come." 
</P>
<P>
But recent events began to make Clark think. He watched Mike Schmidt break down 
in tears while announcing his retirement from the Philadelphia Phillies. And he 
was moved. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear a Mike Schmidt say that the edge isn't there like it used to be," 
Clark said. "I sort of lost that, too, maybe. If it is not fun anymore then 
maybe I shouldn't be trying to play. You wonder how long you want to continue? 
That hit real close to home with me." 
</P>
<P>
He saw the pictures of the protesting students in Beijing dying in the cause of 
freedom. And he was moved. 
</P>
<P>
"I make an error like last night and everybody is down," Clark said. "Then I 
look at the world situation in China and that puts it in perspective. I realize 
baseball is not that big a deal." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Clark said he had put too much pressure on himself -- because of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to do well there (in New York) because people in St. Louis would have 
said, 'See he failed anyhow and with all that money -- 2 million bucks.' Even 
in San Diego people expect to get $2 million of hits out of Jack Clark. But 
money doesn't buy the hits. If it did, I would spend most of it to get them." 
</P>
<P>
What 18,238 in the Astrodome saw Monday was the Padres' biggest offensive 
performance in 239 games. Not since a 10-2 victory over Houston on Sept. 12, 
1987, had they scored in double digits, the longest such drought in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
Their 17 hits were a season high, topping the 14 against Philadelphia May 30. 
</P>
<P>
They saw Ed Whitson's seventh consecutive victory. And a four-for-five night 
from Tony Gwynn to raise his average to .344. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres wasted no time picking on a Houston pitching staff that had been 
stretched to the limit after two extra-inning, weekend victories over the 
Dodgers that totaled 35 innings. 
</P>
<P>
They scored four times in the first three innings off starter Mark Portugal to 
give Whitson a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Portugal, who was acquired in the off-season from Minnesota, was called up 
Monday from the Astros' triple-A team in Tucson. The Astros needed him because 
the scheduled starter, Jim Clancy, pitched the final six innings of a 5-4, 
22-inning victory over the Dodgers in a game that took seven hours and 14 
minutes to play and lasted until 2:50 a.m. CDT Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Right fielder Bip Roberts started the game with a single, the sixth consecutive 
game as leadoff batter he started the Padres with a hit. After Roberto Alomar 
struck out, Roberts stole second. He scored when Gwynn singled to left. It was 
the fourth time in those six games that Gwynn drove in Roberts after he opened 
with a hit. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres stretched their 1-0 lead to 4-0 in the third. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who hit only two home runs in a weekend three-game series in 
Cincinnati, hit two in the third inning off Portugal. Both to right field. 
</P>
<P>
Alomar broke out a zero-for-14 streak with a one-out, solo homer, his second 
and first since May 7 in Pittsburgh. And after Gwynn singled, Clark homered 
into the screen above the left-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
The two homers in the same inning were the first time the Padres had done so 
since April 18 against Rick Reuschel in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros cut the lead in half to 4-2 in the bottom of the inning on an RBI 
single by center fielder Gerald Young and a run-scoring single by second 
baseman Bill Doran.

Perhaps by force of habit, Brian Quinn walked to the back of the empty locker 
room and sat on his chair. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn has been part of four Socker championships, the makings of which he has 
discussed repeatedly while sitting in this very spot. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, after receiving a massage in the training room, he was talking again. 
</P>
<P>
With five points in the past two games, Quinn, the team captain, is a victory 
away from his fifth title. The six-time champion Sockers lead the Baltimore

Game 6 would be played in Baltimore Thursday.

<P>
It is easy to tell Quinn's enthusiasm for the sport hasn't been lost in the 
Sockers' success. When he speaks of his career, you don't detect a hint of 
ho-hum. 
</P>
<P>
The game has always fascinated him. As a kid in Ireland, he once scored nine 
goals in a week and was then forced to sit on the bench the following week for 
using language a wee bit too colorful for an 11-year-old. Known for his 
aggressiveness, Quinn has been a sort of ringmaster of this team that, with its 
variety of personalities and temperaments, often has been a circus. He loves 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing else I'm probably ever going to do in my life that's going to 
be as much fun as this," he says. "I'm a sports-oriented person." 
</P>
<P>
And the fans continually remind him there is a certain importance to this 
profession. He will speak of the Sockers' arrival at the airport after being 
eliminated from the '86-87 championship series. Fans were waiting, crying. 
</P>
<P>
"Literally in tears," Quinn says. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the friends at home who told Quinn they had to turn the 
television off when Game 2 in Baltimore went into overtime. Watching made them 
too nervous. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you don't realize how fanatical those fans are," he says. "The 
people of San Diego have really adopted us." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly support at home for the Sockers in this series far exceeds what the 
Blast received in Baltimore, where barely 6,000 spectators showed up for each 
of the two games. More than 11,000 attended each game in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
As the enthusiasm builds in San Diego, life at home for the Quinn family has 
adapted to Brian's soccer schedule. Brian's wife, Sharon, knows how important 
championships are to her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife puts everything on hold," Quinn said. "The kids haven't gotten any 
attention the last three weeks.' 
</P>
<P>
Quinn has four children. One day, each child will receive one of his 
championship rings. 
</P>
<P>
To Quinn, the rings indicate more than just championships. They reflect the way 
the championships have been won. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers have had their share of individual stars, the Veees, Segotas and 
Zunguls. But this team seems to have a knack for pulling together, ignoring its 
differences and blending nicely when the playoffs arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to have that close-knittedness," Quinn said. "There are a lot of 
good individual players that don't have MISL rings. We have our rings to look 
back on." 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, the Sockers are in position to secure this series in San Diego, 
saving themselves the trouble of another trip to Baltimore. Momentum, as well 
as history, favors them. The Sockers are 8-0 against Baltimore in home playoff 
games. 
</P>
<P>
After losing its top defender, Bruce Savage, to an ankle sprain, the Blast has 
been noticeably less effective defensively. 
</P>
<P>
Missed opportunities, coupled with the acrobatic efforts of goalie Scott 
Manning, helped keep the Sockers from running away with Sunday's game, which 
they won, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Coach Ron Newman remains cautious, though he admits he likes what he has 
seen so far. 
</P>
<P>
"We've still got to play a complete game (tonight)," he said. "I think what 
happened (Sunday) was good. We proved that we can come back." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers can almost taste it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're so close," midfielder Branko Segota said. "The only thing that would be 
nice is to play in front of a sellout crowd."

LSU GETS TO ABBOTT, ELIMINATES CS LONG BEACH

<P>
A day that began with so much happiness ended on a bitter note for Cal State 
Long Beach pitching ace Kyle Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
Tookie Johnson's three-run double in a six-run third inning powered Lousiana 
State to an 8-5 victory over Long Beach in a College World Series elimination 
game Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott (15-3) lasted only 2 1/3 innings, giving up seven runs, all but one 
earned. He allowed three hits and walked five while striking out one. 
</P>
<P>
A few hours earlier, Abbott had been the ninth player selected in the major 
league amateur player draft, taken in the first round by the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"Draft day affected me," Abbott said. "I felt loose but I couldn't get the ball 
down. I was a little under-intense." 
</P>
<P>
LSU Coach Skip Bertman said: "It's unfair the draft is on the same day the kid 
is going to pitch. It's tough. Getting Abbott out of the game was a key. Any 
time you get a No. 1 draft choice out of the game it's got to help." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Coach Dave Snow said: "The six-run inning was our downfall. Kyle was 
under a lot of pressure with the draft and all. He was a little bit wild. We 
had expectations to play quality baseball." 
</P>
<P>
The loss sent Long Beach home with a 50-15 record after two CWS defeats. The 
49ers were making the school's first trip to the NCAA baseball championship 
after a 14-45 season a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
LSU (54-16) advances to tonight's elimination game against the loser of the 
Texas-Miami game, which was played later Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers jumped to an 8-0 lead after three innings, taking advantage of 
Abbott's control problems. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Bianco walked and Phil Espinosa reached first on catcher interference to 
open the second. Both moved up when catcher Perry Sanchez's pickoff throw to 
second went into center and they scored on Scott Schneidewind's one-out double 
to right-center. 
</P>
<P>
In the third, Keith Osik led off the LSU inning with a walk, went to third on 
Craig Cala's one-out single and scored on a Bianco single. Espinosa and Matt 
Gruver walked to force in one run and Abbott left for reliever Robby Corsaro. 
</P>
<P>
Corsaro struck out Schneidewind, then walked Pete Bush for another run before 
Johnson doubled to left to score three more for an 8-0 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers came back with two runs each in the fourth and sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Guggiana and Don Barbara opened with doubles in the fourth and scored on 
Dan Berthel's double to left. 
</P>
<P>
Guggiana singled to start the sixth and went to second on a wild pitch. After 
Berthel walked, Perry Sanchez flew out deep to center, allowing Guggiana to 
move to third. He scored on Deryk Hudson's single. Todd Lloyd then doubled to 
score Berthel to cut the LSU lead to 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
Berthel added his second home run of the year, a 400-foot shot to left-center, 
with one out in the eighth inning to finish LSU starter Curtis Leskanic (15-2). 
</P>
<P>
Paul Byrd came on in relief to pick up his first save on the year, retiring the 
final four 49ers he faced. 
</P>
<P>
"I was emotionally drained by the fifth inning," said Leskanic, whose win set a 
school record for most victories in a season. "I was really tired." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bertman: "On a wholesale basis, Curtis did a great job. Everybody's got to 
contribute in order for you to win. I was disappointed we were shut down from 
the third inning on." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach's Corsaro and Thomas Urbani allowed only two hits after the third. 
But the three 49er throwers gave up nine walks -- five by Abbott, three by 
Corsaro and one by Urbani -- and five of those runners scored.

BRADBURY, CAREY, REYES SELECTED IN DRAFT

San Diego area players Miah Bradbury, Frank Carey and Glen Reyes were selected 
Monday on the first day of baseball's amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes, a track and football standout at Orange Glen High School, had not played 
baseball since his freshman year but was picked by the Houston Astros in the 
early rounds. Reyes, drafted as an infielder, is a three-time section sprint 
champion, winning the 100-meter dash two consecutive years and the 200-meter 
dash this year. In football, he caught 24 passes, averaging 18.2 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Carey, a second baseman who will graduate from Stanford this month, was 
selected by the San Francisco Giants. Carey was a four-year starter helping the 
Cardinal win College World Series championships in 1987 and 1988. At Granite 
Hills High, he set the section career stolen base mark with 95. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury, a catcher from Mt. Carmel High who played at Loyola Marymount the 
past three years, was picked in the sixth round by the Philadelphia Phillies, 
the same team which selected him out of high school. Bradbury, a junior, hit 
.400 with six homers and 45 RBIs for the Lions this season. DAVE McKIBBEN and

THE DRUG CLINIC: ALCOHOLISM AND 'WILLFUL MISCONDUCT' CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOSEPH A. PURSCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Has anything been done about the recent Supreme Court decision that 
said that the disabling effects of chronic alcoholism are considered to be the 
result of willful misconduct? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The Supreme Court decision that you are referring to was made in April, 
1988, in the case of Traynor and McKelvey vs. the Veterans Administration. It 
said, in effect, that these two veterans, who are recovering alcoholics, were 
ineligible to get an extension to utilize GI educational benefits. The decision 
sparked a lot of indignation -- both pro and con. It also marshaled an 
organized effort by the National Council on Alcoholism Inc. to change the 
Supreme Court decision. 
</P>
<P>
Congress enacted legislation on Oct. 20, 1988, that said, "The disabling 
effects of chronic alcoholism shall not be considered to be the result of 
willful misconduct." The President signed this legislation Nov. 18, 1988. Since 
then the Veterans Administration has instructed all of its affiliates that the 
new legislation is in effect. Anyone who may have regained eligibility for 
educational benefits through the change should contact his or her local VA 
office.

THERE'S NO RIGHT ANSWER TO THIS QUERY ABOUT SEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I have been in a relationship with a man for about three years, and 
so far it has been very satisfactory except for one thing. I'm not a frigid 
woman, but he wants to have sex a lot more often than I do. I would appreciate 
it if you would let me know what is considered the normal number of times for a 
couple to have sexual relations, either for a week or over a month. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You are asking a question for which there is no answer. There is no 
such standard as a "normal" level of sexual activity. It would be just as 
inaccurate to say that one person is abnormally interested in sex because his 
sexual desire apparently is stronger than yours, as it would be to say that you 
are abnormally disinterested in sex because your sexual desire apparently is 
weaker than his. 
</P>
<P>
Q: There seems to be so much divorce these days that I don't think that people 
who get married really expect to spend the rest of their lives together. The 
ones who get hurt the most are the children. Don't these children who come from 
families where there's been a divorce have more psychological problems? 
</P>
<P>
A: The loss of a parent through divorce does not seem to be as important a 
factor in determining a child's future emotional adjustment than the quality of 
home life following the divorce. In one study of adults who had experienced the 
loss of a parent when they were children, a history of psychological problems 
was found to depend on the quality of the home life, including the relationship 
between the child and the remaining or surviving parent. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I don't recommend that athletes should use steroids or any drugs like that 
because they are too dangerous. But I've come to the conclusion that some 
athletes would perform better if they weren't so keyed up before a game. In 
such cases, wouldn't a drink to settle them down sound like a pretty good idea? 
</P>
<P>
A: Some people who drink do claim that alcohol raises their level of 
self-confidence, and a self-confident athlete may be a better athlete. But 
alcohol also tends to impair the athlete's psychomotor performance. 
</P>
<P>
For example, an athlete who drinks before an event will find that his or her 
reaction time has deteriorated, as has hand-eye coordination and other motor 
skills. This can be seen most clearly in sports that call for rapid reactions, 
such as basketball, football and tennis. It should go without saying that 
automobile racing drivers should not use alcohol as a means of boosting their 
self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
In brief, alcohol will not have a beneficial effect on any bodily function that 
would enhance performance. 
</P>
<P>
Q: For many years I've been under the impression that one of the things that 
makes pasta such a good choice for a meal is that it doesn't have any 
cholesterol. My sister says that that's just not true. Was I wrong all these 
years? 
</P>
<P>
A: Pasta made from flour and water does not contain cholesterol. Pasta made 
with egg yolks (for example, egg noodles) does contain some cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
Q: It's easy to see why children have to eat a lot more once they enter 
adolescence, but I doubt that girls should eat as much as boys. Am I correct in 
this observation? 
</P>
<P>
A: Teen-age girls require about 20% fewer calories than do teen-age boys. The 
reason is that girls normally add fat tissue as they mature, while boys 
generally add muscle tissue, and fat needs fewer calories to maintain.

ART BUCHWALD: DEER HUNTERS GET THE DROP ON BAMBI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every so often the question arises -- why do Americans need semiautomatic 
weapons to kill deer? Even the President is concerned that if he bans domestic 
assault weapons he would be hurting the rights of sportsmen. 
</P>
<P>
In order to understand why you need a semiautomatic for sport, you have to go 
back in history before these guns played such an important role in splatting 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
Once upon a time there lived a very ferocious deer named Bambi (also known as 
Bambi the Bully), who roamed hither and yon with a gang of terrifying animals, 
including squirrels, rabbits and chipmunks. They preyed on innocent hunters and 
sportsmen who just wanted to enjoy the outdoors with their dogs. Bambi had 
hoofs that could trample a mushroom to death. He also had sharp teeth that 
could scare a butterfly out of a duck blind. He was truly the most dangerous 
animal in the forest. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the power of Bambi and his henchman, Thumper, a killer rabbit, that it 
didn't take long before many hunters were afraid to go into the woods. 
</P>
<P>
One day Bambi was out looking for food with his mother when he heard shots. He 
became furious and turned to face the men who had fired them. As soon as they 
saw the look of maniacal hatred in Bambi's eyes, the hunters fell to their 
knees, and one of them cried, "Don't hurt us. The Constitution says we have a 
right to rat-a-tat-tat." 
</P>
<P>
"Guns don't kill deer," the other hunter yelled, "deer kill people." 
</P>
<P>
At this point, Bambi stuck his antlers into the hunters' backsides and they ran 
away. The owl hooted, the frogs croaked and the foxes ran in circles. 
</P>
<P>
The screaming hunters made straight for the headquarters of the National Gun 
Lovers Society where they breathlessly told their story to Charlton Heston. Gun 
lovers at the target range heard the tale and decided to hang Bambi in effigy 
-- and boycott his movies. 
</P>
<P>
A man shouted to the armed multitudes, "The reason we can't go into the forest 
is because we don't have enough fire power to protect ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Someone in the crowd yelled back, "Give us the guns so that we can do the job." 
</P>
<P>
Another person said, "Unless we have heavier magazines, we'll never thin out 
the herds." 
</P>
<P>
The rally went on all afternoon. Finally, because the gun lovers had done so 
much to get the President elected, they went to see him to make their pitch. 
</P>
<P>
They related the story of Bambi and how he was destroying the pleasures of deer 
shooting. To emphasize their point, the two hunters took down their pants and 
showed the President what Bambi had done. 
</P>
<P>
The President, who had seen a lot of terrible sights during World War II, was 
never more horrified. He decided that the only way to protect deer hunters was 
to allow them to purchase the assault weapon of their choice, without any 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
Once permission was granted, thousands of gun lovers traded in their rifles for 
semiautomatics. Now the battle between deer and the American sportsman is even. 
People who have seen Bambi in the woods say he is no longer the cocky, vicious 
stag he used to be. He has been hiding in the thicket, as has Thumper the 
rabbit. Thanks to semiautomatic weapons, the Bambis of this world will never 
frighten a hunter again.

NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK GIVE FANS THE THRILL OF PUPPY LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Little girl" isn't always just a figure of speech in pop music. 
</P>
<P>
Few audiences at any kind of concert are as homogenous as the one that showed 
up to shriek along with the New Kids on the Block, currently riding high with a 
No. 1 hit, in the first of two shows Sunday at the Celebrity Theatre in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about narrowcasting: A good 80% of the full house was made up of screaming 
girls under the age of 16, caught up in a frenzied kind of puppy love largely 
unwitnessed since Donny Osmond was retired from lunch pails and book covers. 
</P>
<P>
Though the wholesomely insipid New Kids have made their reputation as a white 
vocal group that sounds black, it seems safe to assume from the predominance of 
white faces at the Celebrity that black kids don't think the New Kids sound all 
that black. 
</P>
<P>
The supposed blackness of the sound has more to do with the insistent dance 
beat than with any vocal soulfulness. The high-pitched, castrato-like whine of 
Joe McIntyre recalls a pre-teen Donny or Jimmy Osmond much more than pre-teen 
Michael Jackson, and none of the more grown-up tones of his four fellow singing 
'n' dancing Kids is going to make anyone forget Bobby Brown, much less James 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
(Incidentally, though it was not always easy to tell what might have been on 
tape at Sunday's matinee and what wasn't, it seemed almost certain that the 
lead vocals of McIntyre -- at 16, the youngest member of the troupe -- were 
more Memorex than live. Could it be that the poor Kid has to lip-sync those 
high parts because, shudder, his voice has changed?) 
</P>
<P>
Musical attributes were of small concern to the gals on hand. It had more to do 
with hope -- the hope that one of the Kids might look your way, or much better 
yet might point your way, or most dreamily of all would actually touch your 
hand, which you would then be compelled to refrain from washing for days. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate dream, of course, was to be kissed by a Kid, but only one little 
gal of about 5 in the front row had that honor. Later on, the Kids brought her 
up on stage for a moment, provoking one older girl, jealous with rage, to 
mutter, "That little girl's gotten kissed and everything." That little girl 
might have been dead meat if she had wandered out unaccompanied among her 
fellow fans after the show. 
</P>
<P>
The Kids' ingenuous pre-teen appeal was enhanced by the in-the-round staging of 
the Celebrity Theatre. With the band hidden in a pit, the five lads were free 
to skip in concentric circles around the revolving stage, and even when they 
faced off in one direction for some choreography at their mike stands, the lead 
singer on that particular number would roam around and play to the other side 
of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
To their credit, the Kids -- who currently range in age from 16 to 19 -- don't 
yet seem like cynical, street-wise show-biz youths. Their smiles seem genuine 
(who wouldn't smile getting that kind of adoration that early in life?), and 
when they dance they look at each other with slightly goofy grins, like 
real-live teen boys do. 
</P>
<P>
But they are old enough to have learned how to patronize, and the 
not-so-tightly scripted between-song shtick grew increasingly belabored and 
unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
Introducing the title song of the current "Hangin' Tough" album, Donny Wahlberg 
(apparently the bohemian of the group with his beret, his itsy-bitsy ponytail 
and his peace symbols) exhorted, "This is our personal anthem. What we want to 
do is make this your personal anthem too. Therefore, the result would be our 
national anthem." 
</P>
<P>
The tune, of course, is just another mindless dance ditty, with the group's 
moniker thrown in for extra name recognition. Thanks, Donny, but we'll stick 
with F. Scott Key for now. 
</P>
<P>
The inevitable defense for any of this pabulum is that it's kids' stuff and, 
therefore, beneath criticism. To which the inevitable reply would be: There's 
no law -- written, natural or otherwise -- that says kids can't have taste too. 
</P>
<P>
The New Kids on the Block return to town June 25, when they'll open for Tiffany 
at the Universal Amphitheatre.

"Indiana Jones" star Harrison Ford will be visiting a different kind of temple 
of doom this week as he observes murder trials in Detroit Recorder's Court to 
prepare for a film role as a prosecutor. Ford has been cast as Rozat (Rusty) 
Sabich, a chief assistant prosecutor accused of murder in "Presumed Innocent," 
a movie based on the Scott Turow novel of the same name. After Mirage

Burbank-based NBC correspondent Dan Molina, who worked at the network's Houston 
bureau until it was closed last year, has been reassigned again, this time as 
NBC's Chicago bureau chief, the network said Monday. Jim Cummins, who had held 
the Chicago post, will become NBC's Southwest Bureau chief and correspondent 
when NBC decides where that new bureau (formerly in Houston) will be located.

The Grammy Awards show will stay at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles for 
another year rather than return to New York, largely due to Los Angeles' 
"stellar" efforts as the host of this year's show, the head of the 
Grammy-sponsoring National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences said Monday. 
The Grammys were moved from Los Angeles to New York in 1988, and it had been 
expected that the show would alternate between the two show-business capitals. 
"It was a big hit," NARAS President Michael Green said of the work done by 
Mayor Tom Bradley's official host committee. He noted the showcasing of 
different music styles in local clubs and the "Grammy in the Schools" program 
that sent professional musicians to visit city schools. "Los Angeles did a 
great job, so we're rewarding them and ourselves by coming back," Green said. 
As for New York, the Big Apple will host a nationally televised NARAS event in 
November and will have another shot at winning the Grammy show for 1991. ALEENE

ORGANIST MARY PRESTON OPENS BAROQUE FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Solid music making mixed with a few flawed moments marked the opening of the 
ninth annual Corona del Mar Baroque Music Festival on Sunday night at St. 
Michael and All Angels Church. 
</P>
<P>
Organist Mary Preston was on hand in an evening of works from various 
historical periods for solo organ and for organ and strings. 
</P>
<P>
Most uncommon were performances of two recently discovered Baroque English 
organ concertos, one by John Stanley and the other by a composer known only as 
Mr. Edwards. The scores were discovered last year in London by Burton Karson, 
the artistic director for the festival and conductor of the festival orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards' concerto proved a simple composition with occasional moments of 
interest. Undoubtedly influenced by Handel -- a very young Handel -- the work 
is not ambitious and certainly not a masterpiece, but worth the attentive 
performance it received. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley's concerto, on the other hand, was a dull, academic exercise. Most of 
the time, the organ part simply doubled what was going on in the orchestra, 
offering little variation or musical ideas that were particularly memorable. 
</P>
<P>
Karson deftly conducted his ensemble, demonstrating restraint and preparedness. 
The orchestra responded appropriately, yielding an accurate, spirited 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
Preston played the small 24-rank organ with power and varied, tasteful 
registrations. Occasionally, there were lapses and mistakes that may have been 
the result of unfamiliarity with the mechanics of the instrument. 
</P>
<P>
Yet her prowess as an organist was aptly displayed in her selection of solo 
works, which included a confident, moving performance of Mozart's Fantasia in F 
minor. Franck's Prelude, Fugue and Variation equally shared the spotlight, as 
Preston utilized a sturdy technique and deep understanding of the intricacies 
of the Romantic style. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest disappointment of the evening was a tentative, lackluster 
performance of Poulenc's Concerto in G minor, an often bombastic work for 
organ, orchestra and timpani. Karson's forces suffered intonation problems 
throughout as Preston struggled to project some energy out of the muddy 
harmonies and sforzando chords.

FEMMES REACH FOR SPIRITUALITY, SETTLE FOR RUCKUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Though the recording of the Violent Femmes' most recent album "3" doubtlessly 
did not eat up a "Born in the U.S.A."-size budget, the band might have been 
better off buying a $4 blank cassette and recording its show Sunday at the 
Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Where "3" often comes off as a pale, precious shadow of the band's 1983 debut 
album, its songs were pounded home with life and distinction by singer Gordon 
Gano and Co. before a boisterously adoring capacity crowd. (The Femmes are also 
scheduled to appear Wednesday at San Diego's California Theatre and Friday at 
the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles.) 
</P>
<P>
Despite the heretical presence of electric guitars, a full drum set and adjunct 
synth and horn players to crank up the trio's formerly spare acoustic sound, 
the ever-precocious Gano was direct and effecting in presenting his spiny 
fables of seeking spirituality in a complex and confounding world. 
</P>
<P>
Gano has apparently recovered from his side project, the Mercy Seat, a band so 
set in the rightness of Christian conviction that it evidently felt no need to 
support it with even marginally inspired music. Though possessing negligible 
skill on the guitar and a whiny voice that hunters could use to lure ferrets 
from their dens, Gano marshaled those limited attributes into an 
often-arresting performance. 
</P>
<P>
Alongside the classic violence of such debut-album crowd favorites as "Add It 
Up," "Gone Daddy Gone" and the anarchic "Kiss Off," Gano applied an equal rage 
to the current "Mother of a Girl" and "World We're Living In." On the latter he 
conveyed a true agony over the perplexity of living in a time when "my brother 
is not my lover" and "my neighbor is not my savior," with the band backing his 
troubled voice with a roiling world beat. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, the personal devotion of "Outside the Palace" was delivered with a 
delicacy and mood that recalled Dylan's "Love Minus Zero, No Limit." 
</P>
<P>
While the thicket of sound raised by Gano, antic drummer Victor DeLorenzo and 
bass-solo monster Brian Ritchie reinforced Gano's lyrics, it also proved too 
limited a musical palette to fully sustain the 23-song set. For much of the 
show, they left the emotion-o-meter switch on "rampage," and, along with 
Ritchie's bass sometimes eclipsing Gano's singing, by show's end the 
undifferentiated ruckus ceased to have any effect. 
</P>
<P>
The other weakness in the show was that, oddly, Gano's least-inspired moments 
came in the set's directly inspirational numbers, his gospel-tinged "Faith" and 
"Jesus Walking on the Water." Despite some competent fiddle sawing from Gano on 
the latter tune, the numbers came off as flat and dogmatic. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike passion players Van Morrison and Al Green, who most definitely are in 
another class, Gano seems much better at confronting the problems of 
spirituality than its glories. 
</P>
<P>
While not nearly as original as the headliners, the L.A.-based Show of Hands 
delivered a strong opening set that drew heavily on the sound of the early-'60s 
folk boom. Sporting a Peter, Paul and Mary-type lineup (one woman and two 
guitar-toting guys), the trio avoided comparisons with the Washington Squares, 
similarly aligned East Coast folkie revivalists. Where the Squares' 
otherwise-well-crafted harmonies are blunted by their bereted novelty-nostalgia 
pose, Show of Hands seemed much more concerned with the future than the past. 
</P>
<P>
Their set ranged from spoken-word, T-Bone Burnett-ish abstracts of L.A. life to 
the Billy Bragg-covered "Think Again," which posits that a Soviet nation that 
lost 20 million people in its last major war may not be so gung ho on starting 
another one. 
</P>
<P>
The group's strongest original was "Man of Principle," which, rather than the 
finger-pointing schisms common to '60s folk, instead blamed the easy 
compromises made in daily life: "I wouldn't shoot another man/But I'll pay for 
the gun/. . . Another man of principle." 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with swelling voices -- reminiscent of early Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash 
in their harmonic complexity, only edgier -- the trio's songs make the band 
something to catch.

CHINA TEETERS ON EDGE OF CIVIL WAR AS RIVAL FORCES MOBILIZE; 
</P>
<P>
BATTLE FOR CONTROL OF BEIJING SEEN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China teetered this morning on the edge of civil war, with troops presumed 
loyal to hard-line President Yang Shangkun in control of central Beijing but 
positioned defensively at strategic points in apparent anticipation of attack 
by rival forces. 
</P>
<P>
Troops and armored vehicles were reported moving toward Beijing from the east, 
according to Western diplomats who said they appeared to be opposed to the 
troops of the 27th Army that killed hundreds or perhaps thousands of people 
while taking control of the center of the capital over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
A military attache in the British colony of Hong Kong, reached by telephone 
this morning, said the Chinese air force has joined the effort to wrest control 
of Beijing Faxes from the 27th Army. Infantry units of the air force landed at 
the Nanyuan military airport south of the capital Monday night and engaged in 
skirmishes with other military units at or near the airport, the attache said. 
</P>
<P>
The air force believes that responsibility for the indiscriminate shootings in 
Beijing rests with the army, the attache said. The air force is headed by Wang 
Hai, who canceled a planned trip to Europe last week apparently to remain in 
Beijing during the intra-military feuding. 
</P>
<P>
Other small-scale duels broke out between rival troops Monday, according to 
Western witnesses, only about one mile west of Tian An Men Square, now 
controlled by thousands of 27th Army soldiers with hundreds of armored 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tanks Fan Out 
</P>
<P>
At about 7 p.m. Monday, tanks accompanied by armored personnel carriers and 
truckloads of troops fanned out to points along the Second Ring Road that loops 
around the main part of the city. This area includes Tian An Men Square, the 
Great Hall of the People and Zhongnanhai, the red-walled compound from which 
China's leaders have traditionally ruled, and the city's older residential and 
commercial districts. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 tanks continued to stand guard this morning at the Jianguomen bridge 
on the eastern side of the city, about half facing east in defensive positions. 
The others faced north, south and west to control access to the strategically 
important bridge, which crosses the Second Ring Road. 
</P>
<P>
What was unfolding appeared to be a battle for control of Beijing and, in the 
broader sense, for control of China after the country's 84-year-old paramount 
political and military leader, Deng Xiaoping, passes from the scene. China's 
political leadership appeared to be in a virtual state of collapse, almost 
paralyzed by personal rivalries and differences over the use of force and 
terror against Beijing citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Deng is generally believed to have ordered the bloody military crackdown, but 
he is also believed to be in rapidly failing health. It is widely believed that 
he suffers from prostate cancer. But there have also been rumors that he has 
suffered a stroke or died since his last appearance in public, which was the 
May 16 summit meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
The troops now in control of central Beijing are more directly associated with 
Yang and high-ranking military members of his family. It appeared that the 
Chinese president, a veteran military leader in better health than Deng, was 
making a bid for supreme power. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attempted Coup Seen 
</P>
<P>
Some observers theorized that either President Yang had attempted to carry out 
a coup and Deng was succeeding in putting it down, or that Deng himself was 
responsible for ordering the carnage but had realized that the situation 
nationwide was getting out of control and was looking for scapegoats. 
</P>
<P>
But one Chinese military source said that Deng, whose whereabouts are unknown, 
had not been in control of the military when the weekend massacre took place. 
This source said Deng is now believed to be reasserting control. 
</P>
<P>
Some reports said that the 38th Army, a Beijing-area force that reputedly 
refused orders to suppress the pro-democracy demonstrations that touched off 
the current crisis, was being ordered to retake the city from the troops that 
moved in over the weekend. The 38th Army is believed to have strong ties to the 
reformist general secretary of the Communist Party, Zhao Ziyang. Zhao appears 
to have been stripped of power for his refusal to take a hard line with the 
students. His current fate is unknown but he has been presumed to be under 
house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Troops Unwilling 
</P>
<P>
Within Beijing, there were various indications that not all troops were willing 
to participate in the martial-law crackdown ordered by hard-line Premier Li 
Peng on May 20. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 military vehicles, including armored personnel carriers and troop 
trucks, were abandoned by soldiers on the west side of the city during the 
predawn hours Monday and later set afire by residents. Crowds around the 
charred vehicles reported that the soldiers who had left them and taken refuge 
at a nearby museum compound had said they were unwilling to fire on unarmed 
crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Closer to the city center, shooting broke out between two groups of troops near 
the Minzu Hotel, only about one mile west of Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats who spoke to reporters for the news agency United Press 
International said that later in the day they saw two armored personnel 
carriers engage in a machine-gun duel at the same location, sending bullets 
through fifth-floor windows of the tourist hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Troops apparently supporting the martial-law crackdown set up cordons across 
two main roads near the city's northwest campus district Monday, UPI reported. 
</P>
<P>
A Hong Kong newspaper reported today that an officer on guard at Beijing's 
Great Hall of the People fired four shots at Premier Li on Sunday afternoon but 
that the Chinese leader escaped with only a slight wound. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press quoted the daily Ming Pao as saying the young guard fired 
from a distance and Li was hit in the thigh. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources, said the guard was killed 
immediately and about 170 other guards at the Great Hall were quickly disarmed. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout many parts of the city, citizens erected barricades of buses, 
trucks, metal-and-concrete street dividers and vegetable market stalls. 
Citizens stood guard at intersections, many of which were virtually impassable. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of transportation and an eerie tension on the streets kept most 
workers at home away from their jobs Monday and today. Most stores remained 
closed and there was worry that food shortages may soon crop up. Relatively few 
Beijing residents keep stores of food on hand because of a lack of 
refrigerators. Panic buying of food supplies began to break out. 
</P>
<P>
"We have dried noodles, but that is about all. And we're almost out of cooking 
oil," complained a homemaker standing in a long line at a vegetable stand near 
the Temple of the Sun park. 
</P>
<P>
In the old neighborhoods near Tian An Men Square, soldiers were seen Monday 
running into alleyways and shooting at fleeing residents. One witness said that 
a teen-age girl was shot in the chest near Tian An Men. 
</P>
<P>
Rifle shots could be heard from the direction of the square in the evening, and 
a building was set afire on Xidan street and Changan Avenue to the west of the 
huge central open space. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy said an American was hospitalized with head injuries received 
Sunday morning when he was beaten by security forces clearing demonstrators 
from Tian An Men Square. He was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
Confirmed deaths, based on figures provided by hospitals and bodies seen by 
foreign witnesses, number about 400, but it is widely believed that at least 
1,000, and perhaps many more have died. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Chinese Red Cross, which had displayed some sympathy for 
the student protesters in the square, said that the death toll "is in the 
thousands." 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously it's going to be impossible to ever know," he added. 
</P>
<P>
An unsubstantiated report circulated among students at Beijing University that 
four truckloads of dead were moved over the weekend from Tian An Men Square to 
the main crematorium at Babaoshan Cemetery in western Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from other areas of China on Monday indicated that the situation was 
chaotic in many other cities outside Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Posters in Shanghai carried the message "The Blood Has Been Shed," referring to 
the weekend violence in Beijing. Protesters blocked traffic virtually 
throughout the city, an official at the U.S. Consulate said. The Shanghai 
municipal government warned that it would take "strong measures" unless the 
streets were cleared. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Situation in Shanghai 
</P>
<P>
The situation in Shanghai further deteriorated in the evening, with authorities 
warning that they were about to move against the throngs of residents in the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Sylvester, the U.S. consul general in Shanghai, told The Times in a 
telephone interview this morning that the city government had telephoned all 
consulates Monday night and warned them to keep their citizens away from the 
famous downtown Bund area, People's Square and the universities. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the night, rumors spread of the impending imposition of martial law, 
but dawn arrived with no such announcement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've also had a lot of panic buying here of rice, oil and other food 
staples," he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cars Overturned in Chengdu 
</P>
<P>
In Chengdu in Sichuan province, a diplomat reported that cars of Chinese 
officials were being overturned. 
</P>
<P>
The government continued to insist that the bloody crackdown in Beijing was 
necessary to crush "a counterrevolutionary rebellion." 
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Monday in the name of the State Council, China's Cabinet, 
and the Communist Party Central Committee, blamed the violence in Beijing on 
"supporters of bourgeois liberalization" -- a code phrase for Western concepts 
of democracy and individual freedoms -- foreign governments, hooligans and 
remnants of radical leftist supporters of the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SCATTERED SKIRMISHES REPORTED AS CRISIS DEEPENS IN BEIJING 
</P>
<P>
The situation in China, a country that increasingly seemed to be on the edge of 
civil war Monday: 
</P>
<P>
Forces presumed loyal to hard-line President Yang Shangkun controlled central 
Beijing but were in defensive positions in apparent anticipation of attack by 
rival units. 
</P>
<P>
Troops and armored vehicles were reported moving toward Beijing from the east. 
They were described as opposed to the forces that killed hundreds of citizens 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Tanks and troops fanned out to secure the downtown area that includes Tian An 
Men Square, the Great Hall of the People and Zhongnanhai, the compound where 
China's rulers live. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, unrest and disorder were reported in other Chinese cities: 
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, protesters blocked traffic virtually throughout the city, and the 
municipal government warned that it would take "strong measures" unless the 
streets were cleared. 
</P>
<P>
In Chengdu in Sichuan province, a diplomat reported that cars of Chinese 
officials were being overturned. 
</P>
<P>
In Hangzhou and Wuhan, protesters sat on rail lines, blocking trains to 
Shanghai and a main north-south line.

CRUSH KILLS 8 AT RITE FOR KHOMEINI 
</P>

<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Iranians struggled for a last glimpse of the Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini as he lay in state Monday, and in the wild expressions of 
mass grief, at least eight people were crushed to death and an estimated 500 
others were injured. 
</P>
<P>
In temperatures of more than 100 degrees, the crowd of mourners, estimated by 
some officials at 2 million, jammed into Moussalam Square, a huge area reserved 
for prayer meetings in north Tehran. Weeping, wailing and chanting, they pushed 
forward to see the body of their spiritual and temporal leader, who lay on a 
makeshift catafalque -- boxes draped with cloth and topped by an 
air-conditioned glass covering. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Khomeini, whose death was announced Sunday morning, more than 10 
years after he returned from exile in France following the revolution that 
overthrew Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, was enveloped in a white shroud, with his 
familiar black turban resting on his chest. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities appealed for calm, but their pleas went unheeded by the mourners, 
almost all of them dressed in black -- shirts and trousers for the men, long 
chadors or veils on the women. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the male mourners beat their breasts rhythmically or slapped their 
heads in grief. This added to the day's sense of frenzy, and at one point, as 
the mob pressed forward, some in front were trampled underfoot by those pushing 
from behind. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Passed Back by Crowd 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the dead, as well as those who were injured, were placed on 
stretchers and passed hand to hand over the heads of the crowd. Firefighters 
sprayed water from hoses to cool the overheated, exhausted faithful. 
</P>
<P>
Military helicopters clattered overhead, enabling VIPs to get a glimpse of the 
body without having to brave the chaos on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
All day, loudspeakers blared readings from the Koran, the Muslim holy book. 
</P>
<P>
At nightfall, the vigil continued by candlelight, with the limp bodies of those 
who had collapsed being passed back by the crowd every few minutes to the 
ambulances and medical teams waiting on the edge of the square. 
</P>
<P>
Even greater crowds are expected today when Khomeini's body will be taken to 
the Cemetery of the Martyrs for burial. The funeral had at first been set for 
Monday, but President Ali Khamenei, the ayatollah's religious successor, 
ordered the ceremony delayed for a day. 
</P>
<P>
The prayer park where Khomeini's body lay in state overlooks the city, in the 
brow of the Alborz Mountains, which still bear streaks of snow. It is not far 
from the modest quarters Khomeini maintained in north Tehran, once the 
neighborhood of Iran's wealthy business and governing class. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2-Day Mourning Period 
</P>
<P>
The capital was shut down for a two-day period of mourning. In most of the 
city, traffic was light, but an enormous traffic jam occurred near the square. 
Thousands of mourners arrived in cars and buses to pay their respects, and many 
double- and triple-parked. Thousands of others traveled on foot along the main 
north-south highway, which then had to be closed to traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Police wore black armbands, and black flags flew from the antennas of official 
motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their presence in large numbers, the police seemed helpless in handling 
the huge crowds, and congestion grew by the hour. The state television carried 
the mourning's scenes and played dirge-like music throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini's son, Ahmed, read on state radio the first pages of the ayatollah's 
political testament, which is thought to spell out his wishes for how Iran 
should be governed. The section he read made no reference to the succession. It 
called for national unity and warned against the possibility of U.S. plotting. 
</P>
<P>
It also referred to King Fahd, the ruler of Saudi Arabia, as a traitor to God 
and said the rulers of the Soviet Union, Jordan, Egypt, Morocco and Iraq are 
tyrants. 
</P>
<P>
"May God's curse be upon them," the testament said. 
</P>
<P>
The mourning is taking place against a backdrop of political maneuvering over 
the succession. The ayatollah, who installed a fundamentalist Muslim regime 
after he returned from exile, never drew up a proper line of succession among 
his followers. President Khamenei, who has been named to take up Khomeini's 
role as spiritual leader, is regarded as an interim political leader. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement to state television Monday, Khamenei said: "We hope temporarily 
to be able to fill the leadership. . . . The new terms of the constitution are 
currently under review." 
</P>
<P>
Presidental elections are scheduled for August, and a leading contender is 
Speaker of Parliament Hashemi Rafsanjani. 
</P>
<P>
After the cease-fire in the war with Iraq last summer, Rafsanjani appeared to 
be inclined to chart a practical course for Iran, emphasizing reconstruction. 
But Khomeini suddenly fastened onto the issue of a novel he deemed blasphemous 
-- Salman Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses" -- and he ordered the author's death. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani went along with the edict, as did Prime Minister Hussein Moussavi 
and those members of the Cabinet who favor stronger government control in all 
sectors. 
</P>
<P>
The Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri was Khomeini's designated successor as 
spiritual leader until he was forced to step down in March, and it is not clear 
where Montazeri stands now. 
</P>
<P>
Also not clear is the position of Khomeini's son, Ahmed. Some think that 
Khomeini wanted his son to succeed him as both religious and political leader, 
but the ayatollah never went so far as to designate him as such.

4 WHO MAY RULE STEELED BY STRUGGLE

<P>
The scene at New York's opulent Waldorf-Astoria Hotel was surreal. In a formal 
ballroom, underneath elegant chandeliers, Iranian President Ali Khamenei was 
having breakfast with 15 American journalists. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounding Khamenei was a squad of formidable, bearded Revolutionary Guards 
from the fearsome military unit made famous by its quest for martyrdom during 
the war with Iraq. And in the hallways just outside, U.S. Secret Service agents 
provided their own protection for a man whose government had officially dubbed 
the United States "the Great Satan." 
</P>
<P>
The first moments of the meal were awkward. In 1981, Khamenei was nearly killed 
by a bomb hidden inside a tape recorder and placed on the podium as he gave a 
Friday prayer sermon. Since then, he has walked with a cane, and his right arm 
has dangled uselessly at his side. To help the Iranian president eat his 
breakfast, one of the Revolutionary Guards had to bend over him, like a parent 
over a child, and cut his cheese and cold cuts. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Iran's ruling mullahs, or clerics, named Khamenei to replace the 
revered Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini as the leader of Iran's revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Whether he will survive in that role in unpredictable Iran is anybody's guess. 
But for now, the 49-year-old Khamenei has emerged as one of four Iranian 
leaders who are expected to play major roles in the struggle to fill the vacuum 
left by Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
And in a nation where violence has become an accepted form of political 
expression, Khamenei's close brush with death does not distinguish him. Two of 
the three other contenders for power have also been targets of assassins since 
Khomeini's revolution swept Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi from power in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Near-Misses for Rafsanjani 
</P>
<P>
Hashemi Rafsanjani, 54, the Speaker of Parliament and the man widely predicted 
to become the real power during the revolution's next phase, was injured during 
a 1980 assassination attempt. A year later, he left a building less than three 
minutes before a bomb killed more than 70 people, including 10 Cabinet 
officials and 27 members of Parliament. Unconfirmed reports suggest that he has 
survived a series of further assaults over the past 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, the interior minister, has no left hand and only the 
thumb remaining on his right hand. He lost his hands and part of his face in 
1984 when a book bomb detonated as he opened it at the Iranian Embassy in 
Syria, where he was then serving as ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
Only Ahmed Khomeini, the ayatollah's son and chief of staff for 12 years, has 
remained unscathed, at least as far as is known. But his older brother, from 
whom Ahmed inherited the job as his father's right-hand man, died when the 
Khomeini family was in exile in 1977. No official cause of death was announced, 
but followers charged that the shah's secret police were responsible. 
</P>
<P>
These are the men who, at least at the outset, will shape Iran's political 
future -- whether it militantly pursues the Islamic Revolution or finally seeks 
accommodations with the West, whether it maintains close central control of its 
economy or allows an opening for free enterprise, whether it retains its tight 
grip on social behavior or permits the diversity of Iranian society to 
re-emerge. 
</P>
<P>
All four, in addition to their familiarity with violence, share several common 
characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
They are hojatoleslams, a category of mullahs that means "authority on Islam" 
and is the rank just below ayatollah. They are all lifelong Khomeini disciples 
who faced persecution during the shah's reign. 
</P>
<P>
And now, reflecting the metamorphosis of the clergy from inexperience to 
expertise in running a complex nation of 50 million, they are all masterful 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
They differ, however, on the future of the revolution they jointly engineered a 
decade ago. Those differences are likely to provide the framework for Iran's 
political future. 
</P>
<P>
Together, Khamenei and Rafsanjani constitute the pragmatic leadership of the 
Islamic Republic's complex political spectrum. The Iranian government has 
blamed leftist opposition groups for the attacks on their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Mohtashemi, by contrast, is Iran's leading hard-liner. He has been linked to 
the devastating bombing of the U.S. Marine compound in Beirut in 1983 and the 
suicide bombings of U.S. embassies in Beirut in 1983 and 1984. U.S. 
intelligence officials speculate that he or his followers may have played a 
role in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which was downed over Scotland 
last December, killing 270 people. 
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Khomeini is, at the moment, the man in the political middle. At different 
times he has sided with various factions and evolved into the role of power 
broker on behalf of his father. He is almost certain to continue to play a 
major role as rival factions turn to him for interpretations of what his father 
would have said on key points. 
</P>
<P>
Khamenei and Rafsanjani share the same end of the political spectrum now, but 
Khamenei was not always a pragmatist. At the Waldorf-Astoria breakfast, which 
took place in 1987, he demonstrated the characteristics that have made Iran's 
revolutionary leaders so maddening to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
He barely noticed that someone was cutting his food for him. The 
highest-ranking mullah ever to set foot on American soil was instead 
preoccupied with fielding tough questions from Mike Wallace of CBS' "60 
Minutes," Garrick Utley of NBC's "Meet the Press" and 13 other journalists. To 
the surprise of the reporters who attended, the Iranians had not invited 
reporters who were sympathetic to their cause. 
</P>
<P>
Two days earlier, an Iranian ship called the Iran Ajr had been caught 
red-handed by the U.S. Navy laying mines in the Persian Gulf. Americans had 
seized the ship, killed four of its crew members and held the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Khamenei angrily denied that the Islamic Republic was scheming against the U.S. 
naval forces that had been dispatched to the gulf to protect oil tankers from 
the increasingly bloody war between Iran and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a peaceful merchant ship," the new Iranian president insisted. "This is 
the beginning of a series of events, the bitter consequences of which will not 
be restricted to the Persian Gulf. The U.S. shall receive a proper response for 
this abominable act. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, it is we who receive the dead bodies of our sons. But if, God forbid, 
the day comes when you will receive the dead bodies of your sons, people will 
say, 'Why didn't you stop it?' " 
</P>
<P>
Khamenei had gone to New York to make a bold address to the United Nations 
about the respected place that Iran felt it deserved in the international 
community. He was the most senior Iranian revolutionary to have spoken to the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Khamenei found himself forced to defend Iran's mine-laying 
misadventure. Although he was a senior member of Iran's Supreme Defense 
Council, which prosecuted the war against Iraq, insiders said he was unaware of 
the escapade in the gulf -- and deeply embarrassed by it. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's new leader appears to have mellowed since his U.N. address. Over the 
past two years, Khamenei has increasingly become a conciliator and a 
pragmatist. He and Rafsanjani are widely credited with manipulating hard-liners 
and, ultimately, Khomeini himself, into accepting the 1988 cease-fire that 
ended the devastating eight-year war with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Khamenei personally knew the divisive costs of the war. His son was scarred 
last year in a chemical weapon attack by Iraq. And his sister went into exile 
to join her dissident husband in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, he even suggested that Iran might be prepared to borrow foreign 
funds for the first time since the revolution and to use Western technology to 
help reconstruct the war-ravaged country. 
</P>
<P>
"We must make use of the knowledge, expertise and resources of the foreigner," 
he said at the opening of Iran's International Trade Fair. 
</P>
<P>
While he has in the past advocated reforms to improve the lives of Iran's lower 
classes, his longstanding ties to bazaar merchants have tempered his support 
for radical economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
And shortly after Khomeini's death sentence on author Salman Rushdie over his 
novel, "The Satanic Verses," in February, Khamenei publicly suggested that the 
edict might be lifted if Rushdie apologized. An outraged Khomeini quickly 
rebuked the president. 
</P>
<P>
Even his attitude on social mores has moderated. More than three years ago, he 
refused to attend a state banquet in his honor in Zimbabwe because women were 
to sit at the head table and wine was to be served. But at the Waldorf 
breakfast a year later, two American women were allowed to sit close to him. 
One who had brought Islamic head cover was told that she need not wear it. 
</P>
<P>
Although Khamenei has at least temporarily inherited the title of Iran's 
revolutionary leader, he is in fact likely to end up taking a back seat to 
Rafsanjani. Indeed, the parliamentary Speaker, who is a member of the selection 
council, may have helped maneuver Khamenei's election, according to Iran 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Roommates as young theologians and later imprisoned in the same jail by the 
shah, the two men are longtime associates. Together, they could form a powerful 
bloc to hold off the hard-liners. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani's standing is expected to be decided in August presidential 
elections. He is the leading contender to succeed Khamenei in a strengthened 
executive presidency. Under Khamenei, the position was largely ceremonial. 
</P>
<P>
The speaker is both wily and charismatic. Among the generally stern clergy, he 
is one of the few who frequently smiles in public. His gentle jokes are 
legendary, and he was widely said to be a Khomeini favorite because he could 
make the imam laugh. 
</P>
<P>
His following outside fundamentalist circles has grown to the point that many 
Iranians openly refer to him as "Akbar shah," implying that he has gained the 
power of an Iranian king. 
</P>
<P>
His political skills were evident at a parliamentary session last June. 
Although several members made speeches on the floor, the real action was 
clearly taking place elsewhere. One by one, a dozen members made their way to 
Rafsanjani's chair on the elevated dais to whisper in his ear. 
</P>
<P>
"This is how the bartering is done," said an Iranian official in private. 
"Everyone goes to Rafsanjani with problems or proposals. No idea will get very 
far without him." 
</P>
<P>
Later that day, Rafsanjani was elected to his ninth term as Iran's 
parliamentary speaker. According to the official tally, only five of the almost 
200 secret ballots did not carry his name. And they were all blank. 
</P>
<P>
As acting commander in chief, Rafsanjani also enjoys widespread support within 
the fractious military. He was once briefly commander of the Revolutionary 
Guards and still reportedly has a following among several wings. 
</P>
<P>
His political skills are reflected in a popular story about the time Rafsanjani 
was riding in a car with Iran's president and prime minister. When they came to 
a fork in the road, the driver asked which way to turn. "Right," said the 
president. "Left," said the prime minister. Rafsanjani then instructed, "Signal 
left, but turn right." 
</P>
<P>
The current positions held by Rafsanjani and Khamenei are most threatened from 
within the theocracy by men such as Mohtashemi, who is often called Khomeini's 
"third son." Mohtashemi was with Khomeini throughout his exile, as a student 
and then as an aide. His longstanding loyalty earned him access and position 
within Khomeini's inner circle. 
</P>
<P>
Mohtashemi, a diminutive and quiet man with a trim black beard and horn-rimmed 
glasses, symbolizes those clerics who advocate continued isolation from the 
outside world, tight control of the economy and no wavering from the "pure" 
political ideals of the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Within the government he serves as interior minister, and he derives power from 
his control over the revolutionary komitehs, or committees, that police 
political and moral conduct in neighborhoods throughout Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's Interior Ministry is in charge of state security, not wildlife and 
national parks. Mohtashemi's komiteh network gives him the only national base 
from which to challenge either the military or the Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Although the militants appear at the moment to have been outflanked by 
Rafsanjani and Khamenei, Mohtashemi's predilection for unconventional tactics 
makes his future unpredictable. In a hearing last fall to reconfirm members of 
the Cabinet, a fellow government official said of him publicly: 
</P>
<P>
"He is well known for his hiring and firing. He regards himself as the only 
power. He neither consults the clergy nor does he pay attention to 
(Parliament's) deputies. With regard to the law, he acts wherever he sees fit 
and in accordance with his own will." 
</P>
<P>
Mohtashemi was only narrowly reconfirmed as interior minister. 
</P>
<P>
The last of the contenders for power is Ahmed Khomeini, a plump, almost 
cherubic-looking figure in his mid-40s and an unknown factor in the long term. 
Although some pundits have reported his quest to succeed his father, he is 
widely considered in Tehran to be too young and inexperienced in government, 
lacking both religious credentials and scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Although Khomeini holds the same religious rank as Rafsanjani, Khamenei and 
Mohtashemi, he has not written extensively except in his father's name. That 
confers disadvantage in Iran, where elevation within religious circles has 
depended on introducing new ideas and on generating prolific scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"He is politically shrewd, but he is not an intellectual," an Iranian official 
once said of him. 
</P>
<P>
By recently establishing a militant clerics' association, Ahmed Khomeini has 
created an inside power base from which to build. And, as "keeper of the 
flame," he is almost certain to have a role as the mullahs sort out their 
political and personal differences. 
</P>
<P>
How the Iranian leadership shakes out will determine that nation's relations 
with the United States. Even as long as two years ago, at the Waldorf-Astoria 
breakfast for Khamenei, there was a sign that the two nations could cooperate, 
at least on small matters. 
</P>
<P>
It was no accident that the Revolutionary Guards were inside the ballroom and 
the Secret Service agents were in the hallway outside. The two security 
services had together worked out the arrangements "quite amicably," said one of 
the U.S. agents. 
</P>
<P>
"One on one," he volunteered about the Iranians, "they're not bad fellows."

SCIENTOLOGISTS LOSE TAX DEDUCTION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court ruled Monday that the "fixed donations" paid by members to 
the Church of Scientology are not tax-deductible, charitable contributions. 
</P>
<P>
In the 5-2 ruling, the high court said that money paid to the church by 
Scientologists for training and a form of counseling called "auditing" are more 
like fees for a service than donations to a church. 
</P>
<P>
The church requires fixed donations of as much as $3,000 for 12 1/2 hours of 
"auditing," during which a person confesses his innermost thoughts while his 
responses are monitored on a lie detector-type device known as the E-meter. 
</P>
<P>
For years, members of the Church of Scientology have tried to deduct their 
donations but have been rejected by the Internal Revenue Service. One of the 
church's major strongholds is in Los Angeles, where thousands of Scientologists 
flock from around the world to purchase the training at the group's sprawling 
blue complex on Fountain Avenue or at other local centers. 
</P>
<P>
Church leaders have long argued that their sacred scriptures -- written by the 
late Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard -- mandate the payment of fixed 
donations. Hubbard, under his "doctrine of exchange," contended that a person 
must learn to give as well as to receive. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Supreme Court, lawyers for the Scientologists contended that the 
government had singled out the church for discrimination. They said that the 
Internal Revenue Service has permitted members of other religions to take tax 
deductions for "pew rents" and tithing, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
But Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the majority, found otherwise. He 
said church members receive a service for their contributions, much like 
tuition at a religious school, which is not tax deductible. 
</P>
<P>
"In return for their money," Marshall said, members "received an identifiable 
benefit, namely, auditing and training services." 
</P>
<P>
In dissent, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, joined by Justice Antonin Scalia, 
agreed with the church's argument that it had been discriminated against by the 
IRS. She said that payments deemed deductible by the IRS for other religions 
were "indistinguishable" from those made by Scientologists. 
</P>
<P>
Justices William Brennan and Anthony Kennedy did not take part in the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Brian Anderson, vice president of the Church of Scientology 
International, said the Supreme Court decision "poses a threat" to tax 
deductions taken by members of all religions. 
</P>
<P>
"The freedom to support one's religion," he said, "is a constitutional right 
guaranteed every American. Today's decision seeks to destroy those rights and 
puts the Constitution in the back seat behind the Internal Revenue code." 
</P>
<P>
The high court's decision comes after a number of lower federal courts across 
the country issued conflicting opinions on whether Scientology's fixed 
donations were tax deductible. The case that led to the Supreme Court ruling on 
Monday grew out of an appellate decision in New England. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, the U.S. 1st Circuit Court of Appeals upheld an IRS decision 
denying Scientologist Robert Hernandez a tax deduction of $7,338 for 
contributions to the church in 1981. He was then assessed a penalty of more 
than $2,200. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's ruling is the latest in a series of legal disputes involving the 
church. The organization has been in and out of court for years, battling 
dozens of suits filed by former members who have charged that they were 
defrauded and harassed by Hubbard's followers. 
</P>
<P>
The church, branded a "cult" by its detractors, has paid millions of dollars in 
out-of-court settlements to end costly and embarrassing litigation.

SOME INSURERS TELL STATE THEY WILL GIVE PARTIAL RATE ROLLBACKS 
</P>

<P>
Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie said Monday that some insurance 
companies have "unofficially" notified her department that they will be giving 
at least some of the rate rollbacks called for in Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie said she will not disclose the names of the companies until she sees 
which ones meet a June 16 deadline for filing formal affidavits declaring their 
intent to give rollbacks. 
</P>
<P>
But she also told a San Francisco news conference that the "vast majority" of 
companies already had filed for exemptions from the rollbacks. Saturday was the 
deadline for such filings, and Gillespie showed reporters 850 boxes of 
documents submitted with the exemption requests. 
</P>
<P>
She said that a task force of 70 departmental employees will start sorting 
through the materials immediately and that hearings to determine whether the 
applicants qualify for exemptions will begin within two months and will be 
completed by Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
In its recent decision upholding most of Proposition 103, the state Supreme 
Court said the commissioner could exempt companies from the initiative's 20% 
rollback from 1987 premium levels if the companies could show that cutting 
premiums that much would prevent them from receiving a fair rate of return in 
their business. 
</P>
<P>
More than 700 companies are licensed in California to sell property and 
casualty insurance -- including auto, homeowners, commercial and many other 
types -- but Gillespie said she could not say Monday precisely how many had 
applied for exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
Companies that missed the filing deadline will be required to grant the 
rollbacks whether or not they volunteer to do so, the commissioner said. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie identified only one company that had filed for an exemption -- State 
Farm, the largest auto and homeowner insurer in the state. A second major 
company, Farmers, issued a press release on its own saying that it had applied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low Return Claimed 
</P>
<P>
The Farmers statement said the company was receiving a return of only 2.3% on 
its private passenger auto insurance business and only 3.4% on its homeowner 
lines. However, Gillespie said it will be up to her to determine if these 
figures are accurate and whether an exemption is justified. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner's statement that some companies had unofficially said they 
would be voluntarily giving rollbacks was the first word from any authoritative 
source that any rollbacks are in the immediate offing. 
</P>
<P>
The state Supreme Court said that companies giving rollbacks would have to 
rebate, with interest, excessive premiums collected since the date of the 
election in November. 
</P>
<P>
According to the original terms of Proposition 103, the rollbacks were to have 
been granted immediately after the election, and there was to be a price freeze 
for one year, until November, 1989. After that, all new rates were to be 
subject to the prior approval of the commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Under these original terms, the only way a company could be exempted from the 
rollbacks was to demonstrate to the commissioner that it was in danger of 
insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Court's Decision 
</P>
<P>
However, the Supreme Court struck down the insolvency clause, and substituted 
the fair rate of return standard for deciding on exemptions, a considerably 
easier test for insurers to meet. It indicated the companies could charge any 
rate they wished prior to a determination by the commissioner on whether they 
qualified for an exemption. And after next November, the high court allowed the 
commissioner to grant the companies authorization to charge an interim rate, 
pending her approval of a new rate filing. 
</P>
<P>
One consumer expert who has carefully followed implementation procedures on 
Proposition 103, and who met last week with Gillespie, cautioned Monday that 
companies which choose to give rollbacks might confine cuts to obscure lines of 
insurance that serve only small numbers of customers. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it going to be boiler insurance or automobile insurance?" asked Steven 
Miller, head of Insurance Consumer Action Network. "Companies expecting that 
the commissioner is going to require hefty rollbacks might seek to get out in 
front of her by voluntarily giving modest rollbacks. We are simply going to 
have to wait and see which lines are involved, and then to what degree." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie had said previously that she reserves the right to order partial 
rollbacks, if that would most closely satisfy the fair return standard. 
</P>
<P>
She reiterated Monday that she will allow each company a fair return on each 
line of insurance it sells, not lump all lines together for a general 
determination, and that she will consider only each company's California 
business, not its entire business, in making the determinations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hearings Scheduled 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie also called two-day public hearings for Los Angeles, on June 19 and 
20, and San Francisco, on June 22 and 23, to solicit comment on proposed 
language for regulations she plans to issue implementing details of Proposition 
103. 
</P>
<P>
She said she wants a great deal of such public input, and issued a special 
appeal for public views on how to implement Proposition 103's mandate that 
beginning in November all "good drivers" with not more than one moving 
violation in the last three years be given a 20% discount off basic auto 
insurance rates. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, when such a discount is given, drivers with bad driving records 
will have to be charged higher rates.

A member of a skinhead group Monday was sentenced to life in prison, with no 
parole for at least 20 years, for beating a man to death because he was black. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth M. Mieske, 23, of Portland, was ordered to serve at least 20 years 
before he will be eligible for parole. (The state parole board could release 
him earlier only by a unanimous vote.) 
</P>
<P>
Mieske pleaded guilty to felony murder in the Nov. 13 death of Mulugeta Seraw, 
27, an Ethiopian national who was attacked with a baseball bat outside his 
apartment here. 
</P>
<P>
When he pleaded guilty a month ago, Mieske admitted that he killed Seraw 
"because of his race." 
</P>
<P>
Mieske also was sentenced to two concurrent five-year terms for two counts of 
first-degree intimidation, one for the attack on Seraw and another for the 
stabbing of a black security guard at a grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
At his sentencing, Mieske offered an apology to Seraw's uncle, but added: "I 
don't blame you if you don't accept it." 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I can come out and be a good citizen instead of a right-wing radical 
and hate monger," Mieske said.

50,000 MOURNERS MARCH FOR KHOMEINI IN BEIRUT

The drum-like thud of some 50,000 Shiite Muslim mourners beating their chests 
reverberated in Beirut on Monday as they marched in a symbolic funeral for the 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
"The glory of Islam has gone. Our back is broken now. . . . Our enemies are 
rejoicing. We have become orphans," said a sobbing Shiite Muslim cleric in the 
procession led by white-turbaned clergymen and hundreds of heavily armed gunmen 
and Iranian Revolutionary Guards. 
</P>
<P>
"We cry not with tears but with blood!" mourners chanted during the five-hour 
march through battle-scarred streets. "Our wound will bleed forever." 
</P>
<P>
Black-clad women and children, praying and weeping, kissed Khomeini's posters. 
</P>
<P>
Fighters of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah (Party of God) lined rooftops and 
searched cars and pedestrians to prevent any attack on mourners. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd marched from the southern suburbs -- a bastion of Hezbollah militants 
and an area where at least some of the 17 Westerners abducted in Lebanon are 
believed held -- to the Iranian Embassy in West Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Muslim radio and TV broadcast verses from the Koran and flags flew at 
half-staff on the second of three days of national mourning declared by acting 
Premier Salim Hoss, a Sunni Muslim. Banks, shops and public institutions closed 
in southern Lebanon, Muslim West Beirut and the Bekaa Valley in the east. 
</P>
<P>
Before the march, Christian gunners exchanged fire with Syrian troops and their 
Muslim militia allies. Shells crashed into Muslim West Beirut and scores of 
hills southeast of the capital. Other shells fell on Christian East Beirut, 
killing two people and wounding 14, as well as on Christian-held ports.

BUSH PRESSES IRAN ABOUT U.S. HOSTAGES 
</P>

<P>
President Bush on Monday called upon the Iranian government, in the wake of the 
death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, to work for the release of American 
hostages held by Muslim extremists in Lebanon if it wishes to improve relations 
with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
He also said U.S. experts are still uncertain about political developments in 
Tehran after Khomeini's death. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's president, Ali Khamenei, was named Khomeini's successor as the nation's 
spiritual leader. "But in a society of that nature," Bush noted, "it's hard to 
predict" what will happen. 
</P>
<P>
Asked at a news conference if he planned any other kind of overture to Tehran 
to improve relations, the President said: 
</P>
<P>
"No, absolutely not. They know what they need to do. They have been a terrorist 
state, and as soon as we see some move away from oppression and extremism of 
that nature, we will review our relationship." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outlined at Inaugural 
</P>
<P>
Bush noted that he outlined the conditions for improved relations in his 
inaugural address Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler emphasized those 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iranian government will have to decide whether it wants to take the steps 
which are required for an improvement in relations," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I will restate them. It should use its considerable influence over the hostage 
holders in Lebanon to bring about immediately the safe and unconditional 
release of all hostages. If Iran wants to be a responsible member of the 
international community, it should also stop its support of international 
terrorism and terrorists," Tutwiler said. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen Westerners, including nine Americans, are being held in Lebanon by 
Islamic fundamentalists who are widely believed to receive aid from Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the continuing hostility between the United States and Iran, no 
message of condolence has been sent about Khomeini's death, Tutwiler indicated, 
and no U.S. representative will attend the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure we were invited," she said.

<P>
Panic began to spread through financial markets in this British colony Monday 
as residents reacted to the weekend bloodshed in Beijing with deep anxiety over 
their future under eventual Communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's already jittery stock market plummeted nearly 22%, the worst 
single-day loss since the October, 1987, global crash. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, trade union leaders prepared to stage a general strike 
Wednesday to protest the Beijing government's brutal crackdown on pro-democracy 
demonstrators, whose cause has been celebrated -- and to a large extent 
financed -- by Hong Kong Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers said they will exempt essential services such as banking, 
communications and transportation, but the action is expected to grind work to 
a halt in this vibrant business capital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protest Demonstrations 
</P>
<P>
Already, hundreds of thousands of residents have turned out to express sympathy 
with the demonstrators in Beijing, most recently on Sunday, when a crowd 
estimated at 200,000 rallied at the Hong Kong Jockey Club, according to local 
news reports. Mass demonstrations in the colony peaked May 28, when about 1.5 
million people marched. 
</P>
<P>
And depositors with accounts at banks controlled by mainland China reportedly 
withdrew their funds in protest of the violence in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 protesters gathered Monday outside the offices of the official New 
China News Agency, Beijing's unofficial diplomatic mission, demanding to see Xu 
Jiatun, head of the delegation. David Wilson, the Hong Kong governor, 
reportedly met with Xu later in the day to express "revulsion" over the 
military violence and to ask for cooperation from the Chinese government in 
safeguarding Hong Kong residents who have remained in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
The question of protecting the safety of Hong Kong Chinese took on urgency 
early today with reports that Lee Cheuk-yan, a local labor leader, was detained 
by Chinese police as he attempted to board a charter jet at the Beijing 
airport. Lee went to the Chinese capital last week with a delegation carrying 
$260,000 in U.S. currency in donations for the pro-democracy students camping 
out in Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot of the Dragon Air Boeing 737, chartered by the Hong Kong government 
to evacuate about 125 Hong Kong journalists, business people and students, told 
reporters about Lee's arrest on arrival at Kai Tak Airport shortly after 
midnight. The unionist, in his early 30s, reportedly was detained because his 
home visit permit, a travel document allowing overseas Chinese to visit the 
mainland, had not been properly inspected. 
</P>
<P>
The incident came amid rising fears that Hong Kong Chinese might be subject to 
arbitrary abuse of authority by the Communists because they do not enjoy any 
diplomatic protection by Britain, which has recognized Beijing's sovereignty 
over Hong Kong and its territories. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a small group of Hong Kong journalists taking refuge Monday at the 
Beijing Hotel, near the center of the weekend bloodshed, sought assistance from 
the British Embassy when they panicked at a report that the hotel would be 
raided by troops. They were told to fend for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Mabel Chan, a reporter for Television Broadcast Ltd., a local channel, said she 
phoned the embassy repeatedly and was told by a duty officer, "We are not in a 
position to help you at this point." Chan returned to Hong Kong on the Dragon 
Air flight. 
</P>
<P>
About 16 Hong Kong journalists chose to remain in Beijing, according to Sani 
Harte, assistant news editor of the South China Morning Post. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Postponed Visit 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wilson is reported to have postponed until Wednesday his departure 
for London, where he was to meet with British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe 
to discuss the Chinese crisis. 
</P>
<P>
In London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government came under increasing 
pressure to take a new look at the 1984 Anglo-Chinese agreement that sets the 
framework for returning the British colony of Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition members of Parliament have called for the government to reconsider 
terms of the accord that fails to provide any so-called "lifeboat" for the 
colony's 5.5 million residents if China should renege on its commitment to 
guarantee the colony's current capitalist, democratic character. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Kaufman, the opposition Labor Party's foreign affairs spokesman, also 
said he would ask for a formal government statement on the China crisis in the 
House of Commons today. 
</P>
<P>
The leader of the smaller Liberal Democrats opposition party, Paddy Ashdown, 
called on the government to offer British nationality to those born in Hong 
Kong as what he termed "an ultimate insurance policy" against a possible 
authoritarian takeover by a Chinese regime. 
</P>
<P>
Ashdown, who once studied in China and speaks Chinese, said: "If the upshot of 
this struggle for power in China is not a return to democracy and reform, then 
in my view the British government is going to have to think very seriously 
about mechanisms for providing the people of Hong Kong the ultimate insurance 
policy of somewhere to go to at the end of the day." 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's executive and legislative counselors held an emergency meeting 
Monday and issued a statement condemning the violence in Beijing. 
</P>

Schoenberger reported from Hong Kong and Marshall from London.

A Vatican postage stamp issued to commemorate Pope John Paul II's trip to 
Scandinavia contains a mistake in Latin, the Italian news agency ANSA reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Latin writing on the stamp was supposed to say: "John Paul the Second 
Visits Norway, Iceland, Finland, Denmark and Sweden," but instead of the Latin 
word for Sweden -- Svetiam -- the stamp has Svebiam, the agency reported. 
Svebiam means Swabia, a region in southwest West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Father Carlo Eger, director of the Vatican Latin foundation's magazine, 
Lattinitas, told ANSA that the mistake "is a huge error that should have been 
avoided." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "Latin, unfortunately, is on the decline even in the Vatican."

<P>
Gazing east from Finland across Europe's ideological frontier, Pope John Paul 
II on Monday lamented government repression of religious liberties in Eastern 
Europe and the Soviet Union as impediments to regional peace and development. 
</P>
<P>
The visiting pontiff chose the conference hall where the Helsinki accords with 
their human rights provisions were signed in 1975 for his policy address 
arguing that a shared Christian heritage should be a powerful catalyst for 
unity throughout Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Religious freedom can exist in various social systems. What the churches ask 
for is that religious life should not be denied the freedom it needs," John 
Paul stated in an English language address to a blue-ribbon audience of 
government officials, diplomats, intellectuals, scientists and businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
The Helsinki accords -- signed by 32 European nations including the Soviet 
Union as well as the United States, Canada and the Vatican -- established 
principles for peaceful cooperation, including promises to guarantee freedom of 
thought and religion, the Pope noted. 
</P>
<P>
"European nations have become more and more aware that the honest confrontation 
of ideas and convictions has been an indispensable condition for their overall 
development," the pontiff asserted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Regrettable' Cases of Denial 
</P>
<P>
John Paul, however, deplored "the gap between the stated principles and the 
grave hindrances faced by some communities of believers in Europe." He noted 
that he had in the past denounced "regrettable cases of the total denial of 
religious freedom to communities of Eastern Rite Catholics, which lost even the 
right to exist within the new postwar political and juridical structures." 
</P>
<P>
The Pope's reference was to the Soviet Ukraine, where an estimated 2 million 
underground Catholics in communion with Rome practice a faith that has been 
officially proscribed since Josef Stalin's day. 
</P>
<P>
Repeated Ukrainian requests to the Soviet government for legalization of the 
church as part of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of reform, known as 
perestroika, have been thus far unavailing. The Ukraine is certain to be a key 
point of friction during Gorbachev's expected meeting with John Paul at the 
Vatican later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters here Monday about a possible papal visit to Moscow, Vatican 
Secretary of State Cardinal Agostino Casaroli replied, "Clearly the possibility 
exists, but I personally don't think it will come any time soon." 
</P>
<P>
John Paul, the most traveled Pope in history, has said he would like to visit 
the Soviet Union but at the same time has made clear he would not go without 
being able to visit Ukrainian Catholics, whom the government regards as part of 
the officially sanctioned Russian Orthodox Church. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Serious Difficulties' 
</P>
<P>
Expressing satisfaction at the expansion of religious liberties in Central and 
Eastern Europe since the Helsinki agreement, John Paul noted that "serious 
difficulties" still exist in some countries. 
</P>
<P>
"I am thinking especially of those Catholic communities forced to live in 
underground existence; of young people discriminated against in their studies 
or careers because of their religious beliefs, and of dioceses deprived of 
their bishops," John Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
The Czechoslovak government, in particular, has been slow to allow replacement 
for aging bishops, and Catholics are sometimes stigmatized in other officially 
atheist societies of Eastern European. Under John Paul, the Vatican has 
patiently built bridges to the East Bloc, particularly to Hungary, which the 
Pope will visit in 1991, and Poland, where the church is the principal bulwark 
of the Solidarity union. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul's keynote address came on the fifth day of his Nordic tour after a 
Mass in which small delegations from the neighboring Soviet republic of Estonia 
were sprinkled among worshipers from Finland's 4,200-member community of 
Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea that religion is a form of alienation is no longer fashionable, 
because, fortunately, the leaders of the (European) nations and people 
themselves have come to realize that believers constitute a powerful factor in 
favor of the common good," John Paul told the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Religious freedom is consistently near the top of the 69-year-old, Polish-born 
Pope's agenda. With it, on a visit to rich and nominally Lutheran but staunchly 
secular Nordic countries, have come repeated papal calls for stronger Christian 
ecumenism, better environmental protection and injunctions against 
spirit-sapping materialism. 
</P>
<P>
"Religious life is not threatened merely by vexing restrictions," John Paul 
warned Monday. "It can also be threatened by the spread of false values -- such 
as hedonism, power-seeking, greed -- which are making headway in various 
countries and which in practice stifle the spiritual aspirations of large 
numbers of people." 
</P>
<P>
The Pope, who came to Finland on Sunday after stops in Norway and Iceland, 
continues his Nordic pilgrimage today in Denmark. He returns to Rome on 
Saturday after a final stop in Sweden.

U.S. Rep. Claude Pepper, the beloved champion of the nation's elderly, was 
buried Monday in this city where he began his political career 60 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Claude Pepper never forgot his duty as an elected official to fight for the 
common welfare," Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) told about 
1,000 mourners at First Baptist Church in the state capital. 
</P>
<P>
"His energy and his vision will be sorely missed as the Congress now moves to 
take up Claude Pepper's last testament -- legislation to provide long-term care 
for America's elderly," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
Pepper, a Democrat known nationally as a fighter for the elderly and the poor 
during his 41 years in the Senate and the House of Representatives, died a week 
ago in Washington of stomach cancer. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress and top Florida officials were among those attending 
Monday's service just two blocks from the old Florida Capitol, where Pepper 
began his career of public service in 1929 as a member of the state House. 
</P>
<P>
"He instinctively reached out to the underdog," said former Gov. Reubin Askew. 
"He was always willing to stand, many times when there weren't many people 
willing to stand up for other people." 
</P>
<P>
Pepper was buried next to his wife, Mildred, in a family plot at Oakland 
Cemetery in Tallahassee. The epitaph he requested was brief and poignant: "He 
loved God and the people and sought to serve both." 
</P>
<P>
Before the funeral, Gov. Bob Martinez signed a bill naming a new state building 
for Pepper.

TOPEKA FAILS IN ERASING SCHOOL BIAS, COURT SAYS

The school board in Topeka, Kan., has failed to carry out fully the mandate of 
the landmark 1954 Brown vs. Topeka Board of Education desegregation ruling, a 
federal appeals court ruled in keeping the case open. 
</P>
<P>
In an opinion published Friday but not made available until Monday, the U.S. 
10th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed an October, 1986, ruling that could have 
closed the case that paved the way for nationwide school desegregation. 
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that Topeka has not sufficiently countered the effects of 
both the momentum of its pre-Brown segregation and its subsequent segregative 
acts in the 1960s," the appeals court said. The panel also reversed a lower 
court ruling that the Topeka school district had not violated Title VI of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Case Reopened in 1979 
</P>
<P>
"We won. We feel vindicated by the decision," said Rich Jones, an attorney for 
the group of parents of 17 children that reopened the Brown case in 1979. 
Included in the group was Linda Brown Buckner, whose maiden name provided the 
title for the landmark 1954 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The court noted that neither the Topeka school district nor the Topeka 
community is actively resisting desegregation and cited the national 
recognition of the district's innovative curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
"This active engagement has largely been directed at concerns other than 
desegregation, however," the appeals court said, and "for the most part, the 
Topeka school district has exercised a form of benign neglect. 
</P>
<P>
"The duty imposed by the Constitution, and articulated in numerous cases by the 
highest court in this land, requires more," the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
The court sent the case back to the Kansas U.S. District Court, saying that 
Judge Richard Rogers of Topeka erred in requiring the plaintiffs to prove 
intentional discriminatory conduct. 
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that defendants (the Topeka school board) failed to meet 
their burden of proving that the effects of this past intentional 
discrimination have been dissipated," the court said. 
</P>
<P>
The case springs from the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on a class-action lawsuit 
filed by black Topeka residents against the school district. The lawsuit 
challenged the constitutionality of a Kansas law authorizing school 
segregation.

SEABROOK FOES HAPPY AFTER 717 ARRESTS DURING PROTESTS

Opponents of nuclear power rejoiced Monday over their three-day demonstration 
against the Seabrook nuclear power plant, which resulted in 717 arrests, and 
said it marks a new beginning for the movement. 
</P>
<P>
But plant officials called the protests an inconvenience staged for the media 
as plant personnel prepared the reactor for low-power testing this week. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety arrests were made Monday as protesters blocked gates to prevent 
employees from getting to work. On Sunday, police made 627 arrests after 
demonstrators swarmed over and under fences surrounding the plant. 
</P>
<P>
"The Clamshell's back and they're gonna be sorry," Roy Morrison, a member of 
the Clamshell Alliance that organized the protest, said of Seabrook supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Seabrook officials contend that the demonstrators are a minority, and the 
officials note that the $6-billion plant is on the verge of its first nuclear 
chain reaction after winning a low-power testing license last month. 
</P>
<P>
Plant spokesman Ron Sher said most New Englanders believe that the plant is 
safe, necessary and ready to produce power. 
</P>
<P>
Seabrook has been in the first stages of low-power testing for about a week, 
slowly warming the reactor while engineers prepare to withdraw control rods and 
allow the first nuclear chain reaction. 
</P>
<P>
However, the seaside plant still lacks a commercial operating license because 
it lacks federal approval of evacuation plans for the area in case of an 
emergency. And a planned second reactor was canceled because of financial 
strain. 
</P>
<P>
Low-power testing had been planned for today or Wednesday, but Sher said plant 
officials now plan to start testing the reactor sometime after Wednesday 
because a valve failed in a pump during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Paul Cronin said the high number of arrests does not paint an 
accurate picture of the strength of the protest, noting that 75 to 100 people 
were arrested twice Sunday and that perhaps 15 were arrested for a third or 
fourth time Monday.

GOP BLOCKS BUDGET OVER SCHOOL FUNDS;

MONEY FOR L.A. UNFAIR TO SUBURBAN, RURAL DISTRICTS, NOLAN SAYS

Assembly Republicans, protesting what they said was the use of state money to 
end the Los Angeles teachers strike, blocked passage Monday of a proposed 
$49.5-billion Assembly version of the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
The budget, which had been moving toward a two-house conference committee for 
further negotiations, failed on a 44 to 32 vote. It needed a two-thirds 
majority, or 54 votes, for passage. 
</P>
<P>
The protest was led by GOP Assemblyman Pat Nolan, who complained that his 
Glendale school district and other suburban and rural districts were being 
shortchanged by urban Democrats responsible for dividing up education 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan, in an emotional debate after Democrats rejected a budget amendment to 
provide more financial aid to suburban and rural districts, said districts 
throughout the state "have been cheated to help bail out the Los Angeles school 
strike." 
</P>
<P>
The Republican assemblyman distributed a legislative staff analysis showing 
that a wide range of disparities exists in education funding in the state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Blatantly Unfair' 
</P>
<P>
Nolan said that while the Los Angeles Unified School District receives $1,045 
per pupil in funding for various special education programs, a nearby district, 
Alhambra Unified, receives only $232 per student. He called the funding 
formulas used by Democrats "blatantly unfair." 
</P>
<P>
Republicans complain that money for the school strike is contained in a 
Democratic bill that contains $427 million in unspecified allocations to school 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats denied the claim. Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), who 
participated in negotiations with Los Angeles school district officials that 
led to a settlement of the strike, denied that any agreement was made in 
Sacramento about specific dollars going to the Los Angeles district. Waters 
called Nolan's ploy a publicity stunt. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans said they will continue to block passage of the budget until they 
win concessions from Democrats leading to a more equitable distribution of 
state financial aid to school districts. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) said the lower chamber will 
meet every day at 8 a.m. until there is agreement on the budget.

SAN DIEGO ZOO REPORTS THEFT OF RARE AFRICAN MILKY EAGLE OWL

A rare African owl was stolen from its cage at the San Diego Zoo over the 
weekend in an apparently well-planned heist that has left its mate disoriented 
and zoo officials angered. 
</P>
<P>
A female African milky eagle owl and its male companion were discovered missing 
from their cage about 6 a.m. Saturday by a behavioral observer on his way to 
another exhibit, according to Jeff Jouett, zoo spokesman. A two-foot square had 
been cut into the owls' wire enclosure. Three strands of a barbed-wire fence 
surrounding the zoo had also been cut, Jouett said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Methodical' 
</P>
<P>
"We only know that the person who took these birds knew what they were after," 
Jouett said. "They were very methodical." 
</P>
<P>
The male owl was spotted and recovered just before 7 a.m. in a tree near the 
enclosure but the female was still missing late Monday. The owls, the only such 
birds on exhibit at the zoo, were in the captive breeding program. 
</P>
<P>
The female is worth about $2,000 but "far exceeds that in value to the zoo," 
Jouett said. "The pair had just bonded and were mating. They don't necessarily 
mate for life, but it will definitely (affect) him." 
</P>
<P>
The male owl was hosed down in the tree so he could not fly and then was 
netted, Jouett said. "He was somewhat disoriented and was placed in 
quarantine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rare in Captivity 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police are investigating. The thieves are believed to have gained 
entrance over the barbed-wire fence between midnight and 6 a.m. Zoo security 
guards checked on the birds at midnight and again at 2:30 a.m. but would not 
have seen the cut portion of the wire cage because it was obscured by a tree, 
Jouett said. 
</P>
<P>
The African owl is not on the endangered species list but it is extremely rare 
in captivity, Jouett said. The Dallas Zoo and the Riverbanks Zoo in Columbia, 
S.C., are the only other zoos in the United States that have the birds. 
</P>
<P>
The owls are light brown with a black circle around their faces and have 
distinctive pink eyelids.

<P>
Agnos also appointed a "Task Force on Family Policy" to determine guidelines 
for allowing unmarried city workers to add partners, adult children and 
extended family members to the city's health plan. 
</P>

Though denounced by leaders of the city's Roman Catholic Church as an attack on 
marriage and the traditional family, the new law won the unanimous support of 
the Board of Supervisors before going to Agnos for his signature.

FRIENDSHIP FLIGHT: TONY CIRCLES THE GLOBE; 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE COUNTY BOY TAKES OFF ON ODYSSEY

<P>
There were no final instructions from father to son Monday morning before 
11-year-old Tony Aliengena of San Juan Capistrano nosed his family's 
single-engine plane into the gray spring sky, beginning a journey that is 
designed to make him the youngest aviator to circle the globe. 
</P>
<P>
But the fourth-grader -- who must pilot the plane unaided to land a spot in the 
record books -- had some emphatic advice to his father, who will sit beside the 
youngster in the cockpit during the entire odyssey of seven to eight weeks over 
the Arctic. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me, 'Don't touch anything, Dad!' " Gary Aliengena said with a smirk. 
</P>
<P>
With those instructions -- amid speeches, hugs and clicking cameras -- the 
pint-size pilot with the buzz-cut hair climbed into a booster seat to see over 
the cockpit and took the controls of the red-white-and-blue Cessna 210 at John 
Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Tony's 17,000-mile trip has been dubbed the Friendship Flight because he will 
deliver more than 50,000 letters from U.S. schoolchildren to Soviet youngsters. 
He also hopes to present Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev with a massive 
"friendship scroll," filled with youngsters' signatures gathered along the way. 
</P>
<P>
It is a heady undertaking for any pilot, but at a press conference before his 
takeoff, Tony, in his own way, gently reminded the reporters shouting questions 
at him on the Tarmac that he is, after all, only a kid. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he envisions his meeting with Gorbachev, Tony replied: "I'll shake 
his hand. Then he'll say something. Then I'll show him my scroll." 
</P>
<P>
And he insisted that he is not nervous about flying so far and over the 
forbidding breadth of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like flying anywhere," he said, standing on a stool so he could be seen 
while speaking. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waved to Crowd on Takeoff 
</P>
<P>
Then, after more interviews, autograph requests and pictures, Tony and his 
entourage were off, waving to the crowd of friends and journalists lining the 
runway. In his plane were his father and mother; his sister, Alaina, 10; a 
Soviet pen pal, Roman Tcheremnykh, and an observer from the National Aeronautic 
Assn., who is along to verify that Tony piloted the aircraft. Two chase planes, 
carrying luggage, letters, journalists and a film crew, are also making the 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
During the flight, Tony was confidently sassy, joking over the radio with Lance 
Allyn, owner and pilot of one of the two chase planes, about the chance for 
clouds and thundershowers. And when Allyn's bigger and faster twin-engine King 
Air plane was catching up to Tony's craft, the young pilot treated it like a 
friendly race, remarking, "Get your butt in gear!" 
</P>
<P>
His landing 3 1/2 hours later in Salt Lake City was marked by another moment of 
adolescent expression: a mad dash by Tony and his sister to the vending 
machines to fill up on junk food. 
</P>
<P>
Roman, however, lagged behind. The aircraft had hit turbulent skies, which were 
cloudy up to 19,000 feet. Tony's plane flew in clouds at an altitude of 15,000 
feet, unable to ascend higher because the cabin of the six-seater is not 
pressurized. The 11-year-old pen pal was plagued by airsickness three times 
during the 650-mile first leg, his first flight in a small plane. 
</P>
<P>
Tony, who suffered from the same malady during his record-setting flight across 
the country and back last year, made it through Monday's flight without 
recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
By late Monday afternoon, Roman was feeling well enough to venture out with 
Tony in a small boat on a man-made lake at the Salt Lake City airport hotel. 
However, the two quickly returned to solid ground when their vessel began 
taking on water. 
</P>
<P>
Before the first air mile was even logged on the Friendship Flight, Tony 
received a hero's send-off at Martin Aviation at John Wayne Airport. The site 
was marked by a giant arch of helium balloons in blue, red and yellow -- the 
mingled colors of the United States and the Soviet Union. Members of the group 
that organized the trip wore T-shirts emblazoned with the flight's logo: two 
hands -- one with stars and stripes, the other with sickle and hammer -- 
reaching across the globe. 
</P>
<P>
One Soviet official at the press conference at Martin Aviation called Tony's 
trip "a historical moment." 
</P>
<P>
Tony's trip will touch "millions and millions of children and open the door for 
global communication," said Gennady P. Alferenko, chairman of the Foundation 
for Social Inventions of the U.S.S.R., the Soviet organization that sanctioned 
the flight. 
</P>
<P>
Tony, he said, "is very famous in the Soviet Union" because newspapers there 
have already published many of the schoolchildren's friendship letters. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, my country was very closed. There was no chance to see other places," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling to other places and seeing other cultures used to be "crazy ideas," 
Alferenko said. "It's time now. Let's be crazy!" 
</P>
<P>
Edward J. Martin, 87, whose airfield eventually gave way to Orange County 
Airport, presented Tony with a bolo tie clasp emblazoned with the words 
Aviation Pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
Martin told the crowd that he is proud of the boy. While he said Tony probably 
did not need advice, Martin warned him to be careful of ice. 
</P>
<P>
"He's flying a very cold part of the country," he said. "If he gets into ice, I 
hope he turns around" and returns to safer skies. 
</P>
<P>
There were no crowds for Tony's arrival in Salt Lake City, but more than 100 
schoolchildren later showed up at the airport to sign the scroll. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very interested in the increased relationship between our country and 
Russia, and we just thought it was neat that this boy would do something like 
that on his own," said Diann Brown, who brought her four children to the 
airport from Kaysville, 40 miles away, to sign the scroll. 
</P>
<P>
"But I wouldn't want to do it," her 12-year-old daughter, Annamarie, added with 
a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Mayor Palmer A. DePaulis, presenting a proclamation to the young 
pilot, said Tony's mission represents "a hope that some of our young children 
can accomplish what the older generation has not." 
</P>
<P>
Today's flight plan calls for a two-hour, 350-mile trip to Denver. The 
entourage is planning an early departure to avert thundershowers that might 
reach the Rocky Mountains by afternoon.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GRAND JURY COMMENDS SEX-ABUSE 
SERVICES TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Grand Jury issued a brief report Monday, commending the new 
Child Abuse Services Team for its "good planning and coordinated effort" in 
handling about 3,500 sexual-abuse cases last year. 
</P>
<P>
The program was established in December, 1987, by Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez 
to handle the sensitive and special needs of child sexual-abuse victims 
involved in the legal process. The report said, for example, that previously, a 
victim could be subjected to as many as 25 "interrogations . . . often in 
intimidating atmospheres." 
</P>
<P>
The Child Abuse Services Team, with an annual budget of $234,382, includes 
representatives from the court, law enforcement agencies, Social Services 
Agency, Health Care Agency and private support groups. 
</P>
<P>
"This program exemplifies what can be accomplished when the county's private 
and public sectors work closely together," the grand jury said. "In spite of 
the role of child advocate being an unfamiliar one for the district attorney's 
office, the department has made the transition extremely well." 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury recommended that the supervisors continue funding for the 
program, despite their tight fiscal outlook. And it said the district 
attorney's office should "continue its active role." 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Campbell, director of the program, said it has been assured funding 
through November and is being reviewed for continued financial support from the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thrilled that (the grand jurors) were as supportive as they were," she 
said. "It's my hope that this program will remain funded; it's too important 
not to be funded." 
</P>
<P>
Budget officials from the county administrative office were unavailable for 
comment Monday.

MAN KILLED TRYING TO PICK UP ITEM ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Lakewood man who apparently was trying to recover a spa cover that had fallen 
out of his pickup truck was hit by a car and killed Monday morning on the 
Artesia Freeway, just west of the Santa Ana Freeway in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old victim was hit by an automobile driven by a Laguna Beach man 
who was in the freeway's middle lane, according to the California Highway 
Patrol, when he swerved to avoid the spa cover and found the victim, who seemed 
to be trying to make it back to the side of the freeway, directly in his path. 
The man was pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of the victim, whose truck was found parked on the shoulder, was 
not immediately made public.

RAZO LAWYER SAYS OTHERS COMMITTED 10 ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 10 holdups that former Harvard student Jose Luis Razo is accused of were 
committed by two or three different robbers, one of whom may be Razo's younger 
brother, the defendant's attorney said Monday during closing arguments of his 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
Razo, 22, told police and newspaper reporters in 1987 that he committed the 
string of armed robberies of stores and fast-food restaurants during breaks 
from his studies at Harvard. But during his monthlong trial in Superior Court 
in Santa Ana, Razo has testified that Richard Longoria, a neighborhood friend 
with an extensive criminal record, actually committed the crimes and then told 
him the details. 
</P>
<P>
State records, however, show that Longoria was in prison when three of the 
robberies were committed. 
</P>
<P>
In an often-impassioned, three-hour address to the jury, Razo's attorney, John 
D. Barnett, on Monday attempted to show how the evidence proved that there had 
to be at least two different robbers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a 5-foot, 3-inch Hispanic, a 6-foot, 3-inch Hispanic, a Hispanic 
with a mustache, light-haired people and brown-haired people," said Barnett, 
pointing out the various descriptions that the robbery victims gave either to 
police or on the witness stand. "The same person can't be all this. Can't be." 
</P>
<P>
Barnett said that, besides the fear of retribution, Razo had another reason why 
he could not name any other robbers except Longoria, even though that would 
have improved his chances for acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
"The answer may be in blood," Barnett said. "The threat of a long prison 
sentence cannot force him to mention his brother's name." 
</P>
<P>
Several of Razo's family members, friends and his parish priest were in the 
courtroom Monday, but his brother was not. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett pointed out that Razo and his brother, Albert, look "remarkably" alike, 
and that Albert Razo has wavy hair -- a characteristic cited by one robbery 
victim in describing the robber. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Barnett introduced into evidence a picture of Albert Razo, who is 
now 19. Razo's psychology tutor at Harvard, Ellen Herbener, had testified that 
Razo once mentioned to her that he was concerned about his "little brother" -- 
then about 16 -- committing crimes in the barrio. 
</P>
<P>
In his own closing arguments, Deputy Dist. Atty. Ravinder Mehta scoffed at 
Razo's new defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Razo testified in court that there is only one robber," Mehta said. "But the 
story Mr. Razo told you fell apart like a cheap suit . . . and now they're 
scrambling to bring in other robbers." 
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence whatsoever to consider that his brother committed" the 
robberies, Mehta declared. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Barnett, Mehta contended, had exaggerated the differences in 
victims' descriptions of the robber, which had been made while they were still 
shaken by the crimes. In fact, Mehta said, all but one victim testified that 
Razo was about the same size as the man who robbed them. 
</P>
<P>
Repeating an argument that has been the basis of the case against Razo since he 
was arrested almost two years ago, Mehta said that no one but the robber could 
have told police about the string of holdups in the detail that Razo did in 
July, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Razo provided police with dates, times, locations, amounts of money stolen and 
accurate, sequential accounts of most of the robberies, Mehta said. In telling 
police about the robbery of a Safeway market on Dec. 28, 1985, for example, 
Razo said that he hid in the bathroom until the store closed, and when he came 
out, he found a female employee doing some work near a clock, Mehta said. The 
employee said that the robbery began exactly that way. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Razo testified that he was interested in Chicano criminal 
behavior, and, after coincidentally bumping into Longoria one night after the 
first robbery, Longoria would call him at Harvard and tell him about each 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett argued Monday that Razo wanted to get "inside the mind" of barrio 
criminals because his own research at Harvard had shown there to be a dearth of 
good, first-hand studies about Latino crime. 
</P>
<P>
While getting so close to what were both boyhood friends and subjects for his 
research, Razo delved into the schizophrenic-like world of the drug PCP 
(phencyclidine), and suffered a toxicologically induced psychotic breakdown in 
which he assumed the persona of the robbers, Barnett contended. 
</P>
<P>
"Jose got the information (about the crimes) from other sources," Barnett 
argued. "He wasn't there . . . but in the midst of a dopamine (a brain 
chemical) storm, he became his subject. He became the savior of the world. He 
became the messenger of God." 
</P>
<P>
Barnett said Razo's psychotic state at the time of his confession, along with 
the lack of physical evidence against him and the discrepancies in victims' 
descriptions of the robbers, were enough to leave more than a reasonable doubt 
about Razo's guilt in the jurors' minds. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta answered that Razo was probably faking psychosis when interviewed in jail 
by a forensic psychologist because he knew it might help his defense. And he 
pointed out to the jury that all of the robberies occurred during Harvard 
breaks. 
</P>
<P>
Razo faces a possible prison sentence of 22 years on the 10 robbery counts. 
Jury deliberation begins today.

OFFICIALS SAY TOLLWAY DIRECTOR COULD LOSE POST -- OR PART OF IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
Unhappy with the way three Orange County tollway projects are being managed, 
tollway board members said Monday that Executive Director John Meyer may be 
removed from his job or asked to share it with someone else. 
</P>
<P>
Four board members said Monday that a move was afoot to replace Meyer or 
redefine his job because of the increased workload and Meyer's handling of it. 
The four spoke only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer, 57, who came from Florida 2 1/2 years ago to head the San Joaquin Hills 
and Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridor Agencies, said Monday he was 
unaware that a personnel committee had scheduled a meeting at 7:30 a.m. 
Thursday to discuss his performance. But he said he also had scheduled a closed 
session Thursday to discuss his agencies' personnel and management problems. He 
declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
"They should always be evaluating my performance," Meyer said of the board 
members. 
</P>
<P>
A state official who also requested anonymity said he was familiar with the 
issue and that he had heard that Meyer's job is "history, at least in its 
present form. He may be transferred laterally or become a full-time consultant, 
but I've been told he will not emerge from Thursday's board meeting intact." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tangled Over Legal Bills 
</P>
<P>
Meyer has tangled with some board members over a variety of issues, such as the 
agencies' legal bills, which have totaled more than $1.5 million in the three 
years that the agencies have been in existence. Meyer said Monday he will 
recommend that another law firm be hired to handle the agencies' contract work, 
which he expects will cost about $60,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
But board members also have expressed disappointment in recent months with the 
slow pace and increasing costs of the design work on the three tollway 
projects, about difficulty in obtaining information from Meyer, and about his 
management style generally. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such criticism, and Meyer's admission that he feels overworked, board 
members approved an 11.8% pay hike for him last March, to $95,000 a year. He 
had received his last raise two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Board members critical of Meyer, including Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, said 
they voted for the salary increase only because it was a cost-of-living 
adjustment and not a merit raise. 
</P>
<P>
A subcommittee was formed at the time to determine how Meyer's job performance 
should be measured in the future. That report has not been completed, board 
members said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The four board members who said Meyer's post may change said they would deny 
having any knowledge of such moves if they were reported now. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our own board members haven't been told what's going on, or even that 
there's going to be a closed personnel session," one board member said. "And 
I'm not going to jeopardize what I want to see happen by talking about it in 
public." 
</P>
<P>
Board members denied that they were trying to float a trial balloon. 
</P>
<P>
Other board members said they heard about a possible bid to strip Meyer of some 
of his authority but said they had not been invited to participate in Thursday 
morning's personnel discussion before the regular board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm making calls now to see what's going on," one member said. 
</P>
<P>
Another added: "I know exactly what's happening, but I won't tell you or anyone 
else from the press. There'll be plenty to talk about after Thursday's 
meeting." 
</P>
<P>
The two boards have a total of more than a dozen members.

OCTD HOPES IT CAN SET EXAMPLE FOR COMMUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pressed to meet stiff new clean-air regulations, the agency responsible for 
promoting car-pooling, bus ridership and use of home computers to reduce 
traffic congestion adopted a plan Monday to get its own employees to do those 
things. 
</P>
<P>
Approved by Orange County Transit District board members meeting in Garden 
Grove, the plan gives OCTD employees two extra paid vacation days per year for 
car-pooling at least 60% of the time, and four extra paid vacation days plus a 
chance to participate in special prize drawings for those who ride the bus to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, expected to cost the agency about $28,000 a year, includes a 
six-month experiment to evaluate the feasibility of having "select" OCTD 
employees "telecommuting on a regular basis." Telecommuting is use of home 
computers and fax machines to avoid travel to and from work sites equipped to 
handle such data transmissions. 
</P>
<P>
The plan must still be approved by the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District (AQMD), which last year adopted new rules requiring employers of 100 
or more to achieve an average occupancy rate of 1.5 people per vehicle for 
employees commuting to and from work. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the occupancy rate for OCTD's 1,478 employees is 1.1 people per 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
As part of OCTD's plan, additional vehicles will be purchased as staff cars so 
that employees will not need their cars at work in order to run errands during 
the day. However, OCTD officials said, they will attempt to prevent abuses such 
as employees' taking trips to get "haircuts" or conducting other personal 
chores. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to submit a plan by the end of June would subject OCTD and its 
officials to fines of up to $25,000 per day or a year in jail for each day the 
AQMD rule is violated. 
</P>
<P>
OCTD employees have been anxious about the plan, fearing that they would be 
setting a poor example for the rest of the county if the AQMD rejects the bus 
agency's efforts as being too weak. 
</P>
<P>
During Monday's OCTD board meeting, officials noted that recent critics of the 
agency's proposed system of employee incentives have seen their own 
ride-sharing plans rejected as inadequate by the AQMD. 
</P>
<P>
However, the plan approved by OCTD Monday does not contain a previous provision 
that had been proposed by the agency's staff but which was found to be too 
controversial -- a monthly salary bonus for car-pooling. 
</P>
<P>
OCTD officials said they will renew the bonus concept if the plan approved 
Monday does not succeed.

OCTD CUTS BUDGET 15% BUT MAINTAINS SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

In what may be the first overall budget decrease for an Orange County agency, 
the Orange County Transit District board approved a 1989-90 spending plan that 
is $21.7 million below the county bus service's current budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen this happen before," said county Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, 
who also serves as chairman of the OCTD board and as a member of the separate 
county Transportation Commission. "It sure would be nice if this was a 
harbinger of things to come, wouldn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
The 1989-90 fiscal-year budget, approved by OCTD board members Monday in Garden 
Grove, anticipates no major changes in service but decreases 15.6%, from $139.5 
million for the current fiscal year ending June 30 to $117.8 million for the 
new 12-month period that begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
OCTD board members also approved an 8% pay increase for OCTD General Manager 
James P. Reichert, from $79,113 this year to $85,442 for 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
The drop in the OCTD budget reflects a lull in capital projects, including 
design work on the elevated transitway for buses and car pools on the Santa Ana 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Operational expenses will climb, however, from $87.1 million this year to $93.6 
million in 1989-90, primarily because of increased labor costs. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the increased costs will be offset by a 5.7% increase in the amount of 
OCTD expenses covered by fare-box revenues, due to record-setting ridership 
levels already reached in recent months and to recently enacted fare hikes. 
</P>
<P>
The OCTD bus system is expected have about 42.2 million passenger boardings in 
1989-90, 19% above the 35.3 million boardings projected for the fiscal year 
ending June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Increased costs, including labor expenses, are "part of the general flow" and 
appear to be "not out of the ordinary," Stanton said. 
</P>
<P>
There was little debate at Monday's OCTD board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
A citizens' advisory group asked for larger, so-called articulated or flexible 
buses to run on key routes during peak periods because some people are now left 
stranded temporarily when buses are full. The group also recommended cuts in 
service for Dial-A-Ride, the district's heavily subsidized, door-to-door 
transit vans that are available by appointment for trips within small zones. 
And it also asked for installation of new equipment on buses that will accept 
dollar bills. 
</P>
<P>
OCTD officials said they are studying all three issues. Referring to Reichert's 
salary increase, board member John Erskine said Reichert's talents "compare 
favorably" with the executive directors of other transportation-related 
agencies in the county, and he performs without generating as much controversy 
as others. "I think he's a bargain," said Erskine, a Huntington Beach 
councilman who joined the OCTD board in January. 
</P>
<P>
In other action Monday, board members tentatively rejected a $450,000 proposed 
contract with the Los Angeles law firm of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher for labor 
relations work because the firm had insisted that its discount rates, built 
into the contract, should not be disclosed publicly. 
</P>
<P>
OCTD board member William E. Farris strongly criticized such secrecy in view of 
a recent grand jury report critical of county officials for not monitoring more 
closely the costs of non-staff legal services. 
</P>
<P>
OCTD officials said they will try to renegotiate the proposed contract without 
the secrecy clause.

MOVE IS ON TO THIN OUT DIVISION I; 
</P>
<P>
NCAA COMMITTEE PROPOSES REQUIREMENTS TO RESTRICT MEMBERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Hansen, commissioner of the Pacific-10 Conference, once watched tears come 
to the eyes of a university president as the man pleaded for his school to 
remain in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s Division I, the big time of 
college sports. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the type of emotion we are dealing with," Hansen told a group of 
several hundred athletic directors in Anaheim Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The issue at hand is the swollen membership of Division I, which stands at 293 
schools, 291 of which play Division I basketball. The prevailing sentiment 
among the members -- and particularly among the big-budget, high-profile 
schools -- is that some of the fringe schools operating a bare-bones program 
simply must go. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question about that," Hansen said. "There is currently great 
disparity in Division I, where there are programs with 25 to 30 sports and a 
$15-million budget, and those that don't average a minimum of six sports and 
have budgets of less than $1 million." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen, a member of an NCAA restructuring committee that is studying a range of 
issues including Division I membership, made his remarks at the Anaheim 
convention of the National Assn. of Collegiate Directors of Athletics, a 
professional organization that has no governing powers. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen painted a picture of a Division I membership that includes scores of 
schools that award minimal scholarships to athletes in sports such as track and 
field, schools that rarely send competitors to NCAA championships and an 
astoundingly high number of schools -- 102 -- that average fewer than 2,500 in 
home basketball attendance. 
</P>
<P>
The ability to compete in Division I basketball -- thus having a shot at the 
financial rewards of the NCAA tournament -- is considered the major lure of 
Division I. 
</P>
<P>
"You really have to question whether they should be voting with North Carolina, 
Syracuse and Michigan," Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA restructuring committee, chaired by Fred Jacoby, Southwest Conference 
commissioner, has proposed a set of requirements to make Division I membership 
more restrictive, among them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Minimum scholarship levels. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Minimum average basketball attendance levels, possibly 2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Minimum qualifiers for NCAA championships over several years. 
</P>
<P>
Those are criteria that are threatening to some schools, but the proposals drew 
minimal argument Monday, probably because they could not come up for a vote 
before 1991, and still face several obstacles before making it onto a ballot. 
</P>
<P>
There also is the logic offered by several athletic directors in attendance: 
How can you expect segments of the membership to vote themselves out? 
</P>
<P>
"We're not worried about it at this time," said Cal State Fullerton Athletic 
Director Ed Carroll, whose only concern among the criteria was the minimum 
attendance. Fullerton averages well under 4,000 for basketball. 
</P>
<P>
As part of an effort to entice fringe schools to move to Division II, Hansen 
said he proposes allowing Division II schools to be considered for the NCAA 
tournament, as well as enhancing the Division II tournament with financial or 
television guarantees.

BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK; 
</P>
<P>
LUKE RISES TO OCCASION FOR FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Matt Luke had an up-and-down season for the El Dorado High School baseball 
team. 
</P>
<P>
It ended with an up, as Luke went down the third-base line to steal home in the 
Southern Section 5-A championship game against Millikan Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got to third, I was talking to Coach (Steve) Gullotti about it," said 
Luke, who had led off the inning with a single. "He told me to see how far I 
could get off the bag. I just kept going." 
</P>
<P>
Luke, The Times' athlete of the week, broke a scoreless tie in the fifth inning 
with his run and the Golden Hawks went on to win, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about possibly stealing home before the game," Gullotti said. "Their 
pitcher (Todd Taylor) had a slow delivery. We felt if we got the right player 
in the right situation, it could work." 
</P>
<P>
Although Luke had only three stolen bases on the season, Gullotti believed he 
was the right man for the job. 
</P>
<P>
"Matt is extremely competitive," Gullotti said. "I would say he is one of the 
most determined players we have." 
</P>
<P>
Luke, who plays first base and pitches, couldn't crack the starting lineup last 
season as a junior. The Golden Hawks had Scott Tomko, an All-Empire League 
selection, at first base and several talented pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Luke also played basketball hurt his chances, because he didn't 
even throw a baseball until late February. 
</P>
<P>
"He had only one week to practice before we started playing games," Gullotti 
said. "He had no time to get into shape, especially for pitching. It takes six 
weeks to get your arm in shape." 
</P>
<P>
Luke was mostly used as a pinch-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"The other pitchers were in better shape than I was," Luke said. "I had also 
grown five or six inches in two years. My muscles hadn't caught up with my 
growing, so I was a little awkward." 
</P>
<P>
Luke, who is 6-foot-5, decided to be ready to pitch when this season started. 
</P>
<P>
During basketball season, Luke pitched twice a week. He was a teacher's aide in 
the physical education department during fifth period and spent some of the 
time throwing. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a lot for a teacher's aide to do," he said. "I would run some 
stuff to the office, then go throw." 
</P>
<P>
When basketball season ended, he was ready. However, three weeks into the 
season, he developed a sore arm. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Matt was just physically tired," Gullotti said. "He had played 
football and then basketball. By the time baseball started, he was worn out." 
</P>
<P>
Luke played first base for the next five weeks. He was one of the team's better 
hitters with a .406 average. Pete Janicki and Jay Hassel handled the pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"They were throwing very well, so we could rest Matt," Gullotti said. 
</P>
<P>
That rest paid off near the end of Empire League play. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Hawks had a crucial two-game series against Katella. Janicki and 
Hassel combined for the victory in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Gullotti called on Luke, who again was the right guy in the 
right situation. 
</P>
<P>
Luke pitched a three-hit shutout for the victory and remained in the rotation 
the rest of the season. He finished with a 6-1 record and 1.57 earned-run 
average. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Greg Hansell of Kennedy pitched a four-hitter, striking out 10, as the Fighting 
Irish defeated Saugus, 1-0, in nine innings Saturday in the Southern Section 
3-A baseball final. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Janicki of El Dorado pitched a three-hitter, striking out four, as the 
Golden Hawks defeated Millikan, 2-0, in the Southern Section 5-A baseball final 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK; 
</P>
<P>
ODEN HAS FIELD DAY WITH SHOTPUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Irvine High School volleyball player extraordinaire Bev Oden showed up for 
the first day of track practice three months ago, no one was more surprised 
than Irvine track and field Coach Herb Stockman. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Oden has been surprising everyone -- even herself -- with some 
outstanding performances in the field events. 
</P>
<P>
Oden, The Times' athlete of the week, placed fifth in the shotput (40-feet 0 
1/2-inches) at the state track and field championships at Cerritos College 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The feat is not so surprising, considering Oden's overpowering physical prowess 
-- she stands 6-feet-1 1/2, weighs 170 and has the quickness usually reserved 
for point guards. But her achievement is very surprising when one considers she 
did not even compete in track and field last year and discus, not shotput, was 
her better event this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, she chose to concentrate on volleyball. This season she earned 
All-American honors and was named the most valuable player at the state 
tournament, where she led Irvine to the large-school title. 
</P>
<P>
"I am just amazed," Oden said. "I think at the beginning of the year, I came 
out just to have fun. I met a lot of people and had fun at practice. I didn't 
think I would get this far, especially in the shot." 
</P>
<P>
Oden, who will attend Stanford this fall, only competed in track and field this 
season because her academic load was a little lighter than last year's and club 
volleyball practices did not conflict with track practices. She wanted to have 
fun competing, but did not approach her training frivolously. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not want to just go in there and put in half the time and just show up 
at meets because I didn't think it was fair to everyone else who put the 
(practice) time in," Oden said. 
</P>
<P>
Oden, who competed in the shotput and discus her freshman and sophomore years, 
had done well in the discus all season and was top-seeded in the event at the 
Southern Section 4-A preliminaries. But she had an off-day, and her throw of 
103 feet (more than 34 feet less than her personal best) was not good enough to 
qualify her for the finals. 
</P>
<P>
"At CIF prelims, a lot of wind came up and she was in the last flight of seven 
flights," Stockman said. "Maybe she was tired of waiting, but she just couldn't 
get going. (The wind) affected a lot of the girls, but it affected her the 
most." 
</P>
<P>
That same day in the shotput, she had a personal-best toss of 40-2 3/4 to 
qualify for the finals. 
</P>
<P>
"After CIF, when she didn't qualify in the discus, I was able to spend a little 
more time (with her) on the shotput," Stockman said. "And that is when she 
started throwing over 40 feet." 
</P>
<P>
After making an adjustment in her technique, Oden improved by a foot, throwing 
41-3 at the Masters qualifying meet. She was seeded seventh at the state 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Allison Franke of Canyon placed third in the discus at the state track and 
field meet Saturday with a throw of 158-feet 1-inch. 
</P>

Shelly Tochluk of Westminster placed fifth in the 400 meters in 55.81 seconds 
at the state track and field meet Saturday.

ALPHA MICROSYSTEMS RECEIVES GRANT FROM STATE FOR EMPLOYEE TRAINING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the past three years, computer maker Alpha Microsystems' financial 
performance has been, well, unspectacular. 
</P>
<P>
Because of that, the Santa Ana company had virtually eliminated its budget for 
training programs intended to sharpen employees' job skills or teach them new 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
Now, thanks to a $232,000 grant from the state Employment Training Panel, Alpha 
Micro is providing training to 132 employees in a 58-week program that began in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of this type of training usually has to be done by outside firms," said 
William Mitchell, director of human resources. "A company this size doesn't 
have the money to do that. It's very difficult to justify spending thousands of 
dollars on that type of training." 
</P>
<P>
Under the state program, Alpha Micro employees are receiving training in 
management techniques, basic skills improvement, customer service, and English 
as a second language, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Alpha Micro earned $3.3 million on revenue of $51.6 million for the year ended 
Feb. 26.

THEATER AND FILM / JAN HERMAN: REASON TURNS TO BITTERNESS IN DISPUTE BETWEEN 
UNION, THEATER LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jan Herman

<TEXT>
<P>
David Rosenak sounds like a reasonable man. He says all he wants is the chance 
for the members of his union, the Society of Stage Directors and 
Choreographers, to make a living sufficient to remain in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
"We are dealing with theatrical institutions that have grown enormously," 
Rosenak, the society's executive secretary, said recently from New York. "They 
invested millions of dollars in buildings. They hired business managers. They 
expanded their staffs. They bought computers. Now we want a commitment to the 
artists." 
</P>
<P>
David Emmes also sounds like a reasonable man. He, too, says he wants directors 
to make a decent living. But if all the union's demands are met, he says, it 
would seriously threaten the survival of many small professional theaters 
already teetering on the financial brink. 
</P>
<P>
"The people at SSDC are well intended and, indeed, artists in the American 
theater are not paid as much as they should be," said Emmes, who happens to be 
in the union as well as co-founder of South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa, a 
member of the League of Resident Theaters with whom the union has broken off 
contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Repertory is the only league theater in Orange County, among seven 
statewide and 67 nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"Happily, SCR is regarded as one of the better-paying theaters," Emmes 
continued. "But finally, the rubber meets the road. We have to raise more than 
$1.5 million a year just to keep the wolf from the door. Everybody is caught in 
some sort of funding crunch." 
</P>
<P>
Though they both sound reasonable, Rosenak and Emmes are also adamant about 
their respective positions. And their dulcet tones turn less agreeable when 
asked to predict what will happen if the union's 1,033 members nationwide 
decide to support their executive board and reject the league's final contract 
offer in voting scheduled for Monday in New York, June 15 in Los Angeles and 
June 17 in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's simple," Rosenak said. "If we don't get back to the bargaining table, we 
will definitely have a full work stoppage later in the summer, sometime in 
August. And we will hold up all productions for the fall season." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Emmes has no doubt that in the event of a strike South Coast 
Repertory will be able to get by very well, thank you. "We are capable of 
mounting an entire season without a contract," he maintained. "And it would be 
every bit as strong artistically." 
</P>
<P>
Both Emmes and the theater's artistic director, Martin Benson, say they would 
resign from the union, if need be, to stage the productions they already have 
planned. Additionally, they would hire free-lance directors who are not members 
of the stage directors and choreographers union. Ironically, they say, the 
theater's director fees already meet the scale being asked by the union. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenak said the union has proposed that mid-size "B" theaters such as South 
Coast Repertory pay directors a minimum of $8,000 for a production with a 
4-week rehearsal period. The current minimum is $6,986. The league has made a 
counter offer of $7,500. 
</P>
<P>
The major point of contention is the smallest "D" theaters. The union is asking 
a minimum fee of $2,750 for directing a play with three weeks of rehearsal. The 
union also wants all productions at these theaters to be covered at the end of 
six years. The Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers' contract that 
lapsed on May 26 required only two union productions per season in "D" 
theaters. The minimum fee was $2,541. 
</P>
<P>
(Theater sizes are defined according to average weekly box-office receipts. The 
507-seat SCR Mainstage has operated under a contract for "B" theaters because 
it grosses between $33,000 and $55,499 per week. The 161-seat SCR Second Stage 
has operated as a "D" theater because it grosses $17,999 or less. Since 1985, 
league theaters have been filing union contracts for their second stages. 
However, the league now maintains that these are not covered. The union 
disagrees, and the matter has gone to arbitration.) 
</P>
<P>
"If a director is lucky," Rosenak said, "he gets to do four or five productions 
a year. Multiply those minimums by five and you see the kind of compensation 
we're talking about. We're simply asking LORT to take a collective 
responsibility for artists who make it all possible." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenak said the union had been negotiating with the theaters since February. 
After both sides "seemed to have reached their bottom lines," he said, "we 
suggested bringing in a federal mediator. The league considered that and told 
us they would reject a federal mediator." 
</P>
<P>
It was at that point, he said, that the union left the bargaining table. Emmes 
sees the situation somewhat differently: "After the negotiations hit an impasse 
they said, 'We will just promulgate a contract.' I think the union was 
misguided and naive to think it could unilaterally impose a contract on the 
league. They thought enough theaters would sign. But the conditions were 
onerous." 
</P>
<P>
The union was formed 30 years ago when Bob Fosse refused to direct "Little Me" 
on Broadway unless he got an SSDC contract, Rosenak said. That forced the 
League of New York Theaters, as it was then called, to recognize the union. The 
Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers signed its first contract with 
the league in 1972.

SCR FAR EAST TOUR CALLED MORE PROBABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As previously reported in The Times, David Emmes has been exploring the 
prospect of an SCR tour of the Far East. Now that he's back from Singapore, 
Hong Kong and Tokyo, he says a tour is more probable than ever. 
</P>
<P>
The idea had been gestating for "roughly a year," he said. It was spurred by 
Susan Whitten, a member of SCR's support guild who has overseas business 
interests and told officials of the Singapore Festival of Arts about the 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
Emmes estimates that it will cost "roughly $100,000" to take a production to 
Singapore in the third week of June, 1990. The government-sponsored festival 
has offered to put up $50,000. In addition, officials have indicated that free 
air fares and hotel accommodations could be arranged. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful we can raise another $50,000 from multinational corporations 
that are based in California and have not heretofore supported us," Emmes said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the choice of play is entirely SCR's, festival officials have 
suggested that "something celebratory" would be appropriate, Emmes said. "So we 
thought we might look at our recent repertory. 'You Never Can Tell' would fit." 
Shaw's romantic comedy was a Mainstage hit in March. 
</P>
<P>
SCR might also bring a new American play as a second offering. Emmes declined 
to name it because he is still trying to acquire rights for a Second-Stage 
production next season. 
</P>
<P>
The first American theater troupe to be invited to the 12-year-old biannual 
festival was San Francisco's Magic Theatre. The company staged Sam Shepard's 
"Fool for Love" last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a very strong experience," said Magic Theatre's artistic director John 
Lion. "The play was considered very daring. We sold out, and we got standing 
ovations." 
</P>
<P>
A weeklong SCR engagement in Hong Kong immediately following Singapore is also 
being firmed up, Emmes said. But plans for a stop in Tokyo, while still being 
pursued, are more remote. He said the entire trip would take four weeks. JAN

COUNCILMEN OFFER REFORMS TO BOLSTER CITY'S ETHICS CODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid a chorus of calls for a strengthening of the city's code of ethics, three 
Los Angeles city councilmen Monday unveiled a package of reforms that would 
prohibit outside employment by city officials, cut down on contributions from 
parties with City Hall dealings and institute a permanent city ethics officer. 
</P>
<P>
Under the reforms, former city officials would be permanently barred from 
lobbying on any matter in which they were personally involved, and they would 
face a moratorium on lobbying on any matter for a set period of time after 
leaving office. 
</P>
<P>
Although Councilmen John Ferraro, Michael Woo and Marvin Braude said they were 
not "prejudging" Mayor Tom Bradley, the suggested ban on outside income struck 
directly at one of the allegations swirling around the five-term mayor. The 
city attorney is investigating, among other things, whether the mayor violated 
conflict-of-interest rules in accepting payment from two local financial 
institutions for acting as their adviser. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prompted by Investigations 
</P>
<P>
The councilmen made clear that publicity about the myriad investigations into 
Bradley's financial affairs prompted their proposal, which will be forwarded to 
the council's Governmental Operations Committee for hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"We all feel this is a window of opportunity," said Braude, who appeared with 
his colleagues at a City Hall press conference. "This is a time for reform, and 
we all want to take advantage of that time and opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, in a statement released by his office, said he was "delighted" by the 
council proposals. But he issued a slap at the Governmental Operations 
Committee, led by Woo, which Bradley said has failed to act for two years on a 
mayoral initiative to curtail the power of local lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley also criticized the council members' attempt to render moot the 
conclusions of the mayor's own committee, appointed last April to strengthen 
ethics laws. Under a schedule outlined Monday by Woo, the new proposals will be 
heard by the full council in mid-summer, months before the Bradley panel will 
report its findings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ethics Panel Report 
</P>
<P>
"I would not want to preempt the work of the (ethics) panel by rashly adopting 
a proposal today while the panel is in the midst of their work," the mayor 
said. "Since the lobbyist legislation sat idle in committee for two years, I 
believe we can wait two or three more months to receive the recommendations of 
the ethics panel." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Bradley's criticism, the council members' proposal won swift acceptance 
from the citizens' lobby Common Cause. Assistant Executive Director Mark Haarar 
said in a prepared statement that the package showed the council members 
"recognized the shortcomings of the system as it exists." 
</P>
<P>
"If enacted and enforced, (the reforms) can go a long way toward restoring the 
public's confidence in their elected officials," Haarar said. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. James K. Hahn, whose office would be called upon to prosecute 
matters investigated by the ethics officer, issued a preliminary approval of 
the proposals through a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"City Atty. Hahn thinks that this is definitely a step in the right direction," 
said spokesman Mike Qualls, who added that the city attorney will withhold 
comment on specific proposals until they are fleshed out by council members. 
</P>
<P>
The city's current code of ethics has been unanimously and sharply rapped in 
recent weeks as vague and ineffective. Council members and the mayor have 
repeatedly called for a strengthening of the code, as have members of the 
ethics commission. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the plan, council members were nonplussed about the impact their 
proposals would have on Bradley's ethics commission. Woo said he hopes to call 
commission members to testify before his committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Wanted to Move Ahead' 
</P>
<P>
"If they have something that's better, we would like to hear from them," 
Ferraro added. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor appointed that committee," he said. "We wanted to move ahead. We 
didn't want to sit around and wait for a period of time that could be several 
months." 
</P>
<P>
The proposals suggested by the council members covered a wide range of 
activities but frequently omitted specifics. In general, they would dictate the 
conduct of all elected officials as well as the city's full-time public works 
commissioners. Other city employees would be affected under certain 
suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
In the area most closely linked to the Bradley controversy, the package would 
prohibit any outside income, including honorariums, for elected officials and 
would preclude service as a director or officer of any business. The mayor 
received $18,000 last year to serve as an adviser to Far East National Bank. He 
later returned the money. He also received up to $24,000 a year from 1978 until 
last year to serve on the board of directors of Valley Federal Savings &amp; 
Loan. 
</P>
<P>
Outside employment by other city officials would be subject to the approval of 
department managers and the council. 
</P>
<P>
Gifts and campaign contributions that exceeded a set amount from people or 
businesses with matters pending before a city body such as the council would be 
banned for a set period of time before and after a decision on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal did not stipulate a preferred amount or a time period. "We'll be 
working on the details in the committee," Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Current, Future Activities 
</P>
<P>
In addition to controlling outside interests, the proposals also sought to 
limit current and future activities of city officials. Travel that is financed 
by outside entities would have to be approved in advance by the council. 
Employees would be barred from negotiating for future employment with any 
entity that has business pending before a city agency and would be permanently 
prohibited from lobbying on issues with which they were involved. 
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive ban on all lobbying would also take effect for an undetermined 
length of time after an employee leaves city service. 
</P>
<P>
All violations will be misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
The city ethics officer, a new position, would be nominated by a committee of 
senior elected officials and confirmed by the council and would take charge of 
various ethics-related responsibilities that are now spread across a range of 
city offices.

EXPERTS RATE VOTE OUTLOOK -- IT'S APATHY HANDS DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spurred by fear that predicting a low voter turnout would only increase the 
apathy level at the polls today, the Los Angeles city clerk's office decided to 
forgo its traditional election eve projection, a spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But consultants to candidates in the handful of contests to be decided and 
other political experts said they would not be surprised if the Los Angeles 
runoff election sets a record for low turnout. With just one City Council 
contest, two school board seats and two Community College board offices on the 
ballot, turnout could drop below the 8.63% record low set in 1983, the experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The April 11 primary, in which just 24.33% of the city's eligible voters went 
to the polls, set a record for a mayoral primary, the city clerk's office 
records showed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Areas Involved 
</P>
<P>
Only two of the contests -- those for the community college board -- will be 
decided districtwide. The hottest contests -- Councilman Ernani Bernardi's 
challenge from firefighter Lyle Hall in the east San Fernando Valley's 7th 
District and school board races in the west Valley and the Westside -- will be 
decided only by voters in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
Consultants in the Bernardi-Hall contest expect a turnout in the district 
ranging from 12% to 18%. In the two races for seats on the Board of Education, 
turnout is expected to be higher than the city average but lower than in the 
council race -- probably in the 10% to 12% range, campaign consultants said. 
</P>
<P>
The consultants said most voters have little or no interest in school issues. 
Only about 11% of registered voters have school-age children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demographics Cited 
</P>
<P>
"The people most demographically likely to have kids, are demographically less 
likely to vote," said Parke Skelton, campaign consultant to school board 
incumbent Julie Korenstein of the Valley's 4th District. Korenstein is 
challenged by school Principal Jerry Horowitz. Skelton said families with 
children tend to be younger, more mobile and lack roots in a community -- all 
factors which reduce likelihood of voting. 
</P>
<P>
Such small turnouts can significantly skew the nature of the electorate and the 
outcome, said Bruce Cain, professor of political science at Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
In the Westside school board district, for instance, there are 7,000 teachers 
registered to vote, said Rick Taylor, a consultant to Mark Slavkin, a teachers' 
union backed challenger to incumbent Alan Gershman of the 2nd District. 
</P>
<P>
If most of the teachers vote, "and bring along their spouses or significant 
others," they could represent about 30% of the 30,000 total votes projected to 
be cast in the race, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
While the percentage of voters going to the polls could reach as high as 18% in 
the 7th Council District, it could also hit as low as 3% or 4% in South-Central 
Los Angeles or San Pedro, where only the community college races are on the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Community college board candidates face the traditional apathy of school board 
hopefuls, but have the additional hurdle of running citywide. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of today's turnout, the costs of an election remain constant. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Elias Martinez said that under state law, he is required to fully 
staff 2,800 polling places and have a ballot available for every registered 
voter, even though it is unlikely they will show up. Cost to the city will be 
about $2 million. If only 10%, or 180,000, of the city's eligible voters show 
up at the polls today, that would be a cost of more than $10 for each ballot 
cast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
VOTER INFORMATION 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles voters go to the polls today to choose a City Council member for 
the 7th District and two members each for the Board of Education and the 
Community College District. (Polling information: (213) 485-3581.) 
</P>
<P>
Also today, the city of Compton will choose a mayor and a 3rd District City 
Council member. (Polling information: (213) 605-5530.) Inglewood voters will 
elect two council members and a school board member. (Polling information: 
(213) 412-5280.) 
</P>
<P>
In other elections, residents in the South Pasadena Unified School District 
will vote on a ballot measure to increase taxes for school improvements. A 
similar bond measure will be presented to Lancaster-area residents in the 
Westside Union School District. Also, voters in the Three Valleys Municipal 
Water District in the eastern San Gabriel Valley will choose a director for 
Division 6. (Polling information: (213) 727-1900.) 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood polls are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. All others are open from 7 a.m. 
to 8 p.m.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'ONION FIELD' KILLER HELD ON RAPE CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jimmy Lee Smith, 58, one of two convicted "Onion Field" kidnapers of a Los 
Angeles police officer who was later murdered was arrested late Monday by West 
Covina police after a woman told police he had held her prisoner in her home 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
It was Smith's fourth arrest since his conviction, with Gregory Ulas Powell, 
56, for the 1963 kidnaping of Los Angeles police officers Karl Hettinger and 
Ian Campbell and the subsequent slaying of Campbell in a remote onion field in 
Kern County. The crime was the subject of Joseph Wambaugh's best-selling book, 
"The Onion Field." 
</P>
<P>
He was jailed for investigation of attempted rape, abduction, assault with a 
deadly weapon and false imprisonment, West Covina police Lt. Lee Rossman said. 
Smith had been doing renovation work at the home of the 36-year-old alleged 
victim, Rossman said. However, early in the weekend, he forced the woman to 
stay in the house and unsuccessfully tried to rape her, Rossman said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NO THREAT TO WATER SEEN ON LAB GROUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After weeks of dealing with worried residents and alarming reports of 
contamination, many of the public officials who got a firsthand look at the 
Rockwell International Santa Susana Field Laboratory on Monday emerged from the 
scene expressing relief. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has any reason to fear from any problems up there," said Mel Blevins, 
water master for the Upper Los Angeles River Authority of the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power and one of 70 officials who toured the site. 
"There's not any ground water or surface water flowing away from the area that 
has any pollution in it." 
</P>
<P>
Radioactive contamination of a portion of the 2,668-acre complex three miles 
west of Chatsworth was described in a preliminary report released last month by 
the Department of Energy, which has contracted with Rockwell's Rocketdyne 
division for nuclear work. 
</P>
<P>
The report found that while the pollution poses no immediate threat to nearby 
residents, more environmental tests are necessary to determine the extent of 
the contamination because of inadequacies in the company's ground water 
monitoring system.

<TEXT>
<P>
Judith Burke was walking back to her car on Bunker Hill after a pleasant 
evening at the ballet when she saw a group of tiny four-legged creatures 
executing a series of dazzling allegros and tours en l'air. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rats," she said. "Big rats. Huge rats. At least 200 of them, in a frenzy. 
They were in this lot, covered with weeds, where a couple of transients were 
sleeping. . . . I ran." 
</P>
<P>
This wasn't the first sighting of real rat-packers in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo Center -- where Burke's car was parked -- recently sent out a 
warning to its tenants declaring that "the Bunker Hill area is experiencing an 
infestation of rodents." 
</P>
<P>
Well, Burke and Wells Fargo may be relieved to know that the county's vector 
control program says it has found the cause of the rat boom. 
</P>
<P>
"There's this transient living up there. It's between Hope and Flower 
(streets), between 1st Street and (Gen.) Thaddeus Kosciuszko Way . . . ," one 
staff worker said Monday. "This guy sits there behind the oleander, reading his 
newspapers and eating . . . and leaving a lot of turkey carcasses lying about, 
with lots of green lettuce and stuff. That's a big food source, and it's 
created a large rat problem." 
</P>
<P>
And, to think, you probably suspected that the rats were unleashed by something 
like the Metro Rail construction project or the breaking of ground for 
skyscrapers like the Wells Fargo Center. 
</P>
<P>
Mention of Kosciuszko Way, the two-block tongue-twister named after a Polish 
general in the Revolutionary War, recalls a joke once recounted by retired Los 
Angeles Police Lt. Dan Cooke: 
</P>
<P>
"Back in the 1930s when I was growing up in New York, I remember hearing the 
story about a horse dropping dead on Kosciuszko Street (in New York). The 
policeman calling in to headquarters couldn't pronounce the name of the street. 
So he dragged the horse down to the next block." 
</P>
<P>
In a real-life situation years later, flustered Los Angeles police detectives 
tried to radio for assistance from Kosciuszko Way. "The location they gave 
sounded like 'Olivekosco,' " Cooke said. "They were asked to repeat it again 
and again. . . . Finally, they just said, 'One block south of 1st Street.' " 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood artist Dustin Shuler has been commissioned to build a sculpture 
consisting of nine automobiles impaled on a 50-foot spike for a shopping center 
in Berwyn, Ill., a suburb of Chicago. Some Berwyners aren't happy about it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pile of junk cars being put up, and you could just as well go to a 
junkyard and get the same effect," state Sen. Judy Topinka said. 
</P>
<P>
Shuler disagrees. "I'm dealing with the products of our society," said the 
artist, whose work has been displayed in museums and at art festivals, not to 
mention a Department of Motor Vehicles office in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
His nine-jalopy impalement, "Spindle," is reminiscent of a less grand piece, 
"Death of an Era," in which he dropped a 20-foot nail through the roof of an 
unsuspecting 1959 Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
Shuler, who was hired to fashion "Spindle" by the company that owns the Berwyn 
mall, says the sculpture sets a good example.

2 MORE SURRENDER IN ALLEGED PHONY MEDICAL CLINIC CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two more officials with a chain of allegedly phony medical clinics surrendered 
to Los Angeles police Monday as authorities moved to close the clinics, at 
least one of which continued to operate over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Alan Miller, 38, of Van Nuys, an accountant for the clinics, and Frank 
Hegyi, 47, a Westside resident and a licensed chiropractor who worked as a 
clinic administrator, were booked in connection with several Labor Code 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
By Monday afternoon, the two men and five others who had been arrested 
previously all were free on bail ranging from $250 to $100,000 each, said 
Deputy City Atty. Ellen Pais. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Closed Doors 
</P>
<P>
Two of the four clinics -- San Cristobal Medical Clinic in Boyle Heights and La 
Familia Health Center in Wilmington -- closed their doors Saturday, but at 
least one has remained open. 
</P>
<P>
The state is preparing evidence to request a court order for the closure of all 
the clinics, said Sande Pond of the state attorney general's office. She said 
the process may take as long as a week. 
</P>
<P>
At the Santa Ines Medical Clinic at 2033 W. 7th St., across from MacArthur 
Park, it was business as usual Monday. A fourth facility, the Bonnie Brae 
Medical Clinic, operates at the same address, but it was not clear whether 
patients were being seen there Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A steady stream of patients walked through the double doors that lead up to the 
second-floor Santa Ines Medical Clinic. The patients had not heard about the 
arrests, and when told, some said they might not return. Several patients, 
however, said they were satisfied with the treatment they had received. 
</P>
<P>
Elena Perez, 34, has been making weekly visits to the clinic over the past 
year. Although the injections she receives have not seemed to improve her 
stomach ailment, she will probably continue to go for treatment, she said. The 
allegations against the clinic operators seemed to make little difference to 
her. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quits Her Job 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where else to go," said Perez, who said her ill health has forced 
her to quit her job at a downtown garment factory. 
</P>
<P>
Some health specialists who work in immigrant communities said the high cost of 
medical care and the lack of information about low-cost services drives many 
immigrants into the hands of less-than-qualified private practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
"It scares me because there are a lot of people out there who may not be 
getting the proper care," said Carlos Cuellar, a physician's assistant at the 
nonprofit Msgr. Oscar Arnulfo Romero Clinic, a free clinic serving the largely 
Central American community in the Pico-Union District. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrants tend to go to private, low-cost health clinics in the neighborhood 
because they are afraid of being turned in to immigration authorities if they 
seek service at public facilities, he said. Some prefer the neighborhood 
clinics because the personnel usually speak Spanish, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody can hang out a sign that says 'Clinica,' " said Fern Seizer, director 
of the Venice Family Clinic. "And most of us are not very sophisticated on how 
to judge quality of medical care." 
</P>
<P>
Among those charged in the case is Salvador Cano, 38, of Santa Ana, president 
of Santa Ines Medical Enterprises Inc., the corporate owner of the clinics. His 
bail was set at $100,000. Attempts to reach him through his attorney were 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mexican Medical Degree 
</P>
<P>
Cano, who has a medical degree from Mexico, faces 71 counts, including 
practicing medicine without a license, furnishing dangerous drugs and numerous 
violations of the state Labor Code and Unemployment Insurance Code. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Enriqueta Silva, 40, a licensed physician, was charged with lending 
her medical license to Cano and similar Labor Code and Unemployment Insurance 
Code violations. 
</P>
<P>
Also accused are James E. Mack, 68, of Studio City, a disbarred attorney; Kelly 
S. Klatt, 36, of San Pedro, a Los Angeles police officer on disability leave, 
and, Klatt's wife, Samantha, 37. 
</P>
<P>
Arraignment has been scheduled for June 23, said Pais, who filed the original 
74-count criminal complaint.

FOES OF ROAD WIN DELAY AFTER CHAINING SELVES TO EARTHMOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seemed like a scene from the 1960s Monday when two dozen demonstrators 
marched on a Tarzana construction site to fight a new roadway into a Santa 
Monica Mountains park, chaining themselves to earthmovers. 
</P>
<P>
After a five-hour standoff that ended without arrests or injuries, the 
developer agreed to temporarily halt his project. And the protesters pledged to 
negotiate with Los Angeles City officials over the city's requirement that the 
roadway be built. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fighting Requirement 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists are fighting a city requirement that developer Harlan Lee 
pave an extension of Reseda Boulevard southward into the Santa Monica Mountains 
as part of the 178-home luxury subdivision he plans to build. 
</P>
<P>
Workers starting construction of the road were blocked at 6:15 a.m. when 10 
protesters jumped in front of bulldozers and chained themselves to the 
equipment. Another 15 protesters chanted and made coyote-like cries from the 
sidelines -- startling two deer grazing on a nearby hillside. 
</P>
<P>
The protest was called off at 11:20 a.m. when Sierra Club leader Jill Swift 
used a news reporter's car phone to arrange the Thursday meeting with 
Councilman Marvin Braude, and Lee pledged to shut his project down until then. 
</P>
<P>
Jubilant protesters cheered and hugged one another as they removed their chains 
and leaped off the earthmoving equipment in rugged Caballero Canyon at the 
southern edge of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
They said they hope Braude will waive the road requirement, which would link 
Reseda Boulevard for the first time with an unpaved portion of the mountains' 
Mulholland Drive. The environmentalists said they fear that the boulevard 
extension will hasten other development in the mountains -- including proposed 
garbage dumps in Rustic and Sullivan canyons near Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Still Have My Chain' 
</P>
<P>
"We hope we can get a continued moratorium," said Deborah Widel, a Northridge 
resident who had padlocked herself to the front of a 20-ton earthmover. "I 
still have my chain. I'm definitely prepared to do what I have to do again." 
</P>
<P>
Hours after the protest ended, Braude held out little hope that the road 
requirement will be abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city has long looked to Reseda Boulevard as an important public 
entryway to mountain wilderness recreation areas of Topanga State Park. If Lee 
does not build the road, taxpayers will have to pay for its construction later, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Braude dismissed suggestions that the road's extension will hasten development 
of the mountains and lead to the creation of canyon landfills between the 
Valley and the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"The road will be reviewed again," Braude said. But he stressed that he will 
continue to support the boulevard extension "until I can be shown how you 
satisfy the needs of the public some other way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Supported by Homeowners 
</P>
<P>
Braude's position was supported by leaders of the Tarzana Property Owners Assn. 
Joel Palmer, president of the residents group, said its members prefer that 
Reseda Boulevard be used for mountain access instead of other residential 
streets in their community. 
</P>
<P>
Bulldozer operator Trace Greenelsh of Cypress said he quickly shut his machine 
down when protester Janice Wilson of Simi Valley stood in front of its blade 
and demonstrator Ben Rosenfeld of Tarzana leaped into his cab and chained 
himself to it. Both are members of an ecology group called Earth First! 
</P>
<P>
"I was real little in the '60s when things like this used to happen," said 
Greenelsh, 30. "I never thought I'd see anything like this."

FAMILY PLANNING FUND BATTLE PRESSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARISSE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a new fiscal year rapidly approaching and Gov. George Deukmejian holding 
fast to his threat to eliminate funding for the state's family planning 
program, local family planning officials Monday stepped up their campaign to 
keep the program's multimillion-dollar budget intact. 
</P>
<P>
Stacks of postcards pre-addressed to the governor awaited patients visiting 
T.H.E. Clinic for Women in South Los Angeles, where officials gathered to 
protest the proposed budget cuts that would eliminate the state's Office of 
Family Planning and the $36.2 million it distributes to more than 170 clinics 
in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned that he virtually re-funded every program he'd cut back with 
the exception of (ours). . . . That's the urgency," said Thomas C. Kring, 
executive director of the Los Angeles Regional Family Planning Council, which 
is participating in a statewide letter-writing campaign to Deukmejian. "We're 
the only one that he's totally eliminated, and that's scary as hell." 
</P>
<P>
Kring was referring to the governor's announcement Thursday to fund several 
health and welfare programs that he had previously marked for substantial cuts. 
The funding restoration was attributed to the discovery of a $2.5-billion state 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Included 
</P>
<P>
However, the state family planning program was not included in the governor's 
proposal. Kring said the effects of the cuts, which could cause the closure of 
more than half of the 82 clinics subsidized by the state, are already being 
felt as staff members leave and patients stop coming to clinics that they 
believe may soon close. 
</P>
<P>
The clinics provide a wide range of medical services ranging from pre-natal 
care to AIDS testing. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we're being held hostage," said Kring, who believes that the 
governor is using the clinics' funding as a bargaining chip for his other 
budgetary goals. "And when I say we, I'm talking about low-income women . . . 
the poorest of the poor receiving care through these programs." 
</P>
<P>
Though family planning services get some federal funding and private donations, 
officials estimate that more than half of the county clinics subsidized by the 
program would have to close if the $9.4 million they now receive is eliminated. 
The cut would affect more than 100,000 clients, according to Kring, many of 
whom are newly arrived immigrants with no access to welfare programs. 
</P>
<P>
Without the state subsidized services, most of the women will go without 
medical care, according to clinic directors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Insurance 
</P>
<P>
"They will be dying," said Catherine Wiley, who runs four comprehensive health 
care clinics in Los Angeles. "They do not have health insurance, they do not 
have money and most don't have Medi-Cal. . . . There's no other place for them 
to go." 
</P>
<P>
Southern California family planning officials plan to hand deliver nearly 
30,000 postcards to the governor's Los Angeles office June 15, asking him to 
restore the program's funding, Kring said. He added that a similar delivery 
will be made to Sacramento sometime this month, in the last days before a new 
fiscal year begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drive Began in February 
</P>
<P>
The letter-writing campaign, coordinated by the California Reproductive Health 
Assn., began in late February, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Beermann of the governor's Sacramento office said Deukmejian had received 
thousands of letters and cards concerning the family planning issue. But he 
added that whether such funding will be a part of the budget is "the subject of 
negotiations between the governor and the legislative leadership."

The first tropical storm of the season in the eastern Pacific has been 
downgraded to a tropical depression and probably will dissipate within 24 
hours, the National Hurricane Center said Monday. The storm, named Adolph, was 
centered Monday about 1,400 miles southwest of the southern tip of Baja

NEW BATTLE LOOMS OVER SYNDICATION RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Few issues today have galvanized the diverse elements of the entertainment 
industry more than the battle over whether the three major television networks 
should be allowed to syndicate and hold a financial interest in TV reruns. 
</P>
<P>
The recently rekindled battle over the question promises to be a hard-fought, 
bitter one whose outcome could dramatically alter the makeup of the Hollywood 
production industry. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute, which heated up here in the early 1980s, is brewing once again as 
ABC, CBS and NBC step up their efforts to seek repeal of the 19-year-old rules 
that bar the three networks from sharing in the more than $1-billion market for 
TV syndication rights. The rules also preclude the networks from having a 
financial interest in programs they commission from outside production 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Massing forces to oppose the networks and to keep the rule is a new coalition 
of movie studios aligned with more than 200 television production companies, 
independent television stations, the Screen Actors Guild, the Caucus of 
Producers, Writers and Directors, consumer groups and others. Their umbrella 
bears the name of the Coalition to Preserve the Financial Interest and 
Syndication Rule. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, recently 
described the diverse coalition as a "truth squad" whose battle plan is to 
counter the "trimonopoly" of the commercial TV networks on this issue. 
</P>
<P>
"The possible collapse of these rules frightens all of the people in this 
business more than any of our singular differences," Valenti said of the broad 
array of coalition members. 
</P>
<P>
The long and contentious fight centers on the financial interest and 
syndication rules that were adopted by the Federal Communications Commission in 
1970 to guard against network dominance of the television industry. 
</P>
<P>
More than six years ago, when the rules were challenged in an expensive 
lobbying battle here, the FCC proposed easing its restrictions on the networks. 
But a spate of congressional hearings, a parade of Hollywood stars, legislation 
on Capitol Hill and the involvement of then-President Reagan led to the 
withdrawal of the FCC proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the three networks, where top management has changed since the last fight, 
are again challenging the validity of the financial interest and syndication 
rules in a changing media marketplace that includes increased competition from 
independent television stations, cable TV and VCRs, along with expanding 
foreign markets. The industry also says that the proposed merger between Time 
Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. may mandate changes in old ways of doing 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Fueling the renewed interest in the issue is the fact that beginning next year, 
a part of the Justice Department consent decrees with each network will expire, 
permitting them to produce all 22 hours of their weekly prime-time schedule if 
they choose to, compared to five hours now. (The consent decrees with the 
networks stemmed from a 1974 Justice Department antitrust suit that charged the 
networks with using their powers to monopolize prime-time programming and 
restrain competition.) 
</P>
<P>
With all of these new factors to be weighed, the key issue still remains: 
Should the 1970 financial interest and syndication rules be retained or 
repealed? 
</P>
<P>
Pro 
</P>
<P>
Independent producers, distributors, independent television stations and others 
argue that any relaxation of the rules will "reduce competition, stifle 
innovation and diminish program diversity." 
</P>
<P>
The advocates for retention argue that before the rules existed, the networks 
took a financial interest in 93% of all independently produced programs 
broadcast in prime time. Without the rules, they contend, independent producers 
who rely on syndication to generate profits on programs initially produced at a 
deficit for the networks would be forced to accept financial terms that might 
jeopardize their ability to stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
Independent producer Leonard Hill says the FCC rules constitute "the godparent 
of my business." 
</P>
<P>
Independent TV stations maintain, meanwhile, that repeal of the rules will 
threaten their ability to remain competitive by limiting their access to 
programs. According to John Serrao, chairman of the Assn. of Independent 
Television Stations, 70% of all the syndicated programs and movies purchased 
for televison today are bought by independent television stations. 
</P>
<P>
"If these rules are repealed, the networks would be permitted to divert the 
flow of their off-net programs away from independent television stations 
favoring their own affiliates," Serrao, general manager of WATL-TV in Atlanta, 
said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph M. Baruch, founder and former chief executive of Viacom International, 
argues that the 1970 rules fostered development of a first-run prime-time 
syndication industry. Baruch is chairman of the Program Producers and 
Distributors Committee, representing 25 television companies, to oppose repeal 
of the rules. 
</P>
<P>
As evidence of the rules' success, Baruch points to more than 50 producers who 
provide over 60 different programs amounting to some 200 half-hours of weekly 
syndicated programming. Many of them would not be able to continue in business 
if they had to compete against the larger, richer networks. 
</P>
<P>
"If the rules are abolished, station program choices will shrink dramatically," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
Con 
</P>
<P>
"It is simply unrealistic to believe that (nearly) 20-year-old regulations 
should not be adjusted along with everything else to reflect today's economic 
and competitive reality," Laurence A. Tisch, president of CBS Inc., recently 
told a luncheon in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Tisch's comments, and similar statements by NBC President Robert C. Wright and 
other network executives in recent months, reflect a network consensus that the 
television landscape is vastly different than it was even just a few years ago, 
much less when the rules were adopted. 
</P>
<P>
They argue that developments such as cable TV have siphoned advertising dollars 
and audience from the networks, which they say contribute nearly $4 billion 
annually to the TV production industry. 
</P>
<P>
Network executives also point to other changes in the entertainment business, 
especially the blurring of distinctions between production and distribution 
functions. Some network executives also note that several Hollywood studios own 
TV stations and advertiser-supported cable TV program services, and that the 
new company created by the merger of Time and Warner Communications will own 
both Warner Bros. studios and one of the nation's largest cable-TV systems. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot stand by idly as most of the leaders of this community enter into 
direct competition with us for audiences and revenues in the distribution 
business, while piously preaching the sanctity of separation of functions 
solely as it affects us," Tisch said. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects 
</P>
<P>
Under congressional prodding to work the problem out themselves, negotiations 
between the networks and their opponents have been going on for 4 1/2 years. At 
times, the two sides have neared agreement, but spokesmen for both sides say 
privately that none is in sight now, which is why lobbying in Washington has 
intensified. 
</P>
<P>
Though the networks were soundly defeated in their last attempt to repeal the 
rules, the playing field has changed considerably since then. 
</P>
<P>
At the FCC, for example, there are now three vacancies, including that of a 
chairman to replace Dennis R. Patrick, who recently announced his resignation. 
Elections have brought many new members to Capitol Hill, and at the White 
House, former actor Ronald Reagan, whose ear was sympathetic to Hollywood 
concerns, has been replaced by George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The only certainty seems to be that, as Jay Kriegel, senior vice president of 
CBS, observed, "This is going to be a long, complicated process and it's going 
to take a lot of time to find a solution."

Just days before Chinese troops killed hundreds of people in Tian An Men Square 
over the weekend, a student leader predicted that "only when the square is 
washed in our blood will the people of the whole country wake up." 
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, residents are gathering in thick knots on nearly every street 
corner to express outrage at the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
Workers have pulled buses across Shanghai's main streets, a protest style 
echoed across China. 
</P>
<P>
Yet whatever the student movement hopes for a mass uprising in the provinces, 
the actual mood seems relatively quiet, with demonstration crowds since the 
massacre nowhere near as large as the 1 million marchers in Shanghai and 
similar big gatherings elsewhere in the few days after martial law was declared 
May 20. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese sources and foreign diplomats here and in other cities suggested that 
many student leaders became discouraged after their triumphant student strike 
-- which closed nearly every university in the country -- failed to bring the 
government around on reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the students went home," one diplomat said, "and the massacre caught 
them by surprise." 
</P>
<P>
And scattered reports from residents in other cities show a relatively mild 
reaction to the massacre so far. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of the student organizers, the democracy movement in Shanghai 
seems unable to muster a march of significant numbers. Workers are left to 
become the active in the movement through tactics such as blocking 
intersections to encourage a general strike. Some Chinese here and in Beijing 
have noticed that many of the most active workers have a motorcycle-gang 
quality, wear black clothing and seem to delight in producing social mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
But there apparently have been no vehicles set ablaze, now a standard feature 
at Beijing intersections, and there have been no confrontations here between 
troops and demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
On Shanghai's Bund, the old riverside waterfront, about 200 demonstrators and 
onlookers gathered in front of the City Hall at midnight to discuss the Beijing 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
Several of them went over to hold whispered conversations with some of the 10 
soldiers in front of the locked City Hall doors. 
</P>
<P>
Although there has been much talk about a general strike here -- a van driver 
said it was "inevitable" -- industrial disruption appears to have been brief. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a way to get a holiday," said a foreigner who has lived here two years. 
"Few people went to work today, often because the bus barriers allowed them to 
say they couldn't get to work, but most seemed to use the time for household 
chores, rather than marching down the Bund."

THREE COAL STRIKE LEADERS JAILED FOR VIOLATING BAN ON BLOCKING TRUCKS

A federal judge jailed three leaders of a coal miners' strike Monday for 
violating a ban on blocking Pittston Coal Group trucks with massive sit-down 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Glen Williams, escalating a judicial crackdown on the civil 
disobedience tactics of the United Mine Workers, found the three guilty of 
contempt of court and said they will remain in jail until they can assure him 
that his strike restrictions will be followed. 
</P>
<P>
"The strike will continue," Marty Hudson, the main strike coordinator, said as 
he was led away from the courthouse in handcuffs and leg irons along with 
Jackie Stump, the regional UMW president, and C. A. Phillips, a UMW 
International representative. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 miners in southwestern Virginia and West Virginia have been on 
strike against Pittston since April 5, after working 14 months without a 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
The federal action follows a state judge's decision Friday to fine the union $3 
million for violating an order against mass picketing and sitting in the road 
to disrupt Pittston operations in southwestern Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Circuit Judge Donald McGlothlin promised additional fines each day the 
prohibited activity continues, action that could bankrupt the UMW in two weeks 
if carried through. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Williams ordered 317 demonstrators who have been arrested since his 
strike restrictions were imposed to appear in court this month to show why they 
should not be held in contempt. U.S. marshals began serving subpoenas Monday.

BERKELEY, OAKLAND AREAS TO GET THEIR OWN AREA CODE IN 1991

Telephone customers on the Berkeley-Oakland side of San Francisco Bay will get 
a new area code, 510, starting in October, 1991, Pacific Bell announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The present 415 code, which covers the entire Bay Area, will continue to be 
used for customers in San Francisco, Marin and San Mateo counties and Treasure 
Island. The new 510 code will apply to Alameda and Contra Costa counties. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for new numbers for residential, business, cellular and computer 
telecommunications service prompted the change, said Pacific Bell senior 
engineer Jim Raber. 
</P>
<P>
The new 510 code will bring the state's total number of area codes to 10, more 
than any other state. 
</P>
<P>
Long-distance phone charges will not be affected by the change, Pacific Bell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, California got two new area codes. In 1982, the 619 code was 
assigned to the part of the 714 area serving San Diego and a vast, lightly 
populated expanse sweeping east to the Arizona border and north nearly to Lake 
Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the 818 code was given to the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys and 
other areas north of the Santa Monica Mountains and Hollywood Hills in the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell said the Los Angeles Basin will need an additional code "sometime 
in the next five years."

FALLING ASLEEP AT THE SWITCH;

MILLIONS OF WORKERS REGULARLY DOZE ON DUTY, AND INDUSTRY MAY BE TO BLAME.

Nearly two-thirds of American industrial workers regularly fall asleep on the 
job, leading to safety risks and poor performance, according to the largest 
U.S. study ever on the subject. The brunt of alertness problems are borne by 
shift workers -- electric utility operators, oil and chemical plant employees 
and factory workers who rotate through day, evening and night shifts at plants 
open around the clock -- the study of 7,400 workers by three California 
researchers found. 
</P>
<P>
The authors of the study, scheduled for release today at the annual meeting of 
the American Nuclear Society in Atlanta, take the nuclear industry, in 
particular, to task for failing to make the basic changes in scheduling and 
work rules that research and experience have found can reduce sleepiness on the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
Like many employers, the study says, the nuclear industry has relied on 
overstaffing of shifts and disciplining of sleepy workers to combat job 
fatigue. "This approach is not working," the authors say, "as evidenced by the 
high prevalence of sleepiness on the job." 
</P>
<P>
A series of disasters and near-disasters over the past 10 years has begun to 
increase American employers' attentiveness to the problems associated with 
shift work, the irregular schedules worked by 25% to 30% of American employees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1.25-Million Fine 
</P>
<P>
The accident in 1979 at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania; 
the release of deadly cyanide at a Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India; the 
Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Ukraine, and, most recently, the Exxon Valdez 
oil spill in Alaska, all occurred in the late night or early morning. 
</P>
<P>
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission was spurred to action in part by the 
discovery in 1987 of snoozing operators at the Peach Bottom nuclear plant in 
southeastern Pennsylvania. The commission ordered payment of a record 
$1.25-million fine by the utility that runs Peach Bottom and kept the reactor 
closed for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the commission followed up with a policy statement requiring all 
utilities to foster a "safety culture" at nuclear plants and demanding that 
plant operators "be continuously alert." 
</P>
<P>
But the regulatory agency has not spelled out the steps utilities should take 
to achieve greater safety and alertness. And the new study's principal author 
said in an interview that only a few nuclear plants have begun experimenting 
with the techniques -- from nap breaks to adjusted work schedules to 
specialized training for shift workers -- that can lessen the likelihood that 
employees responsible for critical tasks will doze off. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have a problem, let's try to look at some logical solutions," said the 
researcher, Richard M. Coleman, a clinical assistant professor at the Sleep 
Disorders Center of Stanford University's School of Medicine and president of a 
shift-work consulting firm, Coleman &amp; Associates, in Ross, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
The other authors of the study are William C. Dement, a behavioral physician 
and physiologist who directs the Stanford sleep center, and James B. 
Dillingham, a research associate at Coleman's firm. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers surveyed workers at 21 plants, asking how often they fall 
asleep during the course of a typical work week. They also asked if the workers 
had noticed bad or unsafe performance because colleagues were falling asleep. 
Most of the workers followed a rotational schedule in which they worked day, 
evening and night shifts in sequence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Night Shift Worst 
</P>
<P>
Among shift workers, more than 60% of those at petroleum and chemical plants 
and more than 50% of those at manufacturing plants and utility power stations 
reported nodding off regularly during stints of night-shift work. During 
day-shift assignments, between 27% and 35% said they fall asleep, depending on 
the industry. Sleepiness was reported to be less common -- but still widespread 
-- on the evening shift, when 17% to 28% of workers said they doze off. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, only 8% to 18% of workers on straight day shifts said they have 
ever fallen asleep on the job. 
</P>
<P>
Shift workers reported that their co-workers' fatigue hampers job performance 
and reduces safety. Between 50% and 70% said job performance in their plant is 
diminished by sleepiness, while 40% to 55%, depending on the industry, said 
they have observed accidents, near-accidents or poor safety practices. 
</P>
<P>
Schedules widely used in American industry -- rotating shifts with seven 
consecutive work days before time off -- were associated with both the highest 
levels of sleepiness and the worst job performance and safety, according to the 
study. Schedules with no rotation through shifts or infrequent rotation, along 
with time off after five days of work, resulted in the greatest alertness. 
</P>
<P>
Other sleep researchers said the new study's findings are similar to those 
obtained by European and Japanese researchers studying smaller groups of 
workers, and to those of studies in which workers' brain waves were monitored 
on the job to detect sleepiness. 
</P>
<P>
The experts also agreed with Coleman's recommendations for improving shift 
workers' performance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Approach Taken 
</P>
<P>
"We have to move away from just thinking in terms of discipline and staffing 
levels," said Timothy H. Monk, director of human chronobiology research at the 
Western Psychiatric Institute in Pittsburgh. "We have to be a little more 
sophisticated." 
</P>
<P>
One nuclear plant that has begun exploring novel ways to keep operators alert 
is Pacific Gas &amp; Electric's Diablo Canyon facility, south of San Luis 
Obispo. Control room operators work 12-hour shifts, allowing longer periods of 
off-time between work stints. A stress-reduction class is geared to the 
problems of shift workers and their families, offering advice on diet and life 
style changes that can make shift work less grueling. 
</P>
<P>
"We are vitally concerned about keeping our folks alert around the clock," 
explained Edward Conway, manager of human resources at the plant.

BANKS DROP PRIME RATE TO 11%, BRINGING RELIEF TO LOAN HOLDERS 
</P>

<P>
The nation's banks Monday dropped their prime lending rate -- the benchmark for 
many consumer and small-business loans -- to 11% from 11.5%, convinced that the 
weakness in the economy is bringing a general easing of credit. 
</P>
<P>
The move, which reversed a yearlong upward drift in the prime, was kicked off 
by Citibank, followed by Morgan Guaranty Bank, Chase Manhattan Bank, Bank of 
America, Wells Fargo Bank and others. The banks' action was based partly on 
expectations that the Federal Reserve Board will soon ease credit further by 
dropping a key rate it controls, the so-called federal funds rate, economists 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Combined with the drop in other rates since March, the cut in the prime will 
bring a measure of relief to consumers who have been squeezed since early 1988 
by hikes in their adjustable-rate mortgages, home-equity loans and other 
variable-rate borrowings. Some economists foresee a continued easing of credit 
that will provide more comfort for these borrowers and will help stimulate a 
housing market that has stalled in some parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"For borrowers who last winter feared floating rates would keep going up, this 
is good news," said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., 
a major government securities dealer in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve had been raising interest rates for about a year in an 
effort to slow down the economy and squeeze out the inflation that seemed to be 
building. But signs of an economic weakening have been accumulating in recent 
weeks, including reports showing a slowdown in housing starts and auto sales. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence strengthened last Friday, when a government employment report 
showed that job growth in May was about 100,000 jobs, half as large as 
expected. The report set off wide speculation that the Fed would begin lowering 
the federal funds rate -- the rate on overnight loans among banks -- after a 
year of increases that has raised it to 9.75%. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the medium-sized Southwest Bank of St. Louis announced that it would 
lower its prime to 11%, but no major banks followed suit until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Some maintain that the likelihood of a big lowering of rates by the Fed has 
been overstated. Even some of those inside the Fed who favor lower rates 
contend that any move is likely to be small. 
</P>
<P>
"There are several signs pointing to a modest easing, but nothing that warrants 
all this attention," said one official, who agreed to speak only on condition 
that he remain unidentified. 
</P>
<P>
Among the interest rates that have already declined are those on standard, 
30-year fixed mortgages, which have been easing since peaking in mid-March at 
about 11.2%. These mortgages are available for 10.25% in some places -- 
representing a healthy 10% drop in three months, said David Rolley, economist 
with the Drexel Burnham Lambert investment bank. 
</P>
<P>
"When your mortgage cost drops 10%, that's a big deal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many holders of home-equity loans will quickly be seeing a reduction in their 
monthly obligations, because many such loans are tied to the prime and are 
repriced each month based on the prime's movements. 
</P>
<P>
"These are still up sharply from a year ago, but a lot of people were expecting 
the next step in the prime would be to 12%, rather than 11%," said Paul Getman, 
director of financial services at WEFA Group, an economics consulting firm in 
Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
A homeowner with a $10,000, 10-year home-equity loan would be paying $137 a 
month at an interest rate of 11%, said Getman. Last year, when the prime was at 
9%, the homeowner paid $127. 
</P>
<P>
The prime's drop may quickly help stimulate more home building, according to 
Drexel's Rolley, because loans to many construction companies are tied to it. 
"There's been a lot of gloom and doom written about this part of the housing 
market, but they're going to breathe a little easier because of this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The general decline in interest rates has had less effect on the market for 
adjustable-rate home mortgages. That market has become tougher in recent weeks 
as lenders have withdrawn low "teaser" rates that had been offered at 4% to 5% 
below prevailing rates. After years of bruising competition, lenders decided 
that they had lost too much money and began pulling back. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some analysts believe that the real estate market has already been 
stirred by the decline in rates and that the situation may be more attractive 
to buyers by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"We seem to have seen some signs of new life in markets like Washington that 
had been dead in the water," said John Tuccillo, chief economist at the 
National Assn. of Realtors. He said the decline in the prime "has a 
psychological effect -- it makes people less fearful of what might happen 
next." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Ackbarali, senior economist at First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles, 
forecasts a continued fall in the prime that will bring the rate down to 9.75% 
by the end of the year. "At that level, many more home buyers can qualify for a 
mortgage, even in areas where the prices are above average," he said.

Two Insurance Firms Barred From State: Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie 
has ordered two Illinois insurers to stop doing business in California. 
Following a financial review, the Department of Insurance alleges that both 
companies, Mead Reinsurance and Amalgamated Labor Life, are threatened with 
insolvency. Department adjustments to Mead's financial reserves show a negative 
policyholder surplus of more than $47 million, with further estimated reserve 
shortages from $50 to $100 million. The Department order against Amalgamated 
Labor Life follows action by the state of Illinois in May placing the company 
under a notice of impairment. A financial review by Illinois regulators reduced 
a reported $3 million policyholder surplus to a negative $2 million.

T-Bill Rates Drop: The Treasury sold $6.4 billion of new three-month bills at 
an average discount rate of 8.17%, down from 8.50% last week. Another $6.4 
billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 7.99%, 
down from 8.36% last week. The rates were the lowest since three-month bills 
sold for 8.14% on Dec. 19 and six-month bills averaged 7.87% on Nov. 14. The 
new discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 8.46% for 
three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,793.50 and 8.44% for a 
six-month bill selling for $9,596.10. The discount rate reflects the price 
discount received when government securities are purchased at less than face 
value.

Hanson Selling Smith Corona Shares: Hanson PLC, which took over Smith Corona 
Corp. in 1986, announced that it plans a public offering of up to 15.75 million 
shares of its subsidiary. Hanson, which said it had filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission for approval of the offering, said it expected the 
shares to sell for between $23 and $25 each. The proceeds of the offering will 
go to Hanson, the company said in a statement. If all of the 15.75 million 
shares are sold, Hanson will retain approximately 46.3% of the stock in 
typewriter maker Smith Corona. Hanson, whose U.S. arm is Hanson Industries, is 
a London-based conglomerate that also owns Ground Round restaurants, Kaiser 
Cement, Endicott Johnson shoes, Jacuzzi Whirlpool Baths and Farberware 
cookware.

With just 201 shopping days left till Christmas, a retailing economist Monday 
hazarded a somewhat gloomy guess about what the holiday shopping season holds 
in store for merchants. 
</P>
<P>
"The fourth quarter will be tough," Rosalind Wells, chief economist for the 
National Retail Merchants Assn., said at the opening session of the trade 
group's midyear conference at the Bonaventure Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. 
"I'm skeptical that holiday sales will pick up much momentum." 
</P>
<P>
Lackluster sales would prove troublesome for retailers, she said, if they 
expect a repeat of last year's performance, when they scored an unexpectedly 
high 8% sales gain over Christmas, 1987. If they buy too much merchandise in 
anticipation of a spending boom, she said, they could get stuck with leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
That, however, would please bargain hunters by increasing the chance that 
stores will offer early markdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Wells predicted sales growth of only 5% for the fourth quarter, partly because 
of a slowing economy and partly because merchants' results will be compared to 
last year's surprisingly robust results. 
</P>
<P>
The opening session of the conference attracted only about 70 people. By 
contrast, at the NRMA's biggest conference, held each January in New York, 
hundreds of delegates crowd into a huge ballroom at the Hilton to hear

DOW FALLS 37.13, ERASING GAINS OF LAST WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Times Wire Services

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market lapsed into a steady decline Monday, pulling back after last 
week's climb to its highest level since the 1987 crash. 
</P>
<P>
Several individual stocks with operations or investments in China or nearby 
countries sold off sharply. But analysts said the conflict in Beijing and the 
ensuing break in Hong Kong stock prices did not appear to have any severe 
widespread impact on the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen 27.20 points on 
Friday, fell 37.13 to 2,480.70. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 3 to 2 in nationwide trading 
of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 609 up, 941 down and 450 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 163.42 million shares, down from 
229.14 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Windmere Corp. fell 3 3/4 to 15 1/4 in active trading and Lewis Galoob Toys 
lost 1 1/2 to 10 1/8. Both companies, which have production facilities in 
China, said their operations there had not been affected so far by the turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traders Take Gains 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Hong Kong Telecommunications dropped 2 1/8 to 16 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Among publicly traded investment companies specializing in Asian markets, 
Taiwan Fund dropped 3 3/8 to 36 5/8; Korea Fund 2 3/4 to 31; Asia Pacific Fund 
1 3/4 to 9 1/8, and Thai Fund 7/8 to 15 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, analysts said, it appeared that traders were cashing in on the 
market's recent gains, believing that it was due for at least a pause after its 
strong advance in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
The domestic business and financial news background was generally positive, 
brokers noted. Numerous large banks lowered their prime lending rates from 
11.5% to 11%. 
</P>
<P>
And a monthly survey of corporate purchasing executives gave further support to 
the belief that the economy was slowing, thus presumably giving the Federal 
Reserve added incentive to relax its credit policy. 
</P>
<P>
Losers among the blue chips included Boeing, down 3 1/8 at 75 5/8; General 
Electric, down 5/8 at 55 1/8; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down 7/8 at 
35 3/8, and International Business Machines, down 1 1/8 at 109. 
</P>
<P>
3Com Corp. tumbled 7 7/8 to 19 3/4 in the over-the-counter market. The company 
said its earnings for the fiscal quarter ending this week would fall short of 
analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilshire index of 5,000 equities closed at 3,181.284, down 27.355 from 
Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks dropped 1.60 to 
179.89. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Japanese Stocks Decline 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 4.47 to 368.52, and S&amp;P's 
500-stock composite index was down 3.49 at 322.03. 
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market slumped 3.79 to 
447.84. At the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index closed at 
359.58, down 0.89. 
</P>
<P>
The unrest in China also pushed Japanese stocks lower in extremely light 
turnover. The key 225-share Nikkei index fell 210.34 points or 0.62% to close 
at 33,457.08. 
</P>
<P>
British share prices closed weak but off their lows in moderate trading. 
Dealers said the market had failed to rise strongly on the mid-session news 
that the Bundesbank did not raise West German interest rates. The Financial 
Times 100-share index closed 11.0 points lower at 2,103.4. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar gained against most major currencies as investors turned to dollars 
in the face of the turmoil in the Chinese capital. 
</P>
<P>
Political uncertainty in Iran following the weekend death of Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini also encouraged dollar purchases. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever there's any kind of unrest anywhere, the tendency seems to be to buy 
U.S. dollars," said Thomas Palladino, an assistant vice president at the New 
York office of Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar temporarily traded lower early in the day as bank after bank 
announced cuts in their prime lending rates to 11% from 11.5%. 
</P>
<P>
The banks' moves were widely anticipated given the apparent slowdown in 
consumer spending and overall economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers resumed buying dollars, ignoring the possibility that lower 
U.S. interest rates might depress the dollar's value against other currencies. 
Chandler said market sentiment still favors the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The prime rate changes were overshadowed by violent developments in Beijing 
where the government continued its crackdown on civilian demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the dollar also benefited from speculation that the leadership of 
Iran could pass into less radical hands, paving the way for greater cooperation 
among members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. That pushed 
up crude oil prices, which are denominated in dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost $1.5815 to buy 
one pound, cheaper than $1.5900 late Friday. Later in New York, sterling 
fetched $1.5655 vs. $1.6040 late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the 
dollar fell 1.15 yen to a closing 140.65 yen. But later, in London, it was 
quoted at 141.75 yen and in New York the dollar increased to 142.95 yen up from 
140.50 yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
The political unrest in China stirred commodities markets, touching off a 
petroleum futures rally, depressing sugar prices and sending cotton futures 
tumbling to the daily trading limit. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is working on the assumption that there will be little buying 
activity from China in the coming days," said Arthur Stevenson, a 
Prudential-Bache Securities analyst. "The name of the game there now is 
survival -- not buying sugar or cotton or grain or anything else." 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, grain futures closed mostly higher despite rumors a big 
Chinese buy was being postponed indefinitely. Coffee futures were battered by 
signs of discord at the International Coffee Organization meeting in London. 
</P>
<P>
Sugar prices slid 0.16 cent to 0.23 cent lower on the New York Coffee, Sugar 
and Cocoa Exchange, with July at 11.25 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
The market climbed late last week on reports that China was preparing a major 
buy in raw sugar, and fell Monday on the belief such a purchase was no longer 
imminent. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton prices settled 2 cents lower across the board on the New York Cotton 
Exchange. The July contract closed at 65.36 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
"China is a touchstone in this market," said Ed Whitten, a trader with Balfour 
Maclaine Corp. in New York. "If they buy everybody gets excited, if they don't 
buy everybody gets excited." 
</P>
<P>
Grain and soybeans futures were mostly higher on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
Word that the Chinese had postponed a buy of up to 1 million tons of wheat 
pressured the market early, but traders managed to recover and move up in light 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Government bond prices finished slightly higher, extending the market's recent 
advance despite some profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year Treasury bond edged up 1/16 point, or 63 cents for every $1,000 in 
face value, as its yield held steady at 8.43%, the same as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Contributing to the advance were the dollar's strength and worries about the 
Chinese crisis, which sent short-term interest rates sharply lower as investors 
sought the relative security of U.S. government securities. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates in the credit market recently have receded to the lowest levels 
since March, 1988 amid widespread optimism that the apparent slowdown in 
economic activity will persuade the central bank to loosen its credit grip. 
</P>
<P>
Several commercial banks lowered their prime lending rates on Monday by a half 
percentage point to 11%. Those moves were widely expected and had little impact 
on bond prices, according to Elliott Platt, fixed-income research director for 
the investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Platt said selling by traders who wanted to cash in on recent advances in the 
bond market limited some of the price gains. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term 
governments were mixed with some rising 1/8 point and others falling 1/16 
point, intermediates were up 1/16 point and long-term issues rose as much as 
5/16 point, according to Telerate Inc., the financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans to banks, traded at 
9.563%, unchanged from late Friday.

AMENDMENTS HAMPER S&amp;L BAILOUT BILL 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
House members have flooded the Rules Committee with more than 100 proposed 
amendments to savings and loan bailout legislation, dimming the chances of 
floor action this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, which announced its S&amp;L proposal on Feb. 6 and 
challenged Congress to act within 45 days, has shown increasing impatience with 
the pace of action in the House. 
</P>
<P>
The Rules Committee, chaired by Rep. Joe Moakley of Massachusetts, the ranking 
Democrat after the death last week of former chairman Claude Pepper, is 
scheduled to consider the S&amp;L legislation today. It will decide which 
amendments will be considered by the full House when it takes up S&amp;L 
legislation written by the Banking, Judiciary and Ways and Means panels. 
</P>
<P>
House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, (D-Wash.), told Moakley last week that he 
wants the Rules panel to finish work today so the House can take up the bill on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
However, nearly 50 House members have asked to speak to the Rules Committee and 
the panel must wade through more than 109 amendments, a difficult task to 
complete in one day. 
</P>
<P>
If the Rules Committee finished work Wednesday, the full House could begin 
debate on Thursday, but the chamber is out of session on Friday, so any vote 
likely would be delayed until next week. 
</P>
<P>
"The Senate passed this thing on April 19 and the losses (in S&amp;Ls) have 
grown by over $500 million since that date," said Assistant Treasury Secretary 
David W. Mullins. 
</P>
<P>
The industry "is just hemorrhaging out there and every day they delay passage 
costs at least $10 million," he said. 
</P>
<P>
More than half a dozen of the amendments under consideration would weaken what 
the Administration considers the key change in the bill -- a requirement that 
S&amp;L owners invest at least $3 in tangible or "real money" capital for every 
$100 in lending. A high capital level acts as a buffer, absorbing losses before 
federal deposit insurance kicks in. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Frank Annunzio, (D-Ill.), chairman of the House Banking Subcommittee on 
Financial Institutions, had planned to offer an amendment that would allow 
regulators, at their discretion, to count "supervisory goodwill" as tangible 
capital, but pulled back after the Administration decided to oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisory goodwill is an accounting break offered by regulators in the early 
1980s to institutions that took ailing S&amp;Ls off the government's hands. 
</P>
<P>
Annunzio argued that it is unfair to penalize S&amp;Ls who took the accounting 
break at the government's urging. However, the Administration argues that it is 
unfair to taxpayers to allow the institutions with supervisory goodwill to 
operate with none of their owners' money at risk. 
</P>
<P>
Annunzio and other House members from Illinois, including Republican Leader 
Robert Michel, met with Treasury and White House officials last Thursday in 
attempt to secure the Administration's support for their compromise amendment. 
However, Mullins said the proposal "is simply not acceptable to us." 
</P>
<P>
As an alternate, Annunzio will back an amendment by Rep. Henry Hyde, (R-Ill.), 
that would permit institutions with goodwill to use administrative appeals to 
delay the imposition of tougher capital rules for up to 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Other proposed amendments would reopen virtually every major battle already 
fought in the committees that wrote the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Several amendments would delete provisions designed to help provide housing to 
poor people. Others would weaken the requirement that the S&amp;L industry 
contribute $300 million a year to pay interest on government bailout borrowing.

GARMENT WORKERS PLAN BID FOR APPAREL MANUFACTURER CLUETT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union has lined up a partner and a 
financial adviser in an effort to buy Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co., an apparel 
manufacturing concern acquired by Chicago-based Farley Inc. earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Union President Jack Sheinkman said in an interview Monday that the union 
planned to make a bid through an employee ownership plan in a partnership with 
Spencer Hays, a Nashville, Tenn., businessman who owns several U.S. 
garment-making operations. "He is an employer that we have about 17 contracts 
with in 11 states. We have a longtime relationship," Sheinkman said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheinkman also said Merrill Lynch has been retained to help put together 
financing for the transaction, which could be worth as much as $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sheinkman, on union business in Los Angeles Monday, said he met with William 
Farley, Farley Inc. chairman, to explain the plan and would follow up with 
further meetings with Farley and Cluett officials. 
</P>
<P>
The union, which represents about 7,000 workers at Cluett apparel manufacturing 
factories, is acting to save jobs, Sheinkman said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Hays nor Farley could be reached for comment late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The union's bid would be the largest employee buyout in the garment industry, 
which has been losing jobs because of foreign competition and a wave of 
leveraged buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
Farley, which controls Fruit of the Loom Inc., said in April that his company 
planned to make $1.3 billion in divestitures after completing its hostile 
takeover of West Point-Pepperell Inc., which previously owned Cluett. Cluett 
owns such brands as Arrow shirts, Gold Toe socks and some of the Burberry's and 
Halston lines.

HELPED BY INFLUX OF IMMIGRANTS, IRANIAN YELLOW PAGES GROW THICK

It's taking fingers longer every year to walk through the Iranian Yellow Pages. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago, Sohrab Rostamian and Bijan Khalili, who fled their homeland 
amid Iran's revolutionary chaos in the late 1970s, published a 96-page 
telephone directory of businesses owned by the growing number of Iranian 
refugees in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the Iranian Yellow Pages is 848 pages long, listing about 1,600 
businesses and professionals. The number of Iranian dentists, for example, that 
are listed in the book has climbed from six to 91. Rostamian and Khalili have 
set up a 411-like information service to give callers telephone numbers of 
Iranian businesses in their native Farsi language. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the growth of Ketab Corp., the Van Nuys parent company the two 
men own and run, is that Southern California, particularly the West San 
Fernando Valley, has become home to the largest concentration of Iranians in 
the United States. Most fled Iran in the wake of the 1979 revolution led by the 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died Saturday. As many as 300,000 Iranians are 
believed to be living in Southern California, including some 30,000 Iranian 
Jews such as Rostamian and Khalili. 
</P>
<P>
A large number of the Iranians in the United States came from the nation's 
elite group of professionals such as doctors, lawyers and engineers. Some have 
established large, well-known businesses. The Bijan boutiques in Beverly Hills 
and New York were founded by Iranian-born designer Bijan Pakzad. Adrays, a 
chain of discount electronics stores, was started by Iranian Masud Hakim and 
two partners. Iran-born developer Kambiz Hemkat is building the 22-story Center 
West tower in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Rostamian's and Khalili's advertisers in the 1989 Iranian Yellow Pages 
paid $650 a year for a full-page ad. Businesses also are listed in a computer 
database of numbers given to people who call the information line. Some 34,000 
copies of the yellow pages are distributed free and are used by nearly 200,000 
Iranians, the partners estimated. 
</P>
<P>
Most information in the Iranian Yellow Pages is written in Farsi, with a small 
amount of English scattered throughout. Pages are numbered from right to left 
because that is how Iranian books are numbered. 
</P>
<P>
A standard yellow pages logo, showing two fingers walking across the pages of a 
book, adorns the front of the book as well as Ketab's headquarters building on 
Van Nuys Boulevard. The main difference is that the fingers are walking on 
pages of green, white and red, the colors of the Iranian flag. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the advertisers are professionals or small-to-medium-sized businesses. 
Beverly Hills urologist James Elist, who moved to the United States from Iran 
in 1976, said that two to three patients a week locate him through the Iranian 
Yellow Pages. Some large firms, such as brokerage houses and insurance 
companies, advertise in the directory, typically featuring Iranian employees in 
their ads. 
</P>
<P>
Ketab Corp. is grossing about $1 million a year, compared to about $80,000 in 
1981. Ketab (which means "book" in Farsi) has a direct-mail service to 
Iranians. Two years ago, the information line was started (818-908-0808, 
because "08" was once the information number in Iran, equivalent to the U.S. 
use of 411.) 
</P>
<P>
Ketab also operates a bookstore in Westwood for Iranians. (The bookstore does 
not sell Salman Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses," the novel that inspired 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini to call for the death of Rushdie. Rostamian and Khalili say they don't 
want trouble.) 
</P>
<P>
Rostamian, 38, an agricultural engineer by training, and Khalili, 38, a civil 
engineer, are both natives of Tehran and became friends while studying during 
the late 1960s at Pahlavi University, now the University of Shiraz, about 500 
miles south of Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing that trouble was coming, Rostamian left Iran for Europe in 1978 just 
before the revolution, arriving in Los Angeles in 1979. Khalili left Iran in 
1980, traveling first to Switzerland and then to Los Angeles, where he arrived 
on Thanksgiving Day. 
</P>
<P>
Growth in the number of Iranians in Southern California is one obvious reason 
for growth in Rostamian's and Khalili's business. 
</P>
<P>
But Rostamian has another interesting theory. He said many Iranian exiles 
thought Khomeini's regime would only last a year or two and, sensing they would 
be returning home soon, did not establish roots. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people didn't even unpack the first year," Rostamian said. 
</P>
<P>
When it became clear that they were wrong, he said, people began settling down 
and starting businesses and establishing practices that have started to thrive 
the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller Iranian Yellow Pages are published in Northern California, New York, 
Houston and Atlanta. The Southern California version includes listings from 
those areas. 
</P>
<P>
Directories such as the Iranian Yellow Pages are part of a growing trend in 
yellow pages -- a generic name used widely -- that are being published for 
target ethnic groups. There are about 80 second-language, or non-English, 
yellow pages across the country. Yellow pages featuring Vietnamese-owned 
businesses have been published in Northern and Southern California. Direct 
Language Publishing in San Francisco, the largest second-language yellow pages 
company, publishes five Asian-language yellow pages in Northern California and 
15 Spanish yellow pages throughout California and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
One reason the publications are often successful is that immigrants often want 
to do business with other people from their home countries. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have big pockets of ethnic groups it makes sense. There have been 
quite a few attempts to demographically segment the market," said Larry Small, 
vice president of marketing for the Yellow Pages Publishers Assn. in Troy, 
Mich.

WHAT'S IN NAME? UNWARRANTED WOES, IF YOU ASK LINCOLN BANCORP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Being confused with his near-namesake, Charles H. Keating Jr., has only paid 
off once for John J. Keating. 
</P>
<P>
That was about five years ago when John Keating, president and chief executive 
officer of Lincoln Bancorp, the Encino-based holding company for Lincoln 
National Bank, was visiting Scottsdale, Ariz., home territory of the other 
Keating, chairman of the parent company of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; 
Loan. 
</P>
<P>
At a restaurant, John Keating was mistaken for a relative of the Arizona 
businessman. "My wife and I were treated incredibly well," Keating recalled. 
Then the restaurant staff discovered its mistake and service returned to 
normal. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, public confusion of the executives and their institutions 
has been a problem, especially since April 14, when federal regulators seized 
the S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Home Loan Bank Board alleged that the S&amp;L had been run in an 
unsafe manner and that its assets had been "substantially dissipated." 
Regulators said the S&amp;L "has repeatedly violated regulations relating to 
transactions with affiliates, used poor underwriting and has refused to follow 
supervisory directives." 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln National's John Keating said that since the seizure of the S&amp;L, his 
bank has received 10 to 15 calls from shareholders who thought that the Lincoln 
S&amp;L scandal involved the company in which they had invested. 
</P>
<P>
John Keating said the geographical distribution of investors in Lincoln Bancorp 
was probably saving the company from more troublesome confusion. "The fortunate 
thing is that most of our shareholders are out of state and obviously they're 
not reading the local press," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the S&amp;L, 7-year-old Lincoln National Bank has been enjoying 
good times recently. 
</P>
<P>
About a week before the S&amp;L was seized, Lincoln National Bank's holding 
company reported record earnings for the first quarter of 1989. The bank said 
it earned $1.4 million for the quarter that ended March 31, up from $616,500 
for the first quarter of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The bank also reported that its net worth, or total assets minus total 
liabilities, equaled a healthy 6.58% of its total assets. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the coincidence of similar names has even caused John Keating's 
family some difficulties. His daughter, who recently graduated from Chaminade 
College Preparatory, "went into school one day and some girl came up and said, 
'My grandfather is suing your father.' "It hasn't been fun, that's for sure," 
John Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Charles Keating's Phoenix-based American Continental Corp. acquired 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in early 1984, he involved the S&amp;L, which had 
previously focused on home loans, in risky real estate investments. 
</P>
<P>
After federal regulators had been examining the S&amp;L's operations for three 
years, American Continental filed for bankruptcy protection. Several regulators 
said they thought that the filing was intended to prevent federal officials 
from seizing some American Continental assets. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported last week that Charles Keating, his companies and about 75 
relatives, associates and employees contributed more than $700,000 to the 
campaigns of three dozen state and federal politicians over six years in what 
critics described as an effort to influence officials.

20TH CENTURY NAMES NEW PRESIDENT; 
</P>
<P>
MELVILLE WINDLE, GENERAL COUNSEL, TAKES THE HELM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1986, 20th Century Industries named Neil H. Ashley as the new president and 
chief operating officer of the Woodland Hills insurance concern. Ashley, then 
63, a lawyer by trade and 20th Century's general counsel, had joined the 
company three years earlier after a long stint at another insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
Now Ashley, 66, is about to retire. So 20th Century, the holding company for 
20th Century Insurance, last week announced his successor: Melville P. Windle, 
63, a lawyer by trade and 20th Century's general counsel who -- you guessed it 
-- joined the company three years ago after a long stint at another insurance 
company. 
</P>
<P>
That's just coincidence, said Louis W. Foster, 20th Century's 76-year-old 
founder, chairman and chief executive. Foster is still 20th Century's guiding 
force, although he leaves the day-to-day operations of the auto and home 
insurer to the company's president. 
</P>
<P>
But one thing is for sure: the selection of Ashley and now Windle as 
consecutive presidents at their relatively late ages shows 20th Century has yet 
to choose a long-term successor to Foster to lead the company into the 21st 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Companies such as 20th Century that are headed by one person for decades run 
the risk of not having a strong management team waiting in the wings when that 
person finally leaves. Indeed, in the mid 1980s, 20th Century was criticized by 
some analysts for lacking management depth. 
</P>
<P>
But Foster responded by hiring Windle and others and promoting some executives 
from within. And he said last week that Windle's appointment as president will 
enable 20th Century to continue grooming several younger executives to one day 
head the company. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree wholeheartedly that when you get to the point where you're just a drag 
on the institution, you should make room, and God knows I'll do that," said 
Foster, who also owns 9% of 20th Century's stock. But for now, he said, "I 
don't think I interfere. If anything, I give them a slap on the back of 
encouragement." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Windle plans "to continue things as they are until I have the 
opportunity to get my feet settled in." But he does not plan to be an idle, 
short-term caretaker. "I didn't come here to work and then leave at 65," he 
said. "I fully intend to stay maybe another five, six, seven years." 
</P>
<P>
And he'll have plenty to keep him busy. Tops on the list: Proposition 103, the 
insurance reform measure passed by California voters last November that could 
be a major drag on 20th Century's profitability. 
</P>
<P>
A key provision of the proposition calls for insurers to roll back premiums to 
20% below the levels of November, 1987. Last Friday, however, 20th Century 
joined other insurers in asking the state insurance commissioner to keep its 
current rates intact. 
</P>
<P>
But Proposition 103 carries other ramifications that could uniquely hamper 20th 
Century because of its unique operating style. 
</P>
<P>
The company has always insured only good drivers and offered low rates in 
return. It will not insure Porsches and certain other sports cars, because 
statistics show that such cars often are used for speeding and could end up in 
accidents. Those finicky requirements keep a lid on 20th Century's claims 
costs. Also holding down costs is 20th Century's refusal to use media 
advertising or agents; nearly all of its business is handled by phone or mail. 
</P>
<P>
20th Century, which also has offered homeowners insurance since 1982, operates 
mostly in Southern California and insures 800,000 vehicles and houses. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy has made 20th Century one of California's biggest and fastest 
growing insurers. In 1988, 30 years after Foster started the company in a 
one-room office, 20th Century earned $58.5 million on revenue of $622.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
But Proposition 103 is about to change 20th Century's habits. The measure also 
mandates that insurance companies accept customers who have one traffic ticket 
and an as-yet undetermined number of accidents, Windle said. At present, such a 
driver probably would not get 20th Century's coverage, although the company 
last year set up a new division, called 21st Century, that accepts some of 
these "standard risks" and charges a higher premium. 
</P>
<P>
Windle said it appears Proposition 103 means 20th Century will be forced to 
offer standard-risk drivers its normal coverage. But the question is: Will 20th 
Century also offer them its normal low price, when in fact 20th Century views 
such drivers as being riskier, thus potentially more expensive to cover and a 
threat to its earnings? Or could 20th Century somehow enroll them, but at 
higher prices? 
</P>
<P>
"I won't speculate on that," he said, adding dryly, "It's an interesting 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged, however, that 20th Century's customer list "is going to 
change, and I won't deny that we're a little unhappy about that. But 103 was 
passed by the voters and we'll live with it." 
</P>
<P>
Windle came to 20th Century because he was unhappy with the prospect of 
retiring at age 65. A native of Huntington, W.Va., he moved near Pittsburgh as 
a teen-ager when, as World War II broke out, his father sought work building 
ships. After a stint in the Air Force, the younger Windle earned a law degree 
at the College of William and Mary, briefly practiced family law in Norfolk, 
Va., and joined Nationwide Insurance Co. as a claims attorney in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
A decade later, Windle joined Transamerica Insurance and served in various 
management positions both on the East Coast and in Los Angeles. By the early 
1980s, Windle was Transamerica's general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
But changes in Transamerica's management, and a mandatory retirement age of 65, 
prompted Windle to look elsewhere. He'd known Ashley, and saw that someone 
could keep working at 20th Century past 65. (20th Century also has a mandatory 
retirement age of 65, but its board of directors can make exceptions, Foster 
said.) So when Ashley was elevated to president in 1986, Windle replaced him as 
general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Besides sorting out the impact of Proposition 103, Windle has other goals. 
Before he leaves, he wants to see 20th Century grow to $1 billion in revenue. 
To accomplish that, he also wants to lead 20th Century's expansion into 
Northern California within in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
But he said 20th Century's low-rate, preferred-driver, no-agent style is 
"something you don't want to tinker a helluva lot with." For now, that also 
goes for its personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an unusual group of people," Windle said of 20th Century's work force. 
"They're more like a family than a business, and Lou Foster is the head of the 
family." 
</P>
<P>
And when might Foster eventually step down? Foster said he does not know, but 
allowed that "for the first time in my business career, I'm thinking about it."

SENIORITY REMAINS STICKING POINT IN BUSCH DRIVER STRIKE

<P>
Anheuser-Busch's Sylmar distribution plant has responded to an 11-week-old 
drivers' strike by using management personnel to keep the beer flowing to 
retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators for the plant and for Local 896 of the International Brotherhood of 
Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America will meet today to 
discuss issues dividing them, according to a union official. 
</P>
<P>
About 45 management personnel have been making deliveries since the strike 
began March 16, according to a plant spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-seven Teamsters walked off the job after the last of several contract 
extensions ran out. According to Anheuser-Busch spokesman Russell Bell, 
management made its first offer before the original contract ran out Oct. 1 and 
has since made two offers. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Roberts, secretary-treasurer of Local 896, said the most important issue 
to the workers is seniority. He said drivers believe that a new demand-based 
delivery system sought by management in the new contract -- under which they 
would work only as they are needed -- would take away guarantees that senior 
employees have a full weekly work schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said the drivers also believe that the new system could result in 
layoffs and demands that the remaining drivers work overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Also at issue is the wage scale for drivers, according to Roberts. He said 
drivers are paid $11.70 an hour, plus a 10-cent commission for each case 
delivered above 1,500 cases per week. The union has demanded a wage increase of 
65 to 75 cents per hour each year for the next three years. Roberts said that 
in its most recent offer, rejected by the union May 27, management offered an 
increase of 45 cents per hour in the first year and 35 cents per hour in each 
of the next two years. The offer did not respond to the union's seniority 
concerns, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Through the plant spokesman, General Manager Paul Nickel declined to comment, 
but issued a statement that said the present offer "is as good or better than 
any contract currently in force in the Los Angeles area at Anheuser-Busch 
wholesalerships or those of our competitors." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Continue to Deliver 
</P>
<P>
Nickel also vowed to continue deliveries. "We hope this matter can be resolved 
shortly," Nickel said in the statement. "Until it is, we will continue to 
deliver to our retailers using Anheuser-Busch management personnel." 
</P>
<P>
According to Greg Allossery, Sylmar shop steward for Local 896, a similar 
strike is in effect at an Anheuser-Busch distribution plant in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Davis, an Anheuser-Busch spokesman in St. Louis, confirmed that 76 
Teamsters have been on strike at a plant in Metairie, near New Orleans, for a 
month. He would not comment on whether the same issues are involved in the 
Metairie strike.

David Atherton has an enviable reputation as a recruiter. When the former music 
director of the San Diego Symphony was in the market for a new concertmaster, 
he lured Andres Cardenes to San Diego from his concertmaster post at the Utah 
Symphony while Atherton was guest conducting in Salt Lake City. When he needed 
to staff his inaugural Mainly Mozart Festival with a concertmaster and violin 
soloist, he borrowed another concertmaster he had encountered while guest 
conducting stateside. 
</P>
<P>
"I met David when he was guest conducting with the Atlanta Symphony," explained 
Atlanta's concertmaster William Preucil. "We became friends -- at least as much 
as you can in a week's time." 
</P>
<P>
Since he enjoyed working with the energetic British conductor, Preucil accepted 
his San Diego invitation. At Atherton's suggestion, he recruited several 
Atlanta colleagues for the local festival, including Martin Chalifour, the 
Atlanta Symphony's associate concertmaster. Preucil's wife, violinist Gwen 
Starker Preucil, is also performing in the Mainly Mozart orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"She is the concertmaster of the Atlanta Ballet Orchestra," said Preucil, 
"although I should put that in the past tense, since their season is finished 
now, and we'll of course be moving to Rochester next month." 
</P>
<P>
Preucil only recently decided to end his seven-year association with the 
Atlanta Symphony to become the Cleveland Quartet's first violinist. In spite of 
its name, that 20-year-old chamber music ensemble is in residence at the 
Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to play in a string quartet. My father was in a string quartet 
-- actually he still is. One of the first things I did as a teen-ager was have 
a string quartet. The opportunity to play in a fine string quartet doesn't come 
along very often, so, although I love playing in the orchestra, opportunity 
knocked now. The string quartet literature is probably some of the greatest of 
all to perform. Most composers saved their most intimate expressions for the 
string quartet." 
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Preucil did not reject the label of chamber music addict. 
</P>
<P>
"While I was in the (Atlanta) orchestra, I played some 110 concerts a year, but 
I still managed to play at least 50 chamber music performances every year." 
</P>
<P>
Among his chamber music associations, Preucil played four seasons with the 
Minneapolis Artists Ensemble, a group that specialized in new music. 
</P>
<P>
"Each program had one piece by a living composer, and many of them were brand 
new commissions." 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota composer Stephen Paulus has written three pieces for Preucil, 
including his Violin Concerto, which Preucil premiered with the Atlanta 
Symphony. The recording of the concerto is scheduled for release next year on 
New World Records. 
</P>
<P>
When Preucil was on tour in the Soviet Union with members of the Seattle 
Chamber Music Festival last year, he played another Paulus composition written 
for him, the Partita for Violin and Piano. Paulus is now preparing a new 
chamber work for Preucil on commission from Atlanta's Emory University, where 
the violinist will premiere it in the spring of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
After he leaves San Diego, Preucil will play three more festivals on his summer 
docket. 
</P>
<P>
"At the Music Festival of Florida in Sarasota, I'll be giving some master 
classes to college students, as well as playing chamber music. After three 
weeks there, I go to Alaska's Sitka Music Festival and finally to the Seattle 
Chamber Music Festival." 
</P>
<P>
Magic Flutes. UC San Diego flutist Sebastian Winston is attempting to do for 
the little-known bass flute what James Galway has done for the lowly penny 
whistle. In a recital Saturday night at UCSD's Erickson Hall, Winston presented 
an entire program of works for solo bass flute, most of them commissioned by 
the performer. 
</P>
<P>
The world premiere of resident composer Joji Yuasa's "Terms of Temporal 
Detailing" was a virtual catalogue of bass flute sound effects, from buzzing 
multiphonics, or singing into the flute while playing, to abundant 
flutter-tonguing. Although the work's organization is supposed to be a musical 
counterpart to painter David Hockney's photographic collages, it would require 
repeated hearings to obtain an overall aural impression of Yuasa's tightly 
telescoped thematic fragments. 
</P>
<P>
More alluring to the ear, but no less probing, was Chaya Czernowin Shwartz's 
"Ina" for bass flute and prepared tape. The composer clustered shimmering 
spirals of recorded flute sounds around the angular solo line. Like other works 
from this promising young composer, "Ina" invited the listener into its complex 
sonic world, an atypical virtue of most new music. 
</P>
<P>
Musical Benefits. This week offers several possibilities to combine musical 
pleasure and philanthropy. On Wednesday, San Diego's Orpheus Ensemble will 
present an evening of baroque vocal and instrumental music to benefit the 
cancer-stricken Leucadia youngster Josh Kaplan. Soprano Kathryn Evans and tenor 
David Meek will each sing a Bach solo cantata in St. James Catholic Church, 
Solana Beach, to raise funds to help pay for the screening of potential 
bone-marrow donors for Kaplan. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, members of Del Mar's Romero family will hold forth at San Diego's 
First Unitarian Church to benefit the research programs of the National Vision 
Research Institute in Point Loma. Noted classical guitarist Pepe Romero will be 
joined by his mother, Angelita, and his daughter, Angelina, in a concert of 
traditional Spanish and South American music. 
</P>
<P>
Each concert begins at 7:30 p.m.

LACK OF PRENATAL CARE IN SAN DIEGO IS SPOTLIGHTED IN KPBS-TV SPECIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three hundred pregnant women arrive each month at hospital emergency rooms in 
San Diego County to give birth without ever having seen a doctor during their 
pregnancy, according to a KPBS-TV-produced documentary airing tonight ) at 8 
p.m. on Channel 15. 
</P>
<P>
"Victims at Birth" concentrates on three areas affecting San Diego's rising 
infant mortality rate: denial of prenatal care to expectant mothers, a rise in 
drug and alcohol use among pregnant women and a surge in the number of 
teen-agers who give birth. For those viewers unfamiliar with the problems, the 
pictures and statistics can be more than a little shocking. 
</P>
<P>
There are scenes in the emergency rooms of local hospitals, where doctors must 
confront the uncertainty of delivering babies for mothers that have not 
received proper prenatal care. Mothers lament the inadequacies of financial-aid 
programs. Doctors complain about the problems of getting paid by low-income 
mothers. 
</P>
<P>
"I never expected that I'd be denied medical treatment because of financial 
considerations," an incredulous mother explains. 
</P>
<P>
Show producer Matthew Eisen uses gripping footage of newborn babies to 
highlight and illustrate, not sensationalize. The statistics, the cold-hard 
facts, adequately make the necessary points. More than 3,000 teen-age girls in 
San Diego County become mothers each year, for example. 
</P>
<P>
After the hourlong special, KGTV (Channel 10) reporter Marti Emerald will be 
the host of a live follow-up discussion on the issues and possible solutions, 
beginning at 9 p.m. The panel will include Kim Warma, supervisor of the 
Regional Perinatal System, and Maria Leech, program manager for South Bay Drug 
Abuse Services, in addition to doctors, government officials, legal 
representatives and social workers. 
</P>
<P>
The show will include a live phone-in segment so that viewers can ask panelists 
questions.

<P>
BATES MOUNTS A DECENT SHOWCASE FOR THE MODEST CHARMS OF 'DIDO AND AENEAS' 
</P>

<P>
For less obvious reasons, early-music performance in San Diego County is about 
as popular as ice fishing. Though a modest circle of aficionados presents 
occasional chamber concerts, opportunities to hear large works by composers who 
flourished before the time of J. S. Bach are rare. 
</P>
<P>
Seen in this light, conductor David Bates' mounting of a concert version of 
Henry Purcell's opera "Dido and Aeneas" at La Jolla United Methodist Church on 
Sunday night was both a brave and a commendable venture. 
</P>
<P>
Tipping his hat to authenticity, he imported the Los Angeles Baroque Orchestra 
to accompany a cadre of local soloists. Bowing to more pragmatic requirements, 
he employed the church's 40-voice Sanctuary Choir to sing the opera's chorus 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
Because "Dido and Aeneas" was originally presented in a London girls' boarding 
school, rather than in a sumptuous court opera house, a church performance is 
not as unlikely as it may appear. 
</P>
<P>
All things considered, the performance proved to be a reasonable exposition of 
the 300-year-old opera's charms, modest as they are. Martha Jane Weaver sang a 
dignified Dido, her dusky mezzo-soprano seemingly tailor-made for a role of 
such stoic despairing. She projected her phrases in long, graceful arches, and 
her final aria communicated admirable pathos. 
</P>
<P>
As Belinda, Dido's lady-in-waiting, soprano Mary-Esther Nicola-Peck added an 
animated and tastefully ornamented foil to Weaver's gravity. 
</P>
<P>
Other notable vocal contributions included baritone John Polhamus' suitably 
stolid Aeneas and a spritely witches' duet filled with well-turned roulades 
sung by soprano Martha Hamilton and countertenor Michael Cox. Elizabeth 
Kimery's Sorceress, however, vacillated between melodramatic wobbles and less 
than Baroque shrieks. 
</P>
<P>
Stage director Thomas Richardson provided minimal movement for the principals. 
While this allowed the singers to move on and off stage according to the needs 
of the libretto, some of his gestures and poses appeared unintentionally 
comedic. As Weaver slowly extended her arm in the solemn aria that begins, "Thy 
hand, Belinda," Nicola-Peck scampered to her side like Mozart's infatuated 
Cherubino bounding over to kiss the countess' hand. 
</P>
<P>
Though the well-trained choir displayed a pleasant tone and clean diction, it 
lacked a sense of 17th-Century style, especially in terms of phrasing and 
metrical accent. On the podium, Bates could have done with less body language 
and more focused conducting, but he kept his forces together and moving ahead 
at a brisk pace. 
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of concertmaster Gregory Maldonado, the 11 
instrumentalists of the Los Angeles Baroque Orchestra opened the program with 
an instrumental suite from Purcell's "King Arthur." This period instrument 
ensemble lacked no sympathy for the composer's angular, short-phrased style, 
although the group's uneven releases marred the clean ensemble.

SCOTT OSTLER: CHAMPIONS ENTERING A NEW PHRASE AS RILEY IMPELS BY WORD OF MOUTH 
</P>

<P>
The only way the Lakers can blow the National Basketball Assn. Finals is to 
show up with their collective head in the wrong place, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the team's psychological preparation will be of utmost importance, and 
that's Coach Pat Riley's department. It will be up to him to motivate, 
reinforce, prod, goad, brainwash, nag and beg the Lakers to play to their 
enormous potential. 
</P>
<P>
One way Riley has done this before is by coming up with little slogans and 
catch-phrases, known as Rileyisms, to keep the players mentally alert. In order 
to better understand how Riley might do this in preparation for the Pistons, 
let's examine some of the Rileyisms he has introduced into popular usage. 
</P>
<P>
Three-peat. Riley actually owns this hyphenated word, legally. This is 
impressive to me, because I've been writing stuff semi-professionally for two 
decades. I have invented many words, some intentionally, and yet I don't 
legally own a single word. I just rent. 
</P>
<P>
I'm serious. Riley really does own the trademark to Three-peat. I'll probably 
have to pay him for using it in this column. It's not clear who actually coined 
the term, although some insiders say it was first uttered by Byron Scott at 
last season's victory parade. 
</P>
<P>
However, Riley filed for, and was granted, the actual legal government 
trademark on Three-peat (and 3-peat). Right now the slogan is featured on Pat 
Riley T-shirts, along with a cartoon representation of Riley himself. If you 
haven't seen this item yet, simply step outside your house some time in the 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
Just how motivational three-peat will be to the Lakers is not clear. Will Riley 
urge his troops to three-peat for the Gipper? Will he offer them free T-shirts 
for a sweep? Will they hurry to eliminate the Detroit Pistons so the Lakers can 
leave on vacations to distant lands where 3-peat T-shirts are not sold? 
</P>
<P>
Comfort zone. This is either something Riley tries to keep his players out of, 
or something he tries to force opponents into, or something you look for when 
you're driving a turnpike and the kids are getting restless. 
</P>
<P>
Make a stand. This refers to the moment of truth when you stop backing down 
from a tough opponent, stick out your jaw and stand your ground. However, this 
phrase always reminds me of high school wood shop, where I actually made a 
stand. It only wobbled a little, but I got a C-minus because of a sloppy 
varnish job. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers will need to make a stand in this series, but they should avoid 
doing so in a comfort zone. 
</P>
<P>
Peripheral opponent. That's Riley's phrase for anyone outside the team. 
However, the term is most often applied to the devious jackals of the media. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, we press people are the Lakers' peripheral allies, because everything 
we write or report, good or bad, is used by Riley as a motivational tool. 
</P>
<P>
Still, we don't mind the peripheral opponent tag because the phrase gives our 
job a sinister and romantic aura. Instead of Oscar Madison, now I feel more 
like Bogie. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of ink-stained wretches, thanks to Riley we now see ourselves as 
members of an elite SWAT squad, armed with camouflaged notebooks and lethally 
leaky pens. It's kind of exciting, although the press room food is still lousy. 
</P>
<P>
Hidden agenda. This is something the Laker players have that Riley has to 
ferret out and eliminate. Often the hidden agendas are planted by secret agents 
of the peripheral opponent. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know if Riley owns the trademark on hidden agenda, but I'd advise 
checking first with his attorneys if you plan to use it as a title for a spy 
novel or an office-organizer invention. 
</P>
<P>
Biological clock. Riley uses this to mean something different from everyone 
else. This is what makes the Lakers tick, it is the reason they can look so 
lethargic during the regular season and so dynamic in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Don't listen for the actual ticking. The Lakers' biological clock is a Rolex. 
</P>
<P>
Focused. This is, quite simply, a state of mind similar to what a carpenter 
needs to keep from hammering his hand into hamburger. In other words, close 
attention to the task. 
</P>
<P>
Riley's detractors, those who would sell him short as merely a caretaker of 
great talent, maintain that the Lakers come equipped with auto-focus. 
</P>
<P>
Bonding. Not to be confused with spackling or puttying, bonding is the kinship 
Riley pushes the Lakers to achieve through mutual understanding and respect. It 
is the kind of deep, manly fellowship normally achieved only by drinking beer 
while working on cars. 
</P>
<P>
Mindless cannibalism. This isn't Riley's phrase. I threw it in to see if you 
were paying attention. It is actually a phrase used by former House Speaker Jim 
Wright during his resignation speech, when he was making reference to the 
Detroit Pistons' unique interior defense. 
</P>
<P>
All of these Rileyisms have been successful, in varying degrees. It's a major 
part of what he does: "What I try to do is create an environment in which 
talent can flourish." 
</P>
<P>
Recently while watching TV, I saw the director of the latest Richard Pryor 
movie describe his job in that same phrase, word for word. 
</P>
<P>
May the best copyright attorney win. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it will be interesting to see what new Rileyisms Riley comes up with 
for this big series. 
</P>
<P>
He should know, however, that I have already claimed trademark dibs on the 
following slogans: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Lakers: 4-peat" 
</P>
<P>
 -- And because Detroit fans need T-shirts, too, "Pistons: 1-Peat"

A baseball card that could be worth $100,000 was grabbed from the hands of a 
14-year-old Northern California boy who was counting on the rare card to 
finance his college education. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Contra Costa County said that the 1910 Honus Wagner card, one in 
a series that had been distributed in packages of cigarettes, was grabbed from 
the youngster by another teen-age boy in West Pittsburg when the victim agreed 
to display the card for a photo. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, who was not identified, had acquired the card from his grandfather. 
The card was valuable because Wagner had objected to being associated with 
cigarettes and had bought and destroyed all but about 90 of the cards.

PEETE IS DRAFTED AGAIN BY ATHLETICS, WAVERS SLIGHTLY ON FOOTBALL CAREER

<TEXT>
<P>
Rodney Peete, former USC quarterback selected by the Detroit Lions in the sixth 
round of the National Football League draft, was re-drafted by baseball's 
Oakland Athletics Monday and said he will seriously consider a professional 
baseball career. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very excited," Peete said. "To be re-drafted by a great organization like 
Oakland's will make my decision that much tougher. I came very close to signing 
(with the A's) last time." 
</P>
<P>
The A's selected Peete in the 14th round of the June draft in 1988, after he 
hit .338 and was an all-Pacific 10 infielder as a junior. Peete elected to 
return for his senior football season at USC but did not play baseball this 
spring, choosing to hone his football skills in preparation for his first NFL 
training camp. Monday, he was re-selected by the A's in the 13th round. 
</P>
<P>
"People thought that when I didn't play baseball this year, I was ruling it out 
completely," he said. "But that wasn't the case. I wanted to make football work 
and still do. I'm still leaning toward football. 
</P>
<P>
"But we haven't gotten too far in the negotiations (with the Lions), and if 
they wait around much longer, it will make the decision that much tougher. I 
was disappointed to be drafted that low to start with, and that was when my 
interest in baseball began to peak again." 
</P>
<P>
The Lions will go to camp July 15. Peete said he hoped to decide in the next 
two or three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I want to play quarterback in the NFL or go with an organization that has a 
chance to play in the World Series every year?" he said. "I don't know right 
now." ROSS NEWHAN

Laker guard Byron Scott strained his left hamstring in practice Monday and is 
questionable for Game 1 of the National Basketball Assn. championship series 
tonight against the Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, the Lakers' third-leading playoff scorer, is expected to be examined 
today by team doctors Robert Kerlan and Stephen Lombardo. He left practice 
early and returned to the team's hotel, where he received periodic ice 
treatments throughout the day, according to Laker spokesman Josh Rosenfeld. 
</P>
<P>
Laker practices are closed, but Scott was seen limping out of the Palace with 
an ice bag strapped to his left leg. Neither Scott nor Laker trainer Gary Vitti 
could be reached Monday. Rosenfeld said that Scott suffered the injury while 
"landing wrong" after a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
If Scott is unable to play, the Lakers probably would start Michael Cooper in 
Scott's off-guard spot. SAM McMANIS

CHANG'S STROKE OF GENIUS HAD A BIT OF MAGIC

Paris is a veritable ocean. Throw in the plumb line and you will never know the 
depth of it . . . -- HONORE DE BALZAC 
</P>
<P>
Changmania? 
</P>
<P>
Whatever it was, it gripped the heart of the city on the Seine, where on a 
sunny, breezy, Monday afternoon, Michael Chang won a match that will live on 
for . . . what, ages? 
</P>
<P>
"You have to do more than knock off a player in a Grand Slam to be a genius," 
Ivan Lendl said. "You have to win one of them." 
</P>
<P>
Of course. What Chang did to Lendl was not merely the work of a genius, it was 
also the act of a magician. 
</P>
<P>
From the upper stands at center court, you can see the Eiffel Tower, and 
Chang's 4-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 win over Lendl, the world's No. 1 player, 
looked very big. It was not simply a routine fourth-round victory in the French 
Open. No, this one was different. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd at Roland Garros knew it, too, as they watched Chang defeat Lendl in 
five sets despite painful muscle cramps in his legs that made every move 
painful. 
</P>
<P>
From a seat in a baseline box, Betty Chang clapped her hands in encouragement 
as her son's will prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
Chang did not move from his chair for several minutes after the match, but he 
received a huge ovation as he walked off the court. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started to cramp, I knew that the longer the points went, the harder it 
would be for me to win," Chang said. "When I would go for it, I did. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard for Ivan to play because you have this mental thing in your head: 
'OK, he's cramping, try to move him around.' You go for winners, but you don't 
want to miss because if you miss, you give him a free point." 
</P>
<P>
Chang, 17 years 3 1/2 months, became the youngest male to reach the 
quarterfinals of the French championships. THOMAS BONK

BORK SEEKS JUSTICE IN 'THE TEMPTING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this town of reproach and recrimination, it seems increasingly clear that 
publishing well is the best revenge. In that spirit, one of the latest to join 
the parade of let-me-tell-you-my-side authors is Robert H. Bork, the former 
appeals court judge who was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Reagan 
but was rejected by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
His version of the events is contained in "The Tempting of America," to be 
published in November by the Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
But at a preview-of-coming-attractions press briefing at the annual convention 
of American Booksellers Assn. in Washington over the weekend, Bork -- the 
target of the first all-out, national political campaign to defeat a Supreme 
Court nominee -- insisted that his book was more about the general "tendency to 
run law into politics" than about his own particular unhappy experience. 
</P>
<P>
His unsuccessful bid for a seat on the nation's highest court forms only a part 
of his book, Bork said. The contentious debate over his nomination is simply an 
example of what he sees as this country's increasing, dangerous tendency "to 
achieve political responses through the courts." 
</P>
<P>
"The consequence," Bork writes, "is a steady erosion of the most basic American 
right, the right of the people to govern themselves when the Constitution does 
not say otherwise." By politicizing the courts, Bork elaborated, Americans have 
eaten away at "the people's right to legislate the laws we want to live by." 
</P>
<P>
No better example comes to mind, Bork said, than the ongoing furor over 
abortion. As a federal judge in Washington, he recalled, "my office overlooked 
Pennsylvania Avenue." Twice a year, "there was a march, once by 
pro-abortionists and once by anti-abortionists." 
</P>
<P>
But as the protesters proceeded up Capitol Hill, "they went straight past both 
houses of Congress with nary a pause, and straight to the Supreme Court," Bork 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"So far as they were concerned, for their purposes, the Supreme Court was their 
branch." Both sides, Bork said, "regard the court as in large part not a legal 
institution, but a political body." 
</P>
<P>
To Bork, "that means that a major heresy has entered into the American 
political system." The constitutional sacrilege, Bork contends, is "the 
introduction of the denial that judges are bound by law." 
</P>
<P>
Bork's constitutional expertise was one of the qualities that Reagan said 
figured strongly in his decision to nominate Bork for the Supreme Court and to 
support Bork's decision to tough out his bitter, ultimately unsuccessful 
five-month fight for the position in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But his rigidness and his archconservative views frightened many people, inside 
and outside the Senate. Many feared his effect on Supreme Court decisions 
because they said he already was too arrogant when contending that his 
interpretations of the law were the ones that best matched the original intent 
of the framers of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"The Founders of this nation thought the primary means of assuring our liberty 
was not the courts," Bork said this weekend, "but rather the assignment of 
different functions to different branches of government." 
</P>
<P>
Whereas the Constitution specified that laws were to be made by legislators who 
were elected by the people, not judges appointed by the President, Bork said, 
"a lot of Americans now simply assume that the courts should produce results 
they like rather than sticking to the Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Great Temptation' 
</P>
<P>
Though without its subtitle, "The Political Seduction of the Law," a book 
called "The Tempting of America" does sound rather like a collection of 
regional dessert recipes, Bork maintains that mass assumption explains "the 
great temptation," expecting "political results from the courts." 
</P>
<P>
In his own confirmation hearings, "many senators wanted political results from 
the courts," Bork said. "They had what they accused President Reagan of having, 
and that is, they had a litmus test." 
</P>
<P>
The angry sessions were marked by a level of communication that was "not very 
high," Bork said. "We talked right past each other." 
</P>
<P>
On the matter of Bork's leanings on possible Supreme Court action on the 
abortion issue, "I was told by two Republican senators that they would vote 
against me because I might vote to overturn Roe against Wade," Bork said. "I 
was told by two Democratic senators that they would vote against me because I 
might not vote to overturn Roe against Wade." 
</P>
<P>
But this "tempting," or political manipulation of the courts, long predated his 
attempt to secure a seat on the Supreme Court, Bork said. "It started at the 
very beginning of the Republic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Just a Liberal Sin 
</P>
<P>
"Nor is it a liberal sin," he went on. "Conservative courts have done the same 
thing. But it is illegitimate no matter who does it." 
</P>
<P>
In large part, Bork blasts law schools for undermining what he describes as 
"constitutional legitimacy." With a wave of a beefy arm, Bork asserted, "The 
majority opinion in the law schools today is that the Constitution is not law." 
</P>
<P>
As he writes in his book, "A new generation of law school professors and other 
elite groups no longer trust the people enough to let them decide what our laws 
should be." 
</P>
<P>
Among consequences of this trend toward politicization of the courts, Bork 
said, is that "we may expect (judicial) confirmation battles that are 
increasingly bitter. We may also expect a constitutional law that lurches 
suddenly in one direction or the other." 
</P>
<P>
Constitutional law, in short, Bork said, has come to be seen as "a political 
weapon." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Book on Legal Theory 
</P>
<P>
Now a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, Bork 
said he has devoted the last 1 1/2 years to research, lectures and to writing 
his book. Much of it was turned out aboard airplanes on his laptop computer. 
</P>
<P>
"At bottom," he said, his new book is "about legal theory." Nevertheless, it 
will tell his side of the story of his battle with the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course," Bork declared with the same bombastic assertiveness that became 
familiar in the lengthy confirmation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I wouldn't want anyone else to tell it, would I?" Bork challenged. His 
furry eyebrows were arched decisively. End of discussion.

<P>
California Highway Patrol officers on patrol early today witnessed a man 
wrestle another man to the ground and shoot him twice in the head during a 
fight in the parking lot of a Woodland Hills high school. 
</P>
<P>
One of the CHP officers wounded the gunman, but he escaped. Shortly after the 
2:50 a.m. shooting, the unidentified man was trailed from Taft High School to a 
nearby office building, where he shot himself to death in a restroom as Los 
Angeles police were preparing to move in. 
</P>
<P>
The man who was wounded in the parking lot was identified as Anthony Rotella, 
21, of Woodland Hills, a community services officer for the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department. Rotella, a civilian employee who worked at the Santa 
Clarita Valley station, was taken to Northridge Hospital Medical Center, where 
he was in critical condition after surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the dispute leading to the shooting were not known.

LAKERS' SCOTT TO MISS FIRST 2 FINALS GAMES

Starting Los Angeles Lakers guard Byron Scott will miss at least the first two 
games of the NBA finals because of a partially torn left hamstring, team doctor 
Robert Kerlan announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Scott suffered the injury, which Kerlan described as "moderately severe," while 
landing awkwardly during the club's workout Monday at the Palace, site of 
tonight's opening game of the best-of-seven series between the Lakers and 
Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, a starter for the Lakers who averaged 19.9 points as the team won a 
record 11 straight playoff games to reach the NBA finals, will continue to 
receive treatment and will be reevaluated before Sunday's third game of the 
finals at the Forum in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
According to a press release, Lakers Coach Pat Riley will make a decision about 
who will replace Scott in the starting lineup shortly before tonight's game. A 
strong possibility is veteran Michael Cooper.

The Assembly today approved a bill that would extend to all firearms the 15-day 
waiting period for purchasing handguns. 
</P>
<P>
The 43-21 vote on AB497 by Assemblyman Lloyd Connelly (D-Sacramento) came after 
the Assembly rejected GOP amendments to order the state to automate the check 
system within 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law now, anyone buying a handgun has to wait 15 days, while his or 
her background is checked, before obtaining the weapon. A person with a 
criminal record or who has been found by a court to be mentally incompetent 
cannot buy a handgun. The bill would extend that 15-day waiting period to 
rifles and shotguns. It would also expand the grounds for rejection on mental 
grounds to people who have voluntarily committed themselves or have been 
hospitalized for 72 hours for observation.

BERGESON TO REVIVE BILL FOR COUNTY VOTE ON TAX HIKE FOR JAIL, COURTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a telephone conference call to patch up differences with Santa Ana city 
officials, State Sen. Marion Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) agreed to revive 
legislation today that would allow Orange County voters to consider a half-cent 
sales tax increase to help finance a new county jail and courts. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson, who earlier withdrew her sales tax bill when Santa Ana officials had 
it amended to prevent the new jail from being located in their city, was 
scheduled to ask the Senate Judiciary Committee this afternoon to revive the 
measure and approve it without any reference as to where the new jail would go, 
said Kevin Sloat, Bergeson's administrative assistant. 
</P>
<P>
The move comes after Bergeson convened the telephone conference call with Santa 
Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young, Councilman Miguel A. Pulido and Orange County 
Sheriff Brad Gates on Monday, Sloat said. That led to a fragile agreement that 
called for the officials to stop their open feuding and for Bergeson to send 
the sales tax bill on its way through the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
In return, Sloat said, Santa Ana officials agreed to drop their amendment to 
the bill requiring the proposed 6,000-bed jail to be located at least a mile 
from the nearest school -- a condition that would preclude downtown Santa Ana 
as a potential site. It was this amendment that prompted Bergeson to withdraw 
her bill in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana officials, however, reserved the right to push for the amendment 
again if the Orange County Board of Supervisors doesn't pick another location.

The Boston-Washington urban corridor is home to one in six Americans, the 
Census Bureau reported today.

<P>
Data from a new census study also shows that the corridor contains almost one 
in four of the Americans who reside in metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
The data, for 1987, shows 43.5 million people living in the East Coast 
corridor, which includes 25 contiguous metropolitan statistical areas. With a 
national population of 243,396,000 people as of July 1, 1987, that means about 
17% of the nation's population live in the megalopolis. And the bureau reported 
that 187,072,000 Americans live in metropolitan areas, nearly 23% of them in 
the Boston-Washington region.

KHOMEINI'S BODY FALLS FROM COFFIN AS FRENZIED MOURNERS TEAR SHROUD

<P>
Millions of frenzied mourners carried away with grief tore the white shroud 
from the body of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, toppling his half-naked 
corpse to the ground, before the Iranian leader was buried today. 
</P>
<P>
Mourners blocked the path of a van carrying Khomeini's body in an open coffin 
to the cemetery from the square where it had lain in state for 24 hours in an 
air-conditioned glass cubicle. 
</P>
<P>
In a scramble for mementos, they grabbed the tightly wrapped white shroud in 
which Muslims are buried and tore it to shreds. 
</P>
<P>
State television later showed the mourners grabbing the body and pulling the 
shroud, until the feet could be seen. The broadcast then was cut off abruptly 
for several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"The people love the imam too much," a young man said. "They cannot bear to see 
him buried." He said they wanted pieces of the shroud "as sacred relics." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Son Knocked Down 
</P>
<P>
The coffin was transferred to a military helicopter, but the crowd rushed 
forward as it tried to land. As the helicopter flew away with the coffin 
protruding from its open door, the crowd was told that the burial had been 
postponed. 
</P>
<P>
Three hours later, however, a helicopter landed the rewrapped body in a metal 
casket. Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani and Khomeini's son, Ahmad, 
accompanied the body and oversaw the burial. 
</P>
<P>
Ahmad was knocked down in the melee around the coffin and lost his black 
turban. He looked pale and dazed as he was hoisted above the crowd and passed 
from hand to hand to an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
Women clad in head-to-toe black chadors rubbed shoulders with men despite the 
Islamic prohibition of physical contact between a woman and any man other than 
her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Firemen sprayed the crowd with jets of water from fire hoses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nightlong Vigil at Bier 
</P>
<P>
Most of Tehran's 6 million people appeared to be in the streets, and official 
media said millions more came from other regions to bid Khomeini farewell. 
About 2 million mourners had kept a nightlong vigil around the bier in Mousalam 
Mosque, 22 miles north of the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
At the Baheshte Zahra cemetery, thousands of Revolutionary Guards and civilians 
jostled around the grave raising clouds of dust as Khomeini's body was finally 
laid to rest. 
</P>
<P>
A television announcer, his voice hoarse with emotion, chanted "Father, don't 
leave your children! Oh father don't leave your beloved!" as the crowd surged 
toward the grave. People wept and beat their heads and chests with clenched 
fists in the Shiite Muslim expression of bereavement. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers passed concrete slabs over the sea of mourners and laid them across 
the grave, a shallow pit in a 100-square-yard section of the vast cemetery 
where men who died in the Islamic revolution and the 8-year war with Iraq are 
buried. 
</P>
<P>
A crane lowered a metal freight container onto the grave to prevent people from 
grabbing handfuls of dirt from it and possibly unearthing the body. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
8 Killed in Crush Monday 
</P>
<P>
Guns roared a last salute to the 86-year-old patriarch who toppled a 
2,500-year-old monarchy in 1979 and transformed Iran into a militant Islamic 
state. For the moment, at least, no special marker was put on the grave. 
</P>
<P>
Eight people were killed Monday in the packed square, some suffocating and 
others trampled to death. About 500 mourners were injured or collapsed in 
temperatures of 104. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini died of a heart attack Saturday, 11 days after intestinal surgery, 
without settling the question of who would succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
He left a 29-page "political testament," extracts of which his son read on 
Tehran radio Monday.

Pope John Paul II bitterly condemned abortion and divorce as ravages of sin as 
he began a visit today to Denmark, known for its liberal views on sex and the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time John Paul raised the subjects on his tour of Scandinavia, 
where attitudes on sex clash sharply with Roman Catholic teachings. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrating a Mass in the park of a monastery, the pontiff said sin in today's 
world takes the form of "widespread indifference to the things of God . . . a 
readiness to disregard human life or manipulate it. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The Pope was speaking in a country where one abortion is recorded for every 
three births and half the marriages end in divorce.

A pharmacist has uncovered what is believed to be the first sign advertising 
Coca-Cola, one which set the stage for one of the most successful advertising 
efforts in the country, historians said. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Cox, owner of Young Brothers Pharmacy in Cartersville, said the 
95-year-old Coca-Cola logo painted on the side of his century-old building was 
uncovered by restoration experts who chipped off 25 layers of paint. Old timers 
had told him the sign was there and a photo in an old hometown newspaper 
confirmed its existence. 
</P>
<P>
Historians hired by the Coca-Cola Co., which is based in Atlanta, said they 
believe the Cartersville sign was the first ever to advertise Coke, which was 
invented in Atlanta in 1886. 
</P>
<P>
Cox and historians have suggested the sign was created by James Couden, a 
traveling Coca-Cola salesman who offered to paint the wall free if he could 
also paint on the trademark, a practice that continues today in many countries. 
</P>
<P>
Wall signs were Coke's main form of advertising during its early years. In 
1905, the company allocated 10% of its advertising budget for painted signs and 
increased that to 25% in 1910. By 1922, there were 16,000 Coca-Cola signs. 
</P>
<P>
Coke historians believe the wall signs have made Coca-Cola one of the world's 
best-known trademarks.

A government spokesman said Chatichai told a Cabinet meeting that government 
agencies should prepare for investment from companies that currently have 
interests in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

Thai officials said many multinational companies were expected soon to shift 
their investments from China and Hong Kong to Thailand because of troubles in 
China and a related crisis of confidence in the British colony.

The federal Department of Labor has filed suit charging that the company that 
operates 23 Roy Rogers Restaurant franchises violated child labor laws, 
officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit charges that Stamford, Conn.-based Eastern Hospitality Inc. has 
violated provisions of the federal Fair Labor Standard Act since 1986 by 
employing 14- and 15-year-olds to work more than the hours permitted under 
federal law and has illegally hired workers, ages 14 through 17, to operate and 
clean power-driven meat-slicing machines. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Hanford Dole, the plaintiff on behalf of the Labor 
Department, is seeking a court injunction to halt the alleged violations and to 
secure back overtime pay for 134 workers, court papers said.

The Green Bay Packers have offered their top draft pick, Tony Mandarich, the 
same amount the Atlanta Falcons paid linebacker Aundray Bruce after Bruce was 
picked first in the NFL draft last year, a Packer executive says. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody in the National Football League is going to pay 
quarterback money to an offensive lineman," Tom Braatz, Green Bay's vice 
president of football operations, said Monday of Mandarich' request. "It's not 
just Green Bay. Even if he was with the L.A. Raiders, I don't think they 
would." 
</P>
<P>
Mandarich is seeking the same amount at which quarterback Troy Aikman signed 
with Dallas. The Green Bay Press-Gazette listed the former Michigan State 
lineman's request at $1.839 million a year and the Packers' offer as $820,000 a 
year. Packers President Bob Harlan said the disparity in numbers at this stage 
doesn't necessarily mean that agreement won't be reached later.

Stefan Edberg, slicing steadily from the back court and volleying with the 
confidence that swept him to last year's Wimbledon title, ended the French Open 
hopes of rising Argentine Alberto Mancini with a crushing 6-1, 6-3, 7-6 
quarterfinal victory today. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Steffi Graf, unaffected by a 45-minute rain delay, powered 
into the semifinals with a 6-0, 6-4 victory over Conchita Martinez of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded Edberg, who saved two set points in the third set, reached the 
semifinals at Roland Garros for the first time. He negated Mancini's fearsome 
power in a match that began 45 minutes late and was interrupted in the second 
set by a 55-minute rain delay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hottest Player on Tour 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, who has attracted little attention during the tournament despite 
dropping only one set, never let the Argentine -- the hottest player on the 
tour coming into the men's event -- get into the match. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a fast-court player but he didn't miss a ball," Mancini said. "His serve 
has a very high bounce and it's very difficult to return. He reaches the net so 
quickly. When you hit the return, he's already there." 
</P>
<P>
The opening set, played in overcast conditions and a light drizzle, lasted just 
24 minutes as the Wimbledon champion swept to a 5-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
He quickly pocketed the set two games later and led 4-3, with a break of serve, 
in the second set when the drizzle turned to heavy rain. 
</P>
<P>
When the action resumed, Mancini still was unable to turn Edberg's slices into 
winners. The depth and power that had annihilated previous opponents just 
wouldn't come. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sarcastic Shout 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, after holding for 5-3, broke the Argentine for the set on his sixth set 
point, set up for him by a double fault. 
</P>
<P>
Mancini's cause wasn't helped by a spectator who sarcastically shouted out 
"underhand," suggesting Mancini serve underhand in the way Michael Chang did on 
Monday on the way to upsetting Ivan Lendl. 
</P>
<P>
Mancini took a 5-3 lead in the third set, but Edberg, cool and composed under 
pressure, held him off to reach a tiebreaker and win the match. 
</P>
<P>
Graf's victory over Martinez means the defending champion and No. 1 seed now 
has dropped only 13 games in five matches in her bid for a third straight 
French women's crown and sixth consecutive Grand Slam tournament title. 
</P>
<P>
In the 26-minute opening set, Graf lost only 14 points as she pushed 
17-year-old Martinez, one of the world's rising young clay-court performers, 
around the Center Court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interrupted by Rain 
</P>
<P>
Graf led 3-2 in the second set with a break of serve when a heavy downpour, 
accompanied by thunder and lightning, sent the players racing for the safety of 
the locker rooms. 
</P>
<P>
When they emerged in the sunshine, the eighth-seeded Martinez broke straight 
back, then became the first player in the tournament to win four games against 
the West German. 
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard was rallying well at this time, winning her share of the big 
points with steady baseline play. But she couldn't keep it up, dropped her 
serve to go down 4-5 and was finished off by Graf in the next game. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the second defeat on clay this season for Martinez, who beat 
Gabriela Sabatini in Tampa, Fla., earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
In the other half of the women's draw, Aranxta Sanchez made sure of one Spanish 
semifinalist as she whipped Jana Novotna of Czechoslovakia 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
At Beckenham, England, torrential rain forced the second day's play in the 
men's singles of the grass-court tennis tournament today to be called off 
without a ball being struck. Spectators were hoping to see top-seeded John 
McEnroe play a second-round match against West Germany's Patrick Baur.
