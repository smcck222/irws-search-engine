Your editorial labeling gun-control opponents as "accomplices" of Purdy was 
both irresponsible and an insult to the overwhelming majority of gun owners who 
are law-abiding. Purdy was clearly deranged, but was hardly a "petty" criminal. 
He could have been in jail that tragic day in Stockton for he had seven prior 
felony arrests. Yet without exception they were plea-bargained down to 
misdemeanors by lenient judges and prosecutors. The blood of five innocent 
children rests on their hands.

It was interesting to note Sen. Davis' rationale for proposing legislation 
which would allow random car searches for weapons. The senator, who represents 
Valencia, stated, "Even some of our nicest suburbs are getting gang shootings 
and gang violence." 
</P>
<P>
My rhetorical question is why do we wait until the problem affects "the 
suburbs" before attempts are made to deal with it. Drive-by gang shootings and 
rampant drug dealing by gang members have been problems in our urban 
communities for years. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, it is only after someone gets shot in Westwood, or Stockton or Valencia 
that we see efforts from our Legislature to deal with problems that we have 
been complaining about for years. Isn't Compton entitled to the same protection 
and concern as Valencia?

In response to your editorial "California Leads the Way," May 20: 
</P>
<P>
How dare you accuse opponents of the "assault rifle" ban of being accomplices 
to Patrick Purdy? The National Rifle Assn., and law-abiding gun owners who are 
not members of the NRA have for years supported tougher laws, and tougher 
enforcement of laws to prevent people like Purdy from running around with any 
kind of gun. If this advice had been followed, that terrible day in Stockton 
probably would never have happened. No -- the ban's opponents are not 
gun-mongering accomplices of psychopathic killers, or of drug-dealing gangs. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone can be said to be his accomplices, it is the Legislature, the 
judicial system, and, yes, even the people of this state. Who had this 
obviously dangerous man in custody not once, not twice, but seven times, and 
let him go each time? The courts of California. Who wrote the laws that allowed 
the courts to do this? The Legislature. Who allowed the Legislature to get by 
with such weak laws against criminals? The people. 
</P>
<P>
The rise in the criminal use of guns has finally awakened the people to really 
do something about it. But what has our noble Legislature offered to address 
this problem? A useless, self-serving placebo. Those legislators who voted for 
this ban are only looking out for themselves. I do note that in the wake of 
this emotional and misguided law, other bills that are tougher on criminals 
seem to be riding on its coattails. These are the ones that will make a 
difference and should have been passed long ago, instead of the "assault rifle" 
laws. PAUL BRAUN

SOCIAL SECURITY COSTS TO WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
H.T. Steve Morrissey (letter, May 29) comments upon the costs of the recently 
enacted Medicare Catastrophic Health Care plan. After summarizing these costs, 
he asks why the elderly should pay for such items as schools, aid to children, 
and the catastrophic insurance when they will never use them. I would ask him 
to compare the elderly paying the Medicare Catastrophic surtax with the 
situation of a worker today. 
</P>
<P>
The seniors' maximum surtax is only $1,600, and this would be paid only by a 
couple with taxable (not gross) income exceeding $52,000. By contrast, my 
Social Security taxes for 1988 were more than $2,700 on taxable income of about 
$22,000 (adjusted gross income of $35,000). I don't think most elderly are 
aware of how much Social Security levies have increased. The maximum annual tax 
has increased from $144 in 1960 to $374 in 1970 to $1,587 in 1980, and is still 
rising. 
</P>
<P>
I am not wealthy. I am trying to support a family of five, while most elderly 
live by themselves or only with spouses; statistics show that the per-capita 
income of those over 65 now exceeds that of those under 65. My family is living 
in small apartment while more than 75% of the elderly own their own homes, 
according to a column in The Times a few months ago. I am not a ne'er-do-well: 
I am a full-time faculty member at Cal State Northridge, having worked hard for 
my Ph.D for six years. We own two cars, neither new and one of which just 
stranded me. With the median home price in California now over $200,000, my 
entire take-home pay would not be sufficient for a house payment. 
</P>
<P>
Entitlement programs, most of which benefit the elderly, are not fair. They 
cost more than $500 billion a year, almost half of the federal budget, compared 
with $300 billion for defense, less than $20 billion for Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children, and $7 billion (federal) for education. It is quite clear 
that it is today's workers and their children, and not today's retirees, who 
are being irreparably harmed paying taxes for services they will never use.

It is ironic that Capt. Will C. Rogers III has been awarded a top military 
honor (Part I, May 28) for his command of the guided-missile cruiser Vincennes, 
which became the focus of international controversy last July when it 
mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner in the Persian Gulf, killing all 290 
people aboard. 
</P>

What is the rationale for such a public display by the Navy? Could this event

IS BUSH ANOTHER 'KILLER TREES' PRESIDENT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURTIS MOORE, Curtis Moore is an environmental writer based in Washington 
and the former counsel to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At last week's NATO summit George Bush vanquished an old Ronald Reagan enemy -- 
the "evil empire." But within the next few days, he is scheduled to confront a 
more menacing Reagan adversary: killer trees. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, who not entirely in jest blamed air pollution on trees, established 
what is probably the worst environmental record of any President in history. 
Bush, by contrast, ran for President as a self-proclaimed "environmentalist." 
But he's done so poorly that a senior civil servant despaired to me last week 
that "It's not as bad as when Ronald Reagan was the President. It's worse." 
</P>
<P>
To survive the test of Brussels, Bush had to rescue himself from his staff of 
Reagan holdovers and strike out as his own man. He may be forced to do the same 
again to survive the coming environmental test. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's long-promised plan to clean up the nation's air is scheduled to be 
unveiled within the next few days. Based on documents circulating in 
Washington, if Bush adopted the most stringent option presented to him in every 
case, the bulk of industrialized America would still suffer from poisonous air 
in 2005 -- 30 years later than the law's original deadline of 1975. Worse, this 
staff-proposed program would add to global warming by indirectly forcing 
increases in "greenhouse" pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
Air pollution is so bad that some experts believe it kills more people than 
auto accidents. Los Angeles smog is literally equivalent to breathing a diluted 
solution of bleach, battery acid and Raid. In the East, lakes, rivers and 
streams have gone dead, virtually every tree species is sick, and estimates of 
building damages and crop losses range between $1 billion and $5 billion a 
year, all due to air pollution. Global warming and destruction of the 
stratospheric ozone layer threaten not just life as we know it, but perhaps 
life itself. 
</P>
<P>
Bush rejected the Reagan environmental rhetoric, but is yet to change the 
Reagan record. 
</P>
<P>
Consider, for example, the following: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Confronted by the largest oil spill in U.S. history, Bush vacillated for 
days, then finally adopted a let-Exxon-do-it cleanup policy. Predictably, the 
cleanup proved to be wholly insufficient, so Bush submitted oil-spill 
legislation to the Congress -- not to increase the liability of oil companies 
for spills, but to limit it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- During the campaign, suspicious voters were assured that Bush differed from 
Reagan and would tackle even global warming caused by air pollution. "Those who 
think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about 
the 'White House effect'; as President I intend to do something about it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Bush's chief of staff initially rejected a plan to fulfill the campaign 
pledge of convening a global conference on the greenhouse effect. He yielded 
only after GOP senators wrote Bush -- and then, only to a workshop. Days later, 
the congressional testimony of a top government scientist on global warming was 
censored to delete facts supporting his conclusion that the greenhouse effect 
had begun. 
</P>
<P>
 -- While campaigning, Bush promised a change in the quality of environmental 
decision-makers. Yet six months after Reagan left office, most of the critical 
posts remain filled by caretaker civil servants, depressing morale and 
paralyzing the bureaucracy. Most Bush appointees have been Reagan holdovers, 
many of them proteges of James Watt. Others are campaign contributors or 
friends of Bush or his aides. The exception is William Reilly, the 
environmentalist appointed administrator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency. Even Reilly's appointment, viewed as a strategy to silence the 
environmental community, fits a pattern of calculated environmental neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Much was made of the inadequacy of the federal environmental budget during 
the campaign and Bush savaged Michael Dukakis' record on Boston Harbor. Yet as 
President, Bush asked for zero additional money -- that's right, nothing -- to 
clean the harbor. The rest of EPA's budget fared the same: Bush increased it 
not one penny beyond Reagan's proposal. Yet to develop new ways to burn coal, 
the dirtiest of all fuels and the leading cause of acid rain and global 
warming, Bush boosted spending $650 million. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the President's pre-NATO performance could be blamed on his staff, not 
Bush himself, so might his environmental record to this point. But soon, Bush 
is scheduled to make some personal choices on which he can be fairly judged -- 
choices that could prove every bit as crucial to humanity's future as those he 
made in connection with disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
Bush saved himself from a potential NATO debacle by overruling his staff and 
exercising his personal judgment -- what he called "the vision thing." What the 
next few days will prove is whether Bush can do the same with respect to the 
environment. Will he be able to see the all-important forest despite the killer 
trees?

SAN FRANCISCO OPERA OFFERS 'SATYAGRAHA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, Times Music Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nine years after its world premiere in Rotterdam, and following U.S. stagings 
in New York, Chicago and Seattle, Philip Glass' controversial and haunting 
"Satyagraha" finally reached California this week, courtesy of San Francisco 
Opera. 
</P>
<P>
David Pountney's original production (re-staged here by Harry Silverstein) and 
Robert Israel's designs occupy the War Memorial Opera House handsomely. The 
performance, conducted once again by Bruce Ferden, puts across Glass' extended 
meditation on the life of Mohandas K. Gandhi in an aura of compelling visual 
and musical images. 
</P>
<P>
Though written for conventional, non-amplified musical forces -- soloists, a 
large chorus and an orchestra without brass or percussion -- Glass' second 
opera eschews the standard operatic devices of arias, duets and set pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the seven scenes is musically self-contained and usually constructed as 
a self-repeating passacaglia. With shifts of accent and new texts, each piece 
accumulates tension or force as it proceeds. The description is simple; in 
practice, the work unfolds as emotionally colorful and harmonically varied. 
</P>
<P>
Glass' critics say his palate is limited and his musical materials minimal. 
Perhaps so, yet the contrasts in this three-act, three-hour opera are many, and 
effective. In a score in which endless repetition can occur within small 
sections, the larger structures achieve integrity and uniqueness through 
separateness of thought and strict architectonic boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
For example: The opening scene, wherein the modality of restless F-minor is 
explored thoroughly, gives way to an extended section (the Farm Scene) probing 
gentle C-major. When the act moves on to its finale, the brightness of the 
B-flat scale bursts forth freshly. Armed with no more than a capsule summary of 
the action of each scene, the observer finds the actual dramatic content in the 
interaction between words and notes -- the vowel-rich, warm and open Sanskrit 
language combined with Glass' grateful vocal lines. 
</P>
<P>
No supertitles were used at this performance. Nor were any needed. 
</P>
<P>
This set of five performances -- (the run ends on Sunday) brings together 
veterans of the world premiere with enthusiastic local forces. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, Ferden conducted a pointed but spacious musical performance, 
savoring details but keeping the longer line in view. His energetic orchestra 
played keenly, yet never covered the singers. The 61-voice chorus sang and 
moved gamely, though vocally it was undernourished and poorly blended. 
</P>
<P>
The principals sounded tired. But they sang spiritedly. Douglas Perry, who 
created the role of Gandhi in 1980, still explores its beauties with 
sensitivity and grace. He was seconded neatly by the male soloists: LeRoy 
Villanueva, Dale Travis, Victor Ledbetter and Philip Skinner. The women -- 
Claudia Cumming, Ann Panagulias, Catherine Keen and Emily Manhart -- performed 
less resonantly, though reliably.

NEARLY FLAWLESS CACHE FOR MOCA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, Times Art Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When anything goes right in this world our tendency is to look for the catch. 
Last month the Museum of Contemporary Art was bequeathed a gift of 18 works 
from the Rita and Taft Schreiber collection, including prime examples by such 
masters as Jackson Pollock, Alberto Giacometti and Arshile Gorky. The news made 
the front page because the works are rare and rumored to be worth in excess of 
$60 million. It looked like a real windfall for art-hungry MOCA. 
</P>
<P>
The cache has just gone quietly on inaugural view until Oct. 18. The public -- 
surely incited to suspicion by such generosity -- now has an opportunity to 
stare this gift horse straight in the kisser. 
</P>
<P>
What they will see is a virtually flawless trove installed with such grateful 
reverence, it's enough to make you smile. The Pollock -- a classic 1949 drip 
painting called "Number 1" -- has a wall entirely to itself. As you look at it 
you can hear an awed and tremulous curatorial voice whisper, "And this . . . is 
our Pollock." 
</P>
<P>
No wonder. No contemporary museum can regard itself as complete without an 
obligatory memento from the artist who managed to redefine painting after 
Picasso had apparently done it all. But this is no third-tier relic; it's a 
helluva picture with its tangled skeins of color electrified by crazy 
arabesques of white and silver. At different instants it looks like brambles, 
liquids and galaxies, but mostly it just looks like this amazing man-made thing 
that is like nothing ever made before it. 
</P>
<P>
The first time I ever saw a Pollock I just burst into tears. 
</P>
<P>
Turn around and there is a Piet Mondrian, a little 1939 job called "Composition 
of Red, Blue, Yellow." Actually, it's mainly a black-and-white grid with the 
colors squeezed off to the corners. It's so simple, but the interrelationships 
of rectangles set up fugal vibrations. You begin to understand that modernism 
was about the adventure of stripping art down to its barest essentials to 
discover the wonderful resonances of basic axioms. 
</P>
<P>
To get to the gallery housing the Schreiber donation, you have to walk through 
two others. One houses a roomful of pile-driver Franz Klines that are sort of 
like great jazz drum solos. The other has some big Mark Rothkos that throb with 
colors as dense as passages from Beethoven. Part of an earlier purchase from 
the Panza collection, they are intensely impressive. The mind says, "Hey, this 
is a serious museum." 
</P>
<P>
You walk into the Schreiber room and the mind does a double take. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, this is a really serious museum." 
</P>
<P>
The donation has vintage examples of classic modernism that are just what was 
needed to give the permanent collection a certain, well, gravitas. The ensemble 
has a golden spike quality that seems to anchor the institution. And it's 
instructively installed. 
</P>
<P>
In one corner there is an Alexander Calder sculpture and paintings by Joan Miro 
and Arshile Gorky that are like some great triple home run. Miro bashes the 
surrealist ball molding it into a funny kidney shape that makes it possible to 
be abstract and figurative at the same time. Calder -- on third -- slides into 
home plate shaping it into a biomorphic sculpture that is at once elegant, 
ominous and funny. Arshile Gorky races in from second (in New York), trips over 
Calder, making the base moist and sexy, thereby setting up the sensual, highly 
physical qualities of Abstract Expressionism. 
</P>
<P>
Hold on fans! It's turning into a quadruple play! Mark Rothko turns the ball 
into a football and from a solid to a liquid, then sneaks it to Morris Louis 
who turns it into a liquid solid. Amazing. First time in history anybody ever 
batted in three home runs and made two touchdowns in the same game. 
</P>
<P>
The gift horse grins broadly. We search somewhat 
</P>
<P>
frantically for a yellow stain or two. Well isn't it a bit of an outrage that 
the little Mark Tobey isn't hanging closer to the Pollock for comparison? And 
isn't it a tragedy that the George Rickey mobile isn't moving and that it isn't 
close to the Calder, being that Rickey is Calder's finest and most underrated 
inheritor? 
</P>
<P>
Well, OK, so it's not exactly a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Not every work in the gift is a blockbuster or every artist a great master. On 
evidence, that just shows that the Schreibers collected for personal reasons 
and knew how to pick prime works by lesser known people. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't usually seem to matter that Pierre Alechinsky is far less revered 
here than in Europe, but the Schreibers found a wild little painting that shows 
him at his best. We tend to forget about Nicholas de Stael because he died 
early and leaned to decoration, but there is real poignancy in the three works 
here. The Dubuffet is unpretentious but captures the kernel of his Art Brut. 
</P>
<P>
None of that needs making up for, but if it did the Giacomettis would do it. 
Frankly, the artist is sometimes a bit too steeped in the celebration of 
European ennui and Angst but the two "Tall Figures" here find him at his best 
moment after the surrealist period. Nearly eight feet tall, each depicts a 
nubile young woman. Instead of the expected Lolita qualities we get spectral 
presences that impart serious thoughts about human vulnerability and its 
persistent tendency to triumph over its own weakness. 
</P>
<P>
For once everything went right. The Schreiber gift is unalloyed philanthropy in 
an era of shameless greed, artistic authenticity in an age of brass. Wow.

'HUSTON' DOES THE MAN PROUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, Times Film Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It can't have been easy to tie up all the elements, elegant to ornery, that 
made up John Huston, but the film which now labors under the title "John 
Huston, The Man, The Movies, the Maverick" seems to have managed it. Full to 
the brim with his cronies, his loves, his wives and his fellow artists, it is a 
great, walloping, gusty, gutsy, funny, unsparing and ultimately inspiring film, 
and two hours in its company is like a tiny, precious sliver of Huston himself. 
</P>
<P>
Producer Joni Levin and director Frank Martin, who co-wrote, with Charles 
Degelman, the film's non-interview segments, were canny in their choice of 
subjects. There are the men who, like Huston, are themselves great natural 
storytellers: Michael Caine, diabolically deft; Robert Mitchum, the film's 
perfect host, who holds the patent on one of the better Huston impressions. And 
there is the unexpectedly trenchant Ossie Morris, Huston's cinematographer on 
"Moby Dick," "Moulin Rouge," "Beat the Devil" and more, who clearly missed 
nothing, off-screen or on. 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, the stars: Lauren Bacall with firsthand observations 
about the shooting of "The African Queen," and a candid appraisal of Huston 
vis-a-vis women; Paul Newman, who considers "The Life and Times of Judge Roy 
Bean" his best work, and who pegs its director as "an eccentric's eccentric." 
There are two of Huston's children, Anjelica and Danny, speaking warmly and 
candidly, any feelings from their childhood of distance or estrangement clearly 
assuaged by their closeness with their father in his last five years. 
</P>
<P>
There are those who knew him up-close and loved him anyway: ex-wife Evelyn 
Keyes, telling an almost marriage-busting race-track anecdote; Danny Huston's 
beautiful mother, Zoe Sallis, insightful about Huston's Irish years; Arthur 
Miller, speaking not only about "The Misfits" but of the reason Marilyn Monroe 
had such a warm spot in her heart for the director. 
</P>
<P>
And there is linchpin Tommy Shaw, Huston's customary assistant director, 
shooting down the canard that Clark Gable's work in the wild mustang sequence 
of "The Misfits" contributed to his subsequent heart attack. It was one of 
Hedda Hopper's more widely circulated beliefs, but when Shaw says emphatically, 
"She came closer to the wild horses than Gable did," the clip that accompanies 
him makes that fact abundantly clear. 
</P>
<P>
The documentary is constructed like a ramble through a fictional attic, with 
props and pictures and home-movie snippets guaranteed to kick up memories: 
Walter Huston's voice singing "September Song"; the "African Queen" herself; 
lifetime horseman Huston on his beloved Irish estate, St. Clarens, and enough 
of John Huston's oils to validate his son Danny's claim that his father might 
have been a more-than-decent painter. 
</P>
<P>
The portrait here is of a man of almost too many talents, whose accomplishments 
as the "master at the avoidance of boredom," as Mitchum calls him, may have 
trivialized his more serious gifts. As Michael Caine notes, "His weaknesses 
were women, gambling and horses and he spent most of his life financing these 
weaknesses." 
</P>
<P>
There's the clear feeling that he must have been hell on women, and Lauren 
Bacall reinforces it. "I don't think John liked women very much. . . . I don't 
think he respected them. I think he respected the mothers of his children as 
the mothers of his children . . . but I would hate to have been in love with 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Miller suggests that always nagging Huston slightly was the idea that 
"he was missing the great artistic achievement that comes from long thought and 
quiet preparation . . . that the helter-skelter was robbing him of that 
concentration." It's certainly a rationale for Huston's eccentric batting 
average: one clear masterpiece for each decade he worked and a lot of detritus 
cluttering up the infield. 
</P>
<P>
One warning: The film has an opening that makes your heart sink, a great 
anecdote about the 12-year-old Huston, simultaneously unreeling in print and 
read aloud. Take heart, you will not be read to forever; this is only an 
awkward beginning to a nicely visual film. And once it gets up steam, it truly 
soars. 
</P>
<P>
The film plays tonight as a benefit for the Los Angeles County Museum's Film 
Department. Tickets for the buffet and film are $100; a limited number of 
tickets for the screening alone are available at $25. Information: (213) 
857-6542. 
</P>
<P>
Huston's life was a cat's cradle of contradictions, picked out, or so it 
seemed, by irony. So perhaps Huston would have found something ironically 
amusing in the fact that the film's distributor, Ted Turner, is the man whom 
the director fought over the colorization of "The Maltese Falcon" with his 
literal last breaths. 
</P>
<P>
The documentary will debut on Turner's TNT Network on Monday, June 12 at 5 
p.m., with repeats that night at 8 and Sunday, June 18 at 11 a.m. The next 
Huston masterwork to have to fight off colorization is "Treasure of the Sierra 
Madre." Can anybody find that funny?

Actor-comedian Robin Williams, in a two-part interview to be broadcast Thursday 
and Friday on ABC's "Good Morning America," says comedy is a great shield. 
"It's a great way to keep people out. Comedy is a defense and also a weapon. 
You can use it to decimate people and to hold people back, to defuse them . . . 
if they laugh, they won't hurt you." ALEENE MacMINN

The American movie "Mississippi Burning" is a box-office smash in Johannesburg, 
South Africa, attracting both blacks and whites who previously were denied 
access to such films about racial conflict. The film, which focuses on the 
killing of three civil rights workers during the racial turbulence of the 
1960s, has played to full houses since it opened in late April. The movie 
"mirrors our times in South Africa," said the New Nation, a black-oriented 
weekly. ALEENE MacMINN

CBS Records is changing the title of country music star George Jones' latest 
song, "Ya Ba Da Ba Do (So Are You)," to avoid infringing on trademark rights 
held by cartoon caveman Fred Flintstone's owner, Hanna-Barbera Productions. 
Starting today, the title of the single, No. 26 and climbing on the country 
charts, will be "The King Is Gone (So Are You)," CBS Records said. Stickers 
with the new title are on the way to record stores to be pasted on all 
cassettes, compact discs, albums and singles and CBS is asking radio stations 
to refer to the song by its new title. In a statement, CBS Records said, "CBS 
and Hanna-Barbera have agreed that the general public be notified that the 
song, 'Ya Ba Da Ba Do (So Are You)' is not endorsed by Hanna-Barbera 
Productions Inc. or is in any way connected with 'The Flintstones."' The song, 
written by Nashville's Roger Ferris, is a humorous look at a man drowning his 
sorrows with a "Jim Beam decanter that looks like Elvis" being poured into a 
Flintstones' jelly jar. "Yabba-dabba-doo, the King is gone and so are you," the 
refrain goes. ALEENE MacMINN

'IMAGINING AMERICA': FOUR RIFFS ON A COMMON THEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until this year's "New York Stories," one might have thought the anthology film 
was dead. Yet just as that movie revived the genre cinematically, "Imagining 
America," which airs tonight at 9 on Channel 15 and at 10:35 on Channel 28, 
reinvigorates the format for TV. 
</P>
<P>
A presentation of "American Playhouse," it's such a superb, offbeat collection, 
one hopes more will follow. Conceived and produced by John H. Williams, it 
offers four riffs on a common theme: America, viewed personally. Only one of 
the four, Ralph Bakshi's "This Ain't Bebop," is a narrative. The others include 
two fine documentaries: Ed Lachman's "Get Your Kicks on Route 66," a racy ode 
to the great American '50s highway, and Mustapha Khan's "Reflections of a 
Native Son," a grim, clear-eyed look at the teen-age subculture of a South 
Bronx housing project. The fourth, Matt Mahurin's "Tribe," is a lyric 
kaleidoscope of public gestures in America: a cross between impressionist 
documentary, music video and live-action photo-essay. 
</P>
<P>
"This Ain't Bebop" is, in a way, another nostalgia piece about the '50s. But 
this is nostalgia for the buried '50s: of the beat or counter-culture figures 
such as Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady, James Dean and splatter-painter Jackson 
Pollock. 
</P>
<P>
Brooklynite Bakshi follows an aging would-be hipster (Harvey Keitel) on his 
barren rounds through the pool halls and streets, looking for action and sex, 
juxtaposed with his memories of a '50s youth, and the self-destructive idols 
whose gestalt haunts him. Sinuous Miles Davis-style jazz threads under the 
action; "This Ain't Bebop" itself is an apocryphal remark attributed to Cassady 
as he collapses on the railroad tracks before his death. 
</P>
<P>
Though Keitel's presence reminds us of Martin Scorsese's mean street ethos, 
Bakshi shows style and personality all his own. His first totally live-action 
effort suggests others should follow. 
</P>
<P>
"This Ain't Bebop" is the longest of the shorts, but it doesn't dominate. The 
films all weave together, a quartet of variations on the theme of the American 
outsider: whether white, black, urban, western or on the road between. 
Subthemes trace their way from film to film, like the jazz and rock underscore. 
</P>
<P>
"Tribe" is probably the anthology's heart: with its multi-images of Americans 
of all classes, races and sexes in a huge dance -- staged variously to the slow 
movement from Beethoven's Seventh Symphony, drums and "Hang On, Sloopy." And 
the shorts have been embedded in a rich collage of clips from bland, 
celebratory documentaries from the '50s and earlier: a technique that recalls 
experimental gems like Michael Wallin's "Decodings." 
</P>
<P>
One other note on this excellent package. Khan's and Mahurin's films are in 
black-and-white; so are sections of Bakshi's and Lachman's. And they all look 
beautiful. In this sad time of the denigration of monochrome cinematography -- 
through the colorizing antics of Ted Turner and his shortsighted industry 
supporters -- watching four fine film makers make such creative modern use of 
black-and-white is heartening indeed. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

'LIVING WITH DISASTER': AN EDGY COEXISTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY ATKINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If bad relationships, horror films and car repairs haven't jangled your nerves 
enough, tune into "Living With Disaster" (at 8 tonight on Channels 28, 15 and 
24, 9 p.m. on Channel 50, and June 14 at 9 p.m. on Channel 11). 
</P>
<P>
This chapter of "The Infinite Voyage" science series focuses on hurricanes, 
earthquakes, volcanoes and mud slides. The purpose behind choosing certain 
disasters over others, though never clearly stated, seems to have something to 
do with centering on those catastrophes that show some chance of being 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Those chances don't seem too great, though. The attempts shown here to monitor 
earthquakes and volcanoes appear to be a long way from leading to reliable 
predictions. 
</P>
<P>
"Living With Disaster," whose calm narration, easy pace and light music 
actually lull the viewer at times, is bookended with two segments that might 
have been titled "Flirting With Disaster." 
</P>
<P>
The first describes Ocean City, Md. -- a sand bar glorified into a resort town 
-- that refuses to back down from the hurricanes that periodically devastate it 
(one cut it in half). The community is currently pouring sand in front of 
itself -- at a cost of $60 million -- in hopes that the next big blow will be 
stymied somehow. 
</P>
<P>
Even more amazing are the 9,000 citizens of the Japanese island of Sakurajima, 
who live under a volcano that spews ash and causes mud lides about 200 times a 
year, and could blow its top in even grander style with little or no warning. 
The new tract homes are built to be "ash-proof" and kids have to wear hard hats 
on the way to school. Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Californians are considered nutty risk-takers by a lot of folks back 
East, and if the less interesting but closer-to-home quake segment brings on 
that nervous feeling and a desire for action, stay tuned to Channel 28; right 
after "Living With Disaster" and a pledge break, the station will repeat 
"Surviving the Big One: How to Prepare for a Major Earthquake."TERRY ATKINSON

NEWSMAKERS: IT'S THE REAL THING: COKE'S FIRST WALL SIGN POPS UP

James Couden may have been a better salesman than a painter, but it is his 
artwork that is attracting attention. Preservationists Alison Free and Aggie 
Ferguson have put in a month of work on the side of Young Bros. Pharmacy in 
Cartersville, Ga., about 30 miles northwest of Atlanta, to bring to light what 
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola executives agree is the first of its kind -- a 
Coca-Cola wall sign painted 95 years ago. Restoring the large red-and-white 
sign, which says "Drink Coca-Cola," was the idea of the pharmacy's owner, Dean 
Cox, who said townspeople had told him he had a historic treasure under layers 
of paint on the wall. "I'd heard the rumor for years," Cox said, "and then I 
finally got confirmation from Coca-Cola that this was the first painted wall 
sign." Coca-Cola representative Randy Donaldson said the original sign was 
painted in 1894 by Couden, who set the precedent for what later became a 
standard offer: Sell Coca-Cola in your shop and the company would paint your 
wall for free. "Couden was a salesman first and painter next," Donaldson said, 
"so his sign is not quite up to specs. The letters are kind of squashed." Free 
and Ferguson, who operate a restoration company called Signs of the Times, used 
heat guns and spatulas to chip away layers of old paint.

 -- Leonard Bernstein is attending his 50th college reunion in style. 
Bernstein, 70, was to conduct the Boston Pops in a Symphony Hall concert for 
his fellow members of Harvard University's Class of 1939. In honor of the 
occasion, the 100-member orchestra was to perform "Fair Harvard" and 
"Radcliffe, We Rise to Greet You." Other program highlights include selections 
from Bernstein's own "West Side Story." Pops conductor John Williams was to 
lead the orchestra in two pieces composed in honor of Bernstein's 70th birthday 
last summer. They are Williams' "To Lenny! To Lenny!" and Toru Takemitsu's "For 
Lenny's Birthday."

 -- Roy Rogers has a new role -- county commissioner. Rogers, 76, was born 
Leonard Slye in Cincinnati but grew up on a houseboat in Portsmouth, Ohio, and 
later in Duck Run. He and his wife, Dale Evans Rogers, were guests at a banquet 
in Portsmouth at which a resolution proclaiming Rogers an honorary Scioto 
County commissioner was presented to him and a celebrity auction was held for 
the Roy Rogers Scholarship Fund. "I've seen everything from the horse-and-buggy 
days to a man on the moon. I feel like I've grown up with everybody," Rogers 
told the diners. SHIRLEY MARLOW

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: DON'T CALL ME MADAM, SAY 2 WITH NEWSY NAMES 
</P>

Karen L. Wilkening is not Karen L. Wilkening is not Karen L. Wilkening. 
</P>
<P>
There are three women in San Diego County named Karen L. Wilkening. One is the 
stuff of salacious headlines, two are not, and the two who are not are tired of 
being mistaken for The Other One. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Louise Wilkening, 43, late of San Diego and the Philippines and now of 
the County Jail at Las Colinas, is the alleged madam of a prosperous call-girl 
ring that provided pleasure to car dealers and dispirited businessmen. She 
faces 18 charges of pimping and pandering. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Louise Wilkening, 36, has a massage and dance therapy studio in Del Mar. 
Karen Lynn Wilkening, 34, lives in Oceanside and is a "body-balancing" 
instructor. 
</P>
<P>
During Wilkening's months as a fugitive, creditors dunned the other two for her 
unpaid bills, often quite vigorously, sometimes late at night. 
</P>
<P>
Karen of Oceanside came close to getting arrested until she produced a birth 
certificate. "Two cops came to my door with an arrest warrant and nearly 
dragged me off," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Wilkening's well-publicized arrest and court hearing, both Karen of 
Oceanside and Karen of Del Mar have endured giggling, snickering, side glances 
and the whispered question, "Are you the one on television?" 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I'll write a check and the cashier will be gone for 15 minutes," 
said Karen of Oceanside. "I'll look and several people will be peering out at 
me from an office." 
</P>
<P>
It does not help that both Karen of Oceanside and Karen of Del Mar are in 
professions that involve the laying on of hands. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of it as a cosmic joke," said Karen of Del Mar. "If anything, maybe 
people will realize through this case that sexual massage, like she may have 
done, and spiritual massage, like I do, are completely different." 
</P>
<P>
Karen of Oceanside has decided to delay doing any advertising until the 
notoriety of the Wilkening case dissipates. She's already gotten an obscene 
phone call from a man requesting certain illicit acts. 
</P>
<P>
To which she replied, "Sorry, you've got the wrong person." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mesmerized by the Law 
</P>
<P>
Update: Michael R. Samko, the North County psychologist who uses hypnosis to 
help would-be lawyers pass the California Bar Exam, reports that all 12 of his 
patients passed the February exam, according to results released last week. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Samko's patients, as always, were "bar phobics" who had failed several 
times. 
</P>
<P>
One woman had failed so many times that even under hypnosis she couldn't, or 
wouldn't, remember the exact number. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Oil-Spill Cleanup 
</P>
<P>
It's time again for the Miss California Pageant in San Diego, so Ann Simonton, 
the former model who says beauty contests are degrading meat markets, is in 
town to continue her protest. 
</P>
<P>
She's best known for shaving her head and wearing a dress festooned with sliced 
bologna. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Simonton will go to UC San Diego to lecture fraternity men who are 
being punished for bringing a stripper on campus to cavort and wallow in oil. 
Her topic: "Sex, Power &amp; the Media: What's Wrong With a Strip-Tease?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Light on China 
</P>
<P>
Chinese students at UCSD, anguished by the bloodshed in their homeland, have 
found a way to raise money for students and others hurt in the turmoil: 
T-shirts, on sale for $15 each. 
</P>
<P>
On the back is an editorial cartoon by The Times' Paul Conrad, showing a 
darkened map of China, a mass of white dots near the populated areas and the 
caption, "A billion points of light." 
</P>
<P>
On the front is a globe and the slogan, "China. The World Is Watching." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an old radical from the 1960s, so I know the power of T-shirts to help 
keep a political movement alive," said Doyle McCloud, whose Encinitas firm, 
Herbal T's, is producing the shirts. 
</P>
<P>
The students plan to sell the yellow T-shirts on campuses along the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
A second T-shirt is also is in the works, showing the Goddess of Liberty, the

D.A. EXONERATES ESCONDIDO OFFICER IN SHOOTING DEATH OF YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the "quantum of force" used, the shooting death of a teen-ager by an 
Escondido police officer Jan. 2 was legally justified, the district attorney's 
office concluded in a report issued Tuesday by the Escondido Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The report, signed by Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller, said Officer Martin Hewlett 
justifiably felt fear for his life at the hands of 17-year-old Robert Scriven, 
who had struggled for the officer's gun and had taken control of the fight 
until the officer fired his semi-automatic weapon 15 times, striking Scriven 14 
times and mortally wounding him. 
</P>
<P>
Test firing of the weapon showed that 15 shots could be fired in 4.25 seconds, 
adding credence, the report said, to Hewlett's contention that he fired his 
weapon rapidly while trying to get Scriven off him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficulty in Focusing 
</P>
<P>
Hewlett, in statements that night to investigating officers, said he first 
fired his weapon as he was on the ground and Scriven was atop him, wrestling 
for control of his service revolver. Hewlett said he fired another burst at 
Scriven as he fell off him, but was unsure, because he had difficulty focusing 
on Scriven in the dark, whether he was hitting the youth. 
</P>
<P>
Scriven, who according to the district attorney's report had a lengthy criminal 
record and who at the time of his death was shown to have "a large quantity of 
amphetamine and methamphetamine" in his system, was chased into a field on the 
north side of Escondido by Hewlett after leading police on a high-speed chase 
in a stolen car. 
</P>
<P>
Scriven's family has filed a wrongful-death claim against Hewlett and the 
Police Department, claiming the officer used excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Based on Interviews 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's investigation was based on interviews with other 
officers, physical evidence at the scene, an autopsy report and a review of "a 
synopsis" of Hewlett's statements to investigators the night of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Miller noted, however, that there was no direct questioning of Hewlett because 
the officer's attorney, Everett Bobbitt, objected to it "without a guarantee 
tantamount to a grant of immunity from prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
"We view such a grant to be inappropriate," Miller said. "Regretfully, 
therefore, we are left to draw inferences as to how or why Officer Hewlett 
acted or reacted during the incident rather than being able to rely on his own 
detailed statements." 
</P>
<P>
Bobbitt said Tuesday he did not ask for immunity from prosecution, but only 
that any statements by his client not be used against him if authorities 
decided to prosecute the officer. Bobbitt said such requests are typical among 
attorneys such as himself who represent police officers involved in shootings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advised Against Statement 
</P>
<P>
"They could have still prosecuted him based on every other aspect of their 
investigation," Bobbitt said. "He (Hewlett) wanted to make a statement, but I 
specifically advised him not to. That's my advice in every case, no matter how 
clean the shooting is. The district attorney's office tells me they consider 
any officer's statements as self-serving, and, if they were going to prosecute 
him, I'd rather a jury hear his statement fresh than related second-hand." 
</P>
<P>
Miller suggested, in his report, that when a department interviews one of its 
officers involved in a shooting, it record the interview "by audiotape, 
videotape or both," so subsequent investigation does not rely on summaries. 
</P>
<P>
But Escondido Police Lt. Earl Callander said he knows of no departments that 
interview their officers on tape when they make their initial statement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Under Stress 
</P>
<P>
"We'll look at the suggestion, but what kind of detail do they want? Emotional 
reaction? We know the officers are under stress, so we're reluctant to do those 
kinds of tapes," Callander said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hewlett's lack of assistance notwithstanding, Miller's report clearly came down 
on the officer's side. 
</P>
<P>
It noted, for instance, that Scriven had a "significant history of committing 
crimes," including residential burglary and auto theft, had escaped from 
custody three times in the past and was on parole from the California Youth 
Authority -- where he had gained strength by working out with weights -- at the 
time of last January's incident. 
</P>
<P>
That night, Scriven was being pursued by a different Escondido police officer 
for speeding when Hewlett joined the chase, ending up as the first officer at 
the scene where Scriven sped out into the dirt and ran into a field with a 
thicket of brush up to 8 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Caught Scriven 
</P>
<P>
Hewlett caught Scriven and twice prepared to handcuff him. Both times, 
according to the report, Scriven bucked up and each time Hewlett hit him with 
his baton and got him back on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Scriven reared up a third time, knocking Hewlett -- who said he felt exhausted 
from the chase -- backward and onto his back, according to the report. Scriven 
maneuvered himself on top of the officer and, according to the officer's 
statement that night to others, he drew his right arm back as if he was going 
to slug the officer. 
</P>
<P>
"Next, he (Hewlett) pointed the pistol at the chest of Scriven and ordered him 
to stop or he would shoot," Miller's report stated. But Scriven grabbed the 
semiautomatic weapon with both hands and Hewlett "was consciously aware the 
pistol had no safety and would fire if pressure was applied to the trigger," 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fought for Gun 
</P>
<P>
The two fought for control of the gun and, at one point, Scriven pressed the 
weapon against Hewlett's throat -- a contention validated by abrasions on the 
officer's neck, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"Officer Hewlett remembers thinking that he was going to die unless he acted 
immediately," the report said. "He remembers believing that Scriven was going 
to shoot him with his own pistol and thinking that he did not want to die. He 
believed that, if he did not shoot Scriven, he would be killed." 
</P>
<P>
Hewlett pulled his pistol back from Scriven and fired toward Scriven, the 
report said. "He did not know if any of the shots struck Scriven. He said the 
area was completely dark and he was unable to clearly see Scriven." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, based in part on the findings of the autopsy, it seemed that Scriven 
was struck in the front, hand and side -- including the most probable fatal 
shot, which entered Scriven from his left side and perforated both lungs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fired Another Burst 
</P>
<P>
As Scriven fell backward, twisting toward his right, Hewlett fired another 
burst, hitting Scriven on the back side. 
</P>
<P>
By now, other officers had arrived, and they handcuffed Scriven. 
</P>
<P>
District attorney's investigators who visited the scene on a subsequent dark 
night said the high brush and the general terrain "could have easily enhanced 
and magnified Officer Hewlett's sense of personal peril." 
</P>
<P>
"Also, the firing of the pistol and the resulting flashes could have 
contributed to Officer Hewlett's inability to visually focus on Scriven. Such 
shots can distort vision on a dark night and that phenomenon may, in part, 
explain the firing of multiple shots," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said that "the physical stature of Robert Scriven suggests without 
question he had the ability to carry off such a struggle. Witnesses described 
him as very strong." His "condition and stability was also undoubtedly 
affected" by the use of methamphetamines, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ran From Officer 
</P>
<P>
"He compounded the situation by running away from the arresting officer 
followed by struggling with him," the report continued. "He had told witnesses 
he did not intend to go back to CYA." 
</P>
<P>
Miller conceded, "The number of shots fired is a significant matter for an 
evaluation on the justification of a police shooting incident." But it was not 
the sole determining factor as to whether the shooting was justified, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"We conclude that the quantum of force used by Officer Hewlett was not 
unreasonable when evaluated in relation to the level of threat perceived and 
described by him," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Bobbitt and Callander said they were satisfied by the report's conclusion. 
The Escondido Police Department will now, with Miller's report in hand, 
continue its own internal investigation with a shooting review board, as is 
customary whenever an officer fires his weapon, Callander said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Review Planned 
</P>
<P>
The police panel "will review Police Department policies, procedures and 
training related to this shooting incident," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hewlett returned to duty shortly after the shooting and was involved the 
following month in another pursuit -- this time, of a motorcyclist and his 
passenger who got on Interstate 15 in Escondido and allegedly sped north on 
their stolen vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
The chase wound through Gopher Canyon Road north of Escondido and headed into 
Vista, where the motorcycle went out of control and overturned in a field. 
</P>
<P>
Callander said that, although Hewlett was involved in the pursuit, the actual 
arrests were made by another Escondido police officer and a sheriff's deputy, 
along with a police dog, and that no injuries were reported.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANIMAL ACTIVISTS' ACTIVITIES LIMITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Abby Soven has issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting 
harassment of UCLA faculty members at their homes and other disruptive 
activities by Last Chance for Animals, an anti-vivisection group opposed to the 
use of animals in scientific research. 
</P>
<P>
The injunction issued May 26 specifies that Last Chance for Animals and six of 
its leaders cannot threaten, intimidate, harass or annoy UCLA faculty at their 
homes; break into or block UCLA facilities; interfere with or obstruct the 
teaching, research or other functions of the Westwood campus, or destroy any 
property belonging to the regents of the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA spokesman Richard Elbaum said the group has broken into campus 
laboratories where research involving animals has been under way and has 
harassed faculty members who conduct such research. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Rose, president of Last Chance for Animals who was named in the 
injunction, said the ruling is "a direct infringement of our constitutional 
rights" that "just goes to show the power of these institutions." 
</P>
<P>
"They can dictate their own law," he said. "But in no way will this deter us. 
We will prevail."

<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles man was convicted Tuesday of first-degree murder and could 
receive the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Bemore, 37, was found guilty in the Aug. 26, 1985, slaying of Kenneth 
Muck, 55, at the Aztec Liquor Store on El Cajon Blvd., which occurred during a 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
The jury found true two special-circumstances allegations that Muck was 
tortured during his slaying and that it occurred during a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
The same San Diego Superior Court jury will return June 19 to hear further 
evidence in the penalty phase, in which they will decide whether to recommend 
the gas chamber or life in prison without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
A co-defendant, Keith Cosby, 29, was found guilty of Muck's murder and the 
murder of another store clerk in a separate trial last year. Cosby was 
sentenced to life in prison without parole on Jan. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Bemore, a former Baptist minister and a former police officer in Palo Alto, 
testified in his own defense and denied committing the murder. He said he was 
committing a robbery in El Cajon at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen Anear said Muck was stabbed 37 times.

With a little help from its friends, the fourth California condor chick to 
hatch this year came into the world Tuesday morning at the San Diego Wild 
Animal Park. 
</P>
<P>
The chick, named Shasta, was assisted from its shell by two condor keepers and 
weighed in at 6.8 ounces, the park reported. Like its predecessors, the chick 
will remain in indoor isolation and be watched closely until it is moved to a 
small pen when it is about 2 months old. 
</P>
<P>
Shasta represents the first successful "double-clutch" hatching in captivity 
for the California condors. The first egg produced by its parents, AC4 and UN1, 
hatched two months ago. That chick now weighs about 3 pounds and has been moved 
into a pen. Last year, AC4 and UN1 also produced the first California condor 
chick ever both bred and hatched in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
The other two California condors hatched at the park this year also continue to 
do well, said Tom Hanscom, park spokesman. They weigh about 1 1/2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, AC4 and UN1 have begun rearing an Andean condor chick that was 
placed in their nest to see if they would do so. Closed-circuit television is 
being used to record for the first time the chick-rearing behaviors of the 
California condor.

$56 MILLION OF 'EMERGENCY' AID EARMARKED FOR JAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor on Tuesday released details of her request for 
$103 million in state and federal assistance in the city's war on drugs, 
issuing a plan that would devote $56 million to the construction and operation 
of jails. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor and the emergency council that was formed after the city declared a 
drug and gang "state of emergency" May 23 want the money to build a 750-bed 
pre-arraignment detention facility that would cost $37.8 million over three 
years and a 256-bed post-sentencing jail for drug offenders that would cost 
$18.2 million during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
The budget was released shortly after O'Connor, San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos 
and their police chiefs met in O'Connor's office with federal drug czar William 
Bennett to ask for federal assistance in battling drug- and gang-related 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Can't Wait Another 10 Years' 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, who presented the plan to Bennett, said San Diego's streets are 
"salvageable if we attack it now. We can't wait another 10 years. We can't wait 
another three years." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, on May 23, asked Deukmejian to declare a state of emergency and 
grant San Diego $34 million in aid from the state's $2.5-billion budget surplus 
to fight drug- and gang-related violence that resulted in four deaths and 43 
drive-by shootings during the first four months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The governor has not formally responded, but his spokesmen have questioned 
whether the gambit is a publicity stunt and have said that the money would have 
to be allocated through the legislative budget process where it would compete 
with requests from throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
On May 30, O'Connor said that $34 million is not enough, and the request has 
since grown into the $103-million spending plan released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The spending blueprint, which would devote more than half the funds to jails, 
reflects Police Chief Bob Burgreen's often-repeated belief that detention 
facilities are the city's top need. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quicker to Build a Private Facility 
</P>
<P>
The budget envisions a privately operated facility that would be cheaper to 
operate and quicker to build than a government facility. It also notes that the 
cost to the city for bed space could be reduced if the jail were on federal 
surplus land at a military reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next three years, the grant request also seeks $16.8 million for 89 
more police officers in gang and drug enforcement units, $6.9 million to build 
and operate four more courtrooms, $13.5 million for probation and drug 
treatment programs, $5.7 million for 28 more staffers in Dist. Atty. Edwin 
Miller's office and $4 million for community programs.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SANTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Santee man was ordered Tuesday to stand trial on charges of committing 
58 robberies throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Bresney, 38, is accused of being the "Walk to the Back" robber, in which 
the bandit told his victims in various stores to go to the back of the store 
while he made his getaway. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the victims were teen-agers or young adults who were working alone at 
the time of the hold-ups, which began Jan. 3 and ended with Bresney's arrest 
April 21 in North Park. 
</P>
<P>
For each day of the seven-day preliminary hearing, dozens of witnesses lined 
the hallways waiting to testify. San Diego Municipal Judge Charles Patrick set 
a June 20 arraignment and trial-setting appearance in Superior Court for 
Bresney, whom police have identified as a transient. 
</P>
<P>
The judge continued bail at $100,000, and Bresney has not been able to post it 
so far. Patrick dismissed seven counts because of insufficient evidence after 
three counts were added to the original 62 charges. 
</P>
<P>
About one-third of the hold-ups occurred in East County, but some occurred in 
Clairemont, Poway and North County.

MAN WHO KILLED 2 ROOMMATES IN COCAINE DISPUTE IS SENTENCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A 26-year-old West Hills man was sentenced Tuesday to 32 years to life in 
prison for hammering and stabbing to death two roommates because one of them 
refused to give him cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Jay Demand was convicted by Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Raymond Mireles 
last month of two counts of second-degree murder in connection with the Jan. 
18, 1988, slayings. The defense asked the judge to hear the case without a 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
The victims, Lori Elm, 18, and her boyfriend, Robert Ray Burley, 26, had been 
dead at least a week when their bodies were found in the house that they had 
shared with Demand in the 7500 block of Kentland Avenue, police said. Both had 
been beaten with a hammer. Burley had also been stabbed several times. 
</P>
<P>
Mireles on Tuesday imposed the maximum allowable sentence on Demand, saying 
that he disagreed with defense attorney Howard Waco and members of the 
defendant's family that drugs were to blame for Demand's violent actions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Don't Blame Cocaine' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't blame cocaine," Mireles said. "I blame children and adults who don't 
have the values to reject a substance that physically and emotionally destroys 
them. I don't sympathize with anyone who thinks cocaine is the problem. People 
are the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Before Demand's sentencing, Patrick Elm, father of the victim, asked to read a 
statement to the court: 
</P>
<P>
"All of us are victims of this horrendous crime," Elm said, referring to 
several members of his family present in the courtroom. "The grieving and 
day-to-day sorrow cannot be described. . . . We plead to the court to show no 
mercy toward Mark Demand. Mark Demand surely showed no mercy toward his 
victims." 
</P>
<P>
Elm has said his daughter only knew Burley and Demand a few weeks prior to her 
death. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I'm Sorry' 
</P>
<P>
Demand, who appeared nervous throughout the short proceeding, also asked to 
speak. "I'm sorry for what I've done. I don't know how it happened. . . . I 
don't think I'll ever be able to forgive myself." 
</P>
<P>
Police said Demand, who lived and worked at the house in exchange for drugs, 
attacked the couple after Burley refused to give him cocaine. Police believe 
that Burley was a cocaine dealer and said two large pythons found in the house 
were apparently used to guard his drugs. 
</P>
<P>
After the killings, Demand took two pounds of cocaine from the house and fled 
to Las Vegas in a taxi, police said. Once in Las Vegas, he was arrested in a 
hotel on a charge of possession of cocaine for sale. 
</P>
<P>
He was sentenced to 15 years in prison in Nevada, then extradited to Los 
Angeles to face the murder charges. Mireles ruled Tuesday that Demand will 
serve his sentences concurrently.

COMPANY FINED FOR FAILURE TO REPORT NEWHALL LIME SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The operator of a Newhall power plant was fined $10,000 Tuesday for failing to 
contact authorities in September after several hundred pounds of corrosive lime 
accidentally spilled out a silo and onto private property near three houses. 
</P>
<P>
The company, AES Placerita, pleaded no contest in Newhall Municipal Court to 
one misdemeanor count of failing to report a hazardous materials spill. The 
company could have been fined up to $25,000, Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. 
Atty. William W. Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
AES apparently is the first company to be convicted under a 1986 state law that 
requires industries to report spills of hazardous materials to authorities, 
Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
The law was prompted by a fire that gutted a Sylmar chemical plant in 1985, 
Carter said. Fifty-six people were slightly injured after inhaling noxious 
fumes during the blaze. At the time, firefighters complained that they did not 
know what kind of chemicals were stored on the property. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inspect Cleanups 
</P>
<P>
The aim of the 1986 law, Carter said, is to let authorities inspect the work of 
companies that mop up spills of potentially dangerous substances. In the AES 
case, the company cleaned up most but not all of the lime, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The spill occurred Sept. 2 after a panel in a silo gave way, said Robert B. 
Muir, AES assistant plant manager. Cleanup crews carted the lime away, 
returning most of it to the silo, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carter said the lime landed near a dry creek bed. He said nearby residents 
complained that the lime irritated their skin. Lime, which is classified as a 
hazardous substance, is more corrosive than toxic, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
Muir said AES, which operates power plants in Connecticut, Texas and Oklahoma, 
was unaware that lime spills had to be reported to authorities in California. 
He said the lime was identical to the kind used by gardeners and had low, 
non-hazardous alkaline levels. 
</P>
<P>
AES uses lime to clean water, which is turned into steam and then injected into 
the ground to loosen and extract oil, Muir said. The steam also powers 
electrical turbines that produce 98.7 megawatts an hour, enough electricity to 
serve the entire Santa Clarita Valley, Muir said. The plant began operating 
Aug. 29, five days before the spill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hauling Firm 
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated matter, a hauling firm employed by AES is under investigation 
by the district attorney's office for allegedly dumping about 1,000 pounds of 
non-hazardous waste in Towsley Canyon in October, Carter said. The powdery 
white waste contains salts, magnesium and lime and is a byproduct of the 
cogeneration process at AES, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
Ryco Equipment Co. of Bakersfield was paid by AES to cart off the powder to 
farmers, who used the substance as a soil conditioner. AES was not involved in 
the alleged dumping, Carter said. Muir said he did not learn of the 
investigation until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Muir said the power plant produces about 60 tons of the powder each week. The 
company will start looking for a new hauler, he said. "They won't be doing 
business for me for very long," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ryco officials declined to comment.

HOMEOWNERS LOSE ROUND;

<P>
L.A. PANEL SAYS CONDOS' GREENBELT IS RIGHT WIDTH 
</P>

<P>
In a partial defeat for a group of Woodland Hills homeowners, a Los Angeles 
City Council committee ruled Tuesday that city inspectors properly interpreted 
zoning maps when they measured the distance between a controversial condominium 
project and neighboring homes. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners have protested that the nearly completed complex at 20700 Ventura 
Blvd. was illegally constructed because it is too close to their houses and too 
tall. 
</P>
<P>
The building permit specified a 134-foot-wide greenbelt between the 24 luxury 
units and the adjacent single-family homes. The homeowners complain that the 
width of the irregularly shaped greenbelt should be measured at its narrowest 
point, but the builder measured at the widest point. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners have contended that the measurement was incorrect, allowing the 
developer to build a portion of the complex in the greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Planning and Environment Committee voted 2 to 1 to accept a city 
Planning Department report that said the greenbelt was measured properly and is 
wide enough to meet conditions on the building permit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeal Planned 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner representative Sidney Perry said his group mainly wanted the city to 
admit that the complex had been constructed in error, but did not necessarily 
want the portion built on the greenbelt to be torn down. He said he will appeal 
the ruling to the City Council, which must also approve the finding. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue here is the intent" of the conditions written into the building 
permit, Perry said. "In our opinion, this interpretation clearly breached the 
intent of those conditions." 
</P>
<P>
However, the homeowners are still waging a separate battle over the building 
height, which may require the developer to lop about two feet off the top. That 
issue will come before the city's Board of Zoning Appeals in August. 
</P>
<P>
In accepting the planning staff report, the council committee also agreed with 
an earlier decision by Chief Zoning Administrator Franklin P. Eberhard, who 
determined that the structure is too tall to meet a 45-foot height restriction 
imposed on the site 10 years ago. Development partner James R. Gary said he is 
appealing that decision. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Hal Bernson, committee chairman, dissented, saying the committee 
should not take a stand on the height dispute until the Board of Zoning Appeals 
has considered it.

KAMPF WINS VENTURA COLLEGE BOARD ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Elementary school principal Gregory Kampf overwhelmingly defeated opponent 
Dorothy Ballesteros Tuesday in a hotly contested race for a five-month term on 
the Ventura County Community College District Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
With all of the votes counted, Kampf, 37, defeated Ballesteros, 4,119 to 1,223, 
or 76.6% to 22.8%. The remaining votes were spread among several write-in 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, Kampf emphasized his experience as a Ventura elementary 
school principal and as a community college district board member from 1981 to 
1984. Ballesteros, a Ventura County drug-abuse counselor, cited her Latino 
heritage and her attendance as a single mother at Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
Kampf will represent parts of Ventura, Oxnard and unincorporated areas between 
the two cities. 
</P>
<P>
The election was called after four trustees deadlocked over a replacement for a 
fifth member who resigned in November. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, voters in the Ventura County community of Fillmore defeated a 
controversial $8-million bond issue meant to help pay for a new junior high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which required at least two-thirds of yes votes to pass, received 
990 yes votes to 1,016 no votes -- 49.4% to 50.6%.

SOCKERS LOSE CHANCE TO CELEBRATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The setting was right. The sellout crowd of 12,884 was louder than a New York 
subway station at rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers, with a 3-1 series lead, were a game from their seventh indoor 
championship. A victory would have meant a nice, happy celebration. 
</P>
<P>
But the Sockers ran smack into a Baltimore Blast team that changed identities 
this week. Blast Coach Kenny Cooper earlier called this a team of destiny. 
Tuesday at the San Diego Sports Arena, this was a team of desperation. 
</P>
<P>
And desperation was good enough. The Blast popped the Sockers' hopes of 
clinching their first championship at home in three years, scoring three 
fourth-quarter goals and surviving a short San Diego surge to grab a 6-3 
victory, narrowing the Sockers' lead to 3-2 in this Major Indoor Soccer League 
championship series. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the Blast spoiled the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't deserve to win it at home," defender Kevin Crow said. 
</P>
<P>
The series will resume Thursday night in Baltimore for Game 6 and, if needed, 
Saturday in Baltimore for Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers' downfall started with a goal by Blast forward David Byrne 4:15 
into the third quarter, which gave Baltimore a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
It continued when Blast forward Domenic Mobilio stole the ball at midfield from 
Socker defender Gus Mokalis. Mokalis fell down, leaving Mobilio all alone with 
teammate Mark Mettrick sprinting down the carpet to his right. Goalie Victor 
Nogueira sprinted out to meet Mobilio, who tapped the ball neatly to Mettrick. 
Mettrick scored to give the Blast a 4-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what it's all about," Cooper said. "We talked about stealing the ball." 
</P>
<P>
And stealing the fun. 
</P>
<P>
"All we heard about was the celebration parties," Cooper said. "We never looked 
as it was 3-1 down. It was a game." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Sockers Coach Ron Newman is more prophetic than many thought. He warned 
that Baltimore was good enough to come back at any point during this series. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get Baltimore in a position where they've got nothing to lose, 
they're a dangerous team," Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
Mokalis made amends of sorts for his blunder, scoring with eight minutes 
remaining to pull the Sockers within a goal. But Baltimore refused to release 
its grasp on this victory, which gives the Blast both momentum and home-field 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going home," Cooper said. "(The Sockers) are going to come to Baltimore 
and play well but we're going home and our fans are going to come out." 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore took some spirit out of this sellout crowd just 1 minute 49 seconds 
into the first quarter, Freddie Thompson taking a crossing pass from Carl 
Valentine and sending it into the right corner of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
But the Sockers responded. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn pressured Blast goalie Scott Manning, forcing a deflection off Manning's 
foot that sailed directly to Branko Segota's forehead. Segota, situated just a 
few feet inside the red line, sent a header floating over Manning, who 
retreated quickly but couldn't catch up. Tie game. 
</P>
<P>
The Blast regained the lead on a nifty shot by Billy Ronson. With his back to 
the goal, Ronson struck the ball with his heel, sending it to the left of 
Nogueira. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the first quarter, Zoran Karic, the Sockers' leading scorer during the 
regular season, did something typical followed by something unusual. He scored, 
left-footed, tying the game. Then, he made his first visit to the plexiglass to 
slap hands with the fans. Championship game stuff. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers did some nice passing late in the second quarter but were unable to 
break the tie. 
</P>
<P>
The third quarter was humming along uneventfully until just inside the final 
two minutes. Blast midfielder Mike Sweeney sent a corner kick deflecting off 
the boards. Byrne was waiting, touching it in from a few feet away for his 
second goal of the series and a 3-2 Blast advantage. 
</P>
<P>
It was at that moment this momentum of this series changed. The crowd became 
less of a factor each time a Blast player took control of the ball. Mobilio's 
steal merely punctuated the lost spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Taking a look back, the Sockers missed their share of prime opportunities in 
the third quarter. Segota, wide open in front of the goal, took a pass from 
Karic but pushed it wide left. Paul Dougherty had an opportunity minutes later, 
but shot over the top of the goal when free at the red line. 
</P>
<P>
The Blast scored two insurances goals late, after the Sockers had pulled 
Nogueira in favor of a sixth attacker. Carl Valentine got the first. Billy 
Ronson got the second, his second of the game and 16th of the series.

GLAVINE, BRAVES PUT DODGERS TO SLEEP, 3-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Dodgers got to bed early Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
After being required to stay awake long past midnight for a 22-inning game 
against the Houston Astros last Saturday night and in the second game of a 
doubleheader against the Atlanta Braves Monday night, they were back in their 
hotel rooms before 11 p.m., EST, following a game that lasted only 2 hours 6 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the Dodgers, their departure from Atlanta-Fulton County 
Stadium was expedited by left-hander Tom Glavine of the Atlanta Braves, who 
needed only 91 pitches to beat them, 3-0, on a six-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
The shutout was the eighth against the Dodgers this season. 
</P>
<P>
And the performance of Glavine, a former wing from Concord, Mass., who was once 
a draft choice of the Kings, seemed to have the effect of a cross-check on Fred 
Claire, executive vice president of the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Claire is concerned about the Dodgers' lack of punch. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to judge the team on one game, but we've now played a third of 
the season," said Claire, who didn't have to point out to reporters that the 
Dodgers' team batting average of .229 is the worst in the major leagues. "I 
want to see our productivity improve. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to take advantage of the opportunities that are there. This was 
another case of a game where we were one hit away." 
</P>
<P>
It was not as if the Dodgers were overwhelmed, Claire said, but a loss is a 
loss, and this was the Dodgers' seventh in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
However, Claire indicated that he plans no major moves. 
</P>
<P>
"The answer lies within the talent in this room," he said. "There's not going 
to be a major overhaul of this club. We've already done that. If we're wrong, 
we're wrong. But I don't think we're wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are, I'll take full responsibility for it. I believe in this club. What 
we have to do, basically, is fine-tune." 
</P>
<P>
Glavine, meanwhile, seems to be running well. 
</P>
<P>
A 17-game loser last season and 0-5 with a 7.90 earne-run average against the 
Dodgers before this season, he added about 10 pounds to his 6-foot-1, 190-pound 
frame last winter through weightlifting. 
</P>
<P>
Also, as he monitored the progress of the Kings, he wondered what it might have 
been like to play on a line with Wayne Gretzky, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wondered what might have happened if I'd gone that route," said 
Glavine, a fourth-round pick of the Kings and a second-round selection of the 
Braves in 1984. "But the way things have gone for me here, I can't second-guess 
what I've done." 
</P>
<P>
Glavine, 23, beat the Dodgers in the Braves' home opener, 6-1, allowing only 
four hits and no earned runs, and was 5-0 by the middle of May. 
</P>
<P>
The last Brave left-hander to open the season with victories in his first five 
decisions was Warren Spahn, who won his first eight in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
But at Chicago May 16, Glavine gave up hits to the first four batters he faced 
in a 4-3 loss to the Cubs and, what's worse, sprained his left ankle on a play 
at first base. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't pitch again for two weeks and, including the loss to the Cubs, was 
0-2 in his last three starts before Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had better stuff, but I guess that's where my maturity comes in," Glavine 
said of his third shutout. "If I went out there last year with the stuff I had 
tonight, I would have been out by the second or third inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't have known what to do. But I just kept missing speeds and mixing 
locations and trying to keep guys off-balance." 
</P>
<P>
He was given a 2-0 lead on a run-scoring double by Tommy Gregg in the first 
inning and an RBI single by Dale Murphy in the third, both off Dodger starter 
Mike Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers didn't get a runner to second base until the eighth, when singles 
by Alfredo Griffin and Jose Gonzalez, plus Willie Randolph's walk, loaded the 
bases with two out and brought up Kirk Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
Glavine's first offering to Gibson, the pitcher said, was poorly thrown -- it 
was inside instead of outside -- but it jammed Gibson, who popped it up. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, that was the game," Brave Manager Russ Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
To the Dodgers, it was, too. 
</P>
<P>
Andres Thomas hit his eighth home run in the bottom of the inning, lofting a 
pitch from reliever Tim Crews over the left-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
Glavine worked a 1-2-3 ninth for this third shutout of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The weary Dodgers retreated to their hotel rooms to rest. 
</P>
<P>
And Fred Claire continued to fret. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Said Atlanta Manager Russ Nixon, after the Braves were swept in Monday night's 
doubleheader: "I'm getting sick and tired of losing. Their club played 
500-something innings in three days and we looked worse than they did." . . . 
Including Sunday's 13-inning game against the Houston Astros and the two games 
Monday night, the Dodgers played 53 innings in three days, or one inning fewer 
than the equivalent of six games. 
</P>
<P>
The extra work taxed the pitching staff, which got a boost Monday night from 
rookies Ramon Martinez and John Wetteland. Martinez, recalled Sunday from the 
Dodgers' triple-A affiliate at Albuquerque, N.M., pitched a six-hitter in 
winning the opener, 7-0, and Wetteland allowed two hits in five innings of the 
5-2 nightcap. "The contributions they made can't be overemphasized," Fred 
Claire, Dodger executive vice president, said Tuesday. "Those two may have 
saved our season. We needed those wins desperately." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Martinez was optioned back to Albuquerque because Claire doesn't 
want to carry 11 pitchers and prefers that Martinez get regular work. "He will 
be back and he will pitch here for a long time," Claire said. . . . Martinez, 
who was told of his demotion Tuesday at 2:30 a.m., about 45 minutes after the 
end of the second game of the doubleheader, was surprised and disappointed. 
"It's hard for me to understand," he said. "My feeling was, I would never go 
back to Albuquerque. It's a bigger surprise now than in the spring." . . . 
Martinez was replaced on the roster by Tracy Woodson, who in 57 games at 
Albuquerque hit .309 with 11 home runs and 44 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
John Tudor, who has not pitched for the Dodgers since Game 3 of the World 
Series last October, will make a rehabilitation start for the Class A Vero 
Beach Dodgers today against the Winter Haven Red Sox at Vero Beach, Fla. . . . 
Fernando Valenzuela, 0-5 this season and winless in 19 starts since last June 
14, will take his regularly scheduled turn in the rotation tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves placed first-baseman Gerald Perry on the 15-day disabled list and 
called up outfielder-first-baseman Jeff Wetherby from their Richmond AAA farm 
team. Perry partially dislocated his left shoulder while diving for a foul ball 
off the bat of Mike Scioscia in the fifth inning of Monday night's first game. 
It is the same shoulder which he injured last June. Perry was hitting .246 with 
three home runs and 15 RBIs. Wetherby, 25, was batting .262 with one homer and 
13 RBIs in 47 games for Richmond.

MORNING BRIEFING: PLEADING THE CASE FOR MAN'S BEST FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The University of Virginia was criticized by the American Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals because its veterinary school used stray dogs 
from pounds for research. 
</P>
<P>
Said Alan Williams, the school's faculty athletic representative: "So now we're 
using lawyers. There's more of them, and nobody cares how they're treated." 
</P>
<P>
Name game: Chris Berman, the ESPN announcer who pins those goofy nicknames on 
ballplayers, is at it again this season, and here are some early offerings: 
</P>
<P>
Roberto (Remember the) Alomar, David (Sili) Cone, David (Death) Valle, John 
(Hia) Wathan, Tom (Cotton) Candiotti, Chili (Con Carne) Davis, Todd (Mercedes) 
Benzinger, Craig (For What It's) Worthington and Rob (Double) Dibble. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Bill (Beethoven) Schroeder, Mike (Nova) Scioscia, Gene (Full) 
Nelson, Bob (Intentional) Walk, Dennis (Fluorescent) Lamp, John (I Am Not a) 
Kruk, Marty (Grin and) Barrett and Kirt (What Was That) Manwaring. 
</P>
<P>
He even has separate nicknames for the Maddux brothers -- Mike (Matha) Maddux 
and Greg (Appo) Maddux. 
</P>
<P>
Add Berman: He recently ventured into golf with this one: Bob (Curds And) Tway. 
And, a nickname to end all nicknames: Larry Mize (Have Seen the Glory). Get it? 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Which player had the longest hitting streak in the major leagues 
last season? 
</P>
<P>
He got the point: When told that Tony Mandarich, 300-pound Green Bay Packers 
draftee, was being ballyhooed as an opponent for Mike Tyson, former New York 
Jets star Joe Klecko, who boxed at Temple, recalled an afternoon with Joe 
Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd never sparred with Frazier before but now I was in there banging with him 
and I guess I got a little too loose," Klecko told the New York Times. "He 
threw a left hook but he stopped it right there next to my head, then he 
laughed. That one left hook was enough for me to realize that I didn't really 
want to be a boxer." 
</P>
<P>
Radar Ryan: Texas Rangers Manager Bobby Valentine says of Nolan Ryan: "On our 
radar gun at Arlington Stadium, Nolan has topped out at 97 m.p.h. And he's 
averaged 93 m.p.h. Averaged."

Says Minnesota Twins' hitting coach Tony Oliva, a former batting champion: 
"He's the fastest I've faced, and that includes Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, Sam 
McDowell, Jim Palmer, Bob Gibson and J.R. Richard." 
</P>
<P>
Add Ryan: He struck out Bo Jackson six straight times before the Kansas City 
Royals slugger hit a 461-foot shot off him last month. It was the longest 
measured home run in Arlington Stadium history. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan had thrown a couple of knockdown pitches before Jackson unloaded, and Bo 
said, "I don't know if he was wild or not. But Nolan Ryan has been pitching 
longer than I've been alive. If he wanted to hit me, he could have." 
</P>
<P>
Says Terry Francona of the Milwaukee Brewers: "When I see his name in the 
pitching probables, I don't exactly hurry to the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
Would-you-believe-it Dept.: Johnny Bench, voted into the Hall of Fame this 
year, is younger than Royal catcher Bob Boone. Boone will be 42 on Nov. 19, or 
18 days before Bench.

Trivia answer: John Shelby of the Dodgers, 24 games.

<P>
DRAFT WORTH CELEBRATING FOR SALKELD FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
'Twas the night before the baseball amateur draft and all through the house, 
everyone was stirring -- except Roger Salkeld. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the first one to go to bed last night and the last one to get up this 
morning," Elaine Salkeld said of her son Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
This was the day for which the Salkeld family had waited. Bill Salkeld, whose 
father, William, played eight years in the big leagues with the Pirates, White 
Sox and Boston Braves, admittedly had longed to see the family name back in pro 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Salkeld, who was born four years after his grandfather died, was only a 
phone call away from making his father's dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the season, Salkeld, Saugus High's 6-foot-5 senior right-hander with 
the major league fastball, had been projected to be an early draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, on the biggest day of his life, he was anything but an early riser. 
</P>
<P>
"I sleep fine," Salkeld said, smiling. "You've heard about kids who can't sleep 
before Christmas? Not me." 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld, however, was up and about in time to answer the telephone at 10:31 
a.m. To the surprise of almost no one, Salkeld had been selected by the Seattle 
Mariners as the No. 3 pick in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"He just said, 'Congratulations' and 'You have been selected,' " Salkeld said. 
"I don't even remember his name. After that, he wanted to talk to my dad. That 
was about it." 
</P>
<P>
The phone call kicked off a day-long, open-door celebration at the Salkeld 
house. Teammates, coaches, family and friends gathered amid a carnival-like 
atmosphere with banners and barbecued hot dogs, streamers and helium-filled 
balloons. 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld, who has a collection of every major league hat, donned Mariner 
headgear and mingled among guests between fielding phone calls from 
well-wishers and reporters. Newspaper photographers -- anyone with a camera, 
really -- wanted a shot of the most famous pitcher in Saugus High history. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus Coach Doug Worley announced that a ceremony would be held to retire 
Salkeld's No. 15 jersey. Worley, a Seattle native and Mariner fan, was 
delighted by the news and said that the Centurions, who are scheduled to 
receive new uniforms next season, might be outfitted to resemble the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
"He was dancing around here with different hats on," Worley said. "I said, 'Get 
that hat off.' I'm happy that he was drafted high." 
</P>
<P>
A beaming Bill Salkeld, whose father blasted a home run off Cleveland Indian 
Hall of Famer Bob Feller in the 1948 World Series, offered an extended hand to 
everyone who walked through his front door. 
</P>
<P>
"My dream was to bring back my father's name," he said. "It's wonderful. It's a 
West Coast team. We couldn't have asked for anything better." 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld, who three years ago was a baby-faced freshman summoned to join the 
varsity, is now on the threshold of becoming a bonus baby. 
</P>
<P>
Contract negotiations are scheduled to begin next week, according to Dave Aust, 
director of public relations for the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
Aust declined comment regarding a signing bonus. Bill Salkeld, who will serve 
as his son's agent, also declined comment, saying only that he would request "a 
fair offer for a first-round pick." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Steve Avery, a high school pitcher from Michigan now with the 
Atlanta Braves' at the Class-A level, was the third player selected. He 
received a signing bonus reported to be $211,000. 
</P>
<P>
No decision has been made regarding where Salkeld will be assigned, Aust said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to get him signed," Aust said. "Obviously, when you're picked third, 
you're one of the best arms in the country." 
</P>

SLOWDOWN CONTINUES DESPITE CITY'S ATTEMPT TO SPEED UP PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
This month marks the end of the second year of the City of Los Angeles' "Go 
Golf Program," a campaign designed to speed up play on the heavily trafficked 
municipal courses, where a round of golf during peak hours can take about as 
long as a transcontinental flight. 
</P>
<P>
By all measurements, the program has not been very successful. 
</P>
<P>
"It went off very successfully," said city Recreation and Parks Department 
spokesman Al Goldfarb. "We surveyed the golfers and got nearly a 90% acceptance 
of the program. 
</P>
<P>
"But because it was expensive to maintain with the part-time help we had, we 
have had to cut back a considerable amount on monitoring the program." 
</P>
<P>
The program is now used only on major courses, such as the Sepulveda Dam 
courses of Encino, Balboa and Woodley, and Rancho Park and Griffith Park, 
according to Goldfarb. 
</P>
<P>
The program -- whereby a round of golf at an 18-hole course is designed to be 
completed in less than 4 1/2 hours, and which utilizes subtle messages on signs 
along with the polite urging of marshals to keep play moving -- has not 
resulted in significantly faster rounds, according to dozens of players 
interviewed at local courses. 
</P>
<P>
It has, most said, helped educate and thus speed up the slowest of the golfers. 
But overall, according to virtually every golfer who was asked, the program has 
had little impact. The Recreation and Parks Department keeps no statistics on 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
"Occasionally the problem was some beginning golfer just didn't know the rules 
and didn't understand what he was supposed to do, and his partners probably 
didn't know much more," said Aaron Keppler of Tarzana, a frequent player at the 
Encino golf course. "The program with the signs and the marshals has helped 
those guys to play faster." 
</P>
<P>
But the real problem is golfers who know the rules and understand golf 
etiquette, but still play at roughly the same speed as growing hair. They stand 
over a ball for endless minutes, hitching up their green walrus pants and 
crouching down to line up the ball, dangling the club to find some imaginary 
line that they don't quite understand and then repeating the whole process 
again a minute later. 
</P>
<P>
And that's just on the tee. On the green they hover over a putt for ages, 
switching their focus from the ball to the hole and back again. 
</P>
<P>
"But the thing that really makes me mad," Dale Thomson of Sylmar said, "are 
those guys who have never hit a ball more than 145 yards in their life, and 
every time they stand over the ball on a fairway they think they might hit that 
one 320 yards. They wait and wait until the group in front of them is nearly 
out of sight, about a half-mile away, and then the guy rips this ground ball 
about 90 feet. It just drives me crazy. After you play golf for a few years, 
you know how far you can hit a ball. Some of these guys are just out of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any difference at all in the time it takes to play a round since 
this program started. If anything, it seems to me it might take longer, on the 
average, because every month there are new players . . . more players." 
</P>
<P>
Can't beat the price: Professionals from the city's 18-hole courses will 
provide free lessons June 27-29 for golfers under the age of 18, the Recreation 
and Parks Department has announced. The clinics will be held from 9:30 to 11:30 
a.m. each day at the Sepulveda golf courses, Hansen Dam courses and Rancho Park 
in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Golfers must bring their own clubs and pay for a bucket of practice balls. 
</P>
<P>
A long-shot shot: Sam Boris of Sherman Oaks scored his first hole-in-one last 
week, 55 years after taking up the sport. 
</P>
<P>
Using a driver on the par-3, 212-yard 8th hole at Rancho Park, Boris lofted his 
tee shot into a stiff wind. It landed on the green, took a couple of bounces, 
slammed into the pin and dropped into the cup.

DIGEST: 9 FROM VALLEY TO PLAY IN ALL-STAR GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shortstop Gino Tagliaferri of Kennedy High and eight other Valley-area players 
have been selected to a 20-member team that will represent the City Section in 
an all-star baseball game against a group of Orange County players on June 15 
at 7 p.m. at USC's Dedeaux Field. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliaferri led the Valley in home runs this season with 13. 
</P>
<P>
Other Valley-area players selected are third baseman Rich Aude, catcher Eric 
Johnson and pitcher Derek Wallace of Chatsworth, outfielder Jason Shapiro and 
catcher Adam Zutler of Taft, first baseman Tim Costic of Monroe, outfielder 
Eddie Chavez of Poly and catcher Rudy Sanchez of San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
The players were chosen after a tryout last weekend at University High. The 
City Section will be coached by Bob Moroney of Bell, Ron Kasparian of 
Westchester and Kermit Taylor of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Jason Evans of Chatsworth and catcher Casey Burrill of Hart have been

</P>
<P>
Peter Washington, a two-year standout from College of the Canyons, has given an 
oral commitment to play baseball next season at Cal Lutheran. Washington was a 
designated-hitter for the Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
John Tomac of Chatsworth remains the top American in the Milk Race, but he is 
being challenged for that status in the longest bicycle race in an 
English-speaking country by Celestial Seasonings teammate Gary Mulder of 
Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Tomac is in 19th place overall -- 1:42 behind overall leader Olaf Lurvik of 
Norway -- after Tuesday's 79-mile stage that concluded in Harrogate, England. 
Mulder is in 20th, two seconds behind Tomac.

Paramount Communications Inc.: The entertainment and publishing firm, formerly 
known as Gulf &amp; Western Inc., reported that second-quarter earnings rose 
18% to $65.6 million. Revenue for the period, not including the Associates, the 
financial services business it is selling, rose 13% to $699 million. The firm 
said income from continuing operations included record contributions from the 
entertainment business, due to sharp increases in Paramount Pictures' 
operations and gains by Madison Square Garden. This performance was more than 
offset by losses in Simon &amp; Schuster's educational publishing business and 
declines in its consumer and professional information areas.

The price of gold shot up nearly $12 an ounce in late trading Tuesday, while 
the dollar slipped. 
</P>
<P>
Some dealers said gold rallied in a belated response to the turmoil in China, 
but others said technical factors were behind the late spurt. The dollar was 
actually lower earlier Tuesday in Hong Kong, which is most sensitive to what 
happens in China. 
</P>
<P>
Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $376.70 an ounce as of 
4 p.m. EDT, up from $364.80 on Monday. That brought it back to its levels of 
early May, but well below January levels, when it was more than $400 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
After about three months of declining prices, gold and silver posted a solid 
gain as demand for the metal increased in the aftermath of China's domestic 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first meaningful rally in the past three or four months," said 
Peter Cardillo, an analyst with Josephthal &amp; Co. in New York. "A lot of 
people in Hong Kong have been sellers of gold and purchasers of dollars. That 
has stopped, causing the market to react positively." 
</P>
<P>
Investors often turn to gold and silver, which are looked upon as more stable 
investments, as a hedge in times of turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor in the buying of precious metals was the recommendation by the 
United States that its citizens leave China, and a slight decline Tuesday in 
the value of the U.S. dollar, Cardillo said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no major economic news to account for the retreat of the dollar after 
its gains Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A pattern of sharp, unexplained drops in the dollar indicated that the Federal 
Reserve might have sold dollars secretly, said Michael McGuinness, an 
investment officer in foreign exchange at Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Several traders have speculated in the past two weeks that the Federal Reserve 
and other central banks are trying to get extra impact from their intervention 
by concealing it more than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost $1.5665 to buy 
one pound, compared to $1.5815 late Monday. Later in New York the pound rose to 
$1.5710 from $1.5655 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
rose 1.98 yen to a closing 142.63 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 
143.28 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to 142.67 yen from 142.95. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late Monday's rates, included: 
1.9735 West German marks, down from 1.9855; 1.7095 Swiss francs, down from 
1.7140; 1.2010 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2019; 6.7060 French francs, down 
from 6.7455, and 1,434 Italian lire, down from 1,442. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared to late Monday: 1.9850 West German 
marks, up from 1.9630; 1.7240 Swiss francs, up from 1.6950; 6.7360 French 
francs, up from 6.6645; 2.2370 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2010; 1,443.00 Italian 
lire, up from 1,416.50, and 1.2015 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2003. 
</P>
<P>
Gold rose $9.12 an ounce today on the Hong Kong market, opening at $376.02. It 
closed at $366.90 Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $365.25 an ounce, compared to late 
Monday's $366.25. In Zurich, gold dropped to a bid of $365.30, compared to 
$366.00 late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But on the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery 
rose to $379.90 an ounce from $367.50 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Silver bullion prices rose on the London market where the metal was trading at 
a late bid price of $5.28 an ounce, compared to Monday's $5.31. On New York's 
Comex, silver bullion for current delivery rose to $5.431 an ounce from $5.264 
on Monday.

COURT WON'T HEAR CASE OF DISPLACED ART 
</P>

The U. S. Supreme Court has refused to hear a case filed on behalf of artist 
David Avalos over a judge's 1986 removal of a temporary sculpture from the 
Federal Courthouse plaza here. 
</P>
<P>
"It just shows how much more work has to be done to get at a climate in which 
free expression is encouraged," Avalos said Tuesday, a day after the court's 
decision. "Technically, the law has been carried out, but justice has not been 
served." 
</P>
<P>
Avalos, an artist of national repute, spoke as he was about to leave for New 
York, where he has a solo art exhibit opening next week. He said the Supreme 
Court's refusal means he has more work to do. 
</P>
<P>
"All the way up and down the line, federal court judges made it their business 
that another federal judge, Gordon Thompson Jr., escaped the scrutiny of the 
legal system," said Avalos, who lives in National City. "It's hard for justice 
to get up on her own scales and weigh the system. At what point do those people 
who make decisions . . . cease to be accountable?" 
</P>
<P>
Avalos was represented by Gregory Marshall, who filed the suit in Thompson's 
court in 1986 as an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union. Thompson 
was the primary defendant. 
</P>
<P>
"I was disappointed because we did not get a hearing on the case," Marshall 
said. "The essential issues of the case were never heard. David really was 
deprived of a true day in court." 
</P>
<P>
Avalos' wooden construction, titled "San Diego Donkey Cart," depicted an 
immigration official arresting an undocumented worker. 
</P>
<P>
Although the General Services Administration had issued a permit for the 
display, Thompson, a chief U. S. District Court judge, ordered it removed, 
saying it was a security risk and "an invitation for a kook to do some harm to 
it or the building." Avalos claimed censorship, saying his First Amendment 
rights to free speech were violated. 
</P>
<P>
The trial court ruled that the GSA had erred in revoking the permit, but the 
key issue was whether Thompson had a right to order the GSA to revoke the 
permit, and that has never been heard, Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
The U. S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal, saying the case 
was moot, "that we got all the relief we were entitled to," Marshall said. 
"They never stated a legitimate reason, which is highly irregular." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall called Monday's denial "the same as the court holding that Judge 
Thompson is free to do that at any time." 
</P>
<P>
Avalos took his case to the Supreme Court for "real solid reasons." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not something I came up with overnight," Avalos said. "It's something 
I've been doing as a Chicano for two decades. It connects me to the history of 
the United States. It has to do with the exercise of rights. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing to say I have First Amendment rights. It's another thing to 
wear a T-shirt that says 'Ed Meese is a pig.' One is the profession of rights, 
and one is the exercise of rights. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it may appear frivolous. A donkey cart may look frivolous, but I 
think the principles aren't frivolous." 
</P>
<P>
Avalos is an outspoken artist with substantial credentials as an advocate for 
Chicano causes. In January, 1988, he was one of three artists who produced a 
controversial poster critical of the way San Diego's tourist industry employs 
undocumented workers. 
</P>
<P>
Titled "Welcome to America's Finest Tourist Plantation," the piece was funded 
in part through hotel and motel bed taxes and affixed to the backs of 100 San 
Diego Transit buses. The triptych showed the hands of hotel and restaurant 
workers and a law officer handcuffing workers. 
</P>
<P>
The posters were up during the week of Super Bowl XXII, and city officials 
sought, unsuccessfully, to remove them. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, Avalos and his poster collaborators struck again. Installation 
Gallery commissioned Deborah Small, Avalos and bus poster artists Elizabeth 
Sisco and Louis Hock to paint a billboard as part of the city's annual downtown 
Artwalk festival. 
</P>
<P>
The billboard raised the issue of racism in San Diego by focusing on the city's 
unwillingness to name the new convention center for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Next to a black-and-white portrait of the Nobel Peace Prize winner were the 
words "Welcome to America's Finest a) city b) tourist plantation c) Convention 
Center." 
</P>
<P>
Until late 1988, Avalos served as an artist in residence at the Centro Cultural 
de la Raza. Last year he resigned to begin graduate studies in art at UC San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Avalos' solo exhibition of sculptural pieces and tables, "Cafe Mestizo," will 
be on view at the Intar Latin American Gallery in New York City from Tuesday 
through July 23.

The Senate put itself on a collision course with the House as it neared 
completion of a $3.3-billion emergency spending bill that leaves out $822 
million in anti-drug money the House had earlier approved. The Senate failed to 
finish work on the spending measure but was expected to pass the "dire 
emergency" fiscal 1989 supplemental spending bill today. The bill would then go 
to a House-Senate conference committee, where lawmakers from both chambers 
would try to work out differences with the $3.7-billion version passed by the 
House late last month. The House plan includes money for increased drug 
enforcement, hiring more prosecutors, building more prisons and adding more 
education programs. Inclusion of the anti-drug funds is opposed by the White 
House.

The Food and Drug Administration said it planned a 98% reduction in the amount 
of lead permitted to reach beverages from ceramic pitchers because of new 
evidence that extremely small amounts of lead can hurt children. Lead at 
concentrations tolerable by adults can limit body growth and intelligence of 
children and can cause brain damage and behavior problems. Lead in pitchers 
comes from the glaze commonly used to make ceramics smooth and impervious. 
Officials are most concerned about acidic liquids such as orange juice eating 
away at the glaze and causing lead to leach. Small cream pitchers would not be 
subject to the new standard.

An explosion ruptured a Soviet gas pipeline near the border with Romania hours 
before a similar accident killed hundreds of people aboard two trains 1,300 
miles to the east, a Soviet newspaper reported. The daily Sotsialisticheskaya 
Industria, quoting a railways ministry official, said a blast similar to the 
one that engulfed two trains in the Ural Mountains -- leaving an estimated 462 
people dead or missing -- occurred Saturday in the republic of Moldavia. "The 
explosion occurred 500 yards from the rail line and interrupted traffic on the 
international line. This time, fortunately, there were no casualties." It gave 
no further details.

U.S. Capitol police are investigating syndicated columnist Jack Anderson for 
smuggling a pistol into the U.S. Capitol to demonstrate security lapses at the 
tightly guarded building, congressional authorities said. Anderson displayed 
the unloaded handgun, and a bullet, on May 24 when he interviewed Senate 
Republican leader Bob Dole in the Capitol for a television special on 
terrorism, said Dole spokesman Walt Riker. Riker said Anderson claimed to have 
walked through a metal detector with the 9-millimeter Austrian-made pistol on 
his way to Dole's office.

SOVIET RIOT TOLL PUT AT 100

About 100 people were killed and scores injured in ethnic rioting between the 
tiny Meskhetin Turkish community and majority Uzbeks and police in Uzbekistan 
last weekend, Soviet television reported. More than 6,000 riot police were 
flown to the remote manufacturing region in the far eastern tip of the Soviet 
Central Asian republic to help maintain order, the Ministry of Internal Affairs 
said. The television news program "Vremya" said that "no one can answer the 
question" of what sparked the violence. However, other sources said it started 
when a Turk insulted a Uzbek produce seller in the town of Tashlak. The ethnic 
clashes, which began May 23, were the worst to hit the Soviet Union since 
ethnic clashes in Azerbaijan in February, 1988.

Critics of a proposed off-road motorcycle park in El Dorado National Forest say 
the U.S. Forest Service has used "heavy-handed tactics" against three people 
who have opposed the plan. The president of a group formed to oppose the park 
lost her job as a waitress. A state biologist who warned against damage to deer 
ranges was accused of drinking on the job. A federal geologist who said the 
park could cause severe soil erosion is facing a 28-day suspension without pay. 
"Somebody wanted to play some heavy-handed tactics," said Sharon Duggan, a 
Sacramento attorney representing Friends Aware of Wildlife Needs in litigation 
against the project. The Forest Service wants to create 65 miles of off-road 
motorcycle trails across 22,000 acres of federal forest land between Sacramento 
and Lake Tahoe.

West Germany scrapped plans for a costly nuclear power plant, and two firms in 
Munich said they will build a solar-cell factory on the site. The decision not 
to build the controversial facility at Wackersdorf, in Bavaria, had been 
expected, since utilities had backed out of it for cost reasons. Siemens, an 
electronics company, and Bayernwerk, a utility firm, said they will invest $50 
million in the solar-cell facility, which will employ about 400 people and 
produce 20 megawatts of power annually, beginning in the early 1990s.

Hezbollah (Party of God) near Israel's self-declared security zone in southern 
Lebanon, police said. No casualties were reported. There was no immediate

Ethiopian President Mengistu Haile Mariam said more than 180 top military 
officers are being held in connection with a bloody coup attempt last month in 
which 11 mutinous generals were killed. At a rare news conference in Addis 
Ababa, the Marxist president gave details of the May 16 attempt for the first 
time. He said 27 senior army officers, 11 of them generals, were killed by 
troops who quelled the revolt, which took place while Mengistu was on a state 
visit to East Germany. Two coup leaders, armed forces Chief of Staff Merid 
Negusie and air force commander Amha Desta, committed suicide on the day of the 
attempt when they realized that their plans had been discovered, according to 
Mengistu.

A LETTER FROM CHINA: IF MY YOUNG SON CAN FIGHT FOR FREEDOM, WHY CAN'T I? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This letter from a senior official of a Chinese corporation on the mainland 
near Hong Kong was sent Tuesday to an American business contact in California. 
</P>
<P>
 I am weeping while writing you this letter. Right now in the capital of China, 
there have been more than 20,000 students and citizens fighting for China's 
democracy and freedom. Among them are 70-year-olds and children as young as 9 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
Beijing, the city many foreigners long for, now has become the battlefield, 
site of the massacre. Channels of communication from Beijing have been blocked 
throughout China, and the government uses this ugly method to deceive all the 
people nationwide. However, people in southern China listen and watch reports 
from Hong Kong television and radio. We are well-informed. 
</P>
<P>
My son and my brother, who just received his master's degree, and my 
sister-in-law are all in Beijing and participated in this patriotic movement. 
They are all young and hoping to fight for a brighter future. They don't even 
take the possibility of death into consideration. 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't do anything in terms of saying what they should or shouldn't do. 
They have their own thoughts, own opinions. Anyhow, nothing is more precious 
than democracy and freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe during this turmoil in Beijing I will lose them. I love them so much and 
hope thatthey will be engineers, Ph.D.'s. However, I have no control over what 
will happen. They choose the road they want to walk along. I think that if I 
were a university student now, I would forsure participate in this patriotic 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
Beijing's use of force to suppress the students will cause more students and 
citizens nationwide to fight for democracy. Many people from different cities 
have resumed their demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
I think it won't take long; you will hear gunfire start in Shanghai, Chengdu, 
etc. Maybe there will be thousands of students falling. But the movement 
fighting for democracy and freedom will never end. We can find the proof from 
the Beijing example: Despite the bloody suppression, 10,000-20,000 people still 
fight the army every day. If there is a silence now, the effect will be louder 
than thunder! 
</P>
<P>
I don't think countries worldwide would allow China's bloody massacre to 
continue. There will be denunciations, political and economic moves and even 
the use of force to stop it. We live in this age, people all over the world 
will not allow such a massacre to occur. It is a black mark on the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
China's People's Liberation Army became a Fascist army. The Chinese government 
now becomes a Fascist government. But I think people from all over the world 
will show more respect for the Chinese people. Long live the students! Long 
live the people! 
</P>
<P>
If the current situation continues, I would participate in this movement. If my 
young son can do so, why can't I? 
</P>
<P>
 Life is precious, 
</P>
<P>
 Love is even more precious, 
</P>
<P>
 Fight for freedom, 
</P>
<P>
 Both of them can be sacrificed! 
</P>
<P>
 If the day comes, I will leave you, please don't forget me.

CHINA MILITARY DIVIDED BY REGIONAL, ETHNIC RIVALRIES

The deep divisions that have torn the Chinese military in the wake of the 
student democracy movement stem from personal, regional and ethnic rivalries, 
some dating to the early days of the Chinese revolution, according to American 
analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly what is transpiring in China remains uncertain. But it is the consensus 
of U.S. government and private experts that the People's Liberation Army, which 
has long considered itself the vanguard of the revolution, is split by 
conflicting loyalties and may be preparing to do battle with itself. Already, 
there have been reports of clashes in the capital's outskirts. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. intelligence sources estimate that as many as 350,000 Chinese troops from 
half a dozen military units have converged on Beijing with unknown intentions. 
More continue to arrive hourly, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Government analysts here believe that China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, 
ordered the crackdown but has been unable to oversee its execution. American 
intelligence officials believe the 84-year-old Deng is incapacitated and 
hospitalized with prostate cancer, and some accounts have even reported his 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Some older military commanders and senior political leaders remain fiercely 
loyal to Deng, most U.S. experts agree, and those loyalists wholeheartedly 
agreed with his reported decision to crack down hard on the pro-democracy 
student demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a stunning collapse of military discipline, younger mid-level 
military officers and thousands of conscripts from China's major cities 
sympathize with the students and have refused to carry out orders to move 
against student demonstrators. Analysts said these more liberal elements in the 
People's Liberation Army have supporters in the military high command, who 
publicly pleaded with Deng to refrain from using troops against civilians. 
</P>
<P>
The two camps reflect current political tensions between hard-liners and 
reformers, in the view of Western analysts. And they mirror conflicts between 
city and countryside and between powerful families that wield power even in the 
supposedly egalitarian Chinese Communist system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Echoes of Warlord Era 
</P>
<P>
"It has the flavor of the old warlord era of the '20s and '30s," one senior 
Pentagon official said. "It's a matrix of relationships, with no clear winners 
or losers. Into this mix falls the army, and it is the army that is ultimately 
going to decide the issue." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, China has many armies, not one. Symbolizing their divisions, the 27th 
Army was brought in from the Mongolian border to crush the largely peaceful 
student rebellion in Tian An Men Square last weekend after the locally based 
38th Army apparently disobeyed orders to suppress the demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
The 38th, a conscript force from the Beijing area, identifies with the 
aspirations of the students, according to U.S. authorities, and it is commanded 
by a friend and ally of the apparently ousted party general secretary and 
reformist Zhao Ziyang. Its troops train in the summer alongside young 
reservists from Beijing's universities, and many of its members have personal 
and family ties to the demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
The 27th, by contrast, is based northwest of the capital and is largely staffed 
with less-sophisticated draftees from outlying farms and villages. It is 
commanded by Yang She, the nephew of President Yang Shangkun. The president 
also serves as permanent vice chairman of the Communist Party's Central 
Military Commission and is in effect the day-to-day commander of China's 
3.2-million-member armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
The senior Yang is, like Deng, a veteran of the Chinese revolutionaries' Long 
March of the mid-1930s, in which Chinese Communists retreated about 6,000 miles 
before Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist forces and harassing local warlords. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. intelligence source, describing the 27th Army as "the villain of the 
piece," said that half of the peasant conscripts are illiterate and that the 
unit has a reputation for ruthlessness. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids came from the Mongolian border area and have been in a position of 
relative isolation from what's happening elsewhere in the country," said 
another expert, Larry A. Niksch, an Asian affairs specialist at the 
Congressional Research Service. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the command and control is much tighter among these units than 
among city-based troops. I have no doubt that members of these units were told 
things as to why they were going into Beijing that were false." 
</P>
<P>
He said the soldiers were probably told that the students were foreign-inspired 
counterrevolutionaries who had been killing and looting throughout the capital. 
The troops had never been trained in riot control or crowd control and were 
given orders to fire at will, Niksch said. 
</P>
<P>
A Chinese army, equivalent to a corps in a Western army, is made up of three 
divisions, about 40,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
Elements of several other PLA units have recently arrived by road and air in 
the Beijing area, U.S. officials said. The elite 15th Airborne Division from 
Wuhan aided in the bloody weekend assault on Tian An Men Square, as did the 
65th Army and the 6th Tank Division, U.S. sources reported. 
</P>
<P>
Also sighted in and around the capital were units of the Tianjin-based 66th 
Army, the 39th Army from Shenyang and the 16th Army, which is based north of 
the capital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loyalties Undetermined 
</P>
<P>
The loyalties of the 66th, the 39th and the 16th could not be established, but 
there were unconfirmed reports of sporadic gunfire in the western part of 
Beijing between platoon-sized units of the 16th and 27th armies. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the persistent reports of internecine PLA warfare, U.S. analysts are 
not now predicting an armed insurrection. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point we don't see units rebelling against authority to the point 
there would be a full-scale civil war," said a U.S. government source who asked 
not to be identified. "The hard-liners have the edge all the way. The moderates 
simply don't have the support of the military, and they have no levers on 
power." 
</P>
<P>
Although China's military has undergone a massive 10-year reorganization 
designed to sweep away old loyalties and personal animosities, ancient 
rivalries remain, according to June Teufel Dreyer, a University of Miami expert 
on China's military. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of years ago they decided that the field armies were too much the 
focus of personal loyalties," Dreyer said. "They abandoned them and put in 
place group armies, which they said were more suited to a professional 
military. All this was a code word for destroying personal networks, but you 
don't do that by changing names. It takes time." 
</P>
<P>
The hard-line 27th Army is descended from the Third Field Army, which was based 
in Nanjing and was called into Beijing in 1971 to put down an attempted coup 
against Mao Tse-tung by Lin Piao and his 4th Field Army. Today's rebellious 
38th Army is a direct descendant of Lin's 4th Field Army, Dreyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"We may be seeing a replay of a historic antagonism," she said. "The Chinese 
are good at bearing grudges." 
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Yang Shangkun, China's second-ranking military leader, 
and his nephew, Yang She, commander of the 27th Army, is only part of the 
family network that some Chinese ironically refer to as the "Yang Family 
Village." 
</P>
<P>
Yang Shangkun's brother, Yang Baibing, is director of the army's political 
department, and his son-in-law, Chi Haotian, is chief of the general staff. All 
are intensely loyal to Deng, Western analysts say, but may be preparing to take 
over the government when Deng falls from power or dies. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why all the guns are now trained outward" from Beijing, theorized 
Thomas W. Robinson, director of the China Studies Program at the American 
Enterprise Institute in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"They're sending a signal to other military commanders: 'This place is secured; 
don't mess. We military commanders are going to pull the situation together. 
We're not going to have warlordism, we're not going to have a Cultural 
Revolution, we're going to put the country back together and put in place 
essentially a military government.' " 
</P>
<P>
But even if the brutal repression achieves its end, it comes at a very high 
price for the Chinese military, which prides itself on its recent progress 
toward professionalism as well as its faithfulness to its revolutionary past. 
</P>
<P>
Paul H. B. Godwin, professor of national security policy at the National War 
College in Washington, said the excessive violence that quelled the 
demonstrations only served to aggravate existing divisions within the army. 
</P>
<P>
"By attacking its own citizens, you have forced the army to violate the core of 
its military ethic," Godwin said. "You've eroded one of the principal 
objectives of a decade of military reform." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TROOPS CONVERGE ON BEIJING 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Troops occupying central Beijing after crushing demonstrations: 27th Army, 
and units of 15th Airborne Division (from Wuhan), 85th Army (from northwest of

SOLIDARITY OFFERS REPRIEVE FOR REGIME'S ELECTION LOSS

<P>
The Solidarity trade union, flushed with its election victory over Poland's 
ruling Communist coalition, said Tuesday that it is willing to allow the 
government to restore or replace a special list of its candidates sent down to 
defeat by an angry electorate. 
</P>
<P>
But the union leadership stood firm on its refusal to enter into a coalition 
government with the Communists, arguing that Solidarity had competed in 
national elections as an opposition party and could not surrender that role. 
</P>
<P>
The official tallies from Sunday's voting were still not completed, but the 
government and a spokesman for the Communist Party coalition acknowledged that 
their ticket had been overwhelmingly beaten by Solidarity-backed candidates for 
the Sejm, or Parliament, and a newly constituted Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached by the government and Solidarity in April, the 
Communist coalition was supposed to control 65%, or 299 seats, of the 
460-member Sejm, with 35% of the seats open to be contested by opposition 
candidates. In the Senate, all 100 seats were open to competitors from all 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
It seems likely that Solidarity will win more than 90, and perhaps all 100, of 
the seats in the Senate, and about 150 of the 161 seats open to its candidates 
in the Sejm. 
</P>
<P>
Those results, although a bigger landslide that even Solidarity's most avid 
supporters predicted, cannot be viewed as an upset. But the failure of the 
government's so-called national list of 35 unopposed candidates, most of them 
major party and government figures, was a genuine shock to the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The embarrassment from the government and Communist Party side was evident, as 
the party Politburo met in an extra-long session and the government's press 
spokesman evaded key questions about the government's next step. 
</P>
<P>
Among those on the national list were Premier Mieczyslaw Rakowski, Minister of 
Internal Affairs Czeslaw Kiszczak and veteran Politburo member Jozef Czyrek, 
who was among those who had pushed through the idea of holding talks with 
Solidarity. Although all were running without competition, they had to be 
approved by 50% of the voters in order to win election to the Parliament. 
Unofficial returns, so far not disputed by the government, indicate that all 35 
had been rejected. 
</P>
<P>
The key issue now, for Solidarity as much as for the government, is how to 
replace the rejected 35 officials so that the balance agreed upon earlier can 
be achieved. 
</P>
<P>
While the embarrassment is most acute for the Communist side, it is also a 
sticky issue for Solidarity, which had counted on working with those officials 
-- most of them regarded as the regime's most reform-oriented liberals -- in 
the new national assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"This problem can be solved according to the law," Bronislaw Geremek, 
Solidarity's key strategist, said Tuesday. "This means we are ready to accept 
any solution which will conform to the round-table agreement. This means a 
(Communist) coalition participation in the Sejm of 65%." 
</P>
<P>
Repeatedly pressed by reporters to suggest a formula by which the government 
might replace the 35 candidates, Geremek replied: "It's not our problem." 
</P>
<P>
Pressed on the same issue, deputy government press spokesman Zbyslaw Rakowski 
answered, "It is being discussed," but he would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Rakowski did question whether the election results really represented the "will 
of the people." 
</P>
<P>
"The decisions of the individual voters were guided above all by emotions," he 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
Bogdan Borusewicz, a Solidarity leader in the port of Gdansk, cautioned Poles 
against overconfidence. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to remember that police, army and Communist propaganda remain in the 
same hands," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And Solidarity adviser Adam Michnik noted that the Soviet Union and China, both 
run by apparently reform-minded regimes, recently had resorted to violence when 
people demanded too much freedom. He cited the deadly military crackdown in 
Beijing as well as the use of chemical gas against demonstrators in the Soviet 
republic of Georgia earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The firing at people and death victims . . . indicated what kind of dangers we 
should avoid," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyskiewicz acknowledged that some of the union's 
supporters would be angry with any solution that allowed the national list 
candidates to be chosen for Parliament after their clear rejection by the 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
"But it should be noted," he said, "that people who voted for Solidarity voted 
for the Solidarity platform, and that platform included our pledge to the 
round-table agreement." 
</P>
<P>
Onyskiewicz admitted that the union is worried by the election's overwhelming 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"It is too good a result for us," he said. "What worries us is that we counted 
on our reform program to be negotiated in Parliament. But if the leading 
members of the government side from the round-table talks are not in 
Parliament, we may be forced to conduct our negotiations outside." 
</P>
<P>
Onyskiewicz's concern is a recognition of the divisions inside the ruling 
party, where hard-liners and the party's vast nomenclatura apparatus oppose the 
kind of political and economic reforms engineered by the present leadership. 
The fear, among both the opposition forces and the party liberals, is that the 
humiliating defeat in an open election could lead to a party backlash. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, as Onyskiewicz suggested, Solidarity would prefer that the government 
find some face-saving way of slipping the national list officials into the 
Sejm, rather than risk having to deal with another, more stubborn lineup of 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Political observers noted that it is in the interests of both Solidarity and 
the government to solve the national list issue as gracefully as possible to 
avoid a paralyzing deadlock in the new national assembly, where some solutions 
must be found for Poland's ever-mounting economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Solidarity refuses to join the government at the ministerial level, 
both sides will be forced to cooperate in the national assembly, where a vote 
of the Solidarity-controlled Senate can veto legislation passed by the Sejm. 
</P>
<P>
Such a veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority of the Sejm. But even 
with a 65% majority in the Sejm, the Communist Party and its allies would need 
at least eight Solidarity votes in the Sejm to override a Senate veto.

SP'S NEW OPTIMISM DERAILED

SAN BERNARDINO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like his brethren on the railroad, engineer Albin Szulc was shaken when he got 
word one May morning that a Southern Pacific freight train had derailed here, 
killing four people. But he was by no means surprised. 
</P>
<P>
Szulc, 42, can only theorize about why the ill-fated freight became a runaway 
and jumped the tracks at the foot of the steep Cajon Pass grade. But he is sure 
that conditions dangerously ripe for such wrecks have dogged the railroad for 
half a decade. 
</P>
<P>
A Southern Pacific employee since 1971, Szulc says spotty maintenance, 
insufficient training and plummeting morale have turned the once mighty 
railroad into a carrier derisively dubbed "Surely Pathetic" by some industry 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confirms Suspicion 
</P>
<P>
"This (accident) just confirmed my suspicion that if we don't do something 
about these problems, we're in for trouble," Szulc said. "They run trains with 
equipment that doesn't function properly . . . and there is no consistent, 
repeated follow-up training to ensure these engineers are proficient at their 
job." 
</P>
<P>
While no firm answers have yet emerged to questions about how the 69-car train 
got away from its crew while descending the treacherous grade into San 
Bernardino, evidence unearthed so far mirrors concerns voiced by many railroad 
employees as well as outsiders who track the freight line. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Pacific, these critics say, is a railroad plagued by problems. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of interviews, veteran Southern Pacific employees, industry 
analysts and transportation consultants agreed that the derailment was merely 
the latest wound suffered by a railroad beset in recent years by financial 
losses, a tainted maintenance record and a sagging spirit among workers. 
</P>
<P>
"Since 1983, (Southern Pacific) has operated like a disabled ship," concluded 
Isabel Benham, a New York railroad consultant, in a report last year on the 
carrier's financial woes. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the San Bernardino wreck -- one of the most destructive train 
disasters in recent history -- comes as Southern Pacific is embarking on a 
course designed to polish its sullied image and retrieve the respect and 
business that have ebbed away in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Purchased in October by Denver-based Rio Grande Industries Inc., Southern 
Pacific has pledged to improve service to disgruntled shippers, expand and 
modernize its oft-maligned fleet of locomotives and sweeten unusually bitter 
relations between management and workers. 
</P>
<P>
Railroad spokesmen staunchly deny that even at its darkest days Southern 
Pacific ever allowed maintenance to deteriorate to a point where safety was at 
stake, and they point with pride to recent changes. 
</P>
<P>
In just eight months, many employees say, Southern Pacific has become an 
entirely new place to work, and optimism had been running deep -- until May 12. 
</P>
<P>
On that day, the freight train bound for Long Beach derailed, leaving crewmen 
Everett Crown and Alan Riess crushed in a fist of mangled steel. Their deaths, 
colleagues say, provided an ugly reminder that problems remain. 
</P>
<P>
"It was sort of like a sock in the stomach," one veteran trainman said of the 
crash. "Things were looking brighter and everyone was feeling so much better 
and then, pow!" 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s have not been kind to the Southern Pacific Transportation Co. Once 
the acknowledged king of the rails in the West, Southern Pacific saw its star 
tumble in this decade, a period marked by mounting competition and uncertainty 
over the freight line's corporate fate. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many other large railroads, which can count on a steady cargo like coal, 
Southern Pacific's traffic base has proven more vulnerable to economic slumps 
and competition from trucking, analysts say. Lumber, for example, is a major 
product hauled on its routes out of the Pacific Northwest, and the carrier is 
thus at risk during dips in construction. 
</P>
<P>
"The railroads that do well have reliable, profitable traffic like coal and 
concentrate it heavily along certain routes," said Theodore E. Keeler, a UC 
Berkeley economist who wrote a book about the railroad industry for the 
Brookings Institution. "Southern Pacific just hasn't had as many of the 
profitable routes and commodities as some of its competitors." 
</P>
<P>
Compounding these troubles has been an extended bureaucratic stalemate over the 
railroad's ownership. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Southern Pacific's corporate parent merged with the owner of the 
Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway. The newly formed Santa Fe Southern 
Pacific Corp. then sought to merge its rail lines, but that bid was rejected in 
1986 by the Interstate Commerce Commission, which concluded that the 
combination would be "anti-competitive." A subsequent appeal also was denied, 
and the ICC ultimately ordered that one of the two railroads be sold. 
</P>
<P>
It was a painful period for Southern Pacific: "There was tremendous 
demoralization among employees. It was almost debilitating," company spokesman 
Jerry Pera said. 
</P>
<P>
With its future uncertain, Southern Pacific had little motivation to expand, 
modernize or innovate, and the railroad's financial performance was 
"lackluster" at best, said Benham, the New York consultant. In the three years 
that the merger effort was afoot, Southern Pacific lost about 10% of its 
revenues -- or $200 million -- annually. 
</P>
<P>
To survive the tough times, the railroad launched a massive cost-cutting 
program. Miles and miles of track were closed, hundreds of freight cars and 
locomotives were retired, and 5,000 jobs were cut through early retirement and 
an employee buyout plan that offered workers a one-time payment to leave. 
</P>
<P>
The railroad also shut down the bulk of its outlying maintenance yards, 
consolidating repair work at four major facilities -- Roseville and Colton in 
California, Houston and Pine Bluff, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
Pera said the move represented a "centralization effort" permitted because of 
the greater efficiency of today's locomotives: "They don't need attention every 
300 miles like they used to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But many engineers disagree, saying the powerful machines they pilot are 
frequently in disrepair because they do not receive the consistent mechanical 
care they once did. 
</P>
<P>
"In the maintenance area, they just cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, and we feel it," 
said Indio engineer Ray Brown, a Southern Pacific employee since 1961. "Twice 
in one month recently, they sent me power (locomotives) that I rejected because 
they had no brakes or some other kind of mechanical malfunction." 
</P>
<P>
Bennie Loudermilk, a Bakersfield engineer since 1981, said locomotives used to 
be checked "on a daily basis by pipe fitters, electricians and machinists. Then 
they closed the roundhouse (maintenance yard) in Bakersfield, and now they just 
let the equipment run down until someone complains." 
</P>
<P>
It is not at all uncommon, Szulc noted, for an engineer to handle trains that 
lack a full complement of dynamic brakes, which are used along with an air 
pressure braking system to control speed. This was one of the problems 
investigators say may have contributed to the May 12 derailment. 
</P>
<P>
Other engineers say they often are asked to run locomotives that lack working 
speedometers. 
</P>
<P>
"You just don't figure on having all your equipment functioning," Szulc said. 
"That's the norm and a responsible engineer just operates the train 
accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
Under such conditions, engineers say they must essentially double as mechanics, 
remaining constantly on the lookout for problems, and in some cases fixing 
things themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I changed my own brake shoes the other day," said one Los Angeles-area 
engineer who, like many others interviewed, asked not to be named. "I could get 
fired for doing that. But I knew if I waited for a mechanic, I would've needed 
rock salt because the city would have frozen over." 
</P>
<P>
Loudermilk, 34, said he and fellow engineers keep a close eye on the service 
department because of their belief that shoddy maintenance decreases their 
chances of climbing safely from the cab at the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
"One time, I wrote up a work report on a bad locomotive I took to Colton and I 
kept a copy for myself," said Loudermilk, who serves as secretary-treasurer of 
the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers' local in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
"The next day, I got the same power with the same problems. I radioed the 
roundhouse and they said if the engineer who brought it in had told them about 
the trouble, they would have taken care of it. Well, you can imagine their 
reaction when I pulled out my work report. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the things you have to do to protect yourself, and I'll tell you, it 
really drives up the stress level." 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Railroad Administration deploys inspectors to ensure compliance 
with its numerous maintenance and operational regulations. But with 327 
officials policing 450 railroads and 220,000 miles of track, many workers say 
the inspectors are spread too thin to make much of a difference. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, although the Federal Railroad Administration visits are supposed to 
be a surprise, engineers say that word somehow gets out, and Southern Pacific 
reacts nimbly, often concealing defective equipment until an inspector departs. 
</P>
<P>
"The FRA (Federal Railroad Administration) can come in and literally shut down 
a terminal, so the company will simply move the bad power around. They hide 
it," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Pacific spokesman Pera could not confirm that such maneuvering occurs, 
but he said it is possible. A superintendent "who feels he could be shut down" 
by an inspector might hold a defective locomotive out of town until a mechanic 
can be sent out to correct the problem, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Pera contends, the company views the Federal Railroad 
Administration as a formidable force that has a major effect on the railroad. 
And over the last five years Southern Pacific has paid more than $1.2 million 
in fines for federal violations. That sum exceeds by $200,000 fines paid during 
the same period by the nation's largest rail line, the Union Pacific Railroad 
Co., which operates 50% more miles of routes than Southern Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation consultants and shippers familiar with Southern Pacific say 
evidence of its decline became readily apparent about five years ago. About the 
same time, jokes about the sorry condition of the company's locomotives became 
popular. 
</P>
<P>
"A favorite was, 'Here comes an SP train. Let's see, it's got 10 locomotives, 
so it must have actually needed four," said one Southern California consultant 
who has done work for the railroad and asked to remain anonymous. "They always 
had a lot of dead junk sitting around. And the equipment just never shined like 
the Santa Fe's does." 
</P>
<P>
Southern Pacific hotly disputes that mechanical service has lapsed during the 
rocky decade. Deferred maintenance "is a practice that's been around since 
1864. But did we put off maintenance to the detriment of a safe railroad? 
Certainly not," said Robert Taggert, vice president for public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Pera noted that Southern Pacific recently won the E. H. Harriman Memorial Award 
for employee safety for the third year in a row. The award is based on the 
ratio of employee injuries per miles traveled. 
</P>
<P>
And William Loftus, executive director of the Federal Railroad Administration 
in Washington, said Southern Pacific is "no better or worse" than competing 
railroads in terms of the frequency of accidents and casualties. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing extraordinary about their record," Loftus said, although in 
1987 -- the most recent year for which figures were available -- the company's 
proportion of equipment and mechanical failures was a bit higher than the 
industry average. 
</P>
<P>
But Federal Railroad Administration safety records have been called into 
question by government investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that "FRA uses injury and accident reports submitted by the railroads," 
a Government Accounting Office report published in April said the agency "has 
little assurance that its injury and accident data is reliable" because of 
inaccuracies or gaps in the information submitted by the railroads. 
</P>
<P>
While they are defensive of their company's performance, even Southern Pacific 
officials concede that life at that railroad has changed dramatically since its 
purchase eight months ago by Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz. 
</P>
<P>
Anschutz, using wealth amassed in the oil business, bought Southern Pacific for 
$1.8 billion and merged it with his tiny line, the Denver &amp; Rio Grande 
Western Railroad Co. The combined carrier, Southern Pacific Lines, became the 
nation's fifth-largest railroad with service in 15 states and 15,000 miles of 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, Southern Pacific took on a new look and feel. 
</P>
<P>
An aggressive marketing campaign, using the slogan "The Spirit That Won the 
West," was launched to woo back customers alienated by the unreliability that 
many say plagued the line in recent years. Shippers across the country were 
entertained by Anschutz himself on a special train pulled by a steam locomotive 
to celebratory events. 
</P>
<P>
To win back inter-city business seized by truckers, the railroad introduced a 
new group of trains noted for their punctuality and attractive freight price. 
And a prominent stretch of track between Oregon and Nevada was reopened, 
offering expanded service. 
</P>
<P>
"This company has undergone a 180-degree change for the better," Taggart said. 
"Philip Anschutz has completely turned us around." 
</P>
<P>
Those who run the trains -- bitter after years under what many described as a 
ruthless us-against-them managerial policy -- quickly became swept up in the 
excitement, relieved to finally be rescued from limbo. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like we suddenly had a home," said engineer Ronnie Lee, who travels 
routes between Bakersfield and Roseville. "Morale shot up, maintenance improved 
too. And this man Anschutz really seems to care. I hear he just shows up at 
different facilities and talks one on one with the men. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all holding our heads a little higher. . . . And then we lost Alan and 
Everett." 
</P>
<P>
When engineer Frank Holland crested the 4,200-foot Cajon Pass grade around 8 
a.m. on May 12, preparing his train for the long ride down into San Bernardino, 
his speed was a whisker under 30 m.p.h. -- just about right for the 6,100 tons 
he was told he was pulling. 
</P>
<P>
Holland, an engineer since 1986, was undoubtedly tired, having started his 
shift 11 hours earlier. But as a relative newcomer to the steep hill, he most 
likely was on the edge of his seat in the train's small, noisy cab. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, Holland knew something was wrong: His train was picking up speed, 
and he lacked the braking power to slow it. 
</P>
<P>
About halfway down the 27-mile descent, the "helper engineer" near the rear of 
the train engaged the emergency brakes. But it was no use. The freight was a 
runaway, careening at 90 m.p.h. down the mountainside. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the lead locomotive entered the fateful bend where the train 
would derail, Holland turned to his conductor: "We're going to die on that 
curve," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, Holland climbed from a pile of grotesquely twisted steel -- 
alive but with a collapsed lung and broken bones. Conductor Everett Crown and 
brakeman Alan Riess were not so lucky, and two children in one of several homes 
flattened by the runaway also were killed. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board is months away from revealing what 
caused the freight to barrel out of control and jump the tracks. But evidence 
collected so far shows the train weighed nearly 3,000 tons more than its crew 
was told, a factor that could be key because engineers base their speed and 
braking calculations on weight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Missing Braking Power 
</P>
<P>
In addition, tests show that because only three of his six locomotives had 
working dynamic brakes, Holland had just half the braking power needed to 
control the train at 30 m.p.h. And the NTSB is studying why Holland was unaware 
that he could make a certain maneuver that might have slowed the train or 
caused it to derail before reaching populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Pacific officials have wasted no time responding to the wreck. A 
flurry of new safety orders have been issued to employees, emphasizing rules 
governing braking, communication among crewmen and other aspects of train 
handling. In some districts, company officials have attended meetings with 
union leaders and members concerned about the accident and ongoing safety 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
But many workers insist that the railroad needs to do more, and one area 
criticized heavily is training. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, an engineer in training takes 60 rides on a locomotive as an 
observer before completing a three-week program of classroom work and practice 
on a simulator, a device that replicates the behavior of a locomotive to test a 
student's handling skills. If they pass, beginners then are accompanied in the 
field by an instructor until he determines they are qualified. 
</P>
<P>
While Brown says the simulator and certification process provide "a good 
foundation," he and others lament that there is virtually no follow-up training 
designed to ensure that engineers remain adept at maneuvering their powerful 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials maintain that their program of "efficiency testing" -- in 
which officers secretly monitor engineers for compliance with signals, speed 
limits and other rules -- keeps workers abreast of the rules. But some 
employees disagree, saying that function, while necessary, is disciplinarian in 
nature and does not address the need for refresher training. 
</P>
<P>
"When these young guys come out of that simulator with a score of 98, they're 
all puffed up, thinking they know everything," Brown said. "Well, they don't. 
And our equipment is constantly changing. We need a standardized program to 
keep people sharp." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Brown and Szulc designed just such a program and deployed it on routes 
between Colton and Yuma between 1985 and 1987. Its creators say the program 
produced reductions in accidents and better compliance with the rules. But 
Brown and Szulc said the program was killed by union leaders, in part because 
of fears that information gathered during training sessions might be turned 
over to company officials for disciplinary use. 
</P>
<P>
As the introspection that accompanies a tragedy continues among those who knew 
and worked with Crown and Riess, one feeling seems to surface most often. Bob 
Ricou, an engineer for 17 years, put it this way. 
</P>
<P>
"This wreck is something that will live in the memory of all us forever. The 
important thing now is to get these problems corrected so that these men didn't 
die in vain."

TURNOUT FOR L.A. ELECTION HEADING FOR RECORD LOW

<P>
Los Angeles headed for a new low in the turnout of voters Tuesday as only a 
fraction of the electorate trickled to polls to cast ballots in races for the 
City Council, Board of Education and Community Colleges Board. 
</P>
<P>
As of 5 p.m., with just three hours till poll closing, an estimated 5.4% of the 
city's 1.8 million registered voters had cast their ballots, compared to 12.9% 
by that time in 1985 and 18.2% in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The voter turnout varied from precinct to precinct. The only issue on the 
ballot citywide was the election of two new members to the Los Angeles 
Community College District Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's why people are predicting a much lower turnout, because there 
are no major citywide issues like a mayor's race," said Mike Carey, the city 
clerk's executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
Among other contests to be decided were a runoff in the city's 7th Councilmanic 
District, two seats on the Los Angeles Board of Education, a mayoral race in 
Compton, council and school board seats in Inglewood and school finance issues. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, voters were to decide a cityhood proposal for the community 
of Laguna Hills, about 50 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Voter turnout was not estimated by election officials in Orange and Los Angeles 
counties, election officials said. 
</P>
<P>
About 3.6 million voters are registered in Los Angeles County, and about 29,700 
Orange County voters were eligible to vote on the Laguna Hills cityhood issue. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles' 7th Councilmanic District, officials with challenger Lyle 
Hall's campaign openly worried that voter apathy would derail their 
union-backed get-out-the-vote efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"We have predicted 12% and prayed that it would not be 8%," said Bobi Johnson, 
a Hall spokeswoman. "We're faced with a 6 p.m. poll closing, in effect, because 
people are going to go home to watch the Lakers' first playoff game." 
</P>
<P>
Hall, 49, a city fire captain and former firefighters union president, is 
challenging incumbent Ernani Bernardi, 77, an irascible, 28-year council 
veteran, to represent the northeastern San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Hall forced Bernardi into a runoff after Bernardi failed to win a majority in 
the April 11 primary election. Bernardi gathered support from minority leaders, 
while Hall obtained endorsements from several prominent Democrats, including 
former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., now state Democratic Party chairman. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles school board race, challenger Jerry Horowitz, a 56-year-old 
junior high school principal, sought to unseat incumbent Julie Korenstein, 45, 
who had strong backing from the teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
United Teachers-Los Angeles also supported challenger Mark Slavkin, 27, an aide 
to county Supervisor Ed Edelman, in a bid to unseat incumbent Alan Gershman, 
49. 
</P>
<P>
In the race for the Community College Board, candidates Rose Ochi and Althea 
Baker received financial and staff support from the American Federation of 
Teachers College Guild and Democratic Party regulars. 
</P>
<P>
None of the four candidates competing for the two open seats was an incumbent. 
The board oversees operations concerning the district's nine campuses and 
105,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
Ochi, 54, an aide to Mayor Tom Bradley, was running against Pat Owens, 54, an 
auto shop teacher and student recruiter at Trade-Tech College. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, 39, a union organizer and Mission College counselor, faced Patricia 
Hollingsworth, 42, a language arts professor at Trade-Tech who nearly beat 
Wallace Knox in a 1987 board runoff. 
</P>
<P>
A ballot measure before voters in Orange County would create the city of Laguna 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
In Compton, incumbent Mayor Walter Tucker, 64, a dentist, was running for 
reelection against challenger Everson Esters, 37, who describes himself as a 
political consultant and entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in Compton, a city of more than 81,000 about 11 miles south of downtown 
Los Angeles, also cast ballots in the 3rd Councilmanic District. Incumbent 
Robert Adams, 57, a mortician, faced Bernice Woods, a member of the Compton 
Board of Education. Former City Councilman Floyd Jones, 47, was waging a 
write-in campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In Inglewood, Thomasina Reed was challenging a dead woman -- Caroline Coleman 
-- for a seat on the school board. Incumbent Coleman was forced into a runoff 
in the spring primary but died before the runoff. Her supporters campaigned 
hard for her in hopes of forcing another election. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood voters were also to choose two members of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
A special tax election, Measure A, was on ballots in South Pasadena. Voters 
were asked to authorize a tax of $98 or less on every parcel of land for each 
of the next five years. Proceeds would by used to improve education in the 
South Pasadena Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
In Lancaster, a bond issue, Measure K, was placed on ballots for voters in the 
Westside Union School District. Voters were asked to approve a bonded 
indebtedness of $8.5 million, at a rate not exceeding 12% annually, to raise 
funding for the renovation and construction of new school buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Both the South Pasadena and the Lancaster measures required a two-thirds 
majority for approval.

ASSEMBLY NARROWLY OKS 15-DAY WAIT ON ALL GUN PURCHASES 
</P>

<P>
Legislation supported by Gov. George Deukmejian to extend the 15-day waiting 
period for handgun purchases to all firearms -- including hunting rifles and 
shotguns -- was narrowly passed by the Assembly on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, aimed at making it tougher for criminals and the mentally disturbed 
to legally buy a gun, is widely regarded as at least as significant and perhaps 
more so than the ban on military-style assault weapons enacted last month. 
</P>
<P>
For the National Rifle Assn., whose usually influential lobbying operation was 
left in disarray by the beating it took over the assault-gun ban, approval of 
the waiting-period measure represented a second consecutive thumping. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the bill by Assemblyman Lloyd G. Connelly (D-Sacramento) argued that 
if the measure had been law it would have stopped Stockton schoolyard murderer 
Patrick Purdy from obtaining the many firearms he legally purchased before his 
Jan. 17 killing foray. Opponents claimed that it would not have affected Purdy, 
a deranged misfit. 
</P>
<P>
Passage of the bill occurred over the opposition of Republicans who 
unsuccessfully argued for a telephone hot line and computerized background 
check within the state Department of Justice. They contended that this would 
eliminate the need for any waiting period and allow immediate sale of guns to 
legal purchasers. 
</P>
<P>
But Connelly and his backers argued that the Department of Justice would be 
financially and technically unable to hook up such a system within the next 18 
months as demanded by Republicans. Even if installed, the high-tech system 
would fail to identify thousands of illegal purchasers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On a 43-21 vote, two more than the simple majority, the bill was sent to the 
Senate, where its prospects for approval are considered favorable in a newly 
energized anti-gun political climate. 
</P>
<P>
The NRA and other gun-owner organizations staked out the Assembly as the 
central battleground over gun-control legislation this year, largely because 
its members must run for reelection every two years and are considered more 
vulnerable to lobbying on the politically sensitive issue than are senators. 
</P>
<P>
For the last 15 years, purchasers of handguns have had to wait for 15 days 
until they take possession of the firearm. This indirect form of gun 
registration enables the state Department of Justice to check into the buyer's 
background to determine whether he or she is prohibited from purchasing a 
pistol or revolver because of a felony record or because the prospective buyer 
has been found by a court to be mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
When he came out for banning assault weapons last winter, Deukmejian also 
called for extending the 15-day waiting period to the sale of long guns -- 
rifles and shotguns -- as a way of helping to keep firearms out of the hands of 
criminals and the mentally unbalanced. 
</P>
<P>
However, opponents of the extension maintain that it would merely inconvenience 
the law-abiding gun purchaser and would not deter criminals who, they argue, 
seldom legally buy firearms anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Connelly, who unsuccessfully carried a similar bill last session, told the 
Assembly that in the view of some law enforcement officials "this is the second 
most important, if indeed not the most important, weapons-control bill that 
will be considered this year." 
</P>
<P>
Citing figures compiled by the Department of Justice, Connelly noted that last 
year the agency made almost 300,000 handgun background checks. The department 
estimates that extending the wait requirement to long guns would add another 1 
million purchasers to be investigated. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the bill also would: 
</P>
<P>
* Make ineligible to purchase a gun for five years anyone involuntarily held 
for a 72-hour psychiatric evaluation. A record of the detention would be sent 
to the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
* Prohibit ownership of any firearm by a felon. Under current state law, felons 
are prohibited only from possessing handguns. Federal law prohibits them from 
possessing any gun. 
</P>
<P>
* Require that private sales of guns be handled through a licensed dealer and 
that the sale be subject to the 15-day wait and a background check by the 
department. Such a restriction currently applies to private handgun sales, but 
critics contend that the law is virtually ignored, especially at gun shows and 
swap meets. 
</P>
<P>
* Make it either a misdemeanor or a felony on the first offense to transfer a 
firearm to someone not legally qualified to possess it, punishable by a fine of 
$1,000 and a year in jail or a $10,000 fine and up to three years in state 
prison.

HIGH COURT ACTS TO SPEED ITS REVIEW OF CAPITAL CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over objections from two justices, the state Supreme Court on Tuesday issued 
new procedural rules designed to speed the review of death-penalty cases. 
</P>
<P>
The new standards require defense attorneys to ensure that habeas corpus 
petitions -- in which condemned prisoners raise new issues that go beyond 
claims in their direct appeals to the court -- are filed "without substantial 
delay." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, these secondary appeals, which raise such issues as inadequate trial 
counsel or newly discovered evidence, ordinarily have not been filed until 
after the defendant's direct appeal has been decided by the high court. Under 
the new rules, both such appeals ordinarily will have to be filed at virtually 
the same time, enabling the justices to consolidate their review of the 
appeals. 
</P>
<P>
The rules, announced in a statement by Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, were 
issued in the wake of widespread concern among legal authorities over delay and 
uncertainty in the review of capital appeals. Lucas is co-chairman of an 
American Bar Assn. task force studying the problem in both state and federal 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
However, Justices Stanley Mosk and Allen E. Broussard, two liberals on a 
conservative-dominated high court, dissented from the rules "on various 
grounds," Tuesday's cryptically worded statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Mosk, it said, "particularly opposed" provisions that would impose new time 
standards requiring that, with some exceptions, habeas corpus petitions must be 
filed within 60 days after final briefs are due in the defendant's direct 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Broussard "primarily objected" to applying the new standards to pending cases, 
Lucas' statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The new regulations also drew sharp criticism from Michael D. Laurence, 
director of the Death Penalty Project of American Civil Liberties Union of 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Laurence warned that requiring defense attorneys to investigate cases and 
prepare briefs in direct appeals and habeas appeals at the same time could 
jeopardize the quality of a defendant's legal representation. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a risk that innocent people may be rushed through the system because 
an appellate attorney was rushed through the system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael G. Millman, director of the California Appellate Project, a nonprofit 
group that assists lawyers in capital appeals, said the new standards will be 
"helpful in clarifying the expectations" of defense counsel. 
</P>
<P>
But Millman voiced concern about the fairness of applying to pending cases new 
rules that appear to represent "a significant break" from past procedures. 
</P>
<P>
On a different front, state Deputy Atty. Gen. Dane R. Gillette expressed doubt 
that the new rules would weaken the quality of habeas corpus petitions. And he 
welcomed the new policy as one that would improve the speed and efficiency of 
the whole capital appeal process. 
</P>
<P>
"We're enthusiastic about the new rules," Gillette said. "By combining the 
habeas proceedings with the direct appeal, we can get these cases through the 
state system much more expeditiously. . . . Overall, it will benefit the 
criminal justice system." 
</P>
<P>
The new rules say that habeas corpus petitions that are not filed within 60 
days of final briefs in direct appeals can be denied as "untimely." But the 
court will allow exceptions to the limit when defense counsel can show that 
petitions were filed within a "reasonable time" after they became aware of new 
facts or legal issues about a case. 
</P>
<P>
The rules also require court-appointed counsel to represent condemned prisoners 
all the way through direct and secondary appeals in state and federal court 
and, if necessary, to seek clemency from the governor for an inmate who faces 
imminent execution. 
</P>
<P>
The justices will consider replacing such attorneys "only if appropriate 
replacement counsel is ready and willing" to take over the job, Lucas said in 
the statement.

SOVIET CONGRESS PROVES FREEWHEELING

As the Soviet Union's freewheeling Congress of People's Deputies went into its 
10th day Tuesday, there was no end in sight to the debates that have touched on 
everything from accusations of immorality among Soviet youth to whether V. I. 
Lenin would have wanted his body on display in Red Square. 
</P>
<P>
The 2,250-member congress was originally to have had four days of sessions, 
elect a lawmaking, 542-member Supreme Soviet and then head home for the year, 
duty done. 
</P>
<P>
But only about half of the more than 800 representatives who signed up for a 
chance to speak have had their say so far, and every day deputies not 
previously on the list clamor for an opportunity to get on the soap box in the 
Kremlin's Palace of Congresses. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to end Tuesday's session was a sign of how things have gone -- and 
of how, according to best predictions, they probably will continue to go for 
another week or so. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
She Would Not Wait 
</P>
<P>
As the deputy leading the congress' morning session sought to bring it to an 
end after 2 p.m., a woman from Central Asia rushed to the podium. She yelled 
frantically that she had been trying for several days to have her moment at the 
microphone. 
</P>
<P>
The rotating chairman of the day's session, Anatoly V. Gurbonov of Latvia, told 
her she would be given a chance to speak later, but she would not wait. 
</P>
<P>
She had a pile of telegrams from several dozen of her constituents outraged by 
a verbal attack last week against human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov for 
his denunciation of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and his airing 
of allegations of Soviet atrocities committed there. 
</P>
<P>
She wanted to read them all. 
</P>
<P>
As she tried to speak, a shrill buzzer sounded insistently and repeatedly, 
signaling her to sit down. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev Sat Watching 
</P>
<P>
"Dear colleague, thank you. Now please, please take your seat," said the 
normally imperturbable Gurbonov, on his feet and waving his arms in an effort 
to interrupt her. Finally, reluctantly, the deputy left the podium, clearing 
the way for the session to end. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sat quietly watching his 
experiment in democracy continue to run its course. 
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, Siberian writer Valentin Rasputin made a wandering speech during 
which he spoke for the conservatives on a number of points. Referring to 
Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or permitting greater openness, he said a law 
is needed "to bring glasnost under control." 
</P>
<P>
He blamed Western influences for what he said are falling moral standards among 
Soviet youth. 
</P>
<P>
And he turned the tables on deputies representing various ethnic groups who 
have called on the Russian-dominated state to give them greater rights. 
</P>
<P>
"We Russians understand the feelings and problems of all the ethnic groups. But 
it's time for them to understand us as well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call for Ethnic Rights 
</P>
<P>
There also was a rash of demands Tuesday for congressional study commissions. 
</P>
<P>
One legislator from Estonia called for a commission to draw up a constitutional 
amendment that would give all of the Soviet Union's more than 100 ethnic groups 
broad new rights. 
</P>
<P>
Another legislator from the Volga River city of Gorky called for a commission 
to monitor Soviet government efforts to control industrial pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Mikhail I. Mongo, a representative of the Evenkian autonomous region in eastern 
Siberia, called for still another commission, this one to study how to preserve 
cultural traditions of tribes living in the country's northern regions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nomadic Life Style 
</P>
<P>
The country's 20,000 Evenks were once nomadic and even now subsist primarily by 
breeding reindeer, hunting and fishing, living without many modern 
conveniences. But while they apparently don't mind missing out on washing 
machines and electric can openers, this congress is one new development in 
Soviet society in which they want to be included. 
</P>
<P>
While the topics may sometimes seem tedious, attention in the congress hall 
seldom flags. The novelty of it all alone seems enough to keep the deputies 
glued to their seats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Home for Lenin? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most bizarre demand came last week, when Muscovite Yuri F. Karyakin 
suggested removing Lenin's remains from his tomb in Red Square and burying the 
founder of the state in the city that today bears his name, Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
Karyakin, drawing some audible gasps from the deputies, asserted that that had 
actually been Lenin's last wish.

Gray-haired American veterans, officials and townspeople gathered here Tuesday 
on the 45th anniversary of D-Day to honor the dead and recall the terrors and 
triumphs of history's greatest amphibious landings. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here to remember what was done in this place; we're here to thank the 
living and honor the dead," Secretary of the Army John O. Marsh Jr. told a 
crowd of about 1,000 people gathered around a reflecting pool at the memorial 
in the American military cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
The cemetery contains the remains of 9,386 Americans killed in the assault. 
</P>
<P>
Along a 50-mile stretch of the coast, 180,000 American, British and Canadian 
soldiers stormed ashore at dawn on June 6, 1944, assaulting German positions at 
beaches code-named Omaha, Utah, Gold, Juno and Sword. 
</P>
<P>
The assault marked the beginning of the liberation of German-occupied France 
and of the long drive across Europe that led to the destruction of Adolf 
Hitler's Third Reich.

BUSH, BHUTTO AGREE TO SEEK AFGHAN PEACE; 
</P>
<P>
PAKISTANI LEADER, IN U.S., DENIES REBEL MILITARY VICTORY IS GOAL

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, after meeting in private for nearly an hour with Pakistani 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, pledged Tuesday that the United States will 
"explore any serious avenue" to a political solution to the bloody military 
stalemate in war-torn Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate statement during an official White House ceremony after their 
meeting, Bhutto stressed that her nation also "remains committed to a political 
solution of the Afghan problem," principally because "Pakistan's commitment to 
peace and democracy are fundamental." 
</P>
<P>
The statements of the two leaders came after several months of military 
failures by the Afghan resistance, which has been financed and armed by the 
United States and Pakistan. The issue highlighted a day of intensive meetings 
between Bhutto and several U.S. Cabinet officials on subjects ranging from 
nuclear bombs and F-16 jet fighters to heroin and trade tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Pakistani officials said Bhutto, who is increasingly dubious about the 
Afghan rebels' ability to win the war militarily, went into the meetings with 
several specific proposals for a possible political settlement. The conflict 
has claimed more than 1 million lives and left more than 3 million Afghans in 
refugee camps in neighboring Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistani and U.S. officials refused to comment on the specific options, but 
Bhutto expressed her nation's strong concern about the situation after the 
White House session. 
</P>
<P>
Although the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan in February has 
brought a "welcome change" in the country, she said, "the continued fighting 
and prolonged presence of over 3.5 million Afghan refugees pose serious threats 
to the peace and stability of the region." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times before leaving on her five-day U.S. visit, which 
ends Saturday, Bhutto said she would focus her efforts here on trying "to 
dispel the notion" that Pakistan wants the rebels to achieve a military victory 
over the Afghan government forces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Army General Transferred 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Bhutto transferred the chief of her military intelligence service, an 
army general who was widely seen as a hawk in the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"The Afghan policy is constantly under review because, for Pakistan, it is an 
issue that impinges very deeply," Bhutto said in the interview. 
</P>
<P>
There was no hint Tuesday, though, that the continuing arms shipments to the 
rebels will cease, and senior officials from both countries said Tuesday night 
that it is essential to maintain military presure on the Afghan regime while 
they formulate a political settlement. A CIA-financed arms pipeline has 
funneled $2 billion in weapons to the rebels since the Soviets invaded 
Afghanistan in 1979 to support the Kabul government. 
</P>
<P>
One senior Bush Administration official told reporters that there had been no 
significant shift in the two countries' Afghan policy, stressing that Bush 
continues to call the current Soviet-backed government of Afghan President 
Najibullah an "illegitimate regime." 
</P>
<P>
In another key area of bilateral concern, though, Bhutto did get a concrete 
commitment: Pakistan's renewed campaign to curb heroin production in a nation 
that now supplies about half the heroin sold on the streets of America. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department pledged $1.5 million in new aid to help finance a 
$2.5-million Pakistani strike force that would be trained to go after what one 
Pakistani narcotics official estimates to be 500 illegal drug syndicates and 
150 laboratories operating in autonomous tribal areas along the border with 
Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
The Pakistanis had requested a total of $8 million in new U.S. aid for the 
strike force, but one narcotics official said "at least this is a start." 
</P>
<P>
Both the prime minister and Bush stressed in their official statements that the 
heroin issue, which Bush called "a scourge," figured prominently in their 
talks. They added that other key issues discussed included Pakistan's request 
to purchase 60 sophisticated F-16 fighter jets to add to its current fleet of 
40 -- a proposal that most analysts said will be approved -- and Pakistan's 
controversial nuclear program, which several key U.S. officials believe is 
aimed at developing a nuclear weapon. 
</P>
<P>
After a luncheon meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Bhutto 
reiterated her often-repeated line that Pakistan's nuclear program is strictly 
peaceful. Bush said after their meeting that Bhutto "assured me that Pakistan's 
nuclear program is committed to peaceful purposes." 
</P>
<P>
If the President fails to certify to Congress that Pakistan does not possess a 
nuclear device, the $621 million in military and economic aid that the 
Administration is requesting for Pakistan next year will be lost. 
</P>
<P>
Bush added: "I underlined my Administration's commitment to discourage 
proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons, ballistic missiles, in the South 
Asia region and around the world." 
</P>
<P>
Although substantive policy issues were discussed in the sessions, the official 
statements by both leaders were dominated by expressions of lavish praise and 
mutual appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
Several Pakistani and U.S. analysts said the rhetoric was meant to demonstrate 
that the United States is committed to the democratic government of Bhutto, who 
came to power in elections last year, at a time when her opposition at home 
remains fierce.

S. AFRICA CONDEMNS 12 TO HANG IN 'NECKLACINGS'

<TEXT>
<P>
Twelve black men Tuesday were sentenced to hang in the nominally independent 
South African homeland of Ciskei for being part of a mob that burned five 
youths to death. 
</P>
<P>
A judge in the Ciskei capital of Bisho had convicted the 12 of murder with no 
extenuating circumstances for the 1987 "necklace" killings of the youths in a 
township near the Cape province port of East London. 
</P>
<P>
In necklacing, the victim's hands are tied and a gasoline-soaked tire is placed 
around the neck and set on fire. 
</P>
<P>
Four other men were each sentenced to 20 years after being found guilty of 
murder with extenuating circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The 16 were convicted Monday under the doctrine of "common purpose," meaning 
that they were not found guilty of carrying out the actual killings but of 
sharing the aims of those who did. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, the court was told that a group of residents from Mdantsane 
township near East London abducted five youths in February, 1987, and killed 
them after accusing them of slaying another youth. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said that although only a few of the defendants were involved in the 
actual killing, there was enough evidence to convict all of them of murder. 
</P>
<P>
The case bears similarities to the trial of the so-called Sharpeville Six -- 
five men and a woman who were sentenced to death in 1986 for being part of a 
mob that killed a black town official. President Pieter W. Botha commuted their 
sentences to long prison terms after an international outcry. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, another judge using the common-purpose doctrine in the town of 
Upington sentenced 14 people to death for being part of a mob of 120 that 
killed a black police officer. They were the largest group to be sentenced to 
death in modern South African legal history.

CITY OF CHENGDU WRACKED BY RIOTS

The U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong reported at noon today that the situation in 
other Chinese cities outside Beijing continued to deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
The worst unrest was in the main city of Chengdu in Sichuan province in central 
China. According to a U.S. official, downtown Chengdu now resembles the urban 
riots of the United States in the 1960s. The city's main department store has 
been burned out and some residents of Chengdu have been smashing windows and 
looting other stores. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, at least four people were reported to have died. 
</P>
<P>
Crowds of Chengdu residents burst into the Jingiang Hotel, the main hotel for 
foreigners in the city, and the site of the U.S. Consulate there. American 
consular officials were said to have retired to their offices to keep safe from 
the turbulent crowd. 
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, meanwhile, roads throughout the city were so blocked with people 
in the streets that U.S. officials were uncertain whether it was possible to 
travel between the airport and downtown. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, in Canton, the situation remained relatively calm. "The Canton 
military region (commanders) are sitting this one out," a U.S. consular 
official said today. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want to move on their people at this time."

<P>
"Just in time for the future," declares an advertisement in Tuesday's issue of 
the South China Morning Post, amid articles chronicling Hong Kong's angry 
reactions to the massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
The ad features a photograph of a matronly woman named Marie Hubbard gazing 
pensively through her eyeglasses. She is the mayor of Newcastle, a town near 
Toronto, and she is offering "insight and advice" on what is revealed to be a 
"business/entrepreneur immigration program" in the Canadian heartland. 
</P>
<P>
Uncertainty over the future of Hong Kong, the British colony that is to return 
to Chinese control in just eight years, is nothing new. Ever since London 
agreed in 1984 to surrender Hong Kong, jitters at the prospect of Communist 
rule over this capitalist mecca have triggered periodic spasms in the real 
estate and financial markets. They have also spawned a flood of immigrants 
seeking investment opportunities -- and passports -- in places such as Canada, 
Australia and Belize. 
</P>
<P>
This previously vague sense of dread has taken on a sharp new focus over the 
pasttwo days, as Hong Kong residents have glimpsed, in horror-movie scenes on 
television, how People's Liberation Army troops went about slaughtering 
hundreds of unarmed demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
The same scenes stunned the world, but they outraged people in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
"The mood here isn't panicky, it's damn angry," said a veteran Chinese 
bureaucrat in the Hong Kong government. "Emotions are running very high." 
</P>
<P>
One of the many demonstrations against the Beijing regime's brutal crackdown 
erupted into violence today, as about 500 stone-throwing youths set fire to a 
car and smashed store fronts in the Mongkok district of Kowloon. Police said 
four officers were injured and 10 people were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The All-Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Pro-Democracy Movement 
in China had planned to shut down all but the most essential of industries and 
services today in the colony of 5.6 million people. But, because of the 
violence, the organizers called off both the general strike and a related 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
"The criminal elements in the crowd have spoiled what was a very peaceful 
demonstration. Most were genuine demonstrators who left as soon as it got bad," 
said a senior police officer who was trapped with 15 of his men by the crowd. 
"We're talking your low-life, hooligan element, the dregs of Mongkok." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Gov. David Wilson had appealed for restraint before departing for 
London, where he will hold urgent talks with Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe 
and testify before Parliament's foreign affairs committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I am appalled by what I have seen of the indiscriminate violence that has been 
going on," Wilson said, referring to the events in Beijing. "And I'm sure 
that's the feeling shared by all of the community here." 
</P>
<P>
He cautioned, however, that while "expressing concern about what is happening 
in China," Hong Kong must not "damage ourselves in the process." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson made his remarks as the stock market was going through a second day of 
gyrations in response to the blood bath in Beijing. Wild price fluctuations 
Tuesday followed Monday's 22% crash in the Hang Seng Index, the worst since the 
global securities panic of October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Although the psychological effects of political uncertainty were clear, 
analysts avoided predicting the long-term impact of the crisis on the Hong Kong 
economy, much of which is tied to trade and investment in China. 
</P>
<P>
To a degree, prosperity could depend on which faction emerges the ultimate 
victor in a violent power struggle now playing itself out -- the hard-liners, 
apparently led by senior leader Deng Xiaoping, Premier Li Peng and President 
Yang Shangkun, or the reformers associated with the Communist Party's General 
Secretary, Zhao Ziyang. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a bad jolt to confidence," said David Gledhill, chairman of the 
Swire Group, a huge Hong Kong-based conglomerate whose holdings include the 
airline Cathay Pacific. "If they can return to anything resembling normalcy 
within a few weeks, the effects might be minimal. But it depends on who comes 
out on top. If it's the hard-liners, there could be more uncertainty." 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's entrepreneurs accounted for more than half of the $11.52 billion in 
direct investment funneled into China over the past decade. Hong Kong and 
Macao, the nearby Portuguese colony, invested $7.94 billion during the period. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the joint ventures and factories are concentrated in southern 
China, far away from Beijing, and have thus been relatively sheltered from work 
stoppages and disruption of supply lines. The border between the colony's New 
Territories and special economic zones in neighboring Guangdong province 
remained open to commerce as of Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no damage so far in our trade with China, and there only will be if 
the conflagration spreads south," said Jimmy McGregor, a member of the 
Legislative Council, Hong Kong's lawmaking body. 
</P>
<P>
Even if hard-liners prevail, he said, they are likely to keep basically on 
course with economic reforms implemented when Deng emerged as China's supreme 
leader 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They will make every effort to keep the goose laying the golden egg," said 
McGregor, a former head of the colonial government's commerce and industry 
department and past director of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Climate Could Deteriorate 
</P>
<P>
But McGregor conceded that the political climate could deteriorate while 
economic growth continues. The specter of a sudden boom in emigration is a case 
in point. The number of people jumping ship nearly doubled last year, to 
45,000, and the brutal display of force by the Deng regime is widely expected 
to hasten the exodus from Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless this government is brought down and replaced by moderates within the 
Communist Party, then the level of confidence in Hong Kong is going to be 
severely damaged," said Martin Lee, an attorney who also serves on the 
Legislative Council. "Until the recent events in Beijing, there were still 
quite a lot of people who adopted a wait-and-see attitude. But after this, most 
of those who can afford to leave will leave." 
</P>
<P>
To register their displeasure with Beijing, Lee and two of his colleagues in 
the legislature announced early this week that they will step down from a joint 
committee drafting the "Basic Law" under which the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region is to be governed after 1997 in an arrangement 
guaranteeing economic autonomy under a "one country, two systems" rule. 
</P>
<P>
"Until there is a government (in Beijing) that has the mandate of the people, 
we do not recognize this government as legitimate," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>

Visit Postponed

Talks on ironing out a legal code acceptable to both sides were already adrift 
after Ji Peng Fei, head of Beijing's Hong Kong-Macao office, failed to appear 
in Hong Kong last week for a scheduled round of informal consultations. Ji's 
visit was apparently postponed because of confusion in the leadership of the 
Communist Party, a spokesman for the Hong Kong government said. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of Hong Kong's anxiety is the nagging question of whether the 
Beijing regime has evolved in 40 years to where it is capable of adhering to 
the rule of law and reason, rather than the rule of men and force, said Andrew 
Wong, a political science professor at Chinese University who also serves on 
the Legislative Council. If not, the 1984 Sino-British joint declaration, and 
the soon-to-be-finalized Basic Law, would do little to protect the political 
and economic freedom enjoyed by Hong Kong residents. 
</P>
<P>
"The fear has always been there that although we can trust the intentions of 
Beijing, we can't trust their abilities," Wong said. "We don't believe they'll 
be able to keep their hands off Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
"And now there's also the fear that if they can march their soldiers into 
Beijing, they can easily march them into Hong Kong."

SENATE UNANIMOUSLY URGES ADDITIONAL STEPS AGAINST CHINA REGIME

<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate unanimously called on President Bush on Tuesday night to take 
additional action against China to demonstrate Washington's opposition to 
government attacks on Chinese citizens in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate resolution, which passed by a rare 100-0 vote, appeared to defuse an 
effort by conservative Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) to mount congressional support 
for legislation that would have cut off all trade with China. 
</P>
<P>
Co-sponsored by Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Maine) and Minority 
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), the resolution calls on the Administration to: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Extend the visas of Chinese students in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Review China's pending applications for export licenses and loans from the 
Overseas Private Investment Corp. and the Export-Import Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Coordinate additional steps with U.S. allies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Increase daily Voice of America broadcasts beamed at China. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expressing Our Views 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell noted that the United States cannot dictate to the Chinese government 
what it should do. But he added, "It is within our power to express the views 
of the American people clearly, unequivocally, unambiguously." 
</P>
<P>
Although the resolution pressed for measures that the President so far has not 
taken, it nevertheless praised Bush for his handling of the situation. 
According to Dole, Bush has told Senate leaders that he supports the steps 
outlined in the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. William S. Cohen (R-Me.) explained that the resolution was not intended to 
criticize the Administration but instead to send a signal to the Beijing 
government that it can expect additional retaliation by the United States if 
the violence continues in China. 
</P>
<P>
The House, meanwhile, voted 406 to 0 for a resolution expressing support for 
Bush "in taking all necessary measures to provide for and ensure the safety of 
U.S. citizens in China." Unlike the Senate measure, the House resolution 
proposed no additional steps to be taken by Bush. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Marlin Fitzwater, Bush's press secretary, reported Tuesday 
that U.S. officials are now unable to contact any top-level Chinese leaders in 
Beijing, although they have talked to some middle-level officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The assumption has been that the top-level people have moved out to other 
locations," he said. "It's like the place is closed down. . . . There's no 
indication who the leadership is." 
</P>
<P>
With Beijing facing growing chaos, Secretary of State James A. Baker III urged 
all American citizens in Beijing to leave China. State Department spokeswoman 
Margaret Tutwiler said his advice applies to all Americans in Beijing except 
for the 111 diplomats and support personnel assigned to the U.S. Embassy, which 
will remain open and continue to function. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler said the Chinese government has approved plans to charter jumbo jets 
from Northwest Orient Airlines, which serves Shanghai, and from United 
Airlines, which serves Beijing, if necessary. But she added that regularly 
scheduled airliners seem to be adequate to handle the departure of any 
Americans who want to leave. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources in China, the embassy has alerted the Pentagon that U.S. 
military aircraft and ships may be necessary to evacuate Americans from China. 
However, Tutwiler said there are no plans to use the military at this time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Threats on Americans 
</P>
<P>
In addition, according to Tutwiler, there have been no threats against 
Americans in China. "We have no evidence of violence being directed at 
Americans or other foreigners," she said. "It's just a prudent action." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, she said, there are 270 American students in Beijing and about 90 
more in the rest of the country. There are an estimated 2,500 American 
businessmen and other private citizens living in Beijing and about 7,400 others 
in the rest of the country. At any time, she said, there are about 4,000 
American tourists in China. 
</P>
<P>
Sources in China said the embassy has been considering plans to evacuate 
Americans working for Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum's coal mine 
project deep in the Chinese interior at Antaibo, in Shanxi province. No 
decisions have been made as yet on that. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a ban on Chinese diplomatic visits announced by Bush on Monday, 
Tutwiler said the Administration has not withdrawn its invitation to Chinese 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to visit Washington next week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visas for Chinese 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler indicated the Administration has decided to permit all 45,000 Chinese 
citizens now in the United States to remain until conditions at home become 
settled, even if their visas expire. This was one of the additional steps 
recommended by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate also recommended that all applications to the Overseas Private 
Investment Corp. for the protection of investment in China and to the 
Export-Import Bank for financing of trade with China be reviewed "in light of 
existing legal requirements for adequate human rights treatment and 
deteriorating condition of human rights in China."

DOZENS HURT AS JET HITS SEVERE TURBULENCE

<P>
As many as three dozen passengers were injured Tuesday, at least one seriously, 
when a crowded United Airlines DC-10 jumbo jet en route from Los Angeles to 
Chicago slammed into a pocket of severe turbulence and rocked wildly through 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
"It was unbelievable, we freaked, we thought we were going to die," said 
Maribeth Duffy, 26, a former flight attendant who was returning home from a 
vacation in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers said food, drinks, luggage and even some people went flying through 
the air as the plane, United Flight 90 with 232 passengers and 11 crew members 
aboard, bucked and dove as much as 2,000 feet. One infant reportedly sailed out 
of its mother's arms into a coat rack near the front of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Hopkins, a United spokesman, said the incident occurred at 37,000 feet over 
Garden City, Kan., more than 800 miles west of Chicago. Hopkins said the seat 
belt sign was on at the time and the flight attendants were all strapped into 
their seats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Emergency Plan Activated 
</P>
<P>
The pilot radioed ahead to Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, where an 
emergency plan was activated. Ambulances were standing by on the tarmac when 
the plane landed to take the injured to area hospitals. Hopkins said at least 
10 passengers were removed from the airliner on stretchers, while others among 
the injured managed to walk off under their own power. 
</P>
<P>
"Turbulence is a phenomenon that's been with us for years, but severe 
turbulence where people are actually physically injured and have to go to a 
hospital, that's quite rare," Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen at several hospitals said most of those hurt appeared to have 
suffered neck, head and back injuries and some had been hit by flying debris. 
Most did not appear to be hurt seriously, though a few passengers were 
admitted, including a 4-month-old baby brought into Chicago's Resurrection 
Hospital by ambulance with a brace around its neck and an oxygen mask over its 
face. It could not be immediatedly determined if this was the same infant that 
reportedly flew into the coat rack. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Announcement Made 
</P>
<P>
Duffy, who was treated for an arm injury at another facility, said the captain 
had made an announcement about possible turbulence prior to the incident, which 
occurred about 90 minutes into the flight at about 3 p.m. PDT. She said the 
flight attendants quit serving meals when the captain made the announcement. 
However, they did not check to see if passenger seat belts were fastened and 
tray tables stowed before they sat down, Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
She said several of the injured passengers were sleeping and did not hear the 
captain's warning. 
</P>
<P>
"The girl that was sitting in the very back of the plane was asleep and didn't 
have her seat belt on," Duffy said. "She literally flew over the seat in front 
of her into the next seat up. . . . I've never experienced anything like that 
in my two years of flying." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quits Attendant Job 
</P>
<P>
Duffy, who had worked for Chicago-based Midway Airlines, said she quit last 
year because she became nervous about flying after an incident aboard an Aloha 
Airlines jet in which the roof ripped off while it was in flight over Hawaii. 
One person, a flight attendant, was sucked out of Aloha's plane and died. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy said several passengers were jostled so severely that they bounced off 
the ceiling and left dents. After calm was restored, she said the captain told 
passengers that the choppy air was so unexpected it had not even appeared on 
his radar. 
</P>
<P>
She said crew members asked injured passengers whether they wanted to fly on to 
Chicago or land quickly. All apparently opted for Chicago.

WAXMAN DROPS BID TO BECOME MAJORITY WHIP, SUPPORTS GRAY

<P>
Rep. Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles on Tuesday pulled out of the race for House 
majority whip, the third-ranking spot in the House Democratic leadership, 
saying that he entered the contest too late and his candidacy might divide the 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
The key job opened up when Rep. Tony Coelho of Merced decided to retire from 
Congress rather than face an ethics inquiry related to his purchase of a 
$100,000 junk bond. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman, an influential liberal who had hoped to retain the leadership post for 
a Californian, said that it would have been "very, very tough" to pry his 
colleagues away from commitments they have made to three other candidates in 
recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Entering the race at this late date poses difficult and perhaps insurmountable 
obstacles," he said. "Since many colleagues have already given commitments to 
the other candidates, I fear that my candidacy could serve to divide our party 
and keep us from a smooth transition to a new leadership team." 
</P>
<P>
Waxman threw his support to Rep. William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania, the 
leading candidate to succeed Coelho. Gray, who heads the House Democratic 
Caucus and is the highest-ranking black member of the House, is competing for 
the post with Rep. David E. Bonior of Michigan, the deputy whip, and Rep. Beryl 
Anthony Jr. of Arkansas, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee. A vote is planned later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman said Gray's candidacy would not be harmed by reports last week that the 
Justice Department was conducting a preliminary criminal inquiry into his 
office. Gray angrily denied that he is the target of an investigation and has 
demanded that Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh investigate news leaks that led to 
such stories. 
</P>
<P>
Gray will be a "most valuable addition to the leadership team," said Waxman, 
who had been urged to seek the whip job by other California House Democrats. 
The post, which controls the flow and content of major House legislation, can 
have a crucial impact on important California issues, such as clean air, AIDS 
funding, immigration and highway construction. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman will remain chairman of the powerful health and environment subcommittee 
of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

2 INSURERS CUT RATES ON SOME COVERAGE; AUTOS NOT INCLUDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two insurance companies, Safeco and Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, said Tuesday 
that they are voluntarily rolling back their premium rates in accord with 
Proposition 103 on certain commercial policies representing a small percentage 
of their total California business. 
</P>
<P>
Checks with these and other major insurers found no company, however, that had 
plans to roll back any private automobile or homeowner premiums. All spokesmen 
said their companies had applied to Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie for 
exemptions from rollbacks on these policies, which constitute the lion's share 
of their business in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Aetna spokesman Jason Wright said Aetna will roll back rates 20% from 1987 
levels, as called for in the initiative, on commercial policies relating to 
crime coverage, farmers and ranchers and inland marine (boats), and 8.8% on 
policies covering commercial condominium owners. Total premiums affected would 
be less than $50 million of Aetna's 1988 sales of $660 million in the state, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safeco Rollbacks 
</P>
<P>
Safeco spokesman Bill Pierron said that company will give 20% rollbacks from 
1987 levels for malpractice policies for dentists and emergency medical 
technicians. These constitute about $13 million of Safeco's $409 million annual 
sales in all lines of insurance. 
</P>
<P>
A third company, the Automobile Club of Southern California, said it will roll 
back premiums on small boats, constituting $4 million of the $770 million in 
total premiums it writes. 
</P>
<P>
The state Supreme Court in its May decision upholding Proposition 103 rollbacks 
said insurers could be exempted from them by the insurance commissioner if they 
could demonstrate that after giving them, they would not be receiving a fair 
rate of return on their business.

Terming it "shameful" for such a prosperous state as California to allow up to 
250,000 homeless people to live on the streets, the Little Hoover Commission on 
Tuesday called for more aggressive leadership, improved program coordination 
and less red tape for homeless aid applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that more than $780 million from a variety of sources is spent annually 
on homeless aid services, the watchdog state government commission said it 
found existing programs to be fragmented and poorly coordinated. 
</P>
<P>
"The homeless are not a hidden or ignored problem in this state," Commission 
Chairman Nathan Shapell said in releasing the findings of a two-year study. 
"Yet the state's streets, parking lots, greenbelts, alleys and stairwells still 
are hosts to thousands of homeless families and children nightly." 
</P>
<P>
Two key recommendations contained in a 13-point program were proposals to 
consolidate all programs for the homeless under the state Health and Welfare 
Agency and to establish centralized "one-stop" county reception centers for 
homeless aid applicants. 
</P>
<P>
The report of the blue-ribbon commission said the one-stop reception centers 
would sign up all newly homeless individuals, assess their needs and hook them 
into all applicable aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
Maggie DeBow, a spokeswoman for the State Health and Welfare Agency, said the 
agency "would be willing to consider any and all proposals that the commission 
has to offer to help reduce the homeless problem in California."

ENVIRONMENTALISTS HIT STATE PLAN ON WATER ALLOCATIONS

Environmentalists on Tuesday hammered a state plan to revamp the process by 
which it will reallocate water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, roughly 
two-thirds of the state's fresh water. 
</P>
<P>
The new process would govern the San Francisco Bay-Delta hearings, a years-long 
analysis that resulted last fall in a recommendation to cap water exports from 
Northern California to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Several powerful water agencies opposed that idea, which might have limited 
urban growth and agriculture. They persuaded the State Water Resources Control 
Board to design a new Bay-Delta hearings process. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists blasted that process Tuesday for stressing existing water 
rights while inhibiting a far-reaching reallocation of water resources. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists said the process is legally suspect because it assumes 
reallocation is the last resort, judges proposals under a vague 
"reasonableness" standard and permits new water exports even as the board is 
supposed to be debating export reductions. 
</P>
<P>
The board is scheduled to vote June 22 on the proposed new process.

MARINE PILOTS ORDERED TO STOP FLYING, TAKE REFRESHER COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Because a recent string of military aircraft accidents can be largely blamed on 
human error, the commandant of the Marine Corps Tuesday ordered all Marine 
pilots to leave their cockpits for a two-day safety refresher course over the 
next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Alfred M. Gray Jr. said that in the seven recent accidents, which claimed 
the lives of 45 Marines, "air crew error predominates and most likely will be a 
primary cause in all these mishaps." 
</P>
<P>
Aircraft and crews based at Tustin and El Toro Marine Corps air stations in 
Orange County have been involved in three of the fatal helicopter accidents, 
accounting for 25 of the fatalities. One of the accidents involved a Marine 
Corps reserve unit based at El Toro, and the other two in South Korea involved 
personnel and an aircraft from the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing at El Toro and 
Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time to pause, catch our breath, and come to grips with the devastating 
trend established this year," Gray said in a Teletype message to Marine bases 
worldwide. "To that end, within the next two weeks, all aviation units will 
conduct a two-day safety stand-down. 
</P>
<P>
"Our machines are not letting us down; we are letting ourselves down," Gray 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Donald E.P. Miller, commander of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing at El 
Toro, said he has instructed his group and squadron commanders to complete the 
refresher course by June 17. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to shut them all down at once for the two days of instruction, 
but that is impossible," Miller said, adding that he has some aircraft in the 
middle of missions. "I think it is a hell of a good idea. I think we have to 
stop once in a while and say are we doing this right." 
</P>
<P>
Gray's order affects 1,200 Marine Corps fighters, observation planes and 
helicopters in 87 aviation squadrons worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
"His concern is the number of deaths so far this year," said Lt. Col. Fred Peck 
in Washington. Peck said Gray's action ordering all Marine Corps aviators to 
the classroom was "unprecedented." 
</P>
<P>
"It has been done squadron-wide or even wing-wide, but, the best I can 
determine, never before Marine Corps-wide," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The order came less than six months after Marine Corps aviators completed the 
safest flying year ever.

BRADLEY REITERATES VOW ON OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley, further clarifying what he has described as an "error in 
judgment," said Tuesday that he will never again accept outside employment of 
the sort that launched investigations into his conduct. 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued by his office, the mayor elaborated on an 
admission delivered May 10 during a dramatic appearance before the Los Angeles 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not seek or accept any form of outside employment from any 
profit-making body in the future," the mayor's statement on Tuesday said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley also renewed a vow to "hold my office to the highest ethical 
standards." 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney is currently investigating, among other things, Bradley's 
acceptance of money to serve as an adviser to two local financial institutions. 
The Far East National Bank paid Bradley $18,000 in 1988, while it did business 
with the city. Bradley has since returned the money. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan paid the mayor up to $24,000 a 
year from 1978 until earlier this year. During that period, its subsidiaries 
had zoning matters before the City Council which required mayoral approval. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, in his hastily arranged appearance before the council, Bradley said 
his outside employment was a mistake "because of the perceptions it created." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Recognize That Error' 
</P>
<P>
"I now recognize that error and I will always regret it," the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bradley implied then that he would not accept outside work in the 
future, he issued the specific statement on the point Tuesday after questions 
were raised by reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley did not speak to reporters about the matter. He has refused to discuss 
his activities, saying that he will wait until the investigations are complete 
or until he feels compelled by events to talk. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a way to get it out clearly," Bradley spokesman Bill Chandler said of 
the written statement. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the city attorney's probe -- which is covering a range of 
financial activities by the mayor -- Bradley's actions are under review by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department. Their probes 
center on Bradley's history of stock and bond transactions involving the 
troubled investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor also, in his written statement, recalled his vow to place all of his 
investments in a blind trust. While that vow was made on April 27, Bradley has 
yet to form the trust which would place all of his investments outside of his 
personal control. Since early May, mayoral aides have said the trust would be 
established in a matter of days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dominates City Politics 
</P>
<P>
The controversy over Bradley's financial conduct has dominated City Hall 
politics for months, far overshadowing the mayor's victory for an unprecedented 
fifth term. Most recently, City Hall has been the scene of strife over clashing 
approaches to reform of the city's ethics laws. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, in an attempt to put the controversy behind him, set up an independent 
ethics panel that this fall is to deliver its recommendations for tightening 
the current code of ethics. 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, three council members unveiled their own ethics reform 
proposals, which are due to come before the council this summer and thus will 
likely steal the spotlight from the conclusions formed by the mayor's ethics 
panel.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BLAZING HAY CLOSES FREEWAY FOR 3 HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blazing clumps of hay spewed from a truck in the City of Industry after baling 
wires broke in a fiery freeway crash that left five people with minor injuries, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
It took firefighters more three hours to put out the fires and reopen the 
Pomona Freeway near Fullerton Road, said California Highway Patrol spokesman 
Lyle Whitten. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred in stop-and-go traffic at 8:50 a.m. when a truck hauling 
five tons of hay and driven by Rudolfo Ruiz Jr., 51, of Kerman rear-ended a car 
carrying two men, a woman and a 4-year-old child, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Both the auto and the big rig were consumed by flames ignited by sparks in the 
crash," Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz and another trucker tried to put the fire out with extinguishers but could 
not, Whitten said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MENTAL HOSPITAL ESCAPEE CAPTURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who escaped from Patton State Mental Hospital, where he was committed 
after wounding a police officer and security guard in Pasadena, was captured 
Tuesday at the end of a six-hour police stakeout of a Las Vegas apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Bernard Washington, 23, offered no resistance despite previous vows not 
to be taken alive if found by authorities. Police said he was unarmed at the 
time of the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Washington was committed to Patton after being found incompetent to stand trial 
for the January, 1989, attempted murder of a Pasadena police officer and a 
public housing complex security guard. 
</P>
<P>
The security guard and policeman were reportedly serving Washington with an 
eviction notice when he opened fire on them with a shotgun. Both officers were 
seriously wounded in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
He escaped from the mental hospital May 23 after using wire cutters to open a 
chain-link fence surrounding the institution's outer perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
A plainclothes SWAT team watched the apartment where Washington was reportedly 
staying with his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Officers moved in on him as he drove away from the complex in a borrowed car. 
They arrested him several blocks away.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STATE URGED NOT TO PAROLE ASSAILANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council urged state officials Tuesday to reverse their 
decision to parole a crazed movie fan who nearly killed actress Theresa Saldana 
in a knife attack seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously to support the motion of its president, John 
Ferraro, demanding reversal of the decision to free Scottish drifter Arthur 
Jackson on June 15. 
</P>
<P>
"If recourse to the courts and the Legislature is out, then an appeal to the 
parole board to add more conditions to his parole may be the only action left," 
Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
The council's action came the same day that 60 members of the Assembly sent a 
letter to the state Board of Prison Terms asking that Jackson's release be 
blocked. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jackson has a June 15 release date, he faces a prison disciplinary 
hearing next Tuesday for breaking windows. The incident could add another 180 
days prison time. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Jackson will be turned over to immigration agents for deportation 
to Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's obsession with the actress led to the March 15, 1982, attack outside 
her West Hollywood home. She was stabbed 10 times. He served seven years of a 
12-year sentence.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 6 JAILED IN RESPONSE TO ATTACK ON DEPUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six suspected gang members were arrested Tuesday in early morning raids mounted 
in response to a recent attack on sheriff's deputies, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
About 90 deputies were involved in the raids, serving search warrants at seven 
homes in the Lennox area of South-Central Los Angeles beginning about 6 a.m., 
Deputy Roger Hom said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the six arrested were two men suspected of shooting at deputies and 
others in a May 21 incident, Hom said. The two were booked on suspicion of 
attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies were not injured in the fusillade, but other three people were 
wounded, Sgt. Gib Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting erupted while the deputies were detaining six suspected gang 
members and had them lined up against a patrol car, Anderson said. At least two 
gunmen started shooting from another part of the street. 
</P>
<P>
Of the six suspects arrested Tuesday, one was booked on suspicion of possession 
of cocaine; another was taken into custody on an outstanding misdemeanor 
warrant and another was booked on a parole violation, Hom said.

FANS OF PAN PACIFIC URGE REBUILDING OF FIRE-GUTTED BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fans of the Pan Pacific Auditorium claimed Tuesday that they have gathered more 
than 1,000 signatures urging that the fire-gutted structure be rebuilt instead 
of torn down for parkland, as some neighbors of the historic facility have 
urged. 
</P>
<P>
"Our cityscape is being destroyed by arsonists and a few homeowners who don't 
want certain things in their neighborhood," said Kathleen Rogers, an 
entertainment publicist who formed a group, Friends of the Pan Pacific, after 
the May 24 fire. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference outside the ruins of the 54-year-old building, 
Rogers and others called on County Supervisor Ed Edelman to support restoration 
of the structure, which was once the site of sports events, ice shows, beauty 
pageants and other entertainment, including a concert by Elvis Presley. 
</P>
<P>
She said the group collected signatures supporting its position by going 
door-to-door nights and weekends since the fire, but she did not make available 
at the press conference copies of the signatures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Be Decisive 
</P>
<P>
Edelman's position on the matter is likely to be decisive because the Pan 
Pacific, which had been abandoned since 1972, is located in a county-operated 
state park in his district. 
</P>
<P>
"I favored preserving the existing building, but unfortunately the tragic fire 
has destroyed almost the entire structure," the supervisor said in a statement 
issued in response to the appeals made at the press conference. "Therefore, we 
must consider other options." 
</P>
<P>
He said that reconstruction as called for by organizations including Rogers' 
newly formed group is one possibility. Others include clearing the site to 
expand the adjacent park, as proposed by a neighborhood homeowners' group, or 
rebuilding the streamlined western facade of the building, much of which 
survived the fire, to serve as the entry to a small museum or senior citizen 
center. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, no decision has been made on what to do," Edelman said. He said 
he will meet with preservationists, homeowners, developers and other public 
officials before deciding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Definite Commitment' 
</P>
<P>
Steven S. Karic, executive vice president of the Rancho La Brea Neighborhood 
Assn., said that representatives of the group spent more than an hour with 
Edelman earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
"We got no definite commitment from Edelman," he said, "but the sense is that 
it's a new ball game now. At this point, we are advocating park use. If the 
structure is no longer there to be saved, you shouldn't rebuild something in 
its place, because it's not the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Karic said he deplored Rogers' reference to arsonists and homeowners, calling 
it "irresponsible and reckless." 
</P>
<P>
Others joining the appeal to rebuild the structure included Marc Dragun, a 
developer with Kornwasser &amp; Friedman, the firm that had an option to put an 
ice skating rink, movie theaters and gymnasium in the old building. 
Negotiations were under way on their project when the building went up in 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing magical about using 1930s building materials. . . . If we are 
allowed to proceed, we can open within two years," Dragun said. "The last thing 
this area needs is for this structure to remain a vacant, burned-out hulk while 
the county decides what to do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Great Deal Is Left 
</P>
<P>
Lou Naidorf, a designer with the Ellerbe-Becket architectural firm, whose 
founders built the original structure, said there was a great deal of it left 
despite the conflagration. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a simple building to begin with, wood frame and stucco. For that 
reason, restoring would be not only physically possible but easy to 
accomplish," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The auditorium was built at a cost of $125,000 in 1935, but "costs might have 
gone up a little bit" since then, Naidorf said. He provided no specific 
estimate of what it would cost to rebuild. He said plans and photographs exist 
that would make it easy to restore. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Wolff, music director for the Arsenio Hall television show, said at the 
press conference that musicians have warm memories of the building because it 
was the scene of concerts by great performers such as Count Basie and Woody 
Herman. 
</P>
<P>
Elvis Presley appeared there in 1957, a recollection prompting Wolff to joke 
that "we can safely say that if we can get it together to rebuild this building 
in two years, then Elvis will come back and perform here." Presley died in 
1977.

PHYSICIANS, INVESTORS MAKE FIRST PAYMENT ON HOSPITAL IN CHINATOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE McMILLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of physicians and other investors took the first step Tuesday toward 
purchasing Chinatown's financially troubled French Hospital, which they plan to 
operate as a for-profit facility. 
</P>
<P>
In a step that hospital President Don Carrico described as the first 
transaction in a phased four-month escrow, a limited partnership called 
P.A.M.C. Ltd. made a $750,000 payment Tuesday toward a $4.2-million purchase of 
the 155-bed facility, the oldest hospital in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"If that didn't happen, we were in a close-down mode," Carrico said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lost $3 Million in 1988 
</P>
<P>
The hospital lost $3 million last year, was operating at an estimated 
$1.4-million deficit this year and was scheduled to close this month if other 
financial resources or a buyer was not found. 
</P>
<P>
With the new agreement, Carrico said, "The hospital will remain open." 
</P>
<P>
The news was greeted by mixed reactions around Chinatown, with some concerned 
whether the physicians group -- most of them Chinese-Americans -- will be 
financially able to complete the purchase. Others wondered what effect the 
hospital's switch from its present nonprofit status to its new for-profit 
management will have on relations with the Chinatown community. 
</P>
<P>
Banker Wilbur Woo, who as an executive with Cathay Bank has been involved in 
many community projects, said he and others were interested in seeing French 
Hospital become "a community-owned hospital, run by the community. It is now 
for-profit. So that's that." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout its 129-year history, the hospital has been controlled by the French 
Society, a group formed to serve the medical needs of French immigrants. As 
Chinatown grew up around the facility at College and Hill streets, the 
society's ability and willingness to cater to the local Chinese population was 
a continuing sensitive issue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Half of Staff Is Asian 
</P>
<P>
About half the hospital staff and 55% of the patients are Asian. But the 
hospital has been criticized for not having enough Chinese-speaking personnel 
and for not serving a selection of Chinese food. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the five directors of the newly formed corporate partnership are 
Chinese doctors. One of these, Chinatown obstetrician-gynecologist Carl Moy, 
said the interests of the community are paramount. "This community needs this 
hospital," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the hospital has been in a precarious financial situation for about 
three years, which officials attributed to a declining number of patients, a 
high proportion -- close to 90% -- of Medicare and Medi-Cal patients and a 
corresponding drop in revenues because of a drop in government reimbursement 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
Given the hospital's problems, Chinatown leaders like accountant Saykin Foo, 
vice president of the Chinese-American Citizens Alliance, hope that with a 
for-profit management, "there'll be an incentive to make it a better hospital." 
</P>
<P>
The new group is "likely to be more aggressive," said Bassett Brown, a 
South-Central Los Angeles physician who is on the new board of directors. The 
new owners will also bring in "other physicians from the immediate surrounding 
area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership includes 47 investors, 32 of them doctors, according to 
Christopher Wheeler, an Irvine-based consultant assisting the group. He said he 
hopes the number will grow to 70, with each investor contributing $50,000 
toward the purchase price of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Option on Land 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the hospital facility, the group also has an option over the 
next six years to purchase the two-acre property on which the hospital sits. 
The site is owned by the French Society and will cost another $10 million -- 
with the price rising $500,000 each year that the option is not exercised. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can come up with the money," said S. Y. Wong, the hospital's chief 
of staff and head of the buyer group's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"The deal isn't done-done," Wheeler added. "It's just beginning."

HOTEL BARS CONTROVERSIAL PBS FILM ON PALESTINIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The newly opened Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel has joined several Los Angeles 
synagogues which have decided not to be the site of the first private preview 
in this country of the controversial documentary, "Days of Rage: The Young 
Palestinians." 
</P>
<P>
Joel Gayman, a Los Angeles publicist who was attempting to arrange the showing 
of the documentary made for the Public Broadcasting Service, said he "is 
saddened by the lack of commitment" on the part of the city's Jewish community 
and the area's newest hotel to grapple with the film's thorny issues. 
</P>
<P>
The 90-minute film, produced and directed by Jo Franklin-Trout, is a 
documentary about the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank 
and Gaza Strip. It has a strong Palestinian perspective, according to Times 
television critic Howard Rosenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Completed last September, it has been seen abroad, but not in this country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sept. 6 Broadcast 
</P>
<P>
Gayman said Tuesday that he did not know if any concerted attempt was being 
made to lobby against the documentary, which PBS has rescheduled for broadcast 
on Sept. 6. Several previous broadcasts have been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, he thinks that there is an atmosphere of fear connected with 
showing a film with a strong Palestinian perspective in Los Angeles, a city 
with a Jewish population of about 600,000, second only to New York. 
</P>
<P>
"People are running away from what they think other people might think if they 
show the film," Gayman said. "But when people see it, they will say, 'What are 
we yelling and screaming about?' " 
</P>
<P>
Gayman, 44, is a board member of an Arab-Jewish dialogue group called the 
Middle East Cousins Club of Los Angeles. He said the plan was to show "Days of 
Rage" to a private audience of about 300 people, and then hold a panel and 
audience discussion afterward. 
</P>
<P>
The panel was to have consisted of Dennis Prager, a conservative Jewish writer; 
Assistant Rabbi Sue Levi Elwell of the liberal Leo Baeck Temple of Bel-Air; 
Arab-American radio and television personality Casey Kasem, an activist 
promoting Middle East peace; and anthropologist Fadwa El-Guindi, president of 
the Los Angeles chapter of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The group had also invited the Israeli consulate in Los Angeles to either 
produce a video rebuttal to the documentary or to supply a panelist. The 
consulate declined. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lobbying Denied 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, a spokesman for the consulate, Ilan Mor, denied there had been 
any lobbying against the film.

Gayman said he encountered weeks of frustration in attempting to arrange for 
"Days of Rage" to show at Leo Baeck Temple, Temple Israel of Hollywood and 
Temple Beth Sholom of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
But Leo Baeck's Elwell said that Gayman made his proposal "at the last minute" 
when he knew that the temple's hierarchy wanted to "preview" the documentary. 
She underscored that the decision had nothing to do with any bias.

"This synagogue is known for being a place which encourages (the airing) of 
controversial issues," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last Friday, Gayman said he got a green light from the Santa Monica Beach 
Hotel, which opened its doors on Monday. But hotel management, he said, 
canceled the room almost at the last minute -- Monday afternoon, when the 
showing was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. today . 
</P>
<P>
The hotel's managing director, Lloyd Kirsch, said the hotel's facilities simply 
were not ready to accommodate any groups, and that a lower-level employee erred 
in agreeing to the event. "This was one of those last-minute things on a Friday 
afternoon that a junior salesman got involved in," he said.

SHERIFF'S EMPLOYEE IS SHOT BY GUNMAN; 
</P>
<P>
OFFICERS IN WOODLAND HILLS WOUND ATTACKER WHO LATER KILLS SELF

A civilian employee of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department was shot and 
critically wounded Tuesday when he confronted a man in the parking lot of a 
Woodland Hills high school, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman -- who was then wounded by one of two California Highway Patrol 
officers who happened by the Taft High School parking lot and witnessed the 
2:50 a.m. shooting -- fled from the scene but later killed himself while holed 
up in a nearby office building, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Rotella, 21, of Woodland Hills was shot twice in the head during the 
parking lot scuffle. A sheriff's community services officer who handles 
administrative duties at the Santa Clarita Valley station, Rotella was in 
critical but stable condition Tuesday after surgery at Northridge Hospital 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman was identified as Zalai Tibor, 30, a Hungarian immigrant who moved 
to North Hollywood from his native country less than a year ago. Investigators 
said they had not determined why Tibor was at the school parking lot or why he 
was carrying a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Before the shooting, Rotella had walked out of a supermarket across from the 
school and may have seen something suspicious, authorities said. Investigators 
believe that Rotella, who was unarmed and not wearing a uniform, drove his 
Chevrolet Blazer into the school parking lot and confronted Tibor. 
</P>
<P>
"Something must have gotten his attention to make him go over there," Los 
Angeles Police Lt. Charles Massey said. 
</P>
<P>
In the school parking lot, Rotella and Tibor began to fight, possibly for 
control of a gun that Tibor pulled out, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officers Steve Icay and Steve Tabor were on routine patrol when they passed 
the high school and saw the two men fighting, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fired Two Shots 
</P>
<P>
"As they were putting a spotlight on the two men, they observed one down on the 
ground and the other standing up," CHP Officer Dave Grajeda said. The officers 
saw the man standing up fire two shots, wounding the man on the ground, Grajeda 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP officers took cover behind their patrol car and ordered the gunman to 
surrender, but the man ran to Rotella's Blazer and jumped inside, Grajeda said. 
</P>
<P>
When the vehicle did not start, the man leaned out its door and pointed the gun 
at the two officers, Grajeda said. Icay fired once, striking the gunman in the 
chest. The gunman ducked back inside the Blazer, got it started and sped across 
the parking lot as Icay fired five more times, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The two officers did not chase the Blazer but radioed for backup and went to 
the aid of Rotella. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fled into Office Building 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, Los Angeles police found the Blazer abandoned on a street behind 
the school. Authorities said other officers then spotted Tibor running across 
the 20300 block of Ventura Boulevard and into a two-story office complex, where 
he roamed an open courtyard looking for an unlocked door. 
</P>
<P>
"He ran all around the place," Massey said. "There was a trail of blood." 
</P>
<P>
Police followed the trail to a restroom at the rear of the courtyard. They 
heard a shot from the restroom and, when they entered, found Tibor dead of a 
self-inflicted gunshot to the head, police said.

RILEY'S FAST BREAK; 
</P>
<P>
THE L.A. LAKERS' COACH HAS RISEN QUICKLY TO THE TASK OF MARKETING HIS LOOKS AND 
INSPIRATIONAL SKILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
For Coach Pat Riley, there's a lot more riding on a third consecutive Los 
Angeles Lakers National Basketball Assn. championship than another ring on his 
finger. 
</P>
<P>
A series win over the Pistons could also mean hundreds of thousands of 
promotional dollars in his pocket. Much of it comes from motivational speeches 
he gives to corporations such as Exxon -- which earn him up to $15,000 each. 
And while Riley is currently a pitchman for six products -- from Southern 
California Chrysler-Plymouth Dealers to Transamerica -- marketing experts say 
he has yet to really cut the mustard as a big-time, national TV spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
That, however, could change with all the speed of a Magic Johnson no-look pass. 
In fact, if the Lakers beat the Pistons for a third straight championship, some 
sports marketing experts project that Riley could soon be earning well over $2 
million annually from a combination of his speeches, personal appearances and 
commercials. That's several times more than his base annual salary with the 
Lakers, which is reportedly $650,000. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief telephone interview Tuesday from his hotel room in Troy, Mich. -- 
hours before the game -- Riley said his success as a product pitchman goes hand 
in hand with his success as a basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I turned down offers for years," said Riley. "I had to develop my credibility 
as a coach before I could become a credible product spokesman." 
</P>
<P>
These days, Riley seems to get as much air time selling Chryslers for the 
Southern California Chrysler-Plymouth Dealers Assn. as he gets for coaching the 
Lakers. He is also a West Coast spokesman for Pepsi. Riley was featured in an 
ad for Rolaids, a regional print campaign for Transamerica Life Cos., and 
appeared with a cavalcade of stars in a commercial for Revlon that ran during 
the Academy Awards. He is also under contract to Reebok, although he has yet to 
appear in any of the athletic shoe maker's ads. 
</P>
<P>
"All of these things are a direct result of my coaching. If I wasn't a good 
coach, they'd fall by the wayside," said Riley. "Of course, I'm not going to be 
a coach forever, so I hope some of these relationships can continue once my 
career as a coach does end." 
</P>
<P>
That is probably years off. Of more pressing concern to Riley -- and those who 
consult Riley on his business ventures -- is how the Lakers fare against the 
Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody loves a winner," said Marc Reede, president of Promotional 
Sportstars, a Beverly Hills firm that books all of Riley's speaking 
engagements. "If he loses, there might be certain bookings he won't get. Some 
might say, 'Gee, let's give (Detroit Coach) Chuck Daly a call.' " 
</P>
<P>
But whether the Lakers win or loose, Riley is charging more than ever these 
days for personal appearances. In fact, Riley has recently raised his speaking 
fees to $15,000 from the $10,000 that he charged last year when he gave about 
60 speeches during the off season, said Reede. 
</P>
<P>
"We're to the point now where we have to be very selective about his 
engagements," said Reede, who estimates he is now getting 10 to 15 calls daily 
about Riley's availability. "We thought it would be a way to cut demand if we 
raised the price, but most people we see don't even blink when we say $15,000." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Riley's first corporate speech after the season ends will be June 27 
in Dallas, when he is scheduled to speak to Abbott Laboratories executives on 
the topic "Staying One Step Ahead of the Posse." During the off season, he is 
also scheduled to speak to such diverse groups as Arby's Roast Beef and First 
American Title. Reede said Riley writes all of his own speeches. 
</P>
<P>
"After the speeches," said Reede, "he signs every photo and shakes every hand 
and makes everyone feel important." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it may be some time before Riley pulls in the kind of fees that some of 
his peers are getting. Former football coach and current CBS television sports 
analyst John Madden, for example, earns nearly twice what Riley does for a 
single speech -- nearly $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growing National Celebrity 
</P>
<P>
Riley's biggest handicap, say marketing executives, is the advertising world's 
general perception of him as a West Coast commodity. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, his appeal may be more skewed to the West Coast," said Bud Stanner, 
senior vice president at International Management Co., a Cleveland sports 
marketing firm. "But that can change. Pat Riley is a very, very marketable 
sports celebrity. His team gets lots of TV exposure. He's attractive. And he's 
smart." 
</P>
<P>
Riley's other marketing problem is his lack of available time. Unlike retired 
coaches -- such as Madden -- who have plenty of time to stand in front of TV 
cameras, Riley's free time is mostly limited to the off-season months of July 
through October. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a schedule that could choke a horse," said John Morgan, senior director 
of marketing at Reebok International. "Now, in particular, we should be doing 
ads with him. We'd love to get a full day to shoot a commercial with him, but 
it's not possible." 
</P>
<P>
Just ask the officials at Southern California Chrysler-Plymouth. They had to 
pack four TV commercials and 10 radio spots featuring Riley into just a few 
days of filming. "It's very tough to spring him loose," said Dan White, manager 
of the Studio City-based Southern California Chrysler-Plymouth Dealers Assn. 
"He doesn't have the time to devote to us that we'd like." 
</P>
<P>
That hasn't stopped Chrysler from paying Riley what experts estimate is 
$100,000 annually -- plus the use of a $23,000 Chrysler New Yorker. And next 
year, Chrysler's Los Angeles ad agency Bozell expects to start placing Riley 
inside the cars -- instead of almost always standing outside the vehicles 
tossing around a basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's a hell of a coach," said Jim Preston, sales manager at Domenich 
Basso Chrysler-Plymouth in downtown Los Angeles. "And I hope he keeps his job 
with Chrysler. But to tell you the truth, I can't say anyone ever came in here 
and said they were sent by Pat Riley. Of course, we still get some people who 
say Ricardo Montalban sent them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

INVESTORS IN HONG KONG TURN TO U.S. AS TURMOIL IN CHINA ROCKS ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong investors have begun moving more capital out of the British colony 
and expressed heightened interest in U.S. real estate amid the escalating 
unrest in China and the plunge in Hong Kong stock and real estate prices. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the new wave of capital flight does not appear to be a mass exodus. But 
the outflow is expected to grow if violence and instability in China continue 
or a new government emerges that is hostile to preserving the free-wheeling 
economic system in Hong Kong when China takes over in 1997, U.S. bankers and 
others said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen some activity in wiring money out of Hong Kong, but it's not 
significant yet," reported Dunson Cheng, president of Los Angeles-based Cathay 
Bank, which has depositors from Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last day or two, we've had a couple of modest transfers, but it's 
nothing like you could say there's a tremendous flight out of Hong Kong," said 
an official of a major U.S. bank with operations in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a strong economy in recent years, Hong Kong already has an exodus of 
people and money, stemming from the 1984 agreement by the British government to 
turn over the colony to China. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows for sure just how much money has left Hong Kong in recent years, 
but 75,000 of the colony's residents are estimated to have emigrated in the 
past two years. Seven of every 10 people in Hong Kong either fled from 
communism in China or have at least one parent who did so, and thus there is a 
large mistrust of the Chinese government and its promises to preserve Hong 
Kong's entrepreneurial freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
Following news of the Beijing massacres, Hong Kong investors in recent days 
have increased investments in U.S. and other overseas savings deposits and 
Treasury securities, experts say. Bankers also report widespread conversions of 
Hong Kong dollars into U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies. Some of this 
investment helped boost prices of the U.S. dollar and Treasury bonds Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong share prices Monday registered their worst loss since the worldwide 
market collapse in 1987, but rebounded slightly Tuesday. The Hang Seng Index of 
blue chip stocks closed at 2,149.71, up 56.1 from Monday, when it fell 581.77. 
Meanwhile Tuesday, the Hong Kong dollar continued to come under strong selling 
pressure as investors sought a safer haven in the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
"You are seeing funds being transferred out of Hong Kong into a lot of 
short-term investments" such as one- or three-month certificates of deposit, 
said an official of a large multinational U.S. bank who handles clients from 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Some Hong Kong investors also are inquiring about American real estate in the 
wake of reports that prices of some real estate in Hong Kong have dropped as 
much as 20% in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how fast it's happened," said Clifton K. Chang, a partner at 
Altair Investment Co., a Los Angeles real estate development and investment 
firm. He noted that some Hong Kong investors flew here just in the past two 
days to investigate commercial properties in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"In Hong Kong, business runs on fear and greed," Chang said. "For the past two 
years, greed's been driving it. For the past week, fear's been in." 
</P>
<P>
Any continued capital outflow, experts say, would reflect more than just fears 
that China may renege on its promise to maintain the capitalist system in Hong 
Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Heightened capital flight also would reflect a redirection of Hong Kong 
investment away from China. Hong Kong has been the largest foreign investor in 
China, surpassing Japan and the United States. But Hong Kong investors, like 
those anywhere else, prefer nations with political and economic stability, 
conditions which may no longer be assured in China. 
</P>
<P>
New outflows also could reflect the growing international exposure of the new 
generation of Hong Kong business leaders. Many are in their 30s and 40s, 
studied in the United States and have many friends here. 
</P>
<P>
Taking capital out of Hong Kong is not difficult. Many large U.S. and European 
banks maintain branches there. A Hong Kong resident can simply open an account 
and have funds wired overseas for safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
Or a Hong Kong resident can buy deposits in the form of Eurodollars -- a term 
for U.S. dollars deposited outside the United States, says Cheng of Cathay 
Bank. They pay higher rates, but the money is still considered to be in Hong 
Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Some wealthy Hong Kong investors also have created "shell" corporations to 
invest their money in such unregulated havens as the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
Canada also is another popular destination of Hong Kong money, because that 
nation grants immigrant visas and eventual citizenship to Hong Kong residents 
who invest large sums of money there. Canada also pays high interest rates, 
averaging about 13% to 14% for large multimillion-dollar deposits, versus about 
9% to 10% in the United States, said one U.S. banker. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the lure of overseas havens, many Hong Kong investors don't yet 
appear to be rushing to take out all their money, wanting to see how things 
shake out in Beijing, bankers said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a lot of wait-and-see attitude right now, (waiting) to see 
which way this is going to go and who is going to take charge," said one U.S. 
banker with Asian operations. 
</P>
<P>
However, a surge of interest among Hong Kong investors in Southern California 
real estate could reverse recent buying patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong real estate investors -- while continuing to make acquisitions -- had 
kept a lot of their money back home because Hong Kong real estate prices had 
risen as much as 25% to 35% a year, real estate developer Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Hong Kong investors generally have not purchased "showcase" 
properties in North America, as have the Japanese. Two notable exceptions were 
the purchase of the Beverly Wilshire Hotel by a Hong Kong investment firm and 
the acquisition of the Vancouver world's fair site by wealthy Hong Kong 
industrialist Li Ka Shing. 
</P>
<P>
But Chang predicted that Hong Kong real estate investments here now could surge 
in the next six months, because Hong Kong investors -- unlike the Japanese -- 
move quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong guys are traders at heart," Chang said. "Wherever the winds are 
blowing they are quick to sense it and react. Two years is long term for the 
Hong Kong guys." 
</P>
<P>
Added Chang: "Some of the people who were interested before but said, 'Now is 
not the time,' are now saying 'Now is the time.' "

JAMES FLANIGAN: INDUSTRY LIKELY TO BE A POSITIVE FORCE IN CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
"We are producing as usual, and there are the usual traffic jams on the roads 
into China," said Patrick Wang in a telephone chat Tuesday from his office in 
Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Wang, 39, is managing director of Johnson Electric Industrial Manufactory Ltd., 
a firm that makes tiny motors for automobile parts and household appliances -- 
and has most of its assembly work done over the border from Hong Kong, in 
Shenzhen, China. 
</P>
<P>
But Wang is not panicking. He does not believe that the current strife will 
cause China, the land of his birth, to close down business operations or its 
contacts with the outside world. Nor does Wang see a bleak future for Hong 
Kong, which is holding a general strike today to protest the Chinese military 
killings of Chinese students. "Whoever is going to take over in China, has got 
to manage an economy," says Wang, "There is a mutual dependency between Hong 
Kong and China." 
</P>
<P>
Wang is expressing a businessman's positive logic: That China's need for jobs 
and economic development will protect its relationships with Hong Kong, the 
mountainous territory and island on China's southern coast that has been a 
British colony for almost 150 years. 
</P>
<P>
Short term, that China-Hong Kong relationship is a bit like the border industry 
relationship of Mexico and the United States. More than 1 million factory hands 
in China's Guangdong province work for Hong Kong manufacturers. Their wages of 
50 cents an hour are low by Hong Kong, and world, standards. But to the 
Chinese, they often represent the first cash income and the promise of a better 
life in a country with one of the lowest living standards on earth. Gross 
national product per person in China is only $300, compared to $9,400 per 
person in Hong Kong -- and $17,000-plus in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Tied Down 
</P>
<P>
In eight years, however, the China relationship will change profoundly as Hong 
Kong reverts from British to Chinese rule, a prospect that is frightening many 
Hong Kong people and -- particularly this week -- leading them to send their 
money out or emigrate. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Wang's company is investing in Hong Kong. "We're still expanding, in Hong 
Kong, in China, in Thailand," he says. Which makes sense because Wang's 
company, like most modern industry, doesn't really have to fear for its life. 
It can bring jobs and development to China, or any place else it locates. But 
if a government pushes it around, it can move its computer-aided manufacturing 
elsewhere. Its real assets are its brains and its access to world money 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson Electric was founded 30 years ago by Wang Seng Liang, a textile 
industrialist who left Shanghai and set up a business in Hong Kong making 
motors for toys. Now 75, Wang Seng Liang has turned management of the business 
over to his children, Patrick, an engineering graduate of Purdue, daughter 
Winnie, an Ohio University graduate, and son Richard, a Berkeley graduate who 
heads Johnson's U.S. office in Fairfield, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
And the younger generation has developed Johnson into a citizen of the world. 
Johnson's micromotors now power Mercedes Benz windshield wipers and Black &amp; 
Decker small appliances. Morgan Stanley, the U.S. investment bank underwrote a 
Johnson financing last year and the company, now at roughly $130 million in 
sales, has research facilities in Switzerland as well as Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an exciting world these days," says John S. Wadsworth, a Morgan Stanley 
&amp; Co. managing director. "The free capital markets are financing operations 
in communist China and free Asia that serve markets in Western Europe and the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
That world of open trading and mobile capital is the reason that the people of 
Hong Kong and Korea know living standards today that were only dreamed of a 
generation ago. 
</P>
<P>
But it is that world's offer of the same for China's people that is being 
threatened by near-civil war and brutal suppression. 
</P>
<P>
Scholars do not underestimate the ability of politics to smother economics -- 
particularly in China, which has closed up many times in its history. "After 
last weekend, all bets are off, although it is useful to remember that some 
army factions do favor economic reform." says Richard Baum, a UCLA political 
science professor. 
</P>
<P>
But neither should the positive logic of business be underestimated. The 
question in China today is whether Guangdong workers, having tasted at least 
the beginning of rising living standards, can be shunted back to subsistence 
agriculture and village grimness. Genies are hard to put back in bottles. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's why production continues as usual and why Patrick Wang, reminded 
that he can move his business anywhere, says, "Sure, but we like it here in 
Hong Kong."

NO PLANS TO HYPE PROMISING ANEMIA TREATMENT; 
</P>
<P>
AMGEN PLAYS IT COOL DESPITE CLAMOR OVER EPO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY STAVRO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The phone calls start coming in at 6 a.m. at Amgen's headquarters in Thousand 
Oaks. Since Thursday, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave Amgen the 
go-ahead to sell its new biotechnology drug called erythropoietin (EPO), there 
have been more than 1,000 calls from doctors, patients and drug distributors 
who all want to know when they are going to get their hands on the new drug. 
</P>
<P>
EPO, which treats chronic anemia in patients with kidney disease, is "the most 
important development since dialysis" in treating kidney disease, says Dr. 
Allen Nissenson, a professor at the UCLA school of medicine. The drug may also 
combat various types of anemia, including those suffered by patients with 
cancer or AIDS. "This is a wonder drug," says Peter Drake, a biotechnology 
analyst with Vector Securities, who expects the total EPO market in the United 
States to reach $600 million a year by the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
While doctors can't wait to buy the drug, stock brokers are in a mad rush to 
trade Amgen's stock. Since the start of last week Amgen's stock price has 
surged 20%, closing Tuesday at $46.50. But amid all the clamor, Amgen's 
executives have been playing it cool. Instead of talking up how much EPO they 
can sell, the company is calmly and methodically following the marketing plan 
it laid out 12 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not hyped this drug. We've tried to understate what the potential is 
and to make sure our statements are conservative," said Amgen's president, 
Harry Hixson Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Amgen is trying to avoid the great-expectations-gone-bad that scarred 
Genentech's reputation last year. The San Francisco company seemed to have a 
can't-miss biotech drug with TPA, a blood clot-dissolving drug used to treat 
heart attack patients. Wall Street expected Genentech to sell $400 million of 
TPA last year, but instead Genentech sold less than half that, and sales were 
so slow that at year-end the company had to destroy some of its TPA inventory. 
During the past 20 months, Genentech's stock has sunk from about $47 to $18.875 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But analyst Drake says EPO is "totally different." Unlike TPA, he says, there 
are no major uncontrollable side effects from EPO, the medical value of the 
drug is clear-cut, and while there are conventional heart drugs that cost 
one-tenth the price of TPA, there is no alternative to EPO. 
</P>
<P>
One that reason Amgen remains cautious is that the company figures it will have 
a head start of only four-to-six months selling EPO. Chugai-Upjohn, a joint 
venture between mighty Japanese and American pharmaceutical companies, is 
expected to get FDA approval later this year to sell its version of EPO. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Amgen's goal is to get EPO into the hands of its primary 
market -- kidney dialysis patients -- and build up some old-fashioned brand 
loyalty for its product, which will be sold under the name Epogen. Brand 
loyalty in biotechnology? "It's no different than if you're selling sneakers," 
says Mark Brand, Amgen's director of communications. 
</P>
<P>
Amgen's first shipments of EPO, packed in blue ice to keep it refrigerated, 
went out Friday via Federal Express. Dale James, drug inventory manager for 
FoxMeyer, a Dallas-based drug distributor, expects her first shipment of EPO 
today. "This drug is going to move," James said. "Our largest hospital account 
in Kansas City has been asking for a shipment since last Friday." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Licensing Fees 
</P>
<P>
After Chugai-Upjohn starts selling EPO, Hixson says it's "reasonable" to expect 
Amgen to control 70% of the kidney dialysis market. Chugai-Upjohn, he says, 
will have "to go to the patients and say our drug is better than the one you've 
been receiving. Our belief is that the patients will say, 'I'm doing fine and I 
feel wonderful. Why should I change?' " 
</P>
<P>
Drake figures that Amgen's head start will ensure Amgen about $150 million a 
year in EPO sales from the kidney dialysis market, with more coming from 
licensing fees. (Amgen has licensed sales of EPO for all other uses in the 
United States to a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson.) 
</P>
<P>
EPO is a protein produced in the kidneys that triggers the production of red 
blood cells, which transport oxygen throughout the body. People with kidney 
disease can't produce enough red blood cells, so they suffer debilitating 
anemia. 
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 people in this country must endure kidney dialysis several times 
a week. They are attached to a machine so the toxins can be filtered from their 
blood. About 25,000 of those patients also need frequent blood transfusions, 
and doctors say that virtually all those getting transfusions, and a majority 
of the remaining dialysis patients, are prime EPO candidates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boosts Energy 
</P>
<P>
By March, Amgen had booked about $15 million worth of orders from drug 
wholesalers, as word spread in the medical community about the splendid EPO 
clinical test results. For the past 20 months Robert Klein, 66, of North 
Hollywood, has been treated with EPO as part of a clinical test and he is 
enthusiastic about the drug. 
</P>
<P>
For the first 12 weeks of the trial half of the 96 patients in Klein's test 
group, he says, were injected with EPO; the others got placebos. "After the 
first week I knew I was on the real thing," Klein said. "I was able to walk two 
miles, swim 20 laps at an Olympic-sized pool. I went to the clinic and said, 
'Hey, I'm on the real thing.' You could tell. The energy level is tremendous. 
You jump up and down like Howdy Doody." 
</P>
<P>
Klein still needs dialysis treatments, but like most EPO patients he almost 
never needs blood transfusions, and so avoids the risk of getting AIDS or 
hepatitis from a tainted blood supply. 
</P>
<P>
However impressive EPO is medically, it is an expensive drug, likely to cost 
from $4,000 to $8,000 per patient per year. Dr. Steven Tucker, a nephrologist 
in Anchorage, Alaska, wants the drug for his dialysis patients, but he says, "I 
can't order it yet because a major question is who is going to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
The payment question is critical because EPO seems like a promising treatment 
for a wide variety of anemia. Dr. David Golde, head of hematology and oncology 
at UCLA, is testing EPO on AIDS patients who are taking the drug AZT, which has 
various side effects including anemia. And Golde says EPO seems to help. About 
40,000 Americans take AZT and Golde says a majority of them could be candidates 
for EPO, and that's only the start. "It's just a matter of time before EPO is 
widely used for a number of other indications," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The final details of the federal government's EPO reimbursement program won't 
be settled until next week. But Charles Booth, director of payment policy for 
the federal Health Care Financing Administration, says Medicare will pick up 
most of the cost for EPO -- about 80% he suggests -- for those suffering from 
chronicly low red blood cell counts, no matter what the disease. 
</P>
<P>
How much will EPO cost the government? A year from now Booth guesses that the 
government's tab will hit an annualized rate of $175 million. As EPO use 
becomes more widespread, he concedes, that figure will rise. How high? "There 
is no precedent for this," Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker figures the government's EPO bill will eventually be closer to $1 
billion a year. "From a medical standpoint it will be very difficult, if not 
impossible, to deny anybody this drug." 
</P>
<P>
Given how cautious Amgen's forecasts are, could the company be caught short by 
a big demand for EPO? After all, it takes Amgen about four months to make a 
batch of EPO because the gene-spliced cells incubate slowly. 
</P>
<P>
Hixson says that being cautious isn't the same as being unprepared. "We already 
have one year's inventory of bulk drug made. It's in frozen concentrate. We 
have at least $100 million worth." In its final form, he says, EPO has a 
two-year shelf life.

Clorox Puts Unit Up for Sale: Clorox Co. put its $106.8-million Olympic stain 
and Lucite paint business on the block, conceding that the subsidiary failed to 
live up to expectations. Clorox said it would solicit offers for its Olympic 
HomeCare Products subsidiary, which manufacturers and markets Olympic wood 
stains and Lucite interior and exterior house paint. Clorox bought Olympic in 
1981 for $123 million and added the Lucite brand in 1983 for $50 million. The 
products, although profitable, have performed poorly compared to the rest of 
Clorox's product line. This year, analysts expect the subsidiary's sales to 
drop to $100 million or less. One analyst said the division had only a 50% shot 
of turning a profit.

Fugitive Still Being Paid Agricultural Subsidy: A company owned by fugitive 
Marc Rich from U.S. justice has received more than $65 million in payments from 
the U.S. Agriculture Department and continues to benefit from American farm 
export subsidies, a congressman charged. Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) said Rich, 
owner of Richco Grain Ltd., is under criminal indictment but his firm continues 
to receive payments from the department to underwrite grain exports. Richco 
Grain is based in Zug, Switzerland, but has an office in Stamford, Conn. The 
Kansas Democrat said Rich faced a 65-count indictment on "a litany of criminal 
charges, ranging from tax evasion to fraud to dealing with the enemy." Rich now 
lives in Zug.

CNW OKs Buyout Offer: CNW Corp.'s board approved a $1.6-billion buyout offer 
from a group that includes company management, railroad company Union Pacific 
Corp. and other investors, prompting hostile suitor Japonica Partners to 
withdraw its own offer. The buyout group formed by investment banker Blackstone 
Group, which will hold a controlling interest in the railroad company, agreed 
to pay $45.50 cash per common share in cash and $4.50 per share of preferred 
stock. CNW stock jumped 75 cents to close at $47.50 a share in New York Stock 
Exchange composite trading. Based on about 19 million CNW shares outstanding 
and the assumption of CNW debt, the management group valued its buyout plan at 
$1.6 billion.

$104 Billion Given to Charity in '88: Americans gave $104 billion to charity 
last year, almost 7% more than 1987 and 1.8% ahead of the inflation rate, 
according to a report by the American Assn. of Fund-Raising Counsel. The 
association, which represents fund-raising counseling firms, said the total was 
up $6.55 billion over 1987. Individuals provided about $87 billion, foundations 
$6 billion and businesses $4.8 billion. Bequests -- gifts willed by the 
deceased -- amounted to $6.8 billion. Religious institutions and causes 
received the largest share of donations, $48 billion, with education, health 
and human services and cultural organizations getting most of the balance.

Prime Computer said Tuesday that it will meet with MAI Chairman Bennett S. 
LeBow for the first time since MAI launched a hostile bid for Prime nearly 
seven months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Prime, a Natick, Mass., minicomputer maker, also said that, in light of a 
recently revised offer by MAI, it has rescheduled its annual meeting from June 
14 to July 26. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the moves are likely a sign that Prime has been unable to come up 
with a "white knight" bidder or another plan for escaping MAI's offer. The 
postponement of the annual meeting, at which time MAI had planned a proxy fight 
to try to replace Prime's board, will buy the company more time to find an 
alternative to MAI's offer, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Prime said its three-member executive committee will meet with LeBow. A date 
was not specified. 
</P>
<P>
MAI, a Tustin computer maker, launched a bid of $1.3 billion, or $20 per share, 
for Prime in November. The takeover bid has been stalled much of the time since 
by various legal challenges thrown up by Prime. 
</P>
<P>
After Prime challenged MAI to show that it could obtain financing for the deal, 
MAI lowered its bid last week to a combination of cash and securities. MAI 
values the new bid at $19.50 per share, although several analysts have 
estimated the value at about $17 to $18.

AT&amp;T DENIES PARTNERSHIP WITH NINTENDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. denied reports Tuesday that it has 
reached a partnership agreement with Nintendo Co., the Japanese video game 
manufacturer, to provide consumers with a variety of information services. 
</P>
<P>
An AT&amp;T spokesman insisted that discussions with Nintendo have been limited 
to normal business contacts between a vendor and a potential customer. He said 
that while AT&amp;T would be happy to have Nintendo as a customer, there has 
been no agreement on joint development or marketing of any new services. 
</P>
<P>
Nintendo said in a prepared statement that while no "concrete agreements" had 
been reached, the company "feels very positively about its discussions with 
AT&amp;T in the evolution of communications network technologies." The 
statement went on to note that AT&amp;T "is currently prohibited from entering 
into arrangements involving the development of electronic information services" 
under the terms of a court order due to expire in August. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported Monday and the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that 
AT&amp;T and Nintendo would work together to develop a new electronic 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
Nintendo, which revolutionized the video game business with a computer-driven 
box that plays specially designed games, has indicated that it wants to tap the 
capabilities of the 19 million Nintendo devices now in American homes. The 
book-size boxes could easily be combined with a television to provide 
computerized access to information services such as stock prices, home shopping 
services or travel information networks.

STUDIES CONFLICT ABOUT FARES FROM HUB AIRPORTS 
</P>

<P>
Average airline fares have decreased at most major airports, with competition 
increasing substantially since deregulation a decade ago, according to an 
industry study released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But another report by the General Accounting Office to be released at a Senate 
hearing today says airlines charge an average of 27% more per passenger mile on 
flights to and from 15 major hub airports than to other airports included in 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
The airline industry report said that average fares have decreased since 
deregulation in 1978 and that fares at 30 hub airports are only 1.5% above the 
industry average. That study says hub fares are a little higher primarily 
because hubs tend to have more nonstop flights. 
</P>
<P>
Both studies are to be discussed today at a hearing of the Commerce, Science 
and Transportation subcommittee on aviation, which is examining the airline 
practice of feeding many flights through a single airport. 
</P>
<P>
The study by the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, says competition has 
decreased at some airports because major airlines are dominating the market 
where they have hub operations. 
</P>
<P>
"Many travelers have less choice among airlines as more markets are being 
controlled by a single airline," says an advance copy of the study obtained by 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
The report says although the number of destinations served from hub airports 
studied increased 10% between May, 1985, and May, 1988, most of the increases 
were by dominant carriers and were offset by large service reductions by other 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
At 13 of the 15 hubs studied, average air fares per passenger mile (one paying 
passenger carried one mile) were higher for dominant carriers than for other 
airlines serving the same airports, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hubbing generates important operating efficiencies, but it can also lead to 
substantial market power for the airlines, which could lead to higher fares and 
reduced levels of service," GAO official Kenneth M. Mead said in testimony 
prepared for the subcommittee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The industry study conducted by the aviation consulting firm of Simat, 
Helliesen &amp; Eichner concludes that competition in individual markets has 
increased despite the greater concentration within the industry and at some 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
The study commissioned by the Air Transport Assn., which represents major 
airlines, concludes that there is little, if any, relationship between average 
fares and airline concentration at either hub or non-hub airports.

LINCOLN S&amp;L'S PARENT OFFERS PLAN TO REPAY ITS CREDITORS IN FULL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The corporate parent of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan outlined a 
bankruptcy reorganization plan Tuesday that promises to pay off shareholders, 
bondholders and other creditors in full -- but over time and at a reduced 
interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of American Continental Corp., unveiled the 
proposal at the first hearing of the company's creditors in Phoenix, where it 
is based. 
</P>
<P>
On April 13, American Continental and 11 subsidiaries of Lincoln Savings filed 
for court protection from creditors while reorganizing under Chapter 11 of the 
federal bankruptcy law. The savings and loan itself could not file a bankruptcy 
petition; federal regulators seized Lincoln the next day, saying its parent 
company was operating the S&amp;L unsafely and was dissipating its $5.3 billion 
in assets. 
</P>
<P>
That a tentative reorganization plan was offered so early in a complex 
bankruptcy case was somewhat unusual, bankruptcy experts who attended the 
hearing said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reorganization Attempt 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers who have filed class actions against Keating and others on behalf of 
corporate shareholders and bondholders were quick to call for details of the 
plan, and one questioned the wisdom of any reorganization that kept Keating at 
the helm. (Under Chapter 11, a company's current management normally remains in 
control while a plan to repay creditors is worked out.) 
</P>
<P>
American Continental's proposal, Keating said, is an attempt to start the 
process of negotiating a reorganization plan that would repay creditors and 
enable the company to continue some operations. 
</P>
<P>
Most of American's 22,000 creditors are bondholders and would be particularly 
interested in a reorganization plan that pays them back in full. That is 
because they hold $200 million in subordinated debentures, junior debts of the 
company, and stand near the end of the line to get repaid in bankruptcy 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these debt holders are Southern Californians who bought bonds through 
Lincoln Savings branches, and dozens of them went to Phoenix for Tuesday's 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The reorganization outline calls for the formation of a new privately held, 
Keating-led company, Phoenician Holdings Inc., to purchase all the stock of 
American Continental and buy the largest of 11 Lincoln subsidiaries that were 
also placed in bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan outlined Tuesday, junior bondholders would get 11-year notes 
bearing 5% interest a year. A special $20-million fund would be created 
immediately to pay those holders who could show hardship to an independent 
administrator of the fund. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Hurdle for Keating 
</P>
<P>
Other creditors holding secured and senior unsecured debts would be paid in two 
years at the same 5% rate. 
</P>
<P>
Those holding preferred stock and common stock -- other than corporate insiders 
-- would get new American Continental preferred stock that pays the 5% rate and 
must be redeemed in 12 to 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
Current directors and other insiders would get new American Continental 
preferred stock that would pay no dividend and would be redeemed only after all 
other debts are paid. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously good news if they come up with a reorganization plan, but we 
certainly have to see if there are sufficient funds available to make the plan 
viable," said Ronald Rus, a lawyer in Orange who represents a group of 
bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
One of the big hurdles Keating faces is winning control of the Lincoln 
subsidiary he wants. 
</P>
<P>
Under his plan, he would have to negotiate with the regulators to purchase 
Amcor Funding Corp. at a "fair market price." The subsidiary holds more than 
$855 million in assets, including a 20% interest in General Oriental 
Investments Ltd., an international trading company run by British financier Sir 
James Goldsmith, and owns American Founders Life Insurance Co.

QUOTABLE QUITTERS; 
</P>
<P>
GOING IN STYLE: THOSE NOTABLE EXITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Going in style: As recent events have pointed up, it's not always whether you 
win or lose but how you bow out. 
</P>
<P>
Charged with multiple ethics violations, House Speaker Jim Wright, who formally 
left his post Monday, didn't just go quietly; he protested his innocence in a 
memorable and tearful speech to the House: "Let me give you back this job you 
gave to me as a propitiation for all of this season of bad will, . . . I don't 
want to be a party to tearing up this institution -- I love it." 
</P>
<P>
Going in style. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey Bogart did it, in the 1943 Oscar-winner "Casablanca," sending Ingrid 
Bergman off with Paul Henreid with these parting words: "Here's looking at you, 
kid." And, of course, Clark Gable as Rhett Butler did it in "Gone With the 
Wind," walking out on a distraught Scarlett O' Hara with the immortal exit 
line, "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn." 
</P>
<P>
Edward, Duke of Windsor, did it with elegance. Abdicating his throne to marry 
American divorcee Wallis Warfield Simpson, he told British subjects in a radio 
broadcast on Dec. 11, 1936: "I have found it impossible to carry the heavy 
burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as I would wish to 
do without the help and support of the woman I love." 
</P>
<P>
Richard M. Nixon, on the other hand, having lost the California gubernatorial 
race in November, 1962, snarled at the press, "You won't have Nixon to kick 
around any more because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference." 
</P>
<P>
After mounting reports of ethical problems, Rep. Tony Coelho of Merced stunned 
everyone last month with his resignation, only hours after his press spokesman 
had said Coelho planned to jump into the race for House majority leader "with 
both feet." Instead, Coelho quit, saying, "I don't intend to put my party 
through more turmoil. I don't intend to put this institution through more 
turmoil. And more importantly, I don't intend to put my family through more 
turmoil." 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Douglas MacArthur did it with style -- twice. Forced to flee Corregidor in 
March, 1942, he proclaimed, "I shall return." Almost a decade later, fired by 
President Harry S. Truman in a dispute over conduct of the Korean War, 
MacArthur delivered a ringing oratory before a joint session of Congress, 
declaring, ". . . Old soldiers never die; they just fade away." 
</P>
<P>
The late Shah of Iran gets credit for exiting with understatement. Fleeing 
revolution-torn Tehran in January, 1979, he said, "I am going on vacation 
because I am feeling tired." 
</P>
<P>
And former President Lyndon B. Johnson, battered by national divisiveness over 
the war in Vietnam, scored style points for his televised speech on March 31, 
1967, in which he told a surprised nation: ". . . What we won when all our 
people united must not now be lost in suspicion, distrust, and selfishness or 
politics among any of our people . . . accordingly, I shall not seek and I will 
not accept the nomination of my party for another term as your President. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
It was election night, 1966, and Dick Tuck, having lost his bid for a seat in 
the California Senate, stepped to the microphone to deliver his speech of 
concession: 
</P>
<P>
"Well," he said, "the people have spoken -- the bastards." 
</P>
<P>
Now, that's going in style. 
</P>
<P>
In their 1981 book, "Doing it With Style," international eccentric Quentin 
Crisp and writer Donald Carroll observed, "There are two distinct groups of 
people who are virtually precluded from having style: politicians and 
criminals. Actually, as recent political history has taught us, the two groups 
are more distinct from the rest of us than they are from each other." 
</P>
<P>
Politicians, they argue, depend for their very survival on the opinion of 
others, something a stylist never frets about. But, they concede, "The ability 
to make a great speech will compensate for just about any shortcoming." 
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. Sen. S. I. Hayakawa, a semanticist by trade, never did quite get 
the speech making right. There was his unforgettable pronouncement about the 
poor not being affected by rising gasoline prices because the poor didn't need 
gas anyhow. 
</P>
<P>
Hayakawa, a septuagenarian with a penchant for dozing off during Senate 
sessions, told an interviewer after losing to Pete Wilson in 1982 that he left 
with few regrets: "There was too much to do, too much to pay attention to. Very 
often, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I would be trying to remember what I had 
been doing that morning. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
A basic tenet of stylishness, in the view of Crisp and Carroll, is the 
necessity of bowing out of public life with finality. They believe, "You cannot 
play peekaboo with the world," though Greta Garbo did, as did Abbie Hoffman, 
and does J. D. Salinger. "If you want to vanish with style, you must leave 
behind a vacuum so absolute and so dramatic that the world will be forever 
tantalized by your withdrawal from it." 
</P>
<P>
The principle applies, presumably, to retirements and job departures, voluntary 
and otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
From the annals of sports come some unforgettable exit lines. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball great Lou Gehrig, terminally ill with the disease that would be named 
after him, told the crowd on Lou Gehrig Day at Yankee Stadium, July 4, 1939: 
"On this day I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth." 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Henry Aaron, announcing his decision to retire, 
explained: "You can only milk a cow so long, then you're left holding the 
pail." 
</P>
<P>
And heavyweight Jerry Quarry hung up his gloves with this explanation: "I want 
to leave boxing with a little bit of looks and the ability to talk." 
</P>
<P>
As the old joke goes, "You're fired." "I quit." 
</P>
<P>
In his book of strategy, "The Termination Trap," psychiatrist Dr. Stephen 
Cohen, who has worked extensively with individuals caught in the job loss 
experience, offers practical survival tips for the just-fired. 
</P>
<P>
Among them: Do not pretend to the person who fired you that it does not hurt. 
Don't fuel the fire between you and your ex-boss. Do not go to a bar. Avoid 
acting on the inclination to run away. And: Be aware that "some people, afraid 
for their jobs, may shrink from you as if you were contagious." 
</P>
<P>
If you decide to fight for your job, Cohen advises, "Be assertive, do not worry 
about your trembling voice and hands or your wobbly knees. If you elect this 
route, you have to go with the drama of it all. It's fair to beg, plead, 
cajole, negotiate . . . this is your final card. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Another expert advises: "Race to the bank" and take out the biggest possible 
personal loan. Once you're off the payroll, no bank will touch you. 
</P>
<P>
Does one seek revenge? Usually unwise. Try to keep the firing an ugly secret? 
Usually impossible. 
</P>
<P>
In the film, "Willard," Willard, an office clerk, was fired by his mean boss. 
Willard chose revenge. He returned to the office with a suitcase full of 
trained rats, which, on command, attacked the boss, causing him to fall, 
screaming, through an open window to the pavement below. But that's the movies. 
</P>
<P>
In real life, more subtle strategies may be called for. If your boss invites 
you to get together at an airport on a Friday, cautions one expert, "You are 
doomed. Miss your plane." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Cunningham wasn't fired; she quit. After a meteoric rise to a vice 
presidency of the Bendix Corp. at age 29, she resigned in October, 1980, citing 
the pressure of "unfounded rumors" and "malicious gossip" concerning her 
romantic involvement with Bendix Chairman William Agee, 42. Agee, for his part, 
assured his employees that "her rapid promotions are totally justified." 
Nineteen months later, Cunningham and Agee married. 
</P>
<P>
Vanessa Williams, the first black Miss America, was forced to relinquish her 
crown in July, 1984, after Penthouse magazine told of plans to publish nude 
pictures taken of her two years earlier in sexually explicit poses with another 
woman. Williams, protesting that the pictures were never intended for 
publication, said: "It is one thing to face up to a mistake one makes in youth. 
But it is almost totally devastating to have to share it with the American 
public and the world at large, as both a human being and as Miss America." 
</P>
<P>
Going in style. Capt. Queeg didn't pull it off, rambling on during his "Caine 
Mutiny" court-martial that the trouble aboard the Caine had to do not with any 
shortcoming on his part but with problems in the ship's laundry and a sloppily 
run ship's mess. 
</P>
<P>
Neither did deposed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, who on heading into 
exile in March, 1986, said he left his country because "I have no heart to shed 
Filipino blood." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Paar's departure in a huff as host of "The Tonight Show" in February, 
1960, was more puzzling than provocative. Assailing the NBC "idiot" who cut him 
off the air during an anecdote network officials thought was in bad taste, Paar 
said angrily, "I believe I was let down by this network at a time when I could 
have used their help." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli Premier Golda Meir's explanation for resigning in 1968 at age 70 was 
neither eloquent nor lofty. Meir said simply, "I want to be able to read a book 
without feeling guilty and go to a concert when I'd like . . . but I do not 
intend to retire to a political nunnery." 
</P>
<P>
Convicted spies Ethel and Julius Rosenberg protested their innocence loudly to 
the end. In a letter to their defense attorney, she declared, "My husband and I 
shall die innocent before we lower ourselves to live guilty!" The Rosenbergs 
were executed. 
</P>
<P>
Heretic Mormon-turned-feminist Sonia Johnson, explaining in 1981 her break with 
the church, said, "I couldn't help feeling uneasy that the church was opposing 
something with a name as beautiful as the equal rights amendment." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the more stylish ultimate departures are chronicled by Malcolm Forbes 
in his book, "They Went That-A-Way." 
</P>
<P>
Consider the departure of John Jacob Astor IV, a passenger on the Titanic on 
its ill-fated voyage of 1912. Giving up his place in the lifeboat to women 
passengers, he insisted, "The ladies have to go first." Then, lighting a 
cigarette, he waved to his young bride -- "Goodby, dearie. I'll see you later." 
</P>
<P>
Amelia Earhart told a reporter in 1937 shortly before taking off on her final 
flight, "I have a feeling there is just about one more good flight left in my 
system and I hope this is it." It wasn't. Earhart, attempting to fly around the 
world, disappeared in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
But Marie Antoinette garners style points for her exit line. It is told that 
the French queen, moments before her beheading in 1793, stepped upon her 
executioner's foot, whereupon she said, "Monsieur, I beg your pardon."

FOR SENIORS, EXTRA INTEREST AT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

If you're approaching senior citizen status -- which seems to be anywhere from 
55 to 65 these days -- you might want to see what your bank or savings and loan 
is offering in discounts to this age group. Chances are, you'll find a wide 
range of options, from free checking services to higher-interest-bearing 
savings accounts and CDs, from credit cards with no annual fees to discount 
travel programs, auto accident insurance or free photocopying services. 
</P>
<P>
"I call it the consumer battleground of the 1990s," banking consultant Michael 
Sullivan of Charlotte, N.C., said of the trend to give older Americans discount 
programs. "Everybody's going to be getting in on it, banks, savings and loans, 
credit unions," Sullivan said. "At a recent banking seminar I asked people what 
services they might offer if they were starting a new bank and one guy said 'a 
dating service, because there are a lot of lonely people out there.' I can just 
see it -- the First Mature Bank or the At Long Last Love National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is definitely toward 50 plus." 
</P>
<P>
Be careful to read the fine print about these "free" programs. There are no 
California or federal regulations that require either banks or savings and 
loans to offer them to a specific age group, or to have uniform account balance 
requirements to qualify for such an account. Also, financial institutions don't 
go out of their way to advertise these programs. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're seeing is most aggressive marketing that seems to be geared toward 
the higher income, older American," said Kent Brunette, a lobbyist for the 
American Assn. of Retired Persons in Washington. "There's a tremendous 
variation from institution to institution. Our concern is that there needs to 
be a uniform standard regulated by the federal government." 
</P>
<P>
Brunette, representing AARP, and officials of other consumer-oriented groups 
testified in favor of passing such uniform standards before the U.S. Senate 
Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs this week. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, many banks and savings and loans require you to have your Social 
Security check directly deposited electronically before you get the discount 
checking, or to maintain a specific balance in your checking account -- 
generally from $100 to $1,000 -- or also to have a savings account there. 
</P>
<P>
Others won't even cash your Social Security check unless you have enough money 
in your account to cover the check; some charge a set fee or percentage of the 
face value of the check to cash it. 
</P>
<P>
On the whole, though, if you shop around, there are some discount deals to be 
had for the over-55 crowd. 
</P>
<P>
And the age limit for these perks has been spiraling downward -- from 65 to 62 
to 60 to 55. Even the AARP has lowered its membership age to 50. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a trend across business, across society," said First Interstate Bank's 
John Popovich, who initiated a free checking for seniors program 10 years ago. 
For customers 62 and over, First Interstate, unlike many financial 
institutions, does not require seniors to keep a set balance in their checking 
account in order to qualify. "There is no set amount, no demeaning 
qualifications," Popovich said. "It's much easier to give it across the board 
to those 62 and over." 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate, one of California's four largest banks, along with Security 
Pacific, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, offers in its senior checking 
program: no monthly service charge, unlimited check writing, free personalized 
checks, free domestic travelers checks, reduced rates on most simple interest 
personal loans such as car loans, and reduced fees for safe deposit boxes, 
subject to availability at your branch. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific and Bank of America also have free checking plans for 
customers over 62, but they are not as inclusive as First Interstate's. Wells 
Fargo does not have a specific program for seniors offering no-fee checking. 
</P>
<P>
"We treat each senior on an individual basis, like other individuals," a Wells 
Fargo spokesman said. "We will go to seniors' homes or retirement residences 
and do their banking for them, but we have no specific program. We leave that 
up to the personal banking officer in the branches." 
</P>
<P>
The push for the mature banking consumer is becoming quite competitive, most 
industry spokespersons agree, so much so that the age requirement for the 
special accounts has been lowered by some financial institutions to 55. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Savings and Valley Federal, both savings and loans, have reduced their 
age limit to 55 for free checking and other programs for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara Bank and Trust Co. is a forerunner in the bank club market, 
beginning its Our Gang program 15 years ago for customers over 60. To qualify 
for Our Gang's reduced group travel rates, free checking, health seminars and 
financial planning advice, its senior customers must maintain a $1,000 balance 
in the checking account or $2,000 in savings or $5,000 in an IRA, Money Market 
or CD. 
</P>
<P>
Banking consultant Sullivan is co-chairing a conference in New York City on 
Thursday and Friday to help bankers develop new strategies for appealing to 
mature customers. In August, he also will publish a banker-geared book on the 
subject called "Banking on the Mature Market Customer." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, a former banker, pointed out that the baby boom generation is now 40, 
so in 15 years, the boomers will be mature banking customers and banks will 
need to appeal to them to get their business. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, he explained, banks are offering these programs to mature customers 
"out of community relations," because the over-50 consumers currently have 80% 
of all savings deposits in the nation's 14,000 banks and 3,000 savings and 
loans. "But they will be doing it out of marketing soon. It's going to be good 
for the consumer, because banks are going to have to work harder to get their 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Banking trends will continue, Sullivan said, toward more of the all-inclusive 
programs that some financial institutions are already making available -- 
senior clubs through banks that offer a myriad of services, among them discount 
travel programs, discount medicines and eyeglasses, reduced brokerage costs, 
accident insurance, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Can bank-sponsored dating services be truly far-fetched?

With video transmissions from Beijing banned, the networks have had to resort 
to Vietnam-era methods of covering the violence there, with news footage flown 
by courier to outside satellite points for relay here. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, the networks can also do what the wire services routinely did 
from Saigon even at the bloody height of the 1968 Communist Tet Offensive -- 
transmit still pictures of the carnage, bravery and brief moments of peace. 
</P>
<P>
Such pictures, including ABC's dramatic shot Monday morning of a lone Chinese 
civilian boldly stopping a line of tanks in Tian An Men Square, have become 
American viewers' first glimpse of the stories that network correspondents are 
describing live by phone from Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
The pictures are aired well before videotape footage makes the five- to 
seven-hour trip from Beijing to Tokyo and Hong Kong for satellite relay to the 
networks and subsequent broadcasts in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
According to network officials, the still pictures are taken from the videotape 
footage and transmitted from Beijing via phone lines by image-scanning 
"pixelator" devices -- pixel is shorthand for "picture elements" -- that are 
similar in operation to a fax machine, digitally transforming the picture into 
information bits and reassembling them at the other end of the line. 
</P>
<P>
ABC sent its dramatic man-against-tank still picture (Associated Press also had 
a similar shot from one of its photographers) via a Sony-developed PromaVica 
that the network sent to Beijing only last Friday, said Robert Seigenthaler, 
ABC technical operations president. 
</P>
<P>
It was promptly put in use to send still shots of the army crushing the long 
demonstration of students and others in Beijing over the weekend, with the 
video footage aired several hours later. 
</P>
<P>
A similar image-scanning device used by CBS is a Quickpix machine, jointly 
developed by CBS and Kodak, and has been used by Beijing staffers for about a 
month, CBS News vice president Don DeCesare said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The technology is about two or three years old, network officials said. Some 
broadcasters also are using an electronic still camera that records images on 
video tape rather than film. 
</P>
<P>
Wire services such as Associated Press also still are able to transmit 
black-and-white and color photographs via phone lines from Beijing. The 
networks use some of those photos as part of their coverage. 
</P>
<P>
But not many, DeCesare said. Since the CBS machine "is working so well and we 
get such high-quality, high-resolution photos that are our own, we obviously 
tend to use our own pictures." 
</P>
<P>
During the Vietnam war, there was no satellite transmission facility in Saigon 
and the networks, which then used film, not tape, shipped their news footage to 
Hong Kong or Tokyo for satellite relay. There are satellite facilities in 
Beijing, but save for a one-day respite on May 22, Chinese authorities have 
banned all video transmissions from them since martial law was declared May 20. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese, however, haven't cut off phone communications that allow broadcast 
and written reports and still pictures to reach the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
Network executives are both puzzled and relieved that that last electronic plug 
hasn't been pulled. All are keeping their fingers crossed that, whatever 
happens this week in Beijing, Chinese authorities won't cut off phone lines to 
the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
As John Chancellor, who covered China's bloody cultural revolution years ago, 
put it Tuesday on NBC's "Today" show, "we may never have this access again if 
they decide to shut it down."

KCET LOOKS AT REGION'S FUTURE WITH 'YEAR 2000' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MICHAELSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KCET Channel 28 will produce a new half-hour documentary series examining major 
issues affecting Southern California and their implications for the region by 
the year 2000, officials at the public-television station said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The series, debuting July 12 at 7:30 p.m. and airing on subsequent Wednesday 
nights, will be called "By the Year 2000." It will tackle such issues as 
pollution, transportation, aging, demographics, housing prices and the use of 
crack. The first program explores how the global "greenhouse effect" can change 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
To focus its energy on the new series, the public-television station said, it 
is dropping the 17-month-old "California Stories," another documentary series 
that dealt primarily with arts and science issues. 
</P>
<P>
Those subjects will now be dealt with in "Take Five," a five-minute program at 
7:30 p.m. four nights a week that is replacing "7:30," the station's nightly 
five-minute news program. 
</P>
<P>
KCET will continue its Emmy-winning "KCET Journal" documentaries and its "Los 
Angeles History Project" series. "KCET Journal" will report on an AIDS hospice 
in August or September, and the "History Project" plans four programs for the 
coming season. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very proud of this effort," Stephen Kulczycki, vice president of 
programming at KCET, said of the scheduling changes. "We're hitting a stride of 
what public television can do." 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that the local programming budget would grow from its present $7 
million level to $9 million for the fiscal year that begins July 1 -- including 
a grant of $750,000 from the James Irvine Foundation for "By the Year 2000." 
</P>
<P>
"By the Year 2000" will be co-hosted by Eric Burns and Valerie Zavala, and 
produced by Celeste Durant. The series will repeat Saturdays at 5 p.m. and 
Sundays at 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Durant said that among the topics the show will tackle are euthanasia, which 
"most experts say will probably be legal by the year 2000"; the explosion of 
crack on Los Angeles County streets, with estimates that there could be 250,000 
addicts by 2000, and the explosion in housing prices from the current average 
home cost of $217,000 to an estimated $476,000 by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
She said she hopes the programs will deal not only with problems but also with 
possible solutions to them. 
</P>
<P>
"Take Five," five-minute reports and features, will have a different focus each 
night. Monday will be arts and culture. Tuesday is devoted to science issues -- 
everything from the nuclear winter to a look at why cats purr. Thursday is 
talk-back night, a sort of weekly "letters to the editor" segment about KCET 
and its program schedule. Friday will offer new segments of "Videolog," the 
station's six-year-old series of "short vignettes which celebrate the unique 
people and places of Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, beginning June 19, the local news report that has been part of 
"7:30" will be broadcast weeknights at 7:28 p.m., immediately following "The 
MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to their normal broadcasts, "By the Year 2000" will occasionally 
air 90-minute specials, and "Take Five" will have quarterly half-hour specials 
in arts and culture, science and "Videolog." 
</P>
<P>
To inaugurate the changes, KCET is offering "premiere weeks" in June with 
half-hour specials on Monday nights in a particular field. The week of June 19 
will be devoted to arts and culture; the week of June 26 will deal with science 
issues, and the week of July 3 will offer "Videolog." 
</P>
<P>
Once the premieres are done, the series "Wild, Wild World of Animals" will air 
in its old time slot at 7:35 p.m. following "Take Five" on Monday, Tuesday, 
Thursday and Friday.

BECKER, EDBERG ADVANCE TO SEMIFINAL MATCHUP

<P>
Once again in the French Open, it was Stefan Edberg's day on clay, which is 
happening too often lately to be a mere coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
Sweden is famous for producing clay-court players and Volvos, and it's looking 
more and more as if there could be another Roland Garros champion rolling off 
the Swedish assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Edberg model is a modified version of the typical Swedish sedan. 
He prefers the fast track. 
</P>
<P>
But on a rainy afternoon, on the damp, slow clay of center court, Edberg 
overwhelmed Alberto Mancini of Argentina and advanced to a semifinal showdown 
with Boris Becker of West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg's 6-1, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) victory Tuesday was only the latest example of his 
newfound confidence in playing the same surface on which countryman Mats 
Wilander won here last year. 
</P>
<P>
Becker eliminated Jay Berger, 6-3, 6-4, 6-1, leaving Michael Chang as the lone 
remaining American in the men's competition. Becker's victory avenged a 6-1, 
6-1 loss to Berger in March at Indian Wells, the worst defeat of the West 
German's career. 
</P>
<P>
The Edberg-Becker semifinal will be a rematch of last year's Wimbledon final, 
which Edberg won in four sets. 
</P>
<P>
After dispatching Mancini, a noted clay-court player, Edberg, is 13-1 on clay. 
But there were indications two weeks ago that Edberg is no pushover on slow 
surfaces. He beat Guillermo Perez-Roldan of Argentina in straight sets at Rome. 
</P>
<P>
It was Perez-Roldan who knocked Edberg out of last year's French Open with a 
straight-set victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe you can serve and volley on this stuff," he said of the clay courts. 
"(Yannick) Noah proved that in 1983 when he won (the French Open). With the 
game I have, I have to serve and volley, my own game, what I do best." 
</P>
<P>
In the women's competition, two rain interruptions and 17-year-old Spaniard 
Conchita Martinez threw Steffi Graf slightly off her game. But as surely as the 
rain stopped and the sun came out, Graf won and reached the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Had it not been for the rain, Graf's 6-0, 6-4 victory would have seemed 
routine, although Martinez caused her a few anxious moments. 
</P>
<P>
After pitching a 27-minute shutout in the first set, Graf got into trouble when 
showers halted play as she led, 3-2, in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez was up, 40-0, at 4-4, but Graf forced deuce and won the game when 
Martinez made two straight errors. 
</P>
<P>
Graf said she felt better about that match than the others. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure you want to have longer rallies, an opponent who doesn't give you so many 
easy shots," she said. "OK, it shouldn't have been that close, but I was much 
more into it." 
</P>
<P>
Her semifinal opponent will be Monica Seles, the 15-year-old Florida-based 
Yugoslav, who defeated sixth-seeded Manuela Maleeva of Bulgaria, 6-3, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Said Seles: "I won't say I won't be scared playing Steffi because I will. She's 
the best player in the game. I'll have to play unbelievably well." 
</P>
<P>
Graf, 19, the oldest of the semifinalists, is looking forward to playing the 
younger Seles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new face and it's a good thing for tennis," Graf said. "We need it. It 
gets boring, week after week, if you always talk about Navratilova, Evert, Graf 
and Sabatini. This makes it more fun and interesting for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
In the other women's semifinal, 17-year-old Mary Joe Fernandez of Miami will 
play 17-year-old Arantxa Sanchez of Spain. Fernandez, seeded 15th, defeated No. 
10 Helen Kelesi of Canada, 6-2, 7-5. Sanchez, seeded seventh, beat No. 11 Jana 
Novotna of Czechoslovakia, 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez will be making her first semifinal appearance in a Grand Slam event. 
</P>
<P>
"Doing well this year will mean a lot to me in the future," Fernandez said. "It 
hasn't hit me yet. I'm just going to wait to let it sink it." 
</P>
<P>
After the first two sets of the Mancini-Edberg match, it was Mancini with that 
sinking feeling. The number that Edberg hung on him was something of a 
surprise, especially to Mancini. 
</P>
<P>
"Six-one, 6-3 is not a normal score," said Mancini, who expressed appreciation 
for Edberg's play, especially his serve on clay. 
</P>
<P>
"The bounce is very high," Mancini said. "It is very difficult to return. And 
when you do hit the ball, he's already at the net, so it's then very difficult 
to pass him." 
</P>
<P>
Mancini's only chance to get back into the match was in the third-set 
tiebreaker. As in the rest of the match, Edberg played aggressively, and 
Mancini stayed on the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
Serving at 2-3, Mancini made two errors -- a long forehand from the baseline 
and a wide backhand from the same spot. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg double-faulted to 5-4, but Mancini missed a backhand passing shot. 
Mancini saved the first match point with a lob that Edberg couldn't touch. Then 
Edberg closed it out when Mancini returned his second serve long. 
</P>
<P>
After playing Davis Cup on clay and increasing his training to include 
long-distance running, Edberg said he feels as at home on clay as his Swedish 
contemporaries. 
</P>
<P>
"I know you can't play perfect," Edberg said. "You'll have a few bad bounces. 
You just have to accept that. 
</P>
<P>
"The big difference is, I believe I can maintain a high level the whole 
tournament. It's looking good this year."

<P>
The morning after, Michael Chang slept late, got a massage, hit tennis balls 
for about 20 minutes at a private club, then watched it rain. 
</P>
<P>
While a dejected Ivan Lendl left for London on a rainy Tuesday morning, Chang 
awoke as the toast of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
A color photo of him falling to the ground on match point filled the front page 
of the newspaper L'Equipe. At the top of the page, this headline greeted him: 
Chang l'incroyable! 
</P>
<P>
 Chang the incredible, all right. His five-set upset victory over Ivan Lendl in 
the French Open Monday was reported worldwide by the hundreds of journalists 
who are covering the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a sampling of what was written. 
</P>
<P>
Klaus-Peter Witt, Bild, Munich -- "His legs were cramping. He had tears in his 
eyes. And he prayed. The kid, Michael Chang, 17, looked like he would rather 
die than lose." 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Folley, Daily Express, London -- "Ivan Lendl fled from center court in 
tears here last night, humiliated by a cramp-crippled teen-ager serving 
under-arm." 
</P>
<P>
E. Trier Hansen, Politiken, Copenhagen -- "The youngest one ate bananas and 
poured water into himself while he crushed the biggest one. Afterward, Paris 
went totally bananas." 
</P>
<P>
Murray Hedgcock, the Australian, Melbourne -- "No matter whatever else Michael 
Chang achieves in his career, he shall forever have this brilliant moment that 
will go down in tennis history." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps no newspaper was more impressed by Chang's victory over Lendl and 
painful leg cramps than L'Equipe, the French daily newspaper covering sports: 
</P>
<P>
"The small mosquito Chang stung the man who frightens children, Lendl. . . . 
Chang was near death, but then he took his heart in both hands, said a prayer 
and his prayer was answered." 
</P>
<P>
Chang played the entire fifth set with muscle cramps in both thighs. That he 
not only continued to play, but also went on to beat Lendl, the No. 1 player in 
the world, seems to have struck an emotional chord in France and other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Austin, Chang's agent at Advantage International, decided that his client 
needed rest rather than more exposure. Austin turned down requests from "Good 
Morning America" and "CBS Morning News" for live interviews with Chang. 
</P>
<P>
Austin had all the calls to Chang's room switched to his own. "The phone 
stopped ringing about 1 a.m. and began again about 6," Austin said. "I'm just 
going to sit back and enjoy this tournament. I think Michael's got a real good 
chance at getting to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I think he's going to win it." 
</P>
<P>
That would really be incroyable. THOMAS BONK

<P>
All the Lakers are saying is that guard Byron Scott, who missed the opener 
Tuesday night, will also miss Thursday night's Game 2 of the National 
Basketball Assn. championship series with a partially torn left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Robert Kerlan, the Lakers' physician, said before Game 1 there is a 
distinct possibility that Scott will miss the entire series against the Detroit 
Pistons after suffering the injury in practice here Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It might be (the entire series), but we're just specifically committed to the 
first two games," Kerlan said. "I don't think we'll be able to say more until 
we examine him again before Sunday's game." 
</P>
<P>
Kerlan said Scott's injury is more severe than the partially torn left 
hamstring that sidelined teammate Magic Johnson for nearly three weeks in 
February. If the finals go to the maximum seven games, Scott would have only 
two weeks in which to come back. 
</P>
<P>
Scott said before Tuesday night's series opener that he was injured in a 
collision with teammate David Rivers during a routine rebounding drill. 
</P>
<P>
"He kind of grabbed my arm when I was going up for a rebound," Scott said. "I 
came down a weird way, all on my left side. When I landed, I felt a pop in the 
left hamstring. It was just a freak thing that happened." 
</P>
<P>
Scott has had ice treatments, electronic stimulation and treatment with a 
device called a probe, which shoots jolts of electricity into the injured area. 
</P>
<P>
"That probe is no fun," Scott said. "But they are doing just about everything 
they can to help me. I've got the stimulation thing on 24 hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
Scott did not seem optimistic about being able to play in this series. 
</P>
<P>
"In the situation I'm in, it might be that I won't play at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's disappointing, because I think we, as a unit, were ready for this series. 
But having this happen is devastating, personally. I was tossing and turning 
all last night, asking myself, 'Why me?' Those are questions you can't answer." 
</P>
<P>
Scott said that intense workouts in Santa Barbara last week did not contribute 
to the injury. 
</P>
<P>
"I was feeling great," Scott said. "I was feeling in better shape for this 
series than during the regular season." 
</P>
<P>
What will Scott's role be now? 
</P>
<P>
"I'll have to give the fellows some type of support, no matter how I feel," he 
said. "I'm still part of the team. I'm kind of a Wes Matthews (former Laker 
bench-warmer and cheerleader) right now." 
</P>
<P>
When the Lakers arrived in the visiting team's locker room in the Palace two 
hours before Tuesday night's game, they were greeted by a dart board covered 
with pictures of the Pistons' Bill Laimbeer and Rick Mahorn. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers said they did not know who to thank for the gift. 
</P>
<P>
Read my lips: One TV reporter was making the rounds in the Piston locker room 
asking several of the players how they would keep the win in perspective, to 
keep from getting too excited with three victories still needed. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, "How do you tell yourself this is only one win?" 
</P>
<P>
"Like this," forward John Salley said. " 'It's only one win.' Now you try it." 
</P>
<P>
The reporter did. 
</P>
<P>
"The English language is amazing, isn't it," Salley said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons led at halftime, 55-48, but they braced for the worst. According to 
some of the Detroit scouting, the best was yet to come from the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a good third-quarter team," guard Joe Dumars said. "They usually put 
teams away in the third quarter. We didn't want to have a letdown." 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons didn't. The Lakers scored only 18 points in the period, their worst 
12-minute output of the night.

WORTHY'S MISSES MAKE THE PISTONS' NIGHT

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Laker forward James Worthy launched a baseline jumper a minute into the opening 
game of the NBA Finals against the Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
It was an airball, and an indication of what lay ahead for Worthy. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy missed his first five field-goal attempts before he finally sank a shot 
with 3 1/2 minutes remaining in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime James Worthy misses his first five shots you know it's going to be a 
long night," said Laker Mychal Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
And it was a very long night for the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
"James Worthy had a rough start," Coach Pat Riley said. "I think he put too 
much pressure on himself. But he's been very good in the playoffs and he'll 
come back." 
</P>
<P>
A model of consistency throughout his career, Worthy was dreadful in the 
Lakers' 109-97 loss to the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy, who had shot 60.3% going into the game, made just six of 18 shots 
(33%). He had been averaging 24.3 points before Tuesday but scored only 17 in 
Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
What happened? 
</P>
<P>
"I got good shots," Worthy said. "I was trying to rush them. I've just got to 
relax. Things like this happen. You can't dwell on shots being missed. The 
shots I missed tonight are going to fall." 
</P>
<P>
Worthy took a big fall early in the game when Piston forward Rick Mahorn 
knocked him down on a drive to the basket. As a matter of fact, Mahorn's 
aggressive defense took Worthy out of the Laker offense all night. 
</P>
<P>
Mahorn forced Worthy, who normally sets up under the basket on the right side, 
to move farther away from the basket. 
</P>
<P>
"Mahorn played James very physically early in the game," said Bill Bertka, 
Laker assistant coach. "Mahorn took away James' favorite spot in the low block 
on the right side." 
</P>
<P>
Mahorn, however, refused to take all the credit for stopping Worthy. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of help from my teammates," Mahorn said. "I can't stop him by 
myself. I needed help." 
</P>
<P>
Mahorn got it from John Salley and Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
"Rick did a tremendous job on Worthy in the first half," Rodman said. "He kept 
him out of the box down low. He took Worthy out of his rhythm. But Worthy is a 
great player." 
</P>
<P>
Worthy demonstrated that last year by getting 36 points, 16 rebounds and 10 
assists against the Pistons in Game 7 of the 1988 NBA Finals. Worthy was named 
MVP of the series. 
</P>
<P>
But Mahorn, hampered by a back injury, watched Worthy destroy the Pistons while 
lying on his stomach on the sidelines. Mahorn had been lying in wait for a 
year, and Tuesday played relentless defense on Worthy. 
</P>
<P>
"They had Mahorn pushing James around," Thompson said. "But James just didn't 
make his shots. He'll probably take the same shots and made six or seven in a 
row the next game." 
</P>
<P>
The absence of guard Byron Scott, who missed the game with a partially torn 
left hamstring, severely hampered Worthy's effectiveness. It allowed the 
Pistons to double-team Worthy more often. 
</P>
<P>
"They played good defense, but when you don't have Byron, we have just two 
scorers, me and James," Laker guard Magic Johnson said. "And they can 
double-team us more." 
</P>
<P>
Said Worthy: "You always expect double-teaming. And it wasn't any different 
tonight. You can't dwell on it." 
</P>
<P>
But the Pistons think Worthy can recover. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't say that we stopped James Worthy," Mark Aguirre said. "Everyone has a 
tough night. And I know that James Worthy is going to try to come back even 
stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Said Piston Coach Chuck Daly: "I don't know if you can ever stop a guy like 
Worthy. You just work hard and hope he doesn't hit his shots." 
</P>
<P>

STUDENTS PLAN PROTESTS OVER KILLINGS IN CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Students at UC Irvine plan two demonstrations today to protest the killing of 
Chinese students in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
At noon in UCI's Gateway Plaza, the Republic of China Student Assn. has 
scheduled a protest gathering, according to Colleen Bentley-Adler, a university 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
At 8 p.m., also in Gateway Plaza, a candlelight vigil sponsored by several 
groups will mourn the deaths of the Chinese students. 
</P>
<P>
UCI has one of the largest Asian-American enrollments in the nation. About 30% 
of UCI's 15,800 students this academic year are Asian-Americans, according to 
enrollment figures. 
</P>
<P>
The university also has many visiting Chinese professors and students, 
Bentley-Adler said. Some of the visitors worried initially about having to 
return to mainland China, now reportedly near civil war. But President Bush has 
extended the length of time that the Chinese students may stay in this country. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, there are going to be quite a few who feel their situation is in 
limbo," Bentley-Adler said. "I think the biggest agony for these visitors from 
China is wondering about friends and relatives back there." 
</P>
<P>
She said that some UCI professors who had planned to go to China this summer as 
exchange scholars have canceled their plans. 
</P>
<P>
"We also have some professors who planned to go there and would still be going 
there, but now they are not being allowed entry by China," Bentley-Adler 
explained.

IRVINE VALLEY COLLEGE PICKS INTERIM PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anna L. McFarlin, vice chancellor of administrative services for Saddleback 
Community College District, has been named interim president of Irvine Valley 
College. 
</P>
<P>
McFarlin, who has been with the district since 1969, was recommended by 
Chancellor Richard Sneed and approved by the board of trustees at a meeting 
Monday night. She replaces Ronald A. Kong, who resigned last week to become 
president of Alameda College in Northern California. Kong's resignation is 
effective July 1. 
</P>
<P>
McFarlin, who was dean of students at Irvine Valley College before assuming the 
district vice chancellor's post in 1987, started as a counselor at Saddleback 
College in 1969. She founded the Saddleback College women's center the 
following year and then moved to the counseling staff at the new Irvine Valley 
College in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Valley College had an enrollment of 7,087 students last fall.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EXPANSION OF TRASH RECYCLING BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A major expansion of the city's curbside recycling program began Monday with 
sanitation workers delivering special trash containers to Westchester 
households. 
</P>
<P>
Under the recycling plan, residents are being asked to place cans, glass 
containers and plastic items in separate trash cans, said Gyl Elliot, a 
spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the pilot study, some residents are receiving 12-gallon containers 
and others are getting 14-gallon ones, she said. Residents are also being asked 
to save newspapers for a once-a-week pickup. 
</P>
<P>
The trucks will then take the materials to vendors for purchase, Elliot said, 
adding that the revenue will be used to pay for the program. 
</P>
<P>
During the next few weeks, sanitation workers will drop off the canisters at 
homes in Wilmington, the Crenshaw District, South-Central Los Angeles and the 
Cheviot Hills and Beverlywood areas of West Los Angeles to bring the total to 
32,000 households.

MARINE CORPS ORDERS 2-DAY SAFETY COURSE FOR ALL PILOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Because a recent string of military aircraft accidents can be largely blamed on 
human error, the commandant of the Marine Corps on Tuesday ordered all Marine 
pilots to leave their cockpits for a two-day safety refresher course over the 
next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Alfred M. Gray Jr. said in the seven recent accidents, which claimed the 
lives of 45 Marines, "air crew error predominates and most likely will be a 
primary cause in all these mishaps." 
</P>
<P>
Aircraft and crews based at Tustin and El Toro Marine Corps air stations in 
Orange County have been involved in three of the fatal helicopter accidents, 
accounting for 25 of the fatalities. One of the accidents involved a Marine 
Corps reserve unit based at El Toro, and the other two in South Korea involved 
personnel and an aircraft from the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing at El Toro and 
Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time to pause, catch our breath and come to grips with the devastating 
trend established this year," Gray said in a Teletype message to Marine bases 
worldwide. "To that end, within the next two weeks, all aviation units will 
conduct a two-day safety stand-down. 
</P>
<P>
"Our machines are not letting us down; we are letting ourselves down," Gray 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Donald E.P. Miller, commander of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing at El 
Toro, said he has instructed his group and squadron commanders to complete the 
refresher course by June 17. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to shut them all down at once for the two days of instruction, 
but that is impossible," Miller said, adding that he has some aircraft in the 
middle of missions. "I think it is a hell of a good idea. I think we have to 
stop once in a while and say, 'Are we doing this right?' " 
</P>
<P>
Gray's order affects 1,200 Marine Corps fighters, observation planes and 
helicopters in 87 aviation squadrons worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
"His concern is the number of deaths so far this year," said Lt. Col. Fred Peck 
in Washington. Peck said Gray's action ordering all Marine Corps aviators to 
the classroom was unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been done squadron-wide or even wing-wide, but, the best I can 
determine, never before Marine Corps-wide," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The order came less than six months after Marine Corps aviators completed the 
safest flying year ever. Only 27 Marines died in all of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The preservation of our most precious war-fighting assets, our Marines, 
demands that we be ruthlessly honest with ourselves, (ensure) strict 
accountability and redirect ourselves to excellence," Gray concluded in his 
message. 
</P>
<P>
Gray said the refresher course will re-examine and emphasize the "air crew, 
wingman, and supervisory functions surrounding the conduct of a professional 
flight -- from schedule writing through final shut down. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
On March 17, a CH-46 Sea Knight helicopter assigned to an annual combat 
readiness exercise in South Korea crashed and killed four Marines from El Toro. 
Three days later, three more El Toro Marines died in the crash of a CH-53 Sea 
Stallion during the same exercise. In all, 19 Marines were killed in the crash 
of the CH-53. Both of those accidents happened when the weather was good and 
the skies clear. 
</P>
<P>
A collision on May 27 of two CH-46 helicopters near Fallon, Nev., killed two 
female Marine reservists stationed at El Toro. That accident also occurred on a 
clear day. The two aircraft were flying in formation when the blade of one 
helicopter clipped the other, killing the two Marines. 
</P>
<P>
On May 3, five Marines died when a Huey helicopter crashed during a nighttime 
exercise in France. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent Marine helicopter accident occurred May 30 when a CH-46 crashed 
into the Pacific Ocean during a takeoff from the cruiser Denver south of 
Okinawa. Thirteen Marines and a sailor from Huntington Beach were killed and 
eight others were rescued, several of them injured. 
</P>
<P>
The only fixed-wing aircraft accident this year involved a AV-8B Harrier that 
crashed at Parris Island, S.C., and killed the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
It is unusual for the military to discuss the causes of accidents before the 
official investigation is completed. Those investigations can take as long as a 
year. But a Marine source said Gray's comment that pilot error is the most 
likely cause of the fatal accidents this year was "necessary under the 
circumstances."

NEIGHBORS REJECTING OLIVE BRANCH OVER PLAN TO RAZE SCHOOL; 
</P>
<P>
180 APARTMENTS PROPOSED ON LAND USED FOR CLASSES FROM 1876 TO 1984 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Residents near historic Olive Elementary School want to stop plans by the 
Orange Unified School District to tear down the school, one of the oldest in 
the county, and replace it with an apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
The school, first opened in 1876 but rebuilt over the years, has not been used 
for five years because of declining enrollment. At a community picnic to 
commemorate the last day of classes there in June, 1984, district officials 
promised neighbors in the Olive district that the building would not be torn 
down. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, however, neighbors of the site on Magnolia Avenue near Bixby 
Avenue in the north tip of the city were surprised to learn that the district 
is well along in plans to tear down the buildings and convert the land into 
income-producing apartments. 
</P>
<P>
"The residents of this area are up in arms," said Dorothy Gibson, who is 
helping to organize the effort to stop development. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Kay, another resident of the Olive district, said neighbors first learned 
of the plans through a letter they received in April from a company called 
Newport Resource Management, which had apparently been hired by the district to 
discuss the proposed project with neighbors one by one. 
</P>
<P>
"They showed us a fancy layout, with about 180 apartments," Kay said. "It was a 
professionally done layout. That kind of raised our hackles. We started 
organizing. 
</P>
<P>
"People feel pretty strongly about this. There's nobody here at all who thinks 
putting those apartments here is a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
Residents plan to meet tonight at the school to begin a petition drive seeking 
to block the zoning change that would be needed to build the apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Kay and the other opponents said the district provided little public notice 
about the intent to change the property's use. 
</P>
<P>
But district officials said they provided ample public notice and discussed the 
best use for the land at many open meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dollars-and-cents thing," said John Perry, assistant superintendent for 
business services. "What the school board is saying is that the findings they 
have show that the district really does need some revenue off that site." 
</P>
<P>
Orange Unified, which has long complained that it receives less money from the 
state per student than many surrounding districts, has also faced declining 
enrollment at many schools. In the mid-1980s, declining enrollment forced the 
district to close two other schools besides Olive. One of those, Katella 
Elementary, may reopen soon, but Perry said demographic studies indicate that 
there will not be a need for more classroom space near the Olive site for a 
long time. 
</P>
<P>
The Jubilation Bible Fellowship leases the site for $74,000 a year, but 
district trustees voted last month to cancel the lease because "the district 
has plans to develop the Olive School site from its present use to one of 
several alternative uses," the agenda item read. "All of the alternative uses 
would include the demolition of the current site." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Sappington, administrator in charge of special projects for the district, 
and Perry both said the land would generate much more income with apartments 
than it would with continued rental of the school buildings, and the school 
district would retain control of the property. 
</P>
<P>
District officials are exploring a plan in which a developer would lease the 
land and build apartments. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting less than $75,000 now, but we could probably expect to generate 
as much as $700,000 a year off a formal lease," Perry said. "Our purpose is to 
put that money back into the schools to modernize them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighbors Retain Voice 
</P>
<P>
Perry said neighbors should be glad that the district wants to continue owning 
the land because that gives them a voice in the quality of the project built 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"We can assure the community that the project will be in the best interest of 
the area, to make sure it's not a slumlord project," he said. "Also, that it's 
a pride to the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Jack McKee, acting director of the Community Development Department, said the 
district's tentative plans call for about 150 apartments, or 18 units per acre. 
</P>
<P>
Perry said part of the property would be developed into a children's cultural 
center and a day-care facility. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors, however, said they feel betrayed and pointed to a 1984 report by a 
school district panel advising that building homes on the property would be an 
"unacceptable use." 
</P>
<P>
Perry said he is not familiar with that report. But, he said, "probably in 1984 
we hadn't identified that need (for more revenue). Now we have a crying need 
for that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sappington Was Heard 
</P>
<P>
Residents organized a meeting two weeks ago to hear from Sappington about the 
district's plans. There was standing room only, said Wayne Gibson, who has 
written a book about the history of Olive School. 
</P>
<P>
"If there had been tar and feathers there, Sappington might have worn some," he 
said. "It could very easily have reached the point of a public debacle." 
</P>
<P>
Residents also seek a historical designation for the site because although the 
original buildings are gone, the auditorium was built in the 1930s under the 
Works Progress Administration. 
</P>
<P>
While Kay and the others said they know that the district needs more money, 
they said they do not want it to be at their neighborhood's expense. 
</P>
<P>
"I prefer to think of it as the school board raping and pillaging this area," 
Kay said, "so they can go and build something in the eastern section of the 
district, like in Anaheim Hills."

WOMAN TIED TO JUDGE IS HELD IN COCAINE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

A woman linked to the investigation of Municipal Judge Calvin P. Schmidt has 
been arrested on suspicion of selling a kilo of cocaine to an undercover police 
officer, the Costa Mesa Police Department said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Tom Boylan said Terri Ann McMullen, 28, was arrested at her apartment on 
16th Street in Newport Beach at 5:40 p.m. Monday. Boylan said narcotics 
officers also arrested two men who were in her apartment at the time, Pedro 
Diaz Chavez, 22, and Paul Padilla, 27, both of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
All three were arrested on suspicion of selling cocaine and conspiracy to sell 
cocaine, Boylan said. 
</P>
<P>
Boylan confirmed that McMullen is the woman whose controversial release from 
jail by Schmidt last year added to allegations that the judge showed a pattern 
of preferential treatment for certain defendants. Schmidt came under fire for 
ordering McMullen released from jail in March, 1988, and also last October 
after she had been arrested on drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen is the stepdaughter of M. Robert Guggenheim, a Newport Beach 
philanthropist. Schmidt ordered her released on her own recognizance despite 
being advised by officers that she was a bad risk because of a history of 
failing to appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, Schmidt justified his actions by saying that 
McMullen was a member of the Guggenheim family and that the "defendant's 
parents were wealthy." 
</P>
<P>
Campaign-spending reports show that Guggenheim made a $500 contribution to 
Schmidt in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The California Commission on Judicial Performance announced last Dec. 10 that 
it had ordered a formal hearing on allegations of misconduct against the 
Newport Beach judge. The hearing is scheduled to be held in August. 
</P>
<P>
Boylan said McMullen and her two associates were arrested after a weeklong 
undercover operation. He said an officer got a tip that McMullen was dealing in 
cocaine, and the officer began negotiating with her. He added: 
</P>
<P>
"The undercover officer was negotiating to buy from 2 to 5 kilos of cocaine, at 
$15,000 a kilo. When a deal was made for 1 kilo, she was arrested at her 
apartment, along with the two men who were there. We think Chavez was the 
delivery boy." 
</P>
<P>
McMullen was taken to County Jail and bail was set at $100,000. Boylan said 
that Chavez and Padilla were in Costa Mesa Jail in lieu of $25,000 each. They 
are scheduled to be arraigned this morning.

REPORTED SHAKE-UP IN TOLLWAY AGENCY DENIED

County tollway board members Tuesday disputed reports that Executive Director 
John Meyer may be forced to step aside or share his duties with someone new. 
Instead, they said Meyer has been considering personal options and will propose 
a change in his job at Thursday's regular board meeting in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer's fate, said Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young, "is up to the personal 
desires of John Meyer." 
</P>
<P>
Young, who is board chairman of the Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridor 
Agency, declined to elaborate except to say that a Times story published 
Tuesday indicating that Meyer was under pressure to relinquish or share his 
post "was absolutely inaccurate." Young also said there would be no meeting 
early Thursday of a so-called tollway personnel committee to discuss Meyer's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no personnel committee," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Young's comments were at odds with those of four board members who told The 
Times on Monday that moves were afoot that would result in Meyer either leaving 
the top post or transferring some of his duties to someone new. 
</P>
<P>
Those same board sources did not return a reporter's telephone calls Tuesday, 
but another tollway board member said that Meyer talked to friends last week 
about the possibility of resigning or becoming a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer could not be reached for comment Tuesday. A day earlier, however, Meyer 
said he had scheduled a closed personnel session for Thursday's tollway board 
meeting on his own behalf.

WASHINGTON SHOWS HE'S STILL IN SWING OF THINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Earlier this season, baseball didn't mean a whole lot to Claudell Washington. 
</P>
<P>
A .300-plus batting average and playing for a contender in a more sedate 
surrounding were secondary to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
His daughter Camille, a 15-year-old high school freshman, suffered a serious 
head injury last month back home in Orinda, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Camille was crouching while making her bed when she got tangled up with a lamp 
cord and the lamp came crashing down on her head. She suffered temporary 
paralysis and her condition was quite serious. 
</P>
<P>
Washington left the Angels to be with his family. It's what fathers do, even if 
they happen to be their team's leading hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an occupational hazard," Washington said Tuesday after hitting a solo 
home run to help the Angels beat Cleveland, 2-1, at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"The unfortunate thing about playing baseball is that you're away from your 
family a lot. Camille's older now and has to be in school and my family can't 
travel with me now. It's another adjustment you have to make," said Washington, 
who said Camille is fine now. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels kept winning while Washington was away -- from April 28 until he 
returned May 14. 
</P>
<P>
Before he left, Washington was riding a hot streak. A few days before the 
accident, his batting average stood at a lofty .311 and he had hit a 428-foot 
home run against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't miss a beat upon returning, even though he had every reason to do so. 
</P>
<P>
He remains the team's leading hitter with a .306 average. His home run, a high 
drive over the right-field fence, was his seventh, which ties him for the team 
lead with Devon White and Lance Parrish. 
</P>
<P>
On a team which seems to get the most out of the minimum offensively, 
Washington's contributions have been particularly important. Since joining the 
club as a free agent from the New York Yankees, he has helped push the Angels 
up from their last-place finish a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
He has helped the team become the No. 2 hitting club in the American League 
with a .268 team batting average. And that's why the Angels are doing what many 
would have considered unthinkable before the season began -- sitting in first 
place. The Angels lead Oakland by percentage points in the American League 
West. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing great baseball," Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
But Oakland is out there lurking in the Angels' minds. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason, it seems like every time we win, they win and every time we 
lose, they lose," Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
Washington kept up his end of the bargain Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
After Brian Downing grounded out in the first, Washington hit Cleveland starter 
Rich Yett's second pitch for a home run and a 1-0 lead. For a time, it looked 
as if it would be enough. Yett was locked in a duel with Angel starter Dan 
Petry. 
</P>
<P>
But the Angels added a run in the fifth and the Indians could only get one off 
Petry and relievers Greg Minton and Bryan Harvey.

<P>
Decisions, decisions, decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Hansell, Kennedy High School pitcher, thought he had met the ultimate 
challenge in a pressure-packed championship game at Dodger Stadium when he led 
the Fighting Irish to a 1-0 victory over Saugus for the Southern Section 3-A 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Hansell outdueled Saugus' heralded Roger Salkeld in a memorable nine-inning 
game and scored the game's only run, on a wild pitch. The victory was Hansell's 
13th of the season and 11th complete game of a remarkable senior season. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it's decision time. Should he follow his plan to play football and 
baseball at Nevada Reno, where he has signed a national letter of intent? Or 
should he sign a major league contract with the Boston Red Sox after he was 
drafted in the seventh round in baseball's amateur draft? 
</P>
<P>
Will Hansell report to football camp on Aug. 12, where he is projected as a 
linebacker at Nevada Reno? Or will he be playing for pay by the end of the 
month? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I'm going to do," Hansell said. "I plan to explore all my 
options and then talk things over with my parents and Coach (Chris) Pascal 
before I make any decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Hansell's future appeared to be on the football field. He was a 
standout linebacker and tight end for Coach Mitch Olson, leading Kennedy to a 
Division VI playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
But Hansell, The Times' baseball player of the year, might have taken a career 
U-turn. Hansell (13-1) struck out 123 in 96 innings and allowed only 17 earned 
runs. He also pitched a perfect game against Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
The championship capped off a great year," Hansell said. "The whole year was a 
team effort, and I wouldn't have accomplished anything without the help of my 
teammates." 
</P>
<P>
Hansell credited an improved curveball and increased velocity on his fastball 
-- which he mastered while playing for a Connie Mack team in Long Beach last 
summer -- for his banner season. He will play in the Orange County All-Star 
baseball game Tuesday and has been selected to play in the state all-star game 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Hansell was a three-sport star for Kennedy. He played basketball for two years 
and was a member of Kennedy's 3-A championship team last season. He said he 
enjoyed participating in all three sports during his high school career. 
</P>
<P>
"I like getting all my aggression out on the football field and the contact," 
he said. "I also liked the teamwork involved to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
"Basketball was a lot of fun. I played with a great group of guys and got to 
play on a CIF championship team as a junior. I'll never forget that season. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball is where I've had my most success and will probably be my future. It 
was so much fun we didn't want the season to end. The last couple of weeks, we 
actually looked forward to practice." 
</P>
<P>
Hansell, who will graduate with a 3.8 grade-point average, also has served as 
the school's student body vice president. He helped plan school dances, 
activities and assemblies during Kennedy's 25th anniversary.

CHARM-FILLED COCONUTS KEPT KENNEDY ROLLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a battle of extremely unofficial 4-A Division good-luck charms last week, 
can chalk up one for Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Cougars traditionally hang a pair of coconuts from the dugout wall 
at games. Thursday night at Dodger Stadium, the coconuts were sitting atop the 
third-base dugout as Kennedy beat Palisades, 4-3, for the City Section title. 
</P>
<P>
Hart brought its pair of good-luck horseshoes to Saturday's Southern Section 
final with Cerritos, and Coach Bud Murray hung them on the third-base dugout 
railing as soon as the team took the field for warm-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite using the same dugout and a similar superstitious theme as their 
City counterparts, Hart lost, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Horseshoes, of course, are easy to understand. 
</P>
<P>
But coconuts? Don't ask. 
</P>
<P>
More goals ahead: Morgan Bateman of Crescenta Valley reached one of his 
preseason goals when he placed third in the boys' 800 meters at the state track 
and field championships Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But the senior will travel to Hughes Stadium in Sacramento for the Golden West 
Invitational on Saturday in quest of another goal -- a breakthrough time in the 
800. 
</P>
<P>
Having run 1 minute, 53.94 seconds in the event as a sophomore and 1:52.66 as a 
junior, Bateman thought he was capable of running "at least under 1:52" this 
season. His best so far, however, is 1:52.37, which placed him third in the 
Southern Section 4-A Division championships. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a satisfying year in that I qualified for the state championships 
for the third year in a row and placed in the top three," said Bateman. "But I 
am a little disappointed that I haven't had that big breakthrough race yet." 
</P>
<P>
Bateman hopes that the Golden West meet -- which features some of the nation's 
top seniors -- will be that race.

Canadian brewers, worried that cheaper U.S. beer is grabbing a growing share of 
a stagnating market, have accused some U.S. rivals of dumping and are pushing 
officials to boost prices of the competing brands. 
</P>
<P>
"They are dumping and selling in Canada at a price less than their home 
market," said Howard Collins, a spokesman for the Brewers Assn. of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
But the brewers are unwilling to lodge an official complaint with the Canadian 
government, even though they say hundreds of jobs are threatened. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dealing With Liquor Boards 
</P>
<P>
The big three -- Molson Breweries of Canada Ltd., Carling O'Keefe Breweries of 
Canada Ltd. and Labatt Brewing Co Ltd. -- prefer to work out a deal with the 
liquor boards that distribute beer in most provinces. 
</P>
<P>
"We want them (the U.S. brewers) to pay more taxes or pay the full cost of 
distribution," Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said dumping is a difficult case to prove legally, which is 
why the brewers are lobbying for higher markups and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
In Ontario, the province where U.S. beer's surge is rising fastest, sales 
jumped to $17.3 million ($14.5 million U.S. dollars) in February, 1989, from 
$3.2 million ($2.5 million) a year earlier, according to Liquor Control Board 
of Ontario figures. 
</P>
<P>
U.S.-brewed beer's share of the $2.5-billion ($2.1-billion) Canadian market 
rose to 2.6% in 1988 from 2.1% in 1987, according to the brewers' group. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Labatt has a market share of just over 40%, Molson has about 
one-third and Carling, which is owned by Elders IXL Ltd. of Australia, has 
around 20%. If Molson and Carling receive government approval for a merger 
proposal made earlier this year, the combined firm will probably lead the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts and industry officials say that even though the U.S. brewers have only 
a tiny market share in contrast with the Canadians, the sudden growth could 
prove a threat because the beer market is flat. Sales are not rising anymore, 
they said, because of consumers' growing focus on health. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't pose much of a problem for the industry now, but these things have 
a habit of growing," said Martin Kaufman, of Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. beer producers, who also face growing health concerns, do not want to 
give up their share of the Canadian market. Officials at two of the firms 
singled out by the Canadian brewers -- G. Heileman Brewing Co., which makes 
Lone Star, and Stroh Brewery Co., which manufactures Old Milwaukee -- were 
quick to deny the dumping charges. 
</P>
<P>
A statement by Simon Marshall, director of international sales and marketing 
for Stroh, called the dumping charges "completely without foundation" and said 
consumers were drinking Old Milwaukee because of its high quality and good 
value. 
</P>
<P>
Old Milwaukee and Lone Star sell for about $4.50 ($3.65) for a six-pack in 
Ontario, which is $2 ($1.65) less than most Canadian-brewed beers. Those 
include U.S. brand-name beers made in Canada under contract. Molson makes 
Coors, Labatt manufactures Budweiser and Carling produces Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian brewers say they cannot produce beer as cheaply because they are not 
as large as the U.S. companies, who have greater economies of scale. Canadian 
provincial laws require production of beer in the province where it is sold. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this, the politically powerful Canadian brewers were able to lobby 
successfully to have beer exempted from the free trade agreement between Canada 
and the United States, which took effect Jan. 1.

Delaney's Restaurants said Tuesday that it has agreed to be bought by an 
undisclosed corporation. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of Anaheim-based Delaney's, a seafood dinner-house chain, should be 
completed within 60 days, said Mike Reagan, an accountant who represents the 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney's now operates nine restaurants, eight of them in Orange County and one 
in Riverside County. Reagan said the buyer intends to expand the chain "at 
least initially" in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan declined to identify the buyer and said a price has not yet been 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
Francis M. Delaney, the chain's owner, said in a written statement that the 
acquiring company now operates more than 150 restaurants and hotels. "It has 
substantial financial strength and has indicated an interest in expanding the 
Delaney chain far beyond its current operations," Delaney said. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney added that both buyer and seller are moving "to complete those steps 
necessary to close the acquisition. . . . There are many things to be done 
before the acquisition can be completed. But I am optimistic that . . . we will 
have an early closing." 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, there are two Delaney's restaurants in both Anaheim and the 
John Wayne Airport area, and one location each in Newport Beach, Dana Point, 
Laguna Hills and Garden Grove.

NOVA SCOTIA COMPANY NAMED AS POTENTIAL BUYER OF LINCOLN

<TEXT>
<P>
Central Guaranty Trust Co. in Nova Scotia was identified Tuesday as the 
Canadian company that has expressed an interest in buying Irvine-based Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
The Halifax firm, the sixth largest trust company in Canada, was named during a 
U.S. Bankruptcy Court hearing Tuesday as a company that wants to buy Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators seized Lincoln on April 14, a day after its parent company, 
American Continental Corp., filed for bankruptcy protection while it 
reorganized its debts. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board revealed that a Canadian firm 
had offered to buy Lincoln. The bank board would not name the firm, however. 
</P>
<P>
Central Guaranty's chairman, Struan Robertson, declined to comment on the 
proposal. JAMES GRANELLI

Fluorocarbon Co. posted a 16% decline in earnings for the quarter ended April 
30, to $2.6 million from $3.1 million for the comparable period last year. The 
year-ago net income included a gain of $1 million from the sale of assets. 
Sales for the first fiscal quarter rose 58%, to $95.7 million from $60.5 
million. Results for the first quarter included three companies that were 
acquired in February, 1989. Fluorocarbon manufactures polymer components for 
industrial markets.

MUSIC AND DANCE / CHRIS PASLES: FEW IN 'BILLY THE KID' AUDIENCE KNEW OF 
DANCER'S PAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Pasles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few in the audience who saw Alexander Kolpin dance the title role of Eugene 
Loring's "Billy the Kid" for the first time last week at UC Irvine knew the 
physical pain he was in. 
</P>
<P>
A muscle tear and stress fracture in the shin that he endured for almost a year 
and a half finally sent the principal dancer and rising star with the Royal 
Danish Ballet to the operating room in May. 
</P>
<P>
It also knocked him out of a tour with some of his Danish colleagues who will 
appear Sunday at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Kolpin's doctor had allowed him to dance Billy because the role does not 
require the airy jumps and intricate foot-beats characteristic of the Danes' 
Bournonville style. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been quite painful and still is and it swells a lot," Kolpin said in a 
recent interview. He said he was "on a lot of (pain) pills" while dancing at 
UCI, but otherwise was all right. 
</P>
<P>
He said he needed to dance to find out if the corrective surgery would "hold or 
not hold." 
</P>
<P>
"Also, it's very mental. You get scared, so you block. What happens after 
having an injury for so many months, you just start living with the pain and 
the fear. So you really cannot judge when it hurts and when it's sore. It's 
really scary. 
</P>
<P>
"At some point, you have to get beyond being frightened of doing anything. 
Yeah, I'm frightened. Whenever I feel just a little thing, (I think), OK, now 
the whole thing is going to break again." 
</P>
<P>
Although the surgery is now behind him, Kolpin anticipates "a lot of pain for 
the next year and swelling of the bone and all that." 
</P>
<P>
Kolpin, who turned 24 on Thursday, paused long and thoughtfully before 
answering what it was like to work with the UCI students. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult," he said. "They have been so nice, really very, very nice. 
It's always hard, because you see, if I go and dance with the Boston Ballet, a 
professional company, you pull each other up. But for me, I don't really have 
so much support in the other dancers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not talking about (their) not being engaged in it. But they're not at a 
very high technical level." 
</P>
<P>
Kolpin, however, thought it was his duty to interact strongly with them. 
</P>
<P>
"If you come and do a pas de deux, it's no problem," he said. "But if you come 
and do a ballet like this, you have to relate to the persons who are there on 
stage or else it's not going to work. I'm just going to seem out of place. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the most important thing -- to relate to the people that you dance with 
on stage. . . . Art is not personal exposure and showoff of yourself." 
</P>
<P>
That was a lesson he tried to convey to the students who danced the pas de deux 
from Bournonville's "Flower Festival in Genzano" on the program. 
</P>
<P>
"Those dancers very much danced to the audience, and I said, forget that. This 
is not a Russian pas de deux, (in which) one comes in and dances and runs out. 
. . . This is a pas de deux, which means step for two. So you're dancing for 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
"You're just lovers taking a walk in the woods. You dance for your lover. . . . 
'Oh, you look so gorgeous, now I want to dance for you. You look beautiful. We 
cannot stop it.' That's what I tried to get the idea for them. . . . The 
audience just happens to be there that night." 
</P>
<P>
Such an attitude does not rule out the unexpected, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it's very exciting when you go on stage and unpredictable things 
happen," he said. "I really get excited by chance." 
</P>
<P>
Several such "chances" happened on opening night. 
</P>
<P>
A left-hander, he made the mistake of stealing the jailer's gun with his right 
hand, then shooting him with his left. So he had to improvise a quick change to 
account for the difference. Few people noticed. 
</P>
<P>
He also got ahead of the music in his first solo, he said, and simply doubled 
Billy's quick back-and-forth paranoid turns. 
</P>
<P>
When one of the other characters couldn't make his entrance on time because he 
was still adjusting his costume, Kolpin had to improvise by riding around the 
stage a few extra times, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another improvisation included kissing one of the Mexican Girls after they 
shielded him from a posse. 
</P>
<P>
"All that (improvisatory) stuff -- that makes the ballet move, that makes it 
live, that makes it exciting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kolpin was 11 when he decided to follow his sister to a dance class. "I just 
went to watch one day, and I thought it was strange there were no boys," he 
said. "So I said to my mother that I wanted to attend the classes." 
</P>
<P>
A year later, his teacher recommended that he audition for the Royal Danish 
Ballet. But his parents weren't sure that he was serious enough and recommended 
another year of study. By then, although he had passed the company's age limit 
of 11 for its school, his teacher, once a principal with the Danes, worked out 
an arrangement, and after a while he was accepted into the school. 
</P>
<P>
"What was so nice for me was I had no ambitions when I started," Kolpin said. 
"I just thought it was nice to move. I was crazy about moving and using my 
body, whatever it was -- soccer, running. I've always been very energetic. And 
very hyper. I am very hyper." 
</P>
<P>
He became a principal dancer 18 months ago and was injured shortly afterward. 
Being a member of the Danish Ballet gives him job security, however. 
</P>
<P>
"In New York, if somebody gets an injury, well, you're just history, you're 
out," he said. But his status with the Danes would allow him a retirement 
pension if his injury would sideline him permanently, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, that does not appear to be the case, and he has begun discussing a 
possible return to UCI next summer to stage and dance in the third act of 
Bournonville's "Napoli," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Kolpin said he does not eat, sleep and breathe ballet. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm not at the company, I do so many other things. I read and I surf and 
I like to listen to music. And I like to build things. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important when you're a dancer, you shouldn't go home and sit and 
read your Dance Magazine and do your slippers and talk with your ballet friends 
and watch the ballet video because you're just going to die. Your art is going 
to dry up very slowly."

A Panorama City man was arrested this morning in the shooting death of a 
transient during a dispute over a woman at Hansen Dam Park in Pacoima, Los 
Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Scott Cowen, 35, was shot in the chest at 10:30 p.m. Tuesday night 
during the argument in a parking area at the park in the northeast San Fernando 
Valley. Cowen was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, where he 
died three hours later. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses provided police with a description of the gunman's car. Police 
arrested Jimmie Stephens, 36, after the car was seen parked at a Sun Valley 
motel early this morning. Stephens was being held without bail on suspicion of 
murder at the Foothill station jail. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Al Ferrand said it is believed that Cowen, who apparently slept at 
the park, and Stephens had argued over a "mutual girlfriend" before the 
shooting.

Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan said today that her country does not 
have nuclear weapons, will not build them and will not "provoke a nuclear arms 
race" on the subcontinent it shares with rival India. 
</P>
<P>
In an address to Congress, Bhutto also urged the United States to continue 
military and economic aid to Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
Applause repeatedly punctuated her speech and it was loudest and most prolonged 
when she said her nation does not intend to become a nuclear-weapons power and 
will work with the United States to "prevent the catastrophe of a nuclear arms 
race in south Asia."

GOP AIDE QUITS OVER FOLEY MEMO; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH 'DISGUSTED,' ATWATER APOLOGIZES AND AUTHOR RESIGNS

<TEXT>
<P>
A Republican national party official resigned today under fire, which included 
a condemnation from a "disgusted" President Bush, for writing a biting memo 
comparing new House Speaker Thomas F. Foley's "closet liberal" record with that 
of a homosexual congressman. 
</P>
<P>
Bush called Lee Atwater, chairman of the Republican National Committee, to 
complain about the incident and Atwater apologized to Foley, said White House 
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider the matter closed," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Within an hour of Atwater's apology, Mark Goodin, the author of the memo that 
equated Foley's voting record with that of Rep. Barney Frank, an acknowledged 
homosexual, resigned as RNC communications director. 
</P>
<P>
Goodin was a press assistant in Bush's 1988 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said Bush, who had a 90-minute lunch today with Foley and House 
Republican leader Robert H. Michel, had no advance knowledge of the Goodin 
memo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Mistake Obviously' 
</P>
<P>
"He was disgusted by this entire incident," the spokesman said. He said the 
memo seeking to discredit Foley (D-Wash.) violated the spirit of bipartisan 
cooperation that Bush has advocated since taking office. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is closed," Foley said outside the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Michel (R-Ill.) told reporters: "There wasn't all the kind of oversight there 
probably should have been" at the RNC. "It was a mistake obviously from the 
national committee's point of view." 
</P>
<P>
Michel said he did not know if Goodin had been asked to resign. Asked what 
advice he gave Atwater, he said: "I just said, 'There's got to be some remedy 
for what took place, and Lee, it's your shot. Do whatever you think is 
appropriate."' 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the circulation of the GOP memo on Foley was "to be deplored." 
However, he said the President retains confidence in Atwater, his former 
campaign chairman whom he handpicked for the party post. Atwater oversaw a 1988 
presidential campaign against Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis that was 
criticized for its negative tone. 
</P>
<P>
"I deeply regret my decision on the Foley memorandum," Goodin said in a 
resignation letter to Atwater. But he added: "At no time did I ever intend to 
damage anyone's reputation. . . . The purpose of the memorandum has been 
misconstrued. And in that regard, I have no one to blame but myself." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Good Cop, Bad Cop' 
</P>
<P>
Michel, who had expressed dismay over the attack Tuesday, called Bush today to 
voice concern and the President was angry about the document, a Michel aide 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One Democratic leader, Rep. Tony Coelho of California, said Bush should get 
involved and see that those responsible for the document are fired if 
Republicans want to persuade Democrats of their sincerity. 
</P>
<P>
"They're playing good cop, bad cop," Coelho said before the resignation was 
announced. "Here's a guy sent in by Bush to do the dirty deeds and he calls and 
apologizes after the fact. If they're really upset about these tactics, all 
they have to do is fire somebody." 
</P>
<P>
In the statement circulated Monday, the committee said Foley is anything but 
the political moderate some have portrayed him as being. The document was 
headlined "Tom Foley. Out of the Liberal Closet" and said Foley's voting record 
was as liberal as that of Frank (D-Mass.). 
</P>
<P>
Frank accused the GOP of spreading "extraordinarily scurrilous" rumors about 
Foley. He said Tuesday that the Republicans had smeared the Speaker with "a 
sleazy headline." 
</P>
<P>
Frank implied to reporters that he thought the RNC's decision to focus on him 
was a not-so-subtle effort to portray Foley as gay. 
</P>
<P>
"They put my name on it," Frank said. "It was despicable. They could have 
picked other liberals and put someone else in the headline." Frank said he

Theodore E. Sparling, 30, of Newport Beach was shot in the head twice after an 
argument with his girlfriend's husband, police said. Sparling and William 
Carson Evans, 30, of La Mirada were involved in a heated argument in an alley

Long-distance telephone service to and from the San Fernando Valley and 
surrounding areas was disrupted for several hours today when a switch failed at 
a phone center in Sherman Oaks, officials of AT&amp;T said. 
</P>
<P>
The 8:30 a.m. equipment failure cut service to AT&amp;T long-distance customers 
in the 818, 805 and portions of the 213 area codes, said Kelly Williams, a 
spokeswoman for the company. She said the affected areas apparently included 
the San Gabriel Valley, West Los Angeles, the Santa Clarita Valley and Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Williams declined to reveal the number of customers affected "for proprietary 
reasons." She said service was restored when computerized equipment rerouted 
calls to other circuits. By noon, fewer than 10% of long-distance calls from 
those areas were not going through the first time, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some business customers reported they were completely without service for more 
than two hours during what is normally the busiest part of their day. "It's 
caused a hell of a problem because we do everything by phone," said Wade 
Ambrose, a broker with Jones and Associates in Westlake Village. "We were out 
of business. Our customers couldn't reach us and we couldn't reach them. This 
has cost us multiples of thousands of dollars."

The California Lottery lost a court bid today to overturn a $3.4-million 
judgment awarded to a Los Angeles woman who was denied a $3-million lottery 
prize when her ball bounced out of its slot in a Big Spin game. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Robert Lopez refused to grant a new trial in the case 
after hearing arguments by lawyers for Doris Barnett and the state lottery. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett, 54, was elated Dec. 30, 1985, when she watched her ball land in the 
$3-million slot. Geoff Edwards, the master of ceremonies, declared Barnett a 
$3-million winner, but seconds later, the ball bounced out and came to rest in 
a $10,000 slot. Barnett sued and a jury decided she should get $3 million and 
$400,000 for emotional trauma.

169 KILLED WHEN DC-8 CRASHES IN SURINAME

<TEXT>
<P>
A Suriname Airways jetliner flown by Americans and carrying 183 people crashed 
in thick fog today on its third attempt to land at Suriname's Zanderij Airport, 
and airline officials said 169 aboard were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Robbe Lachmising, an airline spokesman in Amsterdam, said there were 14 
survivors among the 174 passengers and nine crew members on the DC-8 that 
crashed in the former Dutch colony in South America. He said the survivors were 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Dutch state radio, quoting Suriname's national news agency, said those on board 
included Suriname's army chief of staff, Gen. Lew Yen Tai; several other 
high-ranking officers, and a 14-member Dutch professional soccer team made up 
of ethnic Surinamese. 
</P>
<P>
A Suriname Radio report monitored in Brazil, Suriname's neighbor to the south, 
said the chief of staff was killed. 
</P>
<P>
The dead apparently included two American crew members, pilot Will Rogers and 
co-pilot Warren Rose, whose names were not on an airline list of survivors. 
Their hometowns were not available. 
</P>
<P>
Lachmising said the DC-8 crashed at 4:15 a.m. about a mile from the runway in 
an area known as Cola Creek, at the end of a flight from Amsterdam's Schipol 
Airport to the airport outside Suriname's capital of Paramaribo. 
</P>
<P>
"The cause of the crash is not immediately apparent," Lachmising said. He said 
most of those aboard were Dutch and Surinamese nationals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Total Panic' at Hospitals 
</P>
<P>
A Dutch Radio correspondent, Lucien de Freitas, said that all available medical 
personnel and ambulances in the city were rushed to the scene and that there 
was "total panic" at Paramaribo hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Mike Benson said 
an investigative team was dispatched to assist local investigators, as is the 
case with most crashes involving American-made aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old plane, which was registered in the United States, broke into 
four pieces but did not explode, and no fire broke out, Lachmising said. 
</P>
<P>
But Suriname radio reports quoted nearby residents as saying they heard an 
explosion shortly before the plane hit the ground. A U.S. pilot in another 
airplane, who was not identified, was quoted as saying he saw a ball of fire.

The Hong Kong government threatened today to suspend asylum for Vietnamese boat 
people unless other countries help end an overwhelming flood of refugee 
arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Security Geoffrey Barnes said he hopes that an international 
conference on refugees meeting in Geneva next week will help resolve the 
problem. If not, he said, the government will consider more "radical 
alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
Barnes said the exodus from Vietnam, which Monday alone brought an 
unprecedented 1,194 boat people to the British colony's shores, has swollen 
refugee camps to the bursting point. There are a total of 41,958 Vietnamese in 
11 refugee camps and detention centers. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure on Hong Kong has got to be removed and removed quickly," he said.

Two Cuban-born Republicans today entered the race for the congressional seat 
left vacant by the death of Claude Pepper, the liberal Democrat whose district 
came to be dominated by conservative Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and conservative businessman Carlos Perez 
announced bids to become the first Cuban-American in Congress. The Miami Herald 
reported today that Democratic state Sen. Jack Gordon will also run in the 
special election Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing her candidacy, Ros-Lehtinen pledged to carry on Pepper's "caring 
conscience and conservative convictions." Pepper was a lifelong liberal who had 
been vilified by Republicans in the '50s as "Red Pepper." 
</P>
<P>
Republicans this year are hoping to win control of the district, whose 
registration is 54% Democrat, down from 72% a decade ago. Latinos, including 1 
million Cuban emigres, are estimated to make up nearly half the district.

The government said today it would sell Short Brothers Ltd., the ailing Belfast 
aircraft and missile maker, to the Canadian aerospace company Bombardier Inc. 
for 30 million pounds, about $47 million. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement ended months of speculation over who would buy the state-owned 
company, which is Northern Ireland's largest employer, after the government 
said it planned to privatize it. 
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland Office said the government will inject 372 million pounds 
($584 million) into Short Brothers and write off a 390 million-pound ($612 
million) loan it made to Short earlier this year to help the company pay its 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
"Bombardier recognizes the important position occupied by Shorts in the 
Northern Ireland economy and intends to acquire the company as a long-term 
investment and to maintain it as a complete entity," Northern Ireland Secretary 
Tom King told the House of Commons. But he added that he could not guarantee 
that all workers would keep their jobs.

<P>
Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., one of the largest U.S. companies in South 
Africa, today announced that it is pulling out of the country after 42 years 
and selling its assets to a South African company. 
</P>
<P>
A combination of economic and political factors was responsible for Goodyear's 
decision to divest itself of its Uitenhage, South Africa, tire and general 
products manufacturing operation. 
</P>
<P>
The business will be sold to Consol Ltd., an industrial subsidiary of Anglovaal 
Ltd., a South African financial, industrial and mining group. 
</P>
<P>
Tom H. Barrett, Goodyear's chairman, president and chief executive officer, 
said the company regrets leaving South Africa after providing jobs there for 
more than four decades. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said in an announcement of the sale, "it is becoming increasingly 
difficult for American companies to obtain adequate returns on investments 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Barrett said the reasons for Goodyear's disinvestment included U.S. sanctions 
against South Africa, double U.S. taxation of South African earnings and the 
likelihood of a continuing decline in the value of the South African rand 
against major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax Credit Eliminated 
</P>
<P>
Congress in late 1987 enacted legislation that eliminates a tax credit for U.S. 
companies that allowed them to deduct taxes paid to South Africa against taxes 
owed to the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
The former Reagan Administration opposed the amendment and considered fighting 
to have it repealed, but it remains the law. 
</P>
<P>
Former State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said at the time the bill 
was passed that "the most likely effect will be to accelerate the takeover of 
U.S. assets by South African firms at bargain prices." 
</P>
<P>
Barrett said Anglovaal Ltd. is a responsible group that has demonstrated 
concern for human rights in the workplace and has expressed intentions to 
retain the current work force of 2,400 people, the majority of whom are black 
and colored. 
</P>
<P>
Mike McNamara, chairman and managing director of Goodyear's South African 
business, said the company will continue to operate under the same management. 
</P>
<P>
"We have always taken great pride in our people, and our management team and 
employees have vast knowledge of the local tire and rubber industry," McNamara 
said. "For them, we will continue to operate under present employment policies, 
practices and benefits, and all existing agreements and arrangements with our 
two trade unions remain unaltered."

Goodyear began manufacturing tires in South Africa in 1947, the year before the 
South African government adopted the apartheid policy of racial separation. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Goodyear took the position that it could contribute to social 
progress in South Africa by maintaining its operations in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The company says it has spent more than $10 million in education and training 
of blacks, housing and social programs in South Africa. Goodyear has adhered to 
the Sullivan Principles, a set of guidelines for companies operating in South 
Africa that address employment and other practices.

The world track and field body said today it will start worldwide random 
out-of-competition testing for steroids and their masking agents this winter. 
</P>
<P>
With the testing "no single athlete is sacrosanct," said Primo Nebiolo, 
president of the International Athletic Foundation at the end of its three-day 
symposium on drugs in track and field. "All must apply to the same principle." 
</P>
<P>
An official of the U.S. Track Federation said such testing of American athletes 
will begin even sooner, with random tests set to begin July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon Brown of the U.S. Track Federation said the federation plans an 
out-of-competition program to test the top 15 athletes in each event. He hoped 
three-fourths of that pool of athletes will face checks in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Arne Ljungqvist, international track's top medical officer, said the 
International Amateur Athletic Federation's annual congress in September was 
certain to approve the principle of the plan after the Ben Johnson scandal 
proved to the world that testing during competitions only is woefully 
inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no risk it will not be accepted, and we will do spot-checks all 
over," starting with the winter season, Ljungqvist said. The concept is raising 
hopes that it will drastically reduce doping. 
</P>
<P>
Drug experts and track officials ended a three-day symposium today, rallying 
behind the idea of the testing for the most common drugs used outside 
competitions after many scientific reports illustrated the destructive physical 
and mental side effects of doping in sports. 
</P>
<P>
Up to now, athletes have been able to follow doping programs that cleared the 
drugs from their system by the time competitions started. 
</P>
<P>
The IAAF plans to check the drugs most commonly used in training, centering on 
anabolic steroids and their masking agents, officials said here. 
</P>
<P>
"It will only confuse the situation if we start with all other drugs at the 
same time," said Greek Prof. John Kiburis.

ZOLA BUDD DECIDES NOT TO RETURN TO U.K. TO SEEK INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION

Zola Budd, whose career as a world-class distance runner has been dogged by 
political controversy, said today she will not return to Britain to seek 
further international competition. 
</P>
<P>
Budd, 23, told a news conference that she planned to remain in South Africa, 
where she was born, and gradually return to domestic competition after 
completing computer programming studies at a technical school. 
</P>
<P>
Budd moved to Britain in 1984 and was issued a British passport that enabled 
her to compete in the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. South Africa is barred 
from international track and field competition because of its racial 
segregation policies. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-apartheid groups pursued Budd relentlessly over the next four years, 
saying she should not be allowed to compete internationally because she 
maintained ties with South Africa and returned frequently to visit friends and 
family. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1988, she left Britain and returned to South Africa, and last April she 
married a liquor store owner in her hometown of Bloemfontein. She had expressed 
interest in returning to Britain to resume international competition.
