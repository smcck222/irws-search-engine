AL MARTINEZ: A HAPPY LITTLE BLIGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When I first meet Gerry Robinson he is carrying a guitar. Even before we can 
shake hands, he strikes a note, flashes a blinding smile and sings, "Al 
Martinez is a very good wri-ter and no doubt a happy little bligh-ter." Then he 
says, still smiling, "What is it you write?" 
</P>
<P>
We are in the middle of a busy television studio and I am not expecting anyone 
to suddenly jump in my face and start singing. I feel as if a fly has just 
landed on my nose. 
</P>
<P>
Also, how can the guy say I'm a very good writer when he doesn't know what I 
write? And even if I am a pretty good writer, I am sure as hell no happy little 
blighter. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, I am intrigued enough by Robinson to ask, with some hesitation, 
what it is he does. I asked that of a murder suspect once and he replied, "I 
kill people." Actually, he was a plumber, but he killed people on the side. A 
plumber-killer. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson says: "You could say Gerry is the fastest song-writer in the world. 
You could say Gerry makes people feel good." 
</P>
<P>
I haven't quite caught his first name and think he is talking about someone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
"No," I say, "what do you do?" 
</P>
<P>
This perplexes him, and the megawatt smile dims slightly. 
</P>
<P>
"That's it," he says. "Gerry writes songs. He's an instant song-maker." 
</P>
<P>
I suddenly realize, My God, he is talking about himself in the third person! 
Does Martinez have a column here or what? 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, as it turns out, not only writes instant personalized songs about 
anyone who happens to be around, but also composes motivational music for 
businesses like the May Co. 
</P>
<P>
They are happy, bouncy little tunes often piped through the store before it 
opens. Their lyrics admonish the company's employees to be proud, friendly and 
. . . well . . . perky. 
</P>
<P>
"It pumps 'em up," Robinson says eagerly. "It gives 'em spirit." 
</P>
<P>
As an instant song-maker, he performs at conventions and celebrity parties. A 
promotional brochure includes photographs of him with people like Bob Hope and 
Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are just some of the celebrities Gerry has strolled for," he says. He 
sees himself as a strolling troubadour. "Don Rickles is another. You can say 
Gerry has roasted a roaster." 
</P>
<P>
The brochure says, "Call me, I'll make up a song for you right on the phone!" 
It lists testimonials from those who have hired him, including this modest 
tribute from State Farm's Dal Eisenbraun: "No end of fun." 
</P>
<P>
"That's pretty good," I say, studying the brochure. 
</P>
<P>
Quick as a striking cobra, Robinson sings, "Martinez says it's pretty good and 
he ain't playin' Hol-ly-wood." 
</P>
<P>
"Gerry doesn't talk," he says cheerfully. "Gerry sings." 
</P>
<P>
We are in his Marina del Rey apartment a few days after our initial meeting. 
Robinson is a small, compact man of 38 who combines the ebullience of a 
chipmunk with the smile of a game show host. 
</P>
<P>
He began making up songs on the toilet at about age 12, he says, while his 
mother shouted "What's going on in there?" from another room. 
</P>
<P>
It was a long trip from the toilet to the spotlight, but Robinson made it. Now 
his favorite place to make up songs is in bed. A bachelor, he occasionally 
hosts overnight guests of the opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes after making love," he says, "Gerry feels so good he sings!" 
</P>
<P>
But, hey, wait. It isn't just singing sex Robinson wants to be famous for. 
Think of him as a Master of Motivational Music. 
</P>
<P>
"Made-up songs are gone in two minutes," he says, speaking through his smile. 
The man is all teeth. "But motivational music is forever." 
</P>
<P>
He plays a tape of the tune he and colleague Steve Duboff wrote for First 
Federal Savings &amp; Loan. You could polka to it. "At First Fed-er-al we're 
proud to say the best is yet to come, yes, the best is yet to come . . ." 
</P>
<P>
As the music plays, Robinson lifts a finger to indicate a No. 1 standing and 
pumps it up and down to the beat. 
</P>
<P>
He is wearing an electric blue polo shirt, blue jeans and shiny black jodhpur 
boots. There is something about him that reminds me of a manager I had when I 
sold men's clothes for J.C. Penney. 
</P>
<P>
He would gather us together just before the store opened and do a retail 
version of Knute Rockne. Win this one for men's apparel. Afterward, we prayed. 
</P>
<P>
I ask Robinson to make up a song about the L.A. by God Times. He does, but 
can't think of anything that rhymes with Metro, which is the department I work 
for. 
</P>
<P>
It's just as well. We'd probably have to sing it every morning and Martinez 
can't take perky tunes in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
He's a fussy little blighter.

Just in case you don't recognize Dennis Woodruff when he drives down the 
street, he has thoughtfully covered his car with dozens of publicity stills of 
himself, as well as his phone number and agent's name. 
</P>
<P>
Woodruff, 29, is an aspiring actor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to create an aura, like James Dean," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
Most mornings, he and his aura drive from his apartment into Hollywood, where 
he leaves his car in a lot next to Mann's Chinese Theater. Then he takes a bus 
home and sits by the phone, waiting for his big break. At day's end, his 
girlfriend takes him back to Hollywood, where he picks up his car (after paying 
$4) and drives it home. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the public to know me -- that's the essence of entertainment," he 
points out. 
</P>
<P>
He admits that his car hasn't brought him any casting calls, but says he's 
surviving by finding occasional bit roles ("Robo Cop 2" and TV's "Quantum 
Leap"). 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, camera-toting tourists snap away in the parking lot next to 
Mann's all day. 
</P>
<P>
Woodruff's car, at least, has become a star. 
</P>
<P>
In L.A., you never know who's going to make it into show biz. For instance, El 
Teatro de la Realidad (Theatre of Reality), will offer free performances June 
29-30 of "Where the Gods Walk," a play about the street vendors who live and 
work in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Not only will some vendors perform in the showings at the L.A. Photography 
Center and Barnsdall Park's Gallery Theater, but they will also sell their ice 
creams and hot dogs to spectators. 
</P>
<P>
Election analysts who broke the results down by issue and voter category may 
have neglected one angle in the state attorney general's race. 
</P>
<P>
During the primary campaign, a spokesman for Democratic hopeful Ira Reiner 
scornfully referred to rival Arlo Smith, who sports about as much hair as your 
Only in L.A. correspondent, as "Potato Head." 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, the silver-thatched L.A. County district attorney, was then upset by 
Smith, his San Francisco counterpart. And now Reiner, no doubt, is haunted by 
the possibility that he lost as the result of the baldy backlash. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of vicious stereotypes, the L.A. Downtown News was criticized this 
week by a letter writer who was upset because the newspaper reported that one 
local activist "looks like a librarian . . . a bit rumpled, a bit aloof." 
</P>
<P>
The writer wrote: "Remember what happened to Andy Rooney? Librarians don't have 
'a look,' and they take special pains not to be 'rumpled' or 'aloof.' " 
</P>
<P>
No Rooney-type suspension seems forthcoming. The News said, "We did not receive 
any other letters complaining about our abuse of librarians." 
</P>
<P>
But back to Potato Head: 
</P>
<P>
A KFWB news announcer reported that Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne 
Feinstein will be running "against Pete Smith." That's news to Arlo Wilson. 
</P>

PERSPECTIVE ON SOVIET-AMERICAN RELATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH HAD STRENGTH NOT TO USE TRUMPS; 
</P>
<P>
THE SOVIETS ARE PLAYING FOR TIME. TO THEIR RELIEF, THE PRESIDENT RESISTED 
RIGHT-WING PRESSURES TO APPLY THE HEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARSHALL D. SHULMAN, Marshall D. Shulman is Adlai E. Stevenson Professor 
Emeritus of International Relations at the Harriman Institute of Advanced Study 
of the Soviet Union, Columbia University.

<TEXT>
<P>
It will be awhile before a definitive assessment of the latest Soviet-American 
summit is possible, when more becomes known about matters discussed but not yet 
revealed and when it becomes clearer how far words will be translated into 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
But with the perspective of almost a week's reflection, and leaving aside the 
pageantry and the popular excitement, there are some aspects of the summit 
whose significance deserves a bit more emphasis than they have received. 
</P>
<P>
From the Soviet point of view, the most important result was that the Soviet 
leadership came away reassured that the Bush Administration could be counted 
upon not to exploit Soviet weaknesses and troubles -- a matter that the Soviets 
had approached with some uneasiness and a sense of vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
The most significant observation on this point was made by the 
independent-minded commentator for Izvestia, Alexander Bovin: "Bush has all the 
trumps but he didn't play them. Gorbachev played equal in an unequal position." 
The Soviets are, of course, aware of the residual right-wing pressures in this 
country to declare victory in the Cold War, and to pressure the Soviet Union 
not only for maximum concessions but also with the objective of hastening the 
collapse of the Soviet Union. They were relieved that President Bush resisted 
these pressures and declared U.S. interest in the continuation of the Soviet 
reform efforts. 
</P>
<P>
A related point is that this summit marked a considerable advance in the level 
of awareness each side brought to the internal politics within the other 
country. They met not simply as two entities but as leaders seeking to manage 
and to balance complex political forces at their backs. Each sought to take 
account of this additional level of negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the Soviets recognized that only a centrist and confident conservative 
Administration could have successfully weathered the containment of right-wing 
pressures in the United States. The attack from right-wing columnists and 
politicians has been swift in coming -- on Lithuania, trade, Jewish emigration 
and alleged "concessions" on arms control. While George Bush, buttressed by 
support from public opinion, could handle these attacks, a Democratic 
Administration would have felt politically vulnerable to these charges (as the 
cautious sentiment among Democrats on Capitol Hill demonstrates). 
</P>
<P>
Before the summit, the Soviets had been growing increasingly restive and 
resentful about the non-responsiveness of the United States on the two issues 
of major importance to them -- arms control and trade. They had staked a great 
deal on their concessions and overtures to the United States and had come to 
feel that this gamble had not paid off. In arms control, they felt that 
Washington was playing for unilateral advantages and was not politically 
prepared to engage in a major effort to limit the military competition. On 
trade, they saw the United States holding back, deterred by residual suspicions 
from engaging in more substantial trade relations pending a clarification of 
the outcome of the reforms in the Soviet Union. As a result, the Soviets have 
been increasingly seeking to cultivate economic relations with Western Europe, 
particularly with West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Now, although they feel that the direction of U.S. policy is more favorable, at 
least in tone, they are realistic enough to recognize that progress may be 
slow. But they face the future with somewhat greater patience and equanimity. 
</P>
<P>
Although, as has been widely noted, Mikhail Gorbachev's success at the summit 
may be of only marginal help to him in facing his domestic problems, about 
which he spoke with remarkablecandor and confidence during his visit, he is 
palpably restored and confident as he returns to what is likely to be a 
critical month ahead. All of his major issues -- the economy, Lithuania and 
ethnic violence, the polarization of politics and the future of the Communist 
Party -- are coming to a head in this period. Of critical importance will be 
the outcome of the remaining regional and local elections and the selection of 
delegates to the Communist Party Congress scheduled for July 2. These will 
determine whether he will have a working majority among the party apparatchiks, 
or whether he will be obliged to let the party decline into splits and 
desuetude while he shifts his power base to the office of the presidency in the 
state structure. 
</P>
<P>
The unresolved issue concerning the future relations between a reunited Germany 
and NATO -- which is a shorthand reference to the broader set of issues 
concerning the restructuring of the United States with Europe -- can best be 
understood as a dramatic illustration of the way Gorbachev's reforms have 
produced unintended and unforeseen consequences, abroad as well as at home. 
During the period, in 1988 and early 1989, when Gorbachev was urging the 
Communist Party leaders of Eastern Europe to make timely concessions to the 
pressures for reform -- in the belief that the process could be controlled and 
the parties could maintain traction during the period of change -- it gradually 
became clear that the resistance of the old party leaders and their failure to 
make timely responses would result in their total loss of power as popular 
pressures mounted and took to the streets. Particularly in East Germany, the 
unanticipated speed of this disintegration -- and the consequent acceleration 
of the movement toward German reunification -- would undermine the Soviet 
position in Central Europe. The belated recognition of this outcome was 
reflected in the Soviets' rear-guard efforts to salvage some remnants of their 
influence by some ill-defined formula for a European security system. 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma for the Soviet Union is that while it badly needs German economic 
support for Eastern Europe and for itself, Moscow now contemplates with fear 
the prospect of the emergence of Germany over the coming decade as the dominant 
power in Europe, which the weakened Soviet Union can see no way of 
counterbalancing. 
</P>
<P>
The only way out for the Soviets' is to play for time to seek interim measures 
for a transitional period while Germany becomes embraced in a strengthened 
European Community, NATO evolves into a political structure for U.S. 
participation in European developments and the pan-European institutions begin 
to take on vitality and substance.

TINY CRACK SHOWS UP IN VOTERS' MOOD; 
</P>
<P>
BUT THEY HAVE ENTRUSTED A MANDATE FOR NEW THINKING TO BULWARKS OF THE STATUS 
QUO, WHO HAVE A 'VISION DEFICIT.' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Beneath the inevitable pattern of win ners and losers on Election Day there was 
a changed voter mood that may shape the politics of the 1990s. The gender 
barrier finally was broken in gubernatorial politics, and the electorate proved 
increasingly liberal on social and economic issues, still distrustful of 
government but willing to selectively earmark its own taxes toward meeting the 
needs of the future. 
</P>
<P>
The public expects an activist, rather than caretaker, approach from the next 
Administration. But this was not a mandate for what the public perceives as 
permissive or big-spending liberalism. The Republican rhetoric on those issues 
still fits the public mood. 
</P>
<P>
But the voters did approve spending billions on transportation programs, school 
and university expansion, and new prison construction. They voted not only for 
long-term bonds, but also took a regressive gas tax upon themselves, the first 
such action since Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental issue crested to a new power in helping defeat the 
Republican-sponsored reapportionment initiatives, and in the passage of rail 
transit measures and protection of wilderness for mountain lions. The 
environment is sure to be the most powerful issue on the November ballot when 
voters will decide on "Big Green," the initiative designed to phase out 
dangerous toxics in the air, ocean and food supply. It will also be an asset to 
Dianne Feinstein, who has endorsed the measure, and a probable headache for 
Pete Wilson, who "supports its goals" but not its provisions. 
</P>
<P>
There is now a crack, if not a window, of opportunity to confront problems that 
are overwhelming the state. We have slipped from first to worst in the nation 
in major ways. We spend the least per capita on roads and have the most 
congested traffic. Only Waikiki has higher housing costs. We have the nation's 
most polluted air, overcrowded classrooms, prison inmates and the highest 
volume of cocaine traffic. The annual death rate from gang violence in Los 
Angeles now exceeds that of Beirut's civil war. The electorate is mostly white 
in a state that is mostly not. A few enjoy life in the fast lane while too many 
face dead-end futures. Even the middle class, for the first time, believes that 
the quality of life in California is declining. 
</P>
<P>
Big problems demand big solutions, even bigger than a gender change in the 
governor's office, and certainly bigger than passing bond measures to build 
more off-ramps, prison cells and classrooms to absorb the state's swelling 
population. The budget deficit does not compare to our vision deficit. We are 
building infrastructure without knowing where we are going. 
</P>
<P>
How do we make the transition to a multicultural California, with a 
better-educated public, a healthy environment and a competitive economy while 
growing faster than ever? There are no ready answers to a future without 
precedent. 
</P>
<P>
But we know that old answers will only keep us on the present treadmill. 
Raising taxes will never keep up with the spiraling costs of administrative 
bureaucracy. Cutting waste will never generate sufficient savings for new 
priorities. Unprecedented incentives for long-term solutions will have to be 
created in both the public and private sectors. A focus on social prevention -- 
of disease, of pollution, of illiteracy and drop-outs -- will be needed to 
control future costs. 
</P>
<P>
The paradox is that voters have entrusted a mandate for new thinking to 
politicians who tend to be profiles in caution and bulwarks of the status quo, 
who turn to commissions and polls for solutions. Both gubernatorial candidates 
tend to be most comfortable as mediators in the middle of the spectrum. All the 
incentives in politics are toward avoiding the bare truth where it is 
complicated or controversial. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge in the campaign and beyond will be whether new thinking can break 
through cobwebbed categories, whether a California perestroika, if you will, 
can take place in the traditional political order. Or are we already controlled 
by the political Muzak of sound bites? If so, California will drift into its 
future, increasingly ungovernable.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
SHOWING THAT INDEPENDENT STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a low turnout, voters in Orange County displayed a fascinating mix of 
sentiment on Tuesday. They recognized a shoddy argument, and they seemed more 
willing than before to tax themselves for the common good, even as they 
retained a fierce tradition of anti-tax feeling. Voters wisely and 
overwhelmingly rejected Measure A, which would have required a new county jail 
to be built in Santa Ana. It was a thinly veiled attempt to foist the 
countywide jail crisis on one city, and voters had no problem seeing its 
unfairness. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 111, which will raise the gasoline tax by nine cents in the next 
five years, won statewide approval despite losing in Orange County by 52% to 
47%. But that was a small enough margin to at least raise hopes that county 
voters may be ready to approve a half-cent sales tax increase for urgently 
needed transportation and transit projects. Another optimistic note was sounded 
when voters approved Proposition 111's companion measure, 108, which will 
provide bonds for passenger-rail and clean-air projects. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, a county sales tax measure went down by 53% to 47% -- a narrower 
edge than ever before. If voters understand that local matches are required to 
qualify for many projects that could be funded by Proposition 111, they will at 
last follow in the footsteps of every other urban county in California in 
approving a sales tax for transportation. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, Orange County was true to its conservative image -- with a 
notable exception. It voted against every other bond measure -- 
homeless/housing, school facilities and earthquake rehabilitation (all were 
approved statewide). But it voted for prison construction bonds, proving once 
again it is tough on crime. Oddly, it joined voters statewide to defeat two 
measures backed by the GOP as a way to wrest power from Democrats when new 
district lines are redrawn in 1991. Local voters are at least showing 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
In local races, voters surprised three incumbents, who now face November 
runoffs, and Irvine Mayor Larry Agran was defeated by Councilwoman Sally Anne 
Sheridan. 
</P>
<P>
What lies ahead? In Irvine, big changes. At the county level, Supervisor 
Harriett M. Wieder and Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi deserve to retain their 
offices in November. But the strong showing of John F. Dean in the race for 
county schools superintendent showed that 24-year incumbent county Schools 
Supt. Robert D. Peterson is out of step with needs of schools today.

JACK SMITH: REMODELING: A CLEAN SWEEP . . . OF THE 'HARD' JUNK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After several false starts, we are finally going to build two bedrooms and a 
bath over our garage. I was against it from the start, but I have deferred to 
my wife's wishes, and I have promised not to complain if things go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Of course they will go wrong. It is axiomatic that remodeling takes twice as 
long and costs twice as much as one expects. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't think we would ever actually do it because there was one 
insurmountable obstacle. We would have to clean the garage out -- completely, 
to allow for foundation work. 
</P>
<P>
It was my opinion, and still is, that cleaning out the garage will be an 
impossible task. There is too much accumulation of junk. Too many years. We 
have cleaned it out at least twice before, but those times were superficial. We 
never really got down to the real hard junk. 
</P>
<P>
We have made a start. The difficulties are already apparent. What to give to 
the Goodwill, what to keep, and what to throw out. Our contractor has promised 
to set up a shed in our back yard for the stuff we want to keep, and also to 
hire a junk man to carry off the trash. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I are of two different minds. I want to throw everything out. 
Lighten ship. I see no reason for going into the future burdened by the 
impedimenta of the past. I try to set a good example. I remember the trauma, 
the last time, when I sent my Marine Corps tunic to the Goodwill. It didn't 
prompt any similar sacrifices by her. 
</P>
<P>
Already I have emptied my shelves and filled six cartons with books to give 
away. They include almost the complete Nero Wolf stories of Rex Stout. I've 
read them twice already. Also, I am giving away about 100 records, from Ella 
Fitzgerald singing Cole Porter to Mozart, Bach and Handel. In the house we have 
hundreds of records we never play. Our evenings are devoted almost entirely to 
sex and violence on television. 
</P>
<P>
Also, I am thinking of throwing out the scrap books in which, for 20 years, my 
wife faithfully pasted my columns. They have served their purpose. The past is 
past. It will hurt, and it will hurt her, but I must be ruthless. 
</P>
<P>
I am also going to throw out all the plaques I have won over the years for this 
imaginary achievement or that. I don't mean to disparage them, but I don't wish 
to display them, and what good are they in the dark of the garage? 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that my wife has no such steel. She can't bring herself to part 
with anything. She has at least 50 baskets. I have no idea how she collected 
them. I have no idea why she wants to keep them. They take up an enormous 
amount of space. She also has boxes full of cloth, which she expects to make 
into dresses some day. Meanwhile she buys everything she wants mail order and 
hasn't made a dress in years. 
</P>
<P>
I did score one triumph. She opened a trunk and found it full of her old hats. 
Once, trying to take control, I had driven that trunk to the dump and started 
to throw the hats away. I did throw one straw away. It sailed out into the dump 
like a UFO. I was stricken by remorse. After all, the hats belonged to her. I 
brought the trunk back and put it in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought you threw all these away," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"No," I said. "Just one." 
</P>
<P>
Now that she's found them, you think she's going to throw those hats away? No 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
"She opened a drawer and found a stack of my old notebooks. Years of them. Why 
had I ever saved them? They had already served their purpose. Now the notes 
were gibberish. I couldn't even remember what they related to. Here and there I 
found some banal platitude which I evidently thought was profound at the time: 
"Heaven may be paradise, but getting there is half the fun. . . . When you're 
young, goodby means only till tomorrow. . . . Man is a comic animal. . . . Time 
flied out. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Now, at last, it was all going into some landfill. At least my scrapbooks and 
notebooks are biodegradable. 
</P>
<P>
What I have to watch out for is that she doesn't try to save my books, records, 
scrapbooks, plaques and notebooks when my back is turned. I'm afraid they'll 
all turn up in that temporary shed, and find their way back into the garage. 
</P>
<P>
The price of a light ship is eternal vigilance. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of platitudes.

MAGAZINES: SMORGASBORD FOR UNCRITICAL CONSUMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you are what you eat, then it's no wonder so many city folks have identity 
crises. Most people don't have a clue how the food they eat is grown, where it 
comes from, what skills are involved in growing it or what chemicals it 
contains. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, most urbanites view themselves as food consumers, putting their trust 
in agribusiness, just as they put their trust in the company that made their CD 
players. The average "industrial eater," poet and essayist Wendell Berry says 
in the June California, is "necessarily passive and uncritical -- in short a 
victim." 
</P>
<P>
Berry's essay is just an appetizer in a full feast of articles on the subject 
of this state's "clean food revolution," with enough information to at least 
get eaters started as critical food consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"After more than 40 years of waging all-out chemical warfare on nature, using 
toxic chemicals to kill aphids, redden apples and destroy weeds, California 
farmers have finally decided that there has to be a better way," the magazine 
asserts. By the end of the decade, 10% of all California produce will be grown 
by farmers who have broken ranks with mainstream agribusiness, abandoning the 
so-called "cide sisters" (synthetic insecticides, herbicides and fungicides) in 
favor of more environmentally sound farming methods. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the information contained in these largely bite-sized articles has been 
served up by other publications. Some of it, such as journalist David 
Steinman's self-proclaimed low-toxin diet, needs much more scrutiny than the 
magazine offers. 
</P>
<P>
The most encouraging piece is called "Local Heroes," and tracks the stories of 
several successful organic farmers, including Paul Buxman, who abandoned 
chemicals altogether when his son developed leukemia (from pesticide 
contamination, his family believes). 
</P>
<P>
Much less encouraging is the information turned up by Steinman in a very brief 
article about the Food and Drug Administration's failure to test much of the 
produce that arrives in California from Mexico -- where pesticide regulations 
are less stringent. And any optimism the issue generates will be tempered by 
Leora Romney's insight into why biogeneticists who originally set out to 
produce pest-resistant plants have instead been persuaded to produce plants 
that can resist increasing doses of pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most telling aspect of the whole package, however, comes from an 
apparently inadvertent juxtaposition of images. One color shot features a 
beautiful California orange, perfect except for a tiny, harmless blemish. It 
was caused by an insect that citrus farmers battle each year with 410,000 
pounds of highly toxic chemicals. On the next page is a photograph of a proud 
farm worker and her young son, who was born without arms or legs -- the result 
of his mother's exposure to pesticides, she believes. 
</P>
<P>
The responsibility for the use of the "cide sisters," of course, comes full 
circle. Anyone who eats must understand, Berry writes, that "eating takes place 
inescapably in the world, that it is inescapably an agricultural act, and that 
how we eat determines, to a considerable extent, how the world is used." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
REQUIRED READING 
</P>
<P>
* The subtitle says it all: "Our Magnificent Obsession with All-Star Stiffs." 
The July Exposure package on "Dead Celebrities," does some fine pop analysis of 
our culture's growing fixation with show-biz types such as Elvis, Marilyn and 
James Dean -- while providing plenty of excellent photography and art. 
</P>
<P>
But in an age when celebs obsession often takes violent turns, the "Death as a 
Career Move" humor feature probably crosses the line of responsibility. Is the 
idea of Paula Abdul snapping her own neck "while tossing her head back during a 
photo opportunity" funny? Is it? The Spring issue of The Book-Los Angeles, that 
odd little paperback-sized quarterly, has arrived, well after Earth Day, with 
the words "Who Cares?" on the cover and one of the best environmental packages 
of the media blitz inside. The itty-bitty landscape photographs alone are 
almost worth the $5 cover price. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
* Questions arise about Field &amp; Stream, Salt Water Fisherman, Outdoor Life, 
Skiing, Yachting and other Times Mirror Co. publications (parent company of the 
Los Angeles Times), now that the Times Mirror Magazines Conservation Council 
has entered into a "partnership agreement" with four federal land and 
resource-management agencies. 
</P>
<P>
A Times Mirror press release says the pacts with the Bureau of Land Management, 
the Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Park Service and the Forest Service 
were forged "to solidify the mutual goals of Times Mirror Magazines and the 
federal agencies to inform the public about important land management issues, 
promote the wise use of natural resources, implement natural resource education 
programs and work together on partnership projects." 
</P>
<P>
Times Mirror's "leisure-oriented" magazines are hardly muckraking journals. But 
they may well be a major source of environmental information and ideology for 
their combined 33 million readers. Joining up with the agencies that manage -- 
sometimes controversially -- the resources they report on would seem 
problematic at best. 
</P>
<P>
Francis Pandolfi, president of Times Mirror Magazines, said the agreements 
offer the magazines a chance to support responsible conservation issues for 
reasons of altruism and good business. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a responsibility to see to it that resources are used wisely. 
If that happens, we're going to have a healthy business," Pandolfi said. 
</P>
<P>
The magazines will be in a good position to publicize basic philosophies shared 
with the agencies, such as a belief "in multiple-use approach to resource 
management that includes economic development, outdoor recreation, and 
preservation of protected species," Pandolfi said. But, he added, that does not 
mean they will agree with the agencies on specific policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
"The agreements do not constitute an endorsement on the part of either party. 
In my remarks (at a recent ceremony announcing the pacts), I specifically said 
there would be times when we would disagree. I said we'd have to be tolerant of 
each other during those times. . . . That's one way a solid partnership works." 
</P>
<P>
Pandolfi expects the pacts to provide editors and writers at the magazines with 
better access to the agencies, and he expects the magazines will be in a better 
position to express to the agencies their views on matters such as access to 
public lands. 
</P>
<P>
Which raises another question: Will competing publications have to enter into 
similar pacts to get equal access to government officials? 
</P>
<P>
"I would urge other magazines to do the same thing," said Pandolfi. "We're all 
out for the same goal, which is responsible management of resources." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEW ON NEWSSTANDS 
</P>
<P>
* Publishers' statements in new magazines are invariably pompous. Claude 
Attias' letter to readers in the premiere issue of 'Scape is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
This big, slick magazine for the Southern California and bicoastal elite 
arrives in our hands, we are told, "with the express intent of celebrating the 
achievements of the men and women who have shaped our lives, while embracing 
the themes that will dominate the next millennium." 
</P>
<P>
'Scape is beautiful. It is nicely designed and the writing is fine. The art, 
design, and architecture photography is particularly well done -- a spread on 
deconstructivist architecture, for instance, is stunning. And the pieces on 
Biosphere touch on themes that may very well dominate the next millennium. But 
has the guy who designed the intriguing restaurant Noa Noa really shaped our 
lives? Has Jeff Goldblum, who is also profiled? 
</P>
<P>
At its core, this is just another pretty, rich folks magazine. Its true heart 
seems to be the listings for $5 million, $6 million and $7 million homes, which 
the publisher naturally refers to as "a revolutionary business concept in the 
form of a midsection real estate catalogue."

ART BUCHWALD: A MAYOR NEEDS A CLEAR HEAD WHEN IT COMES TO DECISIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Marion Barry's defense lawyer's strategy is to convince a jury that the 
reason the mayor has been charged with possession of drugs and perjury is 
because of his race. This is not the case. Most people tend to get nervous when 
their mayor is tooting suspicious substances. 
</P>
<P>
The truth of the matter is that mayors have to make more split decisions than 
any other elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
They also need to make them with a clear head -- dope can slow you down. 
</P>
<P>
Come with me to a mayor's mansion in Gotham City, U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Dubarry is reading the morning newspaper with a straw. 
</P>
<P>
The phone rings and a voice says, "Mr. Mayor, we have a warehouse fire on 
Cunard and First. What do you want us to do?" 
</P>
<P>
"Dispatch 4,000 snow plows -- and if that doesn't work, use your backup garbage 
trucks." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have 4,000 snow plows, sir." 
</P>
<P>
"Then order them from The Sharper Image catalogue," Mayor Dubarry tells him and 
hangs up. He appears very restless and calls in his secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I have any grand jury hearings today? I feel like committing perjury." 
</P>
<P>
"No, sir. They're coming up next week." 
</P>
<P>
"That's a pity. Maybe I'll lie to the press." 
</P>
<P>
"You always feel better when you do, Mr. Mayor." 
</P>
<P>
The phone rings again. "Mr. Mayor, this is the chief of police. There's a 
madman on top of the library, and he's screaming that he won't come down until 
you pay for the last marijuana delivery he made to you in the Virgin Islands." 
</P>
<P>
"Shoot him." 
</P>
<P>
He hangs up and turns to his secretary, "Do you remember where I put the 
Percodan pills? 
</P>
<P>
"I better have a few while I design the plans for the new hospital." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Mayor, you know that Margaret Thatcher is coming this morning for a 
visit." 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder if she snorts?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think so. By the way, the State Department protocol people have 
requested that you do not giggle when you give her the key to the city." 
</P>
<P>
"They've got a nerve telling me what to do," the mayor says. "Do I tell 
Margaret Thatcher how to run the Eiffel Tower?" 
</P>
<P>
"Are you finished cooking with this white powder?" 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I'm finished. I can take it or leave it." 
</P>
<P>
"Then I'll put it away." 
</P>
<P>
"No, leave it." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Mayor, there is a subway derailment and all traffic in the city is 
stopped. The man responsible was on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
"How sad. Let's give him another chance." 
</P>
<P>
"Sir, do you think you should be sitting on the floor in the lotus position 
when Prime Minister Thatcher comes into the room?" 
</P>
<P>
"She rules India, she should be used to it."

INTO THE NIGHT: BIKERS ADD SPICE TO BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: The Harley, Leather &amp; Lace Affair at the Spice club Tuesday 
night in Hollywood. Chaired by Dan Haggerty ("Grizzly Adams") and Bill Reed, 
1,000 motorcycle riders were expected at this benefit for the World Children's 
Transplant Fund, the Spastic Children's Fund and A Head With Horses, a 
horseback-riding program for handicapped children. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: Traditional Spandex-and-leather club scene types, plus members 
of the Hells Angels, the Tribes and other assorted motorcycle clubs. By 
midnight, perhaps 100 motorcycles were parked outside. The lengthy list of 
promised celeb guests came close to batting a rare, absolute zero until Mickey 
Rourke arrived at 11 p.m. He left 20 minutes later looking angry. (There was 
also a large turnout of press, TV crews and paparazzi grumbling about the lack 
of star presence and ready to lynch the publicist.) 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: No buzz, plenty of roar as open-piped motorcycles came and went. "The 
American people love American iron," said Haggerty. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Code: Everybody had a black leather jacket. Optional equipment included 
Levi's with a heavy-duty padlock hanging from a belt loop, handkerchief 
headbands, scar tissue. The general idea was to look sinister but to have a 
heart of gold. 
</P>
<P>
Motorcycle Mode: The '50s retro look is big. Two-tone paint jobs on "Fat Bobs" 
(large gas tanks), whitewall tires partially covered by drooping fenders, more 
chrome than Zimbabwe produces in a year. 
</P>
<P>
Money Matters: Tickets were $20. There appeared to be a few hundred paying 
guests; no one ventured an estimate of the net receipts. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: Hors d'oeuvres passed on trays included smoked salmon mousse, cantaloupe 
wrapped in prosciutto and puffed pastry with shrimp curry. Pretty much what 
you'd expect at any Hells Angels picnic. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: "There are all kinds of people in the world, but no matter what 
concerns them, they care about kids," said LAPD Deputy Chief Mark Kroeker, 
founder of the World Children's Transplant Fund, which helps to pay for organ 
transplants performed in the United States for poor children from Third World 
countries.

MIXED REVIEWS FOR STANLEY CROUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What a refreshing experience to read the article on black essayist Stanley 
Crouch. Occasionally, the voice of sanity pops up like a cork out of "an abyss 
of intellectual and moral cowardice." 
</P>
<P>
How disappointing is the contemporary crop of black American leaders, who, as 
Crouch says, are "selfish opportunists, suffering from critical bankruptcy in 
the face of fashion and ideology." 
</P>
<P>
As a white retired school teacher, who devoted the main part of my career to 
teaching in a black ghetto, I yearn for intellectuals like Crouch to come forth 
and tell it like it is. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch describes the indoctrinations of Nation of Islam minister Louis 
Farrakhan as "consistently incoherent." Unfortunately, his duped followers do 
not appear to possess the rational capacity to see through him, and have made 
him a power figure that has discarded white support. Many agree that 
Farrakhan's anti-Semitic and separatist thinking helped to undermine the whole 
civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch characterizes the "rap group Public Enemy and those of their ilk who 
have engaged in the baiting of Jewish people, Afro-fascists." If only more 
black leaders could remind their people that the Jews were, and are, in the 
forefront of the black civil rights movement. What an insult and disappointment 
to those Jews whose blood has intermingled with theirs in the struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Let's hope that more black Americans will listen to Crouch's teachings and turn 
more to what America has to offer, and refute the haters, separatists and 
seekers of personal power at the expense of their people and the nation.

MIXED REVIEWS FOR STANLEY CROUCH

<TEXT>
<P>
Stanley Crouch's singular goal appears to be to perform some sort of a 
sadomasochistic ritual on the black race, in particular black literary figures 
("Crouch to the Contrary," May 21). 
</P>
<P>
Nothing is cheaper than an analysis of a problem with no problem- solving plan 
of action behind it. Crouch's observations have degenerated to so much 
gibberish, given the absence of any solutions. Rather than offering solutions, 
he is spewing a form of literary cancer exactly like the forms he attacks -- 
i.e., works emasculating the black male.

Dead Barred From Maryland: A concert pavilion in Columbia, Md., is the latest 
to ban concerts by the Grateful Dead because of its fans. The 14,000-seat 
Merriweather Post Pavilion granted a police request to end scheduling of 
concerts by the veteran rock 'n' roll band and the Jerry Garcia Band, headed by 
the Grateful Dead's lead guitarist, said Jean Parker, general manager of the 
14,000-seat amphitheater. Several other venues, including Stanford University 
and the University of California at Berkeley, had banned the group in April 
because of recurring drug-related arrests at concerts. GREG BRAXTON

Not banned -- A Thursday Morning Report item inaccurately reported that the 
Grateful Dead had been banned from Stanford University and the University of 
California at Berkeley. In fact, the band and officials at those institutions 
mutually agreed that the band's popularity was drawing larger crowds than could 
be accommodated by the colleges.

Sticker Situation: Louisiana could become the first state in the nation to make 
it illegal to sell "explicit" records without a warning label on them. A bill 
that would mandate the stickering of albums with explicit lyrics and prohibit 
the sale of such records to minors passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on 
Tuesday. The measure, which passed the Louisiana House of Representatives on 
May 14 , could be put to a floor vote in the Senate before the end of the week.

The bounty of Sonoma and the diversity of its products are limitless. We pride 
ourselves on being able to achieve the epitome of the art of living. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JOY STERLING, 
</P>
<P>
Iron Horse Vineyards 
</P>
<P>
A black stretch limo zooms past plush vineyards, then turns up a winding road 
toward a replica of a French chateau: Jordan Winery. The passengers are heading 
to dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Airport limousines carrying wine trade pilgrims -- wine buyers, distributors, 
visiting winemakers from around the world -- are commonplace in the Napa and 
Sonoma Valleys. So too, these days, is the growing number of winery chefs. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Bowman, Jordan's hospitality director and vineyard host, recalls that 
as recently as three years ago only six wineries had resident chefs. Today the 
number has probably tripled. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes business sense," says Bowman. "The table is the best environment to 
appreciate wine, whether you do it at home for your own enjoyment or at a 
winery for business." 
</P>
<P>
Beringer Vineyards was among the first large wineries to see the business 
sense. It started a professional chef's program in 1979 (Robert Mondavi Winery 
had installed a culinary program in 1976) which later showcased nationally and 
internationally renowned chefs. Beringer public relations director Antonia 
Allegra points out that as wineries merge with large corporations (Sterling 
Vineyards and Domaine Mumm have joined Seagram's, for instance; Inglenook, 
Beaulieu and Christian Brothers have been purchased by Heublein), the job of 
entertaining winery guests has become more of a business than a home 
entertainment event. 
</P>
<P>
Dolores Cakebread still performs the cooking duties at Cakebread Cellars, with 
the help of professionals, but she is an exception. Today the wife of the owner 
is less likely to play cook than co-host. "Most see their role as a business 
partners rather than cooks," says Allegra. When it comes to cooking, wineries 
will look around for a chef to match their style. 
</P>
<P>
Iron Horse Vineyards snapped up Mark Malicki right after he sold Truffles, a 
trend-setting restaurant in Sonoma County. His creativity, Culinary Institute 
of America (CIA) training and experience at New York's River Cafe where what 
owners Barry and Audrey Sterling were looking for. They like to entertain 
artists and writers as well as people in the wine trade. 
</P>
<P>
For a dinner honoring architect Frank Gehry, he created an entree which was a 
culinary interpretation of the artist's sculpture. When Barry Sterling wanted 
something "thoroughly American" after an austere trip to China, Malicki 
answered the request by drawing a straight line from Nanking to the United 
States, landing in Savannah. It was a regional Savannah menu he served. 
</P>
<P>
Malicki is an advocate of healthful, low-cholesterol essences, or "infusions," 
as they are sometimes called. His essences are derived from olive oil produced 
on the property for private use, flavored with herbs, seeds and vegetables. 
"The oil-based essences are a great substitute for cream and butter and they 
are very versatile," says Malicki. 
</P>
<P>
He uses the essences to baste meat, poultry, fish, shrimp or other shellfish, 
salads and vegetables. Fruit essences made with peanut or almond paste and 
fruit juices are used as sauces for desserts. 
</P>
<P>
The Iron Horse gardens, Jeffersonian in scope and character, are a source for 
Malicki's inspiration. In sawed-off wine barrels perched along the roadside 
leading to the farmhouse grow 32 different species of tomatoes, hybrid 
lettuces, squashes, artichokes, sun dried tomatoes, fava beans and leeks, as 
well as countless herbs. 
</P>
<P>
The Sterlings, Malicki and co-owner Forrest Tancer function as a team of wine 
and food tasters. They have discovered that eggs, especially omelets, go well 
with sparkling wines. "Avocado, as in guacamole, is also terrific with 
sparkling wine," says marketing director Joy Sterling, who adds that coconut 
cream with sparkling wine is another knockout combo. 
</P>
<P>
Other successes with sparkling wine are oily fish, ginger, shellfish and 
chicken. Thumbs down foods? Fruit, cheese and chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan Vineyard and Winery, founded in 1972, not only looks like a traditional 
French chateau but is unmistakably organized like one. The 32-seat oak dining 
table is laid with French royal blue china and decorated with masses of 
magnificent pastel hybrid roses grown on the property. (Roses are traditionally 
planted along fences of vineyards to color-code wine grapes; red for red wines, 
yellow and white for white wines). 
</P>
<P>
Guests of the winery sit down to a meal cooked by Brooklyn-born, French-trained 
John Caputo, and his assistant, Jean Reynolds, who also apprenticed in top 
restaurants in France. A typical lunch menu might include seafood salad with 
couscous and mint, served with a smooth 1987 Jordan Chardonnay. Grilled chicken 
served on a bed of corn and asparagus would be accompanied by a 1986 Cabernet 
Sauvignon. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's guidelines to wine and food pairing emphasize the simple idea of 
harmony between the food eaten and the wines served. The soft, rich elegant 
Jordan wines are meant to complement rather than overpower the food. "Our 
philosophy of matching food and wine is one of creating a partnership of 
flavors between the two," says Caputo. 
</P>
<P>
Some general rules followed at Jordan include serving "white wine before red, 
young before old, lesser before greater, and dry before sweet." However, Caputo 
warns against over-analyzing food and wine. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes the romance out of it. We're not scientists, we're cooks and chefs. 
The part we enjoy is the unscientific aspect." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Danko is the resident chef at Chateau Souverain and executive chef of its 
restaurant. Like several other wine country chefs, he is a protege of author 
and teacher Madeleine Kamman. (See story on Madeleine Kamman, p. 21.) He would 
pair smooth-textured avocado with Chardonnay, oysters with acidic Sauvignon 
Blanc. "It has the same effect you find as when you team port with Stilton," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He has found that Sauvignon Blanc goes well with smoked fish and Fume Blanc 
with roasted peppers. Veal is particularly suited to white wine, and red wines 
become flavorful when teamed with roasted red meats, bacon and even red beets. 
</P>
<P>
Cottage industries that started with the hippies of the early '70s have helped 
Sonoma come into its own as an important food center, says Danko. "There is a 
thriving oyster industry,and Sonoma has become the poultry capital. The county 
also produces some of the best goat cheese and lamb in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"People are just beginning to appreciate the land and what it offers. The 
county has the best of everything. Chardonnays in Sonoma are some of the finest 
and the Pinot Noir resembles those of Provence and Normandy." 
</P>
<P>
With such offerings a chef's scope is unlimited. "We use what we feel will 
balance food with wine," says Danko. "Much of what we do is dictated by the 
land. It's like letting the environment take over the body." 
</P>
<P>
Health concerns in cooking have also influenced Danko's direction in cooking. 
"We take the fat off everything now," he says. They have also led him to create 
meat essences for flavoring sauces by cooking down beef, veal and lamb, game 
birds without fat. He uses a less fatty and less heavy demiglace, originally 
described by Escoffier and resurrected by Madeleine Kamman. 
</P>
<P>
CIA graduate Stephen Benson, who perfected his skills at La Costa Hotel and Spa 
in Carlsbad, Mille Fleurs in Rancho Santa Fe and other Napa Valley restaurants, 
prepares meals for Cain Cellars owners Joyce and Jerry Cain and also for winery 
events and private parties. 
</P>
<P>
The California native brings much of his German heritage into his cooking: 
braised red cabbage, light sauces and reductions. Wine from the 552-acre Cain 
property provides the inspiration when Benson cooks. 
</P>
<P>
Sauvignon Blanc, for instance, suggests sipping with appetizers. Chardonnays 
are paired with first course dishes such as crab cakes, buttery seafood dishes 
and creamy sauces. Meat or poultry entrees might call for red wine, especially 
when fruit, such as black currants, and pepper are used in the meat sauce. 
"Pepper brings out wine wonderfully," Benson says. 
</P>
<P>
Benson enjoys using ingredients from local farmers, such as Peter Forni and 
Lynn Brown, who operate a small farm in Napa and specialize in 40 varieties of 
hybrid lettuces supplying many local chefs. Much of their produce is also 
air-shipped to top restaurants around the country. 
</P>
<P>
So dedicated are some chefs to the art of food and wine pairing, they have 
developed their own principles. Beringer's Patricia Windisch has made a 
scientific study of the art of "pairing" and concluded that acid in food should 
be kept just below the acid level in the wine. 
</P>
<P>
"When using a Chardonnay that seems acidic and a chicken or seafood dish is 
being served," she wrote in her research paper, "Secrets of a Winery Chef," 
"add an acid to the sauce in the form of lemon, lime, balsamic vinegar or 
reduced wine. That touch of acid in the dish will soften the acidic quality of 
the wine; conversely, when the wine seems low in acid, a creamy sauce that is 
high in lactose (sugar) and more alkaline in character will help raise the 
acidic perception of the wine." 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, in a meal created for a designer's show house luncheon Windisch 
paired macerated melon and berries with Late Harvest Johannisberg riesling, a 
rather sweet and fruity wine. 
</P>
<P>
Napa's century-old Inglenook Vineyard, tucked in a "nook" of the Rutherford 
Hills, first installed a resident chef in 1980. After a competition involving 
more than 60 candidates, the job went to Jamie Morningstar, a CCA graduate and, 
by coincidence, a great-granddaughter of Gustave Niebaum, Inglenook's 19th 
century founder. She prepares special meals for guests of the winery, holds 
classes in matching of food and wine, and travels widely to showcase the 
Hueblein-owned Inglenook estate bottled wines (not to be confused with 
Inglenook jug wines). 
</P>
<P>
"I have found," she says, "that matching acidic wine with acidic foods tends to 
have a neutralizing effect. A Sauvignon Blanc, for instance, which is acidic, 
plays well with bold flavors of salsas and other fiery foods. Chardonnays, 
which are less acidic, find harmony when paired with pastas and rich, creamy 
sauces." 
</P>
<P>
For a dish of chicken topped with a herb butter, Morningstar selected 1985 
Cabernet Sauvignon from the Inglenook-Napa Valley. With strawberries macerated 
in liqueur she served 1986 Late Harvest Gewurztraminer, to match the sweetness 
of the strawberries and liqueur at harmonious levels with the wine. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Velardi, a graduate of the California Culinary Academy (CCA) in San 
Francisco, was resident chef for the officers on a Sagafjord-Cunard Lines 
Alaska cruise before joining Gloria Ferrer Champagne Caves four years ago. In 
keeping with Gloria Ferrer's Spanish origins (the parent company is Freixenet, 
a leading producer of methode champenoise sparkling wine in Spain), Velardi 
serves tapas on the winery patios each Sunday. She also prepares meals for 
visitors in the wine trade. The winery is also open to privately catered events 
and weddings. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of staff winery chefs is becoming so fashionable that neighbors hardly 
can keep up with growing numbers. Few wine country residents, for instance, 
could tell you that the small (20,000 case) Frog's Leap Winery now boasts a 
resident chef. True, Bev Salinger also handles office duties, but the CCA 
graduate is still called upon several times a week to entertain private guests 
of the owners, Larry Turley and John and Julie Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Frog's Leap sits back from the road in rustic surroundings that suggest the 
romantic countrified rompings of a modern Marie Antoinette, undistinguished but 
for the bright green mail box that identifies the winery to 
"by-appointment-only visitors." A babbling brook behind the main house shimmers 
in the midday sun streaming through lacy oaks. 
</P>
<P>
The air is filled by the aroma of huge Washington State oysters barbecuing on 
the grill. The oysters, purchased at Johnson's Oyster Farm at Point Reyes in 
nearby Marin County were specifically selected to complement the 1986 Sauvignon 
Blanc being served. 
</P>
<P>
Salinger, who worked for 10 years at Domaine Chandon before joining Frog's 
Leap, believes that some portion of the wine appearing in the food should be 
the one served with the food. A Cabernet Sauvignon used in a sauce for lamb 
would also appear on the table as the wine of choice. A strawberry coulis 
served with chocolate might contain a touch of Zinfandel, which also 
complements chocolate desserts. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the recipes and menus with wine suggestions derived from the 
Napa-Sonoma chefs.

DEBATE OVER PACKAGING HEATING UP; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: THE FDA IS CONCERNED THAT SOME CHEMICALS FROM FOOD CONTAINERS MAY ENTER 
THE FOOD DURING COOKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Some microwave packaging may disintegrate when exposed to high cooking 
temperatures, causing potentially harmful chemicals to enter food, a federal 
report stated. 
</P>
<P>
Those containers most likely to pose problems are known as heat susceptors 
designed to elevate temperatures -- some to 500 degrees F. -- during 
microwaving. 
</P>
<P>
The packaging is used on such traditional microwave products as popcorn, pizza, 
French fries, fish sticks and Belgian waffles, according to the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, the susceptors are marketed as "browning" or "crisping" devices. The 
microwave would be unable to brown food -- as is the case in conventional ovens 
-- without the presence of these items in the packaging. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's concern also extends to plastic "dual ovenables," or those 
containers prepared for use in either the conventional or microwave oven. 
</P>
<P>
"The FDA is concerned . . . . that such high-temperature use of these materials 
may cause packaging components such as adhesives, polymers, paper and 
paperboard -- known as indirect food additives -- to migrate into food at 
excessive levels," said a recent report in FDA Consumer magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The agency identified at least two compounds that have migrated from microwave 
packaging directly into food. In a September, 1989, test of microwave French 
fried potatoes, federal researchers found minute levels of polyethylene 
terephthalate in addition to diethylene glycol dibenzoate. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, the agency has requested that the packaging and food industries 
voluntarily provide research indicating that partial dissolution of these 
materials, and subsequent migration of the chemicals into food, is safe. The 
information has not been forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, FDA has stepped up its efforts and published a notice last year 
that establishes a deadline for manufacturers to submit the data. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA must approve all additives -- direct or indirect -- that may be 
consumed in processed food. Even unintended results, such as the leaching of 
chemicals from microwave packaging, must receive the agency's approval. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in its report on the problem, the FDA made an unusual concession. It 
stated that the agency had not been "ready" for the introduction of these 
packaging innovations and was surprised to learn that the devices could raise 
microwave oven temperatures to 500 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the agency admits it is "working to keep up" with the technology and is 
placed in a position where it must retroactively determine the safety of a 
processing technique that has been in use for years. Sales of 
microwaved-packaged foods are expected to reach $3 billion by 1992, according 
to the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
In preliminary tests, agency researchers found that these heat susceptor pads 
reach such high temperatures that they actually become charred and can cause a 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
"The food-contact surface of heat susceptor packaging is usually a metalized 
polyethylene terephthalate film laminated to paperboard with adhesive. This 
metalized film absorbs the microwave energy in the oven and, with most of the 
microwave absorbed, the package becomes a little 'frying pan' that actively 
participates in the cooking," according to an FDA account of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Although the FDA approved some of these compounds for food packaging as early 
as 1958, the approval was based on oven temperatures of only 300 degrees F., 
not the high levels being created by today's products. In fact, the dual 
ovenables are also a concern because consumers often heat the containers at 350 
degrees to 400 degrees in conventional ovens for long periods of time and thus 
risk some disintegration of the packaging. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA has stated that research to date does not indicate any public health 
problem with heat susceptors or dual ovenables. The agency also claims that 
this type of packaging represents only a small portion of the total microwave 
packaging category. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the federal government has issued a series of guidelines for 
consumer protection. 
</P>
<P>
They are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do not exceed microwaving times recommended on package instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If packaging, such as popcorn bags, becomes extremely brown or charred do 
not consume the product. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Carefully watch the microwave oven when microwaving popcorn because heat 
buildup can cause a fire. Time heating precisely according to label 
instructions. Favor the shorter recommended cooking times (some ovens can 
scorch popcorn in two minutes). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do not reuse heat susceptors, and do not use them for a purpose other than 
that originally intended by the manufacturer. Handle these packages very 
carefully because they can be very hot to the touch. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Avoid letting plastic wrap touch foods during microwaving because the 
plastic can melt, causing compounds known as plasticizers to enter food. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never heat foods in brown grocery bags or newspapers because both contain 
recycled materials and metals that could cause a fire.

TANKS CITED IN SALMONELLA SURGE; 
</P>
<P>
FOOD SAFETY: HARMFUL BACTERIA MIGRATE AMONG CHICKENS POOLED IN HUGE VATS OF 
WATER, STUDY SHOWS. 
</P>

<P>
A commonly used processing technique is responsible for the elevated Salmonella 
contamination rates in raw chicken, according to a federal study. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers found that the number of chicken carrying the harmful bacteria 
triples when carcasses are pooled in huge tanks of chilled water in the plant. 
</P>
<P>
The report, which appeared in a recent issue of the Journal of Food Protection, 
was prepared by H. S. Lillard, a researcher with the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture in Athens, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
The poultry industry is attempting to solve the problem, but health officials 
say it could be as much as a year before any effective methods are implemented. 
</P>
<P>
"(The study) is nothing alarming," said Kenneth N. May, scientific adviser for 
the National Broiler Council, a Washington-based trade association. 
</P>
<P>
The "chiller tank" was identified as the most likely place for 
cross-contamination to take place. Salmonella-free birds are routinely thrown 
together with chicken potentially infected with the bacteria, giving the 
Salmonella the opportunity to migrate from one bird to another. 
</P>
<P>
As in the past, federal officials involved with the nation's meat inspection 
program said that the bacteria's presence is not cause for concern because 
proper storage, handling and cooking of chicken will destroy the organism and 
prevent illness. 
</P>
<P>
A top USDA official also said that even though the chiller tank seems to 
increase the Salmonella contamination, it also serves a useful purpose in 
dissipating the bacteria's concentration on some birds. Namely, more chickens 
wind up contaminated but the extent of the bacteria's presence is lessened. 
</P>
<P>
"Dilution of the total number of organisms per bird is a good development," 
said Lester Crawford, administrator of the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection 
Program. "The fewer (cells) per bird the better off you are because a certain 
number of cells is needed to cause disease . . . " 
</P>
<P>
May, of the Broiler Council, also emphasized that reducing the number of 
bacteria per bird is a positive processing technique. "The paper shows overall 
that our processing procedures are good because we are reducing the number of 
organisms (per carcass) as we go through the plant " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford estimated that as many as 500,000 Salmonella cells are required to 
cause illness. That number drops rapidly, however, for those considered at high 
risk such as infants, pregnant women, the elderly and others with impaired 
immune systems such as cancer or AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
Lillard acknowledged that the number of Salmonella cells found in her research 
were small, about one per gram of material tested. Even so, a few cells can 
multiply into a greater health threat in the home or restaurant if the chicken 
is improperly handled or stored. 
</P>
<P>
Lillard found that in the five poultry processing steps prior to immersion in 
the chiller tank only 11% to 19% of the samples tested positive for Salmonella. 
However, after the birds were pooled in the chiller tank the contamination rate 
jumped to 36.9% of the total, or an increase of anywhere from 94% to 235%. 
</P>
<P>
She also tested the chiller tank water and found it to be positive for 
Salmonella 53% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Significant cross contamination occurred at only one of six sampling points 
throughout the plant tested," according to Lillard. "A significant increase in 
Salmonella incidence for carcasses occurred only after immersion chilling, 
suggesting that this process is more conducive to cross-contamination than 
other processing points in the plant." 
</P>
<P>
Federal health officials and industry representatives have long known that the 
chiller tanks were a potential contamination point. However, Lillard's data is 
the best to date on the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lillard study shows that (the chiller tank) is where substantial 
contamination occurs," said Rod Leonard, executive director of the Community 
Nutrition Institute, a Washington-based consumer group. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, scientists believed that the addition of chlorine, at a level not 
to exceed 20 parts per million, was sufficient to control the spread of 
Salmonella in the chiller tanks. However, the plants studied by Lillard did not 
add chlorine to the chiller tanks. Even so, researchers have found that 
chlorine's potential sterilization effects are negated by proteins, such as 
chicken meat, fat and skin, present in the chiller tank water. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard, one of the poultry industry's chief critics, said, "You can't get 
control of bacteria with chlorine because it is frequently neutralized by 
protein. Nor can you pour it into the tank in such heavy doses so it effects 
the flavor of the bird." 
</P>
<P>
The USDA's Crawford acknowledged that some plants do not even use chlorine in 
the chiller tanks. 
</P>
<P>
"The water isn't always chlorinated and it should be to the level of drinking 
water," he said. 
</P>
<P>
May acknowledged that all firms should use chlorine in the chiller tanks to 
kill Salmonella even though the compound's addition is not required by the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that the contamination problem exists, several food firms have 
applied for federal permission to use compounds other than chlorine to kill 
Salmonella that may be present in the chiller tanks. It will be a year before 
any new additive is approved for use, according to a U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration official. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry has a variety of food additive petitions (filed at FDA) right now 
(that are designed) to knock down Salmonella in the poultry chill tanks," said 
Joe Madden, acting director of the FDA's division of microbiology. "The 
industry is working toward cleaning up (its) act." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being ineffective as a Salmonella control, the chlorine used by 
poultry processors has apparently caused headaches in plant workers, Madden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers can protect themselves from any Salmonella that may be present by 
heating chicken to an internal temperature of between 175 and 180 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
All surfaces that come in contact with raw meat should be cleansed immediately 
with hot water and soap including cutting boards, knives, cooking utensils and 
storage containers. Raw chicken stored in the refrigerator should be placed on 
a plate to prevent liquid from dripping onto others foods that are to be eaten 
raw.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: SURPRISE: LA LUZ ON OLVERA ST. HAS REAL MEXICAN FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine stumbling into a restaurant that at first glance seems like all other 
restaurants of its type, only to realize that you found the real thing, 
tap-tap-tapping ladies and all. 
</P>
<P>
The last place you'd expect to find a real Mexican joint is among the Maraca 
vendors and befuddled German tourists of Olvera Street, but there it is, La Luz 
del Dia, stuffing soft tacos with delicious picadillo and serving cactus salad 
to the hordes. Otherwise, Olvera Street isn't exactly a center of fine dining, 
unless your idea of Mexican food begins and ends with the Number Two Enchilada 
platter. 
</P>
<P>
La Luz's dark wood and gaily colored tiles don't look that different from the 
interior of any other restaurant on Olvera Street, and its menu is 
superficially the same. In its own way, it seems to be something of a prototype 
for the California-Mexican restaurants that dot every metropolis from Paris to 
Tokyo. But the food, long on pig parts and amped-up with chiles, is definitely 
tailored more for the Mexican families who pack the place than for the tourists 
who prowl Olvera Street looking for jumping beans. 
</P>
<P>
You wait in line as at Philippe's, scanning a small menu posted on one wall, 
and when you finally get to the front you have about six seconds to order 
before the counter woman goes on to the man standing behind you. (Half the 
dishes at the place seem to be unlisted -- pointing at interesting looking pots 
of stew or trays of chile relleno is perfectly appropriate.) She slaps the food 
on your plate cafeteria style; another woman puts on thick, hot tortillas; a 
third adds something else. After you've selected a Mexican beer and paid, a 
creaky waiter materializes to carry your tray to a table: Do your tipping on 
the spot. 
</P>
<P>
La Luz is a simple place, and most of what it serves are basically permutations 
of the two or three things it does best. So whatever you think you ordered, 
you'll probably get at least one helping of picadillo, the chunky Mexican beef 
stew that La Luz puts in tacos, on tostadas and in combination platters. With 
its carrots and potatoes, picadillo looks like a stew somebody's mother might 
have made -- provided somebody's mother has an industrial-size garlic press and 
the Thai tolerance for chile heat. 
</P>
<P>
Chicharrones, fried pork skins, come sogged with a truly awesome version of 
what gets slopped on enchiladas in chain restaurants, a chile sauce that's as 
sophisticated in its slight bitterness as a dry martini. Crispy carnitas -- 
rich bits of fried pork just about perfect for folding into a tortilla with a 
bit of the good house beans and a dollop of guacamole -- rank with the nicest 
in town. The rice, of a type utterly familiar to anyone who grew up on L.A. 
Mexican food, is fine. (Skip the dryish tamales.) 
</P>
<P>
Don't forget to order a fresh cactus salad: crunchy, lively with citrus and not 
nearly as slimy as cactus can be. OK, so it's a little slimy, but kind of 
refreshing after all that chile. And 100% guaranteed spine-free.

YOU ASKED ABOUT: SHELLS THE KEY WHEN COOKING CLAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Why are we told not to eat clams if the shells don't open during 
cooking? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: According to Howard Hillman, author of "Kitchen Science" (Houghton 
Mifflin, 1981), "When a healthy clam, mussel or oyster expires, so does the 
holding power of the muscle that keeps the two shells tightly closed. If the 
shells do not open after the bivalve is cooked (and hence killed), it wasn't 
alive in the first place. Something other than the abductor muscle -- perhaps 
an oily mass of mud -- was keeping the shells closed." 
</P>
<P>
Hillman also warns not to cook a clam that refuses to close its shell. "It is 
quite natural for a healthy clam (or mussel or oyster) to open its shell if it 
feels relaxed as it rests on a bed of ice or in a bucket of cold water. 
However, it is unnatural for one of these bivalves not to clamp its twin shells 
tightly shut if you frighten it, say, by giving it a firm flick with your 
finger. Closing its shell in response to such an external stimulus is the 
shellfish's only meaningful defense. Should your threat not evoke the safety 
mechanisms designed by nature, the bivalve is dead or dying and may therefore 
be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms or toxins." 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have planted Chinese peas for three years now. They produce many pods. I 
have tried to freeze them -- no luck. They turn gray and unappetizing. Have you 
any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
A: The "Ball Blue Book -- The Guide to Home Canning and Freezing" (Ball Corp., 
1989) says to "select firm, unblemished pods. Wash and scald two minutes. Cool; 
drain, and pack in can or freeze jars or plastic freezer boxes. Seal; label and 
freeze."

COOK IT LIGHT: TOMATOES: THE MEAT OF A SIMPLE PASTA SAUCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNE JONES, Jones is a food consultant and a cookbook author.

<TEXT>
<P>
I look forward each year to the time when fresh basil is readily available 
because it is a necessary ingredient in my own favorite pasta sauce. This sauce 
is made with raw tomatoes, and in Italy it is called by a variety of names. 
</P>
<P>
On menus it is sometimes called Pasta Pomodoro Cruda, which means simply pasta 
with raw tomato sauce. This dish is also called Pasta Margherita and Pasta a la 
Checca. In Tuscany, the sauce is spread on toast as an appetizer or hors 
d'oeuvre. 
</P>
<P>
The secret to success in this recipe is to allow the tomatoes to drain for at 
least two hours. This concentrates their flavor and makes a much tastier sauce. 
</P>
<P>
A trick I learned in Italy is to freeze vine-ripened tomatoes when they are at 
their peak so you will have truly flavorful tomatoes all year. Then, to peel 
them, just put them in warm water and they literally pop out of their skins. 
</P>
<P>
FRESH TOMATO AND BASIL SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
2 pounds ripe tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
2 cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup chopped fresh basil leaves 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon crushed dried red pepper, or to taste 
</P>
<P>
Cooked pasta 
</P>
<P>
Plunge tomatoes in boiling water 10 seconds to remove peel easily. Drain 
tomatoes, then peel and dice. There should be about 4 cups. Sprinkle with salt 
and mix well. Place salted tomatoes in colander and allow to drain 2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Combine garlic, basil leaves, parsley, olive oil and black and red peppers. Add 
drained tomatoes and mix well. Serve over pasta. Makes 3 cups sauce or 6 
(1/2-cup) servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Sauce may also be served over rice, fish or poultry. 
</P>

 Each serving contains approximately 67 calories; no cholesterol; 5 grams fat; 
197 milligrams sodium.

CHECKOUT COUNTER LINE CAN TELL YOU A LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH STONE, Stone is the author of Black Sheep and Kissing Cousins: How 
Our Family Stories Shape Us. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Last week, I hurried into the supermarket to pick up a gallon of milk on my way 
home from work. Scanning my options at the checkout counters, I decided to get 
in line behind a woman who had only a basket rather than a cart. With her 
sensible shoes and regular green coat, she seemed a perfectly ordinary-looking 
woman in her early 50s. 
</P>
<P>
Then I glimpsed into her basket. She had: two enormous bags of bird seed, one 
large bag of unshelled peanuts, one large bag of unshelled almonds and two 
large bags of unshelled walnuts. Nothing else. Not a container of yogurt or a 
can of soup. 
</P>
<P>
My friends say, fondly of course, that I'm a "nosybody." I think of myself as 
following Henry James' advice -- "Be one of those on whom nothing is missed" -- 
but either way, I've been like this since I was tall enough to look into the 
neighbors' windows. 
</P>
<P>
This personal detail notwithstanding, I have to confess that I'm always 
surprised at the assumption, widely reiterated on talk shows and in newspaper 
columns, that city dwellers live their lives unnoticed. Well, not by me they 
don't. 
</P>
<P>
The pigeon-and-squirrel lady's supermarket basket was, like all of ours, a 
picture window with no curtains, revealing what was probably her most 
extravagant idiosyncrasy. Who needs to read in the National Enquirer about a 
lady who eats with the elephants when you find her right ahead of you in the 
checkout line? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, a professional "basketcaser" discovers the banal as often as the 
bizarre. Take me, for instance. Had my neighborhood St. Frances of Assisi 
peered into my boring old basket she would have known from the gallon of 1% 
milk that a lot of my life is Kinder and Kuche. 
</P>
<P>
And cereal choice, it turns out, speaks eloquently about family life. Anyone 
loading up on cereals with bits shaped like identifiable objects -- vampire 
bats or wheels with spokes -- or tinged in horrible greens or blues probably 
has children old enough to nag persistently. 
</P>
<P>
As for socioeconomic matters, the supermarket cart can reveal more than the tax 
return. Those people stocking up on shiitake mushrooms, endive and pignoli nuts 
-- you just know they have a Cuisinart at home. But don't be misled by the 
people with those dreadful black-and-white boxes from the no-frills section. 
The people who collect those stark boxes probably also save string and rubber 
bands. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to determine who lives alone and who doesn't. Single men seem to 
spend a lot of their free time in the supermarket; the surest sign of their 
eligibility is the fact that they eschew carts and favor baskets. Not long ago, 
I saw a man, wearing Topsiders and looking very L.L. Beanish, heading for the 
cat food section. After that, he bought three cans of tuna fish, lettuce and 
three oranges. Clearly, he was not a bachelor under the sway of Julia Child, 
but at least he wasn't a man who subsisted on garbage. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, I saw a woman in a jogging outfit, with yogurt, tofu, wheat germ and 
Evian water in her basket. The potato chips also in there bespoke either an 
errand for someone else or a refreshing lack of rigidity. In either case, I 
felt kindly disposed to her. 
</P>
<P>
I've now managed to get my husband interested in these matters too, and he came 
home the other day concerned about the health and longevity of our local 
firefighters. He'd seen one of them stocking up on enough steak to feed the 
entire crew for a week, which is probably exactly what his intentions were, and 
my husband spent the rest of the day worrying about their collective 
cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, meanings don't always line up as neatly as Pringle's potato chips. 
Sometimes the contents of a cart -- or what the goods mean, anyhow -- remain as 
opaque as a tin can of spinach. Once I watched a man pace aisle after aisle. He 
finally turned up at the checkout counter with one spice jar of crystallized 
ginger, one jar of poppy seeds and one bottle of horseradish. After prolonged 
inner wrestling (during which the cashier clicked her very long red fingernails 
against her register impatiently), the man decided against purchasing the 
horseradish. What could have been on his mind? I think I really didn't want to 
know. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent (and most fascinating) cart I saw had in it: four small boxes 
of animal crackers, a pineapple, a yahrzeit candle, a package of flavoring for 
Italian dressing and several very elaborate boxes of frozen vegetables. The 
woman wheeling it was black. 
</P>
<P>
Thrilled at my own first speculations about her life -- was she an Ethiopian 
Jew with four young children who like pineapple marinade? -- I decided to stalk 
her, subtly, of course. I noticed she put the animal crackers back on the 
shelf. Then I watched her put back the packet of salad dressing. Had she 
counted up her money and realized she hadn't brought enough? Then the pineapple 
rejoined its tropical companions. Was she only returning things? What could 
this mean? 
</P>
<P>
I hurried around to the other side of the fruit bin to get a better view of the 
woman's cart and the woman herself. And that's when I saw what Henry James 
would certainly not have missed. The woman was wearing a name tag, a big round 
name tag with the familiar A&amp;P logo. She was simply an employee reshelving 
items. 
</P>
<P>
Chastened, I went home in a hurry, leaving behind my basket of peanut butter 
and borderline junk food for her to contemplate if she cared to.

FULL DISCLOSURE ABOUT NUTRIENTS IN BABY FOOD?; 
</P>
<P>
LABELING: GERBERS, HEINZ AND OTHER COMPANIES FEEL IT MAY BE MISLEADING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The message seems simple: Feed your baby like a baby, not like an adult. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone -- from baby food manufacturers to medical doctors -- agrees that 
parents shouldn't give their babies skim instead of whole milk, take away sweet 
or salty snacks or pump up fiber in the diet. The reason: babies under age 2 
need fat and calories or growth and development may be stunted. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone agrees what nutritional information should be on a baby food 
label. 
</P>
<P>
Gerber and Heinz, two of the major baby food manufacturers, say that they 
should be allowed to keep the amount of fatty acids (saturated fat and 
unsaturated fat), cholesterol and fiber off the label because well-meaning 
parents may be misled. The companies are lobbying for an exemption from 
proposed federal bills that would require more information on all food labels. 
</P>
<P>
The critics of their policy, including the doctor who did the study that Gerber 
uses to prove parents are feeding their babies like adults, insist secrecy is 
not the right answer. What we need, they say, is full disclosure of nutrients 
plus a warning message on the label. 
</P>
<P>
Gerber Products Co., the company with more than 70% of the baby food market, 
has been the most vocal on the issue. During the past year, the company has 
distributed 1.5 million free booklets to physicians, dietitians and parents. 
The full-color, 20-page booklet, "Dietary Guidelines for Infants," uses the 
format of the "Dietary Guidelines for Americans" to compare the dietary needs 
of children under age 2 with adults. Gerber also paid the organizers of the 
International Food Media Conference a $5,000 sponsor fee so it could bring its 
message on the labeling exemption to the press. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern as a nutritionist is that nutrition labeling of fatty acids, 
cholesterol and fiber on a baby food label can mislead parents with the 
implication that babies' dietary needs are the same as those of adults," said 
Sandra Bartholmey, manager of nutrition at Gerber's research division. 
</P>
<P>
"If we label the saturated fat, cholesterol and fiber content, parents who look 
for these things in the adult food aisles will continue to look for low-fat, 
high-fiber and low cholesterol in the baby food aisle where it is really not 
appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Ida LaQuatra, director of nutrition services at Heinz, agreed. She said that 
her company supports mandatory cholesterol and fatty acid labeling on all food 
products except baby foods. 
</P>
<P>
"A parent might not want to feed their child pureed liver because it is high in 
cholesterol," Ms. LaQuatra said. "Since heart disease is a No. 1 killer and 
baby boomers are getting into prevention they may try to put their whole family 
on a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet." 
</P>
<P>
But the critics insist keeping the information from parents will not solve the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly favors nutritional labeling of baby 
foods, but does not endorse the use of health messages on the labels, said 
spokesman Ray Koteras. Baby food labels should include protein, fat and 
carbohydrates listed in grams as well as the percent of calories they 
constitute in the food, according to the academy. Components of fat -- 
saturated, monosaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids -- also should be 
listed. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents need information to make wise food choices for their children," says 
the academy. "Food labels offer an excellent opportunity to have such 
information available at the time of purchase." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the American Heart Assn. supports mandatory nutritional labeling for 
all foods, including baby foods, according to spokeswoman Vicki Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't educate consumers by hiding information from them," added Bonnie 
Liebman, staff nutritionist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, 
a nonprofit consumer group in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"If they (the baby food companies)) are worried about consumers cutting their 
babies' fat intake, then they should explain on the labels that anyone under 
age two should not restrict fat and cholesterol intake. If you want to educate 
consumers, you give them more information, not less." 
</P>
<P>
The baby food companies say that the warning would be a good idea, but the 
small labels have little room to provide additional information. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond the labeling issue, just how big is this under-feeding problem? Are 
we starving our children to make them healthy? 
</P>
<P>
Gerber's press releases point to "studies, such as the one by Dr. Fima 
Lifshitz," which show that infants placed on a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet 
may not grow and develop normally. A Baltimore Sun computer search of the 
medical literature shows that long-term studies are lacking, and the Lifshitz 
study is the only study on the so-called "failure to thrive syndrome" that 
features middle- and upper-class families who are feeding their babies like 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
The Lifshitz study, published in the August 1987 issue of Pediatrics, described 
the experience of treating seven infants, ranging from seven to 22 months old. 
All weighed less than 95% of normal babies of the same height and some had 
stopped growing. 
</P>
<P>
After looking at typical causes such as disease and neglect, the doctors found 
all the infants had been given less food than normal and only raw vegetables as 
between-meal snacks, if they were allowed to snack at all. Some received only 
low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk. 
</P>
<P>
Lifshitz, associate director of pediatrics at North Shore University 
Hospital-Cornell University Medical College, on Long Island, N.Y., said that he 
has now seen about 16 infants who are failing to thrive because of inadequate 
diets based on current health beliefs. In these cases, he said three factors 
were present -- parents were trying to keep their children from becoming obese, 
they were feeding them diets low in fat and cholesterol and they were avoiding 
feeding their babies junk food. 
</P>
<P>
Lifshitz said that he has heard of and read reports of the failure to thrive 
syndrome in children of health-conscious parents, but even he doesn't know how 
widespread the problem is. It's hard to count the victims, he said, because 
pediatricians see growth problems, suggest diet changes and the babies recover. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping nutritional information on fats, cholesterol and fiber won't solve the 
problem, he added. Although Gerber uses Lifshitz' research to prove its point, 
he, himself, does not endorse its labeling policy. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that everything should be labeled and the public should be educated 
to read those labels," he said. "Foods should be labeled for scientific 
purposes and not just for propaganda. Maybe they could include a caveat 
indicating the diet appropriate for babies. I do not believe in withholding 
information from the parents." 
</P>
<P>
Gerber's public relations effort has promoted the results of two surveys of 
parents of children under age two who called the Gerber hot line. The callers 
were asked: "Does adult nutrition information influence what you feed your 
baby? If yes, how?" In March 1989, 48% of the 1,002 parents polled said they 
were feeding their babies like adults. This year, the percentage dropped to 37% 
of 902 parents. Eight out of 10 of the last group said they limited or avoided 
fat or cholesterol, sugar or sodium or combinations of these nutrients in their 
child's diet.

When questioned about the scientific validity of the survey, Bartholmey 
admitted that it was a random rather than scientific survey, based on a 
self-selected group of people who called the hot line with questions on baby 
food.

<P>
Other experts are skeptical that the problem is as widespread as the picture 
Gerber paints.

"I am not sure that I believe that one-third of all parents are feeding their 
infants too little fat," says Ms. Liebman of the Center for Science in the 
Public Interest. "My guess is that 37% of parents are not feeding their 
children skim milk instead of whole milk. I don't have any reason to think that 
masses of 1-year-olds are malnourished because their parents are feeding them 
too many vegetables. There is certainly no evidence that's the case."

COALITION ATTEMPTS TO RESTRUCTURE COUNCIL; 
</P>
<P>
REPRESENTATION: THE CITIZENS GROUP SAID IT HAS GATHERED ENOUGH SUPPORT FOR A 
BALLOT MEASURE TO BREAK UP GLENDALE INTO FIVE CITY COUNCIL DISTRICTS.

<P>
A petition drive that could shatter Glendale's political structure appears to 
have gathered enough signatures to go before voters in November or April. 
</P>
<P>
Nearing the end of a six-month effort, a small group of civic dissidents called 
the Coalition for Electoral Reform this week claimed to have gathered at least 
11,000 names on an initiative calling for a change to district City Council 
representation in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by voters, it would divide the city into five council districts, 
each with a single elected representative. The measure would probably cause at 
least two current council members to lose their seats. It would also spark a 
scramble for political power in sections of Glendale that now appear to have 
little clout in the city's decision making. 
</P>
<P>
Coalition members have accused the current council of catering to politically 
active north Glendale neighborhoods and downtown business leaders while 
neglecting less affluent south Glendale areas and remote communities such as La 
Crescenta and Montrose. 
</P>
<P>
The group has little funding and no support from Glendale's mainstream 
political leaders, but its members believe they have tapped into widespread 
discontent with the city's present leadership. 
</P>
<P>
In the closing days of the campaign, coalition leaders continued to collect 
signatures. Arthur Segien, a Glendale apartment owner and City Hall gadfly who 
chairs the coalition, sat behind a card table outside a supermarket Monday, 
vying for the attention of shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
"Want to sign a petition for better government in Glendale?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
When Laurell Gaines stopped at the table, Segien showed her a map of the city. 
Three City Council members live in the affluent Chevy Chase Canyon community, 
he told her, and the other two also live in the northern Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Segien, 78, said his petition would require that council members come from all 
parts of Glendale, ensuring broader representation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like this city government," Gaines said after signing the petition. 
"You don't have a representative in your area. You write a letter to the 
council members and to the mayor, and they ignore it." 
</P>
<P>
Segien smiled. "We get that all the time," he said. "They're not responsive to 
the people at all. That's a big complaint." 
</P>
<P>
The coalition leader said his group will submit its petitions to the Glendale 
city clerk's office on Monday, two days before its 180-day gathering period 
expires. With a week to go, he said the group had roughly 11,000 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale had about 69,500 registered voters at the time the petition drive was 
launched. The coalition needs valid signatures from 15% of them -- about 10,400 
names -- to put the initiative on the November general election ballot. With 
10%, the measure would appear on next April's municipal election ballot. 
</P>
<P>
When the petitions are checked by the Los Angeles County Registrar, a number of 
signatures will probably be disqualified because of duplication or because the 
signer was not registered to vote in Glendale. As a result, it may be several 
weeks before residents learn whether the measure has qualified for the ballot 
and for which election. 
</P>
<P>
If voters approve it, the council must divide the city into five districts, 
each with roughly the same population. The measure forbids odd-shaped district 
boundaries, which might allow all or most of the current members to continue in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
If the initiative is approved in November, the election for district council 
members would occur in April. If the measure does not appear on the ballot 
until April and is then approved, the first district council members would be 
chosen in a later election. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative also would require that a district council member receive a 
majority of the votes, even if a runoff election is needed. Currently, 
Glendale's at-large council seats go to the top vote-getters, even if the 
candidates receive less than 50%. 
</P>
<P>
If the measure qualifies for the ballot, it will undoubtedly trigger a powerful 
opposition campaign by well-organized and well-financed Glendale leaders who 
want to preserve the present system. A similar ballot measure was voted down in 
1975. 
</P>
<P>
The current council members have pulled no punches in attacking the district 
elections plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's probably one of the worst possible things that could happen in 
this city," said Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg. 
</P>
<P>
Bremberg is one of the three council members who live in Chevy Chase Canyon, 
and district elections could allow only one to remain on the council. 
Nevertheless, Bremberg insisted that the current elected officials are opposed 
to district elections "not from a position of saving our jobs, but saving the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale residents now vote for five council members. Under the district plan, 
residents could vote only for the council member serving their area, and the 
candidate must live in that district. The system is used in cities such as Los 
Angeles and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's present council members say district elections would reduce a 
resident's ability to influence City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of having five representatives to deal with, the residents will have 
only one," Mayor Larry Zarian said. "I'm very concerned about pork-barrel 
politics, Chicago-style." 
</P>
<P>
He and Bremberg predicted that a district system would prompt more "back-room 
deals" in which council members would trade support for projects in one 
another's districts. 
</P>
<P>
Bremberg, who is usually at City Hall every day, and Zarian, who conducts 
regular public forums, said no south Glendale residents have complained to them 
that their area is under-served. Bremberg and Zarian also said the council has 
funded more improvements in south Glendale in recent years than in any other 
part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not heard any good arguments that Glendale needs districts," the mayor 
said. Bremberg pointed out that the petition drive was launched by Richard 
Seeley and Robin Westmiller, two candidates who lost in Glendale's April, 1989, 
council election. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect that the defeated candidates want to see if they can get on the 
council by reducing the number of votes they'd need," Bremberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Westmiller, Seeley and Segien all deny that they are planning to seek a 
district council seat. In fact, Westmiller said she is selling her Glendale 
home and will move out of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Seeley said fewer than 10 activists are doing the lion's share of the signature 
collection. He and Segien have paid some people 50 to 75 cents per name to seek 
signatures, but the coalition leaders said those names make up a small portion 
of the total. 
</P>
<P>
Westmiller said she hopes the measure qualifies for the November ballot, when 
Californians will flock to the polls to choose a new governor. 
</P>
<P>
"My preference right now is getting the darned thing passed," she said. In 
November "it might get buried under everything, although we'd have the 
advantage of a larger turnout." 
</P>
<P>
Other activists said the city's own April ballot would focus more attention on 
the measure and give the coalition more time to campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd have to seek contributions," Seeley said. "Obviously, you can't run a 
campaign without money. The other thing is communication. That's the biggest 
problem we have. Communicating with the public is very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
He said the coalition will also have to combat widespread voter apathy and low 
registration trends in some parts of Glendale. Without strong support from 
those who feel neglected by City Hall, the voters who support the present 
council will defeat the district plan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Westmiller believes opposition to Glendale's present leadership is strong 
enough to ensure approval of the council districts initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have to do anything," she said. "The current City Council is doing 
everything it can to make sure it does pass."

ELECTIONS SCHOOL TAX; 
</P>
<P>
ABSENTEE BALLOTS WILL DETERMINE FATE OF PARCEL LEVY; 
</P>
<P>
BEVERLY HILLS: THE MEASURE IS 21 VOTES SHORT OF APPROVAL. ABOUT 100 ABSENTEE 
VOTES ARE UNCOUNTED.

<P>
After months of campaigning and an eleventh-hour, get-out-the-vote push, 
proponents of a schools tax in Beverly Hills found that gratification -- or 
even depression -- doesn't come easily. 
</P>
<P>
A parcel tax measure on Tuesday's ballot, which would raise $4.5 million for 
the Beverly Hills Unified School District, has so far garnered 66.42% of the 
votes, short of the two-thirds needed for passage. But a number of absentee 
ballots remain to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
Those ballots will be counted during a canvass, which begins today and will 
likely be finished by June 26, said Henrietta Willis, spokeswoman with the Los 
Angeles County registrar-recorder. It is uncertain when the election results 
will be known because "there's no way of determining if (an absentee ballot) is 
a ballot for Beverly Hills, or Malibu, or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
County elections officials have told the Beverly Hills city clerk that about 
100 Beverly Hills absentee ballots have not been counted, the city clerk's 
office said Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Tax proponents were 21 votes shy of the magic number. According to the 
semiofficial returns, 5855 votes for the tax had been counted, with 2959 votes 
against. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't cry, and you can't celebrate," Peter Tomarken, husband of school 
board member Dana Tomarken, said early Wednesday at the Yes on Schools 
Committee headquarters. The committee has campaigned for the tax since March. 
</P>
<P>
Around 1 a.m. Wednesday, about 60 weary supporters, including Mayor Allan L. 
Alexander, district administrators, union leaders and a dozen high school 
students, waited at the headquarters, a storefront office that was formerly 
used as a toddlers gymnasium. They had stopped nibbling at the giant "Hooray 
for Volunteers"-inscribed cake and were instead staring blankly at the incoming 
results posted on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like expecting a baby," parent Faye Refnick said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Nebenzahl, co-chairman of the Yes on Schools Committee, told the crowd 
at 1:30 a.m. to go home, saying "it's conjecture as to where we'll be" since 
some absentee ballots remained uncounted. In an interview later, he said it is 
unfortunate that with the two-thirds margin needed, "a minority of viewpoint 
can abuse the will of a majority of a community." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the evening, the mood was festive, with people entering a $25 
betting pool and children huddling on the floor doing their homework. Some 
students had risen at 6 a.m., going out before school to hang personalized 
notices on supporters' doors reminding them to vote. Throughout the day, 
volunteers checked the polls, visited and phoned supporters who had not yet 
voted, and offered baby-sitting and rides to polling sites. Some had taken the 
day off from work to devote themselves to the last-minute campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
"If it should really not pass, I don't think there's anything more we could've 
done," said third-grade teacher Irene Easton, who had come in after school to 
call supporters. 
</P>
<P>
The tax would be levied on each of the commercial and residential parcels of 
land in the city for the next five years. Parcels would be assessed between 
$250 and $750 annually, depending on their size and use. 
</P>
<P>
Passage would mean that teachers will get a 3% pay raise for the coming school 
year that was negotiated during the teachers strike last fall but was made 
contingent on the parcel tax's success. Passage would also mean that 48 
teachers, nurses, counselors and librarians, and dozens of teaching assistants 
who have been issued layoff notices will be welcomed back. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Taylor, a high school history teacher and sports coach who faces layoff, 
said he has been offered a job in another school district but would like to 
stay in Beverly Hills. "The kids are great," he said. Frustrating, however, is 
the fact that since he and most of the other teachers cannot afford to live in 
Beverly Hills, "(we) can't even vote in the (the election)." 
</P>
<P>
But "I've got to be optimistic," he said late Tuesday. "My wife and daughter 
are at home, waiting to see what daddy will be doing tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Anti-tax leader Sherman Kulick said Wednesday that he had expected the tax to 
definitively lose, and blamed the close race on a relatively low turnout of 
Republicans. "A lot of conservative (voters), which I imagine are on our side, 
didn't go to the polls because there was no excitement in one party. So the 
Democratic Party, which historically is very liberal . . . got (its) turnout," 
he said. About 45% of Beverly Hills' registered voters turned out to vote on 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the Yes on Schools Committee vastly outspent his group, the 
Beverly Hills Citizens for Cost-Effective Quality Education. The Yes Committee 
will spend about $157,000 total, according to campaign consultant Kim Karie, 
which amounts to about $27 for each yes vote thus far. The all-out campaign 
included marches, lawn signs, glossy leaflets and mailers sent to tenants, 
alumni and other specific categories of people. 
</P>
<P>
Kulick said his organization spent about $500, or about 17 cents per no vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just hoping money doesn't buy this election," he said. "It's disgraceful, 
the amount of money they spent on this campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Tax opponents ran a low-key campaign, with not even an election-night 
gathering. Photocopies of hand-lettered flyers broadcast their platform of tax 
revolt and back-to-basics in education. Kulick argued that the district simply 
has too many frill courses and spends beyond its means. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents also pointed out that Beverly Hills spends $6,000 per pupil annually, 
more than any other district in Los Angeles County. School districts in other 
affluent communities such as San Marino and La Canada Flintridge spend less per 
student, yet their students score as well or better than Beverly Hills students 
on standardized tests, they noted. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the tax, however, argued that Beverly Hills has smaller classes 
and more Advanced Placement courses and specialist teachers than other 
districts. The variety and depth of the offerings is what draws many parents to 
the city, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Their hefty campaign chest, they said, was needed to get their message out and 
to battle the odds against them. Statewide, school parcel tax elections have 
had only a 37% success rate. Beverly Hills has a large contingent of residents 
with no school-age children, while many of the parents -- who would likely 
favor the tax -- are recent immigrants and ineligible to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills' last parcel tax attempt, in 1987, failed. The proposal for a 
flat-rate tax of $270 per parcel was approved by 59% of the voters, short of 
the two-thirds needed. 
</P>
<P>
"If the city of Beverly Hills won't pay $300 or $750 for education, it's 
setting a horrible precedent for the state of California," sophomore Gina 
Balian said early Wednesday at the Yes on Schools office. "If Beverly Hills 
can't do it, there's something wrong with our society." 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be real disappointed in a community that values cars and clothes, and not 
their children and education," parent Maxine Barens said. Rona Leuin, a parent 
and 1967 graduate of Beverly Hills High School, tried to cheer up another 
parent. "It ain't over till it's over," she said. "We remember Truman and 
Dewey, even though we weren't alive then."

CITY FILES 17 MISDEMEANOR CHARGES AGAINST LANDLORDS; 
</P>
<P>
APARTMENTS: INSPECTORS FOUND RATS AND COCKROACHES, BROKEN WINDOWS, GAPING HOLES 
IN CEILINGS AND WALLS AND, IN SOME UNITS, NO HOT AND COLD WATER. THE OWNERS 
BLAME THE TENANTS.

<P>
Glendale city prosecutors have filed criminal charges against the landlords of 
a downtown apartment building, calling the conditions in the building 
deplorable. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Famiglietti of Reseda and Allen Lazarus of Los Angeles, owners of the 
14-unit building at 130 N. Jackson St., face 17 misdemeanor charges, including 
failure to provide hot and cold running water and heat, repair broken windows, 
walls and plumbing, and failure to prevent rat and cockroach infestation. The 
owners say the tenants are responsible for many of the building's problems. 
</P>
<P>
The pair will be arraigned next Thursday in Glendale Municipal Court. If 
convicted, each could face six months in jail and a $500 fine on each count. 
</P>
<P>
"I would characterize it as a serious situation, with these tenants clearly 
living in places few people would want to live," said Assistant City Atty. Ron 
Braden. 
</P>
<P>
The city's action is not rare -- about 30 cases involving criminal charges 
against landlords have been filed in Glendale in the past decade. But few of 
the cases have been so severe, said City Atty. Scott Howard. 
</P>
<P>
"This ranks up there as being one of the worst," Howard said. "These are the 
conditions that you would classify as being fairly deplorable." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the apartments have gaping holes in the ceiling and walls, through 
which rats and cockroaches can climb, Braden said. Others have cracked and 
peeling paint, soiled and torn carpets and broken faucets. Although hot and 
cold water has been restored at the building since the charges were filed, many 
of the other conditions remain, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The city informally complained about the building in May, 1989, when inspectors 
found minor violations such as torn carpets, Braden said. But, spurred by 
tenants' complaints, officials inspected the apartments last month and filed 
eight of the formal charges. A second inspection last Friday brought an 
additional nine charges, Braden said. 
</P>
<P>
The owners and tenants blame each other for the condition of the building, a 
two-story, red-brick complex built in 1926 that sits near Glendale school 
district headquarters on Wilson Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Famiglietti, a Reseda real estate agent, said he and Lazarus, who have owned 
the building since 1987, have spent thousands of dollars in repairs to the 
building, including the purchase of a new roof. He blamed a damaged stairwell 
and broken windows in the building's back doors on recent acts of vandalism. 
But he attributed other problems to some of his tenants, who he said abused the 
property and were not paying rent. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Famiglietti said, tenants of two second-floor apartments are day 
laborers who congregate with others down the block from the building, at the 
corner of Jackson and Broadway streets, to wait for work. They often permit 
other day laborers to shower or live in their units, crowding five to eight men 
in a single apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"The building is not a slum landlord building," said Famiglietti, who owns 
about six other apartment buildings in the San Fernando Valley. "It's a 
60-year-old building that needs work. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want anybody to live in squalid conditions. But there have been 
problems with some of the tenants," he continued. "When you've got six guys 
living in a single, it takes a matter of months before the building 
deteriorates. What we have to do is get rid of the bad tenants and then we can 
fix up the building." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County criminal court records showed no other similar cases against 
Famiglietti or Lazarus. Lazarus could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants at the building Friday had mixed sentiments about its condition. While 
a carpenter and two assistants were busy repairing and painting several 
first-floor vacant units, one elderly tenant sitting in front of the complex 
said he rarely has had problems with his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"My apartment's always been livable," said Willard Grimes, 79, who has lived in 
the building for 14 years. "I guess I was lucky and got the best apartment." 
</P>
<P>
But other tenants said some of the apartments have been in disrepair for 
months, despite complaints to the landlords. They acknowledged that work was 
being done on vacant units, but said the greatest need for repairs was in 
apartments already occupied. 
</P>
<P>
Disgruntled tenants also confirmed that day laborers often visit and stay in 
two apartments, but said neither the workers nor the tenants who are day 
laborers have damaged the units. City Atty. Howard agreed, saying the 
conditions that brought criminal charges go beyond neglect by tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an overnight problem," said Maria Duenas, 35, who lives with her 
son in the building's only two-bedroom apartment. Duenas is one of several 
tenants the landlords say has not paid rent. 
</P>
<P>
"This is years of negligence of not fixing the place," she said. "This is not a 
case of all the apartments having nine people in them." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a 46-year-old woman who recently moved her elderly mother out of the 
building because of its deteriorated state, stopped by to collect belongings. 
As she walked through the first-floor apartment her mother had rented for 11 
years, she shook her head and pointed at cockroaches on the floor, paint 
peeling from the walls and a gaping hole in the bathroom ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother paid $450 a month for this misery," said the woman, who asked not to 
be identified. 
</P>
<P>
In his second-floor apartment, Aristeo Cruz, a 23-year-old day laborer, pointed 
out torn window screens, holes in the walls and carpet and a kitchen sink 
filled with black water. The kitchen plumbing had not worked for months, Cruz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The owners just don't want to put any money into this building," Duenas said. 
"Hopefully, the city will get the problems taken care of."

Spurning the city's Establishment with one arm and holding onto it with the 
other, voters this week elected underdog Doug Drummond to the City Council in a 
stunning political upset while giving Mayor Ernie Kell and Councilman Evan 
Anderson Braude another four years in office. 
</P>
<P>
Drummond, 53, a retired Long Beach police commander and political neophyte, 
claimed 51% of the vote in the Belmont Shore-area district, snatching victory 
from Jim Serles, a prominent dentist and city Planning Commission chairman, who 
finished with 49%. 
</P>
<P>
So close was the mayoral match that Kell made a concession speech and said 
goodby to a sad band of supporters at Nino's Italian Restaurant before he 
picked up a last-minute lead early Wednesday morning over Councilman Tom Clark. 
It was only when a reporter ran after Kell in the parking lot with the news of 
his sudden gain that the mayor jubilantly returned to Nino's, one of his 
favorite haunts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're winning the . . . thing," Kell shouted incredulously as he jabbed the 
air with a clenched fist and a kick of his foot. "Bring out the cake." 
</P>
<P>
Soon bottles of chilled champagne and a victory cake inscribed "Bye Bye Tom" 
were fetched from their hiding places and about 15 Kell followers were toasting 
"four more years." 
</P>
<P>
For most of election night, it had looked as if it would be bye-bye Ernie. 
Except for some early absentee returns, Kell trailed until the very end, when 
he just scraped by Clark with 50.5% of the vote, to Clark's 49.4% Fewer than 
700 votes saved Kell from defeat at the end of his first term as the city's 
first full-time mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"We were feeling good about it until the final votes came in," said a 
disappointed Clark, who for the last nine months has spent his weekends 
tramping through neighborhoods in search of support, knocking on the doors of 
15,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, Clark had said he felt he had a good chance of capturing 
the mayor's seat because of his 24-year tenure on the council, his involvement 
in community groups and his aggressive walking campaign. But in the end he was 
hampered by a much smaller campaign budget than Kell, who had more than twice 
as much to spend. 
</P>
<P>
Braude, 42, had the only easy ride of the election. The lawyer won a second 
term in the downtown seat with 57% of the vote, fending off retired deputy 
police chief Bill Stovall, who garnered 43%. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to tell you, I'm really delighted," Braude said as a raucous crowd 
celebrated his impending victory at his downtown campaign headquarters late 
Tuesday night. "This time we spent less money than we did four years ago." The 
Braude-Stovall race was courtly in contrast with the Serles-Drummond slugfest. 
Rife with personal attacks, allegations of corruption and sign stealing, it 
ended Tuesday in a neck-and-neck contest, with Serles and Drummond trading 
razor-thin leads throughout the night for control of the wealthy district that 
includes Belmont Shore, Naples and the Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
"A vote for me is a vote against clubmanship," Drummond said at a local German 
restaurant, where he sipped a beer and entertained thoughts of victory. "I 
don't belong to a (political) gang. I am truly independent. I am truly working 
for the 3rd District." 
</P>
<P>
Serles failed to show up at his scheduled election night party, leaving a 
roomful of waiting supporters without even a concession speech. Several 
attempts to reach him at home were unsuccessful, and a telephone operator said 
his receiver was off the hook Tuesday night. He could not be reached Wednesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
It was doubtlessly an embarrassing defeat for Serles, who had tried twice 
before to beat incumbent Jan Hall. 
</P>
<P>
When Hall announced that she would not run again, it looked as if Serles would 
cruise to victory with name identification as chairman of the Planning 
Commission, the fattest bankroll of any council candidate and the backing of 
teachers, firefighters and even the local police union that Drummond once led. 
</P>
<P>
But other council members, in a post-election analysis, said Serles' high 
profile may have hurt him in a district where voters had already rejected him 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the day for the outsiders," Councilman Wallace Edgerton said. "Serles 
was seen as an incumbent. He was seen as Establishment, and people are upset 
about crime and graffiti. They are angry and frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
The campaign took a sour turn early on, when Drummond accused Serles of 
accepting illegal campaign contributions from developers. Although no formal 
charges were ever filed, Serles' campaign never seemed to recover. 
</P>
<P>
Then the race got nasty. Serles hit Drummond with a $6-million libel suit and 
said his doctorate in criminology came from a "diploma mill." Drummond said 
Serles is corrupt and accused him of trying to "buy the election" by 
outspending the Drummond campaign as much as 4 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks after the April primary, Serles unleashed a blizzard of slick 
campaign flyers, and Drummond said he lost six pounds walking precincts. Both 
were on the phones and papering the district with get-out-the-vote messages 
until the bitter end. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all exhausted," Serles said as the polls closed. "We've certainly given 
it our all." 
</P>
<P>
"Hard work wins, and winning is humble because folks do it, not me," Drummond 
said of his victory, promising to make a stronger police department, 
low-density neighborhoods and better schools his priorities when he takes 
office. 
</P>
<P>
As the numbers mounted in Clark's favor, Kell's camp attributed Clark's strong 
showing to a general mood of dissatisfaction with incumbents. "What we are 
seeing is an anti-incumbent factor that we have seen throughout the country," 
said Jeff Adler, Kell's political consultant, who rejected any suggestion that 
Kell's campaign attacks on Clark's integrity may have disenchanted voters. 
</P>
<P>
"It was our job to educate the public about Tom Clark's record. Win or lose, I 
don't have a problem with the campaign we ran," Adler said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the high turnout in the 3rd District had hurt Kell, who has 
traditionally been a political antagonist of that district's representative, 
Councilwoman Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Still, that was countered by the equally high turnout in the 5th District, 
Kell's old City Council area and a strong base of support. 
</P>
<P>
About 39% of the city's 173,714 voters cast ballots in the Tuesday election. 
</P>
<P>
After the April primary somewhat unexpectedly thrust Kell into a runoff with 
Clark, the mayor put his reelection efforts into high gear, spending freely on 
mailers and firing broadsides at the 63-year-old optometrist, the council's 
most senior member. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of mailers Kell, 61, a retired developer, boasted of his stands on 
crime and education while accusing Clark of repeated ethical lapses during his 
long council career. Clark, who represents the 4th District, retorted that Kell 
was mounting a personal vendetta against him, dredging up one-sided versions of 
long-forgotten incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Although Clark is as firmly established in local political circles as Kell and 
shares many of the mayor's positions, Clark apparently came close to persuading 
a majority of voters that he wasn't the same. He assailed Kell as a do-nothing 
mayor with a flotilla of generous special-interest buddies and promised more 
leadership on pressing issues. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Edgerton, a Kell supporter, said: "Tom Clark was very clever to 
appear as an outsider when in fact he was the incumbent voting on the issues. I 
got to hand to it to him, it was a sleight of hand." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor has no vote on the council, only a veto. 
</P>
<P>
Convinced that he was going to lose, Kell tried to console a tired collection 
of supporters sitting among red, white and blue balloons as the results 
dribbled in after midnight: "I gotta tell you, it doesn't look good. But life 
doesn't start in politics, and it doesn't end in politics." 
</P>
<P>
In subdued tones, Kell conceded to reporters that he had perhaps failed local 
voters in some ways, "even though I tried not to." 
</P>
<P>
An hour later, the white-haired former councilman was gleefully retracting his 
concession. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm stunned," Kell said. "If the voters want me to serve four more years, I'll 
be glad to do it. I can't believe it. It reminds me of Dewey. It's like waking 
up after a dream." 
</P>
<P>
With the backing of the local police union in the 1st District council race, 
Stovall seized on crime as the major issue of his campaign. That, Braude said, 
was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not dealing with one issue. We've got a lot of issues to cover," Braude 
emphasized as it became apparent that he had won. 
</P>
<P>
Stovall, saying he may consider another run, said: "I'm proud that I moved from 
ground zero to that of a serious challenger in a very few months in a race 
where I was fighting City Hall."

LANDSCAPING CONTRACT VOTED FOR FIRM TIED TO COUNCILMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has approved a $409,000-a-year landscaping contract with a 
firm owned by a friend and political supporter of Councilman Mike Mendez. 
</P>
<P>
The council also voted 4 to 1 Tuesday to increase its overall spending on 
landscaping from $291,000 a year to $713,800. 
</P>
<P>
Mendez said the city needs to spend more money on landscaping to instill pride 
in the community. Council members have long complained of barren road medians 
and shabby parks. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to set the example for our residents to follow," Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilwoman Grace F. Napolitano blasted the decision, saying the money 
could be used for increased police protection and child care. 
</P>
<P>
"I would rather increase the level of services to people rather than to 
plants," Napolitano said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents offered varied opinions Tuesday night on whether the city should 
increase its landscaping budget. 
</P>
<P>
But scores of constituents have complained about the council's previous 
decision to negotiate the five-year contract with Murray's Landscape Inc. of 
Santa Fe Springs without seeking bids from competing firms. 
</P>
<P>
Murray's owner, Tom Murray, is a friend of Mendez and donated $1,000 in 
services to the councilman's 1988 campaign, according to campaign disclosures. 
Mendez said he also hired Murray's to do landscaping at his home and paid the 
firm $3,500. Murray also donated $200 to Councilman Robert E. White's 1988 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Napolitano criticized her colleagues for not seeking bids. 
</P>
<P>
"We have gone out to bid on many a contract," Napolitano said. "We have saved 
the city money by doing so." 
</P>
<P>
Mendez has said that more spending on landscape maintenance had been his idea 
and that he pressed to have the contract awarded to Murray's. But he said his 
actions were influenced by the quality of Murray's work, rather than friendship 
or political debt. White also denied that the campaign donation affected his 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
"Norwalk deserves nothing but the best," Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
The quality of Murray's work is not being disputed by Napolitano or by city 
staff. But there was no staff recommendation on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Richard R. Powers declined to criticize the council's decision 
directly, but he said his staff would have handled the matter differently if 
the effort had not been headed by a councilman. 
</P>
<P>
Powers said he would have preferred that the council wait until budget 
deliberations begin later this month before making a major spending decision. 
</P>
<P>
The city manager estimated that the city will have about $1.2 million in 
additional revenue next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have gone through the budget process with it," Powers said. "We 
probably would have gone through at least a competitive analysis" of the 
contract costs, he added. 
</P>
<P>
State law does not require cities to seek bids on such service contracts. Nor 
does state law bar a councilman from voting on a contract involving a campaign 
contributor. 
</P>
<P>
The city has been contracting with Landscape West Inc. of Los Angeles to 
maintain landscaping on road medians and in municipal parks and with Terrain 
Inc. of Glendale for mowing. The city pays those firms about $213,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, city workers perform some maintenance at an annual cost of 
$78,000, according to a report by Daniel E. Keen, director of urban planning. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the council approved spending $304,800 a year for landscaping 
services performed by city workers and $409,000 a year for Murray's services. 
</P>
<P>
The new landscaping services will include more extensive seeding and 
fertilizing, among other things. Grass clippings would be picked up at parks 
and facilities, rather than just at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The contacts with Landscape West and Terrain will be terminated within 45 days, 
Keen said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Landscape West owner Barry L. Konier renewed his offer to the City 
Council to perform the services in the Murray's contract for about $90,000 a 
year less. He urged the council to shop for the best price. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman White said he was willing to pay for good service. "I'm glad to 
get Murray back in," White said. "I know the cost is high."

STUDENT DRIVE SERVES AS FOOD FOR THOUGHT ON RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When students walk through a school cafeteria line to pick up their sloppy 
Joes, potato rounds and cartons of milk, the food is plopped onto plastic foam 
trays. Every school day, more than 50,000 of these trays are used -- and thrown 
into the trash. 
</P>
<P>
Students at several schools are mounting a drive to persuade officials to stop 
using trays made of plastic foam, which consists of chemicals that contribute 
to global warming. Some have written letters to the school district. A few have 
talked to their principals. And others have circulated petitions. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to help our earth," explained Tiffany Edmiston, a seventh-grader 
at Will Rogers Junior High School, where 286 students signed a petition to get 
rid of the plastic foam trays. 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston and other youngsters said they began considering recycling and other 
ecology measures during Earth Day, the recent worldwide celebration to 
encourage environmental reform. 
</P>
<P>
Students at Buffum Elementary School also are circulating a petition, and 
students at Cubberley and Twain elementary schools have written letters to 
Frank Towers, head of the food services division for the Long Beach Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
Towers said he shares the students' concerns, but there are no easy answers. 
</P>
<P>
To recycle the plastic foam, Towers said he would need to hire three workers, 
buy three trucks and establish a central spot where the trays could be taken 
daily. Last summer, Towers experimented for one week with recycling trays in 
the city's seven year-round schools. The district collected $500, but it cost 
twice that much to recycle the trays, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an expensive proposition," Towers said. 
</P>
<P>
A switch to paper trays would triple the cost of trays from $350,000 to $1 
million annually, and would consume more trees, Towers said. 
</P>
<P>
Some students at Rogers told Principal Susan Marumoto they would be willing to 
wash dishes if the district turned to non-disposable plates. But that has its 
problems too, Towers said. 
</P>
<P>
The district stopped using its school dishwashers about five years ago and many 
are broken. In addition to the repair costs, washing dishes in the district's 
56 elementary schools would require at least 1.7 million more gallons of water 
annually, at a time when many people are trying to conserve water. 
</P>
<P>
"Using Styrofoam is the least expensive way for the district to go," Towers 
said. "In everything in life, we have alternatives, but they have a cost." 
</P>
<P>
Towers said he will consider the options, including whether to turn to a 
combination of uses, such as dishwashers in schools where the machines are in 
good working condition and plastic foam trays in others. 
</P>
<P>
Towers and a representative from the plastic foam industry visited Buffum 
School recently and explained the dilemma to student leaders, who were not 
persuaded by the arguments, Principal Bob Hedges said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our children listened to them and decided to go to the petition," Hedges said. 
"Their feeling is that there must be some way to do it. They say, 'We may not 
know how, but someone should.' " 
</P>
<P>
Plastic foam is inflated with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which make good 
coolants and good insulators. But numerous studies show that they do not break 
down until they are in the upper atmosphere, where chlorine molecules react 
with oxygen molecules and destroy the ozone that protects people from the sun's 
ultraviolet rays. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, UC San Diego officials agreed to ban plastic foam from their 
campus at the urging of three marine biology students. The city of Berkeley has 
an ordinance banning the use of all CFC-processed polystyrene by restaurants 
and by retail food vendors who serve takeout food. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Long Beach students concerned about plastic foam also have started 
recycling efforts. At Buffum, for example, some students are holding newspaper 
drives and recycling plastic and aluminum containers. Students at Rogers and 
other schools have begun similar programs. 
</P>
<P>
Emily Ensley, 13, one of the Rogers students heading the drive for a plastic 
foam ban, digs through the school's trash cans every Thursday in search of 
pizza boxes, which she crushes for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
The seventh-grader admits that most of her friends are not eager to join her in 
the effort, but she remains determined. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see everybody in our neighborhood start to recycle -- just do 
something," Ensley said. "It's not that hard. Take a few minutes to crush a few 
cans or recycle some newspapers. It doesn't take that much effort."

TOY STORE SURRENDERS LEASE FOR PRIME SPOT IN NEW MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of La Mirada has tentatively settled a toy company lawsuit that had 
been one of the hurdles delaying a proposed $130-million commercial and 
residential project on a 70-acre tract at La Mirada Boulevard and Rosecrans 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The company, Toys 'R' Us, will surrender its long-term lease in the old, 
partially demolished La Mirada Mall in exchange for a prime spot in a new 
commercial development on the same property, said Don White, director of 
economic development for the city's Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Legal fees in the case cost La Mirada about $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
The city is involved in another lease-settlement lawsuit with the El Torito 
restaurant chain. Because the restaurant was vacated in February, however, an 
anticipated court trial will not delay new construction.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY; 
</P>
<P>
REDEVELOPMENT BUDGET OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Culver City Redevelopment Agency on Monday unanimously approved a budget 
for 1990-91 that includes an almost 36% increase in revenues and a 12% decrease 
in expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
The revenues for 1990-91 are expected to increase from $83 million to almost 
$112.7 million, due mainly to proceeds from a bond sale last November, said 
Deputy Redevelopment Director Debbie Rich. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the $150 million raised from the bond sale went toward refinancing 
existing debt and expenses from the sale, but almost $37 million was included 
in the new budget, according to a staff report. 
</P>
<P>
Expenditures, meanwhile, dropped from $58.5 million last year to $51.4 million 
this year. Last year's expenses were higher mainly because of the $2-million 
temporary City Hall and the inclusion of $885,000 to rehabilitate the Willat 
Studio -- the "Witch's House," Rich said. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of the studio in Beverly Hills recently decided against donating the 
historic building to Culver City.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: NORWALK; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCIL VOTE FALLS SHORT FOR EXTENDING BUILDING FREEZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Norwalk City Council on Tuesday failed to extend a building moratorium in a 
downtown area where small apartment buildings are replacing aging single-family 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
The council unanimously approved the 45-day moratorium May 1, fearing water and 
sewer systems would eventually be overloaded and that streets would become 
congested with parked cars. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Luigi A. Vernola abstained because he owns property in the area. 
</P>
<P>
City planners initiated a study of the moratorium area, which covers 
residential neighborhoods north of Rosecrans Avenue along both sides of San 
Antonio Drive. There are about 950 housing units in the moratorium area, 
according to Gregg Yamachika, acting director of community development. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, numerous real estate agents and commercial property owners 
complained that the proposed 10 1/2-month extension would damage their 
investment opportunities. The proposed extension failed after Councilman Robert 
E. White decided there was not enough evidence of sewer, water and parking 
problems to warrant a moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most council votes, the extension required four-fifths approval from the 
council for passage. Tuesday's vote was 3 to 1 with Vernola abstaining. 
</P>
<P>
The development study of the moratorium area is expected to be completed in the 
next year, City Manager Richard R. Powers said.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Culver City Council and Redevelopment Agency on Monday approved about $2.4 
million to build a new recreation building and to redesign McManus Park. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 4,000-square-foot recreation building, the park will include 
a new basketball court, picnic area and children's play area, said City 
Engineer Jim Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Renovations to the park, on the eastern area of the city where National 
Boulevard crosses Ballona Creek, will probably begin by the end of this year 
and be completed in the summer of 1991, Davis said.

GROUP DONATES $100,000 FOR SALVATION ARMY SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $100,000 grant -- the largest ever given by the Glendale Community Foundation 
-- has been awarded to the Salvation Army toward purchase of the first shelter 
for homeless families in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old nonprofit group last week allocated the grant toward purchase 
of the Booth House, a private residence at 609 Chester St. that the Salvation 
Army plans to convert into a temporary shelter for displaced families. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale City Council last month allocated $200,000 in federal grant money 
for the Booth House. The Salvation Army will use the foundation grant in paying 
the balance of the $460,000 purchase price at the close of escrow June 26. The 
shelter is expected to open in September. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Miller, executive director of the community group, said the foundation 
typically awards grants of $500 to $10,000 to individual charities and 
organizations. He said the unusually large grant was made at the request of a 
member who asked that a portion of his own funds be allocated to the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the donor, who asked to remain anonymous, is a longtime trustee of 
the foundation and also a member of the Salvation Army's Advisory Board who 
supports efforts to assist the community's homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Foundation members can contribute to both unrestricted funds and "donor-advised 
funds" in which the donor recommends where his or her contributions should be 
spent. The final award is made by an executive board. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation last week also allocated $5,000 in unrestricted funds to assist 
in refurbishing the outdoor recreational area at the Salvation Army Day Care 
Center, $1,496 for desks and chairs for the new Glendale Family Services 
facility at 410 W. Arden St., $2,100 for a computer to replace typewriters at 
the Atwater Park Center and $2,500 for computer equipment for Goodwill 
Industries.

EX-PLANNER BRAZELTON DEFEATS PENTONEY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Planning Commissioner Bob Brazelton weathered criticism that he was just 
one of City Hall's good old boys to win a council seat against Steve Pentoney 
in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
Brazelton, who served nearly eight years as a planner, entered the race a clear 
favorite. But Pentoney's campaign appeared to pick up steam in the weeks before 
the election. He promoted himself as an independent candidate who owed no 
political favors. 
</P>
<P>
But Brazelton's reputation as a longtime civic leader, coupled with 
endorsements from lame-duck Councilman Randall R. Barb and other local 
politicians, gave him a 7% margin of victory, 2,264 votes to Pentoney's 1,962. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I won this election because of my greater involvement in the community 
over the past 30 years," Brazelton said. 
</P>
<P>
Pentoney said his inability to match Brazelton's fund raising was critical. As 
of May 19, Brazelton had raised $15,014 and Pentoney $6,450, according to 
campaign disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
"The campaign was (run by) a grass-roots group with a limited budget," Pentoney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Brazelton and Councilman Roy L. Paul, who ran unopposed for reelection, will be 
sworn in July 3. 
</P>
<P>
The race between Brazelton and Pentoney for the city's District 4 seat was set 
up when Barb, a two-term councilman, decided to retire for family and business 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
District 4 runs north of Firestone Boulevard and east of Downey Avenue. It 
includes some of Downey's most affluent residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
There were no heated issues in the campaign. Both men, for example, called for 
continued redevelopment in the city and for more police and other community 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Brazelton and Pentoney are lawyers with considerable business experience, and 
both are longtime Downey residents who raised families there. 
</P>
<P>
Brazelton, 60, was better known because he was a member of the Planning 
Commission from October, 1982, until last January. He also worked with the 
local YMCA and Camp Fire groups, among other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Pentoney, 51, has been involved in local school and youth activities, such as 
Girl Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
The relatively cordial campaign turned a bit nasty in the final days. Pentoney 
fired first, calling Brazelton an extension of Barb, who some critics say has 
favored well-connected constituents. Barb was criticized last year, for 
example, for strongly pushing the appointment of a friend, D. Clayton Mayes, as 
police chief. 
</P>
<P>
Brazelton, who was Barb's campaign treasurer, denied the allegation, saying 
that he would be an independent thinker if elected. 
</P>
<P>
Pentoney also pointed out that Brazelton had to abstain from Planning 
Commission decisions because his law firm has represented residents before the 
city and because he owns a 5% interest in a building in a city redevelopment 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
Pentoney said residents should elect a councilman who can vote all the time. He 
said that he has no business interests in the city and that the only property 
he owns in Downey is his home. 
</P>
<P>
Brazelton acknowledged that he has abstained from several Planning Commission 
decisions. But he said there should be no need to abstain as a councilman. He 
said that he has persuaded the partners in his law firm not to take clients 
dealing with the city and that he is selling his interest in the local 
building. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of his campaign stressing his independence, Pentoney won a key 
endorsement from the Downey Police Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Brazelton countered. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of about 6,000 households found a flyer from Brazelton on their doors 
Monday morning. Among other things, it said Pentoney is being investigated by 
the state Fair Political Practices Commission for "allegedly attempting to 
secret (hide) the names of financial backers" who paid for political mailers. 
</P>
<P>
Pentoney denied the allegation. An FPPC spokeswoman said a complaint had been 
lodged on May 11. 
</P>
<P>
"All my political mail was created in my den on my computer and was mailed by 
my committee." 
</P>
<P>
Brazelton's campaign manager, Joe Lumsdaine, savored the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't surprise me that the race was this close," Lumsdaine said. "They 
had a very formidable political machine. We thought they'd give us a good 
fight, and they did."

WOO PROVIDES $5,000 TO CRIME FIGHTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilman Michael Woo has provided $5,000 in city funds to be split among 
10 Hollywood and Silverlake crime-fighting groups. 
</P>
<P>
Each council member has a $10,000 discretionary fund each year to disburse as 
they choose, without requiring a vote of the council. 
</P>
<P>
Since Woo had half the money remaining with less than a month left in the 
fiscal year, which ends June 30, he decided to spend it on groups that have 
helped police cut crime in their neighborhoods, said Woo spokeswoman Julie 
Jaskol. She said the money will be used for such things as Crime Watch 
activities and anti-graffiti efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the following groups will receive United Streets of Hollywood, 
Hollywood Business Watch, Ivar Hawks, Beat Keepers, Holly Drivers, Hollywood 
Sentinels, Silver Lake Improvement Assn, Hollywood Heights Assn., Rampart 
Rangers and the Selma Light Brigade. 
</P>
<P>
"We give the money to groups that we know have a proven track record to use the 
money well," Jaskol said. United Streets of Hollywood, Hollywood Business 
Watch, Ivar Hawks, Beat Keepers, Holly Drivers, Hollywood Sentinels, Silver 
Lake Improvement Assn, Hollywood Heights Assn., Rampart Rangers and the Selma 
Light Brigade.

<P>
GOLF: ONCE THE BUTT OF JOKES, THE EAGLE ROCK HIGH GOLF PROGRAM IS ON THE VERGE 
OF BECOMING A DYNASTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the upcoming movie "Days of Thunder," Tom Cruise plays an aspiring stock car 
driver from Eagle Rock who heads for Dixie to become the next Richard Petty. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's Eagle Rock?" one perplexed Southerner asks. 
</P>
<P>
"Near Glendale," another answers, sounding almost as baffled. 
</P>
<P>
Audiences at home and in theaters across the nation have been laughing at Eagle 
Rock's expense every time the movie's trailer hits the screen. 
</P>
<P>
Don Johnson, who has coached golf at Eagle Rock High since 1975, has heard the 
snickering before. 
</P>
<P>
During Johnson's first four years as coach, the Eagles hacked, shanked and 
sliced their way through various municipal courses to become the laughingstock 
of City Section golf. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1975 and 1978, the Eagles did not win a league match. 
</P>
<P>
But through the past four years, it's the Eagles who have been getting the last 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
This season, they won their fourth consecutive league championship and placed 
fifth in the City finals behind Taft, Granada Hills, Birmingham and Monroe -- 
the highest finish by a non-Valley or non-beach-community school in City 
Section history. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Eagle Rock's top two players, Brad Nielsen and Leanne Wong, will 
compete in the state championships at the El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have country club kids," Johnson said. "So we have to do things in a 
different way to keep them (potential players) interested." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, at Eagle Rock, the smallest high school in the City Section, a low 
budget requires inventiveness. 
</P>
<P>
And Johnson, 59, has plenty. 
</P>
<P>
A math teacher who has worked at Belmont, Marshall, Glendale and Eagle Rock 
high schools and Valley College during his 31-year career, Johnson considers 
any space -- open or otherwise -- fair game to become a fairway. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Johnson's players occasionally practice their swings by teeing up 
plastic golf balls in the baseball batting cage and using it as a driving 
range. Other times they take out 3-irons and whack the pods that are dropped 
from liquid amber trees. 
</P>
<P>
"They go just like golf balls," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's unorthodox methods have translated well for the Eagles, who play 
their home matches at the Brookside Golf Course in Pasadena and at Griffith 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Eagle Rock has won 20 consecutive 4-A Division matches but the Eagles will move 
up to 5-A next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're going to gave a good chance to continue winning, the way people 
on our team are progressing," said Nielsen, a junior who won the Los Angeles 
Junior championship in April. "As the years pass, we're going to be well 
known." 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles were considered Team Mulligan until 1987, when they shared the 2-A 
championship with The Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Eagle Rock moved up and won the 3-A title. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Eagle Rock claimed the 4-A title, going 10-0 against Palisades, 
Kennedy, Marshall and LACES. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their success, however, the Eagles were still somewhat unknown. 
</P>
<P>
That all changed at last year's City finals when Eagle Rock and Taft, a 
perennial power, finished the first round tied for the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden everyone is scratching their head and asking, 'Where did these 
guys come from?,' " Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Eagle Rock once again went unbeaten in its division. 
</P>
<P>
One of the key reasons was the play of Nielsen, who finished third in the City. 
</P>
<P>
Another was the consistent performance of Wong, a sophomore whose brother, 
Gerald, played golf for Eagle Rock last year and competed for San Jose State 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
And Neilsen predicts that Eagle Rock could be a contender again next season. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles lose only two players, Mike Messner and Clint Osorio, from their top 
seven. Steve Paredes will be back for his senior year and Omar Rice and Matt 
Bell will be juniors. 
</P>
<P>
Which means the future looks bright beyond 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagle Rock campus is unique in that it is also home to seventh-, eighth- 
and ninth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson believes the success of this year's team will trickle down and help 
breed a new generation of talented players. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't play on the team yet, but I can contact them and try to keep their 
interest," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll continue to be successful because we have people wanting to come 
out and try it."

TWO PEPPERDINE PLAYERS SELECTED IN BASEBALL DRAFT; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASEBALL: MONTREAL PICKS SHORTSTOP MARTIN AND THE NEW YORK YANKEES SELECT 
RIGHT FIELDER LEACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The telephones didn't stop ringing at the homes of Pepperdine University 
baseball players Chris Martin and Jalal Leach. 
</P>
<P>
Martin was flooded with congratulatory calls after being selected in the second 
round of the amateur draft this week by the Montreal Expos. Leach, however, 
mostly fielded calls of condolence after being selected by the New York Yankees 
in the seventh round. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, a senior shortstop, and Leach, a junior right fielder, were projected 
as third-round draftees by Baseball America. 
</P>
<P>
"Going in the seventh round is definitely lower than I expected," said Leach, 
who played at San Marin High in Novato, Calif. "I expected to go in the first 
four rounds, but for some reason I slipped down to the seventh. I can't explain 
it, but it's very disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
Yankee scout Bill Schmidt called Leach to tell him about the good news, but 
Leach said he was expecting to be called earlier in the morning by either the 
Expos or Seattle Mariners. The Expos and Mariners had shown the most interest 
in Leach the last month of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Being drafted in the seventh round might mean Leach, 21, will return to 
Pepperdine for his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless the Yankees offer me the signing bonus I feel that I'm worth, I'll be 
back at school," he said. "I was all ready to sign and start my professional 
baseball career. But since I didn't go in an upper round, I now have to 
reconsider things." 
</P>
<P>
Leach wouldn't disclose how much money the Yankees would need to offer him. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, a graduate of Hamilton High, was selected in the 25th round of last 
year's draft by the Yankees. Unhappy, Martin decided to finish his college 
eligibility in hopes of improving his stock with the scouts. 
</P>
<P>
Although college juniors normally have more signing leverage than seniors, the 
gamble paid off for Martin. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy with the way the draft turned out," Martin said. "When 
Montreal called me with the news, I had just awakened. It was a nice wake-up 
call." 
</P>
<P>
Martin, 22, said he didn't have any expectations on the amount of money he'll 
receive for signing, but as a second-round choice he knows it will be a 
substantial amount. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, bonuses for the 23 first-round selections signed by major league 
teams averaged $183,000. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said he expects to sign within the next week and report to rookie league 
camp later this month. 
</P>
<P>
The draft caps a rocky month for the two Pepperdine players. The Waves failed 
to win the West Coast Conference title for the first time in seven years. Their 
record of 37-23 wasn't good enough to earn them a bid in the NCAA tournament 
for the first time since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, a walk-on who ended up being a three-year starter, was voted to the 
first-team in the WCC and was a second-team all-American in Baseball America. 
He batted .358 and had 65 runs batted in and 14 home runs. Scouts are impressed 
with his speed and defensive skills. He is 6-foot and 170 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Leach, second-team all-WCC and a two-year starter, led Pepperdine in hitting 
with a .363 average. He had 37 RBI's and five home runs. At 6-1 and 200 pounds, 
scouts like his size and batting power. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been able to figure out the draft," Pepperdine Coach Andy Lopez 
said. "The most curious things always happen. I did expect Jalal to go higher, 
but maybe now we'll get him back for another season. That would be fine with 
me." 
</P>
<P>
The draft ended Wednesday, but Major League Baseball only releases first-round 
selections. Pepperdine seniors Mike Truscke (catcher) and Britt Craven 
(pitcher) had potential to be drafted in the lower rounds.

150-YEAR-OLD ADOBES GIVEN PROTECTED STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The decaying remains of two 150-year-old adobe structures in Baldwin Hills were 
recently granted historic-monument status by the Los Angeles City Council, 
saving them from demolition threatened by plans for condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
The council's recent decision will allow Consolidated Realty Board of Southern 
California, owner of the structures, to move forward with plans to build a 
52-unit condominium project but requires that the original adobes remain 
undisturbed. 
</P>

"It is about time that communities like Baldwin Hills had their historic 
monuments recognized just like other communities, like Hollywood," said 
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, whose district includes Baldwin Hills. "There is 
history in every community, and these are some of the oldest buildings in the 
county." 
</P>
<P>
The adobes, with thick walls and high, redwood beam ceilings, were once the 
center of the 4,000-acre Rancho La Cienega o Paso de la Tijera owned by Vicente 
Sanchez, alcalde -- or mayor -- of Los Angeles in 1830. In the 1920s, an 
addition was built linking the structures and the building was converted into a 
larger clubhouse by the Sunset Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
Consolidated bought the building in 1972 and maintains its headquarters there. 
About two years ago, Consolidated came up with the condominium plans that 
called for the demolition of the 11,000-square-foot building that houses the 
firm's offices, a large auditorium, two other large halls for meetings and a 
fully equipped kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Those plans were placed in limbo when the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage 
Commission recommended that the entire building be given historic-monument 
status. The City Council's arts, health and humanities committee proposed a 
compromise that would make only the original adobe structures historic, and the 
council agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Consolidated accepted the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out OK," said Reginald Ballard, a Consolidated spokesman. "We plan 
to build a condominium on the property and incorporate the historical 
significance of the site into the design and planning." 
</P>
<P>
Consolidated plans to build its condominium around the two adobes on the 
1.3-acre parcel, an area known for its Indian artifacts dating to prehistoric 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"Its location on a hill provides a great vantage point to view the rest of the 
basin," said Alma Carlisle, a specialist with the city's bureau of engineering. 
The first written evidence of a structure on the site appears in maps of Rancho 
La Cienega o Paso de la Tijera dating from the early 1850s, she said. 
</P>
<P>
La Cienega means "the marsh" and La Tijera refers to the narrow scissor-shaped 
valleys between the hills. 
</P>
<P>
According to the late Virginia French, who wrote a book on the old adobes, Gov. 
Manuel Micheltorena granted the property to Vicente Sanchez in 1843 for his 
"valiant soldiering and good citizenry." At the time, the rancho extended from 
what is now Exposition Boulevard to Slauson Avenue and from La Cienega 
Boulevard east to about 4th Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
When Vicente died, the property was taken over by the Sanchez heirs. The 
Sanchez descendants remained prominent in the early history of Los Angeles. 
Vicente Sanchez's son, Tomas, was elected sheriff of Los Angeles County seven 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the ownership of the Sanchez ranch was turned over to E. J. (Lucky) 
Baldwin, after whom Baldwin Hills was named. Baldwin divided much of the 
acreage and sold most of it for development. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement to preserve the structures, Galanter promised to 
assist the owners in obtaining the permits needed to complete their project. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard said his group's project will not only provide jobs but result in 
housing that the community will be proud of. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to build something that our children and their children can be proud 
of," he said, "Those buildings may be 150 years old, but 150 years from now we 
want someone to look up at this hill and see what my heritage has done."

VENICE DISTANCE RUNNER JORDAN MISSES STATE MEET BECAUSE OF INJURY; 
</P>
<P>
PREP TRACK: SENIOR COULD HAVE A STRESS FRACTURE IN HIS RIGHT SHIN. HE WILL BE 
OUT OF ACTION FOR AT LEAST A MONTH. 
</P>

<P>
Last month, Venice High distance runner Danny Jordan appeared on the verge of a 
state championship. This week, he is pondering his immediate future in the 
sport while awaiting word on the extent of an injury in his right shin. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who entering the City Section final in mid-May had one of the fastest 
times in the nation in the 1,600-meter run, has been hobbled in recent weeks 
with a sore right shin that forced him to miss last weekend's state meet at 
Cerritos College. Initially, he thought it was tendinitis, but after X-rays 
last week his doctor believes Jordan might have a stress fracture. 
</P>
<P>
"If it ends up being a stress fracture, I won't be doing any running for at 
least a month," said Jordan, a senior who recently signed a letter of intent 
with Southern Methodist University. "I may even have to get a cast. It's 
terribly disappointing, but I've been running with pain for about the last 
month and it isn't fun. I just want to get the problem rectified." 
</P>
<P>
The extent of the injury will be revealed today when Jordan undergoes a bone 
scan. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, 18, became one of the nation's top milers after running the 1,600 in 4 
minutes, 10.8 seconds at the Arcadia Invitational in April. The time was the 
third best in the state and fifth best in the country. He finished second in 
the 1,500 at the prestigious Mt. San Antonio College Relays several weeks later 
with a 3:52.2. 
</P>
<P>
He was favored to defend his 1,600 title at the City meet, but that is when the 
leg started bothering him. He ran a 4:20.0 in the semifinals and lost to Brian 
Gastelum of Birmingham. Gastelum beat him again in the final, easily winning 
4:11.78 to 4:20.38. Jordan, in fact, barely held off teammate Ben Mesfen 
(4:20.86) for second place. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been getting in only one workout a week for the last month," Jordan said. 
"It just hurt too bad to run." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan didn't practice before the state meet. Although he had planned to 
participate, he scratched from Friday's preliminaries after his doctor advised 
him not to run. Mesfen, who qualified for state, finished sixth in the 1,600 
with a 4:14.7. His preliminary time of 4:13.04 bettered his personal best by 
seven seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the state meet and watched," Jordan said. "It was painful to watch 
the 1,600, but seeing Ben do so well eased the pain a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
The injury will force Jordan to miss the Golden West Invitational in Sacramento 
Saturday and next weekend's Keebler Invitational in Chicago. He also will have 
to skip the TAC Jr. Nationals later this month in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
While Jordan was nursing his injury at home Monday night, Santa Monica High's 
Felice Lipscomb was watching videotape of her victories at the state meet in 
the 100- and 300-meter low hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Lipscomb, a USC-bound senior, successfully defended her state title in the 100 
hurdles in a personal-best 13.58, and then unseated defending champion Twila 
Sims of Lompoc in the 300 with a national-best time of 41.69. Sims finished 
second with a 41.76. 
</P>
<P>
"I look pretty good on tape," said a laughing Lipscomb. "I'm still very excited 
and happy with the way the state meet turned out. It was my goal to get two 
state titles this season, and I'm elated that I was able to achieve that goal." 
</P>
<P>
Lipscomb was undefeated in the 100 hurdles and didn't expect to be challenged 
at state. Her main concern was the 300 hurdles, a race she didn't begin running 
until this season. She lost in the event three times, all to Sims. 
</P>
<P>
Sims' latest victory was two weeks ago at the Masters Meet, when she came from 
behind to edge Lipscomb, 42.29 to 42.30. 
</P>
<P>
Both won their heats in the state preliminaries, setting up the anticipated 
showdown. But this time Lipscomb was able to hold off a gaining Sims on the 
last hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in tears after the finish because I thought I had lost again," Lipscomb 
said. "But when the finish-line judge told me I had won I couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Lipscomb plans to run the 100 hurdles at Golden West and Keebler, but will skip 
the longer hurdle race since it is increased from 300 to 400 meters.

EARLY SPAWNING SAND BASS EASY PREY FOR ANGLERS

<P>
Migrating sand bass continue to invade the sandy beaches to spawn. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the migrating albacore that showed up in May and then disappeared, the 
sand bass -- although a month ahead of their normal schedule to spawn -- can be 
expected to remain for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
With the early run of sand bass, all local sportfishing landings are scheduling 
sundown trips, as the bass bite is excellent at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers are reminded that sand bass might be wearing tags from last year's 
tagging program. The tags should be turned in to the Department of Fish and 
Game with area caught and date for a $5 reward. 
</P>
<P>
Seven South Bay fishermen returned from the fishing trip of a lifetime in Costa 
Rica. 
</P>
<P>
The group, led by Curtis Brown of Torrance, was fishing at Tamarindo Beach near 
the Nicaraguan border. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the sailfishing was spectacular, with more than 50 fish caught and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Pruitt and Fred Holtz of Torrance caught seven sails with the largest 
estimated to weigh more than 150 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Carson angler Tony Jackson used 15-pound test line and battled one fish for 40 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Eldon Johnson of San Pedro was using light tackle, but lost several fish before 
switching to 20-pound test line. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Homan of Long Beach, who was on his first sailfish trip, caught several 
fish. Philip Friedman, the voice of 976-TUNA, said on the last day the group 
also caught rainbow runners, dorado, big-eye tuna, yellow-fin tuna and 
amberjack. 
</P>
<P>
Brown and Friedman said it was a wide-open bite for two hours and all the fish 
were caught on jigs as no bait was available. 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with National Fishing Week, Saturday is a free fishing day. 
</P>
<P>
The public can fish California waters without a fishing license. However, 
anglers are reminded all catch limits and size regulations apply. 
</P>
<P>
The second grunion season starts Saturday. They are expected to hit South Bay 
beaches to spawn between 10:45 p.m. and 12:40 a.m. for a four-day run. 
</P>
<P>
The run times and beaches change nightly. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: Joan Bartold of West Los Angeles, fishing aboard the Betty O 
out of Santa Monica Bay, caught the whopper of the week, a 35-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Janet and Bob Yamane, fishing off Catalina Island aboard the Mustang, caught 
33- and 31-pound yellowtails. The West Los Angeles couple hooked their fish at 
the same time, with Janet catching the larger fish. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Hon Ling of West Los Angeles, fishing on the Annie B barge, caught a 
32-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Arsencal of Hawthorne, fishing aboard the Sea Spray off Torrance Beach, 
won the jackpot with a 14-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports 
</P>
<P>
Local fishing is starting to improve as barracuda have moved into horseshoe 
kelp. Bonito fishing has slowed. At Catalina Island, bass and barracuda provide 
most of the action. White sea bass and yellowtail slowed the past several days. 
</P>
<P>
Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire fished Santa Monica Bay and anglers 
caught 220 sculpin and 50 sand bass.

President Hashemi Rafsanjani urged the United States to press Israel and Kuwait 
to release Muslim prisoners in exchange for help in gaining freedom for Western 
hostages in Lebanon. Iran and the pro-Iranian captors have often demanded that 
Israel free about 350 Muslim prisoners. But it was the first time in months 
that an Iranian leader referred to 15 Shiite Muslims jailed in Kuwait since 
1984 for fatal car bombings.

ANIMAL LOVER GATHERS THE WOUNDED AND THE WEAK

No living thing is too big, too small, too slimy, too ugly, or too smelly. If 
it flies, crawls, slithers, hops, swims, or walks on four legs and is in need 
of help, Bob Farner will be there. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Farner's Wildlife Rescue and Education Center, newly located on 3 acres in 
Valley Center, was established in 1980 primarily for the rehabilitation of 
injured and orphaned animals. Another, equally important goal of the 
organization is educating the public about wildlife preservation. 
</P>
<P>
"We've become so far removed from nature that we've come to fear it," Farner 
says. He wants people to realize that animals and birds will stand a much 
better chance of survival when people learn to adapt and share the environment 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people who love and understand wildlife get along in life very, very 
well," Farner said, espousing his theory that this kind of sensitivity and 
wisdom fosters a sense of fulfillment that enriches everyday lives. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to introduce people to wildlife and individual animals, Farner 
takes wild animals into classrooms, hospital rooms and town halls. 
</P>
<P>
A tour of his center's facility brings you face to face with a cougar named 
Sheba, a blind great blue heron known as Blue, and Flag, a mule deer, all 
permanent residents with no hope of returning to the wild. 
</P>
<P>
As a young cub, Sheba was declawed by an exotic-animal dealer in Texas who sold 
her to a customer as a pet. Kept illegally, she was removed from that home at 
the age of 7 months and placed with Farner, who has cared for her over the last 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Blue lost both eyes when the Carlsbad lagoon in which he lived grew polluted 
with toxins. Now he must be carefully hand-fed, a process he and Farner have 
perfected through trial and error. 
</P>
<P>
Flag was rescued from someone who raised him and kept him confined to a small 
apartment. This robbed him of his wild instincts and rendered him incapable of 
survival outside of a captive environment. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the animals are victims of Mother Nature herself. People bring in baby 
birds who have fallen from nests, orphaned animals whose mothers have either 
abandoned them or been killed, and many sick animals. Weather patterns, too, 
such as persistent drought, can wreak havoc on wild habitats. 
</P>
<P>
The hapless victims of human ignorance are the ones that bother Farner the 
most. 
</P>
<P>
"It preys on my mind, but I just have to forget it," he said. Incidents like 
these only serve to deepen his resolve to continue showing and telling. 
</P>
<P>
He cautions people to use judgment when they come across an animal in need of 
help. To avoid hurting either themselves or the animal, Farner or an 
experienced volunteer will come out to remove a sick or injured critter, or 
relocate a healthy one that may pose a threat, such as a rattlesnake. 
</P>
<P>
Farner has his finger on the pulse of the diverse San Diego County wildlife 
populations. Encroaching development has reduced the habitats of many animals, 
including the once plentiful deer whose reproduction is naturally regulated by 
the availability of habitat. 
</P>
<P>
Certain barometers have already indicated seriously declining populations. For 
instance, this year the center has taken in 15 barn owls. This is down from 37 
at this time last year and from the 100-plus the year before. No red-tailed or 
red-shouldered hawks have come in so far this year; they used to get as many as 
a dozen. 
</P>
<P>
A nonprofit organization, the wildlife center has no paid employees and relies 
entirely on private donations. Volunteers contribute their time, knowledge and 
whatever else is needed -- including food and medical care -- for the animals .

annual Deer Park Concours d'Elegance Auto Show this Sunday in Escondido has 
them, and more. 
</P>
<P>
A diverse collection of antique, classic, sports and contemporary cars will

More than 100 cars from all over Southern California are entered in this year's 
show. They will be displayed throughout the park and will be judged by a team 
of car aficionados. Criteria include physical condition and authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the auto exhibit, there will be a vintage clothing contest and 
chicken barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's auto show drew more than 3,000 people to the park. The guest of 
honor is David R. Holls, director of design at General Motors.

DAVID NELSON / ON RESTAURANTS: DINING DOESN'T MEET THE MOTIF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Somewhere at the new Coco Palms in Encinitas there may be a basket of garlic 
bread with my name on it, traveling from table to table and, possibly, back to 
the kitchen every so often for a quick rewarming. 
</P>
<P>
This basket of bread is something like the man in the Kingston Trio song who 
descended into the Boston subway, never to return. The lyrics supposed that he 
might still be riding around down there, and the same may be true of the garlic 
bread, ordered at the beginning of a recent Sunday dinner that stretched out 
and out in length until it seemed that none of the dishes ever would arrive. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem was the succession of servers who briefly took the table 
and then dropped out of sight, to be replaced, sometimes much later, by another 
equally cheerful young person who promised the imminent arrival of the bread 
and, indeed, of the meal itself. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner finally made its way to the table, but, alas, in a bread-less state. 
</P>
<P>
The wait provided a more than ample opportunity to get the feel of the place, 
which makes an effort of sorts to recreate the Southern California of the 
1940s. A pleasant, palm-motif paper covers the walls and suggests the ocean 
breezes that blow outside the picture windows, some of which offer excellent 
views of the coast just north of old Leucadia. Coco Palms also romanticizes the 
Forties with a wall-length, iridescent mural of a moonlit beach. However, the 
familiar manners of the staff and the general rush of the place locate it very 
much in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the emphasis on the 1940s, a decade associated with Hollywood and 
its stars, the menu names every dish as a particular personality's own. For 
example, there is John Wayne's Porterhouse steak, which sounds likely enough, 
but also Sophia Loren's "blackened" chicken fettuccine, a dish that one must 
doubt the great actress would endorse. 
</P>
<P>
The menu in general is a hodgepodge of dishes and the lack of focus suggests 
that the menu writer said to himself, "Well, Cajun stuff is kinda popular these 
days, and I guess we better have some Mexican food and some pasta, fish, salads 
and steaks." Needless to say, the appetizer list includes stuffed potato skins, 
fried zucchini and "Cajun" chicken drumettes. 
</P>
<P>
Steaks may be the kitchen's great strength. A coulotte top sirloin was notable 
not only for the care with which it had been grilled and for its tenderness, 
but for fine flavor, an attribute not generally applicable to beef these days. 
</P>
<P>
The crab-stuffed prawns also had the virtue of careful preparation, so that the 
large shrimp and their filling remained moist and tasty. However, the "lobster 
bisque sauce" that purportedly moistened these was a mysterious but utterly 
tasteless composition that may have been nothing more than flour cooked in 
butter. A saute of squashes in fiercely flavored tomato sauce accompanied both 
entrees and added quite the wrong note to each. 
</P>
<P>
Meals also include the choice of a typical green salad or clam chowder, the 
latter flavorful but, as is often the case in these parts, so thick that it 
seemed more a white sauce than a soup. The list of prepared-on-premises 
desserts is brief but does include a light, sprightly flavored strawberry 
mousse. 
</P>
<P>
At its calmer moments, the entree list includes prime rib, teriyaki steak or 
chicken, baby back ribs and Cobb salad. Further afield are the Jackson Square 
Caesar salad (attributed to Elizabeth Taylor and garnished with hearts of palm 
and "Cajun" croutons); the "chicken Vista Del Mar" of chicken, shrimp, 
scallops, salsa, cheese and sour cream (Betty Davis rather appropriately gets 
the credit for this one) and the chicken Popeye, which tops a broiled breast 
not only with creamed spinach flavored with nutmeg, ginger and curry, but with 
cheese, mushrooms and the house version of sauce bearnaise. What would Olive 
Oyl say?

NEVER THOUGHT DRUG CASH INVOLVED, SILBERMAN SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Businessman Richard T. Silberman, charged with laundering $300,000 that had 
been portrayed to him as Colombian drug profits, admitted Wednesday that he 
went through with the two deals at the heart of the case, but said he never 
intended to commit a crime. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying in his own defense, Silberman, who once was a top aide to former 
Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., said he thought the first deal, a swap of $100,000 
for stock in his gold mining company, was a legitimate business transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Tearily discussing the second deal, an exchange of $200,000 for U.S. Treasury 
bonds, Silberman said he was coerced into completing it by a government 
informer who threatened his family and left him "scared to death." 
</P>
<P>
Silberman said he never understood that the cash was purported drug money and 
maintained, despite testimony by FBI agents that he confessed upon arrest in 
April, 1989, in a San Diego hotel room, that he did no such thing. 
</P>
<P>
Although Silberman occasionally fought back tears, he was more often composed 
and assertive while discussing his version of events. He said he "obviously 
made a mistake and did something stupid to get involved with this." 
</P>
<P>
But, later, during a savage cross-examination, Silberman was so subdued that 
U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving had to ask him to speak up. Federal 
prosecutors pointed out that Silberman had been aware of references to drugs 
and suggested he had lied while doing the deals and was being untruthful -- or 
his memory was fading -- in court. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 61, is standing trial on seven counts stemming from allegations that 
he laundered $300,000 that the undercover FBI agent -- Peter Ahearn, who posed 
as Pete Carmassi, a front man for Colombian drug traffickers -- characterized 
as narcotics profits. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Silberman faces up to 75 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
After prosecutors spent two weeks playing dozens of secretly recorded tapes 
laying out the two deals in the case, Silberman's lead defense lawyer, San 
Francisco attorney James J. Brosnahan, said Wednesday it was time for the San 
Diego financier to tell his side of the story. 
</P>
<P>
The first deal, the swap of $100,000 for stock in a subsidiary of Silberman's 
San Diego-based gold mining firm, Yuba Natural Resources, began Nov. 30, 1988, 
when Ahearn delivered the money in a shoe box. The second, the exchange of 
$200,000 for U.S. Treasury bonds, got started on Feb. 22, 1989, again with 
Ahearn's delivery of the cash. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman said he was motivated to make the first deal after being pressured by 
a Swiss money manager, Andre Michaels, whose clients were unhappy with Yuba's 
financial performance. They were so unhappy, Silberman said, that Michaels 
badgered him into seeking buyers for his clients' stock. 
</P>
<P>
For help, Silberman called reputed mobster Chris Petti. A few weeks later, at a 
Nov. 9, 1988, meeting with Petti and government informer Robert Benjamin, 
Silberman was introduced to Ahearn at a Mission Valley coffee shop. 
</P>
<P>
According to Silberman, Ahearn did not mention Colombians but said he 
represented Mexican investors who needed "confidentiality." Silberman said he 
struck the deal with Ahearn to relieve pressure from Michaels and contended 
that Ahearn committed himself to the eventual purchase of $500,000 of Yuba 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that the $100,000 was broken into small sums and commissions 
were taken out. The $90,000 that was left, they say, was wired to a Hong Kong 
bank account that they contend Silberman controlled, then on to a Swiss bank. 
</P>
<P>
At no time did Ahearn tell him drugs were involved, Silberman said. In 
addition, he said, the question of whether the money came from drugs never 
arose with Benjamin and Petti. 
</P>
<P>
"If at any time I had heard drugs, I would have gotten up and walked out," 
Silberman said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder, the lead prosecutor in the case, 
pointed out to Silberman that the tapes show that, on Nov. 12, three days after 
the initial Mission Valley meeting, Ahearn, discussing his purported bosses, 
said to Silberman that "all they know is the coke." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't recall hearing that," Silberman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In a Dec. 2 phone call, Ahearn mentioned the "drug types," to which Silberman 
replied, "Let's us not even, uh, use any of the words any more," according to a 
tape recording of the call. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman said Wednesday that he heard Ahearn say "drug types" and added, "I 
didn't think he was talking about the source of the Mexican funds he had." 
</P>
<P>
Gorder also produced a letter Silberman wrote Feb. 14, 1990, that included this 
paragraph, which conflicted with his testimony that the question never came up: 
"Petti and Benjamin said Ahearn was a real estate investor and both said 
emphatically that the money was not drug-related." 
</P>
<P>
As part of the first deal, Silberman told Ahearn on several occasions that he 
himself had added $400,000 to the $100,000 the agent had supplied, making it a 
$500,000 transaction, since a larger deal would mean smaller fees along the 
way. But Silberman conceded Wednesday that he never did throw in an additional 
$400,000. 
</P>
<P>
When Gorder asked him if he had lied, Silberman said he preferred to call it an 
"exaggeration." 
</P>
<P>
Gorder did not have time Wednesday to ask about the second deal but is expected 
to today. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman insisted Wednesday that he had no interest in the second transaction 
and went through with it only after being coerced by Benjamin, the government 
informer who had been convicted of eight felonies, including bookmaking and 
bank fraud. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 5, 1989, Benjamin called him and reported that "Ahearn was not going to 
do any more stock deals, he was going to do something else, and I was going to 
do what he wanted to do," Silberman said.

PALOMAR AIRPORT OUTGROWING NEIGHBORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hugh Lyttleton's single-engine Cessna reduces a two-hour commute from Carlsbad 
to Santa Monica to a 45-minute flight. 
</P>
<P>
No need to stick to the schedules of commuter airlines flying out of Lindbergh 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
He also avoids the Interstate 5 "parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
And his luggage never gets lost. 
</P>
<P>
Lyttleton is one of an increasing number of professionals who fly their private 
airplanes out of Palomar Airport, expanding their business range, flexibility 
and time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a trade-off," said the accountant, who bought his four-seat plane six 
months ago. "You can get there less expensively by taking your car, but, from a 
business standpoint, you just don't have time to drive." 
</P>
<P>
Lyttleton, whose office is in Carlsbad, flies out of Palomar about once a week, 
both on business and for pleasure, and he is not alone. 
</P>
<P>
North County's expanding population and industry has meant an increased use of 
Palomar Airport, now the region's busiest civilian airport based on takeoffs 
and landings, said Rick Severson, program coordinator for county airports and a 
former Palomar Airport manager. 
</P>
<P>
"Palomar offers some kind of alternative transportation system to North County 
residents in way of commuting to, primarily, Los Angeles," Severson said. 
</P>
<P>
During 1989, there were 230,744 takeoffs and landings from Palomar, an average 
of 630 a day. That represents a 20% increase from 192,000 flights in 1987. By 
comparison, Lindbergh Field had 209,640 takeoffs and landings in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
About 60% of Palomar flights are business related, Severson said. 
</P>
<P>
Although its business has grown, the airport has basically stayed the same 
since its 1959 opening, Severson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Within the next 10 years, we'll reach our capacity," he said. "When you get to 
that point, there's no place to park airplanes. The aviation services will have 
to go elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Severson blames the space crunch on residents who, in 1979, fearing more noise 
and congestion, killed proposals that would have added a second airstrip and 
extended the existing runway. Even so, the airport receives noise complaints 
from residents, and the Federal Aviation Administration is studying noise 
abatement measures, Severson said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents feared that expansion would create a North County version of 
Lindbergh Field. An extension of the existing runway, they worried, would allow 
bigger, noisier airplanes to use the field. 
</P>
<P>
But Palomar Airport officials have repeatedly denied having plans for larger 
airplanes, and Severson said that it is too late for expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"All that has been shelved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1975, there was still bare ground around the airport where the county had 
intended to expand. Now the land has been sold to various corporations to 
develop an industrial park. The Koll Industrial Park, that's where the second 
runway was going to go." 
</P>
<P>
The airport now is totally built out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of a second runway has not discouraged aviators from flocking to the 
county-owned airfield. A new commuter service from Carlsbad to Los Angeles, run 
by Las Vegas-based Grand Airways, began April 2. 
</P>
<P>
The weekday commuter service, with one-way tickets costing $49 to $69, has been 
running at capacity since it started, said Jackie Warner, assistant marketing 
director for Grand. The Saturday runs are being eliminated. "The planes were 
literally taking off empty," Warner said. Only two flights will run Sunday, as 
opposed to the original four. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Airways makes four trips each weekday from Carlsbad to Los Angeles with 
twin-engine Cessnas capable of holding nine passengers, Warner said. This 
summer, the company might introduce weekend flights to and from Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been fantastic," Warner said of the weekday flights. "It just really 
surpassed expectations; they are going very, very well. Primarily we are 
getting the business traffic, and on Saturday we were hoping to pick up the 
leisure traffic, but that didn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
Flight schools at Palomar Airport also have done a brisk business since the end 
of the recession in 1984, catering not only to professionals wanting to cut 
down on their commutes, but also to students and residents who love to fly. 
</P>
<P>
"More businesses are established and growing," said Dawn Comerford, general 
manager of Four Winds, a flight school based at Palomar. "More people are 
getting into aviation. They're finding that, for the time they spend on the 
freeway for a business meeting, they can be there and back in a plane. 
</P>
<P>
"But we have all kinds of people renting," Comerford said. "We have a few that 
are students that are in college. We have people who rent just for recreation . 
. . and we have some business people who rent from us to go to Los Angeles for 
their business meetings. There is a wide variety of people who come through 
here." 
</P>
<P>
"Flying still has a mystique about it, and it's something people want to do," 
said Joan Boyle, a pilot and a teacher for Four Winds. 
</P>
<P>
The flock of airplanes overhead raises another concern, aside from noise, among 
residents in the three residential neighborhoods under the airport's flight 
path -- Terramar to the west, and Solamar and Alta Mira, south of Terramar. 
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest problem is safety," said Alan Kindle, a resident of La Costa, 
about 5 miles from the airport, who has tried to bring attention to low-flying 
aircraft in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"It boils down to the (Federal Aviation Administration's) allowing light 
aircraft to skim the rooftops," said Kindle, who says as many as 50 airplanes 
buzz over his El Aguila Street house on a busy Saturday. "It's an accident 
waiting to happen." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a fairly dense residential area with churches and schools, 
condominiums, apartments and single-family homes, and there is really no 
supervision at the airport tower except to give clearance to land and take 
off." 
</P>
<P>
Airport manager Albert J. Ransom denies that, saying a three-man crew in an FAA 
control tower supervises all air traffic within a 3-mile radius of the airport, 
to an altitude of 3,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the low-flying aircraft should not be a problem in the La Costa 
area, since most of the takeoffs and landings come from the northeast area of 
Palomar, not from the south, Ransom said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people see it as the noisier the aircraft is, the lower, but that's not 
necessarily the case," Ransom said, pointing out that factors such as how much 
throttle the pilot is applying and atmospheric conditions may effect noise 
levels, and thus the perception of flying low. 
</P>
<P>
Ransom said noise complaints from residents living northeast of the airport, 
such as Shadowridge and neighborhoods in the southern part of Vista, are 
common, and a noise study is being conducted by the FAA to determine how to 
alter takeoff and landing patterns to alleviate the noise. 
</P>
<P>
The $125,000 noise study will tell airport management where airplanes are 
making the most noise and how they can adjust flight patterns to lessen it. 
However, enforcement of those flight patterns is difficult, Ransom said. 
</P>
<P>
Violations by individual aircraft are more difficult to identify, since 
objective noise measurements are rarely available and identification of the 
aircraft by residents on the ground is often difficult. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the city and county have very little latitude in regulating 
the noise problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The FAA preempts us," said Ted Marioncelli, an aide to county Supervisor John 
MacDonald, whose district includes the airport. "What we were trying to do for 
the longest time is to enforce single event noise violations, but we found out 
we have no enforcement authority. Once that plane is in the air, the FAA 
controls it." 
</P>
<P>
Residents in the three residential communities west of the airport, many of 
them retirees, have complained of the noise. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not necessarily a real problem now, but it's heading that way," said 
Patrick Johnson, a Terramar resident. "I've been here for five years, and I can 
see it creeping up on us." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm often woken up by airplanes in the morning," Johnson said. "It used to 
happen very rarely, but nowadays it's every morning." 
</P>
<P>
Residents in Shadowridge, a community in Vista, also have expressed noise 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"We're affected by some pilots that fly very low outside the perimeter of the 
airport," said Klaas Meurs, a three-year resident of Shadowridge. "It's hilly 
country here, and there are a lot of developments at 500 feet, and if pilots 
fly at 1,000 feet, they're only 500 feet above the houses, and it's quite 
noisy." 
</P>
<P>
But Meurs, a pilot himself for eight years, recognizes that "it's only a very 
small percentage of pilots, considering the amount of movement at Palomar." 
</P>
<P>
Part of that growth has been aircraft owned by companies that were attracted to 
the city by the proximity of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of companies use their corporate planes to fly in and out, and there are 
many local businesses that have planes there," said Lee Bohlmann, executive 
vice president of the Carlsbad Chamber of Commerce, which uses the airport as a 
tool to attract industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people are not pleased with the service and the flight levels at 
Lindbergh Field," Bohlmann said. Operating their own plane or taking commuter 
flights gives them better service and greater flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
Tad Keegan, who, with several volunteers from Palomar College, is studying the 
airport's impact on the Carlsbad business climate, said the airport brings 
significant revenue to the community. 
</P>
<P>
"A small training airplane, if it's used quite a bit, can generate up to 
$90,000 a year for the economy in general," Keegan said, basing his figure on 
property taxes, maintenance, flight school tuition, fuel taxes, and airplane 
rental. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say that, as long as airport noise stays within bounds, they are 
content. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as it remains a general aviation airport, and we are able to maintain 
a 30 passengers or less limit on airplanes, I think Palomar Airport has done a 
lot for Carlsbad," Mayor Bud Lewis said.

The day after several embattled San Diego legislators carrying especially heavy 
political baggage easily survived bruising primaries, a plaintive and somewhat 
sobering question was being asked Wednesday in local political circles: 
</P>
<P>
If sexual harassment charges, criticism over living out of town, questions 
about alleged bribes or payoffs, acceptance of huge self-approved pay raises, 
using state-paid employees as a kind of private chauffeur service and 
sub-mediocre records are not enough for a challenger to dislodge an 
officeholder, then what exactly does it take to beat an incumbent? 
</P>
<P>
"You can't do it," political consultant Jim Johnston said emphatically. "Forget 
it -- you're wasting your time." 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, that's a question that I don't know the answer to," said consultant 
Tom Shepard, wryly referring to his efforts in Celia Ballesteros' unsuccessful 
campaign against Assemblyman Peter Chacon (D-San Diego). "I'd say it's close to 
impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Many consultants, political activists and candidates themselves drew the same 
message from Tuesday's primary, in which a handful of San Diego congressional 
and state legislative incumbents mired in ethics-related controversies easily 
turned back challenges from within their own party. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the primary results were analyzed, attention shifted to November -- in 
particular, to what lessons or impact Tuesday holds for the general election. 
</P>
<P>
With many predicting that the fall's campaigns will be lackluster by comparison 
to what was the most competitive primary season in recent San Diego political 
history, one of the few contests that may be a race in more than name only is 
the 78th District rematch between GOP Assemblyman-elect Jeff Marston and former 
Democratic San Diego City Councilman Mike Gotch. 
</P>
<P>
Marston's narrow three-percentage-point victory in their special runoff to fill 
the vacancy created by Democrat Lucy Killea's election to the state Senate, 
combined with the district's relative partisan parity, presage a potentially 
compelling showdown for the two-year term at stake in November. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Randall (Duke) Cunningham also is expected to run an aggressive, 
well-financed campaign against Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) in their 44th 
Congressional District contest, a race likely to focus on the by now well-known 
sexual harassment charges lodged against Bates by two former female staff 
members. 
</P>
<P>
"Bates is just another MiG, and an unethical one," Cunningham, a much-decorated 
Navy fighter pilot who served in Vietnam, said on Election Night. The 
Democrats' 54%-34% registration edge in the district, however, significantly 
lessens Cunningham's chances of shooting down the four-term congressman. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, though several incumbents were kept on the defensive by a barrage of 
criticism from their primary opponents, the consensus is that Tuesday's winners 
will be even more politically secure in November, in large measure because of 
their lopsided voter registration advantages in their districts. Primary 
challengers, while still having to overcome incumbents' name-recognition and 
fund-raising advantages, at least do not have those problems exacerbated by the 
demographic hurdle that confronts opponents from the opposite party. 
</P>
<P>
A vivid illustration of how the dynamics of the campaigns change dramatically 
from June to November can be seen in the 76th Assembly District, where 
Assemblywoman Tricia Hunter (R-Bonita) survived by the narrowest margin -- 52% 
to 48%, with some absentee ballots remaining to be counted -- of any state 
legislator from San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
As she prepares for her November race against Democratic nominee Stephen 
Thorne, however, Hunter can take comfort in the knowledge that the GOP holds an 
intimidating 55%-32% registration advantage in her North San Diego 
County-Riverside County district. (Hunter's primary opponent, anti-abortion 
activist Connie Youngkin, still clung to hope Wednesday that the uncounted 
absentee ballots could change the primary's outcome. In order to offset her 
2,500-vote deficit, however, Youngkin would have to receive an overwhelmingly 
large percentage of the remaining absentees.) 
</P>
<P>
"If there were going to be any upsets, they would have come in the primary," 
said lawyer Byron Georgiou, who heavily outspent U.S. Rep. Jim Bates (D-San 
Diego) but still lost by a more than 3-2 margin in their 44th District 
Democratic primary. "General elections usually are pretty much foregone 
conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
With statistics showing that, historically, more than 95% of incumbents are 
reelected, the difficulties inherent in trying to unseat an officeholder hardly 
rank as a new or startling conclusion. Between 1984 and 1988, for example, 
incumbents lost only five of the 495 congressional and state legislative races 
in California. Before Tuesday, the only congressman defeated this year was Rep. 
Donald (Buzz) Lukens (R-Ohio), who was convicted on morals charges involving a 
16-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, several incumbents' victories came amid the kind of debilitating 
controversies that often end political careers. 
</P>
<P>
Bates, Chacon and Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas), for example, 
have faced official investigations into their conduct. In Bates' case, the 
probe ended with a reprimand from the House Ethics Committee on the sexual 
harassment charges, while Mojonnier paid a $13,200 fine for double-billing the 
state and her campaign committee for business trips. 
</P>
<P>
Mojonnier and Chacon also faced questions over their acceptance of large 
honorariums -- $10,000 and $7,500, respectively -- from groups with a direct 
interest in legislation before them. Both also ranked very low in the 
California Journal's evaluation of state legislators' overall effectiveness -- 
in Chacon's case, next-to-last. The incumbents' other liabilities include 
Bates' vote to increase congressional salaries from $89,500 to $120,750, 
Mojonnier's use of state-paid sergeants-at-arms for private tasks and the fact 
that Chacon's primary residence is in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Any one of those factors, consultants argue, would represent a major "negative" 
in any campaign. The fact that Bates, Chacon and Mojonnier handily won 
renomination while having to deflect criticism over multiple negatives -- 
Mojonnier's 11 percentage points was the closest victory margin in the three 
races -- offers sobering evidence, strategists add, of incumbents' virtual 
political invincibility. 
</P>
<P>
"If this stuff wasn't enough to take out at least one of those guys, then I 
don't know how much more it takes," said consultant Johnston, who observed 
those races from the sidelines. "What it tells challengers it that they're 
taking up a lost cause, and the message it sends to incumbents is that they can 
pretty much do anything they damn well please and not have to worry about it." 
</P>
<P>
"The picture is not an encouraging one for challengers," said consultant Bill 
Wachob, who worked on Bates' campaign. "We were outspent about 2 to 1 by a 
strong opponent who ran a technically good campaign, and that still wasn't 
nearly enough." 
</P>
<P>
Explanations for Tuesday's results go beyond the visibility, fund-raising edge 
and other traditional advantages of incumbency. In most races, a strong case 
can be made that factors peculiar to that contest also figured prominently in 
the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Mojonnier, for example, clearly benefited from having the anti-incumbent vote 
in the 75th District splintered among three challengers, allowing her to win 
the primary with only 39% of the vote. In a one-on-one race against her major 
opponent, former Del Mar Mayor Ronnie Delaney, Mojonnier might easily have 
lost, many consultants say. 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros' challenge to Chacon, meanwhile, proceeded haltingly until a change 
in campaign management with only about three weeks remaining in the race. And 
Bates was able to chip away at Georgiou's own credibility by emphasizing the 
challenger's decision to move into the district after dropping out of the 
special 78th Assembly District contest. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, with so many competitive primaries vying for attention, none of 
the races attracted the kind of saturation news coverage that can help a 
challenger effectively compete with a better-known, usually better-financed 
incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the controversies swirling around them, the incumbents' popularity -- 
or at least longtime familiarity -- among their constituents also cannot be 
underestimated. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim Bates has put to rest the notion that he can ever -- ever -- be challenged 
on his home turf," said Larry Remer, another of Bates' consultants. "People 
have heard Jim Bates called every name imaginable, but that didn't cause them 
to forget that he's represented the district well for a long time. This was a 
real vote of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Others suggested that the sharply negative campaigns waged by many of the 
challengers provoked a backlash among voters. Though the incumbents' woes all 
but dictated such an approach, voters' growing disenchantment with "hit" pieces 
may have neutralized the anti-incumbent sentiment that many had predicted would 
be seen this year in reaction to recent scandals in Sacramento and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not enough anymore to just tell voters, 'He's a dirt bag and I'm not, so 
vote for me,' " said Marston consultant Sara Katz. "The mistake some of these 
people made was in spending too much time telling people why not to vote for 
their opponent and not enough about why they should vote for them." 
</P>
<P>
To bring the issue into focus, however, one must ask one other question: If all 
of this hindsight advice had been available and acted upon before the primary, 
would the outcome have been different? 
</P>
<P>
"Hell no!" consultant Johnston said. "Incumbents are lifers." 
</P>
<P>
He paused, then added: "Well, maybe a felony arrest the week before the 
election would help. But I doubt even that would change things."

JUDGE GRANTS WATER ORDINANCE FOES A 2ND CHANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opponents of Ventura's stringent water conservation ordinance got a second 
chance to challenge the law Wednesday when a Superior Court judge ruled that 
they could correct mistakes in a lawsuit they filed in April. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed by local attorney Lindsay Nielson, alleges that the ordinance 
-- setting penalties for households that use too much water -- violates 
residents' constitutional right to equal protection because a family of four is 
allowed the same amount as a person living alone. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also argues that the city should have done an environmental impact 
report before adopting the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first legal challenge to a water conservation ordinance in California 
since a statewide drought began four years ago, City Atty. Peter Bulens said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, however, contained one serious flaw: it challenged the wrong 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Calling it a typing error, Nielson asked Bulens to allow him to amend the 
mistake, but Bulens refused and asked Judge Melinda Johnson to dismiss the 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
After a hearing that lasted about 60 seconds, Johnson agreed that the suit was 
flawed but granted Nielson 30 days to fix it. 
</P>
<P>
She also ruled that Nielson neglected to sign the ordinance and said the suit 
didn't show that Nielsen had "failed to exhaust all administrative remedies" 
before going to court. 
</P>
<P>
Nielson said he expected Johnson's ruling and was confident that he could bring 
back a complaint that would stand up in court. "We've made some errors but 
we'll straighten up things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That the city wouldn't allow us to do the amendments just stretches things out 
and makes us waste a lot of time, but it's their prerogative and I totally 
understand it." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Mike Dougherty, who appeared in court Wednesday, said the 
city challenged Nielson's bid to amend his "poorly drafted" complaint because 
"had I agreed, I would have waived a defense the city has, which is that the 
statute of limitations on the ordinance expired." 
</P>
<P>
Had Johnson not allowed the amendments, Nielson would have not been able to 
file a new suit because the period for challenging a new ordinance expired in 
30 days.

VOTERS THUMP TAX MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the overwhelming defeat of a 5% utility tax increase confirmed Wednesday, 
an Oxnard city councilman said heavy cuts in services and personnel, including 
police and fire protection, are now the only alternative to avoiding a 
projected $2.8-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Measure C, which would have generated $5 million annually and was designed to 
solve the city's financial crisis, was rejected by almost a 3-to-1 margin, 
despite warnings from city officials that defeat of the measure would mean 
drastic budget cuts and layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Your level of service depends on your revenues," said Councilman Manuel Lopez, 
a vocal supporter of the measure who said he was surprised and disappointed at 
the results. 
</P>
<P>
He said cuts in police and fire services are now inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Although supporters and opponents of Measure C expressed surprise at the margin 
of defeat, they said voters might have rejected the measure out of frustration 
over the city's handling of its finances. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents said that for the last three years the city has had to dip into 
reserve funds to balance its budget. Last year, shortly after the city found 
that estimates of revenue for the 1988-89 fiscal year were about $2 million too 
high, the city announced a surprise find of $1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The city administration has lost all its credibility," said Curtis Davison, 
treasurer for an anti-tax group called Oxnard Residents for Responsible 
Government, which led the opposition to Measure C. 
</P>
<P>
The tax measure received 4,101 votes in support and 11,069 votes against. 
Election officials said a final tally will not be announced for days, pending 
the count of absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
The voter turnout was up slightly from previous ballot measure elections, with 
34% of the city's 46,643 voters going to the polls, city officials said. Two 
years ago, 14% of Oxnard's registered voters went to the polls to decide on a 
ballot measure that made city treasurer an elected post. 
</P>
<P>
The results of Tuesday's elections were a stunning defeat for Citizens for 
Public Safety, a pro-tax group that spent almost $45,000 to persuade voters to 
approve the measure and had the support of the Oxnard Peace Officers Assn. and 
the Oxnard Firefighters Assn. 
</P>
<P>
During the last two weeks, Citizens for Public Safety distributed 56,000 
brochures, while off-duty police officers and firefighters went door-to-door to 
urge voters to approve the measure, warning that Los Angeles gangs would take 
over the city if the measure was defeated. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, opponents of the tax, including the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce, 
spent about $4,500 to defeat the measure. The group had no official 
headquarters and did no door-to-door campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
Davison said he thinks each vote cast in opposition to the measure was 
tantamount to a no-confidence vote for the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
He said the election results sent a message to the City Council, telling it to 
stop its free-spending attitude. Davison predicted that voters would express 
the same sentiment in November, when the mayor's post and two council seats 
will be up for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Lopez agreed that the results seemed to reflect voter frustration 
with the city's ongoing fiscal problems and said the council is partly to 
blame. 
</P>
<P>
He said getting voter approval of any tax is always an uphill battle but that 
the council should have responded more often to critics' accusations of 
mismanagement and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety-nine percent of the time we don't respond because the charges are so 
outlandish," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said the recent surge in commercial and industrial development in Oxnard 
may lead to higher tax revenues in about five or six years but will do nothing 
toward solving the city's current fiscal crisis. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city's financial woes were partly created in 1987 when the City 
Council eliminated a 4% utility tax two years before it was to have ended. He 
said that alone cost the city between $7 million and $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
George Lauterbach, president of the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce, disagreed. He 
said the utility tax was only generating about $1.5 million annually when it 
was eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city's fiscal crisis was due to a history of bad spending decisions 
by the City Council. For example, he questioned why the council has agreed to 
spend $13 million for a new library when it is unable to raise enough revenue 
to keep the current library open daily. 
</P>
<P>
"The message is that people are feeling that things have not gone well," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In a report to the council last week, City Manager David Mora recommended 
eliminating 64 positions -- including 16 police officers and eight firefighters 
-- to balance next year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
The budget-cutting measures include closure of the Carnegie Art Museum, the 
elimination of Sunday library hours, the cancellation of the Community Center 
Youth Recreation Program and elimination of a $400,000 annual donation to the 
Oxnard Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Had the tax increase been approved, the city would have used part of the new 
revenues to hire 36 additional employees -- including 15 new police officers 
and 13 new firefighters, Mora's report says. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Dempsey, campaign manager for Citizens for Public Safety, said he 
believes that voters rejected the tax increase based on a gut reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a natural instinct for us not to like a tax," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although his group had urged voters to approve the measure to retain current 
levels of police and fire service, Dempsey said the defeat does not reflect a 
rejection of the city's police and fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
He said voters probably rejected the tax increase because they disagree with 
the way the council has been handling its finances. Dempsey, a professional 
campaign manager who worked as an aide to 1988 presidential candidate Alexander 
Haig, credited opponents of the measure for playing to voter frustration with 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said there is now a "feeling of impending doom" among police and 
firefighters who fear the council will order layoffs in their departments to 
offset a deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the measure's biggest supporters -- including Mayor Nao Takasugi, 
Bill Lewis, president of the Oxnard Peace Officers Assn., and Bill Gallaher, 
president of the Oxnard Firefighters Assn. -- did not return phone calls 
Wednesday. Dempsey speculated that some of Measure C's supporters were laying 
low after the vote.

STUDENTS SEE HOW IDEAS FLY IN CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The children chose bold names for their airplanes: Supersonic Spyplane, 391 
Speedbird and Jetski III. Although these planes were made of flimsy white 
paper, their young pilots took them as seriously as the shuttles they hope to 
ride into outer space someday. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be an astronaut," said Jesus Sanchez, 8. "I want to explore." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez and about 14 other members of the Young Astronaut Program flew the 
paper planes in a contest Wednesday in the yard of the E.P. Foster Elementary 
School in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
The nationwide program for elementary and junior high school students promotes 
science, mathematics and space-related subjects. The effort is intended to help 
reverse the low proficiency levels of American students in these subjects, 
compared with children in other industrialized countries. 
</P>
<P>
The students' creations were judged by the school's principal and two reading 
specialists on the planes' distance, speed and fancy acrobatics. Using scissors 
and thin white paper, the students designed the planes, adding ridges and folds 
that enabled the aircraft to dip and glide in strange patterns. Paper clips 
mounted to the folds increased the planes' speed. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez's F-14 Tomcat, an intricately folded plane, earned him the title of 
overall winner and first place in the distance category and second place in 
acrobatics. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez's peers also expressed an avid interest in aviation. Mario Pena, who 
placed third in distance, said he too wanted to go into space. "I'd like to see 
the planets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Winning planes flew 20 to 30 feet, and some remained in the air for more than 
two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher Catharine Byl began a chapter of the Young Astronauts Program at the 
school in February and has helped about 20 second- and third-grade students 
build model space shuttles, understand gravity and weightlessness and 
experiment with team-related projects. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a real need for kids today to improve in those areas," she said, 
adding that aerospace and aviation will be among the major fields in the future 
as the technological revolution continues. 
</P>
<P>
Byl has been active in the Eagle Flight Program, an organization that trains 
classroom teachers to instruct other teachers on methods to teach aerospace in 
the classroom.

paper airplanes in the classroom. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEVER SAW MOLESTATIONS, EX-MCMARTIN TEACHER 
SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former teacher at the McMartin Pre-School who was once a defendant in the 
molestation case testified Wednesday at Ray Buckey's retrial that she never saw 
any molestations occur there. 
</P>
<P>
Babette Spitler was one of seven original defendants when the case was filed in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
She and four other defendants were dismissed from the case in 1986 because of 
insufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Spitler, testifying on the second day of the defense's case, said she never saw 
any children being molested at the Manhattan Beach preschool. 
</P>
<P>
She testified at the retrial of Buckey, the sole defendant remaining in the 
case. Buckey, 32, is being retried on eight molestation counts alleging that he 
sexually abused three girls at the nursery from 1978 until 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, were acquitted in January of 
52 other molestation counts at the first trial in the case. Jurors deadlocked 
on the eight counts on which Buckey is being retried.

The Oxnard City Council has voted unanimously to spend $10,000 to pay two 
police officers to patrol and keep off-road vehicles from driving through the 
Ormond Beach Wetlands on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the city reinforced a vehicle barrier and approved higher 
fines for trespassers in an effort to limit damage that off-road vehicles 
inflict on the wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
However, at the request of various state and federal environmental groups, the 
city decided to fortify its efforts by paying two police officers to work extra 
eight-hour shifts on weekends, a city report says. 
</P>
<P>
The patrols, which began two weeks ago, will be paid for by money taken from a 
special fund reserved for redevelopment of the Ormond Beach area, the report 
says. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and environmentalists have said that all-terrain vehicles have 
caused extensive damage to the wetlands, which include almost 200 acres of 
dunes and marshes. The area is believed to be home to more than 200 species of 
birds, 35 species of fish and 190 species of vertebrates, including squirrels, 
possums, skunks and raccoons. 
</P>
<P>
Ormond Beach extends along about two miles of coastline, bounded on the south 
by Point Mugu Naval Air Station Pacific Missile Test Range and on the north by 
the city of Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the council increased the fine for trespassing on the beach to $200 
from $50. A month later, the city welded shut a gate that blocked the main 
access to the beach at Arnold Road. HUGO MARTIN

MAN, 60, FOUND GUILTY IN KIDNAP, SLAYING OF GIRL; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: A JURY CONVICTS A DRIFTER AFTER DELIBERATING ONLY FOUR HOURS. HIS DEATH 
SENTENCE HEARING STARTS JUNE 18.

After only four hours of deliberations, a jury on Wednesday found Roland Norman 
Comtois guilty of kidnaping and murdering a 14-year-old Chatsworth girl and 
shooting her 13-year-old friend, leaving the wounded girl for dead in an 
abandoned auto. 
</P>
<P>
The bearded, 60-year-old drifter sat expressionless as the San Fernando 
Superior Court clerk read the guilty verdicts for each of the eight counts 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives and friends of the slain girl, Wendy Masuhara, hugged one another and 
wept as the verdicts were read. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't bring her back," the dead girl's father, Allen Masuhara, said outside 
the courtroom later, but "it will make it a little bit better." 
</P>
<P>
"We're glad this part's almost over," said her mother, Lynne Masuhara, 
anticipating the penalty phase during which the same jury will decide whether 
to sentence Comtois to death or life imprisonment without possibility of 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Ronald S. Coen instructed the jury to reconvene June 18 to begin hearing 
arguments in the sentencing phase, which is expected to last about two days. 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Harold S. Lynn, who prosecuted Comtois, said he will argue 
for the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"The facts are about as gruesome as you can get," Lynn said outside the 
courtroom. Comtois can be sentenced to death because the jury found that the 
crime included legally required special circumstances, including the charge 
that the murder was committed during the course of a kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
Comtois' alleged accomplice, Marsha Lynn Ramos, 36, could also face the death 
penalty. Her trial on murder and other charges is scheduled to begin July 9. 
</P>
<P>
The jury found Comtois guilty of first-degree murder in the killing of the 
Masuhara girl, whom he shot in the head in an abandoned station wagon in remote 
Woolsey Canyon near the Chatsworth Reservoir on Sept. 19, 1987. He was also 
found guilty of attempted murder in the shooting of the girl's friend, who 
survived because her upraised hand deflected the bullet and Comtois had left 
her for dead. 
</P>
<P>
It was the surviving girl's description of her assailant that led to Comtois' 
arrest four days after the attack, and it was her testimony in the two-week 
trial that provided the foundation for the prosecution's case. 
</P>
<P>
The surviving girl testified that she and her friend were lured into Comtois' 
camper by Ramos while walking in the quiet residential neighborhood where they 
lived. Comtois came up behind them with a gun and drove them to another 
location, where he forced the younger girl to orally copulate him, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl said Comtois injected her with cocaine and drove to the canyon, where 
he placed them in the station wagon and shot them. The girl, who was wearing a 
blood-soaked sweater around a wound in her neck as she walked along a nearby 
road, was seen by a passing motorist who drove her to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's verdict capped an unusually short, two-week trial during which the 
prosecution called 18 witnesses and defense lawyers called nine. 
</P>
<P>
"It's disappointing," said James D. Gregory, one of two attorneys appointed to 
defend Comtois, after Wednesday's verdict was read. "Now we're going to put all 
our effort into showing this jury why Mr. Comtois should live." 
</P>
<P>
Comtois has spent most of his life in and out of prison for crimes that 
included rape, robbery and heroin dealing. In 1962, a probation officer wrote 
about Comtois: "He has lashed back at society with a vengeance, reaching out 
for what he wants with total disregard of the rights of others. . . . His 
personality affect is of a man who is very matter-of-fact, cold, hostile, 
cynical and daring." 
</P>
<P>
The jury also convicted Comtois of two counts of kidnaping, one count of 
attempted sodomy, one count of committing a lewd act on a child, one count of 
forcible oral copulation and one count of furnishing a controlled substance to 
a minor.

'LOST VILLAGE' ISN'T A LANDMARK, PANEL SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
HERITAGE: THE CITY SAYS THERE'S NO PROOF THAT THE SITE WHERE TWO OFFICE 
BUILDINGS ARE PLANNED CONTAINS EXTENSIVE ARTIFACTS. 
</P>

<P>
The city Cultural Heritage Commission refused Wednesday to consider two 
redevelopment sites near the "Lost Village of Encino" for designation as 
historical monuments, citing lack of proof that they contain archeological 
artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
But the commissioners said they would reconsider the application if a coalition 
of suburban homeowners and American Indians can substantiate claims that the 
vacant lots are among "the most sensitive archeological sites in the entire San 
Fernando Valley." 
</P>
<P>
During the 90-minute hearing in City Hall, the commission's staff architect and 
attorney both said that despite the significance of the 1984 "Lost Village" 
excavation, the presence of more Indian remains in the area near Ventura and 
Balboa boulevards has yet to be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin M. Reznik, a prominent attorney who represents Valley developers, 
agreed, and argued that state laws would protect any artifacts found during 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
"Does the city go around designating properties based on speculation and 
hearsay?" Reznik asked. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also urged developers, who are poised to begin construction of 
two office buildings, to first allow neighborhood activists to conduct 
archeological surveys on the property. But Gerald Silver, president of 
Homeowners of Encino, countered that such studies were the developers' 
responsibility. Reznik said he would advise his client, Katell/Capretta 
Partners of Gardena, against doing anything not legally required. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole thing is a hoax," Reznik said after the hearing, charging that 
Silver was but the latest activist to exploit the commission for a slow-growth 
campaign. Silver has also appealed the two projects' construction permits to 
the city Building and Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Reznik and others have accused the commission in recent months of caving in to 
anti-development activists and awarding the monument designation too liberally. 
In a recent controversial case, the commission declared a portion of bucolic 
Fryman Canyon in the Hollywood Hills a cultural monument in response to a 
request from Valley residents who opposed a luxury residential development. 
</P>
<P>
The cultural commission's decision Wednesday came after some tense testimony, 
including the pleas of a father on behalf of his sons, who are developing one 
of the office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"Please, if this deal for my children goes bad, I'm afraid they may have a 
heart attack," said an emotional Ned Cohen, who described finding his sons 
Maurice and Albert with their heads in their hands this week because of 
Silver's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The Cohen brothers of Studio City, both in their late 20s, want to build a 
47,800-square-foot office building at Ventura Boulevard and La Maida Street, 
east of Los Encinos State Historic Park and across the street from the "Lost 
Village" site. Ned Cohen said his sons would go bankrupt if the project 
encounters more delays. 
</P>
<P>
Had the cultural commission agreed to consider Silver's application, 
construction would have been automatically delayed for 60 days while the panel 
visited the sites and made their recommendation to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1 million artifacts and the remains of about two dozen Indians were 
excavated from the "Lost Village" site six years ago at a cost of $1.7 million. 
Experts contend that it is the site of a major Indian city that was documented 
by 18th-Century Spanish explorers and long sought by modern archeologists. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the site -- at the southeast corner of Ventura and Balboa boulevards -- 
is covered by a large office building. The human remains found during the 
building's 1984 construction have been reburied in Los Encinos State Historic 
Park, and the artifacts remain in storage. 
</P>
<P>
Reznik, whose client plans a $25 million, 132,000-square-foot office building 
near the northeast corner of Ventura and Balboa boulevards, questioned why no 
one applied for the historic-cultural designation when the "Lost Village" was 
unearthed. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating arguments that he is more interested in Ventura Boulevard's 
density than he is in American Indian heritage, Silver told the commission: 
</P>
<P>
"I have to say candidly that yes, Homeowners of Encino is very distressed by 
the developments that have taken place. But I ask that you make your 
determination solely on the facts, on the merits of this case." 
</P>
<P>
Another Encino resident, Kathy Lewis of Property Owners of Encino, asked that 
the commission use its power to freeze the developers' building permits and 
give her 60 days to attempt to negotiate with the developers for archeological 
surveys. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice Cohen told the commission that he would be willing to pay for such a 
survey. But later, after consulting with builder Jerry Katell in the hallway, 
Cohen said he was undecided.

POLICE, SCHOOLS LOSE BIDS FOR TAX DOLLARS 
</P>

Read their lips: No new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
That was the message voters in Hawthorne and a neighboring county area gave to 
police and school officials who came with their hats in their hands Tuesday 
asking for extra tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
For the second time in two years, Hawthorne voters rejected a measure to raise 
property taxes for added police, this time just 58 votes short of victory. At 
the same time, a proposed parcel tax to raise money for the Wiseburn School 
District, which includes Hawthorne and a portion of unincorporated territory, 
garnered the support of less than 55% of the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Both measures needed the approval of two-thirds to pass. 
</P>
<P>
"It comes down to fear of an added tax," said Cora Travers, who chaired a 
committee that campaigned for the school tax, Proposition X. "That word is a 
turnoff and nobody will read any of the print following." 
</P>
<P>
The defeat of the police measure, Proposition D, which would have raised about 
$2.9 million to hire and retain an additional 35 officers, came as a surprise 
to supporters who had campaigned vigorously for the tax and had argued that it 
was the Hawthorne Police Department's only chance at making inroads against the 
city's rising crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne Mayor Betty Ainsworth said Wednesday that the measure -- which would 
have taxed homeowners $55 a year, apartment owners $70 per unit and businesses 
$5.50 per frontage foot to a maximum of $5,000 -- was essential because the 
city can't afford to pay for more officers. The measure's defeat means that 
police will have to change their priorities to make do with fewer officers, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, police may have to stop participating in crime prevention 
programs at schools, Ainsworth said. They may no longer be able to take reports 
on minor traffic accidents, and more victims may have to come to the police 
station to report crimes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the majority of the people realize that you have to pay for good 
services," Ainsworth said. "But unfortunately, the majority doesn't rule 
anymore," she added, referring to Proposition 13, a statewide initiative passed 
in 1978 that requires all tax measures to pass by two-thirds instead of a 
simple majority. The police tax, which was supported by 65.8% of Tuesday's 
voters, lost by less than 1%. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the tax, however, rejoiced over the defeat of Proposition D, 
saying city officials might now take seriously their calls for a study into 
whether the city could save money by dismantling the city Police Department and 
contracting with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
"All (city officials) know how to do is spend money and raise taxes instead of 
doing the research to find out how they could save money," said community 
activist Raymon Sulser, who wrote the ballot argument against Proposition D. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few weeks before the election, supporters of the police tax spent 
as many as six hours daily walking precincts, calling voters, posting signs and 
distributing flyers in a show of dedication that many said was unprecedented in 
Hawthorne's history. Opponents didn't even organize a political action 
committee and only began to speak against the measure a week before the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign for the proposal appeared to have suffered a setback nearly two 
weeks ago when the city settled a police brutality lawsuit filed by members of 
the Vagos motorcycle club for $1.95 million. Anti-tax sentiment also may have 
been fueled by last-minute allegations by Sulser and other opponents that the 
city had violated state laws in not providing a copy of the ordinance in the 
sample ballot. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, who made copies of the ordinance available on request, have 
denied they committed any election violations. 
</P>
<P>
While opponents quietly watched the election results from their own homes 
Tuesday night, more than 100 supporters gathered at the headquarters of 
Citizens Against Crime to munch on sandwiches while ballots were tallied. The 
crowd remained optimistic and continued to cling to hope until well into the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of anything we didn't do," supporter Shelley Effler said Tuesday 
as the first results trickled in. "If it doesn't pass, it's not for lack of 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
But many conceded that the two tax measures may have worked against each other, 
although only those voters who live in the Holly Glen area of Hawthorne would 
have been asked to vote for both. 
</P>
<P>
Wiseburn Supt. John McCarthy said Tuesday that school officials had been 
concerned that the Hawthorne police measure would adversely affect theirs. But 
he said budgetary deadlines precluded waiting until November to place it on the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the parcel tax, which would have raised homeowners' taxes $100 
for a maximum of four years to generate about $350,000 annually for the school 
district, had argued that by helping the district maintain programs in music 
and computer literacy the measure would be good for property values. But 
despite the lack of any organized opposition to the tax, more than 45% of the 
voters rejected the proposal, with only 54.6% voting in favor. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 2 1/2-square-mile district could rely on its reserves to fund 
those programs for the next two years, McCarthy said school officials will 
probably have to look at selling or leasing a surplus school site to raise 
money, a process that is uncertain and could take several years.

2 TOP LAWNDALE OFFICIALS CHARGED; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE CITY MANAGER AND PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR ARE ACCUSED OF 
MISHANDLING THE ASBESTOS IN 3 BUILDINGS THEY RAZED.

<P>
Misdemeanor charges were filed this week against two top Lawndale city 
officials who have been under investigation since November for their roles in 
the improper demolition of three city-owned buildings that contained asbestos 
panels. 
</P>
<P>
Lawndale City Manager James Arnold and Public Works Director James Sanders each 
were charged with five counts of illegally disposing of hazardous waste and 12 
counts of failing to comply with state and federal regulations regarding the 
handling of asbestos in connection with the demolition last June of the 
buildings, at the former city yard. 
</P>
<P>
"They knew there was asbestos in the buildings, and they failed to take 
necessary precautions," Deputy Dist. Atty. Anthony Patchett said Monday. "They 
are in positions of responsibility and authority. They should obey the law, and 
they failed to do so." 
</P>
<P>
Lawndale City Atty. David Aleshire defended the city officials Tuesday, saying 
the incident "just doesn't seem like a criminal case." He said that until Jan. 
1, 1990, the South Coast Air Quality Management District did not have 
regulations covering the type of asbestos tiles and panels found in the houses. 
</P>
<P>
Patchett, however, strongly disputed that, saying the panels posed a health 
risk and should have been handled in accordance with state guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold called the charges "massive overkill" on Wednesday, but said he wanted 
to speak with his attorney before commenting further on the case. Sanders did 
not return calls to City Hall this week. Both are to be arraigned June 20 in 
South Bay Municipal Court. If they are found guilty of willfully ignoring the 
regulations, Patchett said, he would recommend they be fined $5,000 and serve 
at least 90 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the demolition, Sanders was praised by some city officials for 
having mounted a bulldozer himself to raze the buildings after a contractor 
asked to postpone the work. Neighbors soon complained that the bulldozing by 
Sanders and a city crew left their houses covered with dust. When they learned 
that the demolished houses had contained asbestos, they lodged a formal 
complaint with the Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
Paula Cone, then assistant city manager, who lived in one of the houses in 1968 
when it belonged to an in-law, told investigators that she twice warned Arnold 
and Sanders that the buildings contained asbestos, Patchett said. But they 
ignored her, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office began investigating the case in November after 
the AQMD cited the city for failing to comply with district requirements for 
the safe disposal of asbestos, a once-popular form of insulation that is now 
known to cause cancer and other lung ailments, Patchett said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he had planned to file felony charges in April, Patchett said, he was 
told to speak with another asbestos expert before proceeding with the case to 
determine whether misdemeanor charges would be more appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
According to state health and safety codes and AQMD regulations, panels 
containing more than 1% of asbestos must be handled in accordance with strict 
guidelines to ensure that asbestos fibers aren't released into the environment. 
Chemical tests on two samples of siding taken from the demolished houses at 
167th Street and Osage Avenue concluded that one contained 4% asbestos and the 
other contained 20%, Patchett said. 
</P>
<P>
The guidelines require that prior notification be given to the AQMD whenever a 
structure containing asbestos is to be demolished, that asbestos-containing 
material be kept wet to reduce the amount of dust released into the air, and 
that workers place the waste in sealed containers. 
</P>
<P>
Patchett said Sanders, who personally participated in the demolition of the 
buildings, and Arnold, who is his immediate supervisor, violated all three 
regulations. Although it is not known whether any neighbors were exposed to 
enough asbestos dust to suffer health problems, Patchett said, "from what we 
hear from the residents, we do feel there was a considerable amount of dust and 
particles in the air." 
</P>
<P>
The three buildings, which were private homes when they were bought by the city 
in 1968, were used to store tractor tires, Christmas decorations and inoperable 
city vehicles. In 1989, several years after Lawndale opened a new city yard on 
Manhattan Beach Boulevard, city officials decided to raze the buildings at the 
old yard to put in a city park. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city had hired a contractor specializing in asbestos removal to 
demolish another city-owned house on Burin Avenue the year before, no such 
steps were taken with respect to the three buildings in the former city yard, 
Patchett said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the city hired a contractor to tear down the buildings without 
mentioning that they contained asbestos, he said. When workers for Kirtland 
&amp; Sons Demolition arrived at the houses to start the job, however, they 
discovered the electricity was still on and they asked to reschedule, Mark 
Kirtland told an investigator in papers filed with the court. 
</P>
<P>
Angry at the delay, Sanders fired Kirtland from the job, rented a bulldozer, 
rolled up his sleeves and proceeded to do the job with city workers from June 
22 to June 26, Patchett said. 
</P>
<P>
Aleshire said he believed Sanders was anxious to get the job done because 
"people were yelling and screaming about doing this project, and I think (city 
officials) felt a lot of pressure to get the projects done. Perhaps in the rush 
there was a lack of appreciation for what the regulations were, but the 
question is, 'Is what they were doing criminal in nature?' " 
</P>
<P>
Sanders said he discovered the houses contained asbestos during his first day 
on the job and that he "determined it was not dangerous and had city employees, 
equipped with old clothes and paper masks, remove the broken pieces of asbestos 
and store it in 55-gallon drums," according to court papers. 
</P>
<P>
A private environmental consultant who tested the materials for the city a 
month later concluded that the 200 square feet of panels found in the homes 
contained a kind of "nonfriable" asbestos, a technical term that means it 
cannot be easily broken into fibers. The asbestos panels had not contaminated 
the surrounding air or soil and "the area does not pose a health hazard," the 
private laboratory report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
But Patchett said that those tests were useless because they were conducted a 
month after the buildings were demolished and that it is clear from neighbors' 
complaints that some asbestos dust was released into the air.

South Bay incumbents breezed through their primaries, but a pair of Democrat 
challengers remain locked in a struggle to determine which of them will face 
U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) in the Nov. 6 general election. 
</P>
<P>
Of the dozen congressmen, assemblymen and state senators up for reelection in 
the region, only U.S. Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton) and Assemblyman Dave 
Elder (D-San Pedro) faced primary opposition Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Neither politician was put to the test. 
</P>
<P>
Dymally trounced two challengers, Inglewood lawyer Lawrence A. Grigsby and 
former Compton College Trustee Carl E. Robinson Sr., garnering 73% of the vote 
to Grigsby's 15% and Robinson's 12%. Elder crushed his lone opponent, 
unemployed physics teacher Ed Musgrave of Long Beach, winning 85% of the 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
"Rarely in my experience does an incumbent get more than 70%," Elder said 
Wednesday. "This is quite a pleasant outcome." 
</P>
<P>
The South Bay's other state and federal legislative races involved little-known 
challengers running for the right to face U.S. Reps. Rohrabacher, Glenn M. 
Anderson (D-San Pedro) and Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica) in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
In the fight among Democrats vying to take on Rohrabacher, political science 
instructor Guy C. Kimbrough of Huntington Beach was only 14 votes ahead of 
computer industry publisher James Cavuoto of Torrance with more than 38,000 
ballots counted. 
</P>
<P>
A third candidate, retired high school teacher Bryan W. Stevens of Rolling 
Hills Estates, was 1,204 votes off the pace. Election officials said an 
undetermined number of late-arriving absentee ballots remain to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
In a two-man GOP battle over who would challenge Levine, West Los Angeles 
lawyer David Barrett Cohen sailed past Playa del Rey computer salesman Hans 
Yeager with 64% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Another two-way GOP battle, this one for the right to challenge Anderson, was 
won by Sanford W. Kahn, a gas company salesman from Long Beach, who collected 
58% of the vote to beat Jerry Bakke of Wilmington, an insurance agent and 
former truckers union leader. 
</P>
<P>
Operating with shoestring campaign budgets in districts dominated by the 
opposing party, the winning challengers acknowledged Wednesday that they will 
have a hard time unseating incumbents in the Nov. 6 general election. But they 
expressed optimism nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
Said Kahn of his upcoming race against Anderson, an 11-term incumbent: "I think 
there is a strong anti-incumbent feeling. If I can play on that . . . I think 
the public is ready." 
</P>
<P>
Dymally's win came amid charges by Grigsby that the five-term incumbent is too 
closely tied to Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko, whose government has been 
identified by the U.S. State Department as repressive and corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
One of Grigsby's flyers said: "Your congressman works for a billionaire 
dictator. Not for you." Dymally, a longtime supporter of Mobutu, dismissed 
Grigsby's attacks as part of a plot by the New York-based New Alliance Party to 
discredit him. 
</P>
<P>
Having prevailed in the primary, Dymally must now beat Republican Eunice N. 
Sato, a former Long Beach City Council member, to keep his seat in the 31st 
Congressional District, which includes Hawthorne, Gardena, Carson and Harbor 
Gateway in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Elder's victory followed an extremely low-key primary campaign. Musgrave, 
Elder's opponent, said he had enough money to campaign in only four of the 204 
precincts in the 57th Assembly District, which embraces San Pedro, Wilmington, 
Harbor City and much of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Elder's Republican challenger in the general election, welfare caseworker 
Rodney D. Guarneri of Long Beach, says he will also have limited supplies of 
campaign funds. But Guarneri vows he will hit the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have resources of the kind Dave Elder has, but I'm going to meet 
people at the door," Guarneri said. "With the kind of stamina I have and the 
time I have, I should be able to walk a lot of precincts. I'm going to be going 
full bore." 
</P>
<P>
The closest thing to competition in the South Bay's legislative races occurred 
in three congressional primaries where challengers vied with each other for the 
right to take on incumbents in November. 
</P>
<P>
Most striking was the still-unresolved race by Democrats competing to run 
against Rohrabacher in the 42nd Congressional District, which stretches from 
Torrance and the Palos Verdes Peninsula to Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The race may boil down to Kimbrough's decision to send a campaign mailing to 
absentee voters -- and Cavuoto's failure to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Election officials in Los Angeles and Orange counties said Wednesday that the 
only ballots remaining to be counted were absentee votes received on Election 
Day. Kimbrough, who had been outpacing Cavuoto among absentees by better than a 
2-1 margin, appeared confident that he would win. 
</P>
<P>
"I would expect the absentee ballots would be pretty much in line with the 
earlier ones," said Kimbrough, who lost to Rohrabacher 33% to 64% in the 1988 
general election. "The final tally will likely show me a few hundred votes 
ahead." 
</P>
<P>
But Cavuoto, making his first run for public office, expressed confidence. Many 
of the absentee voters whose ballots were received on Election Day may not have 
left home before getting his regular campaign mailings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've got a good chance," he said. "I'm very encouraged." Cavuoto said 
he had not decided whether he would request a recount. 
</P>
<P>
In the GOP primary in Anderson's 32nd Congressional District, which includes 
San Pedro and Lomita, Kahn won despite collecting less than half the amount of 
campaign cash raised by Bakke. That gives him a chance to challenge Anderson 
for the second time. In 1988, Anderson beat Kahn by a margin of better than 2 
to 1. 
</P>
<P>
In Levine's 27th Congressional District -- which in the South Bay encompasses 
Lawndale, Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach, Manhattan Beach, El Segundo and parts 
of Torrance and Inglewood -- both GOP challengers were political newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
But Barrett Cohen quit his job as a corporate lawyer to devote all his time to 
the campaign, out-organizing and outspending Yeager. On Wednesday, he vowed he 
would give Levine a fight, despite the incumbent's gargantuan $1.5-million 
campaign war chest. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're going to surprise a lot of people," Cohen said. "I don't intend 
to be anybody's sacrificial lamb."

THE HOUSE 
</P>
<P>
Free Mail for Members 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 161 to 208, House members refused to appropriate an additional $25 
million to cover postage for their mailings back home this election year. The 
money was sought because the House is expected to spend nearly twice the $44.5 
million already appropriated for its franked mail in fiscal 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The vote occurred as the House sent a $4.4-billion spending bill (HR 4404) to 
the Senate. It showed members becoming increasingly sensitive to charges that 
they abuse the franking privilege. But it will have little practical effect 
because the Postal Service is required by law to deliver congressional mail 
even when appropriations for postage have run out. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento) said, "We are not seeing an excessive use of 
the frank" given the increased cost of processing constituent mail. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) said House members have become "addicted to 
free mail and maybe become franking junkies." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported more appropriations for House members' postage.

Aid to El Salvador 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 175 to 243, the House rejected a Republican plan that was the 
softer of two proposed cuts in U.S. military aid to the rightist government of 
El Salvador. The GOP proposal would have cut 25% from the Administration's 
fiscal 1990 aid request of $85 million if leftist rebels in the Salvadoran 
civil war took certain steps toward peace and other conditions were met. 
</P>
<P>
The House then approved a Democratic plan to halve the $85 million. But that 
50% cut was later voided, clearing the way for El Salvador to receive the full 
$85 million. The foreign aid bill under debate was HR 4636. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor William S. Broomfield (R-Mich.) called his amendment "a measured and 
balanced approach to the situation in El Salvador." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica) said the amendment dealt too lightly with 
human rights abuses by Salvadoran soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was for the softer of two proposed cuts in military aid to El 
Salvador.

Rights of the Disabled 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 148 to 266, the House refused to exempt communities of less than 
200,000 population from a requirement that virtually all newly acquired 
municipal buses in America be equipped with wheelchair lifts. Affected cities 
and towns could have gained the exemption by providing special transportation 
approved of in advance by the local disabled community. 
</P>
<P>
The vote occurred as the House sent to conference with the Senate a measure (HR 
2273) to protect the rights of the disabled at work and in their use of public 
accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Don J. Pease (D-Ohio) said the wheelchair-lift requirement works a 
financial hardship on struggling transit systems in smaller communities. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Norman Y. Mineta (D-San Jose) said, "A civil right to equal 
transportation does not diminish according to a city's population." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported the exemption for smaller communities.

HOWARD, DAVIS PREPARE FOR TOUGH RUNOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Simi Valley City Council members Vicky Howard and Bill Davis, who will face 
each other in November for the 4th District county supervisor seat, predicted 
Wednesday that their campaigns will be more hard-fought than during the 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
Howard and Davis emerged from a field of five candidates in Tuesday's election 
to qualify for the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be an easy race for either one of us," said Davis, who 
expressed concern about the wide margin of votes that Howard, his council 
colleague and neighbor, received Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Davis received 25.4% of the vote, while Howard received 39.6%, according to 
tallies released Wednesday by the Ventura County registrar's office. 
Challengers Glen Schmidt received 12.8%, Harold Fick 10.3% and Tom Ely 6.7%. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little disappointed in the numbers," Davis said. "The numbers tell me 
I've got to go out there and work harder." 
</P>
<P>
Davis vowed during the next five months to visit 20,000 homes in the 4th 
District, which includes Simi Valley, Moorpark, Somis and the Santa Clara 
Valley. He said he also hopes to raise $100,000, about twice the amount he 
raised for the primary, to operate a large phone bank and to buy more 
advertising to challenge Howard in November. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, 62, said he and his supporters plan to wait a couple of weeks before 
officially kicking off the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Howard said she is already working on her campaign for the November 
election. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not taking any time off," said Howard, who spent Wednesday morning talking 
with her supporters about her strategy for the next few months. "We're going to 
have a campaign meeting on Friday to put together an analysis of the voter 
turnout." 
</P>
<P>
Although Howard said she will reorganize her campaign to some extent, she 
declined to reveal details. 
</P>
<P>
Howard, 55, said she is encouraged by her strong showing Tuesday. "It's kind of 
a vote of confidence for what I've been doing over the years," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the candidates have taken similar positions on a number of issues -- 
both agree on the need to reduce traffic, conserve water and provide more 
affordable housing in the southeast county district -- Howard said her 
experience sets her apart from Davis. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to serving on the council for eight years, Howard said, she serves 
on a number of county committees and organizations. 
</P>
<P>
As the city's representative on the county's Transportation Commission, she 
said she played an instrumental role in getting emergency call boxes installed 
on the Simi Valley Freeway. She also worked closely with Rep. Elton Gallegly 
(R-Simi Valley) to get extra lanes built on both sides of the freeway through 
the Santa Susana Pass, she said. 
</P>
<P>
While Davis acknowledges a debt to Howard for getting him involved in politics 
-- she recommended him for a seat on the Planning Commission in 1985 and 
supported his appointment to the City Council in 1986 -- he says he has 
accomplished more in his 3 1/2 years on the council than Howard has in the last 
eight. 
</P>
<P>
He listed some of those accomplishments as getting the city to start a 
rent-subsidy program for low-income senior citizens and co-authoring a ballot 
measure -- overwhelmingly approved by voters Tuesday -- that calls for amending 
the city's growth-control ordinance to allow more development of affordable 
housing for the elderly.

NEWHALL DOCTOR PLEADS INNOCENT TO CHARGES OF OVERPRESCRIBING DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Newhall doctor accused of overprescribing painkillers to patients who said 
they subsequently became addicted pleaded innocent Wednesday to 10 felony 
counts of furnishing controlled substances. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sandra Soho, 47, allegedly made out prescriptions for codeine-fortified 
painkillers without giving patients thorough examinations to determine if the 
drugs were necessary. 
</P>
<P>
One patient told Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators that she received 
prescriptions for 4,300 painkillers in a year, while others said they received 
from 1,650 to 3,600 tablets over periods ranging from 3 1/2 to 5 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
Soho, who was Dr. Stanley Soho until a 1986 sex-change operation, entered the 
pleas during an arraignment in Newhall Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
The physician refused to answer reporters' questions following the brief 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Her attorney, Thomas F. Kascoutas, also declined to comment, saying that he did 
not want to reveal his defense strategy to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary hearing was scheduled for July 30 in Newhall Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Soho, who lives in Hollywood, was arrested April 17 after two patients 
complained to sheriff's narcotics investigators that they had become addicted 
to drugs she had prescribed. 
</P>
<P>
One of the patients said she went to the doctor seeking relief from headaches 
and back pain but was given a prescription for 100 codeine painkillers after a 
rudimentary examination. 
</P>
<P>
She soon began taking the pills "to help her get through the day," according to 
a sheriff's report filed with court papers. 
</P>
<P>
Soho was barred from practicing medicine from 1981 to 1984 after state medical 
examiners found her conduct incompetent and corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
She later purchased the practice of Dr. Milos Klvana, a home birthing advocate, 
who was sentenced in February to 53 years to life on charges that he had killed 
eight infants and a fetus.

U.S. EXPLORATION OF MARS AND SEARCH FOR NATIONAL PURPOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As an out-of-state attendee at the International Space Development Conference 
in Anaheim, I was interested to read the four letters of outrage concerning 
President Bush's Moon/Mars initiative (May 26). 
</P>
<P>
The space program produces spinoffs useful to the solution of earthly problems 
at roughly $14 for every dollar invested in it. 
</P>
<P>
Also, an "improbable" goal -- such as President Kennedy's man on the Moon 
within a decade -- pursued actively produces a desire, a "can do" attitude, on 
the part of ordinary folk to start working to solve their problems instead of 
drowning them in drugs and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
We need a great, difficult, imaginative project to pull us together, show us 
how to look beyond the ends of our noses. Only a space-related initiative has 
that capability.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INNOCENT PLEA IN MOLESTATION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A part-time Harbor College karate instructor pleaded not guilty Wednesday to 
charges that he molested two preteen students after taking the girls from a 
classroom on the pretext of filming a defense movie for children. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis Calliham, 31, of Wilmington faces five counts of committing lewd acts on 
a child, said Detective Michael Jacobellis of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Sexually Exploited Child Unit. 
</P>
<P>
Calliham was arrested Friday and released Wednesday on $25,000 bail. He faces a 
preliminary hearing June 18. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobellis said police began investigating Calliham's actions after the mother 
of one of the students, an 11-year-old girl who lives on the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula, complained to Harbor College officials about him. 
</P>
<P>
The mother said that Calliham had asked her daughter to join a group of 
students at a Redondo Beach karate studio for the filming of a movie but that 
the girl said she was the only student present. 
</P>
<P>
College officials relayed the complaint to a Harbor Division detective, who 
remembered that Calliham had been the subject of a similar complaint two years 
ago involving a 7-year-old Wilmington girl. No charges were filed in that case. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators questioned the 11-year-old, who said Calliham had forced her to 
masturbate him. Police then talked to other students in Calliham's classes, 
including a 10-year-old Wilmington girl who reported a similar incident.

JUDGE WON'T ORDER OFFICIALS TO OK RAZING OF SHOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge refused Wednesday to order Los Angeles city building officials to issue 
a demolition permit to a developer trying to begin construction of an 
85,000-square-foot commercial project before the proposed Ventura Boulevard 
specific plan can curtail it. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski's refusal to order issuance of the permit 
to Jama Enterprises, Inc. -- owner of a block-long strip of one-story stores in 
Sherman Oaks that included the popular Scene of the Crime Bookstore -- was 
hailed as a victory by Tom Grant, a director of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But Zebrowski also invited Jama's attorneys to provide him with proof that the 
city Building Department is delaying its review of the project for political 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Zebrowski earlier this year sharply attacked the Los Angeles City Council for 
using its land-use powers for political purposes in a case involving a proposed 
development on the site of a Studio City carwash. Homeowners opposed to the 
development asked the city to declare the 1950s carwash a cultural monument to 
delay its demolition. Zebrowski's caustic ruling cleared the way for the Studio 
City project to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Jama wants to raze the empty stores to make way for a 3-story, $20-million 
retail-commercial complex. At stake ultimately is whether Jama will be able to 
begin work on the project in time to avoid the growth-cutting effects of the 
proposed Ventura Boulevard specific plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura Boulevard plan, as presently proposed, would reduce the allowable 
size of the Jama project by about one-third, from 85,000 square feet to 53,000 
square feet and from three to two stories. The council is expected to approve 
the plan, in some form, by early fall. 
</P>
<P>
Jama attorney Benjamin Reznik argued in court that it was unreasonable for the 
city to deny the demolition permit until completion of an environmental review 
now being conducted by the city's Building and Safety Department. 
</P>
<P>
But Zebrowski agreed with Deputy City Atty. Susan Pfann that withholding the 
demolition permit served a legitimate land-use policy. If the assessment 
concludes that a full environmental impact report is required, the EIR would 
have to compare the effects of the developer's project with those of retaining 
the existing buildings. If the buildings were demolished, such a comparison 
would be meaningless, Pfann argued. 
</P>
<P>
Reznik said in an interview that his client is seeking to get the project under 
construction before the Ventura Boulevard plan takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney also claimed that the Building Department is dragging its feet on 
reviewing Jama's environmental assessment document to satisfy what he said is 
Councilman Michael Woo's politically inspired desire to see the project limited 
by the Ventura Boulevard plan. The proposed project is in Woo's district. 
</P>
<P>
But Grant, the homeowners representative, said Jama's own failure to provide 
the city with adequate environmental documents caused the delays. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a top Building Department official predicted that his agency will 
order Jama to file a full environmental impact report. "This is a controversial 
one, and Councilman Woo wants a full EIR," assistant department chief Tim 
Taylor said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Reznik said Taylor's remarks only bolstered his conviction that the Building 
Department's review of Jama's project is being handled in a political fashion. 
The city cannot determine if a full report is needed until the environmental 
assessment is completed, Reznik said.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CRUISING RESTRICTIONS ADOPTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Esplanade will be two lanes in Redondo Beach and no-parking hours will be 
expanded on the street's west side under a new set of restrictions adopted by 
the City Council on Tuesday in an attempt to curb teen-age cruising. 
</P>
<P>
The measures -- drafted in response to a barrage of complaints about noise and 
congestion on weekends and evenings along the popular seaside thoroughfare -- 
had been informally approved earlier this month in one of two special traffic 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
They take effect immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new regulations, parking will be prohibited an hour earlier on the 
west side of the street, extending from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, road crews will restripe the four-lane street to two lanes, 
adding a bicycle lane in each direction, from Topaz Street to Vista del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Police have already launched a continuing crackdown on boom-box stereos in the 
area, warning that drivers whose sound systems are audible beyond 50 feet will 
be cited for moving violations and will risk the confiscation of their stereos 
as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, however, the council postponed action on a proposal to ban 
cruising in the area outright. Police have argued that such an ordinance would 
be expensive to enforce because of the manpower it would require.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOMEOWNERS ESCALATE FIGHT OVER COURT SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of Chatsworth homeowner groups said Wednesday that they are 
intensifying their fight against a Los Angeles County proposal to build a 
courthouse in their neighborhood, planning appearances on radio and television 
shows as well as using petition and letter-writing campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The group unveiled a 12-foot-long, 1,000-signature petition demanding that 
county officials look elsewhere for a Municipal Court site. 
</P>
<P>
As part of their increasingly aggressive campaign to prevent the Los Angeles 
Municipal Court from building an 18-courtroom facility on the southeast corner 
of Winnetka Avenue and Plummer Street, the homeowners plan to produce an 
informational cable television program and scheduled an appearance on a radio 
talk show. 
</P>
<P>
The group is also attempting to garner support from San Fernando Valley 
chambers of commerce and intends to mail a questionnaire to 600 residents to 
determine their opinions on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Court officials are expected to present their plans for a West Valley 
courthouse, of three or four stories, to the Board of Supervisors within a 
month. Court officials have said they selected the Winnetka site because it was 
the most accessible to West Valley residents. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners, however, contend that such a facility is ill-suited for the area 
because it faces single-family homes, and they fear that it will bring crime 
and increased traffic to their neighborhood, lowering property values. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson, who opposed the courthouse 
site selection, told homeowners Wednesday that Bernson would consider asking 
the city attorney to sue the county over land-use issues if the proposal is 
adopted.

1 DEAD, 1 WOUNDED IN TROLLEY STOP SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Texas woman allegedly shot and wounded her boyfriend and then killed herself 
at an El Cajon trolley center Wednesday evening, El Cajon police said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman took a .25-caliber pistol from her purse after arguing with Rodolfo 
Chavana Jr., 26, according to Lt. Bob Lein of the El Cajon Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Lein said Chavana apparently wanted to break up with the woman and took her to 
the train station so she would return to San Antonio. Lein said the woman 
allegedly fired several shots, two of which struck Chavana, who lives in the 
200 block of Cottonwood Drive in Santee. 
</P>
<P>
Police are not releasing the name of the woman until her family is notified. 
</P>
<P>
Chavana was shot twice once in the back of the neck and the other shot entered 
his cheek, Lein said. Chavana was apparently escorting Ramos to the trolley 
center but was not planning to board the trolley, Lein said. 
</P>
<P>
After shooting at Chavana, the woman placed the gun in her mouth and pulled the 
trigger. She was pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred at 250 S. Marshall Avenue at about 6:50 p.m. There were 
seven witnesses to the shooting, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"There were people waiting for the trolley and cars in the street. Shots were 
being fired as Chavana was on the run and traffic was driving by," Lein said. 
"It was very fortunate that no one else was hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Chavana was taken to Sharp Memorial Hospital, where he was listed in serious 
but stable condition, nursing supervisor Melanie Bruce said.

CITY CLERK NULLIFIES RECALL EFFORT IN INGLEWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recall effort launched last month against Inglewood City Councilman Garland 
Hardeman has been declared void because the petitioners failed to meet their 
first deadline, city officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Hermanita Harris said supporters did not meet the May 18 deadline 
for submitting a sample petition to her office and showing proof that the 
recall was advertised in a local newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Hardeman, elected last October to represent the 4th District, called the recall 
effort "a frustrated attempt to try to embarrass me" organized by a small group 
of political opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Notice of intent to recall was filed in early May by Richard Kaufman. 
Proponents were listed as Mamie Moore, Charles Moore, Viola Grahame, Donald 
Robinson and Peggy Robinson. None of the petitioners could be reached for 
comment Wednesday.

NO EXCUSE FOR SHOOTING DOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many of the people sending in letters recently about the postman shooting the 
dog that was supposedly attacking him either have not been following the case 
very closely or have selective memories. The letter of John Gensley of 
Calabasas on May 17 comes to mind. 
</P>
<P>
While I agree that the court sentence was excessive, no one has a right to 
simply walk up and shoot an animal. Gensley conveniently forgets that the 
postman never filed formal complaints against the dog's owners. He claims that 
he made complaints, but none were on record. The dog was also in its own front 
yard, not running loose. The autopsy also showed the dog was shot from behind, 
hardly an attack posture. Gensley also seems to be one of those who feel people 
have a right to carry weapons illegally in order to indulge their vigilantist 
whims. And speaking of children as victims, what about the little boy whose pet 
was shot before his eyes?

FIREMAN'S DISPUTE OVER HIS DEMOTION DRAGS OUT 7 MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To hear his attorney tell it, Hawthorne firefighter Dennis Patriquin is a hero 
who, like Julius Caesar, was betrayed by a band of conspirators who were 
jealous of his popularity and ambition. 
</P>
<P>
But in the view of Hawthorne's city attorney, Patriquin is nothing more than a 
disgruntled employee who lost his promotion because he was emotionally 
unstable, couldn't get along with his peers and failed to follow orders. 
</P>
<P>
Those conflicting images of Patriquin, 45, were painted recently during final 
arguments before the five-member Civil Service Commission, which will decide 
whether the Fire Department was justified in revoking Patriquin's probationary 
promotion to engineer in September, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's decision, expected to be made public by June 14, will end a 
7-month-long Fire Department personnel hearing that has been unprecedented for 
its scope, length and number of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairman Les Wixon took note of that, saying that since the hearing 
began, those gathered had grown to be "almost like a family. Thank you, and if 
we see each other again, I hope it's over coffee." 
</P>
<P>
The hearing was ordered by a Superior Court judge after Patriquin sued the 
city, the Fire Department and its top officers, seeking punitive and 
compensatory damages. He claimed that the department demoted him for 
participating in city politics. The judge ordered the Civil Service Commission 
to hear Patriquin's complaints, which it twice had refused to do, before the 
lawsuit could proceed. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, Patriquin said he was demoted because he gave City 
Councilwoman Ginny Lambert information about overtime pay and departmental 
expenditures. He said he was punished simply for exercising his First Amendment 
right to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
The documents, both sides agree, were leaked during a time when the city was 
embroiled in a debate over dismantling the Fire Department and contracting with 
the county for fire services. Lambert favored a study to determine whether 
contracting for fire services would be more economical for the city. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawthorne Fire Department opposed the idea, and the council eventually 
voted 3 to 2 against the study. 
</P>
<P>
The politically divisive issue stirred strong emotions in the community. During 
an internal investigation by the Fire Department, Patriquin admitted that he 
had leaked information to Lambert partly in an attempt to block the promotion 
of Fire Chief Roger Milstead. He received a written reprimand. 
</P>
<P>
Although that was supposed to be the end of it, knowledge of Patriquin's 
actions spread among his colleagues. There were death threats against him and a 
dead animal was left in Lambert's front yard, according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Urged to take a brief leave of absence in August, 1987, Patriquin returned to 
work to find that he had failed his one-year probation as an engineer. At one 
point, he said he told Milstead that his demotion caused him to feel suicidal. 
</P>
<P>
In a closing speech that compared Patriquin to Caesar and John F. Kennedy and 
made references to Ray Bradbury's novel about censorship and thought-control, 
"Fahrenheit 451," attorney Robert Swensen told the commissioners that Patriquin 
was clearly victimized for exercising his right to free speech.

BRODERICK TRIAL MOVED AGAIN, FROM VISTA BACK TO S.D. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The murder trial of Elisabeth (Betty) Broderick was moved Wednesday for the 
second time -- from Vista back to San Diego -- but a Vista judge remains the 
trial judge. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick, 42, of La Jolla, is charged with killing her ex-husband, Daniel 
Broderick III, 44, a prominent medical malpractice lawyer, and his new wife, 
Linda, 28, on Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
The case was moved to Vista Superior Court on May 16 after Broderick's 
attorney, Jack Earley, had said he would challenge the right of all San Diego 
Superior Court judges to hear the case because of the prominence of Daniel 
Broderick, who was a former president of the local bar association. 
</P>
<P>
After the case was assigned to Vista Judge Franklin Mitchell Jr., Earley said 
he did not want Broderick tried in Vista and preferred San Diego of the two 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, San Diego Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez granted a joint 
motion from both the prosecution and defense to return the trial to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, who was the judge who transferred it to Vista, kept Mitchell on as 
trial judge. 
</P>
<P>
However, Earley said late Wednesday that he has filed a motion to keep Mitchell 
from taking the case. No date has been set for hearing the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The trial date of Sept. 18 will remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mitchell will hear pretrial motions in Vista. He will travel to 
downtown San Diego when the trial begins, if he remains the judge on the case. 
</P>
<P>
Earley said one reason he prefers San Diego to Vista is that the witnesses are 
in San Diego. He also said potential jurors in North County have different 
lifestyles than in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel and Linda Broderick were found shot to death in their bedroom. The 
slayings are believed to have occurred at 5:30 a.m. while they slept.

S.D. TOP DONOR IN WORLDWIDE BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego residents gave more money to an international benefit for children's 
hospitals than any other city, a spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego contributed more than $2.5 million of the $89.4 million raised during 
the Children's Miracle Network Telethon, said Mark Morelli, a spokesman for San 
Diego Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The two-day telethon held at Disneyland last weekend was beamed via satellite 
to 180 cities in the United States, Canada and the Soviet Union. The eighth 
annual fund-raiser was sponsored by the Osmond Foundation in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
The more than $2.5 million raised in San Diego will go to Children's Hospital, 
the pediatric trauma center for all of San Diego, Morelli said. 
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to purchase a $32,000 vital-signs monitor and child-size 
anesthesia equipment, as well as fund community programs such as safe-sitter 
instruction and CPR classes, he said.

OCEANSIDE TRANSIENT CONVICTED OF KILLING GIRLFRIEND'S MOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 24-year-old Oceanside transient was convicted Wednesday of the first-degree 
murder of his girlfriend's mother in October, 1988, and now faces either the 
death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
The Vista Superior Court jury deliberated two days and decided that Kurt 
Michaels murdered JoAnn Clemons of Escondido under special circumstances: lying 
in wait, for financial gain and during the commission of a robbery or burglary. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was asleep in her apartment at the time she was stabbed to death. 
</P>
<P>
The jury will return to Superior Court Judge J. Morgan Lester's courtroom 
Monday to begin the penalty phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor alleged that Michaels killed the 41-year-old woman so her 
daughter could collect her life insurance. The jury agreed, and also convicted 
Michaels of both burglary and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Michaels, a former Marine who served as his own attorney but had the help of an 
assisting attorney, admitted he killed Clemons -- but argued that it was to 
prevent the woman's continued physical and sexual abuse of her daughter, 
Christine. The younger woman backed up Michaels' story in her testimony. 
</P>
<P>
But Michaels insisted he is not a candidate for the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a gag order, neither Michaels' assisting attorney, Mark Chambers, 
nor the prosecutor, Jeff Brodrick, would discuss the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
For her role in the killing, Christine Clemons, 18, pleaded guilty to 
second-degree murder and was put in the custody of the California Youth 
Authority until she turns 25. 
</P>
<P>
A third defendant in the case, 20-year-old Darren Popik, was convicted in 
December of first-degree murder for his part in the slaying and was sentenced 
to life in prison without possibility of parole.

CSUN AWAITING DECISION ON CONFERENCE TRIP

<P>
A meeting today between the president and the athletic director of Cal State 
Sacramento could go a long way toward determining whether Cal State Northridge 
will become a member of the proposed American Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hiegert, Northridge athletic director, said Wednesday that if Sacramento 
decides to take part in a planning meeting in Marco Island, Fla., on Sunday, he 
also likely will attend. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Northridge President James W. Cleary on Wednesday, Hiegert 
said, "I think (Cleary) is curious to see what Sacramento is going to do." 
</P>
<P>
United States International University, Southern Utah State, Northeastern 
Illinois and Chicago State reportedly are prepared to join the American 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The addition of Northridge and Sacramento would give the conference six teams, 
the minimum required by the NCAA in Division I.

BURBANK'S NEIL LASHKARI AND TEAMMATES ON LONGSHOT U.S. CRICKET TEAM JOURNEY TO 
EUROPE IN BID TO QUALIFY FOR 1991 WORLD CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Considering the United States' apathy toward cricket -- a sport so ignored it 
hasn't even had a drug scandal in this country -- nobody should be surprised to 
learn that not one player on the U.S. national team was born in the U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Lashkari of Burbank, however, came close. 
</P>
<P>
Born 31 years ago in Leeds, England, Lashkari moved with his family to Southern 
California when he was only 6 months old. His U.S. upbringing gives him the 
distinction of being the only American-bred player on the national team, which 
is taking part in the World Cup qualifying tournament this month in the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, a third-rate cricket power, is one of 19 teams entered in 
the qualifier, called the "mini" World Cup. Only the winner -- Zimbabwe is 
considered the favorite -- will be allowed to play in the big tournament next 
year in Australia, where England, India and the West Indies will be among the 
nine cricket superpowers trading googleys (a ball delivered by a bowler that 
appears to be going to break one way but breaks the other way when it hits the 
ground). The United States has never qualified for the quadrennial event. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. cricket is played primarily on the East Coast -- the governing body of the 
sport, the U.S. Cricket Assn., is in Philadelphia -- and the U.S. national team 
is made up almost entirely of West Indians from Eastern amateur teams. Only two 
California players were picked: Lashkari and bowler Terry Mills, a 27-year-old 
Trinidad native who lives in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
John Reid is the most recent American-born player to have made a U.S. national 
team. Reid played on the 1982 squad and might have made this year's team had he 
not looked terrible during tryouts. "In baseball terms, I went oh for four," 
says Reid, 32, who lives in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
That the Valley area produced both Reid and Lashkari is due more to genetics 
than geography. Their foreign-born fathers were international cricketers who 
moved to L.A. in the late '50s. Anil Lashkari, who played for India's national 
teams, and Jim Reid, an English pro, met while playing cricket at Griffith Park 
and became best friends. Jim, a 59-year-old real estate appraiser, is also a 
former president of the U.S. Cricket Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The two boys "grew up together," John says. "We're like brothers." It was only 
natural for them to play cricket. "Neil's father coached him and my father 
coached me and we had the desire" is John's explanation for their development 
into international cricket players instead of mall rats. 
</P>
<P>
"Neil and I are extremely unique," Reid says, because Americans "don't usually 
progress beyond league level." 
</P>
<P>
Reid and Lashkari also improved their cricket skills by playing in England 
during summer vacations from Valley College. Both dreamed of eventually playing 
professionally, but reality woke them up, Lashkari explains, "when we found out 
it wasn't our life style." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no glamour in it," Reid says. "Eight guys in a flat. Living out of a 
suitcase. I thought it would be pretty posh, but it was just the opposite." 
</P>
<P>
"Unless you're a top pro," Lashkari says, "there's just no money in cricket." 
</P>
<P>
"Both of us felt we could do better back home," adds Reid, who, along with 
Lashkari, became a real estate appraiser like Jim Reid. 
</P>
<P>
Neil and John are standing on the roped-off cricket field at Sepulveda Basin. 
Even though it has no Little League or high school cricket programs, the Valley 
is hardly a cricket wasteland. The Southern California Cricket Assn. plays a 
competitive nine-month season at Sepulveda Basin, and the field, Reid says, is 
considered the best in the country. 
</P>
<P>
A cricket field has no set dimensions; it may be oval or circular but must be 
limited to a maximum of 75 yards in any direction from its center. At Sepulveda 
Basin, in the center of the field, is a square of manicured grass, about 25 
yards on each side, with wicket creases limed into each corner. Thus the pitch 
-- a strip 66 feet long and 10 feet wide -- can be rotated when each side of 
the square becomes worn. 
</P>
<P>
Reid and Lashkari, who play for University Cricket Club, are at the basin to 
practice. Only games are played on the field, so a backstop is set up and 
artificial turf is rolled out to give the bowler an even surface off which to 
bounce the ball. About a dozen players participate in the practice. Bowlers 
take turns bowling and batters take a few licks. Several players warm up doing 
the cricket version of pepper. 
</P>
<P>
A left-handed batter, Lashkari is trying to work on his timing before he 
departs the Netherlands. Reid provides a scouting report on him. "Neil is very 
sound defensively," Reid says, meaning that he's adept at protecting the wicket 
with his bat. "He gets in line and builds his innings." Translation: Lashkari 
steps into the ball and scores a lot of runs. 
</P>
<P>
Lashkari stands in front of the wicket wearing thick leg pads and a face mask. 
It becomes obvious why he needs protection. Bowlers take a running start and 
uncork the hard leather ball from some 22 yards away. A spinning overhand can 
come in at 100 m.p.h., hitting the turf at the batter's feet and skipping 
unpredictably like a one-hop smash to third base. 
</P>
<P>
Lashkari takes about 30 swings, protecting the stumps -- each time. When 
Lashkari finishes, sweat trickles off his brow. 
</P>
<P>
"Cricket is a little harder to play than baseball because you have to hit the 
ball off the bounce 99% of the time," Lashkari says. 
</P>
<P>
Lashkari played baseball at Burbank High and admits that he "probably should 
have stayed with" the sport. His friends, he says, never teased him about 
cricket and "were quite intrigued by it." Occasionally, his friends would watch 
him play but they had difficulty understanding the odd terminology and rules. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, cricket is an alien experience for the uninitiated. A game at the basin 
over Memorial Day weekend seems to proceed in slow motion, with players doing a 
lot of standing around on the field in their all-white uniforms. A problem 
Americans have with cricket: A game lasts all day, at least. And spectators 
have to sit or stand some 100 yards from the square, making it very difficult 
to pick up the ball as it is bowled. 
</P>
<P>
"Explaining the game to someone is hard," Lashkari says. "The best way is to 
show how it's played." 
</P>
<P>
In brief, it is a contest played between two teams of 11 players each. The 
object of the game is to score runs when at bat and to put out, or dismiss, the 
opposing batsmen when in the field. Each side has two innings, normally taken 
alternately. 
</P>
<P>
Matches are played for a predetermined length of time, and often two days or 
more are required to finish. (A team at bat might accumulate as many as 300 to 
400 runs before all of its players are retired.) 
</P>
<P>
Lashkari figures he can play competitively for an additional 10 years. His 
father, a 55-year-old chemical engineer, played into his 40s and even was 
playing captain of the '79 U.S. national team. That team was also notable for 
having Jim Reid as manager and Neil and John as players. But it didn't emerge 
from the qualifier, a fate that likely will befall the current squad. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been mentioned as one of six teams that could possibly do well," says 
Lashkari, playing on his fourth U.S. national team. "Personally, I think our 
chances are average."

TENNIS: DRILL HELPS UNIVERSITY TEAM POST 6-4, 6-4 VICTORY IN DOUBLES 
CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH.

<P>
Although he has coached tennis at University High for 20 seasons, Tom Anderson 
is not above tinkering with his training techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it was a last-minute adjustment by Anderson that helped lift 
University's Lucas Goldstein and Sung Kim to their first doubles title 
Wednesday in the City Section Individual Tennis Championships at the Racquet 
Centre of Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
Kim and Goldstein defeated Josh Etting and Che Naveja of Kennedy, 6-4, 6-4, to 
claim the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Kim's service returns, Anderson reasoned, would play a large role in the 
outcome of the match. Kim, a sophomore, was plagued by erratic returns earlier 
in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
In a practice session Tuesday, Anderson suspended a 2 1/2 x 4-foot metal frame 
from a clothes rack and placed it across the net from Kim. For an hour, Kim 
aimed his service returns at the hanging target. The drill was akin to a 
quarterback's passing a football through a car tire. 
</P>
<P>
The method worked. During Wednesday's match, Kim told Anderson, "I'm seeing the 
(practice) box." Most of his returns were precise, relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a visualization that was important," Anderson said. "In high school 
tennis, if you don't get your serves and returns in, you're dead." 
</P>
<P>
A point to which Etting and Naveja will attest. Naveja, in particular, had 
problems with serves, double-faulting nine times, including the final point of 
the match. 
</P>
<P>
"I sensed a feeling of urgency," Naveja said. "As soon as they got close, all 
the pressure was put on us. A feeling of desperation. 
</P>
<P>
"Going from one level to the next in two days is really shocking." 
</P>
<P>
Fifth-seeded Naveja and Etting, who finished the regular season 17-1, advanced 
to the finals Monday by upsetting the top-seeded team, Sanjay Srinivasan and 
Jon Faller of Palisades. That momentum continued in the championship match as 
Naveja and Etting took 2-0 and 3-1 leads in the first set. Goldstein and Kim, 
19-0 in the regular season, then surged. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were going strong in the first set," Etting said. "We lost a few 
crucial deuce points and never got back into it." 
</P>
<P>
Brothers Nam and Long Nguyen of Cleveland did recover in the third-place match. 
After losing to Goldstein and Kim in the semifinals, the Nguyens defeated 
Srinivasan and Faller, 7-5, 5-7, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't competing for first anymore so we relaxed and played our game," 
said Long, who played No. 1 singles during the regular season. "It's not No. 1, 
but it's good enough."

THE WONDER FROM DOWN UNDER;

<P>
AUSTRALIAN SOFTBALL PLAYER KERRY DIENELT FINDS A HOME AT UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Women softball players come from far and near to play for UCLA Coach Sharron 
Backus, but infielder Kerry Dienelt probably holds the record for having come 
the farthest. 
</P>
<P>
Dienelt, who has played for UCLA teams that have won three consecutive NCAA 
titles, is a native of Darwin, Australia, located in the province of the 
Northern Territories. The town has a population of about 17,000 and is far from 
Australia's population centers of Sydney and Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
Under Backus, UCLA has won six of nine national softball titles that have been 
under the auspices of the NCAA, and many players are attracted to the school 
because of the team's reputation as a softball power. 
</P>
<P>
But Dienelt (pronounced DYE-knelt) came to UCLA almost by accident. She was 
first discovered not by Backus, but by former Stanford Coach Tammy Brown, now 
the coach at the University of Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Brown saw Dienelt play with the Australian women's national team in 1986 at an 
international tournament in Vancouver, British Columbia. She soon realized that 
the 5-foot, 10-inch Aussie had rare talent. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who was between jobs since Stanford had dropped women's softball, was 
unable to recruit Dienelt and recommended the first baseman to Backus. 
</P>
<P>
When Dienelt returned home from the tournament, she sent Backus a copy of the 
only videotape ever made of her playing softball. She also sent along academic 
transcripts from her secondary school, Dripstone. 
</P>
<P>
Backus liked what she saw on the video and said to herself, "Hey. This kid's 
terrific." She offered Dienelt a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Dienelt was happy to accept the scholarship and make the journey to Los 
Angeles, although she would be thousands of miles from her home, family and 
friends. "I always wanted to play softball in America," she said. "I did not 
have a clue about college or what they were like." 
</P>
<P>
She soon became clued in to life, the curriculum and softball at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really know anything about UCLA's national championships when I first 
came here," she said. But being on three Bruin NCAA winners "was really an 
honor and I'll be looking out for a fourth one too." 
</P>
<P>
For Dienelt, the transition from Australian to American softball was not easy. 
As a freshman, she had only a .206 batting average, and her average dropped to 
.179 last year. 
</P>
<P>
But she hit .304 this year, fourth-best on the team, and in each of her three 
College World Series appearances she was named to the all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
In this year's NCAA championship game, Dienelt had two hits and drove in a run 
to help the Bruins to a 2-0 victory over Fresno State. "She's a money player," 
Backus said. "She talks softly, but she carries a big stick." 
</P>
<P>
Dienelt will play for the Australian national team in an international 
tournament in July at Normal, Ill., and UCLA All-American senior Lisa Longaker 
and standout freshman Lisa Fernandez will be pitching for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Dienelt is eager to play against her Bruin teammates. "I'll throw the bat at 
the ball to get a hit if I have to," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A first baseman for most of her three seasons at UCLA, Dienelt also filled in 
for Fernandez at third base this season when the latter was pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Dienelt said the togetherness of the Bruins makes college softball more 
rewarding than the international game, although international competition is 
tougher. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not taking anything away from representing my country, but when you play 
for Australia, you don't get to know the players because you may be together 
for only about three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the things you go through as a college team, you grow together, and 
it actually (becomes like) a family. You laugh and cry together, win and lose 
together. (College softball) is a lot more emotional." 
</P>
<P>
Dienelt is glad to have acquired her college family because she misses her own 
close-knit family. Her father is a tax collector and used to play baseball. Her 
mother still plays organized softball and she has two brothers who are baseball 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Dienelt made a visit to home during Christmas, but that she doesn't "get home 
that often. It's so expensive and so far away." 
</P>
<P>
Dienelt particularly misses the camping trips she used to take with her family 
to the outback, the wild expanse of barren land in Australia's interior, about 
an hour-and-a-half's drive from Darwin. 
</P>
<P>
Dienelt occasionally wishes that she were in the outback, trying to catch fish 
known as barramundi, or watching crocodiles sunning themselves along river 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
Dienelt, a psychology major, might settle in the United States after she 
graduates because she thinks there will be more job opportunities for her in 
America than in Australia. She might go into coaching or sports psychology. 
</P>
<P>
"In Australia, most major sports have team psychologists," she said. "They help 
athletes by teaching them proper breathing techniques or helping them deal with 
anxiety." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's season began in early February and finished May 28. The Bruins played 69 
games and won 62. 
</P>
<P>
The seasons are long, but Dienelt doesn't resent the time she spends playing 
softball. She finds she can do without the game for about two weeks after the 
season ends. After a couple of weeks, however, "I miss being out there running 
around."

HEAT PLAYS SALT LAKE CITY TO OPEN ROAD SWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Heat, in fourth place in the Southern Division of the American 
Professional Soccer League with a 4-2 record, play the Salt Lake City Sting 
Saturday at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
The game is the first of four road games in eight days for the Heat, which is 
2-0 on the road. The Heat play the Colorado Foxes Sunday, the Seattle Storm 
June 15 and the Portland Timbers June 16. 
</P>
<P>
Three teams qualify for postseason action, but because the APSL scoring system 
rewards teams that score goals, the Heat is 15 points behind front-running Real 
Santa Barbara. L.A. has scored only 11 goals, lowest in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Goalkeeper Mike Littman has kept the Heat in contention by giving up only five 
goals, the lowest total in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Heat forward Jeff Hooker, a member of the 1984 U.S. National Team that tied 
defending World Cup champion Italy, 0-0, said the United States will do well 
against Italy in their match Thursday at the World Cup. "Italy is very fast, 
very skillful and very powerful," Hooker said. For the United States to win, 
Hooker said it must utilize a man-to-man, trapping defense that "doesn't give 
Italy time to play its game."

MUSIC FESTIVAL SIGNALED SOUR NOTE OF CHAPTER 11 FOR KINGSTON HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kingston Hotel, a San Diego hostelry with a troubled past, filed for 
protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on Friday, one day 
after the opening of a Mozart music festival for which the Kingston serves as 
the title sponsor and has provided at least $35,000 in in-kind donations. 
</P>
<P>
The downtown hotel is donating the use of 30 of its 102 guest rooms for two 
weeks to out-of-state musicians who are performing through June 9 in The 
Kingston Hotel Mainly Mozart Festival at the Old Globe Theatre, said Lee 
Julien, the hotel's general partner. 
</P>
<P>
Julien said the hotel is also allowing the musicians to rehearse free in the 
Top of the Kingston, the hotel's rooftop ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
But Julien said Kingston's support for the arts, such as offering vacant rooms 
to musicians at no cost, is a good business move. Since April 1989, when 
Julien's investor group took over the reins at the Kingston Hotel, occupancy 
rate has increased from 45% to 65%. Julien said the hotel, which charges an 
average $75 a room per night, needs to reach an occupancy rate of 70% to break 
even. 
</P>
<P>
"We had empty rooms," Julien said. "Rather than just let those empty rooms sit, 
we decided to donate them to the arts community. We were more than delighted to 
do it, not just because we like supporting the arts, but the recognition we 
gain in return attracts customers." 
</P>
<P>
For the time being at least, the hotel will remain open during the bankruptcy 
proceedings, its owners said Wednesday. The Kingston is the third major 
downtown hotel -- the other two were the U.S. Grant and the Omni San Diego -- 
to file a bankruptcy petition over the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel's owners, Executive Hotel Plaza Associates partnership, purchased the 
hotel for $5.7 million in April 1989. The hotel partnership consists of general 
partners, LCC Hotels Inc. of Los Angeles and Julien/Livett Executive Associates 
of San Diego, and five limited partners. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership filed for bankruptcy Friday, just minutes before the hotel was 
to have been put on the block for a foreclosure sale, Julien said. The 
foreclosure loomed because the partnership had failed to make payments -- a 
total of $500,000 since December 1989 -- on a $4.6-million loan from Dollar Dry 
Dock Bank of New York, Julien said. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership failed to make its payments when Malcolm Kingston -- chairman 
of the board of LCC Hotels, which has majority ownership of the hotel -- 
refused to provide more funds after a dispute between the hotel's two managers 
forced Kingston to "lose confidence" in how the hotel was being run, Julien 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kingston for a time made payments on the loan out of his own pocket after the 
hotel failed to generate enough cash. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to Julien, there was "a disagreement over management style" last 
year between Laral Hotels of San Luis Obispo, the Kingston's management 
company, which set hotel operation policy, and Robert McDaniel, the hotel's 
managing director, who oversees day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
"There were several run-ins," Julien said. "For example, Laral came in and 
installed these expensive reservation computers without even telling" McDaniel. 
"McDaniel and I didn't think it was necessary. We wanted to provide our guests 
with a personal touch and wanted to do things manually. 
</P>
<P>
"Not knowing what the resolution of this conflict would be, I am assuming that 
Kingston felt uncomfortable about putting up any additional capital," Julien 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Laral Hotels resigned as the hotel's management company late last year, leaving 
McDaniel and Julien, in essence, in charge of hotel operations. But Julien said 
an official contract wasn't executed with LCC Hotels until April. He added that 
Kingston has refused to provide funds to make the bank payments since Laral 
gave up management of the property. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we got Kingston's vote of confidence (by virtue of LCC Hotels 
getting a management contract), but with no money attached, it left us high and 
dry," Julien said. "The hotel has turned around, but the turnaround is not 
complete. This hotel still needs an infusion of money." 
</P>
<P>
Once they had been designated as the hotel's official managers, Julien and 
McDaniel said they felt free to aggressively seek a new group of investors to 
raise $1.5 million -- a task Julien says is now near completion. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect within 30 days to have a written contract with this new group of 
investors," Julien said. "The only reason why we filed for bankruptcy is that 
we ran out of time. There just wasn't enough time to identify the investors and 
do all the paper work before the foreclosure sale. You can't come up with $1.5 
million in 60 days." 
</P>
<P>
Creditors contacted Wednesday expressed confidence that the Kingston Hotel will 
rebound from bankruptcy. And they said they approved of Kingston's donating 
rooms to the festival musicians. 
</P>
<P>
"They've told us that it's a temporary problem, something among the owners. . . 
. I see no reason not to believe them," said Richard Rosenblatt, chairman of 
the board of L.P.C. Media Inc., a Rancho Santa Fe-based advertising agency that 
has handled promotional work for the Kingston. "I've been watching the way they 
run the place, and I think they do it very well. I think they'll overcome this. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenblatt added, "As far as putting up the musicians, I thought it was an 
excellent way of getting the name out. As an advertising man, I can appreciate 
a good move like that." 
</P>
<P>
The hotel is also home to the 88-seat, 2,000-square-foot Kingston Playhouse, 
where The Bowery Theatre group performs. For nearly a year, the Kingston has 
allowed the theater group to perform at its facility rent-free, a facility 
Julien admits was difficult to lease. 
</P>
<P>
"The business the Playhouse attracts to our restaurant and the guests who stay 
overnight to go to the theater is amazing," Julien said. The hotel also 
features Malcolm's First Avenue, a restaurant that features regional California 
cuisine. "It brings in far more than what we could charge in rent." 
</P>
<P>
Julien said promotion of the arts has paid off for the Kingston in other ways 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
Since April 1989, when McDaniel began managing the hotel, monthly food and 
beverage sales from restaurant and banquet activities have tripled to $95,000 
from $32,000. During that same period, the average daily room rate has 
increased to $75 from $50. 
</P>
<P>
Another creditor, Kirk Jackson, executive vice president of San Diego-based 
Jackson &amp; Blanc Heating and Air Conditioning, also approved of the hotel's 
management. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see them having any problem attracting a new group of investors," 
Jackson said. "They have kept us up to date about their problems. . . . They 
have been very up front with us, and we believe they'll take care of the money 
that's owed to us and the other creditors." 
</P>
<P>
Still, despite the apparent goodwill of some of its creditors, the fact remains 
that the hotel owes $400,000 to various creditors, not including the $500,000 
in back payments owed to the New York bank. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-story hotel on 1st Avenue near Broadway, once known as the Executive 
Hotel, was built by C. Arnholt Smith as part of a two-block development. The 
development has changed ownership several times, which has often resulted in 
inconsistent management, hurting the hotel's operations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been a stepchild to the rest of the block," McDaniel said. "Every 
time the block changed hands, hotel management changed. With that kind of 
inconsistency you can't build any loyalty among your customers. And that's 
critical for us because we're a community-based hotel that depends upon repeat 
customers." 
</P>
<P>
The Kingston also offers the Camelot Club, a private membership lounge for 
hotel guests and the Cuyamaca Health Club.

ARCHITECTURE / DIRK SUTRO: BIGGEST FIRM KEEPS LOWEST OF PROFILES

<TEXT>
<P>
Even if you are familiar with San Diego architecture, you probably haven't 
heard much about the largest local architecture company. 
</P>
<P>
Yet SGPA Architecture &amp; Planning probably effects your daily life more than 
any other San Diego firm. Specializing in retailing centers, the company has 
designed more than 400 such projects since opening in 1969, including at least 
40 in San Diego. Among these are town centers in Rancho Bernardo, Rancho 
Penasquitos, Del Mar Highlands, Carmel Mountain Ranch and Rancho San Diego On 
the strength of its reputation for designing economical, financially successful 
retailing centers, the company has grown to 135 employees and $10 million in 
annual revenues, with satellite offices in San Francisco and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
But SGPA has not received a single design award during the last eight years 
from the local American Institute of Architects chapter. 
</P>
<P>
This seems to confirm the suspicion one gets, driving around San Diego, that 
most retail projects are driven by economics, not innovative architecture and 
planning. What works is replicated over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
Most of SGPA's newer shopping complexes have elements in common. Budgets 
dictate affordable stucco walls, often with simple, easy-to-build geometries, 
usually in a vaguely Mediterranean style. Tile roofs predominate: The accepted 
method of adding "authentic" regional flavor; even worse, stark 
industrial-grade metal seems to be the roofing choice for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
At the new town centers, the automobile takes precedence over the pedestrian. 
The ritual of entering the center, parking the car and finding your store of 
choice has superseded a walk down Main Street. And the fast food restaurant has 
replaced city halls and churches as the most prominent community building, with 
McDonald's leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
Critics may not always find much cause for optimism at these malls, but Mike 
LaBarre, one of 11 principals at the SGPA, stands by the company's designs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're definitely satisfied with the quality of our work," he said. "But we 
would like more recognition from the AIA. Every year we get awards from the 
retailing industry. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, the AIA awards tend to go to unusual architecture more than 
mainstream, even if the mainstream project is very well designed, has a 
positive impact on a community and has met client objectives." 
</P>
<P>
As for the difficulty of creating dignified town centers with fast food 
restaurants as their most visible elements, LaBarre hopes this will gradually 
change. 
</P>
<P>
'The McDonald's thing is a function of land development economics. McDonald's 
is the tenant willing to pay the highest price for a premier location. Until 
the shopping center conventions of today change, you're always going to see 
that." 
</P>
<P>
LaBarre and other SGPA architects blame economics for limiting forms and 
materials, putting a damper on creativity, even though other architects have 
proven, with projects such as the newest downtown single-room-occupancy hotels, 
that it is possible to make interesting, functional buildings using low-cost 
stucco construction. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we have a big challenge: how to create a positive aesthetic that 
projects quality for less dollars," LaBarre said. 
</P>
<P>
This may be an long battle with few victories. Just compare a '70s SGPA project 
like the wood-shingled Pacific Plaza on Garnet Avenue in Pacific Beach with 
such '80s stucco cousins as The Promenade on Mission Boulevard in Pacific Beach 
or North County Plaza near Highway 78 in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
Architects at SGPA, seeing the wood shingle style as a bygone sign of the '70s, 
have taken to calling such designs "woodsy goodsy." But there's no denying a 
certain warmth and charm often lacking in the larger all-stucco projects of 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the shingles, which give scale and detailing to the buildings, Pacific 
Plaza has unusually inviting landscaping: small, beachy hillocks resembling 
coastal dunes soften the impact of buildings, concrete and tile. Low wooden 
benches and tables, shaded by umbrellas and trees, provide plenty of inviting 
places to take a break. 
</P>
<P>
These days, landscaping seems a lower priority. New retail centers usually have 
several trees, but few large-scale patches of greenery. Or maybe it only seems 
that way because a good portion of the budget goes toward breaking up huge 
parking lots with landscaped islands, instead of greening the insides of the 
projects, where people spend most of their time. Today's centers also have 
benches and outdoor tables, but they generally seem to be fewer and more poorly 
shaded. 
</P>
<P>
On a hot afternoon recently at the SGPA-designed Costa Verde retailing complex 
off La Jolla Village Drive in La Jolla, expanses of unshaded tiles underfoot 
served as unintended passive solar devices, absorbing sunlight and re-emitting 
the heat, so that the temperature for shoppers was several degrees above the 
air temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe all of this is unfairly morose, but it is disturbing to see the county 
gobbled alive by dozens of these new centers. In all fairness to SGPA and other 
architects, much of the blame for the blandness rests with developers who favor 
proven formulas and tenant design demands over fresh architecture and planning, 
and consumers who worship easy auto access and fast food. 
</P>
<P>
Also in fairness to SGPA, the company has designed some excellent retailing 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
The Mercado in Rancho Bernardo, completed in 1987, replaced an earlier complex 
which had foundered financially. It's a fresh interpretation of Mediterranean 
and Spanish elements, impressive in a community already gorged on stucco and 
tile roofs. Project designer Jerry Silva is said to be a stickler for 
detailing, and this is evident in the way the carefully varied facades blend 
from one to another. Signage has been kept to a minimum, and there is a 
symbolic domed tower, so that even if commerce is the order of the day, there's 
some sense of civic pride. 
</P>
<P>
Uptown District, a new project on University Avenue in Hillcrest, may be SGPA's 
most significant breakthrough, with SGPA's mixed retail-office buildings 
merging into condominiums designed by Lorimer-Case. Parking is hidden so that 
human-scaled storefronts, designed to blend with adjacent '30s and '40s 
architecture, become the dominant image from the street. 
</P>
<P>
The people from Ralph's took a risk by situating their supermarket internally, 
so that the smaller storefronts could be nearest the street. According to 
LaBarre, the store is a financial winner. 
</P>
<P>
This well-designed mixed-use project, including retailing, residential and 
office space, could well make SGPA a role model for architects in the '90s. 
Already, this broader approach to retail development has spurred some of SGPA's 
best work.

SOCIETY: BEST OF CHEER FLOWED AT DAY OF WINE, ROSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The best place in town to buy fine vintage wines Saturday was the University of 
San Diego, which was so overstocked with the stuff that, had an earthquake 
shattered all the bottles, the campus might have come floating down off its 
hilltop. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 California wineries, which together garnered 500 bronze, silver and 
gold medals in the San Diego National Wine Competition held in May, donated a 
case of each winner to be sold at the seventh annual Wine &amp; Roses Charity 
Tasting, co-hosted at USD by the Juniors of Social Service and the local 
chapter of the California Assn. of Nurserymen. More than 60 of the wineries 
also poured at the afternoon "debut" tasting of competition winners and the 
follow-up evening event; between them, the two tastings attracted more than 800 
accomplished or budding oenophiles. 
</P>
<P>
The proceeds from the event, which co-chairwoman Vera Campbell estimated will 
exceed $40,000, will be shared by the two host organizations and will benefit 
Camp Oliver in Descanso and the nurserymen's scholarship program. 
</P>
<P>
"Putting 'Wine &amp; Roses' together was like having a baby, since I've been 
working on it for nine months," said Campbell. "But we all believe strongly in 
our charity, which makes the work enjoyable for us all." 
</P>
<P>
The work certainly looked enjoyable for the hundreds who strolled through the 
university's Camino Patio during the debut tasting, nibbling on cheese and 
pates between nips of wines from such vintners as Rabbit Ridge, Hart, Trefethen 
and Culbertson. Few braved the insistent sun to dance in the open to a band 
called Passions, but most did stop to smell the flowers -- 25 nurseries donated 
more than 2,000 potted flowering plants and shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
The university also will come up smelling like roses from the event because the 
nurseries planted dozens of these around the courtyard, where they will remain 
until Wine &amp; Roses '91, at which time they will be replaced with new 
plantings. 
</P>
<P>
The committee included Donna Vance, Roseanne Lindsay, Lorie White, Jan 
Kincannon, Carolyn Robbins, Pam Palisoul, Erminia Taranto, Suzanne Koch, Pat 
MacLaggan, Toni Welk, Julee Ault, Wendy David, Marion Jacobs, Camille Nielsen, 
Sherry Lichty and Jane Pentelei-Molnar. 
</P>
<P>
At the close of the opening-night performance of the Mainly Mozart Festival, 
the several hundred patrons were, in the main, enthusiastic but also mostly 
hungry. 
</P>
<P>
The festival directors had anticipated just such an occurrence at Thursday's 
benefit performance and arranged for several leading restaurateurs to donate 
sufficient elegant snacks and pastries to load down a circle of buffets 
arranged around the lawn of the Sculpture Garden at the San Diego Museum of 
Art. 
</P>
<P>
Guests picked up glasses of champagne en route to tables featuring such things 
as the chocolate pate brought by chef Doug Organ of the Brasserie, and the 
rather unusual pastry-wrapped mix of braised skate wings and black beans 
whipped up by Ernest Wally of Chef Wally's Bistro. 
</P>
<P>
If the guests feasted on tidbits and cakes, conductor David Atherton and the 
musicians feasted on compliments as well as more solid rations. One of the more 
lionized musicians was concertmaster William Preucil, whose violin solo in 
Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 3 had quieted even the birds that earlier had 
chattered out of time to Atherton's baton. 
</P>
<P>
Veryl Mortenson organized the open-air reception and declared herself delighted 
with the turnout, although she added that she was amazed there had been any 
empty seats in the Old Globe Theatre's Lowell Davies Festival Stage. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought there would be people standing in the streets. Even the local 
restaurateurs showed their faith in us by donating all this food," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Worley and Blaine Quick, president and chairman of the Mainly Mozart 
board, both expressed the belief that the festival will become a San Diego 
cultural fixture. 
</P>
<P>
"After all the anticipation and waiting, tonight's performance seemed to be 
over so quickly," said Worley. "But it was wonderful and so gratifying to see 
so big a crowd -- the crowd is what we've all worked for -- and I think we're 
an established part of the performing arts scene now that we're in our second 
year." 
</P>
<P>
"This festival absolutely adds to the cultural dimensions of San Diego, and it 
will more and more in years to come," said Quick. 
</P>
<P>
Most major festival patrons attended the opening-night performance and 
reception, including Lee Julien and Robert McDaniel of the festival's title 
sponsor, the Kingston Hotel; the pair made a brief appearance at the reception 
before returning to their hotel, which declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy the 
following day. 
</P>
<P>
Among others in attendance were Hermann and Trude Zillgens, Damon and Carolyn 
Siskin, Joyce Dennis with Joe Abrahamson, Joe Merante, Don Capener, D'Neane 
Wilkinson, Robert and Bea Epsten, Donald McVay, Gary and Nancy Laturno, Chuck 
Weghorst, Erich Steinbock, Connie Smith, Eleanor Roth, Jeffry and Sandra 
Schafer, and Marsha Sewell and Mike Shea. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Connick Jr., the 23 year-old pianist and crooner who has been discussed 
as the next Frank Sinatra (Sinatra's opinion is unknown), was announced Friday 
as the star of the second annual "Monday Night Live" gala benefit for the La 
Jolla Playhouse, to be given July 16 at the playhouse's quarters on the UC San 
Diego campus. 
</P>
<P>
Charmaine and Maurice Kaplan hosted an underwriters dinner Friday at the new 
Canes bistro in Hillcrest at which "Monday Night" chair Judith Harris announced 
that Connick and his 21-piece orchestra will entertain after a backstage 
dinner. According to Harris, Connick has promised to engage in post-performance 
mingling with guests at the $250- and $350-per-person fund-raiser, a major 
league soiree that last year managed to handily muscle its way onto the already 
jammed summer calendar. 
</P>
<P>
Among those downing baked salmon and berry tartlettes at Friday's dinner were 
Peter and Peggy Preuss (Peggy shared chairwomanship duties with Charmaine 
Kaplan at the inaugural "Monday Night" last year); playhouse artistic director 
Des McAnuff and his wife, Susan Berman; theater angel Mandell Weiss; Robert 
Singer; Willard and Eileen VanderLaan; Ivor and Colette Royston; Audrey Geisel; 
Sandra Pay; Kate Adams with David Copley; Neil and Barbara Kjos; Rita 
Bronowski; Larry and Junko Cushman; George and Martha Gafford and Rita Gittes 
with Bill Woods.

DOG GROOMING AND CAR DETAILING COME KNOCKING.

Some call it the hassle factor -- all those little errands you run in between 
the more important errands you run while racing to and from the office on your 
lunch break. 
</P>
<P>
In a perfect world, you tell yourself, all products and services would come 
directly to your door. 
</P>
<P>
The (almost) perfect world has arrived. Sit back, dial the phone and wait for 
the delivery -- to your home or office. Besides pizza and perfume, a host of 
new products and services can come to your door. Among them are videos, 
clothing, gourmet dinners and such services as office massage, dog grooming, 
car detailing and interior decorating. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something terribly inefficient about picking things up week after 
week," said Century City psychologist and attorney Rex J. Beaber. "This is a 
trend that occurs in areas where driving has been made intolerable and in areas 
where every adult in a family is working. Time becomes the premium. 
</P>
<P>
"A trend like this is wealth-dependent. You see it mostly with people who have 
little discretionary time, but lots of discretionary income." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers spent billions of dollars buying goods and services from a vast array 
of home-delivery franchise businesses last year, said John Reynolds, marketing 
director for the International Franchise Assn. in Washington. "A major element 
for any franchise is the convenience factor, and home delivery is very 
convenient." 
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneur magazine recently ranked Decorating Den, which brings home 
decorating products to customers' homes, as the 17th fastest-growing franchise 
in the United States. Californian Steve Bursten formed the company 20 years ago 
after he observed people scouring stores in search of the right floor 
coverings, carpeting, draperies and upholstered furniture. 
</P>
<P>
Today, 1,000 franchisees tool around neighborhoods in "color vans" stocked with 
5,000 samples of fabrics, carpets and wallpapers to cover any home-decorating 
need. "People no longer have to run back and forth to showrooms," said Jean 
Poole, 46, who travels to about 30 client homes each month from her base in 
Woodland Hills. "Most people would like help when decorating their home, but 
they're too intimidated to call a designer." 
</P>
<P>
Poole purchases all home furnishings (including furniture, plants, picture 
frames, vases and lamps) from 25 national suppliers. Delivery and installation 
fees are included in Decorating Den's prices. 
</P>
<P>
After hiring a designer to dress your home, perhaps it is time you found 
someone to dress yourself -- if you're a man. The Best Dressed Co. will not 
only purchase and deliver men's clothes, but will color-coordinate them right 
down to a client's boxer shorts. 
</P>
<P>
"Most men hate to shop, and they just don't have the time," said Alex 
Rodriguez, 30, who began his business three years ago in Encino. Fees range 
from $500 for analysis and clothing coordination to $5,000 for packages that 
include personal shopping and home tailoring. In all cases, one of Rodriguez's 
three staff members will analyze a client's closet, assigning numbers to each 
item of clothing. Each garment is then matched according to color and listed in 
a portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
"He can pull out suit No. 1, look at his portfolio and see that it goes with 
shirts numbered six, seven and eight and ties numbered 10, 13 and 15," said 
Rodriguez, who has a client list of about 850. "When he buys something new or 
gets a gift, a consultant goes back and enters it into our computer." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Glickman, 30, whose real estate company filed for bankruptcy liquidation 
this week, has an appointment tomorrow with the service, which he first hired 
two years ago because "it eliminates something I've always despised" -- the 
hassle of buying clothes. "They know exactly what I like," Glickman said last 
month. "They attend clothing sales for me and will even send out a tailor to my 
home. And they tie ties better than I do." 
</P>
<P>
An analyst visits Glickman's Malibu home each week to lay out business suits 
and evening wear -- two outfits for each day, including belts, shoes, 
handkerchiefs and ties. 
</P>
<P>
Videos, as well as clothes, are now telephone-close, with mobile video vans 
delivering thousands of titles to homes and offices. Movie Express, based in 
Fox Hills, operates five vans (each stocked with 2,000 titles), with two of the 
vans covering the San Fernando Valley. For an annual membership fee of $5, 
customers receive a quarterly catalogue and pay $3.50 for each video that is 
delivered and picked up. Popcorn and pizza also are available. 
</P>
<P>
"We have corporate accounts too, because for some, it's more convenient to pick 
up their videos at the office," said Michael Collins, 22, chief of operations 
for the 2-year-old business, which delivers about 600 videos a day. 
</P>
<P>
Other entrepreneurs have begun cracking the office-delivery market. Lorna 
Rosenstein, a licensed masseuse, totes her specially designed massage chair to 
weary, desk-bound Valley executives each weekday. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the day, workers aren't likely to take the time to go to a 
massage therapist who may charge $60 an hour," said Rosenstein, 34, who also is 
office manager at Encino Chiropractic. 
</P>
<P>
The standard fee for the six or seven Los Angeles massage therapists who make 
office visits is $10 for 10 minutes, said Rosenstein, who sees about 10 clients 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
Most major printing companies will now deliver their goods, usually for minimum 
orders of $10 to $50. Miracle Printing &amp; Stationers in Van Nuys has about 
100 customers each week who request delivery. "With regular customers, there is 
no delivery charge," said manager Ron Miulli, 39. "Once in a while, we'll go to 
a person's home." 
</P>
<P>
Mobile dog-groomers are not a recent invention -- Vivian Jamieson says she has 
been grooming dogs at customers' homes for 22 years. Her company's five vans 
are dispatched from her Canoga Park grooming school each day, servicing about 
175 dogs a week. The dogs are groomed in the vans, which are equipped with 
electricity and hot water. 
</P>
<P>
"It's for people who don't have the time to run their dogs back and forth to 
shops, or who don't want them exposed to other dogs in shops where they're 
sometimes left for hours," said Jamieson, 63, who charges from $24 to $90 for 
services that include clipping, bathing, brushing, flea dips, nail clipping and 
ear cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
Because dogs get lonely too, several entrepreneurs now offer pet-sitting 
services. "We have one client in Studio City who has this Vietnamese pig that 
we look in on," said Viki Graszler, who tends about 10 pets a week through her 
Hollywood-based business, Pet Tender. "Her name is Annabelle. We feed her 
bottles of goat's milk, carrots, apples, celery and dried pig food. But she 
probably would eat anything if she had the chance." 
</P>
<P>
Graszler, who said she also tends an iguana and a snake, has monthly and 
twice-monthly rates for services that include walking animals and socializing 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
Veterinarians who make house calls are a rare find -- although there are a few. 
Pet Vet Mobile Hospital will visit residences to vaccinate pets and perform 
minor surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The Canoga Park-based Pet Vet Animal Hospital has a 23-foot mobile unit that is 
stocked with medications and has a surgery table, cages and an anesthesia 
machine. "The hospital charges an extra $15 for home visits," office manager 
Sharon Conner said. 
</P>
<P>
Should your car get sick, Auto Emergency makes house calls. "We go to people's 
offices a lot too," said owner Wes Holmes of the Simi Valley-based business he 
founded seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The company operates three vans, each stocked with $200,000 worth of tools. The 
mechanics can repair basic problems, replacing radiators, carburetors, starters 
and the like. The 24-hour business charges a $35 service fee plus parts and 
labor. 
</P>
<P>
Some tuneup and lube shops offer home services. Woodland Hills-based Mobilube 
uses an extraction process that pumps oil out through a vehicle's dip-stick 
tube. The business's one van services residential and corporate accounts, 
charging from $29 to $34 for oil and filter changes. 
</P>
<P>
Mobile car-detailing shops also will come to your door. R&amp;R Mobile Service 
in Chatsworth charges $90 to $110 for complete detailing, which is comparable 
to the prices charged by non-mobile detail shops. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Edward Rosenberg, 23, who formed his company four years ago, said he 
services about 25 cars each week, using three vans. "With shops, sometimes 
people have to drop off their car for a whole day to be detailed. It's a hassle 
to have someone pick you up." Home detailing takes about an hour, he said.

Pizza remains the premier home-delivered food, although a few dining services 
began taking restaurant food to customers' doors about four years ago. At least 
five such meals-on-wheels services now operate in the Valley. The newest among 
them is To Go Taxi, formed late last year by Alan Carpenter, 29, a former 
pizzeria manager. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter has assembled his own menu, consisting of selected items from the 
four Woodland Hills restaurants he uses. A dispatcher takes orders, and three 
drivers pick up and deliver the meals in thermal carrier bags. Carpenter, who 
has about 125 customers a week, said he tacks a delivery fee of 15% on each 
order to cover the cost of his service. 
</P>
<P>
Gourmands willing to spend a minimum of $300 can have just about anything they 
want spread across their home dining room tables. Pamper and Dine, a Studio 
City-based business started a year ago by Amy Tunick and Matthew Sarver, has 
served about 200 gourmet meals in customers' homes. 
</P>
<P>
Tunick, 31, launches the evening with soothing music and a half-hour Swedish 
massage. Meanwhile Sarver, 32, who once worked as a chef at David Murdock's 
Regency Club, finishes the preparation of a gourmet meal according to the 
client's specifications.

PASADENA OKS $264-MILLION BUDGET FOR '91; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCES: THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS VOTED YES DESPITE WARNINGS FROM THE OUTGOING 
CITY MANAGER THAT THE CITY IS LIVING BEYOND ITS MEANS.

<P>
The Board of Directors on Tuesday approved a $264-million operating budget over 
the objections of City Manager Donald McIntyre, who warned that the city is 
living beyond its means. 
</P>
<P>
The budget for fiscal 1991, which includes new allocations for child care, the 
arts and a landmark district, represents a 6.4% increase over last year's 
operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre, who was not present at Tuesday's board meeting but who sent a written 
message, said that the city is fast approaching the so-called Gann limitation, 
which imposes restraints on budget increases and that it faces losses in 
sales-tax revenue because "the regional economy may be starting a downturn." 
</P>
<P>
The Gann limitation, from an initiative approved by the voters in 1979, ties 
budget growth to population and cost-of-living increases. It is named for the 
measure's sponsor, the late Paul Gann. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre recommended that the board cut the budget by an additional $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The city's desire to serve the public has simply outstripped the resources 
available to accomplish its goals effectively," McIntyre wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The board nevertheless voted 6 to 1 to approve the entire budget, including the 
$121 million general city budget, over which the board has discretion. The 
remainder of the operating budget, over which the board has no discretion, goes 
for such items as water and power and garbage collection. 
</P>
<P>
Director William Paparian cast the lone dissenting vote. He said he was 
concerned that the budget did not include money for seven new firefighters. He 
said he voted for last year's budget only because of commitments from his 
colleagues that money for the additional firefighters would be allocated in the 
next two budgets. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it was unconscionable to take a budget decision from a year ago . . . 
and just set it aside, after so much careful thought and study," Paparian said. 
</P>
<P>
But others on the board said their commitment to bolster the Fire Department 
could be satisfied with a plan to add a fourth paramedic unit in January. 
Although the new budget does not include money for the seven-person unit, the 
board will consider the $252,000 measure as a special allocation within the 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
The board also agreed to conduct a mid-year budget review in January. If 
anticipated revenues do not materialize, Mayor Jess Hughston said, "the budget 
can be changed by four members of the board." 
</P>
<P>
The board is scheduled to vote on the city's proposed $94-million capital 
budget next week. 
</P>
<P>
Saved from the chopping block by Tuesday's action were three police officer 
positions for $198,000, a $60,000 arts program, $46,000 for the Bungalow Heaven 
Landmark District and $41,000 for an AIDS community task force. 
</P>
<P>
Although they supported the budget, some of the directors expressed doubts 
about the city's fiscal strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's shortsighted of us to be finding revenues under a rock, in some cases, in 
order to meet the demands for spending," Director John Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
The budget identifies about $1 million in new revenues, including $50,000 for 
jail rental (mostly from misdemeanor offenders who choose to serve time in 
Pasadena rather than in county jails), parking fines of $150,000, warrant 
charges of $100,000 (for which the city bills the Los Angeles County district 
attorney) and adjustments of $476,000 for financial services the city provides 
to such independent agencies as the Department of Water and Power and Rose 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased," Finance Director Mary Bradley said of the vote. "It's a 
consensus budget." 
</P>
<P>
She noted also that the board approved the budget three weeks ahead of 
schedule. The board acted quickly, she said, so that the new budget would be in 
place when new City Manager Philip Hawkey takes over on June 18.

ELECTIONS: FLORES AND O'BRIEN IN RUNOFF TO SUCCEED SCHABARUM. HORCHER WINS 
CLOSE RACE FOR ASSEMBLY NOMINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
San Gabriel Valley voters on Tuesday recalled a Pomona councilman, voted down a 
pay raise for Pasadena directors and gave key Assembly election victories to 
Paul V. Horcher, a Diamond Bar councilman, and Xavier Becerra, a state deputy 
attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant was recalled from office 8,317 to 4,065. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Donna Smith, who has been Bryant's longtime opponent, hailed his removal. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of faith in the voters," Smith said. "I believed they wanted good 
government in Pomona. I think we'll see the beginning of the healing process." 
</P>
<P>
The recall campaign began more than a year ago after Bryant voted with other 
council members to fire A. J. Wilson as city administrator. The effort picked 
up steam a few months later when Bryant joined with other council members to 
dismiss Richard Tefank as police chief. 
</P>
<P>
Recall supporters accused Bryant of using his office to browbeat city employees 
and to make scathing personal attacks. Bryant, who could not be reached for 
comment after the election, has defended his strong attacks on others as 
truthful and accused his opponents of waging a hate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
A special election to replace Bryant will be scheduled within the next several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
In the county supervisor's race Tuesday, Sarah Flores, a former aide to 
Supervisor Pete Schabarum, and Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Gregory O'Brien 
led a field of 10 candidates to qualify for a runoff. However, a federal court 
ruling in a redistricting suit earlier this week may force a new election. As 
presently drawn, the 1st Supervisorial District takes in most of the San 
Gabriel Valley from Arcadia eastward. 
</P>
<P>
At the eastern edge of the San Gabriel Valley, Pomona Councilman Mark A. T. 
Nymeyer lost a bid for the Republican nomination in the 65th Assembly District 
to Jim Brulte, former aide to Assemblyman Charles Bader (R-Pomona). 
</P>
<P>
The closest race was for the Republican nomination in the 52nd Assembly 
District where Horcher, a 38-year-old attorney, edged Wil Baca, an 
environmental activist from Hacienda Heights, by 64 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher benefited from a last-minute endorsement by state Sen. Frank Hill 
(R-Whittier), who gave up the Assembly seat after winning election to the state 
Senate earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher and Baca, both running as moderate conservatives, finished ahead of 
Kenneth Manning, a member of the Hacienda La Puente school board, and Tony 
Russo, a political aide, who each claimed to be the most conservative candidate 
in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher and Baca were the only candidates who labeled themselves as pro-choice 
on abortion, although opponents criticized Horcher for appearing to straddle 
the issue by also opposing public funding of abortions and stressing his 
personal convictions against abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Baca said the results show that the 52nd District, which stretches from La 
Mirada to West Covina, is "not nearly as conservative as people would like to 
believe. This isn't Radical Right or Reagan Country." 
</P>
<P>
Another losing candidate, Manning, said: "The conservative movement is losing 
ground. This district is becoming more moderate and liberal." 
</P>
<P>
But, Manning said, he thinks the election turned on "all the hit pieces and 
junk at the very end." Manning said he was the victim of a phone-bank campaign 
in which callers spread misinformation. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Englander, who managed Horcher's campaign, said Horcher won with a 
strong appeal to mainstream Republicans, women and Asians. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher received 4,456 votes to lead Baca, who had 4,392. Manning received 
4,290 votes and Russo 3,466. Trailing the leaders were Wayne Grisham, a former 
congressman and assemblyman, with 3,424 votes, and Phil Mautino, a Whittier 
attorney, with 3,353. 
</P>
<P>
In November, Horcher will face Democrat Gary Neely, a Diamond Bar marketing 
consultant, in the runoff in the predominately Republican district. 
</P>
<P>
Becerra's victory in the Democratic primary in the 59th Assembly District, 
which includes Monterey Park, Alhambra and Montebello, surprised political 
observers who had thought the contest was between Diane Martinez, a Garvey 
school board member and daughter of Rep. Matthew G. Martinez (D-Monterey Park), 
and Marta Maestas, who had the backing of state Sen. Charles M. Calderon 
(D-Whittier), for whom she had worked as district representative. 
</P>
<P>
But Becerra, who had the support of his former boss, state Sen. Art Torres 
(D-Los Angeles), won 8,448 votes, compared to 6,786 for Maestas and 6,249 for 
Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon, who gave up the Assembly seat after winning election to the Senate 
earlier this year, said Becerra won because Maestas and Martinez split the vote 
and because he ran an aggressive anti-crime campaign and stressed ethics in 
government. He noted that Becerra was perceived as an outsider running against 
candidates with strong political backing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the electorate went for the outsider candidate because they are tired 
of seeing business as usual," he said. "They want a change." 
</P>
<P>
Because of a strong Democratic advantage in registration, Becerra, 32, of 
Monterey Park, will be an overwhelming favorite to win the seat in November 
against Republican primary winner Leland Lieberg, an Alhambra businessman, and 
Libertarian candidate Steven Pencall. 
</P>
<P>
In the 65th Assembly District, the endorsement of Bader, who is giving up his 
Assembly seat to run against state Sen. Ruben Ayala (D-Chino), paid off for 
Brulte, his former chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
Brulte, 34, of Ontario, outpolled Nymeyer nearly 3 to 1, winning 21,121 votes 
to Nymeyer's 7,228. 
</P>
<P>
Brulte, who will face Democrat Robert Erwin, a Chino businessman, in November, 
said he was "very surprised" that Nymeyer failed to carry his own city. The 
margin was as wide in Pomona as it was in the remainder of the district, which 
stretches eastward through Ontario and north to the High Desert. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona voters also decided to revamp city government by enlarging the City 
Council, and by electing members by district instead of citywide. In place of 
the current system of four council members and a mayor, voters will elect six 
council members by district and a mayor citywide, starting with the municipal 
elections next year. 
</P>
<P>
In Pasadena, a measure to give members of the Board of Directors their first 
pay increase in 22 years was soundly defeated. "I thought it was the right time 
for this kind of thing to go forward," said Mayor Jess Hughston. "I'm 
disappointed at my misreading of the feelings of the people." 
</P>
<P>
Hughston said the measure, which would have increased board members' maximum 
monthly pay from $250 to $935, with additional compensation for participation 
in community development commission meetings, suffered from lack of 
salesmanship. "No effort whatsoever was made to push it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Brown, an opponent of the measure and the Libertarian Party's candidate for 
state insurance commissioner, said the vote "means that the people of Pasadena 
are fiscally responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Another Pasadena measure, making minor modifications in the city's growth 
management ordinance, was approved.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: LA VERNE; 
</P>
<P>
BETTER SIGN LAW IN WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has endorsed a kinder, gentler sign ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of Mayor Pro Tem Thomas Harvey, the council voted Monday night 
to stop prosecuting violations of city sign regulations for a month while it 
reworks the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey said complaints about the ordinance by business people have led him to 
believe the city tends to be "officious" in its enforcement. He suggested that 
La Verne be more flexible and stop sending out what he jokingly referred to as 
the "sign Gestapo." 
</P>
<P>
Later, he said that although La Verne does a good job in other areas of 
community relations, city officials need to be more considerate of the person 
who, for example, fixes automobiles but does not understand the ins and outs of 
city government. "We need to make people feel cared about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Community Development Director Steve Preston suggested that the city hold off 
prosecuting sign cases for a month while La Verne works on an amendment to make 
its sign ordinance more "nurturing" to the business community.

CLOSE DUMP, PHYSICIANS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 35-member governing body of the Los Angeles County Medical Assn., citing 
risks to the San Gabriel Valley's underground water supply, has endorsed a 
resolution opposing the expansion of the Azusa landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The medical group on Monday adopted a position paper that calls for the 
landfill's operator to close the dump and to "acknowledge that the Azusa site 
is not suitable for a landfill." 
</P>
<P>
Controversy has surrounded the expansion by Azusa Land Reclamation Co., even 
though it has received approval from local and state water boards. In addition, 
a Los Angeles Superior Court judge in April ruled in favor of the dump's 
expansion. But that decision was appealed last month by the Metropolitan Water 
District of Southern California and San Gabriel Valley water officials, who say 
the expansion threatens an already contaminated ground-water supply. 
</P>
<P>
The medical association, which has 10,000 physicians as members, joins a 
diverse group of dump expansion opponents, including the Environmental Defense 
Fund and the March of Dimes. 
</P>
<P>
Operators of the dump, whose parent firm is Browning-Ferris Industries, 
maintain that their facility is state-of-the-art and that great lengths have 
been taken to protect the environment around the landfill.

NO-SMOKING ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has instructed its city attorney to draft an ordinance banning 
smoking in most retail stores and in at least 60% of the dining space in 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The regulations would be modeled after an ordinance adopted by Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant on Monday urged the council to adopt the 
ordinance to "protect our nonsmoking population from the dangers of tobacco 
smoke while preserving the inherent right of smokers." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Donna Smith abstained from voting, and other council members expressed 
reservations. Councilman Tomas Ursua said the city may "be getting into areas 
we don't want to get into. . . . I'm not sure the city should be involved in 
policing people's habits." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Nell Soto said she too has qualms, but she and Ursua voted with 
Bryant and Councilman Mark A. T. Nymeyer to instruct the city attorney to 
prepare an ordinance.

REOPENING ENTRANCE AT MUIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of former John Muir High School students and faculty have approached 
the Board of Directors for support in reopening the school's front entrance on 
Lincoln Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The entrance was walled off more than 20 years ago to control access to the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Students enter the school through the faculty parking lot on the south side of 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
"Reopening the entrance would have a very positive impact on the Northwest 
revitalization goals," said Director Rick Cole. He said the closing of the 
entrance had been perceived as the school's "turning its back on the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Director Kathryn Nack said the closing "might have been appropriate at that 
time, but certainly times are different now." 
</P>
<P>
A decision on the opening would be up to the Pasadena Unified School District 
board, but money would probably have to come from the city, Cole said. The 
cost, which would include unsealing windows facing Lincoln Avenue, has been 
estimated at $230,000.

SUMMER JOBS PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Directors on Tuesday voted to sponsor a $120,000 summer jobs 
program for youths from the Northwest area of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Using federal Community Development Block Grants, the program will target 50 
college-bound youths from the area. The idea is to help the students "hit the 
ground running" by allowing them to earn up to $2,000 from summer work, 
Director Chris Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
The program will place students in such city offices as the city attorney's 
office and the Department of Water and Power, with an emphasis on jobs related 
to the environment, Holden said. "We didn't want to give them just maintenance 
jobs at minimum wage," he added.

ALTADENANS IRATE OVER PROPOSAL FOR 22 HOUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Irate residents charged this week that a plan to build 22 single-family homes 
on the edge of Eaton Canyon is a threat to wildlife, an interruption of 
longstanding hiking and equestrian trails, and a potential flood hazard for 
people who might live in the homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be immoral for the county to permit this plan to go forward," said 
Duane Merrill, a member of the unincorporated community's Town Council, citing 
past floods which have swept away structures built along the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles County Department of Regional Planning hearing officer is 
scheduled Tuesday to consider the plan by Monterey Park developer Lao-Ko Chu to 
build the 22 houses on a six-acre site north of New York Boulevard and west of 
the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Town Council held a special session of its own to consider the 
plan. As about 80 Altadena and Pasadena residents cheered them on, the 12 
members present voted unanimously to recommend that the county require the 
developer to prepare an environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those in the audience are already involved in a 3 1/2-year battle 
against a proposed 272-home development on the site of the old La Vina 
Sanitarium, in the foothills north of Lincoln Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting were Chu, who bought the parcel 2 1/2 years ago for 
$1.6 million, and consulting engineer Patrick J. Conley. Both said that planned 
measures to bolster the terrain would eliminate serious flood hazards. 
</P>
<P>
"Where are you guys going to be when those houses get washed out?" one critic 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
Chu contended that past floods were the result of illegal dumping in the 
canyon. "People dumped trash and there was no place for (water and debris) to 
go," he said, as those attending the meeting watched videotapes of a 1969 flood 
that swept away a restaurant near the site of Chu's project. 
</P>
<P>
The developer plans not only to bolster the west bank of the canyon, narrowing 
the channel through which potential floods could pass, but also to build the 
houses above the maximum flood stage, the highest point that water could be 
expected to reach in the event of a major deluge, Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
"Minimum protection would be one foot above the maximum flood stage," Conley 
said. "The project will be between two and three feet above it." 
</P>
<P>
Chu added that he has been conservative in planning for the development. The 
size of the project is substantially less than zoning would permit, he said. 
"We could build 36 homes there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The property was on the market for development," he added. "I'm a developer." 
</P>
<P>
Critics agreed that Chu has a legal right to build there, but they insisted 
that there are moral considerations that dictate that the site remain 
undeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
The site, a stable until a year ago, abuts on the county's Eaton Canyon Park 
and McCurdy Nature Center. Critics said new houses in the area would drive 
wildlife away. "There are deer, quail, rabbits and our own mountain lion," said 
Loren Lutz, who runs a nearby private nature preserve. "People living up there 
will head right for the (canyon) for their recreation. That will have an 
adverse effect on wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Acker, head of a local equestrian group, said Chu has already blocked 
longstanding horse trails. Acker and others would like the county or a 
public-interest group to take over the property and convert it into an 
equestrian center. 
</P>
<P>
Chu denies blocking any trails and said he has tried to be sensitive to horse 
lovers' interests. As for wildlife, Chu said, a nearby rifle range creates far 
more disturbance than his houses would. 
</P>
<P>
The county so far has required no environmental impact report for the project, 
although it has required Chu to pay a $33,000 fee rather than meet the 
requirement of turning a portion of the land over to the county for parkland. 
</P>
<P>
Conley said the developer would prepare a detailed environmental impact report 
only if the county requires it.

SOVIETS SAY THEY WON'T CUT JEWISH EMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, backing away from a threat to 
curtail Jewish emigration, told Secretary of State James A. Baker III that 
Moscow will continue its liberal departure policy, a senior State Department 
official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The official said Baker questioned Shevardnadze closely about Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's statements to a Washington press conference Sunday that 
his government would rethink its emigration policy unless Israel guaranteed 
that Soviet Jews would not be settled in the occupied West Bank or Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze asserted that Soviet policy is unchanged "and they are committed 
to that," said the official, who spoke to reporters aboard Baker's Air Force 
jet transport just before it left Copenhagen for Turnberry, Scotland. The 
secretary of state is attending a North Atlantic Treaty Organization foreign 
ministers meeting there today and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Baker met Shevardnadze for two hours Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The official refused to amplify on the cryptic account that Baker and 
Shevardnadze presented after the meeting concerning their talks on German 
reunification, perhaps the most vexing issue on the superpower agenda. But he 
volunteered a full account of the exchange on Soviet Jewish emigration. 
</P>
<P>
Although the United States shares Soviet objections to Jewish settlement in the 
West Bank and Gaza territories that Israel has occupied since the 1967 Middle 
East War, Baker told Shevardnadze that Washington cannot support renewed 
restrictions on Soviet Jewish emigration, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Baker) wanted to make it very clear that if there is any move in that 
direction, it would have very serious consequences," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev set off alarm bells Sunday when he said that unless the Jerusalem 
government agreed to prevent Soviet Jews from settling in the occupied 
territories, "we must give further thought to it in terms of what we do issuing 
permits for exit." 
</P>
<P>
Caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government replied that less than 1% 
of the Soviet Jewish immigrants coming to Israel settle in the West Bank or 
Gaza. An Israeli spokesman said Arab governments have focused on settlement in 
the occupied territories as a pretext for opposing all emigration to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
At his press conference, Gorbachev said he had been "bombarded" by Arab 
criticism for permitting Soviet citizens to swell the ranks of Jewish settlers 
in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing is very clear -- they are sensitive to Arab criticism," the U.S. 
official said Wednesday of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze told Baker that Gorbachev's remarks were not intended to signal a 
reversal of policy, although the Soviet president hoped to "demonstrate their 
(Moscow's) concern to the Israelis." 
</P>
<P>
The official reported that Shevardnadze said he is prepared for face-to-face 
talks with Israeli officials on the issue. Gorbachev told reporters in 
Minneapolis on Sunday that "the time has not yet come" when he would be willing 
to visit Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's press conference remarks took on an added significance because 
President Bush, who was seated next to him, did not object to the Soviet 
president's threats. 
</P>
<P>
Bush had earlier urged Israel to end all settlement activity in the occupied 
territories. Washington has long considered the settlements to be an obstacle 
to Middle East peace. 
</P>
<P>
The official said the U.S. government supports unrestricted emigration by 
Soviet citizens, although "we draw a distinction between Soviet Jews going to 
Israel and to the territories." 
</P>
<P>
Baker was in Copenhagen to address a meeting of the 35-nation Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), often called the Helsinki process 
because the conference first met more than 15 years ago in the Finnish capital. 
</P>
<P>
Although Baker called for steps to strengthen CSCE, he made clear that 
Washington does not share a growing European fascination with turning the 
organization into a Continent-wide security organ that could replace both NATO 
and the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze suggested just such a role for CSCE in his speech to the 
conference Tuesday. Some Western European nations, although they do not go that 
far, have also talked of enlarging the security component of CSCE, one of the 
few organizations that successfully straddled the ideological division of the 
Cold War. The United States, Canada and all European nations except Albania are 
members of CSCE. 
</P>
<P>
"NATO will continue to serve as the indispensable guarantor of peace -- and 
therefore the ultimate guardian of democracy and prosperity," Baker said. "The 
alliance will work to lock in stabilizing arms control agreements, to reshape 
its defense strategy to meet fundamentally changed conditions and to build 
bridges of political cooperation to the newly emerging democracies of the East. 
</P>
<P>
"As we leave the Cold War behind us, we confront again many age-old national, 
religious and ethnic conflicts that have so sorrowed our common civilization," 
he added. "CSCE, NATO, and the (European Community) and democratic institutions 
of Europe must now play a greater part in deepening and broadening European 
unity. We must ensure that these organizations continue to complement and 
reinforce one another." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Baker told reporters he will brief his fellow NATO foreign ministers 
on a Soviet proposal for some sort of agreement between NATO and the Warsaw 
Pact that Moscow has said might remove Soviet objections to a united Germany 
holding full membership in NATO. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said that although the Soviets raised the issue in the Washington summit, 
they have not yet worked out all of the details. 
</P>
<P>
"They continue to flesh out the idea, and they will be in touch with us," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The NATO foreign ministers meeting is expected to complete plans for an 
alliance summit conference in London next month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Israel, which expects up to 150,000 Soviet Jewish immigrants to arrive this 
year, denies that it has a policy of settling them in the occupied territories. 
But Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir says that because Israel is a democracy, its 
citizens are free to live wherever they wish, including the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip.

FEINSTEIN, WILSON OPEN BATTLE EARLY; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN: DEMOCRAT EMBARKS ON A UNITY TOUR WHILE REPUBLICAN UNVEILS COMMERCIAL 
THAT INCLUDES PRAISE FROM HIS OPPONENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Democratic nominee Dianne Feinstein traveled the length of California in a 
jubilant show of party unity Wednesday and, in the afterglow of a primary that 
changed the state's political landscape, opened the contest for the 
governorship with Republican winner Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Her commanding 11-point primary victory over Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp 
just hours old, Feinstein began her general election campaign by heralding her 
victory as a tribute to a centrist mainstream in the state and to the notion of 
"history in the making." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson also marched into battle early, unveiling at a Los Angeles breakfast a 
television commercial in which he heaps praise on himself -- using letters and 
remarks made by Feinstein, a longtime friend. And, forewarned by the election 
results of Feinstein's appeal, Wilson announced he would be "just as 
charismatic as hell" in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
The race, already characterized by the nation's political parties as the most 
important governor's contest this year, may have also become the most 
interesting Tuesday with Feinstein's defeat of Van de Kamp. It established an 
unprecedented matchup between an incumbent U.S. senator and the former San 
Francisco mayor seeking to be the first woman elected governor of California. 
</P>
<P>
The primary itself was historic. Five of the six women competing for 
nominations in the state's constitutional offices won. Besides Feinstein, they 
are state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who will challenge incumbent 
Leo T. McCarthy for lieutenant governor; Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan 
Milke Flores, a Republican who will battle incumbent Secretary of State March 
Fong Eu; Kathleen Brown, the daughter and sister of former Democratic governors 
who will run against the incumbent treasurer, Republican Thomas Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
In another key race, San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith defeated Los Angeles 
County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner after a tumultuous campaign to win the Democratic 
nomination for attorney general. Smith, not always an ally of Feinstein, joined 
her in her first appearance Wednesday, in San Francisco. Smith will face 
Republican Dan Lungren in November. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's passage of Prop. 111, the initiative which doubles the state's 
gasoline tax and increases California's spending limit, brought widespread 
relief among politicians for whom it was a referendum on taxes in the state 
where the nation's tax revolt was born. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, who along with the other gubernatorial contestants supported the 
measure, declared that vote in itself is evidence of a new political reality in 
California that would make it possible for the next governor to begin 
rebuilding a state whose infrastructure has grown tattered. 
</P>
<P>
"People were willing to say for the first time since the passage of Prop. 13 
(in 1978), 'I want to put my money where my mouth is,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
The former San Francisco mayor was joined in Los Angeles by Van de Kamp, who 
pledged his support to the Democratic cause and urged his supporters to do 
likewise. Other members of the Democratic ticket attended her press conferences 
in San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, while Wilson was joined in Los 
Angeles by fellow Republican winners. 
</P>
<P>
"We agree on so many more things than we disagree on," said Van de Kamp, who 
won praise as a "class act" from Feinstein, with whom he had waged a battle 
that grew increasingly testy in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's swift show of support heartened Democrats who had been concerned 
that the party would be fractured heading into what is expected to be a 
hard-fought contest with Wilson, who faced no serious opposition in his 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, armed with assurances that Van de Kamp would be in her corner, acted 
swiftly to move the image of the Democratic Party to the center, to her 
ideological turf, where she said she would spotlight "centrist, practical, 
common sense issues." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm one that wants this party to respond to the middle of the political 
spectrum," she said. "I want to bring home Democrats who have defected." 
</P>
<P>
The move shifts her close to the turf of Wilson, a Republican moderate with 
whom she has shared not only a working relationship but also some basic issue 
positions. Both support the death penalty. Both oppose offshore oil drilling. 
Both declare themselves to be abortion rights advocates. Both are moderates on 
the environment and are often allied with business. 
</P>
<P>
As strongly suggested by the candidates on Wednesday, the upcoming general 
election race could be a virtual re-run of the primary between Feinstein and 
Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein on Wednesday talked tough on crime, attempting as she did with Van de 
Kamp to co-opt that issue. But at the same time, she proudly boasted that 
Democrats, under her leadership, would be also be "caring." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, as Van de Kamp did before him, began the general election campaign by 
insisting that the issues of gender and abortion rights which so propelled 
Feinstein in the last few months are simply not important. 
</P>
<P>
"The issues in this campaign are who has done a better job in the past and who 
has better ideas for the future," Wilson declared at an early morning unity 
breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who supports abortion rights, said the issue of abortion "is largely 
irrelevant to this campaign."But the gubernatorial nominee will be sharing the 
ticket with Bergeson, whose anti-abortion stance is expected to remind voters 
of the Republican Party's internal disagreement on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The senator also said he believes that Feinstein's gender will not be a 
compelling part of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who is predicting a campaign on that is on rather shaky ground," he 
said. "They're going to have to have a good deal more to offer than gender." 
</P>
<P>
His statements, however, flew in the face of Los Angeles Times exit polling 
showing that of the issues important to voters, the death penalty and abortion 
rights are paramount. The polls also showed that a large part of Feinstein's 
appeal is linked to her gender. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he plans to campaign as the candidate of change -- much as did Van 
de Kamp, only to find that voters perceived Feinstein as the personification of 
change. Among the issues cited by the senator was his environmental record, 
which was recently judged by state environmentalists as better than 
Feinstein's. But Feinstein could be assisted in November by the presence on the 
ballot of the Big Green environmental initiative -- ironically, a measure 
placed on the ballot by Van de Kamp in hopes that it would increase his odds of 
victory. Wilson opposes that measure. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's staff began the general campaign on an upbeat note, reporting that 
Van de Kamp supporters have begun making overtures to help out the San 
Franciscan. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an enormous desire to win," said Hadley Roff, a political confidant. 
"That is a great propellant." 
</P>
<P>
But Feinstein's campaign now is close to broke, and she was blunt Wednesday 
about the necessity of raising money fast. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first vulnerability right now is financial," she told supporters and 
reporters at Los Angeles International Airport. "We need to go out and raise a 
good deal of money." 
</P>
<P>
She specifically directed her pitch to women across the country. "This is an 
unparallelled opportunity for women today to come financially into the 
political big time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein had steadily raised money through the close of the primary; 21 
fund-raisers were held in 14 days before the primary, including a $100,000 
affair Sunday at the chic Spago restaurant. But much of the cash flow paid for 
television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, at the last accounting, had about $3.4 million in cash reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said it is unlikely that the former San 
Francisco mayor would have enough collected before July 1 to mount a new 
advertising campaign. "Clearly, we don't have enough to sustain any kind of 
long-term buy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's staff refused to say how much money his campaign would spend in coming 
weeks, but the senator said he would be "visible" on television for the short 
term. 
</P>

HOUSE VOTES TO CURB EXPORTS TO SOVIETS, CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Delivering its first formal verdict on last week's U.S.-Soviet summit, the 
House on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly to block future high-technology exports 
to the Soviet Union unless the blockade of Lithuania is lifted and Soviet Jews 
are allowed to emigrate. 
</P>
<P>
The House then voted by similarly huge margins of nearly 4-1 to cut off exports 
of space satellites to China and to limit that nation's ability to sell abroad 
sophisticated goods it imports from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Both votes were amendments to a bill that would make it much easier for U.S. 
high-tech industries to sell products to Eastern Europe and other Communist and 
formerly Communist countries. The Senate has yet to consider similar 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
After approving the rebukes to the Soviets and Chinese, the House plowed 
through a long list of lesser amendments before voting final passage 312-86. 
</P>
<P>
The overall bill was opposed on the floor by conservative Republicans, although 
they joined in the bipartisan effort to pass the amendments considered a rebuke 
of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for his harsh treatment of Lithuania 
and of President Bush for his lenient treatment of China. 
</P>
<P>
House approval of the bill has been a foregone conclusion since early last 
month, when the chamber's Foreign Affairs Committee overwhelmingly passed the 
measure. Late Wednesday, a proposal to limit relaxation of export controls was 
handily defeated, 281 to 136, with 59 Republicans supporting the Democratic 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
The GOP conservatives, with backing from the Administration, argued, however, 
that broad moves to relax longstanding controls on technology exports to the 
Soviet Union, China and Eastern Europe also should be cleared by the Armed 
Services and Intelligence committees. The Pentagon and intelligence community 
still have misgivings about permitting the free export of sophisticated 
products and techniques with potential military use. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has said little about the bill, mostly the work of House 
Democrats, while proposing its own program of eased export controls. Bush 
announced a plan to ease controls on May 2, a day before the House committee 
approved its bill. 
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday, three Cabinet secretaries -- from State, Defense and Commerce 
-- urged Congress in a message to delay a vote until talks are completed this 
week among North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies and other Western nations 
on trade with the crumbling Soviet Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
In the message, the Administration warned that the proposed bill goes too far, 
liberalizing exports of military-capable technology. House Republicans warned 
that under the House bill, dangerous Third World countries such as Iraq or 
Libya might more easily obtain military technology. 
</P>
<P>
But the bill's sponsors brushed off all such claims. Indeed, Wednesday's floor 
action on the issue had been scheduled in part precisely because the 
Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom) is meeting on 
export policy in Paris Wednesday and today. The organization of 17 NATO and 
other Western countries is responsible for setting technology export rules. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration feared that the House action would limit U.S. negotiating 
options at the Cocom meeting in Paris. For months now, the European members of 
the group have been pushing the Administration to relax technology controls 
more drastically and more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
In some regards, the dispute has more to do with turf than policy, said William 
T. Archey, vice president for international policy at the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce here. The chamber, he said, strongly supports the House bill precisely 
because it would codify into law export control relaxations that the 
Administration would rather leave to presidential discretion. 
</P>
<P>
During Wednesday's floor debate on the Soviet and China amendments, 
Administration supporters argued against imposing limits on presidential 
authority to decide whether or not to sell satellites to China. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment to challenge Soviet policy on Lithuania was sponsored by Democrat 
Richard J. Durbin of Illinois and Republican William S. Broomfield of Michigan. 
The proposal was a clear signal that Congress will balk at a trade agreement 
with the Soviets unless Gorbachev eases his Baltic policy. 
</P>
<P>
Congress also reacted to Gorbachev's hint last Friday that Soviet Jews would 
not be allowed to emigrate to Israel if they are not barred from settling in 
territories occupied in the 1967 Arab-Israel War. California Rep. Mel Levine 
(D-Santa Monica) -- citing Gorbachev's "ominous threat" to Soviet Jews -- 
proposed that restrictions on exports should not be relaxed if that hint 
becomes reality. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, however, backed away from his 
president's threat, telling Secretary of State James A. Baker III in Copenhagen 
that Soviet policy is unchanged and that his nation will continue its liberal 
departure policy. 
</P>
<P>
Levine said that Wednesday's floor action is "our first legislative opportunity 
to respond" to the Soviets' policy in Lithuania and on emigration. 
</P>
<P>
"If we open the door to the Soviet Union, we should not forget the aspirations 
of the people of Lithuania," Durbin added. 
</P>
<P>
Said Broomfield, "While the Soviet president puts out one hand to ask for aid 
from the United States, his other hand is around the neck of tiny Lithuania." 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuania and emigration conditions were approved by a sweeping, 390-24 
vote. The limits on easing export controls for China passed by votes of 352 to 
62 and 393 to 15.

STAFFERS WHOSE BOSSES LOST TRY TO COPE THE DAY AFTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Receptionist Molly Bien has answered telephones for the state Department of 
Justice in Los Angeles for 18 years, and nothing at work has upset her as much 
as the Tuesday election that made her boss a loser. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't it awful?" Bien asked Wednesday between phone calls, referring to Atty. 
Gen. John K. Van de Kamp's loss to Dianne Feinstein in the Democratic 
gubernatorial primary. "People just can't understand why they would choose her 
over him." 
</P>
<P>
Saddened and a bit angry, Bien did what any good employee would do the day 
after defeat: She telephoned the boss's office and offered her condolences. "I 
would only see him in the elevator, and he always was with a bodyguard, but I 
felt so badly," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bien wasn't alone in her disappointment. While television cameras and newspaper 
reporters buzzed around the victors in Tuesday's election, the rank-and-file 
bureaucrats and secretaries who toil in the offices of the losers quietly and, 
in some cases, awkwardly attempted to return to routines. In the workaday 
environs of Van de Kamp, Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, City Councilman Robert Farrell 
and other politicians who sought higher office, the day after was one of 
treading lightly, keeping the chin up and the nose to the grindstone. 
</P>
<P>
"It is pretty somber here right now," said Linda Ortiz, one of Reiner's 
secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
"It is sort of like a divorce or death in the family," said a Van de Kamp aide. 
"Everybody has different ways of dealing with uncomfortable situations." 
</P>
<P>
There were even tears at some work stations. Mike Botula, Reiner's news 
secretary, wept early Wednesday morning as he comforted Reiner after he lost 
the Democratic nomination for attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Boss, we were here for you yesterday, and we are going to be here for 
you tomorrow,' " said Botula, who choked up again telling the story. 
</P>
<P>
Some employees made special trips down the hall or across the office just to 
check in on the boss. Others sent flowers. But for most, post-election protocol 
dictated laying low and avoiding a fuss. 
</P>
<P>
"It is awkward," said Regina Birdsell, Van de Kamp's press secretary, who was 
surprised when he showed up ready to work. "All of us thought, 'Gee, he must 
feel bad.' " 
</P>
<P>
Kaifa Tulay, Farrell's legislative assistant, arrived early Wednesday at City 
Hall to pull together a speech for the councilman on banking services in 
low-income sectors of the city, including parts of Farrell's South-Central Los 
Angeles district. Farrell failed in his bid for the Democratic nomination for 
the 48th Assembly District, but he showed up Wednesday for a City Council 
meeting eager to speak about banking problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to get right back into the routine," Tulay said. "Emotionally everyone 
is down, but he was in a fighting mood this morning. He said this is just the 
first time, that he will be back again. That helped people." 
</P>
<P>
Around the corner, Hanna Yu, who had toyed with the idea of moving to 
Sacramento if Farrell won a seat in the Legislature, pecked away at her 
computer in Farrell's third-floor office as another deputy talked nearby with 
some constituents. 
</P>
<P>
"It is something that he really wanted," Yu said. "That is what you think 
about." 
</P>
<P>
On the 18th floor of the Los Angeles County Criminal Courts Building, Reiner 
arrived for work half an hour early. He met with several of his closest 
advisers, assuring them that he was ready "to go to work." 
</P>
<P>
The mood in the office, however, was decidedly flat. 
</P>
<P>
"I am still trying to readjust," said Gregory Thompson, Reiner's chief deputy. 
"I have to get the focus right. It is like changing glasses. The first couple 
of days you have them you aren't sure you are seeing quite right." 
</P>
<P>
Jack B. White, chief of the office's bureau of investigation, said almost 
everyone was still in shock. 
</P>
<P>
"People are just astonished that he was beaten," White said. "I had looked 
forward to perhaps joining Mr. Reiner in Sacramento. He hadn't been elected and 
I hadn't been invited, but I guess we took some things for granted." 
</P>
<P>
On the elevators at the Criminal Courts Building, deputy district attorneys 
gossiped about the results, some wondering aloud what it would mean for them, 
while others delighted in seeing their boss -- unpopular with many -- take an 
embarrassing fall. 
</P>
<P>
Gallows humor could be heard. "Yesterday, we were all trying to figure out who 
would be next in line," one Reiner underling wisecracked for colleagues. "Now 
we know. His name is Ira." 
</P>
<P>
At Farrell's office, receptionist Nellie Nelson was a little put off by the 
commotion the election had created. 
</P>
<P>
"You win some and you lose some," Nelson said. "A lot of people are calling and 
want to have a long conversation, but I just don't have the time being on the 
switchboard and all." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, for every loser there's a winner. Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan 
Milke Flores, who won the Republican nomination for secretary of state, could 
be seen proudly shaking hands Wednesday in council chambers. Downstairs, her 
aides debated the merits of moving to Sacramento.

A TURN IN THE QUEST FOR CONSUMER RELIEF; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE COMMISSIONER: NOMINATIONS OF GARAMENDI AND BANNISTER MAY REFLECT 
CHANGE IN EMPHASIS TOWARD REDUCING COMPANY COSTS AS A WAY TO CUT HIGH COST OF 
COVERAGE. 
</P>

<P>
The nominations of Democratic state Sen. John Garamendi and Republican 
insurance agent Wes Bannister in the race to become California's first elected 
insurance commissioner apparently represent a turn in the search for lower 
insurance premiums toward proposals to fund price cuts by reducing the 
companies' claims and legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
Both Garamendi and Bannister, in looking forward to what is expected to be a 
low-key general election campaign, spoke Wednesday of the importance of 
reducing costs to the companies as a vital prerequisite to bringing down 
California insurance prices. 
</P>
<P>
That represented a distinct change in emphasis from the talk about simply 
rolling back companies' prices that marked the losing campaigns of Democrats 
Bill Press and Conway Collis and had been the rhetoric of the backers of 
Proposition 103 for the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi declared Wednesday that Proposition 103 "needs to be rewritten" and 
he said that as commissioner he would establish a strong lobbying office in 
Sacramento to push new legislation to do that. 
</P>
<P>
Bannister said that in the campaign "we have to talk about reduction of 
premiums through no-fault insurance and through reduction of fraud." 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi vowed to make the commissioner's office the nation's best consumer 
protection agency, and remarked of Bannister, "I don't think the people of 
California are about to elect an insurance agent to watch over the insurance 
industry." But the general tone of his and Bannister's remarks cheered insurers 
Wednesday and concerned their rivals, the trial lawyers. Often, when cutting 
costs to the companies is mentioned as a means of bringing about lower rates, 
legal reform, cutting back on claimants' right to sue and the lawyers' income 
are mentioned in the next breath. 
</P>
<P>
Such insurers as Pete Ingham, general counsel for State Farm, Wednesday lauded 
the California election returns, both in the governor's race, where Democratic 
nominee Dianne Feinstein spoke Tuesday night of cutting claims costs, and the 
insurance commissioner's contest as representing a new attitude in California 
toward reform. 
</P>
<P>
But Gary Gwilliam, a former president of the California Trial Lawyers Assn., 
said the results were a shame and came about only because of divisions in the 
consumer movement that saw such consumer or lawyer-oriented candidates as Bill 
Press, Conway Collis and Walter Zelman split the vote against the candidates 
more favorable to company views. 
</P>
<P>
Gwilliam said that fielding a single candidate in the future should be a top 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
Press, who ran second for the Democratic nomination, losing to Garamendi by 
about 175,000 votes, said Wednesday: "Somebody told me this morning it was like 
Beirut. We were killing our own." He noted that by adding Zelman's 189,000 
votes to his own 638,000, he would have defeated Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi takes issue with any assessment that he would be the insurers' 
commissioner. He said after the election that he wants to meet with all 
factions in the insurance crisis, including Harvey Rosenfield, author of 
Proposition 103, to hear their ideas. 
</P>
<P>
But Rosenfield was smarting Wednesday from the size of the defeat suffered by 
the candidate he backed for the Democratic nomination, Collis, and he appeared 
in no mood to be friendly with Garamendi. In fact, he said, he is going to 
shift his party registration from Democrat back to independent. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield's associate, national consumer advocate Ralph Nader, meanwhile, was 
unavailable for comment on the defeat not only of Collis, whom he had 
supported, but also of gubernatorial candidate Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
Ingham of State Farm said he believes Nader is less effective in endorsing 
candidates than he is in taking stands on issues.

DEMOCRATS SAVOR HOLD ON REDISTRICTING POWER

Republicans on Wednesday enjoyed a long-sought election win in a San Diego 
Assembly district, but Democrats marched off with the bigger victory of 
deciding how political boundaries will be shaped into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
No incumbent from either party in the Legislature lost in Tuesday's primary. 
Additionally, the victors in November's legislative races face the likely 
prospect of a pay raise in December. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Jeff Marston of San Diego gave the GOP a shot of cheer by winning a 
special election runoff and capturing a vacant Assembly seat previously held by 
a Democrat. Marston will try to win a full two-year term in November. 
</P>
<P>
"We are really tickled," said Assembly GOP Leader Ross Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
But Democrats still outnumber Republicans in the Assembly, 45 to 33, with two 
vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
And Democratic leaders barely contained their euphoria at the voters' refusal 
to approve a pair of GOP-backed initiatives -- Propositions 118 and 119 -- to 
drastically overhaul the way political boundaries are realigned every 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, the legislative party in power draws district lines after the 
federal census to its own advantage and to protect "friendly" incumbents of the 
opposition. This helps assure that the majority party remains in control for 
the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
State Senate Leader David Roberti (D-Los Angeles) rejected assertions Wednesday 
that voters might have been misled by television commercials against the 
propositions in which celebrities warned that the measures would jeopardize 
laws protecting the coast and diminish minority representation. 
</P>
<P>
But Gov. George Deukmejian, a Republican, deplored as a "fraud" the opposition 
television campaign financed by Democrats and their allies. He called the 
election of Republican gubernatorial nominee Pete Wilson essential to provide a 
"balance" to any lopsided Democratic redistricting measure. 
</P>
<P>
The governor can veto a redistricting plan passed by the Legislature, making a 
two-thirds vote by lawmakers necessary to put it into effect. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't have a Republican governor after the next reapportionment is done, 
we are going to continue to be a minority party in the Legislature and the 
congressional delegation," Deukmejian said. 
</P>
<P>
Three of Tuesday's winning incumbents faced potentially tough races because of 
questions raised about their ethics. Two of these incumbents -- Assemblywoman 
Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) and Assemblyman Pete Chacon (D-San Diego) -- won 
renomination easily; the third, Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas), 
survived a close contest. 
</P>
<P>
New faces in the Assembly will number at least eight next year. Because the 
open seats are in districts where voter registration is lopsided in favor of 
one party or the other, the nominees selected Tuesday are expected to be 
elected in November. 
</P>
<P>
These primary winners included Republican Paula Boland of Granada Hills in the 
38th District; Democrat Marguerite Archie-Hudson of Los Angeles in the 48th 
District; and Republican Paul Horcher of Hacienda Heights in the 52nd District. 
In an unusual political split, Horcher won an eight-person race with less than 
18% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Other victors were Huntington Beach Mayor Tom Mays, a Republican, in the 58th 
District; Deputy Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra, a Monterey Park Democrat, in the 
59th District; and Republican legislative aide Jim Brulte of Ontario in the 
65th District. Oakland Democrats nominated businesswoman Barbara Lee in the 
13th Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
Becerra's nomination to fill an Assembly seat left vacant by the earlier 
election of Charles Calderon (D-Whittier) to the Senate added to the political 
clout of Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), a Becerra mentor. Becerra defeated 
Calderon's candidate, Marta Maestas. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of a pay raise for legislators late this year arises from passage 
of Proposition 112, an "ethics reform" measure that bans speaking fees and 
curbs receipt of gifts. Within the next month, Deukmejian must appoint seven 
members to a new commission that will decide salaries and other compensation 
for legislators, the governor himself and other top-level state officials. 
</P>

DEMOCRATIC TICKET HAS A NORTHERN CAST; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: FEINSTEIN IS FIRST NON-SOUTHERN CALIFORNIAN TO WIN MAJOR PARTY 
NOMINATION FOR GOVERNOR SINCE 1966.

The overriding axiom of California politics since a massive shift of power in 
the 1960s has been that the votes and money -- and therefore successful 
candidates -- lie south of the Tehachapi Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
But look what happened in Tuesday's primary election: Democrats nominated 
almost a solid slate of northerners for statewide office. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the Democratic ticket is former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, 
the first Northern Californian to win a major party nomination for governor in 
24 years, since Democrat Edmund G. (Pat) Brown was chosen to run for a third 
term against Republican Ronald Reagan in 1966 and lost. In addition to the 
other northerners who won contested nominations Tuesday for statewide office, 
Bill Honig of San Francisco, was elected outright to a third term as the 
nonpartisan state superintendent of public instruction. 
</P>
<P>
While the Republican slate in the Nov. 6 general election reflects growing 
areas of GOP strength, particularly in Orange and San Diego counties, that 
party's ticket also includes a northerner, incumbent state Treasurer Thomas W. 
Hayes of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan sweep of 1966, coupled with court-ordered reapportionment that ended 
northern and rural control of the state Legislature, turned traditional 
California politics on its ear. Since then, southerners have dominated 
statewide races. It has almost been a political rule of thumb that, all other 
things being equal, a Southern California candidate will defeat a northerner. 
</P>
<P>
But that political axiom proved untrue Tuesday. The northern wins captured the 
attention and imagination of California political experts. But generally they 
suggested the northern success was due to coincidence and the peculiar nature 
of each contest rather than any geographic flexing of political muscle. 
</P>
<P>
One historian, however, said there was significance to the regional victories. 
Kevin Starr said the outcome reflected a trend toward the economic and 
political unification of urban Northern and Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderful shift, a very important shift," said Starr, a Bay-Area 
resident who commutes regularly to a teaching job at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly linked by transportation and communication, the San Francisco-Los 
Angeles-San Diego corridor is emerging as "a city called California," Starr 
observed. As old jealousies and points of pride blur, Southern Californians can 
be comfortable voting for northerners, he added. Northern Californians are 
recognizing the south as a dynamic world capital to which they are inextricably 
linked. 
</P>
<P>
If elected, Feinstein also would be the first California chief executive to 
jump directly from local government into the state's top elective office since 
Republican James Rolph Jr. was elected governor in 1930 while serving as San 
Francisco mayor. Her opponent in the Nov. 6 general election, Republican U.S. 
Sen. Pete Wilson, also is a former mayor -- of San Diego -- and would be the 
first governor from that city in modern times. 
</P>
<P>
Back in 1974, Pat Brown's son Jerry came along to win the governorship back for 
Democrats, but by eschewing his San Francisco-Sacramento roots and consciously 
choosing Los Angeles as his political power base, first winning election to the 
Los Angeles Community College Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Today, as Feinstein goes against Wilson, she heads a ticket dominated by 
Northern Californians, including Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy; Arlo Smith, the San 
Francisco district attorney who was an upset winner over Los Angeles County 
Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, and state Sen. John Garamendi of Walnut Grove, who 
defeated Southerners Bill Press and Conway Collis for the nomination to be the 
state's first elected insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican slate more closely reflects the growing GOP power base in 
Southern California, although Wilson served in the capital as a member of the 
state Assembly in the 1970s, and Marian Bergeson of Newport Beach, the party's 
nominee for lieutenant governor, is an incumbent state senator who is respected 
by the Sacramento Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Democrats, the only explanation political experts could give was 
that it was the strength of the candidate and the nature of the campaign that 
counted. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner was far better known than Smith, his San Francisco counterpart, going 
into their contest but was plagued by far higher negative views among those 
familiar with his controversial career. The underdog Smith campaigned 
tirelessly throughout Southern California while Reiner made only token campaign 
forays into the North. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein ran as a candidate who could rise above geographic differences and 
bring disparate parts of California together. "Nobody thought I would get a 
plurality of votes in Southern California, but I did," she told a San Francisco 
news conference Wednesday. "Our destinies are intertwined." 
</P>
<P>
But even with the success of all the candidates from the north, the fact 
remains, that "it would be fantasy to think that a Northern Californian could 
win without Southern California money," said Robert Forsyth, an aide to Senate 
President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles). "The money is still in the 
Los Angeles area."

FALTERING NRA FINDS ITSELF UNDER THE GUN; 
</P>
<P>
CONVENTION: SETBACKS ON CAPITOL HILL AND IN STATEHOUSES AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE 
FORCING THE POWERFUL LOBBYING GROUP TO TAKE STOCK.

<P>
Once the object of fear and envy of any group that ever sought to influence a 
piece of legislation, the National Rifle Assn. comes here today in a virtual 
shambles. 
</P>
<P>
The wounds still fresh from a stinging loss in the U.S. Senate two weeks ago 
over assault weapons, about 20,000 NRA members will try to regroup during their 
annual convention. One task will be to figure out what has gone wrong for a 
lobbying force seen by some as indomitable on Capitol Hill and in statehouses 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very important meeting for us," said Dick Riley, a four-decade NRA 
member who will probably become its newest president Saturday. "We're at a 
period in our history when we're seeing as great an assault on legitimate gun 
ownership and the Second Amendment as there's ever been." 
</P>
<P>
But even as leaders of the 2.8-million-member organization seek a unified front 
behind a barrage of law-and-order talks and festive rallies this weekend, they 
will face potentially deep divisions within their own ranks, according to 
officials both inside and outside the Washington-based organization. 
</P>
<P>
Underscoring the predicament faced by NRA leadership is that their convention 
is being held in a state that handed gun owners two critical recent losses -- a 
ban on military-style assault weapons in the wake of the Stockton massacre of 
five schoolchildren and the imposition of a 15-day waiting period on the 
purchase of recreational rifles and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
"What the NRA is going to have to do at this meeting," suggested Susan 
Whitmore, communications director at Handgun Control Inc., the NRA's biggest 
nemesis, "is to explain to its membership a string of defeats and why it's 
happened. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The scuttlebutt is that it's possible there will be a shake-up at the 
convention because essentially, the NRA has had to learn two new words in the 
last year -- lose and compromise, and the members are not happy," she added. 
"The leadership is going to be held accountable." 
</P>
<P>
NRA leaders dismiss such talk as wishful thinking by their old adversaries in 
the gun-control sector and by a handful of malcontents within a group that 
reportedly has an annual budget of $87.5 million. And they insist that critics 
will see no moderation in their strong defense of gun rights -- only a more 
aggressive posture in Washington and around the country in pressing for those 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
Confident they can unify their members once again, NRA leaders plan to display 
that new aggressiveness with a public relations splash during the four-day 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Rep. Mike Espy, an NRA member, will address the group at its convention 
center at the Anaheim Hilton and Towers Hotel. He is billed as the first black 
congressman to represent Mississippi since Reconstruction, and his appearance 
is seen by some observers as an attempt by the NRA to reach out to blacks and 
inner-city residents who in public opinion polls have overwhelmingly favored 
gun control. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Morphonios, a U.S. Circuit Court judge in Florida with a tough 
"law-and-order " reputation, will speak, too. The traditional gun exhibitors 
and instructors will be present in full force. And organizers plan a Friday 
evening rally, replete with music, speakers and streamers, to kick off a new 
campaign aimed at heading off gun-control initiatives around the country. 
</P>
<P>
But behind the scenes, in closed sessions that will begin this morning, NRA 
leaders will be looking at long-range strategies, deciding fund-raising 
priorities and lobbying targets and, in general, trying to find a way to regain 
their position of strength. 
</P>
<P>
"When any organization loses and doesn't accomplish its objectives, there are 
always questions from its members as to how this could happen," Riley said. 
"That's only natural. But we're prepared for it." 
</P>
<P>
And gun buff Neal Knox of Maryland, a longtime rabble-rouser within the NRA, 
says he has rarely, if ever, seen such signs of discontent within the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
A gun magazine writer and editor, Knox, 54, says he has received dozens of 
calls in recent weeks from gun-owning compatriots who are anxiously looking to 
this week's convention to express their worries about the trend in gun control 
in this country and the NRA's waning efforts to counter it. 
</P>
<P>
Some suggest that the "Evil Empire" -- so dubbed by former White House press 
secretary James Brady -- may be crumbling. Brady, who was paralyzed in a 1981 
assassination attempt, coined the phrase because of the NRA's seeming ability 
to thwart any gun control initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been slapped repeatedly and severely in the last year (by gun-control 
measures around the country), and I think it's been the most traumatic time 
that gun owners have ever encountered," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
The current NRA leadership, he said, has given too much in the name of 
compromise, abandoning the "hard-line" approach that has been its trademark. 
And he added: "If I were an NRA official right now, I wouldn't be relishing 
going before a bunch of angry members." 
</P>
<P>
Added T.J. Johnston of Anaheim, another NRA member who is critical of the 
current leadership: 
</P>
<P>
"There's going to be a lot of kicking and screaming on that convention floor. . 
. . We have the right to own firearms until we misuse them, and that right 
should not be in any way restricted. The problem is, the NRA lately hasn't been 
playing hardball enough in making that point." 
</P>
<P>
As divided as the organization appears, all seem to trace their recent losses 
in legislatures and in public opinion polls to the same source: associations of 
police chiefs around the country that were once strong allies of the NRA but 
that are now leading the charge for still-greater controls on the purchase and 
use of firearms. 
</P>
<P>
James Baker, the NRA's chief Washington lobbyist, acknowledges that, at a time 
of heightened public concern over crime, the image of a battle-weary police 
chief appealing for legislation that would get guns off the street is a 
difficult one to counteract. 
</P>
<P>
But in a statement that is disputed by gun-control advocates, he added: "What 
doesn't get reported is that there is a genuine division between these police 
chiefs' associations (which are endorsing gun-control measures) and the 
rank-and-file police. 
</P>
<P>
"The rank and file know that criminals by definition do not obey the law and 
will get their guns somehow, so all you've really done by passing these 
measures is to give the criminal another piece of paper to laugh at," Baker 
said. "Our worst enemies are those who would seek to link law-abiding gun 
owners and the crime problem. Because the two have nothing to do with one 
another."

SIHANOUK ACCUSES THAILAND OF AIDING PHNOM PENH REGIME 
</P>

<P>
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, nominal head of Cambodia's three-party resistance 
coalition, condemned Thailand today for allegedly working to support the 
Vietnamese-backed Hun Sen government in Phnom Penh. 
</P>
<P>
In a middle-of-the night interview with selected reporters, Sihanouk denounced 
Thai Prime Minister Chatchai Choonhavan and Deputy Prime Minister Chavalit 
Yongchaiyudh for scrapping an agreement that the Khmer Rouge -- one of his two 
coalition partners -- was prepared to accept and substituting a new formula for 
peace that the Communist Khmer Rouge rejected in a two-day conference here 
ending Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The prince, who was ousted as Cambodia's head of state in a 1970 coup, blamed 
three political advisers of Chatchai for persuading the Thai government to 
scrap a cease-fire agreement that Chavalit had drawn up earlier. That agreement 
was initialed in Bangkok a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
In its place, Sihanouk charged, Chavalit presented in Tokyo a "more complicated 
document" that Thailand knew the Khmer Rouge would not accept although the 
essential points in both drafts were the same. 
</P>
<P>
The three Thai advisers favor the Hun Sen government and want to stop the Khmer 
Rouge guerrillas, the biggest of the resistance armies, from seizing more 
territory in Cambodia by enforcing an early cease-fire, Sihanouk contended. 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Sihanouk roundly criticized the Tokyo agreement that he 
signed Tuesday with Cambodian Premier Hun Sen. The accord calls for a 
cease-fire and the convening next month of a Supreme National Council for 
Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
"If you really want peace in Cambodia, you should do nothing to give the Khmer 
Rouge a pretext to withdraw from the peace process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his criticism of the Tokyo agreement, Sihanouk said he signed it 
because it originated in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
"We depend on Thailand (for arms and supplies)," he said. " . . . I cannot 
resist Thailand." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday night, Premier Hun Sen, in a news conference, also singled 
out Thailand's position as one of the most significant developments to emerge 
from the Tokyo conference. 
</P>
<P>
"The Khmer Rouge could never exist without assistance from China and transit 
through Thailand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said he is encouraged that Thailand now "clearly wants an early 
cease-fire in Cambodia." 
</P>
<P>
He denied that his government is trying to persuade Sihanouk and Son Sann, 
leader of the third group in the resistance coalition, to join him against the 
Khmer Rouge, who are blamed for the deaths of more than a million Cambodians 
during their 1975-78 rule. Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December, 1978, to oust 
the Khmer Rouge and install the government now headed by Hun Sen. 
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk said he favors a resolution adopted last month by the five permanent 
members of the U.N. Security Council -- the United States, Soviet Union, China, 
France and Britain -- as the best hope for peace in Cambodia. That document 
recognizes the four warring factions as equals, while the Tokyo agreement gives 
the Hun Sen government equal standing with the three resistance factions 
combined.

WEST GERMANY: THE RETIRED U.S. ARMY SERGEANT WAS CONVICTED OF PASSING SECRET 
NATO PLANS TO THE SOVIET BLOC.

In a case described as one of the most serious instances of treason in the 
post-World War II era, a West German court Wednesday sentenced a retired U.S. 
Army sergeant to life in prison for passing top-secret NATO battle plans to the 
Soviet Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Lee Conrad, 42, from Sebring, Ohio, was convicted of passing wartime 
deployment plans to East Bloc agents in such detail that Western defenses in 
Germany would have collapsed before they could even form, according to Justice 
Ferdinand Schuth of the Koblenz high court, which heard the case. 
</P>
<P>
Schuth said the information passed by Conrad to the Hungarian and Czechoslovak 
secret services "endangered the entire defense capability of the West." In the 
event of a Warsaw Pact attack, it could have forced North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization commanders almost immediately either to abandon the defense of 
West Germany or order the use of nuclear arms. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been no case of treason even remotely comparable in its 
seriousness," chief West German federal prosecutor Kurt Rebmann said during a 
summing-up last week. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad is believed to have been paid more than $1.2 million for the material, 
although no money has been found. In pronouncing sentence, Schuth described him 
as "ice cold and unscrupulous". 
</P>
<P>
The judgment followed a 24-day trial, in which the court reviewed over 5,000 
pages of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The former sergeant first class, white-haired and dressed in a dark sports coat 
and tie, was led away by police after the verdict. His lawyers said they will 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The seriousness of the security breaches caused by Conrad, who had a top-secret 
clearance and access to the most sensitive of NATO material in his job as an 
archive clerk at the U.S. Army's 8th Infantry Division headquarters in Bad 
Kreuznach, 50 miles southwest of Frankfurt, recalled an earlier spy scandal 
involving a U.S. Navy enlisted man, John Walker. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, a communications specialist, passed Moscow secret codes used by Navy 
vessels, enabling the Soviets to eavesdrop on highly sensitive Navy 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad, a Vietnam veteran described by those who knew him as friendly and 
modest in his manner, reportedly had 13 years in the service and a clean 
military record at the time he was granted his top secret clearance in 1978. 
However, court documents indicated that he had already established contact with 
Hungarian intelligence three years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The contact was made through Conrad's superior at the time, former U.S. Army 
Sergeant 1st Class Zoltan Szabo, who himself was convicted last year of spying 
by an Austrian court. Szabo cooperated with the prosecution by providing 
evidence against Conrad. 
</P>
<P>
Trial documents indicated that Conrad spied purely for financial gain, selling 
alliance documents relating to nuclear and conventional battle plans to East 
Bloc agents between 1975 and 1985, when he retired with an honorable discharge. 
In those 10 years, Conrad passed information pinpointing the locations of NATO 
unit deployments in time of crisis, their supply and ammunition dumps and the 
lines of communications. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested in August, 1988, in the West German city of Kaiserslautern, 
near Bad Kreuznach, where he lived with his German-born wife and 15-year-old 
son. 
</P>
<P>
His two Hungarian contacts, Imre and Sandor Kercsik, were arrested 
simultaneously in Gothenburg, Sweden, where they worked as physicians. The 
Kercsiks, who are brothers, either hand-carried the material back to Hungary or 
delivered it to the Hungarian Embassy in Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad also passed documents to Czechoslovak agents, for which he was sentenced 
separately to a four-year prison term.

5 EX-COMMUNIST LEADERS ARE DETAINED IN PRAGUE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Communist Party leader Milos Jakes and four other former high-ranking 
party officials were reported Wednesday to have been detained in connection 
with their roles in the Soviet-led invasion that wiped out this nation's 
"Prague Spring" reforms in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
All but one, according to Czechoslovak television, were questioned and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
The detentions, made public by the Czechoslovak news agency CTK, came two days 
before the first free elections here since 1946 but are not considered likely 
to have much of an impact on the electoral fortunes of the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
The voting will take place Friday and Saturday, and the Communists are widely 
expected to do poorly at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Detained along with Jakes was Vasil Bilak, the party's ideological chief, who 
has been regarded as the man who in 1968 invited the Soviet Union and the other 
Warsaw Pact powers to intervene. Bilak, who has denied this, was a powerful and 
influential figure in the party until the peaceful revolution that ousted the 
Communists from power last November. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency said Bilak was detained on suspicion of engaging in "serious 
criminal activity." It gave no reason for the other detentions. 
</P>
<P>
Also detained were former Premier Jozef Lenart and two former senior party 
officials, Michal Stefanak and Rudolf Hegenbart. Hegenbart was named last week 
in a BBC documentary as one of those who allegedly worked with the Soviet KGB 
to oust Jakes last November. 
</P>
<P>
Bilak was reportedly detained in Bratislava late Tuesday, but the agency did 
not say when the others were detained. The prosecutor's office said Bilak was 
held on a 48-hour investigation warrant and would be released. 
</P>
<P>
The television report said all five were being investigated for "suspicion of 
property machinations" and possible "currency violations," in addition to their 
roles in the 1968 invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Another hard-line Czechoslovak party official, Miroslav Stepan, has been in 
jail since December on charges of abuse of power. The former head of the secret 
police is also under arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Jakes presided over a major purge of the party after the 1968 invasion. For 
years he was second in command behind party leader Gustav Husak. Jakes 
succeeded Husak in 1987 and was in charge of the party when the changes 
sweeping through Eastern Europe reached Prague last November.

WARSAW PACT 'LOST ITS FUNCTION,' HUNGARIAN PRIME MINISTER ASSERTS

<P>
Prime Minister Joszef Antall headed Wednesday for a Warsaw Pact summit in 
Moscow after declaring that the Kremlin-led defense alliance has "lost its 
function" and should be abolished by the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
Antall said the military structure of the alliance violates Hungarian 
sovereignty and that his government has compiled a list of grievances to air at 
the East Bloc gathering in the wake of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
visit to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Antall also said Hungary will seek to renegotiate its 
economic agreements with Moscow to eliminate inequities imposed on it in the 
past. He did not give specifics. 
</P>
<P>
His statements indicated that the Moscow gathering of erstwhile allies may set 
in motion the pact's dismantling. 
</P>
<P>
Other newly democratized nations of Eastern Europe have also called for an end 
to the alliance, which has traditionally identified the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization as its adversary and deployed Soviet troops in East Germany, 
Czechoslovakia and Hungary. The restoration of democracy in Eastern Europe has 
encouraged better ties with Western Europe, putting into question the need for 
rival military organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary and Czechoslovakia have already agreed with the Kremlin on deadlines 
for withdrawal of the Soviet forces, and pressure for severing East German ties 
with the pact has mounted. 
</P>
<P>
Antall made clear that he will press for Hungarian autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
"We must urgently eliminate elements violating our sovereignty," he said, 
giving as examples the presence of foreign troops in Hungary, exercises 
requiring Hungarian army activity outside its national borders and foreign 
officers directing Hungarian forces. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has agreed to withdraw its remaining 50,000 soldiers by June, 
1991, but some Hungarian officials have suggested that tempo may be stepped up. 
</P>
<P>
"The Warsaw Treaty as a political organ of European confrontation is outdated. 
It has lost its function in the current Europe," Antall told reporters. 
"Therefore, we believe its military organization is not needed in the future 
and should be abolished by the end of 1991."

<P>
Offerings to the Hawaiian volcano goddess failed to save the Kalapana Store 
&amp; Drive-Inn, which succumbed Wednesday to lava flowing from Kilauea 
Volcano. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Walter Yamaguchi, 82, had proclaimed that his store would be untouched by 
the lava because of his special relationship with the volcano goddess Pele. 
</P>
<P>
But, before dawn, a lava finger extending from the flow engulfed the building, 
Civil Defense officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, what can you do?" Yamaguchi said. "Pele, she made me collect the 
insurance. If no burn, I don't collect." 
</P>
<P>
No other structures in the now-deserted community were hit Wednesday as lava 
continued to pour from the Kupaianaha vent at a rate of 650,000 cubic meters a 
day, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Lava flowed into the ocean near the site of the Puna Canoe Club.

IRAN-CONTRA: JAIL TERM IS SEEN AS A WARNING TO OTHER OFFICIALS. REAGAN'S FORMER 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER IS TO BE SENTENCED MONDAY.

Federal prosecutors Wednesday urged that John M. Poindexter, the 
highest-ranking official convicted in the Iran-Contra scandal, be sent to 
prison for feeding "a diet of lies" to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Although two other convicted former White House aides in the Ronald Reagan 
Administration have not been sentenced to serve time in prison, prosecutors 
cited special reasons why Poindexter should be punished by "a period of 
incarceration." 
</P>
<P>
In a sentencing memorandum filed in federal court, they stressed that, as 
Reagan's national security adviser, Poindexter had been Oliver L. North's 
superior. And, unlike Robert C. McFarlane, the other former White House aide 
convicted in the scandal, Poindexter never acknowledged that he had done 
anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The retired Navy vice admiral was convicted by a jury on April 7 of five 
charges of obstructing Congress. The jury found that he had lied about U.S. 
arms shipments to Iran and had covered up both the diversion of arms sale 
proceeds to Nicaraguan rebels and North's activities in supporting the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter, 53, who did not take the witness stand at his trial, faces a 
maximum sentence of 25 years in prison and fines of $1.25 million. He is 
appealing his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of Poindexter's obstruction in 1985 and 1986, Congress was 
investigating reports that the National Security Council -- and principally 
North -- had violated a congressional ban on direct and indirect military aid 
to the Contra forces, which were fighting the leftist Sandinista government of 
Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh and associate counsel Dan K. Webb said in 
the memorandum that the American system of government "relies fundamentally 
upon the exchange of truthful information" between the executive and 
legislative branches. 
</P>
<P>
"If, as occurred in this case, high-ranking officials of one branch of 
government feel free to feed the other branch a diet of lies, then the 
constitutional system will surely sicken and eventually die," they declared. 
</P>
<P>
"The sentence imposed must be adequate to punish the defendant for his criminal 
conduct and to warn other high-ranking public officials that criminal 
violations of the public trust will result in more than mere loss of public 
employment." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene, who is scheduled to sentence Poindexter 
on Monday, took the memo under advisement. Richard W. Beckler, Poindexter's 
attorney, refused to comment but will have an opportunity to address Greene 
before sentence is imposed. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, in videotaped testimony presented to the jury, acknowledged that he had 
authorized a secret sale of missiles to Iran in 1985 but said that he had not 
known about any diversion of funds. Reagan added that he did not authorize 
anyone to lie to Congress or to break any laws and did not believe, in fact, 
that any laws were violated. 
</P>
<P>
In view of Reagan's testimony, "there can be no serious argument in this case 
that the defendant is entitled to leniency because he was a mere subordinate," 
the prosecutors said, noting that North had contended at his own trial that he 
was following the orders of Poindexter and McFarlane, who preceded Poindexter 
as national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
"This defendant (Poindexter) occupied a position where his judgment was 
critical, and, in many instances -- if former President Reagan's deposition 
testimony is any guide -- final," their memorandum concluded. 
</P>
<P>
North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel who was compelled by prosecutors to 
testify at Poindexter's trial, was convicted last year of three felonies in the 
scandal and was sentenced to two years' probation, fined $150,000 and ordered 
to perform 1,200 hours of community service in a drug education program for 
youths. 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane, who pleaded guilty in 1988 to four misdemeanor charges of 
withholding information from Congress, received a sentence of two years' 
probation, $20,000 in fines and 200 hours of community service.

BUDGET SUMMIT RESUMES, TARGETS PENTAGON

Congressional and Bush Administration negotiators Wednesday after a 10-day 
break resumed their efforts to shrink the federal budget deficit, with their 
five-hour meeting focusing on Pentagon spending. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told reporters after attending the session that 
he agreed to work with congressional specialists to estimate the budgetary 
impact of cutting troops and weapons by 25% over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be looking at various options," Cheney said, adding that no one would be 
bound in advance to support any such reduction in the number of ships, planes 
and Army divisions. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-five per cent seems like a reasonable number to look at, given the 
reduced threat," Cheney said. But lawmakers have warned that a 25% cut in 
forces does not necessarily add up to a 25% cut in the Defense Department's 
$300-billion budget -- the target set in a House-passed budget resolution.

LAWMAKERS CITE $100 BILLION IN FEDERAL 'SLUSH FUNDS'; 
</P>

BUDGET: A STUDY FINDS DEPARTMENTS ACCUMULATE APPROPRIATED BUT UNSPENT MONEY. 
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS SAY THE PRACTICE ALLOWS FLEXIBILITY.

Sensing a threat to their congressional powers and a potential for abuse, House 
members Wednesday accused the Defense Department and 12 other agencies of 
maintaining "slush funds" totaling $100 billion that can be tapped without 
Congress' consent. 
</P>
<P>
Results of a congressional investigation released Wednesday found that every 
federal department and agency has amassed "merged accounts" -- so-called M 
accounts -- money appropriated for specific programs but never spent. The 
Defense Department leads the pack, having accrued more than $50 billion in such 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
Those financial leftovers from yearly appropriations have been used since 1956 
by departments and agencies -- particularly the Pentagon -- to pay off 
unforeseen cost overruns on contract commitments. 
</P>
<P>
During Wednesday's meeting between two House subcommittees, lawmakers contended 
that executive branch departments are abusing this power -- by independently 
using the funds not just to cover debts on items for which the appropriations 
were approved, as the law intended, but to expand programs. 
</P>
<P>
Also, they expressed concern that the M accounts are poorly documented and 
vulnerable to abuse -- not only by departments looking to circumvent 
congressionally mandated budget limits but by individual employees seeking to 
cheat the Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
However, three financial officials from the Defense, Energy and Health and 
Human Services departments testified that the M accounts do not act as slush 
funds laundered through the Treasury Department, as the bipartisan collection 
of House members contended. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration officials emphasized that the "funds" are more precisely 
"budget authority" granted by Congress -- the power to go to the Treasury and 
demand a check to cover cost overruns on previously authorized projects. 
</P>
<P>
They maintained that killing the M accounts would deny departments the 
flexibility they need to adjust for unforeseen costs on multiyear projects. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce F. Chafin, a House special aide who led the congressional investigation, 
told the subcommittees that, in one case, an employee at the Agency for 
International Development complained to his superiors that they were not 
watching how the budget authority was being used. AID currently has an M 
account that totals $11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The employee's superiors did not respond, Chafin said, so he took advantage of 
the laxness by filing $1.4 million in phony expenses and travel vouchers. He is 
in prison today only because the fruits of his M account embezzlement -- 
including a luxurious home, five cars, a pool and a gazebo -- aroused 
suspicions, the subcommittees were told. 
</P>
<P>
The House investigator cited the findings of a recent Defense Department 
report: "M account policy is incomplete, inconsistently interpreted and 
implemented and inadequately enforced." 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers focused much of their concern on agencies that use the funds in 
ways Congress never intended. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the investigators noted that the Air Force last year gave more 
than $500 million in M account funds to a contractor that had supplied faulty 
avionics for the B-1B bomber. That expenditure for the controversial strategic 
bomber went beyond the scope of the original contract and should not have been 
made without congressional authorization, House members charged. 
</P>
<P>
"No one ever envisioned that these accounts would grow into a 
hundred-billion-dollar fund spread across the various federal agencies which 
could be drawn upon whenever (an) agency concludes that these monies could be 
used to fund obligations 'within the scope' of existing contracts," Chafin 
said.

THE NOVEMBER MATCHUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Governor: U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, in the shadows while the Democrats fought each 
other for their party's nomination, now steps forward as he and former San 
Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein head toward the November general election. One 
of them will become California's 36th governor. Voters will hear similar 
positions from the candidates on issues such as abortion and the death penalty. 
Leadership and experience will be key points of contention. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Governor: A spirited Republican primary ended with state Sen. Marian 
Bergeson winning the right to face incumbent Leo T. McCarthy, who is seeking 
his third term. Abortion rights -- she is opposed and he favors -- are likely 
to be an issue, as is his proposal for a sales tax hike to fight illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney General: With John K. Van de Kamp leaving office, California will 
elect a new attorney general in November. San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith 
will represent the Democrats, and former Rep. Daniel E. Lungren is the 
Republican nominee. The two have starkly different views on issues ranging from 
abortion rights to offshore oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
Treasurer: Republican Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes fought back a challenge within 
his own party and now he faces a Democrat, Kathleen Brown. Hayes is expected to 
portray himself as the non-politican, while Brown -- daughter of one former 
governor and sister of another -- capitalizes on her political connections. 
They disagree on state investment policies. 
</P>
<P>
Controller: Matt Fong, whose principle claim to fame is that he is the son of 
Secretary of State March Fong Eu, had no opposition in the Republican primary 
in his first run for public office. In November, he is the underdog, facing 
incumbent Gray Davis, who is seeking his second term. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance Commissioner: Democrat John Garamendi and Republican Wes Bannister 
came out of crowded fields to capture their party nominations. Garamendi, the 
favorite, is expected to argue that an insurance agent like Bannister should 
not hold the insurance office; Bannister will argue the reverse, that the 
office needs someone with the experience in insurance that he offers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AROUND THE STATE 
</P>
<P>
37th Congressional District: TV actor-turned-politician Ralph Waite, best known 
as "Pa" on "The Waltons," is betting that his Hollywood connections and 
homespun image will help him topple veteran Republican incumbent Al McCandless. 
But Waite, a Democrat, will have a tough row to hoe in the Riverside County 
district, long dominated by GOP voters. 
</P>
<P>
8th State Senate District: Four years ago, Quentin L. Kopp defied political 
convention by winning election as an independent in this San Francisco 
district. He is aiming to repeat his feat this November against both Democratic 
and Republican foes. 
</P>
<P>
34th State Senate District: Former Chino Mayor Ruben S. Ayala became the first 
Latino elected to the state Senate in modern times in 1974. But Republican 
Assemblyman Charles Bader of Pomona is expected to give Ayala his toughest 
reelection fight in this east Los Angeles County-west San Bernardino County 
district. 
</P>
<P>
41st Assembly District: Republican Pat Nolan of Glendale, the former Assembly 
GOP leader, continues to labor under the cloud of the FBI's probe of Capitol 
corruption and could yet be indicted. If he is, Democrat Jeanette Mann, a 
Pasadena Community College trustee, could mount a credible campaign to unseat 
him. 
</P>
<P>
72nd Assembly District: Republican Curt Pringle's win in this Orange County 
district two years ago was shrouded in controversy because of charges that 
"poll watchers" his campaign hired intimidated Latinos from voting. His 
Democratic foe this year, Tom Umberg, hopes that furor, plus strong financial 
backing from abortion rights activists, will propel him to victory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ISSUES 
</P>
<P>
Environment -- Four initiatives affecting the environment are headed for the 
November ballot. The most wide-ranging measure is "Big Green," sponsored by 
environmentalists and Atty. Gen. Van de Kamp to eliminate cancer-causing 
pesticides in food, protect the ozone layer, preserve redwood forests and 
protect the coast from oil spills. A second measure sponsored by 
environmentalists would go even further to protect the state's ancient redwood 
forests from timber harvesting. A rival initiative backed by the agriculture 
and chemical industries would take more moderate steps to reduce pesticide use. 
And another rival measure sponsored by the timber industry would allow logging 
to continue with few restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Alcohol -- Law enforcement, consumer and anti-alcohol abuse groups are 
sponsoring an initiative that would raise the tax on alcoholic beverages by a 
nickel a drink. The measure would raise an estimated $730 million for a variety 
of health care, alcohol abuse and law enforcement programs. The alcohol 
industry, in an effort to undercut the proposed tax increase, is pushing the 
Legislature to put a rival proposition on the November ballot calling for a 
smaller tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Ethics -- Voters will again consider the ethics issue with an initiative 
sponsored by Van de Kamp to adopt public financing of campaigns and put a 
12-year limit on the time legislators can stay in office. It also contains 
restrictions on legislators' outside income similar to the provisions of 
Proposition 112, the ethics measure approved by the voters Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Crime -- Voters also will see a third measure sponsored by Van de Kamp. This 
one would create a superfund to pay for law enforcement, drug education and 
treatment and new prisons for drug offenders. The measure would be financed 
partly by eliminating tax breaks for corporations. In a move designed to 
protect women's right to abortion, the measure also would reinstitute 
right-to-privacy language eliminated by Wilson's successful Proposition 115 on 
Tuesday's ballot.

TRANSPORTATION GEARS UP FOR REVIVAL;

<P>
PROPOSITIONS: APPROVAL OF THREE BALLOT MEASURES WILL ADD $18.5 BILLION FOR 
CONSTRUCTION OVER 10 YEARS.

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's moribund transportation business came back to life Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Voter approval of Propositions 108, 111 and 116 guarantees that at least $18.5 
billion in new money will be available for highway and transit construction 
over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major turnaround," Caltrans Director Robert K. Best declared at a 
press conference here. "This will require us to gear up and we will be gearing 
up quickly . . . so the people who have expressed their trust in government (by 
voting for the measures) will be seeing projects out on the road." 
</P>
<P>
Best said Caltrans will ask the California Transportation Commission to approve 
$257 million in backlogged projects when the commission meets in Sacramento 
next week. He said construction on some of these stalled projects could begin 
within three months. 
</P>
<P>
The Caltrans director also said passage of Proposition 111 assured completion 
as scheduled in 1993 of the Century Freeway and Harbor Transitway in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next year Caltrans should receive almost $1 billion in new revenue -- 
about $635 million from Proposition 111, which increases the gasoline tax and 
truck weight fees, and another $300 million from Proposition 108, one of the 
two rail bond issues approved Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Best said some of this money will be used to hire about 1,000 new engineers and 
other workers and to enter into contracts with 200 private consultants. 
</P>
<P>
The new money and new personnel will enable Caltrans to restore its financially 
starved construction program, while at the same time continuing the earthquake 
retrofitting that is being financed by a special statewide quarter-cent sales 
tax increase, the director said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to approving Proposition 111, which is expected to yield $15.5 
billion over 10 years, and Proposition 108, a $1-billion mass transit bond 
issue, voters also passed Proposition 116, a $1.9-billion rail bond measure 
that was placed on the ballot by the Planning and Conservation League. The 
gasoline tax will go up 5 cents Aug. 1 and then rise 1 cent annually for four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The task of deciding how much of this new money should be spent on highways, 
how much on urban transit systems, how much on new or improved intercity rail 
service will fall largely to the California Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Hathaway, chief deputy director of the commission, said the group's first 
job will be to eliminate more than $500 million worth of projects that have 
been "on the shelf" for several months because of lack of money. 
</P>
<P>
Once these have been funded, Hathaway said, the commission will start work on a 
new seven-year State Transportation Improvement Plan (STIP). This will include 
about $5 billion in new spending -- $3 billion for mass transit and $2 billion 
for highways. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also must integrate Proposition 116, which calls for specific 
rail projects, with Proposition 108, which does not. 
</P>
<P>
Best was vague about Caltrans' rail plans, beyond saying that improved service 
through the San Joaquin Valley would be a "high priority." 
</P>
<P>
Although current legislation calls for another $1-billion mass transit bond 
issue in 1992, and a third in 1994, the Caltrans director suggested that the 
Legislature might decide to drop these two bond measures now that the 
$1.9-billion Proposition 116 has been approved.

POTENTIAL L.A. CHALLENGERS ANALYZING FARRELL'S LOSS;

<P>
48TH DISTRICT: HOPEFULS FOR HIS CITY COUNCIL SEAT ARE NOW LOOKING FOR SIGNS OF 
A POLITICAL WOUNDING.

<P>
Just hours after Robert Farrell's stunning loss to Marguerite Archie-Hudson in 
the 48th Assembly District Democratic primary election Tuesday, potential 
challengers for his seat on the Los Angeles City Council were analyzing the 
race, looking for signs of a political wounding. 
</P>
<P>
With Farrell having to face voters in just 10 months -- he has indicated that 
he will run for a fifth consecutive term representing the 8th Council District 
-- friend and foe alike were eager to know just what the defeat will mean for a 
politician seen by some as already vulnerable on his own turf. Farrell did not 
have to give up his council seat to run for the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell, after his concession speech Tuesday night, brushed off questions about 
how theloss might affect his political future. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would try to retain his council seat, he responded, "Why wouldn't 
I?" 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, said the outcome of the primary may have hurt him. 
</P>
<P>
"It may mean the voters showed a lack of confidence in his leadership abilities 
and decided he didn't deserve a promotion to Sacramento," said community 
activist Kerman Maddox, who has already formed a committee to study his chances 
in a run for the 8th District seat. 
</P>
<P>
The huge size of Farrell's loss to Archie-Hudson -- 15 percentage points -- 
shows, Maddox said, that there may be "a continued erosion" of Farrell's 
support in the 8th, which makes up about a third of the 48th Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the voters gave Archie-Hudson 9,724 votes (45% of the total) to 
Farrell's 6,563 (30.3%). 
</P>
<P>
Mark Ridley-Thomas, a Farrell supporter in the primary who was considering 
running in the April, 1991, 8th Council District race had Farrell won Tuesday, 
said he is now presented "with a new set of dynamics." 
</P>
<P>
"What has to happen now is a serious analysis of the 8th District proper," said 
Ridley-Thomas, executive director of the local chapter of the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference. 
</P>
<P>
His candidacy, he said, will now "depend on whether the voters were saying we 
prefer (Farrell) being a councilperson rather than an assemblyman" or something 
else. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers, however, said there was little ambiguity in the voters' 
message. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell has "been sent a shot across the bow," veteran political analyst Joe 
Cerrell said. "He has a warning: 'You better start working now real hard for 
reelection.' " 
</P>
<P>
Cerrell said it did not help that questions arose late in the race about 
whether Farrell lives in the 48th District. 
</P>
<P>
However, Cerrell said he did not view the blow to Farrell as fatal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a person who has a mild heart attack. It's not a good thing, but it 
gives you a warning. I think he (will get) reelected." 
</P>
<P>
Farrell's campaign manager, Marcella Howell, said: "Lots of people try for 
higher office and lose, but in my experience rarely does that affect their 
incumbency in another office."

THE HAHN NAME WORKS ITS MAGIC IN A LONG-SHOT RUN FOR ASSESSOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He's a political novice, but one lucky enough to have a time-honored name in 
local politics. 
</P>
<P>
And now, Kenneth P. Hahn -- no relation to the prominent, and popular, Los 
Angeles County supervisor of the same name -- suddenly finds himself solidly in 
a runoff with incumbent John J. Lynch to be the next county assessor. 
</P>
<P>
"You're kidding?" Hahn asked when early election night results showed him 
running neck-and-neck with his boss at the sleepy assessor's office. But as the 
trend continued through the night, Hahn, a mid-level manager under Lynch, 
realized that the odds for what had started as a long-shot chance at victory 
were narrowing fast. 
</P>
<P>
In a fluke of democracy -- and on the strength of the Hahn name -- he was 
squarely in the race for the $130,000 a year job, overseeing a staff of 1,600 
that determines the tax bills for 2.2 million properties. 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday morning, the reality of his unusual showing was clear -- even 
through Hahn's bleary eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mess, a madhouse," groaned Hahn, 50, in an early morning phone call. "I 
haven't been to bed yet. People keep calling, TV's on the other line. . . . 
Damn, there goes the phone again." 
</P>
<P>
So began the political baptism of Kenneth P. Hahn, possibly the next Los 
Angeles County assessor. His strong showing, which Hahn and a host of political 
observers acknowledge was due in large part to the name confusion, means that 
for the first time in recent history, a sitting assessor has been forced into a 
runoff for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
In the primary election for the nonpartisan assessor's post, a candidate must 
draw 50% of the vote to win outright. If no candidate receives a majority, the 
top two finishers face off in November. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch, with 29.6% of the vote, and Hahn, with 28.2%, dominated the field of 
seven competitors on Tuesday's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Tax attorney Jay Curtis, whom Lynch had figured to be his toughest competition, 
drew just 16.6% of the vote. The remaining candidates, most of whom are now 
backing Hahn, drew in single digits. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hahn name was the wild card in this race," said Lynch in reviewing the 
election results. 
</P>
<P>
But the assessor said he prefers to face Hahn in a runoff, because "the real 
Kenny Hahn endorsed me and once people know that, it will be easy." 
</P>
<P>
"The name 'Hahn' is a good name, even after 43 years" in politics, said 
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who has served on the board since 1952 and was earlier 
a member of the Los Angeles City Council. "I'm sure my son will love to hear 
about this." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn, said: "There's magic in the Hahn 
name. . . . I know how I got elected city controller" in his first run at 
political office in 1981. "The Hahn name really carried me. It still carries a 
strong feeling in this town." 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes the magic works, and sometimes it doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Supervisor Hahn's older brother, Gordon, ran against Lynch for the 
assessor's post and was soundly defeated. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't figure why (the Hahn name) didn't help Gordon," said James Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch, who has wrested with both Hahn candidates, has a theory on that. "The 
last name isn't operative in politics," said Lynch. "You need the whole handle. 
And my opponent this time is blessed with that name." Joe Gardner, a retired 
county administrator, has had the misfortune to lose to both Kenneth Hahns. 
Gardner lost to the supervisor in 1988 and to assessor's candidate Hahn on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just too much name ID to overcome," he sighed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something you can't buy," City Atty. Hahn said about the vote-garnering 
ability of his father's name. 
</P>
<P>
But if a politician could purchase the Hahn handle, it might carry a hefty 
price tag. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch's campaign spent more than $160,000 leading up to Tuesday's balloting, 
while Hahn spent less than $5,000 to gather nearly the same number of votes. 
</P>
<P>
Candidate Hahn acknowledges that name confusion did come up during the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I went and spoke to one group . . . and a woman asked me, 'How is your 
father?' " he said. "I said he has been deceased for 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
But the candidate also says that he deserves some credit for having run a 
tough, grass-roots campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel the people have been able to sort through the hoopla," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn, educated as a biologist, has been with the assessor's office for 10 
years, after careers as a chemist, social worker and credit union executive. 
</P>
<P>
Upon joining county government in 1980, Hahn nearly took a job in the animal 
control office, but at the last minute opted for an offer from the assessor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Hahn is an appraiser specialist, a mid-management position paying 
$42,000. The post is just slightly senior to the deputy assessor position that 
Lynch held before his 1986 election.

CITY MAY CUT BUDGETS TO PAY FOR COSTS OF PROP. H; 
</P>
<P>
ETHICS PACKAGE: BRADLEY, COUNCIL MUST FIND $5 MILLION TO FUND THE PROGRAM AND 
THE RAISES APPROVED BY VOTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
City officials on Wednesday began searching for $5 million to pay for the 
ethics package and salary increases approved by the voters on Tuesday, and said 
the money may have to come from 1% budget cuts in most city departments. 
Although the money must be set aside now, it will be months, and in some cases 
years, before all of the far-ranging provisions of Proposition H take effect. 
</P>
<P>
The ballot measure was approved Tuesday by a 56.67% to 43.32% vote, a margin 
that surprised many backers who feared that voters would balk at the entire 
measure because pay raises were attached. 
</P>
<P>
"Just as we find money for every other high-priority item in this city's 
budget, we will find the money to finance this program," Mayor Tom Bradley said 
Wednesday. "The people have spoken and we are required by law now to find that 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the council's Budget and Finance 
Committee, said Wednesday an attempt will be made to avoid cuts in the fire, 
police and sanitation department budgets, but the budgets of most other city 
departments will have to be tapped to fund the measure. Yaroslavsky had opposed 
the proposition, but said Wednesday he will work to have it implemented. Under 
the provisions of the measure, partial public financing of political campaigns 
and limits on campaign spending will first affect the 1993 election, but will 
not be in place for the municipal election next spring. 
</P>
<P>
The new city ethics code contained in the package takes effect next Jan. 1, but 
officials will have at least six months after that before they have to file the 
thorough new financial disclosure statements required by Proposition H. The 
total ban on outside jobs for elected officials also begins in January. 
</P>
<P>
But pay raises that City Council members inserted in the package for 
themselves, the mayor and other city officials take effect as soon as the 
election results are certified by the secretary of state, a process that is 
expected to take about 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
The pay raises will cost the city $213,000 in the coming fiscal year and 
$426,000 the following year. Council members will get 40% pay increases, 
raising their salaries to $86,157, the level of Municipal Court judges. In the 
future, their pay rates will be tied to those of Municipal Court judges. The 
mayor will get a 9.2% pay raise, making his salary $112,004, 30% higher than 
Municipal Court judges' pay. His pay also will rise according to the judges' 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said last February that he would give his raise to charity, but on 
Wednesday he appeared to hedge on the offer. Asked at a press conference 
whether he would accept the raise, Bradley did not answer, but said he would 
review the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Drafters of the package said Wednesday that the composition of the new city 
Ethics Commission authorized by Proposition H is the key to making the reforms 
work. The five-member board, which will determine how the law is implemented 
and enforced, is to be in place by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge will be assembling an aggressive panel that will be free of 
compromising political or business ties to City Hall, backers said. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of victory is not self-enforcing," said Geoffrey Cowan, the head of 
the citizens commission that helped draft the measure. "The next job is to get 
the right people . . . to make sure it is implemented and enforced as 
aggressively as this law deserves." 
</P>
<P>
Art Snyder, an influential lobbyist and former city councilman, warned 
Wednesday that the commission could hurt local government. 
</P>
<P>
"It just comes down to what kind of attitude is going to be expressed by the 
ethics commission," Snyder said. "If it turns out to be an inquisition, they 
can certainly burn politicians at the stake. . . . If we do enough of this, no 
competent person will run for office in the city of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley will appoint its president and another member, and one member each will 
be appointed by City Atty. James K. Hahn, City Controller Rick Tuttle and City 
Council President John Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro was out of town Wednesday and the others said they had not decided on 
their appointees. 
</P>
<P>
But proponents of the measure and knowledgeable city officials said potential 
appointees include Michael Josephson, who runs a nonprofit ethics institute in 
Marina del Rey; Walter Zelman, a former state Common Cause executive director 
who lost a bid Tuesday for state insurance commissioner; and Cruz Reynoso, a 
former state Supreme Court justice. 
</P>
<P>
Other possible nominees are Herbert Alexander, director of USC's Citizens' 
Research Foundation and a campaign finance consultant; Tracy Westen, executive 
director of the nonprofit California Commission of Campaign Finance; Occidental 
College President John Slaughter; and Ignacio Lozano, editor of the Spanish 
language La Opinion newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who legally cannot serve are Cowan and other members of the ethics 
panel that drafted Proposition H.

DEPUTY A 'HERO' FOR PERSISTENCE IN HIT-RUN CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a haunting hit-and-run case, Sheriff's Deputy Guy Van Sickle remembers, 
the kind he just couldn't get out of his mind. 
</P>
<P>
A young Mexican immigrant, working seven days a week to save up enough money to 
buy a truck, had been killed March 24 when a car ran a red light and hit him 
broadside as he bicycled across Hawthorne Boulevard in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, 24-year-old Jorge Rodelo, was dragged beneath the car for more than 
100 feet, severing one of his legs and strewing bicycle and car parts along the 
street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A witness told police that the car's driver continued on for more than a 
quarter-mile before he pulled over, yanked Rodelo's bicycle loose from the 
front of his car, and sped away. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with a partial description of the car and its driver, Van Sickle began 
patrolling his beat, keeping a special eye out for gold-colored Firebirds and 
Camaros. On Wednesday, his efforts paid off when Torrance police arrested a 
suspect based on information Van Sickle provided about a car he had stopped on 
May 13. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators now believe that John Tupeona Tago, 26, of Wilmington, was 
driving the gold 1972 Pontiac Firebird that struck and killed Rodelo. Tago 
reportedly had borrowed the car for the day from his brother -- who apparently 
was driving the car when it was stopped by Van Sickle. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Tago, who does not yet have a lawyer, has denied any 
involvement in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
After being notified on Tuesday that police had a warrant for his arrest, Tago 
agreed to surrender Wednesday morning. He was being held in lieu of $11,000 
bail and is scheduled to be arraigned on one count of felony hit-and-run 
driving and one count of misdemeanor manslaughter today. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest follows an eight-week search by Van Sickle -- who made the case a 
priority even though it was not officially a Sheriff's Department 
investigation. He learned of the fatal accident after it was reported over 
police radio. 
</P>
<P>
For roughly two months, the Lomita sheriff's deputy stayed on the alert as he 
cruised, checking cars in his rear-view mirror for signs of front-end damage 
and stopping at least 10 cars for a closer look and a chat with the driver. 
Though each possibility fell through, Van Sickle refused to give up. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the principle of it that got to me, I guess," Van Sickle explained 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"A crime like this, it sticks with me," he said. "I felt for (Rodelo) and his 
family and I guess I felt anger toward the guy who did it. He willfully took 
off. He knew what he was doing. He hit this guy and just kept on going. . . . I 
just kept looking, every day." 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Police Officer Dale Robbins, who investigated the case, said he might 
never have found a suspect without Van Sickle's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"He's our hero in this," Robbins said. "That deputy made the case for us. For 
him to have beaten the bush and read the teletypes. . . . We weren't getting 
anywhere until he brought our attention to this car." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said broken car parts found at the scene of the accident, including a 
portion of a car's front grill, matched pieces missing from the impounded 
Firebird. He said lab technicians also found bits of fabric stuck to the car's 
undercarriage that matched clothing worn by Rodelo on the day he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
"The grill piece just fit right in there, like a missing piece from a puzzle," 
Robbins said. "So we knew we had the right car. . . . We had to figure out who 
was driving it." 
</P>
<P>
Police took photos of Tago, his brother and four men not related to the case 
and showed the six pictures to the man who witnessed the accident. He 
identified Tago as the driver he saw hit Rodelo, Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
Tago "has been cooperative, but he will not admit to the accident," Robbins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodelo's family said they are pleased that police did not give up on the case. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to find the guy so that nothing would happen to another family 
like (what) happened to this family," said Mayra Rodriguez, 20, one of Rodelo's 
cousins. "Nothing is going to bring (Rodelo) back, but we want justice." 
</P>
<P>
She said her cousin was a quiet, hard-working man who had been an elementary 
school teacher in Mexicali, Mexico, before a teacher's strike there led him to 
move to Harbor City two years ago. He had been taking English classes at Harbor 
College in Wilmington, preparing to be a teacher here. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Rodelo had been working two jobs -- five days as a 
gasket-maker at a Torrance engineering firm and two days at a Redondo Beach 
coffee shop as a cook -- to save up for a new truck. He was $200 short of his 
goal when he was killed, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
He habitually sent a portion of his earnings back to his mother and two younger 
brothers in Mexico to help support them, Rodriguez said. Last year, he bought 
an old station wagon and drove it to Mexicali to give to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"He was working so hard, taking care of everyone," she said, starting to cry 
softly. 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of human could do this? (The driver) even stopped the car to get the 
bike (out of the way). . . . How could someone do something like this?"

1ST DISTRICT RIVALS HOPE ELECTION WILL STAND; 
</P>
<P>
SUPERVISORS: SARAH FLORES WILL ASK JUDGE NOT TO THROW OUT RESULTS. GREGORY 
O'BRIEN, HER OPPONENT IN THE NOVEMBER RUNOFF, ALSO WILL ATTEND HEARING.

Instead of walking precincts today, rivals in the runoff for Los Angeles 
County's 1st District supervisorial seat will be sitting in a federal courtroom 
hoping that a judge will not throw out Tuesday's election results. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Flores, seeking to become the first Latino on the Board of Supervisors, 
said Wednesday that she will petition U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon to 
allow her to argue that the election results should be allowed to stand. Her 
opponent in the November runoff, Superior Court Judge Gregory O'Brien, also 
plans to attend, but only as an observer. 
</P>
<P>
County lawyers plan to argue that Flores' first-place finish in a 10-candidate 
race is evidence that a Latino has a shot at winning a seat on the five-member 
board. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were arguing the county's case, that is an argument I would put forward," 
O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the election was clouded by an election-eve decision 
invalidating the county's district lines. Ironically, Kenyon ruled that the 
all-Anglo supervisors in 1981 drew political boundaries that were designed to 
keep Latinos off the board. The county plans to appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
In the race to succeed retiring Supervisor Pete Schabarum in the 1st District, 
Flores finished with 34.69% of the vote. Next was the Schabarum-backed O'Brien, 
who received 20.1%, followed by Bob Bartlett, mayor of Monrovia, with 11.7%, 
and former Congressman Jim Lloyd with 9.7%. Other candidates were back in the 
pack. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3rd District race, Supervisor Ed Edelman easily defeated his lone 
challenger, Gonzalo Molina. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs in the redistricting suit -- the U.S. Justice Department and 
civil rights groups -- want the results of both elections thrown out and a 
special election held under a new redistricting plan. Judge Kenyon scheduled a 
hearing on the matter for today. 
</P>
<P>
Flores and O'Brien were not waiting for the outcome of the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates, who live eight doors apart in Glendora, were on the phone early 
Wednesday seeking the endorsements of the also-rans in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Though she had never run for political office, Flores, 52, assistant chief 
deputy to Schabarum, put together a sophisticated political operation, with 
help from Supervisors Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana. 
</P>
<P>
The two supervisors saw in Flores an opportunity to settle the redistricting 
lawsuit and hold on to conservative control of the board. Flores is a 
Republican. Antonovich and Dana steered campaign contributors Flores' way, 
helping her to become the top fund-raiser with nearly $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
Flores also hired Ron Smith, a veteran political consultant who engineered the 
then-unknown Dana's 1980 election to the board. Smith oversaw Flores' public 
appearances, while Allan Hoffenblum, another veteran political consultant, 
directed her aggressive mail campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Some losing candidates said Flores, who has worked for Schabarum for 18 years, 
benefited from her boss' decision to endorse O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete helped Sarah by insulting her," said Pomona Councilwoman Nell Soto, who 
finished fifth. "It got her sympathy." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said, "She won the election because she knows the community like no one 
else." 
</P>
<P>
At Flores' campaign office, volunteers answered the phone "Sarah Flores Victory 
Headquarters." Said Flores, "We can't just sit and rest; the fight has not 
ended." 
</P>
<P>
She said she did not believe the redistricting suit would hamper her ability to 
raise money. "I was able to be the front-runner by raising the money that I did 
-- but that was always with the decision hanging over us." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, 44, who serves as a judge in Pomona, received an early-morning call 
Wednesday from Schabarum offering political advice. "He told me don't sit back 
on your laurels," O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien expressed doubt that the judge would throw out the results. "Judge 
Kenyon had the obvious opportunity to enjoin the registrar from counting the 
votes if he were terribly interested in that approach as a remedy," O'Brien 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos represent one-third of the county's population, but no Latino has ever 
been elected to the powerful five-member board. The plaintiffs have contended 
that even if a Latino wins in the existing districts, it does not resolve the 
issues that prompted the case, notably that Latinos are denied an opportunity 
to elect a candidate of their choice to the board. 
</P>
<P>
"We want a district drawn around an entire community, not the community split 
in half," said Richard Larson, legal director for the Mexican American Legal 
Defense and Educational Fund, one of the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleged that the supervisors deliberately split Latino 
neighborhoods in East Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Valley among the 1st, 2nd 
and 3rd districts to dilute Latino voting strength.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JACKSON DIAGNOSED WITH RIB CAGE 
INFLAMMATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ailing superstar Michael Jackson is suffering from an inflammation of the rib 
cage, but was expected to be released from the hospital within two days to 
continue his recovery at home, his publicist said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Grammy-winning singer underwent extensive testing at St. John's 
Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica after entering the emergency room 
Sunday with chest pains. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Jones, spokesman for the singer, said Jackson was diagnosed as having 
costochondritis, a condition that results in cartilage inflammation of the 
front part of the ribs. It can be caused by overexertion and stress, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson should be back to work within seven to 10 days, Jones said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FORM SHOWS MENENDEZES' FRIEND BOUGHT 
SHOTGUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two days before the savage slayings of entertainment executive Jose Menendez 
and his wife, Kitty, last August in Beverly Hills, two shotguns were purchased 
from a San Diego sporting goods store by a young man who identified himself as 
Donovan Jay Goodreau, a former Princeton roommate of the victims' son, Lyle. 
</P>
<P>
According to a federal firearms transaction form released Wednesday, a person 
identifying himself as Goodreau paid cash for two 12-gauge Mossbergs, costing 
$213.99 each, at a Big 5 store Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say this type of gun was used in the killings Aug. 20, but the 
murder weapons have not been found. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Lyle Menendez and his brother, Erik, who are charged with the 
murders, had tried to block the document's release. Authorities are still 
seeking to identify the signature on the form. 
</P>
<P>
Goodreau, who could not be reached for comment, reportedly maintains that his 
driver's license -- used for identification -- was stolen and that he was not 
in California at the time.

MEXICAN POLICE HAD ROLES IN COCAINE TRADE, WITNESS SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: A SHADOWY FIGURE WHO IS NOW A GOVERNMENT-PAID INFORMANT CLAIMS STATE AND 
FEDERAL AGENCIES IN GUADALAJARA WERE INVOLVED IN TRAFFICKING IN THE 1980S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A prosecution witness in the Enrique Camarena murder trial testified in Los 
Angeles Wednesday that officials of several Mexican government agencies in 
Guadalajara were enmeshed in drug trafficking in the early and mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony in U.S. District Court was given by Victor Lorenzo Harrison, a 
shadowy figure who is now a government-paid informant. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison, 50, said that he had set up radio communications systems for both 
federal and state police agencies in Mexico and that he had created and 
installed sophisticated radio systems for Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo and Rafael 
Caro Quintero, two of Mexico's leading drug traffickers. Both men currently are 
serving prison terms in Mexico for their involvement in the 1985 torture and 
murder of Camarena, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent who had been 
probing their narcotics operations in Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
Four men are currently on trial here, charged with involvement in Camarena's 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison presented perhaps the most lurid picture yet in the four-week trial of 
the interrelationship between drug lords and Mexican law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Fonseca and many of his assistants had credentials from one or 
more of Mexico's law enforcement agencies and that other leading traffickers 
and their henchmen had police credentials as well. He also said that he had 
once seen traffickers use a Mexican police credential to snort cocaine at a 
party at Fonseca's house. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison said that he had lived at Fonseca's house for several months in 1983 
and 1984 and that he had seen major drug traffickers visit the house for 
meetings. He said that law enforcement personnel frequently attended parties at 
Fonseca's house. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by defense attorney Edward Medvene, Harrison admitted that he 
never saw defendant Ruben Zuno Arce at any of those meetings. 
</P>
<P>
However, the 6-foot 7-inch witness said that he saw Zuno embrace Caro at a 
Guadalajara party in 1983 and added that Caro, who had been riding on a 
specially trained dancing horse at the party and smoking a "cocaine-base 
cigarette," got off the horse and embraced Zuno. Zuno has denied knowing Caro. 
</P>
<P>
On cross-examination, Medvene asked Harrison if he had ever reported to Mexican 
law enforcement officials that he had seen Zuno and Caro embracing. "I wouldn't 
know who to report it to," Harrison responded. 
</P>
<P>
Medvene then asked Harrison: "Are you saying everyone in Mexico is corrupt?" 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone I met and everyone I saw," the witness responded. ". . . The law 
enforcement apparatus and the army apparatus were all together in this (drug 
trafficking) operation." 
</P>
<P>
Harrison said that he had decided to become a government witness last September 
after he had received several overtures from a Mexican government official 
whose name he declined to state. Harrison said the official had been asked to 
approach him by Antonio Garate Bustamante, a veteran DEA operative, who 
recently has been enmeshed in controversy as the architect of the April 2 
kidnaping of a Mexican doctor who has been indicted in the Camarena case. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison said he had known Garate since 1981. At that time, Harrison said, he 
installed an electronic system at Garate's Guadalajara home when Garate headed 
the Guadalajara police SWAT team. Later, Harrison testified, at Garate's 
request he had helped set up a radio communications system to aid Colombian 
planes land in Mexico. U.S. government documents state that these planes were 
used for drug smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
The witness said it had been a very difficult decision for him to become a 
government witness because he feared that he might be killed. Earlier in his 
testimony, Harrison said he had been shot nine times in 1984 by Mexican law 
enforcement officials and then imprisoned on several charges, including robbery 
and extortion. He was released in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison has been granted immunity from prosecution for his testimony and his 
family has been relocated to the United States for security reasons, according 
to U.S. documents. Between September, 1989, and February, 1990, the DEA paid 
him $18,000 for information and expenses and it is believed the payments are 
continuing. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison acknowledged that he had used three other names in his life. He said 
he first changed his name about 25 years ago when he was auditing classes at UC 
Berkeley and its law school at the height of the anti-war movement. 
</P>
<P>
He said he could not remember how he got to the United States last September. 
Later, outside the presence of the jury, Harrison said he feared revealing the 
names of the people who helped him get out of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"They surely would be killed if I gave their names," he said. U.S. District 
Judge Edward Rafeedie said that cross-examination of Harrison could resume 
today and that he would have to tell how he got to this country, but the judge 
reserved a decision on whether Harrison would have to divulge the names of 
those who helped him. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, a Navy doctor who performed an autopsy on Camarena gave 
grisly testimony, saying it appeared that the agent's killers had pushed a 
blunt instrument, perhaps a Phillips-head screwdriver, through his head. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jerry Douglas Spencer said that when he examined Camarena in a Guadalajara 
hospital in on March 7, 1985, there was a substantial hole in his skull, 
fractures to his jaw and eight broken ribs.

ALLEGED RAPIST CHARGED IN COURT ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The defendant in a kidnap-rape case, already accused of enslaving two immigrant 
women in a camper, was charged Wednesday with attempted murder, attempted 
escape and a list of other crimes after allegedly stabbing a bailiff in a 
Municipal Court lockup, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Garcia, 38, allegedly drew a crude knife on Deputy Marshal Richard Duran 
as Duran prepared to usher Garcia into court for the second day of a 
preliminary hearing Tuesday. Garcia and a second bailiff were injured in a 
struggle as deputies wrestled Garcia to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia's two female co-defendants in the kidnap-rape case, who also were inside 
the lockup, allegedly joined in the escape attempt by taking away the bailiff's 
radio as he struggled with Garcia, Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel Lenhart said. The 
alleged role of the women had not been initially reported. 
</P>
<P>
Lenhart, who said Garcia had a second knife during the assault, filed the 
following charges against the defendant: premeditated attempted murder, assault 
with a deadly weapon on a peace officer, aggravated mayhem, attempted escape, 
possession of a weapon in a jail and possession of a dirk (a long, straight 
dagger). 
</P>
<P>
The mayhem and attempted murder charges carry a potential life sentence, 
Lenhart said. 
</P>
<P>
The two women, Yolanda Garcia and Margarita Ruvalcaba, will be charged with 
assault with a deadly weapon and attempted escape, he said. While Yolanda 
Garcia allegedly took Duran's radio, Ruvalcaba attempted to take one of 
Garcia's knives, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Duran was quoted in an investigator's report as describing the attack: "I kept 
holding (Paul Garcia) against the wall while he was slashing my face with the 
knife. (The women) tried to subdue me so I kept kicking them until help 
arrived." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wednesday's hearing for Garcia and the two women was postponed until 
July 23, apparently to give Garcia's injuries time to heal. The hearing is to 
determine whether the three will stand trial on 113 counts, including rape, 
kidnap and enslavement, stemming from the alleged imprisonment of two immigrant 
women in a camper in 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, clad in hospital clothes, shackled and handcuffed, walked with 
hesitation as he was led barefoot into court Wednesday. His eyes were swollen 
and his face badly bruised. He appeared to be in pain and unable to move his 
left arm. He sat tentatively on the edge of his chair and had to be helped up. 
</P>
<P>
The two women co-defendants also were handcuffed, hands behind their backs, and 
their feet chained, as they were brought into the courtroom. Their mouths 
trembled and they appeared to be crying. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the previous day, six bailiffs were stationed about the 
courtroom during the short proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
After defense attorneys met with their clients, Judge Glenette Blackwell agreed 
to postpone the hearing until next month "due to certain medical necessities." 
</P>
<P>
"He (Garcia) was not in the emotional condition to go on with the hearing," 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrew J. McMullen, who is prosecuting the case, told 
reporters later. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on a prosecution request, Blackwell also ordered Garcia's aunt, Hermina 
Hernandez, to stay away from the witnesses in the case and to refrain from any 
written, verbal or physical contact with them. Hernandez said she would comply. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen said that after Tuesday's scuffle in the court lockup, Hernandez had 
walked toward and "tried to grab" one of Garcia's alleged victims, a Salvadoran 
woman who has testified that she was repeatedly raped, beaten and given 
electrical shocks to her legs and neck. 
</P>
<P>
A police investigation into Tuesday's stabbing centers on how Garcia came to 
possess the two knives allegedly used to attack Duran. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether we will ever know how (Garcia) obtained the weapon and 
was able to bring it into the building," Marshal's spokesman Lt. Gale Holbrook 
said. "We will look closely to determine how this occurred. It will take a 
little while." 
</P>
<P>
Holbrook said he did not believe Garcia had received any visitors while in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
Duran, the wounded bailiff, underwent surgery for cuts to his face and was 
expected to be released soon from County-USC Medical Center, Marshal's Capt. 
Morris Seidner said Wednesday.

<P>
HORSE RACING: JOCKEY REMEMBERS THINKING ABOUT LOSING HIS RIDES ON THE HORSE OF 
THE YEAR IMMEDIATELY AFTER SERIOUS ACCIDENT AT HOLLYWOOD PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Conway peeked around the curtain and saw Chris McCarron lying in his 
hospital bed. The jockey had a towel over his forehead and a rose on his chest. 
His eyes were closed. He was moaning softly. Truly a pathetic sight. 
</P>
<P>
Can't fool Dr. Dorf, though. Conway, the comedian who is one of McCarron's 
closest friends, picked up the cue and slipped into a deadpan bedside baritone: 
"Is he gone yet? We need the bed." 
</P>
<P>
The moment was light, but the reality was grim. McCarron lay temporarily 
helpless as a result of Sunday's Hollywood Park spill and subsequent surgery. 
The 35-year-old rider broke his left thigh on impact with the ground, then 
broke his right forearm and right leg below the knee when a trailing horse 
trampled him. 
</P>
<P>
Once past the initial shock of the accident, McCarron's first thoughts in the 
emergency room that afternoon were of Sunday Silence. The reigning horse of the 
year was making his 1990 debut in the Californian that same day, taking the 
first step in what figured to be a rewarding season with McCarron aboard. 
</P>
<P>
"Can't they just strap me onto the black horse and let him carry me around?" 
McCarron protested. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, McCarron's wife Judy put up a brave front. She had arrived at the 
track just after Chris had gone down, turned around and headed for the 
hospital. Once convinced her husband would be all right, she turned to a friend 
and said, "I came out expecting a winner's circle picture today, not X-rays." 
</P>
<P>
Even though McCarron had not seen the patrol tape view of the spill, his 
recollections were still vivid. He remembered the horse in front of him, ridden 
by Kent Desormeaux, breaking his left foreleg and falling. He recalled a 
flashing moment when he thought he could get past safely on the inside. But 
mostly he remembered his leg. 
</P>
<P>
"When I finally stopped rolling, my left leg ended up bent out and back, with 
my left arm underneath," McCarron said. "I took one look at it and yelled, 'Oh, 
. . . !' 
</P>
<P>
"But the funny thing was, it didn't really hurt," McCarron went on. "I guess my 
body was producing so much adrenaline that I couldn't feel much. Then when the 
ambulance attendant got to me I heard her say, 'I think we've got a compound 
fracture here.' I didn't want to look at the leg anymore if that was true." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, it was not. McCarron's left thighbone broke in two about a third 
of the way down from his hip, but the bone did not break the skin. It was the 
same bone he shattered on Oct. 16, 1986, at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Capen, one of the orthopedic surgeons who pieced McCarron back together 
before, was initially concerned that this latest break might have been a result 
of a weakness in the repaired bone. He was relieved -- in a manner of speaking 
-- to find that the new damage was in no way related to the '86 fractures. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you could have 100 people fall off a horse the way Chris fell and 
almost all of them would break that leg in the same place," said Capen, who 
assisted Dr. Doug Garland during McCarron's surgery Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Capen said he foresees no complications in McCarron's rehabilitation, which 
will begin as soon as the surgical incisions heal. A stainless steel rod 15 
inches long and about half an inch in diameter was inserted the length of the 
thighbone, and a smaller rod was placed along the larger bone in the right 
forearm. Capen has rigged up a special crutch to take the weight off the 
forearm when McCarron is moving again. 
</P>
<P>
The jockey's doctors also have prescribed a series of radiation treatments on 
the hip area to prevent bone growth in the muscle regions. 
</P>
<P>
"It can happen after this type of procedure," Capen said. "Not always, but if 
it does, it can restrict range of movement. This will be a low-dose X-ray 
treatment. Nothing like the dosage levels for cancer." 
</P>
<P>
While McCarron lay in his room at Centinela Hospital Medical Center, surrounded 
by a jungle of flower arrangements, speculation on his future continued to rage 
through the racing community. Sentiment was running about 50-50 that his latest 
injury would inspire him to retire. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens, who was riding alongside the horse that broke down under 
Desormeaux, considered his own recent history of serious injuries when thinking 
of McCarron. In 1985, Stevens suffered a separated shoulder and torn knee 
ligaments. In 1987 he broke an ankle. In 1989 he broke a wrist and was speared 
between the eyes by a broken plastic rail. 
</P>
<P>
Before last week's racing, Stevens was the leading money rider in the country 
and McCarron was second. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's put it this way," Stevens said. "I wouldn't blame Chris if he did 
retire. I can honestly say that if I get hurt again like I did in 1985, I would 
give it serious thought. I mean, there comes a time when you just have to stop 
and wonder about what you're doing to your body." 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Tom Bunn, a former show horse rider, addressed the mental side of 
returning from any horse-related accident. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember a bad spill I had in a show back East," he said. "I hit my head on 
a rock when I fell. I was back riding in five days, but it was the strangest 
feeling. My hands would say, 'Go,' but my head would say, 'Whoa.' " 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Eddie Truman shattered his right foot and broke his right leg in a 
training accident several years ago and still walks with a distinctive limp. He 
hopes that McCarron's latest setback will prompt the rider to consider a career 
in broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
"Chris could be such an asset to this sport behind the microphone, I almost 
hope he decides to hang it up now before he gets hurt again," Truman said. 
"What more does he have to prove?" 
</P>
<P>
Bill Shoemaker, who suffered a broken femur in 1968 and a crushed pelvis in 
1969 -- then rode for another 20 years -- admitted that retirement always 
crossed his mind whenever he was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"But then, by the time you're all healed up, you've forgotten about the pain 
and you're ready to go again," Shoemaker said. 
</P>
<P>
But Gary Jones, McCarron's closest friend among the training colony, scoffed at 
any retirement talk. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't know Chris," Jones said. "He's got too many obligations, too much 
ability and too much desire to quit if he can still ride." 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, is the key. McCarron's doctors optimistically say that a 
comeback in three months is not out of the question. Such a rapid recovery 
could put McCarron back aboard Sunday Silence in time for his defense of the 
Breeders' Cup Classic on Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
He pulled a similar trick in 1987, when he returned after five months on the 
ground, then rode Alysheba to victory in the Kentucky Derby six weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
As far as McCarron is concerned, retirement is not a subject of serious 
discussion, unless there are complications in his recovery. He would rather 
ponder more immediate broadcasting possibilities while he recuperates, similar 
to the color commentary he did during the 1986 Breeders' Cup for NBC. 
</P>
<P>
"You suppose ABC needs me for the Belmont this Saturday?" McCarron said with a 
grin. "Too soon? OK, how about that August race for Sunday Silence and Easy 
Goer in Chicago?" 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens was suspended by the Los Alamitos stewards for an incident at the 
start of a quarter horse race last Saturday night. "Maybe this is their way of 
saying, 'Stay in your own neighborhood,' " said Stevens, who rode in the 
$233,000 Kindergarten the same evening. The five-day ban will cost him the 
mount on Patches in the Railbird Stakes on Saturday.

TRAILING BLAZERS LOOK FOR A LITTLE IN RESERVE 
</P>

<P>
It wasn't so much about revelations as affirmations, the Detroit Pistons having 
shown a superior bench to beat the Portland Trail Blazers in Game 1 of the NBA 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers proved they could stay with the Pistons, starter against 
starter. But getting past the first five is tapping into one of the great 
Detroit resources, the depth that has helped the Pistons to three consecutive 
trips to the championship round. 
</P>
<P>
Portland didn't answer in kind and was outscored, 26-7, and outrebounded, 19-9, 
by the Piston reserves in a 105-99 defeat Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that's been part of our success the past four or five years," Detroit's 
Vinnie Johnson said. "We're very experienced at that. I'm not sure they are." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't appear they were in Game 1. Portland's Danny Young had three fouls, 
two turnovers and three points in 16 minutes. Drazen Petrovic lasted all of 
four minutes in the first half before getting the hook for good after three 
fouls and a turnover. Cliff Robinson and Wayne Cooper, the big men, combined 
for two points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
In Game 2 tonight at the Palace of Auburn Hills, the Trail Blazers know that 
must change. They spent a good part of Wednesday answering questions about the 
one area of inferiority that could swing the series. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get any point production off the bench," Coach Rick Adelman said. "I 
thought Danny Young did well on defense and Cooper did his part on defense and 
the boards. But (the Pistons) have capable people on the bench who can score a 
lot, like Vinnie and (Mark) Aguirre, though I thought John Salley hurt us a lot 
with his blocks and rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Our bench has been up and down this season, and a lot of that is because we 
have some young people. I thought we should have won (Tuesday) night and we 
just didn't get it. We lost it in the last six or seven minutes, and it wasn't 
the bench that did it." 
</P>
<P>
But it was the Detroit bench that played a major role in the Piston comeback. 
Johnson struggled to a zero-for-six shooting night, but Aguirre had 18 points 
and eight rebounds and Salley contributed nine rebounds and four blocked shots. 
There were more subtle roles, too, such as Salley's assignment to face-guard 
Buck Williams every time the Trail Blazers shot. 
</P>
<P>
That helped the Pistons shoot 37.4% and still win. Meanwhile, the starters were 
resting for the fourth-quarter charge. 
</P>
<P>
"We call our bench the A team anyway," Salley deadpanned. "We start the B team 
just to fool everybody." 
</P>
<P>
But seriously, folks . . . 
</P>
<P>
"They don't look to Danny to score a lot of points," Salley said. "They look to 
Petrovic to score, but we are very conscious of that. He likes the 
three-pointers and to be able to drive a lot. Our attitude is that as soon as 
he goes, I'm going to go after him and block his shot." 
</P>
<P>
That Petrovic didn't even create many opportunities to have his shot blocked 
was the problem. The Trail Blazers' only real scoring threat off the bench 
labored through the three minutes, his playoff shooting dropping to 44.9%, 
still better than Young's 38.3%. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't play so much like the other games," said Petrovic, the rookie from 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA's third-most accurate three-point shooter, he was at 48.5% overall 
during the regular season, including a solid 49.4% after the All-Star break. He 
said the pressure of playing in his first final series did not effect his game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a strong bench," Petrovic said. "If we didn't have a strong 
bench, we wouldn't be here." 
</P>
<P>
The question now, if the bench doesn't get better, is how much longer will they 
be here? 
</P>
<P>
NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
Joe Dumars reported occasional discomfort from his strained left groin, though 
the Piston guard said the injury is improving. He scored 20 points in Game 1. . 
. . Portland's Terry Porter is wearing the initials L.P. stenciled on his 
sneaker in memory of his mother, Louise Porter, who died April 6. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit is 12-0 in postseason games when it has held opponents to fewer than 
100 points. Over the last two years, the Pistons are 27-6 in sub-100 playoff 
games. "Our championship rings from last year don't say offense," John Salley 
said. "They have our record and the word defense." . . . The Pistons are 10-0 
at the Palace during the playoffs and 12-4 overall. The Trail Blazers are 2-6 
on the road, 11-6 overall.

DENT OUT AS YANKEE MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the results of Tuesday's primaries were still being assimilated Wednesday, 
Bucky Dent was removed from office -- a predictable exit that required no poll. 
</P>
<P>
In his 18th season as dictatorial owner of the New York Yankees, George 
Steinbrenner has changed managers 19 times. Dent's firing was accompanied by 
familiar rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
"George languished long and hard over this decision," General Manager Harding 
Peterson said. "We all believe the club is better than the record indicates." 
</P>
<P>
Carl (Stump) Merrill, manager of the Yankees' triple-A team at Columbus, Ohio, 
will replace Dent for the remainder of a season certain to feature speculation 
that Davey Johnson, fired as the New York Mets' manager nine days ago, will 
eventually occupy Steinbrenner's hot seat. 
</P>
<P>
Dent replaced Dallas Green as Yankee manager Aug. 18. The club had an 18-22 
record the rest of the season and was 18-31, baseball's worst record, at the 
time of his firing Wednesday -- Steinbrenner's third fastest at the start of a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Lemon was fired after only 14 games in 1982, and Yogi Berra after 16 in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
Also fired Wednesday were third base coach Joe Sparks, batting coach Champ 
Summers and bullpen catcher Gary Tuck. 
</P>
<P>
Buck Showalter, who was Dent's eye in the sky, aligning the defense from a seat 
in the stands, will replace Sparks at third base. Former Yankee manager Gene 
Michael will become the eye in the sky, and former major league catcher Marc 
Hill will take Tuck's assignment. 
</P>
<P>
The names change but the heat goes on. Under Steinbrenner, the Yankees live in 
the shadow of their proud past. The 1990 team, without a major run producer 
other than Don Mattingly or a reliable starting pitcher, ranked 12th among the 
American League's 14 teams Wednesday with a .248 batting average and eighth in 
earned-run average at 4.01. 
</P>
<P>
Dent, in a brief meeting with reporters after his firing, said that under the 
circumstances, he felt he had done everything he could do. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Winfield and Luis Polonia, a couple of former Yankees who were traded to 
the Angels this season, said they weren't surprised by the move. 
</P>
<P>
"They were playing bad. I'm glad I'm here," said Winfield, who, against his 
wishes, was platooned by Dent early this season. "I'm not going to sit here and 
gloat. I'm done with (the Yankees)." 
</P>
<P>
Polonia said: "I'm here, (Dent's) not here anymore. I guess people value my job 
more than they value his job. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure Bucky was trying to do more than he really could. The pitching wasn't 
doing good, the hitting wasn't hitting. Somebody there had to get the blame. 
</P>
<P>
"New York will never win if Steinbrenner never gets out of there, and he won't. 
Forget about it. He hires managers and then he doesn't let them manage." 
Mattingly agreed. "Bucky wasn't the reason we weren't winning," the first 
baseman said. "I've always said you have to have consistency. I said it when 
Dallas was fired and I say it now -- someone's got to stay. Maybe Stump's the 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
Said catcher Rick Cerone: "This had nothing to do with Bucky. He's just a 
scapegoat. Everyone knows we're the ones who got him fired." 
</P>
<P>
Dent provided one miracle for the Yankees when his playoff home run off Mike 
Torrez of the Boston Red Sox lifted the team to the 1978 Eastern Division 
title, but it is generally conceded that it would have taken another miracle 
for him to have survived as manager of this Yankee team. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge may even stump the anonymous Stump, who holds a master's degree 
in physical education from the University of Maine but who probably will 
receive an education from Steinbrenner unlike any he has had before. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-8 Merrill, 46, spent six years as a catcher in the Philadelphia 
Phillies' minor league system, won five pennants managing in the Yankee system, 
spent two years as New York's eye in the sky and was leading the International 
League's Southern Division in his third stint as Columbus manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I have achieved something that, if you had put odds on it, you would 
have won a lot of money," Merrill said of his appointment. "I feel sad for 
Bucky, but I look at it in terms of what it means to Stump Merrill -- and it's 
one of the happiest days of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Merrill said he knows only about 15 players. 
</P>
<P>
"The timing of the lockout was bad for me because I didn't even go to spring 
training (with the major league team)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"From watching them (on television), it looked like a listless club, and that's 
not my style. I'm generally easygoing, but once I put that baseball hat on, 
it's business and business only. I'm aggressive, I like to force the action. It 
took me 14 years to get to this point, and I intend to make the most of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to say we'll win the pennant, but we're going to put a product 
on the field that will perform. We'll play hard and we'll have fun." 
</P>
<P>
Columbus General Manager Ken Schnacke said Merrill has what it takes to be a 
success in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
"He's sneaky smart," Schnacke said. "Like he said when I talked to him earlier, 
a lot of people in New York will say, 'Who the hell's Stump Merrill?' but he 
doesn't care. He knows he can manage. He said he just hopes he catches 
lightning in a bottle." 
</P>
<P>
A long list of others have discovered, however, that lightning in a bottle 
might pale in comparison to the owner's thunder.

Dick who?: After Jim Valvano was signed by ABC as a basketball analyst, Dick 
Vitale told USA Today that he put in a call to ESPN executive producer Steve

Kiner watch: From Bruce Keidan of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: "Ralph Kiner, 
who is justifiably famous for his malapropisms and non sequiturs, may have 
topped himself on a WWOR telecast of a Mets' game recently. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mets' David Cone was pitching to Benito Santiago of the Padres when Kiner 
said this: 'Santiago in Spanish means San Francisco. No. Santiago in San Diego 
means St. James.' 
</P>
<P>
"I am not making this up. 
</P>
<P>
"Later in the broadcast, Kiner announced: 'This is Ralph Kiner, along with 
Frank Cashen, general manager of the San Diego Padres.' " 
</P>
<P>
Cashen is general manager of the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Add Kiner: He has always had trouble with names, and the Sporting News has been 
keeping track. Here is a list, with Kiner's versions on the right: 
</P>

Trivia time: Who is the only man in baseball history with at least 2,000 hits, 
300 home runs and 300 stolen bases? 
</P>
<P>
Now-it-can-be-told Dept. Detroit's Mike Heath was so incensed after striking 
out for the final out in Randy Johnson's no-hitter at Seattle Sunday, he did a 
number on the TV set in the visitors' locker room. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving, the Tigers were handed a bill for $700. 
</P>
<P>
Add Johnson: "I sure wish my parents could have seen this because they've 
watched me twice on TV and I gave up six home runs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Knight strikes: Said Indiana basketball Coach Bob Knight at a roast of Detroit 
Tiger President Bo Schembechler: "He must be thinking, 'We're paying millions 
to guys who don't play well.' He must think he's coaching at Illinois." 
</P>
<P>
Didn't shrink: Said Kansas City linebacker Derrick Thomas, comparing his two 
coaches at Alabama, Ray Perkins and Bill Curry: "Perkins wasn't too big to go 
into the projects. He would drive his Lincoln right up to the front door and go 
in for dinner. Maybe Curry was afraid. Whatever, we lost a lot of players." 
</P>
<P>
Good move: Gil Morgan, who holds a degree in optometry but has never practiced,

FIELDER HITS THREE HOMERS IN CLEVELAND 
</P>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
No player has ever hit a ball into the center-field bleachers at Cleveland 
Municipal Stadium since it opened in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
Cecil Fielder, however, came close Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder hit three homers in the Detroit Tigers' 6-4 victory over the Indians, 
including a three-run blast in the fifth inning that traveled an estimated 470 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand what's going on, but I hope it'll keep going," said 
Fielder, who leads the majors with 22 home runs and 53 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder, who hit 38 home runs last season in Japan and signed with the Tigers 
as a free agent, hit solo homers off Greg Swindell (2-5) in the second and 
fourth innings before putting the Tigers ahead for good in the fifth with his 
towering three-run shot. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder also had three home runs at Toronto on May 6. He is the first Tiger to 
hit three home runs in a game twice in the same season. Fielder also hit three 
home runs in a spring-training game. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder was walked on four pitches by reliever Cecilio Guante in his final 
at-bat in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 5, Texas 4 -- Jose Canseco hit his 20th homer and Dave Henderson hit 
his eighth as the Athletics ruined Nolan Ryan's return from the disabled list 
at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan (4-3) pitched five innings in his first start since May 17 when back 
spasms sidelined him. He gave up five runs, only two of them earned, on four 
hits, struck out eight and walked three. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Sanderson (7-2) allowed three runs in five innings. Dennis Eckersley, the 
fifth Oakland pitcher, worked the ninth for his 18th save in 18 tries. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 12, Toronto 5 -- Kirby Puckett went five for five for the second time 
this season and the Twins equaled a season-high with 19 hits at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Manrique had four hits and Greg Gagne had three hits, including a two-run 
homer. 
</P>
<P>
John Candelaria (7-1) pitched three innings in relief to earn the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 5, Seattle 0 -- Melido Perez pitched a four-hitter at Chicago for the 
second shutout of his career. Perez (5-4) walked none and struck out seven in 
his first complete game. He is 3-0 lifetime against the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>

Boston Red Sox Manager Joe Morgan changed course Wednesday and decided to 
appeal his three-game suspension, leaving him in the dugout at least until a 
hearing next week. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan managed the Red Sox to a 4-1 victory over the New York Yankees Wednesday 
night at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan can stay with the Red Sox until he meets Tuesday in New York with 
American League President Bobby Brown. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Brown suspended Morgan for supporting a brushback pitch that led to 
a bench-clearing brawl Sunday in Cleveland. At the time, Morgan said he would 
not contest the penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan appealed Wednesday. He did not offer an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll have to talk to the other boys about it," he said, suggesting Boston's 
front office. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Brown said, "The fact that pitchers throw close to hitters and 
sometimes deliberately hit them is a known fact." 
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, it behooves the American League office to eliminate premeditated 
and announced violence. This cannot be condoned, and increasing suspensions and 
fines will be imposed if the practice continues," Brown said.

Things looked very familiar at the start for Stanford freshman Brian Sackinsky 
against Georgia on Wednesday night. But the ending couldn't have been any 
different or better for him. 
</P>
<P>
A surprise starter for injured All-American Stan Spencer, Sackinsky, a 6-foot-4 
right-hander from South Park High in Library, Pa., overcame a shaky start to 
pitch his first complete game, a 4-2 victory over the Bulldogs that kept the 
top-seeded Cardinal alive in the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
The victory means Stanford will face Georgia (50-19) again Friday in the 
double-elimination tournament. Georgia handed Stanford its only loss, 16-2. The 
winner advances to Saturday's championship game against either Oklahoma State 
or Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
Sackinsky (10-1) was hit hard in Sunday's loss to the Bulldogs. He lasted only 
one-third of an inning in relief, yielding four hits and five runs. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Georgia scored two runs in the first on two hits, but that was all 
Sackinsky gave them as he finished with a six-hitter and a career-high 10 
strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hammonds put the Cardinal (59-11) ahead for good in the seventh with a 
two-run single.

GIANTS REGAIN THEIR WINNING WAYS AND COMPLETE SWEEP OF REDS

The San Francisco Giants appear to be swinging back into the form that made 
them National League champions last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants became the first team to win a series against the Cincinnati Reds 
when Kevin Mitchell hit a home run off Rob Dibble with two out in the 11th 
inning Wednesday at San Francisco to give the Giants a 3-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants extended their winning streak to six games by sweeping the Reds, 
whose 33-15 record is the best in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I'd see a fastball and I hit it pretty good," said Mitchell, who has 
15 homers. "I was lucky to get a hold of it." 
</P>
<P>
Will Clark's 10th homer, a solo shot in the ninth off Randy Myers, tied the 
score, 2-2. Mitchell's homer off Dibble (3-1) marked the first time in 29 games 
that the Reds lost when leading after eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
Paul O'Neill hit his seventh homer for the Reds, who have an 11-game lead over 
the fourth-place Giants in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Jeff Brantley (2-1) earned the victory, retiring Ron Oester on a 
grounder with runners on first and second to end the Reds' 11th. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 3, Houston 2 -- Garry Templeton capped a three-run ninth inning with 
a two-out single at San Diego as the Padres handed the Astros' their sixth 
consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Carter hit his ninth homer, a two-run shot off Mark Portugal (1-6). Glenn 
Davis supplied all of the Astros' runs with his 17th homer, his seventh in six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
New York 4, Montreal 3 -- Frank Viola yielded seven hits in seven innings at 
New York to become the first National League pitcher to win nine games. 
</P>
<P>
Viola (9-2) struck out six and walked two. John Franco pitched the ninth for 
his ninth save. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Johnson hit his ninth homer for the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 12, Philadelphia 11 -- Willie McGee's two-run double capped a 
three-run rally in the 10th inning at St. Louis as reliever Frank DiPino (3-0) 
earned his 14th consecutive victory since June 9, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies' Len Dykstra had two hits to extend his hitting streak to 19 games 
and finished the night at a major league-leading .415. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 6, Chicago 1 -- Andy Van Slyke's three-run homer keyed a five-run 
first inning for the Pirates, who completed a three-game sweep at Pittsburgh in 
a game called in the middle of the seventh after a rain delay. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Drabek (8-2) pitched a five-hitter as the Pirates beat the Cubs for the 
seventh consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Maddux (4-6) suffered his fifth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Dawson hit his 14th homer for the Cubs.

NEWSWIRE: MESSIER EDGES BOURQUE FOR NHL'S MVP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edmonton's Mark Messier stepped out of Wayne Gretzky's shadow Wednesday night 
by winning the Hart Trophy as the NHL's most valuable player -- an award 
dominated by his former teammate in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Messier beat out Boston defenseman Ray Bourque by two points in the closest 
balloting ever for the trophy. St. Louis right wing Brett Hull was the other 
finalist for the award that Gretzky won eight times with Edmonton and last year 
with the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
The voting is conducted by the Professional Hockey Writers Assn. before the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Bourque won the Norris Trophy as the NHL's top defenseman, and Hull, whose 72 
goals set a league record for right wings, won the Lady Byng Trophy for 
sportsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal's Patrick Roy won the Vezina Trophy as the league's top goaltender for 
the second consecutive year. And Soviet Sergei Makarov, who turns 32 later this 
month, won the Calder Trophy as the rookie of the year.

From the desert to the sea, Jerry Dunphy is the old pro of TV news pros, and 
commanding the anchor desk through 4 hours and 45 minutes Tuesday night and 
into Wednesday, he never lost his sparkle. All the hairs on the great white 
mane were in place. 
</P>
<P>
But there was one moment of great revelation, about 12:20 a.m. Wednesday when 
KCAL Channel 9 came up to a commercial break. Dunphy, in either an incredible 
moment of candor or a slip of the veteran tongue, asked us to stay around: 
"We're gonna stick with this and make it interesting." 
</P>
<P>
He and co-anchor Pat Harvey stuck with it until their close at 12:45, winning 
the marathon trophy. But through about 15 hours of collective California 
election coverage across nine L.A. stations Tuesday night, interesting ran a 
distant last. 
</P>
<P>
Through assorted glitches, including computer problems in the vote counting, it 
was a hard night for the telereporters. 
</P>
<P>
How hard was it? 
</P>
<P>
The first hours after the polls closed were spent with only a few votes in, so 
visual displays on the screen showed no percentage, as in "0%," for the number 
of precincts counted. One anchor reported sagely, "It's too close to call yet." 
</P>
<P>
In effect, the coverage was a dress rehearsal for The Big One in the fall. KCAL 
tried split-screen conversations with the anchor team and two other locations 
-- and pity poor, bruised Kate Sullivan, reporting from San Francisco. She kept 
getting stepped on by one to three people talking over her at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Few of the reporters were "sourced" inside the political camps to know what was 
going on beyond "what I heard people saying in the crowd." Many of them seemed 
unprepared, asking questions like "What do you have to say to that?" 
</P>
<P>
Granted, it's tedium waiting around the victory celebration at the hotel 
ballroom three hours before the candidate shows up. And then later, still 
waiting, you have to outshout the orchestra, again reporting that nothing is 
happening. But that doesn't dissuade television, which doesn't follow the good 
old axiom of the journalism business that no news is no news. There is time to 
be filled. 
</P>
<P>
At 8 p.m. on the button, the polls closed and most of the stations broke in to 
declare Dianne Feinstein the winner in the Democratic gubernatorial race on the 
basis of a plethora of exit polls, although nobody ever said who was polled 
where. KCBS Channel 2 ran a news "crawl" across the action at the 
Detroit-Portland game. 
</P>
<P>
From then on it was, as they used to say in vaudeville, vamping for time. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Lopez at KCBS reported that Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, the Feinstein 
foe, was eating at a Chinese restaurant across from the Biltmore Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody had at least one interview with the ubiquitous Arlo Smith, who was 
edging Ira Reiner for the Democratic state attorney general nomination. Every 
time he was asked, every time Smith insisted that his campaign wasn't dirty. 
</P>
<P>
On KTLA Channel 5, librarian Burgess Meredith was being sentenced to death by 
the State in an old "Twilight Zone" episode because there were no books left in 
the world anyway and he was redundant. 
</P>
<P>
On KABC Channel 7, Roseanne was nervous about an interview for a job. 
</P>
<P>
KTTV Channel 11 co-anchor Dennis Morgino did a featurette about a possible 
"gender gap," Feinstein being a woman and all. But it was obviously prepared 
ahead of time and was a dead dog by that time of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
KNBC Channel 4, anchored by Jess Marlow and Linda Alvarez, had the spriteliest 
visuals for its vote tallies and probably the most solid coverage (political 
editor Linda Douglass came off as the savviest of the night). They did, 
however, leave Republican gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson's victory speech 
a little early for commercials for Cadillac dealers and 7-11 Super Big Gulps. 
</P>
<P>
KCOP Channel 13 was tardy getting to the Van de Kamp concession speech because 
sportscaster Vic (The Brick) Jacobs was in mid-rampage on his Dodgers and 
Angels pronouncements and probably couldn't be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
At about 11, when Feinstein took the podium for her victory speech, KTLA had 
gone to "Cheers"; KCOP broadcast a bit of her and then jumped into "The Arsenio 
Hall Show" five minutes late, 
</P>
<P>
KCBS left about midnight for "Rescue 911." KCAL's "Prime 9 News" departed at 
12:45 a.m. for a commercial for the "Hot Party Line" ("99 cents a call") and an 
episode of "T.J. Hooker." KNBC's last report came from by-now-shirt-sleeved 
Bill Lagatutta, who was hanging with a few leftovers and the janitorial crew at 
the Fairmount Hotel in San Francisco, Feinstein headquarters. It rolled credits 
at 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The staff seemed pretty much in a fading mode at KABC Channel 7. Co-anchor Ann 
Martin was trying to make a point when whoever was operating her camera seemed 
to fall off a stool and Martin's image began darting up and down and around the 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
At 1:05 a.m., Channel 7 bailed out after Martin and Harold Greene looked at 
their notes and shrugged that they had covered about everything. 
</P>
<P>
By this time Arlo Smith was all out of media and probably went home to bed.

ROBBINS PUTS HIS STAMP ON CITY BALLET FESTIVAL OF HIS WORKS 
</P>

New York City Ballet opened "A Festival of Jerome Robbins' Ballets" on Tuesday 
night that was in glaring contrast to its unexceptional 1988 American Music 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
The hoopla and incidentals that cluttered the '88 event were not for Robbins, 
the 71-year-old choreographer who largely absented himself from the previous 
festival. This time around, no special edition posters, artwork slide shows, 
T-shirts, or gussied-up, conspicuous, would-be patrons of the arts distracted 
attention from the company's life force: dancing. 
</P>
<P>
This celebration, which runs two weeks and includes 27 Robbins ballets from his 
40-odd years as a choreographer, began almost matter-of-factly as another night 
at City Ballet. (All programs, with the exception of the still undecided-upon 
bill that closes the festival, are regular subscription performances.) Almost, 
but not quite, just another performance. 
</P>
<P>
The first night of this Robbins run came about by way of concentrated 
preparation and added expenditure. The legendary perfectionist of both the 
Broadway and ballet stages has had priority over all City Ballet rehearsals for 
the past 12 weeks, including the luxurious "dark" past week, which interrupted 
the current season and gave over all stage time to Robbins' rehearsals. From 
the looks of the three ballets on the first of nine different mixed bills, the 
effort is paying off handsomely. 
</P>
<P>
Simply, yet somehow slyly, Robbins arranged an opening program that began with 
his very first ballet, "Fancy Free," from 1944 for American Ballet Theatre, 
followed by his latest, "Ives, Songs," from 1988 for City Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
The former reviews Robbins' roots in Ballet Theatre's character/classical bent. 
The latter trades fully on the supreme and unadulterated classicism that City 
Ballet's founding genius, George Balanchine, championed and developed. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since "Fancy Free" entered City Ballet's repertory in 1980, 
it looks truly at home and alive. With Tom Gold, a little dancer with big feet 
and a brazen eagerness, the showoff sailor role was performed with a cheekiness 
built on classicism. With Robert LaFosse as the sweet guy, the ballet had a 
character full of inflection and nuance in both dance and gesture. As the 
slangy, sexy gob, Damian Woetzel was only slightly off. His very clear and 
potent dancing couldn't always produce the inherent Mr. Smoothie slink, 
especially in his snake-hips rumba. 
</P>
<P>
The two main women, Allison Brown and Stephanie Saland, were indelibly vivid, 
both feisty and feminine, as the very jazzy thrust of Leonard Bernstein's a 
night-on-the-town score was happily addressed and displayed. 
</P>
<P>
"Ives, Songs," set to 18 songs by Charles Ives (for piano and male vocalist) 
inverts the balance that early Robbins worked with. Here, characterizational 
material is secondary and classical vocabulary dominant. The carefully 
rehearsed cast of 39 dancers demonstrated a rewarding command of both ends of 
this dancerly spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
Led by an extra-rangy Maria Calegari, heroically partnered by an impassioned 
Alexandre Proia, with a stately Saland strongly supported by a cool but intense 
Jeppe Mydtskov, "Ives, Songs" was by turns windswept, witty and grave, like the 
eccentric and evocative music that makes up its score. 
</P>
<P>
By ending this program with "Fanfare," the choreographically illustrative work 
made in 1953 to "The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra" by Benjamin 
Britten, the man of the season may have been effecting one of his inimitable 
theatrical twists. His festival didn't need to start with an orchestral 
fanfare, as some past festivals have done. His own active repertory already 
included "Fanfare," one that was suitable for an evening's finale. 
</P>
<P>
Before this closing work got under way, however, an extra Robbins thought was 
presented. First, a loudspeaker announcement asked the audience to observe a 
minute of silence. Then, in front of the curtain came former principal dancer 
Sean Lavery to say that the silence was meant to dramatize what could happen to 
many of our arts organizations if the National Endowment for the Arts were not 
renewed. Lavery suggested that the audience should "not presume that common 
sense would prevail" and encouraged everyone to voice concerns in letters to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The first Robbins bill then closed with a sometimes strongly -- especially by 
the men -- and other times thinly, danced performance of a playful ballet. 
</P>
<P>
This festival opener artfully revealed that when business-as-usual concerns 
Jerome Robbins, the result is a class act.

'BACK HOME': PIECING TOGETHER A FAMILY AFTER WAR

<P>
It's hard to find any benefits of World War II. Some people figured, well, 
hell, Hitler put the Germans to work. 
</P>
<P>
And Mussolini got the trains running on time. 
</P>
<P>
"Back Home," a poignant little film that airs on the Disney Channel at 8 
tonight, anguishes over some of the wretched old social mores that were ripped 
apart by the war and then pieced together but in a bright new pattern. 
</P>
<P>
The director is Piers Haggard, who also did the heralded "Pennies from Heaven" 
series for British TV with Bob Hoskins. 
</P>
<P>
The story focuses on one upper-crusted English family but the lessons are 
universal. Thirteen-year-old Rusty (played with bounce and sensitivity by 
Glendale actress Hayley Carr) spent five years with relatives in the States 
avoiding German bombs. She is full of reckless American spirit and can't adjust 
to the rigidity of the English boarding school order, which is horrified by her 
"OK" slang and her penchant for speaking when not spoken to. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy (Hayley Mills, in a touching turn) tries to cope with her daughter and 
likewise with a husband who comes back from the war and demands his old world 
back. But Peggy learned reliance through the war. She's not the little missy 
any more. IRV LETOFSKY

TREND TOWARD A 'CITY CALLED CALIFORNIA' SEEN IN ELECTION RESULTS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: A HISTORIAN SAYS REGIONAL CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE NORTH AND SOUTH ARE 
GIVING WAY AS THE STATE UNIFIES ECONOMICALLY, POLITICALLY AND CULTURALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
California politicians pondered without particular conclusion Wednesday the 
dramatic success of Northern California candidates in Tuesday's primary, but 
historian Kevin Starr said the balloting reflected a significant trend toward 
the economic, political and cultural unification of urban North and South. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderful shift, a very important shift," Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
No longer is the San Francisco Bay Area smarting about being surpassed by 
metropolitan Los Angeles as the state's economic and political power base. And 
Southern California "doesn't have the cultural chip on its shoulder" it used 
to, said Starr, a Northern Californian who regularly commutes to a teaching job 
at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly linked by transportation and communications, the San Francisco-Los 
Angeles-San Diego corridor is emerging as "a city called California," added 
Starr, author of California histories titled "Inventing the Dream," "Americans 
and the California Dream" and "Material Dreams." Politically, Berkeley and 
Santa Monica have more in common than Berkeley does with some of its East Bay 
neighbors a few miles away in Alameda and Contra Costa counties, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As old animosities and points of pride fade, Southern Californians find 
themselves comfortable voting for Northerners, Starr said. Northern 
Californians who take the time to get to know Southern California recognize it 
as a dynamic, maturing world capital to which they are inextricably linked 
economically, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, is the first Northern 
Californian to carry a major party banner for governor into a general election 
campaign in 24 years -- since Democrat Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr. of San 
Francisco ran unsuccessfully for a third term against Republican Ronald Reagan 
in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
If elected, Feinstein also would be the first California chief executive to 
jump directly from local government into the state's top elective office since 
Republican James Rolph Jr. was elected governor in 1930 while serving as San 
Francisco mayor. Her opponent in the Nov. 6 general election, Republican Sen. 
Pete Wilson, also is a former mayor -- of San Diego -- and would be the first 
governor from that city in modern times. 
</P>
<P>
Back in 1974, Pat Brown's son Jerry came along to win the governorship back for 
Democrats, but by eschewing his San Francisco-Sacramento boyhood home ground 
and consciously choosing Los Angeles as his political power base, first winning 
election to the Los Angeles Community College Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Today, as she goes against Wilson, Feinstein heads a ticket dominated by 
Northern Californians, including Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy; Arlo Smith, the San 
Francisco district attorney who was an upset winner over Los Angeles County 
Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, and state Sen. John Garamendi of Walnut Grove, who 
defeated Southerners Bill Press and Conway Collis for the nomination to be the 
state's first elected insurance commissioner. Bill Honig, who was elected to a 
third term as state superintendent of public instruction Tuesday, is from the 
San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican slate more closely reflects the growing GOP power base in 
Southern California, but appointed state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes, who was 
nominated for a full term, is from Sacramento. Wilson served in the capital as 
a member of the state Assembly in the 1970s, and Marian Bergeson of Newport 
Beach, the party's nominee for lieutenant governor, is an incumbent state 
senator who is respected by the Sacramento power Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
The success of the Northerners captured the imagination of Sacramento political 
veterans Wednesday. But they declined to find dramatic patterns in the tea 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we suffer the inevitable beltway mentality," said Robert Forsyth, an 
aide to Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles). "We tend to 
discount L.A. -- to assume that because Reiner's L.A., Reiner gets it." 
</P>
<P>
Reiner was far better known than Smith, his San Francisco counterpart, going 
into their contest for the nomination for attorney general, but he also was 
plagued by far higher negative views among those familiar with his 
controversial career. The underdog Smith campaigned tirelessly throughout 
Southern California while Reiner made only token campaign forays into the 
North. 
</P>
<P>
Forsyth and others attributed the success of other Northerners to 
characteristics of the individual candidates and contests rather than the 
strength of their geographic base. Feinstein ran as a candidate who could rise 
above geographic differences and bring disparate parts of California together. 
"Nobody thought I would get a plurality of votes in Southern California, but I 
did," she told a San Francisco news conference Wednesday. "Our destinies are 
intertwined." 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, the election demonstrates that being from the North is not, in 
itself, a barrier to statewide success. And the fact remains, Forsyth said, 
that "it would be fantasy to think that a Northern Californian could win 
without Southern California money. The money is still in the Los Angeles area." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's edge over Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp of Los Angeles was 
remarkably uniform throughout much of California. Some of her biggest margins, 
with 56% of the vote, came not in her home city of San Francisco, but in 
Alameda County across the bay and in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Another Sacramento expert who declined to be identified said Feinstein's 
success gives even more power to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco), a close ally of Feinstein's. But the expert said the primary's 
other big legislative winner is a Southerner, Assemblyman Richard D. Katz 
(D-Sylmar), who helped write and lead the campaign for Proposition 111, the 
$18.5-billion transportation finance measure approved by voters Tuesday. Katz 
also was a major figure in promotion of Proposition 112, the successful 
legislative ethics program, and an initiative banning the trophy hunting of 
mountain lions in California.

BASEBALL ROUNDUP;

<P>
IT'S A FIRST: REDS ARE SWEPT BY THE GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Francisco Giants appear to be swinging back into the form that made 
them National League champions last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants became the first team to sweep a series against the Cincinnati Reds 
when Kevin Mitchell hit a home run off Rob Dibble with two out in the 11th 
inning Wednesday at San Francisco to give them a 3-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants extended their winning streak to six games by sweeping the 
three-game series from the Reds, whose 33-15 record is the best in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
"I just took a step back and tried to see the ball better coming out of his 
hand," said Mitchell, who has 15 homers. "He threw me two sliders away and I 
knew he didn't want to get behind on me. I thought I'd see a fastball and I hit 
it pretty good. I was lucky to get ahold of it." 
</P>
<P>
Will Clark's 10th homer, a solo shot in the ninth off Randy Myers, tied the 
score, 2-2. Mitchell's homer off Rob Dibble (3-1) marked the first time in 29 
games that the Reds lost when leading after eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds, who have an 11-game lead over the fourth-place Giants in the West, 
took a 2-0 lead in the first on Paul O'Neill's seventh home run. 
</P>
<P>
Don Robinson, making his third start since coming off the disabled list on May 
24, held the Reds to eight hits in eight innings. Jeff Brantley (2-1) earned 
the victory, retiring Ron Oester on a grounder with runners on first and second 
to end the Reds' 11th. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Jackson limited the Giants to one run and four hits in 7 1/3 innings, his 
longest outing of the season. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 3, Houston 2 -- Garry Templeton capped a three-run ninth inning with 
a two-out single at San Diego as the Padres handed the Astros' their sixth 
consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Carter's ninth homer, a two-run shot off Mark Portugal (1-6), tied the 
game, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Benito Santiago then singled and Dan Schatzeder walked Mike Pagliarulo. The 
runners executed a double steal as Larry Andersen struck out pinch-hitter Jack 
Clark, setting the stage for Templeton's game-winning hit. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Davis supplied all of Astro runs with his 17th homer, his seventh in six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Lefferts (3-1) pitched the ninth inning to earn the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 15, Toronto 5 -- Kirby Puckett went 5 for 5 for the second time this 
season and the Twins equalled a season-high with 19 hits at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Puckett, who is batting .342, had a double, four singles and also scored three 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just trying to go up the middle," said Puckett, whose other five-hit game 
came May 14 against Oakland. "That's my game plan all season. If I get 600 
at-bats, I'm trying to go up the middle in every one." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Manrique had a double and three singles and drove in three runs for the 
Twins. Greg Gagne had three hits, including a two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins, who lead the league in hitting, also had 19 hits on April 24 against 
Detroit and on May 25 against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
John Candelaria (7-1) pitched three innings in relief to earn the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Gruber hit his 15th homer for the Blue Jays.

TATE SEEFRIED IN A CLASS BY HIMSELF; 
</P>
<P>
EL SEGUNDO FIRST BASEMAN-PITCHER IS SOUTH BAY PLAYER OF THE YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When John Stevenson watches Tate Seefried play baseball, he sees major league 
potential in the lanky El Segundo High senior. 
</P>
<P>
It's close to the same potential the veteran coach saw in another El Segundo 
player 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of similarities between Tate and George Brett," Stevenson 
said. "It's the same feeling I had when George was here." 
</P>
<P>
Physically, Seefried and Brett share two features: sweet, left-handed swings 
and powerful right arms. But it's what lies below the surface that convinces 
Stevenson that Seefried can make it in the majors. Seefried was drafted in the 
third round Monday by the New York Yankees and signed Tuesday for a six-figure 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
"If George had a bad day, there was always another game to be played," 
Stevenson said of the Kansas City Royals All-Star third baseman. "I think Tate 
is the same way." 
</P>
<P>
The coach used El Segundo's 5-4 loss to San Marino in the Southern Section 2-A 
Division championship game Saturday as an example. Seefried, who gave up four 
runs in five-plus innings, was the losing pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"It bothered him a great deal that he lost," Stevenson said. "He was thinking 
all weekend what he could have done differently. But I guarantee the next time 
he goes out to play, he will be looking ahead, not behind. That's what you need 
to do in pro ball. You have to learn to shake those 0-for-5 nights." 
</P>
<P>
Seefried didn't have many 0-for-5 games for El Segundo this season. The 
transfer from Spokane, Wash., by way of Rolling Hills High set school records 
for most home runs, runs batted in, hits and runs scored in a season, helping 
the Eagles (27-4) to their second consecutive appearance in the 2-A title game. 
He also was the team's No. 2 pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
For his efforts, Seefried has been named The Times South Bay Player of the 
Year. 
</P>
<P>
Garry Poe, who guided a young and inexperienced Rolling Hills team to the Bay 
League title, has been selected South Bay Coach of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Seefried, who played first base and pitched, called Monday "the best day of my 
life." Not only did the Yankees make Seefried the South Bay's highest draft 
choice since St. Bernard shortstop Royce Clayton was taken in the first round 
by the San Francisco Giants in 1988, but he received word that he had been 
selected to the U.S. Junior Olympic West team. 
</P>
<P>
He forfeited his chance to play for the team when he signed Tuesday with the 
Yankees. The 6-foot-4, 180-pound player will report to the Yankees' rookie 
league club in Tampa, Fla., by June 20. 
</P>
<P>
"He was torn between the two," said Gary Seefried, Tate's father. "He was 
extremely excited about playing for the Junior Olympic team. But his life-long 
goal was to be a professional baseball player." 
</P>
<P>
Seefried realized that goal after a stellar prep career. 
</P>
<P>
After playing his freshman and sophomore years at Rolling Hills, Seefried moved 
with his family to Spokane, where he established himself as one of the top 
juniors on the West Coast. Playing for Central Valley High last year, he drew 
accolades as the Spokane area's best major league prospect since Ryne Sandberg. 
He led Central Valley to the quarterfinals of the state playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But despite hitting .415 and an 8-1 pitching record, Seefried said he wasn't 
entirely satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year I had a good season in Spokane, but I don't think I had that good of 
a year," he said. "This year I thought I had a real good season. I think that's 
what helped me in the draft." 
</P>
<P>
When the Seefrieds moved back to Southern California last summer, they had 
planned to return to the Palos Verdes Peninsula. But their plans changed after 
Gary Seefried saw an El Segundo American Legion game. Seefried went to watch 
Eagle shortstop Mark Lewis, a family friend and former teammate of Tate's at 
Rolling Hills. Lewis transferred to El Segundo after his sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
Impressed by El Segundo's strong tradition and fan support, Gary Seefried 
decided it was best for Tate's future to have him play his senior year in an 
Eagle uniform. 
</P>
<P>
It proved a perfect marriage of school and athlete. 
</P>
<P>
First, he helped the basketball team reach the 2-A semifinals as a starting 
forward. Then he earned a spot as the No. 3 hitter for a talent-laden baseball 
team that returned 10 of 16 players from its 1989 2-A championship squad. 
</P>
<P>
Seefried responded by rewriting the school record book with 13 home runs, 50 
RBIs, 55 hits and 44 runs scored. He batted .478 (55 for 115). In four CIF 
playoff games, he was 7 for 15 with six RBIs and six runs scored. Saturday, he 
doubled, tripled and scored two runs in the 2-A final at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Before the playoffs, Seefried helped the Eagles to their second consecutive 
Camino Real League title and was named the league's Most Valuable Player. 
</P>
<P>
"He really packed a wallop, no question about that," Stevenson said. "He is 
just an outstanding all-around player. Offensively, he started strong and he 
finished strong. Not knowing anything about him going into the season, we 
figured to have a pretty strong team anyway. When he arrived, he added more 
offensive punch and also provided us with another pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
On the mound, the right-hander was 7-2 with a 1.95 earned-run average. But his 
future is not as a pitcher, it's with a bat. 
</P>
<P>
"The best hitter in the 2-A Division," a rival coach said. 
</P>
<P>
After what Seefried accomplished in 1990, it's tough to argue with that. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills opened the season with three losses, and the situation hadn't 
improved much by the time Bay League play started. The Titans were hammered by 
Beverly Hills, 13-1, in their opener. 
</P>
<P>
The lopsided loss left Poe searching for answers. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking, 'Will we ever win?' " he said. "We knew Beverly Hills was 
good, but wow." 
</P>
<P>
Before long, it was Rolling Hills' opponents who were saying, "Wow!" 
</P>
<P>
The Titans, who were not expected to challenge for the league title, came back 
later in the week to beat Beverly Hills at home. From there, they staged one of 
the great surprises of the season by tying Torrance and Beverly Hills, teams 
considered more talented and experienced, for the Bay championship. 
</P>
<P>
It made Poe's 20th season as coach perhaps his most satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the most enjoyable seasons I've ever had because the kids came 
so far," he said. "They improved so much and learned so much. Very few times 
have I had a team play more together as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills (13-12) needed to play together because it did not have any 
proven standouts to rely on. The Titans returned only three starters from the 
1989 team, and 12 of the 17 varsity players were underclassmen. 
</P>
<P>
But the players displayed a dedicated work ethic, a trait Poe credits for the 
team's rapid improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"We just knew we were doing things right in practice," he said. "All we had to 
do was tell the kids that things were going to fall into place. By the end of 
April we won because we had good practices in February and March." 
</P>
<P>
After bouncing back with the early victory over Beverly Hills, Poe said: "That 
had a lot to do with turning our season around. We started to believe in 
ourselves a little more." 
</P>
<P>
The Titans seemed to play with more faith when Kirt Kishita was on the mound. 
The junior right-hander, who had never pitched before on the varsity level, 
emerged as the team's ace. He posted a 9-5 record and beat every Bay League 
team at least once. He also posted two saves, meaning he had a role in 11 of 
Rolling Hills' 13 victories. 
</P>
<P>
Kishita pitched a 2-1 victory over St. Paul in the first round of the Southern 
Section 5-A playoffs. Then disaster struck in the second-round game. Leading 
Thousand Oaks, 10-1, going into the bottom of the seventh inning, the Titans 
gave up nine runs to the host school and lost in the eighth, 12-11. 
</P>
<P>
Poe called it the toughest defeat of his career, but was proud to say his team 
didn't dwell on it. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning is very important, but it's not everything," he said. "It can't be 
because you try to teach endurance. Kids are resilient, they're durable." 
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, Poe has demonstrated his durability as a coach and 
teacher. He is the chairman of the English department at Rolling Hills, and in 
1985 was honored as the Palos Verdes district's Educator of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
"It sends a message to the players that you can't put all your eggs in one 
basket," he said of his dual roles. "You have to approach the task, whether 
it's in the classroom or on the field. I enjoy both. I go to work with an 
enormous smile." 
</P>
<P>
This baseball season, Poe's grin was little wider than usual.

WHITTAKER HAS OPERATING LOSS; INTEREST COSTS CITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whittaker Corp. on Wednesday reported a $3.3-million loss from continuing 
operations for its fiscal second quarter on sales of $51.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
In the same period of last year, Whittaker posted income from continuing 
operations of $3.3 million on sales of $45.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Whittaker recorded a $2.1-million loss from discontinued operations during the 
second quarter, which ended April 30, contrasted with a profit of $4.3 million 
in that category during the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
A company press release blamed the downturn primarily on sharply higher 
interest expenses because of debt incurred in its 1989 recapitalization, which 
involved buying back stock and selling some parts of the business. The Los 
Angeles-based company now focuses on two areas: aerospace and biotechnology. 
</P>
<P>
Because of an $80.5-million gain from the sale of discontinued operations, 
Whittaker reported net income for the second quarter of $75.1 million. Net 
income was $12.6 million in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Whittaker also announced that it has replaced a $432.5-million bank line of 
credit with a $140-million credit facility. Whittaker took a $7-million pretax 
writeoff in the second quarter of unamortized costs from the old loan. 
Whittaker is reducing its debt faster than the company had planned, a spokesman 
said.

Texas Air Changing Name: Seven weeks after losing control of Eastern Airlines, 
Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo said the company would rename itself 
Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. after its main subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
"The name change was made to reflect the fact that the principal business of 
the company is Continental," Lorenzo told shareholders at the company's annual 
meeting. He told reporters later that the change doesn't mean Texas Air has 
given up completely on Eastern, but he declined to comment when asked whether 
he believed he would regain control of the carrier. The name change takes 
effect Monday.

HOUSE BARS SOVIET HIGH-TECH SALES; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: VARIOUS TYPES OF U.S. COMPUTERS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT WON'T 
BE SOLD TO MOSCOW UNTIL IT MEETS CERTAIN DEMANDS.

<P>
The House voted Wednesday to forbid the sale of sophisticated U.S. computers, 
telecommunications equipment and other high-tech goods to the Soviet Union 
until it ends its economic boycott against breakaway Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
In the first congressional action since President Bush and Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed a trade agreement last week, the House also voted 
to ban such sales if Gorbachev carries out a threat to slow the emigration of 
Soviet Jews. 
</P>
<P>
On a 390-24 vote, the House voted not to grant U.S. companies licenses to sell 
high-tech products to the Soviets unless President Bush certifies that Moscow 
is conducting negotiations with the Lithuanian republic, which has declared its 
independence from Moscow, "without economic coercion." 
</P>
<P>
The vote was on an amendment by Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., to an 
Administration-opposed bill that would ease the export of high-tech goods to 
the Soviets, the fledgling democracies of Eastern Europe and U.S. allies. 
</P>
<P>
On a voice vote, the House earlier agreed to forbid the high-tech sales if the 
Soviet Union restricts the emigration rights of Jewish citizens. 
</P>
<P>
To take effect, the full bill would have to be approved by the House and then 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the Soviet Union is moving toward peace and openness, it is not quite 
there," Durbin said. "The Iron Curtain is still present when it comes to the 
Baltic republics." 
</P>
<P>
Since April 18, the Soviets have cut off supplies of oil, natural gas, other 
raw materials and medical supplies to Lithuania in response to its declaration 
of independence a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Gorbachev signed an agreement Friday that would lower 40-year-old 
trade barriers between the two countries once the Supreme Soviet gives final 
approval to emigration legislation making it easier for Soviet citizens to 
emigrate or to visit the West. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow is particularly interested in acquiring U.S. telecommunications and 
computer technology. During last week's summit, for example, the Soviets signed 
an agreement with IBM for the purchase of computers to be used in schools. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint Sunday news conference with Bush, Gorbachev, citing pressure on him 
from Egypt and Syria, threatened to begin denying exit visas to Soviet Jews if 
Israel continues to allow them to settle on disputed territory on the West 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Official U.S. policy opposes Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. 
Supporters of Israel say fewer than 1% of the Soviet emigres actually locate 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Through other amendments, House lawmakers also expressed their dissatisfaction 
with President Bush's decision last month to extend for another year 
most-favored-nation trade status with China despite the killings near Tiananmen 
Square in Beijing more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
On a 393-15 vote, the House approved an amendment by Rep. Gerald Solomon, 
R-N.Y., that would forbid Bush from approving any more exports of U.S.-built or 
U.S.-owned satellites to China. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment, however, would not affect the export of three such satellites 
approved last December by Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents failed in several attempts to weaken the bill despite vehement claims 
by the Administration and other opponents that looser controls on high-tech 
sales will weaken the nation's military security. 
</P>
<P>
"The thrust of the bill is that business is more important than national 
security," said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill. "There are military and intelligence 
aspects to some of these telecommunications exports. We're crazy to hand that 
stuff to the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters, however, maintained that "cold warrior" attitudes should no longer 
dominate U.S. export policies. 
</P>
<P>
"Karl Marx wasn't smart enough to take on Jesus Christ, Adam Smith . . . and 
Thomas Jefferson simultaneously," said Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass. "We should 
accept our victory. Eastern Europeans are going to spend upwards of $140 
billion in the next decade on telecommunications and we should get a chunk of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., cited a study by the National Academy of Sciences 
estimating that the existing controls denied U.S. companies about $9.2 billion 
in exports in 1987 "with no perceptible increase in national security." 
</P>
<P>
The bill basically eases export controls on telecommunications equipment, 
computers and machine tools to the newly democratizing countries of Eastern 
Europe and, to a lesser extent, the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. manufacturers have repeatedly complained that they are being shut out of 
Eastern Europe's developing economy while Japan, West Germany and South Korea 
gain toeholds. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration last month announced that it intended to decontrol sales of 
most personal computers, some mainframe computers and some cellular and 
satellite ground stations. House critics contended that the measures do not go 
far enough in expanding trade opportunities, and earlier this week the Commerce 
Department told US West, the Rocky Mountain telephone company, it would deny 
permission to lay a high-capacity fiber optic cable across the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile: 
</P>
<P>
* The United States and the Soviet Union signed an agreement on sharing 
food-processing information. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement creates a team of U.S. and Soviet officials who will study the 
two nations' food-processing systems and determine how U.S. technology and 
methods can be incorporated into the Soviet system. 
</P>
<P>
* Yuri N. Chumakov, deputy Soviet minister of foreign economic relations, made 
it clear that if a U.S.-Soviet trade agreement wins congressional approval his 
country will be looking for U.S. loans to help the troubled Soviet economy.

DECEPTIVE PRACTICES ON '900' PHONE LINES HIT; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETING: A CONSUMER GROUP SAYS CALLING THE NUMBERS OFTEN COSTS MORE AND 
YIELDS LESS THAN EXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Advertised pay-per-call "900" phone information numbers often employ deceptive 
marketing tactics and ultimately cost consumers more than expected while 
providing less information, according to a national survey of 144 such phone 
lines to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer Action, a San Francisco-based group sponsoring the study, has asked 
telecommunications regulators to "stem the rip-offs" by enacting rules that 
would allow consumers to block 900 services, create uniform standards for 
advertising, require disclosure of costs and refunds, and develop enforcement 
powers to protect individuals from fraudulent 900 lines. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no consumer protections in place for out-of-state 900 calls," said 
Ken McEldowney, executive director of Consumer Action. "Since there are going 
to be more and more products delivered by the phone and billed by the phone, 
the Federal Communications Commission and the Public Utilities Commission are 
going to have to take responsibility to make sure consumers are not subjected 
to fraud and deception." 
</P>
<P>
The survey was the latest evidence of a growing public outcry over 900 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The pay-per-call industry was created in 1983 and now includes roughly 6,000 
services, according to Larry Podell, publisher of the Audiotex Directory &amp; 
Buyers Guide in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But fraudulent and deceptive practices are growing at an equally brisk pace, 
according to consumer groups. The National Consumers League in Washington, for 
example, ranked pay-per-call services as the top emerging telemarketing scam of 
the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen and heard from consumers on a number of issues," said Linda 
Golodner, the league's executive director. Among the main complaints: excessive 
costs, being put on hold and not disclosing costs up front. 
</P>
<P>
Still, little has been done to combat the problems, industry experts said. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal laws enacted in recent years provide at least limited 
protections from dial-a-porn numbers. But the courts have often blocked 
implementation of these laws, said Kathleen Flynn, a spokeswoman for Pacific 
Bell in Los Angeles. Pacific Bell has been in the forefront of fighting 
dial-a-porn and is seeking to block pornographic messages from its network 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer Action said it had been "overwhelmed by the slime" in the pornographic 
phone lines, but was much more concerned about marketing practices in the 
business and financial category. These are 900 lines that promise to repair 
credit, find jobs or provide "valuable" information about auctions, according 
to McEldowney. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't really criticize services like 'dial-a-joke' because some people 
might think it's worth $2 a minute," said Stephen B. Texeira, staff researcher 
at Consumer Action. "But when we started calling these (financial-oriented) 
numbers, it became very clear. We'd be on the phone for 10 minutes and get no 
information." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Consumer Action survey found a wide array of phone lines that 
advertised services that were not provided or were only provided at an 
additional cost. The consumer group compiled a list of a dozen such lines that 
promised to provide everything from credit cards to jobs and loans. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, the phone lines advertised relatively low costs -- such as $1 
per minute -- but sought to keep consumers on the line so long that the actual 
cost amounted to much more. 
</P>
<P>
One such line promised to help individuals find government jobs at a cost of $2 
per minute. However, all the tape-recorded voice offered was dozens of local 
phone numbers for government agencies that are "always hiring." By the time the 
numbers were all slowly dispensed, the bill totaled $20, Texeira said. And, 
incidentally, all the numbers provided are listed in the phone book. 
</P>
<P>
Others promised credit cards to those with credit problems. But the credit 
cards were either limited to buying products out of a single company's 
catalogue, or they required consumers to guarantee repayment by depositing 
amounts in excess of their credit limits into accounts held by the issuing card 
company. And none of the cards was cheap. Nearly all required "processing fees" 
that ranged from $30 to $55, not to mention annual fees and high interest 
rates, Texeira said. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Consumer Action said, services also often succumbed to a variety 
of other deceptions. These techniques included repeating information over and 
over; filling time with unnecessary chatter to keep callers on the phone 
running up higher fees; putting callers on hold; hanging up in the middle of a 
program so callers would call back; referring callers to another -- and often 
more expensive -- 900 number to get the promised information, or only 
advertising the fee for the first minute, thereby masking the total price.

Shuwa to Build Apartments: Shuwa Investments Corp., a Japanese concern that has 
invested heavily in "trophy" properties in the United States, said it plans to 
start developing apartments, beginning with a "high-quality" complex at an 
81,000-square-foot property on Wilshire Boulevard in West Los Angeles. Shuwa, 
which owns the Arco Plaza in Los Angeles, said the move into apartments is a 
"logical expansion" for the company.

In vacating a 1985 Federal Communications Commission rule Wednesday, a federal 
appeals court handed back to states authority to regulate newer telephone 
services such as voice mail and computer access. 
</P>
<P>
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals opinion, which affected seven lawsuits, means 
some telephone companies might have to set up separate corporations for their 
regulated normal telephone services and their unregulated extra options. The 
FCC would have allowed the companies to merge their regulated and unregulated 
services, but now that decision would rest with each state. 
</P>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission, which filed three of the lawsuits 
against the FCC, heralded the appeals court decision, but a spokesman for 
Pacific Bell said it could cost customers more in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
"It properly gives the states greater freedom to promote the development of 
enhanced services and the terms and conditions upon which those services are 
provided," PUC President G. Mitchell Wilk said. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Harris, director of planning and policy for Pacific Bell, said the 
company supports state regulation. But he said Pacific Bell fears state control 
could lead to a costly corporate division of its regulated and unregulated 
services -- something the FCC required in mid-1984 before it changed its mind 
14 months later, bringing on the 1987 legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not clear that we are going to have to split off," Harris said. "It's up 
to the states. But we strongly believe that independent subsidiaries are not 
necessary and would make it more difficult to provide the services to the 
public." 
</P>
<P>
Harris said innovative communications systems, which have developed rapidly in 
the past 10 years, are a multibillion-dollar industry that ranges from voice 
and electronic mail to automatic teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
An FCC spokeswoman said the opinion is a setback for the communications 
industry, which under federal rules had been required to merely keep finances 
separate for unregulated and regulated services but not create detached 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
"We adopted the rules because we believed they would be in the public 
interest," she said. "So, of course, we're disappointed in the outcome. We have 
to start from scratch." 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court ordered the FCC to develop new rules to help regulate new 
telecommunications services offered by the Baby Bell companies. Until the 
disputed FCC rule, those smaller firms had been prevented from providing 
information services under a court decree that stripped AT&amp;T of its local 
operating companies in January, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The court said the FCC arbitrarily and capriciously reversed itself without 
showing that cost-shifting between unregulated and regulated services wouldn't 
occur and raise the bills of "captive telephone customers." 
</P>
<P>
"The record yields no evidence that the (Bell Operating Companies) power to 
extract monopoly rents from local telephone customers has diminished," the 
court said. 
</P>
<P>
The complicated set of lawsuits attracted interveners from most 
telecommunications firms that compete with the telephone companies.

Playboy Mansion for Sale: The Art Institute of Chicago, which owns the 72-room 
Playboy Mansion on Chicago's elegant Gold Coast, is asking $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The mansion, with its bowling alley and swimming pool, was once famous for wild 
parties. Hugh Hefner, founder of Playboy Enterprises Inc., lived there until 
moving to Los Angeles. Playboy donated the property and $500,000 a year for 
maintenance to the museum in 1984 as a residence for art students. School 
officials said the 87-year-old mansion did not make a very good dormitory.

AIR FORCE MOVE MAY RAISE AIRLINE COSTS

A move by the Air Force to use the same jet fuel that powers commercial 
airliners may squeeze the nation's supply of the highly refined fuel and force 
up the airlines' fuel bill, industry sources say. 
</P>
<P>
The airlines' cost could soar $140 million to $420 million a year, based on the 
industry's current annual consumption of 14 billion gallons. 
</P>
<P>
At a cost of more than $7 billion, fuel is the air carriers' second-biggest 
expense, after labor. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in October, the Air Force will begin a long-planned changeover from 
JP4, a volatile naphtha-based jet fuel, to the more stable kerosene-based fuel 
JP8. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force says the switch will significantly improve the safety of its 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
But the switch-over is expected to boost jet fuel demand at a time when it 
already is surging, squeezing supplies of the special fuel. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we will have severe disruptions in supply," said a fuel broker based 
on the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Competition by the military and commercial airlines for the available fuel 
could be fierce. 
</P>
<P>
The added demand could raise prices by one to three cents a gallon, according 
to Ed Tolle, president of United Aviation Fuels Corp., a division of UAL Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"The big concern is that if the Air Force moves too quickly, it could have an 
impact on supplies," said Tim Neale of the Air Transport Assn., the industry's 
lobby group in Washington. "So far, the Air Force has said all the right things 
. . . it will give the industry a schedule on how it will switch fuel," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration projects that U.S. traffic will almost 
double to 807 million passengers annually by 2001, compared to 480 million in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
In three to five years, all of the nation's Air Force bases will be using the 
kerosene fuel. 
</P>
<P>
"There is going to be a greater demand for kerosene-based jet fuel. There is no 
reason to believe it is going to get cheaper," said Col. Rayde Harrington, 
chief of the Air Force's fuel policy branch. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the Air Force contracted to buy 4.1 billion gallons of JP4. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry knows it's the right thing for the Air Force to do. The key 
factor is how fast they do it," said Tolle. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington said the Air Force is committed to a gradual conversion. "We want to 
minimize the impact on everyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Harrington and others agreed that small refiners who rely on Air Force 
orders for naphtha-based fuel will be hardest hit.

Switzerland wants to join the 152 countries in the International Monetary Fund, 
which plays a key role in the world's financial system, fund officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Switzerland, concerned about its traditional neutrality, has been reluctant to 
join international organizations. In 1982, a government plan to join the fund 
was postponed after Swiss voters defeated a proposal to join the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Swiss government has had close informal relations with the fund. 
</P>

CREDITORS GET DREXEL PLAN FOR REORGANIZATION;

Drexel Burnham Lambert presented creditors on Wednesday with a tentative 
reorganization plan that at least nominally provides for full payment of debts 
and creates a much smaller post-bankruptcy company run by current management. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the tentative plan calls for smaller "everyday" creditors of 
Drexel's brokerage unit, such as vendors and contractors, to be paid in cash. 
The rest of the company's assets would be "up-streamed" to a new, 
post-bankruptcy company. 
</P>
<P>
The debts owed to the remaining, mostly larger creditors would be paid off with 
notes having a face value equal to the full amount of the remaining debt. 
</P>
<P>
But Barry Dichter, a lawyer at Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft, which 
represents one Drexel creditor, said there may be strong opposition to allowing 
current Drexel executives to manage the post-bankruptcy company. "Drexel's 
creditors are not going to want existing management to be in charge of the 
liquidation process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The new company would focus mainly on managing Drexel's remaining portfolio of 
junk bonds, bridge loans and other assets. By some estimates the portfolio is 
worth about $2 billion, but much of it isn't sellable in today's depressed 
market for junk bonds. Drexel executives contend that they will be able to 
realize more value from the portfolio by putting it in a post-bankruptcy 
company rather than liquidating everything immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The new company also would be permitted to engage in other ventures, mainly 
related to investment banking. But sources said the scope of the activities 
wasn't spelled out. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was presented in a closed meeting with select members of the creditors 
committee in the offices of Drexel's bankruptcy lawyers. It marks the start of 
what may be lengthy negotiations with creditors over a reorganization plan. 
Drexel has until June 13 to file a plan with the bankruptcy court but has 
requested an extension. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on 
Feb. 13 amid sharp declines in the junk bond market. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Miller, Drexel's lead bankruptcy lawyer, failed to return a call seeking 
comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting took place, a Drexel spokesman said the purpose of giving 
creditors the tentative plan was "to try to get their reaction and work with 
them to try to hone a plan." 
</P>
<P>
Some creditors have expressed doubts about the true value of Drexel's 
portfolio. One source close to the creditors committee complained that Drexel 
hasn't yet told them exactly what's in the portfolio.

Japan's Hitachi Ltd. unveiled a new computer that is faster than IBM's biggest 
mainframes, although industry analysts say the Japanese company will not likely 
sell enough of them to challenge the U.S. giant's lead. 
</P>
<P>
Hitachi Data Systems, owned 80% by Hitachi Ltd. and 20% by General Motors 
Corp.'s Electronic Data Systems Inc., introduced, as expected, three new models 
of its HDS EX Series mainframe computers. 
</P>
<P>
Two models, the EX 310 and EX 420, designed to meet increased computing 
capacities of the largest users of mainframe systems, will be shipped in the 
second quarter of 1991, Hitachi said. 
</P>
<P>
Initial shipments of a third model, the EX 85, are slated for the fourth 
quarter of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"The 420 will offer one-third more performance than the current competition," 
said James Balassone, Hitachi Data executive vice president-marketing, at the 
unveiling of the new high-end mainframe. 
</P>
<P>
Mainframes are large-scale computers often used for large business 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
Hitachi Data Systems' new computers are expected to outperform International 
Business Machines Corp.'s current line, the 3090s, but analysts disagree over 
whether they will jostle IBM's dominance of the $40-billion market. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect Hitachi to leapfrog IBM," said Bob Djurdjevic, an analyst at Annex 
Research.

Well, the Russians got there first -- up to a summit and back down again. 
</P>
<P>
To amuse themselves during the winter, daring Russians in the 15th and 16th 
centuries sledded down hills on wooden ice slides. "Russian Mountains" these 
slides were called, and they were the ancestor of all the world's roller 
coasters. 
</P>
<P>
Roller-coaster riders today can loop-the-loop, corkscrew and drop 188 feet in 
less than three minutes at 70 m.p.h. And in Southern California, riders can 
board some of the biggest and best of these awesome coasters. But be warned: 
These "incredible scream machines" are not for the faint of heart or stomach. 
</P>
<P>
This spring, Six Flag's Magic Mountain in Valencia unveiled the Viper -- "the 
tallest, fastest looping steel roller coaster in the world" -- and its three 
vertical loops, one corkscrew and one boomerang turn. 
</P>
<P>
With five other coasters, Magic Mountain has become a showcase for the "king of 
the rides business" in all its permutations. The amusement park is "striving to 
be the coaster capital of the U.S., and to introduce the best coasters in the 
marketplace," said spokeswoman Courtney Simmons. "We constantly poll the 
audience here and they always say the reason they come out here is for the 
coasters." 
</P>
<P>
Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park has opened a brand new state-of-the-art 
coaster called Boomerang that -- in less than a minute -- rolls three times 
forward and three times backward and upside-down along loops, corkscrews and 
two 11-story towers. 
</P>
<P>
Boomerang, according to Knott's publicist Robert Deuel, had its genesis on the 
bones of the old Corkscrew roller coaster built in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"The Corkscrew had outlived its level of technology, though it was a prototype 
for the whole genre of looping steel coasters and the first in the U.S. to do 
two 360-degree loops," Deuel said. "We wanted to replace Corkscrew with a 
higher level of thrills." 
</P>
<P>
But these three-minute wonders had humble and slow beginnings. 
</P>
<P>
From "Russian Mountains," the idea of a movable car on tracks went through 
several mutations. Near the turn of the 19th Century, the world's first roller 
coaster opened in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
In 1884, Sunday school teacher LaMarcus A. Thompson stunned Brooklyn's Coney 
Island when his "Thompson's Switchback Gravity Pleasure Railway," America's 
first commercial roller coaster, opened. The coaster had 450 feet of track, 10 
cars and a top speed of 6 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Many early roller coasters billed themselves as "scenic railways" with 
passengers sitting sideways to enjoy the view. 
</P>
<P>
By 1900, what we recognize today as the modern roller coaster was in full tilt 
and roaring about on tracks in Europe and the United States. The world's first 
two stand-up coasters were installed in Japan in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The first roller coasters in Southern California were erected on piers up and 
down the coast. In 1910, one of the best -- also called a "scenic railway" -- 
was developed by Thompson at Venice Beach. 
</P>
<P>
California's other famous roller coasters have included the Hi-Miler coaster at 
Del Mar Fair, the Giant Dipper at the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, the Playland 
amusement park coaster in San Francisco, and the Cyclone Racer at The Pike 
amusement center in downtown Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, thrill seekers throughout the years have ridden such historic 
coasters as the Wildcat in Bristol, Conn.; the steel coaster at Sea Breeze Park 
in Rochester, N.Y.; The Thunderbolt n Pittsburgh; the Silver Flash in Chicago; 
The Great American Scream Machine near Atlanta; the Loch Ness Monster in 
Williamsburg, Va.; the Judge Roy Scream at Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington; 
the Texas Cyclone at Astroworld in Houston, and the Montana Rusa ("Russian 
Mountain") in Chapultepec Park in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to roller coasters, gravity is crucial, because gravity is what 
keeps the roller coaster on track. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a quick physics lesson: There are two types of gravity forces: positive 
Gs (the kind that keep you in your seat) and negative Gs (the kind that pull 
you out of your seat on the downhill ride). The combination of these G-forces 
is the heart of the thrill and makes you scream like a banshee during that 
first loooooong drop down the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Corkscrew rides, for example, start out conventionally by tugging the car to 
the top of the lift and letting gravity take it from there over the plunges and 
climbs of the track. The car can hit 43 m.p.h. at the bottom of the first 
plunge, then the track flings the car through a corkscrew that turns riders 
upside-down -- not once, but twice. 
</P>
<P>
On the issue of wood versus steel roller coasters, there are purists who insist 
that wooden elevated rides are still the best. They stress that the creaking 
and moaning of the wood, and the smell of grease all add to the ride's 
uniqueness. On the other hand, steel coasters allow for stomach-dropping 
acrobatics because they can be twisted into corkscrews, pretzel turns and 
loops. 
</P>
<P>
Allen Ambrosini, publisher and editor of "At the Park," a magazine for the 
amusement-park trade, explained the difference between the two types of roller 
coasters in terms of the rides they give. 
</P>
<P>
"Steel coasters run out of steam faster; they loose their oomph at the end. 
Wooden coasters just keep on going," Ambrosini said. "Put it this way: A steel 
coaster can be compared to the Concorde and a wooden coaster is like a biplane. 
Both get you there, but in very different ways." 
</P>
<P>
But thrill rides often carry some risk, and although roller coasters have been 
touted by enthusiasts as "safer than marry-go-rounds," injuries and deaths have 
occurred. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
* In 1978, seven riders were injured on Disneyland's Space Mountain ride after 
two cars collided. That same year, a 20-year-old woman fell to her death from 
Magic Mountain's Colossus, and six people were injured after the braking system 
on the park's Great American Revolution roller coaster apparently 
malfunctioned. Also, a 24-year-old woman died after falling from the car and 
being dragged on the Cyclone at The Pike amusement center in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
* In 1979 in West Point, Pa., 12 children were injured when an attendant at 
West Point Amusement Park mistakenly released the brake and the car left the 
track. 
</P>
<P>
* In 1980, two young women were injured after being thrown from the High-Miler 
roller coaster running out of control at California State Fair in Sacramento. 
Also that year in Denver, five people suffered minor injuries when two coaster 
trains at Elitch Gardens amusement park collided. At Marriott's Great American 
amusement park in Santa Clara, a 13-year-old boy died and eight people were 
injured after an equipment malfunction caused two trains to collide. 
</P>
<P>
* In 1982 in Del Mar, two men were injured when the wheels of a Carnival Show 
Times car came loose and halted the ride. 
</P>
<P>
* In 1984 in Hamburg, West Germany, a man was killed and 13 people injured 
after a coaster car jumped the track, while in Eureka, Mo., a woman died of 
multiple injuries after being flung from the stand-up Rail Blazer coaster at 
Six Flags Over Mid-America. 
</P>
<P>
* In 1896 in Edmonton, Canada, three women were flung to their deaths after 
their car derailed on the $6-million Mindbender roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
* In 1987 in Jackson, N.J., a woman died after a 75-foot fall from the 
Lightnin' Loops coaster at Six Flags-Great Adventure amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
Though roller coasters proliferated across the national landscape during the 
early part of the century, their number dropped from a high of 2,000 in the 
1920s to a low of 147 in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the coasters closed during the Depression; others were razed to make 
room for suburban housing. 
</P>
<P>
But the ride's attraction, however, has never changed: "You feel like you're 
Superman. You lose all touch with the ground. You lose touch with the world," 
said Ambrosini in a 1980 interview. 
</P>
<P>
"Roller coasters provide one of the few sensations held in common for several 
generations in this country," Cleveland librarian Russell Hehr told The Times' 
Charles Hillinger in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the same sensations on roller coasters that our granddaddies did at 
the turn of the century -- that same feeling of safe insecurity that begins 
when the cars start clanking slowly up that first hill with impending doom 
lying ahead." 
</P>
<P>
A renaissance of sorts is occurring among roller coasters. Nationwide, they now 
number more than 200, with more in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
Paul L. Ruben, editor of Roller Coaster! Magazine and a director of the 
American Coaster Enthusiasts (which lists more than 3,000 members), attributes 
the return of roller coasters to the increasing number of people attending 
amusement parks. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, in seven parks that added new roller coasters, their attendance 
rose by 8.5%, though attendance in amusement parks in general rose 1.5%," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Amusement parks frequently ask their visitors what they like to see and 
invariably it's roller coasters. A roller coaster defines an amusement park and 
is good for business; it's an amusement you can't find anywhere else. They 
offer larger-than-life thrills. Not all of us can sky dive or be a race car 
driver." 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, roller coasters pay for themselves. "Even the Viper (at Magic 
Mountain), which cost $7 million, will pay for itself in two years," Ruben 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Beside the new Viper, Magic Mountain has a veritable plethora of coasters. 
There's the Great American Revolution, which opened in 1976, and Colossus, 
which opened in 1978 and is the only wooden roller coaster with two drops of 
more than 100 feet, a statistic which garnered a listing in the Guinness Book 
of World Records. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Mountain also has the Gold Rusher (a mine-car roller coaster), the Ninja 
(the only suspended roller coaster on the West Coast) and the Wily E. Coyote 
for little kids. Official roller coaster status for "Freefall," which is on 
tracks and does relies on gravity for speed, is debatable among coaster 
enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
Knott's Berry Farm also features Montezooma's Revenge which opened in 1978 and 
hits 0-55 m.p.h. in less than five seconds during a 38-second ride. 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland has the distinction of having the world's first steel roller 
coaster, the good ol' Matterhorn which opened in 1959. All those Vipers, 
Corkscrews and other rides trace their ancestry to the venerable Matterhorn. 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland also offers the eerie thrills of Space Mountain, which open in 1977 
and is one of the first roller-coaster trips to take place in almost total 
darkness. Disneyland's most recent coaster, the Big Thunder Mountain Mine Train 
near Frontierland, opened in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
And last but not least is the heart-warming tale of the dead coaster that 
rolled back to life. 
</P>
<P>
At Belmont Park in the Mission Beach area of San Diego, a great old wooden 
roller coaster called the Giant Dipper (and later the Belmont Earthquake) was 
built in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
Belmont Park closed in 1976 for a total revamp which did not include the roller 
coaster. But roller coaster lovers, many of them members of American Coaster 
Enthusiasts, persuaded the City of San Diego to spare the ride and honor the 
coaster's distinction as a national historic landmark. 
</P>
<P>
So this Fourth of July weekend, the Giant Dipper -- dedicated to all riders 
willing to take the plunge -- will roll once again. 
</P>

Remember Ashley Whippet, star of that '74 pennant race game between the Dodgers 
and Reds? His catch brought 50,000 Dodger Stadium spectators to their feet, not 
to mention the national TV viewers. 
</P>
<P>
It's late in the game; fignernail biting time. 
</P>
<P>
He's running -- 30-plus m.p.h. and leaps nine feet into the air to bring it 
down! A Frisbee that is. Ashley's between-inning heroics started a naionwide 
dog-soaring, Frisbee-catching craze. Unfortunately, his owner did time behind 
bars for trespassing. But this was no "agony of defeat." The thrill lives on.

Saturday the Ventura Department of Parks and Recreation will host the Ventura

Musician/composer/filmmaker David Byrne of Talking Heads fame will perform 
Tuesday at the Ventura Theatre, but don't expect a medley of his greates hits. 
</P>
<P>
Never shy about breaking new ground, Byrne currently is touring with a Latin 
American band, performing pieces from his most recent release, "Rei Momo," a 
combination of Latin and pop. 
</P>
<P>
Last year he came out with the albums "Beleza Tropical: Brazil Classics Volume 
One," and "O Samba: Brazil Classics Volume Two," a collection of samba and 
pagode music. Byrne's interest in Brazil has inlfuenced his video endeavors as 
well. His film "Ile Aiye" (The House of Life), a documentary about the 
country's Candomble Nao religion, looked into Yoruban dance-music rituals. The 
film debuted as the opening program of the PBS series "Live From Off Center." 
</P>
<P>
Byrne's interest in Afro-Brazilian culture dates to 1979, as evidenced by the 
African flavor of his music at the time. So real Talking Heads fans should be 
ready to samba. 
</P>
<P>
The theatre is located at 26 S. Chestnut St., Ventura. Show time is 8 p.m. 
Tickets are $27.50

THE SANTA SUSANA REPERTORY COMPANY MOVES SHAKESPEARE'S CLASSIC TO CALIFORNIA IN 
THE 1840S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Susana Repertory Company's production of "Romeo and Juliet" is 
ostensibly set in California, circa 1840. According to the company, the feud is 
now between Spanish landowners and Western (we assume that this means Anglo) 
cattle barons. 
</P>
<P>
Time has shown Shakespeare to be particularly subject to this kind of updating 
and geographical relocation. And if Akira Kurosawa can set "King Lear" in 
feudal Japan and MGM can successfully transport "The Tempest" to outer space 
(in 1955's "Forbidden Planet"), why can't the Simi Valley troupe set "Romeo and 
Juliet" among missions and palm trees? 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, the moving of the Montague-Capulet romance across a couple of 
hundred years and an ocean doesn't amount to much of a change at all. Director 
Lane Davies uses Shakespeare's original language, and Davies' and the 
production designers' concept of early California fashion doesn't look much 
different from what we're used to in Shakespeare produced in the traditional, 
Elizabethan setting. 
</P>
<P>
This is an area of California where many of the people have Italian names 
(Venice, perhaps?) and stage-English accents, where fights are settled by 
swordsmanship, rather than bullets or knives. The most obvious changes in 
language are references to Friar Laurence as "Padre," and an apothecary who 
shows up late in the play is now a American Indian medicine man. Earlier on, 
the Nurse (Irene Roseen) calculates Juliet's age by referring to an earthquake. 
However Californian that may sound, it's in the original. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the setting doesn't make that much difference: While it doesn't make 
the story any more contemporary (as "West Side Story" did so well), at least 
Shakespeare isn't pointlessly trashed. 
</P>
<P>
The production's strengths are largely physical: Matt Ventimiglia and Mark 
Winters' set design is atmospheric and terrific; Sean Willee's costumes are 
colorful, and the swordplay, credited to choreographer Michael Rossoddo and 
fight master Greg Michaels, is effective. 
</P>
<P>
More problematical is the acting, which in many cases amounts to little more 
than reading the lines as quickly as possible. "Romeo" is one of Shakespeare's 
longer plays, and at times this cast seems to have offstage bets as to who will 
finish first. Fortunately, it's a dead heat, coming in at just under three 
action-packed hours, including intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Those who do take their time to establish character -- Jeff Allin as Mercutio, 
Rajan Dosaj as Paris and Barry Kramer as Tybalt, for instance -- stand out in 
their ability to convey meaning, as well as meter. 
</P>
<P>
As Romeo, Paul Johansson is most convincing when grief-stricken, but in the 
first act is more of an athletic hunk than a romantic hero (nice physical work 
in the balcony scene, though). And a little more dramatic interpretation from 
the rest of the cast would have communicated the story better. Evidently, for 
instance, the Capulets are supposed to be Spanish. But Ishmael (East Carlos) 
rushes through his speeches as Juliet's father so quickly that his accent comes 
and goes. And none of the rest of the family looks particularly Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
The play is being presented inside a large tent, erected behind Simi Valley 
City Hall. Furnished with relatively comfortable plastic chairs and with decent 
sound and lighting, the facility is one of the more interesting performance 
spaces in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Susana Repertory Company is an intriguing mixture of amateurs and 
professionals. Fans of the TV soap opera "Santa Barbara" might recognize many 
of the players and backstage people -- including director Davies -- in this 
production. 
</P>
<P>
* THE DETAILS: "Romeo and Juliet" is scheduled to run Fridays through Sundays 
through June 24, plus July 15 and 20. Sunday performances are at 8 p.m. Fridays 
and Saturdays, curtain is 8:30 p.m. Admission is $15; all seats are reserved.

THE FORMER OWNERS OF VOILA HAVE TURNED OJAI'S OLD BACKSTAGE RESTAURANT INTO 
MK'S RESTAURANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE KEENEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marty Gay and his wife, Michelle Sandoval, who once turned a Ventura sandwich 
shop into Voila, the fanciest restaurant on Thompson Avenue, are up to their 
old tricks again. 
</P>
<P>
They have taken the old Backstage restaurant in Ojai and turned it into MK's 
Restaurant, with a menu Marty describes in two words: "intense tastes," and an 
ambience Michelle describes in three: "elegant and funky." 
</P>
<P>
After more than a year of planning and six months of furious preparation, MK's 
opened quietly last week for family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
"We just opened the door a crack and went pssst," Gay said. 
</P>
<P>
This soft opening gave them a chance to set all MK's systems in motion to see 
if the whole thing would fly. A full menu is now being offered, and the 
official grand opening is set for June 18. 
</P>
<P>
"People kept asking us if we got rid of the Backstage's pond," Sandoval said. 
"Well, when we got here there was nothing but a mosquito-infested garden, chin 
high in weeds." 
</P>
<P>
The pond is gone, but there's a waterfall -- MK's one touch of extravagance -- 
cascading out of a new stone wall. 
</P>
<P>
The deck, which was rotting, has been replaced. And the old wood paneling 
inside, which made the place so dark, has been ripped out and replaced with 
light, textured plaster. 
</P>
<P>
MK's -- the name consists of the couple's first and middle initials -- is more 
than just a renovated Backstage. A state-of-the-art computer ordering system 
has been installed. And there's a club concept at play here. More about that 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, MK's is an attempt to create a comfortable establishment where 
people feel at home and like to just hang out. 
</P>
<P>
There's a theme: California old and new. But, as Gay said, "You can't just 
create a theme on paper and apply it with a decorator. That never works." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they did much of the work themselves, with help from a coterie of 
artist friends. And they took their time. 
</P>
<P>
And, as it turned out, it was a good thing they weren't in a hurry. Sandoval 
had an automobile accident and that really slowed them down. There were the 
usual financial nightmares and bureaucratic snafus. And Voila itself demanded a 
great deal of attention, until it was sold this past January. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be here 15 hours a day," Sandoval said. "I'll practically live 
here. And because it's home, the atmosphere has to be different -- not like a 
business." 
</P>
<P>
"We found there were advantages to taking a long time," said Gay. "You make 
these finds. Things happen." 
</P>
<P>
The first inspiration for the design of MK's came in January of 1988 on a trip 
to Las Hadas, a resort in Colima, Mexico. Gay and Sandoval took one glance at 
the "Mexicanized Moorish" look, with its Mosques and whitewashed surfaces and 
said, "My God, that's it!" 
</P>
<P>
Their first big find was a three-candle Chumash candelabra, which they bought 
in Malibu and set in the middle of the mess they had created. 
</P>
<P>
Another key find was a set of Ann Mallory-designed plates, with six patterns of 
sumi brushwork representing joy, risk, balance, blessing, change and unity. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we saw them we realized they were perfect for Ojai," Sandoval said. 
</P>
<P>
Once Voila was sold, the work went faster. They refinished the pine floor at 
the front entrance, said to have been milled in 1908 for the old Oaks Hotel. 
Then artist Julia Pinkham, who usually works on fabric, painted a rug based on 
a Chumash ceremonial design. 
</P>
<P>
The ceiling remains the same: corrugated metal and exposed beams. "We were 
going to change it," Sandoval said, "but when the walls were done, it looked 
good." 
</P>
<P>
Both Sandoval and Gay enjoyed the do-it-yourself part. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned to whitewash, refinish, rivet -- God, all kinds of stuff," Sandoval 
said. "And I'm watching the drywallers, so when we build our own house I'll 
know how." 
</P>
<P>
Gay is proud of a solid, once-beautiful mahogany door that he destroyed on 
purpose. "We're in 1990 now, but we wanted to think of this place as having 
existed 70 years," he said. So he sanded the door down, beat it with chains and 
painted over the fine wood. All part of the concept. 
</P>
<P>
The takeout area is draped with Mexican gourds and local bananas, and picnic 
baskets that can be bought or borrowed for excursions to Libby Park. Twenties 
and '30s velvet "Deco senoritas" add to the old California look. 
</P>
<P>
The menu is California old and new. It's not in-your-face vegetarian, but a 
large part of the menu will revolve around grains and vegetables. Cream, eggs 
and butter have not been eliminated, but vegetarians will feel very comfortable 
here. 
</P>
<P>
And for people who want meat, it's there. The New York steak will be served 
with roasted garlic butter. And the hamburger will be, if the menu is correct, 
"big, juicy and everything ground cow should be." 
</P>
<P>
"The Board" keys the whole menu. It's a wooden grazing platter of items such as 
grilled vegetables, soft cheese, salsa and "surprises." Put them in tacos, 
stuff them in pita bread or eat them as finger food. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not afraid to have people say, 'This sounds spicy,' " said Gay. "You'll 
taste onions, chutneys and all kinds of chili. I make six different salsas 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Some customers have paid for their food in advance. One night, Gay, bleary-eyed 
at his computer, having already spent his entire bankroll, came up with the 
concept of a private membership club. Originally, it was a fund-raising device, 
through which people paid $3,000 and were given a $3,500 trade account. 
"Besides the fact that these people trusted us in the beginning, which you 
can't buy, we wanted to give them something extra," Gay said. 
</P>
<P>
Club El Nido offers wine tastings, parties, a newsletter, discounts on retail 
items and first right of refusal for invitations to special events. Memberships 
are available to the public for $175. 
</P>
<P>
Gay and Sandoval are in a period of adjustment. They're confident in their 
ability to cook and serve, but there are kinks to be worked out before June 18.

NIKI BRACKEN OF CAL POLY POMONA ATHLETE OF YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal Poly Pomona forward Niki Bracken, who helped the Broncos to a third-place 
finish at the NCAA Division II women's basketball tournament, has been named 
the 1989-90 California Collegiate Athletic Assn. female athlete of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-2 Bracken also was named CCAA player of the year and was selected to 
the Kodak Division II All-America team for the second season in a row. She has 
made the Division II All-Final Four team three times, the first women's 
basketball player in the division to accomplish the feat. 
</P>
<P>
In her final season with the Broncos, Bracken averaged a team-leading 18.6 
points and 9.4 rebounds. She finished with a school-record 2,246 points and 
became only the third player in Division II to finish with more than 2,000 
points and 1,000 rebounds. She also holds school records for most points in a 
season (619) and most points in a game (44). 
</P>
<P>
Bracken became the first Bronco to win CCAA athlete of the year honors since 
basketball and track standout Debra Larsen in 1986. Guard Wade Green of Cal 
State Bakersfield, who led the Roadrunners to second place in men's basketball, 
was selected CCAA male athlete of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal Poly Pomona women's basketball team has signed Remitha Houston of 
Washington High to a national letter of intent. 
</P>
<P>
Houston, a 5-6 guard, was selected 4-A Division co-player of the year and made 
the All-Southern League team for the third consecutive season. She also was 
chosen as most valuable player of the City-CIF All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior, Houston averaged 20.1 points and scored 30 or more points in seven 
games. Washington was ranked as high as No. 13 in the nation by USA Today and 
won its second consecutive 4-A championship. 
</P>
<P>
Houston, who ranks second in school history with 1,338 points in her career, is 
the third player Pomona has signed. The others are Nicole Sanders, a 5-5 guard 
from Lynwood, and Andrea Haynes, a 6-0 forward from Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
Three teams from the San Gabriel Valley have been honored in the fifth annual 
CIF Southern Section Academic Awards Program. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena Poly was the winner in baseball and football and Rosemead won in 
badminton. The awards go to teams with the highest cumulative grade-point 
averages in 21 sports during the 1989-90 athletic year. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemead posted a 3.69 grade-point average in badminton and Pasadena Poly was 
at 3.56 in baseball and 3.35 in football. 
</P>
<P>
The teams will be honored during a ceremony before the Angels-Kansas City 
Royals game Tuesday at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The South El Monte-based Los Angeles Junior Lakers basketball club has been 
invited to send an all-star team of Latino high school players from the 
Southland to compete in the Sun, Surf and Slam Tournament June 24-July 2 in 
Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
The team will include San Gabriel Valley players Anthony Calvillo of La Puente 
and Rich Soto of Nogales. Calvillo was the sixth-leading boys scorer in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
The squad still needs to raise $3,500 for the trip and is seeking sponsors.

<P>
When my not-so young Ojai friends come down to L.A. for dinner, I always try to 
have a sort of piece de resistance for them to make the hour-and-a-half trip 
worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
One time I invited a couple just back from China. Another time I showed the 
video of a terrific French film. The last time I invited Helen Colton, a touch 
therapist. 
</P>
<P>
Helen is very outspoken about her field, sex therapy. So I was a little anxious 
but thought my guests would enjoy her. 
</P>
<P>
She came with her companion, retired screenwriter Bobby Lees. Dinner went well. 
Bobby, who wrote the Abbott and Costello comedies of the '30s and '40s, told 
wonderful old Hollywood stories. 
</P>
<P>
After dinner I took Helen aside to ask her advice. I showed her a letter I'd 
received from a reader, which began "Dear Norma" but seemed intended for Dr. 
Ruth. It read: 
</P>
<P>
"I am 65 and my husband is 70. We've been married 10 years, second marriages 
for both of us. Up to six months ago when we moved to a retirement community, 
sex was exciting and regular. My husband plays tennis, even singles, so I know 
he's in good physical shape, but he seems to have lost interest. What should I 
do?" It was signed "Trouble in Paradise." 
</P>
<P>
I also showed Helen my reply: 
</P>
<P>
"If sex was so great for 9 1/2 years and it diminished in quantity and quality 
just when you moved, it must have had something to do with the move. Either 
your husband has met someone else, maybe a tennis player, or something about 
the new setting is not conducive to lovemaking. 
</P>
<P>
"Try coming to L.A., see a show, spend the night in a hotel with breakfast. 
Perhaps changing surroundings and breaking out of a tight closed-in 
togetherness might help." 
</P>
<P>
Then she stopped and clapped her hands until the talking died away and she had 
everyone's attention. "I think you should hear what I'm advising Norma to say 
in her column. It can only do you good. We're all from a very inhibited 
generation." (Helen is seventysomething herself.) "The young may have had a 
sexual revolution, but we haven't. 
</P>
<P>
"Masters and Johnson, the pioneer sex researchers, started a two-week course 
for couples. The partners are told to begin by touching each other's body -- 
lovingly, slowly, tenderly, gently, playfully -- everywhere but in the genital 
and breast areas. The partners take turns, one being the toucher, the other the 
touched. They discover that they get sensual stimulation and feel exquisite 
pleasure without having to have intercourse. What's more, they keep getting 
aroused over and over. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
She paused for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
"When the pressure's off -- that is, when the impotent male sees he doesn't 
have to perform -- he finds he's getting erections more often and keeping them. 
</P>
<P>
"The non-orgastic female," Helen continued, "learns her body can respond with 
intense desire when her face, lips, eyes, ears, abdomen, knees, and shoulders 
are stroked and her most sensitive areas are deliberately left untouched. 
Eventually, those sensitive areas cry out for contact. At the end of a two-week 
period . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"Two weeks?" somebody gasped. "You keep that up that long?" 
</P>
<P>
" . . . when they've learned to touch each other," Helen went on calmly, 
"couples are given permission to have intercourse -- and generally they're able 
to have a satisfying sex act." 
</P>
<P>
"That was very interesting," I said, hoping to put an end to it. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I've got more," Helen said. "For example, the morning is frequently 
better than the evening -- testosterone levels are higher, and older people are 
fresher. Or I could point out that if nude in bed gets boring, clothed on the 
sofa may be diverting. In other words, time and place and conditions can be 
changed. But the important thing to remember is, as Ashley Montagu, the great 
anthropologist once said, 'Half the world's frenetic sex may be a search for 
the gratification of the need for touch.' " 
</P>
<P>
I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw Helen had finished. But the guests left 
soon afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
"They left so early," I complained to Bobby as he and Helen turned to go. 
"Maybe it's just because some have a long trip ahead. But it does look as if my 
dinner party was a big bomb." 
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary," said Bobby dryly. "They couldn't wait to get home to try out 
some of Helen's advice."

JOSEPH N. BELL: ENSHRINING THE DUKE AT THE AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those of you out there who -- like me -- have spent many sleepless nights 
wondering if the airport statue of John Wayne would be showcased with proper 
reverence can relax now. It will be. I checked it out. 
</P>
<P>
I've worried about that a lot. After all, we have the only airport in the world 
with the statue of a movie star out front -- especially a movie star whose main 
means of locomotion was not the airplane but the horse. Quaint symbolism, 
indeed. There are those among us who would like to see this distinction removed 
and substitute some sort of prosaic name like Orange County Airport. Or Eddie 
Martin Airport -- on the grounds that he flew airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are those of us who are worried about the statue. I expressed 
this concern the other day to Airport Commissioner Michael Lapin, who happened 
to be having brunch in our patio. I had to express it several times before he 
heard me over the sound of planes taking off and landing. He not only assured 
me that John Wayne would be properly enshrined but invited me to come and see 
for myself. He was to be given a tour of the new facilities the following week, 
so I tagged along. 
</P>
<P>
Our tour guide of the John Wayne Airport and its new terminal turned out to be 
Jan Mittermeier, the assistant airport manager, and she poked into every cranny 
of the new terminal with us. Now I have not been unmindful of all the acrimony 
going on about the delays in construction of the terminal and surrounding 
support facilities. I'm as anxious as the next guy to get out of that sweatbox 
of a terminal that presently serves a few million people over its capacity. But 
I was also curious about looking behind the construction and economic 
tribulations to see what we have to look forward to. And to make sure that the 
Duke has been well served. 
</P>
<P>
So let's deal with that first. The Wayne statue will not just be prominently 
displayed, it will be enshrined. And it's no longer outside, subject to the 
elements, but will be mounted in an enormous glass sarcophagus near the main 
entrance of the terminal. Although we're far behind on other portions of 
construction, the Duke Room is right on schedule. The base for his statue is in 
place and the wall-to-ceiling glass surrounding it is completed. So not to 
worry. Our reputation is intact. 
</P>
<P>
Unhappily, the rest of the terminal hasn't progressed quite that well. But the 
promise is there. Beneath the debris and the swarms of workers and 
recriminations is the hope of a new day for those of us who fly in and out of 
this airport. 
</P>
<P>
The thing that struck me first and last is the feeling of spaciousness. 
Admittedly, the design of the airport terminal enhances this feeling more than 
is really justified. "The terrain," said Mittermeier, "dictated the 
architecture. So did the settlement of the Newport Beach lawsuit, which 
dictated the size of the terminal and how the space had to be allocated. We 
were bound to a long, relatively narrow space for the terminal. We had no other 
way to go." 
</P>
<P>
The result is a kind of multiple zeppelin effect (for those of you too young to 
know what a zeppelin is, look it up). All 14 of the loading gates to the planes 
open off a single, long, open corridor. This is the small zeppelin. The waiting 
areas will be separated from the walking area only by different colored 
carpeting; no walls or other barriers to break the sense of space. 
</P>
<P>
The large zeppelin is the ticketing and concourse area. Lighting is indirect 
from enormous saucers mounted in the wall and casting the light upward over the 
circular ceiling. There was originally to have been a skylight the length of 
the concourse, and -- according to Mittermeier -- airport officials saved about 
$1 million by eliminating it. Personally, I think we needed the million bucks 
more than the skylight. There is so much glass in the structure already that 
the place exudes light. 
</P>
<P>
They also cut costs by a million bucks on the marble which was originally to 
have decorated all the floors and interior walls and some exterior walls. By 
cutting down considerably on marble interiors, a lot of money was saved not 
only on the marble, itself, but on the acoustics, which will work much better 
with the carpeting and sheet rock that were substituted. The marble, I was 
told, came from an Italian swamp and has crustaceous figures embedded in it. I 
checked, and it does. I haven't yet sorted out the significance of this, but 
Mittermeier made a small joke about it, saying the crustaceous surface was easy 
to maintain "as long as we feed them regularly." 
</P>
<P>
Two of the major irritations in the present terminal will disappear in the new 
one. There are two large, open security points designed to move passengers 
through quickly. And two spacious baggage areas serviced by four chutes that 
quadruple the handling capacity. 
</P>
<P>
There will be an interior bar surrounded by palm trees and glass for the 
peasants and the whole third floor devoted to the Admiral's Club for the rich 
folks. There will also be four times as many parking places. 
</P>
<P>
When I went through the terminal in late May, I was startled at how much still 
needs to be done on the interior. Driving past it gives the illusion that it is 
almost finished. It isn't. But Mittermeier still believes stoutly that it will 
open in mid-September. She explained that it can't be opened piecemeal because 
the agreement with Newport Beach prevents the airport from operating out of two 
terminals at once. 
</P>
<P>
It occurred to me that the new terminal will be just like a new freeway, 
crowded to capacity as soon as it opens. Mittermeier says not so. There is a 
cap of 8.4 million passengers (about twice the current load) until the year 
2005, when the agreement with Newport Beach expires. "We expect the number of 
passengers to increase rapidly to the new cap," she said, "but the new terminal 
should handle them comfortably." 
</P>
<P>
That's how it looks to me, too. I feel better about it now, knowing I'll be 
able to find breathing space in the new terminal -- if it ever opens. 
Meanwhile, I won't be worrying about the statue of the Duke any more. He's 
being looked after splendidly.

POOL SAFETY; 
</P>
<P>
EXPERTS ADVISE NOT TO WAIT UNTIL NEAR-TRAGEDY TO SAFEGUARD YOUR POOL. FOR A FEW 
THOUSAND DOLLARS, YOU CAN BUILD A SERIES OF DEFENSES THAT WILL GIVE YOU PEACE 
OF MIND EVEN WHEN THE CHILDREN ARE OUT OF SIGHT. 
</P>

<P>
Six-month-old Morgan Pace of Westminster is still too young to crawl, but her 
parents are taking no chances. Janet and David Pace have installed a 
wrought-iron safety fence around their swimming pool to make sure Morgan does 
not become another Orange County drowning statistic. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to child-proofing the family pool, the Paces are still the 
exception rather than the rule. More often than not, fences, pool covers and 
other safety devices are installed after a near-tragedy has occurred, not 
before. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the added expense, pool owners find most safety precautions 
inconvenient and downright unaesthetic. Janet Pace has no patience with such 
notions: "My baby's life is far more important than whether a fence looks nice 
or not." 
</P>
<P>
Drowning, the leading cause of death for children under the age of 5, is 100% 
preventable, yet drownings in Orange County are climbing. Although the pool 
season has just begun, six people, five of them children, have already lost 
their lives in pool and spa accidents around the county. Total drowning deaths, 
including those in bathtubs, was nine last year. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Landis, founder of the Children's Pool Safety Assn., says: "Public 
awareness is well up, but people still aren't taking the next step -- making 
their pools child-safe -- because they don't think it's going to happen to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet the fact remains that having small children in the same house as a 
swimming pool is like playing Russian roulette. A child is 14 times more likely 
to die in a pool accident than in a car accident." 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, all pool owners are required to install perimeter fencing 
around their property but not necessarily around their pools. Downing 
prevention advocates point out that fencing around the home safeguards only the 
neighbors' kids, while most drowning victims are children who have died in 
their own family pool. 
</P>
<P>
Safety experts are lobbying to change the law to require that the pools be 
enclosed on all sides. They stress, however, that a fence is only the first 
step in making a pool safe for children. 
</P>
<P>
"We have heard of children putting a tricycle on top of a toy box and then a 
beach ball on top of the tricycle and climbing over the fence," says Mary Anne 
Sager, chairwoman of Save Our Kids, the Orange County Trauma Society's drowning 
prevention group. 
</P>
<P>
The key to preventing a pool tragedy, according to Sager, is understanding 
that, given enough time, any bright child is going to figure out a way to 
bypass a barrier. 
</P>
<P>
"You therefore have to put up several layers of protection to buy time for 
yourself before you realize your child is out of sight," she says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fencing 
</P>
<P>
To be truly safe for children, a fence has to enclose the pool entirely to 
prevent access from back doors, side gates and open garages. Chain-link fencing 
is inappropriate because it can be easily climbed. 
</P>
<P>
Wrought iron is the most popular choice for safety-fencing. Slats should be 
vertical and unadorned -- ornate scrollwork provides a wonderful foothold for 
young climbers. The Trauma Society specifies that such fences be at least five 
feet high and that slats be no more than four inches apart, including where the 
fence meets the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Fences should enclose the pool and nothing more to minimize the amount of 
non-pool traffic within the fenced area. The more often adults have to enter 
the area to get garden tools or to use the barbecue, the higher the chances 
that the gate will be accidentally left open. A fence is only a fence if the 
gate is closed. 
</P>
<P>
A gate should always open outward so a child pushing against it will close it. 
It should be self-closing and self-latching. The latching mechanism should be 
at the top of the gate, where children will not be able to reach it. 
</P>
<P>
A pool-code wrought-iron fence, which can be installed in less than a day, 
averages about $12 per foot, with gates starting at about $75. 
</P>
<P>
A popular alternative to the wrought-iron fence is the nylon-mesh fence. 
</P>
<P>
Because the mesh is attached to aluminum poles that slide into the ground at 
three-foot intervals around the pool, the entire fence can be removed in five 
to 10 minutes. This makes it the ideal fence for grandparents or for pool 
owners who entertain while the children are out of the house. It can also be 
removed once the children are grown, then used on those occasions when guests 
bring small children. 
</P>
<P>
The fence is installed 24 inches from the edge of the pool to maximize yard 
space and to minimize non-pool traffic in the pool area. Tough polymer-coated 
mesh is weather-resistant, practically impervious to tears, too fine to allow 
little toes a hold for climbing and soft enough not to injure an unsteady 
toddler who may fall against it. And because toys or pets cannot pass through 
or under the mesh, children are not tempted to try to get to the other side to 
retrieve them. 
</P>
<P>
These fences can be installed in one day for $1,000 to $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pool and Spa Covers 
</P>
<P>
Not all pool covers are for safety. In fact, many solar covers -- whose primary 
purpose is to conserve heat and prevent water evaporation -- can actually be 
deathtraps. Because they are not attached to the pool, they can collapse under 
the weight of a child and suffocate him. Worse, a child can easily slip, 
unseen, under such a cover, which then keeps him under water and out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
True safety covers, such as those distributed by Cover Pool Inc. of Tustin and 
Poolsaver Inc. of San Dimas, have to meet safety standards, including attaching 
in some way to the sides of the pool. They also have to be strong enough to 
support the weight of at least two adults. And because a child can drown in as 
little as two inches of water, many of them come with a pumping device to 
remove rainwater that may collect on top. 
</P>
<P>
These covers are available for both rectangular and irregularly shaped pools 
and can be either automatic or manually operated. 
</P>
<P>
At the touch of a button, an automatic cover runs out on two sets of tracks, 
which extend along the pool's deck or are recessed into it. With a 
semiautomatic system, the cover is pulled out manually and snapped down around 
the deck. To remove it, the snaps are unfastened, and the cover retracts 
automatically at the push of a button. With a manual system, the cover is both 
pulled and rewound by hand. 
</P>
<P>
For extra safety, push-buttons should be out of children's reach, hand cranks 
should be lockable and manual snaps should be of the type that can be 
disconnected only with a special tool. 
</P>
<P>
Most safety covers can be installed in one day. Prices start about $2,000 for 
manually operated covers, while fully automatic covers cost $5,000 to $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
Spas are as dangerous for children as pools, but few people are willing to 
fence in the family spa. So they resort to lightweight spa covers for safety. 
The Admiral Aluminum spa cover, which is sold by most spa dealers, is the only 
one that locks down with a special key. In addition, it can support up to 300 
pounds and lasts considerably longer than most standard spa covers. A 
custom-made cover costs $450 to $600. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Securing the House 
</P>
<P>
In 70% of all drownings, the child was last seen inside the house. It is 
therefore crucial to secure all exits that lead to the pool so small children 
are unable to get out of the house unsupervised. 
</P>
<P>
Both doors and windows should have appropriate locks and latches. Locks on 
doors should be high enough to be out of their reach, and climbing aids such as 
boxes, tables and footstools should be out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of such precautions, children still make their way outside when doors 
are left open, often by other children. Inexpensive sound alarms, available at 
most hardware stores and easy to mount, will alert adults each time a door or 
window is opened or left ajar. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Last Line of Defense 
</P>
<P>
Pool alarms sit on the water surface and sound a loud signal when they detect 
movement in the water. Safety advocates recommend pool alarms only as a final 
backup, such as when the pool cover is off and guests are visiting, or if pool 
and garden workers may leave the gate unlatched. Pool alarms are priced as low 
as $80, but these are so sensitive that they are constantly reacting to such 
disturbances as wind or leaves falling into the pool. Remote alarms such as 
those made by Remington may cost about $150 but offer the added feature of 
being heard inside the house as well. 
</P>
<P>
Although video monitors smack of hi-tech surveillance, few professionals 
believe they provide little ones any measure of safety around a pool. 
</P>
<P>
"Distractions are distractions," says Sager of Save Our Kids. "Just like you 
are not going to be standing at the window staring at the pool, you're not 
going to be able to stare at the video monitor without interruption." 
</P>
<P>
Some pool owners are installing photo-electric eyes: light beams that stretch 
across the yard like an invisible fence. But a child will trip the alarm only 
once he has broken through the beam and is on his way to the pool, which gives 
a parent just seconds to race from the front of the house to the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Many safety advocates are reluctant to endorse pool alarms in principle because 
they sound only once a child is in the water. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Saving Precious Time 
</P>
<P>
"It only takes a few seconds for a child's system to shut down," Sager says. 
"If you don't know what to do once you get to them, the product serves no 
purpose." 
</P>
<P>
A parent's ability to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation while paramedics 
are on the way has meant the difference between life and death for countless 
drowning accident victims. The Red Cross offers free courses in CPR in several 
locations. Once trained, you should be recertified each year to keep your 
skills from getting rusty. 
</P>
<P>
A precaution as simple as installing an extra phone jack near the back door or 
keeping a cellular phone near the pool can also make every second count in a 
life-and-death emergency. 
</P>
<P>
For some people, however, even layers of protection aren't enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very concerned about the pool in the back yard," says one young 
Mission Viejo mother of three. "We had it fenced in, but my 2 1/2-year-old was 
already trying to scale it. We had alarms, but I didn't feel secure. And with 
pool covers, once they are off, you are faced with the same danger." 
</P>
<P>
The family's solution was a drastic one. They filled in the pool with gravel, 
topped it off with sod and installed a swing set for the children. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very radical move, and I am not advocating it for anybody else," the 
young mother says. "But for us, it's marvelous. I can read or fall asleep for a 
few minutes without worrying about anything happening. I wouldn't have it any 
other way." 
</P>

1990 Pool Drownings 
</P>
<P>
Krystal Lynn Marquis, 18 months 
</P>
<P>
Drowned Feb. 22 in a man-made pond at The Streams apartment complex in 
Fullerton. The child was playing unattended downstairs at her mother's fiance's 
apartment. He thought she was upstairs, supervised by her mother. 
</P>
<P>
Randi Newkirk, 5 
</P>
<P>
Died April 15, four days after firefighters pulled her from the bottom of her 
grandparent's swimming pool in Fullerton. Her three-year-old sister, Robyn, 
nearly drowned in the same incident. The children were left briefly unattended 
by their grandmother while playing on the steps at the shallow end of the pool. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Munoz-Lemus, 36 
</P>
<P>
Drowned April 22, while baby-sitting a 2-year-old boy at a friend's house in El 
Toro. The child's cries from the backyard pool alerted a neighbor, who found 
Munoz-Lemus on the bottom on the pool. The child was secured in a flotation 
ring, but Munoz-Lemus had been dead for two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Kazarina Hariluk, 1 - Died April 27, four days after she fell into her family's 
backyard hot tub in Corona Del Mar. The child, who had wandered outside, was 
discovered within minutes, but paramedics were unable to revive her. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Mallace, 18 months - Drowned April 29 in a backyard swimming pool at his 
Placentia home. He was playing downstairs with his three-year-old brother, and 
wandered unnoticed out a patio door when his mother left to go upstairs for a 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
Bryden Sanborn, 3 - Drowned May 12 in a hot tub at the Cavalier Inn &amp; 
Suites in Garden Grove. The boy wandered into the tub during an unsupervised 
visit to the pool area with his 9-year-old brother.

Drowning-Prevention Tips for Families with Pools 
</P>
<P>
Kid-proofing your pool means constructing several alyers of protection: 
</P>
<P>
WHAT TO DO 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SAFETY COVERS 
</P>
<P>
* A child can slip unnoticed under a normal solar cover. A safety cover on the 
other hand attaches in some way around the perimeter of the pool. 
</P>
<P>
* Cover should be strong enough to support the weight of at least two adults. 
</P>
<P>
* Since a child can drown in as little as 2" of water, some kind of pumping 
device is needed to remove rain or sprinkler water that collects on the cover's 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FENCING 
</P>
<P>
* Enclose the pool completely -- most drownings occur when children wander out 
of the back door of their own house. 
</P>
<P>
* The fencing should be made of plain wrought iron -- children can use 
embellishments for climbing. 
</P>
<P>
* Fencing should be at least five feet high; bars should be no further than 
four inches apart. Gap where fence meets garden wall should not be wider than 
four inches. 
</P>
<P>
* Include as little as possible within the fencing. Access to barbecue pit, 
pool supplies, etc. increases adult traffic, thereby increasing the odds of the 
gate being accidently left open. 
</P>
<P>
* Gates should open outwards and should be self-closing and self-latching 
beyond a child's reach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AUXILIARY SAFETY: 
</P>
<P>
* Secure all doors leading to the pool area with childproof locks and latches. 
Inexpensive sound alerts, available at hardware stores, give off an alarm when 
a door is opened. 
</P>
<P>
* Video monitors inside the house scan pool activity. 
</P>
<P>
* A telephone extension in the patio area can save precious seconds during an 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
* Learn CPR. 
</P>

<P>
When William Newland and his wife, Mary, set out from Illinois in the late 
1800s, their destination was Northern California. After a brief stop in 
Compton, however, they ended up in what was then called Pacific City, now 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
They at first leased land on the Irvine family's San Joaquin Rancho and grew 
grains, earning for William the nickname "the barley king." Sometime after 1897 
he purchased 500 tule-covered acres -- by any other name a swamp. 
</P>
<P>
But Newland recovered the land for cultivation and in this very fertile ground 
produced celery, lima beans, chili peppers and sugar beets in the low areas. 
Atop a nearby mesa he also continued the grain production for which he was best 
known. 
</P>
<P>
The bluff-top site of the Newland family home provided an excellent view of the 
ocean and the farmlands. That building, a 13-room, wood-frame farmhouse built 
in 1898, is said to be the last remaining example of Queen Anne-style Victorian 
architecture in Huntington Beach and today houses a museum -- the Newland 
House. 
</P>
<P>
The survival of the Newland House, designated now as an Orange County Historic 
Site and placed on the National Register of Historic Places, is a familiar 
story. The house and surrounding farmland were leased to the Signal Oil Co. 
after Mrs. Newland's death in 1952. Public outcry forced the company to abandon 
plans to build a refinery on the property. Signal subsequently offered the 
house and 30 adjacent acres for a city park. 
</P>
<P>
But vandalism and a devastating fire nearly destroyed the house in 1974. Then 
the city threatened to tear it down unless the Huntington Beach Historical 
Society undertook a restoration. 
</P>
<P>
The renovation was almost complete in 1980 when a Signal subsidiary, Signal 
Landmark Inc., proposed surrounding the building with a 190,000-square-foot 
shopping center. Numerous meetings and public hearings produced a compromise: 
The farmhouse would be accentuated as the focal point of the development, a 
planned two-story office building would be lowered 10 feet in order to preserve 
the Newland House's view of the sea, and the color and architecture of the 
proposed shopping center would complement the house. 
</P>
<P>
Another challenge came that year from an unexpected source whose claim to the 
land predated the white man's settlement in Orange County. Archeologists, 
having excavated artifacts dating back more than 1,000 years, had determined 
that the Newland property was originally the site of an Indian village. Thus 
the historical society's plans to plant rose and herb gardens and to install an 
irrigation system had to be put on hold until the excavation was complete. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Newland House's rooms have been restored to a semblance of their 
original state. The working kitchen, which once fed more than 50 field hands, 
holds a wood-burning stove and pantry. The dinnerware, tablecloth and chairs in 
the dining room are all original, as are the booties and other clothing on 
display in the birthing room near the rear entrance. The enclosed sun porch at 
the front of the house, with its reclining lounges, was originally built for a 
sickly Newland child. 
</P>
<P>
The wooden cabinets installed in the sun porch at one time held Indian baskets 
that Mrs. Newland collected (all but the one on display in the house are now at 
the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana). The tower room held William Newland's office; 
later Mrs. Newland turned it into a sewing room, as it is cast today. 
</P>
<P>
These days the uninterrupted ocean vistas no longer exist but are shared by 
housing developments. The lot, at the northwest corner of Beach Boulevard and 
Adams Avenue, is now the Newland Center, with the museum as its centerpiece. 
Shops, restaurants, banks and gas stations surround the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The future of the Newland House Museum and its environs are currently under 
discussion by the City's Historic Issues Committee and members of the private 
sector. One of the concepts being discussed is the creation of a historical 
village: The Newland House is already there, and the land is currently a 
temporary holding site for two other structures worthy of preservation, an old 
church and an unrelated pastoral residence that originally stood in the 
downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals being considered are currently in staff hands, said Jim Engle, 
director of community services. An analysis of three alternative concepts is 
being fashioned and will specify "where the funding will come from," he said. 
The analysis is to be presented to the City Council within the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got the land, we've got the time, just not the money," said Karen 
Topolewski, a museum aide. 
</P>
<P>
Money would not seem to be the problem in the rest of this rather affluent 
neighborhood. Median family income countywide is around $40,000; here it is 
close to $75,000 -- a cool 125% increase during the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
Another measure of the neighborhood's increased wealth is the growth in 
households with annual incomes in excess of $100,000. While fewer than 10% of 
households in the entire county have incomes in excess of $100,000, here the 
figure is 19%. Ten years ago fewer than 1% of those living here fit this 
category. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from wealth, the most conspicuous demographic difference in the 
neighborhood has been its racial composition. In this aspect of its makeup, 
Newland has mirrored the rest of the county, changing from 80% white in 1980 to 
about 70% today. 
</P>
<P>
Stability, though, is a neighborhood hallmark, at least insofar as size is 
concerned. During the '80s the neighborhood grew by just 6% while the entire 
county population jumped by almost 20%. 
</P>
<P>
William and Mary Newland, parents of three boys and seven girls (two of whom 
are still living, in Newport Beach), could expand their living quarters as 
needed on their sizable farm. This neighborhood hasn't let high density crowd 
its settlers' style.

PRIEST TAKES BITE OUT OF DENTAL CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERRY ANGEL, Sherry Angel is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His tooth-side manner is so gentle and encouraging that he makes children feel 
10 feet tall while reminding them to brush and floss. 
</P>
<P>
That's not something Dr. Richard J. Thill learned in dental school. 
</P>
<P>
He's a Roman Catholic priest with a devout interest in healthy teeth. And he 
says the communication skills he developed in the seminary have served him well 
in the dental office, where his biggest challenge is improving preventive care 
for children ranging from toddlers to teens. 
</P>
<P>
Thill, who pauses to say grace during an interview at a restaurant near his 
office, is as comfortable practicing dentistry in a short-sleeved yellow smock 
alongside a life-sized robot named Dr. Beap as he is standing behind a pulpit 
in priestly attire. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Beap (Bartholomew Edubot Automaton Peabody) -- whose midsection is a TV on 
which educational videos are played -- is part of an effort to make going to 
the dentist a positive experience for children. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Beap hangs out in a small waiting area next to the open bay where Thill 
works side by side with his colleagues, Warren Brandli and Michael McCartney, 
longtime friends who specialize in pediatric dentistry. They invited Thill to 
share their Tustin practice while he waits for a transfer of jurisdiction as a 
priest from Colorado to California. 
</P>
<P>
The openness of the room where they work enables children to hear the dentists 
banter with each other and their patients, keeping the atmosphere lighthearted 
even when distasteful fluoride treatments are being given or drills are 
humming. 
</P>
<P>
As the more boisterous McCartney makes jokes, Thill can be heard quietly 
conversing with his patients, mixing advice on how to care for their teeth with 
questions about how their lives are going. 
</P>
<P>
"How's school?" he asks an eighth-grade boy as he checks his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
"Kinda' boring." 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to be graduating soon, aren't you?" 
</P>
<P>
The boy nods. 
</P>
<P>
"Congratulations -- good work. Looks like you've been brushing. Keep it up. I 
have to keep telling myself that. I know it's work, but you can do it." 
</P>
<P>
McCartney says Thill has a special ability to be empathetic with his patients 
and to use the best approach for each child. McCartney is delighted to have a 
priest on his dental staff. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes a wonderful combination," he says. "With Dr. Rich, everything is done 
in a real caring and giving way." 
</P>
<P>
Thill, who attended Catholic schools and St. Boniface Catholic Church while 
growing up in Anaheim, became a dentist before entering the priesthood. He 
remained active in the church as he earned his degree in general dentistry at 
Marquette University, completed a two-year specialty program in pediatric 
dentistry at the University of Maryland and began private practice, first in 
Fullerton, then in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
While practicing in Denver, he became close friends with a longtime priest 
whose sermons "made me start to think about my faith -- about studying more and 
sharing it with others," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The priest helped him tune into an inner voice that he had been hearing since 
he was a boy. "He said the Lord calls and doesn't give up calling," Thill says. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Thill was ready. 
</P>
<P>
He entered St. Thomas Seminary in Denver in 1976 and was ordained in 1981. He 
served in the Pueblo Diocese in southern Colorado for about seven years. After 
spending four months in Mexico -- where he learned the language and customs by 
participating in baptisms, weddings and other special occasions -- he returned 
to Anaheim about a year and a half ago for an extended rest at the home of his 
parents, Elmer and Gene Thill. 
</P>
<P>
His leave from Pueblo was supposed to last a year, but he decided to relocate 
permanently so he could remain close to his family. While he is awaiting 
official word from his bishop in Pueblo giving him jurisdiction to serve here, 
his parishioners are young dental patients who are learning to rely on Thill's 
soothing voice to allay their fears. 
</P>
<P>
That is particularly important to the children he treats as a volunteer on 
Monday afternoons. They are residents of Orangewood Children's Home, the 
county's shelter for abused, neglected and abandoned children. 
</P>
<P>
"It's challenging because you're working with children who've been abused, so 
you want to make sure you go gentle and slow," he says. 
</P>
<P>
With any child who is fearful in a dentist's chair, Thill makes a special 
effort to be quick, efficient -- and reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
"They need to feel loved, to know someone's caring for them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Thill, who is lean and fit at 50, approaches his work with enormous energy, 
which he maintains by filling his spare time with activities that nurture mind, 
body and soul. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep very fit -- physically, mentally and emotionally. We need to balance 
our lives," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He takes time every day for prayer and tries "to recognize the presence of God 
all day long," which, he says, helps him cope with the fast pace of life in 
Orange County. On Sunday afternoons, he meditates and studies Scripture. 
</P>
<P>
He stays fit by swimming laps three times a week and taking frequent walks and 
bike rides. He also enjoys listening to music from classical to Big Band 
("anything with good rhythm and good taste") and reading about such topics as 
dentistry, astronomy, agriculture and entomology. He also unwinds by tinkering 
with machines, including the 1969 Volkswagen he drives to work. 
</P>
<P>
Thill says he will continue to practice dentistry even after he resumes his 
duties as a priest. He feels being a priest has made him a better dentist. 
</P>
<P>
"The training I have as a priest gives me insights into the difficulties and 
struggles of people," he says. "Dentistry is not just limited to teeth. It's 
looking at the whole person. Seeing people as God sees them. I look at the 
individual as a person -- not a situation." 
</P>
<P>
He hopes the optimism he draws from his spiritual life and exudes in the dental 
office will rub off on his patients so they will have confidence in their 
ability to protect their dental health. 
</P>
<P>
"My main goal is to approach each patient as special and unique and convey a 
positive and optimistic attitude toward preventive dentistry," he says.

ELECTION NIGHT WORE ON AND ON IN IRVINE

<P>
It was one of the longest election nights in this city's history, a 
white-knuckle, emotional roller coaster ride for mayoral candidates and 
longtime political rivals Sally Anne Sheridan and Larry Agran. 
</P>
<P>
At Agran's University Park home, once-jubilant supporters at his post-election 
party grew despondent as his early -- but narrow -- lead unexpectedly began 
slipping away. Conversely, the subdued mood waxed ecstatic at Sheridan's 
campaign headquarters, as supporters who had gone home to bed, expecting a 
loss, returned to cheer her on to victory. 
</P>
<P>
Tensions markedly increased around midnight, when Agran's 4% lead over Sheridan 
narrowed to less than 2%. Until final vote tallies came in at 3:22 a.m. 
Wednesday, both camps riveted their attention on the ballot counting, as 
precinct by precinct, the returns determined the candidates' fates. 
</P>
<P>
Barefoot and smiling, Sally Anne Sheridan sat on the floor of her campaign 
headquarters. It was shortly past midnight, and the latest count revealed that 
she was behind by 120 votes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care about being mayor. What do I need to be mayor for? I'm 55," 
Sheridan declared. "I want to do this because I don't want anyone who is 
elected mayor thinking he is so great," she said, referring to her opinion of 
Agran. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 minutes later, she took the lead. 
</P>
<P>
A group of onlookers, which by then had dwindled to only die-hard supporters, 
erupted into cheers. 
</P>
<P>
But the celebration was brief. By the next round of tallies, Sheridan was 
trailing by more than 300 votes. The crowd grew quiet again. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, the Republicans didn't get out to vote," Sheridan said dejectedly, as if 
she was ready to concede the race. 
</P>
<P>
A few miles away, in a downstairs den at Agran's house, campaign volunteer Jim 
Jenal sat huddled over a personal computer terminal, poring over 
precinct-by-precinct results and wondering if a comeback was in store. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 people crowded into the small room to watch his every move; others 
stood outside and peered through a window. Agran's parents, Selma and Reuben 
Agran of Studio City, sat motionless on a couch in the room, holding hands, 
their faces strained with worry. 
</P>
<P>
Agran, visibly tired from a day he began at 5 a.m. by passing out voter 
information, mingled among the guests, who numbered 100 at one point. He 
checked on Jenal's calculations as the numbers rolled in. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a close one," Jenal said sometime after 1 a.m. "But 18 of the 40 
precincts remaining are those where we worked hard campaigning. It's still 
do-able." 
</P>
<P>
The phone rang and a hushed silence filled the den, which grew stuffier and 
warmer as the race grew tighter. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the sound of this at all," Jenal said quietly into the receiver 
as supporters exchanged looks of despair. Agran was trailing Sheridan by 
several hundred votes. 
</P>
<P>
At 2 a.m. Sheridan's party was suddenly packed with returning well-wishers who 
discovered that she had taken the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Half an hour later the growing crowd celebrated the victory of 
Sheridan-supported Measure B -- a plan to widen a pair of Yale Avenue 
pedestrian overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
"Sweep! Sweep! Sweep!" they chanted, and followed with chants of "Sam! Sam! 
Sam!" -- a pet name derived from the initials of Sally Anne Miller, Miller 
being Sheridan's previous surname. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan's husband, Don, walked into the room dressed in an Uncle Sam suit, 
which he had worn while campaigning earlier that day. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we have democracy again in Irvine?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes!" the group responded enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't get your hopes up," warned Sally Anne Sheridan. "We've been up and down 
all night and we've got five precincts to go." 
</P>
<P>
By 3 a.m., Agran had privately conceded the election. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can pull the plug," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His supporters, many crying and in shock from the unexpected defeat, filed out 
one by one. Agran, keeping a cheerful demeanor, stood on the front walk and 
hugged each one of them, thanking them for their help. 
</P>
<P>
"Now go out and do some good things," he said brightly. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened? What happened?" one elderly woman sobbed, burying her head in 
Agran's shoulder as he consoled her. Others threatened to sell their homes and 
leave Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shock," said Selma Agran, dabbing at her own tears. "Unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Agran went into the house and picked up the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
The jangle of telephone cut through the din at Sheridan's campaign 
headquarters, just two minutes after she received the final returns and was 
beginning to relax. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan answered the phone and then suddenly sat upright. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," she said into the receiver, her voice tense. "Thank you. . . . Your call 
means a lot to me," she said before putting the phone down. 
</P>
<P>
"That was Agran," Sheridan told the curious group. "He just conceded." 
</P>
<P>
Over the joyful shouts, Sheridan relayed Agran's statement: "He wants to be of 
help to me and, in spite of the bitterness of the campaign, he wanted to wish 
me well."

BERGESON RODE WAVE OF WINNING WOMEN; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: IT'S THE FEMALE CANDIDATES' YEAR, AND WHILE THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR 
NOMINEE HIT FELLOW REPUBLICAN SEYMOUR HARD, HE COULDN'T MAKE HIMSELF HIT HER 
BACK.

<P>
Picking through the political rubble Wednesday, both sides in the bitter 
Republican lieutenant governor primary campaign agreed on at least one major 
reason that Orange County state Sen. Marian Bergeson trounced cross-county 
rival Sen. John Seymour: She is a woman. 
</P>
<P>
Both Orange County legislators said that in addition to Bergeson's solid record 
as a public official, her victory in the statewide primary reflects a rising 
tide of sentiment favoring women politicians, viewed as relatively free of 
corruption and attuned to the issues most on the electorate's mind. 
</P>
<P>
And when it came down to old-fashioned political tactics in the lieutenant 
governor's race, a downtrodden Seymour (R-Anaheim) said Wednesday that he just 
couldn't bring himself to verbally attack his female challenger. Bergeson 
(R-Newport Beach) frequently attacked him as an opportunistic politician who 
had flip-flopped on the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
"The honest-to-God's truth is, I just have a tough time picking on any woman," 
said Seymour. "That's the way my mom raised me. It's very difficult to come out 
swinging." 
</P>
<P>
Even when Seymour decided to counterpunch Bergeson, the tactic backfired and 
hurt his standing with voters, said Seymour's political consultant, Eileen 
Padberg of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"She would just beat him up, slash and cut, and be real nasty," said Padberg. 
"And when he responded, it worked against us. It's very tough running against a 
woman." 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson acknowledged that she benefited from the move toward favoring women 
office seekers. But her assessment of why she and other women did well in 
Tuesday's election was somewhat different. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have is a combination of very qualified women and issues that women 
can more directly relate to," she said. "With that combination, you are seeing, 
not necessarily a gender gap, but you are seeing an opportunity (for women) to 
provide leadership." 
</P>
<P>
The undercurrent of voter favor toward women candidates was most evident in 
former San Francisco Mayor Diane Feinstein' triumph over Atty. Gen. John Van de 
Kamp in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. A Los Angeles Times exit poll 
Tuesday found that 80% of those voting for Feinstein agreed with the statement: 
"It's time we had a woman governor." 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson said years of involvement in issues important to women -- education, 
the environment and ethics -- were enough to draw support from female voters on 
Tuesday despite her staunch opposition to legalized abortion. Her victory, she 
said, proved that, "Frankly, you can be a very strong pro-life candidate and 
still win on women's issues." 
</P>
<P>
Consultant Padberg doubted Wednesday whether Bergeson's anti-abortion position 
could weather a more high-profile and bruising campaign against popular 
Democratic incumbent Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, who is seeking his third term in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, however, Padberg said Bergeson was riding a wave that has 
made the 1990s the "decade for women." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a year for women candidates and there are a lot of reasons," said 
Padberg. "The voters in general are a little bit more distrusting because of 
the ethics problems. All the people who have been indicted and had serious 
ethical problems have been men." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the gender issue, Seymour and Padberg said Bergeson pulled out a 
victory Tuesday because anti-abortion forces conducted intensive telephone bank 
operations to inspire conservative voters in Orange, San Diego, Riverside and 
Imperial counties -- all areas covered by Bergeson's 37th Senate District. She 
took between 59% and 80% of the vote in those crucial Southern California 
counties, as well as Los Angeles, unofficial vote totals show. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Bergeson bested Seymour by 59% to 41%, a showing that 
Bergeson credited to her network of volunteers. Padberg blamed Seymour's poor 
showing on low voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the race, the main difference between the Orange County legislators 
was abortion. Seymour, once publicly opposed to abortion, switched his position 
last year after abortion rights activists won key California legislative 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson attacked Seymour for the switch, and the Rev. Lou Sheldon of the 
Traditional Values Coalition in Orange County said Wednesday the abortion 
debate was also a key factor in the Republican race. Even those who didn't 
agree with Bergeson's abortion stance were scared off by the perception that 
Seymour was a "wishy-washy" politician, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the California Abortion Rights Action League in Los Angeles 
said the Bergeson-Seymour race, although a statewide campaign, didn't command 
the group's full attention as did previous legislative contests where abortion 
was a key issue. 
</P>
<P>
CARAL endorsed Seymour, but didn't send in volunteers or donations to shore up 
his campaign because the group is already committed to helping Democrat 
McCarthy, who is an abortion rights advocate, said Peter Scranton.

<P>
TRANSIT: VOTER APPROVAL OF THE GASOLINE TAX HIKE ENSURES COMPLETION OF NUMEROUS 
HIGHWAY AND RAIL PROJECTS. IT IS BEING VIEWED BY SOME AS THE DAWNING OF A NEW 
AGE FOR HARRIED COMMUTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The passage of a statewide gasoline tax hike was viewed Wednesday as heralding 
a new dawn for transportation in Orange County that will see expanded rail 
service and more highway lanes built on the Santa Ana Freeway, possibly within 
the next two years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm elated," declared Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, chairman of the Orange 
County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"People think that we have to do something different and change the way people 
have been moving around the state," added James P. Reichert, general manager of 
the Orange County Transit District, the county's bus agency. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide approval of Proposition 111, along with two other transit measures -- 
Propositions 108 and 116 -- guarantees that at least $18.5 billion in new money 
will be available for highway and transit construction over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major turnaround," Caltrans Director Robert K. Best declared at a 
press conference in Sacramento. "This will require us to gear up and we will be 
gearing up quickly . . . so the people who have expressed their trust in 
government (by voting for the measures) will be seeing projects out on the 
road." 
</P>
<P>
Best said Caltrans will ask the California Transportation Commission to approve 
$257 million in backlogged projects when the commission meets in Sacramento 
next week. He said construction on some of these stalled projects could begin 
within three months. 
</P>
<P>
The Caltrans director also said that passage of the 9-cent-per-gallon tax hike 
assured timely completion of the Century Freeway and Harbor Transitway projects 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does passage of Proposition 111 mean more than $1 billion over 10 
years for projects such as the widening of the Santa Ana Freeway, it also may 
have signaled at least a temporary shift in local voter sentiment, county 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ballot measure failed to carry in Orange County, with 51.6% of 
local voters opposed and 48.4% in favor, county officials insist that a higher 
turnout would have yielded a local victory. 
</P>
<P>
The ballot results are undergoing close scrutiny because many county officials 
want to place a countywide, half-cent sales tax hike -- Measure M -- for 
transportation projects on the November ballot. Opinions are mixed, however, 
about whether it would pass on the heels of Proposition 111. Orange County 
voters defeated the half-cent tax proposal last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a winning streak -- one in a row!" said OCTC Executive Director Stanley 
T. Oftelie. "Proposition 111 lost by a hair's breadth here, and as bond 
measures have lost in Orange County, you could say this one lost only slightly. 
The outcome is favorable for placing Measure M on the ballot because this shows 
that Orange County voters want to invest in transportation." 
</P>
<P>
Riley agreed, but Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said he remains unconvinced. 
"People are going to say, 'Wait a minute, didn't we just do something for 
transportation?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Measure M would provide about $3.1 billion over a 20-year period for highway 
and transit improvements. The money would supplement Caltrans funding for some 
projects, such as the Santa Ana Freeway widening, and it would fund some 
traffic improvements for which state funding is not expected, such as widening 
the Riverside Freeway and remodeling the confluence of the San Diego and Santa 
Ana freeways in Irvine, now a commuter's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
OCTD's Reichert said Measure M should go forward if only because it will 
provide local matching funds to attract state and federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials said they were amazed that Proposition 108, the rail bond 
measure, carried in this conservative county by 51% to 49%. They attributed its 
success to the increasing popularity of trains and a concern about air 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Riley suggested that people are "making decisions to have their neighbors ride 
the trains." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 116, a separate commuter rail bond measure, narrowly lost in Orange 
County, 51.5% to 48.5%. The measure provides $125 million for an Irvine 
monorail that was strongly supported by Irvine Mayor Larry Agran. Agran was 
upset in Tuesday's balloting, as was his council majority. But the victor in 
the mayor's race, Sally Anne Sheridan, said she will support the monorail 
project despite her concerns about the high density development it may bring to 
the Irvine Business Center. 
</P>
<P>
OCTC's Oftelie said that if Irvine doesn't come up with the $125 million in 
matching funds needed for the proposed five-mile loop, it is possible that 
other Orange County cities that have banded together to form a monorail 
consortium will seek state legislation to obtain the funds. 
</P>
<P>
Oftelie said that between the rail bond measures adopted Tuesday, millions of 
dollars will be available for rail projects locally, including $27 million for 
the proposed Riverside-to-Orange County commuter rail line and the planned 
purchase of the Amtrak rail line between Los Angeles and Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 111 proceeds, meanwhile, are expected to help fund the completion 
of the Santa Ana-Costa Mesa Freeway interchange, the widening of the Santa Ana 
Freeway between the Costa Mesa and Garden Grove freeways, and the widening of 
the Costa Mesa Freeway north of the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
These projects will keep plans for a $200-million transitway on schedule. The 
transitway, a special ramp system reserved for buses and car pools, is part of 
the Santa Ana Freeway widening project. 
</P>
<P>
Generally the three ballot measures make the county eligible to receive: 
</P>
<P>
$348 million for projects that Caltrans had to stop because money ran out, such 
as the Santa Ana-Costa Mesa Freeway interchange reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
$370 million for previously approved projects that had not yet been allocated 
any money. 
</P>
<P>
$317 million for local road improvements, traffic systems management programs, 
and major, interregional highways. 
</P>
<P>
$149 million for Amtrak corridor improvements and Orange County's own commuter 
rail service. 
</P>
<P>
$244 million for a "demonstration" Irvine monorail project, Amtrak 
improvements, a Riverside-to-Orange County commuter rail service, and $10 
million for locomotives and rail cars.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;

<P>
DISTRICT TO BUILD 1 SCHOOL, REOPEN 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In response to growing enrollment, the Tustin Unified School District plans to 
reopen two schools next school year and is taking steps to build a new 
elementary school in Tustin Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
The schools to be refurbished -- C.E. Utt Middle School at 13601 Browning Ave. 
and Sycamore Elementary School at 12712 Elizabeth Way -- were closed in 1978 
because of declining enrollment. Four other schools were closed in 1982 as the 
enrollment continued to drop, reaching a low of 9,800 students in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
But 10,585 students now attend the district's 15 schools. 
</P>
<P>
Just where the boundaries will be for Utt and Sycamore, how many children will 
attend them and whether they will open in the fall or later in the year is 
still uncertain, said Hollis Griffin, assistant superintendent for logistics. 
</P>
<P>
The administration will be making a recommendation on those details in the next 
few months, he said. For now, the district is working to refurbish the schools. 
</P>
<P>
About a month ago, crews began putting in air conditioning, ramps for the 
handicapped and restrooms, new gas lines, intercom phones and a fire alarm 
system at Sycamore, said William Teter, director of maintenance and operations. 
</P>
<P>
The school board approved a $3.7-million contract for work at Utt at its 
meeting Monday night. Utt will receive the same improvements as Sycamore, plus 
work on the concrete and a relocation of offices. 
</P>
<P>
The school board Monday night also discussed designating the first Tustin Ranch 
school site, which is expected to open in the fall of 1992 or 1993. At the 
request of board member Jane Bauer, the decision was postponed until July when 
the administration will be able to provide more detailed information about the 
ages and numbers of children in Tustin Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"The staff is convinced that any new information won't change our 
recommendation," said Supt. Maurice Ross. 
</P>
<P>
The administration is recommending a location near Irvine Boulevard and 
Jamboree Road, Ross said. That site is one of five elementary school locations 
set aside under a 1988 agreement between the district and the Irvine Co. A 
middle school site and a high school site were also set aside, but most of the 
children moving to Tustin Ranch so far are preschool and elementary age, Ross 
said. 
</P>
<P>
About 250 students now come from Tustin Ranch, but district officials expect 
more than 4,000 students eventually from the development. SHANNON SANDS

A motorcyclist who was not wearing a helmet died Tuesday night after crashing 
into a pickup truck which was turning left, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Aguayo Ponce, 21, of Anaheim was speeding southbound on East Street

BINGO FUND-RAISERS FOR SCHOOLS ADVANCE

<TEXT>
<P>
High school parent and booster organizations in the Garden Grove Unified School 
District will be able to run fund-raising bingo games to support sports and 
other activities under a policy approved by the Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees voted 5 to 0 Tuesday night to approve a policy allowing one group 
at each of the seven district high schools to apply for city permits to conduct 
the games. The policy also outlines rules and regulations for the conduct of 
the games. 
</P>
<P>
If approved on a second reading June 19, the policy would take effect 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's board meeting, some trustees expressed concern that bingo might 
unfairly benefit schools in the more affluent areas of the district, which not 
only includes most of Garden Grove but portions of Anaheim, Cypress, Fountain 
Valley, Santa Ana and Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible," said Jim Griffis, the district's director of administrative 
services. "It may be more difficult for parent groups in some areas of the 
district to get the games set up and pay for the equipment that's required." 
</P>
<P>
A variety of electronic devices are typically used to pick and display bingo 
numbers, and the district's policy requires that smoking can be permitted only 
if the group installs air filters or smoke-extraction equipment, which can cost 
thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, experience has shown that the poorer areas play more bingo. 
If they can get set up, the schools in the less-affluent areas may actually do 
very well," Griffis said. 
</P>
<P>
The key, he suggested, is attracting regular bingo players. 
</P>
<P>
"The base of players are ongoing, touring bingo players. Just like some people 
may bowl or go to baseball games three or four nights a week, going to bingo 
games is their social life." 
</P>
<P>
The first calls for bingo in high schools came from parents complaining that 
sports and other programs were at a disadvantage competing with schools that 
raised thousands of dollars through bingo games. JIM TORTOLANO

PART-TIME WORKERS' HOURS TO BE PARED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some part-time municipal workers will soon see their hours cut because of a 
longstanding agreement between the city and the state retirement fund that 
limits the number of hours for such workers. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning July 1, employees classified as part time will not be allowed to 
exceed 19.5 hours per week, or 1,000 hours annually. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a policy of the city for several years, but only recently it 
came to our attention that part-timers had been working in excess of that," 
City Manager Allan L. Roeder said. 
</P>
<P>
Roeder has instructed city departments to scale back their part-time workers' 
hours so they don't exceed the limit before the end of the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The move will affect about 55 workers, mostly in recreation services and park 
and golf course maintenance, Personnel Director Steve Hayman said. The city 
employs an average of 212 part-time employees a year, Hayman said. 
</P>
<P>
A part-time worker at the Costa Mesa Golf Course said he will have to find 
another job to make up for the lost hours. Although part-time employees there 
are normally scheduled for three six-hour shifts a week, they also fill in when 
other workers are sick or on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been good," said the worker, who declined to give his name. "Most of the 
people here are either in junior college or senior citizens, so the extra hours 
help." 
</P>
<P>
When the new fiscal year begins July 1, the payroll system will automatically 
alert the part-time workers and their supervisors when the limit is 
approaching, Hayman said. 
</P>
<P>
The rule is the result of a contractual agreement with the state Public 
Employees Retirement System, which stipulates that both employer and employee 
must contribute to the employee's retirement fund after the employee has worked 
1,000 hours in a year, Roeder said. MARY ANNE PEREZ

<P>
Golden West College is offering free classes for immigrants who are seeking 
permanent U.S. residency under the recent federal amnesty legislation. Classes 
will be conducted from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. on eight consecutive Saturdays 
beginning this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The amnesty law requires applicants to show they are making progress toward 
learning English and learning about U.S. citizenship matters. The classes at 
Golden West College fulfill the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
requirements for progress in English and citizenship, said Donna Willoughby, 
associate dean of instruction. 
</P>
<P>
"These are adult classes, and there is no fee or tuition," Willoughby said. 
"Since classes are held on Saturdays, there is also no parking fee to park on 
campus." 
</P>
<P>
Willoughby said the classes are open to anyone who has applied for amnesty, 
including people who live outside Huntington Beach. She said there is no 
enrollment limit. 
</P>
<P>
Classes meet in the business building and in the library on the campus, 15744 
Golden West Ave. 
</P>
<P>
To apply for the classes, call Olga Benavides in the college registration 
office at (714) 895-8299. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; 
</P>
<P>
INCREASE SLATED FOR PUBLIC SAFETY ONLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Costa Mesa would spend far more on police and fire services in the coming year 
under the proposed 1990-91 budget. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed budget, presented to the City Council by City Manager Allan L. 
Roeder on Monday night, would add $1.1 million over the current budget for 
public safety -- the only area of city government slated for an increase -- and 
decrease transportation funding by $15.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Police and fire protection represents nearly half the total expenditures for 
the city in the proposed budget. 
</P>
<P>
Roeder asked the council to consider hiring two additional police officers to 
enhance the city's two-member driving-under-the-influence team, which averages 
1,200 arrests annually. In addition, he asked that two police aides be hired to 
help with crime scene investigations and report-taking. Roeder said the added 
personnel would free up officers for more police functions. 
</P>
<P>
He also proposed maintaining the Police Department's educational program, DARE 
America (Drug Abuse Resistance Education), in Costa Mesa schools. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the budget calls for $1.7 million to build the Sakioka Fire 
Station by January, 1992. That amount, however, does not include the costs for 
equipment or personnel, which will be funded after the station is built. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the $62.3-million budget is 13% lower than the 1989-90 budget. 
Although revenue from sales and property taxes is expected to increase $3.1 
million, total revenue is down largely because of a 36.7% decrease in interest 
earned on time deposits, which Roeder blamed on lower cash balances for the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
A major reason for the drop in transportation funding is that last year's 
budget included $4.2 million in capital improvement projects funded by Measure 
C. The measure, passed in 1987, allowed the city to override the Gann limit on 
government spending and use the funds for street improvements. Those funds will 
run out June 30. 
</P>
<P>
The retail sales tax and bed tax remain the city's major revenue source, 
representing 45.3% of the total revenues, or $29.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The council will review the budget at a study session at 1 p.m. Monday in the 
fifth-floor conference room at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The public will be able to comment on the budget before the council votes on 
it, at its regularly scheduled meeting June 18. MARY ANNE PEREZ

D.A.'S RUNOFF PUTS STRAIN ON RELATIONSHIPS IN OFFICE

When Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. Enright decided just hours before the 
filing deadline in March to run for district attorney, he knew he had no time 
to put together a campaign or raise any money. 
</P>
<P>
But because Enright won enough votes Tuesday to force Dist. Atty. Michael R. 
Capizzi into a November runoff, that's all changed. 
</P>
<P>
Enright took a vacation day Wednesday and met with a group of lawyers and 
businessmen who want to help him launch his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's looking very good," Enright said. "I really believe now that I 
can win this thing." 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi admitted that he is "seriously thinking" about asking Enright to step 
down as chief deputy. With five months to go in the campaign, Capizzi said, it 
may be a strain on office efficiency for things to continue the way they have 
been. 
</P>
<P>
Enright did not seem worried about the prospect of losing his position. What's 
important, he said, is that he can still carry the title of chief deputy on the 
November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Enright, scheduled to be on vacation the rest of the week, quipped: "I won't 
know until I walk into the office Monday morning whether I'm still going to 
have my job." 
</P>
<P>
For Capizzi, Wednesday was a day to regroup. And despite his disappointment in 
falling short of the 50% he needed to prevent a runoff, he was buoyed by the 
telephone calls he received. Supporters assured him that they would be there 
for him, and with their checkbooks. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a tough nut to crack trying to win it all Tuesday," Capizzi said. "But 
it seems to me the only thing Jim will gain is two votes he didn't have 
before." 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi's quip was a reference to Assistant Dist. Atty. Edgar A. Freeman and 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef, the other two prosecutors on the ballot, who 
Tuesday night pledged their support to Enright. 
</P>
<P>
The totals for the district attorney's race showed Capizzi with 41.2% of 
Tuesday's vote and Enright with 29.1%, a 40,000-vote difference. Avdeef ran 
third at 15% and Freeman was close behind him at 14.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi, 50, and Enright, 63, each sees the vote totals in his favor. Capizzi 
said it shows that he is a much stronger candidate than Enright. 
</P>
<P>
Enright responded: "I think the numbers show that there's 59% of the vote out 
there against him (Capizzi). And that's with him having all the money and 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
The "money" means Capizzi's sizable campaign chest, close to $200,000. By 
contrast, Enright had just $11,000 to spend. 
</P>
<P>
The "everything" includes Capizzi's sophisticated campaign organization. 
Political consultant Eileen Padberg, who has run many successful campaigns, 
including those for longtime Dist. Atty. Cecil Hicks, is on Capizzi's campaign 
team. Capizzi has also put together a sizable list of endorsements: U.S. Sen. 
Pete Wilson, all five members of the Board of Supervisors, the associations for 
deputy prosecutors and deputy sheriffs, along with several statewide and 
regional narcotics officers' associations. 
</P>
<P>
Enright's endorsements come primarily from old friendships. Kenneth Williams, 
the district attorney before Hicks took office, backed Enright. So did former 
County Administrative Officer Bob Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Enright has strong ties to many judges and to many members of the defense bar. 
And he's convinced that between now and November he can put together a 
respectable campaign staff. 
</P>
<P>
But one much discussed topic within the district attorney's office Wednesday 
was how well the two candidates will work together between now and the Nov. 6 
election. 
</P>
<P>
They are longtime competitors who held nearly co-equal titles during the Hicks 
years -- Enright was chief deputy and Capizzi was chief assistant. Now that 
Capizzi has been appointed to replace Hicks, who took a judgeship, he and 
Enright share a secretary and a suite of offices down the hall from the other 
deputies and assistants. 
</P>
<P>
Enright describes their relationship as "cordial but cool." 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi's supporters say it's to his credit that he has not interfered with 
Enright's role in the office, despite their strong adversarial positions. 
</P>
<P>
Another potential obstacle facing Enright is his courtroom work. For one thing, 
he is scheduled to prosecute a death penalty case involving three defendants in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyers in the case have all asked that he be removed, not wanting 
prospective jurors to know that the prosecutor before them is someone they may 
end up voting for later. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi said that it's not the defense lawyers who concern him. 
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned that it's extremely difficult to take on two major projects at 
once," he said. "If Jim is campaigning, can he really devote 200% to a trial, 
which is what a case like this takes?" 
</P>
<P>
No final decision has been made, and the case could end up postponed until 
after the election.

LOW TURNOUT WAS HER BIG FOE, WIEDER SAYS 
</P>

<P>
Harriett M. Wieder, the first county supervisor in a decade to be forced into a 
runoff, says she isn't terribly worried about the prospect of a November race 
and blames low voter turnout -- 38% countywide -- for her failure to capture an 
outright majority in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
"My enemy was apathy," said Wieder, who finished with 47.1% of the vote in a 
race against four challengers. "I got the handwriting on the wall when it was 
determined that turnout was below 40%. . . . If it had been anything over 45%, 
I think I would have won." 
</P>
<P>
Wieder's campaign manager, Allan Hoffenblum, agreed that the low voter turnout 
"skewed" the results. 
</P>
<P>
"When more people stay home than turn out to vote, it's hard to predict," 
Hoffenblum said. "There is nothing in our surveys to indicate that the majority 
will have any reason not to reelect Harriett." 
</P>
<P>
As it was, no candidate came close to challenging Wieder for the top spot. Her 
nearest competitor, Westminster City Councilwoman Joy L. Neugebauer, got 19.9%, 
less than half Wieder's share; John D. Harper and Sonia Sonju were outpolled 3 
to 1. A fifth candidate, Marie Alexis Antos, got just 3.5% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Collectively, though, the challengers beat Wieder by 6 percentage points, 
suggesting that after 12 years in office and a congressional campaign two years 
ago that left her shaken and bloodied, the first and only woman ever elected to 
the Board of Supervisors is indeed vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
"There were strong challengers, and each waged independent campaigns, so we 
split a lot of the vote," Neugebauer said. "But there is strong feeling that 
the representation of constituents in this district by the incumbent is not 
sufficient." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Englander, a political consultant who once ran Wieder's campaigns, 
thinks the November race could be close. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously there's some anti-incumbent feeling out there, so I don't think 
November's going to be a blowout," he said. "It's going to be very, very tough 
(for Neugebauer). But I tell my kids in Little League, on any given day, any 
team can beat any other team." 
</P>
<P>
Englander figures that Neugebauer must raise $250,000 to beat Wieder in 
November. He pointed out, however, that Wieder may have fund-raising troubles 
because she has already received the maximum allowable donations from many 
contributors under the county's campaign-financing reform law for the 
supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder spent more than $80,000 in the primary and still had close to $100,000 
left over, whereas Neugebauer raised just $12,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think she's really in trouble, she just has to go through the agony of 
a second election," Bruce Nestande, a former supervisor who resigned from 
office in 1987, said of Wieder. 
</P>
<P>
Nestande noted that three of Wieder's challengers have experience as city 
council members and, therefore, some built-in constituencies, and that winning 
a majority under those conditions would be tough for any incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's remarkable that she finished as well as she did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors who have been voted out of office have usually faced problems far 
worse than those troubling Wieder. 
</P>
<P>
The last time a county supervisor faced a runoff was in 1980. Philip Anthony, 
facing an indictment, finished first among four candidates in June but lost his 
seat in November to Roger R. Stanton, who has held the seat ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder herself ousted an incumbent when she won her current seat in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
But she does not see any parallel between that election and this one. 
</P>
<P>
"The issues were different," she said. "Larry Schmit (the incumbent), at the 
time, the press had questioned his activities in office, which made him 
vulnerable. I was actually encouraged to run." 
</P>
<P>
Wieder attracted a crowd of challengers this year after her unsuccessful 1988 
congressional campaign. In that contest, she admitted having lied for years 
about having a college degree. In addition, she has at times been treated as an 
unimportant outsider by the four male supervisors and that she has a reputation 
for moving in more directions at once than her own staff and county bureaucrats 
can keep track of. 
</P>
<P>
One of Wieder's opponents, Sonia Sonju, circulated two mailers during the 
campaign attacking Wieder on the college-degree issue. Wieder said she thought 
that might have cost her some support, but "not very much." 
</P>
<P>
Neugebauer, however, said the issue "hurt her in this campaign, and it will 
hurt her in November. It will stay with her." 
</P>
<P>
Wieder said she is leaving for a three-day vacation in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, 
and that she will begin planning her strategy for November when she returns. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a different race one-on-one," Wieder said. "We didn't have 
any candidates' forums. I didn't have the opportunity to speak out about what 
I'd do and what I've done." 
</P>
<P>
Wieder also said she hopes to debate Neugebauer at forums in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"The big thing is, I have to get my message out," she said. "I look forward to 
it."

SUPT. PETERSON REMAINS UPBEAT DESPITE THREAT TO HIS REIGN 
</P>

<P>
When a relatively obscure college professor began testing the waters last 
December for a possible run at the county superintendent of schools, incumbent 
Robert Peterson brushed him off as just another in a long line of unsuccessful 
challengers. 
</P>
<P>
"He would be swimming upstream," Peterson said after the professor, John F. 
Dean, announced that he was considering becoming a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
But six months later, it's Dean who finds himself in the comfortable position 
of riding with the current, while Peterson may be faced with beginning an 
unwilling retirement after 24 years in office. 
</P>
<P>
In the final tally from Tuesday's election for the nonpartisan, $98,663-a-year 
post, Dean, a 63-year-old professor currently on sabbatical from Whittier 
College while serving as executive director of the nonprofit California Reading 
Assn. Inc., won 43.5% of the vote, topping Peterson by 1,035 ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson's other challenger, Ron Detrick, an educator and administrator at 
National University in Irvine, finished with 12.8% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Dean and Peterson, who finished with 43.2% of the vote, will square off again 
in a November runoff. And while that contest is five months away, the campaign 
rhetoric was in full swing just hours after the final results were tabulated 
early Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the public has spoken here," said Dean, a Newport Beach resident. 
"Almost 60% of the public said they don't want (Peterson) any more. They're 
saying it's time for him to hang it up." 
</P>
<P>
But Peterson, 69, who has been in office since 1966, contended that Dean's win 
in the primary was achieved through misuse of campaign-contribution laws. Last 
week, Peterson called a press conference to point out that Dean's father 
provided a $20,000 campaign loan, $19,000 over the legal limit as spelled out 
in Proposition 73. 
</P>
<P>
"That (primary victory) was achieved through the use of a $19,000 illegal loan, 
and if (Dean) did not misuse the law, I doubt that he would have gotten as many 
votes as he did," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Dean countered that the loan was accepted because of "an honest mistake" by his 
campaign staff and that the money has been returned. He and his staff are 
cooperating with an investigation by the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson also said that his campaign was damaged last week when the California 
Teachers Assn., which endorsed Dean, called a press conference to announce a 
$1-million claim against Peterson and the County Board of Education by a 
teacher who charged that her classroom in a county-run school for troubled 
youths was electronically bugged. Peterson called the timing of the 
announcement "politically motivated." 
</P>
<P>
While Dean's candidacy clearly is the toughest political challenge that 
Peterson has faced in his 24 years as superintendent, he is no stranger to 
heated battles. The Orange County Grand Jury has frequently criticized Peterson 
as practicing "a policy of educational isolationism," and other critics -- 
including Dean -- have called for switching the county superintendent's post to 
an appointive office or doing away with it entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Peterson has managed to weather the attacks and, until now, has faced 
only token opposition from candidates in recent years. He was regarded as so 
strong, in fact, that no one dared challenge him four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Wednesday, Peterson said he expects that Dean's strong showing 
in the election will rally "enthusiastic supporters" who didn't work hard for 
him in the primary because they assumed Peterson would be "an automatic 
winner." 
</P>
<P>
Although he continued to attack Dean for "distortions of fact" and pledged to 
outspend him in the runoff, Peterson maintained that he is not concerned about 
the outcome of the November election. He noted that he will turn 70 in October, 
making him eligible for Social Security and pensions from the Air Force and his 
40-plus years as a teacher and county superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in a win-win situation no matter what," Peterson said. "I have no chagrin 
-- whichever way the good Lord works it out, I'm going to be happy and 
pleased." 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION DEPARTMENT SERVICES 
</P>
<P>
County Supt. of Schools Robert Peterson is the chief executive of the county 
Department of Education and approves use of the department's $65-million annual 
budget. The department has no control over local district policies, but among 
the services it provides are: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Schools and transportation for handicapped children. 
</P>
<P>
Vocational training. 
</P>
<P>
"Court" schools for juveniles in custody.

<TEXT>
<P>
It came as no surprise to the movers and shakers here that political newcomer 
Karen Lloreda, a Capistrano Beach homemaker, swept incumbent Ingrid McGuire on 
Tuesday from the charter City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Lloreda was, after all, groomed for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Since she announced that she would run in the first City Council election since 
Dana Point was incorporated Jan. 1, 1989, Lloreda was coached and encouraged by 
other Capistrano Beach community leaders as well as by Mayor Eileen Krause and 
Councilman Mike Eggers. 
</P>
<P>
The two incumbents, facing their first challenge since they took office, 
counted on Lloreda's clout in her neighborhood as a way to unseat McGuire, whom 
Krause described as a "weak link" on the council. 
</P>
<P>
"She (Lloreda) listened to suggestions, and she followed through -- then she 
studied," Eggers, a political consultant and chief Orange County aide to U.S. 
Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"That was critical," Eggers said, still denying that he, Krause and Lloreda 
actively ran on a slate, although the three garnered a slew of local 
endorsements and ended far ahead of the other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Krause, a popular longtime community activist, led the field of seven 
candidates, 20.1% of the vote, according to unofficial tallies by the Orange 
County registrar of voters office. 
</P>
<P>
Eggers followed close behind, receiving 19.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Lloreda was a close third, garnering 18.7%. Planning Commissioner Harold 
Kaufman came in fourth, with 13.1%, while McGuire fell slightly behind him, 
with 13%. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing were local optometrist William L. Petersen, who received 9.6% of the 
vote, and teacher Thomas B. Moy, who received 5.8%. 
</P>
<P>
Krause and Eggers said the results showed that voters were largely satisfied 
with the first City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows that the voters of Dana Point believe that the honeymoon is still 
on," Eggers said. "They just wanted to change one of the bridesmaids." 
</P>
<P>
McGuire was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Lloreda said that she was not surprised by her victory, since she expected a 
high voter turnout from Capistrano Beach, her strongest area of support. She 
also reportedly did well in Monarch Bay, where Krause lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the odds were in my favor," she said. "But I didn't dream that the 
gap between third and fourth (place) would be so great." 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday morning Lloreda was in touch with City Manager William Talley to 
schedule study sessions over city policies and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
She will take the oath of office June 26 at 6 p.m. in the City Council 
Chambers, City Clerk Mary Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
Once sworn in, Lloreda will be the only elected or appointed Capistrano Beach 
representative in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Lloreda said she will forge ahead in fulfilling her campaign promise to sponsor 
economic revitalization in the aging Capistrano Beach business district. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on a Sheriff's Department report that showed the business district 
leading other sections of the 6.2-square-mile city in drug sales and other 
crime, Capistrano Beach residents and business owners sponsored Lloreda as a 
representative who will look after their interests. 
</P>
<P>
Lloreda said she will ensure that any future redevelopment project planned for 
boosting Capistrano Beach's economic base will also take into account longtime 
business owners. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she'll be a great team player," Krause said. "I already know she's a 
hard worker."

TITAN RIGHT-HANDER WATSON SIGNS WITH BLUE JAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Matt Watson, a junior pitcher from Cal State Fullerton, signed a minor-league 
contract with the Toronto Blue Jays, he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old right-hander, drafted in the 14th round, will report Sunday to 
the Blue Jays' New York Penn League Class A team in St. Catharines, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Watson made four starts and 11 relief appearances for the Titans this year. He 
had 28 strikeouts and 27 walks in 33 innings and was 1-5 with a 4.91 earned-run 
average. 
</P>
<P>
"College is so geared to winning," Watson said. "We have guys on our staff who 
are more consistent than me. I'm more of a power pitcher but I'm inconsistent. 
I should be able to develop more in the pros." 
</P>
<P>
Other Cal State Fullerton players drafted included pitcher Huck Flener, 
outfielder Domingo Mota and shortstop Kevin Farlow. 
</P>
<P>
Flener, a junior left-hander with an 8-1 record, was taken in the ninth round 
by Toronto. He is meeting with Blue Jay officials today and is expected to sign 
as soon as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Mota was picked in the 29th round by the Dodgers; his father, Manny, has worked 
for the Dodgers for the past 21 years. Domingo hit .266 and led the Titans with 
19 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
Farlow, who was taken in the 15th round by San Diego, hit .284 with six home 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Sewell of UC Irvine, a junior right-hander with a 3-3 record and three 
saves, was taken by the New York Mets in the 30th round. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton College outfielder Tom Wilson, who hit .307 with 11 home runs and 36 
RBIs, was taken in the 23rd round by the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West College outfielder Shelby Hart (.252) was taken by Baltimore in the 
12th round and pitcher Jason Hutchins (6-3, 4.41 ERA), also of Golden West, was 
picked in the 30th round by the Giants.

<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Glassman, who coached 11 years at Willard Intermediate School in Santa Ana, 
has been named to replace Bill Ross as baseball coach at Santa Ana High School. 
</P>
<P>
Glassman, 43, was Ross' assistant this season while continuing as athletic 
director at Willard. 
</P>
<P>
He also was an assistant for two years under Herschel Musick at Santa Ana 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, the dean of the county's baseball coaches, resigned following the 1990 
season. He had a 477-235 record in 32 seasons and led Santa Ana to the 1982 
Southern Section 3-A division title. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a unique situation to replace a man who was a legend in his own time," 
Glassman said. "I learned a lot from Bill this year as his assistant, and it 
will be a challenge replacing him. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be an exciting challenge to move into the Sunset League next season, 
and I'm looking forward to playing in the best baseball league in the county." 
</P>
<P>
Glassman developed some top players who went to Santa Ana, including Julio 
Vargas, Robbie Johnson, Bob Reimers, Hector Olivares and John Schilling. 
</P>
<P>
Olivares will be Glassman's assistant and Schilling will remain as the school's 
pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
Glassman will remain as athletic director at Willard. Ross will stay at Santa 
Ana as athletic director.

SOFTWARE TOUTED AS A KEY TO UNLOCKING CREATIVITY; 
</P>
<P>
COMPUTERS: THE IDEAFISHER PACKAGE AIMS TO AID INNOVATION THROUGH WORD 
ASSOCIATIONS AND QUESTIONS.

<P>
When Marshall Fisher gives a sales pitch for his computer software package, he 
holds out the promise of capturing the elusive spark of creativity. 
</P>
<P>
He asks how much a potential customer would pay for a key to the subconscious 
mind, a tool that unlocks an avalanche of ideas and gently shapes conceptual 
clay into brilliant new forms. 
</P>
<P>
How about $495, personal computer not included? asks Fisher, a creativity guru 
and president of Fisher Idea Systems Inc. in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher, who spent $4 million and 12 years developing a creativity software 
program called IdeaFisher, proclaims that the program is a "must-have" 
brainstorming tool for everyone in search of a creative spark, from tiny 
advertising agencies to Fortune 500 companies. 
</P>
<P>
"We're using the computer to expand the thinking process instead of just 
crunching numbers," said Fisher, who amassed a personal fortune as co-founder 
of Century 21 Real Estate, the world's largest residential real estate 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher's small office in Irvine is plastered with reviews published since 
IdeaFisher was introduced a year ago. With 300 books on creativity and the 
thinking process lining his shelves, Fisher is girded to fend off the criticism 
that he is trying to bottle something magical. 
</P>
<P>
Although Fisher concedes that IdeaFisher is no substitute for independent 
thinking, he says it enables people to dip ideas into a pool of word 
associations or refine those ideas through a series of questions. The program 
recognizes that thinking is a process. And it is designed to help a person 
generate ideas for solving problems in much the same way that strolling through 
a supermarket reminds you of all the options you have for cooking dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The software, which is designed for use on IBM, Apple and compatible personal 
computers, consists of two main features: the QBank and the IdeaBank. 
</P>
<P>
QBank contains more than 3,000 questions that help put a problem in focus. The 
user types in an idea and the program asks a series of questions that define 
the idea more precisely and explore various avenues of thought. The program 
also asks questions comparing the quality of the idea to other proposals, using 
the results to determine a starting point for a search through the IdeaBank. 
</P>
<P>
IdeaBank is a database of 61,000 concepts structured into 28 major subjects and 
387 subtopics -- all connected by 675,000 associations. Instead of using an 
alphabetical index, the database stores information much like the brain does 
through associations. For instance, a word like "car" would be linked with 
"traffic." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of developing a creativity tool first struck Fisher in 1964, when he 
toyed with the idea of publishing a kind of "smart thesaurus," or a book of 
words and associated terms and concepts designed to help writers. Although he 
never completed the book, he revisited the idea in 1977 after selling his 
Century 21 holdings. He began work on a computerized version of his smart 
thesaurus. 
</P>
<P>
Linking the hundreds of thousands of associations contained in the IdeaBank and 
organizing them so that they might be retrieved by a computer proved to be such 
a highly complex task that it took 12 years to complete, Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which has 10 full-time employees, at one time employed 250 people 
to type information into the computer. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Cunningham, a principal at the Roberts Mealer Cunningham advertising 
agency in Costa Mesa, said he uses the program to help companies select new 
names. For one client, IdeaFisher was able to generate more than 5,000 proposed 
names. 
</P>
<P>
"There's concern about software replacing people in ad agencies," he said. "But 
I think it is like getting 100 bright people in the same room and putting their 
minds together. It puts pressure on other creative people to use it too." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Russo, a patent attorney in San Francisco, said he uses IdeaFisher to 
search for analogies when writing legal briefs and as a checklist generator 
when taking depositions from witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"I use it to help form an idea like a conversation with a colleague would," he 
said. "It paid for itself the first time I used it. It's like having a yellow 
pad of paper that talks back to you." 
</P>
<P>
Russo said the software should be used to solve general problems instead of 
specific ones, and the user must be willing to spend a few hours familiarizing 
himself with the search techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Jess Fisher, Marshall's son and the company's director of product development, 
cautions that the product isn't a panacea, and he doesn't guarantee that 
IdeaFisher will work for everyone. An independent study by the University of 
Hawaii found that people who claimed to be drained of creativity reported a 
substantial increase in the number of ideas they were able to generate by using 
IdeaFisher. 
</P>
<P>
The software has received laudatory reviews in a number of publications, 
including PC magazine, which named it one of the best new products of 1989. The 
company says its customers include Walt Disney Co., International Business 
Machines Corp., Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, Chase Manhattan Bank, General Mills, 
Lotus Development Corp., Northwestern University, the Marine Corps and more 
than 30 advertising agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher says the people who might benefit from IdeaFisher include strategic 
planners, researchers, personnel managers, marketers, advertising executives, 
screen writers, novelists and product developers. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher hopes that the education market will be a proving ground for IdeaFisher. 
The product is being used by teachers in the 5,000-student school district in 
Moses Lake, Wash., to teach students about the thinking process. The University 
of Missouri's journalism school is using the program to teach students how to 
write better. 
</P>
<P>
"We can expect to see classes on Thinking 101, down to every grade level where 
you learn the process of putting ideas together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher declines to disclose sales figures, though he said he has not yet 
recovered his initial $4-million investment in the year the product has been 
out. There is little direct competition for the product, he said, adding that 
other products on the market focus on a single task such as generating names 
for products. 
</P>
<P>
The company isn't content with the attention it generated with IdeaFisher. In 
September it will ship an updated version of the package. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it is negotiating with at least two larger companies to 
distribute IdeaFisher overseas. It is also developing custom versions for 
lawyers and other professionals and creating a laser-storage version of 
IdeaFisher that will use images rather than words. 
</P>
<P>
"We're saying that we have to start thinking to be competitive and use every 
tool at our disposal to be inventive," Fisher said. "Otherwise we will be a 
third-rate country. Creativity makes the world go round. The rest is 
housekeeping." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW IDEAFISHER SOFTWARE WORKS 
</P>
<P>
Naming a new brand of dog biscuit: 
</P>
<P>
Start in the IdeaBank, the program's database of associations. 
</P>
<P>
Type in the words dog treat. 
</P>
<P>
The program spits out a list of topic categories: 
</P>
<P>
ability/skill/talent/training/practice/lessons 
</P>
<P>
dogs/cats/family pets 
</P>
<P>
foods/food groups 
</P>
<P>
like/want/prefer 
</P>
<P>
Select dogs/cats/family pets 
</P>
<P>
The program produces a list of associations that help the user brainstorm and 
serve as a catalyst in the creation of a name: 
</P>
<P>
best friend -- myth + -- Dalmatian in a fire truck 
</P>
<P>
fire hydrant -- mutt -- gingham dog and calico cat 
</P>
<P>
puppy love -- show dog -- shaggy-dog story 
</P>
<P>
dog bone -- bone -- can't teach an old dog new tricks 
</P>
<P>
dog costume -- top dog -- Old Mother Hubbard 
</P>
<P>
doggie bag -- figurine -- leader of the pack 
</P>
<P>
show-ring -- trophy -- best of breed 
</P>
<P>
circus dog -- pedigree -- pick of the litter 
</P>
<P>
shake hands -- scent -- Run, Spot, Run 
</P>
<P>
The user jots down possible name ideas in the program's Idea Notepad. 
</P>
<P>
gingham dog and calico cat: Gingham Dog 
</P>
<P>
dog bone: Bone Appetit 
</P>
<P>
puppy love: Puppy Loves 
</P>
<P>
can't teach an old dog new tricks: New Tricks 
</P>
<P>
The list of ideas can then be tested and refined in the QBank, which generates 
questions such as "How would you expand the concept?"

Entrepreneur Magazine, the fast-growing publication for start-up businesses, is 
in joint venture discussions with a Swiss publisher and several other overseas 
media companies, Chairman Peter Shea said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The discussions are aimed at assuring the long-term financing necessary for the 
company's continued growth, Shea said, and a deal could be announced within the 
next couple of months. 
</P>
<P>
He said the talks are aimed at forming a 50-50 joint venture or some other type 
of partnership arrangement. Shea confirmed that he has been talking with Omni 
Group, a New York-based publishing arm of the diversified Swiss conglomerate 
Omni Holdings, as well as other firms in Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Shea acknowledged that cash flow is "tight" but denied that the company is 
facing serious financial problems. He said the magazine's revenue for the 
fiscal year that ends June 30 will reach $26 million with operating income of 
$3 million, the highest in the company's history. 
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneur earlier this year launched Entrepreneurial Woman magazine, and 
Shea said the new publication is being evaluated on an "issue by issue" basis. 
The fourth issue has already been printed, he said, and advertising is being 
sold for the fifth issue. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Delaney, publisher of the Delaney Report, a New York-based media 
newsletter, said the fact that Entrepreneur is seeking partners suggests that 
there are some financial strains. "You don't talk to people about partnerships 
unless you have to," he said. "Why take somebody on unless your cash-flow isn't 
that strong?" 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the magazine business is experiencing difficult times and that 
many publishers are in search of partners. But Shea said the severe national 
advertising slump has not affected Entrepreneur, which draws most of its 
advertising from franchisers and "business opportunity" vendors. 
</P>
<P>
He said that ad lineage was up over the last quarter and that the trends at the 
magazine are running converse to what the industry is doing. Delaney said, 
however, that ad lineage is not always a good measure of performance because it 
does not reflect the cost of selling the ads. 
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneur, founded 13 years ago, has survived some previous rough spots. It 
was in bankruptcy when Shea and several partners purchased it in 1986. But this 
year, the magazine is the fastest-growing in the country, Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest annual report by the Audit Bureau of Circulation put the circulation 
of Entrepreneur -- a glossy monthly -- at 307,826.

Children who have wished they could step into their TV screens over the years 
to join their heroes on Sesame Street may have their chance. 
</P>
<P>
The famous cast of characters, including Cookie Monster, Big Bird and Oscar the 
Grouch, is about to appear in a retail store at South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The Sesame Street General Store is scheduled to open Sept. 1 near the carousel, 
across from FAO Schwarz and the Disney Store. Carrying a mix of children's 
wear, toys, books and other Sesame Street goods, the outlet is the first among 
several due to open in Southern California this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very excited because this will be our flagship store," said Jill 
Gercovich, director of stores for Sesame Street Retail Stores in Hayward. 
Others are planned to open this year in malls in Glendale, Palo Alto and San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters will recognize their favorite Sesame Street sets. The 
3,500-square-foot retail outlet will include Mr. Hooper's General Store and the 
apartment at 123 Sesame Street where characters Bert and Ernie live. Young 
browsers can draw on the "art wall," see Big Bird's Learning and Listening 
Library, play in the "garage/clubhouse" or perform on the stage of the Sesame 
Street theater. 
</P>
<P>
About 40% of the merchandise mix will be devoted to the store's exclusive line 
of Sesame Street licensed children's clothing. Gercovich said that while J.C. 
Penney has marketed Sesame Street clothes for years, the new store will have 
its own exclusive line with bold graphics, European-type cuts and "fashion 
flare." 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the store will be devoted to items like books, lamps, sheets 
and towels. All will be related to the 21-year-old television show through 
licensing with Children's Television Workshop in New York, which produces the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Plaza General Manager Jim Henwood said the store is "an exciting 
concept."

WHITE HOUSE'S PLEA TO COOL OFF ON NEA IS SPURNED;

Despite the White House's call Wednesday for a yearlong "cooling off" period in 
the battle over obscenity and the National Endowment for the Arts, Rep. Dana 
Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) defiantly asserted that he will not suspend his fight to 
impose decency standards on the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the House floor Wednesday, Rohrabacher, who represents northwestern 
Orange County, told his colleagues, "I can assure all of those concerned . . . 
(that) there will be a vote on standards, as to whether or not federal dollars 
should be channeled to obscene or indecent art." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, who in the last year has helped lead the attack on the beleaguered 
agency, added, "The American people will be watching that vote." 
</P>
<P>
Congress had been expected in the weeks ahead to consider legislation that 
would prolong the life of the NEA for another five years. However, the White 
House this week indicated that it would seek only a one-year extension. 
</P>
<P>
The move was intended to avoid a full-scale battle this year between those who 
wish to impose decency standards on artwork that is funded by the agency and 
those who believe such efforts represent a heavy-handed attempt at government 
censorship of art. 
</P>
<P>
A one-year extension would continue the work of the agency, which annually 
spends more than $170 million, and give partisans on both sides a chance to 
work out their differences, White House officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, however, signaled Wednesday that he would have no part of any 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a vote on this issue (of decency standards) whether it is a 
one-year authorization or a five-year authorization," the first-term 
congressman said during his brief address to the House. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview later, Rohrabacher said he didn't think his stand would cause 
any problems with the White House. "I think that President Bush is trying to be 
as loyal as he can to his own appointee (NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer), even 
though his appointee is basically blowing it." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy over the NEA began last June, when it was disclosed that the 
25-year-old agency had helped support separate exhibitions that included 
homoerotic photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe and a photograph by 
Andres Serrano depicting a crucifix immersed in a jar of urine. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) last summer persuaded the Senate to pass 
an amendment to an NEA appropriations bill that would have barred the agency 
from supporting obscene or indecent artwork, or artwork that casts slurs on any 
race, religion or ethnic group. Rohrabacher unsuccessfully led the fight for 
the so-called "Helms amendment" in the House. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Congress approved language that banned NEA support only for "obscene" 
artwork, but the language did not specify who determines whether art is 
obscene. In addition, Congress created a commission to study the process 
through which the NEA makes grants. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher earlier this year said he would move to attach language 
establishing content standards for NEA-supported artwork to the NEA 
authorization bill to be considered this spring. In addition, he said he would 
later act to eliminate all funding for the NEA when a separate appropriations 
bill is considered later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday: "Our position 
has been that we're willing to accept this one-year (reauthorization), while 
they look at this. . . . If members come up with amendments, why, that's their 
business. . . . Our general position going in is simply a one-year extension." 
</P>
<P>
A conservative Republican whose background is firmly rooted in libertarian 
philosophy, Rohrabacher has said that government has no legitimate interest in 
financing private artwork. At the same time, he has said the government should 
not intrude into what an artist does "on his time, with his own dime." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher argues that the issue is not censorship, but taxpayer sponsorship 
of artwork that would offend most of the taxpayers who are helping to pay for 
it. Setting standards for taxpayer-supported art is an appropriate fallback 
position if the government is going to pay to support artists, he has said. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Times Orange County Poll found that 57% of a random sample of 600 
registered voters in Orange County disapprove of the government setting 
standards based on obscenity or controversy for government-supported artwork. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher on Wednesday said he simply does not believe that the poll is 
accurate. 
</P>
<P>
"Suggesting that the people of Orange County don't care if their money is 
flowing to indecent or sacrilegious art has got to be the most inaccurate 
presentation of their views I've ever heard. Why do they elect people like me?" 
Rohrabacher said. 
</P>
<P>
The Times Orange County poll, conducted by Mark Baldassare &amp; aAssociates of 
Irvine, did not ask voters whether they generally favor or disapprove of the 
concept of government support for the arts, regardless of whether the 
government imposes standards on the art's content. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Rohrabacher told his colleagues in the House, "The American people 
don't want their tax dollars going to pornographic or sacrilegious art in any 
form. 
</P>
<P>
"Because their position is out of sync with the morals and values of the 
American people, the opponents of standards have been going through enough 
acrobatics to qualify for a job with Ringling Bros."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUIT CHARGES CINEPLEX BACKED OUT OF 25 
FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cineplex Odeon Corp. and its Los Angeles-based subsidiaries have been sued by a 
director and two entertainment executives who allege Cineplex backed out of a 
deal to produce 25 films. The suit was brought by two executives of New Vision 
Entertainment Corp., co-chairman Samuel Schulman and chief executive Irvine 
Levin, and director Angelo Drossos. 
</P>
<P>
Cineplex's alleged actions caused Carolco, a movie producer and distributor, to 
back out of negotiations with the plaintiffs to produce the movies -- an 
agreement that would have brought the plaintiffs about $11 million, according 
to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
It seeks unstated damages plus punitive damage. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Cineplex, a theater operator and entertainment company based 
in Toronto, said that she had "no information" about the suit, which was filed 
Monday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.

DROPOUT RATES GO DOWN IN 14 SCHOOL DISTRICTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Pasadena and Duarte led San Gabriel Valley school districts in lowering 
their high-school dropout rates during 1986-89, and 12 other districts also 
posted improvements, according to a State Board of Education report released 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
But the dropout rate climbed in six other San Gabriel Valley school districts, 
including Hacienda La Puente Unified and Alhambra City High School. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, San Gabriel Valley schools are doing better than the state average, 
which indicates that one in five high school students fails to graduate. 
</P>
<P>
Although methods of reporting vary from district to district, the state 
measures the dropout rate by seeing how many youngsters who entered the 10th 
grade left without a diploma or its equivalent at the end of the 12th grade. 
Schools must account for departing students within 45 days or the youth is 
counted as a dropout. 
</P>
<P>
In two of the valley's bigger districts, Pomona Unified lowered its dropout 
rate by 28% between 1986 and 1989 while Pasadena Unified saw its dropout rate 
rise 5.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Many districts with plummeting dropout rates gave credit to an innovative state 
program that gave 200 California districts in high-risk areas money to hire 
dropout prevention counselors and start intensive programs to keep youths in 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been the biggest help. It's allowed us to do things that we wouldn't have 
normally been able to do," said Marcia McVey, deputy superintendent of Duarte 
Unified, which lowered its dropout rate from 59.7% to 7.4% in three years. 
</P>
<P>
McVey said her district received $200,000, which allowed Duarte to establish an 
alternate school within Duarte High School for high-risk students. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, "We're definitely going out and finding students who have already 
dropped out and bringing them back," McVey said. 
</P>
<P>
At Azusa Unified, which lowered its dropout rate by 40.6% in the past three 
years, administrators credit an outreach program that includes counseling, 
alternatives to traditional education and tenacious case management of problem 
students. 
</P>
<P>
A student services consultant visits youths at homes, talks to their families 
and links up students with special services such as child care. 
</P>
<P>
"The program we've had for three years is now starting to take effect," said 
Pat Colbert, Azusa's child welfare and attendance consultant. 
</P>
<P>
The El Monte High School District, which lowered its dropout rate by 9.2% in 
the last three years, also cites the state program, saying it allowed the 
school to hire a dropout prevention counselor to zero in on students who 
contemplate quitting school. 
</P>
<P>
"We tell the students that school isn't just a law to comply with, it's a 
ticket to a better life. If you can get a kid to see that, you can turn him 
around," said Steve Garcia, the coordinator for dropout prevention at El Monte 
Union High School. 
</P>
<P>
One district in the San Gabriel Valley showing a high rate was the Alhambra 
City High School District, where the dropout rate jumped from 14.6% to 20.3% in 
the past three years, an increase of 39%. 
</P>
<P>
But Alhambra officials say the figure is misleading because the district 
recently started classifying students by the number of credits they have earned 
instead of by grade standing in school. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, "We have classified many of our seniors back to juniors and that's 
why it looks as if they're dropped out of school," said Dianne Saurenman, 
assistant superintendent of pupil services for the Alhambra City High School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Saurenman said the district has many foreign students who return 
to their homelands without notifying the district, which results in their being 
incorrectly classified as dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
Caroline DeOlden, director of planning, assessment and evaluation for the 
Hacienda La Puente district, also faulted the state's figures. 
</P>
<P>
According to the state, the dropout rate in Hacienda La Puente has climbed from 
11.5% to 17%, an increase of 47.8% over the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
But DeOlden said that the district's own figures show only a 4.5% dropout rate. 
</P>
<P>
The disparity occurs because the state doesn't factor in students who join the 
school after the 10th grade but the district does. 
</P>
<P>
"In reality, you may start with 1,600 kids in the fall and during the year 200 
new kids come in," DeOlden said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hacienda La Puente administrator said she will travel to Sacramento on June 
19 for a meeting of an advisory committee for the California Board of Education 
that will evaluate the current method of collecting data on high school 
dropouts and propose changes.

Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee A. Iacocca declared today that he will stay in his 
post as head of the nation's No. 3 car company after his current contract 
expires in December, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came to Chrysler, I enlisted for the duration," Iacocca said in a press 
release. "Right now there's a battle raging and I'm not going to leave my 
troops in the field." 
</P>
<P>
The company last week lost its second-in-command and heir-apparent to Iacocca 
when Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald left to head the employee group bidding for 
UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, for $4.4 billion.

<P>
In a move likely to have repercussions for South Africa's image across the 
world, President Frederik W. de Klerk today announced that he will lift the 
4-year-old state of emergency in most of the country when it expires at 
midnight Friday, leaving it in effect only in the violent province of Natal. 
</P>
<P>
The step eliminates at the stroke of a pen what is perhaps the principal symbol 
of South African repression in the 1980s -- a system of detentions without 
trial, forced restrictions on the movement and lifestyle of dissidents, bans on 
many political organizations and unauthorized political meetings, and 
strictures on news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The end of the national emergency helps pave the way for black-white 
negotiations on dismantling apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
"The net result of the lifting of the state of emergency is that one of the 
main stumbling blocks (to constitutional negotiations) has been removed," De 
Klerk told Parliament in Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, African National Congress leader Nelson R. Mandela said De Klerk's 
action was "a victory for the people . . . both black and white." 
</P>
<P>
But he said he will continue to urge Western governments to maintain economic 
sanctions against South Africa, and he criticized the retention of the state of 
emergency in Natal. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the retention of the emergency in Natal is not likely to reduce 
the violence. 
</P>
<P>
The White House welcomed De Klerk's move, calling it a sign of "the remarkable 
progress" in recent months in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Right-wing whites, who have opposed recent reforms, criticized the action. 
</P>
<P>
During the state of emergency, more than 30,000 activists, most of them black, 
were detained without charge for varying lengths of time. Thousands more went 
into hiding after former President Pieter W. Botha imposed the restrictions 
June 12, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the end of the state of emergency, De Klerk also held out the 
prospect of other reforms. 
</P>
<P>
He said the government is considering changes in security laws that "could 
possibly inhibit the free conduct of peaceful politics" and said he is taking 
unspecified actions that will allow thousands of exiles to return home. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC says it has more than 15,000 exiled members. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk also said that as a "goodwill gesture" he will release 48 prisoners 
convicted of politically motivated crimes. The ANC has said there are 3,500 
inmates it considers political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC has said the lifting of the emergency, the release of political 
prisoners and the return of exiles are the main obstacles to full negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk defended the decision to keep Natal under emergency rule, saying the 
violence there "cannot be countered with the ordinary laws of the land." 
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 blacks have been killed in factional fighting in Natal since 
1986, including 500 who died in the first three months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
The main combatants in Natal are the supporters of the ANC, the country's most 
powerful black organization, and members of Inkatha, a relatively conservative 
Zulu group.

GLENDALE GIRL, 4, PINNED AGAINST WALL BY PICKUP TRUCK IS CRITICAL

<P>
A 4-year-old Glendale girl was in critical condition today after a parked 
pickup truck rolled and pinned her against a wall, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Judy Montez suffered a crushed skull in the accident at 2:30 p.m. 
Wednesday at the apartment complex where she lives in the 1000 block of Western 
Avenue, Sgt. Dean Durand said. 
</P>
<P>
Because only young children witnessed the accident, investigators are unsure 
what happened. Durand said several children from the apartment complex were 
playing in and around the pickup truck that was parked facing a wall. 
</P>
<P>
"From all indications, one of the children released the brake on the truck and 
it rolled," Durand said. "The truck hit her and pinned her against the wall." 
</P>
<P>
Several children started screaming when they saw that the girl was pinned. 
Adults who were in the apartments ran to her aid and called for paramedics. She 
was taken to Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, where she was in critical but 
stable condition, spokeswoman Cheryl Trinidad said.

China today denied threatening foreign correspondents and said they will be 
safe if they obey Chinese law. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week at least six foreign reporters were assaulted by security 
forces as they covered the first anniversary of the bloody military crackdown 
on pro-democracy demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers pointed guns at eight others. 
</P>
<P>
"We have never threatened any foreign correspondent," Foreign Ministry 
spokeswoman Li Jinhua told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you that if correspondents are not breaking the ethical code of 
reporters and are abiding by Chinese law, there will be no unpleasantness and 
their security will be assured," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She repeated earlier charges that some foreign reporters had engaged in illegal 
activities or conducted activities incompatible with their status. 
</P>
<P>
Li declined to identify the reporters she was accusing, nor would she specify 
what laws were violated.

WARSAW PACT TO EYE DEMOCRATIC TRANSFORMATION

Leaders of the Warsaw Pact called today for a review of the organization's aims 
and its transformation into a grouping of states "based on democratic 
principles." 
</P>
<P>
Pact leaders, in a statement issued after a one-day summit, said political 
change in Europe had made it possible to overcome the division of the 
continent. 
</P>
<P>
"We therefore consider it necessary to review the character and functions of 
the Warsaw Pact," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said the seven member states of the Soviet-led alliance are 
beginning a "transformation into a pact of sovereign and emancipated states 
based on democratic principles." 
</P>
<P>
The pact's new role, it said, is linked with disarmament and the creation of a 
pan-European security system. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had earlier told leaders at the summit, 
the first since popular revolutions purged Eastern Europe of hard-line Marxist 
rule, that the alliance has to change radically to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said the Soviet Union could envisage "basically every sort of 
transformation of the Warsaw treaty, including various forms of membership and 
obligation." 
</P>
<P>
But officials said members agreed there was no question of a mass departure 
from the organization. 
</P>
<P>
The final statement clearly marked a will throughout East Europe to end the 
pact's role as forged 35 years ago to shore up Kremlin power and confront NATO. 
</P>
<P>
Member states said concessions by both East and West had overcome "the 
ideological concept of the enemy. The concepts of East and West have now 
regained their purely geographical meaning."

DIDN'T DROP BODY OF BREZHNEV, SOVIET GRAVEDIGGER SAYS

The man who lowered the nation's last four leaders into their graves laid to 
rest today a rumor that he dropped Leonid I. Brezhnev's corpse. 
</P>
<P>
"The sound people heard that day was the sound of the Kremlin clock and a 
cannon salute," Georgy Kovalenko, gravedigger for Communist VIPs, told the 
Sobesednik supplement to the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Brezhnev was buried Nov. 15, 1982, Soviet citizens have disputed 
what caused a thud just as the Soviet leader was lowered into the grave. 
</P>
<P>
One word-of-mouth story said the bottom of the coffin was faulty, like most 
manufactured products during Brezhnev's time, and gave way under the bulky 
Brezhnev. Another blamed the gravediggers. 
</P>
<P>
But Kovalenko said he lowered the now-loathed Brezhnev "by the book" as he did 
Nikita S. Khrushchev, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko: "Quickly and 
gently as if by a high-speed elevator."

A federal jury today convicted a former Playboy model on charges she failed to 
pay taxes on $398,000 she received to provide companionship to an elderly 
millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated about 3 1/2 hours Wednesday evening and this morning 
before finding Leigh Ann Conley, 35, guilty on four misdemeanor counts of 
failing to file federal income tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
The conviction comes a month after her twin sister, Lynnette Harris, also a 
Playboy model, was found guilty of evading taxes on $686,000 she received from 
the same businessman, the late David Kritzik, who died last summer at age 89. 
</P>
<P>
The identical blonde twins appeared nude in Playboy magazine and in two films, 
"I, the Jury" and "Sorceress." 
</P>
<P>
Conley could be sentenced to four years in prison and $325,000 in fines.

Financially troubled Greyhound Lines Inc. today said it is withdrawing a tender 
offer for its junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"We have withdrawn our tender offer so that we can focus on mapping out a sound 
debt restructuring plan for the court," said J. Michael Doyle, senior vice 
president and financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came an hour before company officers were due in federal court 
for the first hearing on strikebound Greyhound's Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
petition. Greyhound officials said the companys intend to present a budget to 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Richard Schmidt, who is hearing the case in Brownsville. 
</P>
<P>
On May 21, the company asked holders of $225 million of its junk bonds to sell 
them back at steep discounts, saying the move was crucial to avoid the 
bankruptcy filing. The offer was to have expired June 18.

Unseasonal weather in parts of the country made May a sluggish month for 
retailing, major chain stores reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Big general merchandisers and discounters as well as specialty and department 
stores posted modest to middling sales gains for the month. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the May sales results were disappointing but principally reflected 
adverse weather conditions in the second half of the month, particularly in the 
East and Midwest," said Merrill Lynch retail analyst Jeffrey Feiner. 
</P>
<P>
Colder-than-normal temperatures and unusually heavy rainfall in some areas were 
blamed for keeping customers away from stores. The abnormal conditions banished 
thoughts of buying new summer apparel or seasonal merchandise, such as air 
conditioners and outdoor furniture. 
</P>
<P>
Sears merchandise group said its sales for the four weeks ended June 3 edged up 
0.9% to $2.5 billion. No. 2 ranked K mart Corp. posted a 10.4% May sales 
increase to $2.44 billion. May Department Stores Co. reported a 9% sales 
increase to $725.2 million, while The Limited Inc. said its sales rose 16% to 
$359.7 million.

Manuel H. Johnson, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve who helped steer 
the nation's monetary policy for the past 3 1/2 years, announced his 
resignation today to return to academic life. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 41, was appointed to the Fed by then-President Ronald Reagan on Feb. 
7, 1986, and became vice chairman on Aug. 4 of that year. He said his 
resignation would be effective Aug. 3, at the end of his term as vice chairman. 
His term on the central bank would have ended Aug. 21, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
"I deeply regret, but understand, Manley Johnson's decision," Fed Chairman Alan 
Greenspan said in a statement. "The vice chairman and I have been an effective 
team. I'll miss him." 
</P>
<P>
"He's done a terrific job, and we wish him well," Deputy White House Press 
Secretary Alixe Glen said of Johnson. There was no immediate word on a 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fed is losing a centrist . . . between the inflation hawks on one side and 
the recession worriers on the one side," said Irwin Kellner, chief economist at 
Manufacturers Hanover in New York. 
</P>
<P>
As Fed vice chairman, Johnson helped steer monetary policy through the last 
half of the nation's longest peacetime economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, the central bank has sought to stem inflation by keeping 
a tight grip on credit without tipping the economy into a recession. The result 
-- continued but slow economic growth -- has become known as the "soft 
landing." 
</P>
<P>
"I am extremely proud to have played a part in the unprecedented period of 
sustained economic growth and low inflation that has characterized the decade 
of the 1980s and continues into the 1990s," Johnson said in his letter of 
resignation to President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he plans to return to George Mason University in Washington's 
Virginia suburbs and assume the Koch Chair in international economics and 
become director of the Center for Global Market Studies.

A Japanese business leader said the United States should "stop whining" about 
Japan's trade barriers and stop "bashing Japan as a scapegoat" for America's 
own economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
Tadashi Yamamoto, president and chairperson of the Japan Center for 
International Exchange, made the remarks at the final day of Pacific 
University's First Pacific Symposium. 
</P>
<P>
Yamamoto said he was worried about negative feelings toward Japan in the United 
States. A poll presented to delegates by Rep. Les AuCoin (D-Ore.) showed his 
constituents resent the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"The negative feelings for Japan have slipped out of the beltway and into such 
hospitable communities as Portland, which is reason for grave concerns by the 
Japanese," Yamamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
Yamamoto added, however, that he is leaving the symposium with a great optimism 
about future ties between the two countries.

Actor Robby Benson, whose six-figure earnings at the University of South 
Carolina stirred controversy, is being wooed to remain in the Palmetto State. 
</P>
<P>
The State Development Board and Columbia College are working on a package deal 
to keep the actor and filmmaker in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The board that works to attract business and industry into the state, 
unanimously approved contract negotiations with Benson on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But Isabel M. Hill, head of the Development Board's film office, said talks 
with Benson have not moved past "very cursory initial contact." 
</P>
<P>
Officials asked Benson and his wife, singer-actress Karla DeVito, to consider 
staying in South Carolina, possibly to teach at Columbia College and help bring 
movie producers to the state, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Benson was caught up in negative publicity surrounding University of South 
Carolina President James B. Holderman, who resigned last week amid reports of 
lavish spending. 
</P>
<P>
Among spending criticized was the $158,367 in salary and living expenses the 
school paid Benson over the past two years. Benson taught filmmaking there and 
made the movie "Modern Love" in Columbia, using students and local 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
The actor of such films as "Tribute," "One on One" and "The Chosen" could not 
be reached for comment but he said last week that he resigned "the second Dr. 
Holderman did" and that he would be moving to Los Angeles this month.

Dick Clark has kept the company of millions during his 43 years in broadcast.

But he always plays to an audience of one.

"I visualize in my mind, I learned this from my idols of years ago, that 
there's only one person listening or watching and you direct yourself to that 
person," Clark said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a secret that Arthur Godfrey knew very well, Garry Moore knew very well 
-- the pioneers learned that lesson years ago." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Clark was counted among the pioneers. He accepted membership in 
the Emerson Radio Hall of Fame along with Charles Osgood, Paul Harvey, Harry 
Caray, Bob Hope and Frank Stanton.

The richest man in the country, John Kluge, was awarded $46.6 million in a suit 
against a former friend. 
</P>
<P>
Kluge, whose Metromedia empire includes telecommunications, computers and film 
production, had sued Bill Fugazy on the grounds that Fugazy had overvalued the 
limo company he sold to Kluge by about $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
A New York jury awarded Kluge $15.5 million and the judge tripled that amount. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an absurd decision," Fugazy said. "It's a personal thing, Kluge and me. 
Personally, we were the best of friends." Kluge and Fugazy had once been so 
close that when Kluge converted to Catholicism, Fugazy became his godfather, 
but they no longer speak. 
</P>
<P>
Kluge, 75, whose fortune is estimated at $5.2 billion, recently reached a 
divorce settlement with Patricia Kluge, 45, in which he gave her a 45-room 
mansion in Charlottesville, Va., and the annual interest on $1 billion, which 
amounts to about $85 million a year.

James Michener wrote a plea to three young men who pleaded guilty to 
anti-Semitic vandalism: "Get off that doomed train right now." 
</P>
<P>
A judge had given the men an unusual sentence: learn about the Nazi Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the assignment was to read a chapter from the author's book "Poland" on 
a concentration camp. 
</P>
<P>
After learning of the sentence, Michener wrote to the men through the judge, 
John Carey, who said Wednesday he was moved by the author's interest.

"Fellows, what you're doing is wrong," Michener wrote. "You will stain 
yourselves if you follow that route. Get off that doomed train right now."

LIZ SMITH: MATERIAL GIRL MADONNA WILL BE PERFECT AS 'EVITA'

"I WORSHIP the paper he writes on!" That's what Madonna says about the prolific 
and talented Andrew Lloyd Webber -- and with good reason. Any minute, there 
will be an official announcement stating that the star of the coming "Dick 
Tracy" movie is definitely set to play the long a'borning female protagonist in 
the film version of "Evita." 
</P>
<P>
I know, I know -- Madonna was up for this movie once before and it didn't work 
out. Then-to-be-director Oliver Stone wanted her to audition for him before she 
could be cast; he says Madonna refused. (As you know, practically every actress 
who can even hum has been considered for the role of the late wife of the 
Argentine dictator, Juan Peron of the '40s.) 
</P>
<P>
Stone went on actually to audition and then hire Meryl Streep for the part. The 
actress bowed out some months ago, saying she was exhausted. This was in the 
middle of her back-to-back filmings of "She-Devil" and "Postcards From the 
Edge." Now Stone is also out of the "Evita" project. 
</P>
<P>
This time, no director has yet been chosen. But the movie will begin filming in 
the fall. I think Madonna was born to play Eva Peron and she may just be 
brilliant as the infamous first lady who sings Tim Rice's immortal words, 
"Don't cry for me, Argentina!" If everything goes according to plan, Webber 
will be a very busy man from now until at least the end of the year. He'll have 
two of the biggest movie projects in show biz history -- "Evita" and "The 
Phantom of the Opera" being filmed at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
OH, FORGET those ridiculous gloom and doom rumors about liquor bottles hidden 
under her bed and just know that Elizabeth Taylor is doing just fine. She is 
already 43 pounds lighter and in good spirits. The other day, Shirley MacLaine 
came to visit La Liz at St. John's Hospital, bearing a large chocolate cake in 
an unmentionable male shape. She also brought along a naughty X-rated movie. 
The two famous ladies devoured half the cake and hooted and howled at the film. 
</P>
<P>
MTV HAS shown us Cher's nearly naked backside (after 9 p.m. at night, that is) 
and they've offered up Madonna in chains. But the powers that be at MTV draw 
the line at "male" bondage. At least they weren't too thrilled with the group 
Revenge and their "Pineapple Face" video. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Playboy's Suze Randall, this offering has been deemed 
"unacceptable," because -- among other things -- it features male band members 
wearing chastity belts around their necks. 
</P>
<P>
Just remember how fastidious MTV can be the next time they show you some half 
nude woman squirming and writhing under male domination. MTV does have its 
limits -- sort of. Chauvinistic ones.

The average number of rounds played by each golfer in the United States 
declined 7.7% in 1989 from the previous year, according to research by the 
National Golf Foundation released today. 
</P>
<P>
The average fell to 19.2 rounds per golfer from 20.8 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Total rounds declined 2.7% to 474 million from 487 million. 
</P>
<P>
The survey wasn't designed to identify the reasons for the decline, but 
researchers said Hurricane Hugo and record spring rains in the Northeast were 
two likely factors. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the reasons, our findings show that, while there were certainly more 
people than ever playing golf in 1989, they played on average a little less -- 
meaning relatively little growth overall for the golf industry," said Joseph F. 
Beditz, foundation president. 
</P>
<P>
Rounds played is one of the leading business indicators for the industry. In 
1987 and 1988, annual rounds played increased 3% and 12%, respectively.

Jim Beatty, the first man to break the 4-minute mile indoors, and Charles 
Dumas, the first to high-jump 7 feet, are among four new members of the 
National Track and Field Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
The others, announced today, are Doris Brown Heritage, winner of 14 U.S. 
distance titles and five world cross-country events, and Rick Wohlhuter, a 
two-time Olympian and former world record-holder at 880 yards and 1,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>
They will be inducted Nov. 30 in Seattle during the annual convention of The 
Athletics Congress, national governing body for track and field. 
</P>
<P>
Beatty was the highest vote-getter with 286 out of 406 ballots cast by members 
of the track and field community and the news media. He first broke the 
4-minute barrier indoors with a time of 3:58.9 in 1962 at Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The former University of North Carolina runner also set American records in 
five events that summer and became the first American to hold records 
simultaneously in all events from 1,500 to 5,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Beatty, 55, now living in Charlotte, N.C., served in the state legislature but 
was defeated in a bid for the U.S. House in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Dumas cleared 7 feet, 1/2 inch, at the 1956 Olympic Trials and won a gold medal 
later that year at Melbourne. He was sixth in the 1960 Olympics in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
From 1955 to '59 Dumas won or shared five straight national high jump titles 
and was ranked first in the world twice in that span. 
</P>
<P>
Dumas, 53, now lives in Inglewood, Calif. He was second in voting for the Hall 
of Fame with 263 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Heritage first came into prominence in 1967 when she won the first of five 
straight world cross-country titles and represented the United States on nine 
world cross-country teams. She also was on two Olympic squads and placed fifth 
at 800 meters in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
In all, she won 14 national titles and set a world record at 3,000 meters in 
1971. 
</P>
<P>
Wohlhuter, a Notre Dame graduate, was the top American half-miler of the 
mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
He broke the U.S. record for 800 meters twice, set world records for the 
880-yard run twice and added a world record for the 1,000 meters in 1974.

Jennifer Capriati's Paris adventure ended today, but not without a fight. 
Monica Seles beat the 14-year-old American on her sixth match point to reach 
the women's final of the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old second seed from Yugoslavia won her 31st match in a row and set 
up a championship meeting with No. 1 Steffi Graf by beating Capriati, 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, who is looking for her 10th Grand Slam title, took just 63 minutes to 
beat Czechoslovakia's Jana Novotna, 6-1, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
A long forehand by Capriati ended her own incredible run, two victories shy of 
a Grand Slam title in only her fifth professional tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I am disappointed because I expected it to be a little closer. Everybody 
expected it to be a little closer," said Capriati, 14, the youngest Grand Slam 
semifinalist. "I was too impatient. It was just good to get to the semifinals." 
</P>
<P>
Seles said the American could look forward to even better things. 
</P>
<P>
"No one at the age of 14 played as well as she does," Seles said. "You could 
see her experience wasn't there. You could see her game was there." 
</P>
<P>
The championship on Saturday will be a replay of the final of a clay-court 
tournament in Berlin three weeks ago, when Seles broke Graf's 66-match winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati turned pro in March and has stunned tennis by doing so well. She 
reached the final of her first professional tournament, came in second in 
another event and blew through the first five rounds of her first Grand Slam 
competition without dropping a single set. 
</P>
<P>
She had been expected to give Seles a tougher fight today but her nerves seemed 
to let her down. Seles rarely needed to call on her full range of shots as 
Capriati consistently failed to keep the ball in the court in the first set. 
</P>
<P>
"I was making so many errors and that's why the first set went so quickly," 
Capriati said after the 62-minute match. 
</P>
<P>
Seles broke the Florida youngster's service immediately and was ahead, 3-0, 
before Capriati broke back, then surrendered only one more game in the first 
set. 
</P>
<P>
The second set began with five service breaks, though Capriati ought to have 
held serve in the fifth game. A few line calls also upset the normally 
unflappable American. 
</P>
<P>
With the crowd on Capriati's side, Seles needed five match points before 
sealing the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati was philosophical, praising Seles and blaming herself for playing 
badly. 
</P>
<P>
"She kept me pinned to the baseline, moving me left and right. I'd seen her 
play before but I didn't realize what it would be like on the court," Capriati 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Against Novotna, Graf faltered only briefly in the middle of the second set. 
</P>
<P>
"I was leading easily, 6-1, 3-0, and then I maybe lost concentration," Graf 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Graf took the first set in just 26 minutes, dropping only the second game and 
17 points in total, then reeled off the first three games of the second set 
before taking her foot momentarily off the accelerator. 
</P>
<P>
Novotna, with the aid of a Graf double-fault, broke service for the only time 
in the match and then held her own serve to close to 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Novotna, who upset fourth-seeded Gabriela Sabatini in the fourth round and 
eighth-seeded Katerina Maleeva in the quarters, had a chance for 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
But Graf, supremely confident, was not to be further delayed. She finished the 
match off with a typical sweeping forehand across court to qualify for her 
fourth consecutive final in Paris.

YANKEES MANAGER -- DOES HE REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE AT ALL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN GREENBERG, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So Carl (Stump) Merrill is the new Yankees manager. Why not Dina Merrill? 
Streep, Meryl? Would choosing them be any more ridiculous? 
</P>
<P>
How about Merrill Lynch? It's already on Wall Street, so the Yankees save on 
moving expenses. Besides, Merrill Lynch has so many managers that even George 
Steinbrenner wouldn't have time to fire them all. 
</P>
<P>
On second thought, why put such an irresistible challenge in front of our boy 
George? He loves a challenge. With his only real rival for the title Lord of 
the Laughingstocks -- ex-Cavaliers owner Ted Stepien -- retired and out of the 
way, give George the Lifetime Achievement Award for having met the challenge of 
taking baseball's greatest franchise and covering it with mud by running it 
into the ground, as befits an impatient child who inherited his father's 
shipbuilding company. 
</P>
<P>
Ever notice how fast these guys walk the plank? The typical Yankees manager 
usually lasts about as long as a bad sitcom. In the case of Bucky Dent, hired 
Aug. 18 and fired Wednesday, about 14 weeks -- not including the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
What's the difference between managing a sitcom and managing the Yankees? In a 
sitcom, they use a laugh track to camouflage that the show isn't funny. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever happened to reruns? Dent's firing marked the 18th time 
Steinbrenner has changed managers in the 18 years since he became majority 
owner of the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Dent's ouster invites frightening questions with no easy answers. With Billy 
Martin dead, and with zero population growth an American goal in the 21st 
Century, could George, like a chain- saw-crazy paper company that fails to 
recycle, be in danger of running out of managerial timber? 
</P>
<P>
But let's look at the glass as half full rather than half empty. What we're 
really talking about here is a dream job. After all, when you're trying to fill 
a job for which no one is qualified, everyone is qualified. You don't have to 
be able to type or weld or think. The thinking is done for you. You don't have 
to be able to develop long-range plans for the future, because there is no 
future. All you need is the willingness to work short hours for high pay 
without making a long-term commitment. It's the perfect temp job. 
</P>
<P>
Can't you hear the headhunters now? 
</P>
<P>
"Hello, Kelly Girl? Send me somebody over to manage the Yankees. Job could run 
a few weeks, maybe a little longer. I'd prefer somebody with a good phone 
voice. The Boss likes to talk on the phone." 
</P>
<P>
"Hello, Manpower? Got anybody over there who wears a 44 regular? Last guy wore 
Size 44, and they'd like to get a little more use out of his uniform. It's 
almost new." 
</P>
<P>
But why waste valuable time and money calling a temps agency? Since the job 
does require a lot of travel and the ability to pack fast and light, why not 
just hire flight attendants? 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, I'm Paul, and I'll be your senior flight attendant today on our flight to 
Chicago. Some of you are going on to San Francisco, but there will be a crew 
change at O'Hare. I'm happy to inform you that I'll be heading right out to 
Comiskey Park, where I'll be managing the Yankees today, and maybe even for the 
entire four-game series. The other members of our crew, Robin and Lisa, will be 
serving as my first- and third-base coaches. I'm making out the lineup card 
right now, but as soon as I'm done, we'll be coming around to serve you lunch 
and the beverage of your choice. If you have any questions about my pitching 
rotation for the series, just ring your flight attendant call button and 
someone will be around to explain it to you." 
</P>
<P>
When Dent was fired, the Yankees were in last place in the American League 
East, the worst division in baseball. The Yankees' 18-31 record was the worst 
in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
But their problems go deeper than wins and losses. The Yankees are in the 
entertainment business, and as anyone who has seen them this season can attest, 
they are anything but entertaining. Although the Yankees have yet to prove they 
are one of the worst teams in baseball history, they may be one of the dullest. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill, who was doing his third tour of duty as skipper at Triple-A Columbus 
when he was tapped by Steinbrenner's fickle finger of fate, said the team he's 
inheriting looks listless. Can't question Stump's keen insight on that. 
</P>
<P>
Just his grasp of reality. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me 14 years to get to this point," he said. "The one thing I'm going 
to try to do is just have fun." 
</P>
<P>
Just a wild guess, but Stump's probably not going to have a whole lot of fun 
working for George and managing these Yankees. That's too bad, seeing as how he 
waited 14 years for the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that the rest of us probably won't have to wait that long. As 
Steinbrenner steps up the pace of his firings -- he also fired two of Dent's 
coaches -- it shouldn't be long before every man, woman and child across this 
great land gets a chance to manage the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Until, that is, the day sanity overcomes Steinbrenner. The day he fires 
himself.

CRITIC AT LARGE: FIRSTENBERG'S FERTILE DECADE AS AFI CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With all the other things to be said about it, Jean Firstenberg remarked the 
other afternoon, "Twin Peaks" reflected nicely on the American Film Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Its creator, David Lynch, had left the Philadelphia School of Art to start a 
new life in film at the AFI. "He was so broke," Firstenberg said, "that he 
lived in the stables at Greystone, having himself locked in at night so the 
security guards wouldn't find him and throw him out." (Greystone was the 
Beverly Hills mansion that was the first home of the AFI's Center for Advanced 
Film Studies.) 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the two-hour pilot by Lynch himself, episodes of "Twin Peaks" 
were directed by AFI alumni Caleb Deschanel, Tim Hunter and Lesli 
Linka-Glatter. 
</P>
<P>
It was in other areas a pleasing year for the AFI. Another of its alumni, Ed 
Zwick, directed the fine Civil War film, "Glory." "It had one of the great 
battle scenes in the whole history of the movies," Firstenberg said proudly. "I 
asked Ed, 'Where did that come from,' and he grinned. But that's the philosophy 
of the conservatory: You have them for a moment and you try to show them the 
tools. After that, it's their struggle to find chances to use them." 
</P>
<P>
Firstenberg took over the leadership of the AFI from its founder and first 
director, George Stevens Jr., in January, 1980. On Friday at the annual awards 
luncheon of Women in Film, she receives the group's Crystal Award for the 
accomplishments of her first decade in office. 
</P>
<P>
These notably include raising the millions needed to buy the AFI's permanent 
home, formerly Immaculate Heart College, at Franklin and Western in Hollywood. 
Of special note to Women in Film has been her strong backing for the Directing 
Workshop for Women, whose alumnae include Randa Haines ("Children of a Lesser 
God") and Lee Grant ("Tell Me a Riddle"). 
</P>
<P>
"Since it was launched in 1974," Firstenberg said, "a hundred women have gone 
through the DWW, and about half of them are now in the Directors Guild. A while 
ago (producer) Gale Anne Hurd and I had a long meeting about it. Should we 
continue it? It's not easy. We're proud of what the women have done, and yet 
it's not a large amount of work. 
</P>
<P>
"And we agreed that that was just the reason to keep the DWW going. It's still 
hard for women to get on the short list for directing assignments. Ours is the 
only program of its kind and it's important to keep the idea of women as 
directors in front of the public. Women have to be ready when the opportunities 
begin to appear. And they must, and they will. We've come inches, not miles, 
but we have to do it that way, inch by inch." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back over her first decade, Firstenberg sees it not least as "the time 
film preservation came of age." The AFI became a focus for the effort with its 
own preservation efforts, and it lent a hand in the restoration of David Lean's 
"Lawrence of Arabia." 
</P>
<P>
"People are actively working on preservation everywhere; there's much broader 
participation than there was. That was the triumph of the '80s, and in the '90s 
the work will get done." 
</P>
<P>
The '90s are also going to see a years-long celebration of the centennial of 
the movies. "It's going to crystallize what the cinema has meant to the lives 
of all of us." The showy re-releases of classic films that began with "Lawrence 
of Arabia" and continued with "Funny Face" and "The Ten Commandments" are 
certain to proliferate. 
</P>
<P>
By now there are 1,000 AFI alumni. At this year's commencement a week ago, 
there were 120 graduates, 46 of them receiving master's degrees, with an 
honorary degree for editor Dede Allen, presented by Warren Beatty, for whom she 
edited "Reds." Another honorary degree will be given to Akira Kurosawa in 
September when he is here for the launching of his latest film, "Dreams." 
</P>
<P>
Also honored was John Scully, chief executive of Apple, the computer firm with 
a special interest in applications of the computer to film. This fall the 
AFI-Apple Computer Center for Film and Video Makers will open on the AFI 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a far different job that I'm doing than the one I came to do 10 years 
ago," Jean Firstenberg says. "The world is no longer divided into nonprofit and 
profit-making organizations. All organizations have to be run in a totally 
businesslike way, almost non-idealistic ways." 
</P>
<P>
Philanthropy no longer exists as it did only a decade ago, Firstenberg has 
discovered. "Corporate giving is now market-driven, related to the corporate 
image." 
</P>
<P>
Like educational institutions generally, Firstenberg says, the AFI has to look 
hard at everything it does. "Is it essential to the mandate . . . and will it 
generate income?" 
</P>
<P>
The AFI is looking to summer programs that will make use of the campus during 
what might otherwise be an unproductive time. "It's like McDonald's adding 
breakfast rather than waiting to open at lunchtime. Yes, I guess we're looking 
for our own Egg McMuffin. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be more entrepreneurial than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
To ease the annual financial strain, Firstenberg has launched Campaign 2000, a 
$20-million endowment fund that, she says, "should launch us into the new 
century."

ISLAND SON; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: A POET-PLAYWRIGHT USES SATIRE TO EXPLORE LOVE AND FATE AMID THE PLIGHT 
OF HIS NATIVE ST. LUCIA. HIS PLAY, 'VIVA DETROIT,' WILL OPEN AT LATC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In our hectic society, whether change occurs because of fate or progress is 
usually considered after the fact. But the distinction is vital in places where 
the answer can still affect change. 
</P>
<P>
In Derek Walcott's new play, "Viva Detroit" (which has its world premiere 
Saturday at the Los Angeles Theatre Center), a local tourist hustler in the 
West Indian island of St. Lucia named Sonny thinks a one-way ticket to Detroit 
will deliver him to the promised land. A successful but unhappy white 
commercial photographer named Pat leaves America for St. Lucia, which 
represents her island of tranquility. At the intersection of their dream, 
Walcott locates a love story. 
</P>
<P>
Walcott, who in addition to being a playwright is one of the most prominent 
poets in the English-speaking world, was born and raised in St. Lucia. The 
atmosphere of the play is prefigured by any one of a number of his poems, such 
as: 
</P>
<P>
 . . . for once . . . you wanted no career 
</P>
<P>
 but this sheer light, this clear, 
</P>
<P>
 infinite, boring, paradisal sea, 
</P>
<P>
 but hoped it would mean something to declare 
</P>
<P>
 today, I am your poet, yours, 
</P>
<P>
 all this you knew, 
</P>
<P>
 but never guessed you'd come 
</P>
<P>
 to know there are homecomings without home. 
</P>
<P>
From "Homecoming: Anse La Raye" 
</P>
<P>
If Walcott's poems radiate with a Homeric sea-glitter, he's still acutely 
mindful of modern dislocation. The West Indian's arterial subterranean link 
with black Africa rises to meet the imperial power of the English language. The 
native island figure labors in an urbanized, racially divided consciousness. 
All of it lends Walcott a kind of double vision that observes unusual shadows 
in what most of the rest of us take for granted, or don't see the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"Viva Detroit" is a comedy, and at this point -- or at least during this 
interview -- Walcott didn't know what to make of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Watching rehearsals, I found the play extremely strange," he said. "I'd 
intended it to be almost a farce, but I didn't realize when writing it that the 
players coming through were less comedic. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I want to create is laughter -- comedy always has a moral 
intention. By creating racial stereotypes, you create a tension in this country 
that's instant and visible. Sonny is the kind of person you see a lot of in the 
Caribbean, a character who begins as a beach boy to meet tourists. He puts on 
an American accent. The more he talks American, the more he loses himself. 
</P>
<P>
"You could say he's a metaphor for the whole Carribbean, which is being taken 
over by the hotel industry and the developers. The two most active volcanic 
peaks in the world are on St. Lucia. The government and the developers are 
planning a funicular railroad and a hotel which would be both eyesores and a 
desecration. That's Sonny's future. To create another Miami, that's the 
island's future for as long as it continues to hustle itself in the name of 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat, the woman, is also caught in the trap of selling herself through the gift 
of her photography, though the idea of selling out is less dramatic and no 
longer as confrontational as it once was. You have to wonder why she's falling 
in love with him. Is it the island, as though you could live life under a glass 
bell? You do see this sort of thing happen a lot and I'm baffled about what 
expresses it more, comedy or pathos?" 
</P>
<P>
At 60, Walcott is beyond the need to ingratiate himself if he doesn't feel like 
it, and in fact has the hard edge of someone who's been around the demimonde, 
like a fight manager, say, or a jazz musician -- someone who's brushed with 
evil. He began publishing in 1948, and divides his time among St. Lucia, 
Trinidad and teaching at Boston University (he's a 1981 recipient of a John D. 
and Catherine MacArthur Foundation "genius" grant of $250,000). His head has 
kept the handsome shape of what could've been a rakish youth, and the uneven 
magnification of his eyeglasses slighty enlarges one pale eye, which peers out 
in owlish scrutiny. He has the chain smoker's heavy early-morning voice; his 
speech rhythm is rapid, easy and clipped -- quite unlike the meditative calm of 
his poems. 
</P>
<P>
"My father died when I was 1. I have a twin brother. My mother was a 
schoolteacher. She did a lot of recitation as a teacher and an amateur actress. 
She was a Methodist in a very bigoted French Catholic community." The bigotry 
didn't sour his feel for the island. "St. Lucia has a great feeling of 
spirituality. The island exerts a natural force that's tactile, rare." 
</P>
<P>
His mother died recently, and he described the burial plot he found for her 
close to a beach. "It's near the airport, but so what? When I flew out of the 
island I felt confident that I had found the spot for her perfect repose, by 
the sea." 
</P>
<P>
The subject put him in a contemplative state of mind. "It isn't death that's 
unreal or weird," he said. "It's life. Why are the dead silent? Why are they 
sworn to secrecy? It's not enough for us to think of ourselves as plants. 
There's got to be a force within the process. When Dante refers to the 'Love 
that moves the sun and the stars,' that's what I think he's talking about. It's 
not just love in man and woman. It's overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
The image of his mother's grave returned his mind's eye to St. Lucia. "I'm past 
the age of embarrassment," he said. "I've lived abroad and in America. 'Exile' 
is a word I used to use easily. But real exile is when you can never go back. 
Spiritual exile is the worst kind. I'm anchored in St. Lucia. Wherever I go is 
an extension of the rope." 
</P>
<P>
That the island offers itself as a mirror of unassuagable longing to the 
characters in "Viva Detroit" is one thing, but to switch back metaphors, 
nothing threatens to fray the rope more than progress. "What lies ahead for the 
Caribbean is economic tragedy," Walcott said. "If Sonny's idea of Detroit is 
something not of the real America, Pat feels she's beyond the cliche of the 
island. But is she?" In other words, is the dream rooted in the physicality of 
place? 
</P>
<P>
That question echoes through a great deal of Walcott's work. "I've felt like 
doing a Casals and saying I'd never go back to the island again for as long as 
the government was in collusion with the developers. But it's a hell of a 
threat." 
</P>
<P>
He looked pensive, as though, considering all the ways the island has nourished 
him, the reality of the threat were too terrible to contemplate. In the 
meantime, he has the theater in which to think things through, the momentarily 
perfect venue for the sentiment he repeated several times in conversation: 
"Life is unreal."

When Kaci Keffer joined the Woodbridge High School track and field team four 
years ago, she had very little knowledge of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know anything," Keffer said. "(Coach George) Varvas would say, "OK, 
run a mile.' And I'd be like, 'Uh, how far is that?' 
</P>
<P>
"He told us we were going to have a time trial to see who would be on the mile 
relay. He lined us up on the track and said, 'OK, run a 400.' And I'm like, 
'Uh, how many laps is that?' I ended up making it, but I didn't even know what 
a relay was. Then everyone was talking about 'going to state' And I'm like, 
'What's state?" 
</P>
<P>
Four years and three state-meet appearances later, Keffer, The Times' Orange 
County athlete of the year in girls' track and field, has an impressive -- and 
wide-ranging -- understanding of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
Keffer, a senior who was named athlete of the meet at several invitationals 
this year, including the Orange County Championships, always has been 
impressive in her diversity. This year was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
Keffer led the county in both the 400 meters (56.54 seconds) and 300 hurdles 
(42.84). 
</P>
<P>
Along with teammates Kristina Lockwood, Madelline Liseblad and Michelle Muniz, 
Keffer helped Woodbridge to a county-leading time in the 400 relay (48.83). In 
the 1,600 relay, Keffer's anchor leg gave Woodbridge the county's second-best 
time (3:55.62). 
</P>
<P>
And, so as not to get bored, Keffer also occasionally competed in the 200, 800, 
long jump, shotput and discus. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to name a highlight and a low point of the season, Keffer summed both in 
three words: the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
She was happy that she advanced to the state meet in the 300 hurdles and 
thrilled with her career-best time (42.84) in the state preliminaries, but she 
was not happy with a slower time (43.07) and third-place finish in the final 
the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"Making it to state, and breaking my best time was great," Keffer said. "I was 
really amazed. I was like, 'How did I do that?' . . But a 43 the next day? I 
mean, you'd figure you'd go faster in the finals." 
</P>
<P>
When she compares that to what happened last year, though, Keffer admits her 
senior season was a good one. 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman and a sophomore, Keffer had reached the state tournament as a 
member of the relay team. As a junior last year, she seemed to have a good 
chance of advancing to the state meet in the 300 hurdles. But at the Masters 
meet -- the qualifying meet for the state championships -- Keffer went from 
third to seventh in her race and did not advance. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave up halfway through the race," Keffer said. "I was in third and I just 
mentally gave up. I still haven't watched the video of it. I probably should. I 
just went home that night and cried and went to bed." 
</P>
<P>
Keffer said she considered that to be one of her most valuable learning 
experiences. This year, Keffer was more mentally prepared than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"She's grown tremendously, both in her times and psychologically," Varvas said. 
"Track was something she just did in the beginning. She was not really into it. 
But over the years, it's really become part of her life."

<P>
As a junior last year, Phouphet Singbandith of Magnolia High School approached 
the triple jump from a purely athletic point of view: Work hard, improve and 
help the team get some points. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Singbandith, The Times' Orange County athlete of the year in boys' 
track and field, mixed in a little business savvy. Singbandith wanted more than 
a shoe box full of medals and plaques by season's end. He wanted a college 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, he got both. 
</P>
<P>
On April 22, two weeks after he jumped a then national-leading 51 feet 3/4 
inches at the Arcadia Invitational, Singbandith signed a letter of intent with 
Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
"I think once he hit 50 feet (early in the season) he stopped jumping for 
rah-rah-sis-boom-bah and he started jumping for dollars in college," Magnolia 
Coach Bob Mangan said. "Once he saw he could parlay his jumping into a college 
ride, he became more serious, and those around him became more serious, too." 
</P>
<P>
Mangan and assistant coach Al Wallin were cautious in their plans for 
Singbandith this year, sometimes keeping him out of league meets if the points 
weren't needed and having him make all-out efforts only at the most important 
competitions. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, their standout athlete spent most of the season dealing with various 
injuries, some of them the result of playing on the school's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
"Phouphet would go in (the game), and I would literally cringe," Mangan said 
last year. "I would just sit there, hoping he wouldn't twist another ankle." 
</P>
<P>
Add that to a knee injury from the high jump, and Singbandith wasn't looking 
too well going into last year's state meet. 
</P>
<P>
"From the Orange County Championships on, Phouphet was one jump away from 
ending his season, we felt," Mangan said. "I mean, his knee was wrapped, his 
ankle was taped, he limped. . . . I'd sit in the stands and my stomach would 
just churn. Even though he made it to the state meet, I did not enjoy last 
season at all." 
</P>
<P>
This year, of course, has been most enjoyable for the Singbandith camp. Not 
only did he secure a full scholarship and avoid injuries, he also was 
undefeated, winning the state title June 2 with the second-best leap in the 
nation this year, 51-7 3/4. The nation's best is 52-0, set by Erick Walder of 
Mobile, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
That mark would have placed Singbandith 10th in the NCAA Division I triple jump 
final, also held June 2. 
</P>
<P>
Although Singbandith, a native of Laos, signed with Nebraska without visiting 
the campus, he and his mother, Pany, talked it over and decided it was the 
right place. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother didn't want me to go (to college) in L.A. She said there were too 
many gangs and too many bad things going on there," Singbandith said. "I think 
Nebraska sounds good. But I've never been there." 
</P>
<P>
Singbandith, who hasn't flown since he and his family immigrated to the United 
States 10 years ago, will take a trip to Lincoln next month with Mangan. Mangan 
already has helped him choose a dormitory, "one that's upwind from the 
animals," Mangan said. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly what's in front of him is very unclear -- it's exciting for him," 
Mangan said. "Nebraska is not Southern California, but neither is Laos. He's 
made one transition, so he can make another."

<TEXT>
<P>
There is a saying in England that rugby is a sport for hooligans played by 
gentlemen, whereas soccer is a game for gentlemen played by hooligans. 
</P>
<P>
That observation has been advanced by generations of rugby players, but despite 
their lack of objectivity, no one has taken exception. 
</P>
<P>
In soccer's First World countries of Europe and South America, the game in many 
cases is played by street urchins who turn professional as teen-agers, or at 
about the same time they drop out of school. Whatever success they will have 
for the rest of their lives depends largely on the success they have in their 
few productive years on the field. 
</P>
<P>
So to say that many players in the World Cup are fighting for their lives, or 
at least their livelihoods, is not a gross exaggeration. Even if it were, they 
play as if their lives were at stake. 
</P>
<P>
Unless Cameroon's players have been training on the moon, they are aware that 
Argentina's Diego Maradona has an ingrown toenail on the big toe of his right 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
Cameroon's starting 11, plus the two reserves, will not feel as if they have 
earned their paychecks in Friday's opening game at Milan unless each of them 
has stepped on Maradona's inflamed big toe at least twice. 
</P>
<P>
It is a pity for Maradona that Argentina's opener is not against the United 
States. To its players, he is Mr. Maradona. They not only would not step on his 
toe, they would help him cross the street to get to the game. 
</P>
<P>
They are not hooligans. They are Boy Scouts. Having learned the sport on the 
suburban fields of the American Youth Soccer Organization, they have honed 
their skills at institutions of higher learning. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is the United States the youngest team in the 24-team tournament, it 
is the most educated. The head coach taught history at the university level. 
The goalkeeper coach has his Ph.D. If this were the "GE College Bowl," no one 
would be making fun of the U.S. team's chances. 
</P>
<P>
With all of that exposure to academia comes a certain amount of refinement, 
which is all too apparent when the United States plays soccer. 
</P>
<P>
"In international tournaments, we always seem to win the fair-play award," said 
midfielder Paul Caligiuri, a former UCLA co-captain who grew up in Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
For the uninitiated, that is like being named Miss Congeniality in a beauty 
contest. It is not an award for which the last U.S. team in the World Cup 40 
years ago would have been a contender. 
</P>
<P>
As head of the U.S. delegation, Walter Bahr, a midfielder on that team, has 
nothing but kind words for the current players. But he does note that most of 
the players in 1950 were from working-class, Central European immigrant 
families and approached the game with a tenacity that is not necessarily 
encouraged by AYSO. 
</P>
<P>
Bahr recalled that the 1950 team had a professional carpenter and defender 
named Charley Colombo, who was tough as nails. Bahr said Colombo would tackle 
his own mother to save a goal, and it was his jarring takedown of Stanley 
Mortensen that saved the United States' stunning 1-0 victory over England. 
</P>
<P>
The closest the latest U.S. entry has to Colombo is John Stollmeyer, who, at 
27, is the team's oldest player. 
</P>
<P>
As a defensive midfielder, it is his job to make sure that anyone who busts 
loose in the U.S. end of the field gets busted. He is the team's middle 
linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was younger, I was smaller than most other players," said Stollmeyer, 
who is from Annandale, Va., and Indiana University. "I learned how to tackle, 
how to fight and how to get stuck in. My father used to tell me, 'If you go in 
for a tackle half-hearted, you're going to get hurt.' So when I tackle, I 
tackle for keeps." 
</P>
<P>
That has not always made him a popular player in the United States.

"I don't know how many times I've heard people say, 'You don't have to play 
that hard,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's the only reason I'm here. I don't have the speed or the skill of 
most of the other players. But I let the other team know that I'm out there. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to establish an attitude in the first five minutes. The first tackle is 
to win. I'm telling my teammates, 'I'm starting to play; you'd better start, 
too.' " 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the U.S. teams, Stollmeyer's intensity is not always 
contagious. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to get mean and aggressive," forward Bruce Murray said Wednesday after 
the team's morning workout. "We're too clean." 
</P>
<P>
The sport's governing body, the International Federation of Assn. Football 
(FIFA), would approve. It has warned World Cup referees that they will be 
suspended if they do not strictly enforce the rules. 
</P>
<P>
Referees have been instructed to give yellow cards -- two in one game lead to 
disqualification -- to players who commit the so-called professional foul, 
which has been winked at in the past. 
</P>
<P>
It also is called a tactical foul, which means that a player brings down an 
opponent in order to prevent him from becoming a scoring threat. Referees 
usually call a foul on the offending player but do not give him a yellow card 
unless he has displayed no finesse whatsoever in his tackle. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not coaching that in the United States," said Ralph Perez, a U.S. 
assistant coach from Cal State San Bernardino. "That's considered a dirty play. 
But to play at this level, we need some enforcers. You need a balance between 
dancers and guys who get stuck in." 
</P>
<P>
The United States needs more Stollmeyers. 
</P>
<P>
And he will believe FIFA is getting tough when he sees it. 
</P>
<P>
"They're always telling us they're cracking down on some of the fouling that 
goes on, but that's part of the game," he said. "It's like trying to get 
fighting out of hockey."

No one knows whether Kenesaw Mountain Landis, the first commissioner of the 
game, loved baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Could he have named the starting lineup of the 1929 Philadelphia Athletics, 
complete with batting averages, strikeouts per inning and walks per game? Would 
he have known how Pie Traynor got his nickname? Did he collect player cards as 
a kid? Did he even keep score at the games? Did he think of a double play as 
6-4-3? Was he even up on the infield-fly rule? 
</P>
<P>
Did he even know who the third baseman was in the Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance 
combination? (It was Harry Steinfeldt.) 
</P>
<P>
Would he know who Frank Leja was? 
</P>
<P>
We have a commissioner now who knows all of the above -- and more. Chances are 
good that if Francis T. (Fay) Vincent were not the commissioner of all 
baseball, he would be haunting the baseball card and memorabilia shows. If he 
weren't barring Pete Rose, he might be buying Charlie Hustle's batting helmet. 
</P>
<P>
Fay Vincent is like a kid locked in a candy store. He can't believe his good 
luck. He thinks he has the third-best job in the United States and he's not too 
sure about the other two. 
</P>
<P>
Does it help or hurt to be a Fan, with a capital F? 
</P>
<P>
"It's essential," he notes positively. "If you don't love baseball, you 
shouldn't be in it." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent is the eighth commissioner of baseball. The first -- and the man 
against whom all others are usually compared -- was Landis. 
</P>
<P>
Did Landis love baseball? There's no evidence Landis loved much of anything. 
It's almost impossible to write Landis' name without the adjective crusty in 
front of it. 
</P>
<P>
Landis was a judge and he ran baseball as if it were a courtroom full of 
pickpockets. He conceived his job to be one of punishing. 
</P>
<P>
And he handed out punishment and fines with will and enthusiasm, coming down on 
owners and players alike, breaking up the St. Louis Cardinals' infamous minor 
league "chain-gang" operation with the same zeal and zest he broke up Standard 
Oil. Kenesaw was an off-with-their-heads commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
When he was gone, baseball went to a backslapping politician. After six years 
of baseball, Happy Chandler was glad to go back to the comparative serenity of 
being governor of Kentucky again. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Frick, the third commissioner, was a newspaperman. So he hardly saw the 
game through a haze of romantic legend. He was Babe Ruth's ghost writer, and 
his chief legacy to the sport was placing an asterisk after Roger Maris' name 
because he broke Ruth's single-season home run record in a season eight games 
longer than Ruth's. Fortunately, he was gone by the time Henry Aaron broke 
Ruth's career record -- so we were spared that blood bath. 
</P>
<P>
William Eckert was the next commissioner, an air transport general they found 
in the far reaches of the Pentagon apparently playing with paper airplanes. New 
York sportswriter Dick Young dubbed him, "the Unknown Soldier," and he was just 
as unknown three years later when he left the job, although he may have made 
the planes run on time. 
</P>
<P>
Bowie Kuhn, a ramrod stiff, formal, inflexible man with a rigid set of values, 
ran the game as if it were a military school and, in a nation in which some 40 
states had lotteries, banned from the game two of its greatest stars -- Willie 
Mays and Mickey Mantle -- for playing customer golf for a casino in Atlantic 
City. Bowie wasn't a fan, he was a drill sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Ueberroth wasn't a fan, either. He was a marketing genius who took the 
most visible loss-leader operation in the history of the world -- the Olympic 
Games -- and promptly made several hundred million dollars off them, showing 
the world what it should have been doing all along. 
</P>
<P>
Peter put baseball in the black, too. He couldn't abide strikes, he thought the 
owners had the view of the world of the German general staff and, before he 
left, he had in place the most lucrative TV and marketing contracts -- in the 
billions of dollars -- the game had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
We never got to know Bart Giamatti. He was a fan -- of the Boston Red Sox. He 
probably had no clear idea who Frank Leja was, either, but he goes down in 
history as the man who kicked Pete Rose out of baseball. That's a little better 
than the man who shot Santa Claus. But not much. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings the game to Fay Vincent. He hardly got the fax machine put in 
before troubles began coming in the windows. He had the Pete Rose mess, the 
game's labor relations were in a shambles, arbitrators had found the owners 
collusive. 
</P>
<P>
Then the World Series was virtually wiped out by an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
And then the owners locked the players out of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Vincent has been there before. A securities-and-exchange 
bureaucrat in Washington, he got called in to head up Columbia pictures after 
the David Begelman scandals -- the studio head had misappropriated company 
funds. He presided over the company through its sale to Coca-Cola, then headed 
the division that bought in TV programs like "Jeopardy" and "Wheel of Fortune." 
He was still there when the studio released "Ishtar." He is no stranger to 
disasters. 
</P>
<P>
Hardly anyone asks him who Frank Leja is -- Leja had 23 at-bats as a Yankee in 
the mid-'50s and with the Angels in '62. No one wants to know if Irv Noren 
played more games in left field than Norm Siebern in 1956 and what year Mantle 
won the Triple Crown. Instead, the conversation veers around to drug control, 
lockouts, arbitration, George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's No. 1 fan gets to talk everything but baseball. Hardly anyone 
cares who Frank Leja was, anymore. The good news, though, is that everyone will 
know who Fay Vincent is.
