OR CICADAS, KILLER BEES, MEDFLIES, FIRE ANTS, APHIDS AND MEAT-EATING YELLOW 
JACKETS. ACROSS THE NATION, BUGS ARE BOOMING.

<P>
Southern Californians who believe that 10 months of Medflies, malathion and 
helicopters have been rough should consider the plight of Big Foot, Ill. Last 
week, millions of sausage-sized bugs called cicadas emerged after 17 years 
underground, covering the town and surrounding countryside in a crunchy carpet 
of wailing insects. 
</P>
<P>
Or how about the poor people of Brownsville, Tex.? There, after years of 
"killer bee" headlines and occasional spottings, the long-feared Africanized 
honey bee finally is to arrive in force this summer. Consider, too, the plight 
of South Lake Tahoe, where the Chamber of Commerce, bracing for an onslaught of 
meat-eating yellow jackets, has distributed kits of poisoned canned fish to 
kill off the pest. 
</P>
<P>
Add to the list munching armies of Mormon crickets in Nevada, fire ants in 
Texas and 11 other states, Medflies in Florida and, back in Los Angeles, the 
worst aphid infestation in a decade, and it all adds up to one creepy-crawly 
year. 
</P>
<P>
There are many reasons. Dry weather in the West, cyclical insect population 
explosions in the Midwest and other entomological mysteries have all 
contributed to this unnerving confluence of bug outbreaks across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
There are few, if any, direct connections between the infestations, but some 
entomologists find common themes in the uncommon outbreaks. For example, they 
say that concerns about pesticide usage have complicated eradication 
strategies. Also, exotic bugs once confined to faraway lands are hitching rides 
into this country, and officials concede that there is no way to keep the gate 
shut tight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a symptom of our times," said Roy Cunningham, a U.S. Department of 
Agriculture entomologist and one of the world's top experts on the Medfly. 
"We're all exchanging our diseases and insects." 
</P>
<P>
He and others said that the sheer variety of this year's outbreaks, coupled 
with a growing public awareness of the costs and effects of the various 
onslaughts, have placed insects in the limelight as never before. 
Entomologists, who once spent entire careers laboring in obscurity in 
bug-filled laboratories, have found themselves thrust into the public arena 
with the livelihoods of farmers and city dwellers hinging on their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, chairman of the scientific panel guiding the Medfly eradication in 
California, said he cannot recall a time when he has been attacked, praised and 
pursued in such a frenzied manner. 
</P>
<P>
"Mother never told me it would be like this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham is one of five scientists advising the state as it attempts to 
eradicate the Medfly from Southern California, perhaps the most visible of 
several such campaigns being waged nationally against various pests. 
</P>
<P>
That the Southland finds itself on the front lines of bug battles is not 
surprising. In the last few years, it has become the nation's unofficial exotic 
pest capital. Three years ago, agricultural officials in California reported 
finding eight different types of exotic fruit flies in Los Angeles and Orange 
counties; the bugs hail from as far away as Pakistan, Thailand and equatorial 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
There was even one fly found that experts still have not been able to identify. 
The only place in the world it has been recorded is Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the final irony in how whacked-out things have become," said Eric Fisher, 
one of the state entomologists in charge of identifying exotic pests. 
</P>
<P>
As entomologists scramble to meet the threats from Medflies, cicadas and the 
like, they have been forced to contend with increasing environmental and health 
concerns. For example, protests against repeated malathion spraying in Southern 
California have spooked state officials to the point where some worry that even 
a single urban pesticide spraying soon will be politically impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Some of science's best weapons against insects, such as DDT, the old backbone 
of mosquito eradication, have been banned for years because of damaging 
environmental effects. Government regulations to protect water and air have 
also restricted the use of chemicals against pests. 
</P>
<P>
"The rules of the game have completely changed," Cunningham said. "We have so 
much more to deal with today." 
</P>
<P>
The concerns about pesticide use and science's increasing understanding of its 
effects have forced officials into a delicate balancing act between the risks 
to agriculture and the public health risks. There are often no clear answers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so much harder today," said UC Davis entomologist Richard Rice, another 
member of the Medfly Science Advisory Panel. "We can't just give up and go back 
to nature, but we also have to be concerned about the health and ecological 
effects. We all wish sometimes for simpler days." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, there seems to 
</P>
<P>
be no shortage of pests. Farmers in 32 states are now operating under federal 
quarantines for various pest infestations. One of the most worrisome pests is 
the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
Since the first introduction of the Medfly to California in 1975, outbreaks 
have come so frequently that scientists are no longer sure if this current 
infestation -- the biggest ever in Southern California -- is a new introduction 
or simply a continuation of past outbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
Entomologists figure that the pest originally was brought into the United 
States by travelers or immigrated in a package of infested fruit from Asia, 
Africa or Central America. Those countries were infested in the same way years 
ago by the Medfly, whose ancestral home is in North Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The state has mounted a $36-million campaign of malathion spraying and sterile 
fly releases to control its spread. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime this summer, the king of the exotic pests -- the tabloid's "killer 
bee" -- is expected to reach the United States after three decades of migrating 
through Latin America. The bee originally was brought from Africa to Brazil in 
the 1950s by a geneticist, hoping to breed a better variety of bee. Instead, 26 
swarms escaped and their progeny have been moving northward ever since. 
</P>
<P>
The bees have been migrating at a pace of about 200 miles a year and last year, 
several swarms were trapped about 150 miles south of Brownsville, located at 
the southern tip of the state. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll be here," said Dan Clair, an entomologist with the Texas Department of 
Agriculture facing a double-barrelled infestation from Africanized honey bees 
and fire ants from Brazil. "There's no way to stop them, really." 
</P>
<P>
Clair said that, like many other exotic pests, the Africanized honey bees have 
been helped in their migration by environments that are more civilized than 
their natural habitats. 
</P>
<P>
"They have evolved in the tough environment of the tropics," he said, "and then 
you put them in Beverly Hills. They just take off." 
</P>
<P>
Clair said the prospect of living with the "killer bee" is not as horrifying as 
the name suggests. While the Africanized bee is more aggressive than others, 
they won't attack unless provoked. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people panicking for no reason," Clair said. "It's just unnecessary. 
That's what worries me." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, there have been cases of lethal attacks by swarms of 
Africanized bees along its migratory route. 
</P>
<P>
Home-grown pest outbreaks can be equally unnerving. One of the biggest bug 
explosions of the year took place last week in southern Wisconsin and northern 
Illinois with the emergence of a bug called the cicada. 
</P>
<P>
The cicada, which can grow in length to 1 1/2 inches, is a black-bodied, 
orange-winged and red-eyed flying creature that lives for 17 years -- the 
longest life span of any known insect. 
</P>
<P>
In one of nature's strangest spectacles, this particular cicada spends almost 
all its life underground, only to emerge at the end for a monthlong orgy of sex 
and egg laying. No cicadas are seen again in the area until another 17 years 
have passed. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been doing it for as long as we can tell," said Ed Arnold, an 
entomologist with the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture. "No one knows why." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the pest is no threat to agriculture. But the male cicadas have a 
loud mating call that in chorus becomes a deafening, buzzing whine. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most maddening thing," Arnold said. "You think there's something 
wrong with your ears. 
</P>
<P>
"They make a pretty good splat on your windshield too," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Given its mysterious life cycle and the brief but intense havoc the bug can 
create when it emerges, newspapers and television stations have been vigorous 
in their coverage of the cicada onslaught. The emergence process was reported 
like an approaching typhoon. The Chicago Sun-Times has even set up a cicada hot 
line, which the newspaper says receives at least 60 calls a day. One 
publication presented cicada recipes (sauteed in butter is popular). 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said no steps are taken to control the cicada, as they pose no threat to 
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the nation, agricultural officials have found themselves facing 
potentially threatening infestations that could take years or even decades to 
eradicate. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the case of the voracious, two-inch-long Mormon cricket, which since 
the beginning of March has been pouring out of the mountains of northeastern 
Nevada in roving bands that stretch as long as 10 miles. The cricket 
infestation is Nevada's largest since the 1930s and now covers about 700,000 
acres. If the infestation continues to grow, Nevada's $66-million hay crop 
could be chewed to pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty years ago, cricket eradication crews stalked the land, dumping a lethal 
mixture of lime and arsenic to kill the pest. It took nearly 15 years before 
the outbreak subsided. This time around, eradication workers have largely 
relied on ground treatment with wheat bran laced with an insecticide called 
carbaryl to kill the bug. 
</P>
<P>
Aerial spraying is less costly and more effective, but federal regulations 
prohibit spraying within 500 feet of water, ruling out the technique in the 
mountain canyons, which are filled with natural springs and streams. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we're just putting out fires," one Nevada official said. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Rowe, a deputy director in the Nevada State Department of Agriculture, 
said the Mormon cricket outbreak probably was caused by four years of drought. 
Rain and cold weather in the spring is usually enough to chop down the number 
of crickets, but this year's mild weather has allowed the bug population to 
explode. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe said eradication workers have been scrambling to keep the bugs off 
Interstate 80 and out of towns, such as Winnemucca, although they pose no 
serious threat to humans. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, people will freak out," Rowe said. "They're long, black and as big 
as your thumb. That's a problem." 
</P>
<P>
While pesticide spraying can wipe out troublesome infestations, it can create 
problems of its own. Kenneth Hagen, professor of entomology at UC Berkeley, 
said some of the worst insect outbreaks he can remember occurred in the 1940s 
and 1950s with the increased use of DDT. 
</P>
<P>
The insecticide killed the pests it was after, but it also killed plenty of 
other varieties, upsetting the delicate ecological systems that naturally 
contain bug populations. 
</P>
<P>
"Those were really spectacular years for outbreaks," Hagen said, recalling the 
hordes of spider mites and aphids that burst across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Entomologists believe that this year's malathion spraying campaign in Southern 
California has had a similar affect in unleashing the region's worst aphid 
infestation in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
They blame the infestation on the absence of lady bugs, lacewings and tiny 
wasps -- aphid predators that have been devastated by malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
UC Riverside entomologist Robert Luck added that there is always the danger 
that increased pesticide spraying will only create a poison-resistant strain of 
super bugs, which in many cases in the past has led to a vicious cycle of more 
and more pesticide use with less and less effect. 
</P>
<P>
"You can expect resistance at some point," he said. "It's probably just a 
matter of time." 
</P>
<P>
Entomologists said that despite the variety of infestations across the country, 
the size and number of outbreaks is nothing to panic about. 
</P>
<P>
"These things come and go," Hagen said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
YEAR OF THE BUGS 
</P>
<P>
Yellow jackets (Vespula pensylvanica and Vespula vulgaris) -- Lake Tahoe is 
bracing for what entomologists expect to be one of the worst yellow jacket 
attacks in years. The South Lake Tahoe Chamber of Commerce has begun passing 
out free bug traps. Locals say it only takes a few days for a swarm of the 
meat-eating bugs to polish off a can of fish. 
</P>
<P>
Mormon cricket (Anabrus simplex) -- 700,000 acres in northeast Nevada have been 
infested with the Mormon cricket, which began pouring out of the mountains in 
March. The bugs can grow to the size of a church mouse and have been roaming 
around Winnemucca and Interstate 80 in bands up to 10 miles long. 
</P>
<P>
Periodical cicada (Magicicada septendecim) -- Southern Wisconsin and northern 
Illinois have been inundated with the once-every-17-year emergence of the 
cicada. The bug can grow to an inch-and-a-half long and fills the area with a 
buzzing whine as it partakes of a monthlong orgy of sex and egg laying. 
</P>
<P>
Red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta) -- The ferocious fire ant, 
originally from South America, has already infested much of the Southeast. In 
the past two years, entomologists have discovered that ant colonies have 
unexpectedly evolved into having multiple queens, leading to far greater insect 
densities. The pest is eventually expected to spread to California. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican fruit fly (Anastrepha ludens) -- If having the Medfly around wasn't bad 
enough, now the Mexfly has struck. The state has begun aerial malathion 
spraying in El Cajon in San Diego County and in Compton. 
</P>
<P>
Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata) -- Outbreaks in Florida and 
California have made the Medfly the most notorious pest in the country this 
year. Only 270 of the tiny flies have been trapped in California in 10 months, 
but at least $36 million has been spent trying to eradicate the bug. 
</P>
<P>
Africanized honeybee (Apis mellifera scutellata) -- Watch out! After years of 
screaming tabloid headlines, the "killer" bee is finally expected to cross into 
the United States this summer somewhere near Brownsville, Tex.

HUD APPROVES FUND BAN FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cities may withhold federal grant money from programs that serve illegal aliens 
without violating anti-discrimination laws, the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development said Thursday in a letter to officials of this Orange County city. 
</P>
<P>
In a long-awaited ruling that could have broad impact on illegal immigrants and 
attempts to regulate them, HUD lawyers agreed that Costa Mesa can deny funds to 
charities and other groups unless they pledge to not knowingly serve illegals. 
</P>
<P>
The city passed such a law last August, but voted to suspend it when federal 
authorities questioned whether it might violate U.S. anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
"In line with our review of the case we do not conclude that the city's 
prohibition on the use of city funds for illegal aliens is in violation of the 
Constitution, or other federal law," wrote HUD general counsel Frank Keating, 
in an opinion addressed to Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach). City 
officials requested the ruling through Cox. 
</P>
<P>
Keating added that federal regulations do not appear to preclude HUD from 
adopting a similar policy agency-wide. 
</P>
<P>
"In discussions on this subject, the question has been raised as to whether HUD 
could, without clearly articulated congressional direction, issue regulations 
which prohibit illegal aliens from receiving bloc grant assistance. In our 
view, HUD may properly and in accord with constitutional principles issue" such 
a regulation, the lawyer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
HUD officials could not be reached for comment on whether such a policy is 
under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrant-rights groups immediately branded the ruling "dangerous" and "sad," 
predicting that it will encourage other cities to adopt restrictive policies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a really backward step," said Evelyn Colon-Becktell, chairwoman of the 
Orange County Coalition for Immigrant Rights. "It's outrageous. Outrageous that 
we would do something like this. I could see this having a ripple effect on 
other cities and it could be really devastating to the immigrant population." 
</P>
<P>
With HUD's ruling, several Costa Mesa City Council members said they will seek 
to have the city's original funding policy reinstituted 
</P>
<P>
"I have asked to have it put on the next council agenda," said Councilman 
Orville Amburgey, who proposed the policy. "I think HUD's decision confirms 
what we have said all along. They quite clearly feel that our policy is valid 
and agree that in this day and age when there is such a demand for funding that 
we should not be disbursing those funds to illegals." 
</P>
<P>
The city's funding policy, believed to be the first of its kind in the state 
and possibly the nation, had attracted national attention and provoked a storm 
of protest from immigrant rights groups and service providers. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the policy predicted that such attempts to drive away illegal 
aliens would radically alter the way nonprofit groups operate. 
</P>
<P>
It was also feared that some groups might discriminate against Latino-looking 
people, rather than set up screening procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Nativo Lopez, director of the Santa Ana immigrant rights group Hermandad 
Mexicana Nacional, pointed out that a recent report by the General Accounting 
Office in Washington found widespread discrimination against undocumented 
workers by employers, who now are obligated, under penalty of sanctions, to 
make sure their employees have legal working papers. 
</P>
<P>
"If employer sanctions can't work, what makes them think that social service 
agencies can do any better a job in ascertaining the legal status of their 
client population?" he asked. "We're going to see discrimination increase 
geometrically. It's a very, very significant ruling." 
</P>
<P>
Colon-Becktell said her coalition will probably hold an emergency meeting of 
its executive board to discuss the ruling's implications. 
</P>
<P>
Many service providers have said they would forgo city funds rather than accept 
terms of the policy if made mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Costa Mesa is dispensing $279,900 in HUD Community Development Bloc 
Grant and general revenue-sharing funds to 35 public service agencies. Groups 
range from the Harbor Area Boys and Girls Club to the Easter Seal Society and 
the South Coast Institute for Applied Gerontology. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't see how we can sign a contract that includes (the policy)," 
said Shirley Cohen, executive director of Feedback Foundation, which provides 
meals to needy seniors in Costa Mesa and other areas of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have conceded that the policy, if reinstated, would be difficult 
to enforce. The original policy did not outline the measures an agency should 
take to ensure it does not serve illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa's law states that the city "will not consent to support individuals 
or agencies who employ, provide assistance to, house, feed, or in any other 
fashion, support illegal aliens." The sole programs exempted were medical and 
dental services.

6 SIS DETECTIVES CLEARED IN SHOOTING OF BANK ROBBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an important legal victory for the Los Angeles Police Department, a federal 
court jury Thursday cleared six undercover detectives of allegations that they 
violated a bank robber's civil rights when they shot her and killed her 
companion after watching the two rob a bank in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated for 2 hours and 45 minutes before finding that the four 
detectives who shot Jane Berry had not used excessive force. The verdict meant 
an automatic dismissal of the case against the two remaining detectives, both 
since retired, who did not participate in the shooting, but supervised the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
All the detectives are members and former members of the LAPD's Special 
Investigations Section, an elite surveillance squad that gathers evidence 
against dangerous criminals by watching them commit crimes and attempts to 
arrest them afterward. The unit, which has killed more than 25 suspects and 
wounded at least 24 others since its inception in 1967, is so clandestine that 
few knew of its existence until a 1988 investigative article by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Berry's $10-million civil case marked the first time members of the unit -- 
which her lawyers have repeatedly referred to as "a death squad" -- have been 
brought to trial as a group. Had she prevailed, Berry would have been able to 
continue her case with a second, wider-ranging phase that named Police Chief 
Daryl F. Gates, Mayor Tom Bradley and other city officials and alleged that the 
very policy that permits the SIS to exist is a violation of civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a verdict in favor of Berry could have cleared the way for others 
to file similar suits. 
</P>
<P>
Berry's lawyers, Stephen and Marion Yagman, have already filed suit on behalf 
of the families of three men who were shot to death by SIS officers after a 
robbery at a McDonald's restaurant in Sunland last February. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll get the death squad in the next case," Marion Yagman said after 
Thursday's verdict. 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant City Atty. Victoria Chaney, who represented the officers, said 
she believed the verdict Thursday "would be a signal to other people that they 
ought to think carefully about filing a lawsuit against police officers who 
place their lives on the line every day in dealing with dangerous criminals." 
</P>
<P>
The officers, who have never been charged with any crime in the shootings, were 
clearly relieved and elated at the outcome of the civil trial. After the 
verdicts were announced at 7 p.m., they hugged one another and shook hands. 
Some even broke the silence they had maintained throughout the two-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
"I was worried if the verdict was different that maybe, in the future, it would 
affect how I work," said Detective Jerry Brooks, his wife at his side. "That 
maybe I would end up taking a second longer and I would end up dead." 
</P>
<P>
Detective Michael Sirk, meanwhile, said he felt the squad had been vindicated, 
although he added he was never worried about its continued existence. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Chief Gates will get rid of the SIS, no matter what lawsuits 
come up," Sirk said. "He has reassured us that we have his backing . . . that 
our jobs are secure no matter which way any decisions go." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the support of their chief, the six SIS detectives -- Brooks and 
Sirk, Rodger Niles, Henry Cadena and retired officers Dale Ostrom and Roger 
Marine -- had plenty of support from their fellow squad members and other 
police officers, who packed the courtroom during closing arguments Thursday. 
According to Chaney, every member of the 19-man SIS unit listened in on some 
portion of the case. 
</P>
<P>
Trial testimony showed that the SIS shadowed Berry and her companion, John 
Crumpton, for 17 days before watching them rob a Security Pacific Bank in 
Burbank on Sept. 15, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Berry's lawyers maintained that police had ample opportunity to arrest Berry 
and Crumpton before the robbery on lesser charges and had, in effect, created a 
situation that was bound to end in gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to physical evidence that showed Berry and Crumpton each sustained 
numerous shotgun pellet wounds -- all to the back -- Stephen Yagman told the 
jury in his closing argument that the officers "ambushed" the two. "They wanted 
to put them out of business forever," Yagman said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers, however, maintained that they acted in self-defense, saying they 
saw Berry reach for her gun and thought -- albeit mistakenly -- that Crumpton 
was also armed. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors said afterward that they sided with the officers because Berry's 
testimony lacked credibility and because the judge had instructed them to 
determine only whether the officers used excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
"There's only one point of the case, and that was the final seconds," said one 
juror who asked not to be named. "That's what the judge told us. That's what we 
went by."

RAIN FORESTS DISAPPEARING 50% QUICKER THAN FEARED 
</P>

<P>
Destruction of the world's tropical forests is occurring nearly 50% faster than 
the best previous scientific estimates showed, with enough trees being lost 
each year to cover the state of Washington, the World Resources Institute said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Between 40 million and 50 million acres are lost annually, according to new 
satellite measurements of vanishing timberland, with the biggest losses 
occurring in Brazil, India, Indonesia, Myanmar (formerly Burma) and Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier estimates by the United Nations and other organizations placed annual 
losses at 28 million acres. But these estimates were based on data gathered 
before 1980, compared to the latest findings, which are based on 1987 data. The 
earlier figures also were obtained largely through less accurate ground 
observations. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's published report marked the first comprehensive picture of worldwide 
deforestation trends based on a compilation of recent studies. 
</P>
<P>
"We were startled, frankly," institute President James Gustave Speth said in a 
telephone interview from Washington. "We're looking at an environmental tragedy 
unfolding. It's much worse than had been previously suspected." 
</P>
<P>
The report, published in collaboration with the United Nations, has disturbing 
implications both for global warming and the extinction of plant and animal 
species, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tropical forests are believed to not only shelter half of the world's plant and 
animal species -- most of them as yet undiscovered -- but serve as a major 
brake on the buildup of carbon dioxide, a principal contributor to global 
warming. 
</P>
<P>
Forests, most prominently in the Third World, are cut down at a rapid pace to 
provide wood for export and fuel, and to clear land for development and 
agriculture. When forests are cleared and burned, huge amounts of the carbon is 
returned to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide gas. Tree burning 
accounts for an estimated 30% of worldwide total carbon dioxide emissions. 
Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gasoline accounts for most of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"If you combine increasing deforestation with the increasing use of fossil 
fuels in the industrial countries . . . it's easy to understand why the 
emissions of greenhouse gases have tripled over a 30-year period," Speth said. 
</P>
<P>
But he also cited reason for optimism, noting that in the last several years 
some nations, notably Brazil and India, have promised to curb the clearing of 
forests. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington said it was 
too early to comment on the new estimates but that the institute's 
deforestation figures were based on "fairly reputable" studies. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Tillier, public affairs officer with the World Bank in Washington, 
agreed. She said the higher deforestation rate was "along the lines" of recent 
estimates by the bank, which finances international development projects. 
</P>
<P>
Allen L. Hammond, editor of the volume, "World Resources, 1990-91," called the 
updated estimate released Thursday conservative. "In countries where we have 
reliable new data, its far worse than 50%. Fifty percent is a world average," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond said most of the estimates were based on data collected by U.S. 
satellites and analyzed by scientists in the countries studied and by outside 
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
The data covers only half of the world's nations that have tropical forests. 
Additional studies are under way, including an update due in 1992 by the U.N. 
Food and Agriculture Organization, whose study released in 1980 was the basis 
for the lower estimates called into question Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond said that when that information is made public, it will, "in fact, show 
even higher rates of deforestation than we're reporting." 
</P>
<P>
Brazil, which has the world's largest remaining tropical forests, also has the 
largest area of annual deforestation. The new studies indicate that Brazil's 
annual losses are between 10 and 20 million acres within the Amazon and 2.5 
million acres outside the Amazon. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, a peak year of deforestation in Brazil, the rate of loss was as much 
as 80% higher than earlier estimates for that country. During that year, Brazil 
caused 1.2 million tons of carbon to be released into the atmosphere, virtually 
the same amount pumped into the air by the much more industrialized United 
States from the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, however, Brazil has taken steps to dramatically reduce the 
destruction, including stepped-up enforcement and the elimination of tax 
incentives that led to large-scale land clearing. 
</P>
<P>
Two days ago, President Fernando Collor de Mello announced that Brazil's armed 
forces were ready to help stop the burning and deforestation of the Amazon rain 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
But progress in Brazil is not expected to change the overall picture because 
deforestation in most other Third World countries appears to be increasing, the 
institute said. 
</P>
<P>
The World Resources Institute's report Thursday noted dramatic upswings in 
other countries' deforestation rates. 
</P>
<P>
In Myanmar, for example, 1.7 million acres are lost each year, "an astounding" 
545% increase over 1980 estimates. The 1980 estimate relied on information 
collected in the mid-1970's and a U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization 
computer model of rural population trends. 
</P>
<P>
The new estimate is based on recent field work, a continuing analysis of aerial 
photographs and satellite data and extrapolations from the U.N. data. 
</P>
<P>
In India, satellite sensing studies point to a 10-fold increase over previous 
estimates to 3.7 million acres a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian deforestation estimate of 2.2 million aces a year is 50% more 
than the 1980 estimate, and Costa Rica's figure rose 90% to 300,000 acres lost 
annually. Only in Thailand are the old and new estimates comparable. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1980s were a decade of devastation for the global environment. In the 
1990s things could either get much, much worse or we could begin to start a 
healing. It all depends on what our governments are willing to do, more than 
anything else," Speth said. He called developments in Brazil encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
The report, published in collaboration with the U.N. Environment Program and 
the U.N. Development Program, also for the first time ranked greenhouse gas 
emissions from 146 countries. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and Soviet Union ranked No. 1 and No. 2, respectively. 
Combined, they accounted for nearly 30% of all greenhouse gas emissions 
worldwide in 1987, followed by Brazil, China, India, Japan, West Germany and 
Great Britain. If the European Community is considered as a single entity, it 
would rank second behind the United States instead of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, the equivalent of 6.5 billion tons of carbon in the form of carbon 
dioxide, methane and chlorofluorocarbons were added to the atmosphere in 1987, 
the report said.

HOMEOWNER'S INSURER MUST PAY IN SEX CASE; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: STATE SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES AGAINST A POLICYHOLDER 
WHO INFECTED HIS GIRLFRIEND WITH GENITAL HERPES. 
</P>

<P>
The state Supreme Court on Thursday let stand a novel ruling allowing a 
homeowner's insurer to be held liable for damages obtained against a 
policyholder accused of infecting his girlfriend with genital herpes. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief order, the justices refused to hear a challenge by State Farm Fire 
&amp; Casualty Co. to a decision issued last March by a state Court of Appeal 
in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the policyholder deliberately tried to transmit the disease, the insurer 
had a duty to defend him in a lawsuit and can be forced to cover the resulting 
damage award, the appellate court held. The ruling, the first of its kind in 
California, becomes binding on trial courts throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
The company, in its appeal to the high court, had called the appellate decision 
"extraordinary" and "radical," and warned that it could expose insurers to 
substantial financial liability in similar cases involving a wide range of 
sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for State Farm, Michael J. Brady of Redwood City, expressed 
disappointment with Thursday's action, observing that policies were intended to 
protect homeowners against more conventional misfortunes -- such as a falling 
tree that damages neighboring property. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems totally bizarre for a homeowner policy to provide coverage for the 
consequences of someone's sexual activities," said Brady. 
</P>
<P>
Larry J. Ince of San Jose, lawyer for the policyholder in the case, said he was 
both "delighted" and "shocked" by the justices' refusal to hear State Farm's 
appeal. "This is a rather conservative group," said Ince, referring to the high 
court's reputed sympathy for insurers and other businesses. "I guess we can 
chalk up one for our side." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers on both sides noted that State Farm and other insurers have begun to 
reword homeowner policies specifically to preclude their liability for the 
results of voluntary sexual conduct. Nonetheless, such claims still may be 
brought -- perhaps in substantial numbers -- under previous policies. 
</P>
<P>
The case before the justices emerged after Carol Greenstreet filed suit in 1986 
in Santa Clara Superior Court against Mark Eddy, charging him with negligently 
infecting her with herpes. According to her suit, Eddy had told Greenstreet he 
had been exposed to herpes, but based on a recent medical exam, he did not 
believe he had the disease and could infect her. Eventually, Greenstreet 
obtained a $298,000 judgment against Eddy. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Eddy turned to State Farm, saying that under his $300,000 
homeowner policy, he was protected against suits for "bodily injury," including 
"sickness or disease." The company must defend him in the suit and pay any 
resulting damages, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The firm went to court, contending it had no such obligation and that it was 
against "public policy" for an insurer to be required to provide coverage for 
the consequences of voluntary sexual intercourse. Holding the company 
responsible under the policy, State Farm argued, would encourage promiscuous 
and reckless sexual conduct. Eddy should be the one to bear the burden for his 
actions, the firm said. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court judge agreed with the company, finding that State Farm could 
not be held responsible for damages against Eddy, but the Court of Appeal 
reversed that decision. Eddy, the policyholder, had claimed he had not expected 
or intended to transmit the disease, and unless the contrary is proven in 
further court proceedings, State Farm may be required to pay damages, the court 
said.

WILSON STRESSES FISCAL RESTRAINT IN NEW TV AD

<P>
Republican Pete Wilson, taking a few jabs at Democratic rival Dianne Feinstein, 
revved up his campaign for governor Thursday with a new television ad 
emphasizing his fiscal conservatism as mayor of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
For the second day in a row, Wilson unveiled a low-key commercial designed to 
acquaint voters with his record and counter the huge amount of publicity 
Feinstein received in winning the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete Wilson, vision and leadership while watching the bottom line," the 
announcer intones before giving Wilson credit for reducing San Diego property 
tax rates in the 1970s and balancing the city's budget. 
</P>
<P>
For Wilson, a U.S. senator who has spent most of the last eight years in 
Washington, the ad represents an effort to remind voters that he once ran a 
city in California and that he hews to the GOP anti-tax line. 
</P>
<P>
While his latest television commercial adopts a positive tone, Wilson had a few 
choice words for Feinstein at a Sacramento luncheon for Republican officials 
and supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein had charged on Wednesday that Wilson was persuaded to run for 
governor by the "Republican big cigars" who wanted to increase their control of 
state government. 
</P>
<P>
But on Thursday, Wilson noted that he has long wanted to be governor, running 
an unsuccessful campaign for the office in 1978. "What hurts my feelings is 
that she doesn't remember my prior effort and how long I've wanted to be 
governor," the senator said. "I have wanted the job for a long time and I want 
it very badly." 
</P>
<P>
Offering Feinstein a bit of "friendly advice," Wilson suggested she steer clear 
of the subject of "big cigars" -- a description that he said might best fit her 
husband, investment banker Richard Blum. Wilson noted that Blum has contributed 
$3 million to her campaign but so far has not identified any of his individual 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know really who it is who is behind the biggest cigar, from whom she 
received the $3 million because Dick refuses to disclose his client list," 
Wilson said. "I think we're entitled to know who is on that client list. 
Somehow, I have difficulty with Dick and Dianne as Mr. and Mrs. Working 
Californian." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson also sought to emphasize Feinstein's alliance with the two top Democrats 
in the Legislature, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown of San Francisco and Senate 
President Pro Tem David A. Roberti of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I would definitely advise her to abandon any references to the old boy network 
as long as she is taking her wisest counsel from Willie Brown and David 
Roberti," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During the luncheon, Wilson praised the GOP's slate of candidates for the 
general election and said he would work for a Republican sweep of all the top 
state offices. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward he told reporters that he was not bothered by the fact that state 
Sen. Marian Bergeson of Newport Beach, the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor, 
opposes abortion. Wilson lists himself as a supporter of abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
"I have differed (on abortion) with two presidents of my own party for whom I 
have enormous respect and affection," he said. "We're not going to agree on 
everything. But we agree on a great deal so I have enormous comfort with 
everybody who is on this ticket." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson also declined to discuss how he would handle the state's current budget 
crisis, saying he did not want to "undercut" fellow Republican Gov. George 
Deukmejian.

MURMURED THANKS IN TORNADO'S WAKE

<P>
A nighttime tornado crumpled the tiny business district of this big-hearted 
town -- but when dawn broke Thursday many of its residents looked around and 
muttered "thank you." 
</P>
<P>
"This town is so lucky. I can't believe nobody died," said Brenda Judd, one of 
the 50 or so businessmen and women applying brooms, buckets and chain saws to 
the wreckage of what had been the center of this Eastern Colorado town of 
1,800. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen people were injured and five hospitalized, one seriously, after the 
tornado paraded almost in a straight line down E Street in the twilight of 
Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Clocks stopped at 8:08 p.m. when the hail and winds built. For a few minutes it 
was exciting fun. Bob Younger and 35 patrons watched the advancing storm from 
the patio of his Southside Pizza Parlor on the far edge of town. 
</P>
<P>
Great sheets of lightning lit the rolling wheat fields for hundreds of miles in 
the plain between Denver and Kansas. Then came a bombardment of hail, some 
pellets almost as big and hard as a cue ball. 
</P>
<P>
The fun stopped when a funnel cloud emerged from the thunderheads above and 
advanced on Limon. At 200 yards, it swung four Union Pacific freight cars off 
their tracks. The patrons at Southside Pizza dashed for the basement. 
</P>
<P>
Some people credited an early warning siren for reducing casualties. Others 
said they never heard the siren over the howl of the wind and the rattle of 
hail. People here, though, are conditioned to be wary of the fierceness of 
storms. 
</P>
<P>
Limon is 80 miles east of Denver on Interstate 70. It is best known for two 
things -- wheat and winter. Here is where iron gates close the freeway during 
blizzards. And Limon is known to countless travelers as a friendly, warm haven 
for the stranded. 
</P>
<P>
But Limon had never seen anything quite like this. 
</P>
<P>
Those without basements rode out the tornado in all variety of makeshift 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Riley, a guest at Limon's Lariat Hotel, piled into a bathtub with two 
other men, and they pulled a mattress over their heads. The changing air 
pressure of the storm pounded their eardrums painfully. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt like somebody just reached down and squeezed your whole body," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The community's grocery store and newspaper were wrecked, the brick walls of 
its bank elbowed over by the tornado. Perhaps 30 businesses in all were 
severely damaged or destroyed -- the little shops that keep a town together, 
the beauty parlor, furniture store, five and dime, City Hall and sheriff's 
station. There were estimates of damage to 25 mobile homes and perhaps 300 
other residences. A number of cars and trucks were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
The tornado was one of several to touch down in rural Eastern Colorado on 
Wednesday from a line of severe thunderstorms that moved across from the 
Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes a human being humble," said Gov. Roy Romer, who toured the area 
Wednesday night and again Thursday. He issued a disaster proclamation and 
police and National Guardsmen closed off the town to outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, though, were those persistent expressions of gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God we're closed on Wednesdays," said the Limon movie theater's owner, 
Larry Steele, broom and dustpan in hand, as he picked up broken glass and 
ceiling tiles, popcorn and paper cups at the badly damaged theater.

LIQUOR LOBBY GETS ITS OWN TAX-HIKE PLAN PAST SENATE

<P>
The Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly approved legislation sponsored by the 
liquor lobby to increase taxes on alcoholic beverages -- but at drastically 
lower levels than those proposed by a November ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the legislation denounced it as an "arrogant" power play by wine, 
beer and hard liquor interests to undercut the so-called "nickel-a-drink" 
initiative and shield the industry from a heavier tax hit. 
</P>
<P>
But supporters in the Senate, although conceding that alcoholic beverage taxes 
are overdue for an increase, said the liquor lobby's plan merely offers voters 
a "fair and reasonable" alternative. 
</P>
<P>
The measure was returned to the Assembly on a 30-4 vote, three more than the 
two-thirds majority required for passage. Its chances in the Assembly -- which 
earlier approved a vastly different version -- are rated as favorable. As a 
proposed constitutional amendment subject to voter approval, the plan is not 
subject to action by Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Under the legislative plan, the per-gallon tax on table wine would increase 
from 1 cent to 20 cents; from 4 cents to 20 cents on beer, and from $2 to $3.30 
on hard liquor. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative, meantime, would hike the tax per gallon to $1.29 cents on wine; 
57 cents on beer, and $8.40 on hard liquor. Representatives of the 
"nickel-a-drink" campaign said the extra tax levy would break down to a nickel 
each on a can of beer, a five-ounce glass of table wine and a one-ounce shot of 
liquor. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, the liquor lobby -- a generous source of campaign contributions to 
members of both parties -- has been a singularly low profile but highly 
influential pressure group in Sacramento with a reputation for seldom losing a 
political fight. 
</P>
<P>
But the notion of offering through the Legislature a plan that would undercut 
the "nickel-a-drink" enterprise angered Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita). 
</P>
<P>
Davis blistered the legislation as an "arrogant attempt on the part of a 
powerful industry that has had their way for decades around here" to head off 
the heavier tax. "We have an obligation to the people who use the initiative 
process not to thwart them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sen. Alfred Alquist (D-San Jose), floor manager of the proposal, 
appealed to the Senate to "give the voters of California a choice in November." 
He called the initiative a "thinly disguised attempt at prohibition." 
</P>
<P>
An estimated $230 million a year would be raised by the legislative proposal 
and would be available for expenditure by the governor and Legislature for 
support of state government operations -- a highly attractive feature, 
especially during tough fiscal times. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative campaign estimates its program would raise $730 million 
annually. The revenue would be earmarked for specific programs such as 
alcoholism treatment and prevention, law enforcement, trauma center services 
and mental health. The money could not be diverted to other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), who ended up voting for the plan, told the 
Senate that the alcoholic beverage industry "saw the handwriting" on the wall 
two years ago after voters approved an initiative imposing hefty new taxes on 
tobacco products and "came up with a proposal of their own" to head off a 
liquor tax initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's good to have a choice," he said of the industry program. "I think 
that is what the people are entitled to." 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors of the alcohol tax initiative recently filed 1.1 million signatures to 
qualify the proposal for the ballot. Both sides expect a costly and fiercely 
fought general election campaign.

If white-collar crime sounds innocuous, consider this: Thieves are making off 
with benefit checks mailed to survivors of World War II concentration camps and 
other victims of Nazi persecution. 
</P>
<P>
The West German Embassy in Buenos Aires receives about 100 complaints of stolen 
checks every week, some from Holocaust survivors who failed to receive 
government checks sent from West Germany, according to embassy spokesman 
Wolfgang Siegel. 
</P>
<P>
And the theft of German immigrants' benefits is but the most grievous aspect of 
the problem, which is reported to be growing in a number of Latin American 
countries and reaching into the U.S. banking system. Thousands of checks are 
stolen every year, involving networks of people who open bank accounts in Miami 
and other U.S. cities, deposit the checks and then clear out the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The check stealing is undermining confidence in a number of postal systems, 
including those in Argentina and Peru, and it is prompting a widespread flight 
to alternative, private carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Argentina are mounting a major campaign to deal with the 
problem, which has worsened over the last several years. Postal authorities 
from around the Americas, including the United States, are joining forces to 
try to stamp it out. 
</P>
<P>
Omar Ramseyer, chief of postal inspections in Argentina, said it is not clear 
whether the checks disappear in the Argentine postal system or while en route 
to his country. He said the problem demands greater international cooperation, 
particularly from the United States, because "95% of the stolen checks end up 
in banks in Miami." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas L. Holladay, the U.S. consul general in Buenos Aires, takes sworn 
statements from five to 10 people per day who report their checks stolen -- 
down from a peak of 20 per day before U.S. officials began sending checks 
through a private carrier. 
</P>
<P>
"Of most concern to the United States," Holladay said, "is white-collar crime 
involving people who open bank accounts, playing the role of Latin potentate, 
load the account with fraudulent checks and then walk." 
</P>
<P>
He said the average stolen check is for about $300, "but I handled one 
yesterday that was for $19,000." 
</P>
<P>
Argentina, a nation full of European immigrants, is particularly susceptible to 
such financial fraud. Many people receive pensions or other payments from 
governments or relatives abroad. Also, the economic crisis and the tendency 
toward tax evasion encourage Argentines to send money abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, the fraudulent bank account holders withdraw money at infrequent 
intervals in an effort to discourage scrutiny. But Holladay said one Florida 
bank official reacted to his warning of potential bad accounts by telling him 
that one account was $350,000 in the red and that the holder disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Ramseyer said thieves in the post office steal and sell the checks for about 
20% of face value to middlemen, who slip the checks into the financial system 
or deposit them abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Check theft takes frustratingly imaginative forms. Sometimes, whole bags of 
mail are stolen, or a postman is robbed or bribed, or a mail truck is hijacked. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest variation, Ramseyer said, thieves persuade a postal employee to 
"rent" them a bag of mail for 24 hours. Postal workers are paid only $100 to 
$150 a month, and they are usually amenable to such "loans." The thieves sift 
through the bag, taking what they want, and then return it. 
</P>
<P>
Ramseyer has placed more inspectors at airports and increased surprise raids on 
suspected departments. But Argentina's courts and legal system conspire against 
the inspectors. No one is ever jailed for a postal offense, and few are 
convicted.

DIPLOMACY: BAKER AND OTHER NATO FOREIGN MINISTERS MOVE TO REASSURE MOSCOW ON 
THE GERMAN UNIFICATION ISSUE.

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III promised the Soviet Union on Thursday 
that it "will not be left out of the new Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Baker and other foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 
meeting at this cold and wind-swept Scottish seaside resort, appeared to make a 
concerted effort to reassure Moscow that a unifed Germany in NATO will not 
threaten Soviet security. 
</P>
<P>
"NATO can not only prevent war but can also build peace," said Baker. "And the 
way to build peace is to reassure the Central and Eastern Europeans and the 
Soviets that they will not be left out of the new Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Baker suggested that the 16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization could 
"reach out to all of Europe, including neutral and nonaligned nations." 
</P>
<P>
Baker's remarks were delivered to the closed NATO meeting but were made public 
later by the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
His comments were an implied response to a suggestion from Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the Washington summit that a formal NATO-Warsaw Pact 
agreement might soften Soviet objections to NATO membership for a reunified 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official said later that some of the NATO foreign 
ministers are intrigued by Gorbachev's proposal while others are "more cautious 
because they are concerned about an agreement with a pact that is experiencing 
its own difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Gianni de Michaelis reported that Baker and West 
German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher are optimistic that "the role of 
a united Germany in NATO will not be a problem in negotiations with the Soviet 
Union." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "The question is not whether a united Germany will belong to NATO but 
to what kind of NATO a united Germany will belong." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, U.S. officials were disconcerted by news agency reports from 
Moscow that Gorbachev, addressing a Warsaw Pact summit meeting, revived an 
earlier Soviet suggestion that Germany should belong to both blocs. The U.S. 
officials said the Soviets had seemed to have abandoned that idea. 
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official said that the climate for German unification seems to be 
improved as a result of the summit and Baker's meeting with Soviet Foreign 
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Copenhagen on Tuesday, but "the Soviets seem 
to move back and forth of some of these issues." 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the West should meet Moscow's legitimate security concerns, but he 
warned that the Soviets could isolate themselves from the rest of the world if 
they continue to resist the idea of German unification. 
</P>
<P>
"In this event, their approach would put them in conflict with most European 
governments," he said. 
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner, in opening the two-day session designed 
to prepare for the NATO summit next month, declared that a united Germany 
firmly anchored in NATO would aid the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"In such circumstances," said Woerner, a former West German defense minister, 
"the Soviet Union has everything to gain: peace, security, stability and 
genuine partnership." 
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in a brief appearance before flying 
to Moscow to visit Gorbachev, called for more emphasis on NATO's political role 
to make it "easier for the Soviet Union to come to terms with NATO's continued 
existence and German membership." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher told the ministers: 
</P>
<P>
"The message I shall take is that NATO flourishes and will continue to do so, 
not as an alliance against anyone . . . but as an alliance for freedom, justice 
and democracy, values which are now ever more widely accepted across Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Genscher also pressed the theme that the Soviet Union should not be allowed to 
feel isolated. 
</P>
<P>
"In all aspects," he said, "the legitimate security interests of the Soviet 
Union must be respected." 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, he said, the West German and East German parliaments on June 
21 will make separate declarations based on the same text, recognizing the 
present border with Poland. 
</P>
<P>
The hedging on the part of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl earlier this year 
to declare the postwar border final was a source of anxiety to the Poles and a 
concern to the Soviets. Kohl later declared that the border was not subject to 
change. 
</P>
<P>
In her speech, Thatcher said that NATO's defense will continue to "require 
nuclear weapons in Europe, which will be kept up-to-date." 
</P>
<P>
Genscher's aides, however, emphasized his desire to cut down on the kinds and 
number of nuclear weapons based in Europe -- and privately indicated they would 
not welcome any new air-launched missiles that the Americans wish to deploy at 
bases in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the alliance will not decide on whether to deploy such 
missiles until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
However, in his statement to the meeting, Baker said, "We want to share the 
nuclear risk as widely among the alliance as possible." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said privately that the comment was an oblique reference to 
keeping at least some nuclear weapons in Germany.

CANADIAN CONSTITUTION TALKS NEAR BREAKDOWN

Key talks on reshaping the Canadian constitution were on the brink of collapse 
at the end of a marathon session Thursday, as Quebec's provincial Premier 
Robert Bourassa announced that he would no longer participate in any discussion 
of Quebec's "distinct" role within the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called distinct-society constitutional clause has been a central element 
of this week's talks, and it is hard to see how the other negotiators can 
proceed without Bourassa. 
</P>
<P>
The question has been settled, as far as Quebec is concerned, Bourassa said. 
But the premiers of Manitoba and Newfoundland are objecting to the "distinct 
society" provision for Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting pretty close to having to fish or cut bait," said Prime Minister 
Brian Mulroney, who is chairing the negotiations, as he emerged at the end of a 
12-hour session. "What is at stake here is the well-being of Canada." 
</P>
<P>
Debate over the national constitution has dragged on for months,confusing the 
public, dividing the country into federalist and separatists camps and 
radicalizing public opinion in the French-speaking province of Quebec. Analysts 
now say that, no matter what comes out of this week's negotiations, the wounds 
inflicted by the debate have been so deep that relations between French and 
English Canada cannot go back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
This week's problem has arisen because Quebec has never signed the Canadian 
constitution, citing a number of objections. The current round of talks was 
just the latest in a three-year series of negotiations aimed at bringing the 
province into the constitutional fold. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Canada's 10 all-powerful provincial premiers had crafted a package of 
amendments meant to solve Quebec's objections to the constitution. The package 
is called the Meech Lake accord, named for the lakeside resort where it was 
negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
A crucial passage of the Meech Lake accord labels Quebec as a "distinct 
society" within Canada. Quebec says the clause must be inserted before it will 
sign the constitution. But Manitoba and Newfoundland argue that if Quebec 
leaders might use the special powers to enact provincial laws trampling on the 
rights of Quebec's minority English speakers. 
</P>
<P>
Their fears are not unfounded. Quebec has already enacted laws banning street 
signs in any language other than French, and the Montreal school board is 
considering regulations forbidding Anglophone children to speak English at 
school -- even while playing. 
</P>
<P>
As Prime Minister Mulroney and the 10 provincial premiers walked out of 
Thursday's session, they vowed that they would return to the table this morning 
and try to patch up their differences. But it was difficult to see what they 
could do to bridge the gap. To make matters worse, the law says the Meech Lake 
accord must be ratified by June 23, or else it will become void and 
constitutional negotiations will have to start over.

Here are some major political developments in South Africa during the four-year 
state of emergency: 
</P>
<P>
June 12, 1986 -- President Pieter W. Botha imposes the emergency amid growing 
black unrest that has left hundreds dead. Within days, thousands of activists 
are detained without trial. 
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress begins an urban bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
July 1, 1986 -- The government repeals Pass Laws, which required blacks to have 
an identity document and permission to be in white areas. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 24, 1988 -- The government effectively bans 17 opposition groups, 
including the United Democratic Front, the largest legal anti-apartheid 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
January, 1989 -- About 1,000 detainees go on a hunger strike demanding to be 
put on trial or released. Hundreds are released over a period of several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 18, 1989 -- President Botha suffers a stroke. Frederik W. de Klerk becomes 
heir apparent. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 14, 1989 -- After disputes with his Cabinet, Botha resigns. De Klerk 
assumes power. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 6, 1989 -- De Klerk's National Party wins white parliamentary elections. 
De Klerk launches a series of reforms such as allowing peaceful demonstrations 
and opening segregated beaches to all races. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 15, 1989 -- Six ANC leaders imprisoned for more than 25 years, including 
Walter Sisulu, are released. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 2, 1990: De Klerk legalizes the ANC and more than 60 additional opposition 
groups, suspends the death penalty, eases emergency restrictions, announces 
that ANC leader Nelson Mandela will be released shortly. 
</P>

Feb. 11 -- Mandela is freed after more than 27 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
May 2-4: The ANC and the government hold their first talks. They agree to work 
together to end violence and negotiate a new constitution that would end white 
domination and bring blacks into the national government. 
</P>
<P>
June 7 -- De Klerk announces end of state of emergency except in Natal.

The United States welcomed South Africa's decision Thursday to lift emergency 
rule in most areas but said it still has not fulfilled the conditions necessary 
for Washington to lift economic sanctions against the white-minority 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"This is another significant step towards creating a climate conducive for 
negotiations that will lead to a democratic, nonracial South Africa," the White 
House said in a statement issued aboard President Bush's aircraft as he flew to 
a speaking engagement in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, spokesman Richard Boucher noted that the steps were 
not enough under U.S. law for the Bush Administration to ask Congress to lift 
sanctions against South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"The conditions laid down in the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 must 
be met before we can suspend or modify the sanctions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Specifically now, we'll have to look at the legal implications of continuing 
the state of emergency in Natal. The law also requires that all political 
prisoners must be released and this has not yet happened." 
</P>
<P>
Boucher said it is clear that Pretoria's moves in recent months, particularly 
the release of black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela and the unbanning of the 
African National Congress, have transformed the situation. 
</P>
<P>
He said the government has now met most ANC conditions to open negotiations on 
a political settlement for South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Randall Robinson, director of the black American lobby TransAfrica, said U.S. 
sanctions must stay in place until there is irreversible progress toward 
dismantling apartheid, South Africa's system of racial separation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tiny measure and a little late, considering the distance that must 
be traveled," Robinson said, adding that De Klerk's announcement is little more 
than a public relations ploy aimed at ending U.S. sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said that as long as 2,000 to 3,000 political prisoners remain in 
South African jails, political trials continue and repressive legislation 
remains in force, there can be little change. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said: "Retention of the current sanctions is 
the best guarantee that progress will continue toward the goal of a free and 
democratic Africa."

FBI ARRESTS EX-G.I. CHARGED WITH SPYING FOR EAST BLOC;

SECRETS TO HUNGARIAN AND CZECHOSLOVAK AGENTS.

<P>
FBI agents in Tampa, Fla., arrested a former Army sergeant Thursday night on 
charges of taking part in an espionage ring found to have "endangered the 
entire defense capability of the West" by selling secrets to Hungarian and 
Czechoslovakian agents. 
</P>
<P>
Roderick James Ramsay, 28, was charged with gathering or delivering what FBI 
Director William S. Sessions described as "extremely sensitive" information to 
a foreign government while serving in West Germany between 1983 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Ramsay was allegedly recruited by then-Army Sgt. Clyde Lee Conrad, who paid him 
$20,000 to videotape highly classified documents, including North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization defense plans for Central Europe. The documents were then 
sold to Eastern Bloc agents. 
</P>
<P>
A West German court convicted Conrad on Wednesday of high treason and sentenced 
the 43-year-old retired sergeant to life in prison for what the chief 
prosecutor said was a case of treason unprecedented in its seriousness. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials said that the investigation is likely to result in further 
arrests of other former U.S. soldiers. Sessions described the inquiry as one of 
the "most complicated foreign counterintelligence investigations ever conducted 
by the FBI." 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the espionage charge, Ramsay could be sentenced to life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
The secrets allegedly sold by the Army sergeants were so detailed that in the 
event of an East Bloc attack, Western defenses in Germany would have collapsed 
before they could have formed, according to the West German judge who presided 
over Conrad's trial. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad, who was Ramsay's superior, is believed to have been paid more than $1.2 
million by East Bloc agents for nuclear and conventional battle plans that he 
provided them between 1976 and 1988, three years after he retired with an 
honorable discharge. 
</P>
<P>
The two U.S. sergeants worked together as clerks with top-secret clearances in 
the archives of the Army's 8th Infantry Division in Bad Kreuznach, West 
Germany. They handled all classified government and military documents in the 
unit's planning section. 
</P>
<P>
Among the documents Ramsay allegedly provided to Conrad were some dealing with 
the use of tactical nuclear weapons by the United States and its NATO allies. 
Other documents detailed secret military communications technology, according 
to an FBI affidavit in the case. 
</P>
<P>
In one weeklong incident around December, 1985, Ramsay is alleged to have 
videotaped hundreds of documents and made those tapes available to Conrad for 
sale to Hungarian and Czechoslovak intelligence services. 
</P>
<P>
Later, after the two had left the Army, Conrad allegedly gave Ramsay a cow bell 
to use as a signal to identify himself to others involved in the espionage 
ring, according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been no case of treason even remotely comparable in its 
seriousness," chief West German federal prosecutor Kurt Remann said last week 
in summing up the Conrad case -- the first espionage trial of a foreign 
resident living in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the life sentence for Conrad, the West German court ordered the 
forfeiture of approximately $1.7 million and the seizure of all his personal 
property. Authorities have not recovered money that they believe he was paid 
for spying. In sentencing Conrad, Justice Ferdinand Schuth described the 
white-haired defendant as "ice cold and unscrupulous," adding that he was 
motivated by "pure greed." It was Schuth who described the spy ring as having 
endangered the security of the West. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad was arrested by West German authorities in August, 1988, in the West 
German city of Kaiserslautern, near Bad Kreuznach, where he lived with his 
German-born wife and 15-year-old son. The area is about 50 miles southwest of 
Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1989, while Conrad was awaiting trial, U.S. officials said that as 
many as five retired American soldiers were under investigation on suspicion of 
assisting the retired sergeant in the espionage. All of them had returned to 
the United States, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad's contact with Hungarian agents was made in 1975 through his 
then-superior, former U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Zoltan Szabo, who himself was 
convicted of spying by an Austrian court last year. Szabo, who received a 
10-month suspended sentence, cooperated in the prosecution of Conrad by 
providing evidence against him. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad's two Hungarian contacts, brothers Imre and Sandor Kercsik, were 
arrested at the same time as Conrad. They were taken into custody in 
Gothenburg, Sweden, where they worked as physicians. The Kercsiks, who admitted 
being agents of the Hungarian secret police, were convicted of possessing NATO 
defense material. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual twist in the Conrad case, he was found to have posed as a 
Hungarian intelligence agent to obtain $50,000 from the CIA for information 
about a purported U.S. Army spy ring working for the Hungarians, according to 
U.S. officials.

EMERGENCY POWERS IN SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many powers granted to police under emergency regulations already existed in 
security laws. However, the emergency decree bypassed the courts and granted 
police indemnity from prosecution for any action they took "in good faith." 
</P>
<P>
As of midnight tonight, under the orders of President Frederik W. de Klerk, the 
powers remain in effect only in Natal province. The most important emergency 
powers given to police and soldiers were: 
</P>
<P>
The right to detain any person indefinitely without charge. 
</P>
<P>
The right to search any place and seize any item. 
</P>
<P>
The right to enter, close or monitor schools. 
</P>
<P>
The right to prohibit, halt or restrict any gathering. 
</P>
<P>
The right to bar reporters from the scenes of unrest or police action and 
limitations on what could be published or screened about police action. 
</P>
<P>
The right to outlaw any organization or to limit its activities. 
</P>
<P>
The right to restrict any person's right to work, travel, write or speak in 
public. 
</P>
<P>
A ban on "subversive statements," widely defined to mean any encouragement to 
strike, boycott, protest or demonstrate and any statement likely to embarrass 
the police or the government. 
</P>
<P>
The right to seize an edition of any publication or to close down any newspaper 
or magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Indemnity for police officers and soldiers from criminal or civil prosecution 
for any damage, injury or death caused by action under the emergency rules.

Haiti will hold its first free elections in 186 years by October and the voting 
will be supervised by international observers, the electoral council announced. 
</P>
<P>
Council President Jean-Robert Sabalat said the exact date will be announced 
next week. Balloting will be held for local offices, seats in Parliament and 
for the presidency, he added. Seventeen candidates have already announced for 
the presidency. Haiti, the first republic of former slaves, gained independence 
from France in 1804 and has since been governed mostly by repressive military 
rulers.

PLO REBUFFS U.S., WON'T EXPEL GUERRILLA CHIEF ABBAS; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: THE GROUP ALSO REFUSES TO DENOUNCE THE RAID ON ISRAELI BEACHES. IT 
ACCUSES WASHINGTON OF TRYING TO SEVER DIALOGUE.

<TEXT>
<P>
A defiant Palestine Liberation Organization declined Thursday to take immediate 
action to expel guerrilla leader Abul Abbas or to condemn his abortive raid 
last week on crowded Israeli beaches, instead accusing the United States of 
using the raid as a pretext to sever its dialogue with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO Executive Committee, concluding three days of closed meetings in 
Baghdad, Iraq, left the door open for U.S. suspension of the dialogue by 
failing to meet U.S. demands that it denounce the raid and eject Abbas from his 
seat on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
PLO sources said the executive leadership is facing pressure from increasingly 
restive radical factions who applauded the attack, which Israel thwarted by 
killing four of the raiders and capturing 12. No Israelis were injured. 
</P>
<P>
The leadership elected to remain silent and leave the next move to Washington, 
expecting that the United States will find it in its own interest to continue 
its dialogue with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not going to be any other response to the situation," said one PLO 
official, who asked not to be identified by name. "The PLO cannot appear to be 
dictated to, even by a superpower like the United States, because that would 
weaken the PLO in the eyes of the Palestinians and all the Arab world. We don't 
interfere with how the U.S. addresses its internal affairs, and we expect the 
U.S. will not interfere in our internal affairs." 
</P>
<P>
Washington is likely to make a decision soon on the dialogue, weighing the 
PLO's response along with an investigation now under way to determine the 
precise circumstances of the raid. The PLO, while denying any advance knowledge 
of the attack, insists nonetheless that it fell within guidelines for its 
continued "armed struggle" against Israel and did not constitute a terrorist 
attack against civilians. 
</P>
<P>
The attack has nonetheless threatened U.S.-PLO relations because it is the 
first incident since the December, 1988, inception of the dialogue that 
required such obvious intensive preparation and planning. It was also the first 
for which a member of the PLO's Executive Committee -- the head of the 
Palestine Liberation Front faction -- claimed responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials had hoped that the Executive Committee, if not moving to expel 
Abbas outright, would at least move to suspend him or publicly refer the matter 
to the full Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament in exile. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Washington is facing a precarious diplomatic dilemma. It can punish the 
PLO's silence by breaking off the dialogue, running the risk of encouraging 
more terrorist incidents and derailing any immediate prospect for peace in the 
region. Or it can remain silent and be seen as condoning terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, 30 U.S. senators called on the Bush Administration to reconsider 
the dialogue, and three senators sponsored a similar resolution Wednesday. 
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) insisted that the PLO has to condemn 
the raid in order for a dialogue to continue. "If you wish to conduct a 
dialogue, your opposition to terrorism must be real, as well as rhetorical," he 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
But PLO sources said the Palestinian leadership risked alienating an 
increasingly radical popular sentiment within the Palestinian community if it 
moved harshly and publicly against Abbas. The statement issued in Baghdad 
discouraged the issue by turning the tables and pointing an accusing finger at 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"The committee discussed the fact that certain American circles hinted about 
pressures to stop the American-Palestinian dialogue . . . and affirmed that 
such stands represent a blow to the peace endeavors and constitute collusion 
meant to conceal the Israeli continuation of crimes and massacres against the 
Palestinian people. . . ," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier statement issued in Tunis, Tunisia, the PLO said the Abbas 
operation was "premeditatively seized as a cover for stopping the dialogue 
(and) renouncing the international responsibility the U.S. bears toward the 
political settlement. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Jamal Hillal, head of the PLO Information Bureau in Tunis, said there is strong 
feeling within the organization that the United States is using the Abbas raid 
as a pretext to renege on progress made during the dialogue and to return to an 
assumption that the most Palestinians can hope for is some form of limited 
autonomy in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"They're using this operation by the PLF to close the dialogue and return to 
the old policy of Camp David and label the PLO as a terrorist organization, 
which puts us all back to square one," he complained, and continued: 
</P>
<P>
"It reflects a general lack of commitment to the dialogue and an uneven policy, 
where they expect the PLO to acknowledge the right of Israel to exist within 
secure borders and all the other things, but without asking anything from the 
Israeli side. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel the Americans are serious, really, about the issues, and the 
area is getting nearer and nearer to the edge of an explosion." 
</P>
<P>
There has been no official meeting since last summer between PLO 
representatives and the designated American representative, Robert H. 
Pelletreau Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, but PLO officials argue that 
there is a strong chance that the United States will continue the dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. did not open the dialogue because it likes the PLO, or likes the 
color of our eyes," said one. "It's because it is in the interest of the United 
States to play a role in settling this conflict." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Arab nations formed the Palestine Liberation Organization in May, 1964, to 
press for a Palestinian homeland. It has many factions, ranging from the 
dominant, moderate Fatah led by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat to radical Marxist 
guerrillas. Israel refuses to talk to the PLO, denouncing it as a terrorist 
group. But Washington began a dialogue in December, 1988, after Arafat 
renounced terrorism and agreed in a U.N. speech to recognize Israel.

N.Y. STRIFE CAPTURES MINORITY INTEREST

Blacks and members of other minority groups paid more attention to articles 
about racial tensions in New York City than any other news story in the last 
month, and most believe that the press has done a mediocre job at best of 
covering the issue, according to a monthly survey by the Times Mirror Co. 
</P>
<P>
Among nonwhites, 38% said that they were "very closely" following accounts of 
the New York trial of two young white men convicted of charges related to the 
killing of a black teen-ager in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn and of the 
boycott of Korean-owned stores in Brooklyn by some blacks. Only 13% of whites 
said that they were giving those stories "very close" attention. 
</P>
<P>
The racial disparity in how much attention those stories received was a 
departure from the usual pattern that has been found by the Times Mirror News 
Interest Index. The monthly survey about which news stories people follow 
generally has found that interest in news breaks down along lines of income and 
age, but not of race. 
</P>
<P>
Those who were paying close attention to coverage of the tensions in New York 
indicated unhappiness with the press. Only 7% said that they thought the 
coverage was excellent -- usually about one-quarter of respondents give an 
excellent rating to news coverage they are interested in -- and 58% said that 
the coverage was only "fair" or "poor." 
</P>
<P>
In New York itself, press coverage of racial tensions has been highly 
controversial. Both blacks and whites attending the Bensonhurst trial shouted 
epithets at reporters and photographers, and some photographers were injured in 
melees after the verdicts were announced last month. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, in a month when no single news story captured an overwhelming amount 
of public interest, the Bush-Gorbachev summit was the story cited by more 
people than any other as the one they were paying attention to, with 38% of 
those polled saying that they were following it "very closely." That was about 
the same percentage as said they were "very closely" following news coverage of 
the presidential election in 1988 or the Navy's escort of oil tankers in the 
Persian Gulf in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
As is usually the case, older people and those with more education -- core 
readers for most major newspapers -- were more likely to say that they were 
paying close attention to the summit than others. 
</P>
<P>
Among people under 30 who were polled, more said that they were paying very 
close attention to reports of floods in the Southwest (29%) than the summit 
(26%). 
</P>
<P>
However, asked what the "most important" news story of the last month had been, 
roughly 50% of those who had an opinion named the summit, whether or not they 
were paying attention to it. The remaining respondents split, with no more than 
a handful specifying any other story. 
</P>
<P>
Times Mirror Co., which conducts the survey every month, owns several 
newspapers and magazines, including The Times.

7,000 HATE CRIMES ON GAYS REPORTED IN '89; 
</P>
<P>
BIGOTRY: THE TOTAL REFLECTS A SLIGHT DECLINE FROM 1988. CALIFORNIA RANKS FIRST

<P>
More than 7,000 hate crimes against homosexuals were reported last year in the 
nation, according to a report released Thursday by the National Gay and Lesbian 
Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
California ranked first in reported incidents of physical assaults. 
</P>
<P>
The finding of "widespread anti-gay violence and victimization" was based on 
formal but unscientific surveys of 119 gay-community organizations in 40 
states. 
</P>
<P>
Incidents included, for example, the beating of a homosexual man in Kentucky by 
two men with tire irons. The victim was then locked in the trunk of a car with 
a live snapping turtle as the two tried to set the vehicle on fire. The man 
suffered permanent brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
The report also noted an incident near Yosemite National Park, where three 
teen-agers in a car shouted slurs and hurled beer bottles at a car with gay men 
inside, forcing their car into a guard rail near a cliff. In another incident, 
a high school student from Greensboro, N.C., suffered a broken arm when his 
parents beat him after finding gay literature in his room. 
</P>
<P>
The 7,031 reported incidents included 62 murders and 4,709 threats. The overall 
total reflected a slight decline from 1988, when the group documented about 
7,200 such incidents. The task force emphasized that the study provides only a 
sense of the magnitude of the problem and that the real numbers likely are 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 563 anti-gay incidents reported in California, 198 were categorized as 
physical assaults -- by far the highest total. The state with the next highest 
number of physical assaults was New York with 103, followed by Illinois with 
82. 
</P>
<P>
The highest number of reports of all categories of incidents, including 
violence, vandalism and harassment came from North Carolina with 1,204 cases 
and Texas with 997. 
</P>
<P>
"Although we have made remarkable strides . . . we remain a community under 
siege, battling an epidemic of bigotry and violence," said Kevin Berrill, 
author of the report. 
</P>
<P>
The correlation between fear of AIDS and attacks on gays continued in 1989, 
with perpetrators citing AIDS during their attacks. About 15% of all reported 
incidents in 1989 were "AIDS-related," the report found. 
</P>
<P>
About 19% of all the reported incidents occurred on college campuses. They 
included physical attacks on UCLA lesbian sorority members and protests of a 
gay-rights meeting at Fresno State University campus in which people in Ku Klux 
Klan-style robes bore signs that said "queers go home." 
</P>
<P>
The group's report comes amid unprecedented federal and state government 
efforts to document the level of hate-crime activity against homosexuals and 
religious, racial and ethnic minorities. 
</P>
<P>
On April 23, President Bush signed into law the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, 
which requires the federal government to collect data on such crimes. 
Twenty-two states have hate-crime laws, but 13 of those exclude gay-related 
incidents. California includes anti-gay crimes in its hate-crime law. 
</P>
<P>
"The more we bring these crimes to light, the less they will be tolerated," 
said Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who called assaults on gays "attacks on all 
our constitutional rights." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Lieberman, associate director of the Anti-Defamation League in 
Washington, D.C., emphasized that the goal of hate-crimes activists is to 
convince state and local law authorities "that these crimes are not pranks, 
that they will be reported to the police and that they will be treated 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Berrill contended that the public not only accepts but even embraces 
gay-bashing. He cited as an example the boast of Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corp. Director William Seidman, who said that his forcefulness would make 
"Attila the Hun look like a faggot." 
</P>
<P>
Considering such attitudes, said Berrill, "it should come as no surprise that 
anti-gay attacks are widespread."

Legislation that would increase income taxes on the wealthy and use the higher 
revenues to subsidize Social Security taxes paid by the middle class was 
approved by the Assembly. The bill by Assemblyman Johan Klehs (D-San Leandro) 
would increase the state income tax rate to 14.3% from 9.3% on income exceeding 
$110,000 for single people and $220,000 for married couples. 
</P>
<P>
The change would raise about $2.1 billion a year that would be used to 
establish a 10% tax credit on Social Security taxes state residents pay to the 
federal government. The bill was sent to the Senate but has little chance of 
being enacted this year because Gov. George Deukmejian has said he will oppose 
any attempt to increase general taxes.

The body of a 65-year-old man, missing since his 71-year-old wife was fatally 
wounded in the parking lot of an Alpha Beta market in Ontario over the weekend, 
was found hidden under overgrown trees fronting the Pomona Freeway, Riverside 
police said. The victim, Hubert Farley, was discovered by detectives searching 
on foot. Investigators believe that Farley was kidnaped when his wife, Lula 
Mae, was shot several times with a semiautomatic handgun while collecting 
aluminum cans for recycling.

Three Republican lawmakers said they would oppose GOP efforts to slash state 
spending on abortions for poor women. State Sen. Rebecca Morgan of Los Altos 
Hills, along with Assemblyman Charles Quackenbush of Santa Clara and Escondido 
Assemblywoman Tricia Hunter, said it was illegal to cut funding for Medi-Cal 
abortions and costly to defend the action in court. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Legislature again defied the Supreme Court and refused to pay 
for Medi-Cal abortions unless the mother was a victim of rape or incest, her 
life was in danger, or the fetus was severely abnormal. A Republican 
anti-abortion bloc and a handful of Democrats have cut funding for Medi-Cal 
abortions every year since 1978, but the state Supreme Court has ordered the 
money restored each time.

Protesters launched Redwood Summer at the Port of Sacramento with a small but 
spirited demonstration aimed at the over-harvesting of timber and the cutting 
of old-growth redwoods. The anti-logging activists had planned to interfere 
with loading of logs aboard a ship bound for Japan, but the vessel sailed a day

A 127-pound orangutan escaped from its cage by unscrewing four large bolts. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors at the Kansas City Zoo's Great Ape House screamed, but no one was hurt 
during the animal's brief dash to freedom Wednesday, zoo officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got all these women pushing kids in strollers trying to get out of 
there," said Beth Cooper, who was in the building with her husband and two 
toddlers. "It was kind of funny." 
</P>
<P>
The zoo's public relations director, Jori Glazer, said no one was injured and 
the female orangutan, named Cheyenne, was only out of her glass cage about 20 
minutes.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGN

The race: Governor. Whose ad: Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to keep his name before the voters now that the primary election 
is over, Sen. Pete Wilson unveiled a second ad in as many days. 
</P>
<P>
This commercial emphasizes his fiscal record as mayor of San Diego between 1971 
and 1982, in a subtle attempt to set himself apart from Democratic rival Dianne 
Feinstein, the former mayor of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Elements of the ad, with analysis by Times staff writer Richard C. Paddock. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: An announcer says, "As mayor of San Diego, he brought the first light-rail, 
mass-transit system to California." Wilson then says, "We built it on time, 
under budget and without federal funds." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Wilson initially was reluctant to support the trolley running from 
downtown San Diego to the border but ultimately was persuaded by its backers to 
get on board. Federal funds were not needed because the state picked up the 
tab. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: "Pete Wilson is the only candidate for governor who has balanced 11 
straight budgets without raising taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: By law, both San Diego and San Francisco are required to balance 
their budgets. As mayor of San Diego, Wilson presided over 11 balanced budgets. 
As mayor of San Francisco, Feinstein presided over nine balanced budgets. 
However Feinstein, in her last year as mayor, left behind what her successor 
projected would be a $174.2 million shortfall.

MEDICINE / KIDNEY RESEARCH;

<P>
GENE LINKED TO INHERITED DISEASE ISOLATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Utah researchers have isolated the gene responsible for a form of inherited 
kidney disease called Alport syndrome, they report today in the journal 
Science. 
</P>
<P>
The debilitating disease, which affects about one person in 5,000, leads to 
loss of the kidney, necessitating dialysis or a kidney transplant. The 
discovery of the defective gene will quickly lead to genetic counseling for 
members of families carrying it, experts said, and may lead to the development 
of new therapies. 
</P>
<P>
Although the syndrome accounts for only about 2% of the 100,000 people in the 
United States who undergo kidney dialysis, isolation of the gene may provide 
clues to the causes of other types of hereditary kidney disease. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is it's very likely many other patients with progressive 
renal disease will have similar types of abnormalities," said Gary Striker of 
the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in 
Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major breakthrough for studying hereditary diseases of the kidney," 
added nephrologist Saulo Klahr of Washington University in St. Louis, president 
of the National Kidney Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
About 160,000 Americans suffer from end-stage kidney failure, and the annual 
cost of their care totals about $4.4 billion. Although infection, injury, 
alcohol abuse, diabetes and high blood pressure can cause kidney failure, as 
many as half of all cases are thought to be genetically linked. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have discovered the approximate location of the gene that causes a 
more common form of inherited kidney malady called polycystic kidney disease 
but have not isolated the gene itself. Today's Utah report represents the first 
clear indication of the cause of any form of kidney disease. 
</P>
<P>
The symptoms of Alport syndrome include blood in the urine, progressive kidney 
failure and, in some cases, hearing loss. The age at which the kidneys fail 
varies greatly from family to family. In addition, the syndrome may include 
malformation of the lenses of the eye and abnormalities of blood platelets and 
white cells. 
</P>
<P>
Although the disorder can affect either sex, males are more likely to suffer 
severe symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers at the University of Utah, headed by geneticist David F. Barker 
and biochemist Curt L. Atkin, have been studying 18 large families with a 
history of the syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
In three of the families, they have found large defects in a specific gene. 
That gene is the blueprint for a protein, called type IV collagen, that is a 
key component of a thin tissue called the glomerular basement membrane. The 
membrane is used by the kidney to filter blood. It allows metabolic wastes to 
pass from the blood to the kidney while keeping vital salts and proteins in the 
bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
In Alport syndrome patients, the collagen defect causes the slow deterioration 
of the membrane. As it deteriorates, the membrane frays and eventually scars, 
causing the kidney to slowly shut down. 
</P>
<P>
Barker believes that the other 15 families being studied have less-severe 
defects in the same gene that have not been observed in the "rather crude" 
method of detection. Researchers are using more sophisticated techniques to 
find defects in the gene in those families. 
</P>
<P>
Barker also hopes to insert the defective gene in mice to create the first 
animal model of Alport syndrome. Availability of such a model would enable 
researchers to test new therapies suggested by discovery of the gene. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he said, it may be possible to put a healthy form of the gene in 
the patients to cure the disease.

<P>
Demonstrators, some dressed as trees, launched Redwood Summer on Thursday with 
a protest at a lumber-export company, promising to "put their bodies on the 
line" to block cutting of virgin timber. 
</P>
<P>
The 50 demonstrators were matched one-for-one by police who are on edge because 
of a bombing that injured two members of Earth First!, the group organizing the 
summer of protest. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators gathered at the Port of Sacramento outside Gene West Inc., 
which exports logs to China, Korea, and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the port said Gene West Inc. exports only low-quality white fir 
and diseased trees, taken from the Sierra, that would not normally be milled in 
the United States anyway. Protesters planned to interfere with loading of logs 
aboard a Japan-bound ship, but the vessel sailed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Protest speakers Thursday decried what they said is over-harvesting of timber 
and cutting of old-growth redwoods. They said logging firms are racing 
deadlines, including environmental protection measures on California's November 
ballot.

UCLA SCALES BACK EXPANSION PROPOSAL AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: MOUNTING CRITICISM PROMPTED A SECOND CUTBACK AT THE UNIVERSITY. 
NEARLY 25% HAS BEEN TRIMMED FROM PLANNED ACADEMIC AND SUPPORT FACILITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young announced Thursday a second scaling-back of 
the university's massive, long-range development plan in response to a mounting 
campaign by members of the surrounding community. The two cutbacks trim nearly 
25% from the proposed academic and support facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Young said the latest revision of the 15-year growth plan "will not be without 
sacrifice to the academic program . . . but I recognize that a significant 
reduction in scope is necessary to enhance public confidence in UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
The university has been inundated with criticism from members of the Westwood 
community and elected officials ever since proposing an expansion plan in March 
that would have added 4.45 million square feet and increased UCLA's total 
building space by about a third. Young said at the time that the new facilities 
were needed to keep UCLA a world-class institution. 
</P>
<P>
As the 11th-largest employer in Los Angeles, UCLA has about 20,000 employees 
and 34,000-plus students. It has a major impact on the surrounding communities, 
particularly on traffic congestion in the Westwood area. 
</P>
<P>
And while UCLA promised not to increase traffic in the area, that assertion was 
widely questioned. The South Coast Air Quality Management District, for 
example, recently advised UCLA that its controversial growth plan would result 
in a significant increase in air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD weighed in after City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky and other elected 
officials publicly protested the scope of the expansion plan that would have 
added to the 413-acre campus more building square footage than is now along 
Wilshire Boulevard in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
But the largest outcry came from homeowner and community groups, and they were 
heartened to hear of the latest curtailment in the growth plan. 
</P>
<P>
"What a nice surprise," said community leader Laura Lake upon learning of the 
university's cutbacks. "It's a very positive step. . . . We think it's 
significant . . . and substantial." 
</P>
<P>
Young, in a telephone interview, said that being a good neighbor required 
partial acquiescence to the public outcry. But, he added: "We've gone as far as 
we can go." 
</P>
<P>
The most unpopular building in the plan, a conference center with 300 rooms for 
overnight guests, was jettisoned in mid-May because of fears that it would 
bring hotel-like traffic to Westwood Village. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the 750,000-square-foot cutbacks will be spread among 
remaining projects. But popular segments of the plan, such as the construction 
of 2,700 housing units for graduate students and faculty and a child care 
center, will not be scaled back. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is preparing a new environmental impact report that will be presented to 
the UC Board of Regents for approval in September.

STATE MAY TAKE OVER COUNTY FOSTER CARE 
</P>

<P>
A move is afoot in the Legislature to permit the state to step in and run the 
Los Angeles County foster care program, following reports that children are 
being physically and sexually mistreated. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on a letter from the state Department of Social Services charging the 
county with consistent failure to protect foster children from substandard 
conditions and abuse, Assembly and Senate subcommittees have adopted budget 
language to allow the state to assume jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, the letter cited instances in which 10 children were found 
sleeping on the floor of a garage and 20 infants were kept in 10 cribs. 
</P>
<P>
"We have totally lost confidence in Los Angeles County's ability to run the 
foster care program to protect the interests of these kids," said Assemblyman 
Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Health and Human Services 
subcommittee, on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a closer monitoring of these kids, who started out in life with the 
breaks against them, to see to it that things don't get even worse for them." 
</P>
<P>
Friedman was particularly critical of Robert Chaffee, director of the County 
Department of Children's Services. "He is a bureaucrat who indicated he is not 
willing to work with us on a solution to the problem," Friedman charged. 
</P>
<P>
Chaffee was not immediately available for comment, but in testimony before the 
subcommittee he called the state findings "not factual." 
</P>
<P>
The two subcommittees want the state Department of Social Services to take over 
the top management of the overall program. Los Angeles County case workers 
would continue to screen prospective foster parents and check up on foster home 
care. 
</P>
<P>
If the budget language remains intact, the proposed move would occur 90 days 
after the adoption of the 1990-91 state budget -- scheduled for sometime around 
July 1. 
</P>
<P>
"We support the subcommittees' action to take whatever steps are necessary to 
improve conditions in the foster care homes of Los Angeles County," Kathleen 
Norris, deputy director of public affairs for the state Social Services 
Department, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In her February letter, director Linda S. McMahon, wrote: "The majority of 
(license) revocation cases sent to us from Los Angeles County involve sexual 
molestation, physical abuse or death of children in the care of foster parents. 
It is still typically six months to a year after the discovery of the incident 
before referral for legal action occurs. This is an unacceptable delay." 
</P>
<P>
McMahon asked Chaffee to come up with a plan by July 1 to correct the problems 
of his department. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman said he believes the Legislature will approve the necessary budgetary 
language and Gov. George Deukmejian will leave it in the spending program 
because of the departmental endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
Foster homes are operated by private citizens who are paid with public funds to 
care for children who have been declared wards of the court, usually because 
they have been abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County is paid $3.3 million a year by the state to license and 
monitor 3,800 foster homes that house more than 10,000 children.

JUDGE OVERRULES BID TO LINK CIA, DRUG LORDS IN CAMARENA TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A defense lawyer in the Enrique Camarena murder trial attempted to ask a key 
prosecution witness Thursday whether he knew of any ties between major Mexican 
drug traffickers and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency but a federal judge 
prohibited the witness from answering. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Mary Kelly's question came during cross-examination of Laurence Victor 
Harrison, a government-paid witness who had extensive dealings with both 
Mexican law enforcement and drug traffickers. Harrison said there was a close 
working relationship between the drug lords and prominent Mexican police 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison's testimony came during the fourth week of trial for four men who are 
accused of involvement in the February, 1985, murder of Camarena, a U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration agent. 
</P>
<P>
The possible CIA link came after Kelly attempted to probe Harrison further. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Harrison testified that he had told drug kingpin Ernesto Fonseca 
Carrillo, for whom he had installed a sophisticated radio system, that law 
enforcement might go after him (Fonseca). 
</P>
<P>
"He told me I was crazy," Harrison recalled. "He told me there was no danger." 
</P>
<P>
Then the witness was asked, "Did Fonseca say it (his feeling of safety) was a 
political thing?" Harrison replied, "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly moved closer to the possible CIA link when she questioned Harrison about 
Sergio Espino Verdin, a commander in Mexico's federal security directorate 
(DFS), an internal security and investigative agency with close ties to the 
PRI, Mexico's dominant political party. Harrison said he worked for Espino, a 
close ally of Fonseca, who is currently in prison in Mexico after a conviction 
for his involvement in Camarena's murder. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison told the jury that Espino reported to Miguel Nazar Haro, who was DFS 
director from 1977 to 1982, when he was forced to resign after it was revealed 
that he was involved in a cross-border car smuggling ring. 
</P>
<P>
The Nazar case was controversial in the United States and Mexico. William 
Kennedy, then-U.S. attorney in San Diego, pressed the Justice Department in 
Washington to indict Nazar, despite protests from U.S. officials in Mexico that 
Nazar was "an essential repeat essential contact for CIA station Mexico City." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy was fired, but ultimately Nazar was indicted by a federal grand jury in 
San Diego and is still considered a fugitive in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison called Nazar his "overboss" and said Nazar was involved in drug 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Kelly asked Harrison if Nazar was connected to the CIA. Prosecutor 
Manuel Medrano objected on the grounds that the question was irrelevant to the 
case. U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie sustained the objection. 
</P>
<P>
Later, however, outside the presence of the jury, Kelly told the judge why she 
thought questions about the CIA were relevant to the Camarena case. 
</P>
<P>
"Fonseca thought his actions were condoned by the Mexican government, as well 
as sanctioned by the CIA," she said. "This goes to the issue of whether this 
was an illegal enterprise" and could help her client in her defense. 
</P>
<P>
Among the charges against the four defendants who are on trial here are violent 
crimes in aid of a racketeering enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly said she wanted to reserve the right to call Harrison back for more 
cross-examination. Rafeedie told her to submit a brief but no timetable was 
set. 
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyer said she was prompted to ask some of these questions because 
of an interview that Harrison gave to DEA agents last September, a copy of 
which was recently provided to the defense. In the interview, Harrison said 
that Fonseca and another drug kingpin, Javier Barba Hernandez, talked to Cubans 
in 1983 at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Guadalajara about drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me about it," Harrison told the DEA. "Barba also told me that they 
could do whatever they wanted with the Americans or the Cubans. I took that to 
mean they could do deals with the Americans or the Cubans." 
</P>
<P>
Harrison also told the DEA that Fonseca met with an American involved in drug 
smuggling who said he was "working with the Contras," a reference to 
U.S.-financed rebel troops in Nicaragua. He said this man, who was unnamed and 
told him he had been a mercenary in South Africa and also worked in El 
Salvador, asked him a lot of questions about airstrips. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him if he got close to the border that he'd have trouble with U.S. 
radar," Harrison told the DEA. "He said he was the U.S., that he didn't have 
any problem. He could do anything that they wanted." 
</P>
<P>
In another development Thursday, Rafeedie ruled that prosecutors could play 
tapes of narcotics traffickers interrogating Camarena shortly before they 
murdered him. Prosecutor Medrano indicated that the government would start 
playing the Spanish tapes, accompanied by English translations displayed on a 
screen, today.

DRUG WAR: THE BUSINESS TOOK LARGE SUMS OF CASH FROM NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS, 
OFFICIALS SAY.

<P>
The Internal Revenue Service on Thursday seized a Los Angeles car agency and 
its inventory of luxury automobiles and arrested three owners accused of 
courting drug traffickers by concealing the purchase of expensive cars for 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure of AMS Auto Sales, at 2045 La Cienega Blvd., along with more than 
40 cars, was said to be the first time "in the West" that a large business has 
been seized under federal law calling for forfeiture of property involved in 
drug- or money-laundering violations. 
</P>
<P>
Agents arrested Ahmad Reza Vosoughi, 32, of Los Angeles; Majid Ghassemieh, 33, 
of El Segundo, and Sorena Meshgani Solati, 34. They were named in a 16-count 
federal grand jury indictment returned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment accused the three of conspiring to launder money, failing to 
file required IRS forms when receiving more than $10,000 in cash and evading 
federal income taxes in allegedly using their car agency to secretly sell cars 
to known drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
After arresting the three owners at midafternoon Thursday, agents chained the 
gate to the agency's small parking lot near the Santa Monica Freeway. Cars 
worth hundreds of thousands of dollars -- including Jaguars, Mercedes-Benzes, 
BMWs, Ferraris and Porsches -- were parked behind a high wrought-iron fence. 
</P>
<P>
The seized automobiles will be offered for use by law enforcement agencies 
first, then sold at auction, an IRS spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
William G. Gilligan, branch chief of the IRS' Criminal Investigation Division, 
said the investigation leading to Thursday's arrests began two years ago when a 
routine audit aroused the suspicions of IRS examiners. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents later learned through the Los Angeles Police Department that AMS 
had sold cars to a number of well-known drug dealers, Gilligan said. 
</P>
<P>
At one stage, he said, the federal Drug Enforcement Administration tried 
unsuccessfully to make drug buys at the agency.

<P>
According to Gilligan, AMS, which proclaimed "the lowest prices" on a small 
sign facing the street, accepted large sums of cash from drug traffickers and 
failed to file the IRS form required when a business receives more than $10,000 
in cash in one transaction. 
</P>
<P>
The three arrested men are also accused of understating AMS' gross receipts on 
their tax returns. They are expected to be arraigned today in Los Angeles 
federal court. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Vosoughi faces a maximum penalty of 43 years in prison and a fine 
of $875,000; Ghassemieh, 42 years and $850,000, and Solati, 40 years and 
$800,000, according to the U.S. attorney's office.

$109-MILLION LIBRARY BOND ISSUE PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arguing that the city can no longer afford to ignore its dismal municipal 
library system, Councilwoman Judy McCarty on Thursday urged the City Council to 
place a $109-million library construction bond issue on the Nov. 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed bond issue would include $87 million for a new central library and 
$22 million for branch expansions and replacements. 
</P>
<P>
McCarty said the proposed ballot issue has "a very good chance" of winning in 
November, partly because it will be supported by the "Friends of the Library," 
a powerful group that includes more than 5,000 library patrons. 
</P>
<P>
McCarty also pointed to the positive statewide response on Tuesday by voters 
who approved local and state issues that earmarked funds for specific areas. 
</P>
<P>
Patrons of the city's library have willingly "stepped aside" in recent years as 
the cash-strapped council used its available revenue to fund parks, jails, 
roads and other capital improvements, McCarty said. While those projects have 
been funded, "we are no closer to a new central library than we were in 1985," 
McCarty said. 
</P>
<P>
"People use the library. Let's put it on the ballot and see if they're willing 
to pay for it," McCarty said. "Now is the time to plan the library and put it 
to a vote of the people." 
</P>
<P>
McCarty has asked Mayor Maureen O'Connor to place the proposed bond issue on 
the council agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor probably would agree to place the bond issue on the 
November ballot because "it's the kind of thing that the mayor has said should 
go before the public for a vote," O'Connor 
</P>
<P>
spokesman Paul Downey said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But Downey declined to comment on whether O'Connor will support the bond issue 
if it appears on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
During a budget workshop Thursday, council members agreed to maintain park and 
recreation services at their existing levels, pushing the budget shortfall for 
the upcoming fiscal year to at least $35 million. Individual council members 
also indicated that they wanted to consider increasing money for the Fire 
Department and social services. 
</P>
<P>
But, as in past budget meetings, the council once again delayed discussion on 
where added revenue will come from to balance the proposed general fund budget, 
which in recent weeks has grown to more than $455 million. 
</P>
<P>
While the council delayed discussion of new revenue for at least a week, 
Councilman Wes Pratt on Thursday advised his colleagues that "we're going to 
have to raise revenues. . . . It's definitely coming."

NATIONAL CITY CALLS HOTEL'S DEVELOPERS ON THE CARPET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
National City officials summoned the president and the principal investor of a 
troubled construction company to appear before the City Council and explain why 
no work has been done in two months on an eagerly-awaited hotel that is under 
construction in the South Bay community. 
</P>
<P>
Although months away from completion, the 12-story, $18-million hotel, being 
built at the corner of 8th Street and National City Boulevard by the Serj 
Corp., has been hit with about $900,000 in liens, said Councilman Jess E. Van 
De Venter, owner of a construction company. 
</P>
<P>
Serj Corp. president Jack Scull and William Barkett, the main investor in the 
unfinished hotel, are expected to appear before the City Council Tuesday night 
to explain why no work has been done in eight weeks. Scull did not return phone 
calls to his office and Barkett could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel's completion is key to the success of National City's plan for 
redevelopment of the downtown into a commercial center drawing tourists and 
out-of-town businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
The city sold the land to Serj at a favorable price -- millions less than the 
city itself had paid -- in exchange for the company's agreement to complete the 
hotel to the city's satisfaction. Hanging in the balance is hundreds of 
thousands of dollars a year in municipal tax revenue from the hotel, plus 
expected benefits to surrounding businesses. 
</P>
<P>
A hotel across the street, the $12-million Radisson Inn -- 10 stories high and 
180 rooms -- was also built by Serj and opened last year. According to Van De 
Venter, the Radisson Inn has about $3.5 million in liens filed by 
subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
Serj owns both hotels, which the city estimated will generate more than 
$915,000 in room taxes and up to $150,000 in property taxes from 1990 to 1995. 
After 1996, the city expects to get about $375,000 annually in room and 
property taxes from the hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Several other projects built by Serj and its subsidiaries in National City, San 
Diego and Imperial Beach have been hit with millions of dollars in liens by 
subcontractors who said they were not paid for the work they did, according to 
lien notices appearing in two legal newspapers . 
</P>
<P>
Other Serj subsidiaries include Concrete Dynamics, which built the Imperial 
Beach Pier, and FF&amp;E Pacific Rim. Concrete Dynamics is also a subcontractor 
at the unfinished National City hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The unfinished hotel is on 3.7 acres of redevelopment land 
</P>
<P>
that the city sold to Serj for $1.3 million, after paying $7 million for the 
land and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold (Pete) Peterson, executive director of National City's redevelopment 
agency, said Serj paid $464,000 for the lot where the unfinished hotel is being 
built and for a parking area across the street. 
</P>
<P>
Serj still owes the city $500,000 for the lot where the Radisson Inn was 
constructed. According to Peterson, the note for the $500,000 is payable at 10% 
interest and is due in November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have the money to pay anybody. I have subcontractor friends of mine 
who have worked for them and haven't been paid," said Van De Venter. "There's 
so many liens, loads of liens against the company and its smaller companies. 
Somewhere, they've got a serious money problem." 
</P>
<P>
Van De Venter, a long time South Bay builder, quoted several subcontractors as 
saying they will not return to the job site of the unfinished hotel until they 
are paid and satisfied that Serj's financial problems are straightened out. 
</P>
<P>
Some National City officials said they became aware of Serj's financial 
difficulties about eight weeks ago, when the company did not pick up 
city-approved permits for the plumbing and electrical work scheduled for the 
yet unnamed hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the permits was $177,000, and Serj could not pay for them, said 
Councilman Ralph Inzunza in a recent telephone interview. Other city officials 
also told The Times that it was their understanding that Serj could not pay for 
the permits. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mayor George Waters, who has consistently told the project's critics 
that work would resume in a week, claimed that Serj is not facing financial 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"No, the company doesn't have any money problems. It will be another two or 
three weeks before work will resume," said Waters in a telephone interview. "I 
don't believe that they couldn't pay for the permits. There was no work done on 
the project because they were reorganizing. That's all. Big business is like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Waters, who has attempted to make the best of the situation, said construction 
on the hotel is actually ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't supposed to break ground until May 1, so they're way ahead of 
schedule. . . . They've already spent about $6 million to put up what's there. 
They're going to finish it. No problem," Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the millions of dollars in liens against the two Serj-owned hotels in 
National City and its projects in other cities, Waters said, "It's all part of 
doing business. 
</P>
<P>
"That only means there's a difference of opinion among contractors. . . . 
That's settled in court," he added. 
</P>
<P>
However, Van De Venter said that Serj violated its contract with the city 
because of the liens filed against both hotels. 
</P>
<P>
"There are conditions in the contract that they have to finish the project to 
our satisfaction and with no liens against the hotels. . . . Basically, they 
have ignored the agreement," said Van De Venter. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Klusman, owner of Carl's Glass in San Diego, said he is owed $24,000 by 
FF&amp;E Pacific Rim, a Serj company, for work his company did at the Radisson 
Inn in National City and the Radisson Hotel Harborview on Front Street in San 
Diego. Klusman filed liens against both hotels and hired an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"Their answer was that they ran out of money and they kept telling me months 
ago that the money was coming in any day. Then you'd call them, and they would 
say it would be another week or two. Some people are going to go belly up 
because they haven't been paid. I'm holding on, barely. You know, $24,000 is a 
lot of money for a small business like mine. I've got 10 employees to think 
about," said Klusman. 
</P>
<P>
George Eiser, city attorney for National City, said delays in the new hotel 
project could have been avoided if Serj had put up a $200,000 performance bond, 
which is basically an insurance policy commonly purchased by contractors to 
insure that the job will be completed. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue of making them buy a bond was raised, but they objected because they 
said the cost would be too great. The alternative was that the project would 
not be done," said Eiser. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier interview, Peterson said that Serj was the only bidder for the 
hotel projects. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Wednesday, Waters at first insisted that Serj had 
purchased a bond. But, when told that Eiser and Peterson said no bond was 
purchased, Waters said the city was "covered in other ways." 
</P>
<P>
"Even without a bond, who's ahead? We are. We can still take the property back 
and the (unfinished) hotel. We don't lose out. . . . There are other things 
that can be used instead of a bond, like letters of credit. We're pretty well 
covered," said Waters. 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment agency director Peterson said the city did not pressure Serj to 
purchase a performance bond because the hotel is not a public project.

SILBERMAN IS UNSHAKABLE ABOUT THREATS; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: THE FINANCIER INSISTS HE WENT THROUGH WITH ILLEGAL DEALS BECAUSE HIS 
FAMILY WAS THREATENED, BUT ADMITS THAT HE DIDN'T NOTIFY POLICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sticking to his story despite the prosecution's relentless inquiry, San Diego 
financier Richard T. Silberman insisted Thursday that he participated in the 
second of the two deals at the heart of his money-laundering trial solely 
because a government informer threatened his family. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman conceded, however, that he did not tell police or his wife, San Diego 
County Supervisor Susan Golding, about the alleged threats by informer Robert 
Benjamin. And, when he was arrested, he did not tell FBI agents that he had 
been pressured into the deal, he admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, who once served as a top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown, also 
acknowledged that he heard the key undercover FBI agent in the case, Peter 
Ahearn, tell him shortly before the second deal went through that Ahearn's cash 
came from Colombian drug lords. The deal went forward, although Silberman 
claimed Thursday that he was just "playing along." 
</P>
<P>
During a full day of cross-examination, Silberman fought against his own words, 
which had been secretly recorded by the FBI on dozens of tapes. He was 
contentious and combative on the witness stand, his testimony often clashing 
with what the tapes said. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 61, is standing trial on seven felony counts. He is charged with 
laundering $300,000 in cash that was portrayed as narcotics by Ahearn -- posing 
as Pete Carmassi, a front man for Colombian drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
A prominent San Diego businessman, Silberman was arrested in April, 1989, 
immediately after leaving a Mission Bay hotel room where prosecutors contend he 
was negotiating a third money-laundering deal. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Silberman faces up to 75 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
In his second day of testimony in his own defense, Silberman returned briefly 
to the first of the two deals in the case, which he had discussed at length on 
Wednesday. The first transaction involved a November, 1988, swap of $100,000 
for stock in a Silberman gold mine subsidiary, Yuba American Gold. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr., the lead prosecutor in the case, 
asked Thursday whether there were any Yuba records indicating that Ahearn, to 
whom a Yuba stock certificate was delivered, actually was a shareholder. 
Silberman said there were none. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of Silberman's testimony on Thursday centered on Benjamin, who is 
</P>
<P>
scheduled to testify today. Silberman said Benjamin called him twice and 
pressured him into going through with the second deal, which evolved into a 
February, 1989, exchange of $200,000 for U.S. Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The first call came on Jan. 5, 1989, Silberman said. In what Silberman called a 
"very loud, very scary and very threatening voice," Benjamin allegedly said, 
"We know your wife. We know where you live. We know about your kids. If you 
don't want any harm, you're going to do this deal." 
</P>
<P>
Gorder asked why Silberman did not report the call to police and wondered 
whether Silberman had not thought that Golding's position and influence might 
cause officers to "jump on it." 
</P>
<P>
"They might have," Silberman said. "They might not have. I knew the first thing 
that would happen is that they would tell my wife." 
</P>
<P>
Silberman said he did not want Golding to find out about the call or the first 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I had done something stupid to get in this mess, and I didn't want her 
to know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 6, the day after the call from Benjamin, Silberman talked with Ahearn 
but did not mention the threats. "I was afraid to," Silberman said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was wanting to be very, very careful in this conversation, to see if he knew 
about (Benjamin's) phone call," Silberman said. "I didn't want to abruptly cut 
Ahearn off because I was afraid (Benjamin) would be activated." 
</P>
<P>
Silberman did not explain what "activated" meant. 
</P>
<P>
Gorder suggested that Silberman was simply eager for more business. According 
to the tape of the Jan. 6 call, Silberman asked if he and Ahearn could follow 
up with a meeting the next week. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to make it clear I wasn't cutting off any deals," Silberman said 
Thursday. "I wanted him to tell Benjamin, 'We got this guy sucked in.' " 
</P>
<P>
Silberman said Thursday that he was frightened and avoided Ahearn from Jan. 6 
through 27. But he also contradicted himself, saying that, during that period, 
after he "got very nervous," he once called Ahearn and left a message for him. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the purported threat, Silberman told Gorder he hired no bodyguards. 
But, he said, "I took a lot more precautions myself. I took a lot more interest 
in where the kids were every day, made sure the dogs were fed and the gates 
locked." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, on Feb. 4, Silberman testified, Benjamin called again, saying, 
"You know, you're stalling. I told you, we know all about your family and your 
wife. When you talk to Ahearn, you just do what he tells you to do." 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 7, according to the tapes, Silberman told Ahearn in a phone call that 
he had "some pressures." But the tapes indicate he immediately followed that by 
saying "they're not life-and-death pressures." 
</P>
<P>
It was in that same call that Ahearn told Silberman the cash came from "a bunch 
. . . of Colombian cocaine drug lords," according to the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
"I may have heard something like that," Silberman said. "But whatever (Ahearn) 
said all through the 7th made no sense, and I didn't believe any of it." 
</P>
<P>
Also in that call, Ahearn told Silberman, "I'm definitely not going to do it," 
referring to a second deal, "if you don't want to do it." 
</P>
<P>
The conversation continued for 24 more pages in a transcript of the tape. On 
the tape, Silberman bragged about how "unique" his system was and said, "No one 
has ever written us up in the newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
"All I wanted to do was keep the conversation going until I could figure out 
what to do with Benjamin," Silberman testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
He added, "I had no idea what (Ahearn's) business was, whatever he said made no 
sense, and I was just playing along with him." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, the second deal began when Ahearn delivered the cash. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Silberman said, he was convinced that Ahearn was merely "looking to 
make money for himself by taking advantage of me." 
</P>
<P>
Gorder asked how that could be, given that the $200,000 deal was set to involve 
$24,000 in commissions, leaving Ahearn with what was supposed to be $176,000 
worth of bonds. "He seemed to have a way to do it," Silberman said. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason I sold him bonds was I thought at the time, and it was a 
mistake, that, if I did this one deal with him, it would get rid of these 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
The value of the bonds that were delivered was shy anywhere from $30,000 to 
$50,000, Gorder said. Silberman, he contended, opted for a third deal, which 
was to be for about $1 million, but in which commissions would be cut to make 
up for the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman said Benjamin suggested the third deal. And he stressed that he was 
never involved in "negotiations" with Ahearn about a subsequent transaction, 
only "discussions."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PRIVATE SCHOOL TO START FIRST YEAR IN 
SEPTEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Westside Prep, an independent, private school in Culver City, plans to start 
its first full year in September, with seats for 126 students in kindergarten 
to 12th grade. 
</P>
<P>
The school, which will have multi-age learning groups rather than traditional 
grade groupings, will emphasize role playing, data collection and analysis and 
other methods to develop thinking skills, said Headmaster Les Birdsall. 
</P>
<P>
A group of Westside Prep teachers and administrators are coming from the 
18-year-old Newbridge School, which has sold its site at 1619 S. Robertson 
Blvd. and is looking for a new home. 
</P>
<P>
Westside Prep will be operating in part of the El Marino School at Port Road. 
The fall term will begin Sept. 10. Tuition is $6,000 to $8,000 a year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The school also offers a summer session, which begins June 25. For more 
information, call (213) 210-0056.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LIMOUSINE USED IN 2ND GANG-RELATED SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gang members riding home from a funeral Thursday used two rented limousines as 
vehicles for a drive-by shooting that resulted in the wounding of a man, police 
said. It was the second time this week a limousine was used in a gang-related 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified victim was taken to Brotman Medical Center in Culver City and 
treated for a gunshot wound to the foot, said Police Sergeant Bob James. 
</P>
<P>
No one has been arrested, James said. The limousines were impounded as evidence 
and the drivers questioned and released, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"These drivers don't know what these people are doing," James said. "These 
people are in the back partying. The drivers don't know what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred at 2:30 p.m. in the 2700 block of West Vernon Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
In an incident Tuesday, Robert Lewis Riley Jr., 19, was killed when gang 
members opened fire from a limousine. Police are investigating both shootings.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAYOR LOSES BID TO SPEED ACTION ON WATER 
PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley sought unsuccessfully Thursday to hasten City 
Council consideration of a mandatory water rationing program designed to cut 
consumption by at least 10% from 1986 levels. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley was angered by a proposal by Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores to delay 
the council's hearing on his plan until June 27. 
</P>
<P>
It had been scheduled for June 15, but Flores persuaded Council President John 
Ferraro to postpone the hearing because only 10 lawmakers were scheduled to be 
present. All 15 are expected on June 27. 
</P>
<P>
"This important action deserves the attention of the entire council," said 
Flores, chairwoman of the Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
</P>
<P>
But Bradley, who has been calling for speedy action on his plan all along, 
urged the council to schedule an earlier hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"Summer is already on us and will soon be gone. That's the point at which we 
need the best efforts if we are going to make any achievement this year,"

As celebrity endorsers, actors James Garner and Jack Lemmon were on the winning 
side in the primary, recording TV ads opposing Propositions 118 and 119, the 
reapportionment proposals. 
</P>
<P>
But another Hollywood celebrity, Jack Klugman, didn't fare as well. 
</P>
<P>
Klugman posed with a candidate for Riverside County coroner in newspaper ads 
that proclaimed: "Coroner Quincy says: 'Tom Decker's My Man. He's a Cut Above 
the Rest." Decker finished fourth, or as "Coroner Quincy" might have ruled, 
dead last.

More than a dozen stunned constituents telephoned county Supervisor Kenneth 
Hahn to confess they thought they were voting for him when they cast ballots 
for Kenneth P. Hahn for county assessor. 
</P>
<P>
"One person said he was really shocked when he saw a man making a speech on TV 
and the name 'Kenneth P. Hahn' flashed under his picture," laughed Lynn 
Sakamoto, a spokesman for Hahn, the supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
The Other Hahn, a deputy assessor not related to the supervisor, surprised 
himself and those ubiquitous "political observers" by nearly outpolling 
incumbent John J. Lynch. The two will face each other in a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the Other Hahn's supporters thought he and the supervisor were the 
same person. Lela Batiste, a secretary in the supervisor's office, said she 
heard from a couple of callers with a different message. 
</P>
<P>
"They congratulated him (Kenneth P. Hahn)," she said, "because they thought he 
was the supervisor's son." 
</P>
<P>
The surprising result in the assessor's primary no doubt has incumbent Lynch 
wondering what he has to do to get a little name recognition around here. 
</P>
<P>
After all, since taking office, Lynch is believed to have set a record for 
county officeholders by affixing his name to 17 doors in the halls of the Hall 
of Administration.

The owners of Western Exchange Inc. in Hollywood say they've been receiving 
other people's mail for months. Letters intended for companies ranging from the 
Screen Actors Guild to the publisher of a bondage magazine. Letters addressed 
to destinations ranging from Fullerton to Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
"We're worried that the letters we send out haven't reached their destinations, 
either," said Executive Vice President Robert Kundel. 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service says it's trying to iron out the problems. 
</P>
<P>
Western Exchange has reason to be concerned about mail deliveries. And so do 
its addressees. 
</P>
<P>
The company's a collection agency.

Over the years, artist David Rose has fashioned courtroom sketches of such 
defendants as Patty Hearst, John DeLorean and Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's recording scenes from a trial of endurance -- construction on Metro 
Rail's Red Line project. 
</P>
<P>
"I started getting seriously interested in drawing construction work about 15 
years ago," Rose said. "The workers on a construction site don't put on any 
airs -- what you see is what you get. As an artist, that's very refreshing." 
</P>
<P>
Rose's collection of pastels and watercolors are on display in "The Subway 
Builders," an exhibit in the Bridge Gallery connecting City Hall with City Hall 
East. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, we await the verdict on Metro Rail. 
</P>
<P>
In the last several months, Southern Californians have introduced a 
drive-through supermarket, debated over whether to make a carwash a cultural 
monument, and proposed building a monument over the Hollywood Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
But Chicago columnist Mike Royko and other needling Southland-ologists needn't 
fear that we're running out of innovations. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, just the other day, a memo was circulated introducing a new entree at 
the L.A Times cafeteria . . .

POLICE SHOOTINGS TARGET OF PROTEST

Expressing their "outrage" at a number of recent shootings by law enforcement 
officers, a group of human rights activists Thursday called on local and 
federal authorities in San Diego to prosecute and discipline lawmen who wrongly 
resort to lethal force. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the only solution . . . is a recognition by the leadership of the 
existence of a problem and a resolve to solve it," said Betty Wheeler, legal 
director of the American Civil Liberties Union chapter representing San Diego 
and Imperial counties. "There are lots of alternatives to deadly force." 
</P>
<P>
She and representatives of several other rights organizations -- including the 
Chicano Federation, the Coalition for Law and Justice and the American Friends 
Service Committee -- spoke at a San Diego news conference during which they 
condemned what they characterized as a rising number of improper shootings by 
law enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
They asserted that existing laws and guidelines were generally sufficient to 
deal with the problem, but that authorities were hesitant to accuse officers. 
</P>
<P>
In general, law enforcement guidelines prohibit officers from discharging their 
weapons or using other lethal force unless their lives or the lives of other 
innocent people are in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the San Diego Police Department, U.S. Border Patrol and San Diego 
County district attorney's office -- three agencies targeted Thursday by 
detractors -- later disputed the characterizations and maintained that all 
officer shootings are subject to numerous reviews. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a little bit irresponsible for anybody to look at a series of 
incidents and lump them together and draw a single conclusion," said San Diego 
police Commander Larry Gore, adding that all police shootings were thoroughly 
investigated. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the critics singled out three heavily publicized cases that 
occurred last month: the fatal shooting of an unarmed Vista motorist by a 
sheriff's officer who wrongly believed that the suspect was driving a stolen 
truck; the shooting death by a San Diego policeman of a Mexican citizen who was 
walking along Interstate 5, brandishing a plastering tool; and an incident in 
which a Border Patrol agent fired at the rear of a van full of unarmed, 
undocumented immigrants, wounding a Salvadoran woman and a 16-year-old Mexican 
boy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to start sending a message that law enforcement officers will be 
charged criminally in shootings where no apparent threat exists to him or other 
officers," said Roberto Martinez, a San Diego-based rights activist who is 
involved with several immigrant advocacy groups. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez and others charged that San Diego County Dist. Atty. Edwin L. Miller, 
whose office investigates all shootings by local law enforcement agencies, is 
predisposed to rule that all police shootings are justified. The activists 
called on the district attorney's office to pursue such cases more vigorously, 
and they renewed a call for establishing some form of independent bodies to 
investigate law enforcement shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen J. Casey, a special assistant to district attorney Miller, defended the 
prosecutor's record. "The investigations and reviews are fact-driven," Casey 
said of the inquiries into law enforcement shootings.

SCHOOL RISKS COMMERCIAL TAINT IN MEDIUM FOR MEAT IN MESSAGE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: STUDENTS AT SAN DIEGO UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL DON'T SEEM TO MIND TV 
ADS IN CLASS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
For students at University of San Diego High School, a Dentyne or Gatorade 
commercial has been a small price to pay to learn such things as the difference 
between Margaret Thatcher and Dianne Feinstein, or that Guam is an American 
possession in the Pacific, not the name of a chip dip. 
</P>
<P>
For teachers and administrators, two minutes of commercials in the 12-minute 
Channel 1 newscast beamed into 51 classrooms every morning this school year 
have been a small price to pay for receiving not only the news program but 
$50,000 worth of video and television equipment provided by Whittle 
Communications of Knoxville, Tenn., the program's producer. 
</P>
<P>
But, until last week, the high school, part of the Catholic Diocese of San 
Diego, was the only California school receiving Channel 1, which has generated 
strong controversy because its programming contains commercials. 
</P>
<P>
As a private school, it is not subject to warnings from state Schools Supt. 
Bill Honig, who says that showing commercials as part of a news program fails 
to qualify as an educational activity and is unethical because it treats 
students as a commodity to be sold. 
</P>
<P>
Honig has vowed to withhold state education money, based on attendance, from 
any California public school for the portion of time each day students spend 
watching Channel One. 
</P>
<P>
University of San Diego High has received Channel 1 since September. Last week, 
a high school in San Jose, Overfelt High, became the first public school to try 
Channel 1 -- which ends today for the 1989-90 school year -- as well as a 
likely test case for Honig when the school asks for about $30,000 worth of 
attendance reimbursement later this year. 
</P>
<P>
At Whittle's suggestion, the Catholic school showed off its use of Channel 1 
Thursday, as part of the corporation's lobbying effort in the state Legislature 
for a bill to allow individual public school districts to decide whether they 
want to subscribe to the Whittle package. 
</P>
<P>
The measure was withdrawn from consideration Wednesday by its author, 
Assemblyman Stan Statham (R-Redding), after he concluded it could not pass in 
face of fierce opposition from Honig, the state PTA, the state School Boards 
Assn. and the two major teacher employee groups. Statham said he may ask the 
legislature to finance a study of the Channel 1 concept. 
</P>
<P>
Honig and other state educators have promoted a competing news program for 
teen-agers, CNN Newsroom, a 15-minute weekday newscast from the Atlanta-based 
Cable News Network and free to any school equipped for cable transmission. 
About 40 schools in San Diego County alone are using the CNN broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Honig nor the Whittle Corp. disagrees about the overall abysmal level 
of knowledge among American secondary school students regarding current events, 
geography and foreign nations, as measured by numerous tests and surveys during 
the past several years. Rather, they part company over the issue of how to 
improve the sorry state of affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Both CNN Newsroom and Channel 1 offer a fast-paced summary of major news 
stories, followed by features ranging from business to science to education, 
all presented by young, peppy anchors. 
</P>
<P>
But Whittle, by including commercial advertising, can generate enough revenue 
to turn a profit and to give schools, without cost, the equipment needed to 
deliver the program to all classrooms. In return, the school agrees to show the 
program to all students every day. 
</P>
<P>
CNN offers only the ability to tape its program free every day if a school has 
the necessary facilities. 
</P>
<P>
For University of San Diego High, Whittle's offer of equipment was the major 
selling point. 
</P>
<P>
"We could not have afforded the equipment otherwise" to show the program in all 
our classes, Estelle L. Kassebaum, the school's executive director of 
development, said Thursday. And, although the school did have some initial 
qualms about Channel 1 because of the commercials, Kassebaum said, "We've had 
nothing but positive responses. . . . From what we've seen of the commercials, 
they are brief and well-done." All 1,250 students are able to watch the news 
daily now that each class has a ceiling-mounted television monitor. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the 11th-grade history students in Ron Arrington's American 
history class discounted the argument that the commercials are a drawback. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us just doze off during them, or we talk during the commercials unless 
they're really well-made, like the one with Michael Jordan," Alison Gingeras 
said. Although most of the students could remember the four commercials shown 
Thursday -- for Dentyne, Certs, Gatorade and a Columbia Pictures trailer for 
"Milo and Otis" -- the ads are the same ones they see at home all the time, the 
students said. 
</P>
<P>
"They could have sort of a brainwashing effect," volunteered Judy Petix, saying 
that a friend of hers sings along to certain ads. "But I would take (Channel 1) 
with the ads" if it were a choice of not having the news at all, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Instructor Arrington said he believes "the state of California is really 
missing out on a very real educational opportunity, since there definitely are 
students who can retain much information visually. 
</P>
<P>
"The commercials are not offensive in this case," said Arrington, reflecting a 
widespread view that two minutes of commercials are minor for teen-agers 
already sated with advertising directed at them. 
</P>
<P>
But Honig aide Bill Rukeyser says the state Department of Education's 
opposition is unalterable because Whittle is asking schools for exclusive 
access to students in exchange for equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"Honig believes that, even if we were to violate our sense of ethics -- which 
says we should not sell students for access -- the proper way to do this would 
be for us to line our kids up in front of television advertisers ourselves and 
sell directly.

COUNCIL VOTES TO TRIPLE ITS WAGES

<P>
The Moorpark City Council has voted to triple its monthly paychecks over the 
opposition of two council members. 
</P>
<P>
Stipends will increase from $100 to $300. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Paul Lawrason and Eloise Brown voted Wednesday night against 
the measure proposed by Scott Montgomery. It was supported by Clint Harper and 
Mayor Bernardo Perez. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery said he asked to triple the pay because he feels that the council is 
underpaid for the work it does. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council meets twice a month at regular Wednesday meetings, and members 
also attend special meetings at which city business is discussed, Montgomery 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The pay increases could become an election issue. Brown and Harper are up for 
reelection in November. In addition, the city will elect a mayor for the first 
time, and Harper and Lawrason have indicated that they will file to run for the 
office. In addition to the stipend, the city has budgeted $6,600 to reimburse 
council members for travel and business expenses, Deputy City Manager Richard 
Hare said. The council has spent about $3,700 from the budget for travel 
expenses this year. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, council members representing cities with populations of less 
than 35,000 are allowed monthly stipends of up to $300. Moorpark is the 
fastest-growing city in the county with a population of nearly 27,000. 
</P>
<P>
The raise is the first the five-member council has given itself since the city 
incorporated in 1983. Any pay increase approved by the council would not take 
effect until after the November election. PSYCHE PASCUAL

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SALVATION ARMY GIVEN GRANT TO SHELTER 
FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $100,000 grant -- the largest ever given by the Glendale Community Foundation 
-- has been awarded to the Salvation Army to help establish the first shelter 
for homeless families in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old nonprofit group recently allocated the grant toward purchase of 
the Booth House, a private residence on Chester Street that the Salvation Army 
plans to convert into a temporary shelter for displaced families. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale City Council last month allocated $200,000 in federal grant money 
for the Booth House. The Salvation Army will use the foundation grant in paying 
the balance of the $460,000 purchase price at the close of escrow June 26. The 
shelter is expected to open in September. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Miller, executive director of the community group, said the foundation 
typically awards grants of under $10,000. He said the unusually large grant was 
made at the request of a member who donated his own funds for the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the donor, who asked to remain anonymous, is a longtime trustee of 
the foundation.

4-QUARTER SCHOOL SCHEDULE APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the hope of improving student grades at Hueneme High School, the Oxnard 
Union High School District has approved a plan to divide the school year into 
four nine-week quarters, rather than two 18-week semesters. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in September, Hueneme High School will lengthen class periods from 55 
minutes to 90 minutes, a change that will add 30 minutes to the school day. 
</P>
<P>
Students will take four classes each quarter rather than six a semester. 
</P>
<P>
The two-semester system will remain intact at the four other high schools in 
the 11,000-student district. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees said Wednesday that they believe that the restructured school day will 
bolster grades and improve attendance at the 2,000-student school because 
teachers will be able to spend more time in the classroom. The change could 
make it easier to spot learning problems, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Teachers will have more time to focus on individual children," Hueneme High 
School Principal Terry Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
With fewer classes to study for each quarter, students will be better able to 
focus their attention and will be able to spend more time studying for each 
class, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Students will be able to take more classes in four nine-week quarters than 
under the old system. They will be able to take 16 courses a year rather than 
12 now. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it will give our kids an edge because they will have a chance to 
accelerate their high school schedules," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
The different schedule will allow students who are doing poorly in class or 
must miss part of the school year to have a fresh start every nine weeks, 
school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot more chance for renewal under the quarter system," Taylor said.

VOICE DRAWS COUNCIL SUPPORT FOR AN ANTI-GRAFFITI TAX; 
</P>
<P>
LAWS: ABOUT 2,000 MEMBERS OF A COALITION SUPPORT THE PLAN. THEY SAY IT WOULD BE 
THE LARGEST PROGRAM OF ITS KIND IN THE NATION. 
</P>

<P>
An ordinance that would tax utility customers to raise millions of dollars 
annually to pay for scrubbing Los Angeles clean of graffiti will get its first 
airing next month before a City Council committee. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters said the proposed program would be the largest and most 
comprehensive in the nation. "We are going to put Los Angeles on the map as the 
first city in the United States to be graffiti-free," said Marsha Novak of 
Tarzana, co-chairwoman of Valley Organized in Community Efforts, the group 
backing the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the program have yet to be worked out, but members of VOICE, a 
coalition of San Fernando Valley-based churches and synagogues, already are 
soliciting and winning the support of City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 VOICE members voted to endorse the ordinance, introduced last month 
by Councilman Joel Wachs, at a "Call to Action" assembly Wednesday night at 
Valley Beth Shalom Temple in Encino. Council members Joy Picus and Zev 
Yaroslavsky, who attended the event, promised to support the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs proposed the ordinance after a VOICE delegation demanded at a May 10 
council budget meeting that the city increase its spending on anti-graffiti 
programs from $2.8 million to at least $5.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
VOICE leaders said Wednesday that ridding the city of graffiti is a key element 
of efforts to curb crime and regain control of crime-plagued neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"Graffiti is a public billboard for advertising gangs, drug deals, prostitution 
and sometimes even death," Novak said. 
</P>
<P>
She said VOICE research showed that no city in the country has an on-going, 
comprehensive program to remove graffiti. "Los Angeles would be the first," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Wachs ordinance would add a surcharge to all customers' water and power 
bills to pay for the anti-graffiti program. VOICE has proposed that residential 
customers pay 50 cents per month and that commercial customers pay $1 a month 
to raise $9.7 million for the program. 
</P>
<P>
Greig Nelson, a Wachs aide, said those figures may change after details about 
city departments' current anti-graffiti programs are compiled. The Department 
of Recreation and Parks, for example, removes graffiti from its buildings and 
grounds and street maintenance crews remove it from stop signs and street 
signs, but there is no comprehensive city program, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the new program, such as whether city workers or criminal offenders 
working off their sentences would remove graffiti, also have yet to be 
determined, Nelson said. Charging utility customers appears to be the easiest 
way to collect the fees, he said.

If the program is approved, Nelson said, Los Angeles would be the first city of 
any consequence in the nation to undertake such a project, according to his 
research. "We're blazing new territory," Nelson said. "I think the biggest that 
has been undertaken has been New York City and its subway. No car goes out in 
the morning that isn't clean of graffiti." 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is to be heard July 10 by the city Budget and Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's meeting, VOICE leaders also reported on the status of other 
anti-graffiti efforts during the past two years by the organization. 
</P>
<P>
A bill to raise more money for graffiti cleanup is being carried in Sacramento 
by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) at the request of VOICE and its sister 
organizations in Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
That bill would allow local governments, with the approval of voters, to impose 
a surcharge of up to 10 cents a can on spray paint. The funds raised by the tax 
would go for graffiti removal. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said the ordinance, which will be heard on the Assembly floor Monday, 
provides a tool to "paint off graffiti as fast as gang members put it up." 
</P>
<P>
VOICE leaders also said several judges have consented to sentence people 
convicted of minor offenses to graffiti removal duty instead of other forms of 
community service. They praised ordinances passed by the city of San Fernando 
and Los Angeles County that require merchants to lock up spray paint and urged 
Los Angeles to do the same.

CITYHOOD PLAN FOR SUNSET HILLS A BAD IDEA, PANEL WARNS 
</P>

The proposed city of Sunset Hills in the Santa Clarita Valley would not be 
financially sound and should not be incorporated, according to a report 
released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by the staff of the Local Agency Formation Commission, 
also questioned the value of launching a second city in the valley, noting that 
the city of Santa Clarita is only two years old and is still working out plans 
for its future. 
</P>
<P>
"The need for an additional city in the Santa Clarita Valley has not been 
demonstrated," the report said. LAFCO, which oversees incorporations and 
annexations, has scheduled a hearing on the cityhood proposal June 27. 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO Executive Director Ruth Benell said the proposed 27.8-square-mile city -- 
now mostly vacant land west of the Golden State Freeway, inhabited by 1,701 
residents -- does not have the industrial base to provide public services. 
Except for a few fast-food restaurants and a hotel, the only major commercial 
enterprise is Six Flags Magic Mountain, which opposes the cityhood plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I don't think it's a viable proposal," Benell said. She noted that 
the cityhood plan is opposed by Newhall Land and Farming Co., which owns 19.5 
square miles in the proposed city, 70% of its territory. 
</P>
<P>
A LAFCO study found that Sunset Hills would amass yearly budget deficits from 
$275,000 to almost $500,000 during the first four years of cityhood. In the 
world of municipal government, the deficits would be relatively small but would 
not justify incorporation, Benell said. 
</P>
<P>
The cityhood drive was launched by Jeff Stevenson, a vice president of Dale Poe 
Development Corp., and Ernest Dynda, a former member of the Agoura Hills City 
Council. Dale Poe is building the giant Stevenson Ranch development that would 
be the heart of the proposed city and has expressed concerns about slow-growth 
movements in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
Sunset Hills is an excellent candidate for cityhood because the residents could 
plan their city from its birth, creating their own identity in the Santa 
Clarita Valley, Stevenson said. 
</P>
<P>
The cityhood proposal was submitted to LAFCO last fall shortly before the 
commission considered a request by Santa Clarita that would have made Sunset 
Hills eligible for annexation by Santa Clarita. LAFCO turned down Santa 
Clarita's request, citing the Sunset Hills incorporation movement in its 
denial. 
</P>
<P>
Angry Santa Clarita officials blasted the LAFCO denial and bitterly labeled 
Sunset Hills "Poe-dunk." Mayor Jo Anne Darcy pledged to fight Sunset Hills 
cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
Benell said the Sunset Hills cityhood campaign was partly driven by the desire 
to keep the area out of Santa Clarita. "I'm not sure how serious the proponents 
of the proposal were" about creating their own city, Benell said. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson partially agreed. "I don't want to be in the city of Santa Clarita at 
this time," he said. Even if LAFCO denies cityhood for Sunset Hills at the 
hearing this month, the commission should "preserve our right to decide our own 
destiny" and keep Sunset Hills out of Santa Clarita, he said.

LANCASTER MOTHER IS CONVICTED OF MURDER; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: BELITA FOX KILLED THE MAN SHE SAID GAVE DRUGS TO HER DAUGHTER, A JURY 
FINDS. SHE BLAMED HIM FOR THE GIRL'S RUNNING AWAY FROM HOME.

<P>
A jury convicted a Lancaster woman Thursday of murdering a construction worker 
she accused of giving her teen-age daughter drugs, rejecting the woman's claim 
that she was defending herself and her daughter when she shot the man 
repeatedly in his bed. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict in Lancaster Superior Court came after two days of deliberations. 
Jurors said afterward that they did not believe 41-year-old Belita Fox when she 
said she confronted Kevin Furman at his house in Lancaster to warn him about 
giving drugs to her teen-age daughter, who was not at the house. Fox said she 
shot Furman because he rose to his knees in bed about three feet from her, 
which she interpreted as a threatening move. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence didn't bear it out," said juror Mary Ann Floyd. "We explored 
everything. . . . To a person, we are confident that we made the right 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
The trajectory of the bullets and testimony of a witness, Furman's roommate, 
contradicted Fox's account, indicating that Furman, 23, was prone in bed when 
Fox shot him four times shortly after midnight Aug. 30. Fox testified that she 
sat by the body for at least half an hour before calling her daughter and then 
calling authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The jury rejected the defense portrayal of an anguished mother fighting to 
protect her 17-year-old daughter, Cheryl Wilson. Fox's lawyer, Vincent Oliver, 
described Furman as "drug scum" and the "top man" in a drug house, referring in 
closing arguments to the ravages of the drug problem nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
But juror Jaime Levario said of the dead man: "I didn't think he was drug scum. 
To me, drug scum is someone who's ruthless. . . . He didn't seem like that." 
</P>
<P>
A witness testified that Furman sold methamphetamine on two occasions and used 
drugs occasionally. He testified that Cheryl used methamphetamine and marijuana 
at the house, but Furman was not there at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's detectives said they did not believe Furman was a drug dealer. And 
Furman's roommate testified that Furman did not permit minors to use drugs at 
the house, and that he never saw Furman use drugs with Cheryl, Furman's 
girlfriend's cousin. 
</P>
<P>
Fox, who cried frequently during the four-day trial, remained calm as the 
verdict was read and deputies took her into custody. She had been free on 
$100,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
She faces a sentence of 27 years to life when she appears for sentencing before 
Judge Margaret Grignon on June 28. Oliver said he plans to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Furman's mother, Jean Harmon, and a contingent of relatives and friends wept 
and hugged one another and jurors outside the courtroom. Harmon said the 
verdict partially vindicated her dead son of Fox's drug-dealing allegations, 
which caused Harmon to organize a "Justice for Kevin" campaign, with buttons 
and T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
"She is behind bars where she belongs," Harmon said. "She won't be able to hurt 
anyone else's children." 
</P>
<P>
In reaching the first-degree murder conviction, jurors rejected additional 
defenses that Fox was drunk and did not know the gun was loaded. Jurors said 
they agreed with Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Foltz's charge that Fox targeted 
Furman because she irrationally blamed him for Cheryl's running away from home 
and the breakup of her family. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe she planned it," Levario said. "She thought it through. She wanted 
revenge on somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Foltz said: "I don't feel that the jurors felt the drug situation at Furman's 
house was anywhere close to how it was portrayed. Or that they feel that 
someone deserves summary execution for a crime for which they would be jailed." 
</P>
<P>
Oliver said he had expected the jury to find Fox guilty of a lesser charge, 
such as second-degree murder. He said jurors did not give sufficient weight to 
potential mitigating factors, including Fox's testimony that she drank 10 beers 
and two or three shots of liquor before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver said that Cheryl now lives with relatives in another community, which he 
did not identify. Cheryl did not attend the trial, but Fox's other two children 
did. Her 21-year-old daughter, Christine Wilson, remained in her seat crying 
after Fox was led away and other spectators had left the courtroom.

CAMPUS THEFT RING BROKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego State University police believe they have broken the largest campus 
theft ring in recent history, involving $60,000 of computers and related 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Campus police received reports of 12 thefts from January to this month from 
several university buildings, and they believe three men arrested Monday and 
Tuesday -- including an SDSU student -- are responsible, university detective 
Tom Boyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Campus police officers Paul Neuharth and Marian Nowak saw Thomas R. Hayes, 19, 
of the 2900 block of Manos Drive in San Diego, carrying a computer out of the 
Disabled Student Services office in the middle of the night, Boyer said. When 
Hayes was confronted by the officers, Boyer reported, "he just said, 'You got 
me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Police then obtained a search warrant for Hayes' home and a rental garage, 
where they recovered six computers, three printers and other computer equipment 
valued at $45,000, Boyer said. Hayes was arrested on suspicion of 12 counts of 
burglary. Boyer said Hayes used the stolen master keys to get into the 
university buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The police investigation led to the arrest of SDSU student Joshua L. Robinson, 
19, of the 5000 block of 55th Place. He was arrested on suspicion of one count 
of burglary and has been released from the County Jail on bail. 
</P>
<P>
Randall W. Smock, 20, of the 1000 block of Leyte Road in Coronado, was also 
arrested in connection with one count of burglary. He has been released from 
the County Jail on his own recognizance.

HOLDEN TO REJECT BULK OF COUNCIL PAY HIKE -- FOR NOW; 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSITION H: HE SAYS HE MIGHT TAKE THE EXTRA MONEY, APPROVED BY VOTERS 
TUESDAY, IF L.A.'S BUDGET CONDITION IMPROVES NEXT YEAR.

Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden on Thursday became the first council 
member to reject the full $24,935-a-year pay raise approved by voters in 
Tuesday's election as part of Proposition H, the ethics reform measure. 
</P>
<P>
Holden, a supporter of the measure, said he could not take the pay hike as long 
as the city has fiscal problems. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Holden's move, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, Proposition H's most 
outspoken foe, told reporters he was accepting the pay increase. Council 
members Ernani Bernardi and Ruth Galanter, other opponents of the measure, also 
plan to take the windfall. 
</P>
<P>
"The people voted for it," Yaroslavsky said. "I campaigned against it. I fought 
against it. And I said all along I'd take the money if it passed." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, Bernardi and Galanter signed a ballot argument that said: "Charter 
Amendment H is a pay raise for politicians masquerading as ethics reform. It's 
a fraud. The mayor and City Council want a staggering 40% pay raise, but they 
haven't earned it." 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he could take a raise he had damned so vehemently, Yaroslavsky said 
his real problem was with the other costs of Proposition H. The pay hike for 
the 18 elected city officials -- 15 council members, the mayor, city attorney 
and city controller -- will cost about $425,000 alone. 
</P>
<P>
But the public financing and ethics reform elements of Proposition H, 
Yaroslavsky stressed, will bring the total price tag of implementing the 
measure to $4 million. None of this money has been set aside in the city 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
Holden opened the Pandora's Box on the pay raise issue by holding a news 
conference to say he could not, in "good conscience," take the pay hike at a 
time when City Hall is trimming city services due to a budget crunch. He said 
he would take a 5% increase for himself, but return the rest to the city's 
general fund. Council members' received a 40.7% pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition H got 56.7% of the vote Tuesday. It was approved in all parts of 
the city, except the northwest San Fernando Valley. The voters in Councilman 
Hal Bernson's 12th District defeated the measure by 35 votes out of more than 
32,000 cast. Bernson and many other elected officials could not be reached 
Thursday about whether they would follow Holden. 
</P>
<P>
Holden said he might reconsider his decision around the beginning of next year 
if the city's budget situation improves. Holden said he felt he and his council 
colleagues deserved the pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the raises, Proposition H also establishes an ethics commission, 
provides for public financing of political campaigns and bans outside 
employment by the city's elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
The measure's passage boosts the pay for council members from $61,222 to 
$86,157 and ties their salaries to those of Municipal Court judges. The 
salaries of the mayor, city attorney and city controller are set, respectively, 
at 30%, 20% and 10% more than those paid the judges. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition H boosted Mayor Tom Bradley's salary from $102,537 to $112,004, a 
9.2% increase. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Bradley appeared to be backing away from his pledge, made earlier 
this year, to donate his pay hike to charity. He clarified his position 
Thursday, saying he will take the $9,467 annual increase, but donate a large 
share of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I stand by my statement I made at the beginning of this whole process. Any pay 
raise I would turn over to charity," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's press secretary, Bill Chandler, said the mayor would take a 5% pay 
raise on July 1 -- and donate the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
Many council members could not be reached for comment Thursday on whether they 
would accept the raise. Councilman Joel Wachs, who had sought even higher pay 
raises for the elected officials, was in Europe on a trip that combines 
personal and city business. Council President John Ferraro, the author of the 
plan to link the pay raises to the ethics package, was in New York City.

VIOLENCE, RACIAL ILLS ON THE RISE IN SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: L.A. BOARD HEARS A GRIM ASSESSMENT OF CONFLICT SPAWNED BY INCREASING 
CULTURAL DIVERSITY THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Plagued by reports of increasing racial tension and violence on campuses, the 
Los Angeles school board met Thursday to hear officials describe conflicts 
wrought by the district's mushrooming cultural diversity. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing was sparked by reports of racial incidents, ranging from swastikas 
painted on the walls of a San Fernando Valley school to fights between Latino 
and black students on a high school campus in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
"The conflicts are not just in a few schools, but districtwide," Arlene Matsuo, 
head of the district's Multicultural Commission, told the board. 
</P>
<P>
At some schools, such as Sunland's Mount Gleason Junior High, racial tensions 
are exacerbated by developing gang rivalries and by conflicts between 
neighborhood and bused-in students, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"My staff is afraid," said Principal Patricia Joe. "There is minimal positive 
instruction going on right now." 
</P>
<P>
On other campuses, such as Jordan High School in Watts, the confrontations 
erupted between black and Latino students, separated by language and culture 
and sharing a campus that has changed rapidly from predominantly black to 
overwhelmingly Latino. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's second largest with more 
than 610,000 students, speaking more than 80 languages, has changed 
dramatically in 25 years. Enrollment has changed from 56% white in the 
mid-1960s to more than 85% minority -- 61% of that Latino -- today. 
</P>
<P>
Schools in inner-city areas, once predominantly black, have become primarily 
Latino or Asian as immigrants have moved in. The resulting tensions are often 
rooted in the fact that the students cannot speak one another's languages, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Many South Bay, Westside and San Fernando Valley schools that were virtually 
all white 25 years ago, now find white students a tiny minority. Their 
neighborhoods have changed from white to Latino, and the district has filled 
the schools with busloads of minority students from overcrowded inner-city 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission study found that the 
level of racial tension and misunderstanding among Los Angeles students is 
higher than in the general community, in part because of a growing intolerance 
of immigrant students. 
</P>
<P>
At some schools, such as Madison Junior High School in North Hollywood, the 
immigrant groups have faced off. There, fighting between Latino and Armenian 
students reached such a level this spring that groups of Armenian parents 
stormed onto the campus, protesting that they feared for their children's 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
While Los Angeles schools had an active multicultural education program during 
its mandatory desegregation program a decade ago, board members admit the 
district has done little recently to head off the mounting racial and ethnic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"You think these battles have been fought and won and that they stay won, but 
what this is telling us is that . . . we need a constant and consistent effort" 
to fight racial intolerance, said board member Rita Walters.

WILDLIFE ACT MAY COST CONSERVANCY $1 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
ASSEMBLY: A SUBCOMITTEE PROPOSES A BUDGET CUT FOR THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS 
AGENCY TO HELP QUICKLY FUND PROPOSITION 117.

<P>
An Assembly subcommittee on Thursday recommended that the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy budget for parkland acquisition be cut by $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
If the Legislature goes along with the recommendation, Joseph T. Edmiston, the 
conservancy's executive director, predicted that his agency's plans for about 
five projects, including public access and picnic areas at Mulholland Crest 
Park in Tarzana, would be stymied. 
</P>
<P>
The action of the Ways and Means subcommittee was prompted by the passage on 
Tuesday of Proposition 117, the Wildlife Protection Act of 1990, which requires 
spending $30 million annually over the next 30 years to buy and restore 
wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
Under the initiative, the conservancy is expected to receive $10 million 
annually for five years. 
</P>
<P>
To obtain new funds for wildlife protection as required by Proposition 117, 
however, the Legislature must move quickly to redirect funds from existing 
environmental programs and the state's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
As a first step, the Ways and Means subcommittee voted 4 to 0 to redirect $14 
million from four existing environmental programs, including $1 million from 
the 1988 Park Bond Act the conservancy planned to earmark for park programs. 
</P>
<P>
"What they've done is stolen park improvement money and given it to wildlife 
habitat," Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Lind, a Ways and Means consultant, said the subcommittee was not singling 
out the conservancy for cuts in the fiscal year that begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, Proposition 117 is forcing legislators to channel 
environmental funds into habitat conservation. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a solution that minimizes disruption to ongoing programs. . . . the $1 
million Santa Monica is being asked to give up is a small price to pay," Lind 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles), who represents parts of the 
Santa Monica Mountains, questioned the legality of the subcommittee action, 
vowing to lobby the full Ways and Means Committee to reverse the decision. 
</P>
<P>
But, he acknowledged, "it's going to take a miraculous effort." 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Budget and Fiscal Review Committee on Thursday sent the issue to the 
joint Assembly-Senate budget conference committee, which will begin meeting 
soon to hammer out the state's 1990-91 spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
Since the conservancy was formed in 1980, it has spent $69 million to purchase 
parkland in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 parkland bond act set aside $30 million for the conservancy, which has 
about $4 million left over, Edmiston said.

MUGGY WEEKEND WEATHER EXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANETTE AVENT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "ghoulish remains of Boris," a hurricane about 500 miles off the coast of 
San Diego, will smother San Diego with warm, muggy weather and clouds much of 
the weekend, according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
Boris has been downgraded from a hurricane, packing 100 m.p.h. winds, to a 
tropical depression, said forecaster Wilbur Shigehara. The disturbance is 
rapidly breaking up but will cast a pall today and Saturday, bringing a 
possible thunderstorm to the mountains and deserts and warm, muggy weather to 
other areas. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can live through Saturday, a cooling trend on Sunday will take all the 
muggies away," Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
The humidity will range from 45% to 60% inland and 60% to 75% along the coast. 
Normally, the humidity for this time of year is 65% coupled with cool 
temperatures, he said. But 65% humidity together with warmer than normal 
temperatures feels a lot more humid. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday will be cooler and sunny because of low pressure coming in from the Gulf 
of Alaska, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures at the beaches will range from 67 to 73 today and Saturday, 
cooling about three degrees on Sunday, Shigehara said. The surf is up, rolling 
in at 3 to 5 feet and the ocean is 66 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
In the coastal areas, temperatures today and Saturday will be 72 to 84, 
dropping as much as seven degrees on Sunday. Nights will be 60 to 67 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Inland areas will be 85 to 95 today and Saturday. On Sunday, the mercury could 
fall as much as 10 degrees as the low-pressure front comes in, Shigehara said. 
Nighttime temperatures will be 56 to 64 tonight and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in mountain areas will be 76 to 82 today, and 72 to 78 Saturday 
and Sunday. Nighttime lows will be 45 to 55. 
</P>
<P>
Desert temperatures will be 98 to 106 today and Saturday, dropping to 95 to 100 
Sunday. Nighttime temperatures will be 72 to 77 tonight, 65 to 77 Saturday, and 
drop a few more degrees Sunday.

HARASSMENT AT NAVAL ACADEMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is it any wonder that the women of Mills College will fight so desperately to 
keep their college from becoming a co-ed institution when one reads of the 
manner in which women at Annapolis, a co-ed institution, are treated by their 
male classmates? 
</P>
<P>
In response to those who claim that handcuffing Gwen Dreyer to a urinal was 
just "good-natured high jinks" and not yet another indication of society's 
tacit acceptance of violence against women, one might ask how many men at 
Annapolis have been handcuffed to a urinal, photographed and then taunted? 
Somehow I wouldn't be surprised to hear the answer is none. 
</P>
<P>
Other questions: Why is it men feel compelled to engage in such brutal forms of 
harassment under the guise of hazing? Why is it that not one of the students 
called on the carpet for such degrading behavior had the decency to admit that 
what they did was wrong? How can the U.S. Navy consider this kind of behavior 
in its future leaders anything but despicable? How can it consider its response 
to the situation anything but dishonorable?

The command structure at Annapolis that countenanced the climate that led to 
the outrageous attack on Dreyer, then winked at the perpetrators, should be 
immediately reassigned. 
</P>
<P>
As for those "good-natured" midshipmen, participants and the gawkers who could 
have stopped the stupidity, let them see what it's like to be ordinary seamen 
for a year or two. Maybe by then they will have a better understanding of the 
damage they have done to Ms. Dreyer and be more worthy of becoming officers.

JUANITA BESSIE GETCHELL; ARTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Juanita Bessie Getchell, a professional artist whose paintings sold in the 
United States and Europe, died Tuesday in Lancaster. She was 68. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Getchell began oil painting in 1975 and studied for a year under Millie 
Funk, a Western artist in California City. She painted original works and did 
some contract paintings that sold worldwide, her husband, Robert, said. One of 
her last paintings, "Route 66," depicted her family's venture west from 
Mississippi in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
She continued painting even when a kidney ailment forced her to undergo 
dialysis eight years ago, even taking her easel and paints to the hospital with 
her while receiving treatment. She died of heart failure related to her kidney 
disease, her husband said. 
</P>
<P>
Born Juanita Bessie Laws on Sept. 11, 1921, in Dennison, Tex., she worked as a 
telephone operator at the Sacramento Bee from the early 1960s to 1976. She was 
a member of the Allied Arts Assn. of Lancaster for about 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Getchell is survived by her husband of 10 years; a son, Rick Copeland of 
Sacramento; and a daughter, Kimberly Copeland of Sacramento. Donations may be 
sent in Mrs. Getchell's name to the Kidney Foundation of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. Saturday at Halley-Olsen Funeral 
Chapel, 44802 N. Date Ave. in Lancaster, which is handling the arrangements. 
Burial will be in Nevada City, Calif.

THE BIASED EYE OF THE BEHOLDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An actor's success can depend on whether he has the "look" a director has in 
mind. Life away from the stage also can be tough when someone decides you don't 
look the part. 
</P>
<P>
Ask Condoleezza Rice, a director of European and Soviet affairs on President 
Bush's National Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
When Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was in San Francisco this week, Rice 
lined up with other White House VIPS to say farewell. She and others wore pins 
to identify themselves as members of the U.S. delegation. Yet a Secret Service 
agent shoved Rice and told her to get away from the dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, writer Bruce Bean walked into a home improvement store to buy a 
drill. A clerk passed, eyeing him. Soon Bean -- but not the others shopping in 
the same department -- was surrounded by three extraordinarily attentive 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
The only certain thing Condoleezza Rice and Bruce Bean have in common is that 
they are both African-Americans. And that they are neither troublemakers nor 
thieves. But to some they apparently "looked" the part. 
</P>
<P>
Now, all sorts of excuses have been offered for the agent's treatment of Rice 
-- including the common excuse that "these things just happen." And so they do. 
Every day. To Bruce Bean in the hardware store, to a black person trying to 
hail a cab in New York. Even outside of Hollywood, everyday life can be full of 
indignities when one doesn't look the part.

MALL THREATENED WITH CLOSURE ASKS COURT TO MAKE BUILDER FINISH PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An attorney for the La Reina Fashion Plaza in Sherman Oaks asked Thursday for a 
court order to compel the shopping center's builder to widen the nearby 
intersection of Van Nuys and Ventura boulevards, the key to ensuring that the 
mall can remain open. 
</P>
<P>
The two-story mall, located on the site of the landmark La Reina movie theater 
on Ventura Boulevard, is operating without an occupancy permit because of the 
unfinished street project, empowering the city to shut it down at any time. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing on the mall's request was scheduled in Los Angeles Superior Court on 
June 22, said the attorney, Katherine B. Warwick. 
</P>
<P>
Warwick's client, Robert Dollar Building Associates Ltd. of San Francisco, 
bought the mall in January as part of an out-of-court settlement of a 
foreclosure suit against the original owner, a partnership controlled by 
Century City developer Dennis Bass. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of that agreement, Bass's firm was supposed to complete a 
street-widening project promised to the city when it obtained building permits. 
The firm, DES California Limited Partnership No. 1, was supposed to add a 
second left turn lane with its own signal light on Van Nuys Boulevard to ease 
traffic at one of the busiest intersections in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But 2 1/2 years after the mall opened, the public-works project has yet to 
begin. In an effort to force Bass to fulfill his agreement, Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky's office last month tried to revoke the mall's temporary occupancy 
permit -- only to discover that the permit had expired May 18. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have said they are more interested in getting the intersection 
widened than in closing the mall.

GOOD START BUT MORE TO DO; 
</P>
<P>
* ANOTHER BARRIER REMOVED IN SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Africa's President Frederik W. de Klerk has ended the harsh state of 
emergency which emboldened the police, censored the press, denied free speech 
and limited assembly in his troubled country. Though long overdue, the welcome 
step has removed a major barrier to negotiations between the white minority 
government and the black majority. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions were imposed in 1986. Since then, police have arrested and 
detained, often without charges, more than 30,000 people, most of them black 
men and women. The provisions also forced thousands into hiding and silenced 
most dissent in that divided nation. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency regulations remain intact in the Natal province, where at least 
4,000 people have died in fighting among rival black political groups. De Klerk 
should reconsider the state of emergency there because the harsh restrictions 
have not helped curb the killing. That responsibility lies largely with black 
leaders -- especially Zulu Chief Gatsha Buthelezi, whose Inkatha movement is 
involved in much of the violence. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk deserves credit for ending the oppressive emergency rule and the other 
steps he has taken to create a climate conducive to negotiating a nonracial 
democracy. He has freed Nelson Mandela, wrongly imprisoned by the government 
for 27 years, and unbanned the African National Congress. He met last month 
with Mandela in what was the first serious meeting between the white government 
and ANC since the anti-apartheid group was founded in 1912. And he kept his 
pledge to work for the repeal of public segregation. 
</P>
<P>
But while ending racial segregation in buses, restaurants, parks and other 
public places may make life a little less demeaning for black South Africans, 
it is at best a modest reform in a nation where, by law, the majority is 
segregated in housing, education and employment -- and still has no right to 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk has signaled he is ready to start serious negotiations to change that 
political system. But the ANC has set several conditions, including the return 
of exiles and amnesty for all political prisoners, who, like Mandela, fought 
against apartheid, before negotiations can begin. 
</P>
<P>
As the world watches, Mandela is taking his anti-apartheid crusade to the rest 
of Africa, Europe and North America. He is scheduled to visit the United States 
later this month, and will meet with President Bush. De Klerk had been 
scheduled for an earlier visit to the White House. But as opposition to that 
visit grew in this country, he postponed his trip in yet another demonstration 
of his keen political acumen. 
</P>
<P>
By lifting the state of emergency throughout most of South Africa, De Klerk has 
hastened change. But the international community must maintain its role by 
continuing economic sanctions to bring full equality closer for all South 
Africans.

NEW CURBS ON ASSAULT WEAPONS AND SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In your editorial "A Stand for Sensible Gun Control" (May 25) you again blindly 
call for gun control. Your lack of respect for the rights of citizens is 
shameful. 
</P>
<P>
What would The Times know about "sensible" gun control; never has The Times 
opposed any gun control laws. 
</P>
<P>
Have you ever seriously discussed the Second Amendment -- no. You time and time 
again repeat the tired old arguments of gun control activists. You choose to 
use emotion and political hype as justification for all your arguments. The 
Second Amendment has nothing to do with hunting, plinking or target shooting. 
We have the right to bear arms, to defend ourselves from thinking such as 
yours. 
</P>
<P>
Your assertion that criminals prefer "assault weapons" is yet another example 
of mindless hype. The FBI and the Justice Department studies have shown that 
these guns are not the favored weapons of drug dealers or other criminals. In 
Los Angeles in 1988, 4,160 firearms were confiscated, but only 120 could be 
considered "assault weapons," that is less than 3%. Los Angeles Police Chief 
Daryl Gates is nothing more than a political opportunist. 
</P>
<P>
Lies and distortion are expected from politicians. But, when a supposed public 
guardian like The Times uses the same tactics, a person must ask himself who is 
left to speak for the rights of a citizen.

FIRST LADY'S SPEECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have never actually had much interest in Barbara Bush but her refreshing 
speech at Wellesley College's commencement really impressed me (Part A, June 
2). 
</P>
<P>
As a university student, she reassures me that my values are set straight. She 
emphasizes her desire for women in the '90s to help create a better society. 
Also, she speaks of her passion for life (which shines through in this vital 
speech). But most of all, she urges the need for compassion for one another. I 
would be quite fortunate to follow in her footsteps. There is, after all, a 
heart in the White House.

OPPORTUNITY MISSED ON EASTSIDE TURF; 
</P>
<P>
IF THE EAST L.A. LIBERALS WANT A SUPERVISOR'S SEAT, THEY SHOULD GO AFTER ED 
EDELMAN'S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By XAVIER HERMOSILLO, Xavier Hermosillo is a governmental affairs consultant 
who has served as chief of staff to both Republican and Democratic members of 
the state Legislature. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon is correct in saying that the 115-year-old 
domination of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors by white males must 
be addressed and that Latinos and other ethnics be given the opportunity to 
have representation. 
</P>
<P>
However, one major point in the discussion of the civil-rights lawsuit seems to 
have fallen into a black hole. While liberal elected officials concentrated 
primarily in the East Los Angeles area are asking that district lines be 
redrawn, and while their focus of attack has been the 1st District and its 
retiring king, Pete Schabarum, they have thus far cleverly deceived the media 
and the public. 
</P>
<P>
Why are East Los Angeles politicians trying to break up the 1st District, which 
includes much of the San Gabriel Valley, when they could have challenged 3rd 
District Supervisor Ed Edelman in this week's election? 
</P>
<P>
Edelman's district, which includes East Los Angeles, has the same percentage of 
Latinos as the 1st District (47%) but actually contains more Latino residents 
(888,611 to 874,804), according to figures published in The Times on Tuesday. 
Additionally, Edelman's district even has fewer Anglos than the 1st District 
(605,879 to 732,809). 
</P>
<P>
Could it be that what we have here is the same "good old boy" network with a 
new twist -- entrenched East L.A. Latino politicians not wanting to rock the 
boat in their own back yard with Edelman? Does the old "Art Snyder syndrome" of 
an entrenched Anglo ruling the brown minority population still have to exist? 
</P>
<P>
Shouldn't Los Angeles City Council members Richard Alatorre and Gloria Molina 
and their supporters be rooting out the problem in their own turf before they 
come looking for political gold in the San Gabriel Valley? 
</P>
<P>
An often-heard line at the news conferences following both the Kenyon court 
decision and the announcement of Schabarum's retirement was "We (the Latino 
community) want to elect one of our own." But when Sarah Flores, Schabarum's 
former top deputy, was mentioned as being a possible winning candidate, they 
bristled. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the people of the 1st District spoke loud and clear in Tuesday's primary. 
They said they want to at least see a runoff in November between Flores and 
Schabarum's choice, Superior Court Judge Gregory O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that the people of the 1st District are also speaking to the 
traditional East L.A. political crowd and saying: "If you want a seat on the 
board, go after Ed Edelman because he represents the area with the most 
Latinos. Leave us alone. We don't want you." 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that many of us (I dare say probably most of us) in the 
Latino community don't see the need for expanding the Board of Supervisors. 
Clearly, with the phenomenal growth that we've experienced, the addition of two 
or four new supervisors might be more efficient, though certainly costly to 
county government. 
</P>
<P>
One thing, however, has become crystal clear. Those entrenched East L.A. 
politicians who clamor for rewriting the supervisorial lines, especially in the 
San Gabriel Valley communities of the 1st District, simply want ideological 
control of the board, nothing less. Otherwise, if all they wanted was any seat 
on the five-member panel, they would have gone after their crony Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
Those of us (both Latino and non-Latino voters) who do not espouse the liberal 
beliefs of politicians such as Molina, Alatorre or Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La 
Puente) have for years elected more conservative people, including some 
Democrats, to office. 
</P>
<P>
This year, many of us in the "other valley" at the foot of the San Gabriel 
Mountains plan to do the same thing and make history at the same time by 
casting our votes in the November runoff for a fairly conservative woman and 
Latina -- Sarah Flores. 
</P>
<P>
This will prove, among other things, that a Latino can be elected from this 
district and that perhaps, a good part of the real problem before was not the 
color of one's skin or the origin of one's forefathers, but rather that an 
18-year incumbent (Schabarum) with a couple of million dollars in his campaign 
chest was simply unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't that another part of the reason some of these Eastside public servants 
didn't take on Edelman? The answers for many of us are now rather obvious. 
Perhaps Judge Kenyon can see through the smoke screen and encourage the East 
L.A. crowd to run a candidate against Edelman . . . in four years.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : BONITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Bonita motorcyclist who struck and killed a nurse while she was jogging 
pleaded guilty Thursday to vehicular manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Just as his case was about to be assigned to a courtroom for trial, Jerald 
Covey, 30, entered his plea before Superior Court Judge William Mudd. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Rossi, 29, a mother of three, was jogging on Sweetwater Road near the 
Chula Vista Municipal Golf Course on Nov. 5, 1989, when Covey's motorcycle hit 
her. 
</P>
<P>
The case resulted in verbal barbs between the California Highway Patrol, which 
arrested Covey and mistakenly let him leave a hospital before his blood alcohol 
level could be tested, and the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing was set for July 19. 
</P>
<P>
Covey could be sentenced to a maximum of four years, although Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Jennifer Yackle said her office does not oppose a one-year jail term on 
the condition that his driving and alcohol consumption are restricted. 
</P>
<P>
Yackle said that, if Covey is granted probation and a one-year sentence, he 
could be sent to prison for four years if he violates any terms of probation 
involving drinking and driving. 
</P>
<P>
Covey was taken to a hospital after the accident because he was injured. 
However, he had not been given a sobriety test. Covey walked out of the 
hospital before being tested. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant was recaptured about 3 1/2 hours later, and his blood alcohol 
level was found to be .10%. He remains free on his own recognizance.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : OCEANSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Oceanside man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a Vista man who 
was shot to death May 31. Amos J. Johnson, 31, of the 200 block of Country Club 
Lane, was arrested at his home late Wednesday and is being held without bail at 
the County Jail in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies arrested Johnson in connection with the killing of Alexander 
Bazan, 25, of the 400 block of Sunrise Drive East. Bazan died of a single 
gunshot wound, Lt. John Tenwolde said. 
</P>
<P>
Tenwolde said Bazan was sitting in his car in a Vista restaurant parking lot at 
Sycamore Drive and California 78 when the shooting occurred shortly after 
midnight. Tenwolde said witnesses saw Johnson standing at Bazan's open car door 
on the driver's side. 
</P>
<P>
The two men were engaged in a struggle when Johnson pulled a handgun and shot 
Bazan in the chest, Tenwolde said. Bazan died at Palomar Medical Center about 
90 minutes after the shooting.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN MARCOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old San Marcos man who pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a 
14-year-old girl at a party last Labor Day weekend was sentenced Thursday to 
six years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a plea bargain, Pascual Rojero will spend some of the time in the 
custody of the California Youth Authority, Superior Court Judge Ronald Prager 
ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Rojero, who pleaded guilty to one count of rape with a foreign object, was the 
only adult present at the unchaperoned party when the sexual assault by several 
party-goers occurred, court records said. The 14-year-old was attacked after 
she had been drinking and lost consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
Three boys, ages 14, 15 and 16, were previously convicted in Juvenile Court of 
sexually assaulting and causing great bodily injury to the girl. They were 
sentenced to eight months in custody. 
</P>
<P>
Rojero's court-appointed attorney, Tom Mix, argued that, although Rojero 
instigated the assault and took off the girl's underpants, he did not 
physically harm her. Mix asked that Rojero be sentenced to three years in 
prison instead of six. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the prison term, Rojero was ordered to pay $1,000 restitution to 
the victim's family. 
</P>
<P>
The girl did not regain consciousness until the morning after the assault -- 
after she had been hospitalized for her injuries -- and did not learn the 
extent of attack until the matter went to court.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : NATIONAL CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old San Diego man died early Thursday morning after his car hit the 
center divider and another car while on Interstate 805 near National City, the 
California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Barber, a Navy corpsman at the Camp Pendleton Naval Hospital, was driving 
north on I-805 at between 90 and 100 m.p.h. when he swerved to avoid hitting 
another car, a CHP spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Barber's car hit the center divider, crossed back across the freeway and hit a 
car driven by Viengsith Phimmasouk of San Diego, which spun several times, 
according to the CHP. Barber's car then hit a tree, rolled over several times 
on an embankment and landed on its top. 
</P>
<P>
Three passengers in Barber's car, all 19 years old, were injured: Nora Nemkin 
of Santa Ana was taken to Mercy Hospital with moderate injuries; Stephanie 
Hamblin of Riverbank was taken to UC San Diego Medical Center with major 
injuries; Carlton Baros of Chula Vista received minor injuries and was not 
hospitalized. Phimmasouk received only minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 1:35 a.m., and Barber died at 2:32 a.m. at Mercy 
Hospital, the coroner's office said.

WORLD CUP '90; 
</P>
<P>
FINALLY, THERE WILL BE SOCCER; 
</P>
<P>
WORLD CUP: AFTER BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND BILLIONS OF WORDS OF BUILDUP, PLAY 
BEGINS IN A TOURNAMENT THAT HAS CHANGED LIVES AND THE COURSE OF NATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

MILAN, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Convicted for his loutish behavior at an Italian League game, a fan in Genoa 
not only was fined but was ordered to refrain from speaking to anyone else 
about soccer for the entire month of the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The Dominican monk Savonarola's fate was hardly worse in 1498, when he was 
found guilty of heresy in Florence because of his anti-Renaissance tirades. He 
was hanged, burned at the stake and his ashes were scattered into the Arno 
River. 
</P>
<P>
To prohibit an Italian from speaking about the World Cup now is a cruel and 
unusual punishment. Everyone except the unfortunate soul in Genoa is doing it, 
even if only to complain about the stifling traffic, the swarming tourists and 
the virtually incalculable cost. 
</P>
<P>
But today, attention finally will be diverted to the marshy field at Giuseppe 
Meazza Stadium in the San Siro section of Milan, where defending champion 
Argentina opens the 24-team, 52-game, 12-city tournament against Cameroon 
before an anticipated capacity crowd of 83,000. 
</P>
<P>
When the championship game is played in Rome's renovated Olympic Stadium on 
July 8, Argentina expects to be there. Other contenders such as Italy, Brazil, 
West Germany and the Netherlands find only minimal comfort in the criticism 
that Argentina is a one-man team. That is like calling the Hope diamond a 
one-stone piece of jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Other players such as the Netherlands' Marco Van Basten, Italy's Gianaluca 
Vialli, Brazil's Bebeto and West Germany's Juergen Klinsmann may emerge as the 
sport's reigning superstar. But it will not be easy to wrest the title from a 
fit and trim Diego Maradona, the elusive midfielder who led Argentina to the 
1986 championship in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Maradona is blessed, and not only with remarkable talent. An important goal in 
Mexico elicited protests from his English opponents that he had hit the ball 
with his hand. No, no, he said: "From the hand of God to the foot of Maradona." 
</P>
<P>
Cameroon also is seeking spiritual assistance. Clairvoyants in the capital of 
Yaounde have refused to help for less than $4,000, but they offered the Lions, 
as the team is known at home, one free piece of advice: Take a ritual bath 
before each game. 
</P>
<P>
That is more practical -- and also a good deal cleaner -- than the United Arab 
Emirates' approach. The team brought 10 camels for good luck, although the 
beasts so far have had none themselves. They are held up in customs. 
</P>
<P>
Cameroon and the United Arab Emirates are longshots, but not the longest. That 
dubious distinction belongs to the United States, which qualified for the World 
Cup from the North and Central American and Caribbean region for the first time 
since 1950. 
</P>
<P>
Unless it produces at least a victory and a tie in its three first-round games 
-- Sunday in Florence against Czechoslovakia, June 14 in Rome against Italy, 
and June 19 in Florence against Austria -- it probably will not fulfill its 
optimistic goal of reaching the second round. It has been suggested in the 
world press that the United States will be fortunate to score a goal. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps we are further along than a lot of you think," U.S. Coach Bob Gansler 
said at a press conference this week. "We're not here as tourists." 
</P>
<P>
He did, however, take his 22 players a few days ago to the Leaning Tower of 
Pisa, which is located in an open area known, apropos to the U.S. mission, as 
the Field of Miracles. 
</P>
<P>
No one will be cheering for a miracle more heartily than officials from the 
International Federation of Assn. Football, the sport's governing body. They 
believe that any success for the U.S. team will help build momentum for the 
1994 World Cup, which FIFA awarded to the United States in an effort to conquer 
its last frontier. 
</P>
<P>
While the people of the United States remain largely indifferent to the world's 
most prestigious sporting championship, Italia '90 organizers estimate that 
this World Cup will be seen on television in 170 countries. An estimated 1.1 
billion people will watch the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
For Italy, according to the International Herald Tribune, the World Cup will 
generate $8 billion in revenue, including $4.4 billion in construction 
contracts, $1.3 billion in souvenir sales, $300 million spent by tourists, $163 
million in ticket sales, $71 million in television rights fees and at least $40 
million for mascot licensing rights. 
</P>
<P>
But to refurbish 10 stadiums and build two others, as well as to improve rail 
links, subways, parking lots and highways, the Italian government spent $4.39 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Because that is twice as much as originally projected, some members of 
Parliament, including former Italian World Cup star Gianni Rivera, have called 
for a government investigation. As with many problems in Italy, most people 
just blame the Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
The cost has been high to Italy not only in lire. Twenty-four workers were 
killed and 600 injured in construction accidents. Most occurred at the 
stadiums, some of which are still obscured by scaffolding as last-minute work 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
The stadium in Milan is completed, but the field is suspect after re-sodding. 
Italian League games scheduled there had to be moved after players referred to 
the field as a potato patch. The stadium in Rome was blessed last week by the 
Pope, a goalkeeper as a youth in Poland, but it has been cursed by a leaky 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
On the up side, all spectators with legitimate tickets at the 12 stadiums will 
have individually numbered seats. The traditional standing-room-only terraces 
have been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
That was one measure taken to combat fan violence. Unfortunately for the 
Italian government, many of the incidents are expected to be provoked outside 
stadiums by so-called hooligans or lager louts. Officials in the 12 World Cup 
sites have been authorized to suspend the sale of alcoholic beverages 24 hours 
before games. 
</P>
<P>
The leading exporters of hooligans are England and the Netherlands, which, 
perhaps not so coincidentally, were assigned to play their first-round games on 
the islands of Sardinia and Sicily. 
</P>
<P>
England is trying to do its part. In a 10-2 victory over a Sardinian club 
Wednesday night, an English player, Steve McMahon, kicked a ball into the net 
for Sardinia and dedicated the goal to anti-hooliganism. 
</P>
<P>
A security force of 42,000, including 11,000 who were trained specifically for 
this event, already has scored one victory. 
</P>
<P>
Englishmen Paul Scarrot, who is to hooliganism what Abu Nidal is to terrorism, 
boasted last week that he could not be caught. 
</P>
<P>
"Police are afraid of me," he told a London newspaper, which published a 
picture of him standing in front of Rome's Colosseum. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four hours later, a drunken Scarrot, wearing a Union Jack draped around 
his neck, was arrested at the Rome train station and deported. 
</P>
<P>
Although police may be able to curb violence in the streets and stadiums of 
Italy, there is virtually nothing anyone can do about the madness the World Cup 
is expected to inspire in other parts of the world. No other sport evokes such 
passion among its followers. 
</P>
<P>
After Austria had eliminated West Germany in 1978, a West Berliner leaped from 
a window, shouting, "I don't want to live any more." During that game, a man in 
a Frankfurt restaurant tried to strangle another customer who cheered for 
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, a man in Colombia was so upset when his wife turned off the television 
during a game that he shot her. He turned the TV back on, watched the rest of 
the game, then called the police to turn himself in. 
</P>
<P>
When Italy upset Brazil in 1982, three people in Rio de Janeiro committed 
suicide and five others collapsed and died of heart attacks. Also in Brazil, 
the economy almost collapsed in 1986, when the nation went into mourning after 
a loss on penalty kicks to France. 
</P>
<P>
"When you win, people are happy and smiling," said Joseph Blatter, FIFA's 
general secretary. "When you lose a match, you have a breakdown in a country's 
economy. It's scary, but that's football." 
</P>
<P>
It might be difficult for Americans to understand how a game with so little 
scoring could become so popular. Even FIFA would like to see more offense, 
threatening referees with suspensions and players with substantial fines if 
rules against flagrant fouls are not strictly followed. 
</P>
<P>
When the game flows, there are few sports as aesthetically beautiful, with 
players trying to create time and space while pushing the ball toward the goal. 
To watch Maradona maneuver in the midfield is to watch Toscanini conduct, 
Baryshnikov dance and Pavarotti sing. 
</P>
<P>
And the perfect complement? The beautiful country of Italy.

NBA FINALS: DREXLER'S FREE THROWS FINALLY DEFUSE LAIMBEER'S BOMBS IN OVERTIME. 
THE NEXT THREE GAMES ARE IN PORTLAND.

<P>
Shots poured in from Bill Laimbeer, a hail of three-pointers that helped the 
Detroit Pistons overcome a 12-point deficit in the second quarter, a five-point 
deficit with 5:38 left in regulation and then take a four-point lead in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
What it came down to, though, were two free throws by Portland's Clyde Drexler. 
He made both with 2.1 seconds remaining in the extra five-minute period to give 
the Trail Blazers a 106-105 victory Thursday night at the Palace of Auburn 
Hills in Game 2 of the NBA finals, snapping the Pistons' 10-game home winning 
streak in the playoffs and tying the best-of-seven series. 
</P>
<P>
Laimbeer tied Michael Cooper's record for three-point baskets in a final with 
six. Two came in succession and helped Detroit climb back from an 86-81 deficit 
to an 89-86 lead, only to have the Trail Blazers force the overtime when Terry 
Porter's free throw with 10.2 seconds remaining made it 94-94. 
</P>
<P>
At 96-96, Laimbeer hit his first of three three-pointers in overtime. The next, 
with 1:30 to play, gave the Pistons a 102-98 edge. Again, the Trail Blazers 
responded, eventually going ahead, 104-102, on Buck Williams' two free throws 
with 9.6 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Laimbeer, once more. He came out nearly to half court to accept the entry pass, 
turned, faced the basket and looked to pass. Seeing no outlet, he dribbled in a 
few steps and bombed over Drexler. Good, with 4.1 seconds showing. 
</P>
<P>
Drexler had failed. His assignment was to make sure Laimbeer didn't wind up 
again from long range, whatever methods it took. 
</P>
<P>
"I was supposed to be the guy to dive and tackle Laimbeer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There was an obvious chance for redemption, so when Drexler got the ball at the 
top of the three-point circle, he drove toward the right side of the key and 
was fouled on a hand-check by Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
Drexler said he was definitely fouled. Rodman didn't stay around to give his 
side of the story. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, Drexler made both free throws for the last of his 33 points. He was 
one of four Trail Blazers to reach double figures. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the only thing on my mind," Drexler said of making his two tries. 
"Total concentration." 
</P>
<P>
The 2.1 seconds that remained gave the Pistons several chances to win, even 
though they were playing without Isiah Thomas, who fouled out with 1:10 to play 
after scoring 23 points. Portland, with a foul to give, made a wise tactical 
decision by wrapping up James Edwards as soon as he caught the ball, forcing 
Detroit to take the ball out again, this time with only 1.5 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
The ball came back to Edwards, but this time his shot was swatted away by Cliff 
Robinson. Edwards scored 26 points, tying Laimbeer for team-high honors. 
</P>
<P>
"It was emotion like, 'I can't believe this,' " said Portland center Kevin 
Duckworth, who fouled out with 49 seconds left. "We were up, and then started 
screwing around. Laimbeer started hitting and they came back. Then Clyde hit 
the free throws. There's nothing I can do as a player but sit back and watch." 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers gained some respect and took away the Pistons' home-court 
advantage, with the series heading to Oregon for three games. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people finally realize we didn't get here on a fluke," said Porter, 
the Portland guard who had 21 points, 10 assists and only one turnover. "We 
played the world champions close for two straight ball games. Right now, we're 
sitting pretty." 
</P>
<P>
Though trailing at halftime, the Pistons had at least one encouraging sign: 
Edwards, 30 of 71 from the field during the last eight outings -- including two 
of nine in Game 1 -- made his first five shots for the first 10 points of the 
game for Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers stayed close with their own inside scoring, Duckworth 
exploiting Laimbeer's lack of defensive quickness. The Portland center, coming 
off a 17-point, eight-rebound effort in Game 1, scored 11 of his team's first 
17 points. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Detroit had a 25-17 lead. After Rodman's free throw with 1:53 to play, 
the Piston cushion reached 30-19. At quarter's end, it was 30-23. 
</P>
<P>
A basket from Laimbeer 31 seconds into the second period seemed to indicate the 
Pistons would continue what for them is an abundance of offense. But it just 
marked trouble, Detroit going without another field goal until Joe Dumars hit 
from the left side with 5:57 to play in the second quarter. The one Detroit 
point in a 15-1 Trail Blazer run was Dumars cashing in on Portland being called 
for a second illegal defense. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the Trail Blazers had a 38-33 advantage. That went to 45-37 with 4:30 
remaining and 53-45 at the break. The Pistons shot 32% (six of 19) in the 
second quarter and were outscored, 30-15. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards had 16 points at halftime and teammate Isiah Thomas 14 more, but that 
still wasn't enough to offset a Trail Blazer team that hit at 51.1%. More 
important, the Trail Blazers had only two turnovers, compared to 13 for the 
Pistons that led to 20 Portland points. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit got as close as two points twice in the third quarter -- both thanks to 
Edwards baskets in the lane. The last time was at 59-57, at which time the 
Trail Blazers regained more control. 
</P>
<P>
A 9-4 run gave Portland some room, 68-61. That held up through the end of the 
third quarter, when the lead was 75-69, the Pistons having managed just five 
field goals in the last 7:26.

MORNING BRIEFING: WILSON JUST COULDN'T HACK ANY MORE HITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARLEY TINKHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hack Wilson and Casey Stengel, two of baseball's giants, were together with 
Brooklyn in 1934, but it was the wrong time for both. 
</P>
<P>
In his book "Stengel," Robert W. Creamer tells of Stengel's problem in removing 
pitcher Walter Beck, who was getting shelled in Philadelphia: 
</P>
<P>
"In right field for the Dodgers was Hack Wilson, who after several years of 
starring and drinking with the Chicago Cubs had been traded to Brooklyn, where 
after one good season he concentrated mostly on drinking. 
</P>
<P>
"If he had been asked, Wilson would have agreed with Stengel's evaluation of 
Beck's pitching. Hack was exhausted from chasing baseballs hit by the Phils off 
the tin fence behind, and as Casey talked to his pitcher, Wilson leaned over 
with his hands on his knees, his head down, his eyes closed. On the mound Beck 
argued with Stengel. 
</P>
<P>
"Give me the ball," said Stengel. 
</P>
<P>
"No," said Beck, who turned and flung the ball into right field, over Wilson's 
head against the tin wall. The startled Wilson, his head still down, thought it 
was another base hit and leaped into action. He raced back, fielded the ball 
off the wall, and turned and threw a perfect strike to second base." 
</P>
<P>
Beck was known as Boom Boom Beck after that. Wilson was soon gone to 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What was Hack Wilson's first name? 
</P>
<P>
Add Stengel: After the 1955 loss to the Dodgers in the World Series, a tearful 
Billy Martin told Howard Cosell, "A man like that shouldn't have to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Writes Creamer: "Defeat to Martin was destructive, a form of death, and he must 
have thought Stengel somehow had been destroyed, or at least badly damaged. 
What Billy never did understand was that Stengel was never destroyed by defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to win just as badly as Billy did but was as used to adversity. He 
had lost before. He knew how to ride the trouble, like a smart boxer, to keep 
his poise, until things cleared up and we was able to fight again." 
</P>
<P>
Just asking: From Bruce Keidan of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: "We take it for 
granted that human athletes get bigger, stronger and faster with each passing 
generation. So why not race horses? Why doesn't selective breeding of 
thoroughbreds produce a quantum-leap colt or a Flo Jo filly, capable of running 
faster than, say, Secretariat?" 
</P>
<P>
Drop me a line if you know the answer. I'll pass it along. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Pittsburgh center fielder Andy Van Slyke after making two errors in 
one inning in a game: "I'd rather have my wisdom teeth pulled than play a 5 
o'clock game." HARLEY TINKHAM

TV-RADIO: RILEY STORY SO HOT MCDONNELL CLAIMS HE GOT BURNED ON IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the last few weeks, there has been a lot of speculation that Pat Riley will 
not be back next season as the Laker coach. 
</P>
<P>
On May 23, KMPC's Jim Healy said, "He's Sayonara City." 
</P>
<P>
In this space two weeks ago, it was reported that it was a good possibility 
that Riley and Detroit Coach Chuck Daly would end up at NBC next season. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Joe McDonnell, on his KFI talk show, reported that Riley and owner 
Jerry Buss had met and that Riley was gone. According to McDonnell, someone 
from KCBS called to ask about it. 
</P>
<P>
That night on KCBS, Keith Olbermann had a report similar to McDonnell's. Monday 
night, he repeated the story, but before going on the air, Olbermann had a 
station publicist call media outlets to alert them. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, word of Olbermann's report appeared in The Times and a news 
service story, and was mentioned on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell called foul. 
</P>
<P>
"He stole the story," McDonnell said. "He didn't have to give me credit by 
name, or even my station, but he could have at least mentioned, 'According to a 
local radio report.' " 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell said that Olbermann called him Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"He admitted he had been tipped to the story by my report," McDonnell said. 
"Yet he told me he didn't have to give anyone else credit. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Fred Roggin steals stories, not me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Add feud: Olbermann was called for comment, but KCBS chose to have News 
Director Michael Singer respond. He said: "For Joe McDonnell to say Keith 
Olbermann stole his story is ludicrous . . . it's preposterous slander. 
</P>
<P>
"Keith is a journalist. He knows how to break a story. He had his own sources 
for his report. Doesn't Joe McDonnell know how this business works? 
</P>
<P>
"Keith Olbermann has broken more stories than anyone else in town. It's great 
that other reporters in town are now breaking stories, but they have a long way 
to go to catch Keith. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe McDonnell has never broken a story in his life." 
</P>
<P>
Responded McDonnell: "For Michael Singer to call Keith Olbermann a journalist 
is ludicrous. Ask Florence Griffith Joyner what she thinks of Keith as a 
journalist. 
</P>
<P>
"After he accused her of being on steroids, and it was proven false, he should 
have been fired. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime he wants to compare exclusives, I'll sit down with him." 
</P>
<P>
Riley probably is gone and will end up at NBC. One thing holding up an 
announcement is that NBC agreed not to name its commentators for next season 
until this one has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA doesn't want anything to detract from the championship series. Also, 
Daly is currently busy trying to win another title. 
</P>
<P>
It should be noted here that Olbermann was right on the money Monday night with 
a report that an arbitration hearing had been called off and that Al Michaels 
would be back in the ABC fold within two or three days. 
</P>
<P>
Add Michaels: According to USA Today, Michaels' new contract with ABC will pay 
him $15 million over six years. Michaels' old contract would have paid him an 
average of $2 million a year through 1993. 
</P>
<P>
KCBS wasn't doing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar any favors by putting him in a director's 
chair during the NBA postgame show Tuesday. He appeared a little stiff anyway, 
and the set didn't help. The chairs used Thursday were much more appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
It's obvious that Abdul-Jabbar needs more work before sending off audition 
tapes to NBC, but his questions are good. Better than the long-winded ones Tony 
Hernandez directed at Detroit's John Salley after Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
And someone should have told Portland's Buck Williams Tuesday there wasn't a 
game the next night. 
</P>
<P>
Ratings game: No question CBS misses the Lakers. Game 1 got an 11.8 national 
Nielsen rating, the lowest rating for an NBA finals prime-time telecast since 
CBS began doing them in 1982. Last year, Game 1 drew a 14.0 national rating. 
</P>
<P>
Oops Dept.: ESPN analyst Bill Robinson, a former outfielder with the New York 
Yankees, Philadelphia Phillies and Pittsburgh Pirates, was asked by John 
Saunders Wednesday night about pitchers retaliating. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, a little wound up, said hitters expected their pitchers to retaliate, 
and that if the pitcher didn't, a player might "drop a foul ball, or do 
something to lose a game for the pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
During a commercial break, someone clued Robinson into what he had said, that 
he was talking about throwing a game. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a way of running off at the mouth," Robinson said on the air. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Christensen, new NBC football analyst, will probably be paired with 
Charlie Jones. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that's the case," Christensen said. "Charlie's a great guy." 
</P>
<P>
Merlin Olsen, Jones' partner last season, is close to signing with CBS. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, by the way, makes his SportsChannel debut on tonight's Angel telecast. 
</P>
<P>
Add Christensen: He said one thing he would like to clear up is the perception 
of him as arrogant. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason, that adjective and me get put together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's because of my work on 'Sportslook.' When you're a critic, you can't 
come across as milquetoast." 
</P>
<P>
Christensen also will work as an NBC track commentator. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my favorite sport," he said. "I grew up in Eugene (Ore.) and competed in 
track in high school." 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball's Funniest Pranks," produced by Steve Rotfeld and distributed by Berl 
Rotfeld, will be televised on Channel 7 Sunday at 1:30 p.m. Jay Johnstone is 
the host. It's on opposite the NBA finals on CBS, but it may be worth taping. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda is featured in several segments. In one, he talks 
about putting the head of a roasted pig in former Dodger Steve Sax's bed. Sax 
thought an angry fan had done it. Sax told Lasorda the thing that scared him 
the most were the eyes. "You've never seen anything like them," Sax told 
Lasorda. The eyes were actually olives. In another segment, Lasorda talks about 
how, on April Fool's Day, he told Chris Gwynn and John Wetteland they had been 
traded. 
</P>
<P>
The Rotfelds, a Philadelphia father-son team who have shows all over the dial, 
will have specials about football and basketball pranks later in the year. Lyle 
Alzado will be the host of the football show, Charles Barkley and Rick Mahorn 
the co-hosts of the basketball show. 
</P>
<P>
Don King and Bob Arum, working on a fight promotion together for the first time 
in 10 years, will appear on Prime Ticket's "It's Your Call" Wednesday at 6 p.m. 
to talk about the HBO June 16 doubleheader at Caesars Palace -- Mike Tyson vs. 
Henry Tillman and George Foreman vs. Adilson Rodrigues. New Clipper Coach Mike 
Shuler will also appear. . . . Foreman will be Gabe Kaplan's guest tonight on 
KLAC's "Sportsnuts." 
</P>
<P>
On its boxing show next Tuesday night, the USA network will ask viewers to vote 
for the heavyweight fight they'd most like to see: Buster Douglas vs. Evander 
Holyfield, Douglas vs. Tyson, or Tyson vs. Foreman. The results will be 
announced the following Tuesday. . . . KCBS has announced the addition of a 
regular sports memorabilia segment to the Sunday night "Keith Olbermann Show." 
Joining Olbermann will be Matt Federgreen, proprietor of the Beverly Hills 
Baseball Card shop. 
</P>
<P>
A history lesson: CBS, which loses the NBA to NBC next season, has had the 
league since 1973-74. The first announcing team was Pat Summerall and Elgin 
Baylor. Baylor was fired in mid-season and replaced by Rick Barry. Hot Rod 
Hundley was the pregame host. The next season, Brent Musburger and Oscar 
Robertson were paired up. Robertson was a bust and was fired after the season. 
Jerry West was the backup commentator that season with Don Criqui.

RIJO'S PITCHING SPEAKS FOR ITSELF IN REDS' 6-1 VICTORY OVER ASTROS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jose Rijo did the pitching for Manager Lou Piniella, who did the talking for 
his pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Rijo allowed one hit over seven innings and retired 21 of the first 23 batters 
he faced as the Cincinnati Reds defeated the Astros at Houston, 6-1, Thursday 
night, but then declined to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
Piniella was happy to. 
</P>
<P>
"He pitched as well as I've seen him this year," Piniella said. "His arm 
stiffened up and that's why we took him out. We'll take seven good innings like 
that every time." 
</P>
<P>
Rijo (4-1) retired the first 13 Astros he faced before walking Franklin Stubbs 
in the fifth inning. Two batters later, Ken Caminiti lined a single to center 
for Houston's first hit. 
</P>
<P>
Rijo, who gained his fourth consecutive victory and improved to 6-1 lifetime 
against the Astros, struck out three and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros, who have lost seven games in a row, got their only run off Norm 
Charlton on one-out singles by Ramirez, Casey Candaele and pinch-hitter Glenn 
Wilson. Rob Dibble pitched the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds got all they needed in the first inning off Bill Gullickson (3-4) on 
Barry Larkin's sacrifice fly and a run-scoring triple by Eric Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Mariano Duncan hit a solo homer in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 3, Chicago 1 -- Lenny Dykstra extended his hitting streak to 20 
games with a tie-breaking RBI double in the seventh inning at Chicago and Ken 
Howell won his fourth consecutive decision as the Phillies handed the Cubs 
their fifth loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Dykstra leads the majors with a .414 average and is batting .447 (38 for 85) 
during his 20-game streak. 
</P>
<P>
Howell (7-3), who has not lost since May 5, allowed five hits, walked three and 
struck out eight. Mike Bielecki (3-4) allowed six hits and two runs in 6 1/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's Andre Dawson hit the 334th homer of his career and 15th of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 5, New York 4 -- Barry Bonds doubled home the tie-breaking run in 
the eighth inning after Bobby Bonilla reached base on center fielder Keith 
Miller's error and the surging Pirates beat the Mets at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Neal Heaton, who has an 8-1 record, took a 4-0 lead into the fifth, but the 
Mets scored three runs after an error by third baseman Wally Backman. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets tied it on Gregg Jefferies' RBI single in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 3, St. Louis 2 -- Tim Wallach's run-scoring double broke a 
sixth-inning tie to give the Expos a victory over the Cardinals at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Jose DeLeon (5-4) had a one-hitter and a 2-1 lead until the Expos scored twice 
in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Zane Smith (3-3) earned his first victory since April 20 by allowing two runs 
and eight hits in seven innings.

SVENSSON READY FOR TENNIS MATCH OR TRIP TO AGASSI'S CIRCUS 
</P>

Who's the real bozo? 
</P>
<P>
Could it be Andre Agassi, who called Philippe Chatrier and the French Tennis 
Federation "a bunch of bozos" for criticizing his attire? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe. Agassi's French Open semifinal opponent today, Sweden's Jonas Svensson, 
sort of put Agassi in such a category. 
</P>
<P>
"I will play two people," Svensson said. "Agassi the player and Agassi the 
clown. He clowns around like Noah or McEnroe. If he acts that way in the match, 
I'll have to be cool." 
</P>
<P>
Svensson complained to Swedish writers that Agassi often hits the ball back 
hard during warmups, something that others do not do. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Svensson nor Agassi has ever reached a Grand Slam final. In the other 
semifinal, Thomas Muster of Austria plays 30-year-old Andres Gomez of Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
The lingering controversy over Agassi's attire has not managed to overshadow 
the effectiveness of his tennis. His pink tights have been much tighter than 
his matches. Agassi swamped Jim Courier in the fourth round, Michael Chang in 
the quarterfinals and is looking forward to playing Svensson. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played him twice and beaten him twice, so I'll be confident going in," 
Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez is adopting much the same attitude toward his showdown with Muster. 
</P>
<P>
A 10-year veteran playing in his 25th Grand Slam tournament, Gomez is beyond 
the quarterfinals for the first time. He has won two tournaments this year, but 
lost to Muster in the semifinals of the Italian Open two weeks ago, their only 
meeting on clay. Gomez beat Muster in their other match at the 1987 U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't come here to get to the quarters or the semis, I came here to win," 
Gomez said. "With all the talk about Chesnokov and Muster and Leconte, I have 
been pushed aside. Now I'm here and most of the others are gone."

Weston Hatch, a basketball star at Fremont School in Oakland who collapsed and 
died during a scrimmage, suffered an enlarged heart, according to the Alameda 
County Coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
The condition, known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, happens when the heart 
muscle gets so big that the vessels are unable to supply enough blood to the 
heart and heart muscles, said coroner's spokesman Lt. Duane Gull. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch, a senior, had just scored on a dunk in Wednesday's game and was heading 
to the other end of the court when he fell face first on to the court. A school 
nurse attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation before paramedics rushed Hatch to 
Highland Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
He was pronounced dead on arrival. 
</P>
<P>
The high school campus was closed Thursday morning as students mourned the 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch, a 6-foot-6 center, was a first team All-Oakland Athletic League player 
who averaged 20 points and 12 rebounds a game.

LAIMBEER'S LONG SHOTS NOT QUITE ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Records were set or tied Thursday night, but none was better than the six 
three-point baskets by Piston Bill Laimbeer, losing effort or not. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great performance," teammate Isiah Thomas said. "Too bad we had to 
waste it." 
</P>
<P>
Laimbeer, a 6-foot-11, 245-pounder who has made his tough-guy reputation 
playing inside but leaves his offensive mark with outside jump shots, was one 
of two on three-pointers in the first quarter. He was zero for one in the third 
quarter. In the fourth, he went two for two, 35 seconds apart that first tied 
the game and then put Detroit ahead, 89-86. 
</P>
<P>
By sinking three of four attempts in overtime, he finished six of nine, the 
most memorable numbers in a game in which he totaled 26 points and 11 rebounds. 
The six three-pointers tied the finals mark of Michael Cooper, the Laker guard 
who made six against the Boston Celtics on May 27, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Other Game 2 achievements: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The nine three-point attempts by Laimbeer broke Cooper's record of eight, 
done twice. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Portland's Terry Porter went 15 of 15 from the line to set a finals record 
for most successes without a miss. Magic Johnson had the former mark of 14, set 
May 16, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The eight three-pointers by the Pistons broke the team record of seven held 
by Boston since the May 27, 1985, game against the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- This was the first overtime in a finals since the Celtics beat the Lakers, 
129-125, June 6, 1984, at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The loss broke Detroit's playoff winning streak for 1990 at 10 and overall 
at 14. Both tied previous marks. 
</P>
<P>
One Piston streak survived. This was the fifth time that Detroit loss when an 
opponent has scored at least 100 points. 
</P>
<P>
Piston James Edwards may have snapped out of his shooting slump by starting 
five of five and finishing 13 of 23 for 26 points, but Vinnie Johnson continues 
to struggle. 
</P>
<P>
He came in having made just two of 21 attempts the previous three games, going 
back to the Eastern Conference finals against Chicago. Thursday, he went one of 
four. 
</P>
<P>
Portland took advantage. Trail Blazer reserves outscored their Piston 
counterparts, 20-13, though Drazen Petrovic led with the way with only eight 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Game 3 is Sunday afternoon at Portland, where the Pistons have lost 20 in a 
row, a streak that dates back to Oct. 19, 1974 and includes a 20-point defeat 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons say they will again show road games during the finals on the 
big-screen television at the Palace, with the $3 admission going to charity. 
Impressively, Game 4 last year against the Lakers at the Forum drew a sellout 
crowd of 21,454. . . . In reaction to the death of Hank Gathers, the NBA is 
using more extensive heart examinations during the final scouting combine for 
pro-bound college players. The tests Tuesday and Wednesday in Chicago revealed 
that one player had cardiovascular abnormalities that could put his future in 
the sport in question, according to Northwestern University physician Mark 
Upton, who helped administered the screenings. The player's name is being 
withheld and more thorough evaluations are planned. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle attended the game. . . . The 15 points in the second

WCC WILL GET A NEW LOOK IN BASKETBALL AND BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The West Coast Conference will have a different basketball format this season, 
and baseball will have a new look in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The WCC has traditionally played its men's and women's basketball games at 
alternating sites, with the women on the road when the men are at home and vice 
versa. 
</P>
<P>
Starting next fall, the teams will play conference games in doubleheaders in an 
attempt to get more interest in the women's programs. Men's games will start at 
the usual 7:30 p.m., with the women's games starting before or afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"The women's coaches just wanted the exposure," Loyola Athletic Director Brian 
Quinn said. "Hopefully it will increase attendance." 
</P>
<P>
In baseball, the conference announced this week that Nevada Reno, only aligned 
with the WCC in baseball, will not be in the conference schedule after 1991, 
reducing the league to six teams who will play a round-robin schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The WCC's executive committee cited travel costs as the primary factor. Teams 
have also had weather problems in early season trips to Reno. Loyola Marymount 
was snowed out of a series in Reno in February. 
</P>
<P>
Reno is a member of the Big Sky Conference, which doesn't play baseball. WCC 
teams will continue to schedule games with the Wolf Pack, but the new alignment 
will allow teams to play all their conference games in California -- at Loyola, 
Pepperdine and San Diego in the Southland and St. Mary's, San Francisco and 
Santa Clara in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn said upcoming NCAA meetings might also have an impact on the WCC's 
baseball future. In January, the NCAA will consider limiting schedules to 56 
games. The current limit is 60 games and some teams that advance through the 
playoffs play more than 70 games. 
</P>
<P>
The WCC season involves 36 conference games and Quinn said a 56-game limit 
might make it difficult to schedule enough quality nonconference opponents. 
This year the Lions played 62 games and lost a few to bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn said the limit "could really affect our conference. You've got to play 
good people from the Pac-10 and Big West to impress the NCAA. You have to beat 
those people to really have a shot at the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Dropping Reno will limit WCC teams to 30 conference games. 
</P>
<P>
Junior outfielder Rick Mediavilla of Loyola Marymount was named to the 
All-District 8 baseball first team. The District 8 region covers the Southwest. 
The second team included Loyola catcher Miah Bradbury, outfielder Tony Kounas 
and relief pitcher Darryl Scott. Chris Martin of Pepperdine was named first 
team shortstop and Wave pitcher Britt Craven made the second team. 
</P>
<P>
Martin was selected in the second round of the amateur draft this week by 
Montreal and Bradbury was taken in the fifth round by the Miami Miracle, a 
Class A team from the Florida State League. Kounas was selected in the 21st 
round by Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco basketball player Joel DeBortoli and San Diego basketball player 
Paula Mascari were named the West Coast Conference's scholar-athletes of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
DeBortoli, an all-conference forward who finished 13th on USF's all-time 
scoring list, graduated with a 3.71 grade-point average in business. Mascari, 
who set a USD career record for assists with 245, graduated with a 3.67 
grade-point average in communications and also did volunteer work with AIDS 
patients through a school program and helped build low-cost senior housing in 
Tijuana.

FRAZIER NAMED TRACK AND FIELD ASSISTANT AT NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former UCLA All-American shotputter John Frazier has been hired as a Cal State 
Northridge track and field assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
He will be in charge of the shotput, discus, javelin and hammer throw. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier, the 1981 state shotput champion at Antelope Valley High, placed sixth 
in the 1985 NCAA championships and eighth in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been hoping for this for a long time," Northridge track Coach Don 
Strametz said. "John is really going to help our program. He's very 
knowledgeable about the throws and he has a great reputation in the track and 
field community. His name alone will attract kids who wouldn't otherwise come 
here." 
</P>
<P>
A 1986 UCLA graduate, Frazier, 27, was an assistant at UC Irvine in 1989 and at 
Humboldt State this season. 
</P>
<P>
He has competed for the Stars and Stripes Track Club since graduating from UCLA 
and improved his personal best to 65 feet 9 1/2 inches in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
With Northridge moving to the NCAA Division I level in all sports except 
football beginning in the fall, Strametz hopes that the hiring of Frazier will 
shore up the Matadors' recent weakness in several weight events. 
</P>
<P>
A Division II men's power in the weight events from the early 1970s to the 
mid-'80s, Northridge has not produced an All-American in the shotput, discus or 
javelin since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors have had four Division II All-Americans in the hammer throw in the 
last three years, but that success hasn't carried over to the other weight 
events. 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely need to improve in that area -- especially in the shot and disc 
-- if we're going to be a successful Division I dual-meet team," Strametz said. 
"And I think the addition of John is a big step in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Northridge distance coach Bob Augello resigned his position to 
become an assistant coach/director of the Escondido-based Subaru Cycling Team. 
</P>
<P>
Augello, who coached City Section 3,200 champions Ian Alsen (1987) and Craig 
Lawson (1989) at Granada Hills High, coached at Northridge for two years.

Mississippi State University officials say they will investigate allegations of 
on-campus betting and whether NCAA rules were violated, after a professor and a 
former student pleaded guilty to federal gambling charges. 
</P>
<P>
Court documents indicate three Mississippi State football players were used in 
the fall of 1987 to help collect gambling debts. The players were not named.

NEWSWIRE: KRZYZEWSKI REPORTEDLY TO STAY AT DUKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Krzyzewski has decided to remain at Duke as basketball coach, declining 
overtures to become coach of the Boston Celtics, a newspaper reported Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The Charlotte Observer quoted sources in today's editions as saying Krzyzewski, 
the Duke coach for the past 10 years, withdrew his name from consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Krzyzewski was unavailable for comment, but sources told the newspaper that he 
is not ready to give up coaching on the college level or to break the 
relationships he has developed at Duke. The sources said he would make his 
decision public this morning in a prepared statement. The Celtics are looking 
for a replacement for the fired Jimmy Rodgers.

A Superior Court judge in Paterson, N.J., Thursday cleared the way for a 
heavyweight title fight between champion Buster Douglas and Evander Holyfield 
by rejecting a request that would have prevented promoters from offering bids 
to stage the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Amos C. Saunders' ruling caps a nearly three-month legal battle by 
Holyfield's attorney to prevent rival promoters from interfering with the bids 
for the championship fight.

His mythical bills are obviously a little luckier.

Indian Wind, the first bet I made Thursday, ran second, but was moved up to 
first on a controversial stewards' decision. On second thought, how could any 
decision that puts my horse on top be controversial? He paid $5.40, so my

</P>
<P>
A race later, Vince's Dancer won clear at $6.20, so I collected another $155, 
meaning I'm $190 in the black after one day. You know, I'm beginning to like 
this job a lot better.

MAN ON MISSION: BIZZACK RETURNS FOR PRO SKIING ON THE BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first time Jeff Bizzack water-skied on Mission Bay was 23 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 6, and my father took me around Mission Bay on his shoulders," Bizzack 
said. "I don't think my dad ever imagined that it would turn into this." 
</P>
<P>
What it has become is an obsession, a way of life and a professional career. 
</P>
<P>
And this weekend, Bizzack's career will take him back to where it all began -- 
Mission Bay -- when he competes, along with some 70 others, for $50,000 in 
prize money at the Michelob Dry Water Ski Tour event at Fiesta Island's 
Enchanted Cove on Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning today at 9 a.m., Bizzack will compete in his specialty -- the men's 
slalom -- during the opening round. Preliminary competition continues Saturday 
at 12:30 p.m., and the finals are scheduled for Sunday at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
To say that Bizzack will have a home-water advantage is an understatement. 
We're talking about a guy who cut classes at University High School in San 
Diego so he wouldn't miss prime skiing time. Then, when he went to the 
University of San Diego, he found time to ski between classes. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone always remembered me as the guy who would show up at school with his 
truck and his boat behind it," Bizzack said. 
</P>
<P>
While at USD, Bizzack competed on the water-ski team. But after a couple years, 
Bizzack took his skis to San Francisco State, from which he graduated with a 
business degree. 
</P>
<P>
From there Bizzack took his knowledge of skiing to Hawaii, where he opened a 
water-skiing school. But after three years of losing money, Bizzack decided he 
could make a better living on the newly formed professional ski tour. 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, Bizzack is not exactly making six figures from skiing, but 
along with his job as district sales manager for a computer software company, 
he is living quite comfortably -- so comfortably that he is able to water-ski 
on Discovery Bay, near San Francisco, every night for four hours. 
</P>
<P>
And how committed is Bizzack to training? 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who skis in freezing weather conditions in February, where they have to 
chip the ice off the boat, has to be pretty committed," Bizzack said. 
</P>
<P>
Bizzack said there are some on the pro tour, which has existed for six years, 
who actually ski full-time. 
</P>
<P>
"The top money-leaders can make over $100,000, because some guys have as many 
as a dozen sponsors," said Drew Townes, tour director. "The prize money is 
going up each year. One of the good things about the sport is most of the guys 
are good-looking, exuberant and fairly well-educated. The sport is visually 
appealing, so it's very marketable." 
</P>
<P>
"Those are the guys that eat and breathe water-skiing," Bizzack said. 
</P>
<P>
One of those guys, Andy Mapple of Orlando, Fla., is expected to compete against 
Bizzack this weekend in the men's slalom. Bizzack realizes that no matter how 
familiar the waters of Mission Bay are to him, he is a notch below someone such 
as Mapple. 
</P>
<P>
"Knowing the water conditions, having your family and friends there for you, 
makes you relax and that much more confident, but these skiers on the tour are 
awesome," Bizzack said. "I realized that I cannot compete on the same level as 
them. My goal for this weekend is just to make it to Saturday's final eight." 
</P>
<P>
Bizzack's event is set up much like a snow-skiing slalom event, but on the 
water, there is a 16-second time limit. A skier must negotiate as many gates 
and buoys on one ski as possible in that time. And each time the skier goes 
through the gates, the difficulty is increased by shortening the boat's tow 
rope. In some instances, skiers are traveling at speeds of 60 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has done some water-ski jumping, Bizzack said he chose the slalom 
because of his frame. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the body mass to take the pounding on the knees that most jumpers 
have," he said. "It's your ankles that take a pounding in slalom skiing. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that's important in slalom skiing is the ability to take 
coordination and agility and to be able to know exactly where your ski is 
going." 
</P>
<P>
And Bizzack has known for quite a while where his ski is going -- in the water. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you have that bug, you can't give it up," he said. "This sport is very 
much like an addiction." 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
This weekend's event is the second of eight tour stops, with the championships 
scheduled for Vallejo on Sept. 7-9. ESPN will telecast all eight stops. The San 
Diego event will air on June 18. . . . Skiers from 10 countries, including a 
team of Soviets, will be competing this weekend in six divisions: men's and 
women's slalom, men's and women's ski-jumping, freestyle and kneeboarding. 
Tickets for Friday's challenge round competition are free. Saturday's and 
Sunday's tickets are $8 for adults and $4 for children 7-12.

WOULD-BE CUP DEFENDERS ASKED TO PUT UP OR SHUT UP BY JUNE 28

<P>
The committee in charge of overseeing the U.S. defense of the America's Cup 
Thursday set a June 28 deadline for racing syndicates to show proof that they 
are serious contenders. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed two days of meetings at the San Diego Yacht Club 
between the defense committee and representatives of nine potential defense 
syndicates. 
</P>
<P>
Syndicates have been asked to demonstrate by the deadline that they have the 
initial financial resources to mount a defense effort by: 
</P>
<P>
 -- providing written evidence that they have the commitments from sponsors, 
donors and other revenue sources to raise $6 million toward the start of the 
construction of a boat by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- posting a $150,000 performance bond that would be forfeited if the 
syndicate does not have a valid boat on the starting line for the defense 
trials expected to begin in January, 1992. This bond would be the first of two 
required. The committee previously said that a $150,000 bond would have to be 
posted by July, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Those who fail to meet the requirements will be 'excused from further 
competition," said Tom Ehman, general manager of the America's Cup Organizing 
Committee. Ehman said these groups would be dropped from committee mailings, 
meetings and other functions. But he added that the committee reserves the 
right to accept additional groups after the June 28 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to exclude someone who could help us," Ehman said. "But there is 
no way the U.S. can support 10 syndicates." 
</P>
<P>
The deadline will help potential corporate backers focus on the more-organized 
defense syndicates, Ehman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're beginning the fish-or-cut-bait time," Ehman said. "There is confusion in 
the corporate marketplace with so many groups contending for resources." 
</P>
<P>
Ehman said that at least three potential syndicates were warned by the 
committee that they appear to be in difficulty with regard to meeting the 
requirements; Ehman declined to name the groups. 
</P>
<P>
He said one potential group, Pride of America Defense of Los Angeles, has been 
dropped after failing to attend the meetings this week. Phil Smith, head of the 
group, could not be reached for comment. Ehman said a ninth potential defender 
was added this week when David Lowery, a North County businessman, sent a 
representative to the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Ehman said that the Lowery group had the potential to be a serious defense team 
and identified four potential defense syndicates as having done good early 
preparation: Team Dennis Conner, run by the three-time Cup winner from San 
Diego; Isler Sailing International, headed by former Conner navigator Peter 
Isler of San Diego; Larry Klein's Triumph America Foundation, San Diego, and 
Yankee Syndicate, Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
The meetings this week also were used as a time to lobby syndicates to firm up 
their commitments to the Partnership for America's Cup Technology (PACT), a 
research group designed to help the syndicates pool some of their design work. 
The group is headed by John Marshall, who led the design team for Conner's 
successful 1987 and 1988 America's Cup efforts. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Phil Freedman, founder of the San Diego-based Betsy Ross defense syndicate, has 
reduced his role to that of an adviser, said Tom Ehman, general manager of 
America's Cup Organizing Committee. Shelley Stepanek has taken over the lead 
role with the group. . . . The Leningrad Yacht Club, which was given a two-week 
extension until Saturday midnight to file its $25,000 challenger entry fee, 
still has not paid. But Ehman said the committee still expects the club to meet 
the new deadline. If it does, that will officially increase the number of 
potential challenger syndicates to 21.

HOW AMPHIBIOUS! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE-MARIE TURK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Robin Piccone, the California designer who turned wet-suit neoprene into sexy 
swimwear four years ago, is about to introduce a line of sexy sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
Although Piccone is still formulating the collection (it's scheduled for an 
October delivery to stores), she has no doubts about the direction it will 
take. The projected 38 pieces are inspired by what she sees as the narrowing 
gap "between swimwear and sportswear. People who like the stretch fabric in 
their swimwear don't want to leave it at the beach." 
</P>
<P>
So Piccone will offer them stretchy street wear, such as full-length and 
half-length unitards with neoprene bras attached. In addition, there will be 
snappy, stretchy jackets, skirts, Capri pants, biker shorts and dresses, 
including a long, clingy black one designed with a deep-cut neoprene bodice. A 
few prototype pieces, including the seductive long dress, were seen for the 
first time at a recent City of Hope luncheon, where Piccone was honored as the 
group's "Woman of the Year." 
</P>
<P>
The sportswear will be all Piccone's, unlike her swimwear, which is made under 
a licensing agreement with Body Glove, manufacturers of wet suits and other 
surf-set apparel. Going in a new direction means Piccone will get a chance to 
flex some unused design muscles. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone ever bought a swimsuit with sleeves," she says with a 
soft laugh. "And swimsuits with lapels never sold. There's no superfluous 
fabric in swimwear." Thinking of the sexy, sleek garments she has designed, she 
adds: "Basically, there's nothing superfluous in the sportswear, but I can be a 
lot more creative with it." 
</P>
<P>
Piccone says she has focused on bust line and waistline in both the upcoming 
swim and sportswear cruise collections, and she will use the same color 
palette. "You're not going to see much high-cut leg. That's not the point of 
the collection," Piccone says of the swimwear. "And we'll be offering some 
suits for less-than-perfect figures. They'll have more coverage, more bust 
support, more structure." 
</P>
<P>
The mother of an 16-month-old son, Piccone smiles as she notes: "Maybe it's 
because I've had a baby, but I think in the '90s the emphasis will be on less 
perfectly athletic bodies than in the '80s, when the emphasis was on being 
very, very thin, and working out was almost a competition. I think women will 
give in to their predisposition to be more feminine, heavier and more shapely."

HOT TO SHOP: A LITTLE BLACK MAGIC DOESN'T HURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH ANN KRIER and JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HOT: I have recently escaped Washington, the land of gray suits, strings 
of pearls, sensible shoes and grown women named Muffy. I find myself in a bit 
of a culture shock, albeit a welcome one. The L.A. crowd I hang out with now is 
vastly different from the one I associated with in D.C., obviously. These 
people go to see performance artists who do weird things with canned 
vegetables. They frequent crowded coffee houses till 4 a.m. and watch foreign 
films with no subtitles. 
</P>
<P>
I love my new friends, but I've also noticed that they wear almost nothing but 
black. I've wanted to ask them why, but figured they'll think I'm incredibly 
brainless. While I like the look, I'm not sure it's for me. I'm not sure that I 
want to alter my wardrobe , but I also don't want to stand out looking like a 
dweeb. And I didn't even know that at my age I'd still have to deal with peer 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 -- GEEK OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
MISS STEIN SUGGESTS: You can hardly hang out with a crowd like that in an 
Adolfo suit and not be mistaken for a Tipper Gore wanna-be. But face it, peer 
pressure never goes away. If your new friends wear nothing but black and you 
want to fit in, then the answer is . . . wear black! There are many reasons why 
black works, especially for this crowd: It almost never shows dirt, you don't 
have to worry about matching patterns and it makes pale, pasty skin look even 
paler and pastier. Try it for a month or so and watch how much more readily you 
are accepted into your new clique of friends. Why, they'll probably even ask 
you to participate in their next nihilistic poetry reading. 
</P>
<P>
MISS KRIER BEGS TO DIFFER: The question is this: Do you want to look like your 
life is a party, a fiesta filled with fun and joy and delight? Or would you 
rather go around wearing mortician's clothes just because they happen to be 
fashionable? 
</P>
<P>
The colors you surround yourself with both reflect your inner state and 
influence it. Thus, my preference is for almost any color except black. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it's up to you to decide what's right for you, but if it were me, 
I'd ditch the Munsters look and get on with the party. If you want to be 
up-to-the-minute fashionably correct, switch to an all-white wardrobe, which 
the usually black-garbed Miss Stein neglected to tell you is the new, chic 
neutral anyway, according to many fashion authorities. As for peer pressure, it 
can go away. All it takes is moderately enlightened friends who appreciate you 
no matter what color your wardrobe, skin or attitude. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HOT: It's hot. I want to look cool. But I don't want to invest large bucks 
for a Madonna/I Dream of Jeannie hairpiece; in other words, something that's 
hip today, gone tomorrow. I don't mind her retro-sitcom look, or even the 
trashy stuff, but anything the material girl wears gets so popular it's in and 
out of style in less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MADONNA NADA 
</P>
<P>
DEAR NADA: There's one fun, cheap, new accessory that doesn't have the stam of 
Madonna-style that you might want to try: great, little, nerdy-looking 
sunglasses. Some of the best-priced ones on the market are from a new 
MTV/Riviera line. Don't worry, the MTV logo's safely stuck on the inside of 
these glasses (those pictured here sell for $18 and are available at The 
Broadway). Much of the MTV collection consists of small, dark, wire-rimmed or 
faux tortoise shell glasses. Back in the '60s, these frames were favored by 
hippies. Today, the style is showing up on young urbanites such as Arsenio 
Hall, who sometimes wears a similar version on his talk show.

FRAGRANCE INTRODUCED BY LACROIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY HAWKINS, Hawkins is a New York-based free-lance writer whose work 
frequently appears in The Times fashion pages. 
</P>

<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The first smell is not violent -- but daring -- like some of the outfits you 
see in my couture show," says Christian Lacroix, the 40ish designer who took 
fashion by storm three years ago when he put women in extravagantly designed 
"poufs" and was quickly elevated to the pantheon of Paris' top couturiers. 
</P>
<P>
Lacroix was describing his first fragrance, C'est La Vie, which was launched in 
the United States at a gala (purportedly price-tagged at about $550,000) for 
400 at the Palladium nightclub in New York on Monday. French ballerina Sophie 
Guillem performed "Bolero," accompanied by 40 male dancers, on a technically 
elaborate stage built especially for the occasion. Actor Tony Randall acted as 
emcee and a catered dinner followed for such Lacroix fans Blaine Trump, artist 
Julian Schnabel, former Ambassador to France Evan Galbraith and his wife Marie, 
and Lacroix's muse and favorite model, silver-haired Marie Seznec. 
</P>
<P>
"Perfume is, above all else, memories. It's nostalgia made from souvenirs," 
says Lacroix, who credits Maurice Roger, chairman of Parfums Christian Lacroix 
and Parfums Christian Dior with inventing the name. 
</P>
<P>
"While we were coming up with the scent, we had to start again more than once 
and very often we said, 'C'est La Vie,' " he explains. 
</P>
<P>
The fragrance, a floral bouquet of orange blossom and syringa (a 
white-flowering shrub found in Lacroix's native Provence), is packaged in the 
designer's signature colors -- pink, bright yellow and black. The crystal 
bottle reflects feminine curves and features a pink stopper shaped like a coral 
branch. 
</P>
<P>
C'est La Vie will be available in September at I. Magnin, Bullock's and 
Robinson's, with a little more than an ounce of perfume selling for about $163 
and 1.7 ounces of eau de toilette selling for $43. 
</P>
<P>
Though Lacroix has no immediate plans to make a store appearance in Los 
Angeles, he says that he has great affection for the city, which he has visited 
four times. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. is really like a movie to me. The people look like actors. The houses 
look like sets. The way of life is very like where I grew up in the Camargue, 
in the south of France -- sun, pleasure, fun. I feel at home in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
Just like a Hollywood actor, Lacroix, who is known for his flamboyant colors 
and extravagant use of embroidery, lace and pattern mixes, says he has suffered 
a bit from typecasting. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we were caricatured by the first collection," he says of his 
frequently copied poufs and the dramatic, ethic styling inspired by Arles, 
France, with its Gypsies and bullfighting. "But I can't help using bright 
colors, embroideries and great patterns because I'm from the south. It's bred 
in me. Even the men wear bright outfits. And the Gypsy women -- it's the 
sensuality of dark women passing through this extravaganza of a place."

MILLI VANILLI STYLIST GIVES DUO'S STAGE DESIGNS A WORKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN SAJBEL, Sajbel, a free-lance writer, regularly contributes to The 
Times fashion pages. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Do clothes make the band? In the case of Milli Vanilli, they certainly haven't 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The pop group, composed of German-born Rob Pilatus, 24, and French-born Fab 
Morvan, 23, is known for its highly danceable music (with four No. 1 hits in 
the last year, starting with "Girl You Know It's True") and their own nonstop 
aerobic workout on stage. 
</P>
<P>
Pilatus and Morvan are also known for their heartthrob good looks -- chiseled 
cheekbones and $750 hairdos, in which elaborate hair extensions are braided 
with their own long locks. 
</P>
<P>
And certainly not least of all, they're known for wearing tights and tank tops 
that show off their well-toned physiques. 
</P>
<P>
Up to this point, Pilatus and Morvan have raided their own closets for the 
tights, tunics, cropped jackets, military boots, leather jackets and ripped 
jeans they've worn in their videos. 
</P>
<P>
But on their first tour, which stopped at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los 
Angeles last weekend, they are being costumed by Jim Lutz, a former assistant 
designer for Bob Mackie. 
</P>
<P>
The pairing of the earthy Milli Vanilli and the Mackie-trained designer, who is 
used to fitting sheer, sequined, minimal-coverage costumes on Cher, might seem 
offbeat, and the matchup did occur by chance. 
</P>
<P>
Morvan and Pilatus were in the same aerobics class with Lutz at the Sports 
Connection. Afterward, in the lobby, the duo met their management 
representative, Todd Headlee, who was an old friend of Lutz. They were 
introduced and struck a deal right there. 
</P>
<P>
Lutz, 29, who now makes his own line of women's separates under the Bankston 
label, was thrilled to do clothes for the performers. 
</P>
<P>
"They're easy to work for because they know what they want," he says. "They try 
something on and say yes or no. They're not fussy." 
</P>
<P>
Lutz expanded on the Milli Vanilli signature look: a strong-shouldered, 
V-shaped silhouette. He kept the duo in tailored jackets and leggings, but 
created theme clothes more suitable for the stage. 
</P>
<P>
One set of jackets is inspired by Ninja warriors. Their high-buttoned riding 
jackets were fashioned after the exotic lines of Jean Paul Gaultier and the 
19th-Century frock coat worn by Daniel Day-Lewis on Oscar night. 
</P>
<P>
The backup musicians wear black mandarin jackets and the Milli Vanilli armband, 
which bears a map of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
As the tour moved into warmer Southern states, Lutz added soft rayon and 
washable suede in sweat suits, cropped tops and full, floating pants to be 
tucked into boots. "Rob calls it a sportive look," Lutz says. The new clothes 
have been made in Rastafarian-inspired shades of red, green and yellow. 
</P>
<P>
All the clothes must withstand the jumps, acrobatics and splits the duo is know 
for. "They really move from the second the show starts," Lutz says. "I knew 
what to watch out for from working with Bob Mackie." 
</P>
<P>
Working with Mackie's performers and stage costumes also gave Lutz experience 
in quick changes. Milli Vanilli, he says, makes a lot. "They're on the stage 
the whole time, so costume changes had to be done in 10 seconds," explains 
Lutz, who solved the dilemma with simple zippers and lots of Velcro.

No Pipes of Peace for McCartney: Paul McCartney didn't let it be when he was 
called greedy by the manager of U2 just because he had a corporate sponsor -- 
Visa -- back his recent tour. McCartney responded with an eight-letter curse 
word. "My advice to Paul McGuinness is to grow up," McCartney said in Rolling 
Stone. GREG BRAXTON

Dame Judith Anderson Honored: Dame Judith Anderson, now 92 and living in Santa 
Barbara, was honored Wednesday night at the first acting awards competition 
held by UCLA's School of Theater, Film and Television. In her native Adelaide, 
Australia, Dame Judith told the audience, she'd had no interest in studies at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the dumbest girl, not only in my class but the whole school. All I 
wanted to do was show off, which I did." So she did, making her stage debut at 
17 and later gaining screen immortality as the wicked Mrs. Danvers in Alfred 
Hitchcock's film of Daphne DuMaurier's "Rebecca." Dame Judith was introduced by 
George Schaefer, associate dean of the school, who had directed her in Maurice 
Evans' GI version of "Macbeth" during World War II. GREG BRAXTON

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: STAGE / NANCY CHURNIN: RECALL MICKEY FINN SHOW? IT'S 
STOMPING BACK TO S.D. 
</P>

The Mickey Finn show is coming home. 
</P>
<P>
The old Mickie Finn nightclub (the spelling changed in 1973), also known as 
"San Diego Speakeasy No. 1," played Dixieland jazz and comedy routines to 3 1/2 
million San Diegans and served 250,000 gallons of beer and 150,000 pounds of 
peanuts from 1960 to 1974. The club is no more, but Fred Finn is coming out of 
semi-retirement from the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia to present the show, 
starting tonight and ending July 7, at the Hahn Cosmopolitan Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Why the spelling change? Finn named his club after the knockout drink, the 
Mickey Finn, and the woman he was married to at the time, whose nickname was 
Mickie. They divorced in 1973 and, as he puts it, he got custody of the name 
and she got the money. They both remarried and there are no hard feelings, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he's just looking forward to coming back to the town where he first hit it 
big. 
</P>
<P>
"Kit Goldman (managing director) from the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre called and 
said the theater would be available this summer. I have a nephew going to be 
married in California. Then there's this Las Vegas operation," said Finn on the 
phone from Las Vegas, where he just became entertainment director of Rosie 
O'Grady's entertainment complex. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I'd kill three birds with one stone." 
</P>
<P>
He's also looking forward to seeing his son, Michael, cameraman and one-time 
regular on the Larry Himmel show, who is still working and living in San Diego. 
And there's the Dixieland Big Band gig he has at Disneyland on Aug. 19-25. 
</P>
<P>
So much for semi-retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Finn's last foray into San Diego was in 1988, when he brought back the Mickey 
Finn show, with wife Kelly on stage for four performances at the now-defunct 
Fiesta Dinner Theatre, and produced a sellout vaudeville spoof, "Tomfoolery," 
for the same venue. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco-born musician got started after taking a business course in 
which he learned that the best place to open a nightclub would be in a growing 
area with an excellent climate. He considered Washington and Hawaii and chose 
San Diego, partly, he says, because he didn't have a lot of money to transport 
his truckload of old nickelodeons, pictures and turn-of-the-century Salvation 
Army stuff that he crammed his club with because he loved it, and which later 
became valuable as an investment. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego seemed pretty pleased about becoming Finn's chosen city, especially 
in 1966, when the Mickie Finn show became a weekly summer replacement show on 
NBC, and San Diegans would drive up to L.A. to appear in the Mickie Finn bar 
that the network duplicated on a Burbank lot. In October, 1966, the Mickie Finn 
show headlined at Caesar's Palace and continued to play Vegas clubs until 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Finn said he has fond memories about seeing up to 1,000 people a night, every 
night, for 14 years at his old place on 10th and University avenues, all 
"laughing, scratching, stomping their feet and clapping their hands." He hopes 
to do some reminiscing June 19, when the performance will be a reunion of 
anyone who has worked at Mickey Finn's over the years, like his old bouncer, 
Hoot Conner, a former Navy man who controlled the crowds at the club and played 
the bartender on the TV show. 
</P>
<P>
Conner, who still lives in San Diego, said he misses the show and fondly 
remembers the times when he and Finn raced an old hook-and-ladder firetruck on 
the El Cajon speedway and fired an old cannon after every score at San Diego 
Chargers games. 
</P>
<P>
The reunion will take place before, during and after the show, said Finn. 
"We'll party and tell lies about the past." 
</P>
<P>
Talk about culture clash. Sharing the Lyceum Space set of "Latins Anonymous," a 
takeoff on Latino stereotypes complete with Mayan figurines and Los Angeles 
freeway columns, is the San Diego Chinese Center's first theatrical production, 
"White Snake," running Friday, Saturday and Monday only. 
</P>
<P>
A classic Chinese folk tale about a powerful snake spirit transformed into a 
woman who falls in love with a mortal man, the one-hour show was adapted by 
Kent Brisby into a modern English production, with music, dance, puppets and 
kung fu helping to tell the tale. 
</P>
<P>
"White Snake" has already sold out its Friday and Saturday performances. Some 
seats remain for the 8 p.m. Monday show, said Maya Hu, executive director of 
the San Diego Chinese Center. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Thompson Kern, new artistic director of the Coronado Playhouse as of Feb. 
1, is determined to bring back what she terms the glory days of the Coronado 
Playhouse, the ones she remembers from working as stage manager and director in 
the late '70s and early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
The first goal accomplished was financial solvency. Working with her new 
managing director, J. Paul Ward, Kern reports the company has been in the black 
since the spring, which she said means that the city of Coronado is no longer 
pressuring it to move. The second goal, which kicks into place this summer, is 
the creation of a repertory season. 
</P>
<P>
The company's curtain raiser tonight is George Bernard Shaw's "Candida," 
running through June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Kern said she plans to introduce stipends to Coronado Playhouse artists for the 
first time in the company's history and plans to produce at least one original 
show a year, possibly developed from the staged reading program. 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAM NOTES: Several years ago, when Carlos X. Pena presented "Pvt. Wars," it 
was a one-act play about three combat veterans returning home, by James McLure. 
Now McLure has expanded the play to full length and Pena will produce, perform 
and direct in the show at the Progressive Stage Company, June 14-July 22. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Just because you're small, doesn't mean you have to think small. Southeast 
Community Theatre acquired the rights to the San Diego premiere of August 
Wilson's "Fences" and did a commendable job with Wilson's Tony and first 
Pulitzer-Prize winner. Now another community theater, Octad-One will present 
the San Diego premiere of a hit movie and off-Broadway show, "Steel Magnolias," 
tonight through July 8, in its new 49-seat space at 3450 College Ave., in the 
College Grove shopping center. Octad-One will follow up with "Romeo and 
Juliet," as its annual free Shakespeare offering in the El Cajon Plaza 
Amphitheatre, July 7-Aug. 26. . . . 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Theatre League's interpreted series for the hearing impaired 
continues with the Patio Playhouse production of "Wiley and the Hairy Man" 
Sunday at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
TONY TALK: It is becoming increasingly obvious that regional theater is where 
the best of Broadway is developed. San Diego theatergoers had the opportunity 
to see two Tony-nominees before they went to Broadway: "The Grapes of Wrath" at 
La Jolla Playhouse and "The Piano Lesson" at Old Globe Theatre. "The Grapes of 
Wrath" got the Tony and "The Piano Lesson" -- no slouch -- walked away with the 
Pulitzer.

'GREAT BARRIER REEF' HYPNOTIC IN IMAX AT SCIENCE MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few documentaries are more visually hypnotic than the ones shot underwater. 
Blue, rapt and mysterious, they show us a world dreamlike but also vicious: 
full of predators and victims, with life a constant struggle to eat or avoid 
being eaten. And the refracted sunlight casts a soft, pearly radiance on it 
all. 
</P>
<P>
"The Great Barrier Reef" (at the Museum of Science and Industry's IMAX 
Theater), isn't a great underwater documentary, like Jacques Cousteau and Louis 
Malle's early films. Nor is it entertaining and whimsical, like that '50s 
Disney short "Mysteries of the Deep," a childhood favorite of mine. But it does 
have the advantage of being shot in IMAX, with its huge 70-by-54-foot screen 
image and incredibly gorgeous, hyper-real detail. 
</P>
<P>
"Barrier Reef" is set on a coral reef -- the world's largest, off the 
Australian coast -- and it's safe to say that no underwater film, not even 
Cousteau's, has brought that world to us with such sharp vision and 
overwhelming impact. Watching this film, with its plethora of marine life, its 
manta rays -- Spanish dancers sinuously whipping their skirts -- its 
ballooned-out puffer fish, moray eels, sharks and huge schools of cardinal 
fish, has a tonic quality. It gentles the audience out, even as the narration, 
mostly by "CBS Morning News" ex-anchor Bill Kurtis, rings on portentously and 
heavily. 
</P>
<P>
Kurtis, who also had a hand in writing the script, is always straining for 
cosmic significance, the march of time. Like John Huston's Noah Cross in 
"Chinatown," he wants us to know that all life came from the water: slews, tide 
pools or, in this case, coral reefs. Ironically, what the camera shows is often 
so impressive that this magniloquent framework is unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
The Great Barrier Reef, as Kurtis remarks, is the oldest living, or partially 
living, organism on Earth, constantly renewing itself as new sea polyps grow, 
die and leave their calcified skeletons in the fantastic, fairy-tale spires and 
towers. And the life forms that zip or glide through its aqueous avenues are 
wonderful camera subjects, including the sharks, so perfectly adapted to a 
cruel world that they've survived, little changed, for hundreds of millions of 
years. Up above, we see the green turtles on land spilling out hundreds of 
slippery white eggs -- certainly a unique movie moment -- and the later frantic 
race of the newly hatched hordes across the perilous beach to the sea. We see 
lobsters scuttling, anemones fluttering, puffer fish balloning themselves out 
to foil assailants. We even, disturbingly, watch those strangest denizens of 
the deep: underwater camera people at work. 
</P>
<P>
All that's enough for a fascinating movie -- especially one shot in IMAX. 
Produced, directed and co-written by George Casey, "The Great Barrier Reef" 
(rated PG) isn't one of IMAX's strongest entries. It's dwarfed in impact by 
"Chronos," "Grand Canyon" "To the Limit," and several others. But, still, it's 
absorbing, stimulating, full of fresh, clear-eyed images. It's nice to see a 
movie where the sharks are on camera, instead of arranging the deal.

3-D CAN'T SAVE FLAT, LONG-ON-THE-SHELF 'ROTTWEILER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a good thing that the 1981 3-D "Rottweiler" (at the Vagabond) is as bad as 
it is. If you couldn't laugh at it, it would really be a tedious business. 
</P>
<P>
It is, of course, about Rottweilers, a dozen of them -- bred and trained to be 
killer dogs -- that go AWOL from the Army en route to Ft. Bragg and terrorize a 
mountain resort. That "Rottweiler" plays like an amateur parody of TV's "Twin 
Peaks" helps you get through it, but this long-on-the-shelf item -- being shown 
in a scratchy print -- lacks the necessary energy to make it even as a 
so-bad-it's-good midnight movie. 
</P>
<P>
"Rottweiler" producer Earl Owensby stars as the sheriff at Lake Lure, where the 
main attraction is female mud wrestling and where most of the Rottweilers' 
victims are scantily clad women. Performances, direction (by Worth Keeter) and 
script (by Thom McIntyre) are uniformly lousy. The film is just as flat as if 
it hadn't been shot in 3-D, of which little use has been made. 
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, "Rottweiler" had a brief run in Chicago and in some small towns, 
and it did cause a bit of a stir in late 1981 when the American Rottweiler Club 
complained that the film gave the big, powerful German working dogs a bad 
image. Since then, the breed has had an increasingly negative press for which 
this forgettable movie, also known as "Dogs From Hell," cannot be blamed.

'BASHU': BEIZAI'S TESTAMENT TO POWER OF LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's nothing in the subtitles to tell us, but it's clear that the 
bombardment with which the wondrous "Bashu, the Little Stranger" (at the AMC 
Santa Monica 7) commences is an Iraqi assault. The location is southern Iran 
along the Persian Gulf, and in a flaming village the camera picks up a small 
boy who manages to stowaway aboard a truck, which he alights after passing 
through vast stretches of desert to the verdant rural Far North around the 
Caspian Sea. 
</P>
<P>
This boy, a dark, handsome 10-year-old named Bashu (Adnan Afravian) might as 
well be an alien from another planet. The peasantry, whose way of life has 
changed little over the millenia, find his Arabic dialect incomprehensible -- 
never mind that he can't understand its dialect either -- and refer to him as a 
piece of coal because of his dusky skin. Even the bold-featured Nai (Susan 
Taslimi), as beautiful as she is sturdy, whose two small children have found 
him in the fields, casts a stone at him. But you know very well that this 
radiant earth mother is eventually going to take him in. 
</P>
<P>
There's much of Anna Magnani in Taslimi's gestures and volcanic talent -- in 
her tenderness and passion and humor. This superbly gifted actress and the 
equally resourceful Afravian take this film way beyond sentimentality. The 
flowering of Nai's love for Bashu parallels his own struggle to find a place in 
a totally foreign and frequently hostile environment. 
</P>
<P>
"Bashu, the Little Stranger" is a pure joy in which there are absolutely no 
false moves and both laughter as well as tears. Every movement of the camera, 
its every placement, its every composition, indeed, every cut in the film is 
exactly right, serving unobtrusively to tell a story. 
</P>
<P>
Yet because the film's veteran writer-director Bahram Beizai, aided by the 
extraordinary cinematographer Firooz Malekzadeh, is first and foremost a 
storyteller, all sorts of subtle implications and symbols arise, in regard to 
anti-war as well as anti-racist sentiments. (Iranian audiences will probably 
suspect that rather than "job-hunting" Nai's husband is actually off to war -- 
especially considering his condition upon his return.) 
</P>
<P>
"Bashu, the Little Stranger" is finally a testament to the transforming power 
of love and its ability to transcend the limits of experience, education and 
ethnicity. Although just short of two hours, "Bashu, the Little Stranger" 
(Times-rated Mature; too intense for small children) is always brisk and 
lively; it's as modest as it is flawless.

STAGE BEAT: SCRAP'S 'LA REPONSE IMPERVUE' AN UNEVEN BUT INTERESTING MIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A company calling itself Scrap Theatre has launched a tasty idea: a group of 
performance pieces, "La Reponse Impervue (The Unexpected Answer)," based on 
Magritte's painting of the same name, staged cabaret-style in cafes around 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The debut in the lounge at the Mondrian Hotel signals promise for a group that 
disdains conventional theaters and invites company members to perform and shape 
their own material. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting 2-to-12-minute vignettes about quirky human nature are radically 
uneven, but under the patchwork structure the production is adventurous and 
professional. 
</P>
<P>
Once producers Michael DellaFemina (who excels in the role of a raggedy 
can-picker), Matti Leshem and Charles Bailey-Gates learn from their mistakes, 
Scrap Theatre will defy its name. What's needed is an overall director with 
creative control. Opening night ran two hours without a break. Some of the 
material is expendable and overwrought. 
</P>
<P>
But the performance gems are several, among them Tim Omundson's erotic fantasy 
in "All Men Are Whores" (written by David Mamet), Bailey-Gates and the wordless 
Angela O'Neill as a tortured couple in "Look Both Ways" (written by Fax Bahr), 
comic Dylan Brody's refreshing spin on "War on Drugs," Patrick Thornton's 
scalding Irish rebel in "Trinity" (from Leon Uris), and Laura Spain and Gregg 
Ostrin's warring marrieds in "Assassinations" (written by Ostrin and sharply 
helmed by Leshem). 
</P>
<P>
The production starts dynamically but dribbles to a close. When this company 
gets tough with itself, this show should fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Future venues: the Highland Ground, 742 N. Highland Blvd., Thursday, 9 p.m.; 
the Metropolis, 650 N. La Cienega Blvd., 9 p.m., June 21; the Mondrian Hotel, 
July 2, 9 p.m. $3-$10; (213) 876-6043.

<P>
A Workmanlike 'Romeo and Juliet' 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Susana Repertory Company plops the houses of Montague and Capulet 
down in Pueblo de Verona in Spanish California. "Romeo and Juliet" works well 
around a mission, and even better under a big circus tent, which is the 
company's Simi Valley home for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Early California has possibility as Shakespeare turf. A few years back the 
Globe Playhouse set "Comedy of Errors" in '49er Gold Rush country. But Spanish 
California, rather washed out in the bland adobe set design, is strictly 
cosmetic here and quickly forgotten. Director Lane Davies' production for the 
SSRC is otherwise workmanlike and occasionally flavorful. 
</P>
<P>
The acting is alternately stiff and energetic. Paul Johansson's Romeo has 
appealing vitality and he's physically robust. But only two actors are 
Shakespearean in their instincts: Barry Kramer as hothead Tybalt and Jeff Allin 
as mercurial Mercutio. When they are killed off, the blood of the show goes 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
What catches your breath are the dashing saber fights -- suspenseful stuff, 
masterfully staged by fight choreographer Michael Rossoddo. 
</P>
<P>
While it's well-known that Juliet was only 14 years old, seldom do you find a 
Juliet, such as the gleaming Alisha Das, who acts 14. This is both a curse and 
a virtue; her voice and emotions are alternately tinny and strident, but 
there's something Goldilocked about her, too -- or is it just her looks? Here's 
a Juliet to argue over. 
</P>

'So Far, So Good' -- So Far Not Quite That Good 
</P>
<P>
For the adventurous theatergoer, "So Far, So Good," a one-man performance piece 
at the Zephyr Theatre, is a test of will. Will you make it through the evening? 
Will you endure a self-described "walking, talking hazardous waste spill" of a 
character? Will his despair touch you? Will you care? 
</P>
<P>
Actor and debuting playwright Kenneth Robert Shippy and director Allen Garfield 
have taken a huge risk. They win on theatrical points. Shippy's tour de force 
performance and his remarkable shopping cart, with its commode, fire truck and 
dog frozen stiff as a board, have a crazed kind of appeal. But the creators 
lose on dramatic grounds. This work is maddening and indulgent. 
</P>
<P>
Its curious redemption is the open-mouthed fascination of watching a production 
as suicidal as its homeless protagonist, who shuffles around strapped to a 
ticking time bomb. 
</P>
<P>
An early line portends trouble: "I am the self you have abandoned. I am the 
self that remains." This is the signal to duck. 
</P>
<P>
Shippy's acting and writing can be vivid and riotous. He wears a light bulb on 
his head, and some of his images are nightmarishly surrealistic. But the real 
drama, a psychological story of child abuse, arrives too late and can't sustain 
the hour and 40-minute length. 
</P>
<P>
Here's an experiment, developed in Garfield's Actors Shelter theater lab, that 
cries out for momentum and focus. Less in this case is more.

Theatre 40 Takes a Fall in 'Gown for His Mistress' 
</P>
<P>
Theatre 40, which is experienced at staging period farce, slips up with Georges 
Feydeau's first full-length comedy, "A Gown for His Mistress." 
</P>
<P>
The attractive cast captures the frantic and intricate dissembling so vital to 
Feydeau, but director Harvey Medlinsky's pacing seems furious for its own sake. 
Most of the actors are wound up so tightly they tend to spin around the 
handsomely appointed stage like marionettes instead of people. 
</P>
<P>
There's also a perceptible lack of Parisian style. The characters too often 
suggest Americans in belle epoque costumes. The happy exceptions are Barbara 
Keegan, Dan Peters and Marie Lillo. 
</P>
<P>
The central cad, an unfaithful doctor played by Richard Hoyt-Miller, lacks 
requisite charm and his habitual shouting is annoying. You're not supposed to 
dislike these people. Another actor, David Himes, is too hammy and broad. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the male actors are heavy-handed and the women too indistinguishable 
from each other. 
</P>
<P>
 At 241 Moreno Drive, (in Beverly Hills High School), Thursdays through 
Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 2 and 8 p.m., though July 8. $12-$15; (213) 
466-1767.

'The Informer' Suffers From Too Much Talkiness 
</P>
<P>
An important subject, the FBI's illegal surveillance of protest groups, is 
botched in the Faustian political drama, "The Informer," at the Zephyr Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Director/playwright Anton Holden's heart is certainly sound, but his dramatic 
instincts are not. Despite provocative dialogue, including the juxtaposition of 
Spanish and English in this tale of an American student who stings for the FBI, 
the production suffers from a didactic and stilted tone. 
</P>
<P>
As the rootless sell-out who infiltrates Students in Solidarity with Nicaragua 
and El Salvador, Alan Berman is a credible and anguished informer. Victor 
Rivers' paramilitary zealot and Frank Mangano's metallic-cold FBI agent are 
strong support. 
</P>
<P>
But the production is too talky. Its physical design is much too skimpy; 
lighting designer (David Carlton) must carry too much of the show. And the 
steely Liana Odalys seems uneasy and self-conscious as the chief Salvadoran 
freedom fighter, having a romance with the informer. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7458 Melrose Ave., Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7 p.m., 
through July 15. $12-$15; (213) 466-1767.

VERSATILE RIGBY A NATURAL IN SCRAPPY, STREAMLINED 'PETER PAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She flips. She fights. She flies. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Rigby is back as one of the scrappiest Peter Pans ever. And while her 
face doesn't quite match Mary Martin's for deep-down tenderness, she's more 
than just the toughest kid on the block -- thanks to a strong, versatile vocal 
style. When she sings "Distant Melody," you can hear her long-lost mother 
calling. When she sings "Neverland," she's a very persuasive travel agent. 
</P>
<P>
That Rigby is a natural in the part shouldn't surprise Southlanders. She first 
did this role in 1986, for the Long Beach Civic Light Opera (after an earlier 
tour in an arena-style "Peter Pan" for which she didn't have to sing). Since 
then, she has been seen in the company of Tinkerbell and Wendy at Knott's Berry 
Farm and in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest difference between those versions and the touring production that 
just opened at the Pantages is the show itself, particularly the second act. It 
has been streamlined and focused. The pirates and Indians interplay doesn't 
drag as it has in most productions. It seems as if the Indians assume the role 
of good guys more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
According to producer Tom McCoy, director Fran Soeder went back to the original 
James M. Barrie source and restored elements and lines that had been removed 
from the text of the familiar 1954 musical staging. He set the second act's 
middle scene in a cavern at Marooner's Rock. Here, we're told, prisoners are 
stranded and then washed away by the high tide. And it's here that Peter Pan 
briefly faces that fate, after he's wounded in a skirmish with Captain Hook and 
can't fly away. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, this version places Peter in slightly more jeopardy than 
previous editions of the show did. This sense of peril and adventure befits not 
only Rigby, whose Peter has the physicality that you would expect from a former 
champion gymnast. It also provides a better script for a relatively virile 
Captain Hook. 
</P>
<P>
As played by Stephen Hanan, this Hook is a real swashbuckler (if that's not a 
contradiction in terms), not just a figure of fun. He moves more gracefully 
than previous Hooks. He's allowed to actually get his hook into Peter in the 
above mentioned scene. 
</P>
<P>
In the third act, when he sheds his frilly outfit in favor of a shirt open down 
to the navel (Mariann Verheyen did the costumes), he could almost pass for a 
dastardly Errol Flynn. He speaks and sings with a deep, rich Shakespearean 
timbre, declaiming as if he's the actor-manager in a Victorian production of 
"Richard III." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of Hanan's words, nor those of his pirates, can be perfectly 
understood. The declaiming gets a bit thick. Still, it's refreshing for Peter 
and Tiger Lily to face such a formidable foe. Hanan's Hook is still funny. He's 
just not particularly flouncy. And Marilyn Magness' choreography gives even the 
cardboard Indians a suggestion of vigor and dignity. 
</P>
<P>
This de-camping of the show is even felt in the first act, when Hanan plays the 
part of Mr. Darling. There is a suggestive grin on his face during bedtime at 
the Darling household. This Mr. Darling wouldn't mind if the kids were spirited 
away for the evening -- it would give him and Mrs. Darling some long-awaited 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
But the one place where this show -- and the Long Beach production before it -- 
are clearly superior to the Mary Martin version (at least the one that was 
rerun on NBC last year) is in the character of Wendy. This Wendy, Cindy 
Robinson, still plays Miss Goody Two-shoes, but she also unleashes a harsh, 
irrepressible snicker. It's the sort of sound that a kid would make despite her 
best intentions. 
</P>
<P>
Of course most of this "Peter Pan" is familiar. We still hear that irresistible 
score (lyrics by Carolyn Leigh, Betty Comden and Adolph Green; music by Moose 
Charlap and Jule Styne), smartly supervised by Kevin Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
The design has a comforting, antique storybook quality. Tinkerbell doesn't have 
that high-tech laser look. You can see the rope that supports Rigby and the 
other fliers (Flying by Foy, naturally), but it doesn't matter in this context, 
nor does the fact that some of the flying looks more like swinging, if you 
think about it. The kids' first successful leaps and their star-spangled trips 
to and from Neverland remain breathtaking. 
</P>
<P>
It all lasts more than two hours, which may be too much for preschoolers, 
especially at the evening performances. But don't bolt for the exit as soon as 
the curtain calls begin, or you might miss one of the most exciting moments -- 
when Peter shatters that fourth wall.

LANKERSHIM CENTER MAKES ROOM FOR ARTS; 
</P>
<P>
GALLERIES: ONE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY ARTIST SAID OF THE NEW EXHIBITION SPACE: 'WE 
WON'T HAVE TO GO OVER THE HILL TO GET THINGS ON DISPLAY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Candice Ocampo calls her work eccentric -- she turns lead, steel and copper 
into art. Shirley Shabazian paints mainstream portraits with water colors, oils 
and pastels. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, each will have a new home for the creations -- the Lankershim Arts Center 
in North Hollywood, which opens June 15. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it has a chance to be a place for a lot of avant-garde people," said 
Ocampo. "It's a great space." 
</P>
<P>
Said Shabazian: "It's open to everyone, which makes it so feasible for those 
who live in the Valley. We won't have to go over the hill to get things on 
display." 
</P>
<P>
According to Earl Sherburn, the center's director, that's exactly what the city 
of Los Angeles had in mind -- an outlet for unconventional and mainstream 
artists, away from the pockets of galleries and centers downtown and on the 
Westside. The Lankershim center becomes only the second such facility in the 
San Fernando Valley; the other is the McGroarty Cultural Arts Center in 
Tujunga. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to have a presence in the neighborhoods," Sherburn said. "Eventually, 
we'd like to have a center like this in every one of the council members' 
districts." 
</P>
<P>
The center will feature classes in visual and performing arts, and 2,800 square 
feet of gallery space. The main floor, Sherburn said, will be used primarily 
for art exhibitions, but can be easily converted for music, dance and theater 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
The center will be housed in the two-story former city Department of Water and 
Power building at 5108 Lankershim Blvd., which, by virtue of its 1930s Art Deco 
architecture, was declared a cultural monument by the city's Cultural Heritage 
Commission in 1980. The building has been vacant since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"Where McGroarty has been used more for visual arts," said Sherburn, "we think 
this area lends itself more to performing arts." He said he already has been 
contacted by theater and dance companies eager to display their work at the 
center, and he expects to hold small film festivals in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Plans are also under way to find about 25 part-time instructors and one 
full-time teacher for classes in painting, drawing and other visual arts. The 
classes will cost $1.50 per hour for senior citizens and children, $2 for 
others. 
</P>
<P>
In the second phase of remodeling, the city hopes to open a 99-seat theater, 
office space and extra classrooms on the building's second floor. Sherburn said 
the Cultural Affairs Department will probably ask for $200,000 from the city's 
Capital Improvements Fund for the top-floor renovation. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the second phase would begin in July, and could be finished by the 
end of 1990. Sherburn said he is waiting for a final estimate from an architect 
before requesting the new funds. The city allocated $175,000 for work on the 
main floor. 
</P>
<P>
The center was scheduled to open last winter, but remodeling problems forced 
delays. Sherburn said a public support group, the Friends of Lankershim Arts 
Center, will help bring exhibits to the facility, and do a lot of volunteer 
work. Already, 500 names appear on the group's mailing list. 
</P>
<P>
The center, which is close to a senior citizens apartment complex and an 
elementary school, will serve as a neighborhood information center. "We'll help 
people with how to get grants, where to go set up exhibits, everything," 
Sherburn said. 
</P>
<P>
Artists aren't wasting any time. 
</P>
<P>
"I just requested a monthlong show," said B. Lorraine Strieby, president of the 
175-member San Fernando Valley Art Club. "This is a great opportunity for 
people in the Valley. I know a lot of people in the club are going to love 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Leona Rhodef, who works with graphics, oil, and acrylics, sees the center as 
much more than gallery space. "It will be great to exchange ideas with other 
artists," Rhodef said. "That can only help our art." 
</P>
<P>
To celebrate the center's opening, a weekend of entertainment has been 
scheduled, including performances by the Whirling Winds Trio, the Azuma Sumako 
School of Japanese Classical Dance, and the Dolcian Singers. A new version of 
"Frankenstein" will be presented June 15 by Frankly Speaking Productions. 
</P>
<P>
An international art exhibition, opening June 17 and continuing through July 
20, will feature artists from Los Angeles and Mexico City. Artwork by selected 
Mexican artists will also be on loan to the center from the Lodi Gallery in 
Pasadena.

DISABLED ACTORS TAKE THE LEAD IN CSUN THEATRICAL PRODUCTION; 
</P>

DRAMA: UNIVERSITY PROGRAM HAS SPENT THE LAST FIVE YEARS PUTTING ON PLAYS WITH 
AN AMBITIOUS MIXTURE OF DISABLED AND ABLE-BODIED TALENT.

<P>
On stage, the cast was rehearsing the opening scene of "Specs," a futuristic 
comedy thriller that will have its world premiere tonight at Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Cast members made it through the first scene until three extras near the front 
of the stage began to move toward the wings. 
</P>
<P>
"No, no, no!" cried out director Gary Guidinger, who was sitting in the back of 
the theater. "You three in front," Guidinger continued, "you stay there. You 
don't move off stage until the lights go out." 
</P>
<P>
One of the extras, Loren DePhillips, looked puzzled. "The lights are still on?" 
he asked. "I thought we'd be in blackout by now." 
</P>
<P>
The stage, as all those present who could see knew, was still brightly lit. But 
DePhillips is blind, as are several of the cast members. Others have cerebral 
palsy; one is in a wheelchair, and several walk with difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
"Specs," by San Jose-based writer Jill Sardegna, is a production of CSUN's 
Artistic Cultural and Entertainment program, which since 1985 has been putting 
on plays with a mixture of disabled and able-bodied performers. 
</P>
<P>
It's a challenging forum for a director. "In one scene we have three blind 
people on stage, alone, so there is no one for them to work off of," said 
director Gary Guidinger, who is able-bodied. Guidinger has worked several times 
with disabled playwrights, but this is his first experience with disabled 
actors. "To make matters more interesting, in that scene the three blind actors 
are playing sighted people. We had to limit the movement and work out every 
move they make, exactly." 
</P>
<P>
At this first dress rehearsal, the movements were still to be fine-tuned. When 
one of the blind characters gestured to another, he hit his fellow actor 
lightly across the face. These kind of accidents are old hat at ACE productions 
and are more the source of humor than frustration. It is the group's sixth 
production. 
</P>
<P>
"We started with 'The Odd Couple' in 1985," said Jim Hammitt, 47, the program 
coordinator of ACE, which operates out of CSUN's Office of Disabled Students. 
Hammitt, who has cerebral palsy due to a birth injury, was the president of the 
Disabled Student Organization at the school when the ACE program started. 
</P>
<P>
"The school had a special arts festival for disabled people," he said. "In 1984 
one of the workshops was in acting and people were so excited about it, they 
wanted to do more." 
</P>
<P>
One of the first rules ACE made was that standard plays would not be changed to 
reflect that they were being performed with disabled actors. "If an actor is in 
a wheelchair but there is nothing in the play about it, it's not mentioned," 
Hammitt said. "He just plays the part." 
</P>
<P>
Little bits of business are allowed. "I had some fun adapting the character to 
me when I played Felix in 'The Odd Couple,' " said Steve Pailet, 35, who has 
gotten around by wheelchair since 1978 when he was struck by a car in a 
hit-and-run accident. Like several of the actors in "Specs," Pailet has been in 
other ACE shows. 
</P>
<P>
"When I wanted to show that Felix was mad at Oscar," Pailet said, "I would 
hoist myself up on the wheelchair so I could look him in the eye. It got a good 
laugh." 
</P>
<P>
Neil Simon's comedy about two roommates -- one lackadaisical and one 
compulsively neat -- was used, in subtle ways, to break down stereotypes. 
"Everyone thinks blind people live in neat, orderly rooms," Hammitt said. "So 
we cast a blind actor as Oscar, the messy one. We wanted to blow that image." 
</P>
<P>
Since the first play, ACE has sponsored productions of "The Glass Menagerie," 
"Butterflys Are Free," "The Mousetrap" and "Barefoot in the Park." 
</P>
<P>
"Specs" was obtained for ACE by Harry Murphy, the head of CSUN's Office of 
Disabled Students. Murphy had worked with the playwright on a museum project 
for disabled children. "He told me if I ever had a play with a disabled 
character in it, I should let him know," said the writer, Jill Sardegna. "I 
liked the idea, so I turned a screenplay I was working on into a play and made 
the main character blind." Nearly a year ago, ACE made arrangements to produce 
the play's premiere. 
</P>
<P>
Casting, which was also open to non-student actors, began six months ago. "We 
always want an integrated cast," Hammitt said. "We want to show that 
able-bodied and disabled people could work together to create an artistic 
event." But if two people -- one disabled and one able-bodied -- of equal 
talent and ability audition for a role, the part goes to the disabled person. 
</P>
<P>
The title role of Specs, a 21st-Century policeman who is sent back to 1990 to 
solve a murder mystery, was won by Rick Boggs, 27, of Van Nuys. Boggs, who has 
been blind since age 4, got into acting by chance. That occurred in 1987, when 
the school where Boggs trained with his guide dog was used for the filming of 
an episode of the CBS-TV show "The Wizard." 
</P>
<P>
"They called me and said they needed extras," Boggs said. "When I got there 
they still needed to cast a speaking role. They lined up 10 of us to try us 
out, and I got the part." 
</P>
<P>
He went on to appear in an educational film and a commercial for a bank in 
Oklahoma that offers customers financial statements in Braille. Boggs, who is a 
musician and makes his living by producing radio commercials and other audio 
tape products, would like to do more acting, but not in just the traditional 
blind roles. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started acting classes at Valley College, I told the teacher I didn't 
just want to do 'Butterflies Are Free,' " he said. "I want to work on getting 
roles where if I'm blind it's just incidental. I don't see any reason I 
couldn't play a psychologist on 'General Hospital,' for instance, if someone 
gave me the chance. It would not have to be a major thing that that character 
was blind." 
</P>
<P>
"Specs" will be presented at 8 tonight through Sunday at Cal State Northridge's 
Little Theater in the Speech and Drama Building, 18111 Nordhoff St., 
Northridge. Tickets are $7. For information, call (818) 885-2869.

Dennis Doyle vividly remembers the Sunday morning 15 years ago when a visiting 
Irish priest conducted Mass in Gaelic. Doyle, a third-generation Irishman, had 
never heard the ancient language of his ancestors. 
</P>

"Something inside me stirred," said Doyle, an English teacher at Glendale 
Community College, and church pianist. "I woke up. I wanted to learn about my 
culture, my history. I began studying the harp. It's the national instrument of 
Ireland." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Doyle, 37, is an acclaimed harpist, specializing in Ireland's 
traditional forms of music. He tours festivals and gives concerts and lectures 
throughout the country several months each year. Doyle will perform at the 16th 
annual Grand National Irish Fair and Music Festival, from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
Saturday and Sunday at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Dennis is not only a fantastic musician, but he's also the director of the 
festival's entire traditional music section," said Terrance Anderson, president 
of the Grand National Irish Fair. Other performers at the fair include Patrick 
Street, Paddy Noonan's Irish Cabaret, Barley Bree's Irish Showband, Paddy 
Reilly and Eileen Ivers. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional Irish songs date back 2,000 years. Unlike the popular pub songs of 
today, old-style music was exclusively for the aristocracy, Doyle said. A big 
change in Irish culture occurred following the Battle of Boyne in 1692, when 
the British defeated the Gaelic forces. "The Gaelic language was outlawed," he 
said. The Gaelic music of the upper-classes was driven underground. It was 
passed on and maintained by peasants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's Irish folk music. Sometimes it's called 'hedge school' music because 
the Irish couldn't study their language or music in schools, so they secretly 
gathered along the hedges to learn," Doyle said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to old-style Gaelic music, entertainment at the two-day fair 
includes storytellers, jugglers, magicians, Irish step dancing, theater 
readings, an Irish wolfhound show and the West Coast Connemara Horse Show, said 
Anderson, a Studio City resident and founding member of the festival. 
</P>
<P>
There will also be gifts and food available. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first year's attendance was about 1,500," he said. "We're looking at about 
50,000 people now -- not really surprising when you think about how many 
Americans have some Irish blood," Anderson said. "But it's more than that. The 
Irish have a joy of life that permeates the very soul. Just think about it. 
What's the one holiday that everyone celebrates? The wearing of the green -- 
St. Patrick's Day." 
</P>
<P>
 The Grand National Irish Fair and Music Festival from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
Saturday and Sunday at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center, 480 Riverside Drive, 
Burbank. Admission is $12, $7 for seniors, $4 for children 13 to 17 and free

PUBLICATIONS: REDONDO UNION HIGH SCHOOL OFFICIALS RESTRICTED ENTRIES IN A 
LITERARY MAGAZINE THEY THOUGHT WERE OFFENSIVE. IRATE STUDENTS ARE CHARGING 
CENSORSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Amid charges of censorship, students at Redondo Union High School went to press 
today with a student literary magazine in which more than half a dozen 
allegedly offensive artworks, poems and stories had been altered or excised at 
the behest of school officials. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Powell, the 18-year-old editor of the student publication Opus, said the 
changes were forced on staffers after a teacher who was not involved with the 
magazine seized the galleys 2 1/2 weeks ago and complained to the principal 
that some submissions were sacrilegious and obscene. 
</P>
<P>
Among the items the teacher found objectionable, Powell said, were a poem by an 
honor student titled "(expletive) Authority" and a drawing of a demon 
swallowing a crucifix on which the face of Christ was a Happy Face logo. 
</P>
<P>
"The material that was presented to me was very obscene," said Principal Jack 
Clement, who added that he responded by convening a five-member committee of 
faculty and administration "to review the literary merit" of the publication. 
Clement said he was particularly concerned that parents and others in the 
community would be offended by the profanity and religious and sexual 
references in some of the works. 
</P>
<P>
"As a school official, I feel I have a responsibility to make sure the image 
our school projects reflects our various audiences," he said. "Yes, there ought 
to be freedom of expression. I firmly believe in the First Amendment. But we 
serve several different audiences, not only in our school but in our community, 
and our charge is to bring out the best in our students in terms of their 
writing and talent." 
</P>
<P>
But students disagreed, as did the magazine's faculty adviser, David Lemire, 
who, like Clement, sat on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the things (Clement) wanted edited were so insignificant," said 
Lemire, an English teacher who has been volunteer adviser to the magazine for 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
Lemire noted, too, that this is Clement's first year with the district. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he just wanted to avoid any potential phone call from any potential 
parent of any potential frame of mind," Lemire said. 
</P>
<P>
Lemire said that even though the author of the poem had already agreed to 
change its title and the magazine staff volunteered to excise the sketch, 
Clement alerted the committee to dozens of submissions that he felt should be 
censored, ranging from a sketch of a serpent entwined around a crucifix to the 
use of such words as rape. Most of Clement's suggestions -- including those two 
examples -- were overruled by the committee, Lemire and Clement agreed. 
</P>
<P>
But, Lemire added, the principal exercised veto power over the committee in 
some cases, insisting that all profanity involving the word god be removed from 
the students' short stories and poems. And in several other cases, the 
committee upheld Clement's advice, changing the word whore to woman in one 
poem, removing the names of public figures from others and asking that some 
drawings be changed to remove offensive material, he said. In the drawings, 
editor Powell added, a Happy Face logo and the word censored were placed over 
the objectionable portion of the artwork. 
</P>
<P>
Clement denied that he had used veto power over the committee. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an open, collaborative effort, and . . . we walked away feeling that we 
had enhanced the quality of the product," Clement said. 
</P>
<P>
Lemire said he and Powell plan to bring the matter before the South Bay Union 
High School District trustees at their next meeting. Moreover, he said, he has 
consulted the American Civil Liberties Union about his concerns, along with the 
Washington-based People for the American Way, a national First Amendment rights 
watchdog organization. Ironically, People for the American Way recently lauded 
Redondo Beach's elementary trustees for withstanding efforts by a local 
Christian parents' group to censor the grade-school reading curricula. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I can tell, it seems to be a pretty broad and sweeping attempt at 
censorship," said Deanna Duby, senior staff attorney for the group, adding that 
many of the changes appeared to be illegal under the California Education Code. 
The code expressly prohibits censorship of student publications by school 
officials except where a publication is obscene, libelous, slanderous or an 
incitement to unlawful or disruptive activity. 
</P>
<P>
School Board President William Beverly, told about the censored materials, 
added that he was surprised the students had not yet complained to the board. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen what the offending works were, but from what I'm hearing, much 
of what the committee found objectionable wouldn't upset a person of ordinary 
sensibilities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But school Supt. Walter Hale defended Clement's actions. 
</P>
<P>
"What is commonly misunderstood by youngsters is that they have rights, but 
they also have responsibilities to maintain professional standards of language 
and journalism, and from what I understand, those standards were not upheld," 
Hale said. "The school has some rights, too, about what it's going to publish." 
</P>
<P>
Students, meanwhile, remained incensed about the controversy, which has spawned 
a line of anti-censorship buttons and reams of flyers protesting Clement's 
actions. Powell said the censored version will go on sale at $3.50 a copy on 
campus next week, and he expects the issue will sell out. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he said, he is disappointed, not only at the decision to meddle 
with student artwork and literature, but also at Clement's refusal to include 
students on what Powell refers to as "the censorship committee." 
</P>
<P>
Powell said that the 96-page magazine included upbeat and life-affirming 
material as well as meditations on the dark side of life, and that the censored 
material was taken out of context. 
</P>
<P>
"Opus 1990 is the result of thousands of hours of hard work and iron 
dedication. And now . . . this magazine has been threatened with extinction by 
certain adults who believe students should be tried, sentenced and their ideas 
murdered if they don't agree with what is usually accepted," wrote Powell in 
the magazine's foreword. 
</P>
<P>
"Opus has been a real civics lesson. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy echoes a similar incident in 1986 at the school district's 
other high school, Mira Costa. In that case, two poems, one about drug 
addiction, the other about a broken love affair, were cut out of the school 
literary magazine by the principal and an English teacher who felt they had 
sacrilegious and sexual overtones that would be inappropriate for younger 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
The students brought the matter to the school board, which overruled the 
principal and ordered that the magazine be republished in its original state.

LANCASTER WOMAN GUILTY OF MURDER; 
</P>
<P>
VERDICT: JURY DID NOT BELIEVE MOTHER WAS DEFENDING HERSELF WHEN SHE SHOT MAN 
FOUR TIMES BECAUSE HE GAVE HER DAUGHTER DRUGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Lancaster woman was convicted Thursday of first-degree murder in the death of 
a construction worker she accused of giving her teen-age daughter drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancaster Superior Court jury rejected the woman's claim that she was 
defending herself and her daughter when she shot Kevin Furman repeatedly in his 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors, who deliberated two days, said they did not believe 41-year-old Belita 
Fox when she said she confronted Furman at his house in Lancaster to warn him 
about giving drugs to her teen-age daughter. Fox said she shot Furman because 
he rose to his knees in bed about three feet from her, which she interpreted as 
a threatening move. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence didn't bear it out," juror Mary Ann Floyd said. "We explored 
everything. . . . To a person we are confident that we made the right 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
The trajectory of the bullets and testimony of an eyewitness, Furman's 
roommate, contradicted Fox's account, indicating that Furman, 23, was prone in 
bed when Fox shot him four times shortly after midnight, Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Fox testified that she sat by the body for at least half an hour before calling 
her 17-year-old daughter, Cheryl, and then calling authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The jury rejected the defense portrayal of an anguished mother fighting to 
protect her child. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Vincent Oliver described Furman as "drug scum" and the "top man" 
in a drug house, referring in closing arguments to the ravages of the drug 
problem nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
But juror Jaime Levario said of the victim: "To me drug scum is someone who's 
ruthless. . . . He didn't seem like that." 
</P>
<P>
One witness testified that Furman sold methamphetamines on two occasions and 
used drugs occasionally. He testified that the defendant's daughter used 
methamphetamines and marijuana at the house, but Furman was not present at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Fox, who cried frequently during the four-day trial, remained calm as the 
verdict was read and deputies took her into custody. She had been free on 
$100,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
She faces a sentence of 27 years to life when she appears for sentencing before 
Judge Margaret Grignon on June 28. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver said he plans to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Furman's mother, Jean Harmon, and a contingent of relatives and friends wept 
and hugged each other and jurors outside the courtroom. Harmon said the verdict 
partially vindicated her dead son of Fox's drug-dealing allegations, which led 
Harmon to organize a "Justice for Kevin" campaign that included buttons and 
T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
"She is behind bars where she belongs," Harmon said. "She won't be able to hurt 
anyone else's children." 
</P>
<P>
In reaching their decision, jurors rejected additional defenses that Fox was 
drunk and did not know the gun was loaded at the time of the shooting. Panel 
members said they agreed with Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Foltz's charge that Fox 
targeted Furman because she irrationally blamed him for her daughter's running 
away from home and the breakup of her family. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe she planned it," Levario said. "She thought it through. She wanted 
revenge on somebody."

DOCTOR JAILED FOR MEDI-CAL FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A doctor who headed a Huntington Park clinic has been sentenced to 16 months in 
prison and fined $347,000 on 17 felony and misdemeanor charges, including 
collecting false Medi-Cal claims and aiding employees who practiced medicine 
without a license. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Suresh Gandotra, 41, was taken into custody after sentencing last week. 
Gandotra's wife, Rita, 39, was sentenced to 180 days in County Jail, five 
years' probation and fined $10,000 on five felony counts of Medi-Cal fraud and 
grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
An appeal is pending, said lawyer Daryl L. Smith, who represents the Gandotras. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Richard Rojo presented evidence during the trial that 
indicated the Gandotras defrauded the state of $8,600 by billing Medi-Cal for 
services provided by unlicensed employees and for services never rendered. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court jury in March found Dr. Gandotra guilty of 14 felony counts 
and three misdemeanor counts ranging from grand theft related to fraudulent 
Medi-Cal claims, to aiding and abetting the unlawful practice of medicine. Rita 
Gandotra was found guilty of five felony counts of filing false Medi-Cal 
claims, conspiracy to cheat the government and grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
Rojo said Dr. Gandotra performed only about 10% of the services that were 
required to be rendered by a licensed physician. Unlicensed employees -- 
doctors from Mexico who were not licensed to practice in the United States -- 
provided the bulk of the medical services, Rojo said. 
</P>
<P>
Rojo said he did not know how many patients received medical care and 
prescriptions from unlicensed personnel at Gandotra's Coast Urgent Care Medical 
Clinic. The clinic's clientele generally is poor and Spanish-speaking. Rojo 
alleged in a Superior Court trial that the fraudulent billing and unlawful 
practice of medicine had been going on at least since 1983. He said there was 
no evidence that clients had been injured. 
</P>
<P>
"Hundreds came in and out," Rojo said. "They were open 24 hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
The case was referred to the attorney general's office after state auditors 
detected a suspiciously high number of Medi-Cal claims, Rojo said. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Urgent Care Medical Clinic will continue to operate out of a 
one-story building on Soto Street near Slauson Avenue, acting administrator 
James Bartholomew said this week. Gandotra had run the clinic until he was 
jailed last week. Another doctor has been brought in to treat patients, 
Bartholomew said. 
</P>
<P>
Gandotra and two clinic employees, Carlos Cuellar and Ricardo Santos, were 
arrested at the clinic and charged in January, 1989. Rita Gandotra and a 
billing clerk were charged later. 
</P>
<P>
Cuellar and Santos, who originally were charged with practicing medicine 
without a license, among other things, each pleaded no contest to two 
misdemeanor counts of forging prescriptions. Cuellar and Santos, both doctors 
in Mexico, were given two years' probation, fined $1,500 and ordered to perform 
100 hours of community service, Rojo said. The two testified against the 
Gandotras. 
</P>
<P>
Charges were dropped against the billing clerk.

WEEKENDER: COLORFUL GLIMPSES OF YESTERDAY ARE STITCHED TOGETHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By Gerald Faris What: Quilt and Dollhouse Exhibit. When: Saturday, 10 a.m.-5 
p.m. Where: Assistance League of San Pedro-Palos Verdes, 1441 W. 8th St., San 
Pedro. Admission: $2 donation; $1 seniors and children. Information: 832-8355.

<TEXT>
<P>
Dollhouses and miniature rooms, with their small, authentic furnishings and 
tiny figures, are invitations to fantasies -- little glimpses of other times 
and places. 
</P>
<P>
Quilts that dazzle with their colors, patterns and intricate stitchery are 
sometimes a window on family histories or reflect the inner thoughts of the 
people who make them. 
</P>
<P>
A collection of these things -- miniatures and colorful quilts -- will be 
brought together Saturday in San Pedro when the Las Primeras Auxiliary of the 
Assistance League of San Pedro-Palos Verdes stages its annual Quilt and 
Dollhouse Exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
The long-running event raises funds for South Bay charities supported by the 
league. The 60 or so quilts to be displayed range from an unfinished 1880 quilt 
with a design suggesting a frontier log cabin to several made just last year. A 
1990 panel from the AIDS Memorial Quilt, which commemorates people who have 
died of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, will also be shown. 
</P>
<P>
The quilts are a kaleidoscope of patterns -- from geometric zigzags to flowers, 
stars and animals -- and colors, ranging from old-fashioned calico to shining 
satin. 
</P>
<P>
Quilt exhibit Chairman Mitzi Cress sees quilting as "an expression of the inner 
self. . . . You get an idea, think about it and start a quilt, and you never 
know what it will be like until it's finished." 
</P>
<P>
Cress and general show Co-Chairman Louise Campbell says some visitors are 
inspired to begin quilting or resume work on quilts they tucked away long ago. 
</P>
<P>
In the world of miniatures, the league will display 10 crafted fantasies, 
including such things as a circus museum, country store, thatched-roof cottage 
and a Halloween party complete with a witch. One of them, a horse corral 
decorated for Christmas, was made as a class project by Omar Vasquez, a 
sixth-grader at Carson Street School. 
</P>
<P>
The standout dollhouse will be the turn-of-the-century world of tiny, 
intricately woven Victorian wicker furniture and baby buggies created by Marie 
Terrones. The San Pedro artisan began her craft seven years ago after she tried 
to find a dollhouse for her daughter, who was then 2, and didn't like what was 
available. 
</P>
<P>
With a long veranda containing a porch swing, tables and chairs, the miniature 
three-story blue house rises to a peaked roof, where wispy threads of cotton 
simulate smoke coming from the chimney. 
</P>
<P>
A tiny bird, fashioned from real feathers, lives inside a wicker cage. Prams 
have lacy canopies to ward off the sun, colorful patchwork quilts adorn the 
elaborate beds, tiny glasses rest on a closed book, and a dressing table 
contains a mirror and brush the size of fingernails. 
</P>
<P>
Terrones, who uses antique doilies and handkerchiefs for her throw rugs and 
curtains, calls her house "my own small world" that offers an instant retreat 
from the real world. 
</P>
<P>
People attending the show can buy $1 tickets for chances to take home three 
prizes: a handmade Irish chain quilt, which gets its name from the chain-like 
stitching; a miniature dollhouse with shingles, porch and fireplace, and one of 
Terrones' miniature wicker baby buggies. Home-made cakes and cookies will also 
be sold. 
</P>
<P>
Cress said quilts are appealing to some people because of craftsmanship in the 
colors and stitching. Others are interested in what quilts have to say, she 
said, citing a quilt made by a cancer patient as a thank-you to the people who 
took care of her. It was never finished. 
</P>
<P>
They are art and history combined, she said. "People look at a 100-year-old 
quilt and wonder what (the person who made it) was thinking about and 
imagining." 
</P>
<P>
Terrones, who has made her wicker furniture for miniature collectors around the 
world, said the appeal of dollhouses is having "a piece of the past. They make 
people feel good. When they get depressed, they can look into the rooms and it 
totally takes them away." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell says she sees a strong link between both dollhouses and quilts. "They 
have a lot of history and are something that can be passed on to other people."

AS OTHER EXECUTIVES LEAVE, IACOCCA DECIDES TO STAY ON

<P>
Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca said Thursday that he will remain head of the 
nation's third-largest auto maker after his contract expires in December, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement comes a week after his heir-apparent, Gerald Greenwald, 
resigned to head the employee group bidding for the parent of United Airlines. 
Greenwald's departure and the resignation of other top Chrysler officials last 
month for various reasons left many unsettled questions about the auto maker. 
</P>
<P>
"He made that statement to calm the concerns of both the people inside the 
company and those on the outside," said auto industry analyst Raymond J. Mucci 
at Baird, Patrick &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Iacocca, 65, announced his decision after meeting with the nominating committee 
of Chrysler's board. A Chrysler spokesman said Iacocca will remain with the 
company for an undetermined length of time after December, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an outstanding management team at Chrysler," Iacocca said in a 
statement. "One of my primary responsibilities is to put an orderly succession 
plan in place. We're going to do that according to our own timetable, and it 
won't be driven by a big X on a calendar." 
</P>
<P>
While credited with Chrysler's dramatic turnaround in the early 1980s, Iacocca 
has been accused of neglecting the auto maker in the mid- and late 1980s while 
writing and promoting best-selling books and heading the effort to restore the 
Statue of Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
Iacocca, who joined Chrysler in 1979 after the late Henry Ford II fired him as 
president of Ford Motor Co., had hinted in recent weeks that he might change 
his mind about stepping down in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to tell you exactly what I'm going to do because I haven't made 
up my mind yet," Iacocca said in response to a stockholder's question at the 
company's annual meeting in Universal City last month. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials and analysts said it was Iacocca's indecision that triggered 
Greenwald's departure. In addition to Greenwald, Chrysler's vice president of 
international operations, Michael Hammes, quit to join Black &amp; Decker, and 
Treasurer Fred Zuckerman said he planned to leave this summer.

Shortly after Greenwald's resignation, Chrysler promoted Chief Financial 
Officer Steve Miller, 48, to vice chairman and, as a result, Miller became a 
serious contender to succeed Iacocca. 
</P>
<P>
Another leading candidate for Iacocca's job is Robert Lutz, 58, who heads the 
Chrysler Motors division and who assumed some of Greenwald's responsibilities. 
As was Miller, Lutz was an Iacocca recruit from Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Iacocca and his newly empowered lieutenants face numerous challenges. Chrysler 
saw profit for the first three months of 1990 dive 80% from the same period 
last year. Sales have fallen 13% in the first five months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chrysler must replace its aging line of K-cars, whose strong sales 
record helped restore the company's financial health, said Mucci. "The major 
challenge is the expiration of the K-car," he said.

TRUMP DENIES ANY CASINOS ARE FOR SALE; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: THE FLAMBOYANT NEW YORK DEVELOPER STILL HAS TO WORK OUT HIS CASH-FLOW 
PROBLEMS. SOME ANALYSTS ARE DOUBTFUL.

<P>
Under a withering barrage of publicity, New York developer Donald Trump took 
the offensive Thursday, dispatching his top gambling executive to deny that any 
of Trump's three casinos in Atlantic City are on the auction block. 
</P>
<P>
"The properties are not for sale," Edward Tracy told a news conference at the 
Taj Mahal Hotel &amp; Casino, the $1-billion gambling house that Trump opened 
this spring. "Not Trump Plaza. Not Trump Castle. Not Trump Taj Mahal. We are 
going to produce an avalanche of cash from these three facilities." 
</P>
<P>
The casino operations are supposed to be the cash cows of the Trump financial 
empire, but lately they have been shaken by management turmoil, employee 
layoffs and a sharp slowdown in the Atlantic City gambling market. 
</P>
<P>
"Donald's problems (in Atlantic City) are not just his alone," said a spokesman 
for Resorts International, which owns a casino adjacent to the Taj. "The whole 
industry is having (financial) problems." 
</P>
<P>
Tracy confirmed that 450 employees, mostly food-service workers, had recently 
been discharged from the Taj even though the casino hotel opened only two 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy's news conference was an attempt to counter endless rumors about Trump's 
plans and to quell escalating doubts about the viability of his real estate 
empire, centered largely in Atlantic City and Manhattan. (He is also part of 
the investment group that owns the Ambassador Hotel site on Wilshire Boulevard 
in Los Angeles.) 
</P>
<P>
Swaggering and abrupt, Trump gained a larger-than-life reputation in the 1980s 
as a colorful, high-living real estate developer who pulled off big deals while 
quarreling loudly with anyone who got in his way. But 1990 has not gone well, 
and the Trump mystique of invincibility has all but been erased in a few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Trump is caught in a severe cash bind caused by lower-than-expected casino 
revenues and a real estate recession in the Northeast that has rendered him 
unable to sell or finance his Manhattan properties at an attractive price, 
financial experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Trump confirmed that he was negotiating with his major 
creditors, four New York banks that are uneasy about his loans of $2 billion. 
The banks reportedly want Trump to scale down his lavish lifestyle and 
restructure his finances, possibly by selling some assets. 
</P>
<P>
News of Trump's latest financial troubles this week severely depressed the 
value of the bonds used to finance construction of his casinos, and some 
financial experts now wonder privately if he can solve his problems without 
being forced into bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
The problems may come to a head next week when a $25-million payment to 
bondholders of the Trump Castle falls due. Tracy declined to say whether the 
payment would be made. Trump did not attend the press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Many financial experts believe that Trump's troubles stem largely from his 
penchant for buying trophy real estate at top-dollar prices, betting that the 
value of these assets could only go up. 
</P>
<P>
Some of his best-known properties are the Trump Shuttle, which he bought last 
year from Eastern Airlines, and the Plaza, one of New York's most elegant 
hotels. Both are said to be losing money because Trump went so heavily into 
debt to buy them. 
</P>
<P>
"He was convinced that things were always going to go up," said James Grant, 
publisher of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, a financial-industry newsletter. 
"Well, they didn't go up." 
</P>
<P>
Trump's problems are also evident in Atlantic City, where he operates three 
casinos in competition with one another in a gambling town that has shown 
little revenues growth in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, he's fighting himself," one competitor said. "One (casino) is 
cannibalizing the other." 
</P>
<P>
Trump's problems also highlight the damage done last October when his top 
casino executive, Stephen Hyde, was killed in a helicopter crash. Hyde's death 
left a giant hole in the Trump organization that has yet to be filled, one 
competitor said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hyde acted as a buffer between the rank-and-file and Donald," he said. "Since 
Steve's death, Trump has not been able to attract the people that he wanted." 
</P>
<P>
And since Hyde's death, Trump has taken an increasingly active role in running 
the casinos, with decidedly mixed results. Several top executives have either 
quit or been demoted in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Taj is doing a brisk business, the money it brings in is not enough 
to pay the bills, outside experts maintain. The opulent Taj, far and away the 
gaudiest casino ever built along the Atlantic City Boardwalk, was the top 
revenue producer in May, with gambling winnings alone of $36.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The Taj is doing a terrific business," one casino-industry expert said, "but 
it's terribly expensive to operate." 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts believe the Taj needs to generate a minimum of nearly $40 
million a month, and perhaps much more, just to break even. Tracy disputed that 
figure, though, saying the break-even level is about $33 million a month. He 
added that the Taj brought in $50 million in revenues in May. 
</P>
<P>
Gambling winnings at Trump Castle have been flat this year and fell 17% in May 
compared to May, 1989, a showing that placed it ninth among the city's 12 
casinos, according to figures from Atlantic City Action, a casino-industry 
newsletter. Trump Plaza was No. 2 in May, but revenues for the first five 
months of 1990 fell more than 2% compared to last year.

BIG APPLE IS FASCINATED BY THE BIG FALL

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As tycoon Donald J. Trump's financial troubles deepened this week, the 
Shakespeare &amp; Co. bookstore in Manhattan set up a special display of 
Trump's "Art of the Deal" with a tin cup and a sign: "Brother, can you spare a 
dime?" 
</P>
<P>
The cup quickly filled up with coins and the store with "laughs and 
snickering," said Felice Rose, manager of the Upper West Side landmark. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction was typical. New Yorkers don't like to see a man down, you 
understand. But when Queens' own sultan of swagger is getting his comeuppance, 
maybe it's inevitable that there's some ill-concealed delight mixed with the 
sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 60-odd Midtown Manhattan tenants who battled Trump in the courts for 
five years over his plan to evict them, "reactions have varied from glee to 
concern that this was going to stain New York's image," said Richard Fischbein, 
the lawyer who represented them. 
</P>
<P>
Other real estate developers in town "feel the man pretty much had it coming," 
said one important local real estate investor, who asked to remain 
unidentified. 
</P>
<P>
Wrote Gail Collins, a columnist in the New York Daily News: "We are about to 
have one of those magic New York moments where people of all creeds, races and 
economic backgrounds join together in a single thought: 
</P>
<P>
"Hehehehehehe." 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's having a real good time casting stones. It's universal," said Liz 
Smith, the Daily News gossip columnist, a one-time Trump friend who's had 
frigid relations with him since she seemed to take wife Ivana's side in their 
marital dispute. "This is the perfect end-of-the-'80s story of the mighty 
falling, and the man in the street can't help but enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
"Donald Trump has conducted his affairs, and everything else, with so much 
publicity for so long," she said. "He's lived by the sword, and now he's dying 
by it." 
</P>
<P>
It's a curious measure of New Yorkers' admiration for Trump that many believe 
The Donald (as Ivana called him in happier times) has stirred up the publicity 
in a tactic to avoid paying her a large divorce settlement. 
</P>
<P>
In dozens of interviews Thursday in front of the Trump Tower and Trump's Plaza 
Hotel, few thought the magnate was actually in deep trouble. Many -- especially 
women -- insisted that the reports of financial distress were just aimed at 
keeping Ivana from her fair share of the dough. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe it," said Susanne Gyuro, who was window shopping at Trump 
Tower with a daughter from California. "He's just saying it so his wife doesn't 
get more money." 
</P>
<P>
"It's all a big scam," said Joe Picard, an IBM employee who was sitting beneath 
the Pulitzer Fountain, across the street from the Plaza. "He's the kind of 
person who loves the attention and who loves to put people on." 
</P>
<P>
Picard also thought that Trump might be just seeking advantage in divorce 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Many New Yorkers came to admire this son of a Swedish immigrant as Trump 
accumulated hotels, office towers, casinos and airlines, and gave each his 
name. But he's also been making his share of enemies in this town -- and 
elsewhere -- for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
When the Central Park South tenants group defeated Trump's attempt to replace 
their building with a hotel, Trump sued lawyer Fischbein and his firm on 
federal racketeering charges. (He lost.) Trump once sued a Chicago Tribune 
architecture critic for criticizing one of his buildings; he recently tried to 
have columnist Smith fired. 
</P>
<P>
He apparently succeeded in arranging the firing of a Philadelphia stock analyst 
who was not sufficiently enthusiastic about Trump's casino properties. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Trump was delicate enough to tell the press that the wife of rival 
developer Leonard Stern was calling him up for dates. And he ignited a battle 
with former New York Mayor Ed Koch by calling for Koch to quit because Trump 
believed him unfit for the job. 
</P>
<P>
"If people screw me, I screw back in spades," Trump was once quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
But some New Yorkers have concluded that Trump's fabled aggressive powers won't 
help him now. A cartoon Wednesday in the New York Post showed a dazed Trump on 
Skid Row, peering from a cardboard box labeled "Trump Carton." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Trump is also hearing expressions of sympathy from some unexpected 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Spy magazine, based in New York, has made Trump and his wife the butt of its 
satire for years. Now, "we're gloating, yes, but we also feel some glimmer of 
sympathy for the guy," said Kurt Andersen, Spy's editor. "And we're afraid that 
if he disappears too fast, we'll lack for a large, entertaining subject." 
</P>
<P>
Government officials and editorialists have warned that the area's stagnant 
economy and city's depleted treasury can't afford the loss of any of the 30,000 
jobs that are directly or indirectly dependent on his empire. 
</P>
<P>
And some New Yorkers consider Trump a hometown hero at a time when they're in 
short supply. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the Plaza, in the line of horse-drawn carriages waiting to take hotel 
guests on trips through Central Park, carriage driver Thomas Moran said he'd 
hate to see Trump fall. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese are buying everything," Moran said. "Trump is the only American 
who seems to be able to buy property in New York." 
</P>
<P>
Liz Smith said that, in her interviews with Trump this week, he sounds anything 
but chastened. Yet she has lots of sympathy for him and believes that his 
bankruptcy would be "terrible for the city." 
</P>
<P>
"I think he'll sell a few things and regroup, and we'll see more of him," she 
said. Will the new Trump be a wiser Trump? "I'm not sure he'll ever be 
restrained; it's just not in his temperament," Smith said.

WAL-MART BESTS SEARS AS RETAILERS POST MAY SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many of the nation's big retailers on Thursday reported sluggish May sales 
growth and blamed unseasonable weather for discouraging shoppers. But Wal-Mart 
Stores bucked the trend: Its sales for the month surpassed No. 1 Sears, Roebuck 
&amp; Co. and No. 2 K mart. 
</P>
<P>
Wal-Mart's sales soared 24% to $2.527 billion, passing Sears' sales of $2.502 
billion, which were up a scant 0.9%, and K mart's, which rose 10.4% to $2.437 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Wal-Mart, headquartered in Bentonville, Ark., said its comparable-store sales 
managed a double-digit gain, rising 11%. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Wal-Mart could overtake its bigger rivals in terms of national 
sales by year-end. 
</P>
<P>
Retail industry analysts said abnormally cool temperatures and heavy rainfall, 
particularly in the Midwest and East, restrained customers in buying summer 
clothing and other seasonal merchandise, such as air conditioners, lawn mowers 
or outdoor furniture. 
</P>
<P>
"That clearly did have an impact," said Thomas Tashjian, an analyst at Seidler 
Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Sales in stores on the West Coast, in Texas, Arizona and other parts of the 
Southwest were robust to respectable.

Judge OKs Greyhound Expenses: A federal bankruptcy court judge authorized 
Greyhound Lines Inc. to pay salaries and operating expenses after union 
attorneys made sure the strike-bound bus company's executives would not receive 
"golden parachute" bonuses. At the hearing in Brownsville, Tex., U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court Judge Richard S. Schmidt ordered the U.S. Trustee's Office to 
start setting up a single committee of unsecured creditors. Greyhound filed 
Monday for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

moderate members of OPEC, said it was possible the cartel might hold an 
emergency meeting because of plunging oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
" I don't rule out the possibility of such a meeting, but I am not proposing 
it" said Ginanjar Kartasamita, mines and energy minister. " I am not a 
supporter, but I won't be the one to prevent it." Oil prices have tumbled 
because several members of the Organiztion of Petroleum Exporting Countries 
have been slow to implement cuts pledged early last month.

Rockwell Reorganizes Unit: Rockwell International Corp. said it has reorganized 
its defense electronics operation again in a move aimed at further streamlining 
the business and boosting weapons sales in the U.S. and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The move marks the third time since July that Rockwell has announced a 
reshuffling of its Anaheim-based Defense Electronics unit, which is headed by 
John A. McLuckey, group president. The changes will not result in any layoffs 
or relocations. The new organization allows the defense electronics group to 
more efficiently handle several major contract programs the company has won in 
the past several years.

EC Farm Ministers to Lift Beef Bans: European Community agriculture ministers 
reached agreement on tighter measures to curb "mad cow" disease and France, 
West Germany and Italy agreed to lift their bans on British beef imports. After 
an all-night emergency meeting, British minister John Gummer told reporters the 
bans, imposed because of concern that the cattle brain disease affects human 
health, would be lifted. Diplomats said the agreement, in classic Community 
style, would allow all sides to claim victory.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: SURPRISING NEWS ABOUT JUNK BONDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Investors who've held on to their junk bond mutual funds this year, despite the 
bonds' winter crash, can proudly say that they didn't sell at the lows: Junk 
bond values have climbed back surprisingly over the past month. 
</P>
<P>
The average junk bond fund had a total return of 2.10% in May, according to 
Lipper Analytical Services. Total return measures interest earned, plus any 
appreciation in the bonds' prices. 
</P>
<P>
The May gain helped erase much of the damage from the winter plunge, after junk 
bond king Drexel Burnham Lambert collapsed. Year-to-date through May 31, the 
average junk fund now is off 2.01%, measuring total return. 
</P>
<P>
That may not feel very good when the average stock mutual fund is up 3.3%, and 
the average Treasury bond fund is up 0.13%. Still, things looked a lot worse in 
early March, when many junk funds were down 7% or more from Jan. 1. And if bond 
prices just stay level, interest earnings could soon put junk funds back in the 
positive column. 
</P>
<P>
What happened in May was that more bargain hunters got serious about buying 
junk. Convinced that the economy wasn't going to collapse, and lured by junk 
bond annualized yields exceeding 15%, buyers chased junk as market interest 
rates fell. It also helped that many of the companies that had borrowed via 
junk bonds in recent years decided to buy some of them back, given the 
depressed prices. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the strength of the May rally, however, many junk experts are wary 
about calling this a sustainable surge. The reason: Buyers fishing for 
depressed bonds have mostly concentrated on the biggest, safest junk issuers 
only. Trading in most corporate junk bonds remains treacherous at best. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 50 or 60 names that everybody's jumped on," said James Caywood, head 
of San Diego-based Caywood Christian Capital, which owns about $1.2 billion in 
junk. "But there are another 600 names that nobody has a clue about." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Nugent, who runs the $12-million (assets) Pacific Horizon High Yield fund 
in Los Angeles, has been a victim of that two-tiered market. His fund, heavily 
invested in higher-yielding, lower-quality issues, eked out only a small gain 
in May. It was hurt in part by a plunge in the value of bonds issued by Divi 
Hotels Corp., which operates Caribbean hotels. When Divi said it was unable to 
make its interest payments, the bonds tumbled to about $250 apiece from about 
$550. 
</P>
<P>
Besides worrying about a continuing dearth of buyers for most bonds, junk fund 
managers warn that if fears again mount that the economy is crumbling, many 
junk owners are likely to bail out. Most investors won't want to stick around 
and see how many more financially weak junk debtors will end up in bankruptcy 
court. 
</P>
<P>
"The market remains very vulnerable to a full-scale recession," said Bill 
Veronda, manager of the $46-million asset Financial Group High Yield fund in 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Veronda and his peers admit that they were surprised by the sum of 
money that flowed back into junk in May. "We literally saw some of the same 
people coming back who had sold out in a panic" last winter, Veronda said. His 
fund saw a small net inflow of money from investors in May, after a long string 
of monthly losses. 
</P>
<P>
He also is encouraged by investors' reaction to the troubles of issuers such as 
Donald J. Trump and Macy's. Though those bonds have plunged recently, "Their 
troubles haven't carried over to the general market," Veronda said. 
</P>
<P>
How Wells Fargo Picks Stocks: Among L.A.'s money pros, one of the quiet giants 
is Wells Fargo Asset Management, which actively manages about $30 billion in 
investor funds. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco-based Wells Fargo probably is best known for its "passive" stock 
management division, which essentially attempts to replicate market performance 
by exclusively owning the stocks in major market indexes, such as the Standard 
&amp; Poor's 500 index. 
</P>
<P>
While that Wells division now runs about $70 billion for investors, the active 
management arm has been gaining notoriety for its stock-picking prowess. Over 
the past five years, Wells' model growth stock fund has beaten the average 
stock mutual fund by about 2 percentage points a year. 
</P>
<P>
Wells veteran Robert Bissell was named to oversee all of the firm's portfolio 
operations in 1989. Bissell, based in L.A., describes Wells' active management 
strategy as aggressive on individual stocks but growing cautious overall on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"Our thinking is, you may not want to throw a lot of money in at the 2,900 
level (on the Dow Jones average)," Bissell said. "The market could go forward . 
. . but you're into territory where it becomes a lot more volatile," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for individual stocks, Bissell said Wells' style is "different than just 
trying to pick this quarter's winner." In searching for stocks that have the 
potential for big gains, Wells' goal is to be into the story early, he said. 
The firm's 30 portfolio managers are rewarded for spotting ideas before the 
rest of Wall Street spots them. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Wells emphasizes that its portfolio managers have to be good at doing 
their own homework on stocks. The firm employed analysts to assist the 
portfolio managers until 1986, then jettisoned the analysts. Bissell said his 
experience is that analysts tend to "filter out information, rather than 
develop new ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Operating independently, Wells' portfolio managers can tap ideas from a wide 
range of sources, including analysts employed by Wall Street brokerages. Wells 
has a reputation for demanding a lot of those analysts. "We manage Wall Street 
a lot harder," Bissell admitted. "We make them jump through little hoops" for 
Wells' business, he said. The reason simply is that "really good stock ideas 
are hard to come by," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Along the same lines, Wells doesn't spread its dollars over a wide universe of 
stocks, despite running $30 billion. "We tend to focus in on about 300 
companies," Bissell said. "If we're going to take a position in a stock, we'll 
make it meaningful." 
</P>
<P>
The firm's best ideas show up on a 20-stock focus list. Some of the stocks on 
that list now include Bank of New York ($37.625 Thursday), North Carolina 
banking giant NCNB ($41), heavy equipment makers Harnischfeger ($20.25) and 
Caterpillar ($67.125), computer maker Tandem ($25) and insurance firm Aon Corp. 
($40.625). 
</P>
<P>
Technology stocks are "notably absent" from the stock list now, Bissell said, 
because Wells' portfolio managers no longer see much value in the group, which 
has soared this year. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly: The Greenwich Associates poll of 1,500 money managers once again named 
Goldman, Sachs the best brokerage for stock research, Investment Dealers' 
Digest reports. The Greenwich poll isn't released publicly but usually is 
leaked. Merrill Lynch came in second, and First Boston was third. . . . 
Allergan, the Irvine-based eye-care products firm, has picked up another 
recommendation. Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards recently initiated coverage with 
a "buy" recommendation. Allergan closed at $18 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
THE RETURN OF JUNK 
</P>
<P>
Junk bond mutual funds rallied sharply in May, as bargain-hunters chased after 
selected depressed bonds, bidding the prices up significantly. But most funds 
still are down for the year. A cross section:

PIC 'N' SAVE TRUCE BUYS TIME TO ARRANGE SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pic 'N' Save and Girard Partners, an investment group pursuing the company, 
reached a truce Thursday calling for the two sides to stop bombarding 
shareholders with pleas for support. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides noted that the pact would give Pic 'N' Save until at least July 15 
to arrange a buyout without the distraction of an active fight for control of 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
The truce came as Pic 'N' Save disclosed that it has received "expressions of 
interest" in the company from prospective "financial bidders." A spokesman 
declined to elaborate, other than to say company officials hope one of the 
financial bidders or another party would submit a proposal providing a fair 
value to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Girard, which disclosed in April that it owns 6.7% of Pic 'N' Save's stock, has 
sought to gain control of the retailer's board through a proxy fight or by 
direct consent from shareholders. The investment group has said it wants to buy 
Pic 'N' Save itself or sell it to the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
David H. Batchelder, the La Jolla financier who heads Girard, said he agreed to 
the truce because of two moves by Pic 'N' Save. He said Pic 'N' Save agreed to 
open its books to Girard without, as it proposed earlier, barring the 
investment group from buying additional company stock for a long period. 
</P>
<P>
Batchelder noted that the retailer also authorized management to participate in 
a possible buyout. He said that Pic 'N' Save previously disclosed that it would 
consider a sale to an outside bidder, but until Thursday it had not signaled 
its willingness to pursue a management buyout as well. 
</P>
<P>
Batchelder said he now is "hopeful" that a deal for the company will be reached 
by July 15. He said, however, he did not know anything about other possible 
bidders. 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from Girard, Pic 'N' Save put itself up for sale last month. All 
along, however, the company has expressed doubt that a financial company could 
raise enough money for an acquisition as a result of the collapse of the junk 
bond market and weakness in the retailing industry. 
</P>
<P>
Besides putting on hold the proxy fight between Pic 'N' Save and Girard until 
at least July 15, the truce postpones the retailer's annual meeting from July 2 
to Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Pic 'N' Save, based in Dominguez, owns 189 stores in the West, South and New 
York City area specializing in close-out and other discount merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
The announcements came after the close of stock trading. Pic 'N' Save shares, 
traded over the counter, closed at $12.375, down 12.5 cents.

USX BEATS RESTRUCTURING BY LESS THAN ANTICIPATED

<TEXT>
<P>
USX Corp. stockholders rejected a proposal by financier Carl C. Icahn to split 
the company's steel and oil businesses, but the margin of victory in the 
figures released Thursday showed that management had less than resounding 
support. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh-based USX released the preliminary results of the May 7 annual 
meeting, where Icahn tried to win support for his measure to restructure the 
corporate giant. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn managed to win a surprising 42.9% of the non-binding vote for his 
dissident action to restructure the company, while management, opposing the 
proposal, won 57.1%. Of the total shares outstanding, 14% were not voted. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the margin of victory increased pressure on USX to consider a 
restructuring. Icahn, who owns 13.3% of USX, indicated that he was far from 
throwing in the towel in the fight to alter the oil and steel giant. 
</P>

"There was enough of a message sent that they have to keep their ears open for 
what shareholders are saying," said analyst Jeffrey Miller of Duff &amp; 
Phelps. "They can't gloat too much."

"The shortfall from a clear-cut victory really came down to a handful of 
institutions, several of whom expressed to me that they agreed with what we 
were trying to accomplish," Icahn said in a statement.

<P>
Icahn, speaking later by telephone, said he had received several offers to sell 
his stake in the company but had brushed them off. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not plan to sell our stock," he said. "We've had several bids for the 
stock in the last few weeks, but have turned them all down."

NASA KILLS $700-MILLION TRW 'SPACE TUG' PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has canceled a $700-million 
TRW program to build an "orbital maneuvering vehicle," often referred to as the 
space tug. 
</P>
<P>
TRW spokeswoman Julie Meier Wright said the program, which commenced in the 
early 1980s, has provided 280 jobs at its Redondo Beach Space &amp; Defense 
Sector. 
</P>
<P>
She said workers will be reassigned to other programs at the facility, which 
employs 17,900. 
</P>
<P>
NASA cited "budgetary pressures" over the next several years and the lack of a 
"firm near-term requirement" for the spacecraft as the basis for the 
cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
TRW's portion of the program was worth $490 million. The cost has grown 
significantly in recent years, owing to stretchouts in the program schedule, 
Wright said. The original estimated cost of TRW's work was about $275 million. 
</P>
<P>
William B. Lenoir, NASA's associate administrator for space flight, was quoted 
in an agency announcement saying that another space tug "eventually will be 
needed in our space infrastructure, but we will have at least two or three 
years to develop firm requirements before it will be necessary to begin 
development." 
</P>
<P>
The tug was to have been a reusable, remotely controlled spacecraft that would 
perform a range of satellite service missions and satellite retrieval missions, 
including the job of periodically reboosting the Hubble Space Telescope. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, NASA will use the space shuttle, which launched the telescope, to 
reboost it periodically. But Lenoir said such missions "will overburden the 
efficient use of shuttle capabilities in the late 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
Exactly why NASA would cancel the program if it needs the tug was left unclear. 
In addition, the NASA budget has been sharply increasing in recent years, so it 
was not clear exactly what budgetary constraints NASA was considering.

JAZZ SO GOOD THAT IT SHOULD BE ON RECORDS

<P>
Someone get this group on tape, please. Saxophonist David Newman's five-night 
engagement at Elario's, including a rare appearance by local pianist Cecil 
Lytle, is producing better music than Newman's last album, a live date at the 
Village Vanguard in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
The choice of Lytle, music professor and provost of Third College at UC San 
Diego, to complete a quartet including Jim Plank on drums and Bob Magnusson on 
bass, was an inspired move by Rob Hagey, Elario's talent coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Though Lytle knows Haydn as well as he does Monk and Coltrane, he also founded 
the university's revered gospel choir, so his soulful roots go way back. The 
pairing with Newman, a Charlie Parker disciple who took several detours into 
blues and R&amp;B, most notably with Ray Charles, results in some swinging 
chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
Newman plays several horns, but, because airlines make it difficult to bring 
the full array, he is only using tenor sax and flute. Thank the airlines: 
Listeners are gaining a rare opportunity for some extended exposure to Newman's 
fine flute work. 
</P>
<P>
The first set on opening night Wednesday began with the standard "Sweet 
Lorraine," on which Lytle's tastefully restrained playing helped the rhythm 
section find a simmering groove. Newman and Lytle both contributed solos, but 
the juices weren't yet flowing. 
</P>
<P>
Newman switched from sax to flute for "Delilah," an exotic number with a 
Brazilian beat that provided the perfect backdrop for his sensuous, tropical 
flute work. He has a special rapport with the instrument, standing with eyes 
closed to produce a stream of melodic ideas, shaped by subtle vibrato and 
bird-like trills. 
</P>
<P>
Fats Waller's "Ain't Misbehavin' " came next, and Dallas-born Newman showed why 
he's considered one of a handful of classic Texas sax men. His tone isn't as 
full as some, but it is buttery smooth, and he controls the pacing and dynamic 
range to attain the maximum emotional impact. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks really began to fly on Cedar Walton's "The Holy Land," as Newman 
loosened up and attacked his solos with more authority. This bluesy tune was 
the perfect setting for Newman's subtle improvisations, built around the 
tenor's mellow middle range. 
</P>
<P>
Lytle was especially strong here, making mini-meditations of repeated 
right-hand patterns, with plenty of space in between to set them off. At times, 
his playing has the laid-back swing and melodic inventiveness of vintage Herbie 
Hancock. 
</P>
<P>
For "Sunflower," Newman switched to flute again, turning out a breathtaking, 
extended solo, reminding you how rare it is to hear someone with a genuine 
mastery of this difficult instrument. He was back on sax to close the set with 
"Hard Times," the signature song from his 1959 debut album. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman and Company will appear nightly at Elario's through Sunday, with three 
shows tonight and Saturday night (9, 10:30 and midnight) and two on Sunday 
night (8:30 and 10:30).

TARTIKOFF SAYS FOX PANDERS TO 'WORST ASPECTS'; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE NBC ENTERTAINMENT PRESIDENT CALLS ONE OF THE UPSTART NETWORK'S 
NEW SHOWS 'INSULTING TO WOMEN.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
While applauding Fox Broadcasting for its growth as the fourth commercial TV 
network, NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff accuses his rival of 
pandering to the public's worst aspects. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a substantial achievement, but how have they done it?" Tartikoff asked in 
an interview at the end of NBC's annual convention of affiliated stations here. 
"Ironically, outside of 'The Simpsons,' there isn't a whole lot now on Fox that 
I'd like to have on my schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"They pander to the worst aspects of the American TV audience. They assume 
people don't read -- every reference is to other TV shows. They don't ask the 
audience to aspire to anything. They don't try to assume that the audience has 
a collective 90 IQ." 
</P>
<P>
He said that he enjoyed "The Simpsons," which Fox has scheduled against NBC's 
"The Cosby Show" in the fall. But he added that he had seen "Babes," Fox's 
upcoming comedy series about three overweight sisters, and found it "insulting 
to women." 
</P>
<P>
In response, Fox Broadcasting spokesman Brad Turell said Thursday: "Brandon 
Tartikoff was the first person to predict that Fox would fail miserably. We 
hope his current thoughts prove equally correct." 
</P>
<P>
The NBC programming chief made his comments about Fox during a discussion of 
NBC's new fall schedule, which he said he hoped would return his top-rated 
network to the time when it first ascended to Nielsen preeminence five years 
ago with critically praised shows such as "Hill Street Blues" and "Cheers." 
</P>
<P>
"We strayed a bit recently, putting on some shows like 'Hardball' and 
'Baywatch' that none of us as programmers would probably rush home and see," he 
said. "When a show dies in the ratings, it's a very hollow feeling to say, 'It 
tested well,' or 'I ran it as a movie and it got a 30 share.' " 
</P>
<P>
Citing "Fresh Prince of Bel Air," "American Dreamer," "Law and Order" and the 
medical series "Signs of Life" as innovative shows in the NBC fall schedule, 
Tartikoff said, "We tried to go for breakout shows. We were offered a lot of 
takeoffs of 'America's Funniest Home Videos,' along with seven or eight scripts 
that would out-gross-out (Fox's) 'Married . . . With Children.' But I think 
what's important is to play our own game." 
</P>
<P>
As "The Simpsons," Fox's animated underachievers, prepare to go head-to-head 
with NBC's Huxtables this fall, "The Cosby Show" is making some changes, 
Tartikoff said. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a new character added to the Huxtable household," he related. 
"She will be a kid from the ghetto, about 16 or 17 years old, who will be the 
goddaughter" to Bill Cosby's character. As yet uncast, she "will set up 
chain-reactions and permutations" in the Huxtable household, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cosby Show" also has a new team of writers and a new producer, Bernie 
Kukoff. 
</P>
<P>
These changes, Tartikoff said, were made to bring new energy to the series, 
which was No. 2 in the Nielsens this year but is entering its seventh season, 
and were initiated before the announcement of any of the networks' fall 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill has always wanted to have a sense that the audience is still very 
positive about the show and that the show not become a lesser imitation of what 
it has been," Tartikoff explained. "The changes have turned out to be 
fortuitous. At some point in the life of a show, you do expect that one of the 
other networks will try to take it on with direct programming as opposed to 
counter-programming. We're much better equipped to do battle with 'Simpsons' 
with 'Cosby' than somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NBC said that at a closed-door session with the affiliates 
Wednesday, Tartikoff announced that the network does not plan to rerun the 
controversial "Saturday Night Live" episode hosted by Andrew Dice Clay. His 
announcement came after what several affiliates at the meeting described as 
sharp criticism of the Clay show by Cliff Brown, a broadcaster in Hattiesburg, 
Miss. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too bad that show tarnished what was an otherwise good year" for the 
late-night comedy program, an NBC spokesman quoted Tartikoff as saying.

BELLA LEWITZKY MAY REJECT NEA GRANT OF $72,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The famed Bella Lewitzky Dance Company in Los Angeles is considering rejection 
of a $72,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts in what would be 
the most serious episode yet in a continuing artist protest over anti-obscenity 
provisions in the endowment's 1990 grant guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility that Lewitzky, the internationally acclaimed 74-year-old 
choreographer who has received NEA funding regularly since 1972, might turn 
down a major grant this year was confirmed to The Times on Thursday by sources 
close to her company. 
</P>
<P>
These sources noted that turning down NEA operating support would strike a 
serious blow against the Lewitzky company's financial stability. The company 
has an estimated 1990 budget of about $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
It was uncertain when Lewitzky would disclose her final decision, but sources 
familiar with the situation said she had been meeting with close advisers for 
several days and had undertaken an extensive period of personal reflection on 
the issue. These sources indicated an announcement could come within the next 
week to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
These sources indicated that Lewitzky, who has long been identified with 
political activist causes, was deeply troubled by what she reportedly perceives 
as insurmountable obstacles to artistic freedom implicit in the NEA funding 
requirements -- despite the fact that her company has never been identified 
with presentation of sexually explicit work. 
</P>
<P>
But sources familiar with deliberations by Lewitzky and her associates in the 
Bella Lewitzky Dance Company and the Dance Gallery, described the choreographer 
as deeply troubled by provisions in the NEA funding law that ban support of 
work that is judged obscene by the NEA and does not meet high standards of 
artistic merit. 
</P>
<P>
Lewitzky is one of the most established artists supported by the NEA. Since 
1972, she and her companies have received nearly $1,446,000 in NEA funds, 
according to the arts endowment. The company received $72,000 last year and 
$68,000 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Dance Gallery, a proposed $20 million downtown performance space that has 
proved difficult to bring to fruition, has received $650,000 in NEA money in a 
program that requires private funds to be raised at a 3-to-1 ratio. Lewitzky is 
the founder and artistic director of the Dance Gallery, but its grants would be 
unaffected by any decision by Lewitzky to turn down NEA operating support in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-obscenity requirement was imposed by Congress last year in the midst 
of a continuing political battle over the arts endowment's support of 
controversial artworks and performances. In recent weeks, several NEA grantees 
have announced they would reject money this year. 
</P>
<P>
The largest rejection thus far has been by New York City theater producer 
Joseph Papp, who turned down $50,000 in NEA funding several weeks ago. Papp 
said that although his productions are unlikely to be judged obscene, an NEA 
requirement that grantees certify in writing that they will not produce obscene 
work is antithetical to maintaining artistic freedom. The producer argued that 
the judgment of what is obscene could be influenced by political 
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
Papp also said he would reject another $400,000 in anticipated NEA support 
later this year if the arts endowment does not rescind its anti-obscenity 
requirement. After Papp rejected the first $50,000, Los Angeles television 
producer Mark Goodson made a donation in that amount to Papp's New York City 
Shakespeare festival. 
</P>
<P>
But sources familiar with the situation noted that a decision by Lewitzky to 
turn down her entire NEA grant this year would have a far greater proportional 
effect on her company than Papp's decision. These sources noted that Lewitzky's 
grant, under the endowment's program of operating support for nationally 
significant dance companies, is devoted to development of new work, rehearsal 
and dancer salaries.

SEQUEL: 'ANOTHER 48 HRS.,' A CRUDE REHASHING OF THE 1982 HIT, RETEAMS EDDIE 
MURPHY AND NICK NOLTE IN WALL-TO-WALL MAYHEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Eddie Murphy may have been a novice movie actor when he made "48 HRS." eight 
years ago, but he had a crackerjack presence that cut like an acetylene torch 
through the film's engineered tumult. In the sequel, "Another 48 HRS.," Murphy 
still has his crack timing and a comic assuredness that almost passes for 
dramatic authority. 
</P>
<P>
In the intervening eight years, Murphy has become a great big movie star, and 
his career, except in a commercial sense, hasn't improved on his work in that 
first film. He's become a commodity, and, despite his professionalism in 
"Another 48 HRS." (citywide), there's a take-it-or-leave-it quality to his edgy 
nonchalance. He knows he doesn't really need this movie -- certainly not the 
way he did when he was just starting out in the business. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Nolte needs this film even less than Murphy. Since "48 HRS.," he's become 
a great actor. The buddy-buddy shoving matches and bleary mock-racist face-offs 
in this film diminish his presence; even more so than in the first film, they 
reduce Nolte's power to a series of hulky poses. And since Murphy is no more 
generous with Nolte now than he was eight years ago -- he still acts as if 
there's no one else on screen remotely as important as himself -- Nolte seems 
once again at a loss. In his tirades with Murphy, he might as well be burbling 
to himself. 
</P>
<P>
The plot to this sequel is a crude rehashing of the high points of the first 
film. Jack (Nolte) has been suspended from the San Francisco police force for 
his overenthusiastic pursuit of an elusive Bay Area drug lord, the Iceman. 
Unless he can collar his prey in 48 hours, he'll go to prison. 
</P>
<P>
When Jack discovers that the Iceman has put out a contract on Reggie (Murphy), 
who is about to be released from prison after seven years, he tries to enlist 
his old nemesis-ally into helping him out. Reggie, you see, is the Iceman's 
only eyewitness. (Question: How come Jack never asks Reggie to provide a visual 
description of the Iceman?) Predictably, it takes about half of the movie for 
Reggie to warm to the idea of reteaming with Jack. The partnership is 
inevitable, though. There wouldn't be a movie otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
There isn't one anyway. Walter Hill, who also directed the first film, surely 
recognizes the hollowness of what he's doing here. He also hasn't had a hit 
since "48 HRS.," which no doubt explains why he's once again tilling these 
charred fields. He tries to ram through the muddled exposition as quickly as 
possible; essentially, the film is wall-to-wall mayhem, with more shots of 
hurled bodies shattering windows than I've ever seen in a movie. (The 
breakaway-glass concession for this film should have received top billing.) The 
scenes that are halfway effective, like the one in which Reggie breaks up a 
barroom melee, or a shoot-out in Chinatown, get most of their oomph from their 
association with similar scenes in "48 HRS.", where they were executed a lot 
better, if no less cynically. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, there are grace notes. Murphy is loose and funny in a sequence 
where he's trying to cadge friends for money from a pay phone, and he has a 
rascally winsomeness that's almost Chaplinesque when he's being bullied by the 
behemoth inmate (Bernie Casey) to whom he's in hock. There's an explosive comic 
moment when the psycho bikers in pursuit of Jack and Reggie burst through the 
screen of a porno movie house; it's as if they were being expelled, 
"Alien"-style, from the chest of the naked actress on screen. 
</P>
<P>
But these graces notes are all but lost in the din. "Another 48 HRS." (rated R) 
is a demonstration of how far-gone an action film can get when it's only 
propulsion is mayhem. Scene after scene exists only to up the blood flow; in 
the movie's climactic shoot-out, the filmmakers actually attempt to extract a 
laugh from a point-blank direct hit to one of the lead characters. I guess it's 
OK to laugh -- after all, it's not a mortal wound.

<P>
If you're crazy about 1990 dance crazes, this week's two leading video releases 
may be just your style. Otherwise, there's nothing much to kick up your heels 
about except for one semi-golden oldie. You know it's a slow week when the 
biggest items are a New Kids on the Block tape and a movie called "Lambada." 
</P>
<P>
One of two recent low-budget films to wrap their thin plots around the lambada 
dance craze (the other, "The Forbidden Dance," comes out Wednesday), "Lambada" 
(Cannon, $89.95, PG) was the more popular -- though it grossed only about $4 
million. The hero is a teacher by day and a dancer by night. The cast features 
J. Eddie Peck, Melora Hardin and Shabba-Doo. 
</P>
<P>
If that doesn't make you want to run right out of the house and head for the 
video store, the rest of this weekend's choices probably won't either. 
"American Eagle" (Vidmark, $89.95, R) stars Asher Brauner and Robert F. Lyons 
in a violent tale about a revengeful soldier. "Max and Helen" (Turner, $79.98, 
no MPAA rating), the film version of a book by Simon Wiesenthal about a couple 
who are reunited 20 years after World War II, was a cable TV production 
starring Treat Williams, Alice Krige and Martin Landau. 
</P>
<P>
This week's only oldie, from 1978, looks good in contrast. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cheap Detective" (RCA/Columbia, $19.95) is a lot of fun if you don't 
expect too much. It might be hard not to expect too much after being told that 
the writer is Neil Simon and the cast includes Peter Falk, Eileen Brennan, 
James Coco, Madeline Kahn, Louise Fletcher and Stockard Channing, but this 
broad parody of "The Maltese Falcon" and similar films delivers as many bad 
jokes as good ones. Still, check it out -- especially if you enjoyed Simon's 
earlier (slightly better) detective-film spoof, "Murder By Death," which also 
featured Falk and a star-heavy lineup. 
</P>
<P>
COMING ATTRACTIONS: "Valmont" (July 26), "Born on the Fourth of July" (Aug. 9), 
"Madhouse" (Aug. 30). 
</P>
<P>
OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
"New Kids on the Block: Step By Step" (CMV, $19.98) is the video version of the 
simultaneously released new album by a group of teen heartthrobs who dance 
better than they sing. That's a plus for this 40-minute tape, but it still 
won't be of much interest to many people over 16. TERRY ATKINSON

HOWARD ROSENBERG: A&amp;E NARROWS THE CULTURE GAP, CNN TURNS A HEAVYWEIGHT 10

<P>
Cable's Arts &amp; Entertainment network, in little more than six years of 
operation, has managed to become a sort of junior public TV -- with 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
To say that A&amp;E is presently a bona-fide alternative to PBS -- even taking 
the public-TV system's flaws into account -- would be going too far. For one 
thing, the frequency and seemingly arbitrary insertion of A&amp;E commercials 
is just exasperating. A recent showing of that fine John Sayles film "Matewan," 
for example, found A&amp;E bringing down a commercial break on a climactic 
final sequence like a guillotine. A network that purports to exalt art should 
respect its integrity. 
</P>
<P>
In other ways, however, the gap separating PBS and A&amp;E may be narrowing. 
</P>
<P>
Although still short on first-run fare, A&amp;E offers many of the same types 
of programs -- let's stop mincing words and call them "highbrow" -- available 
on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
And some that are not found on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
Most dramatically, that includes the cable network's own month-old "Arts &amp; 
Entertainment Revue," a weekly hour (airing at 5 and 9 p.m. Fridays, 3 p.m. 
Saturdays and 8 a.m. Sundays) that nourishes your mind with a cultural menu not 
unlike the old "Omnibus" series that ran on CBS and ABC in the mid-1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"Arts &amp; Entertainment Revue" is a show that PBS should have done. 
</P>
<P>
Produced by Susan Lester and Av Westin and hosted by the gifted Eric Burns (who 
previously co-hosted "By the Year 2000" on KCET), this is a very 
good-getting-to-be-grand program that has no twin or even a close cousin 
elsewhere on TV. To call it "Entertainment Tonight" with a brain is either to 
overvalue the syndicated "Entertainment Tonight" or to undervalue "Arts &amp; 
Entertainment Revue." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, there is no similarity beyond the title. Here is a show that 
leisurely explores and celebrates creativity, in part by turning creators 
themselves into informal correspondents, as in last week's rich profile of 
Mandy Patinkin. The reporter was author/singer/deejay Jonathan Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
"Arts &amp; Entertainment Revue" has been a Rolodex of delights, whether a bit 
of a play or Morley Safer reading portions of his book, "Flashbacks: On 
Returning to Vietnam," or comments by Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca juxtaposed 
with their brilliant sketches from "Your Show of Shows." There's genius here, 
and wit and vibrancy. 
</P>
<P>
Just as "Nightline" and Ted Koppel were made for each other, so, in a 
lower-case way, are "Arts &amp; Entertainment Revue" and Burns, whose ability 
to make unforced, intelligent conversation with guests sets the tone for this 
show. More than anything, however, it's the performance aspect that defines 
"Arts &amp; Entertainment Revue." 
</P>
<P>
Not everything works. If some authors wrote as poorly as they read their own 
writing on this program, for example, they wouldn't even be published. 
</P>
<P>
Yet this is a very special hour and a sweet way to cap a week. A quote from 
that singing, dancing little person on ABC's "Twin Peaks" applies here: 
"There's music in the air." 
</P>
<P>
CNN has just celebrated its 10th birthday, noting one of the most incredible 
success stories in the history of television. The visionary Ted Turner's 
almost-all-news cable network is TV's Rocky, an underdog, 90-pound weakling 
grown into a brawny, thick-necked heavyweight with 16-inch biceps. 
</P>
<P>
Measuring today's CNN against the infant CNN -- the one that ABC, CBS and NBC 
regularly ridiculed before later growing to respect and fear it -- is just, 
well, boggling. It's something to keep in mind before making snap negative 
judgments about weird-looking toddlers like the three-hour news block that KCAL 
Channel 9 initiated three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
CNN has become not only one of this nation's institutions but also one of the 
world's. The one thing that you can count on while traveling abroad is CNN, 
whose straight news programs are beamed to 90 nations. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder that Bobbie Battista may have closed in on the globally syndicated 
Lucille Ball as the world's most recognizable face during her recently ended 
seven-year stint as "Headline News" anchor. Although relatively unknown in the 
United States, Battista -- who now co-anchors CNN's "World Day" and "Newshour" 
programs -- got famous internationally by being on the air at peak viewing 
times in other nations where TV diets are sparse. 
</P>
<P>
According to CNN executive vice president Ed Turner, a CNN executive was in a 
cab in Berlin recently when the driver noticed the network logo on his tote 
bag. "Oh, CNN," the cabbie said. "I learned to speak English listening to 
Bobbie Battista." 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, CNN has become indispensable both as a network of record 
for such epic events as the Bush-Gorbachev summit and as the network that 
reacts speediest to breaking news. What's more, CNN sometimes covers things 
that may not rank high on a news scale but are interesting slices of life that 
make up the American pie. 
</P>
<P>
As an industry, cable has a spotty record in providing diversity. Without a 
doubt, however, CNN has become the 911 number for finding out what's happening 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a network that can make you mad, having been known to overcover 
events merely because it is a news network. And raw, unedited footage still 
finds its way onto CNN during some breaking stories for no other apparent 
reason than it's available -- a dangerous practice. Moreover, not all CNN stars 
are on camera because of their news pedigrees: Witness the controversial hiring 
of Texas judge Catherine Crier -- a news neophyte -- as "The World Today" 
co-anchor with veteran Bernard Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
TV being TV, it was inevitable that CNN would nurture its own news celebrities. 
Unlike its older counterparts, however, this is not a network where news 
anchors and reporters are the stars. As Hank Whittemore, author of a 
just-published biography on CNN, notes, on this network "the news is the star."

SENATE PANEL OKS BILL TO RE-REGULATE CABLE TV FEES 
</P>

<P>
The Senate Commerce Committee passed a bill Thursday to re-regulate cable 
television rates in an important step toward giving consumers federal 
protection from skyrocketing fees. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation sent to the Senate floor on a vote of 18 to 1, would return to 
the Federal Communications Commission the authority to regulate rates for cable 
television services. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to put the FCC back watching these things. I think cable is going 
to be disciplining itself," said Sen. Ernest Hollings, (D-S.C.), the 
committee's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Since the cable television industry was deregulated in 1984, consumers have 
complained of higher cable prices and declining service. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Al Gore (D-Tenn.) said the cable industry has been in a state of chaos 
since deregulation and has turned into "a monopoly that's out of control." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed legislation "assures the consumers that from now on, cable 
companies are not going to have a totally free reign," Sen. John Danforth 
(R-Mo.) said. 
</P>
<P>
Danforth said cable rates have increased 40% for about one-quarter of cable 
subscribers since deregulation and have gone up by 29% since January, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In the years since cable was introduced in 1948 to improve television reception 
in remote areas, the industry has grown into a $13- billion business. More than 
half the nation's homes have cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
James Mooney, president of the National Cable Television Assn., said the 
proposed legislation is "much more modest and scaled back" than the cable 
industry had expected. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the industry objects to many of the bill's provisions and a battle is 
expected over restrictions on the exclusive distribution of programming. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation did not address efforts by telephone companies to enter the 
cable business. An amendment allowing phone companies to carry video signals 
through fiber optic lines was withdrawn minutes before the final vote. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.), the amendment's author, struck a deal with the 
committee to pull his amendment and resubmit it as a bill after he was promised 
it would get a full hearing next month. 
</P>
<P>
Several committee members said the amendment would kill the chances of the 
cable bill's passage by the full Senate.

PRESS VOWS RETURN TO BROADCASTING AFTER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Former KABC-TV commentator and KABC-AM radio talk-show host Bill Press says he 
will wait until the end of July at the earliest before returning to 
broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
"My first priority is to spend some time with my family, pay some bills, then 
go back to earning a living," said Press, defeated in his bid for the 
Democratic nomination for insurance commissioner in Tuesday's primary election. 
"I don't know where or how. I was not born for the corporate world or 
consulting work. I was born to talk about issues and hope to do that again in 
some form." 
</P>
<P>
Press, who finished second to State Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove), said 
that his campaign owes between $50,000 and $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although Press declined to say he would specifically be returning to KABC-TV 
and KABC radio, there is precedent. Fellow commentator Bruce Herschensohn 
returned to both stations after his failed 1986 campaign for the Republican 
U.S. Senate nomination. Press had left both stations in 1987 to seek the 1988 
Democratic nomination for U.S. Senator, withdrew before the primary and 
rejoined both in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The bid for insurance commissioner was the first time that Press' name had 
appeared on a ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"The one great shock was (that) not until I ran did I realize how dependent in 
today's politics candidates are on raising money," Press said. "I just deplore 
the fact that we have to spend so much time raising money. The system is sick. 
I come away from this experience more dedicated than ever to cleaning up this 
political system and getting some serious limits on campaign spending and 
campaign expenditures." 
</P>
<P>
He believes his experiences as a candidate will be helpful when he resumes his 
broadcasting career. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us in journalism tend to get a little detached, by hiding behind our 
cameras and computers," Press said. "It's good to get out there in the real 
world and real people. I think I will come back to communicating ideas with a 
much greater depth of understanding about people and what their problems, needs 
and hopes are." 
</P>
<P>
Press is not ruling out another run for office, but added that another campaign 
was not in his current plans either. Press pledged to "do whatever I can" to 
aid Garamendi in his general election bid against Republican insurance agent 
Wes Bannister of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Press was critical of media coverage, especially by television, of the 
insurance commissioner's race. Only fund-raising or negative television 
commercials attracted media interest, he charged. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time Walter Zelman (the former Common Cause executive director who 
finished fourth in the Democratic primary) or I tried to talk about substantive 
issues, like earthquake insurance or fraud, no one would show up," Press said. 
"It was impossible to get attention to this race. This campaign was not the 
media's finest hour."

CIVIL RIGHTS CHARGE FILED IN SHOOTING OF BLACK WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A criminal civil rights charge was filed here Thursday against a Hesperia man 
who allegedly wounded an elderly black woman in the stomach when he fired a 
high-powered rifle twice into her family's home. 
</P>
<P>
Gary D. McInnis, 39, was charged in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana with a 
single felony count of using intimidation to interfere with housing rights on 
account of race. The crime carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and 
a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a full beard, his long, brown hair in a ponytail, McInnis appeared 
briefly in court before Magistrate Ronald R. Rose, who ordered him held without 
bail after concluding he was an escape risk and a danger to others. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the worst allegations of racial animus I have seen," said H. 
Dean Steward, a federal public defender assigned to represent McInnis. "This is 
the first case of its type for our office in Santa Ana and certainly the first 
one for us involving a gunshot." 
</P>
<P>
McInnis is accused of shooting his neighbor, Oleatha Keller, on Jan. 26 at her 
Hesperia home in San Bernardino County. The criminal complaint alleges that 
McInnis, who was either drunk or high on drugs at the time, opened fire on 
Keller's house because she is black. 
</P>
<P>
Court records state that when San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies arrived 
in the neighborhood after the shooting, McInnis yelled racial epithets and 
said: "Hey, come and get me." 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor told authorities that the day after the shooting, McInnis' 
16-year-old son visited him and told him details about the shooting, according 
to the complaint. "My dad took a gun and shot the neighbor's house" and "hit a 
lady," the neighbor quoted the boy as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequent searches of McInnis' home found items suggesting that the incident 
was race-related, according to the FBI. Sheriff's deputies said they found 
swastikas, insignia of a white supremacist group, signs with racial remarks 
written on them, and figurines of blacks and a monkey hanging by their necks 
from nooses of rope and chain. 
</P>
<P>
One was the head of a Mr. T doll with sunglasses hanging from a workshop 
ceiling, according to an FBI affidavit filed in the case. Mr. T is a black TV 
actor. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said McInnis' garage contained military equipment, including a mortar 
that had been fired and a non-functional hand grenade. Also confiscated were 
two high-powered rifles, two shotguns, a .22-caliber rifle and ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
Court records show that laboratory tests of bullet fragments removed from 
Keller's abdomen during surgery came from one of the rifles seized at McInnis' 
home. Keller has since recovered. 
</P>
<P>
An FBI spokesman in Los Angeles said that at least half the racial incidents 
reported to the bureau involve physical violence and injuries, although 
shootings are unusual. The charge against McInnis also is part of a growing 
number of reports involving hundreds of race-related crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations alone reported 
167 race- related crimes in 1989, a record number and an increase of 75% over 
1988. The commission said those incidents resulted in 90 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Steward said the case against McInnis was first filed as an assault case in San 
Bernardino County Municipal Court, but then referred to federal authorities 
because of possible violations of Keller's civil rights. Federal agents 
arrested McInnis at the Victorville Courthouse on Thursday morning.

NEWS GIVES NRA A SHOT IN THE ARM;

POLITICS: FOR ASSOCIATION'S LEADERS MEETING IN ANAHEIM, THE BOOST COULDN'T HAVE 
COME AT A BETTER TIME.

<P>
As firearms exhibitors unloaded their wares here Thursday morning for the 
biggest public event at the National Rifle Assn.'s annual convention, NRA 
leaders huddled behind closed doors a few hundred yards away to track the real 
gun news. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the story?" NRA Chief Executive Officer Warren Cassidy anxiously asked 
his chief federal lobbyist, who had just gotten off the phone with his staffers 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The story, as those group leaders who were gathered in the room knew all too 
well, was the prospect of a U.S. Senate ban on some military-style assault 
weapons. And for them, the news was good: the sweeping crime bill that included 
the ban had been stalled indefinitely in a vote that Senate supporters blamed 
in part on a fierce, last-minute attack by the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
For beleaguered NRA leaders, who will have to explain a series of recent 
legislative losses to an increasingly frustrated membership at the convention 
this weekend, the win could not have come at a better time. 
</P>
<P>
The group's official reaction, as voiced by chief lobbyist Jim Baker at an 
impromptu press conference at the Anaheim Hilton and Towers hotel, was one of 
"mixed emotions." 
</P>
<P>
While the NRA had pushed hard to kill the assault-rifle portion of the bill as 
a staunch threat to the Second Amendment, it had supported other components on 
the death penalty and other toughened crime measures, Baker said, making the 
Senate vote only a partial win. 
</P>
<P>
More typical, however, was the unbridled enthusiasm of Harlon Carter, NRA 
executive committee member and former president, who said in an interview, "If 
indeed the crime bill is dead, glory be!" 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy, relating the early-morning update on the Senate bill, said NRA leaders 
were both relieved and thrilled by word of the legislation's apparent demise. 
</P>
<P>
But he and other NRA leaders said the assault-gun ban could still be revived in 
some form by gun-control advocates and warned that they are preparing for a 
tough fight. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel our enemies are going to give up that easily," said legislative 
policy committee chairman Richard Riley, who is likely to be elected the next 
president of the NRA on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Senate supporters of the crime bill and its anti-assault gun 
provision blamed their inability to cut off debate on the measure on a torrent 
of mailings by the NRA to members in eight states, targeting senators whose 
votes were seen as threatening. Majority Leader George Mitchell, one of the 
targets of phone calls from NRA members, said many of the statements in the 
mailings were "false and misleading." 
</P>
<P>
But NRA officials insisted that their campaign included only "the truth" about 
the threat posed by gun controls to law-abiding firearms owners -- and the 
inability to deter criminals who they say will manage to get ahold of guns no 
matter what the laws. 
</P>
<P>
"If the American people knew the truth," said Riley, "we wouldn't have been in 
this situation to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
But the NRA was in this situation because of the Senate's surprising decision 
two weeks ago to include in its crime package a ban on 14 semiautomatic assault 
rifles and pistols. The move would have expanded the list of banned weapons 
beyond 43 other imports that President Bush outlawed last summer under an 
administrative order. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate vote unleashed hundreds of phone calls to the NRA headquarters in 
Washington from angry members demanding to know what had happened to a group 
with an $87.5-million annual budget and a reputation as an unbeatable lobbying 
force on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, the defeat of the crime bill Thursday shows that the NRA is 
still a force to be reckoned with in national politics, despite reports of its 
waning influence, group leaders insisted. 
</P>
<P>
"Seems like our future is supposedly always threatened, but we keep on 
surviving and keep on thriving," Carter said. But officials acknowledged that, 
after a string of gun-control restrictions at the federal level and in 
California, New Jersey, Connecticut and other states, it may take more than a 
single vote to pacify NRA members. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a great deal of frustration among the membership based on a very tough 
year," Baker said. "I think that you're going to see that frustration played 
out at the annual membership meeting." 
</P>
<P>
The NRA convention gets into full swing today with the start of the gun exhibit 
at the Anaheim Convention Center, which is open to the public and is expected 
to draw about 250 dealers. At the Hilton, about 20,000 members are also 
expected to take part in workshops, committee meetings, an awards luncheon and 
a rally to kick off a new anti-gun control campaign.

TRAGEDY: A 19-YEAR-OLD BEING PULLED BY A CAR FALLS OFF HIS BOARD. HE'S NOT

DANA POINT -- Joel Christopher Banks longed to be center-stage in the Southern 
California beach scene. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his parents' objections, the beach-crazy 19-year-old from Northern 
California packed up his things two years ago and moved to Laguna Niguel, where 
he found an apartment with three other young men who shared his unquenchable 
passion for surfing and skateboarding. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, however, his surfing ambitions were cut tragically short 
when he fell off his skateboard while hanging onto the back of his roommate's 
moving car and slammed his head onto the asphalt driveway of the Monarch Bay 
Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
By Thursday, Banks, who was described by friends and relatives as an energetic 
and happy young man, was near death. 
</P>
<P>
Lying in an intensive-care unit, he had slipped into a coma from a crushed 
skull and was not expected to live, said his father, Jeff Banks, who anxiously 
waited at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center for word of his son's fate. 
</P>
<P>
If doctors by today cannot find activity in his brain, he will be disconnected 
from the life-support system, Jeff Banks said. 
</P>
<P>
Once disconnected from the life-support system, Banks is expected to die. He 
will be taken back to Dublin, a Bay Area town near Oakland, for burial. 
</P>
<P>
"He has big ideas, just like any other young man," Banks said of his son's 
other ambition of becoming an oceanographer in New Zealand. His son is a 
student at Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
"But if they didn't work out," Banks continued, "there's always Salt Creek" 
Beach, a popular South County surfing spot where he and his son shared the same 
waves when he came to South County on periodic visits. 
</P>
<P>
When Banks moved to Laguna Niguel, his father said, "it was like losing a 
friend." 
</P>
<P>
Graeme E. Swayn, also 19, said he, Banks and their two other roommates were 
preparing their evening meal Wednesday but needed to go to a supermarket in 
Monarch Bay Plaza to buy bread and hamburger. 
</P>
<P>
Banks and Swayn jumped on their skateboards and rode about a mile to the store, 
near the intersection of Crown Valley Parkway and South Coast Highway. 
Meanwhile, roommate Todd L. Caniglia, 23, followed them in his late-model 
Toyota Celica. 
</P>
<P>
After purchasing the groceries, the skateboarders asked Caniglia to tow them up 
a steep driveway leading out of the shopping center. They grabbed onto the 
trunk of the Celica as the car accelerated to about 20 m.p.h., Swayn said. 
</P>
<P>
A moment later, Swayn noticed a rough cement patch on the asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the cement, yelled and jumped off," Swayn said. "Joel let go a 
split-second too late." 
</P>
<P>
The wheels on Banks' skateboard caught on the patch, knocking him backward to 
the ground, Swayn said. 
</P>
<P>
"His body got real stiff and he was moaning real loud," Swayn said. "I thought 
he was hurt just a little, but when I got there, the back of his head was all 
bloody." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Sheriff's Department spokesman Richard J. Olson said that no one 
has been charged in the 8:06 p.m. accident but that an investigation is 
ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
Although no records are available on the number of skateboard-related accidents 
in Orange County, sheriff's officials said that as summer approaches, the 
number of skateboarders who get hurt is bound to rise. 
</P>
<P>
With the demise of skateboard parks because of high insurance rates, shopping 
centers are drawing an increasing number of skateboarders who intermingle 
dangerously with pedestrians and motorists while they plunge headlong off 
stairways and slide down metal handrails on their colorful boards, Lt. George 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We get a steady barrage of calls from merchants," Johnson said. "You don't 
have to look far to see kids riding around in those areas (shopping centers) 
doing damage and scaring people to death." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, one Monarch Bay Plaza flower stand operator said that bothersome 
skateboarders, most of whom are teen-agers, constantly crisscross the busy 
parking lot after school and on sunny weekends. 
</P>
<P>
"They do a lot of skateboarding down that hill," the woman said, gesturing 
toward the steep driveway. "I'm usually here on Fridays and Saturdays, and when 
they come, I chase them away. They come up here (near the theater) on the 
sidewalks. It's really risky." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Danylyshyn, who works in an office nearby, said: "I've chased kids out of 
the parking lot on skateboards because they're not allowed in here. Most of the 
time, they're not going to get hurt, but things can happen." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said that in Mission Viejo alone, the vast majority of its estimated 
17,000 teen-agers own skateboards, a more popular form of transportation than 
bicycling. 
</P>
<P>
And although Orange County and many cities have restrictive skateboard laws, 
there are not enough officers to enforce them, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the deputy continued, it is against the county's skateboard law 
to ride down a public street. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably will never put a stop to it," Johnson said. "You have got to be 
there at the time ( of a violation)." 
</P>
<P>
But David Swift, associate editor of the Oceanside-based magazine Transworld 
Skateboarding, said serious accidents involving skateboards are extremely rare. 
Most of the opposition to the sport comes from people who wrongly believe that 
skateboarders purposely try to scare pedestrians, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They (pedestrians) hear a skateboard and they freeze up," said Swift, a 
professional skateboarder. "It is definitely not one of the more dangerous 
sports. There are tons more people out there paralyzed from football injuries. 
There is definitely a lot of skateboard paranoia." 
</P>
<P>
Swift said that rather than complain, merchants and city officials should set 
up more professional skateboard parks, where riders could perform in a 
controlled environment. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids need a place to skate," Swift said, adding that it is a healthy 
sport that keeps "kids off the street. People complain, but they don't do 
anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
Swayn said that Banks is an accomplished skateboarder who never got in a 
serious accident before. He attributed the accident to fate. 
</P>
<P>
"We go skateboarding all over Salt Creek all the time," Swayn said. "He was a 
good skateboarder. I can't believe he lost it."

MAN TRYING TO CORRAL DOG DIES IN WATER HAZARD

<TEXT>
<P>
A man trying to retrieve his dog from a deep water hazard at an exclusive 
country club apparently drowned Tuesday night, despite a frantic effort by 
residents and firefighters to save him. 
</P>
<P>
The man, identified by police as Harold Neuman, 60, of Newport Beach, 
apparently had jumped into the pond near the 15th hole at Big Canyon Country 
Club to stop his golden retriever from going after ducks, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Neuman, who according to residents lived in the neighborhood of luxury homes 
along the golf course, was found about 15 minutes later and rushed to Hoag 
Hospital, where he was pronounced dead shortly before 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Mangold, a resident whose house faces the golf course, had just 
returned home after shopping when the victim's panicked wife knocked on her 
sliding glass door shortly after 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"She screamed, 'Help, help, my husband has fallen into the lake,' " said 
Mangold, who added that she then dialed the 911 emergency number. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents said they ran out to help Neuman after they heard his cries 
for help and the dog's barking. 
</P>
<P>
When firefighters arrived, they found several of the residents wading in the 
water, searching for the victim. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept diving and looking, but the water was black and I couldn't see," said 
Roger Jones, whose home faces the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighter Steve Carter and paramedic Mike Macey borrowed inflatable rafts 
from a resident and paddled out to the center of the lake to look for Neuman. 
</P>
<P>
While they were in the water, a police helicopter circled and lit up the lake, 
which is about 200 yards long and 50 yards wide. 
</P>
<P>
After about 15 minutes of searching, the victim was found in the center of the 
lake, about 50 yards offshore, where the water is about 16 feet deep, Newport 
Beach Fire Department Capt. Craig Chastain said. 
</P>
<P>
When Neuman was brought to shore, he was in full cardiac arrest and not 
breathing, Chastain said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics and city lifeguards attempted to resuscitate him as his wife and son 
looked on. 
</P>
<P>
Chastain said the victim's dog was not harmed. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time I saw it, it was running loose" on the shoreline, barking at 
ducks, he said.

PUBLIC ASKED TO HELP FIND SLAYING SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police are asking for the public's help in finding a man suspected of stabbing 
to death an acquaintance in front of a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Arturo Rey Vega Rosas, 23, of Orange is wanted in the knifing of Pedro Rosas 
Hernandez, 24, also of Orange, said Sgt. Bob Gustafson. 
</P>
<P>
Police at first thought that Vega Rosas was headed toward Mexico after the May 
31 incident, but recently investigators received information that the suspect 
is still in Orange County, Gustafson said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosas Hernandez died in the parking lot of Claudia's restaurant on East Chapman 
Avenue after he apparently had an argument with Vega Rosas, Gustafson said. 
Vega Rosas allegedly pulled out a large knife and stabbed Hernandez several 
times, Gustafson said. 
</P>
<P>
Vega Rosas is described as 5 feet, 8 inches tall and weighing about 175 pounds. 
He has dark eyes, black shoulder-length hair and a light-colored mustache, 
Gustafson said.

2 WHO SUED CITY MAY HAVE TO PAY TAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two residents who sued the city earlier this year are faced with the 
possibility of having to pay the city's legal fees, even though the lawsuit was 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Former City Council candidate Margie L. Rice and resident Grace Epperson filed 
a lawsuit in January after the City Council passed an ordinance that extended 
Councilwoman Lyn Gillespie's term in office from two to four years. 
</P>
<P>
The city wants Rice and Epperson to pay the $4,000 that officials say it cost 
to have City Atty. Richard Jones prepare the case that was dropped when Kenneth 
E. Mick, attorney for Rice and Epperson, failed to file the necessary documents 
before a hearing on Feb. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Mick said he didn't proceed because he didn't think his clients could win. 
</P>
<P>
"When I took the case, I thought the taxpayer suit would probably prevail," 
Mick said. "But I later learned that an ordinance must be overturned by a 
referendum of the people within 30 days after it is passed. Believing that the 
court wouldn't reverse the ordinance, we dismissed the case." 
</P>
<P>
Jones said he spent close to 40 hours preparing for the case, adding that 
asking for legal fees in this type of situation is common. But Rice and Mick 
said they doubted that Jones spent that much time on the case and called the 
attempt to get legal fees a "personal vendetta." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the time estimate is padded," Mick said. "If it took in excess of 20 
hours, something's wrong. I can't see anything over four to five hours. This is 
just one or two members of the City Council being vindictive." 
</P>
<P>
The council extended Gillespie's term after she questioned the legality of her 
shorter term that was designed to even out the number of council seats open 
during each election. 
</P>
<P>
Although the lawsuit was dropped and may end up costing her money, Rice, a 
member of the Westminster School District Board, said she has no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"I still believe that the council did not have the right to give (Gillespie) 
two more years without a vote of the people," Rice declared. "I still stand by 
the principle of the lawsuit, and if I have to pay for it, then I have to pay 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
The city's request for legal fees will be considered by Superior Court Judge 
Eileen C. Moore at a hearing on July 17. GREG HERNANDEZ

ANTI-OIL DRILLING CAMPAIGN TO BEGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A petition drive for a ballot measure that would effectively ban oil and gas 
drilling in the central portion of the city will begin Monday, its chief 
organizer said. 
</P>
<P>
The Garden Grove GOO (Get Oil Out) group, headed by Woodrow Butterfield, is 
seeking to ban oil and gas drilling within 800 feet of churches, schools or 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
While the ban would be citywide, its intent is to forestall any future plans by 
Chevron USA to drill from its site at Pearl and Nelson streets near downtown. A 
request by Chevron for a drilling permit was rejected last June on a 3-2 vote 
of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen J. Tilman Williams and Robert F. Dinsen and local businessman Bruce 
Broadwater are listed as the official sponsors of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 2,500 blank petitions ready to go out," Butterfield said. "We don't 
anticipate having any problems getting enough signatures." 
</P>
<P>
The group has missed the May 31 deadline given by City Clerk Carolyn Morris for 
submitting 5,700 signatures to ensure a spot on the November ballot. But 
Butterfield, a local businessman and political activist, said he is still 
confident. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been knocked off track," he said. "There are many ways it can 
happen. If we get 15% of the voters (compared to the 10% required for a 
regularly scheduled election) we can have (a vote) any time we want," with a 
special election. 
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, the city could save the cost of an election if the council 
adopted the ban after the initiative qualified for the ballot. JIM TORTOLANO

NO GAS OR FAST FOOD AT SITE OF NEW CENTER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has agreed to allow a shopping center planned for the east end 
of the city to expand by 3.6 acres but refused to allow a gas station and 
fast-food restaurant there. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion of the center, which is expected to include a Ralphs market and 
Thrifty Drug Store, was allowed in a 3-1 vote. Council member Henry W. Wedaa 
was not present. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously against plans for a gas station and a fast-food 
restaurant which, they argued, would bring commuter traffic into the city from 
the Riverside Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not vote for any gas station that invites commuters to stop and buy 
gas," said Councilman Irwin Fried. 
</P>
<P>
John O'Mara, a representative of the Costa Mesa-based Diversified Shopping 
Center Inc., said that without the gas station and Carl's Jr. restaurant, 
developers would "have to make some major changes to make this project fiscally 
feasible." 
</P>
<P>
About 30 residents appeared at the meeting Tuesday, and many agreed with Fried 
and the other council members. 
</P>
<P>
"These components will turn our neighborhood into a commuter pit stop," said 
resident Leslie Boies. 
</P>
<P>
But those who spoke in favor of the expansion said a large, well-planned 
shopping center is needed at the corner of La Palma Avenue and Via Lomas de 
Yorba East, because the nearest grocery store is more than four miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Ken Ryan said the city has a responsibility to make such amenities 
available to those who live in the area. "If they weren't going to provide 
these services, they shouldn't have allowed so many (housing) units in the east 
end of town," he said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Mara said the inclusion of the parcel next to the site is necessary because 
it would give the center access to a side street, increasing convenience for 
shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Mark Schwing cast the only vote against any expansion, stating that 
an environmental impact report of the plans for the larger site should be 
submitted to the council before any decision is made. LINDA M. HICKMAN

RECYCLING PROGRAM AWAITS NEW BIDS

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council will delay starting a pilot recycling program at City Hall and 
the Police Department until other recycling companies in the city are 
contacted. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis asked that a proposed contract with The Shred Co. 
of Costa Mesa be postponed until it is determined whether other recycling 
companies can give the city a better deal. 
</P>
<P>
"We could end up with a good deal where we could have a clear profit," Genis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The council had agreed May 21 to pay the company to haul away an estimated two 
tons of garbage generated weekly at the two sites. The company would then sell 
the recycled goods at market rates and reimburse that amount to the city. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement would have set aside $5,000 to pay the company over a six-month 
period; however, city staff believed the program would eventually pay for 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
In an informal survey of her own, Genis contacted four other companies and 
found that most of them would not charge the city an initial fee. The council 
will accept proposals from the recyclers to determine whether they can provide 
the same or better services at a competitive rate. 
</P>
<P>
The two departments will recycle newspapers, computer and ledger paper, and 
aluminum cans.

3 ARRESTED IN ORANGE FOR KIDNAP OF UP TO 18 IN TIJUANA;

EXTORTION SCHEME: ABDUCTION VICTIMS WERE TAKEN TO INGLEWOOD FROM ACROSS THE

<P>
Police arrested three people Thursday who allegedly kidnaped at least 18 people 
from the streets of Tijuana last week and drove some to Inglewood, where they 
were forced to call friends and relatives to raise their own ransom. 
</P>
<P>
Police Lt. Ed Tunstall said the alleged kidnap and extortion plot was uncovered 
Thursday when one of the victims, Irmalinda Flores Sanchez, 35, of Orange, 
called police. Tunstall said she had been set free to raise $900 for the 
release of two relatives who were still being held captive in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
As Sanchez met the suspects at an Orange shopping center at Prospect Street and 
Chapman Avenue to pay money Thursday, police arrested two sisters, Minerva 
Garcia, 18, of Inglewood and Alicia Garcia, 21, of Los Angeles, along with a 
17-year-old male juvenile. The three were not armed. The women were taken to 
Orange County Jail where they were booked on charges of kidnaping, extortion 
and false imprisonment, police said. Bond was set at $50,000 each. The 
teen-ager was taken to Orange County Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't heard of anything like this before," Tunstall said. "We've heard of 
burns by coyotes (who bring illegals over the border for a fee) but nothing 
like this." 
</P>
<P>
From interviews with the victims, Tunstall said, police learned that at least 
eight people holding pistols and flashing badges like those used by Mexican 
federal agents allegedly abducted the people from the streets of Tijuana on 
Saturday and took them to an assembly point in Mexico, where they determined 
who had friends or relatives in Southern California. Those people were put in a 
camper and taken to a home in Inglewood, where they were forced to make 
telephone calls to raise money for their release, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said in an interview that the suspects posed as federal agents. She 
said her cousin and niece pleaded with them to allow them to remain in Tijuana, 
where they live and work. As many as 10 of the hostages paid $300 each to avoid 
being kidnaped, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking from the living room of her apartment, Sanchez said the suspects made 
stops in San Ysidro and Chula Vista, but none of the victims could get away to 
call for help because they feared for the others' safety. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to take care of each other because they (abductors) kept a vigil over 
us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She and her cousin, Mercedes Cruz Zuniga, 35, and niece, Maria Luisa Virginia 
Vera Flores, 19, said they were still afraid. On a warm Thursday afternoon, 
Sanchez kept the windows to her apartment closed and curtains drawn. She said 
she plans to move soon. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said that when she was freed she called police because she did not know 
what else to do. 
</P>
<P>
"We were obligated to a lot of money and we couldn't do it (pay). I was not 
able to make the decision (about how to handle the situation) for myself, so I 
called the police," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said eight people had been held in the Inglewood house since Sunday and fed 
potatoes and beans. When Inglewood police went to the house Thursday, it was 
empty. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said the suspects asked $300 each for their release. When the three of 
them couldn't get the money, the suspects drove Sanchez to the Orange 
neighborhood where she lived and told her that if she did not raise the money 
her relatives would not be released, she said. 
</P>
<P>
FO (A2) Ordered to Seek Own Ransom: Several people were allegedly kidnaped in 
Tijuana and taken to Inglewood where they were ordered to seek ransom from 
relatives in Southern California. Irmalinda Flores Sanchez of Orange, above, 
right, called police after she said she'd been freed to raise $900 for the 
release of two relatives, Maria Luisa Virginia Vera Flores, left, and Mercedes 
Cruz Zuniga. Three people are being held on kidnaping and extortion charges, 
police said.MARK BOSTER / Los Angeles Times

ABSENTEES TO DECIDE DEMO NOMINEE IN 42ND DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Election officials in Orange and Los Angeles counties Thursday began counting 
the absentee ballots that will decide who will win the Democratic nomination in 
the 42nd Congressional District, where the top two vote-getters were separated 
by a handful of votes. 
</P>
<P>
However, the results won't be known for several weeks, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is terrible," said James Cavuoto, one of the candidates. "My hope is to 
get at least an indication of how these votes are going to swing by tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Cavuoto and Guy C. Kimbrough emerged from Tuesday's primary just 14 votes 
apart. Bryan W. Stevens, the third candidate, trailed the leader, Kimbrough, by 
1,204 votes in the race for the right to challenge Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Lomita) in November. 
</P>
<P>
That brings the contest down to an undetermined number of uncounted absentee 
ballots received on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
Since the largely coastal 42nd District stretches from Torrance to Huntington 
Beach, some ballots in the district are counted in Los Angeles County and 
others in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County registrar of voters office plans to have an unofficial count 
of late-arriving absentee ballots by late this afternoon. But Los Angeles 
County's tally will be part of a detailed canvass lasting more than two weeks, 
said Marcia Ventura of the county registrar-recorder's office. 
</P>
<P>
Election officials in Orange and Los Angeles counties said they do not know 
exactly how many late-arriving absentee ballots are at stake -- much less how 
many of them were cast by voters in the 42nd Congressional District. 
</P>
<P>
With little left to do but contemplate the hair-thin margin separating them, 
Cavuoto, a computer industry publisher from Torrance, and Kimbrough, a 
political science instructor from Huntington Beach, are busy debating who will 
wind up as the Democratic nominee. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrough, who cast himself in the campaign as more conservative than Cavuoto, 
said he is optimistic because studies show that absentee voters are more 
conservative than other voters. He also pointed out that his campaign sent mail 
to people who had requested absentee ballots, while Cavuoto's did not. 
</P>
<P>
The result, Kimbrough said, was evident in the roughly 2,800 absentee ballots 
counted before primary day: Kimbrough captured more than twice as many as 
Cavuoto. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the final tally will probably confirm my win," Kimbrough said. 
</P>
<P>
Cavuoto disagreed. Unlike absentees who sent off their ballots well before 
Election Day, he said, many late absentees may have received his campaign 
literature before voting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced (they voted) differently from the early absentee voters," 
Cavuoto said. If they did not, and the margin separating him from Kimbrough 
remains slim, Cavuoto said he will request a recount. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's just a handful of votes, I think I owe it to my campaign workers to 
find out if the totals were right," Cavuoto said.

SOME CENSUS WORKERS HINT JOB ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A decision by the U.S. Census Bureau to exclude clerks and other office workers 
from a $1.50-an-hour pay raise given field workers prompted scattered 
grumbling, and threats of sickouts and work slowdowns Thursday among census 
employees in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
If such labor problems materialized, they could slow the pace of the count, 
which is already lagging behind the national average in some areas of the 
county. "I just feel very strongly that this is not very fair," said Peggy 
Barry, a clerk in the Census Bureau's Fullerton office. "We're not going to get 
one more red cent, and we're working our tails off." 
</P>
<P>
Census officials in Washington said they decided to raise salaries for 
enumerators in selected areas of the country, including Southern California, 
because of concerns that the count was being slowed by attrition and other 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
At the Irvine district office, for example, nearly one of every two field 
enumerators quit soon after they began work, forcing census officials to 
scramble to train new employees. The enumerators go out into the community to 
count households that have not responded to the census questionnaire that was 
mailed out in late March. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles and Orange counties, the salaries of enumerators rose from $7.50 
to $9 an hour this week. They also gained a $1.50 bonus for every household 
they visit. 
</P>
<P>
As word of the salary boost spread, some census office workers reacted by 
complaining to their managers, according to Michael Weiler, assistant regional 
census manager for operations in Southern California. Census office workers in 
San Bernardino walked out on Wednesday but were back on the job Thursday, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, several office workers talked briefly of conducting sickouts 
or work slowdowns. But officials at the county's four census offices said there 
have been no indications that any sort of labor action has been undertaken by 
the workers, who are hired on a temporary basis for jobs that last from a few 
weeks to several months. 
</P>
<P>
One employee in the Irvine district office said more than a dozen computer 
key-punch operators were planning to transfer to jobs as field enumerators to 
reap the new pay raise. The employee, who asked that his name not be used, 
suggested that the district's efforts would be undermined by the transfers as 
officials hurried to train new workers and fill the slots. 
</P>
<P>
But local officials said they expected few problems to crop up because of the 
pay issue. William Bellamy, district director in Irvine, said he talked with 
key-punch operators, clerks and other office personnel about the reasoning 
behind the salary increase for enumerators. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a few that still requested to be enumerators, but quite a few that 
withdrew their requests," he said. "I see no indication of any problems. Quite 
frankly, I would be talking to them right quick if I thought that any problems 
were occurring." 
</P>
<P>
Bellamy and several other local census officials said, however, that they felt 
the salary hike seemed unfair to the estimated several hundred office workers 
who didn't get it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate that there was nothing comparable for the office staff," said 
Joe Montes, manager of the Fullerton census office. "I would expect that we're 
going to get some grumbling.

UC IRVINE MEN'S SAILING TEAM WINS THIRD NATIONAL TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine's sailing team has spent the past three or four months practicing in 
a little corner of Newport Harbor, trying to simulate the conditions the team 
would face at the national championships at Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
The work paid off Wednesday and the men's team won its third national 
championship, taking the dinghy title at the Intercollegiate Yacht Racing Assn. 
national championships. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine won with a low score of 158 points, followed by defending champion Old 
Dominion, which had 166, and Tufts, which had 174. USC finished 10th with 309 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine also won the national sailing title in 1972 and 1988. The Anteaters 
placed third last year. 
</P>
<P>
Skipper Mike Sturman and crew Geoff Becker won Division B for Irvine with 74 
points, and skipper James Malm and crew Scott Munch finished third in Division 
A with 84 points. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine typically practices in the open water of Newport Harbor, but in 
preparation for the competition on the Charles River, the team sought out a 
place where the winds are shiftier. 
</P>
<P>
"The location where we sail in Boston is right in the middle of the city, and 
the breezes are very unpredictable from moving around buildings," said Craig 
Wilson, who is a former coach of the team and did not make the trip to Boston. 
"The Charles is famous for causing good people to do poorly, and allowing 
others to come out on top sometimes. Consistent sailing is very, very difficult 
there." 
</P>
<P>
So the team searched out an area of capricious winds. "We called it 
pseudo-Boston, right up against the buildings where the winds are very shifty," 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Nine Irvine sailors from the 20-member team made the trip to Cambridge to 
compete in the 32-race dinghy competition. The emphasis in the races, which 
last about 25 minutes, is on tactics, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
"The college format places an emphasis on boat handling and strategy, making 
quick decisions," Wilson said. "The Olympic format stresses speed more than 
anything else. The races are longer." 
</P>
<P>
In Sturman, a senior, Irvine has a sailor Wilson describes as "textbook." 
</P>
<P>
"He does everything very, very well," Wilson said. "When it comes to Boston, 
that usually is not a winning formula, to do things the way you're supposed to. 
It worked this time. Mike ended up having the best performance." 
</P>
<P>
Malm, also a senior, gives Irvine a sailor of a different sort. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the Charles is so unpredictable, it's built for someone with a creative 
approach to the whole sport," Wilson said. "That's where it's a strength if 
someone doesn't do the standard thing, "(Malm) is pretty unpredictable, but 
it's an unpredictable place. He does funny things that make a coach nervous." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jon Pinckney, a former Irvine sailor who took over for Wilson, 
accompanied the team to Boston. Nick Adamson and Pat Rowley sailed in the 16th 
Division A race, and Ross Nermeroff replaced Becker in the 16th Division B 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine placed fifth in the recently completed women's championships. The 
Anteaters will remain in Boston for another team competition involving three 
boats from one team pitted against three from another.

AMATEUR BASEBALL DRAFT; 
</P>
<P>
ST. LOUIS SELECTS GONZALES; GIANTS CHOOSE BORGOGNO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton left fielder Rich Gonzales, who sprained his neck when he 
hit the outfield wall during the College World Series, was notified Thursday 
that he has been drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales, a senior who led the team with a .386 average but had only one at-bat 
in two world series games, said he was chosen in the 27th round and will 
probably sign with the Cardinals Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Titan second baseman Mate Borgogno was selected by the San Francisco Giants in 
the 18th round, and Titan relief pitcher Doug Ketchen was chosen by the Houston 
Astros in the 19th round. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Bradish, a first baseman who hit .352 with seven home runs and 30 runs 
batted in for Christ College of Irvine, was picked by the Chicago White Sox in 
the 13th round. 
</P>
<P>
Willy Speakman, a catcher from Fullerton College, was drafted by the Baltimore 
Orioles in the 16th round, but instead will attend Cal State Long Beach on a 
baseball scholarship, said his father, Ralph Speakman. 
</P>
<P>
Borgogno, a junior, said he will make a decision on whether to sign with San 
Francisco or remain in college by next week. He met with a Giants 
representative Thursday but didn't seem happy with the team's offer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're kind of far apart right now, but I'm in no big hurry," Borgogno said. 
"If it doesn't work out, I'll be glad to go back to Fullerton." 
</P>
<P>
Ketchen, a senior, could not be reached Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Titan pitcher Huck Flener, who was selected in the ninth round by the Toronto 
Blue Jays, met with a team official Thursday and said he "will most likely 
sign." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Mota of Fullerton College signed a minor-league contract with the Houston 
Astros, who drafted him in the second round. Mota, son of Dodger coach Manny 
Mota, has until Tuesday to report to Auburn of the New York-Penn League. 
</P>
<P>
Former Tustin High School standout Steve Surico signed a minor league contract 
with the Texas Rangers. He was drafted in the 51st round Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Surico, a left-handed pitcher, was a Southern Section 3-A first team selection 
in 1986. He pitched for four seasons at Loyola Marymount. His best season was 
1988, when he went 12-2 and led Loyola to the NCAA regionals. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine pitcher Ken Whitworth, who was selected in the 10th round by the 
Miami Miracle, an independent team in the Class-A Florida State League, has not 
decided between professional baseball or dental school. 
</P>
<P>
Whitworth, who has been accepted to the UCLA dental school, had mixed feelings 
about being picked by the Miracle, which made its draft debut in the fourth 
round and will hold rights to its selections for one year. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be good in that you start at the A level instead of rookie league, and 
if you do well, other teams can bid for you," Whitworth said. "But it can hurt 
you because you're not affiliated with a major league team." 
</P>
<P>
Southern California College had four players drafted , according to Coach 
Charlie Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
Right-handed pitcher Jim Dedrick was selected in the 28th round by the 
Baltimore Orioles and was signed Thursday. Dedrick, who will report to 
Baltimore's rookie team in Bluefield, W.Va., was an All-District III first team 
selection. He was 9-3 with 1.98 ERA last season. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Raphael Garcia (21st round by Toronto), shortstop Joe Aversa (40th 
round, St. Louis) and right-handed pitcher Larry Jacinto (40th round, Dodgers) 
were other SCC players drafted.

HUNT-WESSON DIVISION PLAGUED BY HIGH TURNOVER RATE -- OF BOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

FULLERTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is almost old-hat to the employees of Beatrice Co.'s Hunt-Wesson division 
here. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of Beatrice by ConAgra marks the fifth time in six years that 
the nearly 2,500 Hunt-Wesson employees in Orange County -- about 9,000 
throughout the United States and Canada -- have had a new boss. 
</P>
<P>
This time, as in times past, officials at the campus-like corporate 
headquarters complex in Fullerton remained mum on what might happen to the 
division, whose brand name products include Hunt's tomato ketchup, Wesson Oil, 
Peter Pan peanut butter and Orville Redenbacher popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
ConAgra officials declined to discuss the Beatrice acquisition Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, however, the Nebraska-based food processing giant said 
it viewed the Beatrice deal as "a major strategic acquisition that served our 
stockholders' long-term interests." 
</P>
<P>
And that appears to signal ConAgra's intent to hang onto the Beatrice units 
rather than sell them off piecemeal as the former owner, New York buyout 
specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., had been doing ever since 
acquiring Beatrice in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt-Wesson, in fact, has been on the block twice since 1988 as Beatrice tried 
to raise funds by selling its food-processing divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Nicholson, executive director of the Industrial League of Orange County, 
said the deal would be a blow to Orange County if ConAgra decided to relocate 
or dismantle the Hunt-Wesson operation. 
</P>
<P>
"It would hurt us because there are 2,500 or so jobs at stake," he said, "and 
also because having a major company like Hunt-Wesson adds to the county's 
prestige as a business location." 
</P>
<P>
Because it has always been part of a larger corporation, Hunt-Wesson's finances 
are not in the public record. But the company reportedly is a profitable one. 
</P>
<P>
That profit-making ability could have a lot to do with how ConAgra treats 
Hunt-Wesson -- especially whether the headquarters operation remains in 
Fullerton. Except for some payroll thinning, previous owners have left the 
operation alone. 
</P>
<P>
The division got its start in the early 1930s as Hunt Brothers Packing Co. in 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
It was acquired in 1943 by an entrepreneur named Norton Simon, who merged it 
with his nearby Val Vita citrus juice processing operation and called the new 
operation Hunt Foods. Simon acquired the Wesson Co. in the early 1950s and 
merged it with the food concern to create Hunt-Wesson Foods Inc. The company 
became a centerpiece of Norton Simon Industries. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-acre headquarters complex, which housed some of art-loving Simon's 
sculpture collection, was built in the early 1960s. The sculptures were removed 
when the facility was acquired by Chicago-based Esmark in 1983 as part of its 
acquisition of Norton Simon Industries. 
</P>
<P>
Beatrice acquired Esmark in 1984 and then, in 1986, was taken private in a 
leveraged buyout led by KKR. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt-Wesson is the largest of Beatrice's remaining food divisions -- several 
have been sold off since KKR took control -- and the only one in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
It employs about 1,500 people in sales, administration, marketing and research, 
and about 1,000 seasonal workers in a tomato processing plant and can 
manufacturing facility. The tomato canning season is about to head into full 
swing. 
</P>
<P>
The division also operates Cal-Compack Foods, a chili powder manufacturing 
plant in Santa Ana, which employs about two dozen people who make private-label 
chili powders for stores, restaurants and food processors. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Hunt-Wesson shut down its vegetable oil refinery in 
Fullerton, one of the smaller Wesson Oil facilities in the country, laying off 
100 workers. 
</P>
<P>
Wesson Oil is still processed in facilities in Memphis, Tenn., and Savannah, 
Ga., and Hunt's tomato products are turned out at processing plants in Northern 
California, Ohio and Canada as well as in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The Hunt-Wesson division's other major facilities are the Orville Redenbacher 
popcorn plant in Valparaiso, Ind.; Peter Pan peanut butter processing in 
Sylvester, Ga.; Rosarita Mexican food products in Mesa, Ariz.; and La Choy 
Oriental foods in Archbold, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt-Wesson spokeswoman Kay Carpenter, in a brief telephone interview Thursday, 
said the sale of Beatrice to ConAgra was announced to employees about 2 p.m. 
She said officials have received "absolutely no indication" of ConAgra's plans 
for the Hunt-Wesson division.

ROCKWELL REVAMPS DEFENSE ELECTRONICS UNIT FOR 3RD TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rockwell International Corp. said Thursday that it has reorganized its defense 
electronics operation again in a move aimed at further streamlining the 
business and boosting weapons sales in the United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The move marks the third time since July that Rockwell has announced a 
reshuffling of its Anaheim-based Defense Electronics unit, which is headed by 
John A. McLuckey, group president. 
</P>
<P>
The changes will not result in any layoffs or relocations, and the company will 
not take a charge against earnings as a result of the restructuring, said Ron 
Duncan, an executive vice president of the group, which employs 7,000 people in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The reorganization is designed to help the defense electronics group handle 
several major contract programs the company has won in the past several years 
more efficiently, Duncan said. For instance, two divisions that make navigation 
systems for missiles and submarines will be combined into a single division. 
</P>
<P>
The group's largest programs include contracts for the Hellfire missile, F-111 
aircraft avionics gear, a combat system for a Royal Australian Navy submarine 
program and guidance devices for the MX and Midgetman missiles. 
</P>
<P>
"The new organization will focus our core competencies on the global markets we 
now serve, as well as emerging business opportunities," McLuckey said. "This 
streamlining effectively restructures 17 former business segments into 14 
more-focused market thrusts." 
</P>
<P>
George Podrasky Jr., an analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago, said it 
was unclear whether the restructuring would leave the company better prepared 
to deal with the defense downturn. He said Rockwell's defense unit, which 
accounted for about $1.7 billion of the corporation's $12 billion in revenue 
last year, still has a healthy mix of programs. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been disappointed with the profits of the defense electronics area, 
but I don't know how this will change things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence M. Harris, an analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los 
Angeles, said the restructuring makes sense because the company had several 
units, such as its missile and submarine navigation businesses, reporting to 
different groups. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said the defense electronics unit will have about $2 billion in sales 
under the new organization. He said he expected the group to report flat sales 
and profits for the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
The company's defense group has been growing since last July, when the missile 
systems groups were combined under the Autonetics Electronics Systems unit in 
Anaheim. In March, the defense electronics group was created by combining the 
former Autonetics Electronics Systems and Collins Defense Communications 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the company added Collins Government Avionics Division in Cedar 
Rapids, Iowa, to the electronics group. The Collins unit makes avionics and 
radio systems.

COLOR COPIERS REPRESENT SMALL BUT FASTEST-GROWING SEGMENT OF MARKET; 
</P>
<P>
INNOVATION: INCREASING USE OF OFFICE GRAPHICS AND DECREASING TECHNOLOGY COSTS 
ARE EXPECTED TO EXPAND U.S. INSTALLATION NUMBERS FROM 16,000 IN 1989 TO 178,000 
BY 1994.

<P>
Machines that make color copies represent only a small part of the office 
copier market, but the segment is the industry's fastest-growing as the 
technology comes down in price and companies place increased emphasis on 
graphics. 
</P>
<P>
By 1994, the number of color copiers installed nationwide is expected to grow 
to 178,000, compared with 16,000 at the end of last year, according to 
Dataquest Inc., a research firm in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
In comparison, there were about 5.6 million black-and-white copiers installed 
in the United States by the end of last year. 
</P>
<P>
The United States typically accounts for about one-third of the world copier 
market, said Richard Norton, vice president of Dataquest's copying and 
duplicating research service. 
</P>
<P>
Desktop publishing, increased use of office graphics and the advent of a new 
generation of lower-cost computer printers are expected to fuel demand for 
color copiers in offices, but the high cost of the technology will continue to 
remain an obstacle. Today, color copiers are most commonly found in commercial 
copy shops. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people don't perceive the need to copy color on a day-to-day basis," 
Norton said. "But I would be hard-pressed to think of a department in a company 
that couldn't use color in some form." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Colorocs Corp., a Norcross, Ga., color copier firm, said 
customers use the machines to copy engineering and design documents, real 
estate portfolios and advertising brochures, among other applications. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts also said they expect demand for the office machines to increase as 
managers realize that investing in their own equipment is less expensive than 
using outside services, particularly in companies that make a lot of color 
copies. 
</P>
<P>
Current leaders in the color copier market include Japan's Canon Inc., Eastman 
Kodak Co. of Rochester, N.Y., and Colorocs, all of which offer 
electrophotographic copiers. 
</P>
<P>
Similar to conventional black-and-white copiers, these machines copy documents 
by using light signals to create electrostatic patterns on a special drum. 
These patterns, in turn, are used as guides for colored toners, which the 
machine mixes to match the colors of the original before creating a copy on 
plain paper or a transparency. 
</P>
<P>
But cost remains a hindrance to the market's growth. Not only are the copying 
machines themselves far more expensive, but paper, toner and service costs for 
color copiers can be far higher than those for black-and-white copiers. 
</P>
<P>
While a black-and-white copy costs only a few cents per page, high-quality 
color copies can cost up to $4 per page, including equipment and service costs. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, many manufacturers are confident that the use of color in the 
office will advance enough to make in-house color copying fairly widespread. 
</P>
<P>
Among others, Mead Corp., the Dayton, Ohio, firm best-known for paper products 
and electronic publishing services, acknowledged that it is accepting reduced 
earnings while developing Cycolor, its color copying technology. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Ross, a financial analyst who follows Mead at Paine-Webber Inc., 
estimated that Cycolor is costing Mead about 45 cents per share per year. 
Mead's 1989 net income was $215.8 million, or $3.33 per share, on sales of 
$4.61 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"We are building a market," said Mead Chairman Burnell Roberts, who does not 
expect profits from Cycolor to begin showing up on Mead's balance sheet until 
the end of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rival Kodak offers its ColorEdge color copier, the industry's 
fastest, for the list price of $59,000. Canon offers a range of machines, 
including a relatively slow version listed at $24,500. 
</P>
<P>
Colorocs' machine, manufactured by Japan's Sharp Corp., is priced at $17,000. 
</P>
<P>
Xerox Corp. of Stamford, Conn., one of the best-known names in the business, is 
not a major player in the color segment, analysts said. A Xerox spokesman said 
the company is developing new products to replace its 1005, a $38,900 color 
copier that is no longer being manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
Machines based on Mead's new Cycolor technology cost as little as $6,000 but 
are slower than conventional copiers. In addition, the Cycolor machines require 
special, more expensive, coated paper. 
</P>
<P>
The cheaper machines, however, might be attractive to customers who make fewer 
than 500 color copies a month, Dataquest's Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
Shipments of Cycolor copiers began in 1989 with machines made by Brother 
Industries Ltd.; Seiko Mead, a joint venture with Japan's Seiko; and Noritsu 
America Corp.

BEHIND THE PLAIN EXTERIOR IS A FAMILY THAT COOKS GREAT MEXICAN SEAFOOD

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When 1st Street is finished being Little Saigon, it turns into Little 
Sonora-Durango-Jalisco-Chihuahua. There are more Mexican restaurants on 1st in 
Santa Ana than you could shake a chopstick at. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps there is even an embarrassment of riches. The seafood restaurant called 
Colima, at the corner of Fairview Street, ought to be busy but nobody seems 
able to find it in the crowd. The other night the only other people in the 
place were a lonely looking couple sitting silently on opposite sides of a 
giant fried fish. 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't help but notice them, and maybe this is another problem for Colima. 
The place is so bright, due to highly reflective chandeliers stuck in every 
corner of the room, that you may wish you had sunglasses. Perhaps the owners, 
who hail from the city of Colima in Mexico, are homesick for sun-soaked Colima. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe you could call that atmosphere, if you have a generous spirit. Basically, 
though, Colima is your elemental storefront restaurant, perhaps a little 
roomier than most but with no embellishments. We are talking plain. Not even 
one bullfight poster. 
</P>
<P>
But who cares? These people can really cook; the whole family, it seems, can 
cook. Lupe Valencia, the mother, makes wonderful corn tortillas by hand, and 
also some of the appetizers and several of the desserts. Her sons, who wait the 
tables, also prepare the seafood. 
</P>
<P>
Wonderful tortillas make for wonderful tortilla chips and you get a basket of 
hot, fresh ones the minute you are seated. The chips come with an equally 
irresistible salsa, the dark, smoky kind, and pico de gallo, a condiment of 
finely minced onion, tomato, chiles and cilantro. Eat all you want, as the 
commercial says. They'll make more. 
</P>
<P>
Don't make the mistake of starting with nachos unless you come with a large 
group. "Nachitos," said the waiter, which literally means "little nachos." But 
he put down a monstrous platter of them, a mountain of corn chips with beans 
and two kinds of Mexican cheese, topped with sour cream and green chili. 
</P>
<P>
I admired his sly sense of humor, but I was barely able to eat a corner of the 
dish. Six people, conservatively, would have a hard time with it. 
</P>
<P>
There are several caldos (soups), such as siete mares (seven seas), a briny 
broth with a combination of seafoods (shrimp, snapper, and octopus), and a 
couple of seafood cocteles based on shrimp, oyster or abalone. These dishes are 
perfectly fine but not what the restaurant does best. 
</P>
<P>
What you want to come here for is fish, which the restaurant buys fresh several 
times a week. 
</P>
<P>
Snapper offers the largest number of cooking options: a la plancha (grilled), 
empanizado (breaded), al mojo (fried with garlic), a la diabla (smothered in 
chili sauce), a la Veracruzana (with tomato sauce) and ranchera (baked with a 
spicy sauce containing tomatoes and onions). I had the snapper empanizado, and 
it was nearly perfect, firm-fleshed with crusty breading. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant also has fresh mojarra (perch) and vagre (catfish), but for some 
reason never cooks them any way but by deep-frying. You can have them sauced al 
mojo, a la diabla, or ranchera, but that only makes for different toppings. 
When fish are fresh, I'd say frying is the last way they should be cooked. Why 
couldn't they be grilled? 
</P>
<P>
But I must admit that as fried fish they are terrific. The catfish is huge, 
bigger than the vaunted catfish at Laguna Beach's Five Feet restaurant (and 
about one-third the price), and as sweet-fleshed as can be. We had ours a la 
diabla, and it came standing up straight on the dish, looking crisp and ready 
for action. There were three of us, and when the smoke cleared away, plenty of 
the fish remained. 
</P>
<P>
The perch is not as big or sweet, but it fries up so crunchy you can actually 
eat the smaller bones, which is exactly what they do in Mexico. This fish makes 
for great tacos with mama Lupe's handmade tortillas. Smear them with salsa and 
you have a world-class treat, to be washed down with a Bohemia or a Dos Equis, 
perhaps, or another of the imported beers the restaurant carries. 
</P>
<P>
There are also some shrimp and lobster dishes, grilled and given the same 
sauces as the fried fish. 
</P>
<P>
Should you hanker for non-seafood items, there is no shortage of them on this 
menu. Tacos are made from tongue as well as chicken. There is a fine chile 
verde made with chunked pork. The chiles rellenos, pan-fried breaded chiles 
stuffed with cheese and topped with sour cream sauce, are the richest I've ever 
had. 
</P>
<P>
All main dishes come with good beans, dry but tasty rice and a bizarre salad 
made from shredded carrot and chunks of pineapple. (How'd that get in there?) 
</P>
<P>
For dessert, you could have a dense, semi-sweet flan, but the one that knocked 
me out was the Mexican eggnog called rompope. Mama Lupe uses 100-proof rum, egg 
yolk, heavy cream and spices to make one of the most devastating eggnogs 
anywhere. It is served in a four-ounce glass and I'll bet you can't finish 
half. I couldn't. In fact, there is usually far too much to eat at Colima. 
</P>
<P>
Colima is inexpensive. Appetizers are $1.50 to $3.95. Seafood cocktails are $6 
to $8.75. Filets (snapper) are $8.50. Vagre (catfish) is $9.50. Mojarra (perch) 
is $8.95. Shrimp dishes are $8.95. Lobster is $16.50.

It was going to be the power ball of power balls, an Orange County gala so 
chock-full of political connections that it would be the envy of every charity 
committee outside the White House. Until very recently, there was reason to 
think that President Bush and his popular First Lady might be the guests of 
honor at Saturday night's Orangewood Ball. 
</P>
<P>
But the hopes of ball organizers were dashed when the call came from 
Washington: thank you very much, but no thank you. One insider chalks up the 
disappointment to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's recent visit: "President 
Bush is just too busy." 
</P>
<P>
Why would a local ball committee send an invitation to the President of the 
United States? Give yourself 200 Social I.Q. points if you know the answer: a 
few Orangewood activists -- William Lyon, Kathryn Thompson, George Argyros -- 
are members of Team 100, donors of $100,000 to Bush's presidential campaign. In 
fact, when Kathryn Thompson and her husband, Gus Owen, dined with the First 
Couple at the White House last year, Mrs. Bush remembered the tour of 
Orangewood that Thompson gave her in 1988. 
</P>

The good news is that the gala will raise more than $1 million, making it 
Orange County's biggest single fund-raiser ever. How does one little ole soiree 
rake in so many smackers? Simple. Forbes 400 developer William Lyon is at the 
helm (ably assisted by developer and good friend Kathryn Thompson). Not only 
have Lyon and his wife, Willa Dean, inspired commitment by tossing an 
underwriting bash that pulled in $300,000 (more than enough to pay for ball 
costs), they also plan to ante up $250,000 out of their own pockets. Ditto 
developer Peter Ochs, president of the Fieldstone Co. And something new has 
been added to everybody's favorite spring gala: a Gold Circle consisting of 
donors of $25,000 or more. So far, 13 Orangewood supporters -- Tommy Tucker, 
Glen Stillwell, Leo Cook and Marvin Weiss among them -- have joined those 
ranks. Add 750 guests who have paid $300 each and you've got a gala that's 
sitting on a powder keg of record-breaking dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Festivities, themed "A New Beginning," begin at the Irvine Hilton with a 
pool-side reception followed by dinner in a room hung with silk butterflies. 
Dinner will include something tres nouvelle: caviar asparagus frappe served in 
a martini glass. Dessert will be to die for: a hazelnut ladyfinger charlotte 
topped with a chocolate filigree butterfly.

Speaking of Gorby: Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin and wife Lois were in the 
Soviet Union 10 days ago as guests of H.R. Haldeman. Seems Haldeman is working 
with a couple of local businessmen to bring Moscow a thoroughly modern 
business-hotel complex. As such, he was invited to attend a meeting of the 
World Trade Council and he invited the Aldrins to come along. A few days into 
the trip, the Aldrins found themselves at a party with about 500 guests, 
including Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. Mindful of his hero status, and 
always gracious, Aldrin thoughtfully handed Gorbachev a picture postcard of 
himself in his spacesuit. Gorbachev whipped out a pen, signed the card, and 
handed it back to Aldrin. "He thought Buzz wanted his autograph!" Lois said 
this week. "Isn't that a scream?"

Catching up with the Segerstrom salute: There are 50 seats still available for 
the tribute that will mark a decade of involvement in the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center by philanthropist Henry Segerstrom. Set for June 22 at 
the Center, the $500-per-person gala has received "oui-oui" replies from 250 
Center supporters. The elegant ivory invitations, which arrived two weeks ago, 
feature the Center's famed Firebird metal sculpture in embossed splashes of 
gold and bronze. 
</P>
<P>
The party -- which Center President Thomas Kendrick describes as "simple, 
elegant and classy, a party to embrace the Center family" -- will have a 
Firebird theme and begin with a reception in the Center's backstage area. 
Dinner will be served on stage in Segerstrom Hall, where guests will dine on 
fare whipped up by the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel. On the tentative menu: a 
main course of lobster-stuffed veal chop. Decor? A huge screen will provide the 
backdrop. During the festivities, the screen will be used to present a video 
tribute to Segerstrom as well as project a blazing image of the Firebird. After 
dinner, pianist Michael Feinstein will play for guests. The Segerstrom family 
plans to attend, en masse, as does the entire Center board.

Chanel of New York in town: Who could miss the bevy of beauties dining at the 
Emperor's Fortune restaurant in Santa Ana on Wednesday? None of the elegant 
eatery's lunch crowd. Having a bite of gourmet Chinese while discussing plans 
for the Opera Pacific gala that will open South Coast Plaza's new Chanel 
boutique this fall were Barbara Cirkva and Arlette Thebault of Chanel, New 
York; Jeanette Segerstrom, a member of the Opera Pacific board, and gala 
co-chairwomen Donna Bunce and Gayle Anderson.

MACY AWARDS HONOR TEENS' STAGE EFFORTS

The Tony awards honoring Broadway's best weren't the only prizes presented 
Sunday night for achievement in the theater. At South Coast Community Church in 
Irvine that night, MACY awards went to Southland high school students for 
excellence in the musical productions. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 people showed up for 20th annual ceremony for the awards, 
formally known as Music and Art Commendation for Youth. In all, 150 trophies 
and scholarships were presented, for overall production and for individual 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine High School was the biggest winner, receiving its accolades for a 
production of "Little Shop of Horrors." Among the prizes was the night's most 
prestigious award, for best overall production. 
</P>
<P>
Other schools recognized for best overall production were Newport Harbor High 
School in Newport Beach for "Man of La Mancha" and Rancho Buena Vista High 
School in Vista for "Fiddler on the Roof." 
</P>
<P>
The award program was begun 20 years ago by Corona del Mar residents Lee and 
John Childress. 
</P>
<P>
"We started this program to give recognition to all this wonderful talent," 
said Lee Childress, a former actress and publicist. "This is our gift to the 
youths who devote all of their time and energy to these musicals." 
</P>
<P>
John Childress, a former school administrator, calls the MACYs a "labor of 
love." The couple spent more than $5,000 producing this year's show. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights of student productions of such popular musicals as "Grease," "Guys 
and Dolls," "The Wiz" and "Annie" were performed during the show. 
</P>
<P>

HANDBAGS ACHIEVE STAR STATUS; 
</P>
<P>
OFFER FEAST OF COLOR, TEXTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

In simpler times, women's handbags were demure accessories relegated to the 
back benches of fashion where they were governed by two simple rules. One, 
handbag and shoes had to match. Two, summer handbags were white. 
</P>
<P>
"Those days are gone, gone, gone," says Debbie Bohnett, spokeswoman for Neiman 
Marcus in Fashion Island. 
</P>
<P>
Judging by this year's summer collection, the humble handbag has finally 
evolved from fashion afterthought to fashion statement. Flamboyant and 
innovative designers such as Sharif and Carlos Falchi have transformed the 
timid clutch into a movable feast of color, texture and shape. 
</P>
<P>
This summer's handbag message: the more attention-grabbing the better. 
</P>
<P>
Shapes run the gamut from oversized totes and circular draw-strings to slouchy 
hoboes and barrel shapes. Textures are even more varied. Lacquered straws, 
pearlized metallics and boldly striped canvas are touted as this season's 
newest looks. 
</P>
<P>
But it is leather -- woven, gathered, wrinkled, appliqued, fringed, tasseled 
and layered -- that is the star of what has been dubbed the season of the 
"multimedia" handbag. Combinations of buffalo leather, whip snake, anaconda, 
python and faux alligator dominate the season's accent on texture. 
</P>
<P>
Italian designer Braccialina has created a singular line of soft casual totes 
in canvas and leathers in rich earth and spice tones. The bags, priced in the 
$300 range, are trimmed and fringed in leather and decorated with hand-sewn 
charms, antique coins and colored beads. Furla has also chosen burnished browns 
as the signature color of their summer bags, which are invariably trimmed with 
lush-looking mock crocodile. 
</P>
<P>
White, the much maligned classic mainstay of summer, is once again a favorite 
with designers who have revamped its staid image. Carlos Falchi uses white as a 
background for his lively appliques of both gold and bright color. Other 
designers have fringed, woven, gathered and wrinkled their white handbags and 
then studded them with diamantes, sequins and multiple textures of snake over 
suede over kid. 
</P>
<P>
The season's dominating colors, however, are the brights -- lots of them. Both 
Falchi and Sharif have created lines of multicolored handbags in the $300 
neighborhood that are literally mini-media events. Yellows, and orange, jade 
greens and blood reds, turquoise and purple are combined in "theme" handbags 
that sport everything from tropical fruit designs to nautical motifs to 
abstract creations of color upon color, shape upon shape. 
</P>
<P>
Sharif has also combined hot pink, lavender, orange, saffron, red and turquoise 
into an exotic line of Arabian-themed handbags that are detailed in gold and 
set off with jewelled tassels. 
</P>
<P>
So intricate, so dominating and so singular is the impact of one of these 
multimedia handbags that they themselves are fast becoming the fashion 
statement around which women build their wardrobes. They choose solid-color 
outfits -- often black or white, or one of the dominant colors from the handbag 
-- which will showcase the handbag rather than compete with it. 
</P>
<P>
"Buying a handbag is a very different purchasing concept from what it was 10 
years ago," Bohnett says. Gone are the days when a woman would buy one handbag 
at the beginning of the season to go with all her outfits. Now she is more 
likely to consider a handbag as an accent item and buy two or three on a whim . 
. . which is why most handbag sections are adjacent to jewelry and scarf 
offerings in department stores. 
</P>
<P>
For those women schooled in the old ways, however, there is still one nagging 
question -- what shoes could possibly go with this season's multicolored, 
multitextured handbags? Bohnett suggests selecting one color from the handbag 
for a solid-colored shoe that will complement the colors in their summer 
wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes just that one solid color will make it work and pull it all 
together," she says.

SINGLE LIFE: WAKING UP TO THE REALITY OF 'DREAM LOVERS': THERE REALLY AREN'T 
ANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVAN CUMMINGS, Evan Cummings is a regular contributor to Orange County Life.

<TEXT>
<P>
He is the very essence of manhood. The perfect mate. Your dream lover. But 
wait. There's more to him than meets the eye. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Judy Kuriansky, a prominent New York psychologist and adjunct professor at 
New York University, says there are four types of dream lovers: 
</P>
<P>
The Mystery Man. The Intellectual. The Powermonger. And the Operator. 
</P>
<P>
"These men are figments of a woman's imagination," explains the author of "How 
to Love a Nice Guy." 
</P>
<P>
"He seems to embody all the qualities you are seeking; he can fix it, take care 
of you, stimulate you." 
</P>
<P>
But he is, alas, an illusion. 
</P>
<P>
"Landing a dream guy doesn't mean your dreams will come true," Kuriansky warns. 
He will appear to be perfect at first, she says, but when it comes to meeting 
your real -- not fantasized -- romantic needs, he will invariably be lacking. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mystery Man" works fast, is charming, a good conversationalist, intense, 
even hypnotic. Start talking about skiing and before you can say "stem turn" he 
has invited you for a weekend in Aspen. 
</P>
<P>
It feels good being enveloped by him -- at first. But as soon as you are 
dreaming of white picket fences, his interest wanes. 
</P>
<P>
"This man is easily distracted," Kuriansky says. "Often a woman will invent 
complex fantasies about what might be bothering him -- work pressures, ex-wife 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
Dates become less frequent, then he stops calling. When exasperated, you break 
down and call him, hoping for an explanation. But you get his answering machine 
instead. Or worse, a disconnected number. 
</P>
<P>
"The Intellectual" often attracts a woman who secretly believes she isn't very 
smart. "He has a kind of rumpled, academic sexiness, but is self-absorbed and 
noncommunicative and frequently treats a woman as if she isn't there." 
</P>
<P>
"The Powermonger" wants control of your life. He finds a perfect foil in the 
woman who is weary of pulling in the reins on her life. "He puts her at ease 
immediately," Kuriansky says. "He's reassuring, he takes the lead. Soon he's 
not only helping her with her problem, he's choreographing her fashion 
choices." 
</P>
<P>
"The Operator" gives a woman the chance to feel powerful. "He is a leech, a 
gigolo, a hanger-on," the psychologist says. He is often charming and on the 
verge of "making it big." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he borrows your Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
"Dreams offer enticing visions of not only what we want in someone else but of 
who we, often unconsciously, want to be," Kuriansky contends. "As you head 
toward a new vision of yourself, you gain a clearer sense of the man you'll be 
happy with."

12 GARMENTS TURN SUITCASE INTO FASHION BAG OF TRICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like Felix and his bag of magic tricks, D.N. Evans can pull enough outfits out 
of a small carry-on suitcase to take her around the world in style. 
</P>
<P>
It's a system the Laguna Beach-based fashion designer has been perfecting for 
years, one refined during the course of her and her husband/partner Michael's 
many global wanderings. 
</P>
<P>
Her bag contains just 12 garments, but all of them mix and match in endless 
combinations so she can go weeks and never wear the same ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
For many travelers, packing for a vacation means trying to squeeze the entire 
contents of their closet into a suitcase that ends up weighing 300 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Women in particular have a tendency to bring their entire wardrobe with them," 
Evans says. "They have a real need to condense. Nobody wants to be bogged down 
with things." 
</P>
<P>
Evans' "basic survival wardrobe" is proof that one can live out of just one 
carry-on bag. 
</P>
<P>
The wardrobe consists of separates built on a color scheme such as black, white 
and red. Each garment is made from a washable fabric (usually a silky polyester 
blend) that won't wrinkle, even when bunched in a ball at the bottom of a 
suitcase. 
</P>
<P>
A typical survival collection includes 12 easy pieces, such as: a black tank 
top; roomy black Italian pants or split skirt; a red Eisenhower jacket; a 
straight red skirt; a reversible cardigan with black and white checks and black 
piping on one side and solid black fabric on the other; black-and-white checked 
pleated pants; a red Chanel blouse with long sleeves and a jewel neckline; a 
ribbed cotton knit T-top in black with red piping; and a black pocket T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
"They're three outfits that make into 12," she says. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the tank can be worn with the Italian pants and shawl for evening 
or the checked pants and cardigan for a casual day outing. The red blouse can 
go with the red skirt or the checked pants, and on and on. 
</P>
<P>
"It works without being repetitious," Evans says. 
</P>
<P>
She also manages to squeeze in a reversible all-weather coat with a nylon 
lining that offers protection from the rain. The coat folds into a small 
bundle. 
</P>
<P>
"You could probably make a lifeboat out of it," Michael jokes. 
</P>
<P>
For function as well as fashion, she packs a beret that keeps her head warm and 
a shawl that can be used as a beach cover-up, a blanket on the plane, a head 
covering, an accent piece, a strapless top or sarong skirt. 
</P>
<P>
The wardrobe comes in 12 different color schemes and starts at $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
"This will take you three months around the world in every single climate," 
Evans says. "Just add a wonderful bathing suit, a pair of flat shoes, some 
lightweight boots and lovely heels." 
</P>
<P>
Her survival wardrobe for men contains just six pieces -- two pairs of pants, 
two T-shirts, a two-pocket shirt and a safari jacket. The safari jacket is both 
handy and handsome, with a variety of pockets and hidden pouches for carrying 
airplane tickets and a wallet. 
</P>
<P>
"It really bothers us when we see people wearing jogging outfits in the 
airport," Michael says. "So we try to offer choices." 
</P>
<P>
Those who can't afford a new survival wardrobe can assemble their own using 
clothes they already own. 
</P>
<P>
"Travel clothes are no different from regular clothes," says Doris Fuqua, 
coordinator of Fullerton College's fashion design program, who has led students 
on numerous trips across the country and abroad. She offers this advice for all 
travelers: 
</P>
<P>
"Pick out all of the clothes you'll take on the trip, lay them on the bed, and 
then put half of them back in your closet. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my students come overprepared," she says. Despite her warnings, one 
young woman insisted on carting her hot rollers, curling iron and blow-dryer to 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"She was sorry she did it," Fuqua says. 
</P>
<P>
For a trip of three weeks, she suggests packing five days' worth of clothes -- 
five tops and five bottoms to mix and match. A simple skirt can go from day to 
night by switching from a T-shirt to a sheer blouse that takes less room in a 
suitcase than a bulky dress, Fuqua says. 
</P>
<P>
"Pick clothes made of polyester -- it doesn't wrinkle and it's easy to wash 
out." 
</P>
<P>
When visiting a humid climate, bring cotton clothes that can breathe. 
</P>
<P>
"I pick things that already come wrinkled," Fuqua says. The washable silks now 
in style make ideal travel companions. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of dragging around a heavy coat, choose a lightweight nylon one, then 
wear layered clothing underneath. In Germany, Fuqua found a raincoat made of 
nylon that folded up into a 4-by-4-inch package she could carry in her purse. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't get you through a monsoon, but it's invaluable." 
</P>
<P>
Many travelers get bogged down in all of the beauty aids they consider 
necessary to existence. 
</P>
<P>
"My students take the whole bathroom with them," Fuqua says. "Maybe in the 
wilds of New Guinea they'll need that big can of hair spray, but in New York 
City you can go out and buy one." 
</P>
<P>
She suggests buying travel-size shampoos, toothpastes and other toiletries, and 
leaving cumbersome curling irons and blow-dryers at home. They don't work 
without plug adapters and a converter to adjust to the different electrical 
currents in Europe anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen a curling iron melt," Fuqua says. "If you must have one, buy a cheap 
one when you get there." 
</P>
<P>
Better yet, she says, get a perm so you don't have to fuss with your hair. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter how you look, unless you're calling on the queen of 
England," Fuqua says. 
</P>
<P>
If you can't stuff everything in a carry-on, make sure you have the bare 
necessities to get you through a few days in case your big luggage gets 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
When packing, put heavy items on the bottom of the suitcase, suggests Fuqua, 
otherwise the bags tip over too easily. Wrap pants and skirts around layers of 
clothing so they don't fold over on themselves and leave creases. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying expensive luggage makes one a target for thieves, according to Evans. 
She favors casual nylon totes over expensive needlepoint luggage. 
</P>
<P>
"The pros know which luggage costs a lot of money," she says. "It's best to be 
invisible in an airport. Then you're not a target." 
</P>
<P>
For the same reason, avoid wearing fine jewelry or fancy clothes. 
</P>
<P>
When you travel, don't look like a tourist. 
</P>
<P>
"Leave the loud Hawaiian shirts at home," Fuqua says, "unless you're going to 
Hawaii."

FIRM WINS $1.5 MILLION IN CORPORATE SABOTAGE CASE; 
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: A LOCAL PRINTING SUPPLY COMPANY CLAIMED THAT A NEW JERSEY FIRM USED 
UNFAIR TACTICS TO DRAW ITS MAJOR CLIENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court jury Thursday ruled that a New Jersey company 
sabotaged the business operations of a local printing supplies firm. The jury 
awarded the local company more than $1.5 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict upheld a claim by American Technical Supply of Los Angeles, which 
sued Harold M. Pitman Co. of Secaucus, N.J., for unfair competition and 
deception. Both companies provide publishers with graphic arts supplies and 
with film and plates used in the printing process. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-member jury heard Pitman and American Technical accuse each other of 
competing unfairly for the business of a client they once served simultaneously 
-- Treasure Chest Advertising Co., a Glendora-based publisher of newspaper 
advertising inserts. 
</P>
<P>
American Technical said in its complaint that it started supplying Treasure 
Chest's West Coast operations in 1978, and Treasure Chest became its largest 
customer, generating $5 million worth of business a year. In 1981, American 
Technical helped Pitman become Treasure Chest's East Coast supplier. The two 
suppliers split the business geographically, the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
However, with the help of an American Technical employee -- Virginia Moore -- 
Pitman began to disrupt American Technical's relationship with Treasure Chest, 
finally causing Treasure Chest to drop American Technical as a supplier, the 
suit said. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, an account representative responsible for keeping Treasure Chest 
adequately stocked with American Technical supplies, purposely allowed the 
supply levels to dwindle on occasions in 1984 and 1985, according to the 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
American Technical's attorney, Allan Browne, told the jury that Moore was a 
disgruntled employee who tried to hurt her employer. He said Moore falsely told 
Treasure Chest that American Technical had not been a cooperative supplier and 
had difficulties meeting stock orders. Browne said Moore also helped Pitman set 
up operations in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Treasure Chest ended its relationship with American Technical Aug. 31, 1985 -- 
the same day Moore resigned to join Pitman, the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
Pitman failed to act in good faith and dealt with American Technical unfairly, 
the jury verdict said. American Technical had sought $3 million in damages but 
the jury awarded the firm $1,534,100. Pitman executives were not immediately 
available for comment.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: HOW UPSTART FIRM CAN OUTSMART A GIANT

<P>
The fact that more people around the world use toothbrushes than any other 
consumer product inspired the founders of Healthgard to develop a new 
toothbrush-sanitizing solution. 
</P>
<P>
But because they couldn't compete head-on with the giants of the oral hygiene 
market, they started selling Brushgard in health food stores. Brushgard, a 
stable form of hydrogen peroxide, comes in a bottle that acts as a toothbrush 
holder. Each bottle lasts for about 10 days and costs $1.39. 
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs competing nose-to-nose against the Goliaths in their industries 
say the only way to succeed is to figure out an innovative way to sell your 
product. Since you can't outspend a big corporation, you have to outsmart it. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood-based Healthgard and Pro-Dentec of Batesville, Ark., share the 
personal products arena with Colgate-Palmolive, Procter &amp; Gamble and Bausch 
&amp; Lomb. You won't see ads for Brushgard on television or in magazines. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for the path of least resistance," Jim Grant, Healthgard's 
marketing director and an officer of the company, said of the decision to sell 
Brushgard in 1,800 health-food stores. 
</P>
<P>
He originally planned to introduce Brushgard to hotel guests concerned about 
bathroom cleanliness. He changed his mind when he met a woman who worked for a 
natural food chain. She thought Brushgard's sales pitch -- "Fact: Toothbrush 
bacteria can make you sick!" -- might appeal to health-conscious shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the strategy is working. Managers at several health food stores said 
customer interest in Brushgard is growing and sales are picking up. 
</P>
<P>
Healthgard Chairman Allen Gelbard said a group of his friends dared each other 
to come up with the most lucrative consumer product. Seeking guidance from a 
computer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Gelbard discovered that 
the toothbrush was the most universal consumer item. 
</P>
<P>
"Toothbrushes cross over all ethnic barriers," said Gelbard, who previously 
produced movies and worked in the telecommunications business. 
</P>
<P>
Since the toothbrush and toothpaste market was glutted, he worked with dental 
researchers to create a related product. 
</P>
<P>
To raise capital, Healthgard recently merged with a public company called 
American Water Resources. The move brought in about $1 million cash. 
</P>
<P>
While Healthgard is busy cleaning toothbrushes, Pro-Dentec is busy cleaning 
teeth with Rota-dent, a device that uses a variety of circular brushes to do 
its job. Pro-Dentec also came up with a creative marketing solution. The 
company decided to sell Rota-dents directly to dentists after realizing that 
dental product distributors, which push 2,200 products, could not aggressively 
sell their line. But selling directly to dentists is not easy. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is, most dentists think it's unprofessional to sell things out of 
their office," said Bill Evans, Pro-Dentec's executive vice president and 
marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
To gain credibility in the dental community, Pro-Dentec sponsors about 100 
continuing education seminars for dentists and dental hygienists around the 
country each year. 
</P>
<P>
"We are selling Rota-dents to one dentist at a time," said Evans. Evans said 
dentists, who used to spend most of their time filling cavities, are now 
focusing on helping patients keep their teeth and gums healthy. The change in 
direction is a result of widespread use of fluoride treatment -- a development 
that has nearly eliminated cavities. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-Dentec brought Rota-dent to the United States six years ago under a 
licensing agreement with a Danish company. Dentists charge $90 to $125 for the 
sleek, hand-held cleaner. The cost includes at least one lesson on how to use 
the device. 
</P>
<P>
Rota-dent's closest competitor is the Interplak tooth cleaner, which was 
acquired by Bausch &amp; Lomb in 1988 and is sold through a variety of retail 
outlets. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Evans said, the Copenhagen-made Rota-dents experienced terrible 
quality control problems. To solve the problem, Pro-Dentec acquired the 
manufacturing rights and moved the factory to Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
So far, about a million Rota-dents have been sold worldwide, 800,000 in the 
United States. Pro-Dentec, which has about 150 employees, posted sales of $6.9 
million for the first six months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Each week, the company sends out thousands of brochures to dentists. Its sales 
team is on the phone to dentists every day. If dentists express interest in the 
product, they are sent audiotapes or videotapes produced in the company's 
in-house studios. 
</P>
<P>
Evans recommends that small-business owners develop their own marketing plan 
before hiring an advertising agency. 
</P>
<P>
"Save your money until you figure out how to sell it first," said Evans, who 
laughs when he recalls the first time he pitched the Rota-dent to dentists. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing that a group of dentists were attending a charity golf tournament at 
the Lake of the Ozarks Country Club, he and a colleague raced out to the golf 
course. "I sold 200 toothbrushes from a golf cart that day," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

JUDGE OKS QUADRIPLEGIC'S PLEA TO BE ALLOWED TO DIE

A Nevada judge today granted the death wish of a quadriplegic who asked to be 
removed from a respirator that has sustained his life for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth A. Bergstedt, 31, said he no longer enjoys life and wants to die in 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
He asked the court to allow him to take a sedative and have his life-support 
system turned off. 
</P>
<P>
Bergstedt sought a legal ruling that his actions would not constitute suicide 
or a crime and that people who helped him would not be subject to prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
The case is believed to be the first of its kind to hit Nevada's courts and is 
only one of a handful of others documented in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
After an evidentiary hearing that lasted about an hour, state District Judge 
Donald Mosley found that Bergstedt was mentally competent to make the decision 
to end his life. The judge also ruled that the elements of homicide and suicide 
were not factors in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"The prognosis is less than encouraging, and there is no real likelihood that 
life will improve for Mr. Bergstedt," Mosley said in issuing the ruling.

MAN KILLS HIS WIFE'S STEPBROTHER TRYING TO BREAK INTO THEIR HOME

A South County homeowner shot and killed his wife's stepbrother early this 
morning while the man reportedly was attempting to break into the family's 
Torino Street home, despite a court order to stay away from the family. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred LeBrun, 25, was killed almost instantly by a single shotgun shot in his 
chest, fired point-blank by Jeffrey S. Alix, 33, who was awakened in the middle 
of the night by what he told police sounded like a prowler. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel numb," Jeffrey Alix said today as stood in the living room of his 
one-story, single-family home at the end of a cul-de-sac. "I can't believe it 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
The 1:58 a.m. shooting occurred when Alix, who had just gone to bed shortly 
after returning from work, heard the front door rattling, Sheriff's Department 
spokesman Lt. Richard J. Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
"(Alix) goes out in the front room, and at that point, he hears a gate at the 
side of the house being opened," Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Alix then grabbed his 12-gauge shotgun and walked out of the house. As he 
passed through the gate and into the darkened back yard of his home, Olson 
said, he saw a silhouette of a man he said was trying to break through the 
glass door. 
</P>
<P>
Alix screamed, Olson said, and when the unidentified man turned and apparently 
lunged at him, Alix fired once. 
</P>
<P>
Alix's wife, Lynn, 31, came running outside, and when she flipped on a light 
switch, the couple discovered that the shooting victim was her stepbrother. 
</P>
<P>
LeBrun, described in court documents and neighbors as extremely violent, had 
been under a restraining order to stay away from the couple, their two children 
and Lynn Alix's father, Charles Audet.

BOARD ADVISES DISMISSAL OF OFFICER INVOLVED IN BRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles police board has recommended the firing of a patrol sergeant who 
was involved in a bar brawl in Burbank last year during which he and several 
other off-duty officers fought with patrons and employees, authorities said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
A six-day Board of Rights hearing ended Thursday with Sgt. Christopher Bonilla, 
32, being found guilty of three counts of misconduct, Cmdr. William Booth said. 
The board recommended to Chief Daryl F. Gates that Bonilla be fired. 
</P>
<P>
A Board of Rights hearing is similar to a court trial but is presided over by a 
panel of three high-ranking police officers. Gates is expected to act on the 
recommendation next week. 
</P>
<P>
The disciplinary action stems from a fight that broke out May 10, 1989, in the 
bar of the Black Angus restaurant at 235 S. 1st St. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank police said the brawl started after a patron, Robert Martinez, 29, of 
Burbank, walked by a table where six off-duty officers were sitting and knocked 
over a bottle of beer. A shouting match followed, and the officers began 
fighting with Martinez. Police said two cocktail waitresses, two bouncers and a 
bartender joined in. 
</P>
<P>
During the fight, Martinez was allegedly dragged outside by the officers and 
kicked while on the ground, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the officers, Bonilla, Oscar Jiminez and Arthur Placentia, later 
pleaded guilty to disturbing the peace in February and were fined $470 each. 
Bonilla, who was originally charged with battery, was also placed on three 
years probation. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez was originally charged with assault, but the charge was dropped 
because prosecutors believed that he could prove he acted in self-defense. None 
of the bar employees were charged with any crime. 
</P>
<P>
The five officers who were with Bonilla were disciplined by the Los Angeles 
police, but the department declined to reveal what actions were taken because 
they did not involve Board of Rights hearings, reserved for the most serious 
departmental charges. All of the officers involved in the fight are assigned to 
the Wilshire Division. 
</P>
<P>
Bonilla, who was relieved of duty without pay, was charged with three counts of 
misconduct because an internal affairs investigation found that he had been 
drinking and made threats during the incident, and had kicked Martinez while he 
was lying in the parking lot outside the restaurant.

Teen-agers are less healthy than their parents were at the same age due to 
increases in alcohol and drug abuse, violence and sexually transmitted 
diseases, a blue-ribbon panel said today. 
</P>
<P>
The National Commission on the Role of the School and the Community in 
Improving Adolescent Health recommended that teen-age health clinics be set up 
in every community with services available to all, regardless of ability to 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
It also said there is an urgent need for schools to offer better health 
services and health classes. 
</P>
<P>
"Never before has one generation of American teen-agers been less healthy, less 
cared for, or less prepared for life than their parents were at the same age," 
the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
"The state of adolescent health in America constitutes a national emergency. 
Adolescents in every neighborhood are displaying serious health problems," it 
said.

South African black nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela, whose grueling world 
tour is giving rise to concern for his health, said today he is fine but that 
he might have to cut his schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day Mandela, who is set to visit the United States June 20, 
abruptly canceled an appointment with officials of the International Committee 
of the Red Cross for an unscheduled rest in his hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how I look but I feel good," the 71-year-old activist told 
reporters as he arrived at the headquarters of the World Council of Churches 
later to thank its members for their militant anti-apartheid stand. 
</P>
<P>
But he admitted he might have to cut down on his heavy schedule, which is to 
cover 13 countries in six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"That is likely, quite possible, but it is different from saying I have done so 
because I am ill," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela had surgery of an unspecified nature only last week.

SHAMIR GETS RIGHT-WING GOVERNMENT;

<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir formed the most right-wing government in Israeli 
history today and said its top priority would be Jewish immigration from the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
After protracted last-minute wrangling, seven extreme right-wing and religious 
parties and three independent parliamentarians signed a coalition agreement. 
</P>
<P>
It came 12 weeks after the dovish Labor Party brought down a national unity 
government over Shamir's refusal to accept U.S. proposals for 
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
The new government, backed by 62 members of the 120-seat Parliament, will seek 
a vote of confidence Monday. 
</P>
<P>
An exhausted-looking Shamir, 74, toasted his new coalition as "a national 
government that will conduct affairs of state during a tough period with many 
dangers." 
</P>
<P>
"The government's main effort will be on the most important matter in our lives 
today -- the mass immigration flowing into the country and the absorption" of 
immigrants, he declared. 
</P>
<P>
Israel expects up to 250,000 Soviet Jews to arrive this year and Jewish agency 
officials disclosed this week that about 1.1 million Soviet Jews had received 
immigration visas. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet will be dominated by opponents of peace talks with the Palestinians 
and advocates of increased Jewish settlement in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Political commentators said it could set Israel on a collision course with the 
United States, its guardian ally. 
</P>
<P>
"Barring a miracle, Shamir will find himself in direct conflict with the United 
States, the Soviet Union, Europe, the Palestinians and the Arab world," 
diplomatic commentator Akiva Eldar wrote in the Haaretz newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition's policy guidelines said the new government would work to 
"strengthen, expand and develop" Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank 
and Gaza Strip, the biggest source of friction between Israel and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Settlement in all parts of the land of Israel is the right of the Jewish 
people and an inseparable part of national security," the document said.

Bush, speaking with reporters while on a Midwestern political trip, was asked 
about a report in The Washington Times that the Administration has decided to 
break off its 16-month dialogue with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not prepared to make an announcement on policy at this point," Bush said. 
However, he said, "our dialogue is predicated on a renunciation of terror. In 
my view, this is sheer terror." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking separately at a NATO conference, Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
said the Administration is seeking more information on the raid. 
</P>
<P>
He said a decision on the U.S.-PLO talks would be made "when we are satisfied 
we know all we need to know." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he'd like to see PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat "speak out . . . . I've 
expressed my outrage about the attack. Maybe I can take this opportunity to 
express my outrage about all the violence in the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he is planning to cut off the U.S.-PLO dialogue, Bush said, "We are 
discussing all of that. No decision has been made." 
</P>
<P>
Arafat has denied any PLO involvement in last month's raid but has not 
condemned the act outright. 
</P>
<P>
The Palestine Liberation Front, a PLO faction, claimed responsibility for the 
raid, in which six speedboats attempted to attack a crowded beach but were 
intercepted by Israeli security forces. The Iraq-based PLF is headed by Abul 
(Mohammed) Abbas, who masterminded the Achille Lauro cruise ship hijacking. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, an Administration official said a decision is not expected for a 
number of days. The official, who declined to be identified, said the United 
States has held at least four meetings with PLO representatives since the raid 
to discuss the organization's views on it.

The Office of Thrift Supervision said today that it has placed Hometown Federal 
Savings Bank, of Delphi, Ind., and Home Federal Savings Bank, of Worcester, 
Mass., under government control. 
</P>
<P>
Neither action will interrupt services at the thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
The Indiana thrift, found to be tangibly insolvent, had assets of about $68.6 
million and $57.7 million in deposit accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The Massachusetts institution reported assets of about $235.5 million with 
$240.8 million in deposit accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The Resolution Trust Corp. was appointed receiver for both institutions. New 
federal mutual savings associations will take the place of the troubled 
thrifts.

Producers at Australia's largest gold mine, hurting from low gold prices, cut 
jobs and closed down some high-cost underground operations today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a reflection of the difficult times we're in," said gold stock analyst 
Howard Walker at broker J B Were. 
</P>
<P>
"There will probably be more suspended or closed over the next few months." 
</P>
<P>
Joint venture partners Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie Ltd. and Homestake Gold of 
Australia Ltd. said cash costs of production at their Fimiston underground 
mines were running at more than $385 an ounce. That compares with current gold 
prices at around $353 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie and Homestake, an 80% owned subsidiary of U.S. 
producer Homestake Mining Co., jointly own the huge "super pit" and five 
underground mines in Western Australia's Golden Mile area at Kalgoorlie. 
</P>
<P>
The price of gold is down almost $60 from December levels, and many analysts 
believe there is little chance of a recovery for the next six months.

McDonald's Corp. said today it will post complete nutritional information -- 
including fat and sodium levels -- on all of its products at its restaurants by 
the end of July. 
</P>
<P>
"The more (customers) know about McDonald's food, . . . the easier it will be 
for them to see how McDonald's fits into their balanced diet," said Terri 
Capatosto, spokeswoman for the fast-food giant. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's drew fire from anti-cholesterol crusader Phil Sokolof this spring 
when the Omaha industrialist took out full-page ads in newspapers across the 
country pleading with McDonald's to cut the fat in its hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
Sokolof's ad, under the headline "The Poisoning of America," was attacked by 
McDonald's as misleading and malicious.

Capatosto said today's announcement had nothing to do with Sokolof's campaign.

The government has chosen voice-coder technology manufactured by Motorola Inc. 
as Japan's national standard for new-generation digital cellular phones, 
officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola, which has long fought to increase its foothold in the Japanese 
market, was selected from among eight Japanese and foreign companies. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, the first to allow Motorola technology to be used nationwide, 
could pave the way for other foreign electronics companies in the Japanese 
market, said an official at the mobile phone division of the Post and 
Telecommunications Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry official said the action showed the Japanese market is now open to 
foreign competitors. "The result also proved the excellence of the U.S. 
technology," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody, regardless of whether Japanese or foreign, can sell their products 
here only if the quality is high. It's up to how much effort each company will 
make," he said.

After a 40-year interval, the Library of Congress has decided to resume 
awarding a national prize for poetry. 
</P>
<P>
Librarian of Congress James Billington issued a statement that the award, to be 
called The Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry, will be presented 
in October for the best book of poetry published by an American during 1988 or 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
The $10,000 prize is provided by Bobbitt's family in her memory. Bobbitt, a 
sister of President Lyndon B. Johnson, worked in the library's cataloguing 
department in the 1930s, where she met her husband, O. P. Bobbitt. 
</P>
<P>
The Bobbitt Prize is the first such award given by the library since it awarded 
the 1948 Bollingen Prize to Ezra Pound. Pound had been interned for his 
pro-Italian activities during World War II and was indicted for treason. 
</P>
<P>
Following that controversy, the library adopted a policy prohibiting the 
granting of awards or prizes.

FILMMAKER MOORE'S NBA SEGMENT SHOT DOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
CBS Sports had this great idea for a halftime feature on Thursday night's 
second game of the Portland-Detroit NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
They were going to air a humorous segment featuring Michael Moore, creator of 
the documentary "Roger &amp; Me," and some unemployed Detroit auto workers 
trying to get front-row tickets for the playoff game with the help of Piston 
players -- a spoof of the usual features that show big-name stars cheering on 
their favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Moore's "Roger &amp; Me," which has won several awards, detailed the losses of 
jobs in the auto industry in Flint, Mich., and Moore's futile attempts to 
interview GM Chairman Roger Smith. 
</P>
<P>
GM has charged Moore with a variety of inaccuracies in the film. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said Thursday that he and halftime CBS Sports segment producer Eric Mann 
had been discussing the "lighthearted" piece for several days and that he was 
set to fly to Detroit on Tuesday to do the film during Game 1. But on Monday, 
"I got word that it was canceled." 
</P>
<P>
"GM is still smarting from the success of the film," Moore said. "But the guys 
at CBS were very nice to me. I think they feel very bad about this." 
</P>
<P>
John Mueller, a spokesman for GM in Detroit, said the Thursday night game "was 
never discussed with General Motors. Programming decisions are the 
responsibility of the network."

Rolling Stones' lead singer Mick Jagger denied today that he was romantically 
involved with a blond German model who he said was trying to capitalize on a 
brief association with him by giving interviews to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
British tabloids had a field day with pictures of Jagger and 24-year-old model 
Christina Haack and Jerry Hall, the Texas model and mother of his two children. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the newspapers today also showed a woman trying to deliver a huge 
bouquet of flowers at Hall's London home, claiming that they were the 
47-year-old rock star's attempt to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
Haack told reporters that she dated Jagger for three days while the Rolling 
Stones were on tour in Munich. She said that they dined, that he came home to 
her apartment and that they are "very, very good friends." 
</P>
<P>
Jagger said he only spoke with Haack in a club for a few minutes and did not 
visit her apartment. Haack, who resembles Hall, is "obviously making the most 
of a few minutes with me," Jagger said.

Andre Agassi and Andres Gomez overcame rain and strong winds today in the 
French Open tennis championships to reach the final of a Grand Slam tournament 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded Agassi had an easier time than the score suggested despite 
dropping a set in his 6-1, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 victory over unseeded Jonas Svensson 
of Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
"He did a good job of beating himself. I had an easy start," said Agassi, the 
highest surviving seed. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, seeded fourth, easily beat seventh-seeded Thomas Muster of Austria, 7-6, 
6-1, 7-5, to qualify for Sunday's final. Agassi and Gomez have met four times, 
each winning twice. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi, 20, appeared confident about his chances against Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not concerned about who I play. I played Gomez a month ago in Key 
Biscayne, Fla., and things worked fine for me, but it's going to be a long 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"I want it pretty bad. I didn't stay in Paris for two weeks to finish in second 
place, I'm going out there to win it," Agassi said after winning in two hours, 
27 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi, whose refusal to wear traditional white on court has incurred the wrath 
of tennis authorities in Paris, began in style, winning the first three games 
before Svensson held his serve. 
</P>
<P>
The game was interrupted by rain briefly at the start of the match, but storm 
clouds held off for the rest of the match. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi then swept the next seven games as he surged into a two-set lead. 
</P>
<P>
Svensson, 23, failed with most of his attempted drop shots but fought back at 
the end of the second set. 
</P>
<P>
The wind swirled around the center court in the third set, holding the ball up, 
and the unseeded Swede briefly found his form as Agassi struggled with the 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
But the American, ranked fifth in the world, came out confidently in the 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi's service was far superior to the Swede's. He did not double-fault at 
all and 80% of his first serves found the mark, compared with 57% for Svensson. 
</P>
<P>
Svensson admitted the pressure of playing in such a big match had affected his 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really nervous at the start. His game does not suit me at all. He tracks 
everything down and hits it back solidly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, who has failed to reach even the semifinals in 26 Grand Slam 
tournaments, succeeded at last on his favorite surface, clay, winning in less 
than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave everything today. I knew the way he was going to play. Maybe people saw 
Muster as the favorite but I prefer it that way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moving Muster around with smooth strokes and drop shots, Gomez took the first 
three games in less than 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
A rainy spell allowed Muster to regain his composure -- and his serve -- to 
close the gap to 3-2, but he lost his serve twice again in the first set. 
</P>
<P>
After that it all proved too much for the Austrian, who lost the next seven 
games in a row to find himself two sets down in little more than 75 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The tennis lesson continued in the last set when Muster, broken in the third 
game, only managed to break back five games later before crashing out on a last 
passing shot which left him with his head bowed in despair.

Former Seattle Seahawk Kenny Easley was in serious condition today after 
undergoing a kidney transplant at the University of Washington Medical Center, 
a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Inez Ahina said Easley's condition was normal for someone after the 
2 1/2-hour operation, which took place Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Easley, 31, a safety, had been in renal failure for two years and was 
undergoing kidney dialysis three times a week, said Leslie Tidball, a 
spokeswoman with Easley's sports agent business, Easley Osborne Sports 
Management Group. 
</P>
<P>
Tidball said Easley had been called to the hospital Thursday for the operation 
that began at 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctors say he's doing very well," Tidball said, adding that Easley was 
expected to be released from the hospital in 10 to 14 days. 
</P>
<P>
Easley's seven-year NFL career ended in the spring of 1988 when an irreversible 
kidney ailment was discovered during a routine physical when the Seahawks 
attempted to trade him to the Phoenix Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Easley, Seattle's first-round draft pick in 1981, was a five-time Pro Bowl 
selection and was chosen as NFL defensive player of the year in 1984. He was a 
two-time All-America at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Easley sued the Seahawks, alleging that he was allowed to play through 
the 1987 season without being told that he had the kidney problem.

The University of Oregon will be forced to decide whether to leave the Pacific 
10 Conference unless the state helps cover its athletic department deficit, the 
school's president says. 
</P>
<P>
University President Myles Brand said Thursday it would be better for Oregon to 
drop intercollegiate athletics than join a less prestigious conference. 
</P>
<P>
He said Oregon's membership in the Pac-10 is "the most important affiliation we 
have as an academic institution." 
</P>
<P>
Brand's comments were among the first intended to persuade the state Board of 
Higher Education to seek state funds to help eliminate a combined deficit of $6 
million in the athletic department budgets at Oregon, Oregon State University 
and Portland State University. The board is expected to take up the issue when 
it meets next week. 
</P>
<P>
The Oregon athletic department projects an accumulated deficit of $1.8 million 
at the end of this month, school officials said.

HOOLIGANS BEWARE: ITALIAN 'BIG BROTHER' IS WATCHING

<TEXT>
<P>
Somewhere out of sight, "Big Brother" is watching World Cup fans and players. 
</P>
<P>
Hidden television cameras allow security forces to monitor every seat in the 
stadiums and secretly photograph troublemakers. Computers mounted in squad cars 
link police patrols with command center data banks, and yet another device can 
receive pictures of suspected hooligans transmitted from headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Soccer and the Computer Age have collided head-on at the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"The stadiums will be under control minute by minute," said Carlo Porceddu, the 
head of security for the World Cup organizing committee in Cagliari, Sardinia. 
</P>
<P>
He said every seat in every one of the 12 stadiums can be monitored by 
closed-circuit television. Police watching on monitors can zoom in on 
disturbances, photograph the troublemakers and send security forces to the 
section. 
</P>
<P>
Just to buy tickets for any of the 52 matches, spectators had to give 
organizers personal particulars that police, with the help of a computer, can 
use to identify troublemakers photographed by the stadium security systems. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities in the World Cup countries have also helped Italian police compile 
computerized files on potentially violent fans. Customs agents can use the 
information to turn back some people at the borders or airports, and police can 
use it to identify and follow suspected soccer hooligans. 
</P>
<P>
Through the computers and Telephoto machines installed in police cars, officers 
in the field can also have direct access to the files. 
</P>
<P>
The World Cup's use of technology also extends to policing the games. 
Technicians at a sports medicine center laboratory in Rome will use such 
instruments as gas chromatographs, mass spectrometers and liquid-crystal 
chromatographs to test selected players for the illegal use of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Argentine supporters, wearing white and blue scarves, toured downtown Milan 
hours before the kickoff of today's opening game with Cameroon. Some bars and 
cafes displayed signs announcing that no alcoholic beverages will be sold. 
</P>
<P>
Milan city officials imposed the ban on match days to reduce risks of 
rowdiness. Rome, Cagliari, Palermo and Bari are among the 12 host cities that 
have also announced bans on alcohol sales for match days. 
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 police and hundreds of other order-keepers were on duty around 
the stadium to check spectators and confiscate items that could be used as 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic jams were reported in downtown Milan as security forces temporarily 
closed large areas to private traffic to protect movement of dignitaries in 
Milan for the World Cup inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
Milan police announced a ban on political demonstrations on the day of the cup 
opener.

because of differences with the school's administration. 
</P>
<P>
Ostrowski called a team meeting and announced his decision Thursday afternoon 
but declined to comment publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster slumped to a 6-16 record and won only one game in the Sunset League 
this season.

LUCERO, SCHWARTZ REV UP THEIR WAR ON WHEELS AT FAIRGROUNDS

COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's only 25 yards from the starting gate to the first turn on the 190-yard 
oval at the Orange County Fairgrounds. But that short straightaway has been the 
scene of one of the biggest feuds in American speedway motorcycle racing. 
</P>
<P>
Defending U.S. champion Bobby Schwartz of Costa Mesa and 1988 champion Steve 
Lucero of Riverside have staged a two-month battle in scratch main events. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz, 33, and Lucero, 25, have been involved in four incidents in the past 
10 weeks and still they have managed to combine to win seven scratch main 
races. Schwartz won the event five times in the first seven weeks and Lucero 
has won the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But the two have also paid a price for their bitter feud. Each rider has been 
disqualified twice for their roles in the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
"The Feud at the Fairgrounds" began on Friday the 13th of April and came to a 
head two weeks ago when Schwartz clashed with promoter Harry Oxley in a small 
office near the pit area where a confrontation deteriorated into a pushing 
match. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz, a 17-year veteran who has raced internationally, says, "I think Steve 
is out to get me. I fear bodily injury every time I'm in the same race with 
Steve Lucero." 
</P>
<P>
Lucero, the strongest and most aggressive rider on the circuit, said, "It's 
just racing. Downright hard racing between the two of us, and one of us can't 
handle it." 
</P>
<P>
All the incidents have occurred in four-lap scratch races where riders line up 
four abreast at the start. Traditionally, the rider who gets off to the 
quickest start and is first to reach the turn usually goes on to win the race 
on the narrow track that was originally built for equestrian shows. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of crashes on the track -- where riders reach speeds of only 40 
miles per hour -- come at Turn 1 as the four riders fight for the lead. Track 
announcer Larry Huffman once compared the race to Turn 1 as "a calvary charge 
into a closet door." 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that 98% of the race is getting through the first turn," Lucero 
said. "It's a major, major part of the race. My feeling is this: I'm going 
through that turn first no matter who's in my way. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if it was my wife, my mother or my grandmother racing against me, 
I'm going to race as aggressively as I can to get through that turn. We're 
talking about my livelihood." 
</P>
<P>
Lucero, who began riding junior speedway when he was 10 years old, estimates he 
lost at least $1,000 when he was disqualified twice by referee Phil Moon for 
dangerous riding. But he said he won't back down to Schwartz or any other 
rider. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz, an often-volatile rider, has other ideas. He doesn't know how the 
feud began, but insists he won't continue riding under the present 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"All of this has taken the fun out of racing," Schwartz said. "I'm really upset 
because nobody . . . the referee or the promoter, has done anything about this. 
I've told Phil Moon, 'Steve is out to get me.' All of this has made me 
seriously consider retiring after this year." 
</P>
<P>
The fourth incident was May 25, when Schwartz fell on Turn 2 of the third lap. 
Moon ruled that there was only incidental contact between Schwartz and Lucero 
and that Schwartz had intentionally gone down in hopes of getting a restart. (A 
restart is granted when half the field falls before half the race has been 
completed.) 
</P>
<P>
Moon declared Lucero the winner and Schwartz went straight for promoter Oxley. 
Asked what happened, Schwartz said, "I pushed him, we shoved each other and 
then he choked me." 
</P>
<P>
Does Schwartz have any second thoughts about attacking the promoter? 
</P>
<P>
"I have no remorse whatsoever," he said. "I've been treated poorly, and the 
promoter thinks all of this is great for his business." 
</P>
<P>
Oxley, who witnessed only the fourth incident between the riders, said he 
received reports on every incident while on business in England. He praised 
Moon's officiating of the incidents and blamed both riders equally for their 
roles in escalating the feud, both on and off the track. 
</P>
<P>
"Racing is a hard business with an element of danger," Oxley said. "When you 
mix in some animosity between two very emotional, high-strung individuals like 
Bobby and Steve, it's very difficult to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Bobby has reached a point in his career where he doesn't need to worry 
about an incident that might put him in a cast. But Steve isn't 100% wrong 
here. Bobby is falling down awfully easy. He's gotten a little gun shy." 
</P>
<P>
Moon said he has talked to both riders and has carefully watched both riders 
since the first incident on April 13. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what sparked the incidents, but most of the problems have have 
started in the pit area before the races," Moon said. "Since Day 1, when I 
started in speedway 20 years ago, we've always had two riders who haven't 
gotten along. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a little different because we're dealing with two champions. My 
concern, as always, is with rider safety. I don't want someone else hurt 
because there's some bad blood between the riders." 
</P>
<P>
Former two-time world champion Bruce Penhall of Laguna Niguel has witnessed two 
of the incidents from his private box at Turn 1 and also has expressed concern 
for other riders' safety. 
</P>
<P>
"What bothers me is that I'm afraid someone is going to get hurt," Penhall 
said. "If something were to happen to either Bobby or Steve, they'd have to 
live with that the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"There's going to be accidents in racing . . . it's part of the game. There's 
going to be a minimal amount of bumping on a small track like Costa Mesa. But 
there's no room in the sport for dangerous riding. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Steve has gotten very frustrated that Bobby wins so much. He can't 
beat him, so he's decided to go through him. Now, Steve has Bobby right where 
he wants him . . . looking over his shoulder to see if he's coming." 
</P>
<P>
The Schwartz-Lucero feud certainly isn't the first in speedway. Local favorite 
Rick Woods battled Mike Bast in the 1970s and Alan Christian battled with Bast 
in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The bad blood between Christian and Bast reached its height in 1980 when 
Christian won 13 consecutive scratch main events at the Fairgrounds. Christian, 
competing in his 20th season, works next to Lucero in the pit area. He has 
watched this latest battle escalate over the past few weeks and says money -- 
riders can earn up to $1,000 on a scratch main event -- is the root of the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I talk to Steve all the time," Christian said. "You have two hard riders who 
are having problems at the best-paying track on the circuit. You want to win at 
Costa Mesa more than anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand what they're going through. I look back at what happened between 
Mike and myself and I understand how these things tend to snowball when you're 
racing against the same guys, four nights a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I got tired of Mike Bast ramming into me, and one night, I jumped off my bike 
and got into a fist fight with him on the track. It started with an incident 
and then you feel you have to pay somebody back. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not proud of the fight with Mike, but it happened. After that (fight), we 
stayed away from each other. He ran into me for the last time after the fight. 
Sometimes, something like that has to happen to end a feud." 
</P>
<P>
Another round of this war on wheels could unfold tonight on the Fairgrounds 
oval. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE FEUD AT THE FAIRGROUNDS 
</P>
<P>
Defending U.S. champion Bobby Schwartz of Costa Mesa and 1988 champion Steve 
Lucero have been involved in four racing incidents in 10 weeks at the Orange 
County Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
April 13: In the scratch semifinal, Lucero is disqualified for dangerous riding 
after he collided with Schwartz. Schwartz goes on to win the scratch main 
event. 
</P>
<P>
May 4: In the scratch main, Schwartz is disqualified for falling on Turn 2 
after bumping into Lucero. Referee Phil Moon rules Schwartz fell intentionally 
in hopes of getting a restart. A press release the following week says Schwartz 
was disqualified for "bad acting." 
</P>
<P>
May 18: Lucero is disqualified for ramming Schwartz into the crash wall at Turn 
1 in the scratch main event. Schwartz wins the main event, and Moon fines 
Lucero $100 for dangerous riding. 
</P>
<P>
May 25: Schwartz and Lucero bump on Turn 2 of the third lap in the scratch main 
event and Schwartz falls. Moon rules Lucero the winner because half the race 
was completed. Schwartz confronts promoter Harry Oxley and a pushing match 
ensues.

BILL TO OUTLAW RABBIT EYE TESTS MAY BENEFIT FIRM; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: IF THE ANIMAL-RIGHTS MEASURE IS SIGNED INTO LAW, ROPAK 
LABORATORIES HAS A GOOD SHOT AT A $500-MILLION MARKET WITH ITS ALTERNATIVE TEST 
METHODS.

<TEXT>
<P>
In an apparent victory for animal-rights advocates and an upstart Orange County 
company, the state Senate on Thursday approved a bill outlawing eye and skin 
tests on rabbits to determine the safety of cosmetics and household products. 
</P>
<P>
If the animal-rights legislation is signed by the governor, California would 
become the first state to outlaw the eye and skin irritancy tests on rabbits. 
And Irvine-based Ropak Laboratories, which has developed an alternative testing 
method, would get a big boost. 
</P>
<P>
While Ropak has stayed out of the political fray, the company has taken the 
lead in developing and marketing test kits that it contends are more effective 
and less costly for certain applications than putting products on rabbits and 
watching their reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Ropak has developed a vegetable protein matrix that it says can mimic human eye 
and skin responses. The matrix is contained in a clear liquid that clouds when 
an irritant is dropped into it. The more opaque the liquid becomes, the more 
irritating is the product. 
</P>
<P>
The company's Eytex and SkinTex tests are used now by more than 80 firms and 
independent laboratories in the United States, Europe and Japan, including such 
big corporate cosmetics companies as Avon Products, Revlon, L'Oreal and Mary 
Kay Cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry analysts have great expectations for Ropak. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Berg, an analyst in medical technologies for William K. Woodruff and 
Co., a Dallas securities firm, said that while there are other alternative 
tests in various stages of development, Ropak is "the leading contender in a 
growth market and has captured the attention of most of the major companies." 
</P>
<P>
He estimates that the potential market for alternative testing could top $500 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Ropak's testing process was developed by Virginia Gordon, who has a Ph.D. in 
biophysical chemistry and is vice president of Ropak, and by Hy Bergman, a 
physiologist.

The firm's chief executive is Christopher Kelly of Newport Beach, who 14 years 
ago developed one of the first laboratory tests that replaced rabbit tests for 
detecting pregnancy. He is the company's major stockholder and has invested 
$3.5 million in the firm. 
</P>
<P>
The company's name reflects its association with Ropak Corp., a Fullerton-based 
manufacturer of plastic packaging that last year bought a third interest in the 
test-making firm for $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Ropak officials have tried to steer clear of the political battle by 
animal-rights activists to restrict the use of animals in product testing. One 
reason is to not alienate the cosmetic industry -- the company's main market -- 
which has staunchly opposed such legislation contending that "test tube assays" 
are not yet reliable enough to completely replace animals. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Gordon acknowledges that the market for Ropak's tests is being 
driven by the opposition to animal testing. Gordon, who previously was a 
cardiovascular researcher, said she was prompted to delve into cosmetics 
testing when she noticed in the early 1980s that "there were a lot of pickets 
at Revlon." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the animal-rights movement has gained momentum. According to 
the Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Assn., currently seven states are 
considering legislation to ban certain testing on animals. 
</P>
<P>
In California, AB 2461, authored by Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Santa 
Barbara), would prohibit eye and skin tests on rabbits in the development of 
cosmetics and household products such as waxes and soaps. Although the bill has 
passed both houses of the Legislature, supporters of the bill worry that it 
will be vetoed by the governor, who they believe will be swayed by industry 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
While the legislation only applies to California, Ropak officials say it could 
be precedent setting. "It will be the first domino that will influence the 
various state legislatures and then Congress. And the rest of the world will 
follow," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Getting industry scientists to voluntarily convert to a new testing technology 
has been difficult, Ropak officials say. Ropak got a chilly reception when in 
1987 it attended a conference of the Johns Hopkins Center for Alternatives to 
Animal Testing where it proposed its new Eytex product as an alternative to the 
Draize rabbit test. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon said she believes that toxicologists at the conference were antagonistic 
because the new test was developed by a profit-seeking venture, rather than in 
a university laboratory. "We started as a commercial venture, and the origins 
of all other proposed alternatives (to animal testing) came out of 
universities," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Gordon said the company's scientific methodology "was out of the 
mainstream" because it used molecular cell parts while most other scientists 
were working with whole cells in cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Lastly, Gordon said toxicology for years has been a rather stodgy field, closed 
to innovation. She noted, for instance, that the Draize test has been a 
standard for measuring eye irritants since it was developed in 1944 by a 
scientist at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Ropak sponsored a series of tests at a dozen laboratories in 1987 and found 
that its Eytex procedure matched results of Draize tests in 95% of the cases. 
But manufacturers remained skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
Ropak officials say the company's big break came early last year when S.C. 
Johnson and Avon published the results of their own preliminary studies that 
showed Ropak's Eytex performed remarkably well. 
</P>
<P>
"Those two reports ignited a fire in the U.S. in terms of attracting the 
attention of other companies." Gordon said. "Their studies carried tremendous 
weight in taking us into Europe and Japan, while Ropak Corp. provided the 
financial backing and financial network to do that." 
</P>
<P>
In response, Ropak says its sales soared. The company projects sales should 
double to more than $1.2 million this year from last year. 
</P>
<P>
Still there are more hurdles to overcome. Many toxicology authorities insist 
that all procedures proposed as alternatives to animal testing have flaws. 
</P>
<P>
"The Eytex is not an alternative to the Draize because it does not detect some 
irritants," said Sidney Green, in charge of the unit at the FDA that reviews 
tests on new cosmetic products. 
</P>
<P>
He said that while FDA regulations do not say animal testing is needed for 
cosmetics, the agency's policy requires it. "Somewhere along the line the 
substance must be tested in animals or the FDA will not accept it," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Goldberg, director for the Johns Hopkins Center for Alternatives to Animal 
Testing, agrees. "There is no single test or panel of tests that can as yet 
replace the Draize test." he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some companies, including Shaklee and Avon, have completely stopped using 
animal tests and begun using Eytex and other alternatives. But even these 
companies stress that they are relying on a vast database of animal testing on 
virtually all of the ingredients that go into both existing and new products. 
They say they use the Eytex test to confirm results that they have already 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Dickens, manager of toxicology for Avon, said that company has just 
completed validation studies with Eytex involving 466 products and raw 
ingredients -- "and it has turned out very well." 
</P>
<P>
But he said most other companies do not have as much historical data from the 
Draize test. "If I was in another company without the database I have I might 
not be as comfortable" about discontinuing animal tests, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ropak officials contend that if they were manufacturers of consumer products, 
they too would insist on making a final test on animals before using a new 
ingredient. But they add that the vast majority of ingredients in such products 
already have been tested on animals. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Eytex say that at minimum the test is valuable for initial 
screening of new products, allowing only those that pass to be tested on 
rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Allen, director of product development for Shaklee Corp. in San 
Francisco, said her company has been "working through problems" with the Ropak 
tests and helping the company make improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, she said, the company uses the Eytex test as well as another 
non-animal testing method as a double check and then compares the results of 
both against a database. But if such alternatives were not available, she said, 
the company "would never have stopped rabbit tests."

SMALL FIRMS GET HELP IN SELLING GOODS ABROAD; 
</P>
<P>
EXPORTS: GROWING NUMBERS OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING EXPERTS ARE LEAVING BIG 
CORPORATIONS TO WORK AS CONSULTANTS. 
</P>

<P>
After years of peddling soft drinks, laundry detergent and other consumer goods 
for major corporations, Bob Wallace decided two years ago to take his 
experience and strike out on his own. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with a few thousand dollars and years of marketing savvy, the former Los 
Angeles marketing manager for Pepsico Inc. and Lever Bros. started an export 
management company to help others do what he does best: sell in the 
international market. 
</P>
<P>
His goal is simple: "I'm giving the little Davids of this world a shot at the 
world market," Wallace said. "I'm the scout sent out to reconnoiter for the 
advancing troops." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, marketing director of Exports International Co. in Santa Ana, is among 
a growing pool of former international marketing managers who have left large 
corporations to work as export consultants for small and medium-size companies. 
</P>
<P>
"Most export managers have previous corporate experience and have an 
entrepreneurial spirit," said Edward Chavez, president of Anaheim Marketing 
International, an export management firm in Anaheim. "And export management is 
one area that allows them to use this entrepreneurial characteristic to exploit 
their marketing abilities and knowledge of the international market." 
</P>
<P>
Demand for export assistance has increased as more small and medium-size 
companies -- many with no prior experience in foreign markets -- try to peddle 
their wares abroad, said Martin Magdaleno, president of Sel Pro International, 
an Anaheim export management firm. Also, many companies can't afford to hire a 
full-time international marketing manager, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times, the local manufacturers have a great product but they don't 
export because they don't want to be bothered with the extra paper work and 
bureaucracy," said Magdaleno, a former manager of Beckman Instruments 
international division. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many U.S. companies are reluctant to take the time and effort to 
understand a foreign nation's culture and trade practices -- often a key to 
success abroad. And companies that are doing brisk business in the U.S. market 
are sometimes reluctant to spend money on a possibly risky overseas marketing 
program, said Patrick Killeen, marketing vice president for PEC International 
Trading Co. in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very expensive to market products abroad because so many things fall 
through. Unless you stay on top of things, you're not going to make any foreign 
sales," said Jerry McSpadden, president of Custom Business Solutions Inc., a 
Rochester, N.Y., firm that manages the export activities of 135 U.S. small and 
medium-size companies abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Export managers typically perform a number of services for their clients, from 
handling export paper work to performing market research and designing product 
brochures. 
</P>
<P>
"What we really do is find buyers for U.S.-made products," McSpadden said. "We 
act like the export department of a major American company. We're the conduits 
between the companies and their foreign buyers." 
</P>
<P>
Most export management companies are paid a percentage of the foreign business 
they help generate, usually 10% to 15% of the total sales. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, of Exports International, said many of his clients paid scant 
attention to export business and started selling abroad only after landing an 
unexpected foreign order. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Francis, president of Market Visions International, a novelty gift 
manufacturer in Santa Ana and a client of Wallace, said selling abroad "was an 
afterthought" for her firm. "Like many small companies, we were intending to 
sell only to the U.S. market, which was more lucrative," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But that changed when orders from overseas distributors who saw her products at 
U.S. trade shows began pouring in last year. Market Visions' hottest-selling 
items, particularly in Japan, are men's and women's underwear rolled into 
plastic stems to resemble long-stem roses, or underwear and socks tucked into 
plastic Easter eggs. These products are marketed under such labels as Panty 
Rose, Jockey Eggs, Jock in the Box and Just Hatched. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what to do with those orders since I've not handled anything 
like this in my life," Francis said. "As it is, I'm busy enough running the 
company, and I can't take on an extra load." 
</P>
<P>
So she hired Wallace to manage all her export activities on a commission basis. 
So did Nine Eagles Golf Co. in Santa Ana, when the golf club maker decided to 
take a swing at the foreign market last year. Today, Nine Eagles does not just 
import golf club components from Taiwan, but also sells the finished goods back 
to the Taiwanese, and to Japan and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
But with international trade heating up, some export managers have entered the 
export business for themselves. Some companies buy directly from manufacturers 
and sell to foreign distributors at a profit. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Custom Business began marketing on its own wooden neckties, made 
by Timber Ties Inc. near Boston. The ties retail at $20 to $40. This week, 
Custom shipped a container full of stain-resistant wooden ties worth more than 
$100,000 to a South Korean distributor. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Bogan, a consultant to the Export Managers Assn. of California in Van 
Nuys, said large companies don't often use export management companies. And 
when they do, it usually involves sales of product lines the manufacturer is 
not familiar with.

MICHAEL RAFFETTO, 91; EX-RADIO ACTOR

By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
Michael Raffetto, the original Paul Barbour on radio's beloved "One Man's 
Family," the landmark domestic anthology of the 1930s and '40s "dedicated to 
the mothers and fathers of the younger generation and to their bewildering 
offspring," has died at his home in Berkeley, his family announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Raffetto, who played the eldest son of Henry and Frances Barbour on one of 
radio's longest running and most popular programs, also was heard as Jack 
Packard, a daring globe trotter on "I Love a Mystery," an equally perennial 
favorite during the gloomy Depression and war years that kept Americans home by 
their radios. 
</P>
<P>
Raffetto, a native Californian born in the gold-country mining town of 
Placerville, was 91 when he died May 31. 
</P>
<P>
"One Man's Family" was the creation of Carlton E. Morse, who also fashioned "I 
Love a Mystery." It was said to have been patterned after John Galsworthy's 
evergreen "Forsyte Saga." Raffetto said in a 1987 interview that the show's 
vast appeal may have evolved from Morse's own nurturing nature. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was a sentimental or sad scene (in the script), the tears would roll 
down his cheeks." 
</P>
<P>
From its initial broadcast on April 29, 1932, until May 8, 1959, (Raffetto was 
on the show until 1956) it was heard regularly on NBC in various conformations. 
Its cast came to number in the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
Raffetto's character was that of a fighter pilot, wounded in World War I, whose 
bride died in the flu epidemic of that era. He carried the physical and 
psychological scars throughout his life, never remarrying although his love 
interests became an integral part of the story line. It was to Paul that the 
four other Barbour children turned for solace and advice when their caring but 
always proper father would have been impatient with them. 
</P>
<P>
And for several years it was Paul who ended each chapter thusly: "That's how it 
is with the Barbours today." 
</P>
<P>
Generations listened as the carefully defined Barbours agonized over their 
subtle conflicts. Parents and then their children grew and grew old with them. 
</P>
<P>
When Morse created a second program, shifting from domestic to adventure drama 
with "I Love a Mystery" in 1939, he took along three members of the "Family" 
crew. 
</P>
<P>
Raffetto was Packard, a soft-spoken, taciturn hero in the best traditions of 
the West; Barton Yarborough, who had been Paul Barbour's brother, Clifford, was 
Doc Long, the brawling womanizer, while Walter Paterson, second husband of 
Barbour daughter Claudia, was Reggie York, the proper Englishman. 
</P>
<P>
They were "specialists in adventure," as the announcer would intone each week, 
circling the globe apprehending sadistic ruffians. The brutality of the shows 
was atypical of the time. There would be victims of werewolves whose throats 
had been torn out, bloody brawls with exotic weapons, knifings, hangings and -- 
more routinely -- shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Mercedes McCambridge, the gravelly voiced actress who later went on to film 
fame (particularly as the uncredited voice of "The Exorcist") was a cast 
regular as was Gloria Blondell, sister of Joan. That program ran intermittently 
until 1952 but transcriptions of it remain prevalent and popular today. 
</P>
<P>
Raffetto, a cum laude graduate of UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall in 1925, practiced 
law briefly in San Francisco but soon returned to Berkeley where he taught 
drama and directed at Los Angeles' Greek Theatre in the late 1920s. He starred 
in and produced "Arm of the Law" for NBC in 1930, became the network's West 
Coast program director and joined the "Family" cast. 
</P>
<P>
His other radio credits included "Death Valley Days" and "Attorney for the 
Defense." 
</P>
<P>
As a youth, Raffetto made a few silent films, including "Tillie's Punctured 
Romance," and had a small part in "A Foreign Affair" with Marlene Dietrich in 
1948 and "Storm Center" with Bette Davis in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Constance, four daughters and five grandchildren.

Thomas R. Sheridan, a prominent Los Angeles trial lawyer who served as 
executive director of the McCone Commission and special assistant to the U.S. 
attorney general, died Thursday. He was 60. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan died of cardiac arrest at St. Vincent's Medical Center where he had 
been hospitalized for several weeks. He had also suffered a series of strokes. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Gen. Robert F. Kennedy had appointed Sheridan his special assistant 
in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan was named general counsel and executive director of the McCone 
Commission which was set up immediately after the Watts riots in 1965. The 
commission explored the cause of the upheaval and made recommendations for 
avoiding future violence. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Boston, Sheridan was graduated from Catholic University of America in 
Washington and earned his law degree at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
He first worked as a trial attorney in the antitrust division of the federal 
Department of Justice and later headed the criminal division of the U.S. 
attorney's office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan had been in private practice since 1965 in the Los Angeles firm of 
Simon &amp; Sheridan which he formed with William G. Simon. 
</P>
<P>
Among his best-known clients was C. Arnholt Smith, the San Diego millionaire 
who was convicted in 1975 of making illegal campaign contributions and pleaded 
no contest to conspiracy and misapplication of funds from his defunct U.S. 
National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include four sons, Michael, Stephen, Kevin and Robert; two brothers; 
two sisters; two grandsons, and several nieces and nephews and great-nieces and 
great-nephews. 
</P>
<P>
Services will be held at 11 a.m. Monday in San Fernando Mission Rey Chapel, 
followed by burial in San Fernando Mission Cemetery, Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The family has asked that memorial donations be made to any favorite charity.
