IMMIGRATION LAW FAILING, STUDY FINDS

The landmark overhaul of U. S. immigration law enacted in 1986 has thus far 
failed to reverse the well-established pattern of illegal immigration from 
Mexico and is unlikely to achieve lawmakers' stated goal of deterring 
undocumented migrants, an academic study here has found. 
</P>
<P>
Those conclusions, reached by a group of researchers directed by the Center for 
U.S.-Mexican Studies at UC San Diego, contradict statements by U. S. 
immigration authorities and congressional aides, who assert that the law is 
working as designed. 
</P>
<P>
The academicians, whose more than two-year study of the effects of the 1986 law 
is among the most systematic such reviews done nationwide, reported this week 
that Mexican migrants are continuing to flow northward, with or without 
documentation, and that many illegal aliens are using bogus paper work to 
secure jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jobs Still Available 
</P>
<P>
Despite new legal sanctions against employers who hire illegal aliens, the 
study found that most Mexican migrants continue to find work in the United 
States and that few are returning to Mexico, which is believed to account for 
more than 90% of the illegal immigrants entering the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1986 immigration law has not shut off the flow of new undocumented 
immigrants from . . . Mexico," said Wayne A. Cornelius, director of the Center 
for U.S.-Mexican Studies and head of the study. "No viable alternative to 
migrating to the United States has developed in these communities, so they're 
continuing to send people." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Cornelius, one of the leading U. S. experts on Mexico and 
immigration, said migrants are increasingly arriving from areas of Mexico 
relatively new to the migrant stream, such as Mexico City and the states of 
Mexico, Guerrero and Oaxaca. The development is an ominous one for U. S. 
policy-makers seeking to deter illegal immigration, Cornelius said, as it 
indicates that new migrant networks are being created at a time when 
authorities would like to seal off arrivals from traditional migrant areas. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, the most comprehensive reform of 
the nation's immigration laws in more than three decades, was designed largely 
to reduce the flow of illegal aliens, mostly Mexicans, into the United States 
via the U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
Cornelius and others have argued that the law will likely be ineffective as 
long as Mexico's economy continues to deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officials Disputed Results 
</P>
<P>
INS and congressional officials disputed the results of the study, asserting 
that the law was indeed deterring illegal immigration. Among other things, 
authorities noted that arrests of illegal aliens along the U. S.-Mexico border 
-- long considered the best single indicator of undocumented immigration -- 
have declined precipitously since passage of the new immigration law. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we've pushed back the tide" of illegal immigration, said Ron Rogers, 
an INS spokesman in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. authorities have attributed the decline in arrests at the border in part 
to the deterrent effect of the so-called "employer sanction" sections of the 
new law. Those provisions require that all employers check prospective workers' 
documentation to determine that they are authorized to work in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The study found that a large number of Mexican illegal aliens -- 41% of those 
with jobs who were interviewed by the academicians -- had resorted to using 
false or borrowed immigration documents to secure work, thus circumventing the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in arrests at the border, Cornelius said, was more probably linked 
to the fact that more than 3 million formerly illegal residents have been 
granted legal status in the amnesty program and are now able to cross the 
border legally. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional aides with two U. S. senators active in immigration matters, 
Republican Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming and Democrat Edward M. Kennedy of 
Massachusetts, characterized the results of the San Diego study as premature, 
as it will take years to judge the new law's true effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego study involved a series of stages, including interviews with more 
than 300 Mexican immigrants, both documented and undocumented, working for 100 
non-agricultural employers throughout Southern California and the San Francisco 
Bay Area. Employers were also surveyed. It is estimated that half of all 
Mexican immigrants to this country are bound for California. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers also traveled to Mexico and spoke with residents from towns in 
three states -- Michoacan, Jalisco and Zacatecas -- long identified with 
immigration to California.

Old cartoon strips don't die, they just get sketchier, or so it must seem to a 
legion of fans who will get a new Sunday-only cartoon strip from Pulitzer 
Prize-winning cartoonist Berke Breathed in place of his wildly popular "Bloom 
County." Ever since Breathed announced he would be ending the strip and 
replacing it with the weekly feature, letters have been pouring in from unhappy 
readers, including a suicide threat (which turned out to be fake) and the 
announcement by a Massachusetts teen-ager of a grass-roots campaign to keep the 
cartoon characters alive. "The warmth of those characters was really something, 
and it's been an exceptional show of regret that Berke's ending it," said Al 
Leeds, who edits the cartoon strip for the Washington Post Writer's Group. It 
was Leeds who signed Breathed to a contract in 1980 and watched the strip, 
featuring Opus the penguin and the other peculiar residents of a fictional 
locale, spread to about 800 daily and college newspapers nationwide. The 
cartoonist's mail has more than doubled lately, to as many as 250 letters a 
week, full of pleas from fans such as 13-year-old Eric Gustafson, who has 
collected about 100 signatures in his campaign to save the strip, ending Aug. 
6. "I'm sure 'Bloom County' has a lot of fans nationally who are upset, so 
we're trying to get something started locally and hope it will spread," said 
Eric.

 -- Czechoslovakian playwright Vaclav Havel, whose jailing this year for human 
rights activism raised a global outcry, will be awarded the West German Book 
Trade Assn.'s 1989 peace prize. The prize, worth $12,700, will be awarded at 
the annual Frankfurt Book Fair on Oct. 15, but Havel likely won't be there to 
receive it. "He has no passport, and even if he were given one he would be 
afraid to go unless he had assurances that he would be allowed back," said the 
playwright's brother, Ivan Havel. Havel, 52, served half of an eight-month 
prison term on charges arising from demonstrations against Czechoslovakia's 
Communist government. He was released May 17 after protests over his sentence.

 -- First Lady Barbara Bush quietly celebrated her 64th birthday Thursday, 
saying she "would just as soon not focus" on the event. Nothing special is 
planned for Monday either, when President Bush turns 65. None of the couple's 
children were on hand for Mrs. Bush's special day, which the First Lady was to 
spend in part speaking at the commencement for 110 graduates from the General 
Education Development program at Woodson High School in Washington, where high 
school dropouts return to receive their degrees. ANN CONNORS

<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley has singled out today as Drivetime Day in an effort to induce 
local motorists to be more courteous to each other. If it succeeds, maybe we 
can try for 48 hours next year. 
</P>
<P>
The event is the idea of Abe Levy, director of the Drivetime Foundation, a 
nonprofit group that promotes highway safety. 
</P>
<P>
To bring drivers closer together -- in an emotional, not vehicular sense -- 
commuters are invited to attend a breakfast featuring Levy, some California 
Highway Patrol officers and KRTH-FM radio disc jockey Steve Morris between 6 
a.m. and 10 a.m. at a Hollywood restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
But you'll have to get out of your car to participate -- it's at a Denny's, 
which is freeway-jam close on Sunset Boulevard. Tips on courteous driving will 
be dispensed along with free continental breakfasts and commuter cups. 
</P>
<P>
That someone should call for a roadway armistice isn't surprising. 
</P>
<P>
The spate of shootings of two summers ago is over. But the roads aren't exactly 
overflowing with love. One survey of freeway drivers conducted by a UC Irvine 
professor found that 17% reported yelling at one or more drivers during the 
week. And the study said that 6.3% "gesture obscenely on a weekly basis." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of life behind the wheel. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Every once in a while, a state Department of Motor Vehicles office temporarily 
becomes a drive-through. Last March, for instance, a woman taking a driving 
test at the Glendale headquarters accidentally accelerated while executing a 
turn and plowed into the building. 
</P>
<P>
In September, however, the DMV is going to open a real drive-through -- a kiosk 
window operation at Kester Avenue and Vanowen Street in Van Nuys. It's the 
first of its kind in the state. The kiosk will offer service for registration 
renewals as well as handbooks and general information. Odd isn't it, that 
there've been drive-throughs for just about everything except drivers' legal 
paperwork? 
</P>
<P>
Motorists in the Van Nuys area can only hope that the automobile lines at the 
new drive-through will consist of fewer people than the number who stand in 
line on foot at other DMV offices. 
</P>
<P>
One consolation: the DMV drive-through will not be used by novices wishing to 
take the driver's test. 
</P>
<P>
The subjects of the exhibit range from Martin Aguirre, who pulled 19 people out 
of the Los Angeles River during the flood of 1886, to Sherman Block, who used 
actor Ray Milland's toupee to fake out prostitutes during his colorful career 
as an undercover cop. 
</P>
<P>
They are two of the 29 bosses honored in the recently completed Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Museum on the corner of Colima Road and Telegraph Boulevard 
near Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Constructed by nonpaid volunteers working on their own time, it's open to the 
public on Tuesdays and Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
The museum, which covers the department from horseback days to motorcycle days, 
features a Department in Action Gallery that recalls operations involving 
murderer Charles Manson, the Watts riots and the "Twilight Zone" helicopter 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre (1858-1927), who is depicted by a wax dummy in his office, was one of 
Los Angeles' first law enforcement heroes, preferring often to arm himself with 
just a knife -- he said he was more accurate with that weapon. 
</P>
<P>
He was best known for his heroism during the 1886 flood, which sent humans and 
livestock tumbling down the Los Angeles River as well as houses torn from their 
foundations with smoke still escaping from their chimneys. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning at 1st Street, Aguirre rode into the river again and again to pull 
out victims. On his last try, he lifted a woman and little girl onto his horse 
but a piece of timber toppled the three of them into the water. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre came ashore at 7th Street. The woman survived, but the girl did not and 
it was said that the lawman grieved over the memory to the end of his days.

Israeli authorities held an international press party this week, inviting 
foreign journalists to watch as the army blew up a house in the Gaza Strip that 
was home to 13 Arabs. This carefully staged event had two openly announced 
purposes. One was to punish the family of a 19-year-old Palestinian who is 
awaiting trial on charges of throwing gasoline bombs at Israeli troops. The 
second was to try to frighten other Arabs into abandoning their support for the 
uprising against the Israeli occupation that is now in its 18th month. 
</P>
<P>
Collective punishment of this kind has become a regular occurrence in the 
occupied territories. Over the years the Israeli army has demolished or sealed 
hundreds of Arab homes in retaliation for real or, just as often, suspected 
acts of criminality or political defiance, almost always before any accused 
person has been tried or convicted. Such actions, protested repeatedly by the 
U.S. and other governments, violate the most elementary standards of Western 
justice by ignoring due process and holding an entire group responsible for the 
alleged crimes of one of its members.

THE SCHOOL DEADLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California Assembly Republicans are holding up state budget negotiations until 
they get more money for suburban and rural school districts. Their argument 
that suburban and rural schools now share many of the problems faced by large 
urban districts is correct, but their solution asks too much. They want to use 
most of any uncommitted education money to catch up. State education officials 
are working on new formulas that would help equalize spending but also 
recognize legitimate big-city needs. That will take time, but it seems the 
better approach. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the approximately $17-billion state public school budget will pay for 
basic costs of educating children and accommodating growth in enrollment. 
Between $400 million and $430 million will be left after the basic costs are 
covered. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 1976 California Supreme Court Serrano decision, the state also must 
move toward ensuring that all school districts receive equal amounts of money 
for each student. There is apparent agreement among education officials and 
legislators that about $150 million of the remaining funds should be spent on 
continuing implementation of the Serrano decision. Districts like Alhambra, 
Glendale, Garden Grove and Santa Ana would share the Serrano allocation, as 
would Los Angeles schools. 
</P>
<P>
Still unresolved is the question of how much of the remaining $300 million 
should go to what are called categorical aid programs, such as extra help for 
districts to transport handicapped students, improve programs for low-income 
students, pay for special help for students who speak little or no English and 
promote school desegregation. Assembly Republicans think the formulas for 
special programs should be rewritten so that suburban and rural districts get 
most of the money. 
</P>
<P>
State Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig agrees that suburban and 
rural districts should get more of this money, but not all of it and not as 
quickly as the Republicans want to get it. He thinks half of the money should 
go to the special programs, using more up-to-date formulas. Another $110 
million would be invested in reforms such as smaller classes; $40 million would 
pay cost-of-living adjustments for other special programs. Honig also thinks 
that funds earmarked for desegregation programs should remain separate, partly 
because courts would not look with favor on their being mixed with funds for 
redistribution. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question that changing population patterns have put new financial 
strains on suburban and rural districts. But urban districts have critical 
problems as well. The state will have enough money this year to address some of 
the needs of all sides only if all sides compromise on the question of how much 
money is required and how quickly the needs can be met.

NEW CLIMATE IN HUNGARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For two weeks in the fall of 1956 the world watched as Hungarians poured into 
the streets to challenge first the authority of their government and then the 
military might of the Soviet Union in a nationalist revolt aimed at 
overthrowing the dictatorship of the Communist Party. The uprising was brave 
and stirring but doomed to be crushed under ruthless attack from Soviet tanks. 
Thousands of Hungarians died, hundreds of thousands fled the country, and Imre 
Nagy, the prime minister who sided with the uprising, proclaimed Hungary's 
neutrality and called for free multiparty elections, was arrested. Two years 
later Nagy, convicted of treason in a show trial, was hanged and buried in an 
unmarked grave. 
</P>
<P>
On June 16 the remains of Nagy and several of his associates will be reburied 
in a public ceremony that the spokesman for the Communist Party's central 
committee hopes will serve as a "cathartic event" of national reconciliation. A 
large number of Hungarians, among them many who have spent more than 30 years 
in exile, are expected to attend. The funeral, which is likely to be one of the 
more dramatic moments in modern Hungarian history, will be televised throughout 
the country. Nagy's family has not invited any members of the central committee 
to be present. 
</P>
<P>
Nagy, who was a founding member of Hungary's Communist Party, still has not 
been formally rehabilitated. The central committee has agreed that his 
execution was an illegal "criminal act" carried out after a "fabricated 
political trial," but Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz remains opposed to 
blaming the party for Nagy's execution. Reformers within the party disagree; 
they want the past to be faced honestly and amends to be made honorably. 
Hungary is preparing for multiparty elections. Within a few years Communist 
rule could be ended by democratic means. The goals of the 1956 revolution seem 
to be in sight.

forced to stand in a long line for service with only one lethargic station open 
(coffee break?) or segregate my mail box delivery because of misdirection or 
dumping of multiple quantities of junk mail, I'll be more considerate of their 
unique plight. Sure I will.

RUMOR POWER: 'JUST GET HIM TO DENY IT . . . ' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN SCHRAM, Martin Schram is a syndicated columnist in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lyndon Johnson always loved the knee-slapper about the old Texas congressman 
who after decades in office suddenly had someone dare to run against him. So he 
hired a press agent and commanded: "Plant a story in the newspaper that says my 
opponent had sexual relations with a pig." 
</P>
<P>
Duly startled, the young press agent asked about the proof. "Proof -- hell!" 
thundered the old pol. "Just get him to deny it!" 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us, of course, to Lee Atwater and Newt Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
They are known to their band of disciples in Washington as skilled players of 
political hardball. But they are proving, even to stalwart fellow Republicans, 
to be players of sandlot sleazeball. 
</P>
<P>
Just when we think we've got their number, they come up with a pitch that is 
even more down and more dirty. 
</P>
<P>
So one day, there is House Republican Whip Gingrich -- you remember him as the 
man who quite properly nailed Jim Wright for taking money, but turns out to 
have found his own loophole to get money from fat cats on a book deal. Newt is 
on television bragging about how he's got his little list of "another nine or 
10 -- maybe more than that -- House Democrats" who violated House ethics rules. 
</P>
<P>
And then the Washington Post reported that one of his aides, Karen van 
Brocklin, had spoken with that newspaper and other major news organizations 
asking whether they planned to do stories looking into the personal life of new 
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley. The respected New York Daily News columnist 
Lars-Erik Nelson quoted a Gingrich aide as telling him, "We hear it's little 
boys." Nelson has since identified the aide as Van Brocklin. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes Lee Atwater's gang at the Republican National Committee. They have 
mailed to party leaders around the country an unsubtle, unsavory memo that 
seems to be written to raise suggestions about Foley's sexual preferences. 
</P>
<P>
The four-page memo is titled: "Tom Foley: Out of the Liberal Closet." It 
compares Foley's voting record with that of an openly gay congressman, Barney 
Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Like L.B.J.'s joke about the candidate and the pig, the Republican National 
Committee memo quickly achieved its real purpose: On the day Foley was elected 
speaker, the television networks also carried full reports of the memo and, of 
course, its innuendo; newspapers carried it the next day. The quotes were out. 
Grand Old Party mission accomplished. A-OK, GOP. 
</P>
<P>
And over at the Republican headquarters, Atwater then went through the motions 
of doing all the honorable things. Of course, he immediately called Foley and 
issued an apology for the way the memo was interpreted. You see, the memo was 
only trying to point out that Foley is a liberal. Nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
At the RNC, officials all swore that Atwater had not known of the memo until 
after it was mailed. It was written by RNC Communications Director Mark Goodin; 
it was approved by RNC Chief of Staff Mary Matlin, who says she focused only on 
what Goodin told her was the purpose of the memo -- to attack Foley for having 
a liberal voting record. She says she never noticed the blatant sexual 
innuendo, even though there is not a politically connected person in this 
politically incestuous capital who was unaware of people who've been trying for 
days to peddle all sorts of rumors about Foley and others. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater's initial response, despite his apologia, was to take no action against 
Goodin, his longtime associate. But that, of course, only raised more questions 
about who really ordered and/or approved what. A day later, the now-unproud 
author, Goodin, resigned. Bad judgment, all those at the RNC explained. 
</P>
<P>
But what Goodin was guilty of was carrying out -- a bit excessively -- the 
spirit instilled from above. It is a spirit that needs an emergency injection 
of civility. And apparently, only George Bush can order that. 
</P>
<P>
It is a measure of the sickness that pervades this capital city that the New 
York Times felt the need to devote the 18th paragraph of its article on the 
election of Foley as Speaker of the House to the following news: 
</P>
<P>
"Members of Congress, speaking privately with Mr. Foley, have been told by the 
Washington Democrat that he is heterosexual. He has been married for 20 years."

CHERNOBYL REACTOR BLEW UP LIKE A BOMB; 
</P>
<P>
CAN'T HAPPEN HERE? IT HAPPENED THERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM SWEET, William Sweet is writer based in New York. This commentary is 
adapted from an article in the June issue of Technology Review. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mikhail S. Gorbachev is reported this week to be visibly frustrated by the 
uncanny series of natural, man-made and man-aggravated disasters that have 
plagued his country during his regime. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, even as news arrives of the latest catastrophe -- a natural gas 
explosion in which nearly 500 are dead or missing -- troubling evidence from 
previous disasters continues to accumulate, posing more challenges to 
Gorbachev's perestroika program. The latest findings about the Chernobyl 
nuclear disaster strongly suggest that about 15 Chernobyl-type reactors in the 
Soviet Union should be shut down. 
</P>
<P>
Last year I started to investigate the Chernobyl disaster, inspired by some of 
the procedures Caltech physicist Richard Feynman devised as a member of a 
presidential commission looking into the Challenger accident. Shortly before 
his death early last year, Feynman described how he had discovered, during a 
visit to a NASA facility in Huntsville, Ala., that NASA engineers considered a 
space shuttle catastrophe a near statistical certainty before the disaster 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
Editing a version of Feynman's account for a physics magazine, it occurred to 
me that it might be interesting to ask the leading experts on Chernobyl in the 
United States how likely they considered another Chernobyl-like accident. 
During the next year I interviewed top people at the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission, the Department of Energy, their counterparts in Canada and 
specialists in the academic world, industry and government laboratories. The 
results were disconcerting. 
</P>
<P>
The standard explanation for Chernobyl has been that a steam explosion 
destroyed the reactor, suggesting that it was like a pot boiling over on your 
stove or, at worst, a pressure-cooker mishap that put a mess of radioactive pea 
soup on your ceiling. In fact, the reactor blew up like an atomic bomb. It of 
course did not blow up with the full efficiency or force of an atomic bomb, but 
the physical processes that blew up the reactor were the same forces that cause 
a bomb to explode. Moreover, the corrective measures taken by the Soviets do 
not preclude an equally severe accident and some of the measures may make an 
accident more rather than less likely. 
</P>
<P>
I first got an inkling of what happened at Chernobyl during an interview with 
Richard Wilson, a reactor expert at Harvard who has visited Chernobyl twice. 
When I asked Wilson to comment on a description of the accident as a "slow 
nuclear explosion," expecting him to pooh-pooh the claim, he said: "To ever say 
it was not a nuclear explosion is just plain wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The Chernobyl reactors have the unfortunate defect of speeding up, under 
certain conditions, rather than slowing down when water is lost. Compounding 
this defect, the top of the reactor is poorly sealed, so that surprisingly 
little excess pressure will rupture the lid. As a result, a loss of water could 
cause nuclear reactions to go out of control, generating enough pressure to 
blow up the reactor vessel and release large quantities of radioactive material 
into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately before the accident on the night of April 25-26, 1986, the plant's 
operators were preparing to do an unusual test, after which they planned to 
shut the reactor down for annual maintenance and refueling. They took a series 
of reckless measures that put the reactor into its most unstable state, 
unleashing an uncontrolled and uncontrollable nuclear reaction. "Once power 
began to rise rapidly," says Edward Purvis, head of the Department of Energy's 
study team, "nothing could have been done to stop it." 
</P>
<P>
In just a second or two, this first explosion sent the reactor's power soaring 
from close to zero to between 50 and 100 times the plant's maximum normal 
capacity. This was an enormously more violent event than had ever been 
described or imagined in the voluminous U.S. literature on reactor safety. 
</P>
<P>
Eyewitness accounts and Soviet computer analyses strongly suggest that there 
was a second explosion, perhaps 10 times more violent than the first. While 
interpretations vary, the most plausible is that the severely damaged core 
collapsed on itself, formed a critical mass or several critical masses and blew 
up like a bomb. This explosion "completed the destruction of Chernobyl Unit 4," 
Purvis says. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Denton, the former Nuclear Regulatory Commission safety chief who 
managed emergency operations at Three Mile Island in 1979, said that he and his 
colleagues worried at that time that a nuclear explosion could take place. But 
they brought in consultants who concluded that TMI's molten core could not form 
a critical mass and explode. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to assess the probability of another catastrophic accident at a 
Chernobyl-type reactor, Denton said: "We would not license such a reactor 
here." 
</P>
<P>
For decades, spokesmen for the nuclear industry have insisted that reactors 
cannot blow up like bombs. But the Chernobyl reactor did blow up like a bomb, 
and a similar accident is remotely conceivable in Canada's reactors. Perhaps 
industry spokesmen should have said that most reactors, or all reactors in the 
United States, cannot blow up like bombs. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Gale, the UCLA bone marrow specialist who flew to the Soviet Union to 
help Chernobyl victims, has said he believes that Chernobyl was the catalytic 
event that prompted Gorbachev to launch his bold arms-control initiatives. If 
Chernobyl had been a mere steam explosion brought on mainly by operator error, 
Gale's view of things would make little sense. But it makes good sense if 
Gorbachev understood the accident to have been a nuclear explosion that 
created, on a small scale, the devastated landscape that we would have on a 
grand scale in the wake of an all-out nuclear war.

STATE SCHOOL FORMULA IS OUT OF LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT NOLAN, Pat Nolan (R-Glendale) is the chairman of the state Assembly 
Republican Task Force on Education Reform. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I first heard the terms of the settlement of the L.A. School strike, I was 
flabbergasted. Where did Los Angeles find the money to give their teachers a 
24% hike? 
</P>
<P>
I wondered how the L.A. schools could possibly manage their money so much 
better than other districts. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, I discovered that they don't manage their money any better. In fact, they 
don't have to. 
</P>
<P>
The reason they don't have to manage their money better is simple: The Los 
Angeles schools get a lot more money per student than any of the surrounding 
school districts. 
</P>
<P>
While the state has pumped billions of new dollars into education in the last 
few years, these additional billions have been unequally distributed. Some 
districts receive far more to spend on their children than others do. 
</P>
<P>
How did this unfair situation develop? 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the large, powerful urban districts used their political muscle to 
rig the funding formulas to get an unfair share of education dollars. They 
channeled more of the education budget into their special-interest programs 
called "categoricals," from which they take almost all the money. This leaves a 
smaller percentage of the education funding available for the basic education 
programs that are funded equally for all districts through the traditional "per 
student" mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
While the categorical programs were established for noble purposes, taken as a 
whole they have terribly distorted the way education dollars are distributed. 
Some children are shortchanged while others have money heaped on them. As a 
result of this distortion, the amount spent per pupil is now even more unequal 
than when the court first ordered the state to equalize school funding more 
than a decade ago. Let's look at some examples. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles schools get $1,045 per student in categorical funding while 
Glendale gets only $194 per pupil and Pomona gets only $484. 
</P>
<P>
The figure in San Jose is $1,346, which amounts to $1,152 more per child than 
Glendale and $862 more per child then Pomona. Put another way, a high school 
with 2,000 students in San Jose receives about $2 million more than the same 
size high school in Glendale or Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
The same is true for almost all the districts in the state. Los Angeles gets 
$581 more than the average district statewide. And San Jose gets $882 more. 
</P>
<P>
But, you may ask, "Don't Los Angeles and San Jose need more money because they 
have larger numbers of poor people, and don't many of their students speak 
little or no English?" Sadly, the facts undercut this argument. Glendale has 5% 
more limited-English pupils than Los Angeles, yet gets $851 less per student in 
categorical funding. Pomona has even more poor families than Los Angeles and 
14% more than San Jose, but Pomona received $561 less per pupil than Los 
Angeles and $862 less than San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
This unfair distribution didn't come about by accident. 
</P>
<P>
The funding formulas have been manipulated in several ways to achieve this 
unfair distribution. 
</P>
<P>
Arbitrary limits were placed on the allocations for some of the categorical 
programs so that districts that already have them get first call on the money. 
As a result, money allocated for these programs goes to districts that have 
previously received it and nothing is left over for any additional district 
whose students also meet the criteria. 
</P>
<P>
The formulas for determining eligibility for some categorical programs are 
completely out of date. The districts that are already receiving the money have 
blocked attempts to update the formulas to reflect changes in student 
population. By doing this they have prevented districts with just as many needy 
children from getting the funds. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the criteria were established in a totally arbitrary way. Programs with 
names that sound praiseworthy are really thinly disguised ways that districts 
with politically powerful legislators can direct extra money into their own 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
Some formulas aren't based on assessment of need at all, but are instead simply 
an additional percentage of the total district budget. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, districts that are already getting more then their fair share 
get even more money, while the remainder are locked into receiving a smaller 
share. Many legislators are appalled at this unfairness and we have proposed a 
plan to close the gap in the amount spent per student. 
</P>
<P>
We would fund all categorical programs at their present level, but instead of 
further aggravating the disparity in funding levels by adding a percentage 
increase on top of these unfair formulas, we would allocate $397 million to 
bring underfunded districts up toward the statewide average of spending per 
child on these programs. 
</P>
<P>
Our proposal calls for substantial increases for all school districts, large 
and small. The large urban districts would still get the lion's share of our 
education dollars, but for the first time we would be closer to spending equal 
dollars for each pupil. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't it time that we reject the use of political muscle to apportion the 
education budget, and instead give all students equal funding? Our kids 
certainly deserve it.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: FOR BOXING FANS, EVENT OVERSHADOWS PAY-PER-VIEW PRICE

<P>
Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns, who last fought in 1981, are getting 
together again Monday night at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas for what promoter 
Bob Arum is humbly calling, "the War." 
</P>
<P>
The 1981 bout, in which Leonard scored a stunning 14th-round knockout, was 
fought in the early days of pay-per-view television. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, it was available in about 1.5 million homes, and the asking price 
was $15. 
</P>
<P>
The heavily promoted Leonard-Hearns II will be available in about 8 million 
homes, and the asking price is in the $35-$50 range. 
</P>
<P>
A 10% buy rate -- 800,000 homes, the minimum expected -- would generate nearly 
$50 million from pay-per-view television alone. 
</P>
<P>
Throw in another $30 million or so from closed-circuit sales, foreign 
television sales, the live gate at Caesars Palace and various sponsorships, and 
you're talking about a possible record $80-million gross. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for one evening. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, there are two franchise areas for distribution of the 
fight telecast. 
</P>
<P>
One area covers seven counties, from Santa Barbara and Ventura through Los 
Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside and Imperial. The other area is San 
Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance-based Choice Entertainment, which is owned by Rick Kulis, is the 
distributor for the seven-county area. The San Diego Cable Sports Network will 
distribute the fight in its area. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-eight cable systems representing 1.2 million homes will service the 
seven-county franchise, where the asking price is now $39.95. It will go as 
high as $49.95 on some systems Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The price in San Diego County is now $34.95, and goes to $39.95 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Is the fight overpriced? 
</P>
<P>
Kulis, who put up a $2-million guarantee and will spend another $500,000 on 
advertising and promotions, said: "We've learned that the price is not a major 
factor in selling pay-per-view fights. The attraction is what counts, and this 
fight has general interest beyond just fight fans. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize that groups of people get together and share the cost. That's fine 
with us. We encourage it." 
</P>
<P>
Will prices continue to escalate for future pay-per-view fights? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think so," Kulis said. "I think we've hit a leveling off point." 
</P>
<P>
Don't count on it, though. 
</P>
<P>
For those who can't get the fight on cable television, Choice Entertainment has 
put together a network of 53 closed-circuit locations. The admission fee is $35 
in most places. 
</P>
<P>
Closed-circuit locations include such places as the Registry Hotel in Universal 
City, P.J. Brett's in Hermosa Beach, the Palace in Hollywood, the Ramada Hotel 
in Beverly Hills, the Four-Star Theater and Vertigo in Los Angeles, Legends and 
the Ramada Renaissance in Long Beach, the State Theater in Pasadena, the 
Holiday Inn in Ventura, the National Orange Show in San Bernardino, Don 
Enrique's in Santa Monica and Harry C's in Riverside and Rancho Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
For other locations, check newspaper ads. 
</P>
<P>
Because cable is more predominant in San Diego County, there are no 
closed-circuit locations in that area. 
</P>
<P>
Kulis said that Choice Entertainment will have a security force of about 120 
off-duty police officers looking for bars showing the fight without 
authorization. 
</P>
<P>
"We are calling around to see what bars are planning to show the fight," Kulis 
said. "If whoever answers the phone says, yes, the fight will be shown, we 
issue an injunction to the owner. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we will go to the establishment Monday night, and if the fight is on, we 
will turn off the fight, and the owner will be notified that he is in violation 
of the injunction and will be subject to a fine of between $10,000 and $50,000, 
plus proven damages." 
</P>
<P>
Several cable companies are joining Choice in its anti-piracy campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Top Rank, the promoter of the fight, is doing its part by using a high-tech, 
pirate-proof system to scramble and unscramble the signal. 
</P>
<P>
Says Arum, Top Rank president: "If you want to see the fight, you're going to 
have to pay for it. It's as simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
Monday night's undercard, a good one, is scheduled to begin at 6 p.m. It 
features four Olympic gold medalists -- featherweight Kennedy McKinney, 
welterweight Robert Wangila, light heavyweight Andrew Maynard and heavyweight 
Ray Mercer -- and Olympic flyweight silver medalist Michael Carbajal in 
separate six-rounders. 
</P>
<P>
The main event is scheduled to begin about 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the fight will be Tim Ryan and Gil Glancy of CBS, with Marvin Hagler 
scheduled to join them at ringside. The hosts of the telecasts will be Channel 
7's Jim Hill and ESPN's Al Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Duran will be a guest commentator on the Spanish-language telecast. 
</P>
<P>
A ton of prefight programming is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday at 5 p.m., ESPN will televise a 30-minute special on the fight from 
Caesars Palace, and the 1981 Leonard-Hearns fight will be shown on "SuperBouts" 
at 5:30 p.m. ESPN is also planning to cover the postfight press conference. 
</P>
<P>
CNN offers a half-hour special, "Sugar Ray and the Hitman," Saturday night at 
6. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 4 is going to carry a one-hour syndicated show, "Leonard-Hearns II: The 
War," Saturday night at 7. And Fox Television's "Reporters" program Saturday at 
8:30 p.m. will have a Leonard segment. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
Attention, CBS director Sandy Grossman: Congratulations on a much better 
telecast of Game 2 of the NBA Finals than of Game 1. Gone were those terrible 
behind-the-basket camera angles. But, please, get rid of that overhead camera. 
. . . A reminder to viewers: Those black bands the Lakers and Pistons are 
wearing on their jerseys are in honor of Larry Fleisher, founder of the NBA 
players' union, who died recently. . . . Game 1 Tuesday night got a Nielsen 
rating of 24.9 in Los Angeles, but it didn't win the night. ABC's "Roseanne" 
drew a 27.1. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN, in its 10th year of televising the College World Series, is doing another 
outstanding job. CBS takes over Saturday, televising the title game at 10 a.m., 
with Brent Musburger and Joe Morgan reporting. . . . Speaking of Musburger, it 
became official earlier this week. He and Tim McCarver will be the lead 
baseball announcers for CBS, beginning next season. Ric LaCivita earlier was 
named lead producer. 
</P>
<P>
A syndicated special on horse racing's Triple Crown, with Jim McKay, will be 
carried by Channel 56 tonight at 6:30. The Belmont will be on ABC Saturday, 
coverage to begin at 1:30 p.m., the race to go about 2:30. . . . Marvin Bader, 
longtime head of Olympic operations for ABC, has been named to a similar post 
by NBC. . . . NBC has given longtime announcer Charlie Jones a multiyear 
extension on his contract. . . . Len Berman's annual Sports Fantasies special 
will be shown on NBC's "SportsWorld" Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday's "SportsWorld," which begins at 2 p.m., will be coverage of a 
junior welterweight fight between Vinny Pazienza and Vinny Burgese at Atlantic 
City, N.J. . . . Before "SportsWorld," NBC will show Roy Jones Jr.'s first TV 
fight as a pro. Jones was the victim of one of the worst judging decisions in 
Olympic boxing history. The judges in Seoul gave the light-middleweight gold 
medal to a badly outclassed Korean, Park Si Hun. Jones fights Stephan Johnson, 
also at Atlantic City. Both of the NBC fights will be shown delayed, even 
though some ads tout the bouts as live. . . . The ring announcer for the 
Atlantic City card is Jimmy Lennon Jr., 30-year-old son of the famed ring 
announcer. Jimmy Jr. is a psychology and photography teacher at L.A. Baptist 
High School in West L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Vin Scully no doubt shattered sportscasting records last Saturday with his 
32-inning day, but he did get a break, if you can call it that. Scully, after 
working 10 innings for NBC in St. Louis, took three innings off during the 
Dodgers' 22-inning game in Houston to tape some Dodger promos. During those 
innings, Ross Porter did a radio-TV simulcast. Porter worked 17 innings, with 
Scully doing a simulcast for five innings. Both Scully and Porter deserve 
kudos.

Tom Sieckmann had to settle for a birdie on his final hole but shot a 
seven-under-par 64 to take a one-stroke lead Thursday in the first round of the 
Westchester golf tournament at Harrison, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Sieckmann missed a 15-foot eagle putt before taking his two-putt birdie-four. 
</P>
<P>
Rocco Mediate chipped in on No. 18 for an eagle-three in a round of 65 that 
left him in scond place. 
</P>
<P>
Tied for third at 66 were Mark Lye, Fred Couples, Kenny Knox, Craig Stadler and 
Dick Mast. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Palmer said a new grip helped him shoot a 67 that tied him with five 
others for the lead after one round of the Senior Tournament Players 
Championship at Ponte Vedra, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Orville Moody, Butch Baird, Lou Graham, Tom Shaw and Dick Howell matched 
Palmer's five-under-par round over the 6,646-yard TPC at Sawgrass Valley. The 
leaders are a stroke ahead of Miller Barber, Gary Player, Jim Ferree, Jimmy 
Powell and George Lanning. 
</P>
<P>
A computer error discovered in the midst of a rain delay moved Myra Blackwelder 
into the lead through 16 holes of the first round of the $400,000 Pat Bradley 
tournament at High Point, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
More than an hour after the second of two rain delays, the round was suspended. 
It will be concluded this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Before the rain, Diane Heinicke-Rauch was listed as the leader with 16 points. 
When the mistake was found, Blackwelder was credited with 19 points.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

PIRATES GET 10 IN FIRST, BUT PHILLIES RALLY, 15-11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Jeltz couldn't believe he had hit two home runs. But then, Thursday night 
was a night for the unbelievable in Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Pittsburgh Pirates, who opened the game with their biggest inning in 47 
years, became the second team to blow a 10-run lead this week, losing to the 
Philadelphia Phillies, 15-11. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Bonds hit a three-run homer, and Andy Van Slyke and Gary Redus had two 
hits each as the Pirates scored 10 runs in the first. 
</P>
<P>
But Philadelphia came back. Von Hayes homered twice and drove in four runs. 
Jeltz, whose May 21 home run was his first in five years and 1,357 at-bats, 
homered twice to drive in five runs. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 11-10, Philadelphia scored five runs in the eighth. The Phillies tied 
the game on Jeff Robinson's wild pitch with a runner on third. Darren Daulton 
then hit a two-run single, and Curt Ford followed with a two-run triple. 
</P>
<P>
Jeltz, who batted .187 last season, didn't even start. Down by 10 runs in the 
first, Phillie Manager Nick Leyva simply wanted to rest second baseman Tom 
Herr, who has a sore foot. 
</P>
<P>
The Toronto Blue Jays came back from a 10-0 first-inning deficit last Sunday to 
beat the Boston Red Sox, 13-11, in 12 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 3, San Francisco 2 -- Craig Lefferts' wild pitch with the bases 
loaded in the bottom of the eighth inning allowed the Reds' Barry Larkin to 
score the winning run at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Lefferts relieved Mike LaCoss with two runners on base and a two-ball count on 
Dave Collins in the eighth. After walking Collins to load the bases, he got 
Paul O'Neill to pop up. But his second pitch to Bo Diaz bounced in the dirt and 
eluded catcher Terry Kennedy as Barry Larkin raced in from third. 
</P>
<P>
Lefferts took the throw from Kennedy but was unable to make the tag on the 
sliding Larkin. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 7, San Diego 6 -- Glenn Davis hit a two-run home run in the 10th inning 
as the Astros beat the Padres at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
With Houston trailing, 6-5, Gerald Young led off the Houston 10th with a walk 
and moved to second on a ground ball. Davis hit his 14th homer of the season 
for the Astros' 18th one-run win of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 5, New York 4 -- Rick Wrona's squeeze bunt in the 10th inning lifted 
the Cubs past the Mets at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd McClendon reached first base with one out in the 10th on shortstop Jeff 
McKnight's fielding error. Curtis Wilkerson singled off Don Aase for his fourth 
hit of the game, and Shawon Dunston was hit by a pitch, loading the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Wrona bunted between the mound and first, and McClendon beat first baseman Dave 
Magadan's throw to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 7, Montreal 2 -- Pedro Guerrero drove in three runs, including a 
go-ahead RBI single, and the Cardinals scored five runs in the ninth inning at 
Montreal to beat the Expos, 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero's two-run triple in the first was the only hit allowed by Kevin Gross 
through the first eight innings.

CAMARILLO PAIR SELECTED IN LATE ROUNDS OF DRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Infielders Scott Cline and Charlie Fiacco of UCLA and Camarillo High have been 
selected in baseball's amateur draft despite injury-shortened senior seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Cline was selected in the 26th round by the Milwaukee Brewers, and the Chicago 
Cubs made Fiacco a 36th-round pick. Cline sustained knee and wrist injuries 
this spring and batted .295 in limited action for UCLA. He finished his college 
career with a .313 average, 24 home runs and 130 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Fiacco, who missed the last 18 games of the season after undergoing knee 
surgery, batted .320 and led the Bruins in home runs (seven) and RBIs (38). 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame High's Chris Lohman was selected in the 56th round by Oakland, 
Newbury Park High's Danny Madsen was taken by Texas in an unspecified late 
round and Rod Stillwell of Arkansas and Thousand Oaks High was taken in an 
unspecified late round by Kansas City. Rod's brother, Kurt, plays shortstop for 
the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
Lohman, an outfielder, batted .472 with 35 RBIs and 15 stolen bases. Madsen, a 
catcher who batted .372 with a school-record 36 RBIs, said he will probably not 
sign and will play at Ventura College.

FORMER CS NORTHRIDGE QUARTERBACK CHRIS PARKER EARNS A SHOT WITH THE RAMS AFTER 
STOPS IN TWO FOREIGN LEAGUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If he hadn't thought he'd look awfully silly, Chris Parker, 24, might have 
pinched himself. 
</P>
<P>
 He tried to keep a hold on reality as he trotted up to the center and bent 
over to take the snap. He tried to concentrate on the job at hand, but his mind 
kept wandering. He was supposed to be looking over the defense, but all he 
seemed able to flash on was their helmets. And those of the offensive line 
immediately in front of him. And the one he was wearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in Southern California, it was a helmet he had seen often, but only 
from afar. Emblazoned across it were the distinctive horns of the Los Angeles 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "What am I doing here?" he asked himself. 
</P>
<P>
 What indeed? 
</P>
<P>
Parker could hardly be classified as a blue-chip recruit. After playing mostly 
as a defensive back at St. Thomas Aquinas High in San Bernardino County, he 
enrolled at Saddleback College in Orange County, where he played both free 
safety and quarterback. But not much of either. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't feel," he said, "that I was given an opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
So the next year, he moved to San Bernardino Valley College, where he beat out 
the competition to finally become a starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Onward and upward. But to where? 
</P>
<P>
His choice of a four-year school came down to Cal State Northridge, in Division 
II of the NCAA, or the University of New Mexico, a Division I program. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was that Parker didn't hear from New Mexico until the week before 
school started. He was contacted on a Thursday and would have been required to 
start classes the following Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did you wait so long?" he asked a New Mexico official. 
</P>
<P>
"We just overlooked you," Parker was told. 
</P>
<P>
His parents, Ted and Jane, pushed for Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"You can be a big fish in a little pond," Parker's father told him. "What's 
worth more to you, to say you played at a big school or to say you played?" 
</P>
<P>
Parker headed for the little pond. But even there, he hardly arrived with a big 
splash. It was more like a dash of cold water in the face when he got his first 
look at the depth chart. Among quarterbacks, Parker was listed fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"Wow," he told himself, "welcome to big-time football." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunched over the center, Parker, 6-foot-1, 194 pounds, looked down the line, 
first to the left, then to the right. "I'm about to run a play for the Los 
Angeles Rams," he told himself. "Nobody here is going to do anything until I 
call the cadence. Everything is waiting on me. This is pretty neat." 
</P>
<P>
 He clapped his wrists together and, in a loud voice, barked out the signals. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker wasn't fifth on the CSUN depth chart for long. Coach Tom Keele was 
installing a radical new offense, the run-and-shoot, and he decided Parker was 
the guy to do the running and shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tough," Parker said of an offense based on the ability to improvise at 
the line of scrimmage. "You had to read the defense and the receiver had to 
read the defense and go from there. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, it sounds kind of funny, but it was a shock to me because I never 
did that before. Throughout high school and junior college, I had never been 
taught to read a defense." 
</P>
<P>
Because the quarterback and the receiver in the run-and-shoot have to operate 
on the same page in order to come to the same conclusion without benefit of a 
huddle, it helps if they have more than a passing acquaintance with each other. 
</P>
<P>
That was not the case when Parker took over at Northridge in 1985, but he still 
did well enough in his first season to rewrite a few pages in the CSUN record 
book. 
</P>
<P>
Parker completed 232 of 424 passes for 2,658 yards and 19 touchdowns. The 
attempts and completions, along with the 2,773 yards in total offense he 
generated, were school records. As a punter, Parker averaged 40.6 yards and one 
of his 48 punts traveled 72 yards. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, Keele was gone and so was the run-and-shoot. Bob Burt, the new 
Matador coach, went back to the conventional I-formation and, although Parker's 
numbers dropped, the number in the all-important win column went up. Parker 
passed just 158 times, completing 81 for 1,167 yards and a dozen touchdowns. He 
also punted 44 times for 1,763 yards (40.1 average). But CSUN's record improved 
from 4-7 to 8-3 and the Matadors came within one minute in their final 
conference game of claiming the Western Football Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
Parker's collegiate career was over, but not, he hoped, his football career. 
Coming out of Northridge, he didn't figure to get much of a look from the 
National Football League, so he opted for the Canadian Football League and drew 
some interest from the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the spring of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I pretty much neglected everyone else," Parker said, "and put all my eggs in 
one basket." 
</P>
<P>
That turned out to be an ill-fated move because Parker's chances proved as 
fragile as an egg shell. Winnipeg turned thumbs down on him and he wound up 
working at a Woodland Hills health club. 
</P>
<P>
But not for long. Parker signed a contract with the London Capitals of the 
European Football League and spent the summer leading that club to the 
semifinals of the EFL's postseason tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Then, back home, back at the health club, back without much of an apparent 
future in the pro game in this country, Parker crossed paths with Tony 
Maddocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The football felt secure in Parker's hands as he took the center snap. Fading 
back, he was all business. Too much to worry about now than to luxuriate in his 
surroundings. He waited until running back Robert Delpino ran his route, 
watching the onrushing defense out of the corner of his eye. It was one of the 
easier throws he had ever been asked to make, just a short 10-yard 
down-and-out. Only the circumstances made it difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddocks was a former receiver at Long Beach State who had had a cup of coffee 
with the Rams a decade ago as a free agent. Actually, it turned out to be more 
like a sip of coffee. Maddocks broke a foot in a preseason scrimmage and never 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
Now a Valley businessman and a customer of the health club, Maddocks overheard 
Parker talking about his quarterback aspirations and asked if he wanted to go 
out and throw the football around sometime. 
</P>
<P>
Parker was faced with a moment of truth. He had kept telling himself he was 
good enough to play in the NFL, but, suddenly, here he was faced with a man who 
could tell him how good he really was, a man who had caught footballs thrown by 
people like Vince Ferragamo and Pat Haden. 
</P>
<P>
After they were finished playing catch, the young quarterback nervously asked, 
"Do I throw as hard as NFL guys?" 
</P>
<P>
Parker wasn't just looking for a pat on the back. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was good," Parker said, "but maybe I thought I was better than I 
really was. I needed someone else to tell me that I had the arm strength and 
that I was right up with some NFL quarterbacks." 
</P>
<P>
Maddocks' reply caused Parker's heart to leap. 
</P>
<P>
"You remind me of Vince Ferragamo," Maddocks said. "You have the dark 
complexion. You're good-looking. You have a great arm and you understand 
football. You have the ability. It's just a matter of showing what you can do. 
There are thousands of great athletes looking for the chance, just like you 
are. But once you have the opportunity, you have to do it." 
</P>
<P>
It was Maddocks who wound up getting Parker that opportunity. Last January, he 
invited Parker to an annual flag football game that Maddocks and his old 
friends play every year on Super Bowl Sunday. In attendance was Maddocks' old 
high school coach, Billy White. White, who was impressed with Parker, knows 
Dick Coury, the Rams' quarterback coach. 
</P>
<P>
White made a call and before he knew it, Parker had a call of his own, from the 
Rams. Could he come to Rams Park in three days for a tryout? 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it," Parker said. "I was so nervous because I hadn't done 
anything in a while. I hadn't thrown a football in two weeks and I hadn't 
punted since the previous August." 
</P>
<P>
Parker was supposed to show up March 6. Rather than ask for a delay, he did. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't worry about it," he said. "To heck with the nervousness. Hopefully, 
I would not be that rusty." 
</P>
<P>
With about six coaches watching, Parker threw 50 balls, punted six times and 
was told to come into Coury's office. 
</P>
<P>
Parker figured, or rather hoped, that he would be asked back for another look. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, however, had something else in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got a strong arm and a good release," Coury told him. "We'd like to 
offer you a contract." 
</P>
<P>
Parker tried to stay cool, but somewhere in his head, bells were ringing and 
firecrackers exploding. 
</P>
<P>
He signed a one-year deal with no guarantee and, two months later, found 
himself in the team's off-season mini-camp, playing with people he had only 
seen on television and running an offense he had only seen in his dreams. 
</P>
<P>
"He's kind of refreshing to work with," Maddocks said. "Anything can happen 
once you get out there. Being a free agent is not an easy row to hoe, but he 
knows now he has the ability. I feel like I'm almost living out my own dreams 
of 10 years ago through him." 
</P>
<P>
Those dreams are still far from reality. The Rams have veteran quarterbacks in 
starter Jim Everett and backup Mark Herrmann. Additionally, they drafted Jeff 
Carlson out of Weber State. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a long shot," Parker said. "Everybody knows that. That's just common 
sense. But I can also be a backup punter and they've been having me hold on 
kicks, which I think is great. The more I can do, the more they are going to 
need me. And if I do get released, hopefully, somebody else will have seen me. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I'm still so overwhelmed just to be there. I'm shocked when I think 
about the roads I had to go to get there -- through high school, two junior 
colleges and a Division II school. I have always taken the long way around. So 
I'm still walking on cloud nine. Even if I don't make it, this is really 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker lofted the ball in a smooth arc. Softly, it landed in the waiting hands 
of Delpino, who turned and headed upfield. Parker tried to control his elation. 
It was just a play run in mini-camp, but to Chris Parker, it might as well have 
been the Super Bowl.

VERSATILE ROLE SUITS NEDIN AT FLORIDA STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Nedin never sank into the depths of depression this season, despite being 
victimized by the depth of the Florida State pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
Nedin, a junior left-hander who transferred from College of the Canyons, has 
performed in both relief and starting roles for the Seminoles, the top-seeded 
team in the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if I went to another school that didn't have a pitching staff as deep 
as ours, I could have thrown 140-150 innings," Nedin said. "Sometimes it's hard 
with the staff we have because we have eight guys that can start. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're here and we have a chance to win the national championship. I just 
hope I get a chance to contribute." 
</P>
<P>
Nedin pitched one inning of scoreless relief Wednesday during Florida State's 
7-4 loss to Wichita State. He will be in the bullpen again tonight when the 
Seminoles meet Wichita State in a game that will determine the East Division 
representative in Saturday's national championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Clyde Keller (13-0, 115 innings) and junior Gar Finnvold (10-4, 135 
innings) have been the principal starters for the Seminoles and are the only 
pitchers who have logged more than 90 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Nedin, who is 6-5 with a 3.16 earned-run average, went from reliever to starter 
to reliever this season. The former Hart High standout has still managed 92 
strikeouts and 37 walks in 78 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't mixed my pitches well at all and that's what cost me a little this 
year," said Nedin, who throws a fastball, slider, changeup and knucklecurve. 
</P>
<P>
Control problems with the knucklecurve have been a particular source of 
frustration for Nedin, who has hit eight batters and thrown 11 wild pitches. 
</P>
<P>
"I live and die with that pitch," Nedin said. "It's one of those pitches you 
either have it that day or you don't. 
</P>
<P>
"I've hit a lot of people with that pitch, that's what killed me. I can't even 
count how many times I've done that with the count 0-2." 
</P>
<P>
Nedin, who was selected in the 21st round of the amateur draft by the Minnesota 
Twins, knew nothing about struggling at the beginning of the season. 
</P>
<P>
He compiled an 18-2 record at Canyons, and in his first appearance for Florida 
State, he earned a victory against Arizona State by striking out seven during 
seven shutout innings of relief. 
</P>
<P>
Nedin followed that appearance with impressive stints against Grambling and 
Florida and was promoted to the starting rotation after allowing just one run 
in 18 innings. 
</P>
<P>
As a starter, Nedin earned three wins in eight starts, including a 
complete-game victory over Southern Mississippi. However, after he lasted just 
one-third of an inning against Miami on April 8, Nedin returned to the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
"Timmy seems to respond better right now in his career as a middle reliever," 
Florida State Coach Mike Martin said. "That does not pencil him as a middle 
reliever for next year because we're going to be looking for another starter 
and Timmy Nedin would fit that role very well."

DIMARCO'S ABLE STABLE CORRALS 2 MAJOR TITLES

<P>
For someone who calls coaching a "throw-away profession" and who would like to 
"get the hell out of it," Charlie DiMarco of Northridge has had a great deal of 
success recently. 
</P>
<P>
Two of his proteges -- Walt Stewart of Cal State Northridge and Crissy Mills of 
Campbell Hall -- have won major high jump titles in the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, a junior, won the NCAA Division II title with a leap of 7 feet, 1/2 
inch at Hampton, Va., on May 26, and Mills, a junior at the private high school 
in North Hollywood, won her second consecutive state championship with a 
personal-best jump of 6 feet at Cerritos College in Norwalk a week later. 
</P>
<P>
"The last two weeks have been very satisfying," DiMarco said. "It's nice to see 
your jumpers perform well in the big meets, to see them take what you worked on 
in practice and put it to use in competition." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his success, DiMarco has no intention of making coaching, or as he 
prefers to call it "consulting," a lifetime occupation. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see myself doing this for the rest of my life," said DiMarco, who has 
a full-time job at On Track, a track and field equipment manufacturer and 
distributor in Glendale. "There's just not enough money involved . . . . But it 
seems like I say that every year. I thought 1988 was going to be my last 
season, but then I decided to coach Crissy until the end of high school, which 
means 1990." 
</P>
<P>
After that, DiMarco projects that Mills will accept a college scholarship and 
get a new coach. However, Mills has hinted that she wants to stay in the area 
after her high school career so that DiMarco can coach her at the collegiate 
level. 
</P>
<P>
"She's an incredibly gifted athlete," he said. "It's just a matter of her 
continuing to improve her technique and strength." 
</P>
<P>
DiMarco, a pole vaulter who posted bests of 13-6 at Marshall High in 1976 and 
14-10 at Valley College two years later, was the field events coach at Valley 
from 1979-83 and at Cal State Northridge from 1984-86. 
</P>
<P>
At Northridge, he coached Dave Stephens, the 1984 NCAA Division II javelin 
champion and winner of last year's Olympic Trials. 
</P>
<P>
DiMarco's success created problems, however. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people would come to me and ask for help," DiMarco said. "And my 
natural reaction would be to help them. If someone asks me a question and I 
have knowledge about the subject, I'm going to tell them what I know." 
</P>
<P>
The problems arose because many of the people seeking DiMarco's advice were 
high school athletes, and as a college coach, he would be violating NCAA rules 
by coaching them. 
</P>
<P>
So he resigned his position at CSUN and formed Advantage Athletics, a 
Northridge-based club. 
</P>
<P>
The move allowed him to independently coach Northridge jumpers such as Stewart 
and Ken Burke, while also dealing with high school athletes like Mills. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a good move," DiMarco said. "I don't have the patience to deal with 
all the politics of coaching at the collegiate level. The club has given me the 
chance to form my own little world of track and field. I have it just the way I 
want it." 
</P>
<P>
Statwatch: Russell White of Crespi High and Todd Lewis of Burbank failed to win 
titles in the triple jump and 1,600 meters, respectively, at the state 
championships last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But both athletes turned in top performances nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
White, who placed third in the triple jump at 48 feet, 7 inches, bounded a 
Valley-area record of 50-6 in qualifying on Friday. Lewis finished third in the 
1,600 Saturday, but clocked a personal best of 4 minutes, 9.02 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' time converts to a 4:10.47 mile, the fastest by a Valley-area runner 
since Agoura's Jon Stormo ran 4:10.2 in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
As swift as Lewis' time is, however, it ranks only second on the all-time 
Burbank list to John Musich, who ran 4:08.9 in 1974. Don Moses of Crescenta 
Valley set the Valley-area record of 4:08.5 in 1976.

Money Supply Rises: A broad measure of the nation's money supply rose in the 
week ended May 29, the Federal Reserve Board reported. The Fed said the measure 
known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $3,077.1 billion from $3,072.6 
billion the previous week. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose 
to a seasonally adjusted $773.9 billion from $772.3 billion. M1 includes cash 
in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 
is M1 plus accounts such as savings deposits and money market mutual funds.

Carl Karcher Enterprises: First-quarter profit was $5.7 million, down from $6.7 
million from a year ago. The Anaheim-based owner and franchiser of Carl's Jr. 
restaurants said income declined as a result of the company repurchasing and 
retiring nearly 25% of its outstanding shares in August, 1988. For the quarter 
ended May 22, revenues rose 21% to $148.9 million.

 Maxwell Laboratories' board of directors has unanimously rejected an 
unsolicited $17-a-share cash merger offer by JAYCOR, a private, San Diego-based 
defense contractor, the company said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell's board determined that the "highly conditional" merger offer would not 
serve "the best interests of the stockholders," according to a prepared 
release. Maxwell, which develops high-tech products for the defense and 
commercial markets, closed down 25 cents at $14 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell's financial and legal advisers determined that the $17-per-share offer 
was "inadequate and otherwise on unacceptable terms," the company said. 
Maxwell's board also determined that shareholders would be best served by 
"Maxwell's continuing as an independent public entity now and in the 
foreseeable future." 
</P>
<P>
Neither company was available to elaborate on the merger offer Thursday.

ISAAC ASIMOV: COLD FUSION: SCIENCE FICTION OR REALITY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Isaac Asimov 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The current controversy over cold fusion is a very exciting example of science 
in progress. Some investigations confirm it; other investigations don't. There 
is excitement on one side, denunciation on the other. Is that the way science 
works? Loud squabbling? Angry accusations and rebuttals? 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, yes. There have been numerous cases of this sort of thing in the 
past, and we can outline a few. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1894, American astronomer Percival Lowell examined Mars 
assiduously at an observatory he built in the Arizona desert. It seemed to him 
that he saw the surface of Mars covered with thin straight lines, which he 
interpreted as "canals." He was convinced that Mars harbored a highly evolved, 
technologically advanced intelligence that was combating the slow loss of Mars' 
water by using the polar icecaps as a source of irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
Lowell wrote books upholding his thesis, and H. G. Wells used Lowell's 
observations as an inspiration for his popular science-fiction book, "The War 
of the Worlds." The public, excited by the drama, believed in the canals. 
</P>
<P>
However, most astronomers failed to see the canals. The opposition grew 
stronger and stronger and in 1964, close-up photographs of the Martian surface 
by a rocket probe settled the matter. There were no canals! Lowell was fooled 
by markings near the limits of visibility. It was an optical illusion that he 
wanted strongly to believe, but wishing didn't make it so. 
</P>
<P>
Another case. Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen discovered X-rays in 1895 and won 
worldwide fame and a Nobel Prize. Other physicists longed to make similar 
discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
In 1903, a French scientist, Rene P. Blondlot, was convinced he had. He 
reported certain mysterious "N-ray" (N for Nancy, his native city) that were 
very difficult to detect, but that he managed to see. Others excitedly repeated 
his experiments and confirmed them, especially in France. Hundreds of papers 
were churned out about N-rays and all sorts of observations were made as to 
when N-rays were "liberated" and when they were not. 
</P>
<P>
However, most scientists in Great Britain, Germany and the United States failed 
to detect the N-rays and there were occasional recriminations based on national 
prejudice on both sides. An American physicist, Robert W. Wood, visited 
Blondlot's laboratory and was shown the procedures. Wood secretly pocketed an 
essential portion of the detecting device, but the experimenters innocently 
proceeded to detect the N-rays anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Once Wood reported what he had done, the whole N-ray controversy collapsed. 
There is no reason to think Blondlot wasn't sincere. It was just that he wanted 
so much to make a discovery as important as Roentgen's that he saw what he 
wanted to see. However, wishing didn't make it so. 
</P>
<P>
In 1962, a Soviet physicist, Boris V. Deryagin, reported the existence of 
"polywater." This was a new form of water that was found in very thin tubes. 
The molecules were abnormally close together. Polywater was 1.4 times as dense 
as ordinary water, and boiled at 500 C. instead of 100 C. It was all very 
exciting. 
</P>
<P>
Instantly, chemists all over the world began repeating Deryagin's work and 
behold, they found polywater too. Perhaps polywater played an important role 
inside the cell. The excitement was intense. 
</P>
<P>
But then reports filtered out of chemistry laboratories that polywater might be 
ordinary water that had dissolved silicate out of the glass tubes holding it. 
In short, polywater might be impure water. Again, there were investigations 
and, almost at once, the polywater phenomenon collapsed and disappeared. It was 
another case of excitedly plunging for the dramatic -- but wishing didn't make 
it so. 
</P>
<P>
However, that isn't always the case with all dramatic and unbelievable 
discoveries. In 1938, German physicist Otto Hahn, who had been bombarding 
uranium with neutrons, decided the uranium atom was breaking in half (uranium 
fission) but this was so outlandish a notion that he didn't dare report it. 
However, his ex-partner, Lise Meitner, in exile in Sweden for the crime of 
being Jewish, was braver. She reported the possibility and the news was given 
to Niels Bohr, who was on his way to the United States to attend a scientific 
conference. He passed it on to American physicists, who instantly repeated the 
experiments and confirmed the existence of nuclear fission. This time the wild 
and dramatic notion was true. 
</P>
<P>
Well, now which is it to be for cold fusion? After all, if cold fusion really 
exists and can be exploited, it would be an enormous gift to all of humanity. 
Unlimited, clean energy! The will to believe is tremendous. There is the drama 
of 30 years of highly expensive experiments by physicists failing to achieve 
fusion, and then two chemists succeeding on a shoestring. How can we help 
wanting those two to succeed? 
</P>
<P>
However, wishing may not make it so, so we must be cautious.

A Soviet pianist whose father competed against Van Cliburn 31 years ago is 
among six finalists chosen in the Eighth Van Cliburn International Piano 
Competition that wraps up in Ft. Worth, Tex., this weekend. Alexander 
Shtarkman's father, Naum, finished third behind the victorious Cliburn in the 
1958 International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow, a contest that rocketed 
Cliburn to fame. Two other Soviet musicians are also finalists, Elisso Bokvadze 
and Aleksei Sultanov. Other finalists out of a field of 38 that began competing 
May 27 are Jose Carlos Cocarelli of Brazil, Benedetto Lupo of Italy and Ying 
Tian of China. The next step is for each to perform two piano concertos with 
the Ft. Worth Symphony Orchestra before the medalist is chosen Sunday. Kevin 
Kenner, 26, of Coronado, Calif., was the only U.S. semifinalist. ALEENE MacMINN

Holy Pirating, Robin! "Batman" and Warner Bros. have declared war on video 
piracy. When Warner's new "Batman" film opens June 23, every one of the 4,000 
worldwide theatrical prints will bear an identification marking code to enable 
the tracing of illegally duplicated videocassettes. Warner has used this system 
on past releases with positive results. The encoded serial marking -- not 
readily visible -- is detectable in all pirated film-to-video and subsequent 
video-to-video transfers, which allows Warner Bros. and Motion Picture Assn. 
investigators to identify the source of pirated copies. Warner Bros., joined by 
other film companies, has raided more than 3,799 pirate establishments 
worldwide -- 211 in the U.S. alone in the last year. Film piracy may constitute 
a felony with a maximum penalty of up to five years in prison and/or a $250,000 
fine. ALEENE MacMINN

A Brazilian company has beaten out several Hollywood names for the rights to 
film the life of union leader and ecologist Chico Mendes, whose murder last 
December as he stepped out of his modest wooden house in the Amazon town of 
Xapuri focused world attention on the battle to save the Amazon rain forest. JN 
Filmes bought the rights for more than $1 million. Ted Turner, David Puttnam, 
Robert Redford and Paramount Pictures had expressed interest in filming Mendes' 
life story. The decision was made by Mendes' widow Ilzamar with other members 
of the Chico Mendes' Foundation, an organization created by Mendes' family, 
former colleagues and ecologists to continue his campaign to save the Amazon 
rain forests. ALEENE MacMINN

A MERRY ROASTING OF 'BETTE AND BOO'

<P>
Set designer George Suhayda chooses birthday-party colors for Christopher 
Durang's "The Marriage of Bette and Boo" at the San Diego Repertory Theatre. 
Its characters are always celebrating something: a wedding, a birthday, another 
dead baby. 
</P>
<P>
Durang's heroine, Bette (Rosina Widdowson-Reynolds) insists on having babies, 
even though she and her husband Boo (Bernard Baldan) are RH negative -- or did 
the doctor say RH positive? Anyway, Bette knows that it's God's will for her to 
be a mother, because she has always liked children better than she liked 
people. She wants to have a whole orphanage full of them, each named after a 
character in "Winnie-the-Pooh." Wouldn't that be cute? 
</P>
<P>
Since it's Christopher Durang, we can infer an autobiographical element here. 
This is his "Long Day's Journey Into Night," an examination of the people who 
molded him and the forces that molded them. Only, Durang does it as a cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
Good cartoons exaggerate; they don't lie. "Bette and Boo" touches the lunacy of 
"The Bald Soprano," but any veteran of a Catholic household 40 years ago will 
recognize some of its little touches. A birthday cake with a cross planted in 
the middle of it? Not impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Durang must have smiled when he put that in. (Or maybe director Walter Schoen, 
or the designers, or one of the actors, thought of it -- they all seem to have 
gone to school with Sister Mary Ignatius.) Durang knows the mind-set of this 
household by heart: the piety of people who secretly fear, in some cases 
rightly, that they are very vicious. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the younger sister (Sabrina LaRocca) has picked up the notion 
that a saintly person is one who apologizes at all times for everything she 
does. This is at once funny and not so funny, and Durang and actress LaRocca 
show us both sides of it, touching the not-so-funny part only enough to show 
that they recognize it. 
</P>
<P>
Widdowson-Reynolds' Bette almost seems to be getting some kind of revenge on 
God, the way she insists on putting Him through the birth process until he gets 
it right. Bernard Baldan's absent-minded Boo reacts to this by having another 
drink and taking another pledge in front of Father Donnally. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, Father Donnally. You'll love his retreat for "young marrieds," the gist of 
which is that they got themselves into this pickle -- don't come to him. Actor 
Tom Oleniacz plays the good father with a surprising amount of love, plus a 
superfatted Barry Fitzgerald accent. It's clear that everybody in "Bette and 
Boo" goes to the movies at least as often as Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore the Church can't entirely be blamed for their problems, although Matt 
(Patrick Miller), our young narrator and clearly a spokesman for the 
playwright, would dearly love to make that the explanation. Alas, his 
grandmother (the wonderful Priscilla Allen) would probably be a monster in any 
culture, one of those ever-smiling Moms who give you their shoulder to lean on, 
after having carefully kicked out your crutches. 
</P>
<P>
It's not, Durang seems to say, that the Church has screwed up these people. 
They were born that way. The Church only keyed into it. Durang may write like 
an apostate, but he still believes in original sin, and he still, somewhere, 
believes in hope. There's a lovely moment when poor, battered Matt goes to his 
disastrous Grandfather (the excellent William Dennis Hunt), and asks: "What 
should I do with my life?" It's like Red Riding Hood going to the Wolf for 
advice, but the joke is that Grandpa has some: Destroy people, if you feel like 
it, but don't try to change them. 
</P>
<P>
The play abounds with destroyed women, particularly Mary Benson as Grandpa's 
wife. She takes each of his insults with a little hiccup of merriment, like 
Billie Burke -- oh, Dad, you're such a tease, people will think you mean it. 
</P>
<P>
As a family comedy, "Bette and Boo" is one of the darkest ones around, but this 
cast serves it up as merrily as ice cream and cookies, letting the viewer say: 
Ouch. 
</P>
<P>
There'll be a production later in the summer at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, 
but it's hard to imagine it coming closer to the bone -- or the funnybone. 
</P>

John Bailey has been replaced by award-winning documentary maker Richard Pearce 
as director of a civil rights film starring Sissy Spacek and Whoopi Goldberg 
that is being shot in Montgomery, Ala. "The Long Walk Home" was to be Bailey's 
directorial debut, but that was derailed by "creative differences," according 
to a spokesman for the film."The Long Walk Home" is being financed by 
independent film producer New Visions Pictures with a budget of about $6 
million. ALEENE MacMINN

'THE MORMONS' AT HIGHWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two lanky, sultry Mormon missionaries mince and moan in "Meet the Mormons," a 
piece of outrageous camp starring Curtis York and Robert Daniels. Performed at 
Highways in Santa Monica this week (and repeating Monday and June 19), the 
evening is sui generis. The duo's eccentricities are frequently charming, but 
the pace and tone sometimes go slack and voices too often zoom from purr to 
scream when a lower decibel level might be more effective. 
</P>
<P>
York, who looks surprisingly plausible in lipstick, dangling earrings, black 
skirt and high heels, offers a memory of being 7 years old and attending a 
church-sponsored Mother's Day ceremony in which potted geraniums were passed 
down the rows of children to each mother. The day had an ugly ending -- a 
violent and only dimly remembered sexual assault. "It was like I had to start 
covering something up," he says, working his nylon-encased legs as if an itch 
wouldn't stop. 
</P>
<P>
At 13, the glowering bishop (York does this role too) questions him 
suspiciously about his sex life to determine his worthiness for special church 
work. A terrible feeling of "airlessness" had begun to descend again, York 
says, whereupon he sheds his top, revealing a black bustier, and segues into a 
graceful blue boa-waving number called "Goddess's Rage." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels, transformed into the Trailer Park woman via a wig, metallic red 
fingernails and rubber breasts, has a dulcet-toned telephone chat with a 
girlfriend interrupted by an interminable call from her daughter, who has run 
away and gotten into all kinds of trouble. Daniels has this woman down pat, 
including the hair-adjusting gestures and the S-curved body. But she's such a 
cliche ("They told me all I had to do was take Home Ec!" she cries) that one 
soon wearies of her. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the evening is the place where the Mormon religion and 
homosexuality meet -- the intersection of childhood wholesomeness and terror, 
of being a missionary who is supposed to deliver the word of God and being a 
performer compelled to deliver the truth about himself. Although it's fun to 
see York as the skipping, wand-waving Pink Goddess -- and tolerable to indulge 
Daniels as a singing Dinah Shore -- we often seem far afield from the deeper 
issues these guys have introduced. CATHY CURTIS

In the mid '80s Charles Villiers painted a Mr. Potato Head everyman who 
wandered urban and desert landscapes with a direct and primitive appeal. His 
clever Duchampian sculptures threatened a function but had none. Current 
constructions merge large paintings with wood, bones, fake pears, fake fur and 
rubber. His painting technique has grown in sophistication and his visual 
lexicon is more complex, but the net effect is somehow less compelling and 
fresh. 
</P>
<P>
Imagery includes a large, loosely worked takeoff of one of Van Gogh's self 
portraits, precious little plaques with trompe l'oeil fish and shells studded 
with rhinestones ("Fish and Shell I") and a whole battery of long-necked 
woman-creatures that wear fatigues, paint, contemplate archetypal shelters or 
smile demurely from carefully drafted heads taken from recognizable Renaissance 
and Mannerist works. Only in "Born Mammal" is there a glimmer of the personal 
voice that gave earlier works their resonance. (Natoli-Ross Gallery, 2110 
Broadway, to July 1.) MARLENA DONOHUE

New Yorker Philemona Williamson uses a exotic palette to paint enchanting 
scenes that look like childhood or subconscious impressions filtered through 
her sensual sagacity. Populated with cartoon-y folk art figures that are more 
robust and tensile than those of Robert Colescott, her canvases depict a young 
black girl awkwardly maneuvering one high heel and one bare foot, crawling over 
furniture amidst curious toy puppets, always eyeing the antics of grown-ups who 
often hide behind bizarre masks. 
</P>
<P>
Works are painted in strident swaths of bold poppy yellows, Kelly greens and 
lilacs partnered to optimize color's psychological reverberations. Williamson 
tilts diagonals and sets action in tight, pressure cooker spaces so her images 
have the vertiginous magic of Caribbean carnivals. Mysterious foliage and odd 
objects popping up out of context blend indoors and out, past and present, 
fantasy and graceful dignity. 
</P>
<P>
In "Shore Road, Magnolia Mass," a nearly grown girl in pleated skirt and 
loafers tumbles to the edge of a bright yellow and magenta precipice just as 
her father, the chauffeur for a white family, stops the car to offer a powerful 
helping hand. Confident, almost cagey, the pigtailed woman-child decides to go 
it on her own. (Wenger Gallery, 828 N. La Brea Ave., to July 2.) MARLENA

There's a deceptive veneer of innocence about the work of the late H. C. 
Westermann. A much loved figure whose career came to a premature close in 1981, 
this master assemblagist turned out impeccably crafted objects that appear as 
though they might've been the work of some harmlessly eccentric backwoods 
crank. His work looks funky and warm, but in fact there's something slightly 
sinister afoot here, and the specter of death haunted much of what Westermann 
did. 
</P>
<P>
Combining a wicked Dadaist sense of humor (along with Dada's predilection for 
visual puns) with a crude, cartoonish graphic style, Westermann's aesthetic is 
infused with the volatile humor of a dangerous drunk whose party games threaten 
to turn ugly without warning. An undercurrent of violence churns through this 
wild, decidedly masculine work that favors narratives best described as young 
boys' tales of adventure mutated into something weird. Westermann's drawings 
take us into a swampy netherworld where the trees are always bare of leaves and 
the sun never shines. In "Wonder Bread Picture" we see a parched field 
inhabited by a scarecrow and a lynched man swinging from a tree, while "In The 
Desert" depicts a nude woman in red high heels staggering from a fish pond to a 
crumbling adobe under the watchful gaze of a ferocious beast. Drawn in the 
manner of ribald jokes, they are nonetheless spooky images. 
</P>
<P>
Westermann's objects tend to be a bit more whimsical; "A Bronze Sculpture That 
Might Be Moved Frequently" is a block of bronze with a handle attached, while 
"A Blimp" is a perfect replica of the Goodyear Blimp carved in an exotic wood. 
More often, his assemblages have the same edge one finds in his drawings. "The 
Pig House" involves a rubber replica of a dead pig hanging from a hook inside a 
beautifully crafted screen house. It's at once elegant, funny and cruel. This 
museum quality survey includes 33 pieces dating from 1962 to 1978. (James 
Corcoran Gallery, 1327 5th St., to July 1.) KRISTINE McKENNA

Barbara Kruger is shaping up to be one of the most important artists to emerge 
from New York in the '80s. Combining the unabashed emotionality of 
Neo-Expressionism, the media savvy of Appropriationism, and the rigorous 
austerity of Conceptualism, her work conducts an aggressive inquiry into 
exactly what transpires in the countless social, sexual and political contracts 
that define our lives. With a background in graphic design, Kruger has a keen 
understanding of the ways we're effected by the subtle interplay of words and 
images, and much of her work deals with the power of mass media and the 
advertising industry. 
</P>
<P>
Like that of Jenny Holzer, Kruger's work has the look of propaganda, and in 
fact that's exactly what it is: propaganda for the idea that one should be 
aware that things are rarely as they appear to be and one has a responsibility 
to look beyond surfaces. In this body of work, she raises such questions as who 
is bought and sold? Who is beyond the law? Who is free to choose? The artist 
provides a hint of an answer to these questions with her provocative 
juxtaposition of image and text. "Who is Beyond the Law" is illustrated with a 
fistful of money, while "Who Is Free To Choose" is paired with an image of two 
little girls playing with a puppet. A Kruger work dealing with the Pledge of 
Allegiance is also currently on view as part of the "Forest of Signs" show at 
MOCA. (Fred Hoffman Gallery, 912 Colorado Ave., to July 1.) KRISTINE McKENNA

HERITAGE SHOWS ITS HERITAGE

You can't drive down Main Street and miss all the work that's gone into 
Heritage Square. Some kind of Santa Monica historical museum seems to be 
involved, but of course the real question is: What about that other building on 
the square, the handsome old house that used to be the Chronicle? 
</P>
<P>
It's turned into a heavy dose of the Grand Style, that's what. Right in the 
middle of casual Santa Monica, it's got serious waiters, a magisterial wine 
list, and an atmosphere of turn-of-the-century elegance. The name of the place 
is, by no coincidence, the Heritage, and it's the new home of Rolf Nonnast, 
formerly of Scandia, La Couronne and Saddle Peak Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
Its heritage, as it were, shows. The kitchen has the same mixture of cautious 
inventiveness and old fashioned Continental plush of Nonnast's other homes. If 
there are modern elements like Japanese mushrooms and charred tuna, there are 
also plenty of old fashioned cream and butter sauces and even a carpetbag steak 
stuffed with oysters. 
</P>
<P>
The best things often seem to be the most retrograde, in fact. The appetizer of 
crab "pancakes" is the old fashioned idea of a seafood-filled crepe in butter 
sauce, but rich almost beyond description. (The little red line of sweet pepper 
relish on top of the crepes puts the dish right over the edge.) The lobster 
lasagna is also stunningly rich, cut by the slight bitterness of saffron in the 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The Caesar salad, mixed table-side (unless you're in the front room; Caesar's 
salad chariot is too wide to enter the door, which means the salad is solemnly 
prepared just outside the room), does not even offer the option of anchovies, 
but generally the salads are marked by welcome additions. Spinach and enoki 
salad has some fleurons of puff pastry hanging around. A field salad of the 
usual lettuces is spiked with fresh tarragon and dill. 
</P>
<P>
A measure of the Heritage's standards is the amount of variety in the 
accompaniments. A lamb loin splashily dosed with tarragon essence comes with an 
exquisite timbale of zucchini and paper-thin eggplant slices on the side. The 
culotte steak grilled over bay leaves (which sounds fascinating, though I 
regret to say the leaves do not add much to the flavor) comes with a mold of 
thin-sliced potato, a Provencale tomato and some slightly cooked red onions 
marinated in vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
The burger (available at lunch) might be a concession to the beach town 
ambiance, except that it's a tradition-minded post-modern sort of burger, a 
buffalo-burger with the beefy-gamy flavor of our national bovine. The thing is 
about an inch and a quarter thick, and comes with fresh potato chips, coleslaw, 
and silver bowls of Dijon mustard, catsup and wonderful horseradish mayonnaise. 
It can be a little messy to eat, particularly if you've decided to make it a 
cheese-buffalo-burger topped with (of course) smoked bufala mozzarella. 
</P>
<P>
The pastries are very good with occasional surprises (the unannounced 
chocolate-marzipan frosting on a chocolate "tart" that is more like a devil's 
food cake; the frosting of the banana cake, which consists of white, milk and 
dark chocolate elements). Nothing, however, beats the flan in fresh strawberry 
sauce, a flan that shakes like jelly and melts in the mouth like no other. 
</P>
<P>
And of course the place is right next to that Heritage Museum. Must remember to 
look into the museum sometime. 
</P>

lunch and tea Monday through Friday, for dinner daily. Full bar. Valet parking.

Got $125 to spare? Then you might want to know about the fund-raiser being held 
at Citrus on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen of our best French chefs, including Citrus' Michel Richard, Michel 
Blanchet of L'Ermitage, Jean-Pierre Bosc of Fennel, Claude Segal of Mabe and 
the two chefs from Tulipe are banding together to put on a huge French 
bicentennial bash at Hollywood Park on July 16. To raise money for that affair, 
they're having this one. It's a sit-down dinner that promises fantastic food, 
fun costumes, Champagne (Taittinger) and dancing till all hours of the night.

The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrantelli, 25001 Dana Point Harbor Drive, Dana Point. (714) 493-1401. Open 
Mondays through Fridays 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., Sundays through Thursdays 5:30 
to 10, Fridays and Saturdays till 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrantelli is an engaging dockside pasta house that doesn not take a lot of 
chances but offers solid meals. The house antipasto, a stunning palette of 
color and taste, gives an idea of the type of effort the kitchen puts in with 
its limited skill. Pastas are fine too, made fresh daily by Pasta Mia and 
embellished with a variety of good sauces. But the veal dishes are tasteless, 
and main courses are often too sweet. 
</P>
<P>
Yankee Tavern, 333 Bayside Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 675 5333. Open nightly 
5:30 to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know Yankee Tavern owner Hans Prager as proprietor of the Ritz may 
be surprised to see him in this urban roadhouse, catering to a crowd hungry for 
low prices, speedy service and an unpretentious menu. The food here is almost 
unfailingly good.

A FEAST OF GREAT OYSTERS, TASTY SPEARFISH AND SALMON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Max Jacobson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consider the oyster. Food writer M.F.K. Fisher did. And so, for that matter, 
does McCormick and Schmick, a new Irvine eatery that serves the best oysters 
this side of Puget Sound, plus a variety of other knockout seafood specialties. 
Don't be surprised to discover that you are going to have to wait for a table. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant is the latest member of a chain that originated in the Pacific 
Northwest, headed by Bill McCormick and Doug Schmick of Traditional Concepts 
Inc. This company owns wholesale fisheries and other related concerns, and the 
result is a broad variety of what the company boasts as "impeccably fresh 
fish." It may be a silly motto, but the fish are tremendous. 
</P>
<P>
As for those oysters, there they were, gleaming on their bed of crushed ice: 
tiny Olympia and fat Kumamoto, salty Quilicene and sweet Skookum, even Golden 
Mantle atop their op-art shells. I slurped them up one by one from the oyster 
combination platter, unadulterated by lemon or cocktail sauce. I even ignored 
the crusty sourdough bread the waiter dumped on our table. The oysters 
themselves were so perfect that the meal could have ended then and there. 
</P>
<P>
The meal went on, though, and so did my appetite. Something called rock shrimp 
popcorn was wonderful. I smeared them with a tangy remoulade and finished off 
the whole basket myself. The house chowder was creamy and overly salted, 
brimming with chunks of sweet, deep-sea fish whose names I couldn't quite 
place. A vinegary salad of marinated green beans with a red-pepper bacon 
dressing had plenty of kick. And the main dishes, Hawaiian spearfish in a 
chipotle pepper sauce, and Copper River salmon with bay scallops and cream 
sauce, were terrific. 
</P>
<P>
The side dishes that accompany all seafoods -- green asparagus in butter sauce, 
and a tiny pasta called semi de mellone (it looks like tiny grains of rice) -- 
make an amazingly positive impression. Spearfish (a member of the swordfish 
family) had the character of a meaty tuna with an oily aftertaste. And Copper 
River salmon, pan-fried in sweet butter, was flat-out one of the best things I 
have ever tasted: tender, juicy, and subtly perfumed with the rushing waters of 
an icy Northwest river. 
</P>
<P>
I tried to think of a better meal I might have had in a San Francisco seafood 
emporium but couldn't. Foggy City fish houses are clearly what McCormick and 
Schmick tries to emulate, and despite the absence of such classics as Hangtown 
fry and oyster stew, they more than bring it off. 
</P>
<P>
One look around the mahogany and beveled-glass dining room and you realize that 
it has been designed by a sentimentalist. With its plush booths in little 
alcoves, Deco-style, stained-glass lighting fixtures and a long, Hopper-esque 
counter beside the grill, it has the charm of a men's club. The only thing 
lacking is the patina that you find in a Sam's or a Tadich's. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, the local glitterati are turning out in force. Both times I dined 
there I faced a long line at the podium. Lines will get longer, too. Blame that 
on specialties like fine, flaky crab cakes with jalapeno mayonnaise. Or 
firm-textured broiled sea bass with Jamaican spices. Or a sumptuously grilled 
Ling cod with sauteed Dungeness crab legs, in beurre blanc. The menu changes 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
And because the menu is quite lengthy, you don't even have to love seafood to 
be happy here. One contingent of white-toqued chefs behind the counter broil 
New York steaks and filet mignons while another finishes off marinated chicken, 
Cajun cheeseburgers or turkey sandwiches. I tasted several of the grill items. 
No complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Now that I've finished raving, there are some imperfections. I ordered crab, 
which came elegantly served in a long cocktail glass. The only problem was that 
the crab was totally flavorless. A dish called lemon-pepper prawn salad sported 
a hefty price, beautiful greens (mache, arugula and butter lettuce) a fine 
vinaigrette . . . and big, fat prawns that might as well have been Styrofoam. 
And what began life as an intelligent combination of linguine with sweet, smoky 
mussels and green asparagus ended it as a big bowl of tasty mush. 
</P>
<P>
Service was spotty, too. The restaurant may be doing a brisk trade, but the 
servers don't necessarily have their sea legs. One evening I asked a waitress 
to differentiate the oysters on the combination platter for me, and she looked 
at me as if I had asked her to recite the "Rime of the Ancient Mariner." 
Another evening, my waiter, clearly under time pressure from an overloaded 
station, seemed to bristle visibly every time I asked him about a dish. I 
assume that the management will soon amend those faults. 
</P>
<P>
The dessert list is nothing much, relying heavily on everyone's assumed 
weakness for chocolate. There is chocolate mousse, a dry double-chocolate cake, 
a drier chocolate-peanut butter slice, and the one saving grace, a chocolate 
truffle torte good enough for seconds. If you don't like chocolate, I recommend 
a dozen Olympias. Bring your own Sauternes. 
</P>
<P>
McCormick and Schmick is moderately priced. Lunch and light entrees are $4.95 
to $7.95. Appetizers are $2.75 to $8.25. Oysters are $7.50 to $11.90. Soups and 
salads are $1.95 to $12.95. Seafood specialties are $9.90 to $18.50. There is a 
Chardonnay-dominated wine list printed on the back of the menu card.

IT'S A CIRCUS: THEATER TROUPE MUST MOVE PLAY OUT OF MARKET, INTO TENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Susana Repertory Company thought it had found a home, and theater, when a 
developer offered in March to lend them his abandoned Simi Valley supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
But five weeks ago, as the troupe was busy converting the building from grocery 
store to theater, a city building inspector showed up with good news and bad 
news. 
</P>
<P>
The good news was that, yes, the troupe could stage a play in the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news was that, because of fire-safety requirements, it couldn't invite 
many people or let anyone sit down. 
</P>
<P>
"They basically dropped the bomb on us," said Victoria Morris, one of Simi 
Valley Repertory's co-founders. "Here was this 30,000-square-foot building, and 
we couldn't use it." 
</P>
<P>
The show, of course, must go on. Tonight, the company's rendition of "Man of La 
Mancha" will debut . . . in a tent in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Opening night comes a week late, as company members had to scramble to secure a 
temporary city permit, rent a $7,500-a-month theatrical tent and move sets and 
seats from supermarket to parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really been a back-breaker," Morris said. "It's ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
Morris said she was assured by the building's owner months ago that the 
supermarket in the 5100 block of Los Angeles Avenue was up to snuff. In fact, 
it does meet codes as a supermarket but not as a playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a real difference between a theater and a grocery store," said Jay 
Corey, Simi Valley deputy city manager. "When it comes to theaters and other 
assembly areas, you have people packed into a tight area, so the 
fire-protection requirements are much more stringent." 
</P>
<P>
About 300 seats were to be installed in the supermarket. The tent, which city 
officials deemed safe for assembly use, accommodates only 230. The supermarket 
was to include a plush lobby and indoor plumbing. The tent provides neither. 
</P>
<P>
So Santa Susana Repertory finds itself, once again, in less than perfect 
surroundings. So far in this inaugural season, it has had to stage "A Christmas 
Carol" and "Of Mice and Men" at Simi Elementary School and Moorpark College 
auditoriums. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the company counts a dozen experienced television and stage 
actors among its ranks and has given Simi Valley its first taste of 
professional theater. Most of the actors live in the bedroom community and 
simply wanted to work in live theater close to home. 
</P>
<P>
Doerken Properties of Santa Monica, which owns the supermarket, will allow 
Santa Susana Repertory to use the building at least through July. The troupe 
could install floor-to-ceiling partitions and other safety precautions to bring 
the building up to code for theater use. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't really have a definite plan," said Holley Swanner, the play's 
producer. "We don't really have the resources to fix the building. We're 
thinking of just going to a summer festival and having three plays in the 
tent." 
</P>
<P>
"Man of La Mancha," which runs through July 2, stars Lane Davies as Don 
Quixote. Davies regularly plays Mason Capwell on NBC's soap opera "Santa 
Barbara." Jerry Winsett will play Sancho Panza, Eileen Barnett will play 
Aldonza and David Ralphe, a veteran of the Mark Taper Forum and Orange County's 
South Coast Repertory Theater, will direct.

THE STRONG HAND OF A REALIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WYMA, Wyma is a regular contributor to Valley Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a long way from a suffragette parade in 1916 to break dancers in 1984, but 
Theresa Bernstein has painted them both. In between, there have been thousands 
of other subjects. And at age 99 she is still at it. 
</P>
<P>
Well-known in East Coast art circles, Bernstein's work is making a West Coast 
debut in a show at the Platt Gallery at the University of Judaism, located on 
Mulholland Drive above the San Fernando Valley. The show offers a chance to see 
examples of a notable movement -- Bernstein was one of the New York realist 
painters known as the Ashcan school -- produced by a woman artist whose work 
was remarkably assertive for her time. 
</P>
<P>
"Her touch is very strong and she's enormously expressive, with great power," 
said Patricia Burnham, a University of Texas art lecturer who has studied 
Bernstein. "She's unlike her generation and unlike many modes of female 
expression. Women were supposed to express themselves in more gentle ways." 
</P>
<P>
The National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington has recognized Bernstein 
as one of the foremost women painters of her time. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein refuses to disclose her age. But Burnham said the 1900 census listed 
her as 9 years old. The artist, who lives in New York, visited Los Angeles last 
weekend. She is slightly built and gregarious. In an interview, she explained 
why she won't discuss her age. 
</P>
<P>
"People have the idea that you can't be successful if you're not young," 
Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
She insists on being taken seriously in part because she still paints. So 
strong is the impulse to work, in fact, that a recent bout with a gimpy arm 
didn't stop her. 
</P>
<P>
"If I couldn't work with my right hand, I worked with my left hand even though 
I had no skill," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein's works share the Platt Gallery exhibit with those of her late 
husband, William Meyerowitz, a painter, etcher and printmaker. The two had been 
married 62 years when he died in 1981. Meyerowitz is better known than his 
wife. More of his work hangs in prestigious museums, but Burnham said that may 
be changing. 
</P>
<P>
"She has never been considered a major artist, but that was because we in 
America had a very, very narrow and condescending attitude toward the New York 
realists. We meant just the men. Now that New York realists are beginning to be 
discovered in all their diversity, Theresa stands tall." 
</P>
<P>
Like more famous Ashcan artists, John Sloan and Robert Henri among them, 
Bernstein often chose her subjects from everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
"My paintings were of the scene, the environment where I lived," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She experimented with color and style, while keeping her work representational. 
Although her husband drifted toward abstractionism as it came into vogue, 
Bernstein did not. "I could never warm up to cubes and triangles," Burnham 
quotes her as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Often her works depict public places and crowds: the beach at Coney Island, a 
New York street going wild on Armistice Day, the public library, working-class 
people on a weekend boat outing. One of her better-known paintings is of a 
group of women waiting inside an employment office in 1917. Bernstein remembers 
doing a preliminary sketch, hiding her pad under a newspaper while she caught 
the mix of hope and despair on people's faces. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been interested in people," she said. "I've always been a curious 
observer." 
</P>
<P>
Educated in her native Philadelphia at the Pennsylvania Academy of Art and the 
Philadelphia School of Design, Bernstein moved to New York in the early 1910s 
to attend the Art Students League and pursue her career. By the time she 
married Meyerowitz at the age of 29, she had endured a period a poverty and 
built a name for herself. 
</P>
<P>
Because women were looked upon as second-class artists, she signed her 
paintings T. Bernstein or simply Bernstein. They met after her future husband 
saw one of her paintings at a show. A member of the People's Art Guild, which 
gave artworks to those who couldn't afford to buy them, he came to her studio 
asking for a donation. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me, 'Oh, I thought you were an older man,' " she remembered. Bernstein 
gave Meyerowitz several paintings, and their courtship started. 
</P>
<P>
The show of Bernstein's and Meyerowitz's works is curated by Suzanne Stone, 
owner of Ashley Gallery in Sherman Oaks. After the Platt Gallery exhibit closes 
June 23, some of the works will move to Ashley Galley. 
</P>
<P>
Stone said the couple were prolific, often painting side-by-side. Many finished 
canvases were taken off their stretcher bars and stored haphazardly so that the 
bars could be reused. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein said the reason for carelessness is simple. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always had the impulse to express myself," she explained.

PREVIEW: GETTING WET ISN'T A THREAT -- IT'S A GUARANTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Magic Mountain's newest ride, Tidal Wave, lasts about 70 seconds. A 
flat-bottomed boat filled with passengers travels up a steep incline, then 
promptly turns and plunges into a man-made lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting splash drenches everyone aboard, and the ride is over. 
</P>
<P>
They might as well push you into a pool. 
</P>
<P>
And if that's not enough, they've built a bridge over the lagoon where 
bystanders can be battered by a 20-foot wall of water created by the plummeting 
boat. 
</P>
<P>
It's like having someone douse you with the garden hose. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what, you get soaked," said Juliet DeAndrade, 12, of Pasadena, who 
attended the ride's opening last week. "It's fun because people like to get 
wet." 
</P>
<P>
At least, that's what Magic Mountain is banking on. The Valencia amusement park 
is billing Tidal Wave as its top attraction this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The amusement park refuses to release attendance figures, but an official said 
the ride ran at near capacity in its first three days. Tidal Wave can soak 
1,200 riders per hour, so as many as 38,000 customers emerged dripping wet June 
2, Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Water thrill rides are in vogue this season. Splash Mountain was supposed to 
make its debut at Disneyland months ago, but Disney executives worried that 
riders got too wet. 
</P>
<P>
"The tradition at Disneyland is that nobody is ruled out," said Tony W. Baxter, 
the ride's executive producer. "It's a negative if somebody says, 'You guys go. 
I don't want to get all wet.' " 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Disney delayed the opening until midsummer for some costly 
re-engineering. 
</P>
<P>
No such timidity at Magic Mountain, where the park's two other water rides are 
among its most popular. Officials there have long contended that while Disney 
must cater to out-of-state tourists, Magic Mountain specializes in pleasing 
locals. 
</P>
<P>
"Eighty percent of Magic Mountain's attendance comes from Southern California," 
said Courtney Simmons, a park spokeswoman. "We look at the Southern California 
mentality. Our guests like getting wet because they feel they have 
participated. "If our guests love to get wet," Simmons said, "we don't question 
it." DAVID WHARTON

3 ARTISTS TRANSFERRING MOVEMENT ONTO SCREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three artists who explore film or video dance show their recent work on a 
stimulating episode of the "New Television" series tonight at 11:30 on KCET 
Channel 28. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff McMahon and Charles Moulton each create movement collages that remain 
wholly subservient to photography and editing techniques. Bridget Murnane faces 
a thornier task: transferring to the screen solos by Susan Rose and Louise 
Burns that possess a genuine choreographic shape. 
</P>
<P>
In Murnane's "To Dancers," the camera selectively captures the essentials of 
Rose's dramatic, seated solo through bold close-ups made more striking by an 
intense red-and-black color scheme. Cries and drumming by Megan Roberts 
intensify the imagery. The Burns segment starts in the studio and then follows 
the dancer into outdoor environments that expand the spatial thrust of the 
choreography beyond theatrical limits. 
</P>
<P>
"To Dancers" actually represents the second half of Murnane's "For Dancers" 
(two and "To" make "For"). The deleted sections are, if anything, more unusual, 
since they attempt to reconceive classic techniques of shooting dance (long 
takes, full-body compositions) developed in Hollywood musicals. 
</P>
<P>
Moulton is celebrated in the American avant-garde for his inventive sequencing 
ploys, and these, indeed, dominate his off-the-wall extravaganza, "Hazardous 
Hootenanny." However, here they involve the juggling of split- and 
multiple-screen panels, some of them cleverly faked. (Watch what happens when 
performers reach out of frame.) The sax-and-vocal score by Steve Elson is every 
bit as delirious as the visuals. 
</P>
<P>
Dancing? No. This is gesture processed into camera choreography, something that 
McMahon also uses -- combined with animated stills and plenty of real dance 
footage -- in "Cross Body Ride" to music by Charles Nieland. 
</P>
<P>
Shot in Venezuela, it shows David Zambrano and Donald Fleming on a staircase, 
on a beach, on a catwalk, in a bed -- sometimes emphasizing physical intimacy, 
elsewhere the space separating the men. 
</P>
<P>
Unabashedly homoerotic, this paean to the male form in motion suffers from 
McMahon's generalized swoop-and-lift choreography (derived from contact 
improvisation) but is very deft in its editing juxtapositions.LEWIS SEGAL

Betty Jurus stood outside the Writers' Bookstore &amp; Haven, talking about the 
neighborhood that used to be. Oh, sure, the shoe repair store is still there, 
as are the Irish bar, the Mexican restaurant and the lawn mower shop. But now 
there are bookstores and bookstores and bookstores . . . and more on the way. 
</P>
<P>
Adams Avenue in Normal Heights, leading into Kensington, is becoming inundated 
with small, independent bookstores dealing mostly in used books. Only the 
Normal Heights Bookstore, at Adams and Felton streets, carries new books. 
</P>
<P>
Jurus, who opened the Writers' Bookstore &amp; Haven in 1983, calls it "a 
proliferation," "a renaissance" and the natural evolution of a "bohemian" 
neighborhood. Small, independent bookstores are dying across America, but 
apparently not along Adams, where the merchants view competition more in terms 
of cooperation and esprit de corps. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Waldenbooks 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to see any Waldenbooks opening up along here," said Leif 
Fearn, who owns and operates Kabyn Books, which rents space in the rear of 
Writers' Bookstore &amp; Haven. Kabyn Books deals in educational books for 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the most commercial area in the world -- and that's what makes it 
special," said Fearn, whose store is one of three inside the Writers' Bookstore 
and Haven. The other is Jax Photo Books, which deals exclusively in books about 
photography. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Hastings, who owns the Prince and the Pauper, a children's bookstore at 
3285 Adams Ave., said that last Sunday may have been the culmination of the 
street's love affair with books -- a book fair that drew more than 2,000 
readers, some from as far away as Arizona and Michigan. Hillcrest and downtown 
share clusters of bookstores, but, as Hastings pointed out, no other area of 
the city seems to have them all on one street. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings, who opened the Prince and the Pauper in May of last year, said he did 
so in search of an "avocation" and as a prelude to retirement. He said he's 
been startled by the success of the store, which is tucked away in what looks 
to be a wonderful, magic closet full of some of the classiest books in the 
history of children's literature. 
</P>
<P>
He has an 1884 copy of "The Raven" by Edgar Allan Poe, with illustrations by 
Gustave Dore. In that era, such was considered a children's book, Hastings 
said, since no books were written specifically for children. He'll sell you 
"The Raven" for $525. 
</P>
<P>
As you enter Hastings' store, a gigantic green parrot is apt to startle you 
with his high-pitched voice. His name? 
</P>
<P>
"Prince," Hastings said, "and I'm the pauper." 
</P>
<P>
But it isn't true. Hastings said the store has been so successful that he's 
looking for a larger space. He hopes to move within the year but will stay on 
Adams Avenue -- to do otherwise, he said, would be traitorous. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't the only one looking for larger spaces in which to open bookstores on 
Adams Avenue. Grounds for Murder, a mystery bookstore in Old Town, is hoping to 
relocate on Adams, possibly by buying out the building that once housed a movie 
theater, a fundamentalist church and a punk-rock nightclub, but which now lies 
dormant. 
</P>
<P>
"Our owner (Phyllis Brown) is considering it," said Carol Dorman, manager of 
Grounds for Murder. "It's not definite yet. I think she's just ready for a 
change, as are so many bookstores, and a lot is happening over there on Adams." 
</P>
<P>
Dorman said bookstore owners -- especially owners of the small, independent 
stores -- rarely think in terms of how to one-up the guy next door, mainly 
because each has a specialty. 
</P>
<P>
"We all want to be in one place," she said, "because that's where people who 
love books are going to be gathered. If anything, small stores usually refer 
customers among their places. It works better that way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Holds Court Over Store 
</P>
<P>
Hal Alexander, who moved here a decade ago from Chicago, is now the proprietor 
of Writers' Bookstore and Haven, having recently acquired the store from Jurus. 
Alexander holds court over a store in which, on a recent drizzly morning, four 
women sat in "the sanctuary" (a small, private room) reading from a play one 
had written. Critical comments were followed by hasty revisions and then 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
Out front, Alexander browsed through shelves that contain books written by 
people who customarily frequent the store. There was "There Is No Zoo in 
Zoology (And Other Beastly Mispronunciations)," by Charles Harrington Elster; 
"Boundless Love," a romance novel by Laurel Chandler, and "Mission Bay Murder," 
by Carlton Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"Our whole focus is for writers who write and read," Alexander said. "We 
believe writers are writers before, as well as after, publication. If you're 
only interested in writing better letters to a friend, you're welcome." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander said any interest in books is "terrific" in a community "with so many 
distractions that work against reading . . . the beach, the park, the zoo. It 
makes reading less appealing. If you're stuck in the middle of Minnesota in the 
winter, in the woods, and you have a cabin full of volumes by Keats, you'll 
read Keats. And you'll love Keats. In San Diego, many would feel differently. 
So this interest in books is wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Among the seven bookstores clustered within a quarter of a mile, the Normal 
Heights Bookstore numbers among its new books a healthy stock of science 
fiction. Safari deals in out-of-print and extremely hard-to-get books through 
what owner J. R. Bohannon calls its "search service." 
</P>
<P>
He said "the most fun I have" is looking for books whose authors have lost 
their copies. He meets these writers through Writers' Bookstore and Haven. He 
recently found "The Magic of Herbs" for its local author, Scott Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
Jurus, who maintains an active interest in the Writers' Bookstore and Haven as 
well as the new look of the street itself, said owners of these stores know 
what they're up to. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all individuals and individualists," she said, "but they know that 
getting book lovers to go from shop to shop is a great idea that serves 
everybody well. If the block contained only one store, and it didn't have the 
book you wanted, you'd probably just go home. This way, you'll browse through 
the other stores. This has become a community of books and bookstores for 
people who love books. I, personally, can't think of anything better."

<TEXT>
<P>
Jarvis Jovan Clark, 28, of San Diego was arrested about 8 p.m. Wednesday in 
connection with the shooting death of Andra Lasar Williams, 22, and the 
wounding of Torrance Nunn, 29, about 90 minutes earlier, according to Sgt. Hank 
Olais. 
</P>
<P>
Police answered a call about 6:30 p.m. at the Harbor Villa apartment complex on 
17th Street near Imperial Avenue and found Williams lying on a third-floor 
landing. 
</P>
<P>
Williams died of multiple gunshot wounds, Deputy Coroner Max Murphy said. Nunn 
was struck once in the left thigh and was taken to UC San Diego Medical Center. 
He was listed in fair condition Thursday, hospital spokeswoman Sheri Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn had been released earlier Wednesday for treatment of burns, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Olais said Clark began firing at Nunn and Williams with a high-powered 
automatic weapon after an argument. Clark then drove off in a car with a woman, 
Olais said. 
</P>
<P>
Police saw the car a short while later at Euclid and Imperial avenues and 
questioned the occupants, who directed officers to an Imperial Avenue hair 
salon. 
</P>
<P>
Clark was inquiring about hairdos when police arrived and he was arrested, 
Olais said.

800 POUNDS OF POT CONFISCATED FROM ILLEGAL ALIENS ON FOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U. S. Border Patrol agents Wednesday night seized 800 pounds of marijuana with 
a street value of $750,000 from illegal immigrants transporting the drug on 
foot just north of the U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
This is the same area of Imperial Beach where more than 900 pounds of cocaine 
were intercepted about a month ago, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Five adults and one juvenile, who identified themselves to authorities as 
Mexican citizens, were arrested about 9 p.m., said Dale W. Cozart, San Diego 
chief patrol agent. 
</P>
<P>
Agents were still searching for a vehicle that was believed to have been 
waiting for the cargo and for an unspecified number of others who were 
accompanying the group, some of whom were armed, Cozart said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vehicle Part of Investigation 
</P>
<P>
"There is a vehicle that we were able to identify, and that is part of the 
ongoing investigation," Cozart said. He declined to give a description. 
</P>
<P>
Border Patrol agents were near Monument Road and Hollister Street when they 
noticed a group of people carrying "large bags" on a ridgeline about half a 
mile north of the border, Cozart said. 
</P>
<P>
Border Patrol agents and a helicopter intercepted the group and arrested six 
males. Nine duffel bags containing 10-kilo bundles of marijuana were found in 
their possession, Cozart said. The others in the group escaped. No other 
narcotics were found. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe because of the terrain and our (helicopter) being up, that we took 
all of the narcotics into custody," Cozart said. 
</P>
<P>
"We did have information that there were individuals traveling with this group 
that were armed. We did not encounter them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similar to Cocaine Seizure 
</P>
<P>
The incident is similar to the seizure of 969 pounds of cocaine from "human 
mules" in the same area by Border Patrol and U. S. Customs agents May 8. The 
cocaine had a street value of $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities are investigating whether there is a connection between the two 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
Those arrested Wednesday on suspicion of transporting a controlled substance 
and suspicion of possessing with intent to distribute are: 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Chavez Martinez, 23; Jose Arturo Ancira Hernandez, 20; Pedro Barraza 
Rivera, 19; Armando Quintero Acosta, 33; Ricardo Rojas Morales, 32; and a 
16-year-old youth. 
</P>
<P>
The last significant marijuana seizure by San Diego Border Patrol agents was 
Jan. 18, when 954 pounds of marijuana were seized near Boulevard in eastern San 
Diego County.

2ND YOUTH SENTENCED IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A second Escondido teen-ager was sentenced to the maximum term in the 
California Youth Authority for his admitted role in the stabbing and hacking 
murder of a Cardiff man. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old boy on Wednesday was given a term of 25 years to life but will 
spend no more than 10 years in the CYA, which loses jurisdiction after inmates 
turn 25. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a 15-year-old friend of the boy also drew a 25-year-to-life sentence 
in the CYA. 
</P>
<P>
The two boys, in their guilty pleas, admitted that they used a knife and 
hatchet to kill Robert Wayne Pearce, 41, in an attack outside the man's 
apartment Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
The boys said they were hired to commit the crime by Pearce's estranged wife, 
Roberta Pearce, who has pleaded innocent to capital murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that Mrs. Pearce promised the boys money and cars in 
exchange for the killing, and that she planned to finance the crime by 
collecting on her estranged husband's $200,000 insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Pearce, who faces a Sept. 11 Superior Court arraignment, met the youths 
while working as a teacher's aide at Escondido's Orange Glen High School. 
</P>
<P>
A third student, a 16-year-old boy, also has been charged with murder and 
conspiracy and is awaiting trial.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: INNOVATIVE AND COSMOPOLITAN CUISINE IN ZONA RIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON

TIJUANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The menus at this city's fashionable restaurants still tend to repeat from 
place to place as relentlessly as the rhyming stanzas on middle-brow birthday 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
This phenomenon is by no means restricted to Tijuana -- consider the dreary 
similarities of Southern California beach restaurant menus -- nor is it such a 
bad thing. The better Tijuana places always make much of the local lobsters, 
Sea of Cortez shrimp and traditional Mexican meat preparations. 
</P>
<P>
But the city's growing economic importance dictates change, and Tijuana 
certainly does seem to be acquiring more cosmopolitan tastes. Although there is 
some resurgence in the old downtown, most of the important new houses continue 
to choose locations in the chic Zona Rio. 
</P>
<P>
The Alcazar del Rio, in operation for two or three years, has developed into 
what surely must be one of the most innovative restaurants in all Baja 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Outwardly similar to its top-drawer competitors, Alcazar del Rio has a mood 
that is formal and dressy and with a large staff, alert and deferential. It 
offers a menu that goes in 2 1/2 distinct directions, a fact that places it in 
a class of its own. If its menu is up to date, so are the surroundings, which 
tend to modern austerity softened with pink cloths and silk flowers on the 
tables. A pianist in the balcony bar plays nimbly through the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Almost alone among Tijuana restaurants, Alcazar takes a serious look at Spanish 
cuisine, which may inspire much of Mexican cooking but, in terms of actual 
recipes, generally remains quite distinct. (The wonderful tapas bar in Plaza 
Fiesta, Tablao Espanol, is unquestionably Spanish, but is also an entirely 
different sort of eatery). Alcazar also seems alone in its presentation of 
nouvelle or contemporary cooking, including many forward-looking creations that 
appear to be entirely its own. And finally, the menu accommodates 
traditionalists with such typical Tijuana favorites as lobster Thermidor (in 
this case, with the unusual and extravagant addition of black truffle, an 
ingredient not mentioned by the classic French recipe), beef brochette and 
eight quail preparations. 
</P>
<P>
These three distinct styles turn up in every section of the menu as well as on 
the daily specials list, which also indulges in cross-border cookery by 
including fajitas, which originated in Texas, and pasta with a sauce of cream 
and four cheeses; both of these dishes enjoy considerable popularity in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The appetizer page may be the least interesting of the menu, except for the 
angulas a la Bilbaina, a classic Spanish dish of baby eels in garlic and oil 
that Alcazar teams with fresh asparagus. People who have sampled this dish in 
Spain have likened it to a briny-tasting spaghetti. The slender baby eels, when 
piled together, do look like a mound of thin pasta. But one still must get 
around the fact of its basic eel-ness before ordering it, and it went untried. 
</P>
<P>
The menu comes much more into its own with a pair of soups, one Spanish and one 
an updated Mexican classic, that show off the kitchen's use of the best 
materials. The first combines Spanish forest mushrooms (an item repeated 
through the menu) with fresh mushrooms and spinach leaves in a full-bodied 
chicken broth, and the result is extraordinarily savory. The similar sopa de 
cuitlacoche is distinctly Mexican; it employs the rich-tasting fungus that 
grows on fortunate ears of corn and has a truffle-like quality. This soup 
typically is creamed, but Alcazar lightens the recipe by serving it in a clear 
broth, to which cubes of manchego cheese add a zesty and distinctive seasoning. 
</P>
<P>
The salad list begins with a beguiling plate of lettuce, asparagus and 
mushrooms dressed with el Alino, a complicated Spanish salad dressing that goes 
well beyond the basic oil-and-vinegar combination with its mix of herbs and 
teasing hint of crushed almonds. Paper-thin slices of cured ham, dried beef and 
cheese make this a luxurious and substantial starter. Alcazar also tosses an 
excellent Caesar at table; this salad never seems so well made as in Tijuana. 
The benefit of table-side preparation, which is sorely misunderstood by those 
reverse-snobs who see it as simply so much flash and trumpery, is that it 
guarantees a salad properly coated with the right amounts of egg, anchovy, oil, 
lemon, grated cheese and Worcestershire sauce. Caesar is a method, not a 
dressing, and it cannot be poured out of a bottle or ladled out of a tub. It 
always excludes herbs and mustard, and don't let anyone try to tell you 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
Alcazar shows its nouvelle inclinations with such entrees as camarones Alcazar 
del Rio (many dishes bear the restaurant's signature), or shrimp flamed in 
Cognac, glazed with jalapeno-fired sauce bearnaise and arranged on a bed of 
asparagus. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the modern mood are steamed halibut with mushrooms and oyster sauce; a 
New York sirloin with chipotle butter (it is the chili butter, not the steak, 
that is novel); dill-sauced lobster and scallops on a bed of seaweed, and the 
fish of the day, topped with smoked salmon and caviar and moistened with a 
manchego and Roquefort cheese sauce. In most cases, traditional Mexican flavors 
accent dishes prepared according to current French techniques, and it is this 
sort of mingling that is the soul of contemporary cooking. Even though 
contemporary cuisine can create atrocities, it is heartening to see this style 
emerge in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish cuisine is represented by such dishes as a filet of beef garnished with 
marrow and a tarragon-scented wine sauce; another filet topped with cured ham, 
anchovies, chestnuts and forest mushrooms; excellent baby lamb chops finished 
with a smooth, subtle hazelnut sauce and a fine rack of lamb crusted with 
garlic, mustard and bread crumbs. Alcazar in fact quite shines with its lamb, 
which it sends out pink, tender and flowing with juices. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most exciting dishes sampled was the camarones al chipotle y 
chocolate, or shrimp braised in a mole sauce heightened with almonds, pine nuts 
and a little more than the usual dose of unsweetened chocolate. The chocolate 
provided a flat, bitter note against which the other flavors, notably that of 
cinnamon, played, and the chipotle chilies provided a sweat-inducing heat that 
was, on the whole, quite agreeable. 
</P>
<P>
Also excellent was the pato rostizado en su jugo, or spiced duck roasted to a 
tender turn and served with a boat of its own juices sparked with dried anise 
buds. The stylish presentation included a bit of fresh mango sauce as an 
updated Mexican accent. 
</P>
<P>
Although it seemed odd to find fajitas on the menu, Alcazar served them 
handsomely, using strips of marinated filet and garnishing them elaborately 
with wedges of avocado, good beans, searing pickled onions and a subtly 
menacing salsa that crept up slowly but dangerously on the tongue. 
</P>
<P>
The best desserts are those done at table, and by all means skip the showy 
cakes, which are frosted by the Michelangelo of pastry cooks but taste like 
sawdust. An order of crepes suzettes, a classic Tijuana favorite, took 15 
minutes to prepare, a well-spent quarter-hour that resulted in orange-glazed 
pancakes that smelled deliciously of good butter and liqueur. 
</P>
<P>
Alcazar is a bit expensive by Tijuana standards, but a dinner will cost 
considerably less than would a comparable meal in San Diego. A three-course 
dinner for two, including a decent bottle from a Baja vineyard, tax and tip, 
should cost no more than $70. The restaurant, on the busy Paseo de los Heroes, 
is easily found.

REPUTED VICE RING MADAM WILKENING, LAWYER WILL BE TRIED FOR ILLEGAL FLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reputed madam Karen Wilkening and her former attorney, Buford Wiley Jr., were 
ordered Thursday to stand trial on charges that she fled the country in 1987 to 
avoid prosecution on charges that she was operating a call-girl ring. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Dist. Atty. Chuck Rogers said it is likely that National City car 
dealer Tony McCune and his former attorney will also face charges stemming from 
this case. 
</P>
<P>
In emotional testimony Thursday, McCune said he "begged" Wilkening to plea 
bargain her case in 1987 so he could avoid personal embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
McCune's former attorney, Armando Odorico, refused to answer questions, citing 
his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Among other charges, Wilkening is accused of obtaining a passport under the 
name a friend, Linda Webster, which she used to flee to the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that Wiley urged Wilkening to obtain the false passport, and 
that he harbored a fugitive by hiding her presence in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
McCune, who testified last week that Wilkening arranged for him to have sex 
with prostitutes, said Thursday that he gave money to Wilkening to help pay her 
legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her I would give her $25,000," McCune said. "The woman was, in my 
opinion, destitute." 
</P>
<P>
Webster, Wilkening's former best friend, testified Wednesday under immunity 
from prosecution that McCune offered Wilkening the money in exchange for 
leaving the country. 
</P>
<P>
McCune continually denied that he urged or knew about Wilkening's plan to flee 
to Manila, where she was arrested last month. 
</P>
<P>
"I was quite concerned about my wife and my family . . . and my reputation, so 
obviously I wanted her to plea bargain and negotiate a settlement," said 
McCune, who had to stop to regain his composure. "I wanted her to do it. I 
begged her to do it." 
</P>
<P>
McCune testified that he never had any idea that Wilkening was going to flee 
the country, even though he did send her $15,000 after she had failed to appear 
in court in 1987. McCune said he delivered the money "because Karen and I at 
our last meeting agreed that anything that happened after that would go through 
Mr. Wiley." 
</P>
<P>
McCune said he was testifying at the preliminary hearing without being 
subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the beginning of this whole ordeal, I've been up front, I've been 
cooperative, and I've told the truth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkening was ordered to stand trial last week on charges of conducting a 
prostitution ring. After her arrest in 1987, police seized a file containing 
the names of clients and the women who worked for her. This led to the affair 
being dubbed the "Rolodex 500" case.

Sherman Oaks chef Tindaro Pettignano is cultivating fans who have never set 
foot in his Ventura Boulevard restaurant or put a fork to his Capelli d'Angelo 
Primavera. 
</P>
<P>
He's doing it by cultivating crops a few steps from the rear door of his La 
Pergola Italian Ristorante. 
</P>
<P>
Pettignano tends garden plots that are sandwiched between apartments and 
condominiums in the shadow of high-rise office buildings near Ventura 
Boulevard's busy intersection with Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Rows of corn stand next to the street in the front yard of Pettignano's home. A 
few doors away, bushy tomato plants are among hundreds of vegetables, flowers 
and fruit trees sprouting from a 6,000-square-foot lot at the corner of 
Moorpark Street and Lemona Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
His fans include neighbors who never eat in his restaurant but appreciate the 
corny look. 
</P>
<P>
"It's refreshing to see something like this in a place like Sherman Oaks, where 
there's so much development," said Cynthia Cummins, who visits Pettignano's 
mini-farms every day on walks with her 2-year-old daughter Jaclyn. 
</P>
<P>
Cumming says that as "a stay-at-home mommy," she can't afford to eat at 
Pettignano's restaurant. But "it's very aesthetic to see his vegetables 
growing" instead of the usual Sherman Oaks' kind of growth, involving 
"everything being torn down and big condos going up." 
</P>
<P>
Residents of condominiums that overlook Pettignano's miniature agribusiness 
keep their eyes peeled for radish rustlers and others who might be tempted to 
pick his produce. They also cheer Pettignano on each morning when he hoes and 
waters his plants, which are grown without pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
At 11 a.m. each day, Pettignano picks cucumbers, lettuce and tomatoes. An hour 
later, he serves them as La Pergola Salad, Mista All 'Italiana and Di Mare 
Seafood Salad to his restaurant's lunch crowd. 
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, he turns his eggplant, zucchini and bell peppers into Lasagne 
Alla Contadina and other evening dinner specials. He said his gardens provide 
him with nearly every vegetable he needs, except mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't save any money doing this," said the 38-year-old Italian-born chef. 
"It's just a hobby. It makes me happy to grow things. It makes other people 
happy to see them. A lot of people around here have never seen anything like 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Pettignano started his garden by cultivating his front yard and planting 
vegetables in his tiny back yard. Then he decided to track down the owner of 
the long-vacant lot at Lemona and Moorpark and agreed to rent it for $200 a 
month. He spent about $3,000 to have water piped in. 
</P>
<P>
"I studied agriculture in Italy until I was 18, when I got involved in my 
brother's restaurant over there," he said. After coming to the United States 
and working as a waiter on a cruise ship and as a chef in San Luis Obispo, he 
opened his Sherman Oaks restaurant 1 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The front of his 60-chair restaurant is decorated with outdoor planters. Hidden 
among their small trees and shrubs are tiny clumps of parsley, basil and other 
spices. In a pinch, Pettignano said, he can dash out to harvest an emergency 
supply for his kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Pettignano's customers know about his gardens. Many stroll over to look 
at the latest crop. 
</P>
<P>
"The vegetables here are the best I've ever eaten," said diner Paul De 
Montesquiou of Woodland Hills. "They are the freshest, tastiest, sweetest I've 
ever had in any restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
Diner Bob Delay of Sherman Oaks was unaware of the do-it-yourself produce, 
however. "Could I tell the difference in the freshness of my salad? Truthfully? 
No," he grinned. 
</P>
<P>
Delay said he came for the Cioppino Alla Livornese. That's a clam dish.

FIRMS WARNED THEY ARE 'EASY TARGETS' FOR INITIATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles campaign consultant told South Bay business leaders Thursday that 
local industry is vulnerable to the increasing use of the initiative process by 
citizens concerned about pollution, growth and traffic issues. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some major interests at risk here," political consultant George 
Young said at the annual meeting of the South Bay Chambers of Commerce in 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'In Love' With Process 
</P>
<P>
"In California, we are kind of in love with the initiative process," Young 
said. In recent years, he noted, the state's voters have passed ballot measures 
aimed at controlling toxic chemicals, increasing tobacco taxes and regulating 
insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
Young said voters have a lot of compassion for people but do not have the same 
compassion for profit-making businesses and industry. "They are easy targets to 
pick on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A veteran of successful campaigns to defeat several measures that would have 
curbed commercial and office development in El Segundo, Young suggested that 
business leaders must start to educate voters long before the heat of a 
political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"A dollar spent in advance of a political crisis . . . is worth at least $10 
during the campaign," Young said. "A lot of people vote for things out of 
ignorance." 
</P>
<P>
Listening intently to Young's advice was Wyman D. Robb, manager of the Mobil 
Oil's Torrance refinery, which is the subject of an initiative campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I share his concerns about the direction the initiative process is taking," 
Robb said in an interview. "It is certainly going to have bigger and bigger 
impacts on industry. We currently are a prime example." 
</P>
<P>
After conducting a direct-mail campaign, Torrance City Councilman Dan Walker 
last week submitted nearly 10,000 signatures on petitions to force Mobil to 
stop using toxic hydrofluoric acid in its refining process. 
</P>
<P>
The measure is expected to qualify for the March, 1990, municipal ballot in 
Torrance after county election officials check the validity of the signatures. 
</P>
<P>
Young said business is vulnerable because it is so easy to qualify an 
initiative for the ballot in a small community. Usually, the signatures of only 
10% of registered voters are required. 
</P>
<P>
In affluent communities where voters are concerned about quality-of-life 
issues, Young said, the loss of jobs that can result from an anti-business 
initiative is "a relatively weak card" to play in campaigning against a ballot 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
He said voters need to be told about the ripple effect that an industrial 
payroll has on a local economy. "Do some advance work on this before you get 
confronted with a campaign crisis type of situation," Young told the audience. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Careful Campaign 
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned that a campaign against a ballot measure "must be done 
skillfully so it doesn't look self-serving." 
</P>
<P>
Although he did not mention the anti-Mobil initiative during his prepared 
remarks, Young said later: "What any business in Mobil's position has to do is 
get the facts out as soon as possible in a believable way." 
</P>
<P>
Robb said last week that Mobil will be intensifying its efforts to communicate 
with Torrance residents through mailings and meetings. He agreed with Young 
that the jobs argument "is not a very strong card for industry." 
</P>
<P>
After the chamber meeting, Robb declined to offer details about Mobil's efforts 
to defeat the initiative. "We're still watching and assessing the situation as 
it develops," he said. "There is a lot that is likely to happen between now and 
March, 1990."

GROUP HONORS 3 AREA LEGISLATORS WHO REJECT FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Sens. Ed Davis (R-Valencia) and Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) and Assemblyman 
Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) are among 12 state lawmakers praised by a 
citizens watchdog group for refusing to accept speaking fees from 
special-interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
California Common Cause, an inveterate critic of such honorariums, will present 
Davis, Friedman and Assemblywoman Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) with the first "The 
Free (No Honoraria) Speech Award" in ceremonies at the lawmakers' district 
offices today. The others will receive their framed certificates next week. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the negative attention on ethics, or the lack thereof, we think it's 
time to notice those legislators who go a step beyond and try to set an 
example," said Mark Haarer, assistant director of California Common Cause, 
which supports a ban on the controversial speaking fees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Appearance of a Connection' 
</P>
<P>
"For the most part, honoraria are given not because the legislator is a good 
speaker but because some special-interest bill is pending. There seems to be a 
direct connection. If there's not a connection, there's an appearance of a 
connection." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who directs special-interest groups to donate his speaking fees to 
charities, is more emphatic. "Honoraria is thinly disguised bribery," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of those honored, including the three San Fernando Valley area lawmakers, 
did not take any fees, which also are given for participating in panel 
discussions, in 1987 and 1988. The other three are first-term Assembly members 
who have vowed not to accept such fees. 
</P>
<P>
Common Cause said state lawmakers accepted $728,542 in speaking fees in 1988. 
Under Proposition 73, which was passed by voters last June, a lawmaker can 
accept only $1,000 a year for speeches on the governmental process from any 
group. There is no limit on speeches that do not focus on government. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators are paid $40,816 a year. Their $88 daily fee for expenses when the 
Legislature is in session brings their annual total to about $67,700. Common 
Cause supports a salary increase in conjunction with a ban on honorariums, 
gifts and trips paid by outside groups or individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman said Thursday that he supports that approach. He called honorariums 
and gifts "a more serious cause of conflict of interests than campaign 
contributions." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, one of the Legislature's leading fund-raisers, said he stopped taking 
honorariums in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"It creates the appearance on the part of the people paying the money that they 
are entitled to something," Robbins said. "They expect something, and I don't 
want to create the appearance that I can be bought." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Target 
</P>
<P>
The award comes shortly after reports that Robbins' name has surfaced as a 
possible target in a four-year FBI investigation of political corruption and 
that he testified before a grand jury about fellow Sen. Joseph B. Montoya 
(D-Whittier). Robbins is said to believe that he is not a target of the 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
"I have made it clear consistently that I was the one legislator who declined 
their offer of money," Robbins said Thursday of the undercover FBI "sting" 
operation. "And, from the Common Cause analysis, I've declined other offers of 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange) also will receive the Common Cause award. 
Lewis is awaiting trial on a felony charge of forgery for his role in the 
mailing of thousands of 1986 campaign letters bearing the phony signature of 
then-President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
The others honored are Assemblymen Steve Clute (D-Riverside), Robert J. 
Campbell (D-Richmond), Chris Chandler (R-Yuba City) and Lloyd G. Connelly 
(D-Sacramento), and freshmen Assemblymen Bob Epple (D-Norwalk), Ted Lempert 
(D-San Mateo) and Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove).

HAWTHORNE FORUM ON URBAN VILLAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hawthorne Community Redevelopment Agency will hold a citywide public forum 
on a proposed $200-million "urban village" June 20 at 7 p.m. in the Sun Room of 
the Hawthorne Memorial Center, 3901 El Segundo Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
The Cloverleaf Group proposal calls for a mix of residential and commercial 
development so people could live and work on the 28-acre site on Rosecrans 
Avenue just west of the San Diego Freeway. The complex would include 500 
condominiums, three hotels, a retail center, movie theaters, a health club and 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The developer, the architect and city redevelopment officials will answer 
questions and hear public comment on the plan.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BARTON HILL HEARING DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the request of the developer, the Los Angeles City Council's Planning and 
Environment Committee has delayed a public hearing on a controversial project 
that calls for 100 condominiums and 68 apartments for senior citizens to be 
built in the Barton Hill section of San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
The project has generated opposition from those who say that the site, 515 N. 
Beacon St., is unsuitable for senior citizens and that the condominiums will 
spark the gentrification of Barton Hill, which is home to many low-income 
people. 
</P>
<P>
About two dozen San Pedro residents, many of them elderly, came to Tuesday's 
committee meeting to oppose the project. The president of the San Pedro 
Peninsula Homeowner's Coalition said his group opposes it. And an aide to Los 
Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores said that at Flores' direction, he, too, 
came to Tuesday's hearing prepared to speak against the project. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Ring, a lawyer for developers George and Michael Tumanjan, said he 
requested the delay because Flores -- whose recommendation will carry weight 
with the committee -- is in the Soviet Union on city business. "I think it's 
appropriate that the councilwoman be in town," he said.

JOB PROGRAMS SOMETHING SPECIAL IN SUMMER FOR DISADVANTAGED YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the mid-1970s, before comedian Whoopi Goldberg was starring in movies and 
receiving standing ovations, she was a poor, black teen-ager in San Diego who 
wasn't sure how to get a break. 
</P>
<P>
Times haven't changed much for some disadvantaged youths in the city. When 
thousands of young San Diegans get out of school and pour into the job market, 
looking for temporary ways to bide their summer time and expenses, those who 
are members of minorities or the poor may find the task more difficult than 
others, contend some civic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
But what worked for Goldberg then, they say, can work for San Diego's youth 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The world-famous actress got a job and broke into acting through Hire-A-Youth, 
one of several programs throughout the county that trains and finds jobs for 
disadvantaged young people. 
</P>
<P>
Programs such as Hire-A-Youth, including similar services of the Urban League 
and the city of San Diego and the county, get youths off the streets and into 
jobs that train, teach and pay, organizers say. 
</P>
<P>
"We serve the hard-to-serve kids. These are kids who have barriers to 
employment, like income and drugs, or they're dropouts or unwed, teen-age 
mothers. Some of them probably have run with gangs or could run with gangs," 
said Earl Parker, marketing director for the Private Industry Council/Regional 
Employment Training Consortium, which oversees Hire-A-Youth. "Our goal is to 
find work for every one of them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pays Minimum Wages 
</P>
<P>
PIC/RETC, a conglomeration of civic groups and private businesses that receives 
$3.6 million from the city, county and federal government, will offer 7,000 
jobs this summer to youths 14 to 21. Since 1983, about 45,000 kids have been 
placed in such Hire-A-Youth jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The jobs, paying the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour, include computer 
processing, clerical work, craft apprenticeships, stockyard work and manual 
labor, program directors say. And innovative work is available as well. Whoopi 
Goldberg, for example, was placed in an acting group through the program, 
Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Mendez will have one of those jobs. Mendez, a junior at San Diego High 
School, entered the program last summer, after fast-food restaurants turned him 
away because of his inexperience. Through Hire-A-Youth, the 17-year-old earned 
the minimum wage by coaching a baseball team and working at a youth center. 
Today, he is taking classes sponsored by PIC/RETC on how to prepare for work, 
and getting ready to start a new job. 
</P>
<P>
Without the program, "I'd probably be doing something I'm not supposed to do," 
said Mendez, whose low-income family lives in Southeast San Diego. "It's easy 
if you don't have a job to get involved in drugs and things like that." 
</P>
<P>
Hire-A-Youth has two components. The first, a program subsidized by federal 
funds, pays public and nonprofit employers, such as the city and the Navy, to 
put young people from low-income families to work. Youth eligible for the 
program are trained on work etiquette and ethics, then receive 180 hours each 
of paid employment. About 3,000 jobs are available through this subsidized 
component of the program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Path to Permanent Work 
</P>
<P>
"We try to match the kids with their interests and desired careers, and the 
employers help the kids with their remedial skills, like reading and writing," 
Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
The second component will offer about 4,000 private sector jobs for youths 16 
to 21, regardless of their family's income. Local businesses request workers, 
and Hire-A-Youth staff try to match the work available to the youths' 
interests, Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
Young people employed through this service may be kept as part- or full-time 
workers after the summer ends. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent Le, 19, got several jobs last summer through the Hire-A-Youth program, 
including two with electronics companies. A Vietnamese immigrant, he was trying 
to make money to support himself and help his parents, who still live in 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
The Hire-A-Youth program "gave me a couple of choices to choose from, and asked 
what type of work I'd like to do," said Le, an electronics repairman whose 
temporary job with Southwest Cable TV is now a full-time position. Le said he 
hopes to be an electronics designer or engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Fitting a youngster's interests to the job is an important part of youth 
employment programs, organizers say. 
</P>
<P>
"This is more than just summer jobs," said Rick Simon, program director for the 
Regional Youth Employment Program, which contracts with PIC/RETC to offer 
Hire-A-Youth in Southeast and downtown San Diego neighborhoods. Other 
contractors offer the program in North County and surrounding areas. 
</P>
<P>
About 90% of the young people employed through Simon's agency are from 
minorities, he said. At least 30% come from welfare families, in which they 
receive little or no exposure to the world of work and paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
"Some kids come in and say, 'I'd like to be a janitor,' because they've never 
been exposed to other opportunities," Simon said. "Our primary purpose is to 
get kids exposed to working. Many of the young people we work with, it's their 
first job, and they need to know how to dress properly, get along with fellow 
workers and know what to expect. The whole idea is to open up opportunities for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Directors of such programs concede that such employment services have some 
problems. Employers don't always trust kids with troubled backgrounds, and some 
inexperienced youngsters find their first jobs too difficult to handle, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The main drawback, though, is that we always have more kids asking for jobs 
than jobs available," Simon said. "There's no end to the number of kids who 
need jobs."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HIGH-VOLTAGE POWER LINES SNAP, START FIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Firefighters were struggling Thursday night to control several grass and brush 
fires that started when two high-voltage power lines apparently snapped and 
fell to the ground in Santa Clarita, the Los Angeles County Fire Department 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The fires, which were burning in an area of about five acres, started about 
9:45 p.m. at a Southern California Edison substation on Magic Mountain Parkway 
east of the Golden State Freeway, Firefighter Bob Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
Seven fire companies were trying to keep the flames away from a motel and golf 
course, about two blocks away, Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>

Goldman said.

SHOULD BEACH-CITY SCHOOL DISTRICTS UNIFY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bob Williams 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the unification process, existing elementary and high school districts 
consolidate to form one kindergarten through 12th grade system (K-12). 
</P>
<P>
* The process begins with a petition in the city or cities that want to unify. 
If signed by 25% or more of registered voters, the petition is reviewed by the 
county Committee on School District organization and then the state Board of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
* If the state board approves the petition, it will call an election in the 
communities affected by the proposed unification. Unification succeeds if a 
majority of voters approve the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The unification process generally takes one to three years. 
</P>
<P>
There are two options available to city elementary districts in Redondo Beach, 
Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach: 
</P>
<P>
TOTAL UNIFICATION 
</P>
<P>
All three districts would unify and take over the South Bay Union High School 
District, which now operates two campuses for students in the three cities -- 
Redondo Union in Redondo Beach and Mira Costa in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
* Proponents say the 10,000-student, K-12 system would operate more efficiently 
with one school board and one staff, and could provide a broader educational 
program. 
</P>
<P>
* Opponents say local control is more important and question the educational 
and financial advantages of a larger system. 
</P>
<P>
SPLIT UNIFICATION 
</P>
<P>
Two K-12 districts would form along city boundaries, one in Redondo Beach and 
one in Manhattan Beach. Each would absorb the portion of the high school 
district within its boundaries. Thus, Redondo Beach would take over Redondo 
Union and Manhattan Beach would get Mira Costa. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosa Beach, which operates one campus with about 700 students, would have 
the option of joining the K-12 systems in either Manhattan Beach or Redondo 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach is already taking steps to form its own K-12 system. Bob Williams

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIREFIGHTERS FIND BODY OF MAN INSIDE BURNING CAR 
NEAR ACTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Homicide detectives were investigating the discovery of a body inside a burning 
car Thursday morning near Acton, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities had not identified the body, which was burned beyond recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters found the body inside the smoldering car about 7 a.m. on Agua 
Dulce Canyon Road half a mile north of Soledad Canyon Road, Deputy Detta 
Roberts said. A .45-caliber handgun was found next to the body, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators did not know whether the gun had been fired, Roberts said, and 
were trying to determine whether the death was a homicide, a suicide or an 
accident.

TORRANCE URGED TO ADOPT INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The news that Torrance Councilman Dan Walker's initiative on banning the use of 
hydrogen fluoride may have qualified for City Council or ballot action has 
brought the expected response from Mobil Oil. Wyman Robb, Mobil's manager, is 
quoted as saying that the probability of a Bhopal-type disaster is "one in a 
billion years." Maybe, but with Mobil's recent accident record, the year might 
well be 1989 or '90. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Robb's statement reveals more than he realizes. His concentration on 
minimizing the probability of a disaster is tacit admission that the magnitude 
of a disaster caused by a major release of hydrogen fluoride would be 
Bhopal-size. There is a lesson too in his continued use of soothing syrup as 
the major attack on the real danger. Mr. Robb says, in effect, "There is no 
real danger." Let's credit him with integrity. He believes there's no real 
danger, so why spend money to eliminate a non-existent peril? I can see 
corporate heads from Exxon, Ford, Cal Nev pipeline, Chernobyl and Three Mile 
Island nodding in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
For the corporate officers, the bottom line is profit. For the people who live 
near Mobil, the priority is staying alive. The Torrance City Council should 
take steps to implement the initiative when it is certified. Arguments about 
the sponsor's motives are irrelevant. A cloud of hydrogen fluoride will kill 
you whether you are running toward Sacramento or away from it. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative is simpler, less drastic and quicker than the current court 
action undertaken by the city of Torrance. A measure coming from the popular 
initiative route may be harder to thwart by hostile court action. In any case, 
it does not contradict the council's action, and two measures for defusing a 
ticking time bomb are better than one.

SHORT-HAUL CARGO SERVICE;

<P>
PILOT FINDS HIS NICHE IN THE SKY

<P>
Even for the casual observer, there is no mistaking Steve Franklin's plane. 
</P>
<P>
The wing sits atop the fuselage with big struts for support. The landing gear 
dangles below. And it is one of the largest single-engine planes ever built. 
</P>
<P>
The plane looks something like an oversized version of Charles Lindbergh's 
Spirit of St. Louis as it drones over downtown Long Beach weekday mornings 
while climbing to its cruising altitude of 3,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin is a kind of airborne, short-haul truck driver. As co-owner of 
Aeronautical Services, he flies freight from Long Beach Airport to Santa 
Catalina Island in his single-engine monster two or three times a day. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old plane is a DeHavilland Otter, a rugged Canadian-built airborne 
workhorse designed for easy maintenance and the short runways commonly found on 
islands. Franklin can cram more than a ton of island-bound packages into the 
fuselage for the 15-minute flight each way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slow Cruising Speed 
</P>
<P>
As planes go, the Otter's 120 m.p.h. cruising speed is so slow that Franklin 
slides the side windows open to cool the cockpit on hot days. 
</P>
<P>
Piloting the plane is "a real comfortable feeling," he said. "I just really 
enjoy flying" it. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin, 41, grew up around flying. He said his father, a former Navy fighter 
pilot, started his own airline after World War II to connect mainland 
Washington with the San Juan Islands. Sold by the family 10 years ago, San Juan 
Airlines remains the oldest commuter air carrier in the nation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin was an Army helicopter pilot in Vietnam. After returning to the United 
States, he eventually started hauling cargo for an old pilot friend who started 
Aeronautical Services 17 years ago. The airline has the United Parcel Service 
contract to fly packages to the San Juan Islands. 
</P>
<P>
UPS executives were so pleased with the little outfit's work that they invited 
the firm to make deliveries to Catalina, Franklin said. The Otter is used 
almost exclusively for UPS deliveries, flying six days a week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delivers Mail 
</P>
<P>
Franklin works with John Wells, who pilots an old twin-engine Beech 18 and 
Grumman Goose seaplane that are operated by an Aeronautical Services 
subsidiary, Catalina Flying Boats, to deliver daily newspapers and mail. 
Franklin said the mail can only be carried on the Beech or Grumman because of a 
requirement that it be hauled on an airplane with two engines. 
</P>
<P>
The outfit sometimes makes special runs. For example, one of the pilots 
recently hauled electronic equipment to the island for a television show. In 
the summer, they haul fresh fish and other supplies for merchants catering to 
the tourist trade. 
</P>
<P>
The day starts early. The bearded Franklin, wearing blue jeans and a blue crew 
shirt, arrives about 6:30 a.m. to prepare the airplane for flight and to load 
cargo. 
</P>
<P>
An hour later, a bulky UPS truck backs up to the fuselage doors of the Otter. 
Franklin and his crew wrestle the heavy parcels into every available inch of 
space in the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Awaits Instructions 
</P>
<P>
After turning the propeller by hand a few times to listen for any noises that 
might spell trouble, Franklin straps himself in the seat and starts the 
600-horsepower engine. He taxis out to the runway and awaits the tower's 
instructions. When the airport has been busy, Franklin said he has had to wait 
up to 40 minutes for permission to take off. 
</P>
<P>
Clear days are best. "I like to take off from Long Beach and look over and see 
Catalina. That's a good day for us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But this time of year, the airport is regularly wrapped in early-morning low 
clouds and haze. 
</P>
<P>
Facing a thicket of fog, Franklin keeps a careful watch on his instruments as 
the baby-blue plane roars off the runway. Gently climbing and turning, the 
plane breaks into a bright blue sky. Ahead lies Catalina, which on this day 
seems to consist of a couple of mountaintops swimming in a sea of luminescent 
clouds. 
</P>
<P>
Below, the ocean was covered by the clouds. Franklin said his cruising altitude 
of 3,000 feet is high enough to give him plenty of time to radio for help if he 
should experience engine failure or another serious malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Marine Life 
</P>
<P>
But he said he flies low enough that he can see all sorts of marine life -- 
schools of tuna, migrating whales, porpoises, an occasional sea turtle. 
</P>
<P>
The mountains of Catalina -- the only land visible ahead -- roll ever closer. 
On one of the mountains sits the short strip of pavement that marks Catalina's 
Airport in the Sky. The facility is nestled in the island's barren interior, 
where the rugged hills are covered with scrubby brush in stark contrast to the 
forest of houses and buildings in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a heck of a nice airport," Franklin said as the air controller welcomed 
him over the radio on a first-name basis. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin lands and taxis the Otter to an unloading area where delivery trucks 
await. If the crew is shorthanded, he said, he sometimes has to make deliveries 
to Avalon or Two Harbors himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He's a Big Wheel 
</P>
<P>
On this day, however, Franklin has a few minutes to head to the old 
Spanish-style terminal, a white concrete building with inlaid decorative tiles, 
for a quick cup of coffee and a chat with Bill Cromshaw, assistant airport 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin is "a big wheel in this little airport," Cromshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
But business is business and as soon as the unloading is done, Franklin hops 
back in the cockpit and is airborne a couple minutes later. On the flight back, 
Franklin carefully lines up the plane's navigational aids and drops into the 
low clouds again for his approach into Long Beach Airport. 
</P>
<P>
He ends up right on the mark. He makes it look easy, but gives some of the 
credit to his airplane. 
</P>
<P>
"There's hardly a pilot who is a real pilot who wouldn't want to fly this 
thing," he said. 
</P>

The Department of Housing and Urban Development will reopen a probe into an 
alleged scheme to rig the awarding of federally subsidized housing in Island 
Park, N.Y., HUD Secretary Jack Kemp announced. At the center of the controversy 
is HUD Region II administrator Geraldine McGann, whose son, Daniel McGann, was 
among those chosen to purchase a $44,500 house in the program. A cousin of 
Republican Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, a longtime resident of Island Park, also 
benefited from the program by buying a home for $40,000, according to a HUD 
audit. The new investigation was triggered by a report in the New York Times 
that officials in Island Park had distributed federally subsidized homes to 
politically connected people and excluded blacks between 1980 and 1984.

A tax on telephone customers to subsidize service for low-income households in 
California is being cut by the state Public Utilities Commission. Effective 
July 1, the tax will fall to 2.5% of a customer's charges for in-state toll 
calls, down from 4%. The tax is used to reduce charges for the 1.3 million 
customers receiving what is known as Lifeline service to half the normal rate. 
The tax reduction was prompted by a surplus in the fund that pays for Lifeline 
service.

The Senate committee reviewing the controversial nomination of William Lucas to 
head the Justice Department's civil rights division has asked him to provide 
about 200,000 pages of documents, a Justice Department spokesman said. A 
committee source denied that that many documents were requested. The source 
refused to disclose what kinds of documents the Senate Judiciary Committee is 
seeking "because we don't want to be unfair to the nominee by raising unfair 
implications about what we're looking at." The department spokesman, David 
Runkel, said that the amount of paper work requested was "unusual." Lucas' 
nomination is opposed by some civil rights groups on the grounds that he lacks 
legal experience in civil rights.

Security forces detained Muslim militants as Egyptians voted in a national 
election seen as a test of the militants' strength. Interior Minister Zaki Badr 
denounced the militants as Iranian-backed saboteurs and confirmed press reports 
that security forces had rounded up Islamic fundamentalists. The opposition 
newspaper Wafd said hundreds were detained ahead of the voting for the Shura 
Council, a consultative body that recommends laws to Parliament. Security 
sources reported scattered incidents of violence but said voting was mostly 
peaceful. The ruling National Democratic Party seemed certain to win a majority 
despite attempts by the militant Muslim Brotherhood to woo voters weary of 
Egypt's economic troubles.

Syrian gunners and their Lebanese Druze allies unleashed a hail of fire on 
Christian ports and neighborhoods in and around Beirut. Security officials said 
Syrian troops used rocket launchers and cannon to pound several Christian 
residential areas and ports north of Beirut. They said Druze gunners in 
mountains southeast of Beirut also bombarded the harbors. Forces of the 
Christian army commander, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, retaliated by shelling Syrian 
and Lebanese artillery positions between apartment buildings on the seafront in 
Muslim West Beirut, they said. Meanwhile, the foreign ministers of Saudi 
Arabia, Morocco and Algeria arrived in Damascus for talks with Syrian leaders 
on ways to end the fighting.

Secretary of Veterans Affairs Edward J. Derwinski said some services to 
veterans will continue to be curtailed until Congress passes a bogged-down bill 
containing $1.2 billion for veterans' programs. The supplemental spending bill 
has been passed by the Senate and House, but lawmakers have added amendments 
for funds for a variety of unrelated projects. The measure must now go to a 
House-Senate conference committee, which has not scheduled a meeting. In a May 
26 directive, the department ordered a freeze on hiring of non-medical 
personnel, a halt in purchases of new equipment and curtailment of treatment 
for claimants with a specified amount of income who have non-service-related 
disabilities.

One of three men who kidnaped and buried a bus full of schoolchildren 13 years 
ago has been denied a parole for the 10th time. Richard Schoenfeld, 35, who is 
serving a life sentence, is still a danger to society, a Board of Prison Terms 
panel decided. Schoenfeld was convicted for his role in the Chowchilla 
kidnaping of 26 schoolchildren and their driver from the rural San Joaquin 
Valley town for $5 million ransom. Schoenfeld, his brother, James, and 
Frederick N. Woods commandeered the bus on July 15, 1976, and took it 100 miles 
to Livermore. There they shut the victims in a poorly ventilated moving van 
buried in a quarry. It took the group 16 hours to dig to safety through the 
wood- and earth-covered hole.

Israel has rejected a Syrian offer to exchange the body of an Israeli soldier 
for 21 Palestinian fighters held in Israeli jails, Israeli and Palestinian 
sources say. Defense Ministry officials would not comment on the report. The 
sources said Syria offered to return the body of Sgt. Samir Assad, one of six 
missing Israeli soldiers, in exchange for 21 guerrillas from the Palestine 
Liberation Organization's mainstream Fatah faction who were captured when 
Israeli forces attacked their boat off the Lebanese coast last year. Israel had 
reported that only seven guerrillas survived, but the sources said 21 were 
captured alive. In 1985, Israel exchanged 1,150 Palestinian prisoners for three 
captive Israeli soldiers. But the lopsided swap was condemned in Israel, and 
there has been no such exchange since.

U.S. military attack, according to Sandinista military and non-diplomatic U.S. 
sources in Managua. The shipments included dozens of AK-47 assault rifles, 
ammunition and other arms for guerrilla warfare, such as grenade launchers and 
light artillery, the sources said. The Sandinistas were told that some, if not 
all, the weapons are being used to equip the so-called Dignity Battalions, a 
militia formed by Noriega. State Department spokesman Adam Shub said "we can 
confirm" that Nicaragua sent the weapons.

The federal judge who presided over the breakup of AT&amp;T has been assigned 
the Iran-Contra case of former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter. 
U.S. District Judge Harold Greene was given the case in a two-paragraph order 
signed by Chief Judge Aubrey Robinson, who has been handling the pretrial 
proceedings. Robinson said in the order that he was handing the matter over to 
Greene because "the case will be protracted and complex." Robinson is also 
handling pretrial hearings in the Iran-Contra case of Richard V. Secord, who 
asked Robinson in a court session not to consolidate a dozen criminal charges 
against him contained in two separate indictments.

A teen-age gang member and a 16-year-old female companion have been arrested in 
the shooting death of a 15-year-old girl who had just gotten out of the 
suspect's car on a Mid-City street, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Cater, 15, was shot and killed about 12:40 a.m. Tuesday on Arlington 
Avenue, Detective Paul Mize said. 
</P>
<P>
Cater and a girlfriend had just gotten out of a car at Arlington Avenue and 
25th Street and had walked about a block and a half when the driver of the car 
pulled up, got out and fired at least three shots, Mize said. 
</P>
<P>
Cater died at the scene. Her friend was not injured, he said. "We're 
investigating this as a gang-related shooting," Mize said.

Later Tuesday, police arrested and booked Olyric Robinson, 18, a known gang 
member, on suspicion of murder.

Di Giorgio Has Another Suitor: Di Giorgio Corp., the San Francisco food and 
building materials company that fought off a hostile takeover attempt and 
restructured itself last year, has another suitor. Investor Arthur Goldberg of 
Somerset, N.J., who holds 14.1% of Di Giorgio's shares, offered to buy the 
company for $30 a share, or about $153 million. The company said it would 
respond "in due course." Di Giorgio shares jumped $3 to close at $31 on the New 
York Stock Exchange after the offer was disclosed.

McCaw Wants Lin to Halt TV Spinoff: McCaw Cellular Communications, which 
announced this week that it is bidding $6.5 billion for Lin Broadcasting, said 
the offer for its rival was conditioned on Lin halting its planned spinoff of 
seven broadcast television stations. In a filing with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, McCaw, the nation's largest cellular telephone company, 
said the spinoff would "materially reduce the value of the company's common 
stock outstanding" and incur substantial costs. If Lin carries out the planned 
spinoff, McCaw said it would either reduce its $120-a-share offer for the 
broadcasting and cellular communications company or withdraw it altogether.

Eastern Seeks Pilots' Concessions: Eastern Airlines is asking its striking 
pilots for $20 million in wage and benefits concessions as part of its 
restructuring plan, a company spokesman said. The pilots, members of the Air 
Line Pilots Assn., who are striking in sympathy with Eastern's machinists, 
denounced the move as a "public relations hoax." ALPA said the latest company 
demands for concessions were nothing more than a "paper trail" to the doors of 
bankruptcy court, where Frank Lorenzo, head of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp. 
and considered an antagonist of organized labor, plans to "file for abrogation 
of our contract."

WINCHELL'S SAYS BOARD MAY SELL 'DONUT HOUSES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Winchell's Donut Houses, which has been struggling to boost sales and profits, 
said Thursday that it might put itself up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The news was met with enthusiasm on Wall Street. The La Mirada-based company, 
which is organized as a limited partnership, posted the largest percentage gain 
-- 27.2% -- on the New York Stock Exchange. Winchell's units, which are 
comparable to shares, rose 75 cents to close at $3.50. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came one day after TW Services, which owns 42% of Winchell's, 
agreed to be acquired by a New York investment firm in a deal valued at $1.65 
billion. But executives said the potential sale of the 657-store doughnut chain 
is not related to the TW takeover by Coniston Partners. 
</P>
<P>
"Winchell's clearly is something that the company has had some difficulty 
with," said Gus Oliver, a general partner with Coniston. "We certainly support 
the selling of it. It's best disposed of." 
</P>
<P>
TW also owns Denny's coffee shops and El Pollo Loco restaurants, both of which 
Coniston has said it intends to keep. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement, Winchell's said that a special committee of its board had 
"been appointed to consider various methods of maximizing unit holder values, 
including a possible sale of the partnership." 
</P>
<P>
The market value of Winchell's, based on the closing price of its units 
Thursday, is nearly $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
Terrence J. Wallock, general counsel for Denny's and Winchell's, said the 
decision was made to explore a potential sale after "we received a number of 
unsolicited inquiries about the company." 
</P>
<P>
Wallock would not identify any person or group. 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely wouldn't be interested in buying the whole thing," said Richard 
N. Hart, vice president of Boston-based Dunkin Donuts, the nation's largest 
doughnut chain. Unlike Winchell's, whose stores are mostly company-owned, 
Dunkin's nearly 1,800 stores are almost all operated by franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
"With their (low) volumes and their difficulty in attracting quality managers, 
we think the franchise route is much better than running company-owned 
outlets," Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
Winchell's has been beset with financial and legal problems since it was spun 
off from Denny's about 2 1/2-years ago. Denny's sold 58% of the doughnut chain 
to the public for $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rapid Drop in Value 
</P>
<P>
But within months of the sale, Winchell's reported an $11.5-million loss for 
1986. Winchell's shares, which initially traded at $18, sank to below $4 and 
numerous shareholders filed lawsuits. The suits are still pending. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials also said Winchell's suffered from poor and unattentive 
management. Under TW, stores began to remodel interiors and introduce new 
products, such as muffins. 
</P>
<P>
Yet problems remain. For the first three months of 1989, Winchell's lost $3.35 
million on sales of $36.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Winchell's was founded in 1948 when Verne H. Winchell opened a single shop in 
Temple City. In 1968, he sold the company to Denny's in exchange for stock and 
became chairman of the chain. He has since left the company.

Allegheny Denied Extension: A U. S. bankruptcy court judge has denied a request 
by Allegheny International to extend for six weeks its exclusive right to plan 
its reorganization under Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws. The judge's decision 
clears the way for the appliance maker's creditors to file their own 
reorganization plans, which could include proposals to sell all or part of the 
company. The extension would have been Allegheny's 10th since filing for 
protection from creditors in February, 1988; the latest period expired June 2. 
"There's almost a disease abroad," said Judge Joseph Cosetti, announcing his 
decision. "When you don't know what to do, you delay."

On the brighter side, the agency said the airlines were detecting 93% of

PERU DEVALUES CURRENCY HURT BY DRUG TRADE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Peru moved to wrest control of exchange rates from the drug trade Thursday, 
devaluing the inti by about 1% as the start of a plan to bring order to its 
currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
The devaluation was the first in a government program of daily 
mini-devaluations aimed at easing the instability of exchange rates caused 
mainly by infusions of dollars from the narcotics trade. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot allow exchange rates to remain in the hands of the drug trade and 
those who do not care about the country," Economy Minister Cesar Vasquez Bazan 
told Congress in speech on Tuesday announcing the plan. 
</P>
<P>
He said the so-called parallel or informal exchange rate had become "driven by 
supply and demand from the drug trade" and speculation. Peru is the world's 
biggest cocaine producer. 
</P>
<P>
The 0.99% devaluation brought the official exchange rate to 2,045.25 intis to 
the dollar from 2,025. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Artificial Stress 
</P>
<P>
The parallel dollar rate seesawed on the program's first day, reflecting 
uncertainty among speculators despite Vasquez Bazan's goal of stabilizing 
currency markets. The inti fell to 2,900 to the dollar by early afternoon from 
Wednesday's closing rate of 3,125 intis. 
</P>
<P>
Economists praised the mini-devaluation plan as a tool to bring order to 
exchange rates that have fluctuated widely since late last year. A large 
infusion of drug dollars puts artificial stress on the banking system. 
</P>
<P>
"We should move towards a realistic exchange rate, not one set by the drug 
trade or oligarchic groups," said economist Manuel Lajo, quoted by the local 
Andina news agency. 
</P>
<P>
But Lajo and other economists said Vasquez Bazan, President Alan Garcia's sixth 
economy minister, was too sketchy on what he would do to hold back inflation 
after it hit nearly 500% in the first four months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The illicit cocaine trade is virtually the only economic activity currently 
thriving in Peru, where industry has fallen into its worst slump of this 
century, economists say.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market churned ahead Thursday, squeezing a little more mileage out of 
its recent rally fueled by takeover news and rumors and declining interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 4.59 to 2,516.91, bringing its gain 
over the past three sessions to 36.21 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 212.31 million shares, against 
213.71 million the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow finished the day just short of last Friday's post-crash high of 
2,517.83 and still more than 200 points below its 1987 peak. 
</P>
<P>
However, the index at the American Stock Exchange climbed to a record, topping 
its best levels recorded in the summer of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
New takeover bids this week for Time Inc. and Lin Broadcasting touched off 
buying in a wide range of stocks thought to be possible candidates for 
acquisitions or buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
Eastman Kodak, said to be a potential target, climbed 3/8 to 50 7/8 in heavy 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mattel Declines 
</P>
<P>
Time stock, meanwhile, dropped 2 to 168 and Lin lost 4 1/2 to 125 in the 
over-the-counter market after both experienced dramatic run-ups in Wednesday's 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
Mattel shares continued to decline, despite an assurance from the Hawthrone toy 
maker that production in China continued without interruption. Mattel closed at 
12 7/8, down 1/8, on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
The company produces 25% of its toys -- including Barbie clothes and 
accessories, Disney preschool toys and P. J. Sparkles doll -- at two factories 
1,500 miles from Beijing near the Hong Kong border. Mattel said it could 
quickly shift production to factories in Manila, Mexico or Europe, if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Burlington Resources, the volume leader among NYSE issues, fell 2 to 44 3/8. 
Pennzoil, which had been considered a possible bidder for Burlington, sold its 
stake of 11.7 million shares in a block at 45 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Pennzoil, having reaped a healthy profit on the investment, gained 4 5/8 to 84 
5/8. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the takeover hubbub, analysts say the market has benefited from signs 
this week that the Federal Reserve might be starting to change course in its 
credit policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Energy Mostly Lower 
</P>
<P>
After more than a year of tightening credit conditions, the Fed is widely 
believed to have made an initial step toward easing, by permitting a decline in 
the interest rate on federal funds, or overnight loans between banks. 
</P>
<P>
Energy stocks were mostly lower amid skepticism that members of the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would adhere to oil production 
quotas set this week. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon dropped 1/2 to 43 3/4; Texaco slipped 1/4 to 49 5/8; Amoco fell 1 3/8 to 
43 3/8; Atlantic Richfield dropped 1 3/4 to 91 5/8, and Chevron fell, 1 1/2 to 
53 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices closed sharply higher in heavy trading Thursday on the London 
Stock Exchange amid a favorable economic background and some institutional 
buying. The Financial Times 100-share index finished 25.5 points, or 1.2% 
higher at 2,143.4. 
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-share Nikkei index closed the day at 
33,718.29, gaining 91.40 points. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Grain and soybean futures prices declined on the Chicago Board of Trade because 
of continued pressure from favorable weather forecasts and slack demand. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, copper prices were up while precious metals were down; energy 
prices rallied; livestock and meat futures were down, and sugar and cotton 
prices rose. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures, which have been declining because of the political turmoil in 
China, were off for the third consecutive trading session. Analysts say the 
problems in China may mean that country won't place new orders for U.S. wheat. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some concern over China and additional wheat sales, but the market 
lacked any real direction," Frank Kouba, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton 
in Chicago, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures were mixed, getting a boost from a threatened sales boycott by 
Brazilian farmers who say they are worried about their government's exchange 
rate policy. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, dockworkers in Brazil are threatening another nationwide port 
strike, which would hamper Brazilian soybean exports. 
</P>
<P>
Corn prices were pressured by light demand and reports of improved growing 
conditions in major crop areas. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat settled 0.25 cent to 1.50 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in 
July at $3.8175 a bushel; corn was 3 cents to 5 cents lower, with July at 
$2.5325 a bushel; oats were 1.50 cents to 2.50 cents higher, with July at $1.65 
a bushel, and soybeans were 5.75 cents lower to 3 cents higher, with July at 
$7.14 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures moved higher on New York's Commodity Exchange on speculation 
about supply disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
The start of contract talks next week between U.S. producers and their unions, 
with the possibility of strikes, and the continued closure of Bougainville 
Copper Ltd.'s Papua, New Guinea, mine boosted prices, said Bette Raptopoulos, 
an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Copper settled 1.10 cents to 2.50 cents higher with June at $1.35 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Precious metals prices declined as the dollar showed renewed strength. 
</P>
<P>
Gold settled $2.60 to $3.10 lower, with June at $373.50 an ounce; silver was 
2.1 cents to 2.7 cents lower, with June at $5.443 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Energy futures mostly were higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange in 
reaction to promises by Kuwait to cut back oil production. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheik Ali al Khalifa al Sabah said his country intended to 
produce 1.35 million barrels a day in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries signed a new 
production accord that placed Kuwait's new quota at 1.093 million barrels. Its 
current output is estimated at nearly 2 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
Livestock and meat futures were mixed in lackluster trading on the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices moved moderately higher as traders grew more optimistic about the 
economy ahead of the government's producer price report, which is to be 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The credit market's bellwether 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/4 point, or $2.50 
for every $1,000 in face amount, after rising nearly a full point on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, fell to 
8.29% -- its lowest level since February, 1988 -- from 8.31%. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the bias in the market seems to be in an upward direction," said 
Elizabeth Ginste Reiners, a vice president with Dean Witter Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other for 
short-term loans, was unchanged at 9.375% 
</P>
<P>
A decline in the fed funds rate during the past few weeks has been interpreted 
by analysts as a sign that the Fed is shifting toward a more generous credit 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar finished mixed against foreign currencies in light trading ahead of 
today's release of figures on U.S. wholesale price inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices moved lower. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen and French franc but fell against 
other major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the dollar rose briefly against the West German mark on rumors 
that U.S. citizens were injured or killed in China. The dollar eased after the 
U.S. State Department said it had no information to confirm those reports. 
</P>
<P>
Traders were uncertain about how the dollar might be affected by the Labor 
Department's report on the Producer Price Index for May. 
</P>
<P>
Cases could be made that either a big inflation increase or a small one was 
good for the dollar, said Craig Sloane, a currency analyst at Smith Barney, 
Harris Upham &amp; Co. On the other hand, he said, the dollar also could fall 
in reaction to a big or small increase. 
</P>
<P>
Gold moved lower in London to a late price of $373.25 an ounce, from $375.65 
Wednesday. In Zurich, the bid price was $374.35, down 15 cents from late 
Wednesday.

HENLEY TO BUY OUT FISHER STOCK; DEAL WORTH UP TO $125 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In a transaction with a potential value of $125 million, Henley Group said 
Thursday that it plans to buy back the 20% of Fisher Scientific Group stock 
that it does not own. 
</P>
<P>
Most of that 20% was distributed as a stock dividend to Henley shareholders in 
April, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Henley also said Fisher Chairman Richard Cramer is resigning from his other job 
as chief executive but will stay on as chairman. In an interview, Cramer said 
he plans to devote more time to community activities and to starting up 
biomedical companies in the San Diego area. Henley Group President Paul 
Montrone will become Fisher's new chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Cramer, who has made a fortune starting biomedical companies -- including IVAC, 
IMED and Versaflex Delivery Systems -- will do well on his Fisher holdings as 
well. His 1 million shares are worth more than $20 million. Cramer and other 
Fisher executives bought Fisher stock through an equity purchase plan, putting 
10% down and borrowing the rest of the purchase price from the company at 
favorable terms. 
</P>
<P>
Henley's buyout, which would be equal to $20.50 a share, must be approved by a 
special committee of five Fisher directors who are not members of management at 
either Henley or Fisher. Approval is expected within 30 to 60 days, Cramer said 
Thursday. Fisher stock closed unchanged at $19.25 a share in Thursday trading 
on the over-the-counter market. 
</P>
<P>
Cramer said Fisher "didn't work out" as an independent public company, in part 
because Henley lost its bid to take over Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. in 
1988. Henley had planned to sell the remainder of its interest in Fisher to 
finance such a takeover. With a takeover no longer in the offing, Henley lost 
its motivation to spin off Fisher, Cramer said. 
</P>
<P>
Based in La Jolla, Fisher Scientific, which makes medical and research supplies 
and instrumentation, reported net income of $38 million on sales of $957 
million for fiscal 1988. The previous year it earned $30 million on sales of 
$908 million.

LINCOLN S&amp;L INSURANCE UNITS TO BE SOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal regulators said Thursday that they plan to sell the major insurance 
operation of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan to a Dallas investment 
firm. The price was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The insurance operation is part of a Lincoln subsidiary that filed for 
bankruptcy court protection on April 13, along with Lincoln's parent company, 
American Continental Corp., and 10 other S&amp;L subsidiaries. Lincoln was 
seized by regulators the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators said they intend to sell Continental Fidelity Insurance Co. and its 
operating unit, American Founders Life Insurance Co., to Zlogar &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Zlogar had been negotiating with Phoenix-based American Continental to purchase 
the insurance operation before American Continental filed its Chapter 11 
bankruptcy petition. Under the bankruptcy filing, executives at American 
Continental remain in control of the holding company, but regulators control 
the Lincoln subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase price in the current deal was not revealed, but it is all cash and 
higher than the value of the cash-and-notes deal that Zlogar had worked out 
with American Continental, said Al Zlogar, the Dallas firm's president. The 
value of the previous deal was a little less than $45 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The deal still must be approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"We're elated," Zlogar said. "The insurance companies are healthy and rated 
A-excellent by A.M. Best Co. (an industry rating firm). We intend to maintain 
that rating or better it." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to buy the insurance operation, he said, was "95% based on the 
management of company." He said he was "very impressed" with current managers, 
who would remain in place after the purchase and help expand the company. 
</P>
<P>
American Founders, with $300 million in assets, is licensed in 37 states and 
operates in 23. 
</P>
<P>
Mark M. Connally, an American Continental spokesman, said it was too early to 
know if the company would object to the proposed sale.

SENATE PANEL BACKS FIRST CAP ON IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE MAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday approved substantial changes in the 
nation's immigration system, including the imposition for the first time in 
U.S. history of a cap on annual immigration. 
</P>
<P>
The limitation was assailed vigorously by Latino and Asian immigrant groups, 
which asserted that it would prevent many family members from joining relatives 
in this country. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's 12-2 vote sends the measure to the Senate floor, where it is 
given a good chance of passage. Its chances in the House are uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would create a new category of immigrants for admission -- 
people with skills that are in short supply in the United States -- and 
restrict the number of visas to 600,000, with 480,000 reserved for family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Although supporters of the bill noted that the ceiling represents an increase 
over current levels, opponents pointed out that under the legislation 55,000 
visas would go to an existing category of skilled and professional immigrants, 
who do not necessarily have family ties in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
A new category of 54,000 visas would be allocated through a "point system" that 
awards credit based on education, age and occupation. And 11,000 would be set 
aside for ministers and other "special immigrants," including 6,000 
"investors." 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like we're getting more when we're getting less," said Cecilia Munoz 
of the National Council of La Raza. "This legislation would completely 
undermine family sponsored immigration." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Something Valuable to Offer 
</P>
<P>
Brushing aside such objections, Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.), a committee 
member and architect of the 1986 revision of the law dealing with illegal 
immigration, called the move to accommodate skilled workers and educated 
professionals a desirable way of bringing in "classic immigrants" -- those with 
something valuable to offer the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Many immigrant advocates have interpreted such comments as criticism of the 
current patterns of immigration, in which only about 10% of the immigrants come 
from Europe while huge numbers come from Latin America and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who has been under pressure in Massachusetts 
-- home to many European immigrants -- to make European immigration easier, 
joined forces with Simpson to push the legislation in the Senate. In this 
atmosphere, the legislation has been called, only half-jokingly, "the Irish 
immigration bill." 
</P>
<P>
But Kennedy, defending the measure during the committee session, asserted that 
it "will increase immigration opportunities from the 'old seed' traditional 
sources, such as the European countries, without reducing opportunities for 
immigrants from newer sources, such as Latin America and Asia." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Simpson acknowledged that, in tackling the issue, the committee 
was confronting "emotion, fear, guilt and racism." 
</P>
<P>
In debating the legislation, the committee rejected a provision that would have 
given potential immigrants "points" for their proficiency in English. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), who led the opposition to the English provision, said 
before it was defeated: "We've never done this before in our history. Some of 
our parents, our ancestors, could not have emigrated if there had been points 
for English." 
</P>
<P>
The English provision would have carried 20 points. A person would need a 
minimum of 45 points to qualify for one of the 54,000 visas in the point system 
category. The rest of the system remains in place. For example, 10 points are 
awarded to people ages 21 to 35, and five points go to people ages 36 to 45. 
</P>
<P>
A person could receive 10 points for a high school diploma, 10 for a bachelor's 
degree and five for a graduate degree. The criteria of occupational demand and 
occupational training would carry 20 points each. These categories would be 
evaluated by the Labor Department to determine how important they are to the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The 600,000 annual cap on visas would remain in place for three years. At the 
end of three years and every three years thereafter, the Administration would 
be required to recommend changes in the levels.

DAY-CARE HOME FIRE KILLS 2 INFANTS; 
</P>
<P>
3 HURT IN HUNTINGTON BEACH; PASSERS-BY TRY TO SAVE BABIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite heroic efforts from several passers-by, two infants died and two other 
children were injured in a fast-moving fire that gutted a licensed family 
day-care center Thursday morning in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I had nothing but a hose," said Dennis Drew, who frantically sprayed water at 
the home's flaming front door before firefighters arrived. "The lady was 
screaming and yelling that there were children in there, but you couldn't 
breathe and you couldn't see and you couldn't touch anything . . . Even the 
firemen, when they came out, started crying after seeing those babies." 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials, who found no smoke detectors in the rubble, believe the blaze 
may have been caused by a faulty television set. 
</P>
<P>
The dead infants were identified as Jessica Jordan of Huntington Beach, who 
would have been 8 months old today, and 13-month-old John H. Reilly IV, 
according to fire officials and relatives of the children. 
</P>
<P>
Jessica's mother, Susan Jordan, burst into tears after fire officials at the 
scene told her about her daughter's death. "Oh, my God!" she screamed as crisis 
intervention workers escorted her to a van. 
</P>
<P>
John H. Reilly III, the father of the 13-month-old, stared in disbelief at the 
charred home at 5122 Audrey Drive when he arrived there Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
"He was our only child," said Reilly, his eyes filling with tears. "I can't 
believe it happened. How can something like this happen so quickly?" 
</P>
<P>
Of the other two children at the home, Devon Strayer, 3, of Huntington Beach, 
was treated at Humana Hospital and released, while Nick Duncan, 6 months, 
remained hospitalized at UCI Medical Center in Orange with second- and 
third-degree burns, said Martha Werth, a public information officer for the 
Huntington Beach Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
The day-care provider, Pat Orozco, 49, was hospitalized in fair condition with 
smoke inhalation and second-degree burns on her arms and shoulders. Also 
hospitalized for smoke inhalation were Huntington Beach firefighter Chris 
Gruber and Bill Applebee, a Huntington Beach water department employee who 
tried to rescue the children from the burning house. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials are investigating reports that the fire may have started in one 
of two television sets in the home, said Tom Huntley, an investigator with the 
Huntington Beach Fire Department's fire prevention bureau. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no statements to show that there was any negligence in this fire," 
Huntley said. "Everything we have shows that it is an accidental fire." 
</P>
<P>
Huntley said investigators have found no evidence of smoke alarms in the house, 
though there may have been a fire extinguisher in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Under state day-care licensing requirements, providers who baby-sit up to six 
children have the option of equipping their homes with either smoke detectors 
or fire extinguishers, said Dianne M. Edwards, director of adult and employment 
services for the Orange County Social Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
However, the state building code requires family day-care providers to have 
both fire extinguishers and smoke detectors, said Steve Viero, supervisor of 
field operations for the state fire marshal. Viero could not explain why the 
two codes differ, or whose responsibility it is to enforce the smoke-detector 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview from her bed at Long Beach Memorial Hospital, Orozco said she 
was coming out of the kitchen and entering the living room when she turned 
around and saw the fire. Orozco said she grabbed two children and took them 
outside but was unable to get back into the house to retrieve the other two. 
</P>
<P>
"The flames were overwhelming," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she knew how the fire started or where the flames were coming from, 
Orozco just weakly shook her head. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all kind of blank right now," she said. "I did my best." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said Orozco ran from the house with a child in her arms after the 
fire broke out at 9:56 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"She was going crazy," said Kevin Mohl, 26, a Huntington Beach resident who 
happened to be driving by the stucco house. "She was trying to get the babies 
out. She was going into hysterics." 
</P>
<P>
Both of the children were found dead in a back room, Werth said, Jessica on the 
floor and John in a crib. Fire officials speculated that Orozco might have 
tried to carry Jessica from a nearby swing but ended up dropping the child and 
losing her in the thick smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteer therapists coordinated by the American Red Cross spent about 15 
minutes with Susan and Donald Jordan, Jessica's parents, before the couple 
emerged from a white van to look at Orozco's house. Wrapped in a white blanket, 
Susan Jordan sat on the curb across the street from Orozco's house, her 
husband's arm wrapped around one shoulder. The couple then went inside a 
neighbor's house and left the fire scene several hours later. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they just need to be held and have a shoulder to cry on," said Linda 
M. Johnson, a licensed family therapist from Huntington Beach who helped 
console the distraught Susan Jordan. "Once the shock ends, then the grief 
begins. This is the beginning for them, not the end." 
</P>
<P>
A fund for all the families involved in the fire has been set up by the 
Mortgage Network of Anaheim, which is Susan Jordan's employer. 
</P>
<P>
Before 11 fire units arrived from Huntington Beach and Westminster, several 
people tried to dash into the burning house to rescue the children. Among them 
was Applebee, who doused himself with a hose and tried to search a room at the 
back of the house where the fire is believed to have started. 
</P>
<P>
"He went in and got three or four stuffed animals out, then the roof 
collapsed," said David Hansen, 25, an Arrowhead Water employee who assisted in 
the rescue attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Orozco's mother, Lillian Brazamontes of Westminster, said her daughter had been 
baby-sitting children for about 15 years. However, it was not until last year 
that she applied for a family day-care license, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 2,400 licensed family day-care facilities in Orange County, 
Edwards said. There are hundreds of unlicensed homes that county social workers 
investigate whenever they receive reports of them. 
</P>
<P>
Following up on such a tip, inspector Tiia Mikkelsaar visited Orozco's home 
unannounced on April 30, 1987, and determined that at least three children were 
being cared for, according to agency records. 
</P>
<P>
Orozco was not home at the time, but her mother told the inspector that she 
would relay the information to her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
When Mikkelsaar returned to the home six weeks later, Orozco had attended a 
two-hour orientation course for family day-care providers and taken out an 
application for a license. 
</P>
<P>
She was given a license to care for up to six children on March 14, 1988. The 
licenses are valid for three years, and each home must be inspected before a 
license is renewed. Orozco's home had no outstanding deficiencies or 
complaints, and her file showed no recurring problems, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
When Mikkelsaar visited Orozco's home the day the license was issued, she noted 
in her report that Orozco had put a fire extinguisher in her kitchen to correct 
one of several deficiencies that were noted during an earlier inspection. 
</P>
<P>
The only complaint the agency received against Orozco came about a year ago 
from parents who said their infant had developed a skin infection at the 
day-care home. When Mikkelsaar investigated, she found no problems at the home, 
and Orozco said the complaint was probably made by a couple who had withdrawn 
their child from her care after he developed diaper rash, said Susan Martinez, 
county supervisor of day-care licensing. 
</P>
<P>
Orozco said the couple filed the complaint against her because they owed her 
money. Orozco was suing them in small claims court, Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said that when she was an inspector, she used to advise family 
day-care providers to put smoke detectors in their home rather than relying 
solely on fire extinguishers for safety. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy watching six children," Martinez said. "And yet we get a lot of 
flak about the limits we place on them (day-care providers)."

STRINGENT NEW SMOG CONTROLS ON CARS ORDERED

<TEXT>
<P>
In a major boost toward cleaning up the smoggy Los Angeles Basin, the state Air 
Resources Board on Thursday ordered stringent new tailpipe emission controls on 
cars and pickup trucks beginning in the 1993 model year. 
</P>
<P>
The standard was approved on an 8-0 vote over the objections of automobile 
manufacturers, who warned that it would be too costly and technologically 
difficult to meet. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District and some environmentalists 
praised the new standard as a major step forward, although they said the plan 
does not go far enough and takes too long to go into effect. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expected Effect 
</P>
<P>
The new rules would reduce carbon monoxide emissions from new cars by 50% and 
emissions of smog-forming hydrocarbons by 30% by 1997 -- the end of a 
three-year phase-in period. The rules, Chrysler Motors engineer Gordon E. 
Allardyce told the board, would raise the price of new cars from $200 to $330. 
The ARB's estimate is $65 per car. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since 1977 that the resources board had tightened its 
hydrocarbon standard. The carbon monoxide standard was last revised in 1981. 
Hydrocarbons are produced by unburned fuel, such as gasoline vapors that leak 
from a car's fuel system. Poisonous carbon monoxide gas is produced by burning 
fuel. 
</P>
<P>
'We think this is one of the . . . most important rules the ARB will consider 
in the next two or three years," said Paul Wuebben, manager of the AQMD's clean 
fuels program. He called the action "the first significant litmus test of the 
ARB's commitment" in supporting the AQMD's 20-year plan to bring the South 
Coast Air Basin into compliance with federal clean air standards. 
</P>
<P>
Hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen are the major ingredients of photochemical 
smog. Until now, because of limits in technology, the board has focused mainly 
on emissions of nitrogen oxides, which also are produced by engine combustion. 
</P>
<P>
The state board also voted to require that auto makers design smog control 
devices to control emissions for at least 100,000 miles -- double the current 
durability requirement -- beginning in 1993. California would become the first 
state to impose such a stringent smog control standard. More than 60% of cars 
in California have been driven more than 50,000 miles, and account for almost 
70% of pollution from automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, as the new, cleaner cars replace older models, emissions of 
hydrocarbons would be cut by 70 tons a day statewide. Carbon monoxide emissions 
would be reduced by 1,000 tons a day statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Half of those reductions would occur in the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, 
Riverside and San Bernardino, which make up the South Coast Air Basin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meeting U.S. Standards 
</P>
<P>
Gladys Meade, environmental manager of the American Lung Assn. of California, 
said the state's action is "critically important" to the success of the AQMD's 
clean air plan to attain federal clean air standards for carbon monoxide, ozone 
and nitrogen dioxide within 20 years. The AQMD board approved the strategy last 
March. 
</P>
<P>
The reductions would amount to 10% of the four-county basin's current carbon 
monoxide emissions of between 4,500 and 5,000 tons a day, and about 5% of 
current hydrocarbon emissions from motor vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Wuebben said the ARB could have done better. He said the 
100,000-mile durability requirement should take effect in 1994, instead of 
being phased in through 1997. 
</P>
<P>
"This is simply too long, given the gravity of Southern California's air 
quality problem," Wuebben told the ARB. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Air Resources Board executive officer James Boyd accused Wuebben 
of using "inflammatory" language and "grandstanding" in urging the ARB to go 
further. Boyd vowed to take up the issue with Wuebben's boss, AQMD executive 
officer James M. Lents. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Wuebben said he was astonished and "disappointed" by Boyd's outburst. "I 
couldn't believe Boyd, in front of everyone in public, saying those things," 
Wuebben said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, John White of the Sierra Club charged that the ARB plan 
"reflects excessive caution." 
</P>
<P>
"In my view, the proposal simply does not go far enough fast enough, given the 
magnitude of the impact which vehicular emissions have on the severity of 
ozone, visibility and atmospheric acidity levels throughout California, 
especially in Southern California and the inland valleys of the north," White 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Similar objections were raised in a letter to the resources board signed by 
state Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside) and Assemblyman Byron D. Sher (D-Palo 
Alto). 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, automobile manufacturers generally said they could comply with part of 
the new standard requiring cars rolling off assembly lines to meet more 
stringent carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emission standards. The current 
hydrocarbon limit is .39 grams per mile. It would be reduced to .25 grams per 
mile at 50,000 miles and .31 grams per mile at 100,000 miles under the new 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
The carbon monoxide limit would be pushed down to 3.4 grams per mile at 50,000 
miles and 4.1 grams per mile at 100,000 miles. It is now a flat 7 grams per 
mile. 
</P>
<P>
But auto makers warned that it would be difficult for them to give assurances 
that a tough standard could be met after a car had been on the road for 100,000 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposal would push emission control system development to the very edge 
of feasibility," said Joe Calhoun of General Motors.

BUSH EXPLORING BOLD NEW CUTS IN LONG-RANGE ARMS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Flushed with favorable reaction to his proposals to reduce conventional 
weaponry in Europe, President Bush is exploring radical new offers to slash 
long-range nuclear missiles when arms talks with the Soviet Union resume June 
19, Administration and other arms experts said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"The White House has the view that the bold, outside-the-bureaucracy approach 
paid off with the President's proposal to NATO," one Administration official 
said. "So it is intent on doing something bold in START." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration recognizes that taking a radical new direction risks 
stalemating the strategic arms reduction talks (START), sources said. Under 
former President Ronald Reagan, negotiators in Geneva largely settled on new 
levels for many key nuclear weapons systems. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush may be prepared to test whether Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, 
if pushed, is ready to make greater concessions than had been expected, much as 
he has in the conventional arms field. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration also wants to put an identifiable Bush stamp on U.S. arms 
policies -- to "Bush-ify" them, as one official said -- by giving significantly 
greater focus to enhancing the nuclear balance rather than simply reducing the 
numbers of weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes reductions do not enhance stability. Both Brent Scowcroft, Bush's 
national security adviser, and his mentor, former Secretary of State Henry A. 
Kissinger, for example, have warned that the START agreement could make U.S. 
land-based missiles more vulnerable to a Soviet surprise attack. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the new ideas under consideration would seek to enhance stability by 
curbing fixed-base missiles carrying multiple warheads. These missiles, the 
most powerful and accurate in the U.S. and Soviet arsenals, are also the most 
useful to carry out a surprise attack. For that reason, they are also the most 
tempting targets for an enemy surprise attack. 
</P>
<P>
"The Administration has been searching for new ideas for START almost from its 
inauguration," said one expert who asked not to be named. "But since Brussels, 
the heat has turned up. They are sure looking hard for some gimmick." 
</P>
<P>
It was at a North Atlantic Treaty Organization's summit meeting in Brussels 
last week that Bush advanced his proposals for conventional arms cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the search for new ideas has been Richard R. Burt, Bush's choice, still 
unconfirmed by the Senate, to lead the U.S. delegation to the START talks. 
</P>
<P>
The National Security Council plans to meet late next week to determine whether 
to pursue any or all of three possible major changes in the U.S. negotiating 
position at the START talks: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eliminating all 308 of the Soviet Union's biggest missiles, the SS-18, 
rather than half of them as the Soviets have now agreed. The United States has 
no missile of comparable size. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Banning multiple warheads on mobile, land-based missiles. The Soviets have 
10-warhead missiles on railroad cars, while the Bush Administration has asked 
Congress for authority to deploy 50 MX missiles, with 10 warheads each, on rail 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Banning multiple warheads on all land-based missiles, both mobile and 
stationary. 
</P>
<P>
The National Security Council also will consider some less drastic changes in 
the U.S. negotiating posture: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Raising the already-accepted ceiling of 1,600 missiles and bombers by 200 
or more, without raising the total number of allowable warheads. More missiles 
and bombers reduce the likelihood of a surprise attack by making an attack less 
likely to wipe out the enemy's nuclear force. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Banning the development and testing of "depressed trajectory" missiles, 
particularly submarine-launched missiles. Such weapons now take about 20 
minutes of high-arching flight to reach their targets, but if maneuvered to fly 
lower, they could arrive with far less warning time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pressure on Administration 
</P>
<P>
Bush's proposals on conventional arms reductions, including his agreement to 
negotiate equal levels of aircraft and manpower deployed by NATO and the 
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, have increased the pressure on his Administration to 
achieve reductions in nuclear arms. 
</P>
<P>
"If you create great expectations for the conventional talks, as Bush has now 
done, and let down the fires under START, as now may happen, you may just get 
nothing during this Administration's first term," said Jack Mendelsohn, deputy 
director of the private Arms Control Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials have lodged several objections to these innovations. 
</P>
<P>
Some argue that the Soviets probably will refuse to eliminate all their SS-18s, 
particularly since they are beginning to deploy the fifth version of that 
gigantic weapon. If the Administration must later withdraw this demand, one 
Administration official said, Bush may again be "tagged as a wimp, as he was 
before Brussels." 
</P>
<P>
A broader objection is that any radical change in START could bring Soviet 
charges that Bush is reneging on deals made by Reagan. Early in 1977, when 
President Jimmy Carter's new Administration proposed radical departures from 
earlier negotiations, it set back arms talks by two years. 
</P>
<P>
Those who support offering bold departures respond that if Gorbachev balks, he 
will undercut his claim to "new thinking" on nuclear weapons. He, not Bush, 
would be held responsible for any resulting stalemate, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Second, slowing the START talks would serve Bush's emphasis on the conventional 
arms talks. He has argued that nuclear arms cuts should keep pace with 
reductions in tanks, armor and manpower in Europe, but not get out ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Secretary of State James A. Baker III has said he finds little 
enthusiasm in Congress for ratifying a treaty reducing long-range nuclear 
weapons in the absence of major progress toward an agreement limiting 
conventional arms, where the Soviets now enjoy a clear advantage over the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, seeking Thursday to press the U.S. initiative in the conventional arms 
talks, called on Gorbachev to respond to Bush's proposals by making new 
unilateral cuts in short-range nuclear forces. 
</P>
<P>
"The time is ripe for Mr. Gorbachev to respond positively to the opportunities 
presented by NATO's initiatives," Baker said in a speech at the National Press 
Club. "Indeed, we look for him to do so when he travels to the Federal Republic 
of Germany next week." 
</P>
<P>
At last week's NATO summit, Baker said, "we urged the Soviets to reduce 
unilaterally their short-range nuclear systems to our levels. Next week, 
General Secretary Gorbachev can sustain this new spirit by answering our call, 
by announcing a real cut in Soviet SNF (short-range nuclear) forces."

DEATH PENALTY THAT BIRD COURT OVERTURNED IS UPHELD FOR KILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The state Supreme Court, reinstating a sentence that had been overturned under 
Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, upheld the death penalty Thursday for a man 
convicted in the 1978 killings of three USC film students. 
</P>
<P>
The court held 4 to 3 that even though a new death sentence was erroneously 
imposed at retrial under a law that did not apply, the error could not have 
affected the jury's death verdict against the defendant, David Leslie 
Murtishaw. 
</P>
<P>
Murtishaw, now 31, was convicted in a bizarre and unprovoked shooting attack on 
the students as they were making a movie for their cinema class in the desert 
near Mojave in Kern County. Killed were Ingrid Etayo, James Henderson and 
Martha Soto. A fourth student, Lance Buflo, was wounded but escaped and 
summoned authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Murtishaw's case first came to the court in 1981, when the justices upheld his 
conviction but overturned his death sentence on grounds that the jury had 
improperly heard testimony from a psychologist who predicted that the defendant 
might kill again if he were sent to prison instead of the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Outcry 
</P>
<P>
That decision caused a public outcry among critics of the court who later cited 
it in their bitter campaign against Bird and two other justices who were 
subsequently defeated in the 1986 election. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's ruling, the court majority acknowledged that Murtishaw's penalty 
retrial was mistakenly conducted under the capital punishment law the voters 
passed in November, 1978. The trial judge instead should have followed the 1977 
law enacted by the Legislature, because that was the one in effect at the time 
of the crime, the justices said. 
</P>
<P>
But the court rejected Murtishaw's claim that using the wrong law had 
improperly limited the jury's discretion in deciding whether to return a 
verdict of death or the alternative sentence of life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, retreating from a previous ruling on the issue, held that while 
the wording of the two laws differed, there was no significant functional 
difference in the discretion they gave to the jury. Hence, they said, 
Murtishaw's sentence will stand. 
</P>
<P>
"We scrutinize the penalty phase of capital trials with considerable care, but 
even plain error must be deemed harmless when there is no reasonable 
possibility it affected the penalty verdict," Justice David N. Eagleson wrote 
for the court. 
</P>
<P>
In dissent, retired Justice John A. Arguelles, participating by special 
appointment, said that Murtishaw was entitled to a penalty trial under the 
applicable law and that his sentence should be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
"Merely labeling the error as a 'technical' one, as does the majority, does not 
diminish the serious nature of the instructional mistake which occurred," 
Arguelles said in an opinion joined by Justices Stanley Mosk and Allen E. 
Broussard. 
</P>
<P>
Arguelles expressed puzzlement over how the trial judge could have allowed such 
an error to occur, but noted that "some blame must certainly be shared" by 
trial counsel for failing to alert the judge to the mistake. 
</P>
<P>
In response to an inquiry, Appellate Justice William A. Stone of Fresno, who as 
a Kern County Superior Court judge had presided in the 1983 trial, said 
Thursday that he could not recall the circumstances that led to use of 
inapplicable law. He said, however, that to his best recollection, there had 
been no objection at the time from participating attorneys to use of the 1978 
law. 
</P>
<P>
David H. Schwartz, a San Francisco attorney representing Murtishaw in his 
appeal, expressed disappointment with the ruling and said he would ask the 
justices for a rehearing. If the rehearing is refused, the decision will be 
appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas D. Sparks, Kern County chief deputy district attorney, said he was 
pleased with the decision and doubted that the high court would grant review. 
"This was one of the most egregious murder cases we've ever seen," Sparks said. 
"Mr. Murtishaw richly deserves the ultimate penalty." 
</P>
<P>
The attack on the students occurred April 9, 1978, as they were making a film 
about a stranded motorist who shoots at a hooded figure of death before 
succumbing to thirst and heat. 
</P>
<P>
According to authorities, Murtishaw and his brother-in-law had acquired two 
.22-caliber rifles and beer and then driven to the desert when their car broke 
down. They encountered the young film makers and asked for a ride to town. The 
students said they would comply when the day's work was done. 
</P>
<P>
But about 5 p.m., as the students prepared to leave, Murtishaw launched his 
murderous attack, defying his victims' pleas for mercy, authorities charged. 
The next morning, Murtishaw turned himself in to police, claiming he had fired 
in the belief the students were firing at him with the gun used in the film. 
</P>
<P>
At trial, his attorneys presented a defense of diminished mental capacity, 
arguing that Murtishaw suffered from brain damage and had acted under the 
influence of alcohol and the drug PCP. He was convicted and sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1981, the Bird court, in a 6-1 ruling, upheld the conviction but 
reversed the sentence. At the penalty retrial in 1983, the jury received 
instructions under the then-current capital punishment law that was enacted as 
an initiative in November, 1978. Again, Murtishaw was sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
In his subsequent appeal, Murtishaw argued that the 1978 law was more 
restrictive on juror discretion and thus "manifestly less favorable" to his bid 
to avoid the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The 1978 law tells jurors to compare the factors in the case that weigh against 
a defendant with the factors favoring the defendant. If the aggravating 
circumstances outweigh mitigating circumstances, the jury "shall" impose the 
death penalty, the law says. 
</P>
<P>
The 1977 law had merely required jurors to "consider, take into account and be 
guided" by the aggravating and mitigating factors as they determined the 
verdict. The court majority rejected Murtishaw's argument, finding that in 
receiving instructions under the 1978 law, the jury also had been told, as 
required by other high court decisions, that the weighing process is not a 
mechanical one and that jurors still retain the discretion to return what they 
believe is an "appropriate" verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the 1978 law was incorrectly applied, the jury was not misled about 
its discretion to grant leniency to the defendant if it wished, Eagleson said 
in a 61-page opinion joined by Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas and Justices 
Edward A. Panelli and Marcus M. Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
In their arguments to jurors, both the prosecution and defense had "made clear 
that the jury was to weigh the various sentencing factors as it chose and must 
ultimately decide for itself which penalty the defendant deserved under all the 
circumstances," Eagleson said.

STATE SENATE OKS BILL TO SHIELD DRUG MAKERS IN LIABILITY SUITS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The state Senate on Thursday narrowly passed fiercely contested legislation to 
exempt pharmaceutical manufacturers from paying punitive damages to a consumer 
injured by federally approved medication. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents argued such a shield is necessary to encourage drug makers to invest 
in the development of new, life-saving medications without the chilling threat 
of having to face "harassing" lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Because of lawsuits seeking punitive damages for injuries caused by medications 
and medical devices, argued Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benicia), there are "drugs and 
devices not being marketed today, and this is being paid for by lost lives." 
</P>
<P>
But opponents -- supported by Ralph Nader, the Consumers Union, California 
Trial Lawyers Assn. and a variety of women's groups -- mounted a heavy attack 
against the bill, declaring that the highly profitable pharmaceutical industry, 
like other manufacturers, must be responsible for the safety of its products. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Stamps Out' Punitive Relief 
</P>
<P>
Senate opponents of the bill noted that punitive damages in product liability 
cases are seldom awarded but do provide a deterrent against the marketing and 
sales of unsafe medications. Punitive damages are awarded as a punishment in 
lawsuits apart from actual damages. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill stamps out the only form of (punitive) relief that injured, maimed 
people have in this society," said Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (Ind.-San Francisco), a 
trial attorney. 
</P>
<P>
After a heated consumer vs. manufacturer floor fight, the bill went to an 
uncertain future in the Assembly on a 22-12 vote, one more than the simple 
majority required in the 40-member Senate. The votes crossed usual ideological 
lines, pitting conservative against conservative and liberal against liberal. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was sponsored by the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Assn., a generous 
source of election campaign contributions to legislators. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, the legislation would immunize drug and medical device producers 
from paying punitive damages for injuries their products cause if the products 
have won approval of the federal Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
However, drug manufacturers could be liable for punitive damages if it was 
demonstrated that they knowingly withheld or misrepresented safety information 
submitted to the FDA. In such cases, they still would be liable for 
compensatory damages as they are now, including payment for pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
Keene, the usually liberal Democratic floor leader and author of the bill, 
noted that "risks are associated with new technology" that may save hundreds of 
thousands of lives. But he insisted that payment of "excessive" punitive 
damages in product liability cases siphons away funds "and prevents the early 
marketing of products designed to save lives." 
</P>
<P>
However, liberal Sens. Nicholas C. Petris (D-Oakland) and Bill Lockyer 
(D-Hayward) warned against putting great trust in the FDA. They cited a list of 
highly publicized cases over the years in which products received FDA approval 
but were later determined to have caused deaths or serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
These included DES, the drug some women took about 30 years ago to prevent 
miscarriages; the Dalkon Shield, a women's contraceptive device; Zomax, a 
painkiller; Oraflex, an arthritis medication, and ultra-absorbent tampons. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, Petris said, the manufacturers continued marketing the products 
or "unloading" them to Third World countries even after companies notified the 
FDA of adverse reactions to the products. 
</P>
<P>
"This industry is being presented as the kindly benefactor of mankind," Petris 
boomed out. "That is not true." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Doolittle of Rocklin, the Republican caucus chairman who 
unflinchingly sides with business on virtually every issue, cast a surprising 
"no" vote on the bill, saying that he had an unspecified "personal" reason for 
doing so. 
</P>
<P>
"There (are) tremendous, enormous amounts of money in this industry," he told 
the Senate. "Sometimes, greed gets the best of people. Punitive damages act as 
a disincentive to this type of behavior."

2 INFANTS KILLED AS FIRE ENGULFS DAY-CARE SITE

Despite heroic efforts from several passers-by, two infants died and two others 
were injured in a fast-moving fire that gutted a licensed family day-care 
center Thursday morning in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I had nothing but a hose," said Dennis Drew, who frantically sprayed water at 
the home's flaming front door before firefighters arrived. "The lady was 
screaming and yelling that there were children in there, but you couldn't 
breathe, and you couldn't see, and you couldn't touch anything. . . . Even the 
firemen, when they came out, started crying after seeing those babies." 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials, who found no smoke detectors in the rubble, believe that the 
blaze may have been caused by a faulty television set. 
</P>
<P>
The dead infants were identified as Jessica Jordan, who would have been 8 
months old today, and 13-month-old John H. Reilly IV, according to fire 
officials and relatives of the children. 
</P>
<P>
Jessica's mother, Susan Jordan, burst into tears after fire officials at the 
scene reported the death. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh my God," she screamed as crisis intervention workers escorted her to a van. 
</P>
<P>
John H. Reilly III, father of the 13-month-old, stared in disbelief at the 
charred home at 5122 Audrey Drive when he arrived there Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
"He was our only child," said Reilly, his eyes filling with tears. "I can't 
believe it happened. How can something like this happen so quickly"? 
</P>
<P>
Of the other two children at the home, Devon Strayer, 3, of Huntington Beach 
was treated at Humana Hospital and released, while Nick Duncan, 6 months, 
remained hospitalized at UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange with second- and 
third-degree burns, said Martha Werth, a public information officer for the 
Huntington Beach Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
The day-care provider, Pat Orozco, 49, was hospitalized in fair condition with 
smoke inhalation and second-degree burns on her arms and shoulders. Also 
hospitalized for smoke inhalation were Huntington Beach Firefighter Chris 
Gruber and Bill Applebee, a Huntington Beach Water Department employee who 
tried to rescue the children from the burning house. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Huntley, an investigator with the Huntington Beach Fire Department's Fire 
Prevention Bureau, said firefighters found no evidence of smoke alarms in the 
house, although there may have been a fire extinguisher in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Under state day-care licensing requirements, providers who baby-sit up to six 
children have the option of equipping their homes with either smoke detectors 
or fire extinguishers, said Dianne M. Edwards, director of adult and employment 
services for the Orange County Social Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
However, the state Building Code requires family day-care providers to have 
both fire extinguishers and smoke detectors, said Steve Viero, supervisor of 
field operations for the state fire marshal. Viero could not explain why the 
two codes differ or whose responsibility it is to enforce the smoke detector 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview from her bed at Long Beach Memorial Hospital, Orozco said she 
was coming out of the kitchen and entering the living room when she turned 
around and saw the fire. Orozco said she grabbed two children and took them 
outside but was unable to get back into the house to retrieve the other two. 
</P>
<P>
"The flames were overwhelming," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she knew how the fire started or where the flames came from, Orozco 
just weakly shook her head. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all kind of blank right now," she said. "I did my best." 
</P>
<P>
Volunteer therapists coordinated by the American Red Cross spent about 15 
minutes with Susan and Donald Jordan, Jessica's parents, before the couple 
emerged from a white van to look at the Orozco house. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they just need to be held and have a shoulder to cry on," said Linda 
M. Johnson, a licensed family therapist from Huntington Beach who helped 
console the distraught mother. "Once the shock ends, then the grief begins. 
This is the beginning for them, not the end."

NEW DISCOVERIES OF SLAIN HORSES SPUR INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
New discoveries of wild horses and deer slain in a rural section of Nevada near 
Great Basin National Park, allegedly by the employees of ranchers seeking to 
protect their grazing land, have spurred a fresh federal-state investigation. 
</P>
<P>
A federal grand jury in Las Vegas has issued subpoenas for six White Pine 
County residents, and two rifles suspected of being used in the killings have 
been confiscated, as a result of the inquiry by at least four agencies, 
according to law enforcement officials in the eastern Nevada town of Ely. 
</P>
<P>
Although an informant reported that as many as 400 horses and 200 deer had been 
killed, only 28 carcasses of slain horses and 20 of mule deer have been 
recovered, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slow Deaths 
</P>
<P>
"They shot them in the stomach, so these animals would wander," Undersheriff 
Harry Collins said Thursday. He explained that the animals take hours to die 
and that accordingly their carcasses are widely scattered and the numbers of 
killings are difficult to confirm. 
</P>
<P>
The new killings occurred about 200 miles east of where another mass killing of 
at least 580 wild horses took place last year in Lander County in the central 
part of the state. Five people have been indicted for those killings and will 
go on trial this month and next in Reno on "gross misdemeanor" charges calling 
for up to $2,000 in fines and a year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
The latest incident comes when litigation by the Sacramento-based Animal 
Protection Institute has blocked the planned captures of 3,000 Nevada wild 
horses by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which has an extensive horse 
adoption program in which the animals are sent to other states. 
</P>
<P>
The halt in the captures, imposed almost a year ago, has reportedly intensified 
feelings among ranchers that a growing wild animal population is despoiling 
rangeland used by more than 500,000 cattle and sheep that are permitted to 
graze on the 87% of Nevada's mostly barren land under federal control. 
</P>
<P>
A Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman Thursday estimated the number of wild 
horses in the state at about 26,000. The horses have been legally protected 
under federal law since 1971. They are descendants of a 19th-Century wild horse 
population estimated as high as 2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Statements about the latest killings varied in tone between local and federal 
officials, with the local officials taking a more dire view. 
</P>
<P>
Local officials said the joint investigation is well along and has established 
that the animals were shot. They suggested that indictments will come soon. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman, Maxine Shane, characterized the 
investigation as only preliminary and said the causes of death have not been 
firmly established. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hillman, director of field services for the Animal Protection Institute, 
charged in an interview that "the BLM has a hard time following the 1971 law 
because it's always been a cattlemen, stockmen agency. The sheriff and district 
attorney, by contrast, find these killings abhorrent and they don't owe their 
allegiance to the ranchers." 
</P>
<P>
White Pine Dist. Atty. Dan Papez, however, cautioned that sheer maliciousness 
rather than economic interest could account for some of the killings. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, these days we have widespread hooliganism and vandalism," Papez 
said. "But there also could be a commercial concern. There's been a 
longstanding disagreement on how the BLM manages the wild horses. They do a lot 
of damage to the range when their numbers are not controlled. Nonetheless, the 
law is the law and it's unlawful to shoot them." 
</P>
<P>
Papez said the deer do less damage and with them he is convinced that the 
slayings were "just maliciousness." 
</P>
<P>
White Pine Sheriff Bernie Romemo said a search warrant was obtained May 31, 
leading to the seizure of the two rifles. "We're looking at figures of 400 
horses and 200 deer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shane of the Bureau of Land Management, by contrast, said that only 28 horse 
carcasses had been recovered and did not mention the deer. She said more 
carcasses may be recovered when snow melts in the mountains.

REVIEWS MIXED ON NICARAGUA'S VOTE OVERSEERS 
</P>

MANAGUA, Nicaragua 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two members of the ruling Sandinista Front, two opposition activists and a 
self-described "conservative without a party" have been named by the 
Sandinistas to oversee Nicaragua's elections next February, a lineup that got 
mixed reviews from the opposition Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-Sandinista leaders criticized the method of choosing the five-man Supreme 
Electoral Council and objected to the reelection of Mariano Fiallos Oyanguren, 
a Sandinista, as its president. But they said they were hopeful that the 
supposedly neutral member, Rodolfo Sandino Arguello, would tip the balance in 
their favor in any electoral dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Sandino Arguello, 60, served eight years on the Supreme Court under President 
Anastasio Somoza and was president of that tribunal when the Sandinistas fought 
their way to power 10 years ago and dissolved it. Now dean of the law school at 
the Jesuit-run Central American University in Managua, he says he dropped out 
of Conservative Party politics "12 or 15 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not the Best' 
</P>
<P>
Guillermo Selva Arguello, an agronomist active in the Independent Liberal 
Party, and Aman Sandino Munoz, a cardiologist and Conservative Party member, 
were named to represent the opposition on the council. The two Sandinista 
members, Fiallos and Leonel Arguello Ramirez, are lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the best possible council, but it is minimally acceptable," said 
Luis Humberto Guzman, an opposition member of the Sandinista-controlled 
National Assembly after it chose the panel Wednesday night from nominees 
submitted by President Daniel Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
The council will have broad powers to enforce the law governing the Feb. 25 
elections of a president, a vice president, a new assembly and municipal 
governing boards. It will name three-member councils to oversee voting in each 
of Nicaragua's nine regions, allocate public funds and television time to 
parties in the race, organize voter registration, supervise an electoral police 
force and certify the official vote count. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demand for Changes 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders said they will also ask the council to accept their demand 
for election rules changes, such as allowing Nicaraguan exiles to cast ballots 
abroad and barring Sandinista soldiers from voting at army facilities. Whether 
the council has such power is a matter of dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The previous council was made up of three Sandinistas and two opposition party 
members. It was discredited in the eyes of the opposition for failing to 
control alleged voting irregularities in 1984, when the Sandinistas got 
two-thirds of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
By law, the assembly could have preserved the 3-2 Sandinista majority on the 
council. But Ortega agreed last February, as part of a Central American plan to 
end the Contra war, to give the opposition "equitable representation." He did 
so by asking the assembly to chose the fifth member from his list of "notable" 
Nicaraguans of no party affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders asserted that Ortega had also promised Venezuelan officials 
who are monitoring the Nicaraguan election that the "notable" member would be 
chosen by consensus of the government and opposition and that both opposition 
council members would be from the main anti-Sandinista bloc of 14 parties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Broken Promise? 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the president sent his own list without formally consulting the 
opposition. It reserved one council seat, that given to Sandino Munoz, for a 
Conservative faction that is at least as hostile to the anti-Sandinista bloc as 
it is to the government. 
</P>
<P>
"Ortega didn't comply with his promise," said Virgilio Godoy, the Independent 
Liberal leader. "He sent his lists and put the assembly in a straitjacket." 
</P>
<P>
Sandinista assemblymen countered that 10 of the 12 names submitted to Ortega by 
the coalition, known as the National Opposition Union, were among the 46 people 
he nominated. 
</P>
<P>
Godoy called Sandino Arguello "the least of three evils" nominated by Ortega as 
the nonpartisan council member. But most other opposition leaders said they 
respected the former judge and expressed confidence in his impartiality. 
</P>
<P>
Silviano Matamoros, a Conservative leader in the opposition union, said the 
re-election of Fiallos, who headed the council during the 1984 campaign, was a 
setback. Ortega had asked the assembly to consider the law professor's 
"honesty, capacity and experience" in making its choice. 
</P>
<P>
"The election campaign is starting badly," Matamoros said. "The make-up of the 
council was an opportunity for the government to lay a basis of confidence in 
the elections, but it lost that opportunity."

DEFEAT FOR GORBACHEV: LITHUANIAN CONGRESS DEPUTIES WALK OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev suffered his first defeat in the Soviet Union's 
new legislature Thursday when most of the deputies from the Baltic republic of 
Lithuania walked out to protest what they saw as his attempt to establish a new 
constitutional court whose rulings are likely to run counter to Lithuanian 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, nonplussed by the dramatic protest, which was broadcast live on 
national television and radio, quickly adjourned the session of the Congress of 
People's Deputies in the midst of a vote on the committee's membership. He said 
a compromise would be sought overnight with the Lithuanians. 
</P>
<P>
Although there had been previous challenges to his authority during the 
two-week parliamentary session, Gorbachev had always managed to prevail -- 
until Prof. Kazimira-Danute Prunskiene, a respected economist and leading 
member of the Lithuanian reform movement Sajudis, gathered her bags and 
briefcases, got up and led a procession of more than 50 Lithuanian deputies up 
the long aisle out of the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses. 
</P>
<P>
Even after two weeks of tumultuous debate, itself a breakthrough after decades 
of cultivated political me-tooism, this was high drama: public defiance of the 
country's top leader on a major issue of national importance. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Gorbachev had assumed, as had most of the nation, that he would 
prevail on any crucial issue simply through the force of his personality and 
his ability to define and dominate any issue. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev appeared stunned, watching in disbelief as most of the Lithuanian 
delegation followed Prunskiene. A few deputies from the neighboring Baltic 
republics of Estonia and Latvia joined them. 
</P>
<P>
As other deputies began to shout angrily at the Lithuanians, Gorbachev said, 
"Comrades, comrades, please be quiet. This is a very serious moment, a critical 
moment. We will have to discuss what to do now." 
</P>
<P>
The two basic issues that sparked the protest had arisen several times in the 
past two weeks: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Many deputies objected to the way in which the proposed Constitutional 
Review Commission, a form of constitutional court, had been formed and its 
members nominated. 
</P>
<P>
"Once again, we are faced with a familiar situation -- one name for one job and 
no options," Deputy Alexander Obolensky, who challenged Gorbachev for the 
presidency simply as a matter of principle, told the congress. "The compilers 
of this list are anonymous, we received the list a couple of hours before we 
were to vote, there were the briefest of biographies and nothing, absolutely 
nothing, on where the proposed members stood on major issues. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no right to proceed; in fact, it would be criminal to consider any of 
these appointments until everything has been clarified." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lithuanian deputies, as well as representatives from the other Baltic 
republics and the Ukraine, objected, even more strongly, to the formation of 
the commission while the Soviet constitution, now a relic of the politically 
discredited era of President Leonid I. Brezhnev, is still in force. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a new constitution, one that takes into account the legitimate 
interests of all republics," a Lithuanian deputy said on behalf of the three 
Baltic delegations. "We do not need a commission to enforce the old 
constitution." 
</P>
<P>
Other questions were raised, including the past political standards of the 
candidates as well as their ages, well over 60 for most, although they were 
supposed to serve 10-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
"It is all right," Gorbachev said soothingly as more questions were raised. "We 
have thought about this." 
</P>
<P>
A Latvian deputy then argued that the whole constitutional process should 
begin, much as the American constitution did more than 200 years ago, with the 
separate republic's constitutions reflecting particular beliefs and interests 
and leading in time to a new national constitution and later to a court that 
would enforce its provisions. 
</P>
<P>
As deputies shouted "Autumn, autumn!" and urged postponement of the whole 
question until the congress meets again in October, Gorbachev grew very serious 
and calmed the congress for several minutes with a frank speech. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a dark and growing suspicion that people are trying to derail the work 
of this congress," he said. "We are being pulled into fruitless discussions and 
endless debates, but by whom and for what?" 
</P>
<P>
According to Soviet officials, there were 433 votes against the basic proposal 
to confirm those whom the leadership had nominated and 61 abstentions -- but 
many more, perhaps half, of the 2,250 deputies chose not to participate in the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
After the issue was put off until today, Gorbachev called for a surprise, 
closed-door session, the first of the congress, clearing the hall of press, 
government officials and other observers and ending the live broadcasts. 
Deputies later said that the congress had discussed this week's ethnic riots in 
the Soviet Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan. 
</P>
<P>
This adjournment came as tellers were counting the votes for the appointment 
for chief state prosecutor. After much controversy, involving a dozen different 
court cases, Alexander Sukharev, 66, was confirmed in the post. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Nikolai Shmelyev, a leading economist, had told the 
congress that the country was headed for an economic crash within three years 
unless urgent measures are taken to cut the government's budget deficit and 
reverse other policies. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the next two or three years, if we do not stop inflation, the decay of 
the consumer market and the monstrous budget deficit, then we face economic 
collapse," Shmelyev said. 
</P>
<P>
In a full-scale plan for the nation's economic and fiscal recovery, Shmelyev 
proposed a program of $23 billion in imports of consumer goods this year and 
next followed by $9 billion a year for several years to satisfy consumer demand 
and absorb the "hot money" in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
He supported proposals to pay Soviet farmers in "dollars," or some form of hard 
currency, for producing more grain, meat or vegetables than required by state 
plan -- and thus saving on imports of agricultural produce. 
</P>
<P>
Shmelyev then ticked off a dozen even more controversial proposals, all 
designed to save money and put the economy on a steady footing: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reduced assistance to Cuba, which now receives the equivalent of $6 billion 
a year through inflated Soviet payments for its sugar exports. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The sale of agricultural land to private farmers, who would not only pay 
for the title but then invest considerable money developing the land. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Issuance of bonds, at attractive interest rates, to finance capital 
investment in major state enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An end, for at least a decade, to major state development projects, such as 
the second Trans-Siberian Railway, which is nearing completion after nearly 20 
years of investment. 
</P>
<P>
Shmelyev called for the Congress to be given accurate figures on the country's 
finances -- Soviet economists were working largely from figures compiled by 
Western intelligence agencies -- and an end to the unquestioning printing of 
money whenever the government needs funds to balance its spending.

CLASHES BETWEEN RIVAL MUSLIM SECTS SPREAD IN UZBEKISTAN; 6 KILLED, 90 WOUNDED

<P>
At least six people were killed and 90 wounded Wednesday as ethnic clashes 
involving rival Muslim sects spread to another city in the Soviet Central Asian 
republic of Uzbekistan, the official Tass news agency said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people stormed the police department in the city of Kokand in 
search of firearms, while as many as 600 people attacked a building belonging 
to the Interior Ministry's transport department, Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported earlier Thursday that 71 were 
killed in clashes between ethnic groups in Uzbekistan. The violence between the 
Meskhetians and the Uzbeks began last weekend around Fergana, about 60 miles 
east of Kojand. 
</P>
<P>
The Novosti news agency said religious and ethnic differences were to blame for 
the trouble in Uzbekistan. 
</P>
<P>
The Meskhetians -- Georgians who converted to Islam when their land came under 
Turkish influence between the 16th and 19th centuries -- are Shiite Muslims. 
They were deported to Uzbekistan from Georgia by dictator Josef Stalin in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
The Uzbeks, who are of Turkish descent, are members of Islam's Sunni sect. 
</P>
<P>
"According to preliminary estimates, six people were killed and more than 90 
wounded in the unrest on Wednesday," Tass reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Sixty-one people were hospitalized. Among the casualties are militiamen, 
soldiers and cadets." 
</P>
<P>
Tass said 65 houses, six administration offices and more than 20 vehicles were 
burned by the Kokand rioters. It said many of the rioters were under the 
influence of drugs or alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Kokand remains tense," Tass said. "More houses are burning." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet television said 600 people were injured in Kokand in what appeared to be 
the worst known single outbreak of ethnic violence in recent Soviet history.

A State Department official phoned Lewis H. Jordan, executive vice president of 
Continental Airlines, late Tuesday to see if the Houston-based carrier could 
send an airliner to Beijing within 24 hours to evacuate Americans from the 
strife-torn city. 
</P>
<P>
But the situation in the Chinese capital quickly grew worse, and the official 
called back to ask if the Continental flight could go immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Continental, which does not normally fly to Beijing, agreed, considering the 
mission a patriotic duty. "The U.S. government sought our help to move citizens 
whose lives might be endangered," said Jordan, who is also the airline's chief 
operating officer. "When the State Department says that citizens have to be 
moved, we feel an obligation to participate." 
</P>
<P>
What followed during the next two days was a tale of some drama and many 
aggravations. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble started quickly. When the Continental DC-10, which took off from its 
base in Guam, neared Shanghai, Chinese aviation authorities told the pilot that 
he could go no farther toward Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Circled, Flew to Okinawa 
</P>
<P>
The plane circled for an hour, then flew to Okinawa. Only middle-of-the-night 
emergency communications among Washington, Beijing, Shanghai and Continental 
resolved the issue, and the plane took off again. It finally landed in the 
Chinese capital Thursday, having spent five hours in the air more than if it 
had made a direct Guam-Beijing flight. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department spokesman in Washington said in an interview Thursday that 
the turnaround at Shanghai was apparently a misunderstanding that arose because 
the Continental plane arrived earlier than the Chinese had expected it. 
</P>
<P>
The DC-10 was scheduled to be on the ground in Beijing for only an hour and a 
half. But despite reports that Americans were clamoring to get out of China, 
Jordan said, there were not nearly enough prospective passengers to fill the 
plane, which has room for 284 people. At last report, the DC-10 was still 
parked at the Beijing airport. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the unexpected delay, the Continental crew had to check into a 
Beijing hotel to wait it out and get some rest. 
</P>
<P>
As a precaution, Continental took one of its own mechanics along to handle any 
troubles that might arise. And the airline made sure that the jet had enough 
fuel to make it unnecessary to take on any in China. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no way to know whether their fueling facilities were operational, 
whether they had fuel or whether their fuel was contaminated," Jordan said. "I 
had to assume the worst would happen." The plane left Okinawa with 138,300 
pounds of jet fuel and still had 91,000 pounds when it arrived in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the mechanic, the plane carried other extra Continental personnel who 
do not usually travel. There was a load planner, who specializes in weight and 
balance calculations. He will measure exactly the total weight of baggage to be 
allowed on the plane and will decide how many people can travel and where they 
will sit. 
</P>
<P>
A passenger service representative also was part of the crew to help the 
evacuees make connections later. Besides the three-member cockpit crew and 13 
flight attendants, the plane also carried Continental's chief pilot in Guam in 
case management decisions had to be made on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
There were other complications. For example, Continental and the State 
Department had to see that visa requirements to enter China were waived for the 
DC-10's crew, and a waiver had to be sought of the rigid 11 p.m. curfew 
requirements at Narita International Airport near Tokyo, which will be the 
plane's first stop after leaving Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Because Continental is not a regular visitor to Beijing, the plane had no 
flight chart or map of the airport there. Such maps inform flight crews of such 
facts as the length of the runways, whether there are any unusual obstacles at 
the airport and the radio frequency of the air traffic control center. 
</P>
<P>
United Airlines, which makes three regular flights a week to Beijing with 
Boeing 747s, also operated two charter flights for the State Department this 
week, each of which spent just one hour on the ground in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Since the crisis began, Chicago-based United has been conducting frequent 
meetings of a China task force composed of key executives. In addition, it has 
been requiring its China office to check in by phone every four hours. 
</P>
<P>
United said that its loads, too, have been light. On Wednesday, a 400-passenger 
plane left Beijing with 277 people aboard and picked up another 43 in Shanghai. 
Thursday's charter, which did not stop in Shanghai, carried only 65 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department spokesman said there was no way of knowing how many 
Americans need to be evacuated from China. "We are trying to contact all 
Americans," he said. "There is no way to predict how many there will be." 
</P>
<P>
United feels that the small loads on the charters are the result of a habit not 
so unusual for Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a chaotic situation," says Robert A. Doughty, a United spokesman. "There 
are other (non-American) airlines that people can fly out of China. They 
double-book and triple-book. They put their names down on the waiting list of 
every airline at the airport. Then they fly out on the first one they can get 
out on." 
</P>
<P>
Northwest Airlines, based in Eagan, Minn., and United are the only U.S. 
carriers that operate regular flights to China. Northwest's flights go to 
Shanghai.

The State Department confirmed the presence of a prominent Chinese dissident in 
the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, evidently against the wishes of U.S. Ambassador 
James R. Lilley, CBS News reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Lilley, interviewed in Beijing by CBS, refused to comment on whether Fang 
Lizhi, an astrophysicist who has been dubbed the "Andrei Sakharov of China," is 
staying at the Embassy. Fang, 53, was expelled from the Communist Party in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Lilley became visibly angry when asked about State Department reports that Fang 
had taken refuge at the embassy to avoid falling victim to the Communist 
government's crackdown on the pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the State Department's business," Lilley snapped. "If they have all the 
answers, ask them." 
</P>
<P>
His comments came shortly after the Chinese government filed a strong protest 
with Lilley for granting refuge to Fang, who has been accused in official media 
reports of masterminding the democracy movement.

PAPER TO TELL CHINESE 'WHAT REALLY HAPPENED';

JOURNALISTS TRY TO SEND THE NEWS HOME

Concerned that the Chinese people are not getting the truth, about a dozen 
former Chinese journalists now living in the Los Angeles area have begun 
publishing a newspaper that they hope to send back to their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Working from an apartment in Alhambra, they plan to print about 6,000 copies of 
the Press Freedom Herald this morning and mail copies to friends and relatives 
in China, asking others to carry it in by hand. 
</P>
<P>
The journalists, some of whom have worked for Chinese newspapers that were 
banned or censored by the government, are living in the United States as 
students. Many had planned to return, but changed their minds after the recent 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Colleagues Demonstrated 
</P>
<P>
"All my colleagues marched in Beijing," said Bi Qi, a San Gabriel resident and 
former reporter for the Beijing Evening News. "They don't have freedom of the 
press there. Here we have freedom of the press." 
</P>
<P>
Although news of the political turmoil in Beijing has dominated news reports 
worldwide for nearly two months, official reports in China have been inaccurate 
and sketchy, especially for those living outside metropolitan areas, said Cao 
Changqing, editor of the Herald. 
</P>
<P>
Bi said a friend who arrived in Los Angeles last Saturday from Shandong, a 
province about 200 miles southeast of Beijing, said the government has 
described the protesters as "troublemakers." The friend's only non-government 
source of information was the Voice of America, but Chinese authorities have 
been jamming the broadcasts, Bi said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite media reports that hundreds, perhaps thousands, were killed in the 
military crackdown at Tian An Men Square, the official Chinese news reports 
have insisted that the death toll is only 300, and only 23 of them students. 
</P>
<P>
"This is clearly a lie," Cao said. "We want to let the Chinese people know what 
really happened at the Tian An Men Square massacre." 
</P>
<P>
The paper's volunteers worked past 3 a.m. Wednesday night in the Alhambra 
apartment, writing and editing articles for the first issue. The editors 
crammed news summaries from Chinese- and English-language newspapers onto one 
single broadsheet-sized sheet to facilitate mailing and transport. 
</P>
<P>
The paper included a list of the confirmed dead -- complete with names and ages 
-- and photographs of some of the victims' bodies. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't have pictures, people may not believe it," said Paul Chen, a 
former reporter for China's World Economic Journal. Herald staff members also 
were careful about adopting terms used by the various Chinese-language 
newspapers that they quoted. 
</P>
<P>
A Taiwan-based newspaper, for example, referred to the Chinese army as the 
"Communist Army," which Herald editors changed to the "People's Liberation 
Army." Otherwise, they said, readers in China would dismiss the Herald as 
Taiwanese propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Supported by Area Chinese 
</P>
<P>
Support for the Herald has come from Los Angeles area's Chinese community, said 
Cao, the editor. In one day the association raised $3,000. One supporter 
donated and hand-delivered a fax machine, which Herald staff members have been 
using to distribute news releases and gather information from other sources. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles offices of Chinese-language newspapers based in Taiwan and Hong 
Kong have also been generous with their help, Cao said. Sing Tao Daily, a Hong 
Kong-based newspaper, has offered the Herald free use of its presses and is 
charging only typesetting costs. 
</P>
<P>
Work on a second issue of the Herald has already started, and the staff plans 
to publish as often as finances will permit, Cao said.

Security police detained about 120 people as they left a Protestant church 
after protesting the results of East Germany's local elections, church 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Uniformed and plainclothes officers dragged the civil rights activists to three 
waiting buses and drove them away Wednesday night, the church aides and 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Police told church leaders those detained will be freed once their names have 
been taken but it was not immediately clear whether this had happened. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 civil rights activists attended the protest meeting in East Berlin's 
Sophia Church, where they alleged there had been widespread fraud during last 
month's elections. 
</P>
<P>
According to official results, only 1.15% of the electorate voted against 
Communist Party-approved candidates in the May 7 elections. Activists say the 
figure was much higher.

SOVIET MIG-29 CRASHES AT PARIS AIR SHOW 
</P>

<P>
As several thousand aviation specialists looked on, an advanced Soviet MIG-29 
combat aircraft crashed in flames on a grassy apron of Le Bourget Airport 
during the opening Thursday of the Paris Air Show. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet pilot, who had thrilled the crowd with a complicated series of 
high-performance maneuvers just before the crash, managed to eject only seconds 
before the plane slammed nose-first into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Although videotapes of the crash showed that his parachute had only partially 
opened, Soviet officials said pilot Anatoly Kvotchur, 37, was in "more or less 
satisfactory condition." 
</P>
<P>
No immediate cause was given for the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Air show spokesman Patrick Guerin said the plane seemed to have "a mechanical 
problem with the left engine." He said the afterburner of the left engine 
failed to fire during a low-speed turn at about 1,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
38th Air Show 
</P>
<P>
The crash was a spectacular start for the 38th Paris Air Show, a huge biennial 
event attended this year by more than 140,000 aviation industry representatives 
from 34 countries. 
</P>
<P>
The MIG-29, first shown in the West last September at the Farnborough Air Show 
in England, was one of the star attractions offered by the largest Soviet 
delegations ever to attend the air show. The Soviet air force has about 450 of 
the combat aircraft in service, and it has been sold to East Germany, North 
Korea, India, Syria, Yugoslavia and Poland, according to the respected 
reference book "Jane's All the World's Aircraft" and other sources. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials were miffed last month when Turkish authorities returned a 
MIG-29 flown to Turkey by a defecting pilot without letting them have a chance 
to examine the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The accident Thursday occurred just as Soviet officials were holding a press 
conference in the cavernous cargo hold of an Antonov 225, the world's largest 
aircraft. The Antonov carried on its back the Soviet space shuttle Buran. Both 
aircraft were making their first appearance in the West. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prime Trade Fair 
</P>
<P>
The Paris show alternates with Farnborough as the industry's prime trade fair 
at which buyers can compare weaponry and shop for new airplanes. About 350,000 
visitors are expected to attend this year's show, jamming hotels and filling 
restaurants with aviation engineers, aircraft salesmen and military officers. 
</P>
<P>
The main American attraction this year is the Lockheed SR-71 "Blackbird" 
reconnaissance airplane, making its first public appearance outside the United 
States. The Mach-3 aircraft, first delivered to the U.S. Air Force in 1966, has 
rarely been photographed. This year, however, the veil has been lifted and the 
svelte, dark-green, spy plane stood naked to cameras on the tarmac of Le 
Bourget. 
</P>
<P>
Because the show occurs this year on the 20th anniversary of the first American 
moon landing, several former astronauts, including Neil Armstrong, the first 
person to set foot on the moon, are present and met with French President 
Francois Mitterrand during the opening ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
The Paris Air Show has been the scene for a number of serious accidents over 
the years, including the 1973 crash of a supersonic Soviet Tupolev 144 that 
killed 13 people. American B-58 "Hustler" bombers crashed here in 1961 and 
again in 1965, each time killing the three-man crew. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, an American Fairchild Hiller 1000 helicopter exploded and crashed, 
killing the pilot. In 1977, a twin-engine Fairchild A-10 crashed after 
performing a low-altitude acrobatic loop, also killing the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
One of the worst air show accidents, however, happened last Aug. 28, at 
Ramstein Air Base in West Germany. Seventy people died after three jets of an 
Italian Air Force aerobatics team collided and one jet plowed into spectators.

CHENEY URGES NATO TO BOOST DEFENSE SPENDING 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A week after President Bush held out the prospect of defusing Soviet power in 
Eastern Europe by negotiation, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney exhorted NATO 
defense ministers Thursday to increase their military spending. 
</P>
<P>
In a successful bid to maintain the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's 
so-called "3% commitment," Cheney argued that an allied pledge to boost defense 
budgets would keep pressure on the Soviets in negotiations, as well as on the 
U.S. Congress and the European public. 
</P>
<P>
As the alliance's 16 defense ministers met to discuss common military concerns, 
several budget-wary allies had proposed that it scrap the spending goal, which 
for four years has existed only on paper. 
</P>
<P>
In a biannual ritual that has lasted more than a decade, the NATO allies have 
vowed to increase their defense budgets by 3% a year, excluding the effects of 
inflation. No country has consistently achieved that goal. 
</P>
<P>
As of this year, even the U.S. defense budget has shrunk in real terms for four 
years running. Cheney's own proposed budget for next year would shrink by 1%. 
</P>
<P>
That has led even some of the Pentagon's senior officers to suggest that the 3% 
commitment has lost its credibility and that it should be replaced with more 
realistic goals. 
</P>
<P>
But senior officials said that in the wake of last week's NATO summit, the 
allies agreed that the spending commitment should not be scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
"It sends the wrong signal . . . . If anything, we ought to be doing more," 
said a senior defense official. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the United States brought its allies welcome relief from 
another onerous burden. Gen. John R. Galvin, supreme allied commander of 
European forces, outlined a plan to scale back the size and scope of future 
European military exercises. 
</P>
<P>
The exercises have become a sensitive political issue throughout Western 
Europe, where the maneuvers of U.S. and allied forces regularly wreak havoc 
with civilian life and property. 
</P>
<P>
Galvin's plan, which officials said was "greeted with considerable enthusiasm" 
by European allies, would increase the use of computer simulation and of 
small-scale exercises in which commanders only engage in mock battles. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, NATO scaled back Reforger, the largest of its annual 
maneuvers in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cheney began what he called "the spade work" of intra-alliance 
negotiations, aimed at drafting a conventional arms control accord that would 
scale back the East-West military face-off in Europe within a year. 
</P>
<P>
But he warned it is "far too early for us to talk about how to divide up cuts" 
suggested by President Bush's proposal to reduce forces on both the U.S. and 
Soviet sides to 275,000 troops, with accompanying trims in tanks, artillery and 
other conventional weapons, as well as a 15% cut in combat aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for NATO . . . to make certain we don't start suddenly focusing 
on ways to make our reductions, rather than maintain our vigilance," Cheney 
said.

PAINT FIRMS SUED OVER LEAD POISONING 
</P>

<P>
The city of New York, seeking to make paint manufacturers pay all costs of 
removing lead paint from city-owned buildings, Thursday charged in a civil suit 
that five leading makers and their trade association deliberately covered up 
damaging medical evidence about lead poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
New York's lawyers said it was the first such case in the country and was 
expected to spark similar lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
The city asks for recovery of more than $50 million various city agencies have 
spent over the years in efforts to reduce the risks posed by lead paint, 
particularly to children. The city is demanding reimbursement for inspecting, 
testing, paint removal, treating lead poisoning victims and other costs. 
</P>
<P>
More than 6,500 incidents of lead poisoning in children have been reported in 
New York from 1983 to 1988. Lead poisoning can cause learning disabilities, 
mental retardation, behavioral disorders, permanent brain damage and even 
death. The greatest danger to youngsters comes from eating peeling or flaking 
lead paint chips. 
</P>
<P>
"At least as early as the mid-19th Century, the hazards of lead paint, 
including the hazards of lead paint to children, were well known to the medical 
and scientific communities, as well as to lead producers and painters," the 
suit charged. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Notwithstanding defendants' extensive knowledge of the hazards of lead 
paint, particularly the hazards to children, and defendants' opposition to the 
use of lead paint on toys and children's furniture, defendants continued from 
the 1920s until at least the mid-1950s to advertise and/or promote lead paint 
as appropriate for uses which might foreseeably result in the exposure of young 
children to lead through inhalation, ingestion or absorption." 
</P>

Use of Lead Paint Banned 
</P>
<P>
Since 1960, New York has prohibited the use of lead paint in homes and 
apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"For many years, these defendants or their predecessors hid the dangers of lead 
paint," charged Peter L. Zimroth, New York's corporation counsel. "They have 
caused great pain to thousands of victims." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Edward I. Koch said, "If we have the right to demand that Exxon pay the 
price for cleaning up the environmental disaster it caused in Prince William 
Sound, we also have the right to demand that the lead pigment industry clean up 
the environmental catastrophe they have caused in buildings throughout our city 
and other urban areas." 
</P>
<P>
Named as defendants in the suit filed in New York state Supreme Court were NL 
Industries, Inc. of New Jersey, Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. of Ohio, Atlantic 
Richfield Co. of Delaware, Sherwin-Williams Co. of Ohio and the Glidden Co. of 
Delaware and its successor SCM Corp. Also named was the Lead Industries Assn., 
the industry's New York-based trade association. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach the trade association late Thursday for comment were 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
The city is being assisted in its suit by Trial Lawyers for Public Justice, a 
Washington-based public interest law firm, and Thornton &amp; Early, a Boston 
law firm. Trial Lawyers for Public Justice and the Boston firm have filed 
lawsuits against the same defendants on behalf of children who allegedly 
suffered lead poisoning.

ILLEGAL ENTRIES FROM MEXICO HELD UNABATED 
</P>

<P>
The landmark overhaul of the U.S. immigration law enacted in 1986 has thus far 
failed to substantially reduce the huge numbers of Mexican nationals entering 
the United States illegally, an academic study here has found. 
</P>
<P>
The conclusions, reached by researchers for the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies 
at UC San Diego, contradict statements by U.S. immigration authorities and 
congressional representatives who assert that the law is working as designed. 
</P>
<P>
The academicians, who conducted a two-year study of the effects of the 1986 
law, reported that Mexican migrants are continuing to flow northward, with or 
without documentation, and that 41% of those who had jobs and were interviewed 
had resorted to using false or borrowed immigration documents in order to 
secure work, thus circumventing the law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Work Available, Study Says 
</P>
<P>
Despite new legal sanctions against employers who hire illegal aliens, the 
study found that most migrants continue to find work in the United States and 
that few were returning to Mexico, which is believed to account for more than 
90% of the illegal immigrants entering the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne A. Cornelius, director of the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies and head of 
the study, said: "No viable alternative to migrating to the United States has 
developed in these communities, so they're continuing to send people." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Cornelius, an expert on Mexico and immigration, said migrants were 
increasingly arriving from areas of Mexico relatively new to the migrant 
stream, such as Mexico City and the states of Mexico, Guerrero and Oaxaca. The 
development is an ominous one for U.S. policy-makers seeking to deter illegal 
immigration, Cornelius said, as it indicates that new migrant networks are 
being created. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, the most comprehensive revision of 
the nation's immigration laws in more than three decades, was designed largely 
to reduce the flow of undocumented immigrants, mostly Mexicans, into the United 
States via the U.S.-Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Link to Economy 
</P>
<P>
Cornelius and others have argued that the law likely would be ineffective as 
long as Mexico's economy continued to deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
INS and congressional officials disputed the results of the study, asserting 
that the law was indeed deterring illegal immigration. Among other things, 
authorities noted that arrests of illegal aliens along the U.S.-Mexican border 
-- long considered the best single indicator of undocumented immigration -- had 
declined precipitously since passage of the new immigration law. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. authorities have attributed the decline in arrests at the border in part 
to the deterrent effect of the "employer sanction" sections of the new law. 
Those provisions require that all employers check prospective workers' 
documentation to determine that they are authorized to work in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in arrests at the border, Cornelius said, is more likely linked to 
the fact that more than 3 million one-time illegal residents have been granted 
legal status via the amnesty program, and are now able to cross the border 
legally.

BUSH INDICATES TOUGH APPROACH ON NEW CLEAN-AIR REGULATIONS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush indicated Thursday that he plans a hard-line approach on new 
clean-air standards that will "significantly improve" the quality of life of 
all North Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who will unveil his clean-air package Monday, met with industry leaders, 
who said they pleaded against coming up with standards that are too tough to be 
affordable. 
</P>
<P>
"We urged him to make certain that, when the dust settles on clean air, that we 
have a healthy economy left," said William D. Fay, administrator of the Clean 
Air Working Group, a business coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to wait until Monday to see whether or not the point got through," 
Fay said after he and other industry officials met with Bush at the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Readiness to Act Described 
</P>
<P>
Later, at a session with environmental leaders, Bush indicated that he is ready 
to move ahead with strong measures, participants said. 
</P>
<P>
"He said that he agreed this is a freight train coming down the track," said 
George Frampton, president of the Wilderness Society. "He felt that he 
strongly, personally wanted to be out front on this." 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Caplan, executive director of Environmental Action, said: "We are calling 
on him to again do a NATO. It is time for him to exercise leadership and call 
for strong measures to protect the health of the American people." She was 
referring to Bush's dramatic call last month for unilateral troop cuts in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Caplan said Bush was given information on air quality in Kennebunkport, Me., 
where he has a vacation home. "He was shocked to know that last summer there 
were many days in which there were serious health problems from ozone smog," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mind Not Entirely Made Up 
</P>
<P>
White House aides, as well as participants at the industry and environmental 
meetings, insisted that Bush has not made up his mind on many aspects of the 
package, the first major overhaul of the 1970 Clean Air Act in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
But Administration aides said Bush had already decided on many key parts of the 
legislation -- including tough new standards for cleaning up smokestack 
emissions that cause acid rain, changes that would prove costly to industry. 
</P>
<P>
The President also has decided on rigid new standards to prevent chemical 
contamination of the air. 
</P>
<P>
These standards will extend to hundreds of categories of businesses, ranging 
from paint factories to bakeries, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Such suggestions prompted praise from congressional Democrats even before Bush 
submitted his proposal. "He has wholly reversed the position of the Reagan 
Administration on this subject," Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.) said. 
</P>
<P>
Power plants and other industries that burn coal in the Midwest, many of which 
disperse their pollutants through tall smokestacks without technological 
controls, will be a key target of Bush's clean-air attack, the sources said.

SANTA ANA FIRM SAYS EPA DATA IS OUTDATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal-Compack Foods Inc. in Santa Ana has long been known for the chili powder it 
produces. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday, the firm gained public attention for a different reason: The 
small manufacturer of food ingredients was listed among 205 industrial plants 
that release unregulated amounts of dangerous chemicals, some that are 
suspected carcinogens, into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The list, based on a preliminary report compiled by the Environmental 
Protection Agency, was released by Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) to 
underscore the need for tougher air standards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Serious Health Threat 
</P>
<P>
Although none of the companies, including Cal-Compack, are violating federal 
law, the report suggests that those living and working near the plants are 
potentially being exposed to a serious health threat. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA identified the problem pollutant at the Santa Ana plant as ethylene 
oxide, a chemical for sterilizing equipment used to process food ingredients, 
such as the chili powder manufactured by the firm, a subsidiary of 
Beatrice-Hunt Wesson. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the EPA said, residents near the facility in the 4900 block of West 
1st Street faced a 1-in-1,000 chance of developing cancer because of ethylene 
oxide that escaped or was released into the air. Health officials also said the 
highly explosive chemical may cause pregnancy problems and birth defects in 
newborns. 
</P>
<P>
A Cal-Compack spokesman said, however, that the threat posed by the chemical 
emissions has been greatly reduced since the 1987 figures were supplied to the 
EPA. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Quevedo, director of corporate relations for Beatrice-Hunt Wesson, said 
Cal-Compack stopped using ethylene oxide for most of 1988 as company experts 
studied the health issues raised by its use. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, he said, company officials bought an incinerator to destroy 
ethylene oxide once the chemical had been used at the plant, which employs 
about 100 people. Scrubbers were also added to the incinerator to further 
reduce emissions. 
</P>
<P>
The company began using ethylene dioxide again earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in compliance and have been in compliance with every regulatory agency 
around," Quevedo said. "We have a system in place that effectively deals with 
the issue." 
</P>
<P>
According to Quevedo, Cal-Compack uses the ethylene dioxide as a fumigant, to 
rid the plant of insects or unwanted substances that may foul food ingredients. 
The chemical is widely used in the medical industry because of its thoroughness 
and reliability to clean and sterilize equipment and tools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Rattle Some Cages' 
</P>
<P>
Quevedo said his company has no quarrel with Waxman releasing the EPA 
statistics if his aim is to "rattle some cages and gain some political mileage" 
for gaining increased government regulation on such emissions. But he said the 
EPA report unfairly paints his company and others as dangerous polluters, 
because the study relies on 2-year-old data. 
</P>
<P>
"The data isn't current and does not take into consideration what we have done 
to improve the situation," he said. "It's like mixing apples and oranges." 
</P>
<P>
But Quevedo declined to disclose the plant's current emission levels of 
ethylene oxide, figures that must be reported to the federal government, except 
to say that they have been reduced "significantly" since 1987.

Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) joined two colleagues Thursday in introducing a bill 
to provide disability benefits for Vietnam War combat veterans suffering from 
diseases they link to exposure to the defoliant Agent Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation cleared the Senate last year, but not the House, because of 
time pressures and opposition by House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman G. 
V. (Sonny) Montgomery (D-Miss.). Montgomery continues to oppose the bill, his 
spokesman said, pending results of studies by the Centers for Disease Control 
about whether several maladies can be linked conclusively to Agent Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by Kerry, Sen. Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.) and Senate 
Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), would provide 
disability benefits to Vietnam veterans for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 
soft-tissue sarcoma, and survivors benefits for spouses until April 15, 1992. 
Congress then could vote to extend the benefits or to make them permanent. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation's revival follows a recent federal court ruling in California 
that found government regulations on Agent Orange cases too restrictive.

Vice President Dan Quayle, in an interview with the Jerusalem Post published 
Thursday, urged Israel to stop building Jewish settlements in the occupied 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
"These announcements of new settlements are politically problematic even if 
they don't go through with it," Quayle was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed Washington's strong support for Israel but said new settlements 
help Israel's critics in the United States to put pressure on the Jewish state 
to make concessions to the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
"It just gives them (the critics) fodder for the cannon fire, and believe me, 
they want to unload on Israel," Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
In a blunt speech last month that surprised American Jews and Israelis, 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III urged Israel to stop settlement in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government last December approved between five and eight new 
settlements in occupied areas, but Cabinet wrangling over budget allocations 
and a timetable for starting the settlements may delay them.

LUJAN PROMISES TO CORRECT ABUSES IN INDIAN PROGRAMS

Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. promised Thursday to correct abuses in his 
department's Indian programs but rejected a suggestion for a White House office 
to coordinate the $3 billion each year that the federal government spends on 
such matters. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan's promise to move on abuses uncovered by an eight-month congressional 
inquiry won praise from all three members of the investigations subcommittee of 
the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs, although the panel's two 
Democratic members urged the Cabinet officer to be more aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
"I think somebody's got to shake them up. Somebody's got to go in there and 
kick butt," said Sen. Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.), citing a series of problems 
the subcommittee had found with Indian programs during the Ronald Reagan 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expresses Disappointment 
</P>
<P>
Subcommittee Chairman Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) expressed disappointment at 
Lujan's dismissal of a subcommittee suggestion for a presidential office to 
oversee programs for the nation's 1.4 million Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"You might be able to get more and be able to kick some butt if you had someone 
down there in the White House," DeConcini said. 
</P>
<P>
All three senators wrote President Bush earlier this spring, urging that he 
follow the lead of former President Richard M. Nixon and create a White House 
office to handle Indian issues. But Lujan said he saw no need for such an 
office and expressed confidence that he could effectively coordinate the Bush 
Administration's programs himself. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll do what Sen. Daschle suggested; we'll do a little kicking around," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan promised to establish an office within the Bureau of Indian Affairs to 
police what the subcommittee has charged is massive fraud by companies given 
contract preference as Indian-owned and to crack down on child abuse in 
federally run Indian schools. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary also pledged to increase the Bureau of Land Management's control 
over fraud by oil companies that purchase crude oil from Indian tribes. 
</P>
<P>
DeConcini said the subcommittee staff had identified "several millions" of 
dollars in oil fraud in its eight-month investigation, while a BLM staff of 10 
oil inspectors had discovered $20,000 in stolen oil during years of work. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary was one of the final witnesses in what has been a sweeping 
$1.5-million investigation into a number of Indian issues, from corruption 
among tribal leaders to fraud in housing programs. 
</P>
<P>
"The things you have found, those are the easy things to fix," Lujan told the 
committee, promising to take administrative actions to eliminate some of the 
abuses. "It's a big challenge. I will do my best," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee's two Democrats pressed Lujan to shake up a bureaucracy that 
they charged had developed serious problems during the Reagan Administration. 
"The secretary is not meeting that responsibility" of serving as the federal 
government's trustee for Native Americans, DeConcini told Lujan, without 
blaming any specific secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan said his top priority would be education, signaling a shift from the 
Reagan Administration's priority of stressing economic development on Indian 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Daschle, citing high mortality rates among Indians, urged Lujan to reconsider 
and place greater emphasis on health care. "They've got to live before they can 
be educated," the senator said.

ARSON SUSPECTED IN FIRES ON UC IRVINE CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arson is suspected in two small fires that broke out on the UC Irvine campus 
early Thursday morning, UCI officials reported. The blazes were quickly 
extinguished and caused little damage. 
</P>
<P>
Colleen Bentley-Adler, a spokeswoman for the university, said the first fire 
broke out about 2:45 a.m. Thursday on the first floor of the university's 
Administration Building. She said that boxes of financial-aid blank forms were 
stacked beside a wall on the building's first floor and that someone apparently 
set fire to the boxes. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Fire Department doused the blaze before it could spread from 
the stacked boxes, fire officials said. John Hamilton, a spokesman for the 
County Fire Department, said damage to a wall and floor where the boxes were 
situated was estimated at $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bentley-Adler said police began a search around campus after the first fire was 
discovered to see if any other blazes had been set. A second small fire was 
found about 3:15 p.m. in a trash-storage area by a loading dock at the UCI 
Social Science Laboratory, Bentley-Adler said. This fire also was quickly 
extinguished and caused no damage, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bentley-Adler said the university has no idea why a person or persons ignited 
the two fires. "We have no leads and no suspects," she said.

SUPERVISORS TO CONSIDER LAW BARRING AIDS BIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following the lead of other state counties, the County Board of Supervisors 
next Tuesday will consider a law prohibiting job and housing discrimination 
against victims of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
A special citizens committee took 18 months to draw up the proposal, which is 
expected to win unanimous passage from the five supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Uram, director of the county's Health Care Agency, said the county's AIDS 
anti-discrimination proposal differs from other laws around the state in that 
it does not include language dealing with sexual preference and life style. 
</P>
<P>
The county's ordinance, he said, deals only with bias against those suffering 
from AIDS or suspected of carrying the human immunodeficiency virus. 
</P>
<P>
"This comes at a very appropriate time," Uram said. "We decided a long time ago 
to take a long look at this issue before acting. We are pleased with the 
result." 
</P>
<P>
As of May 1, 1,049 cases of AIDS had been reported in the county. The virus has 
proven fatal in about 60% of those cases, county health records showed.

UCI STAFF TO HELP WITH COLON CANCER SCREENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Physicians at UC Irvine will donate their time to provide low-cost colon cancer 
screening to the public to promote early detection of the disease, which is 
highly curable in the beginning stages. 
</P>
<P>
The screening program uses a technique called flexible sigmoidoscopy, which 
uses fiber optics to visualize the lower third of the colon, where about 60% of 
cancers occur. Patients or their insurance companies will be charged only for 
the cost of facilities, testing and materials required for screening. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals over 50 have the highest risk of developing colon cancer, which 
strikes about 6% of the U.S. population, according to Dr. Daniel Hollander, 
head of gastroenterology at the UCI College of Medicine and director of the 
screening program. Over-the-counter colon cancer tests have a high 
false-negative rate and often fail to detect cancer in the early stages, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For information, call (714) 856-8600 or the UCI Medical Center gastroenterology 
diagnostic laboratory at (714) 634-5688.

KRAFT TOLD FRIEND DEATH WAS SEXUAL THRILL, POLICE REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Randy Steven Kraft once told a friend that death was the ultimate sexual 
experience, according to a police report made public at a non-jury hearing 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first public revelation of any motive for Kraft, who is suspected of 
killing 45 people between 1971 and 1983. 
</P>
<P>
However, Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin refused to let jurors hear the 
statement after Kraft's attorneys protested that the friend, Leonard Brouett of 
Seattle, has since qualified it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's shaky . . . I could go into my reasons why, but I won't," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge added that he thought that the statement was "too fraught with 
problems" for the jury to hear it." 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, 44, was convicted last month of the murders of 16 young men in Orange 
County. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown claims that Kraft's killing spree 
resulted in a total of 45 deaths, including six young men in Oregon and two in 
Michigan. Most of the victims, between 18 and 25 with few exceptions, showed 
signs of sexual mutilation or abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony from pathologists and other crime lab experts have indicated that 
many of the victims were abused either after death or when they were in the 
throes of death. But no indication had ever been made public before as to 
whether the actual death was a factor in the attacker's sexual aberrations. 
</P>
<P>
The revelation about the Kraft statement was made during the last day of 
testimony for the week in the penalty phase of Kraft's trial. The jurors who 
found him guilty of 16 murders must decide when the hearing ends whether to 
return a verdict of death or life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Brouett and his roommate, Gary Newell, are key witnesses against Kraft in one 
of the Oregon murders, which is how the statement about the ultimate sexual 
experience came up in court. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, Brouett told an Oregon investigator on July 16, 
1983, two months after Kraft's arrest, that Kraft had made that statement to 
him "off the wall" when they were in Kraft's car. Brouett said he was surprised 
to hear Kraft say it and quickly changed the subject. 
</P>
<P>
But Kraft attorney William J. Kopeny said Brouett told a defense investigator 
that he wasn't sure if Kraft made that statement or if he imagined Kraft said 
it after the Seattle pair learned about his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Brown, however, offered a different view based on his interview with 
Brouett Thursday morning before court. Brown said Brouett told him that while 
he was now unsure about the statement, he is sure that he was telling the truth 
when interviewed by the Oregon investigator in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Brown quoted Brouett as telling him: "That is an accurate statement of what I 
said at that time, but since 1983, my memory has faded." 
</P>
<P>
Even without the statement, the testimony from the two Kraft friends was 
extremely damaging to the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, a computer consultant, had been working at the Peerless Trailer 
Division, a Portland, Ore., division of the Santa Monica-based Lear Siegler 
Inc., during the first four days of December, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
It was Dec. 3, 1982, when 29-year-old Tony Silveira was last known to be alive. 
He had told his family he would be hitchhiking south of Portland down 
Interstate 5, which is within a few miles of where Kraft was working. Silveira 
had been on National Guard duty that week and was returning to his home in 
Medford, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 4, after leaving Peerless, Kraft drove a rental car to Seattle to visit 
Newell and Brouett. Both men testified that he had with him a green fatigue 
jacket with a name stenciled on it. They both recalled the name sounded Latino 
and began with an "S." Brouett testified that it sounded something like 
"Silvestry." They both said that they took Kraft out for a drink with friends 
and that one of them told Kraft, after looking at the fatigue jacket he was 
wearing: "You don't look Hispanic." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Kraft left them to fly from Seattle to Grand Rapids, Mich., where 
he was scheduled to report to another Lear Siegler division, CCSD. Prosecutors 
claim that he killed two more young men in Grand Rapids. 
</P>
<P>
The fatigue jacket with the Silveira name was found on the floor where Kraft 
was staying in Grand Rapids, just 12 feet from his door. 
</P>
<P>
Silveira's body was not found until more than a week later, dumped in a ditch 
off a rural road near I-5 a few miles from where Kraft had been staying. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, who sported a bow tie in court Thursday, appeared undisturbed when the 
statement about sex was debated. But Kraft had a huge smile and nodded hello 
when Newell appeared in court to testify. 
</P>
<P>
Brouett testified that Kraft had gone back out to his rental car to retrieve 
the jacket because they had decided to smoke some marijuana and Kraft had some 
in the jacket's pocket. Kraft lawyers were successful in getting the marijuana 
statements stricken from the record, but not before the jurors had heard it. 
</P>
<P>
Brown is expected to conclude evidence in the last of the six Oregon murders 
Monday and finish discussing the Michigan deaths Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The defense will not begin its case until July 17.

IRVINE POLICE OFFERED OWN IDS FOR DOCTORING; 
</P>
<P>
HOW BOGUS-LICENSE SHOP WAS EXPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Irvine police became suspicious months ago when an increasing number of drivers 
they stopped possessed doctored driver's licenses. Most of those with the fake 
identification were young people, Irvine Police Sgt. Leo Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
"Patrol officers were beginning to bring in quite a number of fraudulent 
documents, through traffic stops, other arrests," Jones said Thursday. "They 
were so frequent, so we told the officers to interview these people. And we 
finally got one who helped us make a contact." 
</P>
<P>
That is how officers learned about Paul Howard Schwartz, 18, a senior at 
Irvine's University High School, who was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of 
operating a $1,000-a-week business doctoring up to 250 licenses for customers, 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Most were being altered for people ages 16 to 18 -- those most likely to use 
fake IDs to gain entry into nightclubs or buy liquor, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Police are continuing their investigation into the operation and plan to take 
the case to the district attorney's office this week, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Motor Vehicles is also considering revoking or 
suspending the licenses of all customers who had their licenses altered, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz was released on his own recognizance to his parents, Jones said 
Thursday. Schwartz was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
At Schwartz's home, Irvine officers confiscated more than 100 valid driver's 
licenses in various stages of being altered, said Jones, who added that just 25 
of the licenses had Irvine addresses. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine police first contacted Schwartz at the end of April, when undercover 
officers ordered doctored driver's licenses from him, turning over to him some 
of their own licenses, including Jones'. 
</P>
<P>
When Schwartz saw Jones' license, he asked one of the undercover officers why 
someone who was obviously older than 21 wanted a doctored license. 
</P>
<P>
"Because he's a criminal, and he wants to hide his identity," the undercover 
officers told Schwartz, according to Jones. 
</P>
<P>
"He really wasn't interested," Jones said of Schwartz. "He was a little 
paranoid and cautious at first. But apparently we gave him a suitable answer." 
</P>
<P>
To the untrained eye, the altered licenses would be unlikely to raise 
suspicion, Jones said. "They were very good counterfeits. A trained observer, 
upon close examination, could see the difference. But if you were in a hurry 
and someone just flashed you a wallet, it could have passed with no problem." 
</P>
<P>
He said Schwartz also apparently kept reproductions of some of the altered 
licenses and was peddling them as well. 
</P>
<P>
Officers found an extra copy of Jones' license at Schwartz's home when he was 
arrested, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
University High Principal Bob Bruce declined to comment on Schwartz, calling 
the incident a police matter, but he talked about why young people might want 
fake driver's licenses. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a young person in Orange County, what do you do?" Bruce asked. "We 
don't have a lot of so-called wholesome activities. We have a few social 
activities, but most of the businesses that cater to those kinds of kids, you 
don't see much anymore, such as bowling alleys, skating rinks. . . . There's 
not much for kids left to do. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're not quite 21, what do you do? 
</P>
<P>
"We need a planned approach to providing more wholesome activities for kids, in 
my view, more rental agreements, more tax agreements or other things to make it 
more economically feasible to get more of these kinds of places."

BALD EAGLE BANDIT MAY HAVE WINGS TRIMMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man suspected of being the county's most prolific bank robber, dubbed the 
Bald Eagle by authorities, was arrested Thursday at a bar in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park police arrested Hector Rodrigo Soto, 31, of Yorba Linda on suspicion 
of 16 bank robberies committed since Jan. 4. Twelve of those were in Orange 
County, the other four in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Richard McMillan said the department's undercover unit received 
information from the FBI on Tuesday about places that Soto frequents. 
Undercover officers arrested Soto in the bar on Euclid Avenue without incident. 
</P>
<P>
The robber was known for his bald pate and thick, metal-rim glasses. He usually 
carried a briefcase and, on occasion, impatiently reached over the bank counter 
to grab money from a cash drawer, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
He had been seen leaving bank robberies in a brown compact car with the license 
619 SND. 
</P>
<P>
Soto is held in Orange County Jail without bail.

CRISIS INTERVENTION TEAM;

<P>
RED CROSS RUSHES AID TO SURVIVORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When the hysterical mother of an 8-month-old girl who died in Thursday's fire 
arrived at the scene, members of a new American Red Cross crisis intervention 
team were there to help Susan Jordan deal with the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
About 35 mental health professionals and registered nurses belong to the 
volunteer program, which was started last November to assist people involved in 
everything from fires to plane crashes, said Sylvia Stewart, public relations 
director for the Red Cross in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to immediate counseling, the Red Cross offers free follow-up 
therapy for those who may be haunted by their disaster-related experiences. 
Victims of disasters sometimes suffer from the post-traumatic stress syndrome 
that also affects combat soldiers, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Victims have reported that they are plagued by nervousness, sleep disorders and 
other behavioral problems for weeks or months after a disaster, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Often there are feelings of helplessness these people are dealing with," 
Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Four counselors spent most of Thursday at the fire site, consoling neighbors 
who witnessed the fire, families of the victims and rescue personnel. The Red 
Cross team also "runs interference" for victims who are being sought by news 
reporters, spectators or fire officials. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan was quickly shepherded into a white van, where counselors spent about 15 
minutes talking to her. They wrapped her in a white blanket and gave her a cold 
drink as the 21-year-old mother started coming to terms with her loss. 
</P>
<P>
"She was definitely in shock," said Linda M. Johnson, a Huntington Beach 
therapist among those who talked to Jordan. "I don't think there's a lot you 
can say. You just try to be there for them." 
</P>
<P>
The counselors also talked with firefighters, ambulance drivers and others 
involved in trying to rescue the two children who died in the fire. Counselors 
gathered the rescue workers in a nearby yard, where they sat under a tree and 
discussed their frustration over the death of the two babies. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the ones who have to do this job and then get out, and they're left 
with all these feelings," said Johnson, who has been a therapist for about 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"One fireman said, 'I've got a 3-year-old niece. I think I'm going to go home 
and call her.' When you're faced with death it brings to the surface your own 
feelings about your own family."

SCOTT OSTLER: WORTHY COOL, CALM, CAN'T COLLECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Scott Ostler 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every basketball player has a free-throw ritual that is as set and ingrained 
and solemn as a religious ceremony. Sometimes the ritual actually involves 
prayer. 
</P>
<P>
It also involves breathing, and sighting, and caressing the ball, and zeroing 
in on the front of the rim. 
</P>
<P>
With two seconds remaining in Thursday night's Game 2 of the NBA Finals, James 
Worthy goes to the line to shoot two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers trail the Pistons by two points. Worthy can send the game into 
overtime and give the Lakers a chance for the upset of the month, at least. He 
can keep alive a limping, struggling, semi-desperate team. 
</P>
<P>
If the Lakers could select a man to be at the line with two seconds left and 
the game on the line, they would choose Magic Johnson, but Johnson is in the 
locker room, cursing his fate and nursing his left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
If not Magic, though, James Worthy is the man they want standing at the line. 
He is a 78% free-throw shooter, which is good but not remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
But in pressure situations, he has a temperament like a lifeguard at Club Med. 
Big Game James. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the playoffs, until the Finals, he has been the team's Mr. Clutch. 
In all the playoff action that led up to the Finals, other than Michael Jordan, 
the NBA's outstanding player was James Worthy. 
</P>
<P>
He was playing the ball of his life for the team of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
He has struggled against the Pistons and their excellent and physical defense. 
In this game, he was 7 for 19 from the field, 4 for 6 from the line. 
</P>
<P>
Still, this is the man you want on the line. Worthy once talked of aspiring, 
after his career, to become a mortician. Another time, he said he might like to 
be a long-haul trucker. He is a man who seeks and finds calm, even on a 
basketball court filled with slashing elbows and crowbar arms. 
</P>
<P>
The previous day, Piston forward John Salley had marveled at Worthy's stoicism 
on the court. "James doesn't ever say anything," Salley said. "Never. He 
doesn't even talk to the refs. He doesn't change his expression. Does he talk? 
No. Never." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry West has said of Worthy, "No player does less to call attention to 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
But now he's got all the attention he needs. Twenty-one thousand fans, 
screaming, the ones behind the Laker basket waving signs and placards that say, 
"CHOKE" and "BRICK." 
</P>
<P>
They wave the signs and scream and slobber and yell like shipwreck victims 
calling out desperately to a passing tramp steamer. It may be some new form of 
aerobics or primal therapy. Very few players even notice. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy steps to the line and begins his ritual. 
</P>
<P>
Bends over, takes a few bounces. Stands up straight, arms hanging, ball held 
around his knees. 
</P>
<P>
Studies the rim. Puffs out his cheeks and heaves a large sigh, as if expelling 
the demons of failure. He looks a little nervous, but he always looks a little 
nervous, even when he's shaking and faking out on the wings, preparing to bury 
an eagle-swoop finger-roll over four opponents. 
</P>
<P>
It's more a look of heightened alertness. How's that for Hollywood 
psychobabble? 
</P>
<P>
He takes a little jerky dip of the knees and springs up slightly, quickly, 
releasing high and following through. 
</P>
<P>
"A very nice stroke," Laker assistant Bill Bertka calls it. 
</P>
<P>
This time the ball drops inches short, hits the front of the rim, bounces up, 
hits the front of the rim again and dribbles off to the left. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers lose. 
</P>
<P>
In an odd bit of strategy, he hits the second free throw instead of clanging it 
and praying for a Laker rebound, but that is strictly a desperation move once 
he has blown the chance to tie. 
</P>
<P>
"I went through my ritual," Worthy says afterwards. "It just rolled off the 
rim." 
</P>
<P>
True to his personality, Worthy does not bare his soul in postgame interviews. 
He looks you in the eye and calmly answers your questions, win or lose. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in that situation before," he says evenly, "it (the pressure, the 
screaming fans) wasn't a big factor. I just concentrated and missed." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Aguirre of the Pistons had a typical reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"Shock," Aguirre says. "Total shock. Shock." 
</P>
<P>
"I was very surprised," says John Salley. "It doesn't seem like he would do 
that. Better him than me." 
</P>
<P>
Isiah Thomas: "I was like: 'Yeah!' I was happy." 
</P>
<P>
And Rick Mahorn said the missed Worthy free throw "felt good. When a pressure 
situation's on you, it's heavy."

Worthy faces the press, cooly, then takes his soft drink and boards the team 
bus inside the Palace. He talks to a couple of teammates, then takes his seat.

The Chicago Cubs traditionally have not minded their neighbors watching games 
free from their rooftops adjacent to Wrigley Field, but they do object to a 
private club charging for rooftop parties. 
</P>
<P>
Club President Donald Grenesko says he has asked the Cubs' architect to design 
a barrier to be erected behind an outfield bleacher section that will block the 
view of the Lakeview Baseball Club, organized by ERTA Development, which owns 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the money," Grenesko said. "It's the principle. They're stealing our 
product, and that just grates on us."

The Major League Players Assn. filed a grievance on behalf of Albert Hall, 
former outfielder for the Atlanta Braves, who was released this spring after 
voluntarily seeking treatment for alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Upon completion of a 28-day program, Hall, 31, rejoined the team March 22, 
appeared in two spring training games as a pinch-runner and never got an at-bat 
before being unconditionally released March 31. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Orza, assistant general counsel for the players' union, said, "They 
didn't give him a chance to make the team." 
</P>
<P>
Hall signed a minor league contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates May 23 and has 
since played for their triple-A affiliate in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
The union argued that Hall should have been sent to the Braves' triple-A 
affiliate in Richmond, Va., as part of his rehabilitation, thereby allowing him 
to continue drawing his major league salary.

CHASING A DREAM; 
</P>
<P>
CYPRESS COLLEGE BASEBALL STAR STEVE GILL IS HOPING TO MAKE U.S. NATIONAL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A couple of weeks ago, Steve Gill suffered one of the major disappointments of 
his baseball career. 
</P>
<P>
Gill, Cypress College's center fielder, and his teammates failed to make the 
state finals and missed a chance at a state championship and the ring that goes 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress, the top-seeded team in Southern California, lost to Los Angeles Harbor 
in the regional final. 
</P>
<P>
But that's pretty much old news for Gill. It's time to move on and face other 
challenges. Or in this case, the biggest challenge of his young career. 
</P>
<P>
Starting Monday, Gill will be testing his skills against many of the nation's 
best collegiate players at the United States Senior baseball team tryouts in 
Millington, Tenn. If this were an Olympic year, the team would represent the 
nation in the Games. 
</P>
<P>
Gill was one of only six community college players selected for the 40-player 
tryout. 
</P>
<P>
Also among the 40 players, who were picked by a committee of coaches from 
around the country, are 25 National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division I 
players and three each from Division II, Division III, and the National Assn. 
of Intercollegiate Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"When they first called me," Gill said, "I really didn't know what they were 
talking about. I was saying 'Yeah, whatever.' But then it sank in that it was a 
great chance. I don't know how I'll do, but it should be a great opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
After a week of tryouts, 10 players will be cut. The team will be cut to 25 
players by June 20. Those players will represent the U.S. in games against 
Japan, Korea and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
"Just to have him selected is a great honor for him and the college," Cypress 
Coach Scott Pickler said. "We nominated our better players just like everyone 
else, and he was picked. He does so many things well, you have to think he has 
a chance to make the team." 
</P>
<P>
Gill, who bats and throws left-handed, was an All-Orange Empire Conference 
player the past two seasons and an all-state player this season. 
</P>
<P>
One of the main reasons Gill was picked for the tryout was his versatility, 
according to Pickler. 
</P>
<P>
Gill hits for average and power, and runs well. 
</P>
<P>
He hit .384 overall, second best on the team to Jason Friedman (.391), who was 
the most valuable player in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Gill led Cypress in home runs with 12, was second with 50 RBIs, and led the 
team with 16 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
Gill's speed and strong arm also made him one of the better defensive players 
in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"He is one of the best athletes I've ever coached," Pickler said. "He is right 
up there with John Fishel." 
</P>
<P>
Fishel, now playing for the Yankees' triple-A team at Columbus, Ohio, played 
for Pickler when he coached at Loara High School. 
</P>
<P>
Gill was drafted by the Atlanta Braves after his senior year at El Dorado High 
School, but decided to go to Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
After hitting .321 with seven home runs as a freshman, he was drafted by the 
Minnesota Twins, but decided to return to Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of high school I never even thought of signing," Gill said. "I didn't 
expect to get drafted and didn't really think of myself as a pro ball player." 
</P>
<P>
In April, Gill signed a letter of intent to play at the University of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins made a final offer to Gill last week before the draft but he said the 
offer was very disappointing and that he is leaning toward going to school. He 
has yet to find out if he was drafted again this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The scouts always want you to sign right now," Gill said. "But there are some 
things I want to take care of. I want to try out for this (U.S. Senior) team, 
and I really want another chance to get a ring." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Senior team notes 
</P>
<P>
Bret Boone of USC and Kevin O'Connor of Illinois, both sophomore infielders, 
are the other Orange County players invited to try out. Boone and Steve Gill 
were teammates at El Dorado. Boone hit .273 this season with nine home runs and 
57 RBIs. He scored 62 runs and had 20 doubles, as well as a team-high six 
game-winning RBIs. O'Connor, who played at Mater Dei High School in 1987, hit 
.323 with no home runs but did have 22 RBIs and 12 steals. O'Connor had signed 
with Cal State Fullerton out of high school in 1987, but when Coach Augie 
Garrido left Fullerton for Illinois, O'Connor followed. . . . Cypress pitcher 
Dennis Burbank (12-5) is trying to make the team as a walk-on in three-day 
tryout that starts today. Bob Hamelin, then of Rancho Santiago, and Brent Mayne 
and Mark Beck of Cal State Fullerton tried out for the team last summer, an 
Olympic year. Hamelin and Mayne were cut, and Beck dropped out with a sore 
shoulder. . . . Ferna Vina of Sacramento City and Bobby Magallanes of Cerritos 
are the other two community college players from California to be invited to 
the tryouts. . . . Charles Greene of Miami Dade Community College South will 
coach the team.

ALMOST PERFECT;

<P>
ESTANCIA JUNIOR HOANG LY CAPTURED EVERY MATCH BUT HIS LAST, THE SOUTHERN 
SECTION FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY NISTA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hoang Ly has been yearning to grab his fishing pole and bait and spend a 
relaxing day on the Newport Beach pier. 
</P>
<P>
Ly, an Estancia High School junior, spent his spring reeling in badminton 
victories and plans to spend much of the summer and the beginning of his senior 
year fishing for a college with a respected badminton program. 
</P>
<P>
Ly, The Times' Orange County badminton player of the year, won five tournament 
championships and lost only one of 66 matches during the past season. His only 
loss was in the Southern Section boys' singles final to Dan Mussman of Alta 
Loma. 
</P>
<P>
But Ly came back the next day to win the Southern California Junior Nationals, 
defeating Marc Carrido, who had beaten Mussman in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Ly also took third place in April in the U.S. Junior Nationals in Colorado 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Olympic Committee has shown interest in bringing him to Colorado 
Springs for school, training and the chance to make the U.S. Olympic team for 
the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, where badminton will be a medal sport 
for the first time. At the 1988 Seoul Olympics, badminton made its Olympic 
debut as a demonstration sport. 
</P>
<P>
But college and the Olympics pose a problem to Ly -- he doesn't want to stray 
too far from home. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I don't know which colleges offer what, but I know that some nearby 
schools do offer badminton," Ly said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if he passes up the Olympic Committee offer and such a respected badminton 
school as Arizona State, Ly says his chances are still good to make the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"If I try, I will make it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His coach, Lillian Brabander, just wants to see him develop during his college 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing for him to do is to go to a college with a really good 
(badminton) program," Brabander said. "He is as good as anyone in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
He showed that when he finished third in the U.S. Junior Nationals and won the 
Southern California Junior National championship. And he has added tournament 
victories this season at Garden Grove, Estancia, Chino, Covina and Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing missing from his list of achievements is the Southern Section 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I will do it next year," Ly said. "I played more patient this year and 
I was more consistent this year. I want to change my game next year. I want to 
be more consistent. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a horrible time serving this year. It was on about 80% of the time. I 
want it to be more like 90%." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that's the formula that will bring the elusive Southern Section 
championship he has been fishing for.

THE HOT SEAT; 
</P>
<P>
MCGAUGHEY HAS ONE MORE CHANCE TO SILENCE CRITICS 
</P>

<P>
The worst seat in a baseball stadium is the manager's. It's hard to see much 
from the dugout. And sometimes, the worst place for a trainer to watch a horse 
race is from an owner's box seat. 
</P>
<P>
That's where Shug McGaughey was standing at Pimlico, in Ogden Phipps' box, when 
their Easy Goer lost by a nose to Sunday Silence in the Preakness three weeks 
ago. Easy Goer also finished second in the Kentucky Derby, losing to Sunday 
Silence by 2 1/2 lengths, and Saturday, in the 121st Belmont Stakes, the New 
York-based horse will try to keep his California-based rival from sweeping the 
Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
The box-seat area is not very elevated at Pimlico, unlike the high stands at 
Churchill Downs for the Derby. What's more, McGaughey stands only 5 feet 5 
inches, so he didn't see all of the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
As the field neared the far turn, McGaughey still had his horse in view when 
Pat Day, the jockey, moved Easy Goer from third place past the second-place 
Sunday Silence. Houston was still trying to hold the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Said McGaughey: "When I saw that, I said to myself, 'How far are we going to 
win by?' " 
</P>
<P>
Then McGaughey lost sight of the field for a few moments because the horses 
were blocked by the corporate tents in the infield. 
</P>
<P>
"When the horses got past the tents, my horse hadn't gone by Houston yet," 
McGaughey said. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Valenzuela, riding Sunday Silence, was surprised to see Easy Goer pass him 
when he did, but he resisted hustling his mount. There was still almost a 
half-mile to go. 
</P>
<P>
Then near the top of the stretch, Sunday Silence edged back ahead of Easy Goer. 
McGaughey had a good view of that. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I said to myself, 'How far is Sunday Silence going to win by?' " 
the trainer said. 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey said he has not seen a videotape of the entire Preakness, but he is 
certain about one thing: "It was a strange race." 
</P>
<P>
There were many observers who thought that Day, one of the best jockeys in the 
country and a three-time winner of the Eclipse Award, had given Easy Goer a 
strange ride. McGaughey does not disagree. 
</P>
<P>
"When my horse passed Sunday Silence, Pat didn't go on with him, and as a 
result we let Sunday Silence get back in the race," McGaughey said. 
"(Valenzuela) could have hit the panic button, but he didn't. But Pat (Day) 
gave him time to get his thoughts together." 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey might have been better off if the Pimlico tents had been in his way 
for the stretch run, because he didn't like seeing Easy Goer on the inside, 
where Day had less room to maneuver while being crowded into the rail by Sunday 
Silence. 
</P>
<P>
Day, who unsuccessfully claimed foul against Sunday Silence and Valenzuela, 
said that he put Easy Goer on the fence because he was afraid Sunday Silence 
would float his colt out into the center of the track if he chose to go around. 
</P>
<P>
After the Preakness, Angel Cordero, who had ridden Houston to a sixth-place 
finish, was conspicuously present around Easy Goer's barn, prompting 
speculation that McGaughey might make a jockey change for the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey says now that he never even considered a switch. He and Day, who 
rides mainly in the Midwest, go back a number of years, to the days before 
McGaughey was hired by the Phipps family -- days when he was a struggling 
claiming trainer. 
</P>
<P>
"I've made up my mind that I'm not going to worry about jockeys anymore," 
McGaughey said at his Belmont Park barn this week. "When I was in Kentucky, Day 
was so much better than the other riders that it was a daily battle trying to 
get him to ride as many of your horses as possible. But in New York -- and in 
California -- there are so many good ones that you don't have to worry. And 
there are always new ones popping up, like Chris Antley has here recently. 
There will be a lot of things that will worry me more the rest of my life other 
than which jockeys are going to ride my horses." 
</P>
<P>
Day has had several second-place finishes in big races aboard Easy Goer and 
Seeking the Gold, another important Phipps horse trained by McGaughey. Easy 
Goer also ran second -- to Is It True -- in last year's Breeders' Cup Juvenile, 
and that outcome, combined with the runner-up finishes in the Derby and the 
Preakness, produced a difference of more than $1 million in purses. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking the Gold ran second in the Metropolitan Handicap here nine days after 
the Preakness, and last year he was second under Day in three other major 
races, including the $3-million Breeders' Cup Classic. Still, McGaughey remains 
Day's staunchest supporter. The trainer cites all of the other close finishes 
by the jockey that have gone their way. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence probably will go to the lead Saturday because there's no other 
legitimate front-runner in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think my horse will be on the lead, unless Sunday Silence wants to 
give it to us," McGaughey said. "I think we'll be laying right off the pace. 
Then it will be up to Pat (Day) to force Valenzuela into a mistake. Maybe we 
can get Sunday Silence on the inside this time." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens, McGaughey will be able to see the entire race. The box seats 
are nicely elevated at Belmont, and there are no tall tents in the infield.

INSURANCE UNITS OF IRVINE-BASED LINCOLN TO BE SOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal regulators said Thursday they plan to sell the major insurance 
operation of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan to a Dallas investment 
firm for an undisclosed price. 
</P>
<P>
The insurance operation is part of a Lincoln subsidiary that filed for 
bankruptcy April 13, along with Lincoln's parent company, American Continental 
Corp., and 10 other S&amp;L subsidiaries. Lincoln was seized by regulators the 
next day. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators said they intend to sell Continental Fidelity Insurance Co. and its 
operating unit, American Founders Life Insurance Co., to Zlogar &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Zlogar had been negotiating with Phoenix-based American Continental to purchase 
the insurance operation before American Continental filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
petition. Under the petitions, executives at American Continental remain in 
control of the holding company, but regulators control the Lincoln 
subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase price in the current deal was not revealed, but it is all cash and 
higher than the value of the cash-and-notes deal that Zlogar had worked out 
with American Continental, said Al Zlogar, the Dallas company's president. The 
value of the previous deal was a little less than $45 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The deal still must be approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix because 
the insurance operations are owned directly by the Amcor Funding Corp. 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
"We're elated," Zlogar said. "The insurance companies are healthy and rated 
A-excellent by A.M. Best Co. (an industry rating firm). We intend to maintain 
that rating or better it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Operates in 23 States 
</P>
<P>
The decision to buy the insurance operation, he said, was "95% based on the 
management of company." He said he was "very impressed" with current managers, 
who would remain in place after the purchase and help expand the company. 
</P>
<P>
American Founders, with $300 million in assets, is licensed in 37 states and 
operates in 23. 
</P>
<P>
Mark M. Connally, an American Continental spokesman, said it was too early to 
know if the company would object to the proposed sale. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, American Continental outlined a plan to work its way out of 
bankruptcy. The plan includes the transfer of Amcor to a new holding company 
owned by American Continental executives. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not seen the terms of the sale, so we don't know yet if it will impact 
our proposal," Connally said. "However, at this point, our plan will have 
serious viability with or without American Founders Life." 
</P>
<P>
Amcor's other major asset is its 20% stake in General Oriental Investments 
Ltd., an offshore international investment firm headed by British financier Sir 
James Goldsmith.

2 KIDS FROM INDIO;

<P>
C&amp;C OWNERS PUT TOGETHER A PROMISING SPORTSWEAR BUSINESS AND HAVE FUN DOING 
IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It may say June, 1989, on the calendar, but it is the spring of 1990 at C&amp;C 
Inc. in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-year-old company, owned by former childhood playmates Donald A. (Dac) 
Clark and Paul Carr, designs, produces and distributes surf and sportswear for 
one of the industry's hottest labels, Gotcha, as well as for two newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
In the surf-wear business, as in most of the clothing trade, work is always 
being done a year or more in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Now is the time that C&amp;C's designers begin firming up their concepts for 
next year's looks. And it is the time -- in the lull before the frenzy of 
turning sketches into product -- that Clark and Carr lay plans for the future. 
</P>
<P>
It is a future that appears to be as bright as the fluorescent colors of the 
surf wear they produce. C&amp;C posted nearly $2 million in profits last year 
on $22 million in sales and is poised for growth as it prepares to expand into 
several other clothing lines. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said he figures that the company should be doing about $50 million in 
annual sales by the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a couple of guys who got into the rag trade by accident. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Clark, whose father owned a small chain of retail stores in Indio, 
Blythe and El Centro, swore at an early age that the retailing business was not 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
He and Carr had decided to be lawyers. To prepare for law school, Clark went 
off to the University of Arizona while Carr enrolled at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
But at the end of his junior year in 1971, Clark decided that he needed a break 
and drove to Orange County. He moved in with Carr and took a $1.75-an-hour job 
in a little jeans and camping-equipment shop in Orange, a place called the Wild 
West Store. 
</P>
<P>
Clark never went back to school and Carr joined him at Wild West after 
graduating from UCI in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years later, that single store had grown into a leisure-wear chain of 24 
stores with annual sales of about $60 million. Carr was head buyer and Clark, 
no longer down on retailing, was its president. 
</P>
<P>
What Wild West did, Clark said, was to largely ignore the retailing rules that 
said a jeans store sold only jeans and kept inventory to a minimum to limit 
losses caused by quick shifts in consumers' tastes. Instead, the consumer 
became king as Wild West decided to carry enough stock so that everyone, of 
every size, could find what he or she needed, when the person needed it. 
</P>
<P>
Wild West Stores also helped pioneer the now widespread formula of carrying 
entire lines of leisure and sportswear and accessories. 
</P>
<P>
The approach worked, and Clark and Carr became wealthy when they sold their 
shares to General Mills when it acquired Wild West in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Clark and Carr also became members of General Mills' corporate hierarchy, Clark 
as a vice president in charge of the Wild West division and Carr as general 
merchandising manager for General Mills. But General Mills underwent a change 
of direction almost immediately after buying Wild West and folded the operation 
as part of a corporate restructuring. In the process, Clark and Carr soured on 
corporate life and left in late 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The valuable lesson they learned at General Mills, Carr said, "was how to make 
plans and think things out" before committing time and resources. 
</P>
<P>
And Carr left General Mills with a plan. He had been approached by a former 
Wild West supplier, Gotcha Sportswear, and was asked to set up an independent 
company to produce a sportswear line under license. 
</P>
<P>
Gotcha, a growing Costa Mesa surf-wear maker, wanted to expand from shorts and 
swim trunks into jeans, jackets and knit shirts. 
</P>
<P>
Carr agreed to the deal, contacted Clark, and the two combined their skills and 
capital to form C&amp;C Inc. to serve as Gotcha's domestic sportswear and 
accessories licensee. Gotcha retained the international license and has other 
domestic licensees to produce its swim trunks and some other products. 
</P>
<P>
Clark and Carr attribute part of their success as distributors and producers to 
their experience in retailing. 
</P>
<P>
As retailers, they said, they learned the importance of quality and speedy 
delivery and vowed as suppliers to always provide those attributes to their 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
They also took from retailing a profound respect for the financial benefits of 
information management. So they immediately outfitted C&amp;C with 
sophisticated computer systems to keep track of the myriad parts of the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"Plus, we do complete marketing plans for everything we produce," Carr added. 
"We study the numbers and the competition and the market and the pricing and 
work with the licensors so that when we make something, we know it will sell 
and we know how much will sell and where it will sell." 
</P>
<P>
It took about two years for the partners to decide that they had made the right 
decision by going into the production end of the clothing business, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept asking ourselves if we were having fun yet, and after 24 months of 
20-hour days, we discovered that the answer was 'yes.' But we learned that no 
matter how good an idea looks, nothing is ever as good as it seems, and it 
always takes a lot more money and time than you thought it would to get 
something started." 
</P>
<P>
Underestimating the money it took to get started was probably the partners' 
biggest blunder, he said. 
</P>
<P>
To help the business grow, Clark and Carr eschewed salaries for the first two 
years, living on the proceeds of the sale of their Wild West stock. And they 
consistently have plowed a lot of their profits back into the business. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year they added a second set of products, obtaining licensing rights 
to a relatively new brand of surf wear from Rusty, a San Diego surfboard 
designer-manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
And this year, they signed a deal with Newport Surf 'N Sports, a Newport Beach 
surf shop, to create, manufacture, sell and distribute a lower-cost, less 
adventuresome line of surf wear. 
</P>
<P>
To handle the three different lines, C&amp;C serves as holding company for two 
separate operating units. Employees wear color-coded badges that limit their 
access to various parts of the company's facility and prominently posted signs 
remind them that those working for the Rusty line are not allowed into the 
Gotcha parts of the building. 
</P>
<P>
It all seems confusing and will get even more complex. Clark said that C&amp;C 
ultimately would like to be licensee for five or six brands and to become 
diversified "so that we have more than just surf wear." 
</P>
<P>
But the two kids from Indio are having fun, and as far as Clark is concerned, 
leaving General Mills and the relative safety of the corporate umbrella was the 
best move they ever made. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between owning the business and working for someone else is 
huge. There is just enormous satisfaction in not having the ambiguity and 
discontinuity you have to deal with in a big corporation, where easy things get 
complex," Clark said, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"I can't solve every problem that we have in this business, but I have good 
people who bring me the solutions, and the satisfaction is in being able to 
say, 'You're right, let's do it!' "

BRIEFCASE: APPLIED DATA COMMUNICATIONS TRIMS WORK FORCE 21% DUE TO SLOWING

Applied Data Communications in Tustin said Thursday that it laid off 13 
employees, or 21% of its work force, last month because of a decline in 
business for the company's fiscal fourth quarter ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
President Walter J. Kane said that orders were below expectations and that 
sales were down during the quarter compared to the year-earlier period. 
Complete financial results will be released later this month, Kane said. 
</P>
<P>
Applied Data, a maker of duplication and test equipment for computer storage 
devices, lost $483,700 for its fiscal 1989 third quarter, while revenue was 
$1.75 million, down 32% from the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The cutbacks, affecting workers in most areas of the company, reduce the 
company's payroll to 48 workers. Five years ago, the firm employed 137 workers. 
</P>
<P>
Kane said the layoffs will allow the company to be profitable at its current 
level of business. He said no further job cutbacks are expected. He said the 
company expects to save about $500,000 on an annual basis from the reduced work 
force. JOHN CHARLES TIGHE

STRATEGY FOR SAFER SUMMER GLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
You know things are really changing when George Hamilton, Mr. Tan himself, 
admits to being cautious about sunbathing. Not that he's swearing off, but 
having perfected his golden, rotisserie glow, he's teaching himself to play it 
safer. 
</P>
<P>
This new attitude accompanies his first sun product collection, George 
Hamilton's Sun Care System, which he will introduce Tuesday at Neiman Marcus in 
Beverly Hills, from 1 till 2:30 p.m. The 49-year-old ray catcher now admits 
that not even he is immune to the aging effects of his favorite pastime. But he 
does say, "I'm aging gracefully, I think." 
</P>
<P>
To enhance that process he now uses Tan Master, a body oil with a skimpy SPF 
(sun protection factor) of 2, from his signature collection. For paler faces, 
his line includes lotions with SPFs from 4 to 15, priced from $11.50 to $14.50 
and made by Pantron I, a Los Angeles-based company that also produces his 
mail-order skin-care line. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton's system is different from all the rest, he says, more because of the 
tanning technique he espouses than the products themselves. His way is to start 
gradually, wearing a lotion with a high SPF number (although he feels safe with 
only an SPF 4), then "weaning" off it as soon as the skin shows the first signs 
of toasting. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, he parts company with more conservative sunbathers. "I try to 
stay off SPF products," he says. "I let my own skin's natural block build up 
and protect me." The block he refers to, melanin, is the skin's own protective 
pigment that develops when the skin is exposed to sun. Hamilton says he'd 
rather rely on it than a lotion with a high SPF factor. 
</P>
<P>
"Most dermatologists would have problems with that," counters Dr. Nicholas 
Lowe, clinical professor of dermatology at UCLA School of Medicine. "A suntan 
doesn't protect skin nearly that well. It won't stop the skin from aging or 
showing precancerous signs later on. The safest thing is to use an SPF 15 
product and tan slowly." Tan skin contains a natural SPF level of 4, and even 
the darkest skin contains not more than an SPF 5, Lowe explains. 
</P>
<P>
While Hamilton admits to signs of aging, he doesn't believe that the sun caused 
it. In fact, he says, "my skin is smooth, though you'd think it would look like 
parchment by now." 
</P>
<P>
His well-publicized adventures in body care have helped keep him looking 
younger, he believes. Most notably: the rejuvenation injections he had several 
years ago at Switzerland's famed La Prairie health clinic, his habits of 
drinking six glasses of water each day, following a liquid diet several days 
each month and refraining from smoking and drinking alcohol, except 
occasionally. He says that he doesn't need facials and that he doesn't believe 
in cosmetic surgery. "I'm not trying to replace nature, but to fortify it," he 
maintains. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Lowe and others, including Hamilton, are looking for a new element when 
evaluating sun-care products. "Broad-spectrum protection" is the catch phrase 
of the moment. And indeed, Hamilton's line does claim to offer such protection. 
</P>
<P>
In the simplest terms, it means that a sun-care product not only provides a 
shield against the well-known dangers of the sun's burning, ultraviolet-B (UVB) 
rays; it also protects against ultraviolet-A (UVA) rays, which doctors have 
confirmed to be at least as damaging, if not more so. 
</P>
<P>
Lowe says: "There is a lot of evidence that UVA can do a great deal of damage. 
It penetrates the skin more deeply than UVB. That can increase skin aging." 
Lowe also is concerned about the safety of indoor tanning, because tanning beds 
use high-intensity UVA rays. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Hamilton's opinion of high SPF factors, one safeguard against UVA may 
be to use screens with levels well above 15, because some doctors believe that 
sun products with higher numbers do screen about 80% of UVA rays. 
</P>
<P>
One advocate of that theory, Dr. Madhu Pathak, an associate professor of 
dermatology at Harvard Medical School, explains that the FDA has not yet 
developed a numbering system for UVA protection. And the medical community 
isn't guaranteeing that the UVA protection in any sunscreen is adequate. In the 
end, he holds that the safest suntan is no suntan at all. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Photoplex by Herbert Laboratories in Irvine, Calif., is the sun-care 
product with the highest amount of UVA protection, according to Lowe. Using an 
unofficial and complicated measuring technique, he gives Photoplex a 4.8 
factor, as opposed to the 3.0 to 3.4 found in most products he has evaluated. 
To date, there is no approved system of communicating this information to the 
consumer. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, other mass-market manufacturers, notably Coppertone and 
Hawaiian Tropic Tan, have started to specify "broad-spectrum coverage" on 
labels when appropriate. And companies such as Estee Lauder, Clinique, Lancome 
and Chanel, with prestige-priced sun products, are trying to educate consumers 
on the subject of UVA via department store cosmetics consultants. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton, who learned all he knows about UVA from conversations with chemists 
and physicists, says more than just the consumers are still educating 
themselves about it. "I think UVA is not yet well understood, except that 
testing shows it is deeply damaging to skin," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
But he adds: "We've got our heads in the sand if we think people are going to 
give up the sun. People think a tan looks healthy, so we've got to offer them a 
saner way to be out in the sun." 
</P>
<P>
Commercial protection may always fall somewhat short of that. As Harvard's 
Pathak says: "The best sunscreen is total darkness. The next best thing is to 
dramatically reduce sun exposure."

PHANTOM DOES L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
SEDUCTIONS ARE MANY FOR BROADWAY STAR AS HIT SHOW RETURNS HIM TO HOLLYWOOD 
</P>

<P>
Michael Crawford is blushing. 
</P>
<P>
But the color overtaking his complexion is not just the pale pink shade of 
modesty. Rather, this beet-red hue, which stretches from the bottom of his neck 
to the roots of his hairline, is a mark of unmitigated embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
That's the Phantom of the Opera's reaction to being called L.A.'s newest sex 
symbol. 
</P>
<P>
He stutters. He sighs. He even shakes a little. Is this acting or is this real? 
</P>
<P>
"So you say I could carry away any woman here who's seen me perform. Well, um, 
er," he hesitates, "I don't have the strength to carry away a woman -- unless 
she was very small." 
</P>
<P>
You'd think by now that someone who was the toast of London and New York and 
even Time magazine, who received 160 fan letters one week after his West Coast 
debut, who shed tears because his personal reviews were so good, could take a 
compliment with more aplomb than this. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Was in 'Hello, Dolly!' 
</P>
<P>
But despite his discomfort, Crawford, 47, knows that every night he succeeds in 
seducing Ahmanson Theater audiences is vindication for the humiliation that 
Hollywood handed him 23 years ago. At that time he landed the young lead in 
"Hello, Dolly!" and moved to Bel-Air, only to return to England a few failed 
film roles later without ever consummating his dream of an American movie 
career. 
</P>
<P>
"You make a couple of bum movies, and for this town, that's it. You don't get 
another chance for a long time," he explains without bitterness. "And I didn't 
want to do things that would be more harmful than what I'd felt I'd done to 
myself already by then." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Hollywood is trying again to tempt him with movie deals, and Crawford's 
agents at International Creative Management are fielding dozens of interested 
calls. Even the Phantom himself can't keep from boasting that next week he's 
taking a meeting with two of the town's most dynamic film makers -- Walt Disney 
Co.'s Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm only now becoming fully aware of 'Phantom's' impact here. And it's 
woooooooonderful. I just want to stretch that word around the moon when I say 
it. That's how excited I am by all this," Crawford gushes. "Now I can say 
honestly that I don't miss not having had a Hollywood career. What could I have 
that's bigger than 'Phantom'? I couldn't have hoped for anything more in my 
life professionally." 
</P>
<P>
With that, his blue eyes lose their sincerity and take on a slyness. And he 
leans forward and whispers sensually into his interviewer's ear. 
</P>
<P>
"But, of course, if you hear of anyone in Hollywood with a good part for me, 
please have them leave their phone numbers at the stage door. And I will 
contact them immediately." 
</P>
<P>
So, like other L.A. luminaries, Crawford must be doing the town in style, 
getting the best tables at Spago, living in sumptuous elegance at the Beverly 
Wilshire, driving around in a Ferrari Testarossa. Right? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"All you do is go out there and try to climb that mountain every night and get 
to the top. And when you come forward, the audience applauds. And that's it. 
That's your moment. And then it's 'Good night, everyone. See you tomorrow.' And 
you go home and go to bed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Having Fun 
</P>
<P>
But even when he's not giving one of his eight weekly performances (he almost 
never misses one, performing even with minor illnesses), it doesn't seem like 
he's having much fun. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to know about the life of a so-called star?" He laughs. "There's so 
much smog coming in through the windows that it's spent with a feather duster, 
in the laundry room and with the vacuum cleaner on my days off, because I can't 
find help. Though I don't know if I should say that," he adds, nervous now, 
"because I'll probably get some offers!" 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the L.A. Phantom is living most unglamorously in a downtown apartment as 
the quintessential divorced dad (his two daughters are in England), because 
he's more comfortable that way than in a hotel. "I'm the independent sort. I 
like looking after things," he says, even though that meant eating a cold 
Christmas dinner alone in Manhattan in 1987 because the oven in the place where 
he was staying wouldn't work. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's actually offered to come to supper with me after reading that story," 
he laments. 
</P>
<P>
When he doesn't have to be up too early the next day, he gets into his Toyota 
Cressida and finds a friend and tries to dine somewhere cheap on the Westside. 
"But it's very hard for me to get a table in a restaurant," he complains. "I 
end up being mistaken for the waiter, and somebody asks me to get them a drink 
when I walk in. So I don't make a big impression." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unfortunate Reception 
</P>
<P>
So far, at least, he's a frequent customer at Pane Caldo in Beverly Hills. 
"I've established a stronghold there. I get a table, and they're really nice." 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't get a pleasant reception at a West Hollywood cafe recently. "I 
rang up and booked a table for two one Sunday and there was a long pause before 
they said, 'Yes, I think we can fit you in.' And, when I got there, we were the 
only two people in the restaurant. So maybe they were waiting for all those 
customers to fly on in." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the heavy makeup he wears as the Phantom (it takes two hours to 
apply), whose disfigurements hide Crawford's own classic features, the actor is 
able to walk around Los Angeles without being recognized. "Still, I think, 
'Well, you never know. Maybe people have seen the news by now.' But obviously 
they haven't because they don't have the faintest idea who I am. And now that 
my publicist has put together a 45-minute tape of the TV coverage of "Phantom" 
here for me to watch, I could take a copy of it into restaurants and while I'm 
waiting for a table ask, 'Do you have a VCR? I just want to see some of my 
reviews!' " 
</P>
<P>
Most of the time, though, Crawford cooks for himself -- mostly meatless, 
low-fat meals that adhere to the special diet he's devised to control his 
hiatal hernia. 
</P>
<P>
But after every performance, the first thing Crawford does is reach for a pint 
of Guinness stout "because I think it gives me iron -- and I'm sticking to that 
story." 
</P>
<P>
He has even made an arrangement with the Guinness company to make sure he has a 
continuous supply in Los Angeles -- though someone should tell him the ale can 
be bought at the local market. 
</P>
<P>
He eschews L.A.'s penchant for fitness trainers, preferring to work out on his 
own. "It's cheaper," he declares. In fact, Crawford is getting more exercise 
than usual scrambling up and down the stage in his Phantom role because the 
Ahmanson Theater is taller than either of its previous venues -- in London and 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I lean out further, and I climb higher and I stand right on the edge of the 
rail," Crawford boasts. "(Director) Hal Prince closes his eyes when I do that. 
But I like to put myself through such a workout. And as I lean over at the end, 
you can see on the curtain calls that the sweat's just pouring out of the bald 
cap I've got on." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Crawford gained 10 pounds after his New York run was over, "and it 
frightened me a bit when I put it on." But, within three days after performing 
"Phantom" in Los Angeles, he'd lost every ounce, and now his civilian costume 
-- a typically British tweed jacket, pastel silk shirt and gray flannel slacks 
-- hangs looser than he would like. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, he's not nearly as skinny -- nor as blond -- as when he first 
performed in public as a choirboy at St. Paul's Cathedral in London and as a 
boy-soprano chimney sweep in Benjamin Britten's "Let's Make an Opera" in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
By 19, Crawford was cast as Hero in "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the 
Forum," his first major American movie (filmed in Spain), which started him on 
a long succession of comedic ingenue roles. In 1962, when he made his stage 
debut in Neil Simon's "Come Blow Your Horn" in the West End of London, 
audiences were charmed by his physical clowning. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1960s, Crawford was a veteran of several films, including a starring 
role in "How I Won the War" with Beatle John Lennon. During the filming, they 
shared a house in Spain where Crawford watched in awe one day while Lennon 
wrote "Strawberry Fields Forever" sitting cross-legged on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
But "Hello, Dolly!" in 1969 was his first singing-and-dancing role. And he had 
to play an American, which he wasn't. But legendary dancer Gene Kelly worked 
with the young actor and got him into shape for the role -- which is why, for 
his L.A. debut, Crawford made a special point of inviting Kelly as his special 
guest. "I wouldn't be doing what I am today, or have done since, without his 
help," Crawford notes. "Because I was very introverted in a way, and he gave me 
the belief in myself that you need to become a performer." 
</P>
<P>
After a 20-minute screen test, Crawford was hired and given equal billing with 
Barbra Streisand and Walter Matthau. "I mean, there was no justification for 
this. But I had completely bamboozled the executive producer, Roger Eames. He 
said: 'What we're looking for is an attractive idiot. And my wife thinks you're 
attractive, and I think you're an idiot.' " 
</P>
<P>
After appearing in lackluster films such as "The Games" and "Hello Goodbye," 
Crawford returned to England where he triumphed for the next 20 years in 
comedic roles on the stage in the West End and in a hugely popular British 
television series. 
</P>
<P>
And there he remained -- virtually forgotten by Hollywood -- until his 
"Phantom" triumph on Broadway, which he says was just as unexpected as his 
early success in "Hello Dolly!" 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe someone was smiling over me," Crawford explains. "Because, again, there 
was no earthly reason why someone would cast me as the Phantom. It's a 
flattering thing to have happen. And both times it worked out a treat." 
</P>
<P>
Crawford was starring on the London stage in "Barnum" when Andrew Lloyd Webber 
first mentioned to him that "he was going to do this new project and maybe I'd 
be interested. And I said I'd love to -- and I didn't hear another thing for a 
year and half." 
</P>
<P>
But on the day that Crawford announced he was quitting "Barnum," Webber showed 
up and asked him to listen to some music. 
</P>
<P>
Webber played the overture of "Phantom of the Opera" for Crawford, who had only 
to hear 12 bars before he knew it was his. "Within 45 seconds, I knew how to 
stand, I knew the look of the man, and I knew I wanted to do it. It sounds 
silly now, but it was just like someone had entered my body. That character was 
saying, 'Here I am. I'm waiting for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
These days, it is audiences who wait anxiously for Crawford, who as the Phantom 
is on stage for a mesmerizing 30 minutes of singing, sauntering, slaughtering 
and seducing. 
</P>
<P>
With his high singing voice and comedic background, Crawford was far from the 
obvious choice to play the ghoul of the Paris Opera House. And yet, the Tony 
Award-winning actor knows that by playing the role in London, New York and now 
Los Angeles, and possibly Australia in the future, he has made it uniquely his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
So much so, he notes with undisguised glee, that when the Center Theatre 
Group's volunteers recently invited him to speak at one of their meetings, he 
was more warmly received than Christopher Reeve. "So the Phantom was more 
popular than Superman, and I don't even wear my knickers on the outside," 
Crawford laughs. 
</P>
<P>
To hear him talk about playing the role, the Phantom's sensuality just seems to 
come naturally to him. "Really, I'm not actually aware that women react like 
that. Because you don't hear the talk at intermission. You don't hear the talk 
in the ladies' washroom. You don't hear the talk after the show. But it's 
understandable, I suppose, because we wanted to make him sort of a masked 
Valentino. But, instead of jumping in and out of everyone's window, he's just 
in one window. He has just one love. And that's the ultimate seduction, I 
guess." 
</P>
<P>
And Crawford has shown himself to be the ultimate seducer, no matter that he's 
playing a horribly disfigured and devilishly determined killer. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I'm doing. Honestly. Like when I run my hands over my hair, 
people say, 'Oh, that's very seductive.' But the reason I did that at first was 
because I'd taken my hat off and we were always worried it would upset the wig 
and the mask. And I said, 'All right, I'll straighten it,' so I just went like 
that with my hands one day. And Gillian Lynne, the choreographer, said, 'Oh my 
gawd. Darling, do that again for me.' 
</P>
<P>
"And I said, 'What? Is my hair still upset?' 
</P>
<P>
"And she said, 'No, just do that again -- slow-ly.' " 
</P>
<P>
So you tell him that when he made that gesture at a performance recently, a 
woman in the audience sighed, "Oh, my," prompting her jealous husband to 
respond, "So, you like him, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
"Then I'm going to come out there one night, and I'll just keep walking," 
Crawford pledges. "I mean, if Christine rejects me, sod it, I'm going to go 
straight out into the audience." 
</P>
<P>
With that, he blows you a kiss -- and is gone.

FOR FUN AND SUN DAYS

Long before there were sun screens in plastic containers, there were parasols 
and sun hats. Parasols remain passe. But wide-brim hats are back as a chic way 
to help foil ultraviolet rays. 
</P>
<P>
Paired with an SPF 15 -- or higher -- sun screen, they provide good coverage 
and a certain joie de vivre no matter how practical or basic the design. An 
example is the regulation California lifeguard hat, an oversize, functional 
model made of hand-woven palm that retails for about $10. Because it's linked 
to a glamorous occupation, the hat is considered a trendy summer accessory all 
the way from the West Coast to the West Indies. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Walker, owner of Cindirco, the Encinitas-based company that makes the 
hat, also offers fancier versions. They have one or two rows of fringe, a 
design detail suggested by her 16-year-old son. But despite input from her own 
teen-ager, Walker notes: "At the beach, hats are being worn mainly by surfers 
and people in their late 20s or older. Surfers are exposed to the sun a lot and 
seem to realize the danger. But the very young haven't discovered the need for 
a hat yet." 
</P>
<P>
George Christy, columnist for the Hollywood Reporter, discovered the need after 
he developed skin cancer about 12 years ago. His doctor told him "to cover my 
head and wear sun block," and Christy obeyed. He now has a vast arsenal that 
includes baseball caps and straws with brims. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Klein, assistant clinical professor at UCLA and the Beverly Hills 
dermatologist who told Christy to cover his head, cautions: "Hats are 
beneficial, but don't let them give you a false sense of protection. On a 
bright, clear day, the sun's rays can be reflected and scattered even in the 
shade." His recommendation is a hat plus a sunscreen rated SPF 15 or higher. 
</P>
<P>
Carl S. Korn, assistant clinical professor at USC and a Sherman Oaks 
dermatologist, has an anti-sun list that includes "wearing hats, long-sleeve 
garments, even gloves and avoiding recreational activities between 10 in the 
morning and 3 in the afternoon, standard time." 
</P>
<P>
Although sun protection is a serious subject, Oliver Kroeten and Louise 
Gonzales, who design under the name Oliver Louise, give their hats a 
lighthearted treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Kroeten says business is getting a boost from two trends: Men are going for 
bolder hats and fashion is dictating pale skin. "The look is not to be tan, 
even in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
Oliver Louise offers personalized creations priced from $60 to $160 in cotton 
or straw. They're topped with anything from flora and fauna to the L.A. skyline 
or a breakfast assortment of toast, eggs and bacon made out of papier-mache. 
</P>
<P>
The breakfast hat was commissioned by Magenta (the only name she uses), the new 
owner of Millie's diner in Silver Lake. She wore it first for a guest 
appearance on "A.M. Los Angeles." The extravagant chapeau now hangs in 
Magenta's restaurant or gives her shade. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm blond and really fair, so hats are important for me. I have about 15 and 
they're all large-brimmed. It's how you learn to dress if you don't like the 
sun." 
</P>
<P>
At Bullocks Wilshire, hat buyer Russell Brock says: "We've sold more large-brim 
hats this year than we have the last five years combined. First and foremost, 
it's fashion. And of course, there's more and more being said about staying out 
of the sun. A lot of women are buying for that reason." 
</P>
<P>
Tall women were once the only customers for big-brim hats, but not anymore. 
Lack of inches doesn't keep a woman away, and some companies are making large 
hats specifically for shorter customers. Brock explains they have less brim in 
back, more in front, which tends to make the wearer look taller. 
</P>
<P>
Proximity can be a problem with wide-brim millinery, but Los Angeles designer 
Elizabeth Marcel has a solution. It's a versatile, romantic straw. "One side 
flips up so a woman can wear it to a party and be close to people." But if she 
turns it completely around, she has a full brim in front to give her sun 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
Marcel's customers are "just about anyone concerned with their complexion and 
their hair." Added to that are convertible-lovers and travelers. For open-air 
driving, Marcel suggests "the deeper the crown, the easier the hat will stay 
on." And for easy packing, she has "soft linen hats with enough brim to cover 
your nose." 
</P>
<P>
Marcel designs summer straws that look as good with a pretty sun dress as they 
do with shorts and a T-shirt or jeans. They're one-of-a-kind with prices ($90 
to $195) that reflect their uniqueness. But at Fred Segal on Melrose Avenue, 
there is a selection of millinery under $50. 
</P>
<P>
Buyer Nisa Lasker says black and natural are the two basic colors. "Some have 
little roses, some have bows." And as might be expected, her twentysomething 
customers don't seem to realize they're making an investment in their future: 
"They're only buying them for fun and fashion."

SHOW IS FINE REPAST TO THE APPETITES OF VINTAGE-CLOTHING AFICIONADOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Los Angeles may be the City of the Future, but the bulging shopping bags people 
toted away from the Vintage Clothing Exposition at the Pasadena Civic Center 
suggest that some Angelenos are carrying on a romance with the past. 
</P>
<P>
The event, produced by Vintage Expositions and sponsored by the Federation of 
Vintage Fashion, had been set in the San Francisco area for three years. But 
organizer John Maxwell said he and his partners decided to bring it to Los 
Angeles after local antique clothing dealers convinced them there is a market 
here as well. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday afternoon would not have made a totally convincing argument. Shortly 
after the doors opened at 10 a.m., the crowd seemed enthusiastic, but sparse. 
Maxwell was philosophical: "We'll get maybe 1,200 folks for both days, but this 
is our first time, and it may take a while for the word to get out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Numbers Increased 
</P>
<P>
The numbers increased considerably later in the day, in time for a 
retrospective fashion show of American and European designs staged by the 
Auxiliary of Goodwill Industries of Southern California. The clothes are from 
the auxiliary's permanent collection. 
</P>
<P>
There were a number of striking outfits in the show, none of them for sale. 
Among them, a Gatsby-esque evening sheath decorated with a hand-painted 
hibiscus, and a man's boating outfit, from the late 1800s, with a striped 
jacket in cream; malachite, cream-color slacks, and matching linen shoes. 
</P>
<P>
From Mme. Paquin, a French couturier of the early 1900s, an ornately 
embroidered coat of eggshell lace, trimmed in black silk with a black silk 
underskirt, evoked images of "Gigi" and La Belle Epoque in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Even one of Jean Harlow's gowns, in satin charmeuse with a dramatically 
plunging back, made an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the clothes had interesting sociological significance. The show's 
classic Edwardian hobble skirts came by their names honestly. They actually 
included a strut, similar to the hoop placed around a wooden barrel, that 
forced the wearer into mincing, ladylike steps. 
</P>
<P>
Several women in the audience commented on the tiny waistlines of dress 
ensembles from the mid-1800s, when the wasp waist, the bane of Scarlett 
O'Hara's existence, was the rage. 
</P>
<P>
Expo visitors and dealers had various reasons for shopping the vintage clothes 
stalls, where prices ranged from $5 to more than $3,000. Gwen Segona, a dealer 
from Sherman Oaks, freely confessed: "I'm a junkie. I have a craving for 
antique clothes." Re-selling them subsidizes her habit. 
</P>
<P>
Martina Dinale, who was trying on several of the hats Segona was selling, 
sympathized. "This is a banquet of frustration, because I'm between jobs and 
can't afford to buy anything right now." Putting aside a black straw hat, she 
sighed: "You know, to buy the equivalent of these clothes today would cost 
approximately what you'd pay for a medium-size car." 
</P>
<P>
Dealer Lauretta Wasserstein agreed. Although she seldom wears them herself, she 
admires their craftsmanship. She called the clothes works of art and turned to 
a gown by Cristobal Balenciaga, the late Paris couturier, to demonstrate. 
Inside the dress was a built-in silk brassiere to compensate for the original 
owner's modest bust. Shoulder loops held the underslip in place. And the edges 
of the gossamer, cafe-au-lait over-jacket were impeccably finished. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a cliche," Wasserstein admits. "People say it all the time, but it's 
true: They just don't make clothes like this anymore."

STYLE: HAIR TODAY, MORE TOMORROW

Movie stars have been doing it for years, but now anyone who wants longer, 
thicker locks can have extra strands sewn, tied or glued to one's own hair. 
</P>
<P>
Hair extensions are not new, but until the last few months most county 
residents were unaware of the technique to add length, body, and thickness to 
thin, damaged or scrawny hair. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just starting to grab hold in Orange County," says Alice Meyers, manager 
of the Impulse hair salon in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's expensive, so a lot of (my customers) are wealthy women who can afford 
whatever it takes to look good," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
Hair extensions, also known as hair weaving, can be done with human or 
artificial hair in a number of ways, but the most common methods are: the braid 
(or tract) technique in which extra strands of hair are sewn onto braids 
(strung across the scalp like corn rows) created from the customer's hair; the 
tying (also called pole weaving or French lacing) method in which individual 
strands are tied to the customer's hair; and the bonding method in which 
strands are glued to the customer's hair. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers says the tying method at her salon costs between $500 and $800, 
depending on how long the strands are and how many are needed. The braid method 
costs between $275 and $300 and bonding costs about $40 to $175. (All the 
stylists interviewed charge between $200 and $800 for braid or tie extensions, 
depending on length and amount of hair; bonding prices usually start around 
$40.) 
</P>
<P>
Most extensions today are done with human hair, although some salons are using 
a technique with synthetic hair called Monofibre, which is less expensive than 
real hair. All the techniques except bonding usually take several hours to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the cost in time and money, customers report happy results. 
</P>
<P>
"It's made my life wonderful," says Michelle Frenz, 18, who has been wearing 
extensions for more than a year. "I get more attention and looks from the guys. 
My hair was really short and I wanted it long and I was just getting 
impatient." 
</P>
<P>
Frenz says she has no intention of ending the extensions. "I can't think of 
anything better to spend my money on than making myself look better." 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Shapiro says she considered a wig until she heard about extensions. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it," says Shapiro, who has been a manicurist for 23 years. "It's 
marvelous because it fills up a big spot on the top of my head and I feel like 
a new person." 
</P>
<P>
Meyers says the bonding method, which is the technique chosen by Shapiro, is 
for extreme cases -- people who don't have enough hair to have strands attached 
by tying or sewing. It only lasts two to four weeks, compared to the braid 
method, which lasts about six weeks, or the tie method, which lasts about three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Customers who have had strands sewn onto a braid at the scalp must return every 
six weeks or so for what is called tightening, or adjusting the extension to 
accommodate the customer's hair growth. Most salons charge $100 to $200 for 
this. When the other two methods grow out, the extensions are redone entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Eugenie Herman of Eugenie's Hair Stylists in Santa Ana has been weaving 
extensions for eight years. She recommends the braid or tie method and tries to 
steer customers away from bonding. 
</P>
<P>
"The glue can be irritating to the scalp and if you use any heat, like from a 
blow dryer, the glue melts and the (strands) fall out," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Extensions are usually done with human hair from Italy or Indonesia, and are 
usually styled and colored before attachment, says Herman. Most of the 
extensions can be shampooed and blow dried, she adds. 
</P>
<P>
Tacy Gonzalez, a stylist at Anthony Michaels Salon in Costa Mesa, says in 
addition to women with thin hair hoping to add volume, extensions are for men 
and women who "have always wanted that long hair look but couldn't grow it." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez was taught by Beka Ledford, a stylist at Finamore's Hair Salon in 
Newport Beach, who has been doing extensions for 2 1/2 years and who says that 
extensions make up 75% of her styling business. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers says extensions allow women who have been embarrassed about thin hair to 
face life with much more confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many women who don't even want to go out into the world because 
they hardly have any hair," she says. "Wigs are great, but when you wear wigs 
every day of your life, your scalp doesn't get sunshine or oxygen and it can't 
breathe. It's like laying carpet over grass." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is as enthusiastic as Meyers, however. Although more than a dozen 
calls to area dermatologists yielded no reports of scalp or hair problems 
developing from the styling technique, some doctors said they would be leery of 
using glue near the scalp or tying the strands too tightly. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how tightly they tie these strands, but if they got too tight 
there could develop a slight hair loss," says Stephen Scheinberg, a Newport 
Beach dermatologist. "And I'm sure that a scalp problem could develop from the 
glue." 
</P>
<P>
"In my practice I haven't seen any of this, but when one uses glue, one always 
runs the risk of allergic reactions," says Gary L. Hardegen, an Anaheim 
dermatologist. 
</P>
<P>
Herman, the Santa Ana stylist, agrees that the glue can be dangerous. But she 
says problems associated with the tied extensions are minor and temporary. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people are tender-headed and they might feel some discomfort in pulling," 
she says. "But if the scalp is in normal condition, they won't feel anything. 
Even if they do, it's just a temporary condition."

SINGLE LIFE: WHO PAYS FOR A DATE? THE COST CAN BE HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The major concrete achievement of the women's movement of the 1970s was the 
Dutch treat. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nora Ephron 
</P>
<P>
On their first date, Dana was already looking forward to their second date. 
Bob, whom she had met at a party the previous weekend, was witty, attractive 
and a good conversationalist. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope he asks me out again," Dana thought, as she and Bob lingered over 
dessert. Then the bill arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's see," Bob calculated, "you owe about $22 to $25 with tip." 
</P>
<P>
Be careful what you wish for; it might come true. Bob called Dana a few nights 
later to suggest another evening out. She politely declined. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm no princess," insisted the 28-year-old Costa Mesa film editor, who asked 
that her last name not be used. "When I've been in long-term relationships, 
I've never minded paying my fair share. But it's a complete turn-off when a guy 
acts territorial about his money from Day One. It's immature and geeky." 
</P>
<P>
Melinda, 31, a marketing executive in Newport Beach, expressed ambiguity over 
the modern-day dilemma. "I'm a feminist, so in a way I feel hypocritical 
expecting a man to pay for dates," she said. "I make a good salary -- often 
more than the men I go out with do. 
</P>
<P>
"So there's always that moment of awkwardness -- on my side of the table, at 
least -- when the bill comes. I think, will it insult him if I offer to pay 
part of it? If we've run up a big tab, I usually offer to chip in. I've found 
that one not-so-awkward approach is to say, 'May I get the tip?' Or else I'll 
pay for drinks or the movie afterwards." 
</P>
<P>
Feminist or not, Melinda prefers that the magnanimous gesture be her idea, not 
his. "A few times I've been on a date where the man said, 'I'll let you buy the 
tickets since I paid for dinner.' I've had to restrain myself from gagging." 
</P>
<P>
"Money is a funny thing; it symbolizes something that goes beyond male-female 
equality," Melinda explained. "One thing I've learned over the years: a man who 
is stingy financially is also stingy emotionally. I once had a boyfriend who 
always made it clear that our relationship was Dutch treat all the way. Finally 
I caught on to the fact that giving away things -- whether they be dinners or 
commitment -- made him feel vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
"What does 'liberated' mean?" Patricia Peirce, 26, mused in a letter to Single 
Life. "Just because a woman deserves equal pay in the workplace doesn't mean 
that a woman doesn't deserve to have her dinner paid for when she is asked out 
on a date. If a man doesn't expect to pay for the date, he shouldn't ask. 
</P>
<P>
"I must admit that if a man asked me out and didn't intend to pay the bill, I 
would have a difficult time controlling judgment on his character. 
</P>
<P>
"This doesn't mean that as time passes in a relationship, splitting the bill 
would be out of the question. Nor does this mean that women shouldn't ask men 
out. By all means, ask. But be prepared to pay. This is just common courtesy 
and has nothing to do with liberation." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, the Anaheim resident, who is working on her teaching 
credential, reiterated her belief that the answer behind who pays depends on 
who invited -- even in platonic relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a longtime male friend who just assumes that, because we're only 
friends, it's always: You pay your way and I'll pay mine. It kind of bothers 
me; he's the one who asked me out. I would just as soon stay home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like people who buy things beyond their means -- if you can't afford it, 
don't buy it, and if you can't afford to take someone out, don't ask them. Or 
else make plans that don't cost any money -- like a walk on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's kind of self-centered if a man thinks he can ask you out, have 
you on his arm, take you to a nice place, take you home -- and expect you pay 
for dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Peirce admitted, however, that she can't help but feel uncomfortable when she 
sits back and watches a date pay for an expensive dinner. "I think, 'Wow, this 
is costing him a lot.' In those situations, I'll offer to pay for whatever we 
do after dinner -- a movie or drinks." 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Brown of Laguna Beach had a different perspective. "I don't go out with 
a guy unless I enjoy his company as much as he enjoys mine," the 29-year-old 
writer said. "I wouldn't expect a girlfriend to pay for my dinner just because 
she wanted to spend an evening with me, and I don't automatically expect a man 
to pay, either." 
</P>
<P>
"Then again," she noted with a laugh, "if a date insists on paying, I don't 
exactly lunge for the bill." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Brown would rather pay her own way on first dates, to alleviate her 
guilt if she decides that once is enough. "I feel like a louse if I let a guy 
treat me to an expensive dinner, then I turn him down when he asks me out 
again." 
</P>
<P>
The range of male opinions registered somewhat similar to the female mind-set. 
"There's nothing wrong with a little chivalry," said Jeff, 41, an accountant in 
Garden Grove. "I certainly would not expect a date to pay her way, or else I 
wouldn't have asked her out in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"But if she were to become my girlfriend and we went out three or four nights a 
week, it would get to be silly after a point if I continued paying for 
everything. I'd go broke." 
</P>
<P>
Robert slightly resents the fact that "liberated" women still like to be wined 
and dined. "Some women want everything to be equal, except for the restaurant 
tab," the 34-year-old Santa Ana engineer complained. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something phony about trying to impress someone by taking them to a 
fancy restaurant. It doesn't say anything about who you are just because you 
can pull out an American Express. Women who need that aren't my type, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
But Dan, 28, a real estate agent in Anaheim, views footing the bill as part of 
the dating game. "I would feel like an idiot, asking a woman to pay her half," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I simply figure the cost of dates into my budget. To meet the right person, 
you have to go through the motions."

ANN CONWAY: $300 TO BUY A DIFFERENT SCR GALA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hear the buzz? South Coast Repertory, producer of the gala that opens Orange 
County's social season, has refused to play "Can You Top This?" for this year's 
party. 
</P>
<P>
That makes sense. How could anyone one-up last year's extravaganza -- totally 
underwritten by Tiffany &amp; Co. -- with its palatial white tent, its pouf 
after pouf of ecru satin, its cloud of Tiffany fragrance waltzing across the 
marble dance floor with the likes of Paloma Picasso? 
</P>
<P>
So they're taking the gala, dubbed "Dramatic Directions," to a dramatic new 
direction -- the endless and ultramodern lobby of Fluor Daniel at Park Place in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Now before you scream "lobby?" hear out Cliff Faulkner, the resident scenic 
designer for SCR who waved his magic wand over last year's do. "We went 
strongly in one direction last year. And this year, we wanted a whole new 
direction. The lobby is enormous, so we will need to use only part of it. We'll 
divide it into absolutely adjoining spaces, with a cabaret that sits beside a 
dining atrium that is four stories high. Guests will be able to see from one 
space into the other." 
</P>
<P>
The party's theme highlights what South Coast Repertory is all about, Faulkner 
said. "SCR is leading the way in new American theater writing. Because we have 
so many play commissions that go on to other theaters across the country, we 
want to keynote that with this event. The title underlines that; the whole 
evening is a major dramatic direction." 
</P>
<P>
The gala, set for Sept. 16 with an underwriters' bash at Willa Dean and William 
Lyon's on July 13, will begin outside, Faulkner said. 
</P>
<P>
The ring of flagpoles that line the Park Place concourse will be incorporated 
into the decor theme with Air Dimensional Design creating inflated air tubes in 
brilliant colors ("red, marigold yellow, teal green and purple, accented with 
black and silver," Faulkner said) that will begin outside and continue through 
the lobby. Huge white paper sculptures, the cutting edge in gala decor, will 
provide the bandstand backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we were looking for formal elegance," Faulkner said. "This year, 
we're going for dynamic sophistication, something avant-garde, something very 
contemporary." 
</P>
<P>
The price tag will remain the same -- $300 per person. Willa Dean Lyon is gala 
chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
The buzz too: They're still buzzing about heiress Joan Irvine Smith's private 
party on Sunday at the Oaks Classic in San Juan Capistrano. Not the people who 
were invited to the lush VIP bash that Smith stages under a blocklong, 
scalloped white canopy. The people who weren't. 
</P>
<P>
How can they get invited next year? "You don't have to be somebody," Smith 
says. "We just invite people we know, just friends. We don't have people get 
invited to this party. If they want to be here, they can buy a ticket, sit at a 
table and see the horses. But they're not going to sit under the tent. If 
you're not on the list, you're not invited. And you don't get in if you come 
and ask." 
</P>
<P>
Gala tickets for sale: "Help," says Kate Lund. "I have four Orange Blossom Ball 
tickets at $275 each for sale!" Lund is worried. Very worried. Lund is going to 
marry Jim Hix on July 8. And, when they bought their table for $2,750 (10 
tickets) for Saturday night's ball at the Irvine Hilton, they thought the ball 
was going to be in July. "We thought last year's ball was in July," Lund says. 
"All of these payments are coming due at the same time!" 
</P>
<P>
The couple will use three tickets. "One for Jim, one for me, and one for my 
daughter," Lund says. And Hix, a deputy district attorney from El Toro, has 
sold three. "That leaves four," Lund says. "Next year, if we buy a table, we'll 
start selling tickets in January. The ball is Jim's favorite charity. He buys a 
ticket every year. But this is the first time he has bought a table." 
</P>
<P>
On consignment: Harry Bubb, CEO of Pacific Mutual, has donated a few dozen 
Steuben glasses to On Consignment, the Newport Harbor Art Museum shop that 
opens at its Costa Mesa locale with a party on Sunday. The rare wine and 
highball glasses were once used in Pacific Mutual's executive offices. Also up 
for sale at the new fund-raising boutique: a rosewood piano, circa 1800, with a 
$1,800 price tag; and a Ching Dynasty vase selling for $9,000. For the lover of 
reasonably priced one-of-a-kinds, a single bookend is on sale for $7.50. The 
shop also features quality linens, silver, and contemporary and antique 
accessories. Shop hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p. m. Tuesday through Saturday.

NEW POLICY LETS COUNTY REJECT PROJECTS THAT WOULD BURDEN SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a major victory for school districts struggling to absorb skyrocketing 
enrollments, the Los Angeles County counsel said Thursday that the Board of 
Supervisors has the power to reject residential developments if the projects 
will overburden crowded school systems. 
</P>
<P>
The opinion by County Counsel DeWitt W. Clinton reversed a county policy which 
held that the board could not consider the potential impact on schools when 
judging a proposed development's application for a zone change. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy in effect gives school district officials the power to negotiate 
with developers, granting approval to new construction in return for land, 
money or other aid. 
</P>
<P>
School officials hailed Clinton's opinion, but builders said it would delay or 
kill their projects and would unjustly force developers to shoulder more 
responsibility for building new schools in rapidly growing parts of the county, 
especially the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
To curry the favor of school districts, developers may have to scale back 
projects, donate land for school sites or pay higher fees, said Don V. Collin, 
legal counsel to the California Building Industry Assn. in Sacramento. "The 
blackmail system is beginning to work," he said, referring to the power of 
school officials to extract concessions from builders. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich predicted that the opinion would open "floodgates of 
litigation" between schools and developers. He also said a change in the 
board's policy could force developers to pay more for schools than required 
under a state school financing law. 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Ed Edelman told the other supervisors at their meeting Thursday 
that it is clear the board and the Regional Planning Commission will have to 
reassess the criteria they use to weigh development proposals. "We're in a new 
era, gentlemen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman said the board will take the opinion into account, although it may not 
always side with districts opposing developments. Depending on the case, he 
said, the supervisors may back the demands of school officials or determine 
that a new housing project would not unreasonably burden a district. 
</P>
<P>
County attorneys based the opinion on a ruling by the Court of Appeal in San 
Diego last November that upheld the San Diego City Council's denial of a zoning 
change for a housing tract proposed by Mira Development Corp. The appellate 
court issued a narrow ruling that applied only to projects requiring zone 
changes and plan amendments. 
</P>
<P>
Until Thursday, the precedent set by the Mira decision had not been felt 
because no school district had attempted to use it as an argument against 
approval of a development, Collin said. 
</P>
<P>
But at Thursday's board meeting, zone changes and plan amendments were proposed 
that would allow two developers to build 517 houses and condominiums in 
Castaic. The Castaic Union School District and William S. Hart Union High 
School District opposed the developments and cited the Mira decision, saying 
the developments would funnel hundreds of students into two already crowded 
school systems. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Jacob, a past president of the California School Boards Assn., called 
Thursday's action by the Los Angeles County government significant because 
other cities and counties may be influenced by the state's most populous 
county. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision Was Delayed 
</P>
<P>
A decision on the two developments had been delayed until the county counsel 
could review the Mira decision. At Antonovich's urging, the two developers will 
meet with officials of the two school districts to negotiate solutions to the 
districts' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth B. Bley, an attorney for Valencia Co., said the school districts would 
have an unfair advantage in the negotiations. The company hopes to build 191 
houses and 300 condominiums in Castaic. "You're allowing the school districts 
to make an offer the developers cannot refuse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Clyde Smyth, superintendent of the Hart district, said school officials 
would not take advantage of developers. "I don't think the developers should 
have to handle the whole problem," Smyth said. "I don't think that's right." 
</P>
<P>
Jacob, who chairs a school financing committee for the California school board 
group, praised the Mira decision but feared its impact would be short lived. 
The decision relied on a provision in a 1987 state law that requires developers 
to pay school districts $1.56 for every square foot of new residential 
construction they build. 
</P>
<P>
The aim of the state law, she said, was to establish specific developer 
contributions for building new schools. Since the Mira decision could force 
developers to pay more than those fees, it goes against the spirit of the law, 
Jacob said. She predicted builders would push for legislation to eliminate the 
provision that produced the Mira decision. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County counsel's opinion marks a change of fortune for the 
Castaic and Hart districts. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1987, the two districts joined three other Santa Clarita Valley school 
systems in proposing a special tax on new construction, averaging $6,300 a 
unit, to build schools. Voters overwhelmingly approved the tax, but in February 
the state Supreme Court let stand a Court of Appeal ruling that declared the 
tax unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Now the county counsel's opinion has opened the door to the possibility that 
the Santa Clarita districts could reap benefits comparable, if not better, than 
those declared illegal by the appellate court.

DRIVING AWAY EVIL SPIRITS IS ALL IN A DAY'S WORK FOR PSYCHOTHERAPIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Votive candles flicker in red and yellow jars on a makeshift altar of wood and 
cinder blocks. A gnarled piece of incense burns in the hollowed head of a 
ceramic Aztec god -- spewing curls of black smoke into the windowless room. In 
hushed tones, a fatherly healer recites prayers before the altar's crucifixes 
while the emotionally tortured woman at his side drinks three times from a 
goblet of rainwater. When the ritual is over, leaves from a California pepper 
tree litter the floor and the woman seems at peace. 
</P>
<P>
On the bus ride to her therapist, Maria was panicky. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, had begun feeling dangerously 
out of control after her baby girl started crying. Once, when she lost control, 
she threw a pot of boiling water at her husband and ended up in a mental ward. 
This time, the shy soft-spoken woman walked into the Norwalk office of 
psychotherapist Ignacio Aguilar expecting help from the Old World cures that 
abound in the Mexican countryside, not from the theories of Sigmund Freud. 
</P>
<P>
That's exactly what she got. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar has all his professional credentials hanging on his office wall: a 
framed master's degree in social work from USC and a certified therapist 
license from the state of California. Beyond these pieces of paper are 17 years 
of experience working as a psychotherapist at Metropolitan State Hospital in 
Norwalk where he has counseled hundreds of mentally disturbed patients. 
</P>
<P>
But in his practice, Aguilar, 63, also has borrowed methods from Indian pueblos 
in New Mexico, Tijuana herb shops and village wise men in outposts throughout 
Mexico. The Mexico City native considers himself a folk healer with a 
repertoire of "mystical approaches." He is among a handful of licensed 
therapists in Los Angeles County who turn to ancient rituals of the Hispanic 
culture when traditional therapy fails to make headway with a patient. 
</P>
<P>
For Maria, who visited Aguilar's office recently, there seemed to be little 
that would help her aside from her faith. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to raise three girls, the 35-year-old Mexican immigrant was coping with 
an abusive husband and a neighbor she suspected was trying to harm her. Aguilar 
had been providing her conventional counseling. But she wanted a spiritual 
cleansing to drive out evil spirits after she had lost an amulet, which she 
believed protected her from harm. 
</P>
<P>
The candles were glowing when she quietly entered Aguilar's office and was 
directed to kneel before the altar. After both prayed quietly, Aguilar massaged 
her temples, neck and arms -- making the woman seem as limp as ribbon. Then, he 
abruptly shook her as if to awaken her from a trance and let her sip from a 
goblet of rainwater "from the heavens." He splattered drops of the liquid on 
her head and body. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Religious Connection 
</P>
<P>
Next, the therapist took the branch of a California pepper tree and began 
vigorously brushing the woman with its shiny leaves -- releasing the scent of 
pepper in the room. This tree is used because it is thought that Christ's 
crucifix was fashioned from one. More prayers were interrupted by the blowing 
of a large conch shell into the woman's ears. 
</P>
<P>
Maria snuffed out the bowl of incense with a note pad and peered at the black 
image left behind on the paper. "It looks like a dove," she said. The good 
symbol, Aguilar told her, meant that the evil spirit had been banished. 
</P>
<P>
The woman looked radiant. "My mind is not cluttered anymore about these ideas," 
she said smiling. "I feel fine." 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar said he began practicing folk medicine in the mid-1970s at Metropolitan 
State to fill a void in treatment for those unable to benefit from 
Western-style medicine. "When I first started doing it, it was very difficult 
for me. I really had to force myself to do it." But he added, "The important 
thing is not whether I believe, the important thing is that the patient 
believes." 
</P>
<P>
Newly arrived Latino immigrants from the countryside are the usual candidates 
for the unorthodox treatments, according to a number of mental health 
professionals. Often they blame their mental illness on evil spirits and spurn 
suggestions that their problems might come from within, these experts say. A 
wife might believe a witch placed a hex on her to drive off her husband. 
Seizures could be explained as the wrath of God. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Specialty Shops 
</P>
<P>
Usually, these people might seek out a neighborhood folk healer called a 
curandero or find one at a botanica shop, where amulets, herbs, feathers, 
candles and statues of saints are sold. Once primarily confined to East Los 
Angeles, botanicas are sprouting up rapidly across Los Angeles' 
Spanish-speaking neighborhoods -- a few even advertising in the Yellow Pages. 
</P>
<P>
Curanderos, who have traditionally operated in the shadows, also are getting 
bolder. In downtown Los Angeles this week, several people on Broadway were 
distributing calling cards for curanderos that boasted of being able to cure 
headaches, alcoholism, nervous disorders, and mal de ojo, or evil eye. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether we like it or not, these people are bringing with them this kind of 
belief," Aguilar said. "There are many places in the community that are 
practicing this non-traditional medicine, but it lends itself to a great deal 
of quackery and exploitation." 
</P>
<P>
Even the administration at Metropolitan State proved to be disbelievers. 
Several years ago, hospital officials told Aguilar he could no longer conduct 
his controversial rituals on the hospital grounds. He still works at Metro, but 
he also maintains a private office a few blocks away where he practices his 
more unconventional therapies. 
</P>
<P>
Others who counsel Latinos don't go quite as far as Aguilar, but they applaud 
his work and occasionally send him patients for folk healing. Like Aguilar, 
many said they attempt to honor the spiritualism of their Latino patients and 
believe folk medicine is healthy because it bolsters a person's ties to his 
native culture. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not utilize it if it connects them with strengths in their past?" asked 
Jerry Tello, a Los Angeles therapist, who keeps a picture of Our Lady of 
Guadalupe and other cultural symbols in his office. If pressed, he will perform 
a ritual cleansing if the client promises to explore through therapy why he or 
she is feeling poorly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traditional Practice 
</P>
<P>
The number of people who need the services of a faith healer is small, most 
therapists say. Latinos traditionally seek help from family and friends, 
physicians or their church if they are troubled. Yet, it is generally agreed 
that many Latinos loathe seeking help from a therapist because of the stigma 
attached to mental illness. Some mental health professionals who have made 
referrals to folk healers can recite stories of surprising results. 
</P>
<P>
When therapists "come across someone who believes strongly in folk healers or 
curanderos, it should be the responsibility of the mental health practitioner 
to refer them to a folk healer," said Armando Morales, a professor at UCLA's 
Neuropsychiatric Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Morales once resorted to a Tijuana curandero when he failed to help a patient 
who was experiencing hysterical seizures. The folk healer spread a large amount 
of garlic on the woman's body and the seizures vanished. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's what they believe, you have to work within the cultural limits of 
people's belief system to help them," agreed Vangie Montalvo, a bilingual Los 
Angeles County mental health worker. "You can tell them they will get better 
with medication or therapy, but if they don't believe it . . . that's a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Montalvo sought Aguilar's help for a 19-year-old woman whose 
protective Latino family was rejecting traditional treatment. The woman heard 
voices and her family was frightened by the way her body would twist 
uncontrollably in grotesque ways. The family, who believed the mother's 
co-worker had placed a curse through black magic, took the woman to Aguilar 
after priests refused to perform an exorcism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Improvement Told 
</P>
<P>
After a limpia, or spiritual cleansing, intended to dispel evil spirits, the 
patient improved and the family became more receptive to traditional 
therapeutic advice, Montalvo said. 
</P>
<P>
The cures sometimes seem magical, but experts say the explanation is mundane. 
While the dimensions of the human brain remain largely uncharted, the power of 
faith appears to have tremendous curative value. If a person believes that an 
amulet will help, it just might. If somebody thinks it's hogwash, the amulet 
might as well be a lump of coal. 
</P>
<P>
"Trust . . . is a very important part of the recovery process. If someone 
believes in faith healing, that it will be helpful, it probably will," said 
Arturo Fierro, a Montebello clinical psychologist with a predominantly Latino 
clientele.

OUTSIDE AUDIT OF METRO RAIL COST ORDERED BY RTD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS SAHAGUN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scalded by a federal report warning of potential cost overruns, the head of the 
Southern California Rapid Transit District on Thursday ordered independent 
audits of the Metro Rail project. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, auditors for the U.S. Office of the Inspector General met 
with Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) and Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) to 
share concerns that the initial 4.4-mile segment of the Metro Rail Red Line 
subway system was behind schedule and could possibly run out of money, Katz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are very distressed about organization, and they told me they were 
concerned about a lack of accountability," Katz said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
"They said the project was already delayed by a year and a half," Katz said, 
and expressed concern that it could slip even further. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Phase 
</P>
<P>
Project officials have spent half of the $1.25 billion earmarked for the first 
phase of Metro Rail -- running from Union Station through downtown to MacArthur 
Park -- which is only one-third completed and 18 months behind schedule, 
transit authorities said. The delays have also been responsible for increased 
costs of the system, half of which is being funded by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
But RTD General Manager Alan Pegg, in a report to the transit district's board 
of directors, said he expects the project to meet its revised completion date 
of September, 1993, and that much of the money spent so far has been used to 
purchase land. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that anybody in the eighth grade can tell you that if you are going 
to build something, you must first buy the land," Pegg added. "Buying the land 
does not dig a tunnel or put down any bricks or mortar." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the people from the Office of the Inspector General have a much better 
education than eighth grade," argued Robbins, who has authored a bill to 
reorganize the transit district. "When these auditors tell you the money is 50% 
gone and the work is 32% done, you have to ask why." 
</P>
<P>
The auditors could not be reached for comment. But Pegg angrily admonished them 
for failing to reveal their findings to his agency before going to state 
legislators. 
</P>
<P>
"I must report to you that there has been no discussion of those audit findings 
with this district prior to that discussion with state legislators," Pegg said. 
"I consider such an approach extremely unprofessional conduct." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disturbing Trends 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he acknowledged that his own review of cost reports on the Metro 
Rail project showed "disturbing cost trends," including escalating real estate 
costs, which indicate that "we have a signal by which to take appropriate 
management action to ensure that we get the lowest possible cost on the project 
for the taxpayers of Los Angeles County." 
</P>
<P>
Enshrouded by what he called "an air of controversy," Pegg called for separate 
independent audits to reasses projections of the overall cost of the project 
and to establish what the district's cost will be to resolve more than 750 
unsettled contractors' claims and contract change orders valued at $49.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Such audits would allay concerns that the district may have to dip into its 
steadily shrinking contingency fund, set aside for unforeseen expenses, to 
settle the claims, Pegg said. 
</P>
<P>
Since February, the contingency margin has shrunk from $66 million to $23 
million, transit district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
While the contingency margin is less than half the total amount of unresolved 
claims, Pegg told reporters at a news conference Thursday that historically, 
claims have been settled for less than the full amount and some are withdrawn 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
"The project costs review will help determine if it will be necessary to use 
money from this account," Pegg said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question Posed 
</P>
<P>
What if the transit district's own audits suggest a dramatic cost overrun? 
</P>
<P>
"We fully expect the auditors to agree with our findings," said Greg Davy, an 
RTD spokesman. "However, if there were any differences of opinion, we would sit 
down with them and see what their concerns were."

ANGEL'S FLIGHT BACK ON TRACK AFTER A REDESIGN JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angel's Flight, the city's late, lamented 325-foot-long incline railway, is 
closer than ever to climbing up and down Bunker Hill once again, thanks to a 
decision Thursday by the Cultural Affairs Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The revival of Angel's Flight, which opened in 1901 and made its last nickel 
trip up the hill at 3rd Street in 1968, has been closely tied to the fate of 
California Plaza, an 11-acre commercial redevelopment project atop Bunker Hill 
that ran afoul of the Cultural Affairs Commission earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
When it is completed, the California Plaza complex will span Olive Street 
between 3rd and 4th streets. Buildings on both sides of Olive will be connected 
by a vast bridge that will support shops, restaurants and an outdoor 
amphitheater as well as serving as the uphill terminus for Angel's Flight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bridge Redesigned 
</P>
<P>
Commission members had objected to the design of the bridge, fearing it would 
turn Olive Street below into a dreary, unsafe 300-foot-long tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Bunker Hill Associates, developers of California Plaza, came back 
to the commission with a design that would leave more of Olive Street open to 
the light and would adorn the unlighted portion with neon sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also wanted Angel's Flight to end at a point high enough to be 
seen from surrounding streets. The developers responded with a design that 
raises the upper terminal from an elevation of 370 feet to 385. 
</P>
<P>
The scheme, approved unanimously by the commission, now goes to the city's 
Community Redevelopment Agency. If approved by the CRA, as expected, work on 
the next phase of California Plaza, the second of three office towers, can 
begin. The first stage includes an office tower between Olive and Grand and the 
Museum of Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
The third phase will incorporate Angel's Flight along with the third tower and 
is not expected to be completed before the mid-1990s. Officials of the CRA last 
year estimated the cost of rebuilding Angel's Flight at a minimum of $2 
million. The cost will be shared by the CRA and the developer, who will be 
responsible for constructing the railbed and operating the railway. 
</P>
<P>
It won't be the same old Angel's Flight, but close enough, officials promise. 
</P>
<P>
The rebuilt version will travel up and down Bunker Hill about half a block 
south of the original route alongside 3rd Street. The grade will be about the 
same -- a 33-degree ascent -- and the length of the journey will be about the 
same as the original. The uphill route will start on the west side of Hill 
Street across from the Grand Central Market and adjacent to the Angelus Plaza 
senior citizen housing project. 
</P>
<P>
The two cars will look like the orange-and-black wooden originals, although the 
new ones probably won't be made of wood. The originals, dubbed Olivet and 
Sinai, are to be restored and displayed, one at a planned Angel's Flight Museum 
at California Plaza and the other at Heritage Square, a Victorian Village north 
of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
And, just like the old days, it will cost you to ride Angel's Flight. No doubt 
more than a nickel, although CRA officials are talking about "a nominal fare."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW PLAN OFFERED ON PAN PACIFIC SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opponents of commercial development of the fire-gutted Pan Pacific Auditorium 
said Thursday they want to see the building's streamlined front facade moved so 
that it faces Beverly Boulevard and becomes a gateway to Pan Pacific Park on 
the Westside. The rest of the site should be converted to parkland, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"We support public uses for Pan Pacific Park. We do not support it as cheap 
land for yet another movie complex," said Laura Lake, president of Friends of 
Westwood, a slow-growth group. 
</P>
<P>
She said her organization and other groups will urge county Supervisor Ed 
Edelman to reject a proposal to rebuild the 54-year-old auditorium and use it 
for an ice skating rink, movie theaters and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"We are of the belief that the developer is trying to resurrect a commercial 
development project that is dead at this point in time," said Diana Plotkin, 
president of the Beverly Wilshire Homes Assn. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for developer Joseph Kornwasser said earlier this week that the 
project could be completed in two years despite the damage caused by the May 24 
fire.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REPUTED MOB FIGURE LOSES COURT APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal appeals court Thursday upheld the conviction of Salvatore Pisello, a 
reputed organized crime figure convicted of failing to pay taxes on more than 
$300,000 he earned from a series of business deals with MCA Records and Sugar 
Hill Records. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in Los Angeles said the evidence 
justified the conviction on two counts of tax evasion and also concluded that 
Pisello had not been unfairly required to prove his contention that the money 
had been a loan. 
</P>
<P>
The court split 2 to 1, however, in deciding that prosecutors were not required 
to give to the defense their handwritten notes from interviews with prospective 
witnesses in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The court majority, in a written opinion by Judge Joseph T. Sneed, said the 
typed memos prepared from the notes were sufficient notice to the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Pisello, who has denied any connections to organized crime, was sentenced to 
four years in prison but has remained free pending the outcome of the appeal.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GIRL SHOT BY FATHER AS HE CLEANS GUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 1-year-old girl was shot and wounded Thursday in what her father told police 
was an accident that occurred as he was cleaning his gun, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl's injuries were not considered serious, but she was taken to 
County-USC Medical Center with a number of small pellet wounds to the right 
side of her neck, jaw and shoulder, Detective John Munguia said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred shortly before noon in an apartment at 325 W. Avenue 38 
in the Montecito Heights area, Munguia said. 
</P>
<P>
The father told police that he was sitting on a couch with his daughter about 
an arm's length away as he cleaned a six-shot chrome-plated revolver, Munguia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The weapon was loaded with bullets containing pellets called snake shot, 
Munguia said. 
</P>
<P>
As he was cleaning the gun, it accidentally went off, wounding the child, the 
father told police. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the man and his daughter were not released.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WASP ATTACK FORCES FIREFIGHTERS TO FLEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Firefighters burning underbrush were attacked Thursday by a swarm of wasps and 
stung so badly they had to leave the job. 
</P>
<P>
A second crew was sent to continue the controlled burn near Stone Canyon 
Reservoir in the foothills above Bel-Air after the 9:30 a.m. incident, said 
city fire spokesman Jim Wells. 
</P>
<P>
"They were stung by yellow jackets -- apparently they encountered a hive or 
something," Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
Three firefighters on a five-member crew were stung from two to six times each 
on the hands, legs, face and neck, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't unusual to be attacked by bees or wasps when a hive or nest is 
disturbed in the brush, Wells said.

WEATHERMAN THROWS A LITTLE LIGHT ON JUNE-GLOOM THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Weather-conscious Southern Californians have grown to expect gloom in the 
morning and gloom at night near the coast in June. That's exactly what they've 
been getting lately, but this weekend, the sun is expected to break through. 
</P>
<P>
"We will still have some low clouds and fog in the morning, but by afternoon 
Friday, Saturday and Sunday, there should be lots of sunshine for coastal 
areas," said meteorologist Dan Bowman of WeatherData Inc., which provides 
forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, those heading inland should encounter what "looks like great 
weather," with a bit of wind in the afternoons and temperatures near 100 in 
desert areas. Highs in downtown Los Angeles are expected to be in the 70s 
through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The predicted improvement in the June-gloom pattern, Bowman said, is because a 
cool upper-level low-pressure area 500 to 600 miles northeast of Los Angeles 
will move east, making way for the influence of a weak high-pressure area 
eroding the deep marine layer along the Southern California coast. The result 
will be sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
The rim of overcast clouds, about 3,500 feet deep Thursday -- brought record 
rainfall to San Diego's Lindbergh Field. The new record of 0.05 of an inch 
broke the old mark of 0.03 of an inch for June 8, set in 1878. The weatherman 
thought that was rather funny.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: MONEY MARATHON TAKING ITS TOLL ON PBS PRODUCERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You're an independent producer with a terrific idea for a public TV program or 
series. 
</P>
<P>
You submit your proposal to PBS. 
</P>
<P>
PBS loves it. 
</P>
<P>
PBS agrees to put it on the air. 
</P>
<P>
One catch: This brilliant project of yours, the one that will bring you fame, 
praise and creative fulfillment? You have to raise the money to make it. 
</P>
<P>
Why? This is not rich commercial TV, which underwrites the budgets of projects 
that get approved. This is the cockeyed, cash-poor world of public TV, where 
the primary burden of fund-raising is almost always on the producer. 
</P>
<P>
"It builds strong minds and strong bodies," Gail Christian, PBS director of 
news and special projects, said from her Washington office. 
</P>
<P>
It also builds frustration. That's true whether the person knocking on doors 
for money is an obscure neophyte or a name producer with a glittering 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
Ask acclaimed documentarian Frederick Wiseman, who has publicly complained how 
hard it is to get even his programs on PBS because of money problems. 
</P>
<P>
Ask journalist-film maker Stanley Karnow, who says that about half the seven 
years he spent on his celebrated PBS series "Vietnam: A Television History" 
went to fund-raising and that he and executive producer Drew Pearson spent two 
years seeking money to finance their fine documentary, "The U.S. and the 
Philippines: In Our Image," which aired recently on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
How many others will have "the stamina to attempt such ventures?" Karnow 
wonders. 
</P>
<P>
"Pearson and I made the sacrifice for a variety of reasons," he said recently. 
"But will talented young film makers do the same? I doubt it. Indeed, I'm not 
sure I want to run another PBS marathon." 
</P>
<P>
Still on his first lap is Jonathan Kwitny, former ace investigative reporter 
for the Wall Street Journal, who is out stumping for dollars to save "The 
Kwitny Report," his refreshingly bold and hard-edged weekly half hour (2:30 
p.m. Saturdays on KCET Channel 28) that is unlike any other program on TV. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that -- perhaps even because of that -- it's in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"The Kwitny Report" will leave the national PBS network after June 17 (but it 
will continue on Channel 28, where it began this year on a 13-week delay), a 
casualty of cancellation by its PBS sponsoring station. After airing and 
underwriting "The Kwitny Report" for three years, New York public TV station 
WNYC recently decided to bow out. 
</P>
<P>
That decision jeopardizes a series termed "exemplary" by Christian. 
</P>
<P>
"What's particularly valuable about Kwitny is the investigative nature of the 
program," the PBS executive said. "We have discussion and analysis programs, 
but we don't have another program that tries to break a story." 
</P>
<P>
"The Kwitny Report" usually opens with a videotape package that is followed by 
a panel discussion. It is unslick, unscrubbed and inelegant, reflecting its 
small budget and Kwitny's inexperience in front of the camera. There are bumps 
here that need smoothing. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the program's cheekiness, relentlessly probing and off-center point of view 
(Kwitny always includes opinions rebutting his own, however) more than overcome 
its shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
Kwitny, who left the Wall Street Journal in 1986 after 17 years, aims to report 
significant stories "not reported or misreported by the general press," he said 
in Los Angeles, where he had come in search of funding. "There are occasions 
when the accepted wisdom handed down by the government and corporations is 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
"The Kwitny Report" has a non-Establishment, generally left-of-center point of 
view (further separating it from the overwhelming bulk of TV's public-affairs 
programs), but is hardly doctrinaire -- witness its two-parter noting the 
failure of communism in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
His series is not neutral, Kwitny acknowledges. "But we are balanced and we are 
fair," he said. "Whichever shoe fits, we'll wear it." 
</P>
<P>
"Whichever shoe fits," however, may be a hard sell to potential investors, 
especially in a general broadcast environment where safe and familiar are 
valued over the daring and unconventional. 
</P>
<P>
It's a system that breeds conservatism. "You will not get any money from 
someone unless he has some vested interest in giving you money," said Karnow, 
who added that he and Pearson are still $140,000 in debt from their Philippines 
series. 
</P>
<P>
"Corporations will say, 'Why should we fund something that's controversial when 
we can give money to fund the ballet on public television and show everybody 
how great we are?' " 
</P>
<P>
Why did WNYC discard "The Kwitny Report"? 
</P>
<P>
Budgetary reasons, says Chloe Aaron, the station's recently arrived vice 
president of television. 
</P>
<P>
Political reasons, says Kwitny, who accuses Aaron of "hostile reaction . . . to 
the content of the series" -- and to two episodes in particular. 
</P>
<P>
One of these attributed terrorism to Jonas Savimbi, leader of the U.S.-backed 
rebel movement in Angola and "one more blood-stained autocrat on the U.S. 
taxpayers' payroll," Kwitny charged in his introduction. 
</P>
<P>
The other episode in question charged the Reagan Administration with 
undermining grand jury and congressional probes of alleged drug and drug 
smuggling by U.S.-supported Contras fighting the Sandinista government in 
Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, "The Kwitny Report" is not "The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour." 
</P>
<P>
To those who believe that public TV should be always steady and predictable, 
"The Kwitny Report" is a horrifyingly ugly and disruptive intruder. To those 
who believe that public TV's mandate is to include alternative programs that 
challenge viewers and clear their sinuses, "The Kwitny Report" is invigorating 
and deserves permanence. 
</P>
<P>
So much so that PBS, which rarely provides funds for non-prime-time 
programming, is itself "discussing" giving Kwitny $100,000, Christian said. "We 
hope to have 'The Kwitny Report' back on the air before the end of the year," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Even that, along with the $75,000 salary that Kwitny says WNYC must still pay 
him under his contract, would hardly match his proposed $690,000 budget for a 
season's worth of programs (WNYC has estimated the cost to be even higher, at 
more than $1 million). 
</P>
<P>
In the ungrand tradition of public TV, therefore, Kwitny is hitting the bricks 
himself, hoping for a single underwriter, but more realistically seeking 
increments of $20,000 from many sources. "I've got two already," he said. "And 
some others have said they're very interested." 
</P>
<P>
Christian has promised Kwitny that his series will join "Washington Week in 
Review" and "Wall Street Week" as a PBS mainstay, "if you remain in the 
schedule." That is to say, if he collects enough money to remain in the 
schedule.

BROKAW, KOPPEL WILL REPORT FROM BEIJING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
NBC News, which on Monday said Garrick Utley was going to Beijing, then changed 
its mind Tuesday even as he was en route to the airport, said Thursday that 
anchorman Tom Brokaw is going there now. 
</P>
<P>
Brokaw is expected to start reporting from Beijing today, perhaps as early as 
this morning's "Today" show. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ABC said "Nightline" anchor Ted Koppel also is flying to Beijing 
"sometime this weekend" to work on a "Koppel Report" special -- no air date has 
been set -- examining the crisis in China and how it developed. 
</P>
<P>
While there, an ABC spokeswoman said, Koppel also will file reports for "World 
News Tonight," "World News This Morning" and probably "Nightline." He may start 
filing reports as early as Monday, depending on when he arrives in Beijing, the 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
"NBC Nightly News" anchor Brokaw has been to China six times, the last time in 
1987, was to arrive in Beijing late Thursday to join NBC's staff there in 
reporting the fast-changing developments. 
</P>
<P>
He is the first network anchor to make the trip since last month, when CBS 
anchor Dan Rather and CNN anchor Bernard Shaw were in Beijing and helped cover 
the massive student demonstrations that were bloodily crushed by Chinese army 
troops last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Like all other correspondents in Beijing, Brokaw will be able to file his live 
reports by telephone only. All live and taped video transmissions from Beijing 
have been banned since May 22. 
</P>
<P>
Plans to send Brokaw had been kept secret, spokeswoman Peggy Hubble said, 
because NBC didn't want to draw attention to the anchorman -- and possibly 
jeopardize his trip -- until he arrived in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
She said Utley hadn't been able to get a visa from the Chinese consulate here, 
so NBC News president Michael Gartner and executive news director Donald Browne 
decided to send Brokaw, who had a still-current entry visa. 
</P>
<P>
He had gotten the visa last month, she said, when NBC was thinking of sending 
him to cover Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's China visit last month. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief interview Wednesday, Utley said that before NBC recalled him while 
he was en route to Kennedy Airport, he had anticipated no problem in getting a 
visa to China once he arrived in Hong Kong, where other China-bound 
correspondents have been able to get the document despite the uncertainty of 
the situation in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Utley now will be anchoring the "NBC Nightly News" while Brokaw is in Beijing, 
Hubble said. Utley also anchors "Sunday Today" and "Meet the Press."

CD CORNER: BEST OF BENTON, THE IMPRESSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brook Benton and the Impressions -- two of the most stylish though frequently 
under-rated entries in '60s R &amp; B -- are spotlighted in new budget CD 
"greatest hits" collections. 
</P>
<P>
Benton, son of a South Carolina minister, was still a teen-ager when he began 
singing with gospel groups in the late '40s, but he eventually moved to secular 
music and scored a massive pop and R &amp; B hit in 1959 with the ballad, "It's 
Just a Matter of Time." 
</P>
<P>
Though Benton also slipped into country-tinged novelties ("The Boll Weevil 
Song") and a touch of blues ("Lie to Me"), he remains best known for the 
smooth, Nat Cole-modeled mixture of graceful, almost understated vocals and 
lush string arrangements that was showcased on his initial hit. 
</P>
<P>
The material featured on PolyGram's "Brook Benton/Forty Greatest Hits," a 
two-disc, 115-minute collection, ranges from such solo numbers as "So Many 
Ways" and "Rainy Night in Georgia" to two duets with Dinah Washington, "Baby 
(You've Got What It Takes)" and "A Rockin' Good Way." 
</P>
<P>
Like Benton, Curtis Mayfield, the falsetto-prone leader of the Impressions 
vocal group, began in gospel music and tended to sing in a somewhat smooth and 
restrained manner. Mayfield, however, has been a more influential figure 
because there was a stirring, socially conscious undercurrent in many of his 
most affecting compositions, including "Keep on Pushing" and "People Get 
Ready." 
</P>
<P>
"The Impressions' Greatest Hits" is a single, 31-minute disc from MCA that 
showcases the trio's marvelous harmony and the best-known tunes. Equally 
essential, however, is Mayfield's post-Impressions solo work (notably the 1972 
"Superfly" sound track), none of which has yet to surface on CD.

KQLZ-FM 'PIRATE RADIO' CAPTURES NO. 3 SPOT IN L.A. RATINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KQLZ-FM "Pirate Radio," the aggressive station that swashbuckled its way into 
the Los Angeles marketplace less than three months ago amid a major advertising 
blitz, has rocketed to No. 3 in the ratings, according to an audience 
measurement company. 
</P>
<P>
The Birch Radio Survey reported that KQLZ-FM (100.3) -- known for playing a 
broad range of rock music and few commercials -- has climbed from No. 14 to No. 
3 since the station debuted March 17, nearly quadrupling its share of the 
listening audience. 
</P>
<P>
Birch data shows that the station's average quarter-hour share of listeners 12 
and older was 5.9% during April and May, compared to 1.5% during February and 
March -- most of which time the station was operating as easy-listening KIQQ. 
</P>
<P>
The April-May showing by KQLZ trailed only KPWR-FM (105.9) -- or Power 106 -- 
with 8.3% of the audience, and KIIS-FM (102.7) with 6.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Birch is one of two radio ratings services. The quarterly figures of the 
better-known service, Arbitron, will not be available until mid-July. The two 
ratings services employ different methods. Birch conducts telephone surveys and 
asks people to recall what stations they have listened to over the last 24 
hours, while Arbitron bases its data on information recorded by listeners in a 
personal diary over a seven-day period. 
</P>
<P>
KQLZ plays what program director and morning deejay Scott Shannon calls 
"free-form Top 40." Listeners are as likely to hear New Wave fare such as XTC 
or Fine Young Cannibals as they are hard rock bands such as Guns N' Roses or 
Motley Crue. Classic rockers like Led Zeppelin, Peter Gabriel or Bruce 
Springsteen are also on the playlist, as are dance music rapsters like Tone 
Loc. 
</P>
<P>
"We play oldies, we play newies. . . . It's an off-the-wall concept that tries 
to fit together several different types of music on one radio station and still 
maintain a level of familiarity so the station will be a success in the 
marketplace," said Shannon, who is also a vice president at Westwood One, which 
bought the station from Outlet Communications for $56 million. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of advertising clutter is what has attracted the most attention to 
"Pirate Radio." For the first 10 days, the station broadcast music free of any 
commercial interruptions, and still features significantly fewer commercials 
than other rock stations. Also kept to a minimum is "deejay yakking," as 
Shannon calls it, with his own morning program probably featuring the most 
banter and humorous segments. 
</P>
<P>
The arrival of Shannon -- one of the most popular deejays in New York -- has 
intensified the L.A. radio wars. The outspoken deejay has led a very public 
battle against his rivals, Rick Dees of KIIS-FM and Jay Thomas of KPWR, urging 
listeners to call in with the names of the radio stations they "flushed" in 
order to switch to KQLZ. 
</P>
<P>
For example, when a caller phoned in for tickets being given away for a rock 
concert Thursday morning, Shannon seized the opportunity to thrust a quick jab 
at Dees. 
</P>
<P>
When the caller said she was from Tarzana, Shannon asked: "Do you see Rick Dees 
driving around out there in his -- what does he drive -- in his fancy sports 
car?" 
</P>
<P>
The caller responded: "I hope not." 
</P>
<P>
For that, the caller was given tickets to see Poison in concert and a Pirate 
Radio T-shirt.

TRUCK SPILLS PESTICIDES IN VALENCIA, CAUSING MASSIVE TRAFFIC JAM ON I-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traffic on the Golden State Freeway backed up for miles in each direction in 
Valencia this morning after a pickup truck overturned and spilled possibly 
dangerous liquid and powder pesticides on the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
The accident, which closed six of the eight lanes of the freeway, occurred 
about 3 a.m. a mile north of Valencia Boulevard. A northbound pickup driven by 
Anthony Roy Canton, 24, of Hollywood went out of control and overturned, the 
California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck was carrying several types of industrial pesticides. Four containers 
spilled onto the roadway before the truck came to a rest on the center divider, 
CHP Officer Ralph Elvira said. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP closed three lanes on each side of the freeway while a hazardous 
materials team from the Los Angeles County Fire Department responded. Traffic 
slowed to a crawl in the one lane left open in each direction. 
</P>
<P>
An additional lane was opened in each direction shortly after 7 a.m., but 
thousands of commuters were caught in a traffic jam that stretched north toward 
Castaic and south to Lyons Avenue. The remaining closed lanes of the freeway 
were being reopened at about noon.

An Athens court today granted Premier Andreas Papandreou a divorce, ending his 
38-year marriage to his American-born wife, Margaret. 
</P>
<P>
The court issued the divorce on the basis of a suit Papandreou filed March 30 
saying the couple had been separated for at least four years, a court spokesman 
said. The 70-year-old Papandreou has been living with former airline hostess 
Dimitra Liani, 35, since October. 
</P>
<P>
Papandreou married the former Margaret Chant, 66, of Elmhurst, Ill., in 1951. 
They have four children. 
</P>
<P>
Greek newspapers have speculated that Papandreou may marry Liani next Sunday, 
one week before the June 18 general elections.

SINGER CO. CHIEF GUILTY OF TAX, SECURITIES FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Singer Co. Chairman Paul A. Bilzerian was convicted today of all nine counts of 
securities fraud and tax violation in federal court in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
The panel of six men and six women returned its verdict on the second day of 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
The conviction was the first jury verdict in the government's 
more-than-three-year crackdown on Wall Street crime. The Bilzerian case was 
indirectly spun off from the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first prosecution of a corporate raider using information derived 
from the Boesky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Bilzerian, 38, the Tampa, Fla., corporate raider who won control of Singer last 
year, was charged with breaking securities and tax laws and making false 
statements in connection with three failed takeover attempts and another stock 
transaction in 1985 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Count Dismissed 
</P>
<P>
He faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison on each of the nine counts. 
</P>
<P>
Originally indicted on 12 counts, Bilzerian got one count dismissed in April, 
and U.S. District Judge Robert Ward combined four conspiracies into two counts 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
None of the charges involve Bilzerian's $1.06-billion takeover of Singer, the 
Stamford, Conn. defense contractor, last year. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors' verdict seemed to indicate that they believed the government's 
chief witness, Los Angeles brokerage boss Boyd Jeffries, who pleaded guilty to 
securities violations in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Bilzerian was implicated by Jeffries, who in turn was named by Boesky. 
Jeffries, who has been cooperating with authorities, also faces a possible 
prison term. 
</P>
<P>
The tall, mustachioed Bilzerian showed no emotion as he stood to hear the 
jury's verdict. 
</P>
<P>
The government said Bilzerian made millions of dollars by accumulating stock in 
takeover targets while concealing ownership of the stocks in secret accounts 
and then selling his holdings after the stock price had risen.

Traffic on the Golden State Freeway backed up for miles in each direction in 
Valencia this morning after a pickup truck overturned and spilled possibly 
dangerous liquid and powder pesticides on the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
The accident, which closed six of the eight lanes of the freeway, occurred 
about 3 a.m. a mile north of Valencia Boulevard. A northbound pickup driven by 
Anthony Roy Canton, 24, of Hollywood went out of control and overturned, the 
California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP closed down three lanes on each side of the freeway while a hazardous 
materials team from the Los Angeles County Fire Department responded. The 
closed lanes were reopened at about noon but not before thousands of commuters 
were caught in a traffic jam that stretched north toward Castaic and south to 
Lyons Avenue.

WHITE HOUSE DECRIES 'REPUGNANT' CHINESE CALL FOR STUDENT REPRISALS

<P>
The White House today denounced as "repugnant" calls by Chinese officials for 
reprisals against student leaders of the pro-democracy demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the reappearance of Chinese leaders in public, including the first view 
of leader Deng Xiaoping in more than three weeks, White House spokesman Marlin 
Fitzwater said it still is not clear who ordered the killing of civilian 
demonstrators in Tian An Men Square last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater told reporters that U.S.-Chinese relations will not soon return to 
normal. 
</P>
<P>
"Keep in mind that the government has murdered many, many of its citizens. We 
have had an incredible upheaval in (that) country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Don't Know' 
</P>
<P>
Citing loudspeaker calls in Beijing for neighbors to turn in demonstrators and 
for punishment of student demonstrators who met with hard-line Prime Minister 
Li Peng, Fitzwater said: "Reprisals are repugnant. We certainly watch this 
situation with grave concern." 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said "no one doubts in terms of the overall government" who is in 
charge in China, "but in terms of individual actions and individual decisions 
and motivations and responsibilities, that's where we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
"You can watch television and see who the government is, but in terms of 
individual actions and motivations . . . we don't know," he reiterated. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, in his televised news conference Thursday night, refused to fix 
blame for the massacre in Beijing but said it would be "extraordinarily 
difficult" to have ties with anyone responsible for the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the United States won't have normal relations with China until the 
government there recognizes demands for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a military crackdown that killed hundreds if not thousands of people in 
Beijing, however, Bush emphasized Thursday night that he wants to "preserve the 
relationship" with China. 
</P>
<P>
For that relationship to be normal, however, he said, "it will take a 
recognition of the rights of individuals and respect for the rights of those 
who disagree." 
</P>
<P>
He said, "I don't want to pass judgment on individual leaders, but I want to 
make very clear to those leaders and to the rest of the world that the United 
States denounces the kind of brutality that all of us have seen on our 
television." 
</P>
<P>
Pressed on whether he could maintain relations with anyone who ordered the 
firing on unarmed students, Bush said, "It would make it extraordinarily 
difficult."

CRISTIANI'S CLOSEST ADVISER DIES IN EL SALVADOR AMBUSH

An El Salvador Cabinet minister who was the new president's closest adviser was 
killed today by unidentified men who riddled his car with machine-gun fire, the 
governing political party said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Antonio Rodriguez, 70, the minister of the presidency, died shortly after 
arriving at the Zaldivar Hospital, a nurse at the hospital said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, the chief of staff, was a member of the rightist Republican 
Nationalist Alliance of President Alfredo Cristiani, who took office June 1. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez's driver and bodyguard also died in the attack, which occurred 
shortly after the minister left his home in western San Salvador, according to 
Armando Calderon Sol, president of the governing party, and other sources. 
</P>
<P>
No group claimed responsibility for the attack, and no further details were 
immediately available. Rodriguez took office June 1, the day Cristiani was 
inaugurated for a five-year term. 
</P>
<P>
Leftist guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, who tried 
to disrupt the election that brought Cristiani to power, vowed before the 
inauguration to make El Salvador "ungovernable." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the guerrillas spurned Cristiani's proposal for dialogue aimed at 
ending the nation's civil war. An estimated 70,000 people, most of them 
civilians, have been killed since the civil war began nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, guerrillas attacked nine military posts and claimed to have 
killed or wounded six police in a raid on a coffee processing plant at San 
Miguel de Mercedes, 50 miles north of the capital in Chalatenango province.

BRITISH OFFICIAL TO ASSESS NEW HONG KONG PROBLEMS

Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe will visit Hong Kong in early July to assess 
problems confronting the British colony since the bloody military crackdown in 
Beijing, the Foreign Office said today. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as officials explored ways of allowing larger numbers of 
Hong Kong citizens holding British passports to settle here, although Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher has ruled out any "open door" policy. 
</P>
<P>
Howe recently warned the House of Commons against "a massive new immigration 
commitment which could more than double the ethnic minority population of the 
United Kingdom." 
</P>
<P>
Events in China have prompted widespread fears among the 5.7 million people of 
Hong Kong, which Britain is due to hand over to Chinese rule in 1997. On 
Wednesday riot police fired tear gas to break up a crowd attacking Chinese 
banks and shops, and much of the colony was closed down by a strike. 
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Office said that the exact dates and duration of Howe's trip have 
yet to be worked out but that there were no plans for him to visit Beijing or 
anywhere else while he is in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Gov. David Wilson held talks Thursday with Thatcher and Howe on the 
crisis gripping the colony. 
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Thatcher, Wilson told reporters that she had offered him 
"more than tea and sympathy" but had turned down his appeal to give all the 
colony's 3.25-million British passport holders the right of residence in 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher earlier told Parliament that the government is prepared "to see if we 
can get increasing flexibility . . . to allow an increasing number of people in 
here." 
</P>
<P>
She said that officials will examine ways of achieving that over the next few 
days and that the government is prepared to seek extra legal powers if 
necessary.

Prime Minister Bob Hawke burst into tears during a memorial service today as he 
described the brutal shooting of civilians in China by the military. 
</P>
<P>
"I call on the Chinese government to withdraw its troops from deployment 
against unarmed civilians and to respect the will of its people," Hawke told 
1,000 people at the service in the Great Hall of the federal Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Hawke tearfully read eyewitness reports of the killings, saying anti-personnel 
carriers and tanks "ran backwards and forwards over the bodies of the slain 
until they were reduced to pulp." 
</P>
<P>
Hawke has cried openly several times in public, once during debate in 
Parliament on Israel and earlier this year when admitting on television that he 
had committed adultery. At that time he said he still loved his wife, Hazel, 
calling her an "incredible woman."

Prime Minister Sosuke Uno today refused to respond as a questioner in 
Parliament broke precedent by asking him about a news report claiming he kept a 
highly paid geisha as his mistress. 
</P>
<P>
Uno, who previously denied the report to journalists, said he would not comment 
on it in a public forum. 
</P>
<P>
The report surfaced last weekend in the Sunday Mainichi magazine. An article 
quoted an unidentified 40-year-old woman as saying Uno had paid her $2,100 a 
month over a four-month period in 1985. "He is not a man of noble character," 
the article quoted the woman as saying. "I don't want him to use politics the 
same way he treated me."

Prime Minister David Lange said today that he doubts the sale of New Zealand's 
biggest steelmaker to a Chinese state enterprise will go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
In one of China's biggest overseas investments, the China National Metals and 
Minerals Import and Export Corp., said in April that it would buy troubled New 
Zealand Steel. 
</P>
<P>
The price is a closely kept secret but analysts put it at between $170 million 
and $230 million. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were . . . punting (betting on) the outcome of that deal, I would say 
unhappily it's not going to proceed," Lange told Radio New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese firm beat several other bidders in a double deal to buy 80% of N.Z. 
Steel, which was held by collapsed investment company Equiticorp International, 
and the rest from Fisher and Paykel Industries, which makes home appliances.

The 12 European Community states agreed in principle today to ban the import of 
ivory which threatens the African elephant with extinction, diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
Until a community ban on raw and worked ivory is completed, environment 
ministers may take emergency action against imports in their own countries. 
Britain, which initiated the EC action, has decided on an immediate ban, the 
diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
African elephants, slaughtered by poachers for their ivory tusks, have dwindled 
to 625,000 today from 1.3 million in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The EC's executive Commission will draw up proposals for a ban that could be 
adopted by the end of June. The EC also plans to back a call for a global ban 
at a meeting of 102 nations in Switzerland in October.

WHOLESALE PRICES UP A STEEP 0.9%, PACED BY CARS, FOOD, GAS

<P>
Wholesale inflation came roaring back in May after a two-month lull, rising a 
steep 0.9% as prices soared for gasoline, fresh vegetables and cars, the 
government said today. 
</P>
<P>
For the first five months of the year, wholesale inflation for goods one stop 
short of the retail level was running at a 9.4% annual rate, more than double 
the 4% rise in 1988 and quadruple the 2.2% 1987 gain. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department's producer price index troubled economists earlier this 
year, when it soared 1.1% in January and 0.9% in February. But moderate rises 
of 0.4% in both March and April had been seen as a sign that inflation had 
retreated at least a bit. 
</P>
<P>
In advance of today's report, many economists were predicting a 
moderate-to-brisk 0.5% gain. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Boskin, President Bush's chief economic adviser, attributed most of the 
inflation so far this year to the "special factors" of energy and food and 
predicted better numbers ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to remain vigilant against inflation. We expect inflation to stabilize 
in the second half of the year and decline thereafter," Boskin told reporters 
at a White House briefing. 
</P>
<P>
Energy prices in May rose 3.3%, a steep increase but less than half April's 
30-month record of 7.2%. For the last six months, energy prices have surged at 
a 43.3% annual rate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gasoline Prices Soar 
</P>
<P>
In May, the increase was propelled by a 5.2% jump in gasoline prices, which 
followed a 13.4% jump in April. Natural gas prices rose 3.4%, while heating oil 
costs declined 7.7%. 
</P>
<P>
Food prices, which had posted a rare 0.6% decline in April, rebounded 0.8% in 
May. The price of vegetables skyrocketed 26.4% as celery and tomato prices 
doubled and cabbage prices rose by one-third. 
</P>
<P>
There were also significant increases for eggs, rice, pasta and chicken. Prices 
for beef, pork and fish declined. 
</P>
<P>
For the last six months, food prices have risen at an annual rate of 7.3%. But 
analysts expect that trend to moderate, barring a repeat of last year's 
drought. 
</P>
<P>
The price of goods excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, often taken 
by analysts as a truer reflection of underlying inflationary pressures, rose 
0.5% last month following an unusual 0.1% decline in April. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in May was largely driven by a 1.8% rebound in auto prices 
following a 2.8% decline a month earlier. The April drop was produced by 
manufacturers' incentives to bolster sagging sales. 
</P>
<P>
Traders in financial markets were looking to today's report to provide an 
indication of how far and how fast the Federal Reserve Board will lower 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fed Lowers Funds Rate 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Fed nudged the key federal funds rate -- the interest 
charged banks for overnight loans -- down by a quarter of a percentage point to 
near 8.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Michael K. Evans, president of Evans Economics Inc. in Washington, said today's 
report means the Fed likely will wait at least a month before loosening credit 
further. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's going to be any further easing by the Fed until we . . . 
get some good inflation numbers for more than one month at a time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, analysts were optimistic that inflation reports eventually will improve.

The Soviet Union sought to limit damage to its aviation reputation today after 
a MIG-29 combat jet crashed on the first day of the Paris Air Show. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet aviation officials held a news conference in the belly of an Antonov-225 
cargo aircraft, the world's biggest plane, which is being exhibited for the 
first time in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Piotr Balabuyev, head of the Antonov company, told reporters that MIG pilot 
Anatoly Kvorchur, who ejected from his plane two seconds before it crashed 
Thursday, is already out of the hospital. He said Kvorchur, a MIG test pilot, 
might even return to the air show. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet aviation officials said it is virtually certain that the MIG-29, one of 
the Soviet air force's most powerful fighters, blew its right engine as it flew 
a demonstration flight at Le Bourget Airport.

The MIG-29 was replaced in demonstration flights today by two other Soviet 
military jets never before seen in the West, the Sukhoi Su-25 and Su-27. 
</P>
<P>
The Su-25, code-named "Frogfoot" by the NATO alliance, has been used 
extensively by Soviet forces in Afghanistan. The Afghan air force is also 
equipped with it.

<P>
The huge Antonov-225, carrying the Soviet space shuttle Buran on its back, has 
proved the biggest attraction here.

Hundreds of visitors crowded around the six-engine plane when the show was

Oakland Athletics' slugger Jose Canseco, the American League's Most Valuable 
Player in 1988, will plead no contest to gun charges, according to one of his 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Stepanian also said Canseco will get rid of the flashy Jaguar linked to 
much of his recent trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not going to fight the courts," Stepanian said after a closed-door 
conference Thursday with Municipal Judge J. Dominique Olcomendy. "He's got the 
pennant to fight for. And as for the car, I can honestly say that in six months 
it won't be around." Canseco was cited for driving the 1989 car recklessly on a 
Florida freeway and for running a red light in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco is accused of illegally carrying a loaded 9-millimeter handgun on the 
floorboard of the car during an April 21 visit to the University of California 
Medical Center at San Francisco.

CHANG TO MEET EDBERG IN OPEN FINAL;

Michael Chang of Placentia outlasted Andrei Chesnokov 6-1, 5-7, 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 
in a four-hour baseline battle today to reach the final of the men's singles at 
the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Chang, who saved three set points in the third set, became the 
youngest-ever men's finalist in Paris and is one step from becoming the first 
American to win the French Open men's singles title in 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's final, Chang will meet Sweden's Stefan Edberg, the reigning 
Wimbledon champion and No. 5 seed. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg outlasted Boris Becker 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 3-6, 6-2 in today's second 
semifinal, which lasted only 10 minutes less than Chang's match. Edberg also 
will be making his first appearance in the final at Roland Garros. 
</P>
<P>
"Making tennis history makes me feel good inside," Chang said after the 4-hour, 
5-minute marathon. "It's definitely a dream. It's something special I'll always 
have with me. I hope it'll be an encouragement to other young players." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
16th American in Final 
</P>
<P>
Chang, who ousted top seed and heavy favorite Ivan Lendl in the fourth round, 
became the 16th American in the history of the tournament to reach the men's 
final. 
</P>
<P>
He will be the first American finalist since John McEnroe five years ago and 
the sixth since Tony Trabert won the title in 1955, the last American to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"I went in relaxed because I had gone further than expected," said Chang, the 
15th seed. "I was ready to wait for each point. It was a tough match. Each 
point was really close. The exchanges were very long. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the type of match you're really happy to pull out." 
</P>
<P>
Chang, whose previous best performance in a Grand Slam tournament was the 
fourth round at last year's U.S. Open, started the match in complete command 
and ripped through the opening set in 28 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Chesnokov, the unseeded Soviet who upset defending champion Mats Wilander in 
the quarterfinals, won only 12 points in the set as he struggled to find his 
timing and rhythm, especially on the backhand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long, Hard Rallies 
</P>
<P>
The pattern continued at the start of the second set as Chesnokov dropped his 
serve twice and was down 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
But the 23-year-old from Moscow, a frequent slow-starter, then broke Chang for 
the first time and, with the crowd behind him, rallied to take the set and tie 
the match. 
</P>
<P>
By then, the rallies were long and hard, with most games going to deuce and 
some lasting more than 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Chesnokov broke Chang for 4-2 but immediately dropped his own serve as the 
grueling baseline encounter approached the three-hour mark with little drama or 
sparkle but increasing intensity. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the moment Chesnokov felt he may have lost the match. 
</P>
<P>
With Chang serving to save the set at 4-5, the Soviet had three set points in a 
game of seven deuces. He put a backhand wide on the first, a forehand inches 
wide on the second and was beaten by a Chang overhead on the third. 
</P>
<P>
Chang held serve and, two games later, took the tiebreaker 7-4 with a smash. 
</P>
<P>
Chang then began to take more risks, rushing the net to put away volleys and 
forcing Chesnokov out of his back court stride and into a stream of errors. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't play badly," said Chesnokov, the first Soviet player in 17 years to 
reach the men's semifinals. "But I'm not happy because I didn't win the big 
points. It was a question of pressure."

Eugene V. Klein, three-time Eclipse Award winner as North America's leading 
thoroughbred owner, is getting out of horse racing, he said today. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 146 horses Klein will sell are 1988 Kentucky Derby winner Winning 
Colors, 1986 Horse of the Year Lady's Secret and current 3-year-old filly Open 
Mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's just the time of my life and the stage of life that I'm at," the 
68-year old former owner of the San Diego Chargers said. "All my life I have 
been very, very competitive -- since the days of flying for the Air Force in 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"There comes a time you should do what you want to do and take it easy." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the stars of his stable, Klein's stock of brood mares, 
yearlings, foals of 1989 and horses in training will be disposed of at the 
two-day November Breeding Stock Sale at Keeneland in Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
Since entering the thoroughbred business in 1982, Klein has raced six champions 
in his name or in partnership, won seven Breeders' Cup races and 11 Eclipse 
Awards.

After more than eight months of waiting silently in the wings, Ben Johnson is 
ready to tell the story of how the world's fastest man fell from grace. The 
disgraced Canadian Olympic sprinter will begin testifying on Monday before a 
government inquiry into the use of drugs in sports. 
</P>
<P>
A nation that felt pride in his victories at the 1988 Seoul Olympics and then 
shame at his alleged use of banned steroids is expected to hang on his every 
word. 
</P>
<P>
The riveting issue is the sprinter's role in his downfall -- did he knowingly 
take anabolic steroids and understand what they were for, or was he led astray 
by his own entourage? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 27, will be the 62nd witness to appear before the inquiry, which has 
already heard 56 days of testimony.

Sunday Silence will try to end a 10-year drought of Triple Crown winners on a 
track at Belmont Saturday that might be wet from several days of rain. 
</P>
<P>
The forecast was for rain and thunderstorms to taper off by midnight tonight. A 
chance of a shower and temperatures between 75 and 80 were predicted for 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"If it stops by early morning, it would be a fast track by race time," Shug 
McGaughey, who trains Easy Goer, said. 
</P>
<P>
Post time for the 121st Belmont Stakes is about 2:30 p.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer didn't like the mud at Churchill Downs when he finished second in the 
Kentucky Derby, beaten by 2 1/2 lengths. Sunday Silence's winning margin over 
Easy Goer was a nose on a fast track in the 1 3/16-mile Preakness.

KENTUCKY SUPREME COURT ORDERS NEW SCHOOL SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The state Supreme Court declared Kentucky's system of public schooling 
unconstitutional Thursday and ordered the Legislature to create a new system. 
</P>
<P>
By permitting a wide gap between poor and wealthier school districts, the 
Legislature failed to meet its constitutional duty, the court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
"Lest there be any doubt, the result of our decision is that Kentucky's entire 
system of common schools is unconstitutional," Chief Justice Robert Stephens 
wrote for the court's five-member majority. 
</P>
<P>
Rich and poor alike "must be given the same opportunity and access to an 
adequate education," the court ruled in a case brought four years ago by a 
coalition of 66 "property poor" districts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Applies to All School Laws 
</P>
<P>
The decision "applies to the entire sweep of the system -- all its parts and 
parcels," including laws and regulations "creating, implementing and financing 
the system," the opinion said. 
</P>
<P>
This includes laws creating local school districts and school boards, the state 
Education Department, school construction and maintenance, teacher 
certification -- "the whole gamut of the common school system in Kentucky," the 
opinion said. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Wallace Wilkinson, a critic of the state's school management scheme, said 
the court had given Kentucky its greatest opportunity of the last century. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been talking about changing the management culture within the system," 
Wilkinson said. "We never imagined that we'd have an opportunity to remake the 
entire system." 
</P>
<P>
State schools Supt. John Brock called it "the happiest day of my professional 
life." 
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly's ranking members -- Senate President Pro Tem John Rose 
and House Speaker Don Blandford -- said that building the kind of educational 
system the court required was sure to the expensive, but that they are willing. 
</P>
<P>
Rose and Blandford also said the ruling was a relief, although they technically 
were on the losing side. "As far as I'm concerned, there are no more sacred 
cows" in education, Blandford said. 
</P>
<P>
The court agreed with plaintiff districts that, despite existing programs to 
funnel state money to local districts, "there are wide variations in financial 
resources . . . which result in unequal educational opportunities throughout 
Kentucky," Stephens' opinion said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even a total elimination of all mismanagement and waste in local school 
districts would not correct the situation as it now exists," the opinion said. 
</P>
<P>
The Constitution "places an absolute duty on the General Assembly to re-create, 
re-establish a new system of common schools," the ruling said, likening the 
present system to "a crumbling school-house, which must be redesigned and 
revitalized for efficient use." 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature must provide for adequate funding of schools and can choose its 
own method, the court said. But, if lawmakers decide to continue basing the 
system on poverty taxes, they must ensure full valuation of property and 
uniformity of tax rates, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky law always has required full valuation of property. Local school 
boards, which now number 177, have been allowed to set their own tax rates, 
however, and they have varied widely. 
</P>
<P>
Spending per pupil in 1987-88 ranged from a high of $4,094 in Anchorage, an 
affluent suburb of Louisville, to a low of $1,986 in Williamsburg, a small 
Appalachian town in southeastern Kentucky, state Education Department figures 
indicate.
