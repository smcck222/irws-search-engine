SACRAMENTO FILE: ASSEMBLY WILL BROADCAST FLOOR SESSIONS ON CABLE TV 
</P>

<P>
It probably won't supplant "America's Funniest Home Videos," but the Assembly 
is gearing up to begin statewide television broadcasts of its floor sessions as 
early as August. 
</P>
<P>
The lower house TV shows will be patterned after congressional coverage 
provided by C-Span, which cable viewers across the country can watch daily. 
</P>
<P>
"We have essentially isolated ourselves from the general public," said 
Assemblyman Sam Farr (D-Carmel), who spearheaded the plan, now in the dry-run 
stage. "This gives the people more access to state government." 
</P>
<P>
The television idea has the blessing of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
Brown envisions televising gavel-to-gavel coverage of floor sessions, important 
committee meetings and press conferences. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate also is considering televising its sessions but is moving more 
slowly than the lower house. 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNOR 
</P>
<P>
Will host a national governor's task force meeting on excellence in the 
workplace in Sacramento on Monday and Tuesday. Will attend a dedication of the 
Pelican Bay state prison in Crescent City on Thursday. 
</P>

WATER PIPELINE BACKERS BEGIN PETITION DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local business interests who want to bring an outside water supply to Ventura 
say they are encouraged by the surprisingly strong showing of a candidate who 
proposed connecting drought-starved Santa Barbara to the California Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
"The election in Santa Barbara clearly signals that people vote in their best 
interest, and our interests lie in obtaining quality water from the state 
system," said Robert McCord, chairman of the Assn. for Quality Water 
Alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
AQWA supporters, which include many of the city's commercial, real estate and 
development interests, began collecting signatures Monday for a November ballot 
initiative asking the city to build a $120-million pipeline from Ventura to the 
state aqueduct in Lake Piru or at Castaic Lake. 
</P>
<P>
The aqueduct transports vast quantities of water from Northern California to 
the arid southern part of the state. But some cities, such as Santa Barbara and 
Ventura, have not hooked up to the system, though Ventura has spent about $12 
million over the years to reserve the right to obtain the water. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the city's water now comes from dwindling local sources, including 
wells, Lake Casitas and the Ventura River. 
</P>
<P>
State water opponents, who include environmentalists and slow-growth activists, 
say they believe that connecting Ventura to the state water system will create 
runaway development. They said Friday that the ballot initiative will be 
defeated and pointed to pro-growth election setbacks in Oxnard and southern 
Ventura County this week as barometers of voter sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the same pro-growth people who were defeated in the Oxnard tax 
initiative and the county supervisor race, and they will be defeated again," 
said Councilman Gary Tuttle, an avowed pipeline opponent. A 5% utility tax 
proposal was defeated easily in Oxnard, and 4th District Supervisor Madge L. 
Schaefer was edged out by a political newcomer, environmental candidate Maria 
VanderKolk. 
</P>
<P>
But AQWA members draw hope from the showing of dark horse Steve Malachowski, 
who received 47% of the vote against environmentalist incumbent Tom Rodgers in 
the Santa Barbara supervisorial race Tuesday. Malachowski, a newcomer to Santa 
Barbara politics, campaigned almost exclusively on the state water issue and 
called his opponent a "water wimp" for refusing to support state water 
importation. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara is facing the most acute water shortage in the state. Residents 
have been forced to cut water consumption by 40% and lawn watering has been 
banned in that city. 
</P>
<P>
AQWA members believe that a similar future is in store for Ventura unless the 
city builds the pipeline as soon as possible. Malachowski's strong performance, 
despite accepting developer contributions in traditionally anti-growth Santa 
Barbara, gives AQWA's fledgling ballot campaign a shot in the arm, members 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people will react the same way here as they did in Santa Barbara once 
they start getting higher water bills for less water," said Jim Barroca, 
executive director of the Greater Ventura Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the chamber sent out ballot petitions to its 1,700 members. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Cooper, spokesman for the Ventura Board of Realtors, said 85 realtors are 
collecting signatures. "Our goal is to get 100 people out there, and we'll have 
that by the end of the week," he said. 
</P>
<P>
AQWA has printed 5,000 petitions and 2,000 "We Need State Water" bumper 
stickers. In addition, McCord said, AQWA will place newspaper ads this week 
urging residents to support the initiative. He said AQWA has collected 700 to 
1,000 signatures since Monday and raised more than $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Given the type of support he already has received, McCord said his group will 
easily collect the 7,468 signatures needed by June 26 to place the pipeline 
initiative on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
But Tuttle, who favors building a desalination plant instead of importing 
water, said AQWA will be defeated despite its "well-financed media blitz." 
</P>
<P>
In Oxnard, a ballot initiative to raise utility taxes was defeated by a 
grass-roots campaign that was outspent by a ratio of 9 to 1. Most of the 
financial support for the tax increase came from out-of-town developers. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura's 4th Supervisorial District, which stretches from Port Hueneme to 
Newbury Park, incumbent Schaefer suffered a stunning upset at the hands of 
VanderKolk, a virtual unknown. VanderKolk repeatedly accused Schaefer of being 
pro-development. 
</P>
<P>
AQWA members counter that water importation has nothing to do with growth. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether you are a developer or an environmentalist, Ventura residents are 
interested in the best possible source of quality water," McCord said. "And the 
state water pipeline is the building block to any sound water policy."

ATTENTION RIBBITED ON INVADERS; 
</P>
<P>
WILDLIFE: SOME RESIDENTS ARE PERTURBED, WHILE KIDS LEAP WITH GLEE OVER AN 
AMPHIBIAN INVASION IN UPSCALE NORTH CITY WEST.

<P>
The sidewalks, parks and yards of Del Mar Highlands are hopping with an 
invasion of thousands of tiny toads that appeared virtually overnight after the 
Memorial Day rains. 
</P>
<P>
"I counted 72 of them in 15 minutes while I was out walking my dogs the other 
evening," Ruby Rodriguez said. "And I only counted the ones that hopped up, not 
the ones that were sitting there." 
</P>
<P>
The toad infestation has provided a new pastime for neighborhood youngsters, 
who vie to see how many they can squash with their skateboards. They are less 
fun for joggers, who must do some broken-field running to avoid them. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny amphibians, khaki-colored with spots and ranging from nickel-size to 
quarter-size, are Western toads, or more scientifically, Bufo boreas, said Greg 
Pregill, herpetologist with the San Diego Museum of Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
Although the toads are common to this region, the hatch or "bloom" in Del Mar 
Highlands, a bluff-top neighborhood in the North City West planned community, 
is unusual because few hatchings have been reported this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The toadlets once were tadpoles, swimming in a pond or drainage ditch until 
they developed into the Plague of Del Mar Highlands -- able to live away from 
water but still attracted to the sprinkler-fed landscaping of the hilltop 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank heavens! I thought I was the only one who had seen them," one resident 
of the Highlands said when queried about the toad population explosion in the 
neighborhood. "I went out in the back yard the other night, and it was alive 
with them. I thought I was seeing things." She asked that her name not be used, 
explaining that "it's not the sort of thing you want to be associated with." 
</P>
<P>
Geraldine Munter remembers back two years or so when "there were frogs all over 
the place," but said that the invasion didn't occur last year, at least not on 
Lady Hill Road, where she and her husband live. "My cats are having a ball, 
chasing them all over the place," she said. "I can't imagine where they came 
from, unless someone brought them in. They just appeared all of a sudden after 
that big rain we had." 
</P>
<P>
She's a bit concerned that the toads may not be quite the thing for her cats to 
dine on. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard that some kinds have a poison in their systems as a protective 
thing, so they won't be eaten," Munter said, but she acknowledged that her cats 
did not seem to be suffering from indigestion. "I suppose that cats are smart 
enough not to eat them if they are poisonous." 
</P>
<P>
Pregill agreed that the toads would hardly replace Nine Lives as a prime feline 
diet, since they do have a low-grade poison in sacs behind their eyes that 
makes them taste awful and prevents predators from gorging on them. But the 
toads are otherwise completely harmless, he said, and "don't vocalize at all," 
so there should be no midnight serenades in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
They eat insects, including mosquitoes, growing to 3 to 4 inches long, and make 
good show-and-tell subjects for elementary school classes. 
</P>
<P>
With the four-year drought drying up normal marshy areas and with rampant 
development gobbling up most of the toads' normal habitat, North County 
suburbia is probably the best housing bet for a Bufo boreas, Pregill said. 
</P>
<P>
Keith MacBarron, a vector ecologist with the county Department of Health 
Services, said the invasion is perhaps a nuisance, but not a hazard. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be stretching it a bit to say they were vectors," MacBarron said, 
explaining that vectors are creatures posing a health threat to humans. 
Mosquitoes and rats qualify. Toads don't. 
</P>
<P>
Pregill predicted that the problem will take care of itself. Within a few dry 
days, the toads will go to ground, burrowing down into soil to go dormant for 
the summer, until cooler weather and winter rains arrive. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Rodriguez said, "it's sort of creepy" to look out the patio door and see 
several of the minuscule amphibians, their faces pressed against the glass, 
looking in like peeping Toms. 
</P>
<P>
"They are sort of cute now," she said, "but there are an awful lot of them. I 
just hope that they don't grow up. I couldn't stand that."

COST OF GRAFFITI REMOVAL EATING UP CITY BUDGETS; 
</P>
<P>
VANDALISM: RISING GANG ACTIVITY IS BLAMED FOR MUCH OF THE INCREASE IN 
SPRAY-PAINT DAMAGE, BUT SOME CITY OFFICIALS ACCUSE 'WANNA-BES'.

<P>
Graffiti, which can be the signature of gang members, is costing cities and 
other agencies in Ventura County a bundle to remove, and some officials say 
it's only getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the tab for graffiti removal in Ventura, Thousand Oaks and Oxnard is 
expected to run about $275,000. Smaller cities are straining to absorb the cost 
in their maintenance budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Public agencies also are getting socked with removal costs. South Coast Area 
Transit budgets $30,000 a year to rid its 28 buses of the spray-paint, and 
officials there say the problem is growing. 
</P>
<P>
In Oxnard, graffiti has escalated so much that by mid-May the city had used up 
$75,000, the amount that was earmarked for removal until the end of June, said 
Robert Frederick, the city's street superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a contractor working every day, five days a week," Frederick said. "We 
were caught up in March, and then all of a sudden, it got way out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
By May 1, at least 900 sites on public property had been cleaned, he said. But 
the city can't keep up with the growing problem. There is now a four-week 
backlog of sites awaiting cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
That's discouraging to police, who say graffiti should be removed quickly -- 
within 24 hours if possible. While many people who spray-paint on walls are not 
associated with gangs, graffiti is a vital tool to gang members, who use it to 
establish their territory. 
</P>
<P>
Police say one way to disrupt gang activity is to remove the markings or cover 
them up. 
</P>
<P>
"Graffiti feeds itself," said David Keith, senior crime analyst for the Oxnard 
Police Department. "The more kids see it, the more they get the idea to do it. 
If it's up a couple of weeks, it snowballs." 
</P>
<P>
Gang violence in Ventura County has escalated in the past two years, said Chief 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Vincent J. O'Neill Jr., co-chairman of a countywide task 
force on gangs. Shootings have risen, he said, and last November a gang-related 
homicide occurred near Channel Islands High School in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County's gang problems, though serious, aren't the menace that plagues 
Los Angeles, police say. Nor is the graffiti as troublesome here. The city of 
Los Angeles spends $2.7 million a year to get rid of graffiti, while the Rapid 
Transit District (RTD) spends another $10 million a year to keep its 2,795 
buses graffiti-free. 
</P>
<P>
"A large percentage of the graffiti in Oxnard is put on by 'wanna-bes,' " Keith 
said. "They see it, or hear about it through the media, and think it's cool to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
To keep the problem from becoming epidemic, some cities, such as Ventura, have 
set up elaborate anti-graffiti programs. Ventura has a graffiti hot line for 
callers to report sightings. Three days a week a crew drives around the city to 
scout out new graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Usually the paint is removed within 24 hours, said Mike Solomon, the city's 
budget coordinator. But the price is high. In previous years, the city budgeted 
$50,000 for graffiti removal on city property. City officials added another 
$100,000 this year to tackle the problem on private property. 
</P>
<P>
"It's either that or let the gangs take over the streets," Solomon said. "Then 
you need more police protection." 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard and Ventura pay private contractors for the work. In an average month, 
the number of spray-painted sites can run from 80 to 100. About 75% to 80% of 
it is gang-related, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had them challenge us," said Solomon. "We remove it, they put it back 
up, three or four times. If we have to, we go back." 
</P>
<P>
When Ventura beefed up its program this year, the graffiti dropped off, he 
said, but in the last month it's picked up again, possibly as the result of the 
longer daylight hours. During the summer, Solomon and other city officials said 
they expect the problem to get worse. 
</P>
<P>
City officials in Thousand Oaks are seeing an increase in graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
"We have two guys who are on it virtually full time," said John Clement, the 
city's director of public works. The city spends about $50,000 a year from its 
maintenance budget to remove graffiti, much of it on walls of housing tracts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all pseudo-gang," Clement said. "We have some small-town hoodlums." 
</P>
<P>
Police say it's tough to catch the graffiti artists, who are often youths on 
bicycles who can do extensive damage in less than a minute and then be gone. 
</P>
<P>
But police are starting to beat the spray-painters at their own game. If the 
graffiti is gang-related, youths usually sign their gang's name, their own 
nicknames and those of other members, as well as other identifying symbols. 
</P>
<P>
The nicknames sometimes relate to a physical characteristic, such as "Slick," 
for someone with slicked-back hair, or "Thumper," for someone who hits others, 
said Rod Mendoza, senior crime prevention officer for the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department in Camarillo. Some prefer more masculine names such as 
"Playboy" or "Macho Man." 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza said his department has identified about 60 youths by analyzing the 
graffiti, although only a handful were responsible for the vandalism. Some have 
been arrested. One youth made restitution and served time in a juvenile 
detention hall for spray-painting a house, he said. Two others were recently 
arrested, one for causing $1,000 worth of graffiti damage. 
</P>
<P>
State law prohibits the sale of aerosol paint to minors. The law was designed 
to prevent youths from inhaling the fumes to get high, but now it's geared more 
toward graffiti, Mendoza said. He talked with store owners about the graffiti 
problem and got some of them to put up signs displaying the law. But that often 
doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
"They go in stores and rip it off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several Ventura County cities have adopted ordinances that get tough on 
graffiti delinquents. The most recent was Simi Valley, where such a law went 
into effect Feb. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Its law reaffirms that graffiti is illegal both on public and private property. 
It requires stores to post a notice informing patrons that it is illegal to 
sell spray-paint to minors, and it requires parents to pay for damages if their 
children are caught. Under the Simi Valley law, private property owners must 
remove the graffiti within 10 days or city crews are authorized to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing that as the abatement program progresses, the places that used to 
be hit frequently are not being hit as much," said Jocelyn Reed, Simi Valley's 
deputy director of environmental services. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula, the scene of a recent flurry of gang activity, doesn't have an 
anti-graffiti program, but surprisingly, the problem doesn't seem to be on the 
rise there. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not as much of a problem as it used to be," Police Chief Walter Adair 
said. "We have graffiti. It doesn't seem to be a public issue right now." 
</P>
<P>
The job of removing graffiti falls to Santa Paula's Public Works Department, 
which fits it into the regular maintenance workload. Other cities don't have 
specific funds for graffiti removal and must do it that way also, making it 
nearly impossible to estimate the cost of such vandalism. But some say the 
growing problem is draining maintenance crews. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts a strain on us," said Dave Palmaro, Camarillo's assistant street 
superintendent. "We have to pull men off jobs." One spray-painting spree might 
require three solid days of clean-up work by a two-man crew, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Moorpark, the City Council recently directed the staff to develop a 
full-fledged graffiti removal program. The city has purchased a truck, is 
compiling a list of two or three dozen paint sites throughout the city and will 
soon decide how much to budget for the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"At one time the city had an active grass-roots effort doing graffiti removal," 
said Ken Gilbert, the city's public works director. "Some of that interest wore 
off and the efforts of volunteers declined." 
</P>
<P>
It was just such a grass-roots effort that came to the rescue of the 
graffiti-stricken Nyeland Acres community in March. Since the county has no 
funds for graffiti removal in unincorporated areas, residents and a few public 
officials banded together in a volunteer effort to remove the graffiti with 
donated paint. 
</P>
<P>
"It brought a sense of community," said Cheryl Collart, assistant to 1st 
District Supervisor Susan K. Lacey. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't likely that the county will soon have a graffiti removal program as 
elaborate as the city of Ventura's. 
</P>
<P>
"The county has higher budget priorities," Collart said.

U.S. DROPS CHARGES FOR 5 ALIENS IN VAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U. S. prosecutors dropped misdemeanor charges Friday against five undocumented 
immigrants from El Salvador who were inside a van last month when a Border 
Patrol agent opened fire on the vehicle, wounding two passengers. 
</P>
<P>
The five had been charged with illegal entry into the United States, a federal 
misdemeanor, but authorities said the charges were filed only in an effort to 
have the men available for investigators. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents have interviewed the witnesses and are continuing their 
investigation, said Larry Burns, the assistant U. S. attorney handling the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
William Braniff, U. S. attorney in San Diego, declined to provide any 
additional details about the matter, other than to confirm that the inquiry is 
continuing and that charges have been dropped against the five men, who were 
released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal investigation is focusing on the appropriateness of the response by 
the Border Patrol agent. The officer, approaching the vehicle on foot from 
behind, fired at the vehicle -- which agents suspected was smuggling illegal 
aliens -- as it accelerated forward from a stop, according to police accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Any prospective action by the U. S. attorney's office would have to be taken 
under federal statutes, which include a broad range of laws aimed at protecting 
the civil rights of civilians from abuse by authorities and others. 
</P>
<P>
Misdemeanor charges of entering the United States illegally, filed against a 
sixth passenger, Lilian Pineda, are expected to be formally dropped Monday, 
said Burns, the assistant U. S. attorney. Pineda, a 24-year-old mother of 
three, is a Salvadoran citizen who has filed for political asylum in the United 
States, according to her attorney, Jan Bejar of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Pineda was struck in the right arm by a bullet fired by the patrol agent. 
Another passenger, Francisco Ricardo Carbajal Cuenca, a 16-year-old Mexican 
youth, is recovering from a bullet wound in the neck. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred along the right shoulder of the northbound lanes of 
Interstate 5 during the predawn darkness of May 25. The van, packed with at 
least 11 people, including a 12-year-old Salvadoran girl, was stopped for an 
immigration check by a Border Patrol sedan at a point about 6 miles north of 
the U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
Patrol guidelines, like those of other police agencies, specify that officers 
may use lethal force only when they believe their lives or the lives of others 
are in danger. 
</P>
<P>
Police found that the agent fired because he perceived that the driver of the 
van might have planned to throw the vehicle into reverse, posing a threat to 
the approaching agent and his partner, according to Lt. Dean Girdner of the 
Chula Vista Police Department, which investigated the case and turned the 
results of its inquiry over to the FBI. Contrary to the officer's stated fear, 
Girdner said, the van definitely never headed backward. 
</P>
<P>
The officer's apparent goal, Girdner said, was to stop the van by blowing out 
its tires. However, none of the three bullets fired from his .357 Magnum 
service revolver struck a tire; all three pierced the rear of the vehicle, 
which had been stolen an hour earlier from a San Diego street. No weapon was 
found inside the van, Girdner said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was fearful that the vehicle might come back at him," Girdner said of the 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
Border Patrol officials have refused to reveal the name of the officer. The 
agent, described only as a veteran officer in his 30s, has been placed on paid 
administrative leave pending several inquiries, according to agency officials. 
</P>
<P>
The agent also faces an internal investigation by the Office of the Inspector 
General, an internal affairs agency within the U.S. Justice Department.

A $1.3-MILLION GIFT FOR ZOO GORILLAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Zoo has received a $1.3-million gift for the construction of its 
new gorilla exhibit, one of the largest single contributions in Zoo history, 
Zoo officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
With their gift, Michael and Elizabeth Dingman, former residents of La Jolla 
who now live in New Hampshire, brought the Zoo to within $1 million of its 
fund-raising goal for the $11.5-million replica of an African rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
Zoo officials said the gift will ensure that the exhibit will be completed on 
schedule. Five years in the planning, the new gorilla enclosure is being built 
now and is scheduled to open in March of next year. 
</P>
<P>
The gift is among the most generous ever received by the Zoo, behind the $3.3 
million Joan Kroc gave in 1986 for the Zoo's Tiger River Exhibit and the $3 
million donated by Paul and Ione Harter of Coronado in 1988 for a new facility 
for research to aid endangered species. AMY WALLACE

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SWAT TEAM CALLED IN BUT GUN STORE IS EMPTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Believing a burglar was holed up in a gun shop, Culver City police closed a 
busy two-block section of Washington Boulevard for more than four hours Friday, 
slowing the morning commute. 
</P>
<P>
A sheriff's SWAT team finally stormed the Martin Retting Gun Store shortly 
after 8 a.m. but found no one inside, Lt. Steve Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began shortly after police arrested a burglary suspect as he left 
the store at 11029 W. Washington Blvd. carrying a load of guns, Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers who arrested Remberto Argumendo, 35, of Los Angeles thought they 
heard someone inside the gun store, Weiss said. Police closed off a two-block 
area from 3:50 a.m. to 8:10 a.m. and called in the sheriff's SWAT team, Weiss 
said. Argumendo was booked at the Culver City Jail on suspicion of burglary.

CLUB DONATES $9,500 TO HELP FIGHT DRUGS 
</P>

<P>
A rap song and a skit showing "eight ways to say no" were presented by 
fifth-graders in Ventura as part of a graduation ceremony Friday for the Drug 
Abuse Resistance Education program. 
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, the Ventura Newcomers Club gave DARE $9,500, the largest 
single donation the drug education program has received in its three years in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, three Ventura police officers meet with fifth-graders at 
Mound Elementary School once a week and also hold discussions with students in 
other grades, said Lt. Pat Rooney of the Ventura Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The DARE program "deals with how to say no," Rooney said. "It deals with peer 
pressure. The whole program focuses on self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
Among the ways to say "no" portrayed in the skit were "Walk away" and "Change 
the subject." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) addressed the 116 fifth-grade 
students' ceremony, which lasted an hour and a half, Mound Principal Paul 
Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
Students received T-shirts and certificates at the ceremony, and four were 
awarded as winners of a DARE essay contest. The winners were Rebecca Baker, 
Jesse Jacobs, Trisha Kirk and Heather Goss. 
</P>
<P>
The Newcomers Club held a fund-raising auction in March for the DARE program, 
with participants bidding on "a trip to Cancun, a trip to Las Vegas, a piece of 
art, $1,000 security system," said Sandy Ohlsen, a Newcomers spokesman. "This 
stuff was all donated from the people in Ventura. It was wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Ohlsen said the club has donated money to DARE since the drug education program 
began. KIM KASH

BOARD TO SEE IF CITIES BACK SALES TAX BOOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS LOZANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Transportation Commission on Friday voted to ask the 
county's 10 cities if they would support placing a measure on the November 
ballot that would raise the sales tax a half-cent to help pay for local street 
construction and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ballot measure must be approved by the county's 10 cities and the 
Board of Supervisors before it can be placed on the ballot in the fall, said 
Mary Travis, a county transportation official. 
</P>
<P>
The increased sales tax would generate an estimated $25 million per year for 
the next 20 years, Travis said. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation officials acknowledged that county voters might be reluctant to 
approve another tax increase after the passage of Proposition 111. That 
measure, approved Tuesday, will raise the gasoline tax by 5 cents a gallon 
statewide for one year beginning Aug. 1, then go up a penny a year for the next 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
But Travis said that because $2 billion of the new gas-tax funds will be 
distributed to those counties that can come up with matching funds, it would 
benefit residents to support the local sales tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
With the passage of Proposition 111, Ventura County is expected to receive $160 
million over the next 10 years for road construction. Travis said if the sales 
tax were increased, the county could get as much as $65 million more over the 
same period of time. CARLOS LOZANO

COPTER FIRMS FACE TOXIC-DUMPING SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County officials have filed a suit in Superior Court alleging that a 
group of helicopter crop-dusting companies dumped toxic wastes and abandoned 
four leaking underground fuel tanks at Oxnard Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The suit accuses the group -- which includes Evergreen International Aviation 
Inc., Evergreen Helicopters, Evergreen Aircraft Sales and Leasing Co., Condor 
Helicopters and Aviation Inc. and their executives -- of dumping pesticides at 
a helipad there. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also alleges that the defendants abandoned three 2,000-gallon tanks 
for aviation fuel and one 1,000-gallon gasoline tank, which leaked fuel into 
the ground and polluted ground water. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged dumping took place between 1966 and 1986, when the companies leased 
land from Ventura County for a helipad at the airport on Patterson Road near 
West 5th Street, according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The contamination of the ground and ground water around the helipad reduced the 
value of the property and violated state health and safety codes, the suit 
alleges. 
</P>
<P>
The county has already spent $90,000 to begin cleaning up the fuel and 
chemicals and will have to spend more, the suit contends. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also alleges that the county paid $120,000 in legal fees and a $50,000 
settlement in a 1986 lawsuit filed by airport workers who claimed that the 
dumping made them ill. 
</P>
<P>
The dumping also could expose the county to lawsuits from people claiming that 
it injured them and to prosecution by governmental environmental agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The suit asks the court to order the defendants to pay those damages and any 
future damages caused by the dumping, but the Evergreen companies and Condor 
Helicopters have already denied any responsibility for the damages. 
</P>
<P>
Evergreen and Condor officials could not be reached Wednesday for comment. MACK

INJURED WOMAN FOUND BESIDE ROAD

<TEXT>
<P>
A 34-year-old woman with severe head injuries was found on the side of a road 
near a Camarillo neighborhood early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Rita Calloway, a transient from the Oxnard area, was listed in serious 
condition with a skull fracture at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard 
on Friday evening, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives believe that Calloway either was pushed from a moving car or struck 
with an object on Santa Rosa Road near Morongo Drive, said Lt. Gary Backman of 
the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
A real estate agent taking down signs in the area about 1 a.m. found the woman, 
who was semiconscious and bleeding profusely from a head wound, Backman said. 
</P>
<P>
The agent called the Sheriff's Department and showed deputies where she had 
found the woman, a site about 80 yards from the back yard of a large house, 
said Sgt. Paul Oechsle of the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was taken to Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo and later 
transferred to St. John's Regional Medical Center, Backman said. 
</P>
<P>
No one heard or saw any vehicles or disturbances, Oechsle said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives investigating the case are not releasing information about possible 
motives or specifics of the attack, Backman said. 
</P>
<P>
But they have not ruled out the possibility that the attack might be linked to 
the beating of Michelle Green in Ventura on May 5, said Cmdr. Raymond Abbott of 
the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Green was found unconscious behind a large dumpster in the 800 block of 
Poinsettia Place. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we can ignore any possibilities," Abbott said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura Police Department has investigated many leads in the Green case but 
is not close to finding a suspect, Lt. Jay Wilson of the Police Department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Green remains in guarded condition at the Ventura County Medical Center, where 
she occasionally opens her eyes but is unable to communicate, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. CAROL WATSON

More than 100 people aboard an Air China flight bound for San Francisco and 
then Beijing were forced to empty the plane Friday after the airline received a 
telephone bomb threat as the jet was waiting to take off from Los Angeles 
International Airport, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A police bomb squad searched the 747 for more than 1 1/2 hours in a remote area 
of the airport after the 90 passengers and 15 crew members got off, but no 
explosives were found. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Jack Dillard said the bomb threat was received by the airlines' 
reservation counter at the airport about 12:40 p.m. 
</P>

Elly Brekke, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said 
passengers and crew members climbed off Flight 984 without incident.

2 ON COUNCIL BACK FORUM ABOUT GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Moorpark City Council members pledged to hold a community forum this month 
to discuss a possible gang problem in view of a drive-by shooting last year. 
</P>
<P>
But there is disagreement over whether gangs exist in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"The way you don't have a big problem is you meet it before it walks in the 
door," Councilwoman Eloise Brown said Thursday. "I'm much more confident 
addressing the concern before it gets really big." 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark had its first drive-by shooting last November when Oxnard gang members 
fired on a group of Moorpark teen-agers at a Round Table Pizza restaurant, 
wounding five people. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still concern about the drive-by shooting," Councilman Paul Lawrason 
said. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 people attended a forum on April 5 to discuss the gang issue. Brown 
said she will ask for a meeting this month and another in September just after 
school begins. 
</P>
<P>
Brown is up for reelection, and Lawrason is running for mayor in November. 
</P>
<P>
"It's election time," said Clint Harper, a councilman who has said he intends 
to run against Lawrason for mayor. "Politicians tend to go berserk as you get 
closer to elections." 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials say a serious gang problem does not exist in 
Moorpark. Lt. Rich Rodriguez of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department said 
the city occasionally has graffiti on walls, but there is no gang operating in 
the area.

BUILDER OFFERS $29-MILLION DEAL TO SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA CLARITA VALLEY: IN RETURN FOR THE GIFT OF LAND AND MONEY, THE DISTRICT 
HAS AGREED TO DROP ITS OPPOSITION TO THE DEVELOPER'S PLAN TO CONSTRUCT AT LEAST 
10,000 UNITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A major developer has agreed to donate land and cash to a Santa Clarita Valley 
high school district worth as much as $29.3 million -- the largest such 
contribution ever made to the school system. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the William S. Hart Union High School District has agreed not to 
oppose plans by the developer, Dale Poe Development Corp., to build at least 
10,000 units in the company's giant Stevenson Ranch residential project west of 
the Golden State Freeway and south of Six Flags Magic Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Hart officials had previously urged the Los Angeles County Planning Commission 
and the Board of Supervisors to reject the project because it could eventually 
add 2,500 students to the rapidly growing school district. 
</P>
<P>
The donations are worth almost twice as much as the standard developer fees 
levied on residential construction to build schools, Hart Supt. Clyde Smyth 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, developers must pay local school districts $1.56 for each 
square foot of residential construction. Those fees would have netted the Hart 
district only $15 million, Smyth said. 
</P>
<P>
Smyth and school officials statewide have said for years that developer fees do 
not provide enough funds to build new schools. Hart officials have repeatedly 
said they would drop their opposition to Stevenson Ranch only if the company 
scaled down its plans or went beyond the payments required by law. 
</P>
<P>
The Hart trustees approved the agreement Thursday night. Under it, the district 
will not endorse Stevenson Ranch but will withdraw its opposition and send a 
letter to the Board of Supervisors listing the benefits of the pact to the 
Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fair," Smyth said. Asked if the pact would set a precedent for 
other school districts to follow, he replied, "I would sure be happy if it 
did." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Stevenson, a Dale Poe vice president, said the company was pleased with 
the package and noted that it follows a similar deal -- worth $22 million -- 
that the company struck with the Newhall School District, an elementary school 
system. 
</P>
<P>
The donations to Hart are tied to the number of units eventually built in 
Stevenson Ranch. Dale Poe is obligated to donate 42 acres, still to be 
selected, for a new high school to serve residents of the more than 5,000 units 
the company has already received county permission to build, Smyth said. The 
land is worth $16.8 million, and the company will donate $1.8 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
The company would donate 24.5 acres, worth $9.7 million, for a junior high 
school if the company wins approval of another 2,500 units, Smyth said. If 
Stevenson Ranch eventually reaches 10,000 units, the company would donate 
another $1 million in cash, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement comes at an important time for Dale Poe. Last month the Los 
Angeles Regional Planning Commission refused to revise the area's General Plan 
to allow Stevenson Ranch to expand to at least 10,000 units. Dale Poe intends 
to press for the expansion when the plan reaches the Board of Supervisors, 
which will make the final decision. 
</P>
<P>
After the commission's action, Stevenson said the company would try to persuade 
the supervisors to allow the expansion by citing the project's amenities and 
its value to the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita Valley's five school districts are scrambling to accommodate 
skyrocketing enrollments. District superintendents predict that they will need 
to build 33 schools by 2010 -- at a cost of $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
Hart officials hope to hear sometime this summer whether the district has 
qualified for state funding to build a new high school -- the district's fourth 
-- in Valencia. It will cost about $40 million to purchase the land and build 
the school, Smyth said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the district, now with 9,400 students, will have 11,569 in two years, 
about 3,300 over the enrollment its schools are designed to hold. 
</P>
<P>
A fifth high school is tentatively planned for the eastern side of the Santa 
Clarita Valley. The Stevenson Ranch site would be the district's sixth high 
school campus.

TRANSIENT TO STAND TRIAL IN SLAYING

<P>
A 22-year-old transient has been ordered to stand trial for murder in the fatal 
shooting and robbery of a Simi Valley insurance worker. 
</P>
<P>
After a preliminary hearing in Ventura County Municipal Court, Oscar Rudolfo 
Barrascout was held to answer charges of murder, burglary, robbery and use of a 
firearm in the May 18 slaying of Gregory D. Minor, 37. 
</P>
<P>
Barrascout also was charged with a special circumstance -- committing murder 
during a felony -- which allows prosecutors to seek the death penalty if they 
so choose, Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn said. No decision has yet been 
made to seek such a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Barrascout is being held in lieu of $1-million bail in the Ventura County Jail 
pending his arraignment July 12 in Ventura County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Police found Minor's body under his bed and the bedroom furniture in disarray 
on May 18. Witnesses at the hearing testified that Barrascout had visited Minor 
to look at a white 1984 Corvette that Minor was selling. 
</P>
<P>
The keys to the Corvette were found in the van where Barrascout was sleeping 
when Simi Valley police detectives arrested him early on May 19. Police also 
found a diamond-faced, gold watch inscribed with Minor's initials, witnesses 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the van, police found the .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol that 
Barrascout allegedly used to kill Minor. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Barrascout's friends testified that he showed them the gun while driving 
to the beach the day before Minor's death. 
</P>
<P>
Barrascout asked if the gun was powerful enough to kill someone, testified one 
of the friends, David Morales. MACK REED

PARK DEDICATED WHILE BUDGET CUT PLAN DECRIED; 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: CONSERVANCY CHAIRWOMAN SAYS STATE'S PROPOSED REDUCTIONS WOULD GREATLY 
HAMPER THE GROUP'S EFFORTS TO ACQUIRE MORE PARKLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The chairwoman of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy used what she called 
the happiest of occasions -- the dedication of a new park Friday -- to call on 
environmentalists to express outrage at proposed cuts in the state 
organization's budget. 
</P>
<P>
"This may be our last dedication," Carole Stevens told about 150 people who 
gathered under shade trees to inaugurate Towsley Canyon Park, 145 acres of 
pristine woodland in the mountains overlooking the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens said a proposal by the Assembly Ways and Means subcommittee would 
greatly hamper the conservancy's efforts to acquire parkland. The subcommittee 
proposed paying for measures to be taken under Proposition 117 -- the Wildlife 
Protection Act approved by voters Tuesday -- by redirecting $1 million from 
funds gathered to implement Proposition 70, the 1988 Park Bond Act. The money 
would come out of the conservancy's budget. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Stevens said, the conservancy cannot spend any of the $10 million in 
Proposition 117 funds it will receive over the next five years to acquire any 
lands that are not technically wildlife corridors, as specified in the 
proposition. 
</P>
<P>
This will hinder the conservancy's ability to acquire and protect mountain land 
that does not qualify as a wildlife corridor, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We need your letters of support, your letters of outrage that when you voted 
for Proposition 70 you expected parkland" and did not expect the money to go to 
implement other propositions, Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
The diversion of money would jeopardize the purchase of land surrounding 
Towsley Canyon Park, conservancy officials said. Environmentalists and local 
elected officials see the dedication of the park at the mouth of the canyon as 
the first step toward creating the proposed 6,000-acre Santa Clarita Woodlands 
State Park, west of Santa Clarita and north of Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Laurene Weste, commissioner of the Santa Clarita Parks and Recreation 
Department, called the woodlands proposal an effort to "save California for 
Californians." 
</P>
<P>
"We can't replace this," she said of Towsley Canyon. "This may not be in the 
city of Los Angeles, but you know and I know that our residents are going to 
use it," said Los Angeles Councilwoman Ruth Galanter. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Ed Davis, who authored a bill that enabled the conservancy to buy 
the Towsley Canyon site for $500,000, said he would continue to help the agency 
acquire land for a larger park. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' aide, Hunt Braly, said he and his boss would work to make sure parkland 
and wildlife funds are kept separate, making more money available for land 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy leaders turned the dedication into a testimonial to Sonia Thompson, 
longtime conservancy staff member who is moving to Washington. Elected 
officials from the state, Santa Clarita, Los Angeles, Agoura Hills and Los 
Angeles and Ventura counties presented plaques and scrolls to Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
"When we're all dead and gone, there will be trees that will say thank you to 
Sonia Thompson," said Joseph T. Edmiston, the conservancy's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy also named a building in the park the Sonia Thompson Nature 
Center.

LIGHTING UP U.S.-MEXICO BORDER AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read your article "Tactic of Lighting Up Border Raises Tensions" (Part A, May 
26) with great disgust. I can't believe that there are actually people who will 
go so far as to degrade Latino men, women and children trying to come to the 
United States and have a decent life. They're coming from countries -- whether 
it's Mexico or El Salvador -- where they have nothing. They have no chance of 
giving their children a decent education or even enough to eat. What else are 
they supposed to do? The United States is the land of freedom and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
I want to take Muriel Watson's statement, "Something has to be done. We are in 
a crisis situation," and change it a little. We are not in "crisis situation," 
the Latin American people are in a crisis situation. But, she is right about 
one thing. Something does have to be done. We need to change the United States 
foreign policy. We need to persuade our government to stop spending so much of 
our tax dollars on war in Latin America, and help create jobs and better social 
programs there. We need to help rebuild those countries instead of destroying 
them. 
</P>
<P>
It makes me sick to see all of those United States citizens at the border 
shining their lights on the people trying to come here. Then they go and blame 
drugs, traffic and pollution on them too? They have to be kidding! Why don't we 
ask our dear President Bush about his involvement with drugs, or let's ask the 
oil companies about the chemicals that they send to Colombia in order to make 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Come on already! It is time to stop trying to put blame on immigrants for all 
of our country's problems and do something. 
</P>
<P>
To all the Anglos out there on the border -- get off your high horse and start 
taking responsibility for our country's problems as well as for other 
countries' problems.

LOSING THE FORESTS AS WELL AS THE TREES; 
</P>
<P>
* 'TRULY HORRENDOUS' NEW EVIDENCE ON DEFORESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A decade ago the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization estimated that the 
world was losing its vital tropical forests at the staggering rate of 28 
million acres a year. Since then things have become worse. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based World Resources Institute, in a study prepared in 
collaboration with the United Nations, now places annual tropical forest losses 
at between 40 million and 50 million acres a year. Each year, forests about the 
size of the state of Washington disappear from the face of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Does it much matter to a resident of Los Angeles or London or Leningrad if 
trees are felled at an accelerating rate in the jungles of Brazil or Indonesia 
or Thailand? It matters a great deal. 
</P>
<P>
Tropical forests absorb huge amounts of carbon dioxide, the main contributor to 
the greenhouse effect, the buildup of gases in the atmosphere that work to trap 
solar radiation. As forests shrink, the Earth's ability to recycle carbon 
dioxide declines. Adding to the problem is that tree cutting is almost always 
followed by burning of the underbrush, releasing even more carbon dioxide into 
the air. The result, in the view of many scientists, is to bring closer the 
time when the planet will begin to warm up, producing profound changes in its 
ecosystems. 
</P>
<P>
There are no easy ways to control deforestation. Concentrated in developing 
countries with rapidly growing populations, deforestation is a many-sided 
problem that is sustained by government policies on land tenure, by private 
greed, and by the survival-driven need of the landless to practice subsistence 
agriculture even on barely fertile forest soil. Some governments -- Brazil's 
and Costa Rica's come to mind -- have taken laudable if modest steps in recent 
years to slow the rate of destruction of the tropical forests. But overall, as 
the latest analysis of satellite photos indicate, those efforts are not enough. 
</P>
<P>
More is at stake in deforestation than the threatened warming of the Earth, 
however. Perhaps half of all the world's hundreds of thousands of plant and 
animal species are native to tropical forests. Scientists fear the extinction 
of literally tens of thousands of these species as the forests recede. A source 
of particular concern is the loss of plants that could provide the natural 
substances for curing or controlling many diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Agriculture Committee chairman, describes the new 
evidence on deforestation as "truly horrendous." That does not seem to be an 
overstatement. Set against the long-term environmental implications of 
deforestation, most day-to-day political problems tend to appear 
inconsequential indeed. The trick now is to get political leaders to agree with 
this assessment. Only then, maybe, will effective remedies -- like strictly 
administered and policed development policies that encourage environmental 
protection and discourage the unbridled exploitation of limited resources -- 
begin to evolve.

POLICE BOARD URGES FIRING OF OFFICER IN BAR BRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles police board has recommended the firing of a patrol sergeant who 
was involved in a brawl last year in a Burbank restaurant during which he and 
several other off-duty officers fought with patrons and employees. 
</P>
<P>
A six-day Board of Rights hearing ended Thursday with Sgt. Christopher Bonilla, 
32, being found guilty on three counts of misconduct, Police Cmdr. William 
Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
The board recommended to Chief Daryl F. Gates that Bonilla be fired. 
</P>
<P>
A Board of Rights hearing is similar to a court trial but is presided over by a 
panel of three high-ranking officers. 
</P>
<P>
Gates is expected to act on the recommendation next week. He can choose to fire 
Bonilla or take a lesser disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
"The board makes the decision of guilty or not guilty," Booth said. "He was 
found guilty of all three counts. The decision is now the chief's." 
</P>
<P>
The disciplinary action stems from a fight on May 10, 1989, in the bar of the 
Black Angus restaurant at 235 S. 1st St. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank police said the brawl started after a patron, Robert Martinez, 29, of 
Burbank walked by a table where six off-duty officers were sitting and knocked 
over a bottle of beer. 
</P>
<P>
A shouting match followed and the officers began fighting with Martinez. Police 
said two cocktail waitresses, two bouncers and a bartender joined in. 
</P>
<P>
During the fight, police said Martinez was dragged outside by the officers and 
kicked while he was on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the officers -- Bonilla, Oscar Jiminez and Arthur Placentia -- pleaded 
guilty to disturbing the peace in February and were fined $470 each. 
</P>
<P>
Bonilla, who was originally charged with battery, was also placed on three 
years probation. 
</P>
<P>
None of the bar employees were charged with any crime. 
</P>
<P>
Bonilla, who was relieved of duty without pay, was charged with three counts of 
misconduct because an internal affairs investigation found that he had been 
drinking, had made threats during the incident and had kicked Martinez.

LIGHTING UP U.S.-MEXICO BORDER AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As residents of Southern California, we are well aware that the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service is not able to cope with the thousands who break the law 
and cross our border from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
For a lawyer, Antonio Rodriguez, and a psychologist, Gloria Romero, to feel 
this behavior should be acceptable, makes me question their motives and 
integrity. 
</P>
<P>
The taxes of all of us are being stretched to the breaking point to care for 
those living here illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Light Up the Border may be a wrong way to protest this injustice. I deplore the 
use of violence if they resort to that. However, two wrongs don't make a right. 
</P>
<P>
What has happened to respect for the law? If you don't like a law, help to 
change it, but observe it while it is a law. 
</P>
<P>
For an attorney and a teaching psychologist to suggest citizens should look the 
other way as more undocumented immigrants pour over our borders is morally 
irresponsible. It has little to with xenophobia -- we do not "hate strangers or 
foreigners" per se.

NETTIE TORPIN; MANAGED MOVIE LOCATION RANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nettie Torpin, who for 35 years helped manage the 20th Century Fox location 
ranch in Malibu Canyon, has died in Northern California. She was 92. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Torpin, along with her late husband, Ralph, maintained the property and 
organized filming on the property. She lived on the ranch from 1946 to 1981, 
until it was purchased by the state and converted to Malibu Creek State Park. 
She then moved to Woodland Hills, where she lived until moving to Weed in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Torpin died Sunday in Weed of natural causes following a series of recent 
strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Born Dec. 15, 1898, in Dennison, Iowa, she played center on the Nebraska state 
championship basketball team in 1915. After graduating high school, she taught 
at a country school for three years in Oakdale, Neb. Her family moved to 
Hollywood during the Depression and she lived there until moving to the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by a sister, Ellen Anderson of Northridge; sons, Jack Torpin of 
Weed and Roger Torpin of Huntington Beach; a daughter-in-law, Bette Torpin of 
Weed; 12 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral is scheduled for 2 p.m. Sunday at Pierce Brothers Chapel of the Oaks 
at Valley Oaks Memorial Park in Westlake Village, which is handling the 
arrangements. Burial will follow. Donations can be made in Mrs. Torpin's name 
to the Motion Picture Health and Welfare Fund.

BRAUDE PLAN TO BAN SMOKING IN RESTAURANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reply to Ellen Goodman's column "Free Advice to a Tobacco King: Wise Up," 
Commentary, May 29: 
</P>
<P>
My husband smoked three packs per day and at age 58 had his first heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors warned him that smoking was elevating his blood pressure. They told him 
that if he continued smoking he would surely have another heart attack -- 
perhaps fatal. He came home, sat down on the sofa and lit a cigarette. He said 
the doctors were just "alarmists." He passed away five days later.

James Anthony Cassin, a news cameraman at KTLA-TV for 44 years, has died at his 
Encino home. He was 62. 
</P>
<P>
Cassin started with KTLA in late 1946 when it was under Paramount Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
He shot footage for 27 consecutive hours in 1949 when 3 1/3 -year-old Kathy 
Fiscus fell into an abandoned well in San Marino, and in 1968 he covered the 
assassination of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
He also worked as a cameraman on the Lawrence Welk Show in the early 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Cassin was born Sept. 20, 1927, in Santa Monica. He was found dead June 2. He 
apparently had lost consciousness and fallen into his swimming pool, said his 
daughter, Camille Cassin. 
</P>
<P>
Cassin is survived by his wife, Constance; sons, Christopher Cassin of San 
Diego and Mark Cassin of Encino; daughters, Sherry Cassin and Madeline Cassin 
of New York, and Camille Cassin of San Diego.

VIOLENCE INVOLVING DEPUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am glad that you have given publicity to the brutality cases of some deputies 
of the County Sheriff's Department. I am sick and tired of having to pay, as a 
taxpayer, millions of dollars for damages simply because some brutal deputy 
decides that the apprehended person does not act the way he expects him or her 
to act. 
</P>
<P>
I remember one case of this nature that happened over a year ago. It was at the 
Alpine Village in Torrance where about a hundred persons watched with shock and 
dismay the brutal treatment of two young white men. When I arrived one deputy 
was pummeling one of the kids although he was giving him no resistance at all. 
The other young man was practically on his knees begging the deputy to stop 
hitting his friend. This act seemed to infuriate another deputy, who then 
proceeded to throw this young man against the side of a car. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies must be made to understand that they are only supposed to apprehend 
persons and not to mete out punishment. This is the job for the judge and the 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
If Block doesn't stop these practices then the U.S. Department of Justice 
should intervene and investigate the whole mess.

<P>
BEIJING CONTINUES TO ASSAULT THE SPIRIT OF PRESS INDEPENDENCE; 
</P>
<P>
RIGHTS: SINCE LAST JUNE, MANY CHINESE JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN PURGED, JAILED OR 
HUMILIATINGLY COMPROMISED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE NELSON, Anne Nelson is a member of the board of the Committee to 
Protect Journalists. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He was young, good-looking in an austere way and spoke excellent, 
British-inflected English -- not surprising, given that he listens to the BBC 
English-language service every day in Beijing (that is, when his government 
doesn't have it jammed). 
</P>
<P>
He wore exactly the intent, searching expression we had seen so often on the 
faces of the Chinese student demonstrations on television a year ago. Yet his 
words -- a confession that could have been taken from "Darkness at Noon" -- 
seemed to spring out of a unreconstructed past. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the Democracy Movement," he explained, "but I didn't know what I was 
doing. I shouted slogans with everybody else, but I didn't know what they 
meant. We were demanding a free press, but what does that mean? There is no 
need for an independent press in a country like China, where the Communist 
Party truly represents the will of the people." He has seen the light, the 
young journalist says, and has repudiated the Democracy Movement and his 
involvement in it; when he goes back to China he will be formally investigated 
by the Communist Party, but he feels he has "nothing to fear." 
</P>
<P>
The young man's humiliating compromise is clearly one that is necessary now for 
any Chinese journalist who wishes to continue in the profession. Liu Binyan, 
China's most famous journalist-in-exile and a victim of many purges himself, 
captures the sense of moment when he quotes the proverb, "The greatest sadness 
is the death of one's spirit." 
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, in the wake of the past year's crackdown on the Democracy 
Movement in China, journalists have suffered more sweeping, and lasting, 
retaliation that any other category of intellectuals. The Committee to Protect 
Journalists' latest reckoning holds that 20 Chinese journalists have been 
arrested since June, 1989. Of these, only one, Dai Qing (an offspring of 
Communist Party elite), was reported to be among the 211 detainees released by 
the government in mid-May. The other 19, including Song Yuchuan and Wu Xuecan 
of the People's Daily and Xu Xiaowei and Zhang Weiguo of the Shanghai World 
Economic Herald, are presumed to remain in detention. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of others who have escaped imprisonment have lost the right to work as 
journalists. At the country's leading newspaper, the People's Daily -- the 
Communist Party's mouthpiece -- about 100 journalists have been driven out, 
including the editor-in-chief, the director and almost all middle-ranking 
editors and department heads. Most of those removed were placed under house 
arrest and obliged to write self-criticisms; they were replaced by editors from 
the army news paper and editors shipped in from provincial party papers, 
untainted by first-hand knowledge of the massacre. China's most prestigious 
independent publication, the World Economic Herald, has been closed. 
</P>
<P>
The intense young man I met, like the vast majority of Chinese journalists, 
will remain at their publications, however dead in spirit. The party 
"investigation"of his activities will probably beginwith small group meetings 
in which he will have to pronounce and sign a confession of his "errors." If he 
is a party member, he will also be obliged to write a letter of self-criticism 
-- or three or four if the first is too weak. His access to foreign travel will 
be limited. No doubt at least part of his speech to me was directed at his 
Chinese colleagues in the room who might be reporting back to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
With the ground-breaking publications and leading talents of the Chinese media 
silenced or obliged to recant, the readership encounters a press whose familiar 
hallmarks are conformity and acquiescence to Communist Party policy. Until 1985 
three subjects were taboo: human-rights violations, military abuses and the 
corrupt activities of high-ranking party cadres and their children. For a brief 
time, open discussion of these issues galvanized Chinese journalism, but they 
have disappeared from China's news pages again. But even more distressing is 
the number of journalists who have disappeared into China's jails as political 
prisoners, many of them because of their profound commitment to freedom of 
expression, a concept Americans regard as a basic principle. 
</P>
<P>
There are ways to help. Unfortunately, one was missed last month, when the Bush 
Administration renewed China's most-favored-nation trade status. Many Chinese, 
including Liu Binyan, feel it would be a mistake to revoke it entirely. But Liu 
believes that MFN -- or similar instruments -- could have human-rights 
conditions attached, such as the release of political prisoners. Such a measure 
would leave China open to positive foreign cultural and trade influences, while 
still sending a message to Beijing that all is not forgiven, or forgotten.

VIOLENCE INVOLVING DEPUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On May 23, 1989, I filed a police report with the Marina del Rey sheriff's 
station. 
</P>
<P>
The two young deputies who came to my home to take the report were so kind, 
considerate of my grief and pain, that weeks later I sent a letter of thanks to 
Block. Since then I have been working closely with a sergeant in the fraud and 
forgery division. This gentleman has been helpful way above the call of duty. 
</P>
<P>
I am sure that all of us abhor unnecessary violence. But until we "walk in 
another man's shoes" can we be sure that we know both sides of the story?

RAIN EXPECTED THROUGHOUT COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hurricane Boris is a shadow of its former self, but the weakening storm is 
expected to drop rain throughout San Diego County today, according to the 
National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot to complain about this weekend -- the humidity, the warm 
temperatures and now the rain," said forecaster Wilbur Shigehara. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from satellite weather pictures, coastal and inland areas could receive 
up to a quarter of an inch beginning this afternoon and into Sunday morning, 
Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Campers traveling to the mountains and deserts should be wary of gully washers 
-- brief but heavy downpours and gusty winds, Shigehara said. Those areas may 
receive up to an inch of rain. 
</P>
<P>
The core of what was once Boris will pass over San Diego late today, he said. 
The weather is expected to turn cooler and partly cloudy by Sunday afternoon, 
he said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal government has agreed to pay two developers and the city of San 
Diego $1.5 million as part of a settlement involving the 1983 deaths of two 
boys, killed when a military shell exploded after they found it while playing 
in a Tierrasanta canyon. 
</P>
<P>
In settling the case, the federal government has acknowledged at least partial 
responsibility for the deaths and any similar incidents that may occur, said 
San Diego attorney David Holdway, who represented the developers, Christiana 
Community Builders and Ponderosa Homes. 
</P>
<P>
The boys' parents sued the developer and the city, who are expected to turn 
over the settlement to them. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Michael E. Quinton, representing the federal government, 
refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Holdway said Christiana Community Builders, Ponderosa Homes and the city of San 
Diego paid $6.3 million in settlements after Corey Alden Peake and Matthew 
Smith were killed by a live artillery shell they found in an area that was the 
Marine Corps' Camp Elliott during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The developers and the city combined suits to seek full restitution, but 
settled for $1.5 million May 30 in an arbitration proceeding conducted by 
Magistrate Harry R. McCue, Holdway said. The Navy has conducted several 
cleanups in the area since 1984, and has scheduled a major $16-million sweep 
this summer, the developers' attorney said.

CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ON HOPE LAND SWAP POSTPONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A House subcommittee hearing on a controversial proposal to exchange National 
Park Service property in Cheeseboro Canyon for land owned by entertainer Bob 
Hope in eastern Ventura County has been rescheduled for July 19. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee on the environment, energy and natural resources of the 
Committee on Government Operations is holding hearings to determine whether the 
federal agencies should approve large land swaps. 
</P>
<P>
Subcommittee Chairman Mike Synar (D-Okla.) has suggested that requiring 
congressional approval might provide more public scrutiny and safeguards. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing, originally scheduled for May 3, will be the second to be held by 
the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
National Park Service officials will be asked to explain previous actions on 
the proposed land swap and verify the agency's stated neutrality on the deal, a 
subcommittee aide said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the land-swap proposal, the park service would exchange 59 acres in 
Cheeseboro Canyon for 1,100 acres that Hope owns in adjacent Jordan Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Developers who have an option to buy Jordan Ranch are seeking the Cheeseboro 
property for an access road to a proposed golf course and 750 homes. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, if the swap is approved, Hope has agreed to sell parks agencies 
another 4,600 acres he owns in the Santa Monica and Santa Susana mountains for 
$20 million, which proponents say is well below the market rate. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the exchange, which has divided the environmental community, 
regard the hearing as a place to stymie it. 
</P>
<P>
Public criticism by a subcommittee of Congress, which controls the park 
service's budget, could make the agency reluctant to approve such a proposal.

STUDENTS TO PRINT EDITED MAGAZINE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: DOZENS OF POEMS, STORIES AND ARTWORKS WERE CHANGED OR DROPPED BY 
SCHOOL AUTHORITIES. CENSORSHIP IS CHARGED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid charges of censorship, students at Redondo Union High School went to press 
Friday with a student literary magazine in which more than half a dozen 
allegedly offensive artworks, poems and stories had been altered or excised at 
the behest of school officials. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Powell, the 18-year-old editor of the student publication Opus, said the 
changes were forced on staffers after a teacher who was not involved with the 
magazine seized the galleys 2 1/2 weeks ago and complained to the principal 
that some submissions were sacrilegious and obscene. 
</P>
<P>
Among the items the teacher found objectionable, Powell said, were a poem by an 
honor student titled "(expletive) Authority" and a drawing of a demon 
swallowing a crucifix on which the face of Christ was a Happy Face logo. 
</P>
<P>
"The material that was presented to me was very obscene," said Principal Jack 
Clement, who added that he responded by convening a five-member committee of 
faculty and administration "to review the literary merit" of the publication. 
Clement said he was particularly concerned that parents and others in the 
community would be offended by the profanity and religious and sexual 
references in some of the works. 
</P>
<P>
"As a school official, I feel I have a responsibility to make sure the image 
our school projects reflects our various audiences," he said. "Yes, there ought 
to be freedom of expression. But we serve several different audiences, not only 
in our school but in our community, and our charge is to bring out the best in 
our students in terms of their writing and talent." 
</P>
<P>
But students disagreed, as did the magazine's faculty adviser, David Lemire, 
who, like Clement, sat on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the things (Clement) wanted edited were so insignificant," said 
Lemire, an English teacher who has been volunteer adviser to the magazine for 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
Lemire noted, too, that this is Clement's first year with the district. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he just wanted to avoid any potential phone call from any potential 
parent of any potential frame of mind," Lemire said. 
</P>
<P>
Lemire said that even though the author of the poem had already agreed to 
change its title and the magazine staff volunteered to excise the sketch, 
Clement alerted the committee to dozens of submissions that he felt should be 
censored, ranging from a sketch of a serpent entwined around a crucifix to the 
use of such words as rape. Most of Clement's suggestions -- including those two 
examples -- were overruled by the committee, Lemire and Clement agreed. 
</P>
<P>
But, Lemire added, the principal exercised veto power over the committee in 
some cases, insisting that all profanity involving the word God be removed from 
the students' short stories and poems. 
</P>
<P>
Clement denied that he had used veto power over the committee. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an open, collaborative effort, and . . . we walked away feeling that we 
had enhanced the quality of the product," Clement said. 
</P>
<P>
Lemire said he and Powell plan to bring the matter before the South Bay Union 
High School District trustees at their next meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, he has consulted the American Civil Liberties Union about 
his concerns, along with the Washington-based People for the American Way, a 
national First Amendment rights watchdog organization. Ironically, People for 
the American Way recently lauded Redondo Beach's elementary trustees for 
withstanding efforts by a local Christian parents' group to censor the 
grade-school reading curricula. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I can tell, it seems to be a pretty broad and sweeping attempt at 
censorship," said Deanna Duby, senior staff attorney for the group, adding that 
many of the changes appeared to be illegal under the California Education Code. 
The code expressly prohibits censorship of student publications by school 
officials except where a publication is obscene, libelous, slanderous or an 
incitement to unlawful or disruptive activity. 
</P>
<P>
School Board President William Beverly, told about the censored materials, 
added that he was surprised the students had not yet complained to the board. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen what the offending works were, but from what I'm hearing, much 
of what the committee found objectionable wouldn't upset a person of ordinary 
sensibilities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But school Supt. Walter Hale defended Clement's actions.

PADRES TURN DAY AROUND, BEAT DODGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You ever have one of those days where nothing goes right? You know, the kind 
where your day's already miserable, and you haven't even gone to work yet. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Friday just happened to be one of those dog days for Padre center fielder 
Joe Carter and catcher Benito Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's day began on a treadmill at 6:30 in the morning at the Scripps Clinic, 
where he took a physical required by the incoming Padre ownership group. He 
returned home and tried to catch some sleep, but his realtor picked this day to 
show his house to prospective buyers. What was a man to do but leave early and 
find some peace at the ballpark? 
</P>
<P>
Santiago, meanwhile, knew Friday's game against the Dodgers was a 7:35 p.m., 
and strolled into the clubhouse about 4:45. One problem. The team and 
front-office employees were in left field having a photograph taken for 
outgoing owner Joan Kroc. Sorry, Mrs. K, it's going to be missing an All-Star 
catcher. 
</P>
<P>
So, with all of this havoc, just take a wild guess who were the offensive 
heroes in the Padres' 12-6 victory over the Dodgers in front of 34,641 at San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium? 
</P>
<P>
Yep, Joe Carter drove in three runs, including a two-run homer, and scored the 
go-ahead run in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
And Santiago just happened to be the one who belted the three-run homer in the 
seventh, the seventh of the game and the one the Dodgers couldn't overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Lefferts pitched 2 1/3 shutout innings for the victory, the Padres' 11th 
in their past 14 games. And all of a sudden, the Padres (29-24) find themselves 
just 6 1/2 games behind division-leading Cincinnati. It's the closest they've 
been since May 12. 
</P>
<P>
The Carter-Santiago duo broke open a 6-6 tie in the seventh, and by the time 
the inning finally ended, the Padres had sent 11 batters to the plate, scoring 
six runs. It was the seventh time in the past 11 games that the Padres have 
batted around in an inning. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, who has seven homers in his past 17 hits, opened the floodgates with 
one out in the seventh when he hit a sharp grounder to shortstop Alfredo 
Griffin, which bounced off Griffin's knee and caromed into foul territory 
behind third base. By the time the ball was retrieved, Carter was standing on 
second. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Stephenson followed with a walk, bringing Santiago to the plate. He ran 
the count to 2-1 against Jim Gott, the Dodgers' third pitcher of the night. The 
next pitch was a fastball. It was neatly deposited deep into the left-field 
seats, just missing the upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I hit it, I knew it was gone," Santiago said, "but I lost it in the 
lights. I didn't know it it would be fair, so I looked at the umpire, and I 
became a happy man." 
</P>
<P>
It was all the Padres would need, but they continued to pour it on until Tony 
Gwynn's two-run single climaxed their third six-run inning in the past 11 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres appeared for a while as if they would win in a rout. They were 
cruising along in the sixth inning with hardly a care in the world. 
</P>
<P>
They had a 5-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Whitson, who had thrown just 51 pitches, was on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds had lost again for the fourth time in five days. 
</P>
<P>
But all of a sudden, with one out, Whitson lost it. He had wrenched his back in 
the fourth inning on his run-scoring single, and now, of all times, the pain 
began to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
He issued his first walk, to pinch-hitter Stan Javier. Lenny Harris followed by 
lining the next pitch into right field, only the third hit allowed by Whitson, 
and the Dodgers had two baserunners in an inning for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Next up: Kirk Gibson, who was making just his fifth start of the season after 
spending the first two months of the season on the disabled list with a torn 
hamstring tendon. 
</P>
<P>
First pitch: Home run into the right-field seats, Gibson's first of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Dobson, Padre pitching coach, immediately summoned Greg Harris from the 
bullpen. Harris had not thrown more than a handful of warmup pitches, but 
because of the injury to Whitson, he was allowed to throw as many as he desired 
on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
He should have thrown one more. 
</P>
<P>
Kal Daniels hit his first pitch over the center-field fence, and all of sudden, 
it was tie game, 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
It then became the battle of the bullpens. Neither was pretty, and at times, 
they looked downright ugly. 
</P>
<P>
But as beleaguered as the Padres' middle relief has been, they proved Friday 
that they'll match bullpens with the Dodgers any night of the week. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres broke the tie in the bottom of the sixth when third baseman Mike 
Pagliarulo hit his second home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
That lead lasted, oh, about five minutes. With two outs in the seventh, Chris 
Gwynn, Tony's brother, hit an opposite-field home run over the left-field 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
Most remarkable was not so much that it was the first home run in Chris Gwynn's 
career but that Harris had allowed as many home runs in 1 1/3 innings as he had 
in his previous 79 dating back to Aug. 22, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"My first thought was, 'It's going to be a long drive to the house tonight,' " 
Tony Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
Well, leave it to big brother to upstage Chris Gwynn in the bottom of the 
seventh. Tony's two-run single assured the Padres of their victory. He now has 
12 RBIs in his past 10 games and has raised his batting average to a lofty .327 
with runners in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
The folks in attendance should have known it would be a crazy night from the 
outset. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Manager Tommy Lasorda was ejected from the game in the bottom of the 
first when arguing third-base umpire Greg Bonin's call. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Alomar was on second base and Tony Gwynn on first when Dodger starter 
Tim Belcher threw a pitch into the dirt that bounced by catcher Mike Scioscia. 
Scioscia recovered quickly, however, and threw to third baseman Lenny Harris. 
Alomar dived into third a step too early, and Harris put down the tag. Bonin 
ruled he missed, and the argument began. 
</P>
<P>
Harris started it, and Lasorda finished it. And just so that the Dodgers 
couldn't get any further riled, home-plate umpire Jim Quick went to the Dodger 
dugout and ordered an ESPN technician to turn off the monitor showing the 
replay. It didn't matter -- the replay was unclear, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
In the second, Dodger right fielder Hubie Brooks was fooled on Whitson's 
changeup and flung his bat above the Dodger dugout. Who did it hit? The big 
boss himself, Fred Claire, Dodger vice president of player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
And, just think, all that fun was before even the first home run was hit. 
</P>
<P>
Yes sir, it was that kind of night. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Unless the Kansas City Royals make a drastic turnaround, Royal General Manager 
John Schuerholz said that he will start trading away some of his high-priced 
veterans, which may include former Padre pitcher Mark Davis. The Royals' 
$24-million payroll is the highest in the major leagues, with Davis (four 
years, $13 million) being their highest-paid player. "The fact that we created 
the highest payroll in baseball is not a badge that I wear proudly," Schuerholz 
said. "We've responded to the marketplace, but I think it's gone too far when 
we've become the highest-paid club in the smallest market. If we don't win a 
championship with that, it just doesn't add up. That's why we may have to have 
to look to look at building ourselves up for a year or two, and my preference 
is not to build ourselves up with free agents. We don't want to keep mortgaging 
the future with young players to keep trying to get that one piece of the 
puzzle to put us over the hump." And Davis? "I haven't talked with anyone about 
trading Mark Davis," Schuerholz, "but that's not to say somewhere down the road 
I wouldn't think about it." Said Padre Manager Jack McKeon: "He knows my 
number." 
</P>
<P>
Padre pitchers Mark Grant and Greg Harris said that they are planning an 
excursion to Anaheim on their off-day Monday to visit Davis when the Royals 
play the Angels. "We're going to try to cheer him up," Grant said. . . . Jim 
Palmer, the Hall of Fame pitcher who broadcast Friday's game for ESPN, provided 
a couple of thrills for the Padres. He walked up to Padre pitcher Andy Benes 
before the game, introduced himself, and said, "Hi, I really wanted to meet 
you. I enjoy watching you pitch." The other thrill? Pat Dobson, Padre pitching 
coach, walked up to his former teammate and asked him to autograph a baseball. 
. . . Padre real estate update: Second baseman Roberto Alomar just bought a 
four-bedroom house in Carmel Mountain Ranch; outfielder Joe Carter has his 
Poway home already up for sale, looking to purchase a bigger one; right fielder 
Tony Gwynn said he and his family are about two months away from moving into 
their new Poway home; first baseman Jack Clark and his wife are looking for a 
home in the San Diego area, and prospective owner Tom Werner just signed a 
lease to rent a home in San Diego. . . . Padre outfielder/first baseman Jerald 
Clark caught 11 fish on his day off, including a three-pound bass and 
three-pound trout. "I must have about 30 in my freezer," Clark said, "I'm going 
to have to start giving some away." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Even though Mike Maddux was hit hard in his three innings against Atlanta 
Wednesday, allowing six of 12 hitters to make good contact, he will likely get 
another chance to start Tuesday in Houston. The Dodgers don't have anybody else 
they trust as their fifth starter. The only other candidate, Tim Crews, entered 
this season with a career 6.75 ERA against the Astros. Maddux allowed the 
Braves two runs on three hits in three innings in the Dodgers' eventual 7-5 
victory Wednesday. It was his first start in nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
Maddux said he talks to his brother Greg, a pitcher for the Chicago Cubs, about 
once a week. "We talk about hitters we have faced. We give each other tips," 
Mike said. "The only thing we don't discuss is players on our own teams. That 
would be betraying the trust of our teams." When Greg's name is mentioned to 
Mike, he sometimes looks strange, and not because he is jealous of his more

Ramon Martinez's most visible souvenir from his 18-strikeout performance is a 
blister on the middle finger of his right hand. Trainers worked on it Friday, 
and it should cause him no problems in scheduled start here Sunday. . . . Orel 
Hershiser is accompanying the team on this six-game trip because he wants to 
continue his daily work with therapist Pat Screnar. . . . Shortstop Jose 
Offerman continues to be the Dodgers hottest minor league prospect. He recently 
hit .517 in one week for triple-A Albuquerque to improve his average to .400 
after 52 games. He has committed 14 errors. Scouts are also impressed with 
third baseman Dave Hansen, who is hitting .344 with four homers and 36 RBIs in 
52 games.

MORNING BRIEFING: THIS TIME, IT COULD BE MORE THAN JUST A CROWD AT AIRPORT

The World Cup soccer tournament started Friday in Italy, where Italian soccer 
players are regarded as national heroes. 
</P>
<P>
But only when they honor their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Sports Illustrated reported that when the Italians were eliminated by France in 
the second round of the World Cup four years ago at Mexico City, a huge crowd 
gathered at the airport outside Rome to meet the team when it returned home. 
</P>
<P>
"But the fans didn't come to console the players," the magazine reported. "They 
came to jeer and spit at them, and to scream, 'Italy vomits on you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who were the first three picks in the 1981 NBA draft? 
</P>
<P>
Choose your poison: Mike Reid, on the difference between the Butler National 
Golf Club, site of this week's Western Open, and Medinah Country Club, which 
will be the host club for the U.S. Open next week: "Butler can ambush you. 
Medinah just body-punches you to death." 
</P>
<P>
Rookie ritual: Calling it "just the routine of your average player," Stacey 
King of the Chicago Bulls revealed his pregame ritual to Inside Sports 
magazine: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He phones his mother in Lawton, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He plays at least one hour of Nintendo video games. "I can't sit still," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He pats teammate Michael Jordan. "I had a poster of him in my room at 
college," said King. "Now I touch the real thing." 
</P>
<P>
 -- He rubs his lucky rabbit's foot. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He strokes his lucky Pink Piggy, which was given to him by his college 
sweetheart, Lisa Lawson. "She gave it to me two years ago and I scored 38 
points that day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For what it's worth: Inside Sports, basing its poll on conversations with NBA 
scouts and player personnel directors, lists Cedric Ceballos of Cal State 
Fullerton as the No. 22 prospect and Trevor Wilson of UCLA as the No. 36 
prospect in this month's NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
At Pauley Pavilion on Dec. 23, with scouts from eight NBA teams watching from 
the stands, Ceballos missed seven of his first eight shots and 13 of 19 
overall, scoring 14 of his 18 points after the Titans had fallen behind UCLA, 
51-31, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wilson had 23 points and 12 rebounds in an 87-75 Bruin victory. 
</P>
<P>
Add poll: Bo Kimble of Loyola Marymount is listed as the No. 11 prospect in the 
Inside Sports poll. Derrick Coleman of Syracuse is listed as No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Mark Aguirre of DePaul, Buck Williams of Maryland and Isiah 
Thomas of Indiana, all of whom are playing in the NBA finals.

BEANBALL WARS STILL NOT THE RIGHT THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is impossible not to be disgusted by the completely unsportsmanlike and 
dangerous behavior exhibited by any team that supports or engages in the 
intentional act of throwing a baseball at a batter. Worse yet is the farcical 
defense given by perpetrators of "retribution" or "pay back." 
</P>
<P>
First of all, a ball thrown at 90 m.p.h. is not the baseball equivalent of an 
in-your-face slam dunk, a clean trap block or a hard body check against the 
boards, but rather the same as an elbow to the throat, an intentional face-mask 
penalty or a slash across the eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Second, if the players believe so strongly in retaliation and justice, why do 
the pitchers inevitably end up throwing at the first convenient opposing 
player, who probably wasn't even the one who committed the instigating offense? 
I suppose I should apply this same logic to my neighbor, who breaks my window, 
by punching his wife when I see her step outside for the morning paper. 
</P>
<P>
To those who say it's all part of the game, so is clean play, sportsmanship and 
self-control.

BEST STILL TO COME FOR SUNDAY SILENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your June 4 headline treatment of the story about the accident at Hollywood 
Park last Sunday focused attention on the lesser part of the story. 
</P>
<P>
My opinion is that it should have read, "J. Nic's Desire, a Beautiful 
4-Year-Old Colt, Killed After Senseless Accident." 
</P>
<P>
A minor footnote might have added: "A professional jockey, pushing the eager 
young colt beyond its physical limits, contributed directly to the decision to 
kill the injured and therefore economically valueless thoroughbred." If space 
permitted, the name of the jockey could have been included in the body of the 
story.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost every day I read about athletes involved in drug abuse, assaults and 
rapes. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that if you can justify this coverage, you could surely devote 
some space to California Special Olympics June 22. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no under-four-minute miles, no 19-foot pole vaults and no 75-foot 
shotputs. What there will be is a sporting event in the purest sense, athletic 
competition for the joy of participation. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no athletes signing endorsements or receiving huge sums to war a 
brand of shoes. But make no mistake about it: These are athletes.

FOREIGN WINNER DIDN'T DIMINISH 500 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Generally I don't read the sports page, and I'm not what you would classify as 
a sports fan, but nonetheless, today I read Jim Murray's column on the Indy 500 
race (May 28). And I must take exception to his comments. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that the Indy race is supposed to be won only by Americans. The fact 
that foreigners have captured first place for the last two years seems to go 
against Murray's Americanism, and somehow the race seems to have been less 
pleasing to him because of this. 
</P>
<P>
What a shame! As I said earlier, I am not a sports fan. In fact, I dodge most 
games and events successfully. But this time, my 16-year-old daughter told me 
that it was selfish for me to say no to accept my husband's invitation to the 
Indy 500. 
</P>
<P>
So it was that I attended the "Greatest Spectacle in Racing" in Indianapolis. 
And I now believe that Jim Murray had it all wrong by mourning the absence of 
an American winner. On the contrary, my experience showed me that this race is 
all about being the best, and national boundaries have no place there. The 
winner's nationality was worthy of no more than a footnote in the summary of 
the 74th Indy 500. 
</P>
<P>
I think this is because, like me, many of the race-goers were first-timers who 
were there to experience the spectacle as well as the sport, and recognized the 
winner as the composite of the very best. Driver, equipment and crew, it came 
together for Arie Luyendyk. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that my winner wasn't American won't make any difference to the dream 
at all. Being the best and believing in possibilities is not an American 
exclusive. So try to be more generous with the rest of the world, Mr. Murray, 
and stop whining.

I have never been more provoked to write a letter in response to an article 
than after I read about Andre (Endorsements Have Gone to My Head) Agassi.

It is a tragic scenario to see a great talent like Agassi striving for 
recognition as a flash rather than striving for tennis excellence at Centre

BRAY QUALIFIES FOR BERTH ON U.S. GOODWILL TEAM DESPITE A KNOCKDOWN; 
</P>
<P>
BOXOFF: VAN NUYS HEAVYWEIGHT RUNS INTO TROUBLE IN SECOND ROUND AGAINST 
MASSACHUSETTS FIGHTER BUT GETS OFF THE DECK TO WIN A 5-0 DECISION.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Bray went into Friday night's Goodwill Games Boxoff with a vision in his 
head, a vision of standing in Barcelona, Spain, two years from now with an 
Olympic gold medal on his chest. 
</P>
<P>
But five minutes into his heavyweight bout against James Johnson, he found 
himself with something else on his chest: the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
Bray, a former U.S. champion in the heavyweight division, found himself on the 
deck courtesy of a whistling right hand to the jaw. He got up, however, and 
went on to win a 5-0 decision, giving him a berth on the U.S. team for the 
Goodwill Games on July 28-Aug. 5 in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Bray, 19, of Van Nuys, had missed with his own right and Johnson, 23, of 
Lowell, Mass., followed quickly with the crushing right that landed flush on 
Bray's chin. Bray went down hard but was up quickly and did not appear hurt. He 
began landing his own heavy punches just seconds later, and Johnson's 
opportunity had passed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I showed a lot of heart after getting caught with that punch," Bray 
said. "It was a beautiful right hand, but champions get off the canvas. I have 
only been knocked down one other time in my life, and that was three years ago. 
It wasn't as hard as this punch, though." 
</P>
<P>
Bray, 6-foot-3 and 195 pounds, opened the bout with an easy left jab that 
caught Johnson, 6-4 and 200 pounds, high on the head and twisted Johnson's 
headgear around. Bray snapped Johnson's head back with a heavy left hook a few 
seconds later, and it appeared that he would have an easy night. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson had other plans and he bothered Bray with solid combinations midway 
through the round, landing several hard punches that forced Bray to back up. 
</P>
<P>
Bray seemed to regain control in the second round, but the knockdown briefly 
changed the complexion of the fight as Johnson began boxing with greater 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
In the third round, the two fought on even terms for the first two minutes, but 
with 30 seconds left Bray rocked Johnson with a left-right combination, 
wobbling his legs and sending him into the ropes. But Bray landed few blows the 
rest of the way as both fighters appeared exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
All five judges gave Bray the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't fought in six months," Bray said, "and I felt the rust. I just wasn't 
as sharp as I wanted to be. But I'm young. I'll get much better." 
</P>
<P>
Bray actually had been out of action only since February, when he sustained an 
injury in a loss to an Italian fighter in Reno, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
But even in that loss, Bray had stayed on his feet. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe that punch," he said. "Boom, and down I went. I couldn't 
believe it. I was so frustrated at myself. But I have never been in better 
shape, and that's what got me through. A year ago or even six months ago, I 
never would have recovered from that knockdown." 
</P>
<P>
He gave much of the credit for his conditioning to Joe Goossen, the trainer for 
the Ten Goose Boxing Club in Van Nuys just blocks from Bray's home. Goossen 
began working with Bray after the loss in Reno. 
</P>
<P>
"He beat one of the top four amateur heavyweights in the country tonight, so 
that's good," Goossen said. "And he came back after the knockdown, and that's 
good. But he still needs work on his fundamentals. He still needs polish. I 
need more time to work with him. 
</P>
<P>
"But remember, we've got time. He's only 19." 
</P>
<P>
Not for long. Bray will turn 20 next week. And then, after a few more weeks in 
the Goossen gym, he will be off to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"I will win (at) the Goodwill Games," Bray said. "Count on it. I got the rust 
off and now I'm ready."

DIGEST: ALEMANY'S ROSSELLI TO TAKE PART IN GIANT ROOKIE TRAINING CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joey Rosselli of Alemany High will leave Monday for a mini-training camp with 
the San Francisco Giants' rookie-league team in Everett, Wash., after signing a 
professional contract Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-1, 180-pound left-handed pitcher was selected in the third round of 
the amateur draft Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He would not reveal his signing bonus but said it was about $100,000. In 
addition, the Giants have provided a $40,000 fund for college if Rosselli 
decides to return to school. In February, he signed a letter of intent to play 
football at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
Rosselli was 7-3 with a 1.12 earned-run average for the Indians and also batted 
.425 with nine doubles, three triples, five home runs and 23 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
John Jones, an offensive lineman at Kennedy High, has signed a letter of intent 
to play football at Kansas. Jones signed after a three-day visit this week to 
the campus in Lawrence, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-2, 280-pound tackle anchored Kennedy's offensive line last fall and was 
selected to The Times' All-Valley team. He chose Kansas over Cal State 
Fullerton because of the Jayhawks' superior engineering program, according to 
Kennedy Coach Bob Francola. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Bruce, a catcher at Canoga Park High, was selected in the 19th round of 
the amateur baseball draft by the Seattle Mariners. Bruce (6-1, 185 pounds) 
batted .250 with four doubles in 44 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce said he has not decided whether to sign. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Melissa Thatcher of Agoura High and catcher Julie Coert from Santa 
Paula were named softball co-most valuable players in the Frontier League. 
Nordhoff's Rick Mohney and Agoura's Linda Moule were co-coaches of the year.

CSORBA CLAIMS STREET STOCK WIN AFTER RED FLAG

<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Hume of Ventura led the Street Stock 10-lap figure-eight main event for 
nine laps on Friday night and appeared en route to an easy victory at Ventura 
Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
However, the race ended prematurely when the car in last place, driven by Tom 
Stephens of Ventura, broadsided Hume. 
</P>
<P>
A red flag ended the race one lap early. 
</P>
<P>
The red flag gave the victory to Oxnard's John Csorba, who took over the season 
points leadership in the figure-eight division. Jon Christensen of Palmdale 
took second and Scott Olsen of Ventura third. 
</P>
<P>
After five re-starts and four yellow-flag delays, Jim Powell Jr. of Cypress 
drove to a 15-lap Street Stock oval-track main-event victory. Bill Famularo of 
Simi Valley finished a close second with Bill Pate of Oxnard third. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Silva of Port Hueneme drove to his first win of the season in the Mini 
Stock four-lap figure-eight main event. Randy Bingham of Camarillo and Terry 
Swauger of Ojai were second and third, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Rock Ake Jr. of Moorpark, Swauger, and Gary Curtis of Camarillo each won an 
eight-lap Mini Stock heat race.

Dean Wilkins can't wait until his niece, Alyssa, begins kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
On the day she was born, Sept. 18, 1989, Wilkins earned his first major league 
victory by pitching two shutout innings as the Chicago Cubs beat the New York 
Mets, 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Alyssa took her first step. Hours later, Wilkins was recalled by 
Chicago from Iowa, the Cubs' triple-A affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter's his good-luck charm," said Lori Wilkins, mother of Alyssa and 
sister of Dean. 
</P>
<P>
Richard and Diane Wilkins of Mira Mesa will not soon forget that day late last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning, their only daughter gave birth to their first grandchild. Later 
that evening, their youngest son won his first major league game. 
</P>
<P>
Call it delivery day. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, Richard left, as scheduled, on a five-day trip to Chicago to 
watch Dean pitch.

<P>
The Wilkins, Mira Mesa residents since 1970, have always been close. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, when asked who was most influential in his development as a player, 
Dean Wilkins simply responded: "My family." 
</P>
<P>
"Through Little League, high school (Mira Mesa) and junior college (Mesa), 
they're the ones who have helped me out the most," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins was drafted by the New York Yankees out of Mesa in the second round of 
the 1986 January draft and has been fairly successful. 
</P>
<P>
In his first season with Oneonta, one of the Yankees' Class-A clubs, he was 9-0 
with a 3.13 earned-run average as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins' break came when the Yankees traded him to the Cubs along with two 
other pitchers for Steve Trout in July, 1987. The Cubs made him a reliever and 
a prospect. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988 with the Pittsfield Cubs, he set an Eastern League (double-A) record 
with 26 saves and a 1.63 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"(The Cubs) have a lot of home-grown products, unlike the Yankees, who usually 
trade them away," Wilkins said. 
</P>
<P>
With the Cubs in the midst of a pennant race, Wilkins was twice called up in 
1989. The first stint lasted just 10 days (Aug. 21-31), but he was recalled 
again two days later when clubs were allowed to expand their rosters to 40 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Those Cubs won the National League East title, but because Wilkins was called 
up after the Sept. 1 deadline, he was ineligible for the playoffs, which the 
Cubs lost to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the lockout and expanded 27-man rosters, he began this year at the 
big league level but was sent down three weeks later with one save. 
</P>
<P>
He spent the next month and a half with Iowa compiling a 1-0 record, with four 
saves and a 2.67 ERA. In 27 innings, he struck out 26. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins' strikeout numbers have always been high -- he had 14 in 15 2/3 innings 
with the Cubs last year -- but his forkball, not a fastball, is his best pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins says that aside from superior skills, experience and discipline set 
major leaguers apart from those at other levels. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been there for five, 10, 15 years," Wilkins said. "You can't make as 
many mistakes in the big leagues." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Howard, from Brawley High and Imperial Valley Community College, is tearing 
up the South Atlanta League (Class A) for the Mets. Entering Friday, Howard, a 
second baseman, was hitting .385 with four home runs, 40 RBIs and 11 stolen 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Mike Hook, a Santana High graduate, is playing well for the Quad 
Cities Angels of the Midwest League (Class A). Hook is 3-1 with three saves, a 
0.52 ERA and 33 strikeouts in 17 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
A fine pitcher while at USDHS, Gar Millay, an outfielder for the Oklahoma City 
Rangers (triple A) was brought in for an inning of mop-up work earlier this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Result: Two hits, a walk and two runs. 
</P>
<P>
On the other end, Millay is hitting .294 with a home run and 17 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Clark might want to have a chat with Enoch Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
Christian High's Clark, who was the No. 2 pick in this week's free agent draft 
by the Detroit Tigers, would like to play basketball for Arizona and baseball 
for the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Simmons played in both the NCAA basketball tournament and a College 
World Series regional for Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after, he was drafted by the Oakland A's in the June draft. He hit .307 
that summer and came back in the fall for his senior year of basketball at 
Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
The next summer, Simmons hit just .222, and this year he's hitting just .097. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, Lincoln's Keith Mitchell (Durham Braves, Class A) has 
gone 21 for 55 with 15 runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
During that same period, Hoover's Eddie Williams (Las Vegas Padres, triple A) 
is 20 for 58 with six homers, 19 RBIs and 15 runs.

THE LARGER AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding: "Artist Sues the Rev. Wildmon Over Mailing" by Allan Parachini (May 
22): 
</P>
<P>
I found it encouraging that artist David Wojnarowicz has filed suit against the 
Rev. Donald Wildmon and his group -- encouraging because he's fighting back. 
He's letting the "traditional values" people know that they can't distort art 
and defame artists with impunity. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what the outcome is, the suit is a step in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
Wildmon claimed to be appealing to "the average American voter." Well, that's 
me, and I'm fed up with the "traditional values" people trying to make my world 
as narrow as theirs. 
</P>
<P>
In your article, you quote an arts law expert as saying that this art 
censorship may be ". . . incident to a larger agenda." That's the most chilling 
aspect of this entire controversy.

VIVISECTION RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I must express my dismay over "TV 'Adver-torial' Makes Fur Fly," by Greg 
Braxton (May 24). I am 100% against vivisection and applaud the article itself. 
</P>
<P>
But, as it points out, many TV stations are refusing to run Javier Burgos' 
commercial because viewing these animals in such distress is too upsetting for 
many people. An article with no pictures would have been sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine my surprise in perusing leisurely through each section of the paper and 
coming suddenly upon the picture of the cat (almost exactly like mine at home) 
with electrodes embedded in its head and its head restrained in a sling, on the 
front page of Calendar -- the entertainment/arts section of The Times. (I 
thought it was on the front page of View!) Your view of entertainment is 
extremely distorted. In my opinion, you fed right into the hands of Burgos and 
gave him exactly what he wanted -- and probably a wider audience to boot. All 
it gave me was a trip to the bathroom to get rid of my lunch!

A WISE FALL GUY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Ken Wahl's version is true (" 'Wiseguy' Plot Thickens, but Who's the Fall 
Guy Here?," by Irv Letofsky, June 2), it is unfortunate that Stephen Cannell 
believes that "Wiseguy" can continue without Wahl. 
</P>
<P>
The actor brought incredible depth to the character of Vinnie Terranova that 
undoubtedly cannot be matched. His portrayal is what made the show intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
It is always sad when quality programs such as "Wiseguy" go down because of 
behind-the-scenes battles. While "Wiseguy" is not dead yet, its demise is only 
a matter of time.

'PARADISE' LOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times failed to report in its May 30 story on the CBS fall schedule that 
the series "Paradise" did not make the cut. We are saddened by its departure, 
for it presented a new look at the Old West. 
</P>
<P>
The themes of "Paradise" were not your usual Western fare: a feared gunfighter 
struggling to adjust to domestic life and fatherhood; mine owners trading in 
opium to keep Chinese workers in line; a respected judge being exposed as a 
wife-beater; fear and discrimination against a mentally disabled person that 
almost led to his execution; a killer turned preacher. 
</P>
<P>
"Paradise" also was the only TV series to present a recurring positive 
portrayal of a youngster, wonderfully played by 10-year-old actor Brian Lando, 
who was coping very well with a slight stuttering speech disability. 
</P>
<P>
That is why we will be awarding "Paradise" (Lorimar Television, co-creators 
David Jacobs and Robert Porter and actor Lando) our first "Golden Block" award.

'SINGER &amp; SONS' OFFERS A COMIC SLICE OF DELI LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here comes couch potato salad. 
</P>
<P>
New York deli owner Nathan Singer (Harold Gould) frets about having no heirs to 
carry on the family business. 
</P>
<P>
"I need sons, right the hell now!" the aging widower says on the premiere of 
the NBC summer comedy "Singer &amp; Sons" (at 9:30 tonight on Channels 4, 36 
and 39). 
</P>
<P>
In a manner of speaking, he gets them in Mitchell (Bobby Hosea) and Reggie 
(Tommy Ford) Patterson, the adult sons of his housekeeper (Esther Rolle). And 
the way in which these feuding black brothers come to be fixtures in helping 
run a Jewish deli is pretty predictable fare. 
</P>
<P>
"Singer &amp; Sons" is where "Oy veh" and "What's happenin', man?" mingle. The 
deli's street-talking black waitress (Arnetia Walker) tells customers: "This 
food ain't changed since Moses." Neither have some of the jokes, unfortunately. 
</P>
<P>
But not all of them, for "Singer &amp; Sons" has a way of having fun with 
ethnic stereotypes without being offensive, while providing enough amusing 
moments to merit another tune-in when it returns in its regular time slot at 9 
p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The characters are likable, and co-creators Michael Jacobs and Bob Young have 
recruited a fine cast to play them. It's Gould who's the beef in this kosher 
soul-food sandwich, however. The premiere is at its best when he and that other 
grand trouper, Rolle, are interacting in front of the camera, and at its worst 
when the two brothers are bickering. HOWARD ROSENBERG

BRANFMAN EXPLORES THE POLITICS OF BRAZIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perched on a ledge high above the audience in a skimpy Brazilian bikini, Suchi 
Branfman launched the first performance of her political theater work, 
"Estangeiro/Foreigner," Thursday on the "Women's Work" series at Highways in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Her opening vignette -- partially an account of a Southern lady's vacation in 
the land of the bossa nova -- contained kernels of key themes of the piece 
(racism, repression and blithe indifference to same). 
</P>
<P>
But it did not prepare for her knockout movement style. 
</P>
<P>
A tensely electric performer, Branfman has the arresting capacity to move with 
lithe ease while channeling energy up into crisp arm and limb articulations. 
Whether in extended balances or in masterful parodies of the sensuous movements 
of the samba or the swagger of machismo, Branfman made points of stabbing 
clarity. 
</P>
<P>
She intercut such movement episodes with stories about Brazil or layered her 
storytelling with fierce, strong gestures. 
</P>
<P>
All is not well in that country. The national census classifies citizens 
according to degree of skin color although the "official" position, she says, 
is that there is no racism because "we are a mixed people." Yet a trip to the 
fabled beach of Ipanema shows police driving off the dark-skinned poor so that 
the rich tourists can party. 
</P>
<P>
(Ironically, the "indigenous" lambada turns out to be a dance created by French 
entrepreneurs, taught to a Brazilian couple and reimported to the country.) 
</P>
<P>
Against newspaper headlines that trumpet the beheading of homosexuals, Branfman 
juxtaposes taped excerpts from the appointment diary of a person with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Not all such juxtapositions seemed so clear, however. Although infused with 
strong moral purpose, Branfman seems to arbitrarily structure this segmented, 
but freely-flowing work, and individual sections can remain opaque. 
</P>
<P>
The work will repeat at 8:30 tonight.

NARY A BUDDY COP OR CAR CHASE IN UCLA VISION 1990 FESTIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: STUDENT FILMMAKERS SHOW A WILLINGNESS TO GO AGAINST THE HOLLYWOOD 
GRAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH KLEID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In UCLA student filmmaker Pam Tom's film "Two Lies," a Chinese-American mother 
has plastic surgery to change the shape of her eyes. Her two daughters are 
confused and hurt. "You know what they say about eyes like that in school," one 
daughter brashly tells her mother. "Two eyes . . . two lies." When the mother 
looks out from under her bandages, her vision is blurred. The audience sees a 
blurry world along with her. 
</P>
<P>
But the students showing their work at the UCLA Vision 1990 Festival, the third 
annual weeklong outpouring of UCLA film student work opening this afternoon, 
demonstrate a clear vision as they present films dealing with ethnicity, 
cultural diversity and global issues. There will be no buddy cops, car chases 
or Ninja turtles in UCLA's Melnitz Theater. There will be about 70 small films 
showing a trend among student filmmakers: a desire to speak in their own voices 
and a willingness to go against the Hollywood grain. 
</P>
<P>
As Tom, a fifth-generation Chinese-American whose parents own a downtown Los 
Angeles Chinatown restaurant explained, "It seems we're interested in stories 
that are close to home. Filmmakers like Spike Lee have allowed us to come into 
this voice." She said that dealing with personal issues motivates her. "Two 
Lies," which plays tonight, is based on something that happened to her 
relatives. "The film was painful to make, but that provided a certain amount of 
drive. I was so personally invested in it." 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Schwartz, chair of the UCLA Department of Film and Television, said that 
she has noticed a difference in this year's festival. "If there's a theme in 
this festival, it's diversity and independence," she said. "There's less 
conformity, fewer copycats than I've ever seen before." 
</P>
<P>
The diversity comes from a student body with an international flavor that 
Schwartz said is characteristic of the UCLA program. Student filmmakers come 
from China, Colombia, Germany and England. 
</P>
<P>
Anna Chi, a student who worked as a filmmaker in Beijing, will present her film 
"Silk Box" on Sunday; it's about a eunuch from the Forbidden City who befriends 
a young Asian-American boy. Chi said that she was encouraged by UCLA to make a 
film about her own culture. "I don't want to try to fit into Hollywood," she 
said. "I just want to use this medium to tell my stories." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the international students' films, there are films from American 
students unafraid to explore their ethnic backgrounds. "I have faith that the 
stories of Asian-Americans are important enough to watch," said Tom. "I grew up 
watching stories about white people, and I was able to translate them. So why 
can't white people translate our stories?" 
</P>
<P>
What happened to the words high concept and blockbuster? Many of the students 
seem undaunted by the industry and the box office. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I don't have a choice. No, I couldn't compromise even if I wanted 
to. There are not that many black female filmmakers out there. I have to do 
things with integrity. I take the images I create very seriously," said Los 
Angeles-native Karen Hayes, whose film "How It Is," about the gang culture in 
Los Angeles, runs tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Are these just a bunch of idealistic students who have yet to confront the real 
world? Or a fresh new breed of filmmakers? Henry Jaglom, an independent 
filmmaker known for "New Year's Day" who is speaking on the last night of the 
festival, said he has a hunch the tide is turning. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a period where kids thought they had to grow up to be Spielberg and 
Lucas," he said. "Now they realize they don't have to do big action-adventure 
films. They can find in film some human expression of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Still, festival organizers have invited some 3,000 industry people in an effort 
to expose the students' work to Hollywood bigwigs. Cameron Spencer, director of 
the festival, explained it simply: "I want to help the students get jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Screening time during the week is 7:30 p.m. General admission is $4. The 
festival opens this afternoon at 2 p.m. with a special screening from the 
British National Film School.

<P>
COALITION: SHAMIR'S NEW GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED TO EXPANDING SETTLEMENTS AND 
QUELLING THE PALESTINIAN UPRISING. U.S. PEACE EFFORTS APPEAR DOOMED. 
</P>

JERUSALEM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just hours before a sundown Friday deadline, caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Shamir cobbled together a new government committed to expanding Israeli 
settlements in the rebellious West Bank and Gaza Strip and squashing the 
Palestinian uprising. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of Shamir's Likud Party, far-right and religious groups appears 
to doom already flagging efforts by the Bush Administration to broker peace 
talks between Israel and Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition marks the first time since 1984 and the turmoil of the Lebanon 
invasion that Israel will be ruled by a fully right-wing government. A six-year 
era of national unity governments linking Likud with the center-left Labor 
Party fell apart over how to resolve Israel's conflict with the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir indirectly referred to the possible discord that might break out in a 
government that some describe as the most right-wing in Israel's history. 
</P>
<P>
"I pray that national unity will exist in this government that we are forming 
today and that all of us will act together for the Israeli people and the land 
of Israel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir will present his new Cabinet for approval in the Knesset, Israel's 
Parliament, on Monday. He is expected to win the support of at least 62 members 
in the 120-seat body. The narrow majority may widen if the Agudat Israel, a 
hold-out religious party, joins in. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, flying from Des Moines to Omaha on a political fund-raising 
trip, said he is willing to work with the new Israeli government. But he 
emphasized that U.S. policy will continue to urge peace talks between Israel 
and its foes in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leaders reacted negatively to the new government. Faisal Husseini, 
a top political leader of the 30-month-old Palestinian uprising in 
Israeli-occupied areas, said: "We believe peace efforts will be set back. This 
is a government that will put obstacles in the way of talks." 
</P>
<P>
The occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip on Friday appeared to be quiet, however. 
Many Palestinians were preparing to watch the opening match of the World Cup on 
television and seemed uninterested in Israel's politics of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's announcement ended three months of political drift that began when 
Labor Cabinet ministers quit a partnership government with Likud because he 
refused to accept the terms of an invitation from U.S. Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III to hold peace talks with Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
The new government's guidelines commit Shamir "to strengthen, expand and 
develop the settlements" in Gaza and the West Bank. The pledge puts Israel on a 
renewed collision course with Washington, which opposes settlements in the 
occupied territories as an obstacle to peace. 
</P>
<P>
The Shamir government also affirmed the right of newly arrived Soviet 
immigrants to settle in the occupied lands, another point of difference with 
the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
(In a Moscow news conference, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev repeated 
his threat to act if Israel continues to allow that kind of settlement. But 
notably, he did not repeat his threat to halt Jewish emigration.) 
</P>
<P>
Shamir appears poised to take tougher measures to put down the Palestinian 
revolt. Israeli soldiers and civilians have killed more than 650 Palestinians 
during the uprising, about 150 of them children; 44 Israelis have died at the 
hands of Palestinians and about 220 Palestinians have been killed by other 
Palestinians on suspicion of collaborating with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's government is pledged "to uproot the phenomenon of violence and 
disturbances and create tranquility in all parts of Israel." 
</P>
<P>
In an apparent effort to rally wide national support, Shamir said the new 
government's main goal is to ensure the smooth welcome for new Soviet 
immigrants. About 150,000 are expected to arrive this year alone. 
</P>
<P>
"The major effort of the government will be made on the most important issue we 
are facing today, the absorption of the mass immigration," he said. "Together 
with that, we'll deal with all the other issues -- advancing the peace process, 
solving economic and social problems." 
</P>
<P>
After six weeks of hard bargaining, Shamir ensured that his hold on the prime 
minister's post, dating to 1986, continues uninterrupted. His Cabinet lineup 
gives key posts to ministers in favor of keeping all the West Bank and Gaza, 
and all have spoken against Baker's peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
Among key members of the new Cabinet are Moshe Arens, the former foreign 
minister, who will become defense minister; David Levy, the outgoing housing 
minister and now foreign minister; Ariel Sharon, former defense minister, now 
housing minister, and Yitzhak Modai, former economics minister now in charge of 
finance. 
</P>
<P>
In the past government, Levy, Sharon and Modai were known as the "constraints 
ministers," or by critics, the "Gang of Three" because they campaigned 
vigorously against Baker's peace approach. 
</P>
<P>
Asked in a radio interview if he would encourage the newcomers to settle in the 
disputed land, Sharon replied, "Israel is a democratic country. Everyone can 
settle where he wants." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli commentators noted that Levy, a native of Morocco, will be the first 
Israeli foreign minister not to speak English. On Friday, he pointed out that 
he speaks good French. 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Eitan, from the small Crossroads Party, is a newcomer to the Cabinet and 
will head the Agriculture Ministry. Another newcomer, nuclear expert Yuval 
Neeman, will be science minister. 
</P>
<P>
The commitments made by the new government reaffirm support for Shamir's peace 
proposal, which included holding elections for a Palestinian negotiating team. 
But top aides to Shamir have hinted that he will try to take the spotlight off 
the vote proposal and steer debate to other points in his plan. These include 
talks with hostile Arab countries and foreign funding to help Palestinian 
refugees establish themselves in neighboring countries. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the plan to return to its original spirit," said Yosef Ben-Aharon, a 
senior adviser. Ben-Aharon and other Shamir supporters have accused the United 
States of distorting Shamir's effort by only emphasizing elections. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the Cabinet portfolios have been handed out yet. Religious parties 
are still vying for control of marriage, immigration and social matters as well 
as funding for education and housing. 
</P>
<P>
One religious group, Shas, reportedly gained control of the Communications 
Ministry and Israel's broadcasting system. 
</P>
<P>
During the six weeks of coalition talks, Shamir's continued hold on power 
sometimes seemed to depend as much on his taste in seafood as on as his 
attitude toward peace talks. One religious leader lambasted him for enjoying 
shellfish in disregard for Jewish dietary laws. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, Shamir had until midnight to forge a coalition, but the Jewish 
Sabbath began at sundown and any labor done after dark could have lost him the 
entire support of the religious parties. He met the deadline by informing 
President Chaim Herzog by phone of his success. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the coalition agreement, the government has pledged to ban sales of 
pork, a non-kosher commodity that is treated as a delicacy by some secular Jews 
in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party, meanwhile, prepared to go into the opposition. Its head, 
Shimon Peres, the former finance minister and a former prime minister, will 
probably have to fight off a leadership challenge from rival Yitzhak Rabin, who 
was minister of defense in the joint government under Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
KEY ISRAELI CABINET MEMBERS 
</P>
<P>
 Here are six of the people in Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's new rightist 
government. Several slots have not been announced yet. 
</P>
<P>
Moshe Arens, Defense Minister 
</P>
<P>
Protege of Shamir who served as foreign minister in the past government. Like 
Shamir, favors perpetual Israeli control of occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
David Levy, Foreign Minister 
</P>
<P>
Served as housing minister in the last government. Engineered government 
financial backing for the controversial purchase of a lease on a Greek Orthodox 
Church building in Jerusalem's Old City on behalf of a militant Jewish 
nationalist group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ariel Sharon, Housing Minister 
</P>
<P>
As defense minister in 1982, led Israel into Lebanon invasion. Campaigned for 
Defense Ministry job again. Will have special authority to manage fast-paced 
arrival of Soviet immigrants and can also possibly channel funds to West Bank 
and Gaza development. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Finance, Agriculture, Science. 
</P>
<P>
Three other members are Yitzhak Modai, finance minister; Rafael Eitan, 
agriculture minister and Yuval Neeman, science minister. Modai, former 
economics minister, once suggested sending Palestinian stone throwers into 
exile. In past government, Levy, Sharon and Modai were known as "constraints 
ministers" because they campaigned against U.S.-brokered peace plan. Eitan is 
from small Crossroads Party and a newcomer to Cabinet. Chief of staff during 
Lebanon invasion, he once referred to Palestinians as "cockroaches in a 
bottle." Neeman is nuclear expert whose Tehiya Party advocates annexing the 
West Bank and Gaza.

'WINNERS' GET A BIG SPIN, GO DIRECTLY TO JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For more than 200 suspected and convicted felons, the offer proved irresistible 
-- 100 free lottery tickets, with a chance to win as much as $50,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
But what was billed as a marketing survey to evaluate the state's lottery games 
was in reality a sting operation run by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department. The "Big-Play winners" ended up old-fashioned losers -- booked at 
the sheriff's Lakewood jail over the last five days on outstanding warrants 
charging them with everything from probation violation to manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
"A while back, we were talking over what sort of an operation to set up," 
Sheriff's Sgt. John F. Andrews said Friday, the final day of the sting. "We 
decided, let's go with greed. It works every time." 
</P>
<P>
So the officers -- frustrated thespians all -- set up a storefront operation in 
Bellflower, complete with balloons bearing the logo of a fictitious lottery 
game called "Big-Play," posters of "$50,000 winners" (actually pictures of 
undercover Sheriff's Department clerks), and lots of jolly "Southbay Marketing 
Services" employees played by undercover deputies to welcome the "winners." 
</P>
<P>
Even after being handcuffed, some of the stunned targets of the sting continued 
to hope for good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them tell us they know they're under arrest, but they ask, 'Do I still 
get my tickets?' " Deputy Bernadette Roberts recalled. "One gentleman, even as 
he was being booked, still kept hoping he was on 'Candid Camera.' One woman 
asked if we could send her winnings to Sybil Brand," the women's jail in East 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Moreno, a 24-year-old Cambria resident wanted for failure to appear at his 
scheduled arraignment on a drug-possession charge, was in many respects typical 
of those invited to the tidy offices at 10042 Artesia Place during the five-day 
sting. 
</P>
<P>
Along with about 5,000 other Southern Californians wanted on outstanding 
warrants, Moreno had received a letter in the mail a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Congratulations," the letter said. "You have been randomly selected by 
computer as a WINNER! Your guaranteed prize includes 100 FREE lottery tickets. 
Of course, this means ASH$ for you, and a chance to spin your way to a fortune. 
. . . Simply call our Hotline at 1 (800) 468-PLAY as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 answered the letter. "We even got a call from a guy in prison in 
Susanville," Sheriff's Sgt. Paul Scauzillo said. "He said he wasn't getting out 
until Aug. 6. He wondered if he could come in then." 
</P>
<P>
Moreno, too, called the number and agreed to come by 9 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Like about half of those who made appointments, Moreno showed up as promised, 
to be greeted at the door by a group of friendly "Southbay employees." They 
shook his hand, offered him some coffee and cookies and gave him a chair to sit 
in while they checked his identification to make sure he was the right Luis 
Moreno. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of people who have tried to scam us," Scauzillo said. "They 
walk in and try to pretend they're someone who's gotten one of the invitations. 
We have to send them away." 
</P>
<P>
While the deputies checked, Moreno rubbed elbows happily with a mob of news 
reporters and photographers, all invited by the Sheriff's Department to watch 
the sting. Like the other "winners," Moreno was told that the news media were 
there to record his good fortune. The newspeople played along with the game. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of deputies posing as winners wandered out the front door, receiving 
the good wishes of all those gathered. Then a beaming Scauzillo burst noisily 
into the room. 
</P>
<P>
"Congratulations!" he shouted. "Luis, you're a winner!" 
</P>
<P>
Offered a choice of Dodger or Angel tickets -- "good seats, for Saturday's 
game, you'll be driven there in a limo" -- Moreno chose the Dodgers. If he knew 
the Angels would be out of town, he never said anything. 
</P>
<P>
And then, to a mounting crescendo of applause from an unseen audience in a room 
at the rear of the building, Moreno was led around a screen and into the hands 
of the law. 
</P>
<P>
In the back room, to his chagrin, he discovered that the people who'd been 
clapping and cheering were uniformed deputies. Instead of lottery and baseball 
tickets, he got a set of plastic handcuffs and a booking slip. 
</P>
<P>
Moreno seemed bewildered. Asked if he knew what was going on, he said he wasn't 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Bob Mallon said that while most of those arrested glumly accepted their 
fate, some tried to rationalize. 
</P>
<P>
"A handful said they knew it was a sting operation all along," Mallon said. "So 
why did they show up?" 
</P>
<P>
By nightfall Friday, about 250 people had been suckered in by the scam, with 
roughly 90% of them booked on felony warrants and the rest on assorted 
misdemeanor counts. 
</P>
<P>
Most were cases involving the Sheriff's Department, but a few stemmed from 
efforts by the Beverly Hills Police Department, which joined in after planning 
a similar sting. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many police departments devised stings to bring in fugitives 
and collect evidence against those suspected of criminal behavior who otherwise 
had been able to elude arrest. Despite persistent publicity about these stings, 
law enforcement officers say they remain effective. In the case of those 
rounded up this week, deputies did not know the whereabouts of the fugitives 
but generally were able to find addresses of a relative. They sent the 
invitations to these addresses in hope that -- because of their appeal -- the 
mail would be forwarded. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies also consider stings relatively safe for all involved. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shotgun approach," Andrews admitted. "But it's economical, and no one 
was injured -- no officers, no suspects. We consider it a success." 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department emphasized that the sting was not officially connected 
to the California Lottery and said it had been cleared with lottery security 
personnel before it was undertaken. Lottery officials, while not encouraging 
stings using lottery materials, said they always cooperate with law enforcement 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its current lack of enthusiasm for such operations, the California 
Lottery once conducted a sting of its own. In March, 1986, 16 people suspected 
of submitting phony tickets were arrested after being lured to a bogus 
"second-chance" drawing in Sacramento that purported to offer prizes ranging 
from ocean cruises to cash. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the Sheriff's Department had run at least one similar operation 
in the past.

ARTIFICIAL BLOOD FROM COW HEMOGLOBIN PASSES TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new form of artificial blood made from cow hemoglobin has been successfully 
tested in humans for the first time, a Boston-based company said Friday. The 
finding is a major step forward in the quest for blood substitutes that would 
both increase the blood supply and greatly reduce the risk of viral infections 
resulting from transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
The tests on the artificial blood were conducted on 10 volunteers in Guatemala 
because the Food and Drug Administration has not yet given approval for testing 
in the United States, officials of Biopure Corp. said at a New York City press 
conference sponsored by the Guatemalan mission to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. researchers were pleased, but remained cautious about the finding because 
it has not been replicated elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"If it really works out and the data are there to support their conclusion, 
this would be a significant advance," said hematologist George Nemo of the 
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Md. "It's very 
encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly would be very exciting if it's correct," said hematologist Helen 
Ranney of the San Diego Veterans Administration Hospital, "but we would have to 
be fairly cautious about wider applications without further studies." 
</P>
<P>
The development of a blood substitute has been a major thrust of the biomedical 
community in the last decade because of many different problems with the blood 
supply. Currently, the world has a shortage of about 100 million units of blood 
per year, according to Carl Rausch, president of Biopure. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem is the transmission of infectious diseases. Acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome is not considered a major problem, but about 250,000 of the 
4 million Americans who receive a blood transfusion each year contract 
hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time you take blood, it's like putting a quarter in a slot machine," 
said hematologist Charles Huggins of Massachusetts General Hospital. "If you 
are unlucky and come up with three lemons, you can get hepatitis or something 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Whole blood is also very expensive to collect, store and administer. It is 
perishable, and cannot be stored for more than three weeks, even in 
refrigerators. It therefore cannot be used routinely for treatment of accident 
victims and battlefield casualties. The military, especially, would like to 
have a blood substitute that would remain stable for months or years. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, if blood types are not matched carefully before a transfusion, the 
recipient can suffer a fatal reaction. Researchers would like to find a 
substitute that could be used universally. 
</P>
<P>
Although scientists have had some success with inert compounds called 
fluorocarbons, much of the recent research has centered on an iron-containing 
protein called hemoglobin. Each red blood cell in the human body contains about 
5 billion hemoglobin molecules. These molecules bind to oxygen in the lungs, 
then release it elsewhere in the body where it is needed. 
</P>
<P>
Many researchers have experimented with extracting hemoglobin from human red 
cells and injecting it directly into the blood stream. But hemoglobin is so 
small that the kidneys clear it out of the bloodstream in a few hours. Most 
physicians agree that an effective blood substitute must persist in the 
bloodstream for 48 to 60 hours. 
</P>
<P>
One solution to this problem is to chemically link individual hemoglobin 
molecules together into a much larger molecule, or polymer, that persists in 
the blood. 
</P>
<P>
Several different groups have experimented with human hemoglobin and shown that 
the polymer is a safe and effective substitute for blood in a variety of 
animals, including rodents, dogs and primates. 
</P>
<P>
But not much human hemoglobin is available. It would be obtained from outdated 
blood, and possibly no more than 3% of the 14 million units collected in the 
United States is discarded each year. 
</P>
<P>
Many researchers have thus turned to cow hemoglobin -- a prospect that is not 
as outrageous as it might seem. Hemoglobin is not easily rejected, and cow 
hemoglobin is similar to its human counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
The use of bovine hemoglobin to replace human hemoglobin, researchers say, is 
little different than the use of insulin from pigs to treat human diabetics, a 
process that is widespread. 
</P>
<P>
Bovine hemoglobin is also plentiful. An estimated 70 million cows are 
slaughtered in this country every year, and each has 5 to 7 gallons of blood, 
most of which goes to waste. 
</P>
<P>
Biopure and other companies have polymerized cow hemoglobin and shown that it 
is as effective in animals as polymerized human hemoglobin, but the companies 
have not yet been able to carry out human trials in this country. 
</P>
<P>
The delay was caused by discouraging results obtained with polymerized human 
hemoglobin in human experiments conducted by Northfield Laboratories Inc., of 
Northfield, Ill. Northfield found no side effects when they infused the human 
product into healthy individuals. But when five anemic individuals were infused 
with the product, they complained of chest pains, dizziness, and general 
discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
At a March 14 meeting of researchers, the FDA recommended that no further human 
studies be conducted until the problems were investigated. 
</P>
<P>
Biopure officials believe the adverse reaction was caused by impurities in the 
Northfield preparation that are not present in theirs, which is produced by a 
slightly different process. They encouraged their Guatemalan licensee, 
Hemo-Innovations, to conduct the studies at the Herrera Llerandi Hospital, 
which is affiliated with Francisco Marroquin University in Guatemala City. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Rudolf Garcia-Gallont first injected about a pint of the material into 
himself on Feb. 13. When that was successful, he injected a similar amount into 
nine volunteers from the United States, Guatemala, the Netherlands and 
Switzerland. They found that there were no negative responses and no side 
effects or discomfort to the volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"I started it with myself and I felt good enough to inform everybody that we 
have done it in Guatemala," Garcia-Gallont said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The results were announced in a press conference rather than a formal paper 
because "we want to share the information with the international community 
because of the urgent need for a blood substitute," said Guatemala's U.N. 
Ambassador, Francisco Villagran de Leon. 
</P>
<P>
The company has sent the information about the tests to the FDA, and the 
president of Guatemala, Vincio Cerezo, has invited the Pan American Health 
Organization to participate in the continuing experiments.

America is raising a generation of adolescents plagued by pregnancies, illegal 
drug use, suicide and violence, a panel that included medical and education 
leaders reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We are absolutely convinced that, if we don't take action immediately, we're 
going to find ourselves with a failing economy and social unrest," said Roseann 
Bentley of the National Assn. of State Boards of Education. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's report concluded that "young people are less healthy and less 
prepared to take their places in society than were their parents." 
</P>
<P>
The 36-member panel gathered statistics that, Bentley said, astonished 
commission members. Among the trouble signs were: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1 million teen-age girls -- nearly 1 in 10 -- get pregnant each year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 39% of high school seniors reported they had gotten drunk within the two 
previous weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Alcohol-related accidents are the leading cause of death among teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The suicide rate for teen-agers has doubled since 1968, making it the 
second-leading cause of death among adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Teen-age arrests are up thirtyfold since 1950. 
</P>
<P>
Inattention to these problems has left thousands of young people doomed to 
failure, "which for many will be a precursor to an adult life of crime, 
unemployment or welfare dependency," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission was formed by the National Assn. of State Boards of Education 
and the American Medical Assn. to make recommendations on the role of the 
school and community in improving adolescent health. 
</P>
<P>
The commission recommended that teen-agers be guaranteed access to health 
services, regardless of their ability to pay. That health care should include 
psycho-social as well as medical services, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
It said communities should set up adolescent health centers in schools or other 
convenient places that would be financed by local, state and federal funds and 
by private money. 
</P>
<P>
The commission called on schools to play a larger role in improving 
adolescents' health. It suggested "a new kind of health education -- a 
sophisticated multifaceted program that goes light years beyond present 
lectures about personal hygiene." Such a program should include sex education, 
the panel said.

ALLEGED SPY CALLED BRILLIANT, ERRATIC; 
</P>
<P>
ESPIONAGE: AN FBI AGENT TESTIFIES THAT THE EX-SOLDIER ADMITTED SELLING NATO 
SECRETS. A SEARCH FOR SOME OF THE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS IS UNDER WAY. 
</P>

An ex-Army sergeant charged in one of the most significant espionage schemes 
ever uncovered appeared in court in Tampa, Fla., on Friday, while federal 
agents there searched three sites for top-secret documents that the former 
soldier allegedly hoped to sell to foreign agents. 
</P>
<P>
An FBI investigator described the ex-GI, Roderick James Ramsay, as a brilliant 
but erratic man who had admitted being paid thousands of dollars for passing to 
East Bloc agents top-secret NATO documents detailing the nuclear defense of 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The government testimony suggested that Ramsay, 28, now an unemployed taxi 
driver, was among the most important figures in an espionage ring that the 
chief federal investigator described Friday as "one of the most serious 
breaches ever." 
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. and West German officials, Ramsay, working in collaboration 
with an Army superior convicted of treason earlier this week, handed over to 
the KGB information that would have gravely endangered the capability of the 
West to defend itself in the event of a Soviet attack. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agent Joe Navarro, a specialist in counterintelligence and espionage, said 
the information turned over to the East Bloc agents by Ramsay "in effect 
neutralized" the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, because Warsaw Pact 
nations "knew all our plans." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a significant case from the point of view of damage to U.S. security 
interests," said Justice Department spokesman Doug Tillet. "It involves an 
extensive amount of information provided to the Soviet intelligence service 
through Eastern Europe surrogates." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that Ramsay, whose court hearing was continued until next week, 
had been cooperating with authorities. The ex-sergeant, represented by a 
court-appointed attorney, did not make a statement during the 90-minute 
proceedings. His mother, Dorothy Ramsay, cried as deputy marshals took Ramsay 
from the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Ramsay is charged with conspiracy to gather or deliver defense information to a 
foreign government. The charge carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials described Ramsay as a junior but important partner of 
then-Army Sgt. Clyde Lee Conrad, who was convicted of treason in a West German 
court earlier this week. The two men had worked together in the mid-1980s as 
archive clerks with top-secret clearance at U.S. Army 8th Infantry Headquarters 
in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
One law enforcement official said the government feared that what had been 
learned so far about the spy ring represented "just the tip of the iceberg" in 
a case that may have involved half a dozen soldiers and a wide range of 
national security secrets. He said also that the operation may have continued 
long after the two men left the Army. 
</P>
<P>
In the Tampa hearing Friday, Navarro said that Ramsay "had the ability to 
recall minute details, facts and figures -- some from documents he hadn't seen 
in five or six years." Ramsay also hid top-secret documents in his mother's 
residence in Tampa and had planned to sell them in the future, the federal 
agent told U.S. Magistrate Elizabeth Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials said Ramsay claimed to have destroyed the documents two years 
ago, but sources close to the investigation said the FBI hoped to recover them 
Friday, when it served search warrants at the home of Ramsay's mother and two 
other sites linked to the former Army sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro described Ramsay as an enigmatic man who had a high IQ and spoke 
Japanese, Spanish and German. He once told of trying to rob a bank in Vermont, 
Navarro said. In recent months, Ramsay had been sleeping in his car near his 
mother's home, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro said Ramsay admitted to him in interviews dating back to at least April 
that he had participated in spying with Conrad, beginning in 1983, when Conrad 
recruited him. Ramsay said he initially used a 35-millimeter camera to 
photograph the classified documents, but then switched to more effective 
videotape. 
</P>
<P>
According to Navarro, Ramsay recorded a total of about 45 hours of videotape. 
</P>
<P>
In an affidavit supporting the criminal complaint against Ramsay in Tampa, the 
agent said Ramsay told of providing Conrad with classified materials on the use 
of tactical nuclear weapons by the United States and its NATO allies, military 
communications and general defense plans for Central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro said a significant number of the documents carried "top-secret" 
classification, and many were even more sensitive. According to the FBI agent, 
Ramsay said he knew the classified documents had been given to agents of the 
Hungarian and Czechoslovakian intelligence services. 
</P>
<P>
Ramsay, a native of Honolulu, joined the Army in November, 1981, and attended 
basic training at Ft. Benning, Ga., according to Army records. 
</P>
<P>
After being assigned as a mortar man to the 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry in Ft. 
Riley, Kan., he was transferred to West Germany in June, 1983, where he worked 
as a clerk-typist in the archives of the plans unit of the 8th Infantry 
Division. He left the service as a sergeant in November, 1985.

Vietnam arrested and expelled an American English teacher for allegedly 
threatening national security and possessing secret documents, Hanoi radio and 
the teacher's sponsoring organization said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said the expulsion appears to be part of a widening crackdown on 
foreigners and internal dissidents meant to prevent Eastern European-style 
democratization in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Hanoi radio said Miriam Hershberger, 35, an English teacher at the Hanoi 
Foreign Languages School since July, was expelled from Vietnam on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"During her stay in Vietnam, Miriam Hershberger tried to use foreign papers 
opposing the socialist regime in Vietnam to teach students," the radio said. 
"The Vietnamese security agency also searched her living place and confiscated 
documents containing national secrets of Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
Hershberger, whose hometown was not immediately known, declined to comment. Her 
sponsoring organization, the Mennonite Central Committee, an American 
humanitarian group, denied the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
It said school authorities had asked Hershberger to teach newspaper reading. 
</P>
<P>
"At no time prior to her deportation did anyone inform her that her teaching 
methods or materials were objectionable," the Mennonites' statement said.

TURNBERRY, Scotland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization offered Friday to 
"extend the hand of friendship" to the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies. 
</P>
<P>
A communique from the 16-member Western Alliance said they welcomed the 
declaration of the Warsaw Pact meeting in Moscow on Thursday expressing the 
readiness for "constructive cooperation" with NATO countries. 
</P>
<P>
"We are encouraged by the positive spirit conveyed in this declaration and in 
particular by the readiness on the part of the countries issuing it for 
constructive cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner, in closing the two-day meeting on the 
west coast of Scotland, declared that the "message of Turnberry" was future 
"friendly and cooperative" relations with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
However, at a news conference, Woerner turned down suggestions that NATO should 
invite members of the Warsaw Pact to join the Western Alliance. Such 
initiatives should come from the individual nations themselves, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We leave it to them to decide the future of the Warsaw Pact," Woerner. "We 
leave it to them to decide on membership in the (NATO) alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Woerner said suggestions that NATO and the Warsaw Pact nations make a joint 
declaration were premature, since the pact has not completed its 
"re-evaluation" of its future. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the foreign ministers had been 
"laying the foundation" for next month's NATO summit meeting in London. At that 
gathering, the leaders of the Western Alliance are expected to chart a new 
course for NATO adopting a military strategy geared to a greatly lessened 
threat from the Soviet Union and increasing the political dimension of the 
alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Baker also praised the NATO statement extending the hand of friendship to the 
Soviet Union and Eastern European nations. 
</P>
<P>
The NATO communique gave the "highest priority" to reaching a conventional arms 
accord (CFE) in Vienna by the end of the year and Baker indicated that the 
alliance approved U.S. proposals on reduction of armor and aircraft as well as 
verification procedures in those talks. 
</P>
<P>
It called for talks on the reduction of short-range nuclear weapons in Europe 
as soon as a CFE agreement is completed in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, it insisted on an "appropriate mix" of conventional and nuclear 
forces in the alliance, "at the lowest levels consistent with our security 
needs." 
</P>
<P>
Once again, NATO declared that German unification is a "major contribution to 
stability in Europe" and supported a unified Germany's freedom to chose its 
alliance membership. 
</P>
<P>
On the touchy issue of Lithuania, the ministers said "it is our understanding 
that the leaders of Lithuania and the Soviet Union have indicated their 
willingness to begin a dialogue upon the suspension -- and not retraction" of 
the Lithuanian declaration of independence."

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ruzena Nemcova, 93, shuffled slowly up the steps to Vitezna Plan High School, 
her 25-year-old grandson supporting her with both hands. It was 20 minutes 
after the polls opened in Czechoslovakia on Friday, but Nemcova did not want to 
be late. 
</P>
<P>
"Forty years," she said. "Forty years and elections meant nothing. But this one 
is different." 
</P>
<P>
Others in the line made way for her to the front of the queue, and her 
grandson, Jan Bejcek, found a chair for her in the polling office, while the 
election officers checked her name off the rolls. Then Bejcek ushered her 
slowly to the curtained booth. 
</P>
<P>
She was beaming when she came out. 
</P>
<P>
Similar scenes were being played out all over Czechoslovakia on Friday, as the 
first of about 11.2 million registered voters streamed to the polls, despite 
rainy weather, to administer the formal coup de grace to the totalitarian 
Communist power that held sway here from 1946 until last November, when massive 
street demonstrations ousted the Communists from power. 
</P>
<P>
Civic Forum, the umbrella organization that led last November's movement, is 
expected to dominate the elections, along with its sister organization in 
Slovakia, called Public Against Violence. An alliance of Christian Democratic 
parties, which includes three separate groups, is also expected to run well. 
The Communists, pollsters say, could draw around 10% of the vote, much of it 
expected to come from small towns and the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
Polls remained open until 11 p.m. and will reopen again today until 2 p.m. At 
least partial unofficial results are expected a few hours after the polls close 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"We owe all this to Vaclav Havel and Charter 77," said Jan Durec, 62, also 
voting shortly after the polls opened at the Vitezna Plan High School, in an 
old, working-class area of Prague. Havel, now president of Czechoslovakia (and 
virtually certain of being reelected by the new Parliament whose members were 
being chosen in this election) was one of the founders of the Charter 77 human 
rights organization in 1977, a group which formed the core of the opposition 
movement here until Civic Forum was born in November. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy today," Durec said, a comment widely echoed among other voters 
Friday. "I have been wanting this for 40 years, waiting for it all the time. If 
I were not a man, I would be crying now. We owe everything to Havel and Charter 
77, who led this society to free elections." 
</P>
<P>
Durec said "everyone, absolutely everyone" of his friends were planning to 
vote, an assessment that supports the expectations of pollsters of a 90% 
turnout. "Everyone was looking forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
At stake are 300 seats in a new federal Parliament, as well as republican 
parliaments for the Czech and Slovak republics. 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the vote, the campaign, which had been conducted in an almost 
stately calm, flared with accusations of dirty tricks, with most of the 
accusations aimed at Civic Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The People's Party, one of three in the Christian Democratic Union, made an 
official complaint about charges that its leader had been a secret police 
agent. Josef Bartoncik, head of the People's Party, met with Havel, who said 
only that he retained confidence in Jan Ruml, the deputy interior minister who 
made the accusation most recently, asserting in a television interview 
Wednesday that Bartoncik was "unfit to hold public office." 
</P>
<P>
Former Communist hard-line leader Milos Jakes, who, along with six other former 
Communist leaders was questioned by prosecutors for two days this week, said he 
was being used as a political football. 
</P>
<P>
"It is part of various pre-election attempts to gain more votes," Jakes 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
Among those questioned was Jakes' predecessor, Gustav Husak, who was among the 
prominent persons shown voting Friday on national television. He declined 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
At stake in Czechoslovakia's elections are 300 seats in the two-chamber 
national Parliament, or Federal Assembly, 200 seats in the regional parliament 
of the Czech republic and 150 seats in the regional parliament of the smaller 
Slovak republic. The Federal Assembly must draft a new Czechoslovak 
constitution and elect a president, virtually certain to be the incumbent, 
Vaclav Havel. The parties that are favored to lead are the Civic Forum and its 
Slovak partner organization, Public Against Violence, which led last winter's 
peaceful revolution against Communist rule. A key issue is the status of 
Slovakia. Under the current federation created by the Communists in 1968, 
Slovakia is allotted half the federal funds, although it has only about 
one-third of Czechoslovakia's 15.6 million citizens.

GORBACHEV, REASSURED BY THATCHER, OFFERS MOVEMENT ON GERMAN UNITY;

<P>
EUROPE: THE SOVIET PRESIDENT PROPOSES LINKING NATO AND THE WARSAW PACT AS 
PARTNERS.

<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev showed new flexibility on the key issue in 
Europe's future, the status of united Germany, after British Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher assured him Friday that Kremlin security concerns will be 
respected as its No. 1 military ally is absorbed by the West. 
</P>
<P>
At a subsequent news conference, the Soviet president proposed the creation of 
new institutions linking a radically changed Warsaw Pact and NATO "as partners 
rather than as enemies" to hasten the end of the East-West divide epitomized by 
the two Germanys, now on the road to reunification. 
</P>
<P>
In wide-ranging remarks at a joint news conference with Thatcher, Gorbachev 
also repeated his threat to act if Israel continues to allow settlement of 
Soviet immigrants on territories seized in the 1967 Six-Day War. But in a 
notable departure from what he said five days earlier in Washington, he did not 
specifically threaten to halt Jewish emigration. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev stressed that he is open to new ideas on the future of Germany, 
though he noted that he still has the "same approaches." 
</P>
<P>
"I think I would not unveil any great secret by saying that there have emerged 
of late some specific things which are worth thinking about and discussing," he 
said. His talks last week with President Bush in Washington and at Camp David 
provided "food for thought for both sides," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"My central idea is that we should not confine ourselves to one option, an 
option that would necessarily turn out to be one-sided," Gorbachev told the 
packed auditorium at the Soviet Foreign Ministry Press Center. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats said the Soviet leader's remarks were highly significant for 
what they omitted. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, he didn't flat rule out Germany belonging to NATO alone," 
said one who attended the hourlong news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev received the Conservative British prime minister as both the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization and Warsaw Pact were seeking a new role in a 
Europe where their reason for existence -- the perceived threat from the other 
-- has vanished or is fast disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow on Thursday, Gorbachev and the other Warsaw Pact leaders declared 
their intention to transform their seven-nation alliance, formed 35 years ago, 
into a chiefly political body by November. 
</P>
<P>
However, as confrontation between the blocs recedes, Gorbachev has rejected 
Western proposals that a unified Germany be allowed to belong to NATO without 
also being a member of the Warsaw Pact, to which East Germany belongs. Last 
month, Gorbachev even said the West's point of view could force the Kremlin to 
rethink its approach to all negotiations involving European security and 
disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
British officials, however, said Thatcher, an outspoken advocate of NATO 
membership for Germany, discussed with Gorbachev a nine-point U.S. plan aimed 
at allaying Soviet concerns. In their two-hour conversation, she assured him 
that no NATO forces would be stationed in what is now East Germany and that 
Soviet troops could remain there for a "transitional period," they said. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's aides said the meeting left her feeling more confident that the 
East-West deadlock over Germany can be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister felt encouraged," one official told British reporters. 
"People have not adopted fixed positions." 
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, Thatcher told reporters that she and Gorbachev 
"discussed the consequences of the unification of Germany. The Soviet Union and 
the Warsaw Pact will require some assurance to be sure of their own security. 
We must find ways ahead to provide that assurance." 
</P>
<P>
She pointedly noted, however, that East Germany is moving toward becoming part 
of West Germany, and not the other way around. And West Germany, she said, is a 
member of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
In an open difference of opinion with Thatcher, who first met with Gorbachev in 
1984 before he became Soviet leader, Gorbachev called for a "new relationship" 
between the two alliances that would blur boundaries between them by giving 
these two offspring of the Cold War common institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"If from yesterday's statement there emerges a new Warsaw Pact and if NATO does 
not engage in maneuvers or pretenses, the emergence of new institutions is 
possible," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
He specifically mentioned the possibility that one alliance "would accept in 
its midst a country from another alliance." 
</P>
<P>
However, Thatcher, seated on Gorbachev's left, said, "I do not at the moment 
see those common bodies emerging." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader, with whom Thatcher has a clear rapport despite their vast 
ideological differences, smiled and said her reserve was because she is a "more 
cautious, more experienced politician." 
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, Gorbachev was asked by a reporter to clarify earlier 
remarks he had made about Jewish emigration. On Sunday, at the end of the 
U.S.-Soviet summit in Washington, he had said that the Kremlin might suspend 
its relaxed emigration policy and again prevent Jews from leaving unless Israel 
provides guarantees that Soviet citizens will not be settled in the occupied 
West Bank or Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, a senior State Department official said Foreign Minister Eduard 
A. Shevardnadze had given assurances to Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
that the liberal emigration policy would remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
A new Israeli government formed Friday specifically reasserted the right of new 
immigrants to choose where to live. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the reporter's question, Gorbachev was vague: "We hope that 
Israel will listen to what was said in Washington. . . . If the situation is 
such that it is necessary to react, we'll have to use our sovereign rights and 
competences to have an influence." 
</P>
<P>
That language appeared to reserve other options for the Kremlin besides 
shutting down Jewish emigration, a step that would chill improved U.S.-Soviet 
relations and endanger an upgraded U.S. trading status for the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
Greeting Thatcher in the Kremlin at the start of their seventh meeting in as 
many years, Gorbachev said he still felt jet-lagged from his visit to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday, I almost fell asleep during the Warsaw Treaty meeting," he said as 
he and Thatcher posed for photographers. Thatcher later said they had "very 
interesting, deep and friendly discussions." 
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, she praised Gorbachev for embarking on "the biggest 
changes, the most historic changes" in modern-day Europe, and singled out his 
program to inaugurate a range of market-style reforms to replace traditional 
Soviet central planning. 
</P>
<P>
Those proposals have aroused widespread worry and concern as well as opposition 
from radical and conservative members of the Soviet legislature. Using the 
televised news conference as a forum, Gorbachev again called on his countrymen 
to be calm. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to emphasize one thing: There is no need to be scared," he said. He 
said economic need, and not an ideological veering away from socialism, was 
behind the shift to what is being termed a "regulated market." 
</P>
<P>
"Our main concern is that we have empty shelves," Gorbachev said. "That is why 
we need a market economy." 
</P>
<P>
On the second day of a four-day visit, Thatcher also held talks with Prime 
Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and the defense minister, Marshal Dmitri T. Yazov. 
Today she is to fly to Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, to visit a British trade 
exposition.

RIOJA, Peru 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Novelist Mario Vargas Llosa this week brought his campaign into the ruins of a 
deadly earthquake and found the political aftershocks to be as divisive as the 
presidential race itself. 
</P>
<P>
Some people cheered him as his horn-honking caravan passed by the rubble of 
collapsed adobe-brick homes and families huddled under plastic sheeting in the 
narrow streets. They applauded his center-right coalition, the Democratic 
Front, for providing some of the first relief aid to the ravaged jungle region. 
</P>
<P>
But other residents of Rioja and nearby smaller towns grumbled that the 
candidate was exploiting their suffering. 
</P>
<P>
There was no lack of signs of the polarization that has split Peru on the road 
to Sunday's election, in which, polls show, Vargas Llosa has all but drawn even 
with centrist front-runner Alberto Fujimori, a little-known agronomist and 
political novice who portrays himself as a champion of the downtrodden. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake struck at 9:30 p.m. on May 29, killing about 60 people and 
causing immense damage to the poorly built houses in this remote farming area 
northeast of Lima. More than a week later, most victims are still fending for 
themselves, with little evidence of organized assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest need now is shelter. Repeated aftershocks threaten the cracked, 
weakened structures, so families camp in the streets or in their yards rather 
than stay indoors, despite the frequent jungle downpours. That has raised 
concern about respiratory and other infections. Residents are crying out for 
tents and, more important, for aid that will allow them to rebuild more safely. 
</P>
<P>
Although the earthquake was a magnitude 6.3, seismologists note that similar 
quakes in developed countries cause far less damage because of better 
construction methods and materials. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas Llosa's principal objective was to deliver an enormous tent, designed to 
provide shelter for 500 people, to the town of Soritor, about 20 miles 
southeast of Rioja. But the tent itself became a symbol of the divisions 
bedeviling this poor country of 22 million. 
</P>
<P>
It arrived Tuesday, a day before the candidate, aboard a 30-year-old Electra 
cargo plane, at the airport in Rioja, a city of 27,000 where well over half the 
homes have been damaged beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
Many Rioja residents were angry that the $25,000 tent, donated by one of the 
companies that endorse Vargas Llosa's campaign, was destined for Soritor, a 
much smaller town whose suffering has been better publicized. 
</P>
<P>
The tent was trucked from the airport to Soritor, but the steel poles that were 
to form its frame were dumped on the central plaza in Rioja. A crowd quickly 
formed, demanding that the tent stay in Rioja. Security police impounded the 
steel tubes, saying they could not be removed from the town square without 
permission. Arguments flared through the evening in the plaza, where several 
families are living in small tents and impromptu plastic shelters facing the 
ruined Roman Catholic church and the lopsided town hall. 
</P>
<P>
Only the next day, shortly before Vargas Llosa's small chartered plane landed, 
did the police agree to release the poles, and then only after Mayor Aurora 
Torrejon and two witnesses signed a written order handing them over to her 
counterpart in Soritor. 
</P>
<P>
Later Wednesday, after delivering two speeches in Rioja and Soritor, Vargas 
Llosa visited a schoolyard where the 66-by-82 foot tent was being erected. 
</P>
<P>
Designed as a permanent structure that can serve later as a community center, 
the tent was spread out over a field near several wrecked houses. In the red 
and white of the Peruvian flag, it bore the Spanish initials of the Solidarity 
Action Program, PAS, and also said in black letters 20 feet across "Mario 
Vargas Llosa" adorned with the Democratic Front's ballot symbol. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of electioneering, and the front's campaign handbills pasted on the 
boxes of aid, were cause for some bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Lenith Herrera, a school supervisor working in the civil defense program 
in Soritor, said: "The aid is welcome. The unfortunate thing is . . . that they 
are taking advantage of this situation for their own purposes." 
</P>
<P>
The day after the earthquake, the first aid to arrive was from the three-party 
coalition, known as Fredemo, accompanied personally by Vargas Llosa's wife, 
Patricia, and his ally in the front, former President Fernando Belaunde Terry 
of the Popular Action Party. 
</P>
<P>
Answering Fujimori's charges that Fredemo represents the white and wealthy, 
Vargas Llosa has emphasized the PAS role in assisting the needy. He also has 
sought to show that he already has a solid, extensive organization, able to 
respond concretely to Peru's needs, while Fujimori is hurriedly trying to put a 
team together. 
</P>
<P>
Fujimori has not involved himself in the earthquake beyond expressing 
condolences to the victims. 
</P>
<P>
The shipment from Fredemo on Tuesday, the second since the quake a week 
earlier, included two pallets of donated blankets and powdered milk as well as 
the huge tent, filling about one-fourth of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Rioja Mayor Astolvo Paredes complained angrily that the nearby city of 
Moyobamba had suffered little damage but was receiving more aid than Rioja, 
where the suffering was much greater. 
</P>
<P>
"The help that is being received is going to those who have the most political 
muscle," he said. He estimated that about 60,000 people are homeless in Rioja 
Province, in 46 villages in a 40-mile-long belt of destruction in the Upper 
Mayo River Valley along the eastern slopes of the Andes Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Torrejon, the Rioja mayor elected on a Fredemo ticket in November, said the 
central government, run by the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA), 
still has not met her demand that the region be declared an emergency zone and 
therefore eligible for special relief aid. 
</P>
<P>
The government, however, is now setting up an emergency branch of the Materials 
Bank, which provides up to $730 in low-interest loans for housing construction, 
said Edgar Huamani, who was sent to Rioja by the Housing Ministry. He denied 
Torrejon's criticism that the bank, often seen as an arm of the APRA party, was 
refusing to work with the local Fredemo-dominated council. Most elements of 
APRA, which lost out in the first round of presidential voting, now support 
Fujimori. 
</P>
<P>
Religion, too, has been politicized in the earthquake aftermath. Several 
residents said the growing evangelical Protestant churches in Rioja have been 
exploiting the earthquake to recruit new members. 
</P>
<P>
"They are saying, 'We are close to the end of the world, and more quakes will 
come if people don't get baptized quickly,' " said Father Cristian Alejandria, 
a Roman Catholic priest in Rioja. "Last night, they were in the central square, 
using loudspeakers, speaking of the earthquake. They say it is a curse of God, 
a punishment." 
</P>
<P>
Fujimori, a Catholic, has been under attack by Vargas Llosa's campaign for his 
association with evangelicals, who made up more than a fourth of the candidates 
for Congress for Fujimori's Cambio 90 (Change 90) party. The Catholic Church 
has openly accused some evangelicals of politicizing religion and attacking 
Catholic practices. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas Llosa, an agnostic, complains that Fujimori is polarizing Peru by 
encouraging sects that are "foreign to Peru's traditions." Fujimori notes that 
he is a good Catholic, unlike his opponent. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake victims, meanwhile, are trying to cope, and nervously enduring 
aftershocks that sometimes tumble broken-backed houses that withstood the first 
quake. Most are oblivious to the political wrangling and welcome the 
assistance, whatever the source. Others are still hoping for help. 
</P>
<P>
"They have given us nothing," said Saul Vaca as he sifted through the dust of 
his fallen adobe house in Rioja. He and his wife and five children huddle at 
night under plastic strung across sticks in the ruins. "I want to rebuild, but 
they don't give us anything."

FINAL PERU POLLS SHOW MARKED DECLINE IN FUJIMORI'S SUPPORT

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
National opinion polls released Friday showed independent Alberto Fujimori's 
lead over novelist Mario Vargas Llosa narrowing so steadily that Sunday's 
presidential election has become too close to call. 
</P>
<P>
Two of three polls showed Fujimori ahead, while a third showed Vargas Llosa 
overtaking his rival and ahead by a tiny margin in the two-man runoff ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The final polls, which by law may not be disclosed in Peru, showed a dramatic 
decline in Fujimori's support since the agronomist's stunning surge in the 
first round April 8. But it remained unclear whether Vargas Llosa, leading a 
right-of-center coalition, is consolidating his momentum. 
</P>
<P>
The CPI polling firm, still compiling precise figures from its survey of 2,000 
voters Wednesday, said Fujimori retained a lead of 5-6 percentage points, with 
14% still undecided. CPI pollster Manuel Saavedra said Vargas Llosa's 
Democratic Front had failed to press its campaign in the interior, where 
Fujimori remains strong thanks to a major grass-roots campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The Apoyo polling company, based on a survey of 4,200 voters in 28 provinces, 
said Fujimori's edge had slipped to 41% to Vargas Llosa's 39%, from a nearly 
20-point lead in the days after the first-round ballot. About 10% were 
undecided and another 10% would cast blank ballots, said Apoyo's Alfredo 
Torres. 
</P>
<P>
The Datum firm, however, said Vargas Llosa had moved ahead of Fujimori by a 
margin of 42.9% to 41.5%, a difference smaller than the margin of error of 2.6 
points in the survey of 1,445 voters. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a statistical tie," said Datum's Manuel Torrado. "We don't know who 
will win." 
</P>
<P>
The pollsters agreed that Vargas Llosa had taken the lead in Lima, home to a 
third of the 9.9 million voters, and in the jungle areas, while Fujimori was 
dominating the north, south and central mountain highland districts.

BUSH MAKES USE OF UNIQUE ASSET -- HIS FIRST LADY

<P>
In a way his recent predecessors never did, President Bush is making use of a 
unique political asset -- the First Lady. 
</P>
<P>
He mentioned Barbara Bush -- to enthusiastic applause -- at every stop on his 
four-state fund-raising trip for Republican candidates this week. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the GOP faithful in the Midwest seemed more responsive to the mention 
of Mrs. Bush's activities than they were to the President's account of the 
Soviet-American summit meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Friday was Mrs. Bush's 65th birthday, giving Bush an added reason to bring up 
her name. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish that Barbara were here on her birthday -- the hero of Wellesley. I'm 
very, very proud of her," he said in remarks at a luncheon here. He was 
referring to her commencement address last week at Wellesley College, where she 
had been the subject of complaints that she had been invited as speaker only 
because of her husband's achievements. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, former President Ronald Reagan's advisers sometimes felt that his 
wife, Nancy, was a liability, especially in the early years of his presidency. 
Certainly, Reagan did not keep political audiences informed of Mrs. Reagan's 
doings. 
</P>
<P>
Rosalynn Carter, Betty Ford and Lady Bird Johnson were all active but more 
controversial first ladies. Pat Nixon and Mamie Eisenhower almost always stayed 
in the political background. 
</P>
<P>
In his speeches on behalf of GOP candidates this week, Bush took pains to 
mention that Mrs. Bush also gave her endorsement to GOP incumbents and 
challengers alike. 
</P>
<P>
Even some of the GOP candidates Bush endorsed saluted his wife almost as a 
co-President, and one even quoted from her Wellesley speech. 
</P>
<P>
While opinion polls indicate that the President is enjoying unprecedented 
popularity, Mrs. Bush seems to have a universal appeal that goes beyond 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband affectionately refers to her as "the silver fox" or by a family 
nickname, "Bar," in his otherwise straight-forward political talks. 
</P>
<P>
In Des Moines on Friday morning, the President said he had spoken with his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
"She seems unexcited about her 65th birthday," he said. "She's doing just 
great. And thank you for giving Barbara and me the opportunity to serve the 
greatest country on the face of the Earth," he concluded. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago on Thursday night, Bush apologized for being tardy, saying he had 
been on the phone with his "birthday girl." 
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher preferred to talk 
about Mrs. Bush's Wellesley speech rather than about the outcome of his summit 
talks with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
While her husband was touring the Midwest, the First Lady devoted part of her 
birthday to a favorite task, reading to children. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush appeared on ABC-TV's "Good Morning America" and read to a dozen 
children seated around her. The story was "Leo, the Late Bloomer," about a lion 
who was slow to learn to read and write. 
</P>
<P>
The children responded with a chorus of "Happy Birthday, Mrs. Bush." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, how'd you know?" she asked. "Who told you that secret? Thank you very, 
very much." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Mrs. Bush visited a class at Berkshire Elementary School in 
District Heights, Md., for another reading session.

REP. STUDDS BEATEN BY MEN SEEKING 'SOMETHING TO DO'

Rep. Gerry E. Studds was beaten on a Washington street corner early Friday by 
two men looking for "something to do," a Secret Service spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Massachusetts Democrat said: "Gerry was mugged and beaten 
up pretty bad, but the bottom line is he's OK." 
</P>
<P>
The attackers knocked Studds down, then punched and kicked him in the head and 
body while a third man egged them on, according to U.S. Atty. Jay B. Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
Studds, 53, is one of two members of Congress who has publicly stated that he 
is homosexual, but spokesman Steven Schwadron said there is no indication that 
that was a motive for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
"There doesn't seem to have been any clear motive," Schwadron said. "There was 
no robbery." 
</P>
<P>
Studds suffered "bruises to the head and body," according to a press release 
from his office, "but was in good spirits as he returned home to Massachusetts 
for the weekend." 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred about 12:30 a.m. in the DuPont Circle neighborhood of 
Washington, a block from where Studds lives, according to Allan Cramer, a 
spokesman for the U.S. Secret Service. Studds' office said the congressman was 
returning home alone from dinner at a friend's house when he was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
Two uniformed officers searched the neighborhood and arrested two men, who 
reportedly admitted commiting the attack. The men said they didn't know Studds 
and called the beating "something to do at the time," Cramer said.

The judge in the Iran-Contra trial of John M. Poindexter rejected a renewed 
defense request to conduct a further examination of whether the former national 
security adviser's prosecution was improperly influenced by his immunized 
congressional testimony. U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene held that 
Poindexter's lawyers had again failed to demonstrate that independent counsel 
Lawrence E. Walsh had relied on any of Poindexter's immunized testimony. Walsh 
was prohibited by law from using evidence derived from Poindexter's testimony 
to the select House and Senate Iran-Contra panels. Poindexter was convicted on 
all five felony charges lodged against him.

2ND TITAN 4 LAUNCHED; MILITARY KEEPS PAYLOAD A SECRET

A giant Titan 4 rocket thundered into orbit early Friday with what was believed 
to be a military surveillance satellite. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials said the early morning launching went smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second launching of the nation's most powerful unmanned space rocket 
and one of three planned for this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything went very well. It was a beautiful sight to behold," Air Force Col. 
Frank Stirling, director of the Titan program, said. "It was a great step for 
us in the Air Force to get the second Titan 4 launched on time as planned." 
</P>
<P>
The $173-million rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. It 
resembled a large ball of fire as it cut through clouds on its way toward an 
undisclosed orbit. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force refused to discuss or even acknowledge the flight until it issued 
a statement about 20 minutes after liftoff. The payload was not disclosed, but 
civilian experts believe it is an electronic eavesdropping satellite or a 
missile-warning spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
A Titan 4 successfully boosted a missile-warning satellite into orbit in June, 
1989, even though an engine nozzle malfunctioned. Stirling said the problem was 
corrected and did not occur in Friday's launching. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Marietta Space Launch Systems has a $7.1-billion contract with the Air 
Force to supply 41 Titan 4 rockets, with an option for eight more. The goal is 
to have 75 by the end of 1997, which would put the cost of the program at $17 
billion, Stirling said. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force ordered the rocket in 1985 to serve as a complementary launching 
vehicle to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's manned space 
shuttle.

Eight people developed infections from a contaminated drug used in open-heart 
surgery, and two of them died, Bryan Memorial Hospital spokesmen in Lincoln, 
Neb., said. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Frye, a Bryan vice president, said the hospital traced the infection to a 
solution of glutamate aspartate. The solution is used to paralyze the heart 
during open-heart surgery. She said the hospital switched to a commercially 
premixed solution and patients who undergo surgery now are not at risk of 
infection. Frye said the source of the infection was traced to preparation of 
the solution.

JUDGE OKS QUADRIPLEGIC'S PLEA TO DIE

A Nevada judge cleared the way Friday for a 31-year-old quadriplegic to end his 
life after hearing his ailing father testify that his son has no hope of 
recovery and wants to die before him. 
</P>
<P>
District Judge Donald Mosley granted a petition for declaratory relief sought 
by an attorney for Kenneth A. Bergstedt, who has been paralyzed and hooked to a 
respirator since a 1969 swimming accident. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to go before I do," Bergstedt's father, Robert, testified. "There's 
no future for him. He knows he'll never walk again. He knows he has to depend 
on someone else the rest of his life." 
</P>
<P>
Mosley, however, ordered the state attorney general's office to appeal to the 
Nevada Supreme Court and cautioned the elder Bergstedt against acting hastily. 
</P>
<P>
"Do not feel a compunction to do so, either because of this ruling or because 
of public pressure," Mosley said. "This merely allows you the option." 
</P>
<P>
Mosley ordered the expedited appeal so the Supreme Court could set a precedent 
in the case. Nevada currently has no laws governing such cases. 
</P>
<P>
"One district court judge's opinion does not put this to rest," Mosley said. 
"For the residents of the state of Nevada, and for Kenneth Bergstedt, a 
definitive resolution needs to be had." 
</P>
<P>
The younger Bergstedt, who did not attend the hearing, had petitioned Mosley 
for an order that would allow a doctor to give him a sedative and disconnect 
him from the respirator that helps him breathe. 
</P>
<P>
He has been paralyzed from the age of 10, when his neck was broken by a girl 
who jumped on him while he was swimming in a pool. Doctors testified he has no 
chance of regaining any bodily function. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Bergstedt said his son had wanted to end his life for 17 years, ever 
since he came to the realization that he had no hope of recovering from the 
injuries that shattered any chance of leading a normal life. 
</P>
<P>
"He sees all these things are denied him that a normal man would do," Bergstedt 
said. "When he started realizing there was no cure . . . he expressed then his 
desire to die." 
</P>
<P>
The elder Bergstedt said his son decided to seek a court order allowing him to 
die after hearing of a similar case about 18 months ago in California. 
</P>
<P>
He said his son, who spends most of his time on a gurney and cannot feed 
himself or handle any of his bodily functions, gets no pleasure out of life and 
sees no reason to continue living. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not overjoyed with it," Bergstedt said of his son's desire to die. "But I 
do consent with what he's doing. I can see why he's doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Bergstedt, who has cared for his son on a 24-hour basis since his mother died 
in November, 1978, said his son fears being put in an institution when the 
father dies. The elder Bergstedt, who is 65, has only one leg, suffers from 
high blood pressure and said a spot was recently discovered on a lung. 
</P>
<P>
The request for the order was not opposed by Deputy Atty. Gen. Donald Haight, 
who said he based his opinion on Kenneth Bergstedt having a constitutional 
right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>

HE'S STORED UP THE PAST BUT THE FUTURE'S IN DOUBT 
</P>

<P>
No doubt about it. These are uneasy days in the museum world. 
</P>
<P>
A Van Gogh sells for a record $82.5 million in New York, a Renoir for $78.1 
million, and a judge in Ohio launches a search for obscenity in a collection of 
Robert Mapplethorpe photographs. 
</P>
<P>
In Piru, meanwhile, another cultural question rides the dry breeze: 
</P>
<P>
Who will take over the Harry H. Lechler Collection? 
</P>
<P>
"He's got family," a woman at the Piru General Store in Ventura County said. 
"Or he could probably sell it or give it to a historical society. But I 
couldn't tell you for sure." 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't know," said Jean Warren, vice president of the Piru Neighborhood 
Council. "He didn't know 10 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Harry H. Lechler, founder of Lechler's Museum and unofficial historian of the 
tiny town of Piru, collects things. For more than 50 of his 78 years, he has 
been gathering and displaying them. 
</P>
<P>
Turn-of-the-century farm implements. A 1917 butter churn. An 18-foot-long South 
American python skin. A buggy whip. Eight feet of Southern Pacific railroad 
track, ties and all. A fading carton of Albers Flapjack Flour. A can of Billy 
beer. Ancient razors. A stuffed albino gopher. 
</P>
<P>
"Slim Johnson caught that," said Lechler, glancing at the gopher. "I'd say 
sometime around 1945 or 1948." 
</P>
<P>
Lechler, who has spent his life in Piru, has thousands of these things, each in 
its place. The well-secured storeroom behind his house is designated as Ventura 
County Historical Landmark No. 125. And for 20 years now, he has been offering 
private tours to those who call ahead or knock at his door and ask politely. 
He's in the phone book. 
</P>
<P>
"I've only refused once," he said. "I had two guys come in -- rough-looking 
guys -- just before dark, and my wife and I were just about to go out. Must 
have been about five years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Lechler, balding, bespectacled and well-fed, seems to be in robust health. In 
his cowboy hat and bolo tie, he scrambles up a ladder to the second story of 
his house, talks a blue streak and offers a nimble harmonica recital on his 
antique Hohner. But someday his collection will need a new curator. 
</P>
<P>
And so, while New Yorkers wonder if high auction prices are pushing museums out 
of the art market, and court watchers wonder whether the Mapplethorpe case will 
have a chilling effect on freedom of expression, Piru wonders about the fate of 
its only museum. And the man whose name is on the sign can't offer much help. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants to know what's going to happen to this place when I'm gone, 
and I wish I knew the answer to that question. I don't know," Lechler said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got seven grandchildren, two great-grandchildren, three daughters and a 
son, so I hope it'll stay in the family. But. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Piru, with a population of 1,200, holds little interest for most ambitious 
youngsters, and the Harry H. Lechler Collection is a daunting property. Lechler 
has two daughters in the area, but neither seems inclined to step in, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it should be donated to the county historical society," Warren said. If 
the collection stayed put under local stewardship, she said, "You'd have to 
open the doors and charge admission, and you'd have to have a curator, and this 
town just doesn't have enough people for that." 
</P>
<P>
The official tour starts upstairs in Harry and Margaret Lechler's house, which 
was built in 1937 for about $3,000. The upstairs den, principally occupied by 
four deer heads, two television sets and a stuffed mallard, was added in 1943. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Harry Lechler said, he had begun running the town's general store, and 
word of his hoarding habits had begun to spread. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd have a salesman in the store," he said, "and I'd say, 'Come here and have 
a look at this.' And he'd say, 'Hey, you got a little museum here! And I got 
some something you ought to have.' " 
</P>
<P>
Now the Lechlers' property is crowded with added-on structures, each devoted to 
another sub-category of the collection. The garden area bristles with rusty 
Model T parts, spring-toothed harrows, a 1920 Fordson tractor and, near the 
walkway, a rusted round casing with a wooden handle, mounted on an empty 
rectangular box. 
</P>
<P>
"This here -- I don't know what it is," said Harry Lechler, waving an arm at 
the box. "Something like that, I'll leave it. And someday, some guy will come 
and say, 'Ah, you know what that is?' " 
</P>
<P>
Those are Harry Lechler's favorite visitors. The least favorite are those who 
wish to do business, such as the man who two months ago offered $50 for a tiny 
fishing reel. 
</P>
<P>
"I said no," Harry Lechler said, "because the guy who gave it to me, he didn't 
give it to me to sell. He gave it to me to show. And that's the way I feel 
about all of this stuff. I'm a caretaker, really." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Lechler might be less adamant about his collection if its contents were 
less familiar, but for him, Piru history is personal history. His father and 
mother came to the Piru area in 1889 and homesteaded a 500-acre ranch just 
across the nearby county line. On one wall hangs one of his father's 
homesteader papers from 1892, entitling him to 159 acres of Los Angeles County 
property and signed by President Benjamin Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
In a corner stands the telephone switchboard used by Harry Lechler's parents 
when they took over the Roundrock Hotel in downtown Piru. The hotel was sold 
years ago, and until the 1970s, Harry Lechler made his living running a general 
store. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, the museum has claimed most of his attention. It has 
neither nonprofit status nor accreditation from the American Assn. of Museums, 
but Harry Lechler said that troubles him little because he refuses all cash 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
Material contributions are another matter. 
</P>
<P>
"If you turn stuff away one time, people will say, 'Well, he doesn't want 
stuff,' " he said. "So I take it, whether I want it or not. Hell, I've got the 
room." 
</P>
<P>
As Harry Lechler said this, standing in the yard amid a century of bric-a-brac, 
Margaret Lechler, 79, his wife of almost 56 years, labored silently in the 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
She's not sure what will become of the Harry H. Lechler Collection either. 
Seeing how it has come to dominate her yard, home and husband, a visitor 
wonders if, some days, she'd rather just do without the whole accumulation. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no," she said quickly, nodding her head toward the living room. "I have a 
lot of stuff in there too. I have quite a collection of bells and music boxes. 
And it looks like I'm starting to get a collection of candles. And, of course, 
I've always been a collector of books."

PUBLIC DEFENDER SEEKS TO VOID NEWLY PASSED JUSTICE INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County public defender on Friday filed the first legal 
challenge to Proposition 115, the sweeping criminal justice initiative passed 
by voters on Tuesday, asking the state Supreme Court to delay implementation of 
the measure and ultimately declare it unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
The writ of mandate, filed at the Los Angeles office of the court, requests 
urgent action to avoid "chaos in the courts of California" as judges, 
prosecutors and defense attorneys grapple with the measure's legal 
applications, reaching varying conclusions that will ultimately have to be 
resolved by the higher court. 
</P>
<P>
According to Assistant Public Defender David Meyer, that is just what has 
happened this week as courts all over the county tried to cover the same 
ground. "It's extremely confusing," he said. "It takes a long time. It's 
tedious . . . and expensive." 
</P>
<P>
A stay of the measure could be issued by the court as early as Monday when it 
convenes for other matters in Los Angeles. Or the court could decide not to 
take up Proposition 115 at this time, or chose a variety of other actions. 
</P>
<P>
Similar challenges were filed after passage of two previous initiatives, the 
insurance reform law, Proposition 103, and an earlier criminal justice measure, 
Proposition 8. 
</P>
<P>
In the legal documents filed Friday, Public Defender Wilbur Littlefield 
attacked the measure as an illegal change to the state Constitution and a 
violation of the "single-subject rule," which states that initiatives must 
cover a single issue. 
</P>
<P>
That same argument failed with Proposition 8, but Meyer said in a telephone 
interview that Proposition 115 encompasses 16 separate subjects. "We're arguing 
to the Supreme Court that the line has been crossed." 
</P>
<P>
Among its provisions, Proposition 115, the Crime Victims Justice Reform Act, 
limits the rights of criminal defendants to those of defendants in federal 
court. It is aimed at ending delays in the justice system. Jury selection is 
speeded up and preliminary hearings after grand jury indictment are eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer explained that under state law it is permissible to amend the 
Constitution, but in his view Proposition 115 goes beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really not an amendment at all," he contended. "It's a wholesale revision 
of the Constitution" that would require a constitutional convention. 
</P>
<P>
The defense attorneys also are asking the high court to order judges not to 
apply Proposition 115 retroactively, as one of them purportedly did in a Van 
Nuys preliminary hearing this week.

GAY FBI AGENT SUES OVER DISMISSAL

<P>
A 20-year veteran FBI agent, who told the agency in 1988 that he is homosexual, 
filed suit in federal court to block his imminent dismissal, loss of security 
clearance and loss of pension. The case is believed to be the first in the 
nation by an agent challenging the loss of his job based on homosexual 
discrimination, according to Richard Gayer, the agent's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
The agent, identified in the lawsuit only as John Doe, accused the FBI of 
discrimination based on sexual preference in violation of the Constitution's 
equal protection clause, as well as violation of his constitutional rights of 
free speech and free association. FBI spokesman Carlos Fernandez would not 
comment directly on the lawsuit but said: "Our concern is sexual conduct, not 
sexual preference."

The Kern County Grand Jury has recommended that a planter shaped like a cross 
be removed from a public cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
Placement of religious symbols on public property is inconsistent with the 
First Amendment guarantee of religious freedom, the grand jury report said. 
However, a spokesman for the Tehachapi Public Cemetery District said the 
planter will not be removed until the district receives a legal opinion 
ordering such action. "Everybody tells us that cemeteries are excepted from 
provisions of the First Amendment," said cemetery board chairman Phil Marx. 
"Every government cemetery in the country has crosses all over them, and 
religious services are held all the time."

Witnesses driving along nearby Interstate 5 rushed to the plane and pulled the 
pilot from the burning wreckage, said sheriff's spokesman Richard Dixon. The 
pilot, Ted Ingram, 55, of Bakersfield, was spraying a tomato crop shortly after 
dawn when the plane went down near Seventh Standard Road, Dixon said. Ingram 
was hospitalized for burns, smoke inhalation and abrasions, a Memorial Hospital

WILSON'S HOMER GIVES SCOTT A WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glenn Wilson's three-run, pinch-hit homer in the 10th inning at Houston 
preserved Mike Scott's three-hit, 15-strikeout performance and rallied the 
Astros to a 3-1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds Friday night, snapping the 
Astros' seven-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds, restricted to one hit by Scott (3-6) over the first nine innings, 
took the lead in the 10th when Barry Larkin singled with one out, went to 
second on a groundout, stole third and scored on Todd Benzinger's single to 
right. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel very good when he (Benzinger) got the hit," Scott said. "But my 
arm still felt good and it was good to see Glenn put it out for us." 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom of the 10th, Eric Anthony drew a one-out walk off Randy Myers 
(1-1). Pinch-runner Louie Meadows went to second on a single by Rafael Ramirez 
and took third on Alex Trevino's fly to center field. Wilson then homered over 
the right-field fence, just beyond Paul O'Neill's leap. 
</P>
<P>
Scott had retired 18 consecutive batters before Larkin singled. After Eric 
Davis grounded out, Larkin stole third and O'Neill walked before Benzinger's 
hit broke the tie. Scott then made Mariano Duncan his 15th strikeout victim, 
setting a career high. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Browning continued to pitch without support. He gave up only five hits, 
walked three and struck out seven in nine innings, extending his shutout string 
to 23 1/3 innings. It was the second time this season Browning has pitched nine 
scoreless innings without getting a decision. 
</P>
<P>
Scott struck out five of the first six batters he faced and surpassed his 
previous season-high strikeout total of five in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 18, St. Louis 2 -- Catcher Nelson Santovenia drove in a career-high 
six runs, including four in the first two innings at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Santovenia hit a three-run homer to cap a six-run first inning against former 
teammate Bryn Smith (6-5) and added an RBI single in the second, when the Expos 
scored six times against Ricky Horton. He had a two-run single in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Wallach, who has at least one extra-base hit in 13 of his last 20 games, 
had a two-run single in the first and doubled home two runs in the second. His 
double was the Expos' fifth consecutive hit and followed RBI singles by Tim 
Raines and Andres Galarraga. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos' 18 runs was one short of the franchise record, accomplished five 
times, the last time against Houston in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 15, Philadelphia 2 -- Shawon Dunston's grand slam highlighted a 
nine-run third inning as the Cubs broke a five-game losing streak by routing 
the Phillies at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his slam, which followed an intentional walk to Ryne Sandberg, Dunston 
had an RBI grounder and walked twice as the Cubs got 16 hits and 10 walks. 
Sandberg led off the inning with his 13th homer. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Pico (2-0) gave up one unearned run and six hits in seven innings after 
entering the game with a 6.64 earned-run average. He also went 2 for 3 anddrove 
in a run. 
</P>
<P>
Major league batting leader Len Dykstra of the Phillies extended his hitting 
streak to 21 games with a single in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
New York 7, Pittsburgh 1 -- Darryl Strawberry hit two home runs in a game for 
the 21st time in his career and Sid Fernandez pitched two-hit ball for seven 
innings at New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets snapped the Pirates' four-game winning streak and won a game they 
considered crucial. A loss would have dropped New York 10 1/2 games behind the 
East-leading Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
The game was delayed by rain twice, totaling 2 hours 48 minutes, and didn't end 
until after 1 a.m. EDT.

<TEXT>
<P>
There will be a stakes doubleheader today at Hollywood Park, topped by the 
$109,500 Los Angeles Handicap for older sprinters. 
</P>
<P>
The likely choice is Sam Who, who has been idle since finishing a distant third 
behind Sunny Blossom and Olympic Prospect in the Palos Verdes Handicap on Dec. 
30. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-year-old Lypheor gelding had a series of sharp workouts for trainer Henry 
Moreno -- including six furlongs at 1:11 4/5 -- and he has three victories and 
a second in four starts on the Hollypark main track. 
</P>
<P>
Others in the lineup include Prospectors Gamble, the 13-1 upset winner of the 
Triple Bend Handicap, Coastal Voyage, who has won two straight on the turf, 
Timeless Answer, Yes I'm Blue, Black Jack Road, Sensational Star and 
Pentelicus. 
</P>
<P>
Two races earlier, Patches, another talented 3-year-old filly in the Wayne 
Lukas barn, will seek her fourth straight victory in the $84,200 Railbird 
Stakes at seven furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
With Gary Stevens suspended because of an incident at Los Alamitos, Pat 
Valenzuela will ride the daughter of Majestic Light, who won two at Santa Anita 
before going east and taking the Dogwood on May 12 at Churchill Downs. She was 
also scheduled to go in the La Troienne two days before the Kentucky Derby, but 
dumped Stevens, ran off and was scratched. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas will also be represented by multiple stakes winner Special Happening. The 
other entrants are Fit to Scout, Saros Treasure, Golden Reef, Island Splendour, 
Forest Fealty, Dominant Dancer, Pampered Star and Bel's Starlet.

Although Burn Annie doesn't run much, he just may be one of the most reliable 
horse stabled locally. 
</P>
<P>
A 5-year-old son of J Burns, Burn Annie made it eight victories in 13 starts 
when he won Thursday's seventh race, an $80,000 claimer for older horses. 
</P>
<P>
Twice the California-bred has been second and third, and the only time he was 
off the board he had a valid excuse. After whipping his head back at the start, 
he was away very slowly. Even so, he was only beaten by four lengths in the 
Oct. 28, 1989, turf sprint. 
</P>
<P>
Getting a perfect trip outside, Burn Annie took the lead at the eighth pole 
Thursday, then beat Jamoke by a length under Russell Baze in 1:21 1/5 for the 
seven furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
This was the first start for Burn Annie since he defeated Gum by a head Jan. 
27, going 6 1/2 furlongs on the Santa Anita turf. Afterward, trainer Leonard 
Dorfman wasn't sure his money machine was going to make it back in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a specific problem," said Dorfman without getting into specifics. 
"After that grass race, I wasn't sure about him. A month later, he started to 
come around. He's going good right now. He seemed to be fine after Thursday's 
race." 
</P>
<P>
Burn Annie is obviously a people's choice. Only twice in his career has he not 
been favored and 9-2 is the highest price he has ever been. 
</P>
<P>
Dorfman, who will turn 68 in two weeks, is also partial to the horse, whom he 
claimed from Gary Jones, who, one race before, had taken him from his original 
trainer, Jimmy Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the greatest," Dorfman said. "He's very kind, but he's all masculine. He 
gets anxious and he'll push you around, but he's more like an overgrown puppy." 
</P>
<P>
Owned by R.C. Randall, Burn Annie's latest success boosted his earnings to 
$162,800, not bad for a thoroughbred who began his career in a maiden claimer. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine a Cleveland Indians-Seattle Mariners matchup in mid-September or a 
battle between the Clippers and the Sacramento Kings in the final week of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The same level of anticipation exists for the 122nd running of the Belmont 
Stakes today. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled, the Kentucky Derby winner and Preakness runner-up, is the 4-5 
favorite in the final leg of the Triple Crown. He looks every bit of the short 
price against a field short on quality. 
</P>
<P>
Unless Unbridled completely flops, the race is for second today and there are 
several candidates to complete the exacta. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty Six Red, the winner of the Gotham and the Wood, was beaten by more than 
22 lengths in the Kentucky Derby after being prominent early. The distance may 
be out of his reach, but he figures to be in front and speed horses have fared 
pretty well in this race through the years. 
</P>
<P>
Yonder and Video Ranger, the 1-2 finishers in the Jersey Derby, are other 
possibilities. Yonder is now trained by Angel Penna and Video Ranger will be 
ridden today by Jose Santos, replacing Ron Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
Land Rush, seventh in Kentucky and sixth in the Preakness, still appears better 
than he's shown. The Nijinsky II colt may be closest to Thirty Six Red early. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Land Rush will run back to his Blue Grass effort. He was second to 
Summer Squall, two lengths ahead of Unbridled. 
</P>
<P>
There's also been support voiced for Go and Go. Fourth in his most recent start 
in Ireland, the Be My Guest colt has already shown he can handle the dirt. He 
won the Laurel Futurity at 22-1 last October, but Robyn Dancer, who was a head 
behind him that day, hasn't exactly been a world beater since coming to 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The other contestants are Country Day, a plodding son of Country Pine who was a 
distant second to Profit Key in the Peter Pan, Baron De Vaux, who was next to 
last at 37-1 in the Preakness, and Hawaiian Pass, who just finished third in 
the Gold Rush Handicap at Golden Gate. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Russell Baze, who was disqualified from first to third aboard On Easy Street in 
Thursday's third race, was handed a five-day suspension by the stewards Friday 
morning. The suspension will begin Sunday and continue through Saturday. . . . 
Saying he felt fine, Kent Desormeaux was back in action Friday. Four days after 
being involved in the spill in which Chris McCarron broke both legs and an arm, 
Desormeaux had three seconds from five opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Itsallgreektome, upset winner of the Spotlight and Will Rogers in his first two 
starts on the turf, will go for a sweep of Hollywood Park's series for 
3-year-old grass performers in the $100,000 Cinema Handicap Sunday. Ten others 
were entered Friday morning for the 1 1/8u mile Cinema, including Warcraft, who 
will be adding blinkers, Jovial, Mehmetori, Short Timer, Doyouseewhatisee, Iam 
The Iceman, Bel Air Paster, College Green, Predecessor and Kept His Cool.

But it's far too early to start worrying. After all, the computer's pick 
finished last. Take that, silicon breath!

HEALTH: THE FIRM'S MENU FREQUENTLY DRAWS FIRE FROM NUTRITIONISTS. SO MCDONALD'S 
WILL POST SIGNS WITH NUTRITION INFORMATION IN ALL ITS OUTLETS.

The typical meal at a McDonald's restaurant may be loaded with fat, salt and 
cholesterol, but by the end of July customers should at least have fair 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's Corp., the Oak Brook, Ill.-based fast-food chain, said Friday that 
it will post signs in all of its more than 8,200 restaurants nationwide with 
"complete nutrition information" on all of its permanent menu items. The 
decision to post the information, including all ingredients and nutrient 
values, is a "natural step in our long-standing commitment to provide our 
customers with this information, which we began offering nearly two decades 
ago," Ed Rensi, president of McDonald's U.S.A., said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
A McDonald's spokeswoman said the information is already available in booklet 
form, but the company decided to make it more readily available to customers 
when they enter the restaurants. McDonald's agreed to distribute the booklets 
after the attorneys general of California, Texas and New York pressured the 
five largest fast-food chains to provide nutritional information. 
</P>
<P>
The signs to be posted will show the serving size of each menu item and give an 
accounting of calories, protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals, and 
cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the simpler it is for our customers to learn the facts about our 
products, the easier it will be for them to see how well McDonald's fits into 
their balanced diet," Rensi said. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's said in its statement that nutrition experts praised the decision. 
But it failed to satisfy one of its most vocal antagonists. 
</P>
<P>
"My reaction is one of disappointment," said Phil Sokolof, a wealthy Omaha 
manufacturing executive and self-styled consumer health advocate. He has 
attacked the chain in a series of major newspaper ads titled "McDonald's, Your 
Hamburgers Are Too Fat!" Sokolof called the signs "window dressing." He added: 
"Instead of reducing saturated fat, they're posting signs." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's said its announcement was not related to Sokolof's ad campaign. 
Sokolof and McDonald's have sparred over the precise saturated fat content of 
the chain's hamburgers and have traded barbs over the inclusion of beef tallow 
in the oil mixture for cooking french fries. Sokolof said he had hoped the 
company would at least remove the tallow. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Liebman, director of nutrition for the Washington-based Center for 
Science in the Public Interest, said merely posting the signs is not inherently 
good for consumers. The question is how prominent the signs will be displayed, 
and whether they will be graphically designed to highlight the most important 
information in time for consumers to make a good decision, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the information is going to look like a page from the telephone book and 
you can't read it until you get to the cash register, it is not helping 
anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Liebman said, a long ingredient list isn't necessarily the best 
information. "The most important information is the calories, the total fat, 
saturated fat and sodium in large size type that can be read without a 
magnifying glass," she said. A lot of nutritional information is also not 
useful unless the consumer knows what percentage of recommended total daily 
intake is represented in the food item, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
As Americans have become more health conscious, the food industry has been 
under increasing pressure to disclose not only the ingredients in items on the 
grocery shelf and on restaurant menus but also to disclose the presence and 
amount of such potentially harmful substances as sodium, saturated fat and 
cholesterol. Even the federal health officials have joined the chorus calling 
for clearer, more precise food labels. McDonald's in the past year has come 
under fire for two reasons. Its restaurants are in practically every 
neighborhood in the nation. And its mainstay products -- burgers and fries -- 
are the kind of foods that most often raise fears of exposure to a harmful 
diet.

AMES TO LAY OFF 18,000, SHUTTER 221 OF ITS STORES; 
</P>
<P>
RETAIL: ANALYSTS SAY THE MASSIVE FIRING BY THE STRUGGLING DISCOUNT CHAIN IS 
AMONG THE LARGEST IN AMERICAN HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In one of the biggest mass firings ever by a U.S. company, Ames Department 
Stores said Friday that it plans to dismiss nearly 18,000 workers and close 221 
stores in the South and Midwest to try to pull itself out of bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
The move, analysts said, both demonstrates the human toll being taken by 
ill-conceived takeovers and reflects the tumult in the U.S. retailing industry. 
But the cutback also was called a necessary, dramatic action to return Ames to 
financial health. 
</P>
<P>
Ames -- a major retailer in the Northeast and the nation's fourth-biggest 
discount chain -- filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection in April 
after suffering huge losses due to its 1988 acquisition of Zayre stores. 
</P>
<P>
"This is another excellent example of the abuses of buyouts," said Magda Lynn 
Seymour, a spokeswoman for the AFL-CIO in Washington. "They were in over their 
heads when they bought Zayre." 
</P>
<P>
Still, analysts doubted that the job losses would do lasting damage to the 
communities hit by store closings. Many of the affected jobs, they noted, are 
part-time positions. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry is such that it can swallow people back up," Seymour said. "There 
are job opportunities in the retail market." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Kelly, economic development manager for the Chamber of Commerce in Elgin, 
Ill., said the shuttering of the single Ames store in his city would have a 
"negligible" impact. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of those types of stores here. We have a booming economy," 
Kelly said. "Other stores will get those customers, and new stores will come 
into the area." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Ames, based in Rocky Hill, Conn., portrayed the store closings and 
layoffs as a "critical first step" toward revitalizing the company. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a tough decision for the company to make, but they felt it was 
necessary. A lot of people will be losing their jobs, but a lot of jobs will be 
saved because this step was taken," an Ames spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
In a news release, Ames' chief executive, Stephen L. Pistner, said the move 
"will cut our expenses, reduce operating losses and allow us to focus our 
efforts on serving our customers." 
</P>
<P>
The company will continue to operate 458 stores with about 40,000 employees in 
17 states, principally in the Northeast. It has no locations in California. 
Most of the outlets destined to close during August and September are in 
Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, North Carolina and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Ames said it would close 33 stores. Friday's announcement signals 
that an additional 188 stores will be shut, along with distribution centers in 
Massachusetts and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Ames estimates that the 221 affected stores had an operating loss of $47.5 
million for the fiscal year ended Jan. 27. The company posted a net loss of 
$228 million during the period. 
</P>
<P>
The Ames spokeswoman wouldn't rule out the possibility of further closings. 
Ames' plans require the approval of Judge Howard C. Buschman III of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court in New York, but no delays are expected. 
</P>
<P>
Experts were at a loss to cite other mass firings that would rival the one 
planned by Ames. During the past five years, the only cutback known to be 
bigger was AT&amp;T's elimination of more than 27,000 jobs in 1987, but that 
number included people who took early retirement or who otherise left the 
company voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
The only retailing layoff believed to approach the size of Ames' came in 
October, 1986. When Gemco shut down, 14,000 workers -- including 9,000 in 
Southern California -- lost their jobs. Other big merchants that recently have 
sought bankruptcy court protection -- including Circle K, L. J. Hooker and the 
department store divisions of Campeau Corp. -- have closed, at most, small 
numbers of stores. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Ames erred badly in buying Zayre because the acquired chain 
already had lost many of its one-time customers. Kurt Barnard, publisher of 
Retail Marketing Report, called the purchase by the once-thriving Ames "one of 
the stupidest moves I've ever seen in retailing." 
</P>
<P>
"In effect, what Ames did was to buy a defunct retail chain, a chain that had 
nothing to offer but troubles and problems. To turn around a retail chain 
that's lost its customer base, is well-nigh impossible," Barnard said. 
</P>
<P>
"By getting rid of most of the Zayre stores, plus a few of the weak Ames 
stores, they've cleansed the entire operation of all the non-productive parts," 
added Barnard, who said he now is "absolutely confident" that Ames will turn 
itself around. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts also said Ames' executives failed to mesh the two companies' computer 
systems and marketing styles. Ames has followed an "everyday low prices" 
policy, while Zayre was a highly promotional chain that advertised heavily and 
had special sales. To top it off, Ames was hit by an economic slump in the 
Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
Dismissed Ames employees will receive up to $2,000 each in severance pay and 
compensation for unused vacation time. A program to place workers in new jobs 
also is being set up. 
</P>
<P>
Ames' announcement didn't budge shares of its stock, which is traded on the New 
York Stock Exchange. The stock closed Friday at $2.375, unchanged from 
Thursday, as 213,800 shares changed hands.

U.S. LEADERSHIP IN ELECTRONICS AT RISK, CONGRESS WARNED; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH TECH: THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT FEARS THAT JAPAN WILL TAKE OVER THE NO. 1 
SPOT IN THE EARLY '90S. 
</P>

<P>
The Commerce Department warned Friday that America's worldwide leadership in 
the electronics field is "under serious challenge" and "may well be eclipsed" 
by Japan during the early 1990s if current trends continue unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
In a 221-page report to Congress, the agency said that the U.S. electronics 
industry still is No. 1 worldwide but that it is rapidly losing market share on 
a broad range of electronic products, while its competitors in Japan and South 
Korea are gaining ground. 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, the document said, with a few notable exceptions -- such as the 
already hard-hit semiconductor business -- most of the U.S. electronics 
industry has not yet fully realized the extent to which it is being threatened 
by competition from other countries. 
</P>
<P>
"If current growth rates continue, the Japanese will be the world's No. 1 
electronics producer and trader by the early 1990s," the document concluded. It 
said prospects that America can maintain its market share -- even in newer 
areas such as X-ray lithography -- is bleak. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Department officials said the comprehensive study -- the first formal 
government assessment to weigh both the domestic and international performance 
of the U.S. electronics industry -- was intended to shock the U.S. industry 
into action. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to bring back to the industry is, frankly, some sense of 
what they are up against," said J. Michael Farren, undersecretary of commerce 
for international trade. "We're suggesting that maybe it's time for the 
industry to look further out," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But the report, the result of a six-month study by the department's 
International Trade Administration, stopped short of proffering any sweeping 
new proposals. And it conspicuously avoided urging new federal subsidies for 
industry, which the White House already has rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the study listed a series of "national" and "sectoral" issues that it 
said were contributing to the industry's decline -- from the high cost of 
capital to poor education and training and damage from unfair trade practices 
such as predatory pricing by foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
It also noted that the U.S. industry has not developed its own consensus on 
what needs to be done. Some sectors of the industry favor government 
intervention, while others want Washington simply to keep out. 
</P>
<P>
But the document's only specific recommendations were for Congress to enact 
White House proposals to reduce the tax rates on capital gains, to liberalize 
the antitrust laws to permit more joint manufacturing by U.S. firms and to make 
permanent the tax credit for research and development. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of any new proposals apparently reflected a sharp split within the 
Administration over how far the government should go in providing new forms of 
support to help the industry keep pace with foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the report said Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher 
initially favored stronger action but was rebuffed by budget director Richard 
G. Darman and chief White House economist Michael A. Boskin. The internal 
wrangling delayed the report by almost a year. 
</P>
<P>
Farren said the Administration currently opposes any form of "industrial 
policy" that would subsidize the industry. "The U.S. government needs to play 
an active role, but it is the role of the private sector to chart the course to 
competitiveness," the document said. 
</P>
<P>
Initial reaction from the industry was cautious. Herb Linnen, a Washington 
representative for American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., said the document 
appeared to provide "a very thoroughgoing analysis" but said it was too early 
to evaluate its conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
James P. Gradoville, manager of international trade programs for Motorola Inc., 
called the report "a good review of the issues" and "a confirmation of the 
problem that exists." But he said it was not likely to come as a surprise to 
most of the domestic industry. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, Gradoville conceded that there still was no 
consensus on what should be done to help the industry out of its fix. "We all 
have to do a lot more thinking on what the United States should do," he said in 
a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), a frequent advocate of government 
subsidies to private industry, branded the report "urgent and alarming" and 
called for swift action by Congress to strengthen the electronics sector. 
</P>
<P>
Levine said in a prepared statement that "America cannot be a leading economic 
power in the next century without a healthy electronics sector. If the U.S. 
ignores this study, we risk second-rate status for generations to come." 
</P>
<P>
The detailed study covered the entire breadth of the U.S. industry, from 
suppliers of basic materials and components to software-producers and 
manufacturers of computers, telecommunications equipment, instruments and 
business equipment. 
</P>
<P>
It showed that the $200-billion U.S. electronics industry is still the largest 
in the world in terms of production, exports, employment and technological 
leadership, and that the United States provides the largest single market for 
electronics makers, buying 40% of world production. 
</P>
<P>
But it warned that since 1984, the electronics industries of other key 
countries, particularly Japan and the European Community, have been growing 
more rapidly than the U.S. industry -- by 8% and 6% respectively, compared to 
only 1% for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
And the electronics industries of newly industrializing countries such as South 
Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Brazil and India have been expanding at an average 
double-digit pace, albeit from much smaller bases. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the high cost of capital, the "national" issues that the report said 
the U.S. industry is facing include the impact of foreign exchange rates, 
restrictions in antitrust laws, poor education and training and an outlook by 
corporations that is too short-term. 
</P>
<P>
The sectoral issues include the industry's inability to reach a consensus on 
problems; low spending on research and development; unfair trade practices; 
piracy of patents and trademarks; growing dependence on foreign suppliers and 
investors, and inadequate export financing.

First Interstate Bancorp Sells Unit: The Los Angeles-based banking company said 
it has agreed to sell its consumer lending unit NOVA Financial Services to a 
subsidiary of Transamerica Corp. for about $108 million in cash. The deal with 
Transamerica Finance Group Inc. will result in a pretax gain of more than $90 
million. First Interstate, which said in March that it would sell NOVA to 
concentrate on consumer banking, said the transaction is expected to close in 
July, subject to regulatory approval.

PATHE MAKES $50-MILLION DEPOSIT ON MGM/UA DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Pathe Communications Co. on Friday made the last of its $50-million down 
payments on MGM/UA Communications Corp., increasing its non-refundable 
investment to $275 million. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe, which is seeking to acquire MGM/UA for $1.2 billion, was required to 
deposit the funds by today under the terms of its agreement with MGM/UA. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the money is due by June 23, but Pathe has indicated that it 
intends to close the deal as soon as next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
With its final deposit, Pathe has pledged $200 million in cash and a 
$75-million interest in three upcoming films to the ambitious MGM/UA 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Securities analysts have said they are optimistic that the deal will close, 
even though Pathe has yet to resolve some key points with its chief financial 
backer, Time Warner Inc. Chief among them, according to an announcement by 
Pathe, are concerns about Pathe's financial health and its ability to fund 
future film production. At the same time, Pathe made headway on one front when 
Time Warner agreed to soften the terms of its loan. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner has agreed to lend Pathe $650 million in return for the 
distribution rights to the United Artists library and future Pathe and MGM/UA 
releases. Pathe plans to borrow the balance through one of its holding 
companies, Comfinance SA of Luxembourg. Pathe, headed by Italian financier 
Giancarlo Parretti, had hoped to close the MGM/UA deal Thursday. But its 
problems with Time Warner and a request for additional documentation from the 
Securities and Exchange Commission made it miss its self-imposed deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe offered to acquire MGM/UA's outstanding common and preferred stock for 
$20 a share in March. Majority owner Kirk Kerkorian has been trying to sell 
MGM/UA for two years.

JAPAN SNUBS U.S. DEMANDS ON PUBLIC WORKS SPENDING 
</P>

<P>
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said Friday that he would not give in to a key 
U.S. trade demand that Japan specify targets for boosting its public works 
spending, a hoped-for wedge in opening the market here to more foreign 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu's tough stand, coming a day after a stunning trade breakthrough in which 
Japan accepted U.S. technology as a cellular-phone standard, suggests that the 
government intends to assert itself despite heavy pressure for economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
Japan agreed in April to increase public spending as part of an unprecedented 
pact to reduce its $49-billion trade surplus with the United States by 
attacking trade barriers. But the prime minister has come under harsh criticism 
in Parliament for bowing to U.S. demands. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu said Friday that Japan would refuse to specify the ratio of public works 
spending to its gross national product in a final report on the April 
agreement, called the Structural Impediments Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"It was settled in the interim report (in April)," Kaifu told reporters. "I 
don't quite understand why they are raising the issue again." 
</P>
<P>
Japan did agree then to boost public spending, which would expand the number of 
projects that U.S. firms could bid on. 
</P>
<P>
But the United States had sought a definite annual spending target. Japan, 
rejecting what it called interference in internal affairs, said it would 
specify a total figure for the next 10 years and decide yearly spending 
flexibly to avoid overheating the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu's firm stand was a striking contrast to Thursday's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
The government, in what may be the most potent symbol of Japan's recent 
willingness to open its markets, said it was adopting digital cellular-phone 
technology made by Motorola, Inc., as a national standard.

Greenwald Promised $9 million: Gerald Greenwald, who left his job as vice 
chairman of Chrysler Corp. last week to lead the $4.4-billion employee buyout 
of UAL Corp., will receive at least $9 million in compensation even if it 
fails, a source close to the deal said. Greenwald, a highly regarded auto 
industry executive who had been expected to succeed Chrysler Chairman Lee A. 
Iacocca, said he would serve as chief executive of United Employee Acquisition 
Corp. prior to completion of the deal for the parent of United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
If the buyout goes through, Greenwald will become UAL chairman and chief 
executive. The source, who requested anonymity, said Greenwald has already been 
paid $5 million as a signing bonus. If the deal falls through, he will receive 
another $4 million, the source said.

U.S. CHIP MAKER TO ENTER DESIGN DEAL WITH SOVIETS; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH TECHNOLOGY: IF CYPRESS SEMICONDUCTOR OF SAN JOSE FINALIZES THE LICENSING 
PROJECT, IT WILL BE THE FIRST OF ITS KIND.

Cypress Semiconductor Corp., a San Jose chip maker, said Friday that it has 
signed a tentative agreement with a Soviet research institute to license 
designs for several advanced semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
T. J. Rodgers, Cypress' chief executive, said that, when the licensing 
agreement is completed later this year, it would be the first between a U.S. 
semiconductor maker and a Soviet group. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress' deal was struck during a 10-day tour that 13 Russian scientists and 
high-ranking government technology officials are making through the Silicon 
Valley in Northern California. Dubbed the "Silicon Summit," the tour followed 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's summit meetings with President Bush and 
Gorbachev's subsequent visit to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the Silicon Summit said several semiconductor manufacturers and 
other high-technology companies are meeting with representatives of the Soviet 
delegation to explore possible business opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress, the first company to reach an accord with members of the tour, signed 
a letter of intent with the Soviet Union's International Center for Informatics 
and Electronics to license a variety of advanced semiconductor-manufacturing 
technologies as well as semiconductor designs. 
</P>
<P>
Among the designs in which Cypress is interested are high-definition television 
products chips that could be used in televisions as well as computers; digital 
signal-processing chips for telecommunications and audio/video applications, 
and digital filtering devices used in communications applications. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress has agreed to pay royalty fees for use of the designs and to deposit 
$100,000 in an escrow account while terms of the final licensing agreement are 
written. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tremendous opportunity for Cypress," said Rodgers, who said his 
company makes none of the products for which he wants licenses. "Our philosophy 
is to grow through the addition of new products and product lines. . . . It 
also meets the Soviets' needs. They require high-quality process technology, 
international marketing capabilities and support as well as negotiable currency 
-- all things we can provide. We see this as a long-term, win-win situation." 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers said he plans to visit the Soviet Union next month to discuss the 
specific technologies and products under consideration.

DOW FALLS 34.95 AS PROFIT TAKERS PACE SELLOFF

Stock prices suffered their biggest drop in two weeks Friday, dogged for the 
fourth-straight day by profit taking after the Dow Jones industrial index 
jumped on Monday to an all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
Soft bond prices and weakness in technology and retail stocks weighed on the 
entire market. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials dropped 34.95 to 2,862.38, finishing the 
week with a net loss of 38.59 points. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 
1 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 458 up, 
1,010 down and 523 unchanged. But Big Board volume was just 142.6 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
Over the five preceding weeks the Dow had rolled up an advance of 255 points. 
Analysts said the enthusiasm built up in the market's advance to record highs 
began to cool as prices pulled back a bit in the last few days. A rash of 
program selling also hurt prices Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The upbeat mood was tempered by indications from the Federal Reserve that it 
wasn't ready to adopt a more stimulative credit policy on the basis of a few 
months of sluggish economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Traders were also unloading stocks before next week's key economic reports, 
including May producer and consumer price indexes and April trade numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Financial stocks were mostly lower as enthusiasm about the interest-rate 
outlook waned. BankAmerica dropped 1/2 to 32, Security Pacific lost 1 5/8 to 41 
1/8, and Wells Fargo dropped 1 1/4 to 82 1/2. But some S&amp;Ls were higher, 
including Downey Savings, up 3/4 to 19 1/2, and CalFed, up 3/8 to 20 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers continued to decline, with Gap Inc. leading the group. Bear, Stearns 
&amp; Co. trimmed its 1990 earnings estimates, citing Gap's surprisingly low 
same-store sales increase of 6% last month. Gap dropped 2 3/8 to 56 1/8. 
Elsewhere in the group, Limited fell 1 1/8 to 46 1/4, Dillard Department Stores 
dropped 2 5/8 to 85 1/4, and Liz Claiborne lost 1 1/8 to 30 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment stocks were broadly lower on worries about summer movie releases. 
Disney gave up 4 7/8 to 123 3/8, Time Warner lost 2 7/8 to 107 3/4, and MCA 
dropped 1 3/4 to 56 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Some biotech and high-tech stocks, recent leaders, were slammed. Amgen lost 2 
to 69 1/2, Compaq fell 2 5/8 to 119 1/8, and AST Research dropped 7/8 to 23 
7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Apple Computer's stock fell 3/4 to 38 1/4 on a report that the company's 
monitors may emit higher levels of radiation than other computer makers' 
screens. 
</P>
<P>
Rohr Industries rose 1 to 23 7/8 after an Alex. Brown analyst rated the stock a 
"buy," citing improved earnings expectations for the aerospace firm. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, investors moved to the sidelines ahead of the weekend and the market 
closed lower. The Nikkei 225-share index lost 199.21 points to end at 
32,993.29. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the Financial Times 100-share index fell 11.8 points to close at 
2,366.6. In Frankfurt, shares were off for the third consecutive day. The DAX 
index ended 15.20 points lower at 1,822.23.

Bond Prices Slip in Light Trading 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices dipped in slim trading Friday as many traders stayed on the 
sidelines awaiting several government reports scheduled to be released next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 5/32 point, or about $1.56 per 
$1,000 face amount, while its yield, which rises when prices fall, rose to 
8.44% from late Thursday's 8.42%. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said bond traders were just marking time as they waited for the 
figures that will provide clues on the direction of the economy and perhaps 
give some insight into the Federal Reserve's plans. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say favorable figures could reignite the price surge of June 1, 
when the Labor Department announced employment figures that signaled a 
weakening of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other on overnight loans, 
was quoted at 8.188%, down from 8.25% Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Is Stronger Against Pound, Yen 
</P>
<P>
The dollar finished stronger against most major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was stronger as investors anticipated next week's economic reports. 
Many apparently felt the consumer price index and producer price index could 
show stronger inflation, which could lead to higher interest rates, said Robert 
Hatcher, corporate trader at Barclay's Bank PLC in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar began its trading day in Tokyo, rising 0.10 yen to a closing of 
152.65 Japanese yen. Later, in London, it also was quoted higher, at 153.48 
yen, and in New York, it rose to 153.49 yen from 152.55 late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the dollar rose against the British pound, which was quoted at 
$1.6843, compared to $1.6880 late Thursday. In New York the pound also dropped 
against the dollar, falling to $1.6840 from $1.6895 on Thursday.

<P>
Cocoa Futures Take a Tumble 
</P>
<P>
Cocoa futures were sharply lower on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa 
Exchange amid widespread stop-loss selling. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, grain and soybeans were lower; livestock and pork futures 
were mixed; precious metals were mixed, and energy futures were higher. 
</P>
<P>
The cocoa futures market opened moderately lower, following the London market's 
lead, but regained some ground before plunging due to commission house selling. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Ganes, an analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York, blamed a number of 
factors. She said the market rose recently because of concerns about the 
political climate in the Ivory Coast, a major producer of cocoa. She said 
unstable conditions there have eased, largely removing market concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Also weighing on cocoa futures was the settlement of the Brazilian dock workers 
strike. Ganes noted that although the strike had not prompted a rally in the 
market, the settlement allowed the shipment of cocoa and gave those wanting to 
sell a reason to do so.

No Bottom in Sight for Gold -- Analysts 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices are headed lower, with no apparent signs of a halt to selling in 
sight despite this week's free fall to 1986 lows, market analysts said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no indication that the market has found a bottom, so we're likely to 
continue to move lower," said William O'Neill of Merrill, Lynch &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
He said the "ever-present threat" of sales by the Soviet Union, the world's 
second-largest gold producer after South Africa, continues to keep the market 
on edge. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, many traders fear Saudi Arabia has been selling large amounts of 
gold lately, leading to at least two sharp drops in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The gold market stabilized Friday, with the spot price in New York closing 
$1.10 higher at $355.70 an ounce on the New York Commodity Exchange, after 
tumbling $11 an ounce this week to the lowest since August, 1986, on talk of 
Soviet bullion sales. 
</P>
<P>
At Republic National Bank of New York later, the metal was quoted at $355, up 
$1.40 from late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Traders are also worried that any recovery in gold prices may attract 
aggressive selling by the Soviet Union.

Contrary to popular belief, salary is not the principal motivating factor 
influencing career choices among today's college students, according to a 
survey released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The study by Right Associates found that money ranked near the bottom of the 
list of factors influencing their career choice. 
</P>
<P>
Only one out of nine students said salary was the most important factor; 6% 
said their decision was the result of either luck or chance. 
</P>
<P>
More than 67% said they did not necessarily follow the careers of their parents 
and that their own interests and skills were the principal factors prompting 
their career choice. 
</P>
<P>
Four out of five of the respondents came from dual-career families in which 
both parents held professional positions, 
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted among college students who attended a recent 
company-sponsored series of career seminars in 12 cities: Philadelphia, 
Pittsburgh, Princeton, N.J., Atlanta, Boston, Cleveland, Houston, New York, 
Providence, R.I., San Francisco, Stamford, Conn., and Walnut Creek, Calif.

Cardiac pacemaker giant Medtronic Inc. said Friday that it had agreed to buy 
Bio-Medicus Inc. for $190 million in a bid to diversify its line of 
cardiovascular medical devices. 
</P>
<P>
The two biotechnology companies settled on a stock swap worth $25 a share to 
Bio-Medicus shareholders, but the value and stock swap ratio could change, 
based on fluctuations in Medtronic's stock price. 
</P>
<P>
Bio-Medicus' board accepted the bid in a meeting Thursday night, hours after 
Medtronic sweetened its bid.

CHILD CARE RECORDS ARE SEIZED;

<P>
SOCIAL SERVICES: STATE AGENCY IMPOUNDS FILES AS PART OF INVESTIGATION INTO 
COUNTY'S ALLEGED FAILURE TO PROTECT FOSTER CHILDREN.

State officials seized 15 filing cabinets full of county foster care records 
Friday while probing the alleged failure of the Los Angeles County Children's 
Services Department to protect foster children from molestation, abuse and 
neglect. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with an administrative subpoena and accompanied by two police officers, 
state officials supervised the loading of the green metal cabinets containing 
3,000 case files onto a truck. The documents were hauled to the State Building 
downtown for analysis, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Lawrence Bolton, assistant chief counsel for the State 
Department of Social Services, said he found files involving particularly 
"sensitive" foster care cases. Bolton found the files as he was looking into 
allegations that the county had mishandled a molestation complaint involving a 
foster home. 
</P>
<P>
A sampling of files in county offices on West 6th Street showed that county 
officials were improperly allowing foster parents to keep their licenses 
despite serious allegations, Bolton said. 
</P>
<P>
Bolton said most of the roughly 15 cases pulled as samples contained serious 
questions about their handling by county officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Our staff . . . found a pattern of very serious allegations involving 
molestation, neglect, abuse and criminal activity without legal action taken 
(by county officials)," he said. "Everything from drug addiction to shoot-outs 
in homes." 
</P>
<P>
Bolton said that in some cases county officials had allowed foster parents 
accused of abuse to continue to operate. In other cases, he said, such foster 
home operators were allowed to surrender their licenses without any revocation 
action. 
</P>
<P>
By failing to pursue license revocation, county officials had neglected to 
compile a legal record to prevent these foster parents from reapplying for 
foster care licenses or from obtaining licenses in related fields of care, 
Bolton said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Chafee, director of the county Children's Services Department, said it 
was unnecessary to seize the records. 
</P>
<P>
"We had agreed with them to go back through our files for as many years as it 
took to review all our actions to see if they were appropriate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that state officials were reacting prematurely to their sampling 
of case files. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody can shoot from the hip about this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Mandelstam, regional manager of the state Department of Social Services, 
was accompanied by a state policeman and a departmental officer when she 
presented an administrative subpoena to county officials. 
</P>
<P>
Police had been asked to accompany Mandelstam to assure that state officials 
would be given access to the county building, according to Fred Miller, deputy 
director of community care licensing for the state agency. 
</P>
<P>
Albert May, deputy director of county children's services, downplayed the 
significance of the state seizure. He said state officials probably were 
interested in reviewing the files because they are in the process of taking 
over from the county responsibility of licensing foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't really a surprise for us," he said. May said that about one-third of 
the documents seized were investigative files and that most of the others were 
cases that did not contain sufficient evidence to pursue license revocation. 
</P>
<P>
The county turned over the files in a "cooperative spirit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With respect to foster home care, the relationship between the state and the 
county has been contentious, however. The proposed new state budget transfers 
responsibilities for foster care licensing from the county to the state. 
Legislators made the budget recommendation after hearing renewed allegations 
that county officials have failed to protect foster children. 
</P>
<P>
Loren Suter, deputy director of state social services, said the files removed 
from the county would be analyzed in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is any indication that any of the people (accused of abuse) continue 
to have licenses (and) have kids placed with them, that will be the top 
priority (for legal action)." 
</P>
<P>
Suter said state officials were baffled over the county's alleged failure to 
take action in the sampling of cases they have reviewed.

CAMARENA JURY HEARS RECORDING; 
</P>
<P>
COURT: THE SPANISH-LANGUAGE TAPE CONTAINS 64 MINUTES OF INTERROGATION OF THE 
KIDNAPED AND SLAIN DEA AGENT. A 10-FOOT-HIGH TRANSLATION WAS BEAMED ONTO THE 
COURTROOM WALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal court jury in Los Angeles spent 64 minutes Friday listening to the 
taped interrogation of a desperate, dying U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 
agent who was trying to alternately placate and deceive narcotics traffickers 
and corrupt Mexican police officials who were torturing him at a house in 
Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
As the recording of agent Enrique Camarena and his interrogators was played in 
Spanish, jurors read a 10-foot-high English translation that was beamed onto a 
wall of the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena's plea, "Don't hurt my family!" was emblazoned for several seconds 
across the wall of the packed courtroom, as were the words "Don't hit me 
anymore," "Ouch!" and "Eeeow!"At one point, Camarena asked his interrogators: 
"Couldn't I ask you to have my ribs bandaged, please?" He was frequently heard 
groaning, particularly in the latter phases of the interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
The tapes contain several voices in addition to Camarena's. DEA officials have 
identified two of his interrogators as drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero and 
Mexican intelligence official Sergio Espino Verdin, both of whom are now 
imprisoned in Mexico after being convicted there for involvement in Camarena's 
1985 kidnaping, torture and murder. 
</P>
<P>
At several points in the tape, Camarena refers to his interrogator as 
"commandante," presumably a reference to Espino, who was a commander with 
Mexico's Federal Security Directorate. 
</P>
<P>
None of the men on trial in Los Angeles are mentioned in the tapes, nor is 
there any allegation that their voices are on them. But defense attorneys 
nonetheless tried for several days to prevent the tapes from being played, 
contending that they would prejudice the jury. U.S. District Judge Edward 
Rafeedie, however, ruled Thursday that prosecutors had a right to play them. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Manuel Medrano had argued that the actual tapes were the 
"best evidence" of Camarena's interrogation and accused the defense of 
attempting to keep relevant evidence away from the jury. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, defense lawyers lost a last-ditch bid to keep the tapes from 
being played when a federal appeals court panel in Pasadena denied their motion 
to overrule Rafeedie. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Rafeedie cautioned the jury just before the tapes were played that 
they constituted only one piece of evidence in the complex case and warned 
jurors not to be swayed by any emotional reaction that they might have to the 
tapes. 
</P>
<P>
At a break during the playing of the tapes Friday afternoon, defense lawyer 
Mary Kelly told reporters that the prosecution was playing the tapes simply "to 
get the prejudicial impact of the grunts and groans." 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutor Medrano countered: "We have to prove torture. This shows 
torture." 
</P>
<P>
Camarena was tortured for two days at a Guadalajara house owned by Caro. One of 
the interrogators methodically asked him questions about what he knew about 
Caro and other drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
The man asked Camarena detailed questions on what the DEA knew about the homes 
and businesses of Caro and Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, another drug kingpin. The 
interrogator also asked questions about two men who were informants for the 
DEA. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena grudgingly yielded some information, including some about one of 
Caro's airplanes, but told his inquisitors that he had little information that 
they were interested in and added that during the previous year he had not been 
very active and was looking forward to his transfer out of Guadalajara in less 
than three weeks time. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena, in fact, had been granted a transfer to San Diego after several years 
work in Guadalajara, but right up to the point of his kidnaping he had been 
investigating drug traffickers and their ties to Mexican police officials. 
</P>
<P>
The principal interrogator clearly knew a lot about DEA activities in Mexico 
and asked where certain DEA agents lived and what they were working on. On two 
occasions, he attempted to needle Camarena by asking him whether he was being 
paid off by Caro, which Camarena steadfastly denied. 
</P>
<P>
The DEA obtained the tapes in April, 1985, after a CIA agent received a tip 
from a Mexican informant. Mexican Federal Judicial Police officials told the 
DEA that the tapes had been recovered by local police in Puerta Vallarta when 
they arrested drug trafficker Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo. After the first set of 
tapes was recovered, transcripts of other tapes were also found. They have not 
yet been produced in this case. 
</P>
<P>
DEA officials have said they are not sure why the tapes were made. Some agency 
officials have speculated that the interrogation was recorded so that tapes 
could be played by drug traffickers and their allies in Mexican law enforcement 
who wanted to know what Camarena knew about their operations. 
</P>
<P>
In other developments Friday, two prosecution witnesses gave testimony that was 
beneficial to two of the defendants in the case. 
</P>
<P>
James Kuykendall, who ran the DEA office in Guadalajara at the time Camarena 
was killed, said he had interviewed defendant Ruben Zuno Arce in San Antonio, 
Tex., in September, 1986, and decided against arresting him at the time because 
he concluded that Zuno had no involvement in the kidnaping. He also said that 
as far as he knew at that time, Zuno was not part of the Guadalajara narcotics 
cartel. 
</P>
<P>
Zuno's lawyers said they were pleased by Kuykendall's statements, which were 
made on cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
In other testimony, the ex-wife of defendant Javier Vasquez Velasco described 
trips that she took with him in early 1985 that could serve as an alibi.

MENENDEZ BROTHER CUT LEG IRONS, DEPUTIES SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A chain binding the legs of Lyle Menendez, accused with his brother, Erik, of 
murdering their wealthy parents, was found cut nearly through in a Santa Monica 
courtroom lockup Friday in what sheriff's deputies reported as an escape 
attempt, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lt. William Sieber of the sheriff's fugitive warrant escape detail 
said he did not know whether the incident constituted an escape attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply know that the (leg) chain was tampered with and with individuals of 
this profile it has to be looked into . . . two of the links of the chain had 
been cut." 
</P>
<P>
The brothers had been waiting for a morning hearing before Superior Court Judge 
James Albracht when a deputy, who was removing Lyle's leg chain, noticed that 
the second link on each end of the chain had been cut nearly through, Sheriff 
Sgt. Bob Stoneman said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was cut to the point that all it could take was pressure by stepping on 
it," Stoneman said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, deputies searched the County Central Jail cells where the brothers are 
held and found handwritten documents that may be evidence of an escape attempt 
and filed an attempted-escape report, a sheriff spokesman said. However, no 
cutting tools were found, Sieber said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they will not know until the handwritten notes are analyzed if 
Erik was involved. 
</P>
<P>
Sieber noted that both brothers were still wearing waist chains in the lockup 
when the deputies noticed the damaged leg chain. He said if they had tried to 
escape, "They would have had to run like penguins." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers representing the brothers discounted the escape attempt report. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't cut through," said Gerald Chaleff, who represents Lyle. "There is no 
evidence that they found anything like that. Nobody mentioned to me that anyone 
had cut through any chains." 
</P>
<P>
Erik's attorney, Leslie Abramson, said the judge informed the lawyers around 
lunchtime that a sheriff's sergeant had advised him that deputies had 
discovered a "defective" link. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, the chains were miraculously whipped downtown before we could look at 
them," Abramson said. "There never was any evidence that Lyle was sawing his 
chains at any time. For all we know they found a defective link in a chain. 
</P>
<P>
"They subjected the boys to very vigorous searches at the courthouse this 
morning. They did not find anything. . . . I do not believe for a second that 
Lyle or Erik created whatever defect might have been in the chain. And I find 
this whole thing remarkably suspicious." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Elliott Alhadeff, the prosecutor, said he really did not 
know much about the escape-attempt report. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears the sheriff is taking it seriously," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers have been held since their arrest in a high-security area of the 
jail, and no additional security measures have been taken in light of the 
alleged escape attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle, 22, and Erik, 19, were arrested by Beverly Hills detectives in early 
March and charged with murdering their parents, Jose and Kitty, in their 
Beverly Hills mansion Aug. 20. The brothers pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
No date has been set for their preliminary hearing as the prosecution and 
defense jockey over what evidence can be made public. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers were brought to court Friday for a hearing requested by a 
psychologist on whether the tapes of a psychotherapy session should be returned 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the morning session when they wore civilian clothing, the brothers were 
returned to court in the afternoon wearing jail blues. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Albracht barred the public from the courtroom Friday, rejecting appeals 
for admission from media attorneys and relatives of the defendants. Lawyers 
from both sides met with him behind closed doors to discuss the controversial 
tape recordings, said to be the prosecution's key evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he believes there is a "legal necessity for closing most of 
these proceedings," despite objections from lawyers representing three major 
news organizations that the action was both unwarranted and unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Cardboard was placed over the windows and an armed sheriff's deputy was 
stationed outside the door, as lawyers began wrestling with the issue of 
whether taped conversations between the two defendants and their psychologist 
are confidential. 
</P>
<P>
Psychotherapy sessions are usually confidential, but prosecutors argued that 
threats allegedly made by the defendants in conversation with their Beverly 
Hills psychologist, Jerome Oziel, cancel out any requirement of 
confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
The audiotapes were among evidence seized in a search of the psychologist's 
Sherman Oaks home in March, hours before the arrest of Lyle Menendez. Erik 
surrendered to authorities several days later. 
</P>
<P>
The tapes allegedly contain statements implicating the brothers.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PROPERTY OWNERS WARNED ABOUT TAX BILLING 
ERRORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County property taxpayers who erroneously received tax delinquency 
notices this week are being asked to write, call or visit the county 
treasurer-tax collector's office to clear up the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of taxpayers got the notices because of computer processing errors. 
</P>
<P>
The errors appear to have occurred on fewer than 1% of the 290,000 delinquent 
notices mailed out Monday, said Assistant Treasurer-Tax Collector David 
Collins. 
</P>
<P>
Those who believe they have received notices by mistake can call a message 
number at 974-2111 and leave their name and property parcel number. Property 
owners can also mail copies of the front and back of their canceled checks with 
a copy of the bill to Treasurer &amp; Tax Collector, P.O. Box 2838, Los Angeles 
90012.

<P>
The trial date for nine Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department narcotics 
officers charged with stealing more than $1.4 million in seized narcotics 
profits has been pushed back three months at the request of defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie on Friday moved the trial from early July 
to Oct. 9 to allow the lawyers time to study more than 50,000 pages of

weeks before the trial to provide the defense with statements made by a 10th 
indicted officer, Sgt. Robert R. Sobel. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel, a 19-year veteran who headed the narcotics team staffed by most of the 
defendants, pleaded guilty and has cooperated with authorities.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY APPROVES PLAN TO SELL LANCER SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley on Friday approved a plan to sell the city's abandoned LANCER 
trash incinerator site in South-Central Los Angeles to a nonprofit group that 
plans to build 316 townhouses for low-income buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Standing at the industrial site where the housing project is planned, Bradley 
signed documents authorizing the city attorney's office to draw up a contract 
for the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Under the development plan, which will require another round of approvals by 
the City Council and mayor, the Nehemiah West Housing Corp. would buy the 12 
acres for $6.6 million, well below the city's investment of $9.1 million. The 
townhouses to be built there would cost $62,000, one-third the cost of 
comparable homes in Southern California.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACTOR CUSACK IS FINED FOR DRUNK DRIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor John Cusack must give up driving for 90 days and pay an $876 fine for 
driving drunk and crashing his car into another vehicle in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Cusack, 23, whose films include "Say Anything" and "The Sure Thing," had 
pleaded no contest to misdemeanor driving under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
The actor sent his attorney to Beverly Hills Municipal Court for sentencing 
Friday, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Greg Lawler. The penalties are standard for 
first-time offenders, Lawler said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Cusack's blood-alcohol level was 0.17%, more than twice the 
legal limit of 0.08, when he crashed Feb. 23 into a sports car on Santa Monica 
Boulevard. Neither driver was hurt.

As Mercedes-Benzes, Corvettes, BMWs and Jaguars were towed Friday from a La 
Cienega-Cadillac Avenue car dealership seized the day before by the Internal 
Revenue Service, neighborhood onlookers said they were not surprised by 
allegations that drug dealers were regular customers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was obvious," said one 20-year-resident who, declining to give his name, 
explained that many welfare recipients live in the surrounding blocks. "It 
would be like Bloomingdale's in the heart of Watts, like a welfare office in 
Beverly Hills, like caviar and ketchup." 
</P>
<P>
But one nearby store owner wondered why the dealership was singled out for 
simply doing business. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anything was going on except that drug dealers were buying 
cars," said the business owner, who also declined to give his name. "These 
agents are harassing businessmen in order to crack down on these drug dealers. 
It doesn't feel right." 
</P>
<P>
But Earl Acquaviva, chief of the IRS Criminal Investigation Division, said that 
the dealership, AMS Auto Sales at 2045 La Cienega Blvd., represents part of the 
large, underground, cash-only economy that is fed by the drug trade. AMS, he 
said, provided a money-laundering service to drug dealers who paid cash for 
$50,000 luxury autos that they could then resell. 
</P>
<P>
"One informant said this was the place to come to get your car if you were a 
drug dealer," Acquaviva said. "You could get a car for cash or for drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Three people arrested Thursday at the dealership -- Ahmad Reze Vosoughi, 32, 
Majid Ghassemieh, 33, and Sorena Meshgani Solati, 34 -- pleaded not guilty 
Friday in federal court to 16 charges of conspiracy, money laundering, filing 
false income tax forms and failure to file IRS Form 8300. 
</P>
<P>
Bail for Solati was set at $250,000, and Vosoughi and Ghassemieh were held 
without bail. 
</P>
<P>
The 8300 form requires that a record be filed with the IRS of all cash 
transactions totaling $10,000 or more. Although the car dealership filed some 
of the required forms, many were filled out with false names and car serial 
numbers, Acquaviva alleged. Many of the forms lacked adequate information to 
trace those involved in the financial deals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure and arrest represents the first major "8300 case" in the Western 
United States, Acquaviva said. 
</P>
<P>
IRS agents two years ago were tipped off to the dealership by informants and by 
California Highway Patrol officers who allegedly stopped known drug dealers 
driving cars from AMS, he said. IRS auditors then examined computerized 8300 
forms from the dealership. Meanwhile, IRS agents began surveillance and 
undercover operations. 
</P>
<P>
According to an affidavit filed in support of a search warrant, one informant 
told investigators that Vosoughi claimed that almost all of the customers who 
bought cars at AMS were narcotics dealers. In addition, the informant claimed 
to have sold 100 kilograms -- more than 200 pounds -- of cocaine to AMS 
customers from 1985 through 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Another informant claimed to have been offered cocaine by Ghassemieh on a 
trade-in of an expensive car for a cheaper one. 
</P>
<P>
The dealership represents part of the huge, underground cash economy supported 
by the drug trade, Acquaviva said. A measure of that growing economy are 
Federal Reserve Bank figures for Southern California's cash surplus, or the 
amount of money turned into banks. In 1985, the amount totaled $165.8 million. 
Last year, the figure was $3.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents have found that some businesses involve themselves in the drug 
economy by selling expensive electronic equipment, satellite dishes, furniture, 
jewelry and vacation packages for cash only. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of businesses run pure cash," Acquaviva said. "The underground economy 
has been around for a long time."' On Friday, Acquaviva stood in the car 
dealership office as phones rang nonstop. Outside on the lot, tow truck crews 
worked to pull out 40 cars and a 25-foot power boat for transfer to the U.S. 
marshal's impound lot. 
</P>
<P>
Two dealerships and one individual already had complained earlier Friday that 
their cars had been placed on the lot by consignment and were not owned by AMS, 
Acquaviva said. Once state Department of Motor Vehicles records are checked, 
the cars will be returned to the legal owners, he said. Those owned by AMS will 
be kept by the federal government and sold to agencies that might use them for 
undercover operations, he added. 
</P>
<P>
But one unhappy Mercedes owner, who declined to give his name, worried that his 
car might be held by the government for as long as six months. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to sell it; I need the money," the man said as he stood outside the 
chained fence around the dealership. 
</P>
<P>
Friends had told him that the dealership sold exotic cars and he had brought 
his 1984 Mercedes to AMS only last week. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my luck," he said.

82-YEAR-OLD LOSES $921,000 TO BURGLARS POSING AS UTILITY WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
An 82-year-old retired bus driver who had spent 40 years collecting rare coins 
and currency lost most of his collection Friday when burglars posing as utility 
workers stole the money in what police call a common scam. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Ardell Hoffman of Elysian Park reported $921,000 in currency and 
gold coins missing from a bedroom safe after a man who said he was from the 
Southern California Gas Co. lured him to his garage, pretending to check his 
gas lines. Meanwhile, an accomplice burglarized Hoffman's home, taking the 
money from the open safe, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a reporter, however, Hoffman said only slightly more than 
$7,000 was taken. 
</P>
<P>
In explaining the discrepancy, Officer Anthony Konya of the Los Angeles Police 
Department, said Hoffman may have become concerned about publicizing how much 
money he kept in his home. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman told the reporter that the money taken was mostly in one envelope that 
contained 70 hundred-dollar bills. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar scam, at least six women in Hollywood and South Los Angeles, all 
in their 80s, have reported being robbed in the last two weeks by con artists 
claiming to be with the Department of Water and Power. Los Angeles police 
detectives said dozens of other victims have come forth in recent months from 
throughout the city and that they suspect many more have been burglarized but 
haven't noticed anything missing or are too scared to call police. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they are checking to see if the two scams are related. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Chris Smith of the Northeast Division, which covers Elysian Park, noted 
that the theft at Hoffman's home is the first such incident to have occurred in 
his area recently. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman's money -- stacked in $1,000, $100 and $2 bills -- and gold coins were 
taken from a combination-lock floor safe that had been left open because 
Hoffman, an avid currency and coin collector, was cataloguing the money when 
the men arrived, said Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman said he was upset by the burglary, but was relieved that a prized 
45-caliber automatic pistol from World War II, in which he served as a Navy 
gunner, was not stolen. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a strong heart, so I'll survive," he said. "But they should catch the 
guys who did it because they're no good." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman told police a man wearing a baseball cap with a gas company logo and a 
yellow field-type jacket came to his home about 12:30 p.m. Friday, identified 
himself as an employee and said he needed to check the gas lines in Hoffman's 
garage, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman went out the back door and joined the man in the garage. Another man 
apparently got in through the back door and burglarized the home, Smith said. 
He found the safe open in the bedroom and helped himself to the cache. 
</P>
<P>
The men, described as clean-cut and in their 30s, most likely did not know 
beforehand that Hoffman had the money in the safe, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman said that after he left the garage and went back into the house, he 
noticed that the front door -- which was normally locked -- was open. He 
immediately thought of the safe, ran to it and saw that the money was missing. 
By that time, the men and the cash were gone.

NURSE GETS DEATH IN MURDER CASE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: SHE HAD ROOMMATE KILLED TO COLLECT MORTGAGE INSURANCE. HER EXECUTION 
WOULD BE 5TH OF A WOMAN IN STATE HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A 42-year-old registered nurse, tearfully protesting her innocence, was 
sentenced Friday to die in the gas chamber for hiring a co-worker to murder her 
roommate so she could collect a $100,000 mortgage insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
Maureen McDermott, a former nurse at County-USC Medical Center, became the 
second woman sentenced to die in California since the death penalty was 
reinstated in 1978, prison officials said. If executed, she would be the fifth 
woman ever to be killed by the state. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a black suit, McDermott sat stoically as Van Nuys Superior Court Judge 
Alan B. Haber formally sentenced her to death for the April 28, 1985, murder of 
Stephen Eldridge. 
</P>
<P>
Haber described McDermott -- whose work was highly praised by superiors and 
co-workers at the hospital -- as "a compassionate nurse during her career," but 
said "the circumstances of the crime demonstrate that Miss McDermott had a 
complete disregard for human life." 
</P>
<P>
A jury on March 2 convicted McDermott of first-degree murder with special 
circumstances in Eldridge's death and of attempted murder in a March 21, 1985, 
knife attack on Eldridge arranged by McDermott. The same jury unanimously 
recommended last April that McDermott die for the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Eldridge, 27, was stabbed 44 times and his penis cut off in the Van Nuys home 
he co-owned with McDermott. Prosecutors alleged that McDermott paid a former 
orderly at County-USC Medical Center, James Flores Luna, to kill Eldridge and 
mutilate his body in hopes that police would mistake it for a homosexual crime 
of passion. 
</P>
<P>
She also induced Luna to carry out the earlier attempt on Eldridge's life, then 
comforted Eldridge while plotting another attempt, the prosecution charged. 
Eldridge confided to a friend that he felt secure when McDermott was with him, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Katherine Mader. 
</P>
<P>
McDermott, who did not testify in her own behalf, spoke for the first time 
since her trial began, accusing the judge of favoring the prosecution. "I want 
you to know I have no fear of dying. However, I wish not to die in vain," she 
told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
"I have sat in this courtroom and listened to the district attorney verbally 
rape me and witnesses perjure themselves," McDermott continued, referring to 
Mader. 
</P>
<P>
"Never in my life have I ever come across such a power-hungry woman . . . with 
so little integrity. I did not kill Steven Eldridge and I had nothing to do 
with the murder," McDermott said, breaking into tears. 
</P>
<P>
Eldridge's brother, Patrick -- speaking for his mother, father and sister, who 
sat quietly in the front row of the courtroom -- asked the judge to order 
McDermott put to death. "Nothing we do or say here today will ever bring Steven 
Eldridge back, but we want to make sure she never does it to another person," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mader told Haber that McDermott "has shown no remorse" for the killing and 
called her "one of the coldest human beings you will ever see." 
</P>
<P>
Carl Burkow, one of McDermott's two court-appointed lawyers, had urged the 
judge to sentence McDermott to life in prison without the possibility of 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Luna, the key witness against McDermott, made a deal with 
prosecutors under which he was spared the risk of the death penalty in exchange 
for his testimony. Luna, 36, pleaded guilty to murder with special 
circumstances and is scheduled to be sentenced July 6. Two other men who helped 
kill Eldridge received immunity in exchange for testifying.

QUAKE UPGRADE MAY START IN YEAR; 
</P>
<P>
SEISMIC: FUNDS FOR BOLSTERING CITY BUILDINGS, BRIDGES IN L.A. WILL COME FROM 
$376-MILLION BOND ISSUE APPROVED BY VOTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Repair work on City Hall and other city buildings and bridges could begin 
within a year as a result of Tuesday's passage of Proposition G, a $376-million 
bond issue to upgrade aging municipal structures to meet earthquake standards, 
Los Angeles city officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The ballot measure, which required a two-thirds majority for passage, won with 
72% of the votes cast. 
</P>
<P>
Almost one-third of the money -- about $112 million -- will be earmarked to 
repair the historic 27-story City Hall. Also on the priority list of projects 
are 136 multispan bridges, including several built in the 1920s that link 
downtown with the Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 459 city-owned bridges are scheduled for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"The measure will allow the city to make necessary repairs for the movement of 
emergency vehicles during and after a major earthquake," said City Councilman 
Richard Alatorre, the proposition's author and chairman of the council's Public 
Safety Committee. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the measure will also allow strengthening of buildings vital to 
maintaining public order, such as police and fire stations and those frequently 
used by the general public. In the last category, he said, are the Anderson 
Memorial Senior Recreation Center in San Pedro and the outdoor 6,200-seat Greek 
Theater in the Hollywood Hills, where the stage needs strengthening. 
</P>
<P>
Also considered of particular importance are the 11 historic structures -- 
including the Avila Abode, the city's oldest building -- at Olvera Street, the 
aging Mexican marketplace north of the Civic Center. About $16 million has been 
set aside for seismic work there. 
</P>
<P>
The city would be "exposed to a great deal of liability" at Olvera Street if 
there is a substantial loss of life due to an earthquake since as many as 2 
million people visit the tourist spot each year, Alatorre said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Engineer Rodney Haraga said the repair work authorized by the 
proposition on 84 buildings and 459 bridges should be completed in five to 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the design work on City Hall, completed in 1928, has not begun. 
</P>
<P>
According to city officials, it is an ambitious program to update the building 
that was the tallest structure in Los Angeles until a 13-story height limit was 
removed in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
The City Hall repair work includes bracing its aging floors and towers, 
strengthening unreinforced interior walls, repairing outdoor tilings and adding 
more stairwells. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre and others at a City Hall news conference said it was unlikely that 
repair work would close any of the structures. But they added that some bridges 
might be closed if repair work was required on top of the bridge decks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BRIDGES NEEDING REPAIR: THE TOP 10 
</P>
<P>
Here are the top 10 city-owned bridges that are badly in need of repair out of 
a total 459.

POP BEAT / ALTERNATIVE: MAZZY STAR DEBUT A FINE FIX OF VELVET BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former leader of one of Los Angeles' prominent "paisley underground" bands 
and his new femme fatale have made the L.A. record that has drawing the most 
attention in the alternative/college rock world at large. But Mazzy Star isn't 
the only Southern California band that's been busy in the studio. Pop Beat's 
alternative-rock edition focuses today on independent releases by Southern 
California performers, rated on a scale of one star (poor) to five (a classic). 
</P>
<P>
*** 1/2 Mazzy Star, "She Hangs Brightly," Rough Trade. Through the early '80s, 
David Roback led the Rain Parade on a quixotic quest to restore some of the 
values of psychedelia to contemporary rock. Leaving that to others, he then 
teamed with the Dream Syndicate's Kendra Smith in Opal, establishing an 
aesthetic centered on moody atmospheres and haunting female vocals. 
</P>
<P>
Mazzy Star is more in the Opal tradition: austere country blues with Velvet 
Underground bloodlines (one guitar solo practically quotes the Velvets' "I'll 
Be Your Mirror"). Singer Hope Sandoval isn't quite Nico: Her cool detachment 
rarely translates as aloofness. Electric or acoustic, the settings are stripped 
down to basics -- often just a guitar strum, bass cushion and tambourine 
timekeeping. A juiced-up Cowboy Junkies for the Bohemian set, Mazzy Star 
sustains a dark beauty. 
</P>
<P>
*** Swamp Zombies, "Scratch and Sniff Car Crash," Doctor Dream. These Orange 
County cutups' beatnik-folk-punk is sometimes abrasive, but it ultimately 
yields an authentic and affecting depiction of the uncertain emotional 
geography between the stages of schoolboy and young man. Setting its context in 
the Southern California youth/rock world, it has the real flavor of living this 
life in this specific place (not to mention the literally real aroma of burned 
rubber promised by the title). 
</P>
<P>
** 3D Picnic, "Dirt," Earth Music/Cargo. Someone must have told this L.A. band 
that it should stay unpredictable by emphasizing variety. That's true to a 
point, but it's self-defeating when it leaves you with no identity. This 
unfocused collection is a long march through punk, folk, country and pop 
terrain with little in the way of memorable words or sounds, and the thin lead 
vocals often adopt that warbling, smarty inflection that afflicted so much "new 
wave" music back in the late '70s. When they don't try so hard, the group shows 
some possibilities. But they're usually trying too hard. 
</P>
<P>
* 1/2 Christine in the Attic, "Christine in the Attic," Christine in the Attic. 
Beware of fledgling bands in the hands of "superstar" producers. Englishman Ken 
Scott's career encompasses greatness (David Bowie's "Hunky Dory") and infamy 
(Missing Persons), and his heavy hand on this five-song, 23-minute collection 
is more reminiscent of the latter's crassness than the former's artistry. With 
huge, throbbing, crashing, orchestral arrangements framing Christine Russell's 
theatrical, aggressive rock vocals, it's so preoccupied with being right that 
it lacks all personality and spirit. 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 Clay Idols, "Falling Down Backwards," Genius. Chamber folk-rock for the 
Bruce Hornsby crowd? The L.A. band makes it sound like a good idea through much 
of this album, which is marked by a sparkling sound and an ornate weave of 
guitars, strings and voices. Steven Schayer's gruff voice -- a bit Bruce 
Springsteen and a lot Richie Havens -- is convincing in small doses as he 
delivers lyrics obliquely evocative of emotional distress. But over the course 
of a whole album it becomes overly dominant and self-absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
** Nick Pyzow Band, "Adobe &amp; Diamonds," AsFab. The singer-songwriter is 
painfully earnest, some of his folk/country/rock is agreeable enough, and he 
displays some decent songwriting craft. But Pyzow's dry voice is way too 
expressionless to do anything memorable with his lyrics, and the whole 
undertaking bespeaks journeyman competence.

POWER OUTAGE CUTS OFF 2 RADIO STATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Los Angeles radio stations -- KKGO-FM (105.1) and KPFK-FM (90.7) -- went 
off the air for much of Friday after an electrical transformer blew up in 
remote Mt. Wilson, cutting power to the stations' mountaintop transmitters. 
</P>
<P>
The outage occurred shortly before 5 a.m., said Melanie Savage, a Southern 
California Edison spokeswoman. Both stations were reduced to static as Edison 
crews worked to replace the transformer. 
</P>
<P>
Edison was hoping to restore power by midafternoon, Savage said. The cause of 
the outage was not immediately known, and fewer than a dozen homes, if any, 
were affected. 
</P>
<P>
Each hour of dead air cost KKGO thousands of dollars, because paid commercials 
were not broadcast, said Saul Levine, the station's general manager. Levine 
said KKGO will soon install an emergency generator to prevent future outages. 
KPFK, a noncommercial broadcaster, did not suffer any losses. 
</P>
<P>
KKGO is one of Los Angeles' few classical FM stations, having switched from 30 
years of broadcasting jazz in a controversial move last January. KPFK is known 
for its eclectic, if sometimes ragged, programming that ranges from New Age to 
Indian music to a program called "Communist Party U.S.A."

PRESBYTERIANS END SESSION ON ENVIRONMENTAL, NON-SEXIST NOTE;

UNITY: CHURCH ASSEMBLY ADJOURNS AMID HOPES OF REVERSING MEMBERSHIP SLIDE, 
HALTING INTERNAL BICKERING AND SEEKING ACCORD WITH MORMONS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Presbyterians, equipped with a contemporary statement of non-sexist, 
environmentally attuned faith, ended their 202nd General Assembly this week 
with hopes of spreading unity in their ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Newly elected Moderator Price Henderson Gwynn III of Charlotte, N.C., set the 
tone for the meeting of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), saying the church can 
reverse its membership slide of the last quarter-century if members stop 
fighting each other. 
</P>
<P>
"If we shoot ourselves in the foot because of internecine warfare or 
denominational myopia, we are going to have to answer for it," said Gwynn, who 
will act as a traveling spokesman for the church over the next 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
The 2.9-million-member denomination has lost a third of its members since the 
mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
The more than 600 commissioners to the annual meeting overwhelmingly approved a 
new statement of faith, postponed action on altering church stands on abortion 
and homosexuality and agreed to explore further relations with the Mormon 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
In the land where Brigham Young established the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, the assembly approved by a 499-25 vote the denomination's 
first statement of faith since a 1983 merger between the so-called Southern 
Presbyterians and the larger, nationwide Presbyterian body healed a Civil 
War-era split over slavery. 
</P>
<P>
The document, which mixes traditional Christian beliefs with environmental 
concerns and images of God as both father and mother, will be sent to the 
denomination's 177 presbyteries. 
</P>
<P>
If the confession is approved by two-thirds of the regional groups and by the 
1991 General Assembly, it will become the 11th statement of faith in the 
denomination's Book of Confessions. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we know, this is the first confession of the church that declares as 
a matter of faith women are called to all ministries of the church," said Jane 
Dempsey Douglass, vice chairwoman of the drafting committee. 
</P>
<P>
The confession also likens God to both a mother who will not forsake her 
nursing child and a father "who runs to welcome the prodigal home." 
</P>
<P>
On the environment, the confession says humans deserve God's condemnation for 
the way they "threaten death to the planet entrusted to our care." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the statement upholds centuries-old church teachings that 
Jesus Christ was both fully human and fully God, and that God raised Jesus from 
the dead to offer eternal life. 
</P>
<P>
Although noting the discrimination faced by non-Mormons in Utah, the assembly 
also accepted a report calling for opening an informal dialogue with the Mormon 
Church -- an exercise in diplomacy at the meeting site that may turn out to be 
significant only for smoothing relations for the 5,000 Presbyterians living in 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Many non-Mormons say life is not easy in a state where about 70% of the state's 
1.6 million residents are Mormon, as are the governor and 98% of state 
legislators. 
</P>
<P>
The report to the Presbyterian General Assembly prepared by the Presbytery of 
Utah cites one survey that found a majority of non-Mormons believed local 
companies are biased in hiring and promoting employees, and another that showed 
the majority of Mormon residents are unaware of any bias toward non-Mormons. 
</P>
<P>
"The church leaders encourage members to go out of their way to be kind to 
neighbors of other faiths. That's our policy," said Don LeFevre, director of 
media relations. The Mormons, however, have no plans to back down on 
proselytism. "Our philosophy is we have something so precious we would like to 
show it," LeFevre said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the church has always backed freedom of conscience for all religious 
groups, and he characterized individual acts of unfriendliness toward 
non-Mormons as isolated instances. 
</P>
<P>
Several resolutions relating to abortion and homosexuality were postponed until 
1991, when a special Task Force on Human Sexuality is scheduled to make its 
report. The denomination supports legalized abortion, and opposes the 
ordination of homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
"They seem to be bending over backwards to be kind to one another and avoid 
controversial issues," Parker T. Williamson of the Presbyterian Layman, a 
conservative publication, said after the votes to defer action. 
</P>
<P>
But in a move criticized by several commissioners as avoiding dispute at the 
price of suppressing dissent, the assembly voted to take away semi-official 
church status from 21 Presbyterian organizations, including some of the 
denomination's staunchest liberal and conservative critics. 
</P>
<P>
The discussion was sparked by an uproar caused last summer when Presbyterians 
for Lesbian-Gay Concerns distributed sexually explicit pamphlets to high school 
and college youths at a church meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The assembly vote, which still must be approved by a majority of the regional 
presbyteries, would take away the right to be officially represented at church 
meetings from not only the homosexual caucus but other liberal groups such as 
the Witherspoon Society and conservative groups such as the Presbyterian Lay 
Committee and Presbyterians Pro-Life. 
</P>
<P>
If a majority of the regional presbyteries agree, the organizations will no 
longer "be attached officially to the church," said Marj Carpenter, news 
director of the church. 
</P>
<P>
In other business, the assembly voted to allocate $1 million for a five-year 
program to set up self-help programs for black men. The church is less than 2% 
black. 
</P>
<P>
Also, by approving a 93-page document called "Restoring Creation for Ecology 
and Justice," commissioners voted to establish a denominational office on 
environmental justice, and incorporate environmental concerns into worship and 
preaching, education programs and community ministries.

FACES . . . : BAILEY'S LADIES

<TEXT>
<P>
Stop by the Hollywood Roosevelt tonight, and you'll swear Judy Garland has 
returned from somewhere over the rainbow to entertain in the hotel's Cinegrill 
Lounge. The woman on stage looks, talks and certainly sings like Judy . . . but 
she's not Judy. In fact, she is really a he -- Jim Bailey, whose one-woman, er, 
man, act runs Wednesdays through Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, who also does shows as Barbra Streisand and Peggy Lee, may put on 
women's clothes, but don't call him a female impersonator. "I call myself an 
illusionist, because what I do has to do with magic," says Bailey, who has 
persuaded audiences from Carnegie Hall to Buckingham Palace. "Basically, it's 
character acting." 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, who studied classical opera in Philadelphia in the 1960s, got his start 
as an illusionist after he became friends with Phyllis Diller. "I started 
picking up her mannerisms," he recalls. When others began to notice the 
resemblance, Bailey quietly put together a show. He got his big break when a 
club owner asked him to take the place of the real Diller, who had just 
canceled a gig at his club. "They really thought I was Phyllis Diller," he says 
of that audience. 
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward, Bailey says, "I started thinking about singing," and he added 
Garland, Lee and Streisand to his repertoire. Now he performs an entire show as 
a single character. "I used to come out at the end of the show and do some 
songs as Jim Bailey. But I've created a monster," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to be a successful singer on my own, but I created these 
singing ladies that are successful, and now I have to take a back seat." 
</P>
<P>
Bailey imagines his show must be a bit unnerving to the women he portrays. "If 
I were to walk into a theater and see someone doing me," he says, "I'd look 
around to see if the audience was buying it." 
</P>
<P>
Bailey appears Wednesday through next Saturday as Garland and June 20-23 and 
27-30 as Lee. LAUREN LIPTON

FACES . . . : BIG BAD JAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAUREN LIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As an actor, Brion James has died a thousand deaths. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first sequel I've ever been in, because I rarely live through a 
film," notes James, who currently co-stars in "Another 48 HRS.," which opened 
yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
James, who plays Nick Nolte's partner in the Paramount action/comedy, is almost 
always cast as a bad guy -- consequently, he says, "I've been boiled in oil, 
I've had my head ripped off by a freeway overpass, I've been thrown off a 
cliff. . . . I've killed a lot of people too." 
</P>
<P>
Other actors might complain of being typecast, but James -- who has had wicked 
roles in such films as "Blade Runner," "Southern Comfort," and "Tango and Cash" 
-- claims that he has been afforded infinite variety. "I play a lot of 
different villains," he says. "I also specialize in dialects," he adds, 
breaking into a thick patois: "You tok like thees for Czechoslovakian," and 
slides from there into Cockney, proper English, an Arkansas twang and a Texas 
drawl. "It's great to be able to change your look and the way you speak," he 
finishes, in his normal voice. 
</P>
<P>
While some have argued that screen violence eventually makes viewers more 
violent themselves, James disagrees. "I don't know if you can ever get 
anesthetized to violence," he says. "Film reflects society, society does not 
reflect film. If you see violence on film, and you see that it doesn't pay off, 
it's a moral lesson. The good guy almost always wins." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his affinity toward villains, James' ideal role would be "the last 
remake of the Hunchback of Notre Dame -- a great empathetic role" -- but a 
character, nevertheless, who meets his peril by falling from a tower. 
</P>
<P>
As for James' fate in "Another 48 HRS.," well, he's not telling. -- L. L.

PETROVIC AND DIVAC WOULD PREFER TO SIT OUT WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS

Drazen Petrovic, a reserve guard for the Portland Trail Blazers and a former 
member of the Yugoslav national team, said his country's basketball federation 
wants him and Laker center Vlade Divac, another Yugoslav, to play in the World 
Championships in Argentina in August. 
</P>
<P>
"They want me to play in the Goodwill (Games, in July) and the championships," 
Petrovic said. 
</P>
<P>
"They want Divac to play, too. But we play double the number of games here, and 
I need a rest. I get a little tired. I'd like to stay (in Portland) because I 
want to play in rookie camp in July." 
</P>
<P>
After the Lakers were eliminated from the playoffs, Divac said he did not want 
to play for the Yugoslav national team this summer because he was tired. 
Petrovic said he hasn't spoken to Divac since the playoffs began, but the Trail 
Blazer guard said Yugoslav officials may hold up Divac's military deferment 
should he balk at playing in the World Championships. SAM McMANIS

BULLARD OUT IN USC TRACK SHAKEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ernie Bullard has been removed as the USC men's track coach, and the men's and 
women's programs will be reorganized under a single coaching staff, it was 
announced Friday by Athletic Director Mike McGee. 
</P>
<P>
The consolidated coaching staff will consist of a head coach, two full-time 
assistants, a part-time assistant and a volunteer assistant. McGee said that 
the operating budget and number of scholarships will not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
Bullard, the Trojan men's coach the last six years, has been offered 
reassignment within the USC athletic department, and second-year women's coach 
Mike Bailey has accepted one of the full-time assistant coaching positions. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Knuth, an assistant men's coach for six years, has resigned. 
</P>
<P>
The status of men's assistants Don Quarrie and Jim Bush will be determined by 
the new coach, according to McGee. 
</P>
<P>
Bullard, 53, said he anticipates accepting an unspecified job within the 
athletic department. He plans to retire in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
Possible candidates for the combined USC coaching position are Ron Allice, the 
Long Beach City College track coach; Ted Banks, the former Texas El Paso coach, 
now at Riverside Community College; John Chaplin, Washington State's track 
coach, and Art Venegas, UCLA's weight coach. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, the former successful head track coach at UCLA, has indicated to friends 
that he would rather remain at USC as an assistant, specializing in coaching 
hurdlers. 
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the restructuring of the program was, in part, prompted by 
USC's failure to make a significant showing in the recent NCAA meet. The men's 
team scored only nine points and the women scored 10 on Ashley Selman's first 
place in the javelin. 
</P>
<P>
USC has won 26 NCAA track championships, more than any other school and has had 
23 gold medal winners in the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
But the Trojans haven't won an NCAA track title since 1976 and haven't been 
competitive in the Pacific 10 or nationally recently 
</P>
<P>
"I feel kind of burned out now," Bullard said Friday. "It's been a difficult 
year. I thought we had to come through in the NCAA (meet) and for whatever 
reason we didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"My first response, to a degree, is relief," Bullard said. "You only have so 
much energy to put into everything. Maybe this is the best move for me. I love 
coaching, but I have no aspirations to coach again." 
</P>
<P>
Bullard is a former USC pole vaulter who coached at San Jose State before 
becoming USC's coach in 1985.

RILEY: 'ONLY BUSS AND I KNOW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Pat Riley, addressing growing speculation about his status as Laker coach, said 
Friday that he will announce his decision next week but indicated that only he 
and team owner Jerry Buss know any details of his situation. 
</P>
<P>
"This week coming up, without a doubt, it'll be decided upon," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are only two people who know what's going on, and that's Dr. Buss and 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
People close to Riley, including assistant coaches Bill Bertka and Randy Pfund, 
have said they have received indications that Riley is going to leave coaching 
after nine seasons with the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
But Riley would only reiterate that his situation will be resolved soon. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry West, the Lakers' general manager, already has compiled a list of 
possible replacements, including, but not limited to, assistant coach Mike 
Dunleavy of the Milwaukee Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he understands West's motives in formulating a contingency plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't (blame) him," Riley said. "They've got a job to do in the 
organization. The Lakers are in a business. I don't mind them looking into 
that. I haven't decided yet, but that process (of interviewing candidates) is 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry was probably put in a poor position by me on this whole thing. They've 
got moves to make. They've got a draft to prepare for. Jerry's got a team to 
run. I appreciate Dr. Buss and Jerry giving me the time I asked for."

GATHERS' DEATH BRINGS FORTH SECOND SUIT; 
</P>
<P>
AFTERMATH: MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR SUIT FILED ON BEHALF OF GATHERS' SON AND ESTATE. 
IT WILL PROBABLY BE COMBINED WITH ORIGINAL SUIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys representing the son and estate of Hank Gathers filed a 
multimillion-dollar suit Friday, claiming that the former basketball star died 
because of negligence by doctors and Loyola Marymount officials who conspired 
by concealing medical information to ensure Gathers would continue playing for 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, a Loyola Marymount basketball player, collapsed March 4 at Gersten 
Pavilion while playing in a West Coast Conference tournament game, and was 
pronounced dead 1 hour 40 minutes later at Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital. An 
autopsy determined the cause of death to be cardiomyopathy, a heart disorder. 
</P>
<P>
The 36-page complaint, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, names 14 
defendants and cites three counts on behalf of Gathers' estate and four counts 
on behalf of Aaron Crump, Gathers' 6-year-old son who lives in Philadelphia 
with his mother, Marva Crump. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint, which does not list a monetary figure, was filed by Los Angeles 
probate attorney Ken Wolf and Philadelphia attorneys Martin Krimsky and Adrian 
Moody. Krimsky, who is the court-appointed administrator of the estate, and 
Michael Horsey, Aaron's guardian and a family adviser to Marva Crump, are the 
plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to put a dollar amount in a complaint to make it look 
expensive, it's what you prove at trial," Wolf said. "We know, though, that we 
are asking more than a million dollars by just looking at the wrongful death 
claim from the estate's standpoint, as well as the other claims. How high is 
high?" 
</P>
<P>
The 14 defendants in the suit are Loyola Marymount University and four Loyola 
employees -- Athletic Director Brian Quinn, Coach Paul Westhead, trainer Chip 
Schaefer and Dr. Dan Hyslop of the university's health services. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors named are Michael Mellman and his company, Mellman and Moe; 
cardiologists Vernon Hattori and Charles Swerdlow and their company, Apex 
Cardiology Consultants; Ralph Gambardella, Clarence Shields and Benjamin 
Schaeffer, all Loyola team physicians supplied by the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic 
Clinic, which was also named. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second suit in the aftermath of Gathers death against these same 
defendants. On April 20, a $32.5-million suit was filed by Beverly Hills 
attorney Bruce Fagel on behalf of Gathers' mother, Lucille, brothers Derrick 
and Charles, and an aunt, Carol Livingston. Wolf said a motion will be filed 
shortly to consolidate the two suits. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead has previously denied all allegations against him. Loyola attorney 
Martin L. Burke also said previously that the "University and its members will 
be fully vindicated." 
</P>
<P>
One of the counts -- charging negligence by all defendants -- asks the estate 
be paid $1 million for a Lloyd's of London policy in the same amount Gathers 
bought his junior year in college. The policy, which would have paid Gathers if 
he had suffered a medical condition that prevented him from playing competitive 
basketball, did not include death benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"If Hank would have been properly advised of his condition and properly 
treated, he would not have played basketball," Krimsky said from Philadelphia. 
"And if he would have been given the proper treatment courtside, he would have 
survived and been able to collect." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wolf said settlement negotiations continue between attorneys for 
both sides.

apparently changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
Will Kern, director of meet, said that Lewis has entered three events: the 100 
and 200 meters and the long jump. However, it's believed that Lewis probably 
will compete in only the 100 meters.

YACHT RACE HAS LITTLE WIND, PLENTY OF CONFUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sailors who coped best with the wind and outwitted the race committee moved 
to the front of the fleets on Friday, the first day of the Long Beach Yacht 
Club's Ullman Sails-Washington Insurance Race Week. 
</P>
<P>
The first race was delayed an hour waiting for wind, which was 6-8 knots for 
the first races, then shifted 45 degrees eastward as it built to 12 knots after 
the the starts of the second races. The unusual shift created a nightmare for 
the race committees and parades of reaches over the windward-leeward courses 
instead of upwind-downwind legs, for the sailors. 
</P>
<P>
When the shift started, the committees altered the courses to compensate. But, 
on the A course for the larger handicap fleets, that only caused confusion 
because the faster boats -- most notably Peter Tong's ultralight Blondie -- had 
already lapped some slower boats, and most boats didn't notice the new bearing 
to the weather mark indicated by code flags on the committee boat. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the day, the committee was considering scrapping the Fifties 
fleet race altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Ullman, sailing Don Hughes' Reichell-Pugh 42 Quintessence, placed first 
and second in his first two races, opening a bid to win the IOR-A class of the 
event -- formerly Long Beach Race Week -- for the fourth year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie Haines won both IOR-B races with Irv Loube's Farr 40 Bravura, and Steve 
Steiner and Alan Adams led the Fifties in their custom Steiner 58 with a first 
and a third. 
</P>
<P>
Haines, a 1984 Olympic gold medalist in the Soling class, was a full boat 
length over the starting line in the second race but was screened from the 
committee boat by Mike Wooten's Allegiance, which returned to restart as Haines 
kept on sailing. 
</P>
<P>
Steve and father Barney Flam weren't so lucky aboard their J/35 Flambouyant on 
the B course, where the one-designs competed. The Flams, who won the event in 
1988, sailed second to David Dale-Johnson's Paleface in both races but were 
disqualified in the second for a premature start.

<P>
Jeff Teeters, a 30-year-old concrete contractor from Garden Grove, doesn't know 
who shot at him on the freeway in Long Beach. He doesn't know why. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I knew was that glass shattered on the passenger side of my 
truck and fell against me," Teeters said. "Then I felt this warmth. I looked 
down, and my shirt was covered with blood. . . . There were several shots. 
</P>
<P>
"Bam, bam, bam, then boom, a big shot, and that's the one that threw me against 
the door." 
</P>
<P>
Teeters said he later learned that at least two people, using two different 
weapons -- a .38-caliber pistol and a shotgun -- fired four or five times at 
him about 10:40 p.m. Thursday on the Artesia Freeway (California 91) in Long 
Beach. A white car drove alongside him, he said, and several shots were fired, 
then the car disappeared into the night. 
</P>
<P>
Teeters, in a hospital interview in Long Beach, said: "I have no idea why this 
happened. It was just a random shooting. I guess I'm just lucky to be alive." 
</P>
<P>
Tetters suffered three gunshot wounds, in the jaw, neck and chest. Officials at 
the Memorial Medical Center of Long Beach said Friday that he is in "fair" 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach police said Friday that they have no suspects. "The victim has no 
idea who shot him," Lt. Gary Whinery said. "We responded to his call at 10:50 
p.m. after he got off at Cherry (Avenue) from the 91 Freeway." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Kohler, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol in Sacramento, said 
Friday that there have been nine fatalities from freeway violence since June, 
1987, when the CHP began keeping such statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Kohler said the freeway deaths include varied causes, from thrown rocks to 
shootings, and he said the statistics are not broken down to show the number of 
shootings only. 
</P>
<P>
He said CHP figures also show that from June, 1987, to March of this year, 179 
injuries were caused by deliberate freeway violence. 
</P>
<P>
"That sounds worse than it is statistically, considering the millions of 
drivers and millions of miles driven," he said. "I'm not downplaying the 
violence, but statistically a much higher percentage of deaths and injuries are 
caused by DUI" (driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol). 
</P>
<P>
CHP investigators have found varied causes for freeway shootings and other 
violence. But often the spark is something minor, such as an angry driver who 
did not like the way a car cut in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
But Teeters said he had done nothing to trigger someone's anger: He had not 
passed a car or cut anyone off with his 1984 Dodge pickup truck, and nothing 
had happened earlier to provoke violence. 
</P>
<P>
"I was at a nightclub in Anaheim, and a friend had had too much to drink, so I 
gave him a ride to his home off Atlantic (Avenue) in Long Beach," said Teeters, 
a bachelor. "I left him off, and I was then going to drive back to the 
nightclub to see my girl there. I guess it was about 10:30 or 10:40 at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I had just gotten back on the 91 Freeway, and I was driving eastbound in the 
center lane. Then this car pulled up alongside me and opened up. I heard 
gunfire and glass breaking on the passenger side of my truck. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I saw it was a white car, when the glass flew in. A small white 
car. There had to be two people in it shooting, because I have two different 
kinds of slugs in my body." 
</P>
<P>
Teeters said he did not see who was shooting at him. Then the car backed off 
and exited at a nearby ramp. Teeters said he had no more than a glimpse at the 
"small white car," so he does not know its make or model. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept on driving, because I didn't want to stop, obviously," he said. "But I 
was saturated in blood, so I figured I'd better pull over before I passed out." 
</P>
<P>
Teeters exited the freeway at the Cherry Avenue off-ramp in Long Beach and 
found a telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"I called my friend first, because I wasn't sure if I was going to die," he 
said. "I was bleeding a lot. I had to put pressure against my jaw to try to 
stop the bleeding." 
</P>
<P>
The friend he called was Carl Hensgen of Cypress, who was at the hospital 
Friday visiting Teeters. 
</P>
<P>
"I was home asleep when I got his call about 11 o'clock," Hensgen said. "Jeff 
sounded hysterical. He said, 'I need help! Come get me!' I told him to hang up 
immediately and call 911." 
</P>
<P>
Teeters said he followed Hensgen's advice. "Police came within three minutes 
after I dialed 911, and the Fire Department people were right behind them," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency teams rushed Teeters to the nearby hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"One shot is lodged here in my neck," said Teeters, pointing to the wound. "It 
went in the jaw, fractured the jaw, and then it went up the jawbone and into 
the neck. It was a hollow-point (.38-caliber bullet), and so it shattered. 
Basically, it traveled around before it lodged in my neck, but it missed both 
the artery and the spine." 
</P>
<P>
Teeters pointed to his other wounds. "There's another .38 slug in my chest 
cavity, and this side of my chest here is peppered with shotgun pellets." 
</P>
<P>
A doctor "told me my brother was very lucky," said Jim Teeters, 32, of Long 
Beach, who was with the victim in his hospital room. "The doctor said that 
bullet came very close to hitting a major artery, and if it had, Jeff would 
have been dead in a matter of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctor told me they decided not to remove the slugs because it would 
involve too much surgery for Jeff. Both the .38 slugs are embedded in muscle. 
They may work their way out. They may not. Those slugs may be there the rest of 
his life." 
</P>
<P>
Teeters smiled and said, "So now I'm going to go off every time I go to the 
airport," referring to the metal detectors at security checks. 
</P>
<P>
Although Teeters joked about his ordeal in playful banter with his brother and 
Hensgen, he made it clear that he had been in fear for his life and also said 
he cannot understand why anyone would randomly shoot a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
"Four or five shots were fired at me," he said. "We know that because police 
found a round lodged in the front fender hood and one or two slugs in the cab, 
in addition to the slugs in me. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess these things happen. I've read about them. I just never thought it 
would happen to me."

LEGAL SQUAWK IS BORN OVER BABY IN OFFICE 
</P>

<P>
Lawyer Diane J. Marlowe has spent 11 years fighting for women's rights, but now 
Marlowe is facing her own possible legal action as she battles for the right to 
care for her 1-month-old daughter at her workplace. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Marlowe set up a crib in her office at the Women's Law Center 
and began bringing Jennifer to work. However, the landlord, represented by 
Tishman West Management Corp., said other tenants have complained that 
Jennifer's presence compromises the professional atmosphere of the executive 
suites, the top two floors of a 10-story office building near The City Shopping 
Center, which are rented mostly to attorneys and accountants. 
</P>
<P>
Marlowe was notified in a hand-delivered letter Thursday that using her office 
as a "nursery" violates the lease. 
</P>
<P>
To Marlowe, the office is not a nursery, it's a law office that has added a 
crib. 
</P>
<P>
Marlowe said that she keeps the door to her office tightly shut and that no one 
has complained directly to her about having children at the office. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, several women from nearby offices have commented positively, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't walk around holding a baby" in the hallways, Marlowe said. "It's not 
something I make a big production out of." 
</P>
<P>
Marlowe and her husband, lawyer Richard C. Gilbert, have their practice in a 
three-room corner suite on a floor lined with dozens of offices. They have just 
rented an adjoining room to create a work space for their paralegal and the 
baby. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Mull, Tishman West building manager, said there have been no complaints of 
noise or other disturbance but that "several offices have felt an impact or 
concern" over the unprofessional appearance created by having an infant at the 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Marlowe's lease agreement includes a section called "Professional Conduct," 
which states that if "more than 50% of the co-tenants feel that (the conduct in 
question) reflects unfavorably on them or the suite," the landlord may 
terminate the lease. 
</P>
<P>
"Tishman West is not trying to take an anti-child or anti-infant or anti-day 
care stand," Mull said. "But we have had complaints." 
</P>
<P>
He added that Tishman West will be creating a day-care center for employees at 
The City but that it will most likely be at a different site. 
</P>
<P>
Marlowe and Mull met late Friday but were unable to settle the conflict. Mull 
said the issue will be considered by Tishman West's legal department. 
</P>
<P>
Friday afternoon, Jennifer napped in her blue portable crib while the phone 
rang and her mother talked about the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Marlowe, 38, one the founders of the Women's Law Center, worked at home when 
her first child was born six years ago. She ran an office, complete with 
secretary, out of her Mission Viejo home for three years. 
</P>
<P>
But now her practice, which consists mostly of family-law cases, is so large 
that she cannot work at home, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Marlowe said she believes that having Jennifer at the office is her only 
option. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be with her, and it's not acceptable to me for her to be in the care 
of someone else," Marlowe said. 
</P>
<P>
Cases of employers who will not supply a child-care facility for their workers 
are common, Marlowe said.

FOR GUN FANCIERS, IT WAS THAT PERFECT FEEL;

FIREARMS: CROWDS GATHER TO LOOK AT AND HEFT WEAPONS AT AN NRA CONVENTION 
CLOUDED BY SEVERAL LEGISLATIVE REVERSES.

"I definitely like the feel of that," Duane Rowland muttered to himself as he 
stared down the scope of an imposing .44 magnum pistol that would have made 
Dirty Harry proud. 
</P>
<P>
Carefully, the Huntington Beach charter bus driver squeezed the trigger, 
lurching backwards ever so slightly as he imagined a direct hit on an imaginary 
spot on the wall at the Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my gun," Rowland, an occasional big-game hunter, said as he rested the 
big firearm with its 9 1/2-inch barrel gently on the table. "It's perfect." 
</P>
<P>
For Rowland and several thousand other people at the opening of the National 
Rifle Assn.'s three-day gun exhibit, it was a day to dabble in perfection -- to 
get a glimpse of some of the best firearms made, and to do it among people who 
appreciate "a good gun." 
</P>
<P>
At a time of rising public concern over crime issues, gun enthusiasts have been 
thrown on the defensive by increasingly successful efforts to limit access to 
some firearms. In the eyes of their critics and the media, complained Jack 
Greenlees, a retired Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, "we're zealots and 
fanatics and crazies." 
</P>
<P>
But none of that seemed to matter Friday as Southern Californians and others 
from around the country, in Anaheim for the NRA's annual convention, viewed the 
latest in pistols, rifles, crossbows and firearms paraphernalia from some 200 
exhibitors in one of the biggest shows of its kind in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors combed the exhibition hall in search of that elusive 19th-Century 
pistol or ogled other antique weaponry, such as a glistening replica of a 
George Washington battle sword. Cops came to see what they might be facing on 
the streets because, as retired San Diego County Sheriff's Deputy John Cooper 
asserted, "The crooks don't care about the bans; they've got the guns." 
</P>
<P>
Mothers brought small children to the exhibit, keeping them busy with books on 
display on children's gun safety and with a nearby shooting range -- five shots 
for 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
In the evening, an expected 1,500 NRA members and supporters attended a rally 
to begin a campaign aimed at raising more than $1 million and making the NRA's 
presence felt more powerfully in California's voting booths in November. 
</P>
<P>
State NRA leaders plan to target still-unspecified legislators who have taken 
anti-gun positions on key issues -- specifically the passage of two unique 
pieces of legislation that made some types of semiautomatic assault rifles 
illegal in California and put into place a 15-day waiting period for the 
purchase of all firearms. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Wayne R. La Pierre Jr., executive director of the NRA's 
lobbying arm, said that the NRA was even displeased with some of its past 
supporters, including Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), a candidate for governor who 
voted last month in favor of a semiautomatic weapons ban that passed the 
Senate. The bill has now been stalled by opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The effects of California's newly enacted gun restriction could be seen at the 
exhibition -- a scarcity of some types of semiautomatic weapons. Some 
out-of-state gun dealers said they were uncertain about the timetable for 
enactment of California's new law and about which semiautomatics would pass 
muster under it, so they just left them all at home. 
</P>
<P>
But there were plenty of other guns to go around -- Remingtons, Rugers, Smith 
&amp; Wessons, Colts and the latest in many other big-name models. 
</P>
<P>
For Greenlees, the retired L.A. sheriff's deputy, it was an $800 Century Model 
100, a 6 1/2-inch revolver first discharged in the late 1800s, that caught his 
eye. The large pistol, he explained, seems custom-made for an oversized Civil 
War-era holster that he owns. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked down (at the display case) and realized that was the one I'd been 
looking for," he said. "I have to have it. . . . I'll just keep it for my 
collection. There's not much else you could do with it -- except shoot 
elephants, maybe." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A PROFILE OF THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSN. 
</P>
<P>
Founded: In 1871 by former Union Army officers, with its main focus on 
marksmanship, hunting and safety. Current mission is "to protect and defend the 
Constitution of the United States, especially with reference to the inalienable 
right of individual, law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms." 
</P>
<P>
Membership: 2.8 million members in 1989. Annual dues are $25. 
</P>
<P>
Budget: $87.5 million in 1989. Included $19.7 million for federal and local 
lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
Among noted members past and present: Presidents George Bush, Ronald Reagan, 
Richard M. Nixon, John F. Kennedy, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Theodore Roosevelt; 
actor Charlton Heston; entertainer Roy Rogers; rock singer-guitarist Ted 
Nugent; Joe Foss, former World War II Congressional Medal of Honor winner, 
first commissioner of the American Football League and outgoing NRA president; 
and Jerry Mathers, television's "Beaver" from "Leave it to . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Why people bear arms: About 51% of the nation's 65 million gun owners say 
hunting is their main reason for having or using a firearm, according to a 1978 
survey. Another 32% listed "protection," 13% target shooting, and 4% 
collecting.

YOUTH: COUNTY'S BEST AND BRIGHTEST HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS STUDY HARD, BUT INSIST 
THEY'RE 'DEFINITELY NOT NERDS.' AFTER HANGING OUT FOR THE SUMMER, THEY'LL HEAD 
FOR TOP UNIVERSITIES. 
</P>

<P>
Christina Hong, a senior at Mission Viejo High School, has a secret -- not only 
is she the smartest student at her school, she's also the top graduate in 
Orange County. Try not to spread it around. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to be known as the smartest person in school," said Hong, 18, who 
amassed a county-high 4.94 grade-point average and will enroll at Stanford 
University this fall. "I don't like that label." 
</P>
<P>
Like many of her fellow valedictorians around the county, Hong acknowledges 
that she's excited about education and dedicated to her schoolwork. But while 
they work hard in the classroom, the county's top graduates also work hard to 
dispel the notion that they are anything other than just ordinary teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, they study a lot, and they enjoy it -- Hong confessed to "having a good 
time" in her calculus class. But they also go the beach, and to the movies, and 
to the mall. They are athletes, cheerleaders, musicians and members of school 
clubs. No pocket protectors, horn-rimmed glasses or pants that end at the top 
of the ankles among this group. 
</P>
<P>
"We are definitely not nerds," said Michelle Sippl, 17, who, with a 4.17 
grade-point average, is one of the top three students at San Clemente High 
School. "We are not so much smart as motivated and ambitious. I know a lot of 
people who are extremely intelligent but just sit around in class all day and 
don't try." 
</P>
<P>
But this year's crop of valedictorians from the county's 56 public high schools 
not only tried, they succeeded -- and their choices of universities point to 
their academic success. Of the 161 top graduates in the county, 69 will enter 
the University of California system, including 22 who will be headed to UC 
Berkeley -- 10 more Orange County valedictorians than last year -- and 21 who 
will enroll at UCLA. Closer to home, 15 valedictorians and salutatorians will 
study at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Bailey, director of admissions and records at UC Berkeley, attributed 
the sharp rise in the number of the county's top students enrolling there to a 
"spruced up" recruiting drive in the area and an "enhanced" system of personal 
interviews and campus visits. "We're creaming off the valedictorians in 
Southern California," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ruba Qashu, 17, the top student at Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton with a 
4.77 grade-point average, said she opted to study biology at UC Berkeley 
because she "liked the atmosphere" of the school. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a great variety of people," said Qashu, who plans to go on to medical 
school. "It will be exciting to be there." She added that her parents "wanted 
me to stay close and go to UCLA or UC Irvine, (but) I need to break away." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the nation's most prestigious schools are also represented in the 
students' selections. Nineteen of the 161 top students plan to attend Stanford 
University, and nearly all of the Ivy League schools will take at least one of 
the best of Orange County -- including eight students who will travel to 
Cambridge, Mass., to attend Harvard and six who will enroll at Harvard's 
archrival, Yale. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter how far any of those students travel to attend college, Sippl has 
got them all beat. This fall, she'll say bon voyage to San Clemente and set off 
for the American University of Paris, where she plans to study international 
relations. Her goal is to become a diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
Sippl said her family completely supports her plans -- almost. While her 
relatives are all chipping in to foot the bill for the $22,000 yearly cost of 
tuition and expenses, and while her mother, who lived in Paris for a year as an 
English tutor "is ecstatic," some members of the family are not too thrilled 
about sending her off to a city with a reputation for l'amour. 
</P>
<P>
"My grandparents are afraid that I'm going to get married to a Frenchman," 
Sippl said. 
</P>
<P>
Sippl added that she's got a few fears of her own, although they have nothing 
to do with amorous Parisians. The prospect of moving to Europe "has me a little 
nervous," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Just going to college is a scary thing," Sippl said. "But I was raised to have 
an open mind. I'm ready to take on the world." 
</P>
<P>
Contradicting feelings of uneasiness and excitement were prevalent among other 
valedictorians. The uneasiness was generated by the thought of going off alone 
into new and unfamiliar settings, separated from friends and family, but the 
excitement of new challenges was just as clear. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take some time to adjust at Stanford," Hong said. "I've had a 
home where I've had a great family, and I've got a lot of friends I'm really 
close to. That's going to take some adjusting, not having those close friends 
there. But the experience will teach me a lot about independence and how to 
take care of myself." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas McDevitt, 17, whose 4.61 grade-point average earned him a place among 
the five valedictorians at Sunny Hills High School, said that after four years 
of being among a close circle of friends, going to college will "definitely be 
the loss of a security blanket." 
</P>
<P>
"It's scary because colleges are pretty much people in the top of the class," 
said McDevitt, who will enter Princeton University this fall on an Army ROTC 
scholarship. "The competition will be a lot stiffer." 
</P>
<P>
McDevitt, Qashu and their fellow Sunny Hills valedictorians -- Elisa Altman, 
Albert Liu, 17, and Atul Saran,, 16 -- described themselves as a tightknit 
group that spends a lot of time with each other and together suffer indignities 
like the senior-year "biology class from hell." That togetherness, they said, 
helped get them through high school and better prepared them for what lies 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"It made it easier knowing all of our friends were kind of doing the same 
thing," said Altman, 17, who achieved a 4.70 at Sunny Hills and will study 
sociology and music at Yale this fall. 
</P>
<P>
All five said they would stress the need for unity among students in their 
valedictory speeches at commencement ceremonies next week.

JAILS COMPLAINT IS AMENDED BY ACLU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Civil rights advocates seeking a federal judge's ruling to improve living 
conditions in Orange County jails have amended some of the complaints in their 
longstanding battle with the county. 
</P>
<P>
The amended complaint, filed Thursday in federal court in Santa Ana on behalf 
of the inmates, expands on alleged psychological abuses at both the men's and 
women's main jails and the intake and release center that were detailed in a 
complaint filed last April. 
</P>
<P>
April's complaint marked the first time that lawyers with the American Civil 
Liberties Union included the women's facility in its lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU, which has been fighting for improved jail conditions in the county 
since 1975, also charges in the amended suit that the Sheriff's Department, 
which operates the jails, failed to provide "a decent, clean jail, a safe 
jail." 
</P>
<P>
The complaint alleges that prisoners are placed in overcrowded cells, are 
physically and mentally mistreated and denied access to reading material. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Assistant Sheriff Rocky Hewitt declined to comment on the lawsuit 
but said in a release that the "jail complex is one of the cleanest, best-run 
facilities of its type in the country." He invited "the courts, the grand jury, 
any justice commission, Orange County and state health care agencies and the 
Board of Corrections . . . to visit and inspect the jails anytime, 
unannounced." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy County Counsel Stefen Weiss, who represents the county against the ACLU 
lawsuit, could not be reached for comment. MATT LAIT

Development has spilled across Orange County and altered the landscape since 
Fred Lang started tending to it half a century ago. But Lang has made some 
lasting marks of his own too. 
</P>
<P>
A landscape architect who helped design the grounds at UC Irvine, Lang 
estimates that he has been responsible for the planting of hundreds of trees 
between San Diego and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
In Laguna Beach, where the German immigrant put down his own roots, he is known 
as the local authority on trees. "Whenever there's a tree problem, somebody 
says, 'Call Fred Lang,' " City Clerk Verna Rollinger remarked. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the 75-year-old Lang said he was surprised at the turnout Tuesday night 
when the Laguna Beach City Council voted unanimously to name a park after him, 
where he had planted coral, pine and eucalyptus trees 41 years ago. Among those 
who rose to speak on his behalf were representatives from Laguna Greenbelt, 
Laguna Canyon Conservancy, the city's Beautification Council and the Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"It was quite amazing to me," Lang said of the decision to transform what was 
once an elementary school site at Wesley Drive and Coast Highway into Frederick 
M. Lang Park. "I have done a lot of things, but I didn't realize people knew 
about them." 
</P>
<P>
It would be hard not to notice some of Lang's contributions. In addition to his 
work at UC Irvine, Lang said he has drawn the ground plans for at least a dozen 
other Orange County schools. 
</P>
<P>
Friends say that Lang, who has helped to preserve open space locally as a 
founding member of the Laguna Greenbelt, has gained a national reputation for 
his handiwork. His gardens have been featured in Sunset Magazine and he has 
been on the editorial committee of that publication for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
In Laguna, where he has sketched gardens for seaside estates and hotels, Lang 
has been praised for helping to design and establish Main Beach Park in the 
1960s. Recently, he redesigned the grounds at the Irvine Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Paving the way for a tree-protection ordinance in the 1970s, Lang went tree to 
tree, noting which were of "interesting form and great age." 
</P>
<P>
Lang said his interest in gardening was born when, as a child, he began 
following around an "interesting old gardener" at his home in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
After immigrating to Chicago in 1934, where he studied at the Chicago Art 
Institute, Lang moved on to California in 1937. His interest in plants 
blossomed at the Huntington Library in San Marino, where he was conducting 
research. At his new home in Laguna Beach, Lang, then 22, continued to absorb 
information about the plants around him and began taking planting and 
landscaping jobs. Lang and his wife, Bonnie, now live in South Laguna, where he 
says their "ecological wilderness" back yard reflects his continuing love for a 
natural landscape.LESLIE EARNEST

IT TOOK TLC TO SAVE NEIGHBORHOOD TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents who live along Cabrillo Park Drive learned this week that it is 
possible to fight City Hall -- and win. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 132 liquidambar trees that line both sides of their street were 
once only weeks away from being removed because their massive roots were 
causing extensive damage to sidewalks. But the trees have been saved as a 
result of the protest staged by hundreds of residents who claimed that removing 
the liquidambars would destroy their neighborhood and lower property values. 
</P>
<P>
Residents started a petition drive, spoke out at City Council meetings and 
formed the 400-member Trees Living on Cabrillo Park (TLC) Alliance, and the 
effort convinced city officials to change their minds about the trees. 
</P>
<P>
"This has really given us some faith in the system," said Paula Cobb, who led 
the movement to save the trees. "It's been a heartwarming experience that has 
really pulled this neighborhood together. There's a community spirit now that 
has never existed before in the 10 years that I've lived here." 
</P>
<P>
This week, city officials sat down with leaders of TLC Alliance and came up 
with a plan they believe will solve the sidewalk problem and save most of the 
liquidambars. They plan to install a meandering sidewalk around many of the 
trees and do some "root shaving" on other trees that they say may reduce the 
diameter of some of the roots by as much as 50%, said Larry Christian, city 
maintenance manager. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like we will be able to save at least 77 trees if we do some 
modifications and we're going to do our darndest to save the remaining ones as 
well," Christian said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the meandering sidewalk can be installed, at least two-thirds of the 
residents must approve a ballot measure saying that they are willing to give up 
a five-foot easement lining the edges of the several condominium and townhouse 
complexes on Cabrillo Park Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that when all the facts are presented to the homeowners, we won't 
have a problem getting their approval," Cobb said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Miguel A. Pulido Jr. and John Acosta, who both approved the removal 
project on May 7, pledged support to the residents during a TLC Alliance 
meeting last Saturday. Pulido said this week that most of the council wasn't 
aware of the impact that removing the trees would have. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid such incidents in the future, Pulido has requested that the council 
hold a study session to examine the possibility of forming a seven-member tree 
advisory board that would review all tree-removal projects. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton resident Alden Kelley, a consulting arborist, said he has been 
watching the Cabrillo Park Drive situation with interest and has examined many 
of the liquidambars once slated for removal. He said the trees are in excellent 
condition and are worth about $5,000 each. GREG HERNANDEZ

LANDMARK RUBY'S CAFE TO VANISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON SANDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ruby's Cafe, a landmark on old Highway 101, will be demolished today, along 
with Mitchell's Market. 
</P>
<P>
The two buildings on El Camino Real were constructed in the 1920s when Tustin 
was just a few shops and houses surrounded by farms. 
</P>
<P>
"Ruby's was the only real good eating place between Los Angeles and San Diego, 
and of course that was the place to stop if you were headed south," said John 
Sours, who has lived in Tustin for nearly all his 74 years. 
</P>
<P>
Ruby's served as a truck stop, a meeting place for locals, and a haven on cold 
nights for farmers setting up smudge pots in orange groves. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to see any of it go, but it's like the rest of us. We can't stay here 
forever," Sours said. 
</P>
<P>
Ruby's and Mitchell's have been closed for years and have fallen into 
disrepair. The city condemned Mitchell's five years ago and notified the owners 
of Ruby's of numerous code violations in August, 1989, during a 
code-enforcement review along El Camino Real. Both Ruby's and Mitchell's are 
owned by the Prescott family. 
</P>
<P>
"The city wants the buildings to come up to present code, which means almost 
completely rebuilding them," said Doug Prescott, the brother of Councilman Earl 
J. Prescott. That is not financially feasible, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Prescott said he is not certain what will be done with the two sites, although 
several plans are being considered. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, the Prescotts were in negotiations with the Ruby Restaurant Group, 
which operates six 1950s-style Ruby's diners in Orange County. Prescott and 
Doug Cavanaugh, co-owner of the Ruby's chain, said that reopening a restaurant 
there was impractical because of city requirements for seating and parking. 
</P>
<P>
"We liked the location and the history of the place, but it just didn't pencil 
out," said Cavanaugh, who used to go to Ruby's Cafe as a child. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Shingleton, director of Tustin's Community Development Department, 
said the city has done everything possible to accommodate the Prescotts and 
Cavanaugh. "We were told that the costs were too high," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Ruby's and Mitchell's have structural problems, substandard electrical 
systems and other dangerous code violations, Shingleton said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city condemned Mitchell's in 1985, the Prescotts had the option of 
bringing Ruby's up to code or demolishing it, Shingleton said. SHANNON SANDS

MAN KILLS WIFE'S STEPBROTHER DURING BREAK-IN;

SLAYING: THE VICTIM WAS THE CAUSE OF A SERIES OF FAMILY SQUABBLES, CAUSING 
OFFICERS TO COME TO THE HOME A NUMBER OF TIMES, NEIGHBORS SAID.

<P>
A homeowner shot and killed his wife's stepbrother early Friday morning while 
the man was reportedly attempting to break into the family's home, ending a 
long string of violent outbursts that disrupted the neighborhood, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although sheriff's investigators declined to name the shooting victim, he was 
identified by neighbors and court records as Alfred J. LeBrun, 25, who had 
acquired a reputation as a violent and unpredictable man who repeatedly 
attacked and threatened various family members for years. 
</P>
<P>
LeBrun was killed almost instantly by a single shotgun blast to the chest, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
The shotgun was fired at point-blank range by Jeffrey S. Alix, 33, the husband 
of LeBrun's stepsister, according to investigators. He told deputies that he 
accidentally shot his stepbrother after he was awakened in the middle of the 
night by what sounded like a prowler, Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. 
Richard J. Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel numb," Alix said as stood in the living room of his one-story, 
single-family home at the end of a cul de sac near the Laguna Hills Golf 
Course. "I can't believe it happened." 
</P>
<P>
Alix, an employee of Hughes Corp. in Newport Beach, and his wife, Lynn, 32, 
declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Alix was not charged in the shooting, Olson said. Once all evidence is gathered 
and all interviews are completed, sheriff's homicide detectives will turn the 
case over to the Orange County district attorney's office for review, probably 
by next week. 
</P>
<P>
LeBrun was under an April 17, 1989, court order to stay away from the couple, 
their two young children and Lynn Alix's father, Charles Audette. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Alix had obtained the court order after she ended a separation from her 
husband in March, 1989, Olson said. While separated, she lived with LeBrun, 
court records show. 
</P>
<P>
In filing for the restraining order, Lynn Alix said that her stepbrother 
repeatedly beat her and her father, Audette, who is LeBrun's stepfather. At 
least twice last year, LeBrun "punched and strangled" both Lynn Alix and 
Audette, cutting and bruising them, according to the court order. 
</P>
<P>
The 1:58 a.m. shooting occurred when Alix, who had just gone to bed shortly 
after returning home from work, heard the front door rattling, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
"(Alix) goes out in the front room, and at that point, he hears a gate at the 
side of the house swing open," Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Alix grabbed his 12-gauge shotgun and walked out of the house. Approaching the 
darkened back yard, Alix spotted the silhouette of a man who he thought was 
trying to break through the glass door to the kitchen, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Alix shouted, and when the intruder turned and lunged at him, Alix fired once, 
Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Alix, hearing the blast, came running outside, Alix told investigators. 
After she flipped on the kitchen light, the couple discovered that the shooting 
victim was her stepbrother. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was the latest in a number of attempts by LeBrun to contact his 
stepsister since she obtained the court order, which was due to lapse in April, 
1992, court records show. LeBrun ignored the order to stay at least 150 yards 
from the Alix house on at least six occasions, according to court records. He 
was also ordered to stay away from the home of his stepfather and the 
elementary school where the Alix children were enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
On July 23, 1989, LeBrun was arrested by sheriff's deputies after Lynn Alix 
filed for a citizen's arrest, court records show. She called deputies after he 
went to the house and became violent, according to records. 
</P>
<P>
Other records in Municipal Court show a complaint charging LeBrun with assault 
and battery and ignoring the court order. The complaint covered dates between 
March, 27, 1989, and July, 24, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
A $10,000 bench warrant was issued after LeBrun failed to show up for a court 
appearance in Laguna Niguel, a court clerk said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's investigators were trying to piece together how the long-lasting feud 
between the relatives began or why it continued, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Most residents of picturesque Torino Street were reluctant to speak publicly 
but confirmed privately that LeBrun continued to visit the Alix home since the 
court order was issued. They said that for years, LeBrun had disrupted their 
lives with outbursts that sometimes drew deputies to the Alix home. 
</P>
<P>
For hours after the shooting, curious residents stood on their immaculate lawns 
watching homicide detectives collect evidence in the back yard. While 
investigators worked, eight squad cars and a fire truck remained parked along 
the narrow residential street. 
</P>
<P>
LeBrun had recently been seen around the house by neighbors, performing chores 
such as mowing the lawn. He seemed peaceful at the time, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
One neighbor said that police had been to the Alix residence several times in 
recent years to arrest LeBrun. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of strange things going on at that place," said the neighbor, 
who declined to give his name.

Flener, a junior left-hander who was a ninth-round pick, will leave for 
Dunedin, Fla., Sunday to participate in a one-week mini-camp before reporting 
to St. Catharines of the New York-Penn League on June 16. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, a junior right-hander who was a 14th-round pick of the Blue Jays, 
signed Wednesday. He also will report to St. Catharines. 
</P>
<P>
"It's super that Matt and I will be playing together," said Flener, a graduate 
of Armijo High School in Fairfield, Calif. "He's one of my closest friends on 
the team. There will still be tons of people to meet, but it's somewhat 
comforting knowing I have a friend there, in another country." 
</P>
<P>
Flener, one of the Titans' top three starters this season, went 8-1 with a 3.80 
earned-run average. He struck out 89 and walked 49 in 128 innings. He was the 
winning pitcher in Fullerton's 6-3 victory over Creighton in the NCAA Central 
Regionals. 
</P>
<P>
When Toronto made its first contract offer Wednesday, Flener said he was 
wavering between turning professional and returning to Fullerton for his senior 
season. But the team came back Friday with a bonus that was about double the 
original offer, Flener said, making his decision easier. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to go into detail, but they came back with something 
substantially higher than the first offer," Flener said. "The first offer 
wasn't close to what I thought it would be, but I'm happy with this." 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton Coach Larry Cochell lost another player when Donnie Harrel, 
a power-hitting catcher/infielder from Taft College who had signed a letter of 
intent with the Titans, signed with the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans are also in danger of losing John Ingram, a left-handed pitcher from 
Harbor College who was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the fourth 
round. 
</P>
<P>
"We've talked, but he hasn't made his decision," Cochell said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jason Hutchins, a right-handed pitcher from Golden West College who 
was drafted by the Royals, has informed Cochell that he will attend Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Cochell lost four outstanding players, Jason Friedman (Cypress 
College), Mark Loeb (San Bernardino Valley College), Craig Paquette (Golden 
West) and Mark Charbonnet (Gahr High School), to the professional draft before 
they played for the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
Cochell is still awaiting word from junior second baseman Mate Borgogno and 
junior shortstop Kevin Farlow, who were drafted by the San Francisco Giants and 
San Diego Padres, respectively. Both are expected to make their decisions by 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Junior center fielder Domingo Mota was picked by the Dodgers in the 29th round 
but is expected to return to Fullerton. Junior designated hitter/catcher Frank 
Charles, who as of Friday hadn't heard from a professional team, said he will 
return to Fullerton for his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
Cochell said junior catcher Matt Hattabaugh had not been contacted about the 
draft by Friday, but Cochell isn't sure if Hattabaugh will attempt to sign with 
a team as a free agent or return to Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Three more community college players were drafted. 
</P>
<P>
Infielder Doug McConathy of Cypress was taken by Baltimore, pitcher Jay Hassell 
of Rancho Santiago was taken by the Angels and outfielder Steve Grack was 
picked by San Diego. Rounds they were chosen in were not disclosed.

PADRES: TWENTY YEARS LATER, CLAY KIRBY STILL WONDERS WHY HE WAS PULLED FOR 
PINCH-HITTER IN THE EIGHTH WHEN HE WAS WORKING ON NO-HITTER.

<P>
Twenty years later, Clay Kirby still can't understand why it happened to him. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching for the Padres against the New York Mets on July 21, 1970 at San Diego 
Stadium, Kirby had a no-hitter going for eight innings, only to be taken out 
for a pinch-hitter. The Padres were behind at the time, 1-0, but that didn't 
lessen the shock. 
</P>
<P>
With the Padres mired in last place in the second season of their existence, 
and headed for a 63-99 record, Kirby figured Manager Preston Gomez would let 
him bat. Why not? 
</P>
<P>
There were two men out with nobody on base and the Mets' Jim McAndrew had 
retired 15 batters in a row en route to what would be a three-hit, 3-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
When pinch-hitter Cito Gaston, now manager of the Toronto Blue Jays, went to 
the plate, the crowd of 10,373 let out a thunderous chorus of boos. One fan got 
so riled up that he vaulted the box-seat railing and tried to make a run at 
Gomez, only to have Kirby and other Padres intercept him. 
</P>
<P>
The booing continued as Gaston struck out, got louder when Jack Baldschun 
replaced Kirby on the mound and reached its peak when Baldschun gave up three 
hits and two runs in the ninth. If the fans had reacted like some European 
soccer crowds, there might have been a riot. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, the switchboards at the Padres' offices and area newspapers were 
inundated by calls from fans howling for Gomez's scalp. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, Kirby, who was called "The Kid" because he looked even younger 
than his 22 years, managed to keep his composure. In the aftermath, he said 
simply: "I was a little surprised when he took me out." 
</P>
<P>
Now, though, with his baseball career behind him, Kirby wonders why he was 
deprived of such an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that I'm bitter," he said by telephone from his home in Fairfax, Va. 
"But with no chance to do it again, I'd like to look back and say a baseball I 
pitched is in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"When I try to look at the logic behind it, I don't see it. We were 20 or 30 
games behind and we needed something to drum up interest in the ballclub. A 
no-hitter would have given the franchise a much bigger boost than one more 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"If it had been the seventh game of the World Series, I could understand it, I 
guess. But we were in last place." 
</P>
<P>
Kirby, who will be 42 June 25, did have himself to blame for being behind. The 
Mets got a first-inning run when Tommie Agee and Ken Singleton walked, worked a 
double steal, and Agee scored on Art Shamsky's infield out. 
</P>
<P>
Still, this remains a controversial baseball game in San Diego because, to this 
day, no Padre pitcher has thrown a no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did Clay Kirby, who pitched five years in San Diego before finishing his 
career in Cincinnati and Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with a 95-mph fastball, Kirby was the type of pitcher of whom baseball 
men would say, "He's liable to pitch a no-hitter some day." In high school in 
Arlington, Va., he pitched a perfect game and struck out 19 batters. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured I had plenty of time to pitch a no-hitter," he said. "As it was, I 
came close a couple of times later on." 
</P>
<P>
Kirby's two other near-misses occurred in successive starts in 1971 when he won 
a career-high 15 games -- against 13 defeats -- for a team with a record of 
61-100. He was 10-16 in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 13 in Houston, he held the Astros without a hit until John Edwards 
doubled with one out in the eighth inning. Five days later in San Francisco, he 
had a perfect game until Willie McCovey of the Giants led off the eighth with a 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the frustration that stemmed from those two near-misses couldn't match 
that caused by Gomez's decision to pinch-hit for him. 
</P>
<P>
"Against the Mets, I figured I had a no-hitter in the bag," he said. "I had 
just struck out Cleon Jones in the eighth on three pitches -- fast, faster and 
fastest, and see you later. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came in after that inning, I got a drink of water, and I saw Roger 
Craig (then the Padre pitching coach, now manager of the Giants) coming in with 
a long look on his face. He was really upset, because he obviously wanted me to 
proceed. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew then that something was up. When I put my helmet on, Gomez called me 
back. He basically said, 'Get your butt back here.' I said, 'What?' and that 
was it. Gaston felt bad. He didn't want to go up and hit for me." 
</P>
<P>
As disappointed as he was though, Kirby declined to blast Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
"When the reporters came in, they wanted me to say something about Preston," 
Kirby said. "I couldn't do that. I respect him as a man and as a manager." 
</P>
<P>
Understandably, Kirby's relatives and friends were less charitable toward 
Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all mad," Kirby told The Times the day after the game. "My dad was 
real mad about it, too. He kept saying you come close like that only so many 
times." 
</P>
<P>
That day Kirby went fishing with his father, Clayton Laws Kirby Sr., who died 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the fans wouldn't let the subject drop. When Kirby made his next home 
start, they gave him one standing ovation after another. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very nice for me," Kirby said. "I don't think Gomez got booed because I 
don't remember him coming onto the field, but I don't think he appreciated that 
night. Funny, I pitched an 11-hitter and won." 
</P>
<P>
By that time, Kirby found himself bombarded by mail from sympathetic fans. 
</P>
<P>
"I got boxes and boxes and boxes of letters," Kirby said. "I guess the thing 
made headlines all over the country." 
</P>
<P>
As far as Kirby is concerned, the tremendous support he received from the 
public gave him much more satisfaction than any vitriolic words he might have 
aimed at Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
"I was probably in a position to bury the manager if I'd wanted to pop off," 
Kirby said. "I think we needed motivation in the form of attendance, but that's 
as far as I went." 
</P>
<P>
As for Gomez, this wasn't the first time he had pulled a pitcher for a 
pinch-hitter in the eighth inning with a no-hitter going . . . nor was it the 
last. He did it with Phil Ortega in 1964 while managing Spokane in the Dodger 
farm system and he did it with the late Don Wilson in 1974 while managing the 
Houston Astros. Wilson had already pitched two no-hitters for the Astros, in 
1967 and 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, now assistant to General Manager Mike Port of the Angels, takes the same 
stance on his decision of 20 years ago that he did then. 
</P>
<P>
"I always felt that when you're playing this game, you play to win," Gomez 
said. "Sure, you want to see somebody get a no-hitter, but in this particular 
game, we were behind 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew after the seventh inning that Kirby was scheduled to bat third in the 
eighth. (Ed) Spiezio and (Bob) Barton were ahead of him. If Spiezio hits a home 
run or if one of them gets on and I can bunt with Kirby, then he stays in. But 
my mind was made up to hit for him if neither one of them got on. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if we were 160 games behind. I'd do the same thing. The 
commissioner (Bowie Kuhn) called me and so did several other managers, and they 
all said it was the only way to play the game." 
</P>
<P>
Gaston, the man who was reluctantly cast in the unpopular role of the 
pinch-hitter for Kirby, had just come off the disabled list after recovering 
from a back ailment. He was the Padres' leading hitter that year with a 
career-high .318 average. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have done the same thing," Gaston said. "Who's to say Kirby would have 
pitched a no-hitter? In a situation like that, they'll second-guess you no 
matter how you do it." 
</P>
<P>
Although Kirby recalled Craig being upset, Craig said he agreed with Gomez's 
decision to remove Kirby from the game. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to do what you can to win a game, and that's what Preston did," Craig 
said. "Some managers would leave him in, figuring a no-hitter would be a 
confidence builder. Then again, he might have come out in the next inning and 
given up a hit anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll say this for Preston. He could probably run a game as well as any manager 
I ever saw." 
</P>
<P>
Buzzie Bavasi was the Padre general manager when Gomez yanked Kirby. He gave 
Kirby a $250 bonus, half of what he had given Bill Singer for pitching a 
no-hitter a year earlier when he ran the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the outrage expressed by the public, Bavasi said, "I just wish the 
people who phoned us and sent us wires would show up at the ballpark. We'd have 
50,000 out there." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Garcia, then the Padres' first-base coach and now a scout for the 
Milwaukee Brewers, noted that Kirby had only himself to blame for being a run 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
"He was mad, but I told him it was his fault," Garcia said. "I told him a 
manager does what he has to do. The Mets and Pittsburgh were fighting for first 
place and we had to try to win every game we could." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Campbell was the Padres' second baseman then, later became one of their 
radio/television voices and is now a broadcaster for ESPN. He casts still 
another vote for Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always put myself in the manager's place," Campbell said. "When you 
manage, you do everything you can to win. I wasn't surprised he took Kirby out. 
I was surprised there was so much flak. The story seemed to magnify as time 
went on." 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, Campbell was with the Astros when Gomez removed Wilson with a 
no-hitter going. 
</P>
<P>
"Preston walked by me after he made the move," Campbell said. "He said to me, 
'Do you remember seeing this before?' I said, 'I sure do.' " 
</P>
<P>
Two of Kirby's fellow pitchers, starter Pat Dobson and reliever Gary Ross, feel 
that Kirby should have been allowed to stay in. Dobson, the Padres' big winner 
with 14 victories that year, is now their pitching coach. Ross owns a liquor 
store in Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
Dobson: "I didn't think it was a good idea to take him out. It would have been 
a big boost for him and the franchise. I wouldn't have been very happy if it 
had happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
Ross: "I couldn't believe it. Preston Gomez didn't think the way anybody else 
felt. He didn't communicate at all, and the whole organization was mismanaged. 
You've got to give a guy a chance to pitch a no-hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Kirby, who became a grandfather on his 41st birthday last year, is 
involved in various businesses -- real estate, international trading, 
electrical contracting and mortgage brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
"My kids are grown (23 and 20) now, and I wouldn't mind getting back into 
baseball," he said. "I'm footloose and fancy-free." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Kirby took a look back at a career in which he compiled a 75-104 
record before injuries cut it short at 28. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize how good I could have been," he said. "If I had, I might have 
done something different. I wouldn't have listened to everybody."

IRVINE'S TACO BELL RECALLS ITS PLASTIC BICYCLE BOTTLES;

Taco Bell began a voluntary recall Friday of 300,000 plastic water bottles 
being sold as promotion items after receiving reports that they pose a risk to 
small children, who could pull out and possibly choke on the small, movable 
tops. 
</P>
<P>
The recall began after Irvine-based Taco Bell and the bottle's manufacturer, 
Specialized Bicycle Components of Morgan Hill, told the U.S. Consumer Product 
Safety Commission about the potential hazard. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Taco Bell halted sales of the brightly colored sports bottle after 
receiving reports of three incidents in which children had pulled off the tops 
-- similar in design to the top on a bottle of dishwashing liquid -- and tried 
to swallow them. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, Specialized Bicycle officials said, a parent performed the 
Heimlich maneuver on a child who had started to choke on the top, which was 
stuck in his windpipe. In another, a top was removed from the child's mouth 
before he choked. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials declined to detail the incidents, which occurred in the 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
The sales halt came just three days after Taco Bell had started selling the 
neon-color bottles for 99 cents each as part of a $12-million "tacos to go" ad 
promotion featuring professional bicycle racer Greg LeMond. The bottles were 
being sold at 2,700 U.S. Taco Bell outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Taco Bell said that it had ordered 2.5 million of the bottles for the campaign 
but that just 300,000 had been sold as of Thursday. Taco Bell spokesman Elliott 
Bloom said the bottles can be returned to Taco Bell for a full refund. 
</P>
<P>
Specialized Bicycle, the nation's largest maker of bicycle water bottles, has 
produced more than 10 million of the containers in the last decade without 
reported risk or injury, company spokesman Ken Brenner said. 
</P>
<P>
The company has stopped production and distribution of the bottle because of 
the Taco Bell recall, he said, although it is still being sold through bicycle 
shops and other speciality retailers. 
</P>
<P>
The bottle is made up of a main container, a cap and a small mouthpiece closure 
top, called a poppet, which is pulled with the teeth as a person is riding a 
bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom said the poppet is designed to come off altogether with a hard pull so 
the bottle can be cleaned. But this feature also poses a potential choking 
hazard to children, Taco Bell said in a statement warning parents to keep young 
children away from the bottles. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom said company officials worked through the night Thursday to make a 
presentation to the consumer commission. By law, companies are required to 
notify the agency in a timely manner when they suspect that a product is 
hazardous, commission spokeswoman Anne L. Pavlich said. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to the commission as soon as this thing was reported to us," Bloom 
said. "We became very concerned there was a potential safety problem." 
</P>
<P>
Alan Schoem, director of the division of administrative litigation for the 
commission, said Taco Bell decided that "since it was being sold in a fast-food 
restaurant, it was more likely that children would have access" to it. 
</P>
<P>
He added that it "might be a different story in a bicycle shop or sport shop," 
which caters primarily to adult customers. 
</P>
<P>
Specialized Bicycle is "doing the research and the inquiries into the problem" 
before deciding whether to remove or repackage the bottle for sale at retail 
stores, Brenner said. 
</P>
<P>
The company may add a safety sticker or redesign the bottle, he said, adding 
that company officials "do not want to have a product out there with a 
potential danger. They have stopped all production and distribution and are 
doing research into solving the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Besides producing millions of the bottles for the fast-growing bicycle market, 
the bottles have also been used as promotion items in other ad campaigns, such 
as one for Gatorade Thirst Quencher, Brenner said. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Clements, a spokesman for the National Bicycle Dealers Assn., a trade 
group based in Costa Mesa, said Specialized Bicycle is known as the biggest 
U.S. maker of water bottles. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never heard of a problem (among bicycling enthusiasts) with their 
bottles," Clements said.

SPIKE LEE'S 'WE CUT HEADS' FORETELLS GREAT THINGS; 
</P>
<P>
THE MOVIE MAKER'S FIRST FILM, PRODUCED IN 1982, COVERS ABOUT THE SAME GROUND AS 
'DO THE RIGHT THING' AND IS SOMETIMES CLUMSY BUT REVEALING. IT WILL SCREEN 
TONIGHT AT UC IRVINE.

<P>
The Bedford-Stuyvesant in Spike Lee's "Do The Right Thing" is a barbed mesh of 
races: Edgy black youths mingle with their soft, resigned elders on the corner, 
all of them mixing uneasily with the few whites and Asians who have built lives 
in this Brooklyn neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
It's a different vision than what Lee offered in his first full-fledged movie, 
the hourlong "Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads," made seven years 
earlier in 1982 while he was a graduate student at New York University. The 
Bed-Stuy here is all black; Lee's camera pans over the graffiti-marked avenues 
and alleys to find blacks dealing with the pressures that they place on 
themselves. Whitey seems like a distant concern. 
</P>
<P>
It makes sense that "We Cut Heads" -- to be screened tonight by UC Irvine's 24 
Frames Per Second film society -- has a narrower focus. This often clumsy but 
revealing movie keeps its ambition reined in. Later on, as Lee's experience and 
talents grew, his foundation was solid enough to engage the race-relations 
issue in the more expansive and provocative "Do The Right Thing." 
</P>
<P>
What's intriguing about "We Cut Heads" is not the simple, linear story of Zack 
(played by the almost expressionless Monty Ross) and his running afoul of black 
mobsters, but the linkages between Lee's immature style and the more advanced 
movie-maker he has become. There are seeds, both thematically and 
cinematically, in the early film that later sprouted in "Do The Right Thing." 
</P>
<P>
The ending in "We Cut Heads" pivots on violence and arson, the same as in "Do 
The Right Thing." Lee's take is more ambiguous as Zack, who has stolen the 
mob's numbers money to make a better life for his family, awaits its revenge in 
his barbershop. He's spent the night reflecting on what a man would do, and he 
is determined to do the right thing and face them down. The threat of fire 
tempers him. 
</P>
<P>
At the close of "Do The Right Thing," the white-owned Sal's Famous Pizzeria is 
torched when black rage and racism ignite. The event has been justly criticized 
as dangerous, shallow and sensational, but as a symbol, it has resonance. The 
blaze tempers here as well, lessening, at least temporarily, the tensions in 
Bed-Stuy and allowing Sal and Mookie to forge a tenuous truce. While contrived, 
the scene nonetheless underscores Lee's recurring theme of violence as a fact 
of life in the big cities. 
</P>
<P>
The first moments in "We Cut Heads" are likewise crudely shocking. Joe, Zack's 
partner, is murdered by gang hit men after he tries to steal the mob's money. 
Lee's photographer, Ernest Dickerson, lingers on Joe as he's tied up, bricks 
stuck in his coat pockets, and tossed in the river. 
</P>
<P>
Later, when Zack is forced to accept the same deal Joe had, namely to employ 
the barbershop as a front for the numbers game, we are treated to close-ups of 
thugs pounding on Zack. The blood and bruises are missing in "Do The Right 
Thing," but the same in-your-face camera work is used, although more gracefully 
and controlled. 
</P>
<P>
Lee's reliance on music for distinctive mood also shows up in "We Cut Heads." 
As usual, much of the soundtrack was composed by his father, Bill Lee; here, it 
has a vaguely sad, out-of-sync quality that may or may not have been 
intentional. Whatever, the effect comes close to being foreshadowing -- not 
explosive like his use of MTV sound with the occasional MTV image employed in 
his later movies but more casual. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Lee's most accessible trait is his naturalistic humor that comes across 
as throwaway but actually is dynamic. In the movie's most amusing, and probably 
affecting, scene, Zack plays checkers with his young assistant, Teapot (Stuart 
Smith), and they talk about hairstyles. 
</P>
<P>
Teapot knows that a look can make the young black on the move, and he can't 
understand why Zack refuses to increase business by doing voguish wild cuts and 
processes. Zack thinks blacks should be more natural; "Processes ruin the hair 
and the brain too. That's why we've got so many dumb niggers," he tells the 
boy. Teapot immediately grasps that they're talking about pride and African 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in another fetching scene, Teapot reverts to form and gives a little 
street lesson to a tiny friend. He talks tough, jive and dirty, and the kid 
mimics him. Both segments, shot in a direct, simple way, tell much about the 
ritualistic passing of knowledge and gaining of identity. 
</P>
<P>
Lee contrasts these lighter passages with hard images of the blacks who prey on 
other blacks. The fancy-man mob boss, Nicholas Lovejoy (Tommie Hicks, who also 
appeared in "She's Gotta Have It"), talks with the sway of a preacher about the 
opportunities created by the numbers: "I give hope, I make dreams real. What 
I'm talking about is unity." But Zack knows that's a lie, and his face, usually 
so blank, is full of contempt for this exploiter. 
</P>
<P>
Very nice, these scenes. Make no mistake, though; "We Cut Heads" is not a great 
movie and certainly not a refined one. It is an accomplished low-budget effort 
that, while betraying the errors and sentimentality of young art, also 
documents the craftsmanship and lyrical energy of a movie-maker soon to be 
reckoned with. 
</P>

POLL ON NEA PURCHASES OF ARTWORK MAY HAVE ASKED WRONG QUESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "Artist Sues the Rev. Wildmon Over Mailing" by Allan Parachini (May 
22): 
</P>
<P>
I found it encouraging that artist David Wojnarowicz has filed suit against the 
Rev. Donald Wildmon and his group -- encouraging because he's fighting back. 
He's letting the "traditional values" people know that they can't distort art 
and defame artists with impunity. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what the outcome is, the suit is a step in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
Wildmon claimed to be appealing to "the average American voter." Well, that's 
me, and I'm fed up with the "traditional values" people trying to make my world 
as narrow as theirs. 
</P>
<P>
In your article, you quote an arts law expert as saying that this art 
censorship may be ". . . incident to a larger agenda." That's the most chilling 
aspect of this entire controversy.

POLL ON NEA PURCHASES OF ARTWORK MAY HAVE ASKED WRONG QUESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing in regard to The Times' Orange County poll of 600 voters 
concerning the expenditure of federal funds for "artwork" by the National 
Endowment for the Arts -- "O.C. Opposes 'Catch' on NEA Funds, Poll Finds" (June 
4). 
</P>
<P>
The survey produced results generally disapproving of federal standards to 
control controversial or obscene . . . artwork, with 57% disapproving, 32% 
approving and 11% undecided. 
</P>
<P>
In a society saddled with an obsessive preoccupation with daily living, 
addiction to entertainment and an unimpressive literacy level, it is unlikely 
that the average voter is aware of, much less concerned with, the controversy 
generated by the NEA's past indiscretions. It would be interesting to know how 
those surveyed were selected. By what criteria were they chosen? Party 
affiliation? How many were even aware of the existence of the NEA? Also, it 
would be interesting to know if the 600 were actually aware of the NEA's 
predicament and how many voters were contacted before enough knowledgeable ones 
were mustered. 
</P>
<P>
A survey posing the question, "Do you approve or disapprove of the federal 
government setting control standards to decide what artwork to fund and what 
artwork not to fund?" is, to say the least, disingenuous. To be blunt, without 
detailed information on the survey itself, there is every reason to 
characterize it as a 'stacked' attempt at eliciting a desired conclusion -- 
just another example of the propagandistic talent of The Times (which seems 
ever-eager to manufacture misleading public opinion). 
</P>
<P>
The real issue is whether the federal government should fund controversial or 
obscene artwork when the NEA's administrative machinery is so disposed. That 
is, of course, a matter of public policy in response to the fundamental 
question: What is good for society? 
</P>
<P>
In that light, the survey is valueless. And one may well ask what would have 
been the results had the survey posed the question, "Do you approve or 
disapprove of the NEA exercising an unlimited privilege to spend federal funds 
on anti-Christian, pornographic or obscene artwork?" I suggest that more than 
57% would have disapproved. 
</P>
<P>
Although The Times has utilized the talents of Allan Parachini and others for 
well over a year to keep the controversy falsely presented as one of an 
unjustifiable limitation on artistic freedom, the truth is that the NEA's past 
indiscretions are the cause of the controversy. And such a question as I have 
suggested would have presented the issue honestly and without any hint of 
purposeful obfuscation.

THE UGLY ARCHITECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An article ("Gehry: An American in Paris," May 22) described the newest project 
by Los Angeles-based architect Frank Gehry. Its author, Leon Whiteson, spared 
no words in describing Gehry's design of the American Center in Paris as "a 
masterpiece of compressed, eccentric energy held in balance by the tension 
between its elements." 
</P>
<P>
He also quoted Gehry himself as saying that the center is "a dancing figure, 
joyous, friendly and welcoming." 
</P>
<P>
Well, I have just had it! As an architect of more that 30 years of practice, I 
have to say that I am sick of Gehry's architecture. This project, as just about 
anything he has done, is a deliberate effort to shock the public into 
submission. It does not resemble a dancing figure in any way, it is not joyous, 
and it most definitely does not contain anything inviting. What is looks like 
is a discombobulating array of geometrical forms, with its leaning cylinder, 
falling walls and an ugly canopy that, in Gehry's words looks "like a ballerina 
lifting her skirts." One cannot readily tell where the entrance to the center 
is, nor can one understand the purpose of the strangely shaped box resembling a 
computer terminal sitting on top of the canopy. 
</P>
<P>
It is an insult to American architecture to call this hodgepodge of falling 
geometrical forms an "American in Paris." If anything, it may remind Americans 
living in Paris of California: the configuration strongly resembles a snapshot 
of a strange building frozen in time after an earthquake, condemned because of 
its lack of structural safety and awaiting the wrecking ball. Let's hope that 
some unknown French building official with his feet firmly planted on the 
ground will see it for what it is, and deny the building permit for it.

GARDENERS: DON'T GIVE BUGS A BREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. BAZINET, Kenneth R. Bazinet writes for United Press 
International. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took weeks to till all the soil and clear the dead leaves and other debris 
from the patch of land that -- with any luck -- will deliver tasty vegetables 
or a picturesque flower show. 
</P>
<P>
But don't get lazy now. There are a few unwelcome visitors in the garden that 
have to be taken care of. 
</P>
<P>
That green thing hanging off the tomato plant is not a leaf. And those brown, 
squishy things look like they're building a patio under the lettuce. Those 
pesky garden pests that were not there when the planting began are ruining all 
your work. 
</P>
<P>
"The pests just make your plants and ornamentals a mess," says Micheal D. 
Smith, managing editor of the gardening division of Ortho Books. "But there are 
ways to counter them." 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of insect and insect-family pests invade gardens at various times 
each year. Most of the tiny terrors arrive by their sensory perception -- they 
tell plants by color, texture and fragrance -- then decide if the particular 
vegetation is something they want in their diet. 
</P>
<P>
A few pests, such as the gypsy moth and various mites, reach a garden by 
accident, perhaps hitching a ride under a car or truck or on a pant leg from 
someone's favorite overalls. 
</P>
<P>
Once in the garden, the pests can maul plants in a variety of ways -- some 
munch away at stems, leafs and petals, others dig around plants, and some even 
suck and sponge away nutrients needed to keep the vegetation healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Different insects, whether they invaded your garden intentionally or by 
accident, require different strategies to get rid of them, depending on the way 
they feed. 
</P>
<P>
Predators are friendly insects that devour the garden-gorging pests. The 
beneficial insects, like the praying mantis, snail-eating ground beetle and 
ladybug larvae, can be imported into the garden, where they police the area for 
the leaf- and flower-munching pests. 
</P>
<P>
Smith warns, however, that if chemicals are going to be used in a garden in 
addition to the predators, extra care should be taken in reading and 
understanding the potency of the pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, understanding the chemical pesticides is important no matter what, 
but in particular, you don't want to kill off the pests' natural predators," he 
says. "You have to take care in understanding chemical pesticides." 
</P>
<P>
Other ways to combat pests include using sticky traps that catch pests as they 
make their way into the garden or up a fruit tree. 
</P>
<P>
Another alternative is building barriers to keep crawling bugs out, but this is 
a time-consuming project that can involve digging trenches or wrapping aluminum 
stripping around the border of the garden. 
</P>
<P>
There has also been research into creating pathogenic diseases that fight off 
and eliminate pests while not harming people, pets or wildlife. The disease 
germs can be introduced into the garden in ways similar to spreading chemical 
pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
Smith says the best way to combat a specific pest is to first identify the 
insect by appearance -- "a photo will do" -- then research what the particular 
pest is known to eat. "From there, you can learn the best way to get rid of the 
pests," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But bear in mind that winning a battle against a pest doesn't necessarily mean 
that the war is over. 
</P>
<P>
"Pests return," Smith says. "You have to make sure the plants are healthy. You 
don't want leaves with holes in them or browning."

ASK THE JUDGE: STATE NO LONGER COLLECTS TAX ON TOURISTS' TREASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By B. TAM NOMOTO, B. Tam Nomoto, an Orange County Municipal Court judge 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q. I am planning a vacation to Sweden. I would like to buy some things over 
there, but I understand that California may be collecting some sort of tax on 
items tourists bring back. 
</P>
<P>
S.B., 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
A. Although California has a law that allows it to collect sales tax on 
purchases its residents make in foreign countries, it no longer collects this 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
For a brief time, the State Board of Equalization used the declaration that 
California residents filled out for customs to determine the amount of sales 
tax the state would collect. This tax was in addition to any duty the buyer was 
required to pay to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I have two questions about our traffic laws. The first deals with bike 
lanes. I live in a city that has a great bike lane system. I ride my bike every 
morning as part of my workout. What really irritates me is the number of 
joggers and walkers who use the bike lane. They often run or walk two abreast 
and won't move even when they see a bicyclist approach. Bikers are often forced 
out into the lanes of traffic to avoid hitting these people. There is a 
sidewalk next to the bike lane that they can walk on. I think it's unsafe to 
allow pedestrians to use the bike lane. What does the law say? 
</P>
<P>
The second question: Is hitchhiking allowed in California? I have a friend who 
is visiting from Europe and plans to hitchhike through California. Aside from 
the dangers it involves, should my friend be concerned about breaking the law? 
</P>
<P>
E.L., 
</P>
<P>
Irvine 
</P>
<P>
A. Irvine Police Lt. Al Muir says the law forbids pedestrians from being in a 
bicycle lane when there is an adjacent sidewalk. When there is no sidewalk, 
they are allowed in the bike lane but must run or walk against oncoming traffic 
for safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Enforcement of the law is left to the individual officer. In the case of an 
accident involving a pedestrian where there is an adjacent sidewalk, the police 
will frequently cite the pedestrian. Muir suggests that if you are concerned 
about this problem, write to the Irvine City Council and to the police chief. 
</P>
<P>
As to your second question, California forbids hitchhikers to stand in the 
roadway. Each city also has the authority to pass laws regulating hitchhikers. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I am a victim of a rape. I have been going through a counseling program to 
help me deal with it. I just received word that a person has been arrested for 
it. Although I am very frightened, I am determined to cooperate with the police 
so that he cannot do this kind of thing to anyone again. 
</P>
<P>
My question deals with whether my counseling sessions are confidential. In 
trying to cope with this horrible experience, I have tried to be as honest as 
possible with my counselor. I am concerned that the things I have told her may 
be brought out in public at the trial. Does the law help rape victims by 
protecting what they say to their counselors? 
</P>
<P>
S.S., 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
A. Generally, the law does protect confidential communications made by a rape 
victim during counseling. This confidentiality or privilege depends upon with 
whom the victim shares the communication. Normally, communications between a 
victim and a psychiatrist, psychologist, licensed clinical social worker, a 
licensed family or child counselor, or a sexual assault victim counselor are 
privileged and cannot be disclosed without the victim's consent. 
</P>
<P>
The law ordinarily does not extend this privilege to communications made by a 
rape victim to a physician. 
</P>

questions about the law. Ask the Judge runs every other Saturday in Orange 
County Life.

JOSEPH N. BELL: HOW TO WIN IN SPLIT-CHECK GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today, we address a social problem high on the agenda of Orange County 
Yuppiedom. It's called the Split Check, and it goes like this: 
</P>
<P>
You go out to lunch with three people from the office. You're not hungry or 
you're on a diet or you don't drink, so you order a bowl of soup and a glass of 
water. The others have a couple of drinks, a steak with all the trimmings, and 
dessert. 
</P>
<P>
The check comes and lays there, moribund, on the table until you feel the need 
to leave. So you clear your throat and pick it up and say, "I figure my part of 
this is about . . ." -- whereupon one of your associates says heartily, "Oh 
hell, why don't we just split it four ways instead of nit-picking the check." 
</P>
<P>
This leaves you the choice of being identified as a nit-picker -- trying to 
extract your numbers as the others watch disdainfully -- or buying steaks you 
didn't eat and drinks you didn't drink. 
</P>
<P>
This scenario plays out much the same way when you are out to dinner with 
another couple or two and eat lightly while the others are stoking up on 
gourmet food and vintage wine. Understand, we are talking here about social 
occasions, not business entertainment in which the destination of the check is 
clear from the beginning and will show up on an expense account. In the game of 
Check Splitting, you are dealing with your own money. 
</P>
<P>
OK, what to do? Eat the check because it is terribly important to you to 
sustain the Good Guy image? Get out your pencil and break the check down in 
spite of the penurious image it conveys? Stop going out to lunch or dinner with 
friends where the ground rules are not explicit? Or none of the above? 
</P>
<P>
In order to search out less cataclysmic solutions to this weighty question, I 
conducted a totally unscientific survey among some of my socially minded 
friends and associates I know to be veteran Check-Splitters. Several 
possibilities were suggested that seem useful to me, and I hereby pass them 
along to you as a public service of this column: 
</P>
<P>
1. Turn the tables. This works best when you know a day or two ahead that you 
will be eating out. Miss the meal before you go out so you are enormously 
hungry, and order generously. Then you jump in with the split proposal. If you 
are unable to eat this much, even when famished, take the residue home with you 
and have it for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
2. Ask for separate checks. This requires a certain amount of chutzpah and 
shouldn't be attempted unless you are prepared to ignore the hostility of the 
waiter -- who hates this sort of thing -- and the possible irritation of your 
eating partners. It also won't enhance your reputation as a social lion. 
</P>
<P>
3. Take over the wine list. One of the more serious problems that arises in 
Check Splitting is when one member of your party picks up the wine list and 
muses aloud that he can't decide between the 1975 Sebastiani Cabernet or the 
1982 Martini Pinot Noir. He, alone, is privy to the price list, and you see 
dollar signs mounting up on the bill with such prodigious speed that you don't 
even enjoy the half-glass of wine you nurture so your friend won't be moved to 
order a second bottle. 
</P>
<P>
The solution here is to quickly take charge of the wine list as the waiter 
stands hesitantly waiting for someone to claim it. You put it down firmly in 
front of you, unopened, and announce in a hearty voice that you've heard the 
house wine here is excellent "so why don't we go that route?" If your dining 
partners still insist on looking at the wine list, at least you have made your 
point. And if you go out to eat with them again, make it brunch. 
</P>
<P>
4. Set the ground rules beforehand. No moment is quite as awkward at a shared 
social meal as the arrival of the check, usually dropped somewhere near the 
center of the table. From that moment on, everything at the table is played out 
at two levels: the conscious level of conversation and the subconscious level 
of how to deal with the check. 
</P>
<P>
This awkwardness can be avoided simply by establishing the ground rules 
beforehand. But someone must take the lead, and when couples are involved, it 
has to be one of the men. The woman's role in this situation is to observe all 
the nuances carefully so she can later come down on her partner for being (A) 
parsimonious, (B) profligate or (C) cowardly. It has been my observation that 
so far, feminism has not moved aggressively into the role of dealing with 
checks under such circumstances, but has reserved the right to be critical. 
</P>
<P>
5. Select the restaurant yourself -- or at least participate in the selection. 
The choice of an expensive restaurant is probably the most important cause of 
stress on the Check-Splitting scene. If you have agreed to go out to dinner 
with someone and allowed them to select the restaurant unilaterally, you may 
find yourself plunging next month's mortgage money on the cheapest chicken on 
the menu. And you hate chicken. 
</P>
<P>
In this difficult social thicket, there are also some ploys that need to be 
recognized and resisted. One of the more flagrant is the friend who insists on 
picking up the whole check for a Spartan breakfast with the offhand jovial 
comment, "You can get the next one" -- which you realize too late is a dinner 
already planned at a fancy restaurant. Or the dining companion who says, "Why 
don't we talk a little business so you can put this on your expense account?" 
-- when you have just been told that your company has entered a period of 
austerity. 
</P>
<P>
One permanent solution is to select your dining-out friend exclusively from 
among Big Spenders who meet their own ego needs by picking up checks. This may 
be a little hard on your self-respect, and the talk may be boring, but look at 
it as social work among the rich. And have another glass of wine.

SOCIAL SWIRLERS LEAP AT ATTENDING OAKS CLASSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAMELA MARIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joan Irvine Smith was host of her fifth annual Oaks Classic on Sunday -- a hot 
afternoon of fast horses leaping tall fences in an oak-shaded show ring at 
Smith's San Juan Capistrano riding center. 
</P>
<P>
The two-day event is one of the most prestigious show-jumping competitions on 
the West Coast, and with prize money totaling $75,000 and VIP accommodations, 
it brings out the local social swirlers. 
</P>
<P>
Among those striding the ringside Astroturf in the shade of the VIP tent (hung 
with framed oil paintings in generic Impressionist style), were Lois and Buzz 
Aldrin, Jolene and Tom Fuentes, Dr. Robert H. Schuller and his son and 
daughter-in-law, Robert and Donna Schuller, Ardith and Howard Marguleas, June 
and Victor Andrews, and Donna and John Crean. Asked about her interest in 
horses, Donna Crean of Newport Beach said that while she wasn't an 
equestrienne, her daughter once took a shine to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, we came here to eat," Crean said between bites. 
</P>
<P>
The lavishly laden buffets -- each topped with huge floral decorations and 
cooled by giant fans -- were enough of a reason to make the drive. To feed the 
masses -- more than 1,000 people attended the event, including about 400 guests 
in the VIP tent Sunday -- Cathee Hickok of Rococo catering hauled in 6,000 
jumbo shrimp, 5,000 oysters, 3,000 clams, 400 pounds of crab claws, 400 pounds 
of lobster and 200 pounds of ceviche. 
</P>
<P>
Smith spent most of the afternoon at a table in the shade with friends Monte 
Fisher, Jan and Bill Baker and Catherine Shattuck. Smith's mother, Athalie 
Clarke, sat nearby chatting with ear specialist Dr. Howard House. PAMELA MARIN

LASIX BAN MAIN THREAT TO UNBRIDLED TODAY

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Country Day, a colt with two victories in 15 starts, no stakes victories and no 
victories in more than six months, is the third morning-line choice, and that's 
all that needs to be said about the 122nd running of the Belmont Stakes today 
at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
Today's will be one of the weakest fields to contest the 1 1/2 miles, the final 
race in the Triple Crown series. There won't be a horse in the race who has won 
more races than he has lost. The closest are two .500 hitters, Baron de Vaux, 
the eighth-place finisher in the Preakness, and Go and Go, the Irish-bred who 
won the Laurel Futurity on the dirt last year in Maryland. Neither is given 
much chance of upsetting Unbridled, the 4-5 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled is called an honest horse, with in-the-money finishes in all but one 
of his 12 starts, victories in the Kentucky Derby and the Florida Derby and a 
second-place finish behind Summer Squall in the Preakness. If Unbridled loses 
today, the result will be overshadowed by the question of how the absence of 
Lasix, the anti-bleeding drug that's illegal in New York, affected the Kentucky 
Derby winner. 
</P>
<P>
The eight other horses still are in search of reputations. Yonder, expected to 
be the second betting choice, had not won a stake this year until the Jersey 
Derby at Garden State Park on May 28. He won in the second-slowest time in the 
history of that race at 1 1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Country Day has a trainer, John Parisella, who calls more attention to the 
horse than he deserves. Country Day beat maidens at Calder in July and also won 
an allowance race there last November, but has shown little in the big races. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty Six Red is the only horse besides Unbridled to have won a major stake, 
but his Wood Memorial victory April 21 was devalued after a ninth-place finish 
in the Kentucky Derby two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
The other Belmont starters: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Video Ranger, who earned his only victory in the $40,000 Santa Anita race 
that he was claimed out of. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Land Rush, who has only two victories in 11 races, one of them a minor 
stake at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hawaiian Pass, who is also two for 11, neve better than third in a stake. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is doubt that Unbridled can win without Lasix. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, horses that come from far off the pace seldom win the Belmont. 
Alysheba, whose running style is much like Unbridled's, fell far back in the 
1987 Belmont and never gained contact with the leaders. His fourth-place finish 
cost him the Triple Crown and a $5-million payday. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Perret, the jockey who rode Bet Twice to victory in the 1987 Belmont, 
also rides Unbridled. Carl Nafzger, who trains Unbridled, said he will give 
Perret the same instructions today that he gave in the Derby -- which is to say 
none. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know when Craig will ask our horse to run," Nafzger said. "But Craig 
knows this horse better than anybody -- you hae to understand that he's usually 
on him in the mornings as well as in the races -- and I'll leave it up to him. 
The main thing is that my horse relaxes, and he'll do whatever the jockey asks 
him to do. If my horse has his way, he'll win the race." 
</P>
<P>
Nafzger is hoping someone -- Land Rush, perhaps -- tries to run early with 
Thirty Six Red, who appears to be the only front-runner in the race. Although 
Thirty Six Red has the breeding to win at 1 1/2 miles -- each of his 
grandsires, Seattle Slew and Stage Door Johnny, won the Belmont -- trainer Nick 
Zito didn't run him beyond a mile until his 11th start, the 1 1/8-mile Wood. 
The colt was hard-pressed to hold off Burnt Hills at the wire. 
</P>
<P>
Land Rush, seventh in the Kentucky Derby and sixth in the Preakness, seldom has 
been rushed in his races. 
</P>
<P>
"Speed wins the Belmont when the speed isn't cheap," Nafzger said. "But I don't 
think Thirty Six Red will be allowed to go out there by himself. I can't 
believe that (trainer Wayne) Lukas will go the same way with Land Rush that he 
did in the other two (Triple Crown) races. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he'll try to go over center from the two-yard line for the third 
straight time. I think he'll look at the Blue Grass and decide to have Land 
Rush run another race like that." 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Grass, at Keeneland on April 14, was Land Rush's best race. He stuck a 
head in front on the far turn and gave ground only grudgingly the rest of the 
way, finishing second, 1 3/4 lengths behind Summer Squall. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of Summer Squall, second in the Kentucky Derby and 2 1/4 lengths 
better than Unbridled in the Preakness, means Unbridled needs to finish the 
Belmont to collect the $1-million Triple Crown bonus. 
</P>
<P>
For Unbridled, this Belmont is almost a no-win situation. Should he lose, he 
will be remembered as a horse who couldn't win the big one without his 
medication. And if he wins, it will be over a group of opponents who have a 
long way to go before they become household names. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bill Shoemaker, who won five Belmonts, one fewer than Eddie Arcaro and James 
McLaughlin, will be honored here today with the Mike Venezia Memorial Award, 
presented annually for contributions to racing. Venezia is the jockey who died 
when he was trampled at Belmont in 1988 . . . For only the second time in the 
last nine years, trainer Woody Stephens will not have a starter in the Belmont. 
Stephens, who saddled five consecutive winners in the race starting in 1982, 
remains in intensive care in a Louisville hospital since undergoing open-heart 
surgery on May 11. . . . Stephens trained Yonder before the horse was turned 
over to Angel Penna Sr. in late April. 
</P>
<P>
Stella Madrid, winner of the Acorn, will try to win the second leg of the New 
York triple for 3-year-old fillies when she runs in the 1 1/8-mile Mother Goose 
at Belmont Sunday. The favorite in the race probably will be either Go for Wand 
or Charon. The other starters will be Bright Candles, Dance Colony and Danzig's 
Beauty . . . Today's weather for the Belmont Stakes is expected to be humid, 
with temperatures in low 80s and a 30% chance of thunderstorms. . . . Peter 
Brant, who owned 25% of 1984 Kentucky Derby and Belmont winner Swale, has been 
given a 90-day suspended sentence after pleading guilty to tax fraud. Brant, 
who also raced Gulch, Just a Game, Track Barron and Waya, owns Stella Madrid. 
He was ordered to pay $375,000 in taxes and penalties and was fined $200,000. . 
. . The Belmont is worth $686,000 with $411,600 going to the winner. . . . On 
Friday at Belmont, Craig Perret won his second stake in as many days, riding 
Tricky Creek, a 12-1 shot, to a nose victory over another longshot, Montubio, 
in the $100,000 Nassau County Handicap. De Roche finished third. On Thursday, 
Perret rode Safely Kept to victory in the Genuine Risk at Belmont.

PRO BASKETBALL: RICK ADELMAN, A PLAYERS' COACH, SAYS HE HASN'T CHANGED MUCH 
SINCE HIS EARLY DAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rick Adelman, coach of the Portland Trail Blazers, stands with a benign 
expression, slouching a little, and insists he can be a disciplinarian. 
</P>
<P>
Keep probing him about it and Adelman might get really mad and, oh, raise his 
voice a bit or sharply arch one of his caterpillar eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
Try as he might to come off as a tough NBA taskmaster, Adelman truly is as calm 
and unflappable as he appears. 
</P>
<P>
Portland players talk about Adelman's "competitive fire" and say they actually 
have seen him rage once or twice in the locker room. But Adelman's success in 
guiding the Trail Blazers to the NBA finals comes from his low-key running of a 
team that once was governed strictly by coaches as tight as a tennis racket. 
</P>
<P>
Adelman has the Trail Blazers in a favorable position against the Detroit 
Pistons going into Game 3 Sunday afternoon in Portland. They split the first 
two games in Detroit, and the next three games are in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
"I always have confidence in what this team can do," Adelman said. "I'm not 
surprised we won on the road. We've responded all season." 
</P>
<P>
Trail Blazer players have responded positively to Adelman in his first full 
season as coach. On Feb. 18, 1989, when Adelman replaced Mike Schuler -- the 
new Clipper coach -- as Portland's head man, the Trail Blazers were united only 
in their dislike of Schuler's intensity and strictness. 
</P>
<P>
Adelman, hired as an assistant by equally intense Jack Ramsay in 1983, had 
developed a warmer rapport with players, particularly star guard Clyde Drexler. 
That relationship has endured even though Adelman now makes the decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Consciously or not, Trail Blazer players are more motivated and cohesive under 
Adelman than Schuler. Certainly, it is a happier group. Adelman believes unity 
is a major reason for Portland's success. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to coach the way I wanted to be coached when I was a player," Adelman 
said. "That's just the way I've approached it, and the players have responded 
well. It's a player's league. You got to get them to do what you think is the 
best way to win." 
</P>
<P>
Adelman often talks about "creating an atmosphere where (a) player can 
succeed." He approaches it by rarely publicly criticizing an individual, by 
being more lenient than Schuler in allowing practice days off and by not 
drastically altering playing time when players are struggling. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to include the players because it is as much their team as mine," 
Adelman said. "I don't feel like I'm up here and they're down there." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Adelman relates to players because he was a player. A journeyman guard 
for seven NBA seasons, Adelman was an original Trail Blazer, a starter for 
three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Though it has been 15 years since Adelman last played in the NBA, he remembers 
what goes through players' minds, when rest is needed and even when a lecture 
is in order. 
</P>
<P>
"He can relate to us," Drexler said. "We think he should've been coach of the 
year. No question about it, we came together after he became coach. So many 
things had happened last year, we just couldn't get it together. But Rick's 
demeanor and competitive fire shows through the team. The team is a reflection 
of Rick." 
</P>
<P>
On Adelman's first day as head coach, he met privately with Drexler and told 
him he was the team's focal point and would be treated like others of his 
stature, like Magic Johnson or Larry Bird. 
</P>
<P>
"I was an assistant when Clyde came, Jerome (Kersey), Terry (Porter), (Kevin) 
Duckworth, all those guys," Adelman said. "We formed our own relationship. I 
worked hard with those guys every summer. 
</P>
<P>
"When I took over, I think they felt I knew what I was doing, and they had 
respect for what I could do. It's been easy. I've changed a little bit because 
now I'm the guy who makes decisions, but we always had a good understanding and 
mutual respect for what we did." 
</P>
<P>
Even Kersey, who was close to Schuler, said he has thrived under Adelman's 
less-is-more leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"He's kept that rapport with the players, and that's not easy," Kersey said. "I 
think he understands the point that you have to relate to your players, let 
them know who's in charge but give them room, too. We have that even keel as a 
group, and it comes from him." 
</P>
<P>
But Adelman does not pamper his players. At times, he can be a difficult boss, 
and coming from someone normally sedate, his occasional tantrums get the 
players' attention. 
</P>
<P>
"What goes on in our locker room is sometimes different than what everyone else 
sees on the court," Adelman said. "Sometimes, you have to get mad. But if you 
do it constantly, eventually they're going to tune you out. I always feel you 
get more done by being a positive supporter than by being critical. I don't try 
to compare myself to Mike (Schuler) or anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Adelman, who guided the Trail Blazers to their best record, 59-23, began the 
season with a one-year contract. But in March he was given a three-year 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
"I coached the same way now as I coached in junior college," Adelman said. "I 
just happen to have better players now. But I feel if you start changing the 
way you feel you can be effective . . . , they're going to see through that." 
Adelman says he is pretty much the same guy who grew up in Downey, starred at 
Loyola Marymount University in the late 1960s -- before the Marymount was added 
-- and was the Trail Blazers' first captain. 
</P>
<P>
After his NBA career ended in 1975, Adelman returned to Loyola and completed a 
master's in history. But Adelman really wanted to coach, and he landed a job at 
Chemekta Community College in Salem, Ore. He stayed six seasons, compiling a 
141-39 record and winning or sharing three Oregon community college titles. 
</P>
<P>
But this is the job Adelman always wanted and, now, the one to which he seems 
so comfortably suited. 
</P>
<P>
"You know right away if a team is listening to you, whether they believe what 
you say is true and whether they feel they can be successful in doing what 
you're saying," Adelman said. "This team has done that since Day 1 of training 
camp. I've had no problem with that at all. If anything, I'm kind of surprised 
how easy this year has been for me. I'm lucky to have come into a great team 
here."

MIKE DOWNEY: MARADONA: ROUGH DAY BETWEEN THE HANDSHAKES

<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas N'Kono, captain of Cameroon, strode to midfield to shake the hand of 
Diego Maradona, Argentina's nominee as the greatest player in soccer, for the 
opening coin toss of the 14th World Cup here Friday. 
</P>
<P>
This was the kickoff to 31 days of foot-to-foot combat between players from 
four continents -- and to a game that won't be forgotten in 30 more days, or 
possibly 30 more years, by the players or those who watched them play. 
</P>
<P>
Maradona lost the toss, slapped N'Kono on the shoulder in friendship, then 
cupped his hand to give the 35-year-old African goalkeeper a soul shake before 
beginning Argentina's bid to keep the $250,000, 14-karat gold cup that it won 
four years ago in Mexico City. It was the last time Maradona would get to use 
his hands all day. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, he didn't use his feet much, either. 
</P>
<P>
To the satisfaction of many of 73,780 spectators whose foot stomping and flag 
waving helped christen Milan's renovated Giuseppe Meazza Stadium, it was the 
rise and fall of Diego Maradona -- and rise and fall and rise and fall -- that 
made Cameroon's 1-0 upset of Argentina such an entertaining sporting event to 
behold. 
</P>
<P>
The game itself was a joy to anybody who appreciates a good underdog, but to 
these Milanese, it was doubly delightful in that Maradona got the worst of it. 
Some still remember him as a petulant 21-year-old -- "Diego Primadonna," they 
mocked him -- whose argumentative behavior got him booted from a 1982 World Cup 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Others resent his more recent efforts on behalf of rival neighbors from Naples, 
for whom Maradona played in the 1990 Italian soccer season, leading them to a 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, whenever Maradona had the ball Friday, they whistled loudly -- which 
was booing, Italian style. 
</P>
<P>
And, whenever Maradona got knocked off his feet, they approved loudly -- which 
was early and often. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve fouls against Maradona alone were called on Cameroon players. He got 
kicked harder than the ball. He got kicked in the shins, in the calves, in the 
sides, in places in between. He got kicked so repeatedly, it resembled the 
fight scenes from a Chuck Norris movie. The only thing missing was Italian 
dubbing. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't hurt me," Maradona insisted later, proudly. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't even bother mentioning the ingrown toenail that got stomped. Or the 
reddened shinbone that he attempted to show the referee as he limped off the 
field at halftime, right shoe removed. No, little Diego was big about that. So 
big that not only did he graciously accept defeat, but he even took some of the 
credit for improving sociological conditions in the World Cup's host country. 
</P>
<P>
Having been subjected to a predominantly white crowd's start-to-finish support 
of an all-black opponent, Maradona said: "I participated in making Italy 
non-racist. All the stadium was for Cameroon. That was nice." 
</P>
<P>
No wonder President Carolos Menem of Argentina, on the eve of the Cup opener, 
presented Maradona a permanent passport proclaiming him "Argentina's sporting 
ambassador," saying that he was certain Maradona would represent faithfully a 
spirit too often missing in soccer -- that of fair play. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, Maradona never missed a chance Friday to pat an opponent on the 
back or head as he rose from the ground, occasionally still bent over in pain. 
Cameroon players went after Maradona with such relish that, by the time the 
game was over, the winners were playing two men short, twice having had players 
ejected. 
</P>
<P>
At the end, to his everlasting credit, Maradona was right back where he began 
-- shaking hands with N'Kono, the Cameroon goalie. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, on his way to becoming a national folk hero by leading 
Argentina to soccer's greatest prize, Maradona was similarly jostled and bumped 
by tailgaters from Italy and Uruguay, who figured he couldn't score if he 
couldn't stand. 
</P>
<P>
Taunts come with the territory. 
</P>
<P>
At the mere suggestion that Maradona was being roughed up in 1986, Italy's 
Claudio Gentile, who had done much of the roughest roughing, said with a sneer 
that the sport "is not for ballerinas." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever grace Maradona possesses did him no good against Cameroon. He made no 
moves, mainly because he was given no room to move. Whether he was weakened at 
all by the 12 pounds he recently lost, after having puffed up beyond his 
playing weight, was unclear, but what stuck out most about Maradona was a 
telling statistic: 
</P>
<P>
He did not take a shot. Not one, in 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Only the day before, Maradona had attempted to remind friends and foes alike of 
something. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not just Maradona who is defending the title, but the entire squad. If 
Argentina plays well, Maradona also plays well." 
</P>
<P>
And if not? 
</P>
<P>
Well, don't cry for him, Argentina. He can get up by himself.

Vasily V. Kuznetsov, who served as vice president to four Soviet presidents, 
died in Moscow this week at the age of 89, the official newspaper Pravda 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Kuznetsov, who died Tuesday, became Soviet vice president in 1977 under Leonid 
I. Brezhnev and retired from the post in 1986, when Andrei A. Gromyko was 
president. In between, he served under two leaders, Yuri Andropov and 
Konstantin Chernenko. 
</P>
<P>
During a 25-year diplomatic career, Kuznetsov was Soviet ambassador to China, 
served on the 1954 Geneva Conference that negotiated the cease-fire and the 
French withdrawal from Indochina, and in 1962 was part of the delegation that 
traveled to the United States to negotiate the withdrawal of Soviet missiles 
from Cuba after the Cuban Missile Crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other member of the Communist Party's 
Politburo signed Kuznetsov's obituary, which appeared in Pravda on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Kuznetsov, it said, was born to a peasant family on Feb. 13, 1901, in the 
village of Sofilovka near what is now the city of Gorky, 225 miles east of 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
He joined the Red Army in 1920 during the Civil War that followed the Bolshevik 
Revolution of 1917, then trained as a metallurgical engineer and worked in 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
From 1931 to 1933, he studied at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 
Pittsburgh, according to a biography released in 1981 by Radio Free Europe, the 
U.S.-funded station based in Munich, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
He rose to become deputy head of Gosplan, the state planning agency, then 
served as head of the national trade union organization while simultaneously 
acting as chairman of the Soviet of Nationalities, one of two houses of the 
Soviet parliament. 
</P>
<P>
After the death of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in 1953, Kuznetsov lost his 
seat on the Politburo, then known as the Presidium, and became deputy minister 
of foreign affairs.

JOSE FIGUERES, 82; FORMER COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Costa Rican President Jose Figueres, considered the father of peaceful 
modern democracy in his country and one of the most colorful elder statesmen of 
the Western Hemisphere, died Friday. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
Don Pepe, as he was affectionately known, died at his home 10 miles east of San 
Jose, Costa Rica. Presidential spokesman Ana Lorena Vargas did not disclose the 
cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services will be private, but sources said the Costa Rican government 
will decree three days of mourning and that Figueres' body will lie in state at 
the National Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Figueres, the owner of a coffee plantation and rope factory, led a successful 
six-week revolution in 1948 overthrowing communist and rightists' control of 
Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
In the 18 months he served as provisional president of the reorganizational 
junta, he outlawed the Communist Party, directed the writing of a new 
constitution and enacted a truly revolutionary plan: He dissolved the nation's 
army. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-one years later, Costa Rica continues to maintain only a civil guard, 
although it is situated in the midst of warring neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"This small country made a contribution to mankind by outlawing the army," 
Figueres once said. "But we had to pay dearly. We killed 2,000 Communists." 
</P>
<P>
During the reorganization, he also guaranteed public education for all, enabled 
women and illiterates to vote, built housing for the poor, gave citizenship to 
black immigrants' children and established civil service to eliminate the 
spoils system in government. 
</P>
<P>
Figueres was officially elected president of his new republic July 27, 1953, 
promising that "this is going to be a pro-United States government." He served 
until 1958 and was returned to office from 1970 to 1974. As an acknowledged 
elder statesman, he became a roving ambassador for subsequent administrations. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an exemplary little country. We are the example for Latin America," 
Figueres told the Los Angeles Times in a 1986 interview. "In the next century, 
maybe everyone will be like us." 
</P>
<P>
Figueres despised dictators, but when opponents of Nicaragua's Gen. Anastasio 
Somoza seized a plane in San Jose in 1971, the 5-foot-3 Figueres stood on the 
runway and pointed a submachine gun at the cabin until the hijackers 
surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
He claimed that he almost ruined a 1973 Central American summit when he twitted 
five army generals: "Isn't it odd that all you bastards are generals, and I'm 
the only civilian, but I'm only one who's ever fought a war?" 
</P>
<P>
Educated in the United States, Figueres continued to admire Americans and 
boasted of working with the CIA in the 1950s. But at the same time, he 
lambasted U.S. policy against neighboring Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista 
government, which was ousted in free elections last February. 
</P>
<P>
Among his most controversial decisions was when he chose to harbor Robert 
Vesco, the fugitive U.S. financier. He made it clear, however, that he would 
not hesitate to extradite Vesco if the United States requested it. Vesco fled 
Costa Rica in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Jose (Pepe) Figueres Ferrer was born in 1908, the son of a Spanish immigrant 
doctor and his wife. He was sent to the United States as a youth to study 
engineering at MIT in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Figueres became a successful coffee grower and rope manufacturer, employing 
more than 1,000 sharecroppers and factory laborers. Describing himself as a 
"farmer-socialist," he built housing and provided medical care and recreation 
for his workers and established a community vegetable farm and a dairy with 
free milk for workers' children. 
</P>
<P>
His sharecroppers could either sell hemp grown on his plantation to him at 
market price for use in his rope factory, or sell it elsewhere if they were 
offered a better price. 
</P>
<P>
Figueres spent two years in exile in Mexico after he criticized the regime of 
Rafael Angel Calderon Guardia on a radio broadcast in 1942, claiming that the 
right-wing president was collaborating with Communists. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to Costa Rica when Licenciado Teodore Picado Michalski became 
president, but launched the revolution along with other landowners and student 
agitators when that regime invalidated the March 1, 1948, presidential 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Married and divorced twice from American women, Figueres was the father of five 
children.
