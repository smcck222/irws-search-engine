Sometimes our government seems to be unable to recognize the moral side of an 
argument even when it is delivered from a burning bush. The FBI has been on the 
wrong side of too many major American causes -- from the labor movement to 
protecting the country's environment. 
</P>
<P>
The agency is too often an overpaid goon squad for big business and corrupt 
government. A primary FBI responsibility seems to be the protection of the 
financial interests of the nation's powerful and rich. It has a long history of 
wasting its resources on attacks on social dissidents such as Carl Sandburg, 
John Steinbeck, Vietnam War protesters, Lenny Bruce, civil rights workers, 
Martin Luther King, Amnesty International, Paul Newman, South American refugee 
shelters, and environmental groups and representatives, including Dave Foreman. 
This kind of activity is an embarrassment and an insult to the nation and to 
the competent and dedicated FBI employees who risk their lives fighting 
organized crime, terrorism, sophisticated white-collar crime and government 
corruption. I wish a few of those heroes were in the FBI's upper management.

I read "The FBI vs. the Monkeywrenchers" and was impressed, as usual, with your 
excellent journalism. We can't help but admire people who will lay their life 
on the line, trying, usually in vain, to save what the government allows to be 
systematically destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
It left me wondering, what did this investigation cost me as a taxpayer? 
Instead of wasting our tax dollars defending what we all know is wrong, they 
should consider hiring Dave Foreman as a consultant. He has, as all of us on 
this overpopulated planet, legitimate fear about its fate. 
</P>
<P>
I think it is about time our government finally listens, and becomes our 
leader, to make the changes to save our air, water and resources. If they do 
not listen, eventually there will only be the silence of the "End of Nature."

In "The Monkeywrenchers," I came across the sentence: "Thanks in part to the 
Reagan Administration's anti-environmentalist policies . . . " It was laying 
there like undisputed fact. 
</P>
<P>
This was supposed to be a truthful, accurate story. What is here is opinion. 
Opinion needs to be on the Opinion Page, or at least so noted. It is a shame 
that what could otherwise be a great newspaper stoops to blending its politics 
with the news.

The violent anti-slavery protests of John Brown before the Civil War, the 
women's rights protests at the turn of the century, the civil disobedience of 
segregation laws in the 1960s -- I think Earth First! protests can be added to 
that list. Their activities, while extreme, have at least made progress to halt 
the sellout of our resources to big business for an extra buck. 
</P>
<P>
When ecological legislation is unenforced or not effective, something else must 
be done. 
</P>
<P>
Our government is supposed to be of the people, not of the companies , and our 
natural resources are supposed to be protected for the people, not sold to 
private companies for exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
It's sad that the government's reaction is to hound these people instead of 
joining the fight to reclaim our planet. This is not eco-sabotage for the sake 
of publicity -- this is a fight for survival. I'll take the Monkeywrenchers and 
their tree spiking any day in preference to one more oil spill or one more pile 
of nuclear-power-plant waste.

MAN BITES TOWN: OUT OF THE WATER CLOSET FROM THE OUTHOUSE TO THE GALLERY, 
BATHROOM FIXTURES ARE NOW WORKS OF ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
AMONG THE ADJECTIVES least often used by my friends to describe me are "tidy" 
and "fastidious." I share this with you not in any spirit of ugly 
self-revelation but merely to acknowledge that what follows is not intended as 
a critique of anyone else's lifestyle. The pot, having called itself black, 
moves on. 
</P>
<P>
I had a chance recently to get a fresh perspective on an aspect of modern life 
that, if we're lucky and our personal plumbing doesn't obsess us, escapes much 
notice. In a Westside community filled with galleries, tucked away among the 
art spaces is a gallery of another sort, a continuing exhibition of what can 
only be called world-class bathroom fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
To walk through this wonderland of golden faucets, onyx bathtubs and commodes 
whose seats are more commodious than most couches is to understand how close 
the bathroom is to the American soul. 
</P>
<P>
A good number of us, after all, still rate the foreign places we visit on the 
basis of how closely their toilet paper resembles our own. And yet, many of us 
are no more than a generation away from an outhouse. Some of us are only a 
phone call away. So the grandeur of the fixtures, the incredible luxuries one 
can lavish upon oneself while taking care of personal business may be the most 
poignant way of telling ourselves how far we have truly come. 
</P>
<P>
It may also be a way of erecting a wall of marble against the possibility of 
slipping back. 
</P>
<P>
When you see this stuff one bathroom at a time, the idea of water pouring out 
of a silver eagle's mouth into a basin rimmed with Broadway marquee lights can 
seem at least marginally sensible. There is a hotel in Washington, D.C., for 
example, in which CBS occasionally puts me up for a night, where the bellperson 
always reassures the visitor that he has made the proper choice of 
accommodations: "You know, sir, we have the best bathrooms in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
And I can say, without having conducted a scientific survey of the porcelain 
palaces of our nation's capital, that it could be true. A shower stall built 
for two; a tub long enough for Manute Bol to stretch out in; a phone beside the 
toilet, which has been thoughtfully tucked away in a separate chamber, and 
enough marble to choke a bank lobby. 
</P>
<P>
As a visitor to Washington, you can somehow convince yourself that all this is 
desirable and appropriate. After all, emissaries from a variety of foreign 
lands might be staying here, and they are sophisticated enough that it takes 
more than whisper-soft toilet paper to impress them. 
</P>
<P>
But when you see hundreds of elaborate objets de bain lovingly displayed 
together in a showroom, like art pieces, you get the idea that we are building 
monumental shrines to our most basic needs. Parents should be taking their 
2-year-olds to gaze at such a collection, promising, "If you learn potty well, 
one day some of this will be yours." 
</P>
<P>
For here is the Plaza Toilet (shown in bone), the Pompei Lav sink, the Galleria 
Pedestal sink, the faucet handles with faux granite rings, the Windsor faucet 
in satin gold (the handles look like gilded capitol domes, gold tassels flying 
off the tops) and the Georgia sink in raspberry puree. 
</P>
<P>
I've always thought people who named stuff had the great jobs of the world. 
Someone gives wallpaper, carpeting, shoes, towels and sheets the fanciful 
nomenclature that summons up images of the Riviera, or the South Seas, or the 
heavens. But the folks who are paid to name the shapes and shades of sinks and 
toilets must be laughing all the way to the cash machine. 
</P>
<P>
Showrooms such as the one I roamed through don't raise to absurd heights the 
bathroom alone. The kitchen is widely predicted, by those wide predictors I've 
admired earlier in this space, to be the most important room of the '90s home, 
and so kitchen design is running similarly amok. But kitchens have a 
professional standard against which their equipment and decor can be measured 
and to which they can aspire. In the salles de bains, all bets are off; there, 
we are all professionals, and, sadly, we are all amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
The ultrafine fixtures seem part of an elaborate spectacle to convince someone 
(ourselves? our visitors? our cleaning personnel?) that something grand and 
magnificent and imperial goes on in the bathroom. Somebody else is spending all 
his time in there flossing and peering at hairlines and poking at pimples and 
performing similarly grubby but necessary tasks. 
</P>
<P>
The hauteur of certain outposts of the individual waste-disposal business is 
especially piquant in light of the squalor that attends our communal attempts 
to do the same job. Our landfills, full to bursting, are not lined in marble. 
Our storm drains, dumping old motor oil into the ocean, do not boast golden 
gratings. Old Styrofoam, our gift to the ages, is not gift-wrapped in raspberry 
puree. 
</P>
<P>
But, one bathroom at a time, we are making this planet a more exalted place to 
be. Hey, I'll see you at the Plaza. Toilet, that is.

THERE ARE CERTAIN TIMES in your life when you don't want to reveal very much 
about yourself, and minimal looks reveal very little," says interior designer 
Van-Martin Rowe. Tired of the white walls, gray carpets and uncluttered coffee 
tables of minimalist decorating, Rowe began about two years ago to embrace a 
style -- based on collecting assorted objects and furniture -- that he calls "a 
richer environment." 
</P>
<P>
To wit, wherever Rowe goes, he shops. He's returned to his Hollywood home 
carrying suitcases packed with Guatemalan fabrics, New England folk art, 
European crystal and a shell-covered picture frame from Maui. But Rowe's 
favorite hunting grounds are antique and junk stores closer to home. "Southern 
California is wonderful because people have moved here from the Midwest, 
Europe, Latin America," he says. "You never know what you'll find." 
</P>
<P>
Rowe's best example of decorating with "found objects" is his own living room. 
There, illuminated by multicolored windows, a '50s beatnik doll dances on an 
end table, and '20s rattan sofa and chairs evoke the sense of homeyness he felt 
when he turned 40. "People are attracted to objects because they speak of past 
lives and experiences," he says. "When you start collecting, the most 
insignificant things -- bottle caps, matchbooks -- take on importance. But 
because collecting isn't exactly socially approved -- it's not like hanging a 
Monet, after all -- it takes a certain amount of self-assurance to show what 
you've got."

WHEN DISCUSSING summer wardrobes, designers in Milan, Paris, New York and 
Southern California agree: Keep the underpinnings basic (a unitard will do), 
and make the jacket exciting. 
</P>
<P>
Whether chartreuse, orange, chrome yellow or warm white, today's jackets are 
colorful. 
</P>
<P>
They're also roomy and relaxed but not sloppy. Armani shows long, 
East-Indian-inspired, tissue-weight jackets, while Chanel's are shorter and 
gently shaped. Donna Karan has designed sleek, fluid styles, and those by 
California designers range from short and boxy to long and lean. 
</P>
<P>
Detailing is important: Waists may be nipped in with belts, shirring and curvy 
seaming; buttons are often decorative, and collar and pocket treatments create 
subtle novelty touches. 
</P>
<P>
This jacket wardrobe is exceptional in every way except price -- each jacket is 
under $300.

LOOKS: GROWING PAINS; 
</P>
<P>
CAREFUL STYLING CAN HELP EASE THE TRANSITION FROM SHORT HAIR TO LONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
WHEN HEMLINE fads shift from thigh to knee to ankle, the simple secret to 
looking fashionable is having three black skirts, one in each length. But when 
hair trends drop from ear-skimming crops to longer, softer styles -- which is 
precisely what's happening now -- there's no easy way to stay in fashion. 
</P>
<P>
The short, little-boy cuts of last year are beginning to look tired -- "last 
decade," as fashion folk put it. And the signs of change are everywhere. 
Although some Paris models wore abbreviated cuts at the spring shows, most 
sported longer, wavier and generally more feminine styles. In the latest issues 
of Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, supermodel Linda Evangelista, who started the 
latest short-sheared craze, is wearing her dark brown hair over her ears and 
longer at the crown and in back. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, women with short hair are talking about slightly longer 
haircuts, too. "Especially the trend-setters," says Blase, a hairdresser at 
Beverly Hills' Juan Juan salon. "When they see that everyone is wearing their 
look, they want something newer." 
</P>
<P>
But to go from pixie to pageboy takes time. The average head of hair grows half 
an inch per month, Blase points out, and it should be trimmed at least a 
quarter-inch every five to six weeks. "So if you start from very short right 
now, you can have a nice chin-length style by the holidays," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Hairdresser Allen Edwards, who has six Southern California salons, including 
shops in Beverly Hills, Long Beach and Irvine, agrees that getting a haircut 
every four to five weeks will ease the growing-out process. "There should be a 
new look for each new length," Edwards says. "There is always a hair style that 
will suit a woman's face, no matter how long or short her hair is. She 
shouldn't have to wait for her hair to get longer to look good." 
</P>
<P>
Achieving a one-length style from a layered cut requires frequent trimming of 
the sides and back while the crown and bangs get longer. But the resulting 
blunt, geometric look is probably too sophisticated for today's casual 
fashions. "Rather than have the perimeter of the hair straight, it's newer to 
keep it uneven -- it's much more casual," says Geri Cusenza of Sebastian 
International in Woodland Hills. Cusenza, who is letting her own dark brown 
locks grow out, wears spit curls and wispy bangs but keeps the rest of her hair 
layered to look its thickest. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards also recommends a shaggier transition look with a fringe of bangs, 
calling it more feminine and less severe. Blase perms hair to achieve more 
softness around the face while the hair gets longer, but never before it's 
about four inches long at the crown. "Otherwise, the style will look too round 
on top," he cautions. 
</P>
<P>
But other stylists believe that most clients want their hair to look as long as 
possible as fast as possible. Hairobics Salon owner George Caroll of Toluca 
Lake discourages perms or the use of round styling brushes to curl hair under 
because both tend to make the hair seem shorter. Instead, he teaches clients to 
use a flexible plastic brush he has designed that straightens the hair during 
blow-drying, giving the illusion of longer hair. "But you need to trim the ends 
frequently to keep the hair looking its thickest and neatest," he says. 
</P>
<P>
For women who refuse to spend the time and money for frequent trims or a perm, 
gels and pomades help to tame the hairs that tend to stick out around the ears. 
Cusenza, whose company manufactures styling products, prefers light aerosol 
gels to mousses, which make the hair stiff. "Everything about the new, longer 
styles is light and feminine, and mousses make the styles look too heavy," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Some women deal with the vagaries of hair fashion the same way European runway 
models do: They wear wigs. New synthetic wigs and falls in short, wavy styles 
cost about $150 and provide an instant hairdo. 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, times when even a wig can't satisfy the needs of the most 
impatient woman. But enduring the transition, whether it's weeks or months, 
does have its hidden benefit. It allows a woman to determine which length best 
suits her features. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen women grow hair to their shoulders," says Edwards, "then turn around 
and cut it all off again because they decide they like the way a short style 
frames their face."

Change is always wrenching. To go from a Cold War economy to a peacetime 
economy is job wrenching, and to go from an economy of environmental 
destruction to one of harmony with nature is equally disturbing to those whose 
incomes depend on pollution, radiation or the irresponsible exploitation of our 
natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, most humans want to save our planet. The monkeywrenchers ask the 
telling question: "What are we willing to give up for it?"

It was outstanding that the magazine would publish such an open-minded article 
about Earth First! It is distressing, though, to learn how much effort was put 
into pinning a case on Dave Foreman. I'm sure he was targeted only because he 
is an effective spokesman for a popular cause threatening moneyed interests. I 
hope nearly as much effort is being invested in investigating fraud and 
criminal activity in all the savings-and-loan association failures.

And one day, New York-based designer Paul Haigh decided to create the Thin Edge 
of the Wedge II table "to explore what happens, conceptually, when the legs 
push through the table top." 
</P>
<P>
The Thin Edge table won an award in the prestigious 1989 ID Annual Design 
Review and is now produced by a fledgling Toronto firm, Ottoman Empire. Haigh 
avoided using expensive injection molds or tools and dyes to form the legs. 
Instead, each leg is made by simply folding a length of aluminum (a process 
that strengthens the legs structurally) to produce the table's namesake 
"wedge." 
</P>
<P>
Haigh treats the aluminum top as a "natural" material. "The machine-ground 
finish cleans up the surface," he says. "Aluminum doesn't need a protective 
coating of nickel or chrome, as steel does." Though the grinding process barely 
scratches the aluminum's surface, it yields a rich, deep, light-refracting 
finish like the underside of a CD. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the raw materials, the Thin Edge II table -- one of a series of three 
pieces -- is quite refined looking. The table, which comes in varying sizes and 
shapes (prices range from about $3,500 to $4,500), explores the "cheapskate 
architecture" aesthetic identified with Frank Gehry. In the right hands, as 
Gehry fans know, inexpensive, off-the-shelf industrial materials such as 
corrugated fiberglass, chain-link fence and raw metal can look elegant and 
luxurious. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thin Edge is available at (Di-zin'), 8302 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles; (213) 
651-4400.

THE PRIDE IN A little boy's eyes when he presents a dinosaur he's decorated, or 
a little girl's delight in unveiling a picture she's painted, can't be equaled. 
Now there's a place devoted to such junior extracurricular artistic endeavors 
where children can go to try their creative hand -- literally. 
</P>
<P>
Kids 'N Paint is a great place to visit; and it beats messing up your living 
room. 
</P>
<P>
The budding artists are swathed in smocks, seated at long tables and given 
brushes and paints. Staff members are always on hand to provide pointers and 
help when needed. Kids 'N Paint also sells hundreds of plaster items for 
children to paint -- from magnets to plaster hamburgers, and teddy bears and 
elephants to banks shaped like cars and pigs. (The magnets sell for $1.50; the 
average item, about $6.50.) You can even host a birthday party at Kids 'N Paint 
for a $25 setup and cleanup fee, and a minimum of $5.50 per child.

YOU WON'T FIND Ronald McDonald or any of the other contemporary McDonald's 
characters. But you can look for the oldest remaining original McDonald's sign, 
a 60-footer that promises this is your kind of place. 
</P>
<P>
The McDonald's on Lakewood and Florence avenues in Downey is the only 
independently owned link of the Titanic chain. When it opened in 1953, owners 
Roger Williams and Bud Landon (who still own it today) served a 15-cent 
hamburger; the then-modern equipment could turn out 600 burgers per hour. 
Although the stand was one of the original McDonald's, it was never part of the 
franchise purchased from the McDonald brothers by Ray Kroc. But Landon and 
Williams were granted the right to buy food from McDonald's and to continue to 
use the name. It's outdoor seating only, but you can enjoy the same burgers, 
fries and shakes that are now found all over the world.

MAKING THE OLD NEW

IF THE TERM antique prints conjures up dull images of black-and-white bird 
studies, then you've never paid a visit to Emma-Louise Hayley's gallery. The 
white walls of the gallery are covered from floor to ceiling with beautifully 
framed prints spanning the late-17th to early-20th centuries. 
</P>
<P>
There are early-19th-Century engravings of monkeys ($1,050 each framed), 
eccentric 17th-Century designs for fountains (about $400) and illustrations 
from the "Voyages of Captain Cook" (starting at $495 each). 
</P>
<P>
Hayley, who scours Europe for her pieces, says it's time for people to stop 
associating antique prints with the cluttered look of the Victorian period. "A 
lot of things that are very old can look very modern," she says. "What I'm 
trying to do is create new ways to present (the prints) so that it's possible 
to use them in contemporary interiors."

EXECUTIVES' PUSH FOR FATTER PAYCHECKS IS JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF GREED IN U.S. 
INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The story on executive salaries is one of unadulterated greed. How selfish can 
the rich be? They ought to be ashamed. 
</P>
<P>
Our corporate world is sick. Exorbitantly high salaries, stock options, 
bonuses, leveraged buyouts and greedy pension programs for executives keep 
profits from being distributed to the shareholders. It's time that our 
government step in to curb the excesses. 
</P>
<P>
What a different economy we would have if somehow the shareholders could get 
their fair share of the profits. After all, they furnish the capital to make 
the corporations possible.

ALICE KAHN: NEW, USED DREAMS FOR SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICE KAHN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For us, the dream is over. We sold out and someone from Los Angeles bought it. 
Why not? The property is only a 700-mile drive for the new owner. 
</P>
<P>
According to the lore, anyone living between Guadalajara and Anchorage lives in 
terror of being taken over by Californians, a fact celebrated in bumper 
stickers that say, "Don't Californicate Oregon." Portland and Seattle have 
become hot spots of these real estate ravishment fantasies. But even quiet 
little towns in central and northern California such as San Luis Obispo and 
Mendocino seem worried. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, when the locals speak of the Californians they fear, they are not 
referring to tweedy, ecologically minded, culturally sensitive San Franciscans. 
The nightmare is hordes of muscular blondes in fluorescent bras on 
roller-skates together with tan, hairless-chested surfer boys on bodyboards 
careening down Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
The locals also fear the couple who drive up in front of the 
Victorian-plus-five-acres in their powder-blue Mercedes 450SL. Will the 
visitors get on their cellular phone and say, "One eighty-nine five? Is all 
cash OK?" 
</P>
<P>
The monsters in the Mercedes are the modern Attila: Rich Invading People from 
L.A. RIPLAs are unwanted by everyone. Except the sellers. 
</P>
<P>
Even rumors that rich people from L.A. are in an area can send real estate 
prices higher than a palm tree on a Beverly Hills lawn. Just a whiff of Robin 
Williams in the air sent real estate prices soaring in Gualala, a tiny coastal 
town. Ditto with Sylvester Stallone in a remote part of Maui. If he wanted to, 
Jack Nicholson alone could boost Portland prices 25% overnight. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think Nigel Fingerman is actually rich. All I know about him is that he 
lives in L.A., he has something to do with the music business, he made us an 
offer, and he now owns our dream. 
</P>
<P>
The dream we sold to Nigel was 20 acres of raw land with what is known as a 
"blue water view." That means the Pacific Ocean sits out there like a mirage -- 
too far to walk to, too beautiful to walk away from. You can't really walk 
anywhere because the land is densely forested except for the deer trails and 
the old dirt logging road that leads you to it. There's no water, no power and 
no people. All there is is a place to imagine. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine a cabin here. Imagine if we find a spring there. Imagine a little 
garden here. Imagine a play structure there. 
</P>
<P>
When we bought the land 10 years ago, our dream was this: We would go up every 
weekend despite many hours driving on the twisted coastal highway with a 
carsickness-prone child. ("Prone" here means you pull over in terror every time 
she coughs.) We would improve the land but still keep its natural character. 
(Ha! How little we understood nature's imperative to maintain her own overgrown 
self.) Eventually we would retire there and live like Ma and Pa Hippie Kettle, 
sleeping by moon, cooking by wood, taking only what we needed, back to the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, one still had these pre-Reagan visions. 
</P>
<P>
My husband and I forgot one thing: We were city people. Our parents had 
struggled to get away from the land they came from and get to the city, where 
they could earn a living and buy some luxuries like a refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
One other problem: We had no skills and no tools (except the checkbook). And we 
had no time to acquire them. We hardly had time to drive up there. We were too 
busy working the jobs that allowed us to indulge in a 20-acre dream. 
</P>
<P>
As dreams go, it wasn't all that expensive. Less than a time-share. Way less 
than a house -- even in Portland. Less than even the cheapest Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
So, we got a little trailer up there and kept it stocked with all the 
necessities -- dishes, diapers, fresh roast coffee. For a few years, we went up 
maybe 10 times a summer. Then the kids got bigger and work got more hectic and 
we had what is known as "scheduling problems." 
</P>
<P>
Nature soon let us know that unless we planned to stay there and fight her, she 
would reclaim the land. We would have to regrade the dirt road. We'd have to 
evict the critters in the trailer. We'd have to keep clearing the trails we had 
cleared. We'd have to cut trees to keep the view. Someone suggested we get us 
some marijuana sharecroppers to maintain the land. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, we sold to Nigel Fingerman of Los Angeles, making no money on the 
deal. If we had put the money in a passbook account at a crumbling S&amp;L, 
we'd have done better. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, I'm not even sure why we sold it. I think we just felt like jerks as we 
realized how far our fantasy was from reality. 
</P>
<P>
The day after we signed the paper giving Nigel Fingerman permission to act out 
on our dreamscape, all the newspapers reported that a movie star had bought a 
house down the road and real estate prices in the area were expected to jump. 
Did Nigel know something from the old L.A. Dudes Network or was it just our bad 
luck? 
</P>
<P>
When we bought the land in 1980 with our earnest chunk of cash and our 
infatuation with redwoods/ocean/sun, the agent said in all candor, "I sell new 
and used dreams." 
</P>
<P>
Ours is used up now, and the land is more natural than we found it. This land 
was our land, this land is Fingerman's land -- until the next used-dream sale. 
</P>
<P>
All I'm saying is that if you're in the north woods and see a guy in Ray-Bans 
and a Lakers T-shirt gathering twigs and carrying a bucket of water, give that 
ugly Californian his chance.

ROGER SIMON: WORDS TO THE CLASS OF '90: 'DARE MIGHTY THINGS'

What I Would Have Told Those Wellesley Graduates If They Had Invited Me to 
Their Commencement Instead of Barbara Bush: 
</P>
<P>
It is tempting to tell the graduates gathered here today that you are now 
embarking on the best years of your lives. 
</P>
<P>
It is tempting, but it would be a lie. 
</P>
<P>
The best years of your lives are over. I hope you enjoyed them. It is downhill 
from here. These last 22 years have been a free ride for most of you: You've 
gotten free food, free rent and free clothing. Now it is time to pay up. And 
pay up you will. 
</P>
<P>
Your first big problem is that you were born one generation too late. 
</P>
<P>
You probably expect to have a life better than your parents had. But you won't. 
In fact, you will have to pay for all your parents' mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
I won't bore you with the details, but just for starters you are going to have 
to pay off the savings and loan crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The total is anybody's guess, but current estimates say it is going to cost 
more than World War II. I am not kidding. 
</P>
<P>
Your parents' generation could pay for it themselves, but, frankly, they'd 
rather not. Instead of raising their own taxes, they'd rather borrow the money 
and have your generation pay off the debt. 
</P>
<P>
When I graduated from college in 1970, my generation had the feeling that a 
seismic shift in American life was going on and, young as we were, we were 
ready to take power. 
</P>
<P>
I hope none of you feels that way today, because it's not going to happen. Your 
parents are baby boomers, now in their 40s. This means they will rule America 
at least for the next 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
They will not only hold the top political jobs and head the major corporations, 
but they will also make up a huge voting bloc in their retirement. 
</P>
<P>
And they are going to stick it to you. One obvious example is Social Security: 
You will have to work very long and very hard to pay the Social Security 
benefits that your parents will receive. 
</P>
<P>
Consider it a bill for the last 22 years of pizzas. 
</P>
<P>
And don't expect your parents to be eager to turn the country over to you when 
your turn comes. This is another change in American life. For the first time, 
parents feel they are better educated than their children. 
</P>
<P>
Ridiculous? Last year, a Gallup survey found that 25% of all college students 
did not know in what year Columbus discovered America; 23% confused the 
Communist Manifesto with the U.S. Constitution; 58% did not know Plato wrote 
"The Republic" and less than half knew what the Magna Carta was. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is not difficult to discern: About 38% of all colleges allow 
students to graduate without taking a single history course and 45% require no 
American or English literature. 
</P>
<P>
A few days after the survey results were announced, I received a letter from a 
student at the Baltimore campus of the University of Maryland. "First of all," 
she wrote, "as we are not required to take basic courses of history and 
literature, why should we study something that we really don't enjoy or feel we 
will never use in the future?" 
</P>
<P>
Why indeed? Why do anything not required and possibly not enjoyable? 
</P>
<P>
Why, even for a moment in a four-year experience, should you do something even 
slightly daring? Why take a risk and do something that might be "useful" in 
ways you never dreamed? 
</P>
<P>
Why be more than mediocre when mediocrity is all that life demands of you? 
</P>
<P>
Mediocrity will get you through. It always has. It got you through high school 
and through college and, let me assure you, it will get you through the job 
market. 
</P>
<P>
In a few days, I will speak to a journalism class at George Washington 
University (unless they dump me for Barbara Bush). 
</P>
<P>
I will tell the students what I always tell them: They need not be more than 
mediocre to get a job on a newspaper in America today. 
</P>
<P>
Then I will also tell them that if they choose to be more than mediocre, 
however, the rewards can be enormous. They can learn great things and do great 
things and be as a shining star in the heavens. 
</P>
<P>
They will laugh when I say this. They always do. But I will tell them they can 
live today in the same spirit as the American pioneers lived: They can push 
forward into the wilderness and into the unknown. They need not play it safe. 
They need not be mediocre. 
</P>
<P>
All commencement speeches have to quote somebody. So I will quote Theodore 
Roosevelt. He was once a President of the United States. Reading about him may 
no longer be required: 
</P>
<P>
"Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though 
checkered by failure, than to take rank with those poor spirits who neither 
enjoy much nor suffer much because they live in the gray twilight that knows 
not victory or defeat." 
</P>
<P>
You graduates can go forth from this day to live in the gray twilight. Many of 
you will. And for those who do, I have but one piece of advice: Learn to speak 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
But some of you will strive to solve our nation's problems in bold and creative 
ways, to do better than your parents did, to show the world the promise that is 
still America. 
</P>
<P>
I can give you no guarantee of success. 
</P>
<P>
You will have only the vast satisfaction of having dared a mighty thing. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you. 
</P>
<P>
Now, can anyone validate my parking?

ZAN THOMPSON: OLD TIMES AT HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I spent a day and a night at Huntington Memorial Hospital last week for some 
tests and I saw a lot of friends on the professional staff. 
</P>
<P>
Coming back to Huntington Memorial is like a class reunion. I have spent a good 
deal of time with these people in the last two years what with my various 
malfunctions. Maureen in the admitting office is a friend and managed to get me 
in my old room, a large one at the end of the corridor with two upholstered 
chairs centered by a lamp table and a bathroom with a large bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital lore has it that it's the room where Bing Crosby once stayed. 
</P>
<P>
People become attached to the areas where they have had a pleasant time under 
sometimes difficult circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
When I sailed down the corridor to No. 3500 in my wheelchair, I whooped with 
delight at each nurse I recognized. It's a comforting feeling to know that the 
same nurses who have taken care of me before are still there -- careful, 
professional, knowledgeable, pleasant, funny. 
</P>
<P>
Most people, except the very brave or the very unknowing, are afraid in 
hospitals and the staff people who greet the patient with a smile and a 
pleasant word are magic workers. Good nurses are surely given a course in 
making the patient feel like an instant friend instead of one more added 
annoyance in the doctor's day. 
</P>
<P>
A hospital is like a self-contained city. News or tasty gossip makes the tour 
of the hospital corridors like a well-aimed laser beam. Within three minutes, 
according to carefully monitored tests, a bit of news can start at the front 
door and hit the back, not missing an alcove nor a storage closet. 
</P>
<P>
My friends' lives have been making rewarding advances in the two years since I 
have been there. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Knight, one of the marvelous nurses on 35, went this year to see her 
parents in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. 
</P>
<P>
A nurse named Vicki Young has a 2-year-old named Deanna who is old enough to 
have doll tea parties and offer cookies to the doll guests. Last time I saw 
Vicki, she was working on her museum-quality collection of miniature furnished 
rooms. "I don't have time for them now, with Deanna. I'm too busy going to doll 
tea parties," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Leon, one of my special friends, has a husband who is a pharmacist and a 
new baby named Michelle. 
</P>
<P>
Marsia McAtee and her husband have a son named Ryan and a new one name Cinjon. 
Marsia coined the name because she liked its sound and now she has been told by 
an American Indian friend that it is a well-respected name among his tribe. 
Marsia has an Aztec heritage and the second son has red hair. She learned that 
Cinjon means rising sun -- a fortuitous name. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Newton and Ruth Wong were on 35 and delights to see. Diane is a Mount St. 
Mary's nursing school graduate. My friend Joan Morelli who is normally in 
charge on 35 is a marvelous friend and great executive. One time she put a note 
on my door after a surgery that said, "No visitors. Zan can't say no, but I 
can." 
</P>
<P>
One night a few years ago, when a wild, wind-whipped rain was lashing the 
window of my room, a large, burly man came in and brought me apple juice and 
graham crackers. He told me that he was descended from Irish brigands. He is a 
wonderful nurse named Keith Mooney. 
</P>
<P>
On this last brief visit, I was prowling the halls before the 7 a.m. shift 
change and Keith said, "Do you want some coffee?" 
</P>
<P>
Of course I did. Keith knew why I was wandering the halls, a waif looking for 
an eye-opening cup. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure that the other floors in the hospital are filled with friendly, 
professional people but these are my own. And I'll bet that nowhere else is 
there a young woman from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and an Irish brigand who will 
slip you a cup of coffee before the official start of a new day.

NEWS AND BRIEFS: TALL SHIPS TO GATHER FOR 'SAIL AMSTERDAM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four million visitors are expected in Amsterdam in August to take part in "Sail 
Amsterdam," the world's largest gathering of tall ships. 
</P>
<P>
The event, held every five years, takes place Aug. 9-14 and will feature more 
than 1,000 sailing vessels from around the world. Not all of them, naturally, 
are tall ships. 
</P>
<P>
The weeklong program begins with a "Parade of Sail" on Aug. 9 through the North 
Sea canal. The parade will be led by a replica of an 18th-Century East 
Indiaman. 
</P>
<P>
A tall ships race, meanwhile, starts in Plymouth, England, and will go via Le 
Coruna, Spain; Bordeaux, France, and Zeebrugge, the Netherlands, to Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors will be allowed on board the ships during their stay in IJ Harbor, and 
the celebration also includes a flower parade on water, concerts and fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Quick Fact: Papiamento is neither a new kind of stuffed olive nor the latest 
hit song from Italy. It is, in fact, the native language of the Caribbean 
islands of Aruba and Curacao. 
</P>
<P>
Fast Cats: High-speed catamaran ferry service between England and France begins 
this month between Portsmouth and Cherbourg. The twin-hulled Christopher 
Columbus will be operated by Hoverspeed and will cut the crossing time in half. 
</P>
<P>
The ferry will be able to carry 450 passengers and 80 vehicles and will travel 
at up to 40 knots. Current trips take nearly five hours on the 
Portsmouth-Cherbourg route, but the new craft is capable of making the crossing 
in less than three hours. 
</P>
<P>
Forwarding Address: The Haiti National Office of Tourism has moved. It is now 
at 18 East 41st St., New York 10017. 
</P>
<P>
Rio Very Grande: In an effort to bolster tourism along its border with the 
United States, Mexico has unveiled plans to build a $50-million resort by Lake 
Amistad near Ciudad Acuna on the Rio Grande. 
</P>
<P>
The project, which could take up to 20 years to complete, will create a posh 
resort out of barren cactus land along the river's jagged cliffs and the waters 
of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
Officials envision a resort the size of Cancun, rivaling it in popularity. 
</P>
<P>
The area now gets just a scattering of American tourists, mostly those who 
cross the river for a few hours from the Texas city of Del Rio to shop or spend 
an evening in the bars and restaurants of neighboring Ciudad Acuna. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials figure they have 7.8 million potential tourists to draw 
from in Texas alone. By 1994 they hope to have completed two hotels, two 
restaurants, a swimming pool, an 800-acre nature preserve, renovation of a 
tornado-damaged marina and a cliff-diving attraction similar to the one in 
Acapulco. 
</P>
<P>
Quick Fact: According to Mexican tourism officials, 20 years ago, 61% of all 
visitors to the country arrived by land. Now that land figure is 35%. 
</P>
<P>
The Road Goes On and On: One of the world's great motoring events begins July 
13 when 60 cars set off from Hyde Park in London to drive to New York. 
</P>
<P>
No, these are not aquamobiles, they're real cars going the long way around -- 
via Europe, the Soviet Union, Alaska, Canada and some of the Lower 48 states. 
The 64-day journey is supposed to end in New York Sept. 14 after covering 
12,700 land miles, plus a little sea between Naukan in the Soviet Union and 
Seward, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
The event isn't for everyone. The cost alone is enough to bring one to a fast 
stop: $27,900 for a car and driver and another $13,950 for a passenger. 
</P>
<P>
Billed as the London to New York Motor Challenge, the drive is being organized 
by Voyages Jules Verne, a London company specializing in exotic travel. 
</P>
<P>
Quick Fact: The number of tourists visiting Israel in 1989 has increased over 
1988, according to that nation's tourism ministry. Figures disclosed 1.425 
million people visited Israel last year, up from 1.299 million the year before, 
and an increase of 9.7%. 
</P>
<P>
No Stone Unturned: It hasn't taken long for free enterprise and the chance of a 
quick deutsch mark to penetrate East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Word is that an advertising entrepreneur has secured the rights to a 
13-foot-high, 3,300-foot-long section of the Berlin Wall from a local council 
and plans to turn it into a permanent billboard. 
</P>
<P>
The man, Andreas Dademasch, told Neues Deutschland, an East Berlin daily: 
"We'll clean and look after it (the Wall) because we think something of it 
should remain as a kind of cultural monument. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Wait for it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
" . . . And we want to market it for advertising."

THIS FORM OF ORIENT EXPRESS DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE

TAIPEI, Taiwan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
English is chic in the Orient. No, I don't mean spoken English, but rather the 
written language. And no, I don't mean that it is fashionable to write English. 
It is fashionable to wear English. 
</P>
<P>
And, at least in Taiwan, written English is not wearing too well. 
</P>
<P>
Consider these words, recently seen on the back of a handsome athletic jacket 
worn by a nice-looking college kid on the streets of Taiwan's capital city: 
</P>
<P>
"Replay Pleasant Forever Immortal." 
</P>
<P>
This was not, as far as I could determine, the name of the student's 
university. Nor was it the utterance of some mad expatriate avant-garde 
American poet. 
</P>
<P>
It was, apparently, four words strung together willy-nilly by the Japanese 
manufacturer of the jacket, apparently for no other purpose than to be 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
And it would seem that this goal has been accomplished. Indeed, English words 
stitched on Japanese-imported clothes are as chic a fashion in Taiwan as 
partially shaved-head sculpture is in the West. 
</P>
<P>
An innocent enough enterprise, you say? So what if the words don't make sense? 
Most of the wearers won't realize it anyway, right? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, as far as non-English-speaking people are concerned. But what of the 
effect of such nonsequiturs on those burdened with full comprehension of this 
widely spoken Western tongue? 
</P>
<P>
This important consideration is something that the Japanese clothing designers 
callously neglected to take into account. 
</P>
<P>
There I was, wandering the streets with my Chinese friends, trying to enjoy the 
marvelous trappings of Chinese culture -- the dizzyingly colorful street 
operas, street hawkers, fantastic temples and stupendous bustle -- when all the 
while I was confronted with the most abstract and indecipherable amalgamations 
of English I have seen since James Joyce. 
</P>
<P>
And there was no avoiding them. English words on the Chinese-character-choked 
streets of Taipei stand out like chopsticks in a Denny's restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this one, seen on the back of a sweatshirt worn by a very happy, 
innocent-looking teen-aged girl who was worshipping in the rustic environs of 
the ancient Lung Shan Temple: 
</P>
<P>
 "60's American Nice Dreaming With Or Without Somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 I tried to understand it. I couldn't help it, it's my nature. Put English 
words in front of me, and I automatically try to make sense of them. (It 
doesn't always work -- like when I try to read William F. Buckley.) 
</P>
<P>
This random phrase was on the back of a little girl licking a delicately 
swirled ice cream cone: 
</P>
<P>
"After a while you get to like so much about the tiger." 
</P>
<P>
True enough, I muttered to myself. A fine, beautiful, endangered animal. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was this possibly related thought, printed in blood-red letters on 
the front of a sweatshirt worn by a man buying a large orange fish at a street 
market: 
</P>
<P>
"Kitten: Not everybody can have it, but it is delicious." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the words seemed to have been lifted straight out of novels -- pulp 
romances for teenagers, perhaps. I had an image of a burned-out Japanese 
seamstress leafing through a book by Danielle Steele and stitching up this 
passage: 
</P>
<P>
"She trembled excitedly in anticipation at the thought of seeing him again." 
</P>
<P>
(This appeared, provocatively enough, on the back of a navy-blue jogging suit 
inhabited by a middle-aged businessman.) 
</P>
<P>
Possibly the most wondrous display of all appeared on the front of a coat 
hanging on a rack in a place called "F.M. Station," an expensive emporium 
catering to collegiate tastes in the heart of Taipei. 
</P>
<P>
It contained the images of three smiling, dancing, mustachioed eggs (their 
names: "Mr. Daniel," "Mr. Mauche," "Mr. Kelvin"), along with the words "Drober 
Beating Egg Custom Grant Origin Factor." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, this type of thing is hardly confined to Asian countries. After all, 
people from all over the world do the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Status-conscious denizens of Los Angeles wear fancy T-shirts with the names of 
French ski resorts and German automobiles that they no doubt have difficulty 
translating and pronouncing. 
</P>
<P>
Europeans buy American clothing that says things like "No Problem!" and "Gag Me 
With a Spoon!" and less, um, intelligible sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
And then there was that Los Angeles trend a few years ago toward wearing torn 
T-shirts with Chinese characters printed on them. In particular, I recall a 
woman exiting a Mercedes-Benz on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills wearing the 
character for "pig." True story. 
</P>
<P>
But I'm a journalist, and I must report what I see. 
</P>
<P>
During my 10-day stay in Taiwan, I was advised: 
</P>
<P>
sg 
</P>
<P>
"Are you fed up? Now change!" 
</P>
<P>
(Good suggestion!) 
</P>
<P>
I was notified that "We are deeply proud but for what it can and throughout the 
effort of us all someday will be." (A Dan Quayle speech excerpt?) I was also 
asked to "Sparkle for those who are sports maniac!" 
</P>
<P>
I dined next to two young fellows whose jackets proclaimed them "Oriental 
Racer, The Hero or Heroes," and a pot-bellied gentleman whose shirt stunningly 
identified him as "Peytonplaceforeman." Another similar item of attire invoked 
the first line of John Lennon's poignant song for his departed mother, "Julia," 
which goes: "Half of what I say is meaningless." 
</P>
<P>
I was inclining toward thinking that this particular phrase was unwittingly 
apropro when I noticed above it, quite inexplicably, the words "Sissy Boy." 
</P>
<P>
Oh, and I ran into "The Most Exciting Hot-Shot Fighter" a couple of times, as 
well as a representative of the "No-Mark-World," whose wrap informed me "I 
individual go my own way that's why I wear no mark." (Me, too!) 
</P>
<P>
And I should not omit that I observed several people whose clothing suggested 
that they advocated "Individual Decency -- Autumn &amp; Winter." (So be warned 
-- stay away from these folks in spring and summer.) 
</P>
<P>
I would be remiss if I did not report that possibly the most important message 
that I saw during my Taiwan trip was the following phrase, worn by a 
tough-looking middle-aged woman buying a large hunk of pork at an outdoor 
market: 
</P>
<P>
"The Solution To The Professional Football Enigma." 
</P>
<P>
I knew there had to be one somewhere.

HOW TO VISIT DENMARK'S FANTASYLAND

<P>
Getting there: The most expedient service to Copenhagen currently offered is on 
Continental and SAS via Newark, and on TWA via New York City. All three 
airlines are offering a round-trip fare of about $880. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets must be purchased 21 days in advance, departure must be Monday through 
Thursday and visits must be for at least a week, but no longer than three 
months. SAS and TWA also are quoting a 30-day advance-purchase, round-trip fare 
of about $730. 
</P>
<P>
SAS also flies nonstop between Los Angeles and Copenhagen for $984 coach until 
Aug. 15, when the fare drops to $878. Departure is Monday through Thursday at 
5:30 p.m. from Los Angeles International Airport. Coach flights Friday through 
Sunday are $1,034, and drop to $928 after Aug. 15. For more information and 
reservations, call toll-free (800) 221-2350. Once in Copenhagen, Billund is 
reachable by air, car or train-bus. 
</P>
<P>
By air, an SAS-affiliated carrier, Danair, offers four or five flights daily 
from Copenhagen. 
</P>
<P>
By car, take Route E4 south from Copenhagen to Koge, then Route E66 west 
(including a ferry from Halsskov or Korsor to Nyborg) to Route 170 -- near 
Kolding -- and Route 170 north to Velje. 
</P>
<P>
At Velje, take Route 28 west to Billund. The trip takes about five hours by 
car, but the Danish countryside is somewhat reminiscent of Maryland's Eastern 
shore. Traversing it is pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
One word of warning: Make an advance reservation for your car on the ferry 
between Halsskov and Nyborg; failure to do so could result in a long wait in a 
long line on E66. 
</P>
<P>
By train, travel from Copenhagen's central station to Velje, where 
well-coordinated bus connections to Billund are available. The train-bus trip 
takes about 5 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Park information: Legoland is open 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily from late April 
until mid-September. Admission tickets, which allow access to most of the 
miniature exhibits but not to the rides and some special attractions, are about 
$6.50 for adults and $3.25 for children. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, an eight-ticket card good for rides and special attractions can be 
purchased for about $7.50 per person, regardless of age. Group rates are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
There are several eating establishments in Legoland, from restaurants with 
full-course Danish meals to snack bars. A good meal for four costs $25 to $55. 
</P>
<P>
Lego products, including many not available in the United States, are available 
at an outlet store on the grounds. Prices run about the same as they do here, 
thanks mostly to Denmark's 22% value-added tax. 
</P>
<P>
Foreigners spending more than 600 Danish kroner (about $90 U.S.) on goods to be 
taken out of Denmark are entitled to a refund of the VAT. Ask a store attendant 
for the proper forms and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Where to stay: There are at least five hotels in Billund proper: Hotel 
Gasterhof, Billund Kro, Hotel Propellen, Hotel Vis-a-Vis and Motel Svanen. 
Rates from $60 to $100 per person, double occupancy, with private shower and 
toilet. Most include a Danish breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
The Vis-a-Vis, which is the most expensive of the five, is adjacent to 
Legoland. The others are within long walking distance of the park. There are at 
least two campgrounds nearby, one in Billund proper, a short walk from the 
park, and one in Vorbasse, about nine miles to the south. 
</P>
<P>
For more information: Contact Legoland Park, DK-7190, Billund, Denmark; Billund 
Turisbureau, DK-7190, Billund, Denmark, and Scandinavian National Tourist 
Offices, 655 3rd Ave., 18th Floor, New York 10017, (212) 949-2333. BILL O'BRIAN

BRUSSELS IS A CITY NOT TO BE IGNORED 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A savage rain squall had descended suddenly, sweeping the Grand Place, the 
city's playfully elegant town center, clear of sightseers, ourselves among 
them. 
</P>
<P>
What better excuse for a long and lazy lunch? This, our first morning in 
Brussels, should be the day to try what all the Belgian guidebooks say is a 
staple of the local diet: beer, mussels and frites. 
</P>
<P>
I don't want to diminish the importance of Brussels's historic attractions, 
which are splendid, but the Belgian capital is a city where food really should 
dominate your daily itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
One of the "favorite leisure pursuits" of the Belgians, advised the Sabena 
magazine in my airline seat pocket, "is eating." Sabena is the Belgian national 
airline. I was about to do as the Belgians do. 
</P>
<P>
The quality of food, I found, compares quite favorably to that in Paris, and 
generally (though not always) without Paris' high prices. Entire streets in 
some neighborhoods are devoted to nothing but cafes, restaurants and ice cream 
shops. 
</P>
<P>
It was down one of those streets that we headed, the Petite Rue des Bouchers, a 
narrow pedestrian passageway running off the Grand Place. It is one of Europe's 
most unusual streets, lined the entire length of the block with one inviting 
restaurant after another, offering complete fixed-priced dinner menus for $15 
to $25. 
</P>
<P>
The rain poured heavily, but we were sheltered by canopies opened over each 
entranceway. Many places had set up elaborate window-front displays of fresh 
fish, fruit and vegetables, all on ice, to catch the lunch-crowd eye. We might 
have been at a busy outdoor market. 
</P>
<P>
Which to choose? We selected Le Mouton d'Or, mostly because it had a cozy fire 
ablaze and we could see heaps of dark mussel shells on many of the tables. 
Good, flavorful beer is one of Belgium's treasures, and we were quickly served 
two towering glasses. 
</P>
<P>
I ordered mussels with white wine sauce, and my wife a variation with tomatoes, 
peppers and onions, neither of us quite sure what we would get. 
</P>
<P>
A lunch of beer, mussels and frites is hardly gourmet fare, but I contend that 
the proof of a good restaurant is how well it manages its ordinary dishes. Le 
Mouton d'Or did wonderfully. 
</P>
<P>
Our mussels arrived in good time, served in two huge black kettles, each pot 
large enough to simmer a week's worth of soup. They must have contained four or 
five dozen mussels apiece (I stopped counting the shells after the first three 
dozen or so), all floating in a sauce rich with fresh vegetables and herbs. 
</P>
<P>
A platter of frites, the slender French fries on which Belgians pride 
themselves, followed immediately, with bread to sop up the sauce. We ate 
through the rainstorm and then some, and relaxed a while longer with a cup of 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
The bill for two, tip included, was a reasonable $36. Eating, we decided, was 
going to be one of our favorite activities in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its culinary expertise, Brussels often is ignored by American tourists, 
perhaps because it is viewed as a modern city of commerce. While that is true, 
the city is anything but staid. 
</P>
<P>
Most European capitals celebrate their castles and cathedrals. Brussels has its 
historic architecture too, but it cherishes the impudent little statue called 
"Mannekin Pis" depicting a chubby naked boy urinating into a fountain. 
</P>
<P>
It's a whimsical piece dating back to the 14th Century that reflects an 
underlying spirit of good times. When the shops and offices close, Brussels has 
fun. 
</P>
<P>
The latest version of the statue, sculpted in bronze in 1619, stands about a 
block from the Grand Place, on Rue de l'Etuve. 
</P>
<P>
To my list of the city's special treats, which already includes good food and 
beer, should be added another exquisite temptation: chocolates. Belgium is a 
world capital of fine, handmade chocolates, and hardly a block in the center of 
the city doesn't have one or two chocolatiers ready to sell you a single piece 
or a boxful. 
</P>
<P>
To curb the mounting calories, we treated the chocolates as dessert, stopping 
in a different shop after each meal to sample just one or two creamy truffles 
and maybe a nut cluster. Our favorite shop was Wittamer in the Place du Grand 
Sablon, a charming old neighborhood only a short walk south from the Grand 
Place. 
</P>
<P>
Wittamer, in fact, is two shops, a few doors from each other. One sells 
chocolates and the other is a gleamingly elegant patisserie offering luscious 
pastries and amazing ice cream creations. Eat a light lunch before this 
dessert. 
</P>
<P>
Between meals we did manage a substantial amount of sightseeing, almost all of 
it on foot. Brussels is a good walking city. Every day we began at the Grand 
Place, the gorgeous heart of old Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
The city's principal square, it is ringed with sidewalk cafes and rivals the 
most beautiful plazas or squares anywhere in Europe. A colorful extravaganza of 
fanciful statuary, ornate columns and gold-leaf facades, it is a delicious, 
entertaining feast for the eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Wealthy commercial guilds built their palatial headquarters around the square. 
Part of its beauty stems from architectural unity. 
</P>
<P>
In 1695, Louis XIV bombarded Brussels, which was then ruled by Spain, 
destroying much of the square. City leaders rebuilt it with great care for 
aesthetics. Even if you are not a food fancier, the Grand Place is still worth 
a special trip to Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
The dominant structures on the square are the Gothic Town Hall with its 
slender, soaring belfry, and the similarly Gothic Municipal Museum, which faces 
it from the other side of the square. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Brussels is determinedly modern, but inside the square it is easy to 
imagine you have stepped back into the 17th Century. Wherever you look, the 
view is Gothic or Renaissance or baroque. 
</P>
<P>
I enjoyed sitting in a cafe window sipping a beer and enjoying the square's 
architectural curiosities. Some of the decorations are charming. The House of 
the Swan, once home of the butchers guild, is adorned with a large swan, but 
others are bizarre, depicting unusual methods of torture. 
</P>
<P>
On that first rainy day in Brussels, we did not stray far from the Grand Place. 
At mid-morning, after a tour of the Municipal Museum, we snacked on apple and 
apricot tarts at La Chaloupe d'Or, once the house of the tailors and now a 
bustling coffeehouse and beer pub. 
</P>
<P>
Confirmed sightseers ought to think of Brussels as a reward to themselves. 
Exhaust the museums of London, Paris and Amsterdam, then head for Brussels for 
a long weekend of good food and pleasant relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite restaurant in our three-day stay was the charming and inexpensive 
Aux Armes de Bruxelles, also on Petite Rue des Bouchers. 
</P>
<P>
It was crowded and noisy, the kind of old-style dining room where the waiters 
know most of the patrons and almost everyone sits elbow-to-elbow at communal 
tables for eight. The congenial banter between waiters and residents put to the 
lie a guidebook warning that the Petite Rue des Bouchers caters only to 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
All through the meal one waiter was kept busy making flaming crepes, each batch 
preceded by a fountain of fire that leaped for the ceiling. I expected someone 
to be charred momentarily, but the waiter knew what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
The food was as good as the room was colorful. I ordered a boneless chicken 
breast in an orange sauce, a dish that arrived rather fancily arranged in 
alternate orange and chicken slices. It was accompanied by potatoes Normandie, 
which looked like small crusty marshmallows, and a mixed salad of very fresh 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Belgian farmers are noted for the extremely high quality of their fruits and 
vegetables, and it is said that the Belgian consumer will accept nothing but 
the best. I ended the meal with a delicious praline souffle and coffee. My half 
of the dinner, a large beer and tip included, was $32. 
</P>
<P>
The Brussels tourist office in the Town Hall sells an annual guide to the 
city's restaurants, rating them both on quality and on value for the money. 
From one to five irises are awarded by a committee of Brussels's best-known 
food critics. 
</P>
<P>
If you are a stranger to the city, as we were, the guidebook (about 90 cents) 
is very helpful. Aux Armes de Bruxelles, good as it was, rated only a single 
iris. 
</P>
<P>
One night we tried a three-iris restaurant, Trente Rue de la Paille, 
recommended by a friend who had lived recently in the city. Just off the lovely 
Place du Grand Sablon, it is a cozy spot with seating for no more than a couple 
of dozen diners. 
</P>
<P>
The food was superb, but contrary to the rest of our experience in Brussels, it 
also was very expensive. An extra iris or two, it seems, can add considerably 
to the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The menu was written on a blackboard, listing at most a handful of choices for 
a first and second course and dessert. An appetizer of artichoke hearts and 
diced tomatoes was not added to the bill but was included. The price, with wine 
and tip, was $90 per person. 
</P>
<P>
Once I sniffed at travelers who returned home talking only of the fine food 
they had, but my wife put the matter into perspective. 
</P>
<P>
I am fond of history, she noted, and enjoy pursuing historic paths, an activity 
she gladly shares during the day. But her hobby is fine cooking, and she loves 
to examine cookbooks. When she travels she wants to sample what the great chefs 
of the world are serving. So I follow her lead in the evening, hardly the worse 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
My special interest was the small collection of works in the Museum of Ancient 
Art by the 16th-Century painter Pieter Brueghel, who lived in and is buried in 
Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
With an innovative genius, Brueghel captured the everyday life of his time in 
such extraordinary works as "Winter Landscape with Skaters and Bird Trap," 
which depicts young ice skaters on a village pond. It is a haunting painting. 
</P>
<P>
One afternoon we made a pilgrimage to the Horta Museum, a tribute to Belgian 
architect Victor Horta, who pioneered art nouveau at the turn of this century. 
The style was very popular in Brussels, and the Town Hall tourist office 
distributes a list of 60 art nouveau structures still standing. It is at 25 Rue 
Americaine, about an hour's brisk walk south from the Grand Place. 
</P>
<P>
"A house should not merely be a reflection of its owner's life style but should 
represent a portrait of him," Horta once said. 
</P>
<P>
The museum occupies two adjacent townhouses built by Horta in 1898. He lived in 
one and kept his office in the other. They are an artwork of swirling polished 
wood, gracefully curving ironwork, rich ballooning cabinetry, mosaic floors and 
stained glass of delicate tones. 
</P>
<P>
One of Brussels' finest residential and shopping areas, the Place du Grand 
Sablon, is south of the Grand Place in a neighborhood well worth spending some 
time. 
</P>
<P>
There you will find Wittamer the chocolatier and some of the more expensive 
restaurants, including Trente Rue de la Paille. There are also numerous art 
galleries and antique shops, many of the latter lining Rue de Rollebeck -- a 
steep, one-block cobblestone street leading to the square. 
</P>
<P>
The focal point of the Grand Sablon is Petit Sablon, a beautiful 
Renaissance-style garden filled with statuary. A splendid wrought-iron fence 
encircles the garden, its posts topped by 48 bronze statuettes representing 
Brussels guilds. I found it fun trying to identify them. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby is the 12th-Century Church of Notre Dame de la Chapelle, which shelters 
Breughel's tomb. 
</P>
<P>
Just north of the Grand Place are the three St. Hubert Royal Galleries, the 
first glass-covered shopping arcades built in Europe. Dating from 1846, they 
are the Gallery of the King, Gallery of the Queen and Gallery of the Princes. 
</P>
<P>
Each is lined with boutiques, a few of them selling the handmade lacework for 
which Belgium is famous. Lace handkerchiefs are about $15 each; a box of 
Belgian chocolates begins at about $10. 
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, the subject somehow always gets back to food, and I don't want to 
omit yet one more edible treat to which I succumbed -- the Belgian waffle. 
</P>
<P>
Just across the street from our hotel entrance was a window-front waffle shop 
dispensing fresh-made hot waffle squares, heaped high with whipped cream and 
splashed with good Belgian chocolate sauce. 
</P>
<P>
I consider it an act of strong will that I indulged only once -- about an hour 
after I flew into town. But then, how else would I have managed the beer, the 
frites, the mussels, the apricot tarts and all the other delights awaiting me 
here?

MANHATTAN'S TIMES SQUARE BOASTS ANOTHER ENTHUSIASTIC RENAISSANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HORACE SUTTON 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bozo on the billboard advertising cigarettes has long since stopped blowing 
smoke rings across Broadway, but Times Square is glowing like never before. 
</P>
<P>
New hotels have opened among the glass sky-scratchers, offering lofty rooms 
adjacent to theaters, restaurants in assorted styles of cuisine, swimming pools 
and health clubs, and conference centers equipped with every electronic marvel. 
</P>
<P>
This activity includes places that just opened or will swing open doors in the 
weeks ahead, many of them with special rates for weekend visitors. Even Sleaze 
Alley, that tinsel stretch of 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth avenues, 
is marked for a $2.5-billion overhaul that will bring it new theaters, shops 
and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The Victory Theater built by Oscar Hammerstein, father of the late lyricist, in 
1898 and the oldest theater on Broadway, has already reopened. The New 
Amsterdam, which played "The Ziegfeld Follies" as well as Fred and Adele 
Astaire, is expected to follow. 
</P>
<P>
None of this reupholstering will affect the off-Broadway stretch between 9th 
and 11th avenues that has become known as "Theater Row," a string of small 
theaters that has attracted an assortment of modest restaurants such as the 
West Bank Cafe and Chez Josephine, run by one of the adopted sons of Josephine 
Baker, darling of Paris and New York City in the '20s. 
</P>
<P>
The old Hudson Theater -- where Ethel Barrymore performed in 1903, where Ralph 
Bellamy was the star of "Detective Story," where "Arsenic and Old Lace" ran 
forever and where Jane Fonda and Geraldine Page were in "Strange Interlude" -- 
has been welded into the eye-popping Hotel Macklowe. 
</P>
<P>
Once the home, too, of Jack Paar's TV show on NBC, the Hudson has become part 
of the hotel's elaborate conference center that will occupy floors two to six, 
embracing 38 meeting rooms. 
</P>
<P>
A $250-million project, the Macklowe will have a gourmet restaurant off the 
black Carrera marble lobby. African mahogany in striking patterns lines the 
corridor walls, and from upper-floor rooms guests can look across to the Lyceum 
Theater, built in 1903. 
</P>
<P>
Also viewable is the huge Marriott Marquis, which started the Times Square 
renaissance when it opened with 1,874 rooms, including 141 suites, five years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
In view, also, is the huge Broadway State Building on the site of the old Loews 
State Theater. It has a shopping mall and four movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Atop the Palace Theater on Broadway, which was world-famous for its in-person 
stars -- "playing the Palace" was a catch phrase among entertainers -- a 
460-room hotel will open this fall. It will be an Embassy Suites project taking 
up 36 floors of a 43-story tower rising above 47th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Already open is the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, a 770-room sanctuary on Broadway 
and 49th Street. It gets $175 to $195 for singles, $20 above that for doubles 
and about $210 on the concierge level on the 46th floor. 
</P>
<P>
From there, having breakfast or cocktails, one can look north to Central Park, 
east to Rockefeller Center and to the Winter Garden at street level where 
"Cats" is still playing. 
</P>
<P>
This Holiday Inn has opened the largest hotel pool in town alongside its swim 
and health club. Every imaginable exercise machine is on hand, including a 
bicycle trainer that allows one to watch videotapes while pedaling nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
Its Broadway Grill, operated by David Liederman (of David's Cookies), has an 
open kitchen and a chalkboard menu. A "Broadway grill burger" costs $9.50, with 
lunch or dinner for under $20. At Samplings, the other beanery, one can eat at 
the bar or at a table next to the picture windows, with all of Times Square 
erupting below. 
</P>
<P>
Bronze plaques have been set into the sidewalk along Broadway's Walk of Stars, 
which honors many luminaries of the stage and screen, among them Helen Hayes, 
Ingrid Bergman, Jose Ferrer, Patricia Neal, David Wayne and director Elia 
Kazan. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Apple people like to say that Times Square stretches up to 59th Street 
and wanders east and west on- and off-Broadway and Seventh Avenue. That brings 
in the new Rihga Royal Hotel on 54th Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese-owned and managed by a 10-hotel Nipponese chain with headquarters in 
Osaka, it is thoroughly Western. Its 500 rooms have sitting areas that can be 
closed off from the bedroom. It is full-service with a butler that can fetch 
meals around the clock. A refrigerator, which makes ice cubes, is in every 
room. 
</P>
<P>
Standard suites go for $225 up to $375, with 20% off those rates until Labor 
Day. It's a summer sale. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Apple takes a bite out of visitors as things stand now with an 8 1/4% 
sales tax on hotel bills, plus a 5% hotel tax and a $2-per-room occupancy tax. 
A proposed additional 5% hotel tax is facing a stiff fight.

YOUTH BEAT: DISCOUNTS NOT ONLY FOR STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Many young people are eligible for travel discounts even if they are not 
students. One way to plug into them is with an International Youth Identity 
Card. It costs $10 and is available to anyone under 26. To get one, proof of 
age and a photograph must be provided. 
</P>
<P>
The card was created by the Federation of International Youth Travel 
Organizations. Services affiliated with it are listed in a brochure that comes 
with the card. They are foreign agencies that cater to young travelers. 
</P>
<P>
Card holders should show the card anywhere student discounts are offered. 
Although it is not a student card, it's often honored. 
</P>
<P>
More details are available from Council Travel, 1093 Broxton Ave., Suite 220, 
Los Angeles 90024; (213) 208-3551. 
</P>
<P>
This summer five youth hostels will open in the Cape Cod area. Each will 
provide travelers of any age with clean and safe accommodations for $9 per 
person, per night. 
</P>
<P>
The Cape Cod area, which is known for its white-sand beaches, has 300 miles of 
coastline and bicycle paths, and lures visitors with such activities as 
fishing, boating, ocean diving and whale watching. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the summer hostels are on that cape. Another is on Nantucket Island 
and another on Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
The hostels, open for the summer season, offer dormitory-style accommodations, 
with separate men's and women's rooms, plus fully equipped, self-service 
kitchens. Guest can furnish their own or rent linens. Blankets, mattresses and 
pillows are provided. Some hostels rent bikes. Where bikes or mopeds are not 
rented, the staff will know about nearby rental shops. 
</P>
<P>
The 48-bed Little American Hostel, (508) 349-3889, in Truro within Seashore 
Park was originally a Coast Guard station. It can be reached by car, bike, bus 
or the ferry from Boston to Provincetown. The hostel closes for the season 
Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
The mid-Cape Hostel, (508) 255-2785, at Eastham, is a 15-minute walk from the 
Bay of Cape Cod, and a short bike ride from ocean beaches. Accommodations are 
available in four- to six-person cabins. It is open until Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Hyannis, a popular place for whale watching and the location of the Kennedy 
family compound, has a year-round, 48-bed youth hostel, (508) 755-2970, at 465 
Falmouth Road. Bicycles can be rented. Some separate rooms for couples and 
families are also available. 
</P>
<P>
On the island of Martha's Vineyard, five miles inland from Edgartown, is the 
85-bed Manter Memorial Hostel, telephone (508) 693-2665. It's accessible by 
bike path, and it will be open until Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
On Nantucket you can stay at the Star of the Sea Hostel, (508) 228-0433, in 
what was the first life-saving station on the island. It's listed on the 
National Register of Historic Places. The 72-bed hostel is three miles from the 
village of Nantucket at Surfside Beach. You can reach it by paved bicycle path. 
It will be open until Oct. 9. 
</P>
<P>
The best time to visit is June or September, when crowds are down. If you go in 
the summer, try to avoid weekends. Beds at youth hostels can be reserved upon 
receipt of at least a 50% deposit. 
</P>
<P>
These hostels are part of American Youth Hostels. Non-members can use the 
hostels if they buy a two-night guest card for $6. 
</P>
<P>
Be prepared for the hostels to close during the day, 9 a.m. until 5 p.m., and 
expect to clean up after yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Free AYH Cape Cod Hostels brochures are available from American Youth Hostels, 
Dept. CC, P.O. Box 37613, Washington, D.C. 20013-37613, (202) 783-6161. 
</P>
<P>
A free copy of "Experience California Hotels," which lists all 28 AYH-Hostels 
from Oregon to San Diego's Imperial Beach, is available form Los Angeles 
Council of American Youth Hostels, 335 West 7th St., San Pedro 90731.

For the latest road, trail and weather conditions of the various hiking venues 
mentioned in the accompanying story, contact the appropriate visitors center. 
Since many of the state parks and national forests offer campgrounds (or some 
other rustic accommodations), along with picnic facilities and nature exhibits, 
you can easily make a weekend adventure from one of these outings. 
</P>
<P>
It's particularly important to call ahead in this severe drought year (our 
fourth dry year in a row). Some remote backcountry areas are closed because of 
fire danger. Other paths are simply unpleasant because of the withered flora 
and dusty conditions.

FOOTLOOSE: WARMING UP TO PLEASURES OF CANNES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYER and ED RABEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CANNES, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What was once a tiny fishing village surrounded by cane brakes has become, 
thanks to a member of the English gentry, one of the Mediterranean's most 
beautiful watering holes. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Peter Lord Brougham, a bit of a sun freak who had a half-open carriage 
named for him, was on his way to Nice in 1834 when a cholera epidemic there 
forced him to do a U-turn. As a result, he spent his yearly holiday here and 
built a villa. 
</P>
<P>
Brougham praised Cannes' blue waters and warming sun to his London friends and 
they began coming here in droves, creating yet another first for the Britons in 
establishing Cannes (named for those cane brakes) as one of the Continent's 
jewel-in-the-rough resorts headed for bigger things. 
</P>
<P>
From the Cannes Film Festival in May until the end of summer, the main road 
along the sea, La Croisette, becomes a radiant parade of peacock-hued strollers 
and pricey autos moving slowly along past the lineup of pricey hotels. 
</P>
<P>
But in the narrow streets of Le Suquet (Old Town), the tone and texture of 
Cannes changes into that of a small French town, with all the charm, warmth and 
joie de vivre one invariably finds in such places. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Fly Air France nonstop to Paris and then to Nice for $834 to $971 
round trip, with advance purchase, depending on the month flown and day of 
week. American, Delta, TWA, Pan Am or Continental will get you to Paris for 
$758-$854 round trip. Paris-Nice with Air France or Air Inter is $139 one way. 
It's 17 miles by shuttle bus, car or helicopter from Nice to Cannes. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Give Cannes a couple of days, but the Haut Pays (hill 
country behind the Riviera) is dotted with little towns more than worthy of 
exploration. Food and lodging costs run the gamut, from tres cher down to 
moderate. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: The French franc recently traded at 5.79 to the dollar. Visit 
April through November, after which much of the town is closed. February-March 
is Cannes' low season. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: Hotel Festival (3 Rue Moliere; $32 to $38 B&amp;B double, 
low season, $46-$60 high) is a small and elegant house furnished with the 
owners' family antiques from Provence. The Festival is very quiet, has a small 
garden and is a short walk from La Croisette. Nine of the 17 rooms have small 
kitchens; only breakfast is served. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel de France (85 Rue d'Antibes; $38-$44 B&amp;B double, low season, $55-$68 
high) has a tiny lobby and entrance, but the interior recently has been 
refurbished in a bright and fresh way. Bedrooms are neat and comfortable but on 
the small side, with baths the same. It's on a busy shopping street just off La 
Croisette. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Univers (2 Rue du Marechal Foch; $49-$60 B&amp;B double, low season, 
$79-$104 high) also has a good central location in from the beach. 
Contemporary, with a rooftop terrace-bar that has views of the bay and hills 
behind town. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: Cannes and all of the rest of the Cote d'Azur enjoy 
the best of all worlds when it comes to food: French, with overtones of nearby 
Italy and herb-blanketed Provence. While the town claims no dish as its own, 
expect to encounter bourride (a whitefish soup served with garlic mayonnaise), 
Marseille bouillabaisse, plenty of loup (sea bass), lotte (angler fish), 
oysters and mussels. 
</P>
<P>
Most Frenchmen breakfast on cafe au lait and a croissant, but many old hands on 
the Riviera and in the Haut Pays get the day rolling with their beloved 
pissaladiere, a small slice of pizza loaded with onions, black olives, 
anchovies and olive oil, downed with a glass of red wine. 
</P>
<P>
White wines from Cassis down the coast go well with the seafood. And the roses 
from Provence and reds of Bandol are a treat with anything. 
</P>
<P>
Good dining: La Toque Blanche (3 Rue La Fontaine) opened 70 years ago but is 
now run by two brothers who double as chefs. The place has a beamed ceiling, 
pink walls, linen, china and, during our visit, tulips. Fresh food of the 
season is emphasized, including Alsatian choucroute in cool weather. Menu 
selections begin at about $20. 
</P>
<P>
Astoux et Brun (27 Rue Felix Faure) is on the port, an informal place with 
paper napkins, lots of chatting between tables. The specialties are oysters, 
shrimp and shellfish, and locals say it's the best place in town for getting 
them fresh. Sit at an outdoor table and order a gigantic platter of shellfish 
(three kinds of oysters) for $20. 
</P>
<P>
Le Caveau "30" (45 Rue Felix Faure) is down the street from Astoux et Brun and 
across from the flower market. It, too, is popular with the Cannois and usually 
crowded. Our $16 menu choice brought a first-course of mussels, then bourride, 
salad and dessert. It also does a superb salade nicoise. 
</P>
<P>
Going first-class: The Carlton Inter-Continental Cannes (58 Blvd. Croisette; 
$241-$413 double) is the Grande Dame of hotels here. It is a legendary palace 
of exquisite lounges and beautiful bedrooms, now glowing from a $25-milliom 
renovation. That bought a casino and the new La Cote restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Movie moguls favor the Carlton during festival week, gathering around the pool 
or at its private beach bar to wheel, deal and be seen. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Although cultural requirements are slim in Cannes, take a walk 
through Le Suquet, resting on a terrace by a 16th-Century church for views of 
the bay and town. 
</P>
<P>
Also stroll down Rue Maynadier, joining the new town with Le Suquet, for its 
great food shops. The Cenerie cheese shop at No. 22, which has more than 300 
types of cheeses displayed in a floral setting, is an absolute Eden for 
connoisseurs. 
</P>
<P>
A few doors down at No. 16 you'll find La Boulangerie Banette, another 
must-stop for anyone really interested in a formidable display of great breads. 
</P>
<P>
Driving into the Haut Pays is one of the great joys of a Cote d'Azur visit. The 
village of Mougins (seven miles north) is an enchanting little hilltop town and 
also one of France's culinary wonders, with its clutch of Michelin-starred 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Chef Roger Verge takes deserved accolades for his Moulin de Mougins, but Andre 
Surmain's Relais a Mougins gets our gastronomic vote for his good humor and a 
magnificent table. Both expensive. 
</P>
<P>
For more information: The French National Tourist Office has a new (900) 
420-2003 telephone number (50 cents per minute) for information requests. Call 
it for a brochure on the Riviera, including Cannes, and other information on 
France. Or write to 9454 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 303, Beverly Hills 90212, for 
the same.

In the June 3 News and Briefs column, the "Quick Fact" about one ton of ice 
being 10 feet on each side is grossly in error. 
</P>
<P>
A 10-foot cube would equal 1,000 cubic feet, and a ton of ice equally only 
about 36 cubic feet. Therefore your cube would be about 27 tons. 
</P>
<P>
One ton of fresh water is 35.96 CF. The specific gravity is 1.0, while ice is 
.9166, which allows it to float. A ton of ice would equal a cube of slightly 
more than 3.3 feet on each side. So there!

Regarding the ton of ice in the June 3 News and Briefs, a 2,000-pound ice cube 
contains approximately 35 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
Doing some rough computations, I find that a one-ton ice cube is about three 
feet and three inches on a side. A meter. That is the "Fact."

I look forward to Jerry Hulse's Travel Tips column in the Travel Section, but 
am losing my enthusiasm very fast. Instead of slapping down the people or 
establishments who recommend accommodations with outlandish prices, you give 
them space with nary a comment. 
</P>
<P>
I don't count anymore the so-called B&amp;Bs charging three-digit rates for a 
room with a cup of coffee and a couple of fancy croissants. 
</P>
<P>
Your paper is read by hundreds of thousands of readers for whom $100, while not 
being what it used to be, still means something pretty big. Why don't you 
suggest that overly fancy hotels, even when they masquerade as B&amp;Bs, send 
their press releases elsewhere to be read by people with money to burn and/or 
lavish expense accounts? 
</P>
<P>
Keep giving us the three-four liners of people who really travel and send in 
their contributions. But spare us the (mostly American) super-deluxe 
commercials.

IT MIGHT NOT BE BEST OF TIMES FOR FRENCH, BUT LE PEN'S RACISM WILL NOT HOLD 
SWAY; 
</P>
<P>
FRANCE: DESPITE INCREASED ANTI-SEMITIC AND RACIST INCIDENTS, THE RIGHT-WING 
NATIONALIST PARTY DOES NOT HAVE MASS APPEAL FOR THE FRENCH.

"Touche pas a 'pote" is the slogan of SOS Racisme, a French anti-racism 
education and advocacy group. It means, roughly, "Don't mess with my buddy." 
Lately, SOS Racisme has had plenty to do. 
</P>
<P>
Swastikas on headstones; teachers assaulted; Jewish corpses disinterred and 
mutilated -- the latest rash of attacks have stirred up fear in a community 
already nervous. German reunification; rising anti-Semitism across the Soviet 
Union; increasing Israeli isolation -- 1990 has not been an easy year for 
Europe's, or America's, Jews. 
</P>
<P>
The National Front, a party whose delegates in the European Parliament voted 
against a resolution condemning the desecration of the cemetery at Carpentras, 
currently stands at about 15% in the polls. Some National Front supporters 
endorsed views disseminated by a small school of "revisionists" who claim that 
there wasn't a Holocaust, and that, anyway, it wasn't Hitler's fault. Spokesmen 
for the National Front deny the group is revisionist or anti-Semitic, and say 
the Jewish community is part of the traditional France they wish to protect. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the real feelings of front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen and his close 
associates about the Jews, however, it is clear that any "Jewish problem" in 
France is a secondary issue for the National Front. It is Arabs the front 
really hates, and it calls for the expulsion of all but a handful of the 9 
million Arabs it claims are in France. The front wants an end to legal 
immigration, and reforms of French law to make citizenship far harder for 
foreign-born residents to get. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-immigrant tactics of the front expose it, legitimately, to charges of 
racism. Ugly caricatures of Arab families riding magic carpets to France adorn 
its leaflets. The front's view of the Arab mentality would probably find echoes 
on the lunatic fringe of Israeli politics: All Arabs are Muslims, all Muslims 
are anti-Western extremists and any person of Arab descent is presumed guilty 
of harboring sentiments hostile to Western culture and France. For National 
Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, this struggle over immigration is but the 
latest stage in a confrontation that began when the 8th-Century French King 
Charles Martel defeated a Muslim invasion. 
</P>
<P>
This talk sounds strange to American ears, but resounds in France, where defeat 
in the Algerian War of Independence divided the nation. A million or so French 
settlers who fled Algeria after the defeat constitute a still-powerful lobby in 
French politics. For these anti-Arab, anti-communist veterans, even Charles de 
Gaulle wasn't enough of a patriot. 
</P>
<P>
Le Pen isn't the Hitler of France: He is more like its Jesse Helms. But he is 
now the beneficiary of a powerful wave of unrest that could create enormous 
difficulties for the mainstream parties. 
</P>
<P>
From the French Revolution until recently, French politics have been both 
bitter and ideological. Now they are just bitter. France's powerful and 
political and intellectual elites have moved toward ideological consensus since 
Francois Mitterrand became president. The Socialists have, in effect, given up 
Socialism and become moderate free-marketeers; the conservatives have also 
accepted the market -- a big step. One other cause unites the fractious elites: 
1992. The construction of a united Europe under the cultural and, to some 
degree, the political leadership of France helps satisfy a perpetual appetite 
for grandeur and glory. 
</P>
<P>
This would be fine if the market were working in France, and if 1992 was 
working out as planned -- but neither is turning out as projected. The French 
economy has been doing moderately well, but unemployment remains high and the 
real income of the poorest 25% of French households has actually declined since 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
As for 1992, the new Europe is looking less French and more German every day. 
1989 was supposed to be the Year of France: The bicentennial of the French 
Revolution would witness the triumph of French policies in the Common Market. 
But the Germans stole the show when the Berlin Wall came down; since November, 
Bonn has been the real motor of Europe. Neither the French Socialists nor the 
mainstream conservatives have figured out how to respond. 
</P>
<P>
The French Communists -- still hard-line after all these years -- are the 
traditional party of protest. They offer no real alternative to the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
This is where the National Front comes in. Social protest doesn't disappear 
when old religions and ideologies die; the protests endure, but take different 
forms. In post-communist France, this means a return to "national 
fundamentalism." For those without jobs, Le Pen has a scapegoat: immigrants. 
For those left unmoved by the bland liberal Eurovision that now shapes the 
French consensus, he offers something more exciting. For those who fear the 
economic and social changes sweeping Europe in the countdown to 1992, he offers 
a return to old verities and a promise that the purpose of the French state is 
to defend French interests like farmers and auto workers from the insidious 
designs of foreigners ever jealous of the glory and the greatness of France. 
</P>
<P>
It is always a danger sign when the French are bored with their leaders, and at 
the moment they seem faintly bored with the whole political circus. Even so, Le 
Pen will probably not succeed in his long-term strategy to take power in France 
-- unless the economy should turn sour and neither the Socialists nor the 
moderate conservatives have any solutions. In that case it is conceivable, 
though by no means certain, that the French would forget their long and 
painfully built democratic traditions to vote for the front. 
</P>
<P>
But even if that should happen, hatred of the Jews is not a popular cause here. 
The principles of decency and the lessons of the Holocaust have sunk far too 
deeply into French culture. Of the French polled, 96% were shocked at the 
outrage at Carpentras; if evidence were to link Le Pen to anti-Semitic 
violence, his political career would almost certainly be finished. 
</P>
<P>
The French have not yet accepted their Arab immigrants as buddies, but from 
everywhere in France the message about Jews has been loud and clear. To 
skinheads, neo-Nazis and thugs of every kind, the French people have sent a 
clear message: touche pas a 'pote -- leave my buddy alone. Anti-Semitism 
remains a political liability in contemporary France; one can only hope it 
remains so in the struggles ahead.

SOUTHERN DISCOMFORT: A NEW KIND OF DEMAGOGUE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: FORMER KLANSMAN DAVID DUKE IS RUNNING FOR THE U.S. SENATE. THE PRESS 
ISN'T ASKING TOUGH QUESTIONS OR LOOKING INTO HIS PAST.

<TEXT>
<P>
The South has a history of politicians who incite the masses by railing at 
enemies, real and imagined. In Depression-era Louisiana, Gov. Huey P. Long 
flailed the oil companies, symbols of wealth in a time of want. A generation 
later, Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace blasted "big guv'ment" and federal 
bureaucrats as political elitists allied with blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Today in Louisiana, demagogy is resurgent in a U.S. Senate campaign. State Rep. 
David Duke, 39, the former Ku Klux Klan leader who became a Republican in 1988, 
is challenging three-term Democratic incumbent J. Bennett Johnston. 
</P>
<P>
Duke, however, is unlike his demagogic predecessors. He grew up middle-class 
rather than poor. Plastic surgery in the 1980s gave him a thinner nose and 
crinkles around the eyes, the latter suggesting a ready smile. His appearance 
probably facilitates his quest to erase his KKK and neo-Nazi ties. But his 
message is the same old line in "new" Duke code. 
</P>
<P>
His attacks on the underclass are transparently anti-black. His real enemies, 
however, are journalists, though in his criticisms he initially sounds 
redemptive: "I do have a past; I've certainly made mistakes." Then he blasts 
the media for distorting "what I'm really about." 
</P>
<P>
The most recent poll shows voters roughly 2-1 for Johnston -- 49% vs. 21%. The 
official Republican nominee, state Sen. Ben Bagert, lags with 14%. The open 
primary is Oct. 6; if no candidate wins a majority, a runoff will follow. 
</P>
<P>
In discounting Duke's chances, pundits like to cite a Johnston poll that put 
Duke's negative rating at 48%, a number that would scare most politicians into 
retirement. Yet Duke's current standing in the polls is an indication of how 
far he's come, despite his negatives, since he won election a year ago to the 
state legislature by a mere 227 votes in a district that is 99% white. One 
reason is that Duke's is a campaign in perpetuity. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a state GOP Central Committee member, Elizabeth Rickey, twice 
offered a resolution censuring Duke because he was selling Nazi books and had 
argued that the Holocaust was "a myth perpetrated on Christians by Jews." But 
sensing Duke's blue-collar support, state GOP leaders rejected Rickey's 
motions, thereby handing the former Klansman a mantle of legitimacy. The 
Faustian pact backfired when two ex-Nazis and a former Klan activist showed up 
as Duke delegates to the convention that nominated Bagert, who was a Democrat 
until 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Now Duke is outpacing his party's own candidate. He is seeking to expand the 
old Wallace constituency with a nationwide mailing to neo-Nazi sympathizers and 
white supremacists. He had raised $455,000 by April, according to federal 
election records. 
</P>
<P>
Duke also enjoys some support on Louisiana's campuses. At three universities, 
white student unions promoting "Euro-American culture" have been formed. Lance 
Hill, a doctoral student researching the Duke phenomenon at Tulane, which has 
such a union, believes that most new recruits to the Nazi movement will come 
from these unions. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston, with $2.5 million in his campaign war chest, is having no trouble 
raising money from outraged liberals around the country. But he seems strangely 
detached. He recently proposed putting a uranium-enrichment plant in a state 
with 40,000 oil-waste pits, high cancer rates and deepening popular fears about 
pollution. Drawing crowds of 800 to 1,000, Duke routinely calls for -- and gets 
-- a show of hands of those with a friend or relative afflicted with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
As a state representative, Duke has yet to sponsor a bill that became a law. 
But his anti-media strategy has helped to shift public attention from his long 
record of promoting Nazi master-race theories. In nearly every speech, he 
criticizes the state's largest newspaper, the New Orleans Times-Picayune, which 
has opted for a "less is better" approach to covering the senatorial campaign. 
Only its main events are reported, with the paper devoting no space to how Duke 
built his National Assn. for the Advancement of White People. 
</P>
<P>
The NAAWP News promotes genetic engineering modeled on the Nazi master-race 
theory. It advocates sterilizing welfare mothers, which Duke translates as 
"birth-control incentives" in his speeches. The Holocaust-as-myth theory is 
another tenet of the NAAWP, which for years ran a mail-order service offering 
such books as "The Hitler We Loved and Why" and "The Holy Book of Adolf 
Hitler." There has been scant reporting of how these books and videotapes of 
American Nazi Party founder George Lincoln Rockwell are distributed. 
</P>
<P>
Religious and civic leaders formed the Louisiana Coalition Against Racism and 
Nazism to pressure the media into being more aggressive in its political 
coverage. To fill the Duke-fact gap, the coalition has become an informational 
clearinghouse, with Rickey and Hill briefing media across the state. 
</P>
<P>
Still, too many journalists do not question such Duke statements as: "I was 
never involved in any illegal activity, and I don't condone illegal activity." 
In truth, Duke was convicted, in 1979, of inciting a riot outside a hotel in 
the district he now represents. In 1989, he was fined $55 for blocking a 
highway during a black march in Forsyth County, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
Nor has the media paid much attention to the NAAWP's call in 1982 for freeing 
"white political prisoners," specifically John and Ed Gerhardt, who founded a 
Nazi group in Ohio and went to prison for conspiring to blow up a Columbus 
school where the daughter of a judge who issued a desegregation order was a 
student. 
</P>
<P>
Duke's anti-media campaign spares no adversary, no matter how small. In early 
May, publisher Harrell Griffin of the St. Helena Echo, a rural weekly, refused 
to run a Duke advertisement. According to Griffin, Duke aide Callie S. O'Pry 
"called in a very pleasant voice, saying they were going to institute a boycott 
against the Echo, write letters to all advertisers to stop advertising and do 
the same with my subscribers. The next day I lost two news boxes. Someone 
kicked 'em. When that didn't work, they ran into 'em with a truck." 
</P>
<P>
That week, Duke spoke at a packed hall in Chalmette, a suburb of New Orleans. A 
dozen skinheads stood at the main door. Older men drinking beer lined the rear 
of the hall. When Duke scoffed at the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, one man 
piped: "Kill another one!" 
</P>
<P>
Duke appeals to the fears of people who see their living standards declining 
amid rising crime and drug abuse. "Any sort of racism is absolutely morally 
wrong," he piously intoned to his audience that night. "We do need more racial 
harmony," a remark that drew curses from several men. 
</P>
<P>
Duke spoke of his "employment working with the State Department" in Laos in 
1970. "I volunteered to go behind enemy lines, and a couple of times I almost 
didn't come back." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he was denied an Army commission after completing the ROTC program at 
Louisiana State University. According to Retired Lt. Col. James May, who was 
Duke's senior ROTC instructor: "His affiliation with Nazism precluded him from 
getting a commission. . . . Hell, we couldn't tolerate such a thing." 
</P>
<P>
The State Department has no record of Duke's employment. But David H. Duke, the 
candidate's father, who worked as a civil engineer for the U.S. government in 
Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, said in an interview last year that his 
son visited Laos and "got himself a job" -- teaching English. 
</P>
<P>
Like Jimmy Swaggart, another folk hero sprung from these latitudes, Duke is a 
walking psychodrama, challenging reporters to separate fact from the many 
fictions of his speech. Sadly, too many of them look the other way.

EUTHANASIA: THE RELEVANCE OF RELIGION TO A PERSON'S LIFE AFFECTS OPINION ON

<TEXT>
<P>
When a doctor from Michigan helped an Oregon woman with Alzheimer's disease 
commit suicide last week, he knew his decision -- and hers -- would kindle a 
debate on medical ethics and mercy killing. 
</P>
<P>
While authorities debate the doctor's actions, a new survey shows that although 
some Americans might disagree with the methods used by Dr. Jack Kevorkian, a 
Detroit pathologist, all segments of the public support right-to-die policies. 
There is a widely held belief that physicians should sometimes allow a patient 
to die rather than use the full range of medical procedures and treatments 
available. 
</P>
<P>
And Americans, regardless of their religious beliefs, overwhelmingly support 
the right of patients to make their own decisions about life-sustaining 
treatment. If a person is unable to make his or her decisions known, people say 
a close family member should be allowed to make the call. 
</P>
<P>
These are among the findings of a Reflections of the Times poll of 1,213 adults 
nationwide. The poll was conducted for the Times Mirror Center for the People 
and the Press in Washington, and examined public views about dealing with 
terminal illness and disability. 
</P>
<P>
The poll (with an error margin of 3%), conducted last month, showed: 
</P>
<P>
More than half of Americans, 59%, would want their doctors to stop 
administering life-sustaining treatment if they had a terminal disease and were 
suffering a great deal of physical pain. 
</P>
<P>
Those polled made a distinction between the decision to forgo life-sustaining 
treatment for adults and the decision of parents to withhold treatment for 
severely handicapped children. 
</P>
<P>
The strength of religious views play a key role in determining views about 
ending the life of a suffering person. 
</P>
<P>
One-third of adults can imagine themselves taking the life of a loved one who 
was suffering terribly from an illness that was terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Americans have profoundly mixed feelings about growing old. Only four in 10 
adults would like to live to be 100 years old, and half would emphatically not 
want to be that old. Women especially do not look forward to reaching the 
milestone of their 100th birthday. Ironically, this accomplishment is more 
likely for a woman than a man. 
</P>
<P>
The public's feelings about right-to-die legislation is driven by its belief in 
the need for discretion in administering life-sustaining medical treatment. 
Eight in 10 adults approve of state laws that allow medical treatment for a 
terminally ill patient to be withdrawn or withheld, if that is what the patient 
wishes. 
</P>
<P>
Most states have some form of right-to-die legislation, and for the first time 
in its history, the U.S. Supreme Court is now considering whether there is a 
constitutional right to discontinue life-sustaining medical treatment in the 
case of Cruzan vs. Harmon. The public's attitude toward right-to-die 
legislation is bolstered by a trend toward greater acceptance of suicide in the 
face of suffering. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the public thinks a person has a moral right to commit suicide if 
suffering from an incurable disease or from great pain with no hope of 
improvement. Acceptance of suicide in such cases has been increasing gradually 
over the 15-year period since 1975, when these attitudes were first measured by 
the Gallup Poll. More than half, 55%, now think a person suffering great pain 
with no hope of improvement has a moral right to suicide, compared with only 
41% 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The increasing acceptance of suicide is largely due to the aging of the 
population. The older people who overwhelmingly rejected suicide as a response 
to terminal illness 15 years ago have died and been replaced in the population 
by younger people with more moderate views about the acceptability of suicide 
in these circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Attitudes about suicide differ greatly depending on the strength of one's 
religious views. 
</P>
<P>
Most "born-again" Christians and very religious people reject a right to 
suicide even in the case of a terminal illness. They are fairly evenly divided 
in their attitudes about suicide when the patient is suffering great pain. Yet, 
paradoxically, a majority of "born-again" Christians and the very religious 
think acts of so-called "mercy killing" by spouses are sometimes justified. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that some Americans, particularly those who are very religious, make 
an important distinction between what is "justified" and what is a "right." 
This implies that the difficult decision to end a person's life is perhaps 
justified, understandable and acceptable, yet not endorsed. 
</P>
<P>
But the public makes a distinction between how decisions about medical 
treatment should be made for adults and how they should be made for infants. 
Half of the public rejects the notion that parents can refuse life-sustaining 
treatment on behalf of their severely handicapped infant, saying instead that 
such infants should receive as much treatment as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to agree on what the patient's best interests are in the case 
of a newborn and there's no way to extrapolate what the patient would want from 
knowledge of his or her life," said Susan M. Wolf, a lawyer with the Hastings 
Center, a research institute in New York that studies medical ethics. h Views 
on this issue are also profoundly influenced by religion, with "born-again" 
Christians and those who are very religious most opposed to parental 
decision-making in these cases. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, majority support for the right of parents to refuse medical treatment 
only occurs among those who say religion is unimportant in their lives 
</P>
<P>
It is the relevance of religion to a person's day-to-day life that affects 
opinion on right-to-die issues, rather than one's adherence to a specific set 
of religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
The views that Americans express about right-to-die policies reflect their 
personal feelings about how they would want their own medical treatment handled 
in various situations, and what they know or can imagine about the wishes of 
their parents. Not only do most Americans want life-sustaining treatment to 
cease in the event of terminal illness with severe pain, they also want doctors 
to withhold extended treatment if they had an illness that made them totally 
dependent on another family member for daily care. The wish to have 
life-sustaining medical treatment withdrawn decreases as the importance of 
religion increases. However, a majority (52%) of even the very religious would 
want their own treatment stopped if they were suffering a great deal of 
physical pain. 
</P>
<P>
But fewer people are willing to say they would take part in a mercy killing. 
Only a third of adults can imagine themselves taking the life of a loved one 
who was suffering terribly from an illness that was terminal. The ability to 
imagine the mercy killing of a spouse or other loved one is greater for men. 
But that desire decreases significantly with age, presumably as the possibility 
of actually facing such a choice becomes more likely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Right to Die 
</P>
<P>
the poll of 1,213 adults last month gauged the views of people about mercy 
killing against the importance of religion in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Do you approve or disapprove of laws that let terminally ill patients decide 
about being kept alive through medical treatment?

PROMISE EXCEEDS PERILS OF ACT FOR THE DISABLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Henry Kisor, Henry Kisor, book editor of the Chicago Sun-Times, has been 
totally deaf for 46 of his 49 years. He adapted this article from his book 
What's That Pig Outdoors: A Memoir of Deafness (Hill and Wang). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Americans with Disabilities Act, now being polished by a joint House-Senate 
committee before being sent to President Bush for signature, promises to be the 
most important legislative event of the century for 43 million disabled 
Americans like me, for it extends to us the provisions of the 1964 Civil Rights 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
The act bars discrimination against the disabled in the workplace and ensures 
our access to a wide range of services. It's not without its critics, for 
nobody has been able to put a price tag on it. Furthermore, its sometimes murky 
language will make it a bonanza for lawyers. Nonetheless, I'm convinced its 
benefits will outweigh its flaws -- especially for America's 22 million 
hearing-impaired citizens. 
</P>
<P>
I'll confess ambivalent emotions about the act's provisions against 
discrimination in employment. It's obviously desirable that employers be 
prohibited from denying jobs to the handicapped on the basis of disability 
alone. But the law also obligates employers to provide "reasonable 
accommodation" to disabled workers, and that broad language makes me fret that 
the phrase might be taken too far. 
</P>
<P>
Let me posit an example: At a metropolitan newspaper, an ambitious veteran book 
editor who is deaf decides he's bored with desk work and applies for the post 
of city hall reporter. This job requires hours of telephone work each day, 
including dictating stories to the rewrite desk as well as frequent schmoozing 
in the corridors with politicians. The paper's management realizes that the 
book editor is just as knowledgeable as the other candidate for the job, and 
could acquit himself just as creditably -- if a full-time lip-reading and phone 
interpreter were hired to assist him at $25,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates' talents are equal. But under the provisions of the act, 
management cannot deny the deaf editor the job simply because of the cost of 
accommodating his handicap. There is a clause in the act that allows employers 
to escape because of "undue hardship," but the paper is a profitable 
metropolitan daily. To invoke the clause might result in a messy and expensive 
lawsuit (and gleeful stories in the competition). Therefore the paper 
reluctantly gives the job to the book editor. From then on, of course, 
relations between management and employee are subtly strained. 
</P>
<P>
In my more cynical moods I ruminate that such a case might make management less 
enthusiastic about hiring deaf applicants for entry-level jobs, because of 
costly potential "reasonable accommodation" demands. Management might hire only 
a few handicapped employees, just enough to showcase in the front window. 
Remember what happened to the people the 1964 Civil Rights Act was supposed to 
empower? 
</P>
<P>
Is my hypothetical example really as extreme as it seems? Maybe not. From time 
to time I have exchanged correspondence with hearing-impaired journalism 
students. Invariably they ask if it was difficult for me to persuade my 
newspaper to hire an interpreter to help me do my job. When I tell them I have 
had none, they are astonished. They have gone through their entire grammar, 
high school and college educations with state-financed interpreters in all 
their classes, and many of them assume that when they go out into the world to 
work, somebody will hire interpreters to work side by side with them. In 
professional journalism that's unlikely to happen, I have told them. Nobody 
wants to hire two people to do the job of one. 
</P>
<P>
Having unburdened myself of this worst-case scenario, I must concede that in 
ordinary practice, "reasonable accommodations" are more likely than not to be 
economical and acceptable to all parties, and a farsighted employer can win 
much goodwill among the handicapped -- in fact, it may even be good for 
business. For instance, the Chicago Sun-Times voluntarily provides me with the 
occasional phone help of an editorial assistant as well as a transcript typist 
a few times a year. The benefit to the paper for the negligible extra expense 
is a wider range of reliable work from an experienced staffer with a well-known 
byline. 
</P>
<P>
I have thought that on some out-of-town assignments I could use a lip-reading 
interpreter. The paper said it would consider as a reasonable expense the 
hiring of a local lip-reading interpreter for $30 or $35 an hour to help me at 
a press conference, noisy social gathering or author interview for two or three 
hours. But my employer would be reluctant to approve an assignment involving 
the expense of a full-time traveling interpreter for several days -- "that 
would shoot hell out of my editorial budget," my boss once said. I have no 
trouble with that; in my case, a full-time interpreter clearly isn't a 
reasonable accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
I have absolutely no qualms over the act's other major provision for the 
hearing-impaired: mandating telephone services for the deaf that are 
functionally equivalent to those provided to the hearing. In fact, it gladdens 
my heart. At the same rates hearing people pay for voice telephone service, the 
deaf will be able to enjoy not only telecommunications devices for the deaf -- 
keyboard-equipped telephones that look like laptop computers -- but also "relay 
services," trained third-party operators who serve as go-betweens for deaf 
users of TDDs and hearing users of voice equipment. These operators will 
provide instantaneous "translations" of messages between the deaf and the 
hearing, much like interpreters in the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
This service will give me a personal and professional communications 
flexibility I've never had. I'll be able to use the TDD the newspaper already 
provides me to make my own phone calls. I won't need to hope that an editorial 
assistant is instantly available. If I'm alone at home, I'll be able to call 
for a pizza, order tickets to the ballet or make medical appointments. That, 
for me, is the real emancipation of the Americans for Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
(It ought to be mentioned that the act also protects the confidentiality of 
relayed calls. If, for example, I should want to wager on a horse with a nearby 
bookie, the go-between operator is enjoined by law from tipping off the cops or 
the IRS.) 
</P>
<P>
Who will pay for these services? The yearly cost is expected to be between $250 
million and $300 million, or about $1.20 per American telephone customer per 
year -- hardly an onerous figure, and one that's likely to be somewhat offset 
by a resulting increase in productivity among deaf workers. It's less an act of 
charity than an investment that offers the promise of being paid back at least 
in part -- and perhaps in full.

ABORTION DISTORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
National political analysts already are calling California's upcoming general 
election the fall's most important state campaign. It is entirely possible, 
however, that November's vote will be reduced to little more than a plebiscite 
on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
All the signs are there to read: The candidates atop the Democratic slate -- 
Dianne Feinstein, Leo T. McCarthy and Arlo Smith are abortion rights advocates; 
the Republican candidates for lieutenant governor and attorney general -- 
Marian Bergeson and Dan Lungren -- are abortion foes. Sen. Pete Wilson is not. 
But his party's national platform opposes abortions except in cases involving a 
threat to the mother's life, rape or incest. 
</P>
<P>
As if the wish were father to the fact, Wilson says abortion is a "dead issue." 
Feinstein has other ideas. Asked about the role gender and abortion rights 
might play in November, she replied, "I think when it comes to that specific 
issue -- which for women is a very emotional one -- it's correct for women to 
believe they are best protected by a woman who is governor." Meanwhile, voters 
polled Tuesday ranked abortion as the second most important issue -- after the 
death penalty -- in deciding how they cast their ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The reductionism of single-issue politics; the exchange of slogans rather than 
debate; an anxious and angry electorate -- these are the consequences of the 
U.S. Supreme Court's flight from responsibility in the Webster case and, 
perhaps, the unfortunate characteristics of the fall campaign.

NOW THE MAT IS OUT FOR SALINAS; 
</P>
<P>
AND IT'S MORE THAN A PERSONAL CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From one Sunday to the next, President Bush is going from one important summit 
meeting to another. Mikhail Gorbachev is gone, but today Washington's welcome 
mat is out for a leader many compare to Gorbachev, because he is also 
transforming a foreign system that impacts the United States in many ways -- 
Mexico's Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
From one Sunday to the next, President Bush is going from one important summit 
meeting to another. Mikhail Gorbachev is gone, but today Washington's welcome 
mat is out for a leader many compare to Gorbachev, because he is also 
transforming a foreign system that impacts the United States in many ways -- 
Mexico's Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, Salinas' three days in Washington are not a state visit, just a 
personal call. But this will be the third time in less than a year he has 
visited this country, just one indication of how much closer -- and better -- 
relations are between Mexico City and Washington these days. Most people 
probably are not aware of that, because it's the problems in the relationship 
that get most of the public attention. Lately the focus is on illegal drugs and 
tensions along the border. But the key issues in the Bush-Salinas meetings will 
be economic. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas wants Bush and other U.S. government leaders to speed negotiations 
toward a U.S.-Mexico free trade agreement, akin to the one between Canada and 
the United States (which took three years to hammer out). Given how 
controversial closer economic ties between the two countries still are to 
Mexican nationalists, the speed with which Salinas is moving towards the pact 
is nothing short of amazing. Little wonder that many of his countrymen refer to 
Salinas' reforms as Salinastroika. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican president wants the free trade pact with the United States -- 
despite all the political risks -- because he's convinced Mexico must change 
its economy more rapidly than Eastern Europe's former Communist governments are 
changing theirs. He was jarred on a recent visit to Europe when he found 
businessmen who once talked of investing in Mexico now more interested in East 
Germany or Hungary. That trip persuaded Salinas that investments to revive 
Mexico's economy and help pay its massive foreign debt had to be found closer 
to home, especially in his country's biggest trading partner, the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, people in this country must not think we can dictate the conditions 
of a free trade pact to Mexico as if we're the only game in town. Because once 
Salinas is finished in Washington, he will return to Mexico City just long 
enough to pack his bags for a visit next week to another foreign country -- 
Japan. The fast-moving Mexican president is not done with Salinastroika yet.

IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO PROSECUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Britain stands alone among the World War II Allied powers in lacking laws to 
prosecute suspected war criminals. If the House of Lords has its way, that's 
how things will stay. 
</P>
<P>
The Lords, who hold their positions by heredity or lifetime political 
appointment, have rejected a bill passed overwhelmingly by the elected House of 
Commons to permit prosecution of suspected war criminals who were not British 
citizens at the time of their alleged crimes. A government-commissioned report 
last year identified three cases of suspected war criminals living in Britain 
in which prosecution was feasible. Another 75 cases were recommended for 
further investigation. This is not an insignificant number of possible war 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the number of potential defendants were far smaller, Britain would be 
remiss if it failed to align itself with its World War II partners, including 
other Commonwealth countries, in enacting a war crimes law. There is no statute 
of limitation on murder. There should be no end point beyond which those who 
took part in unspeakable atrocities in Nazi-occupied Europe and escaped 
punishment should be able to feel that they are beyond the reach of law and 
justice, even 50 years after the fact. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the war crimes bill in the Lords fretted that it would be 
impossible to assure fair trials, citing the difficulty now in finding credible 
witnesses. If that's a plausible reservation, it's also an implicit 
condemnation of Britain for failing to act decades ago to identify, prosecute, 
expel or punish war criminals to whom it unwittingly gave refuge. 
</P>
<P>
It's wrong in any event to hold a war crimes bill hostage to the dubious test 
of whether prosecution would be practical. From the beginning, from the 
Nuremberg trials on, war crimes trials were intended not only to punish the 
guilty but to fix a moral standard for the future. As the years go by, the need 
to emphasize that moral dimension becomes even more compelling. There are 
parliamentary procedures for overriding the House of Lords. The war crimes bill 
is important enough for them to be invoked.

SWITCHEROO MAY MAKE WILSON AN OUTSIDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER MATTHEWS, Christopher Matthews is a syndicated columnist in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California Republicans are trying to pull a switcheroo. It could cost them the 
country's most important election this year. 
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, the California GOP nominated Pete Wilson for the governorship. 
Not Pete Wilson, private citizen, mind you, but Pete Wilson, U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
By running for the governorship without resigning, Wilson has three advantages: 
He gets to hold onto his seat in the Senate and gets a shot at both the 
governor's chair in Sacramento and at the power to decide who becomes the next 
senator from California. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Pete Wilson has hedged his bets. If he loses, he still gets to 
keep the job of senator. 
</P>
<P>
The GOP's Washington-for-Sacramento switcheroo has an added advantage, of 
course. It has the beauty of giving voters a small, but limited role, in the 
process. They get to decide which of the two big jobs, governor or senator, to 
give Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
But beauty lies in eye of the beholder. Voters haven't liked switcheroos in the 
past, and they may like them this year even less. 
</P>
<P>
While it's still early, 1990 is turning out to a bad year for the political 
insider, the familiar face with the familiar name who's gotten a bit too 
familiar with his power and position. That's what we're seeing in the polls. 
It's what we saw in Tuesday's California primary. John Van de Kamp, the 
well-connected attorney general who lost to former San Francisco Mayor Dianne 
Feinstein in the Democratic primary had the endorsement of every liberal group 
that ever held a meeting in California. Feinstein, the self-proclaimed 
outsider, only won the endorsement of the voters. 
</P>
<P>
As the first woman to run for governor of the country's largest state, Democrat 
Feinstein has the potential to energize the outsider vote. 
</P>
<P>
By refusing to resign his seat in the Senate, by refusing to throw his job as 
well as his hat in the ring for governor, Pete Wilson becomes the perfect 
target of a Feinstein juggernaut of outsiders. The more he attacks her for 
being an amateur, the more he will advertise himself as far too much the 
professional, too much the kind of guy who's comfortable pulling a political 
switcheroo.

A MYTH THAT LETS BUTCHERS OFF THE HOOK; 
</P>
<P>
THE MASSACRE WAS NOT IN TIAN AN MEN SQUARE. INSISTING IT WAS GIVES OFFICIALS A 
SMOKE SCREEN. 
</P>

Catch phrases have become the bane of our political culture. "Just say no," 
"read my lips," "the end of history": by oversimplifying reality, they cloud 
our ability to grasp issues in their true depth. How sad to have to add 
"massacre in Tian An Men Square" to the list. 
</P>
<P>
The anniversary of the Beijing slaughter of June 3-4 is now behind us. The 
Bush-Gorbachev summit edged it off the front pages, but there was still a 
healthy stream of commemorative rallies, TV specials and newsmagazine 
retrospectives. All of them, with only minor variations of syntax, paid tribute 
to the students who fell a year ago in "the massacre in Tian An Men Square." 
</P>
<P>
But that is not where the real carnage took place. Amnesty International and 
Asia Watch both agree that the principal killing grounds were some distance 
away, on Changan Avenue and Fuxingmen Boulevard, starting five miles out and 
peaking at the Muxidi intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is how the story was reported at the time. Although 
hundreds of journalists were in Beijing that night, only a handful stayed in 
Tian An Men Square. In the absence of reliable eyewitness accounts, we were 
soon reading lurid tales -- later shown to be spurious -- of students being 
machine-gunned and run down by tanks in the heart of the square. Like Tom 
Hayden, writing in the Los Angeles Times a year ago, we came to believe that 
the Chinese government had done "the equivalent of executing the graduating 
classes at America's top universities." 
</P>
<P>
Robin Munro of Asia Watch, who has observed the pro-democracy movement since 
the late 1970s, remained in the square all night and saw it peacefully 
evacuated by the students at dawn. He estimates that "several dozen died in the 
immediate environs of the square and a few in the square itself." The great 
majority died elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Why does the distinction matter so much? Isn't this just splitting hairs? And 
won't it lend credence to the pernicious revisionist history, now gathering 
steam in some quarters, that says there was no massacre at all? 
</P>
<P>
Some American parallels may help answer the charge of geographical nit-picking. 
A "Times Square massacre" in New York, for example, would actually have taken 
place somewhere between the Brooklyn Bridge and Greenwich Village; a Washington 
"White House massacre" between Arlington and the Pentagon; a Los Angeles "Civic 
Center massacre" between USC and Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
This casual abuse of geography in the service of myth-making is nothing new. 
Teddy Roosevelt's legendary charge up San Juan Hill in 1898 is a good example. 
As in Beijing, few reporters were on the spot to see that T.R.'s Rough Riders 
did not in fact charge up San Juan Hill at all, but up a small nearby rise 
called Kettle Hill. But, as Roosevelt biographer David McCullough comments, 
"San Juan Hill sounded like a better name, a more Spanish name, a more romantic 
and exotic name to the people who were covering that event." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, this argument is about much more than geography. Tian An Men 
Square, in our imagination, means the student demonstrators who were encamped 
there. The students' bravery and idealism were undeniable, but relatively few 
of them died on the night of June 3-4. Most of the 1,000 or so cut down by 
gunfire and crushed by armored vehicles were workers and ordinary Beijing 
residents. These were people who did not speak English, could not quote Patrick 
Henry and built no replicas of the Statue of Liberty. They were also the people 
who terrified Deng Xiaoping. 
</P>
<P>
Under Deng, students have had certain modest privileges. As last year's 
crackdown began, the Chinese Communist Party spoke of having a "tolerant, 
restrained attitude" to what it called "the emotionally excited young 
students." 
</P>
<P>
But once the signs appeared of organized working-class protest -- "the Polish 
disease," Deng and his cohorts call it -- the party decided on an exemplary 
display of terror that would silence mass dissent for a generation. That was 
why the army killed as it did, whom it did and where it did. 
</P>
<P>
As long as we substitute myth for fact, the butchers of Beijing will wriggle 
off the hook. When Barbara Walters, on ABC's "20/20," asked party general 
secretary Jiang Zemin about "the massacre in Tian An Men Square," he replied, 
with a sly use of the English idiom, that it was "much ado about nothing." But 
what if Walters had asked Jiang about the slaughter of workers at Muxidi?

Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
Last week, in a Detroit suburb, Dr. Jack Kevorkian climbed into his Volkswagen 
van with 54-year-old Janet Adkins and drove off to a public park. There, he 
hooked up Adkins, who suffered from early Alzheimer's, to his homemade suicide 
machine. A syringe in her arm, Adkins pushed a button that sent two fluids into 
her body. One left her unconscious, the second stopped her heart. Her last act, 
said Kevorkian, was to rise as though to kiss him, and say, "Thank you, thank 
you, thank you." A modern love story. 
</P>
<P>
Kevorkian's lone regret: The dawdling medical examiner did not rush Adkins' 
body to a hospital. "You could have sliced her liver in half," he said, "and 
saved two babies and her bone marrow could have been taken, her heart, two 
kidneys, two lungs, a pancreas." 
</P>
<P>
Good old Doc Kevorkian, always thinking of somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
While commentators are saying that Kevorkian has re-ignited the "debate" over 
the "right to die," there really is no debate. There are just two schools of 
irreconcilable thought, whose adherents talk past one another. The first 
believes that all men are "endowed by their Creator" with "inalienable rights," 
and among these is the "right to life." The second holds that, as there is a 
right to live, so there is a right to die, that some lives are not worth living 
and that rational men and women, in a democratic society, can make these 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
While it is easy to recoil at the seeming callousness of Kevorkian, it is hard 
to deny he is on the cutting edge of social change. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years ago, Americans argued over whether it was moral for a woman whose 
fetus had been deformed by thalidomide to have an abortion. Now abortion is a 
constitutional right -- 25 million have been performed -- and now we argue over 
the morality of denying food and water to deformed infants. Few may acknowledge 
it, but we are far along in a process that is altering the character of our 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
The first, critical step was to deny that all life is a gift from God, and that 
no man can take it; and to assert, instead, our right to decide when a human 
being is a "person." We did that in Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
The second step was to assert that some persons are better off dead, such as 
comatose accident victims whose agonized loved ones want to stop the feeding. 
</P>
<P>
The third step is to assert a "right to die," and a concomitant duty to assist 
individuals who seek to exercise it. This is the position of Dr. Kevorkian and 
the Hemlock Society, and it leads logically to step four: 
</P>
<P>
If it is reasonable for someone to choose death, is it not equally reasonable 
for us to choose it for those who cannot make the decision themselves, i.e., 
the incurably insane and terminally ill who do not enjoy even the quality of 
life of Janet Adkins, who could play tennis right up until she got into that 
van? 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, if a lethal injection is the dignified way out for Adkins, why is it 
not also a dignified way out for the homeless, who, enfeebled, rummage through 
garbage cans for food? (To quote Dr. Kevorkian, "What kind of life is that?") 
And, if Adkins' decision was rational, why is it not equally rational to ask 
all those with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and terminal cancer to consider the 
same "final option." Perhaps Kevorkian has, in his machine, the final solution 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
We are not far away from entertaining such ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Some environmentalists applaud China's one-couple, one-child policy, where 
forced abortions and the killing of female infants are common. In California, 
Dianne Feinstein, candidate for governor, was forced by a feminist inquisition 
to recant her view that abortion for sex selection should be restricted. Fetal 
farming -- pregnancies and abortions to give us spare parts for research and 
sick patients -- is openly discussed. 
</P>
<P>
Once all the other frontiers have been crossed, the final one is the great leap 
forward by the state, when it declares that, just as a mother has the right to 
terminate the life of her unborn, just as loved ones have the right to pull the 
plug, so the state has a right to rid itself of those who threaten the social 
organism. 
</P>
<P>
Inexorably, we reach the fundamental question: 
</P>
<P>
Is there a higher law -- call it God's law or natural law -- to which man-made 
law must conform? And if no higher law exists, upon what moral ground did we 
stand to condemn the German doctors whose "crimes against humanity" consisted 
only of doing to the feebleminded exactly what we seek to do today?

ART NOTEBOOK: BRIGHT IDEA PUTS GALLERY'S SPOTLIGHT ON ARTISTS' LAMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISBET NILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In January, 1989, Greg Moul decided that he wanted to shed some light on art 
and design. Operating from the hunch that more artists would create lighting 
fixtures or otherwise begin working with the medium of electric illumination, 
Moul opened a gallery named See the Light. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the gallery unveiled a small ebony-stained exhibition space called 
the Darkroom, which features changing shows of lamps and other illuminating 
fixtures by the gallery's 30 light artists and craftsmen, most of whom hail 
from Santa Monica or Venice. 
</P>
<P>
On view through July 27 is the work of Michael Murphy, a former glazier, who 
uses architectural glass -- thicker, more industrial than its art-glass 
counterparts -- for his lamps and lit tables. 
</P>
<P>
Employing a custom-made computerized kiln to shape glass and fuse it with other 
materials, Murphy introduces copper mesh, copper shavings and other ground 
metals, such as bronze and silver, into his glass with unusual painterly 
effect. When heated to high temperatures, the metals bleed to pigmentlike reds, 
yellows or blacks. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Italy has predominated in the lighting field, Moul said, producing 
75% to 80% of all new designs either directly or indirectly. "But now the new 
ideas that are happening in lighting are coming from the crafts-artisan-artist 
community in the United States," he said. Having run a lighting factory, Moul 
is also in a position to help his artists with the technical realization of 
lighting projects when necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Murphy, through July 27 at See the Light, 1337 W. Washington Blvd., 
Venice. (213) 396-9442. Open Friday through Sunday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. and 
Thursday 3 to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW VENUE: The parameters of Santa Monica's gallery district are constantly 
spreading. The Koplin Gallery, for instance, just moved to a converted 9th 
Street warehouse. And it will be sharing the space with a new venture, the 
Sherry Frumkin Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
A collector who has long been politically active, Frumkin will officially open 
her 3,000-square-foot gallery June 22 with a group show introducing the 
gallery's artists. The art that will be shown, she said, consists of "very 
contemporary painting and sculpture, mainly by American artists -- many of whom 
have a social conscience and a political sensibility that is very appealing to 
me." The work does not, however, tend to be heavily didactic, Frumkin added. 
</P>
<P>
Among the artists represented, she said, are Kay Miller, a politically involved 
American Indian who lives in Colorado; David Bradley, a contemporary Navajo 
painter who might appropriate naive imagery from Henri Rousseau and juxtapose 
it with depictions of Indian life, complete with bulldozers, tourist gas 
guzzlers and trading posts advertising liquor, real estate and adoptions; and 
Phyllis Daniels, a local figurative painter who depicts her subjects against 
the backdrop of actual graffiti she has seen in her West Los Angeles 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
On June 16, a silent auction and dinner to benefit the Office of the Americas 
-- a Los Angeles-based nonprofit educational organization dedicated to 
furthering justice and peace -- will be held at the gallery. For sale will be 
hand-colored photographs of Nicaragua taken by the actor Rene Auberjonois while 
on location for the film "Walker." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Frumkin Gallery, 1440 9th St., Santa Monica. (213) 393-1853. 
(Information and reservations for the Office of the Americas event, (213) 
852-9808.) Inaugural reception for the artists, June 22, 7 to 10 p.m. Gallery 
hours will be Tuesday through Saturday, 10 a.m to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 CALABASAS WESTERN: A benign trading-post atmosphere prevails at the Red River 
Gallery in Calabasas, a homey and eclectic locus for traditional Western art 
(mainly of the contemporary stripe) that also keeps a door open for local 
community hobnobbing. 
</P>
<P>
Run by John Sullivan, who traces his love of Western art to an uncle who still 
is a practicing cowboy, the gallery holds revolving shows every two or three 
months for its artists, who live in Idaho, Montana, Arizona, New Mexico and 
Hawaii, as well as in the Los Angeles area. (Also available at the gallery -- 
which is named for the classic John Wayne film "Red River" -- are original 
Western movie posters.) 
</P>
<P>
Among the works on view are highly stylized opaque watercolors by the Navajo 
painter Justin Hso. His work often features symbolic imagery of his tribe -- 
such as gray "shadow riders" that appear in many backgrounds, representing 
ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
" 'L.A.'s not known as a Western art town," Sullivan said. "Let's just say that 
it's a hard sell -- but I like it. We just try to be real friendly with the 
people, to give out information and talk to them when they come in and look." 
</P>
<P>
The gallery also is the focus for various other activities. It recently 
inaugurated a petition drive to conserve the historic Leonis Adobe across the 
street, which is being threatened by proposed CalTrans road improvements. And 
later this summer, Alice Segin -- sister-in-law of painter Justin Hso -- will 
teach a class in traditional Navajo weaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Red River Gallery, 23564 Calabasas Road, Calabasas. (818) 710-0027. Open noon 
to 5:30 p.m. Wednesdays through Sundays.

THE JAZZ ROOM THAT ALMOST WASN'T; 
</P>
<P>
FIRST-CLASS MUSIC FILLS FITZGERALD'S, A NEW CLUB BUILT AS A DISCO THAT'S BEEN 
KNOWN BY 3 NAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jazz rooms usually take awhile to get established, but Fitzgerald's, the newly 
opened nightspot ensconced in a corner of the also new Warner Center Hilton 
Hotel and Towers in Woodland Hills, may be an exception to the rule. 
</P>
<P>
Take a recent Friday. At a little after 7 p.m., Fitzgerald's was only about 
half full. Pianist John Hammond's trio had already played a set for the happy 
hour gang and was heading back to the bandstand with a quintet that included 
saxophonist Pete Christlieb of the "Tonight Show" orchestra, and crack 
trumpeter Steve Huffsteter. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time the fivesome returned to the stand for its last performance 
about 11:30 p.m., the joint was jammed with enthusiastic listeners. 
</P>
<P>
One was Lil Finan, a retired attorney and former blues singer who gave her age 
as "way past the age of consent." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a widow and this music, this place, it makes me forget I'm sad, makes me 
feel that the world isn't so terrible after all," she said as the group romped 
through a snappy rendition of the standard, "Star Eyes." "I keep coming back," 
added Finan from her spot in the back of the room that seats about 90 people 
comfortably. "I live in the area and usually don't like nightclubs, but this 
one is definitely not a drag." 
</P>
<P>
The first-class music is the reason for the fast-growing popularity of 
Fitzgerald's, where buoyant sounds provided by Hammond, the room's musical 
director, and his various cohorts is on the schedule Tuesday through Saturday 
at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
A good example was the group's perky version of "Stella by Starlight," in which 
Hammond's dark touch accompanied gutsy jazz soloing from Christlieb, who was 
subbing for the fivesome's regular reedman, Ray Pizzi. The efforts of the tall 
tenor drew more than moderate applause. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd come back to see these guys because they're solid," said Ron Ramelli, 37, 
retail advertising manager for BAM magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Ramelli, who lives in nearby West Hills, listed three of Fitzgerald's strong 
points: location, location, location. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing like it around here," he said. "Alfonse's -- the defunct North 
Hollywood club that has reopened as M.K.'S P.O.V. -- was really far from here." 
The nearest jazz clubs to Fitzgerald's would be Monteleone's West in Encino and 
LeCafe in Sherman Oaks, neither of which spotlights the variety of instrumental 
mainstream jazz that Fitzgerald's offers. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald's is the jazz room that wasn't supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
These days, many hotels focus their lounge business on dancing and the Warner 
Center Hilton Fitzgerald's was no different: It was built to be a disco. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald's is square-shaped and two-tiered, with an open center so those on 
the upper level could see the dancers below. It's got those little glimmer 
lights strung in straight strings around the upper edges of the lower room, and 
there's a dandy parqueted dance floor that now sits well-protected under thick 
carpeting. 
</P>
<P>
But in a rare turn of events, disco was not meant to be the thing at the Warner 
Center Hilton -- jazz was. 
</P>
<P>
"When we discovered that there were plenty of established discos in the area, 
including the nearby Red Onion and Tickets in Warner Center Marriott, we 
decided we wanted to go with something different," said Charles L'Episcopo, 38, 
the hotel's food and beverage director. "We wanted to attract a different age 
group than goes to discos, and wanted to do something for the hotel guests that 
keeps them in the hotel." 
</P>
<P>
(According to L'Episcopo, the Warner Center Hilton is a business hotel that 
attracts a clientele in the 35- to 48-age demographic.) 
</P>
<P>
Cue John Hammond. 
</P>
<P>
"I live in the area and went down there, just after the hotel had opened in 
November, to see what was happening," said the pianist, an energetic 
48-year-old Houston native. "The management told me they had a lounge and I 
felt that would be an ideal place for a jazz club. 
</P>
<P>
"This community is really coming into its own and I felt there was a real need 
for jazz out here," said Hammond of the West Valley area that includes Woodland 
Hills, Chatsworth, Calabasas and West Hills, where Hammond, his wife, Winnie, 
and their two children reside. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides," he added with a chuckle, "I wanted to step out of the accompany role 
and do something on my own." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Hammond, who grew up in Texas and was headed for a career as a 
concert artist when jazz grabbed his ear, played solo piano in the hotel's 
lobby. Then, after the hotel's top management team had heard a brief, informal 
set by a Hammond quartet featuring Pizzi in early January, plans were begun to 
turn Fitzgerald's into a jazz club. 
</P>
<P>
"We all thought John and the band sounded great, that jazz offered the kind of 
market we wanted to cater to," said LePiscopo, himself a jazz fan. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald's opened March 2. Until recently, the room was called Roxy's, but 
attorneys for The Roxy, the well-known Sunset Strip nightclub, threatened to 
sue the hotel to have the name changed, according to Charles L'Episcopo, the 
hotel's food and beverage director. For about two weeks, it was informally 
called Oxy's before it became Fitzgerald's. Representatives of The Roxy did not 
return phone calls to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The name Fitzgerald's was suggested by the hotel's general manager Jose 
Montilla. "We were looking for a name that fit the hotel's image, which I see 
as Art Deco, and which wasn't related to any particular type of music, Montilla 
said. "Fitzgerald's was ideal since it covers a wide area: It could be 
interpreted as meaning F. Scott Fitzgerald the writer, or Ella Fitzgerald, the 
jazz singer." 
</P>
<P>
A no cover-no minimum policy is in effect at Fitzgerald's. There's a full bar, 
with well drinks priced at $3.50 and call and premium brands, $4 to $5. Beers, 
available on tap and in bottles, range from $2.25 to $3.50, and wine by the 
glass costs $3.50. In addition to a free happy hour buffet from 5 to 7:30 p.m. 
Tuesday through Friday, appetizers -- potato skins, pot stickers, etc. -- and 
sandwiches -- BLT, French dip, pub burger etc. -- are served until 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
While Hammond was in high spirits over the way things are taking shape at 
Fitzgerald's, LePiscopo was a tad less vociferous. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thrilled with the way it's going," Hammond said. "I find we're getting a 
lot of reaction from young people saying, 'We've never heard anything like this 
before.' They're the ones that are cheering the loudest. All in all, people 
seem to be ready for this." 
</P>
<P>
"It's doing well. It's successful from the standpoint that people who do come, 
enjoy it," LePiscopo said. "Certainly, I would like to see more people, because 
the more seats we fill, the closer we are to showing a reasonable profit. Right 
now, we're at maybe a break-even situation. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm very happy with what John's doing musically. It's excellent."

I hate Chris Willman! How could he write such a bad review of New Kids on the 
Block's album "Step by Step" (June 3)? I've heard three of the songs on the 
album and it already sounds like a hit to me! New Kids must be "all right" if 
they are No. 20 on the pop chart already! 
</P>
<P>
New Kids make music that teen-agers can relate to! That's not all! My mom 
happens to love them. 
</P>
<P>
Why don't you go to a concert and see how many adults go with their kids. My 
mom would never be caught dead at one of my brother's Metallica concerts! 
</P>
<P>
Next time you write a review on them, remember, New Kids rule! And people will 
always stick up for them!

THE LOST GENERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For those who missed Peter Rainer's article "Hollywood's Lost Generation of 
Women" (June 3), I suggest that you search your newspaper piles to find it; it 
raises some vital concerns about women in Hollywood today. Rainer addresses the 
reasons why talented actresses are faced with such flat, sexist roles. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the article, Rainer offers some insight into why this tragedy is 
sweeping Hollywood. Hollywood does not want and does not know how to approach 
women's issues. 
</P>
<P>
It is absolutely insulting for Hollywood to assume that people won't want to 
see funny, intelligent, sensitive women in action. Why can't they ask 
themselves, "You mean there are extraordinary women of today and yesterday?" 
Yes! Women of all different colors, sizes and backgrounds who have shaken the 
world unnoticed. If we can't learn of women heroines in the classroom, 
Hollywood should consider its position to educate in society. 
</P>
<P>
It was to my distress this weekend that I could not find one film I could drag 
myself to see, and Rainer's article helps to examine why Hollywood's summer 
lineup lacks integrity. I do not want to see a sequel, or violent images of men 
in grease paint shooting everywhere to save humanity. Is it really too much to 
ask? I want to see a film, one that does not depict women as only Barbie doll 
hookers, money-hungry sex machines, or murderous villainettes. 
</P>
<P>
Please, give actresses a choice, and give us a break. I think for now, like 
Rainer, we'll have to wait.

THE LOST GENERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's ironic that in this era of women's liberation that actresses are 
experiencing a low ebb, often playing second fiddle to their male counterparts. 
Even when they do have starring roles, they are often reduced to playing 
hookers, murderers and lunatics. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is that the movie studios are male dominated, and they view 
the female artform as having little utility beyond physical beauty and sex. 
</P>
<P>
But another part of the problem is with the actresses themselves, as they often 
act like just a bunch of cowardly wimps, intimidated by these movie moguls, 
afraid to stand up for their rights and demand better roles. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, if only we could bring back Davis, Crawford and Stanwyck, who would scream, 
fight, kick, cajole and threaten until they got the type of role they felt they 
deserved and were entitled to. Some say they did their best acting off the 
screen.

ANDREW DICE CLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding: "To Brooklyn in Search of the Real Andrew Dice Clay" (by Patrick 
Goldstein, June 3): 
</P>
<P>
A very pretty portrait for your June 2 cover -- misogynistic bigot with 
fiancee. And such a sensitive young thing he turns out to be, only awful, 
really, when the eyes of the world are on him, and only then when he needs the 
money for his family. Heartwarming. 
</P>
<P>
Now that you are shamelessly in bed with Andrew Silverstein, I await your 
apologia for 2 Live Crew, Chuck D and N.W.A. Once you offer the 
poor-misunderstood-performer excuse for Silverstein, it seems that you're 
equally committed to shifting the focus of your rap lyric coverage from First 
Amendment rights to human interest. Or don't you bend over backwards to pander 
to hatred unless it's got the full force of a major studio publicity department 
behind it? 
</P>
<P>
I've got a suggestion for another cover story -- those shiny metal silhouettes 
of nude women that are so popular on the mud flaps of trucks. Better yet, how 
about a feature about mud flaps, or, even more to the point, about mud?

SHAMIR FORMS FAR-RIGHT COALITION TO RULE ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
JERUSALEM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir formed the most right-wing coalition in Israeli 
history Friday and said its top priority would be Jewish emigration from the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
After protracted last-minute wrangling, seven right-wing and religious parties 
and three independent members of the Knesset signed a coalition accord that 
calls for expanded Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
The accord came 12 weeks after the dovish Labor Party brought down a national 
unity government over Shamir's refusal to accept U.S. proposals for 
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
The new government, which claims the backing of 62 members of the 120-seat 
Knesset, will seek a vote of confidence Monday. But political sources said the 
coalition was highly unstable and unlikely to last long. 
</P>
<P>
Once it takes office, Shamir could quickly become a prisoner of hawks in his 
own party, of ultraorthodox rabbis, and what one aide described as "right-wing 
crazies." 
</P>
<P>
The pressures may drive him to seek early elections or a renewed unity 
government with Labor, political sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult if you only have a narrow majority and you can be 
blackmailed on every parliamentary vote. There will be three crises a week in 
this coalition," a seasoned Cabinet official said. 
</P>
<P>
The unpopularity of the new government, which opinion polls showed only 14% of 
Israelis wanted, could also increase public pressure for a reform of an 
electoral system that gives fringe parties the balance of power. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever government is formed, it is clear that Israel's political system is 
rotten to the core," political commentator Yeshayahu Ben-Porat wrote in the 
mass-circulation Yedioth Ahronoth. The newspaper Maariv, in an editorial, 
lambasted the country's politicians as "pigs, pimps and prostitutes." 
</P>
<P>
An exhausted-looking Shamir, 74, toasted his new coalition as "a national 
government that will conduct affairs of state during a tough period with many 
dangers." 
</P>
<P>
But even after signing the pact, religious parties continued to haggle for 
control of the ministries of religion and education. 
</P>
<P>
"The government's main effort will be on the most important matter in our lives 
today -- the mass immigration flowing into the country and the absorption (of 
immigrants)," Shamir said. 
</P>
<P>
Israel expects up to 250,000 Soviet Jews to arrive this year and Jewish Agency 
officials disclosed last week that about 1.1 million Soviet Jews had received 
immigration visas. 
</P>
<P>
If it holds, the Cabinet will be dominated by opponents of peace talks with the 
Palestinians and advocates of increased Jewish settlement in the occupied 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
Political commentators said it could set Israel on a collision course with the 
United States, its guardian ally. 
</P>
<P>
"Barring a miracle, Shamir will find himself in direct conflict with the United 
States, the Soviet Union, Europe, the Palestinians and the Arab world," 
diplomatic commentator Akiva Eldar wrote in the Haaretz newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition's policy guidelines said the new government would work to 
"strengthen, expand and develop" Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank 
and Gaza Strip, the biggest source of friction between Israel and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Settlement in all parts of the land of Israel is the right of the Jewish 
people and an inseparable part of national security," the document said. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir said he had not finalized Cabinet posts, but sources in his Likud party 
said a troika of hard-liners -- David Levy, Ariel Sharon and Yitzhak Modai -- 
would receive the key ministries of foreign affairs, housing and finance. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon, architect of Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon and the most 
controversial figure in modern Israeli politics, will have overall control of 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed the "constraints ministers," the trio forced Shamir last July to accept 
hard-line restrictions on his government's peace initiative for Palestinian 
elections leading to self-rule in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy guidelines reaffirmed that plan, but added one key constraint -- 
ruling out Palestinian elections or autonomy in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem.

WOMAN SEES SATANISM IN CHILD-ABUSE CASES; 
</P>
<P>
SHELTER: SHE OPERATES AN UNDERGROUND NETWORK TO HIDE YOUNGSTERS FROM ALLEGEDLY 
ABUSIVE PARENTS. CRITICS CHARGE SHE'S OPERATING OUTSIDE THE LAW.

<P>
In the view of children's rights crusader Faye Yager, a shadowy, satanic 
brotherhood manipulates the nation's courts, haunts the police and allows 
children to suffer unspeakable evil. 
</P>
<P>
A 30-room English Tudor mansion -- complete with housekeeper, gardener and 
Rolls-Royce parked outside -- protects Yager from that world. 
</P>
<P>
Her home is the headquarters of an underground network through which, she says, 
thousands of volunteers in 50 states have hidden hundreds of children from 
abusive parents. 
</P>
<P>
Police came to the house in April with a search warrant, looking for files or 
videotapes to back up a Florida woman's claim that Yager had tried to browbeat 
the woman's children into accusing their father of satanism and abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Since Yager's arrest April 14 on charges related to that complaint, Cobb County 
police have received calls from throughout the country, many on behalf of 
fathers who hope the network will be dismantled and their missing children 
returned, police Lt. Robert Pittman said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very frustrating to a father who's been cleared of any wrongdoing 
whatsoever to know there's a nationwide organization whose avowed purpose is to 
remove children from the jurisdiction of our courts," said Thomas A. Massey, an 
Evansville, Ind., attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Massey represents John Rademacher, whose ex-wife and 8-year-old daughter, Sara, 
have been missing since last November, presumably hidden through Yager's 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities seized about 40 files and tapes from Yager's home, but she said the 
network was not exposed by the search. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not stupid. I don't keep anything that's going to lead to any kids, but 
they don't know that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Yager, a 40-year-old former interior designer, started Children of the 
Underground three years ago for the purpose of sheltering abused youngsters she 
believes have been abandoned by the court system. She estimates she has helped 
500 families or more, with one to six children each. 
</P>
<P>
The case against Yager, expected to be argued before a grand jury this summer, 
involves a Florida woman who said she asked the organization for protection 
because her husband physically abused her, their 8-year-old daughter and 
10-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
Yager is charged with kidnaping the boy and subjecting him to cruel verbal 
treatment; a kidnaping charge involving the girl later was reduced to 
interfering with the custody of a child. 
</P>
<P>
Police contend that Yager threatened to send the children back to their father, 
who she said would beat them, if they refused to make accusations against him. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb County Dist. Atty. Tom Charron described Yager as a woman of good 
intentions who has become obsessed. 
</P>
<P>
Yager denies the criminal charges, but does not entirely disagree with 
Charron's assessment of her. 
</P>
<P>
"I am obsessed," she conceded in an interview at her home in affluent Sandy 
Springs in suburban Atlanta. "I'm obsessed with a legal system, a system 
designed to protect that destroys. I'm obsessed with this cult business that is 
allowed to operate. These people are Ozzie and Harriet by day, and get away 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
She claims that many prominent lawyers and judges are "generational satanists" 
brought up to believe in Satan. 
</P>
<P>
In her basement files, records involving "cult" cases are earmarked with bright 
orange tabs. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in a room filled with antiques, she strings together story after story 
of children who say they were abused, many by fathers or relatives involved in 
occult activities. In a voice often just above a whisper, she tells of girls 
used as Satanic "breeders" to produce babies for their tormentors to sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
At times, she stops to introduce a grandmother who works with the network, or 
to chat with an abused teen-ager who is among her house guests. 
</P>
<P>
The case against her, Yager said, never will go to trial. She said that police 
and FBI agents assisting in the investigation are harassing her family and 
trying to destroy her credibility, especially among law enforcement officials 
who have trusted her. 
</P>
<P>
"My credibility has been tarnished, tarred and feathered. I've been slandered," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her history with Cobb County authorities dates back to 1973, when the courts 
awarded custody of her own daughter, Michelle, to the child's father, Roger Lee 
Jones, even though Yager claimed he had sexually abused the girl. 
</P>
<P>
She launched her underground crusade in 1987, the year after Jones was indicted 
on nine counts of child molestation involving three minors in Venice, Fla. He 
still awaits trial on the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Memories of what happened to her daughter, who now lives with Yager and her 
current husband, keep her bent on helping other children, she said. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agent Jeff Holmes accompanied police in the search of Yager's house a few 
days after her arrest, but won't say whether the FBI has undertaken a broad 
investigation of the network. 
</P>
<P>
Charron said that until the missing children are found or their locations are 
revealed, authorities can do nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Until you have the children or proof of where they are, you don't have the 
elements of a crime," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Any broad action involving the network would be up to the FBI because Cobb 
County has limited jurisdiction, Charron said. 
</P>
<P>
Yager's detractors say she is a media princess carried away with publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Denise Gooch, a founder with Yager of the nationwide organization Mothers 
Alliance for the Rights of Children, described her as a "reporter's dream and a 
parent's nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
She was asked to leave because of philosophical differences and began her own 
network the same year, said another founder, Sarah King. 
</P>
<P>
Yager admits she doesn't shun attention. 
</P>
<P>
Her gardener drove her to a preliminary hearing in her husband's Rolls-Royce. 
She wore a hat, a floral print dress and a corsage. She listened as her 
attorney told the judge she should not pay court costs because she is indigent. 
</P>
<P>
"Howard Yager doesn't have to pay for attorneys for his wife. I have no 
income," she said, adding that she transferred her property and money to her 
husband's name before she started the underground. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have criticized Yager's interview techniques with children. They 
say she intimidates them and often brings up the subject of satanism. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not objective," said Pittman, the Cobb County police lieutenant. "We 
feel she intimidates the child into saying things that aren't true." 
</P>
<P>
Some videotapes, Pittman said, show Yager "screaming and hollering at kids, 
threatening to send them back into an abusive situation." 
</P>
<P>
Yager, who has the children sit in a high-backed Renaissance-style chair in her 
library while she videotapes them, denied she is abusive. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very blunt about things," she said. "I tell them, 'You're at the end of 
the road. If I can't help you, not many people out there are going to.' " 
</P>
<P>
She also denied bringing up satanism. She said: "I don't want to believe things 
like that are going on. I'm being forced to believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Helen Russell, a friend who has watched some of the interviews, defended 
Yager's style and her ideas about cults. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't it easier to think one woman is crazy," Russell asked, "than to think 
our society has gotten so perverted?"

KREMLIN SPIN DOCTOR POZNER CONFESSES HE WAS OFTEN THROWING CURVES; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET: THE U.S.-REARED JOURNALIST'S CONFESSION OF PAST DISHONESTY INVITES 
SKEPTICISM. RESENTMENT OF ORTHODOX COMMUNISTS RUNS HIGH IN THE EAST BLOC. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vladimir Pozner, the Soviet journalist who for years was an apologist for the 
Kremlin on American television, is making an apology of his own. 
</P>
<P>
With his perfect English and knowledge of all things American, from Joe 
DiMaggio's batting average to brands of breakfast cereal, Pozner was the first 
Soviet commentator able to put the Kremlin's spin on events without turning 
Americans off. 
</P>
<P>
He is proud of his efforts during the 1980s to counter what he calls "enemy 
images" of angry, boorish, downtrodden and dangerous Russians -- of Nikita S. 
Khrushchev banging his shoe and Leonid I. Brezhnev slurring his speech, crowds 
queuing for food and tanks crossing Red Square. 
</P>
<P>
Although he insists he should not be considered an "official" Soviet spokesman, 
he is pleased to be known throughout America as an embodiment of the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
In short, he believes he's done a lot of good. 
</P>
<P>
So why should he feel bad? 
</P>
<P>
Because, he admits in his new autobiography, "Parting With Illusions," he said 
many things he didn't believe -- and didn't have the courage to say some things 
he believed strongly. 
</P>
<P>
In commentaries broadcast around the world by Moscow radio and appearances on 
such American television shows as ABC's "Nightline," he excused the Warsaw Pact 
invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, endorsed the internal exile of Andrei 
Sakharov in 1980, idealized the accomplishments of the Soviet economy and sang 
phony paeans to justice in a communist society. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did I do this? Some things I did not see, and others I did not want to 
see," he said in an interview in New York. " . . . It was very painful to come 
to the realization that I was trying to defend things that really weren't 
defendable." 
</P>
<P>
To many Americans, Pozner's confession that he was not completely honest with 
his listeners, or with himself, will come as little surprise. He never has 
lacked critics or doubters here. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of his admission -- in a period when the Kremlin is encouraging 
self-criticism and historical revision -- also invites skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, such a confession could have landed him in jail and would have 
been courageous. But now that resentment against orthodox communists is running 
high in the East Bloc, his admission of past ideological impurity appears 
useful, even necessary, to his career. 
</P>
<P>
Pozner, confident and sharp-witted at age 56, knows that for these reasons, his 
apology might not meet rapid acceptance in either the Soviet Union or the 
United States. But he is undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
He has trumpeted the confession in his autobiography, published this spring by 
the Atlantic Monthly Press. 
</P>
<P>
The book recounts Pozner's childhood in New York City, where he learned to love 
the Brooklyn Dodgers, Pete Seeger and Mark Twain. His mother was French, his 
father a Russian emigre who earned a handsome salary in the American film 
industry but remained a devoted communist and never gave up his Soviet 
citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a classic American boyhood -- paper route, baseball games, summer camp 
-- Pozner says he never felt fully American. Other kids at Stuyvesant High 
School thought of him as Russian. For a while, he thought of himself as French. 
</P>
<P>
When his father lost his job because of his communist sympathies in the late 
1940s, the teen-age Pozner stayed with his family as it headed for the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
They went first to war-ravaged Berlin, where his father grew impatient with a 
Soviet diplomat who found one excuse after another to delay the family's 
permission to go to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Only much later, Pozner says, did he and his family realize that the diplomat 
had been trying to protect them from Josef Stalin, who feared the influence of 
Russians with experience in the West. 
</P>
<P>
"Had we arrived in the Soviet Union any earlier than we did, there is little 
doubt that we would all have ended up in one of the Gulag camps," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
As it happened, Stalin died not long after the family members arrived in Moscow 
in 1952, and they were spared. Vladimir studied at Moscow University and 
managed to apprentice himself to Samuel Marshak, perhaps Russia's greatest 
translator of English literature. Later, he broke into journalism and became a 
commentator for Moscow radio. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he works for the state television network, hosting two talk shows. At 
the very start of his career, Pozner says, he made a promise to himself that he 
would not lie.

"I made that promise in all honesty, but I cannot honestly say I kept it," he 
says in the book. "It was not that I deliberately misinformed my audience. 
Rather, I censored my statements, I deleted passages that could be threatening 
to me, I rarely spoke my mind fully. 
</P>
<P>
"More than once I questioned what was really influencing my decisions -- fear 
for myself and my family's well-being, the desire not to furnish the 'enemy' 
with ammunition, a false sense of patriotism, or a real lack of courage? 
Probably, a bit of each." 
</P>
<P>
The book, written in a conversational tone, mixes political arguments with 
personal recollections, sometimes switching abruptly from one to the other as 
it charts Pozner's two marriages, his rise through the ranks of Soviet 
journalists, a bout of depression and heavy drinking in 1977, and his success 
in the Western media. 
</P>
<P>
The final chapter is about his recent shedding of communist ideology, the 
"parting with illusions" to which the title refers. A skeptical reader might 
view this as a politically expedient conversion to Gorbachevism. 
</P>
<P>
Pozner, however, makes no mention of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 
his concluding pages. He pays tribute instead to Sakharov -- the man he once 
publicly reviled -- as an inspiration to courage. 
</P>
<P>
One of the great ironies of Pozner's life is that because he was Russian, he 
never felt fully at home in America, but because of his American upbringing, he 
has not felt completely comfortable in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
"That I wanted to be involved in bringing these two countries together as much 
as possible should not be surprising," he said, "because although I don't feel 
totally comfortable in either of them, I am part of each."

PRIEST-TURNED-WARDEN PRAISES TOP-SECURITY FEDERAL PENITENTIARY

<TEXT>
<P>
In 20 years of prison work, the only time John L. Clark was assaulted was when 
he was a Roman Catholic priest. 
</P>
<P>
"So much for the image of prisons and priests," said Clark, who has been warden 
of the maximum-security federal penitentiary here since January. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been spat on a few times, but never assaulted working in corrections," 
said Clark, who left the priesthood to marry in 1974 and began his corrections 
career in the same year. "My only assault was when I was a chaplain in a mental 
hospital." 
</P>
<P>
The prison at Marion, the federal system's only Level 6 penitentiary, is 
roughly what Alcatraz was until it was closed in the 1960s. It is home to what 
officials call the "predators," 400 convicts considered incorrigible. 
</P>
<P>
It contains a few famous criminals, such as Colombian drug smuggler Carlos 
Lehder and American spies Jonathan Pollard and John Walker Jr. Mostly, it holds 
the baddest of the bad: inmates that other federal and state prisons cannot 
handle. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, 47, is informal and talkative, very aware of public relations and matter 
of fact about being a priest turned jailer. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of any time I've had to make a choice between any ideal that I 
have and some operational decision we had to make in prison," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This is Clark's second tour of duty at Marion. He has been transferred seven 
times since he joined what he calls the federal prisons "merry-go-round" 16 
years ago. He holds two master's degrees and believes in corrections -- Marion 
style. 
</P>
<P>
"People say Marion is inhumane. I say, put in the larger context, it makes the 
whole system operate in a more humane fashion," Clark said, because "inmates in 
other institutions can go to bed at night with both eyes closed because these 
people are here." 
</P>
<P>
The average stay at Marion is three years, Clark said. Every inmate has his own 
cell -- and every cell has a television. It's probably the only prison in the 
nation that is not overcrowded. Some prisoners are confined to their cells 22 
hours a day; the rest have a bit more freedom, but not much. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have said that Marion's strict regimen has forced the 50-odd other 
federal correctional institutions to be tougher, but Clark disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"As a system we don't run this kind of restrictive operation," Clark said. "For 
the most part, we take more criticism for being so open and liberal in the way 
we run our prisons." 
</P>
<P>
Clark said that Marion is a model for many state prisons and that it will "go 
down in the annals of corrections as an historic development." Marion, he said, 
is the system's safety valve. 
</P>
<P>
"The federal system has 55,000 prisoners, and had only 24,000 in 1981," Clark 
said. "That increase is happening at the state level, too, and you hear of 
inmates dominating some facilities. It's not happening at the federal level, 
and one reason is Marion. 
</P>
<P>
"They (inmates) go out to other prisons. They don't get in trouble and they 
don't come back to Marion," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
The penitentiary, on 1,000 acres surrounded by the Crab Orchard National 
Wildlife Refuge in southern Illinois, looks like a modern factory except for 
the spools of glistening razor wire that surround it.. 
</P>
<P>
Marion has had publicity -- mostly bad. Nine inmates and two guards were killed 
there between February, 1980, and October, 1983. Five inmates have been killed 
since then. One inmate filed a class-action lawsuit alleging that Marion 
amounted to "cruel and unusual punishment," a violation of the Eighth 
Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Clark grew up in Jackson, Mich., home to the State Prison of Southern Michigan, 
a 5,000-inmate facility that claims to be the largest walled prison in the 
world. Clark said he does not want Marion to hide behind walls. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't hide behind the walls of the prisons and run our prisons in a 
vacuum," Clark said. "We are a public agency with an important social mission. 
We need to be out there helping people understand." 
</P>
<P>
"It (public relations) is being given a tremendous emphasis now" in the federal 
prison system, Clark said "I feel comfortable with that. . . . I think (the 
priesthood) was good preparation. A priest is not just dealing with individual 
communicants, he deals with the public arena all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Clark scoffed at the warden stereotype that is portrayed in movies such as 
"Cool Hand Luke" and "Escape from Alcatraz." 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people I know who are good correctional administrators got into 
the work to help people. They may not have come out of the clergy, but they are 
human-oriented individuals," Clark said. "Those who come in with a hard-line, 
militaristic type of approach are not successful and do not become wardens."

ARCTIC FISHERMEN FIGHT CHILL IN ECONOMY;

NORWAY: AS JOBS DISAPPEAR, MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING FORCED TO LEAVE THEIR HARSH 
BUT BELOVED HOMELAND.

TROMSOE, Norway 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tough Norwegians of the north can ride out the savage storms, the isolation 
and the winter darkness that lasts for two months. It is the region's shattered 
economy that is forcing many to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people very strongly want to stay here. I can't explain it. It's hard to 
make the people of south Norway understand, much less foreigners," said Vigor 
Rossvaer, a University of Tromsoe researcher. 
</P>
<P>
For unemployed fisherman Vidar Esbensen, the answer is simple: "This is home." 
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian Arctic is vast, sparsely populated and beautiful, with snowcapped 
mountains sloping down into the fiords and the northern lights staging nightly 
shows. But gorgeous scenery doesn't pay the mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
Unemployment, alcoholism and the death rate have long been higher than the 
Norwegian average. Then, in January, codfish quotas were slashed to protect 
declining Barents Sea stocks, putting a chokehold on the region's main income. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't live on the quota, and you don't quite die from it either," said 
Esbensen, 35, who was thrown out of work when the cod quota was cut to 130,000 
tons from 350,000. 
</P>
<P>
In early February, the government offered a $77-million bailout package -- 
mainly interest relief on state loans -- to tide fishermen over while long-term 
solutions are sought. 
</P>
<P>
Disappointed fishermen called the package "a Band-Aid on a bullet wound" and 
threatened strikes. 
</P>
<P>
In the northernmost province of Finnmark, unemployment is 7.7%,compared to 3.9% 
in Oslo, Norway's capital. The county population has been falling for 40 years, 
and it dropped by 6.8% in the last decade to 75,000. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of those who left indicated that 51.6% sought better jobs or schools, 
while 22.7% said they were driven off by bad weather and the depressing 24-hour 
winter nights. 
</P>
<P>
Rossvaer said the north is a victim of ecology, economy and even world 
politics. International pressure forced an end to whale hunting, an important 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Improving relations with the Soviet Union is both menacing and encouraging, 
especially in Finnmark, which curls eastward, as if on a map maker's whim, over 
northern Sweden and Finland to butt against the Soviet Union along a 122-mile 
border. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents fear a scaling back of the permanent military presence and 
periodic North Atlantic Treaty Organization maneuvers, which brought airports, 
bus services, roads and employment to the north. On the other hand, an open 
Soviet border could mean income from trade and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
Business analyst Sven Oppegaard predicts a reconstruction of the region's 
economic and social base. Scattered hamlets, where residents catch and process 
their own fish, will give way to larger, more efficient centers, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Some fishing stations already are abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't have a tiny village with a church, school and fish factory on every 
little point of land," said Oppegaard, of the Norwegian Confederation of 
Business and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
The military disagrees. Residents in villages dotting the long, jagged coast 
report on Soviet naval activity, said Gunnar Angeltveit of the Defense 
Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
Modern pressures are building up in this once-isolated, tightly knit coastal 
society, which may account for the 73% increase in suicides from 1975 to 1985 
and rising alcohol abuse, said Rossvaer. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a conflict of two cultures. One is modern Norway, with its 
attractions, and the other is the traditional coastal culture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Northerners are friendly, open, imaginative -- and sometimes wishful. Most 
villages, even those seldom visited, have a local polar museum, adorned with 
relics of seal and whale hunts. 
</P>
<P>
Locals scratching for opportunities see tourism as a way to help preserve 
fading ways of life: whale hunting with cameras, reindeer rides and dog-sled 
treks. One suggested selling tourists neckties made from salmon skins. 
</P>
<P>
"We will do whatever we can to hang on," said Esbensen. "It's hard in the 
Barents, especially in storms, but there is a freedom out there. I've tried 
working on land. I couldn't take it." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone can stick it out. Two years after its fish-processing plant 
closed, the village of Bugoeynes won national attention with an advertisement 
seeking a new home in the south -- anywhere with jobs and room for all 300 
villagers. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't really want to leave. This is a cry for help," one villager admitted. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a symbol of a people trying to keep their society intact, even if it 
means moving south together," Rossvaer said.

NUMBERS OF MIGRATORY BIRDS IN SHARP DECLINE; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: SUBURBAN TERRITORIES ARE ENCROACHING ON FEEDING GROUNDS. 
SHOREBIRDS AND SONGBIRDS HAVE BEEN HIT PARTICULARLY HARD.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shorebirds that migrate 7,000 miles between their winter homes in Argentina and 
their Arctic nesting grounds make a pit stop every spring on New Jersey beaches 
to feast on horseshoe crab eggs. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey also provides "safe houses" between wintering and nesting grounds 
for many other types of migrating birds, including hawks that follow the 
coastline, the Delaware River and Appalachian ridges and tiny warblers looking 
for food in woodlands and coastal thickets. 
</P>
<P>
Naturalists have noticed alarming declines in the feathered wayfarers. The 
number of sanderling, a species of migrating shorebird, has dropped 50% in a 
decade. Sharpshin hawk populations have fallen dramatically since the New 
Jersey Audubon Society started counting in 1976, and songbirds are 
disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey, the most densely populated state, is crossed by several major bird 
routes, and birds are colliding with a human exodus to rural and shore areas. 
Experts say the disappearing migrants are not only a loss for the Garden State, 
but should serve as an early warning for the entire nation. 
</P>
<P>
Audubon ornithologists blame the drop on increased development of rural and 
coastal areas, which often eliminates bird habitat and erects such hazards as 
airports, highways and plate-glass windows (which birds often fly into). 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that humanity really has to do is ask itself a question: Are birds 
important enough to want to protect?" said Pete Dunne, a veteran birdwatcher. 
"If the answer is yes, then we'd better get with it, because it's going to be a 
long road back." 
</P>
<P>
Migrants are hard to protect because they are vulnerable at so many points. 
Such shorebirds as the red knot and the sanderling could be wiped out by damage 
to their nesting sites high above the Arctic Circle or to their wintering 
range. 
</P>
<P>
But they are at special risk during their long journey, when they cluster at 
refuges like the Delaware Bay, where 80% of North America's sanderling and 40% 
of the red knot gather in mid-May. The birds could not survive the grueling 
flight without a chance to rest. 
</P>
<P>
"Each link in the migratory path offers them something," said Kathleen Clark, a 
zoologist with New Jersey's Division of Endangered and Non-Game Species. 
"Delaware Bay is critical because the food supply is there in such abundance." 
</P>
<P>
At Cape May, an average of 36,000 sharpshin hawks have been counted each year 
since 1976, said Paul Kerlinger, director of the Audubon Society's Cape May 
observatory. But the 1988 count was 19,000 and last year's was just above 
10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Kerlinger said the number of sharpshins counted at some inland observation 
points has also gone down. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows why sharpshin hawks are disappearing or even if the decline is 
permanent or temporary. One hypothesis is that the songbirds they depend on for 
food are dying off, Kerlinger said. Another factor could be plate-glass 
windows, which appear to be a hawk-killer second only to hunting. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney Gauthreaux, a Clemson University zoologist, uses old National Weather 
Service radar records to track songbird migrations across the Gulf of Mexico 
from Central America to Louisiana. He estimates that the number of birds making 
the trip has declined 50% in the last 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
Songbirds, which live mostly in deep woods, have been hit by deforestation in 
the tropics and in the United States. On the U.S. Gulf Coast, strips of 
woodland along beach areas provide resting places for migrants before and after 
the flight to Central America, Gauthreaux said, but those "little refuges" are 
now being cut. 
</P>
<P>
Increasing suburbanization of New Jersey's rural areas, with office parks and 
landscaped housing developments replacing forests, provides ideal habitat for 
some wild species. Deer, raccoons, Canada geese and cow birds have become 
pests. Both raccoons, which eat eggs, and cow birds, which use other species' 
nests for their own eggs, play a part in killing off songbirds. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler Robbins, a wildlife biologist at the Patuxent National Wildlife Refuge 
in Maryland, observed that many species are doing just fine, spreading into new 
territories. Cardinals have begun nesting in Massachusetts, while a new species 
of cow bird is penetrating Southern states after moving from South America to 
Puerto Rico, where it is crowding out native species. 
</P>
<P>
But thrushes, vireos and many types of warblers are down. 
</P>
<P>
To protect migrants, the Audubon Society suggests: 
</P>
<P>
* Leave rural and shore property as natural as possible, protecting native 
plants that provide food for birds. 
</P>
<P>
* Limit or ban spraying for gypsy moths and mosquitoes. In addition to killing 
pests, insecticides wipe out bugs that some birds eat. 
</P>
<P>
* Cluster housing to preserve woodlands and limit development near the shore. 
</P>
<P>
* Keep cats, which can be efficient bird killers, indoors. Prevent dogs from 
running free. 
</P>
<P>
* Design man-made hazards to accommodate birds. Plate-glass windows can be 
angled downwards so that they do not reflect trees and sky. Red warning lights 
on broadcast towers and skyscrapers attract birds and might be replaced with 
white strobe lights, although that may aggravate humans.

ARAB ARTISANS CREATE DAZZLING MOSAICS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Essa Bitar deftly shuffled a bundle of multicolored slivers of wood in his 
fingers and displayed a star-shaped design at its tip, a building block for a 
modern craft rooted in centuries of Arabic tradition. 
</P>
<P>
The intricate mosaic veneers made by artists such as Bitar for the past century 
have become some of the most famed handicrafts in this ancient city that is 
celebrated for its many arts. 
</P>
<P>
Tiny bits of wood and plastic or bone form swirls and stars that dance in 
arabesques with tiny checkerboards, crosses and triangles atop tables and 
chairs, on jewel boxes, picture frames, clocks and game boards. 
</P>
<P>
In the stalls that overspill into the twisting alleys of Damascus' medieval 
marketplace, a few dollars will buy a flashy gift box adorned with little star 
patterns, intricate but easily made and with as much plastic as wood. 
</P>
<P>
Well over $1,000 might be asked for an antique chair rich in delicate, 
interwoven lines of bone and rare woods, and spangled with mother-of-pearl 
inlay. 
</P>
<P>
Bitar and others say the craft originated about 1890 when a carpenter named 
George Bitar was pondering the ornamental inlaid stonework that has been a 
feature of Islamic and Arabic architecture for more than 1,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
"He thought why didn't he try it on wood?" said Bitar, who is only distantly 
related to the craft's founder. 
</P>
<P>
Today, several thousand craftsmen turn out the mosaics, which seem ubiquitous 
in the Syrian capital, often in offices and homes as well as in tourist shops. 
</P>
<P>
The craftsmen use woods of different colors to form their designs: yellow lemon 
wood, green from the pistachio tree, red from rosewood, browns from apricot and 
walnut. White, which once came from cow and camel bones, is now more often 
plastic. 
</P>
<P>
The woods are cut into long, angular pieces sometimes thinner than a match 
stick, then glued together in bundles or blocks to form designs. 
</P>
<P>
When a block has dried and hardened, it may be glued to others to form a larger 
pattern. Thin pieces are shaved off this mother chunk and inlaid alongside 
others on the furniture or box, with some pieces applied individually. 
</P>
<P>
Cheaper pieces today are almost mass-produced, with entire surfaces covered 
with slices from one or two mother blocks. Finer work tends to have less 
plastic, more intricate patterns and greater hand inlay. 
</P>
<P>
Multiple strips of wood may line the mosaics and twist off into arabesques of 
their own, often complemented by individually set pieces of mother-of-pearl. 
</P>
<P>
Many Damascus artisans also practice the older craft of inlaying 
mother-of-pearl and ivory, products which are often more costly than mosaic 
work because of their ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at these lines," said Bishara Awad, pointing to the entwined bands of 
mosaic inlay dotted with mother-of-pearl decorating an antique picture frame on 
the wall of the 124-year-old S. G. Nassan handicrafts factory. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't more than three or four people now who are making these designs." 
Awad has worked at Nassan's for 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
The very term arabesque (a decorative design scheme) for entwined floral or 
geometrical designs shows how closely that style has been identified with the 
Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
Mosaic and inlay are also rooted in the centuries. The 200-year-old Azem Palace 
in Damascus' old city displays stonework patterns on fountains and walls that 
are echoed in the designs on wooden boxes in tourist shops nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The Christian Byzantine Empire that ruled the region before Islam's conquest in 
the 7th Century left a legacy of intricate stone mosaics, often illustrating 
Bible stories, on floors throughout the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
And the National Museum holds an inlaid ivory panel carved some 4,000 years ago 
by a craftsman in Mari, in present-day Syria 260 miles east of Damascus.

<P>
Many Americans have watched the flowering of democracy in Eastern Europe with a 
sense of pride. Nancy Ross looks on in frustration and envy. 
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of free elections in Eastern Europe and the multitude of political 
parties competing for support have only heightened Ross' conviction that 
something is wrong in this country. She argues that the antidote to low voter 
turnout, public disgust at negative campaigns and the absence of substantive 
debate in campaigns is a little Eastern European-style politics. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, the executive director of the Rainbow Lobby, a small, left-liberal, 
grass-roots organization, believes that the two major political parties in this 
country have a stranglehold on the process and that their collusion protects 
incumbents and freezes candidates with radical or innovative ideas out of the 
political dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
Her group is trying to attract attention to a package of proposals that Ross 
believes will stimulate interest in the political process. "Our main concern is 
the erosion of democracy in this country," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rainbow Lobby was organized in 1985 by a number of people who had worked 
the year before on Jesse Jackson's presidential campaign (hence the similarity 
of the name to the Rainbow Coalition, even though there is no connection). 
</P>
<P>
So far, it has made little dent on the political process and is lightly 
regarded on Capitol Hill. And there is nothing to suggest that the current 
quest is anything other than quixotic. But for activists like Ross, a former 
school board member in New York City and a founder of the New Alliance Party, 
hope springs eternal. 
</P>
<P>
Ross argues that the two political parties have "set up the rules to lock 
third-party candidates out." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, for example, a third-party candidate for President had to obtain 
674,495 valid petition signatures to be listed on the ballots in all 50 states 
and the District of Columbia. Realistically, candidates need to collect twice 
that number, because many signatures are ruled invalid. That is 26.5 times the 
number needed by a Democratic candidate and 11 times the number needed by a 
Republican candidate. 
</P>
<P>
In Florida, third-party candidates not only need 56,000 valid signatures -- 
each on a separate postcard -- but also must pay 10 cents for each signature 
they submit. 
</P>
<P>
The solution, says Ross, is a bill sponsored by Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) 
that is designed to make it easier for independent candidates or third parties 
to gain access to the ballot throughout the country by sharply reducing the 
number of signatures needed to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Conyers got interested in the idea from his work on voter registration. He 
introduced the bill in the last session of Congress but it got no hearings. The 
same fate appears to await the bill this year. 
</P>
<P>
But Julien Epstein, a Conyers aide who is staff director of the House 
Government Operations Committee, said recent events in Eastern Europe put the 
U.S. system in a new light. "There is a growing sense here that it is time for 
imaginative forms of changes and opportunities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Conyers' bill has been referred to the House Administration Committee, but an 
aide to Rep. Al Swift (D-Wash.), chairman of the elections subcommittee, said 
no hearings are planned, in part because Swift is "hesitant" to mandate federal 
election standards for the states. 
</P>
<P>
Swift also comes from a state with relatively easy ballot access, and the aide 
said that he believes the proliferation of candidates on the ballot in the race 
to fill the Senate vacancy created by the death of Democrat Henry M. Jackson 
led to considerable confusion among voters. 
</P>
<P>
Many political analysts argue that the two-party system in America helps 
provide stability to the electoral and governing process. Party primaries help 
to filter out unacceptable candidates, and the parties provide checks against 
one another's power without bringing about the kind of governmental paralysis 
often seen in multiparty systems. 
</P>
<P>
But with the decline of allegiance to the parties by voters and the increased 
tendency of candidates to run on their own merits rather than their party's, 
outsiders such as Ross see the two parties joining to defend a decaying system. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage a livelier political dialogue, the group wants legislation that 
would guarantee a spot in future presidential debates to legitimate independent 
or third-party candidates who have qualified for the ballot in at least 40 
states and raised at least $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the debates were organized by a commission controlled by the two major 
parties. Under the Rainbow Lobby's proposal, the debates would have included 
Libertarian Party candidate Ron Paul and New Alliance Party candidate Lenora 
Fulani. 
</P>
<P>
Ross has heard many of the arguments against the proliferation of parties and 
candidates, but she believes public apathy represents a rejection of the 
system, a reality that politicians can no longer ignore. 
</P>
<P>
What would these proposals produce? "You might see something like Eastern 
Europe," Ross said. "You might see increased . . . participation. You might see 
a greater discussion of issues. It's a scandal that so few people vote."

<P>
Adam Gotner, badly wounded, survived that bloody day when police opened fire on 
people in the street. Twenty years later, Solidarity runs the government and he 
leads a search for secretly buried bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 17, 1970, is etched in Polish memory as a day of slaughter. At 6 a.m., 
Gotner and many others were walking to their jobs at the Paris Commune 
shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
Tanks and police were posted at the shipyard gates. Suddenly, the police began 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Gotner, then 25, felt something hit his shoulder and saw his jacket turning 
red. He thought of running at the tanks, "but I realized it would be instant 
suicide," and retreated. 
</P>
<P>
"All this time, for several minutes, I could hear the shooting continuing, and 
then it seemed I was stepping on people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the impression I was stepping on bodies. The whole street had been 
covered with people going to work. In my mind, there were at least 500 dead." 
</P>
<P>
Long afterward, Gotner realized that most were not dead, but either wounded or 
sprawling for cover. 
</P>
<P>
The communist authorities had declared the port and shipyard closed because of 
unrest over government-imposed increases in food prices, but had not told the 
workers. Police may have thought the men intended to occupy the shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
Official accounts said 45 Baltic port and shipyard workers were killed that 
day, 28 of them in Gdynia and Gdansk. Many Poles believe the number was much 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
A committee led by Gotner is trying to determine how many died in Gdynia, which 
means digging for bodies. Two excavations have yielded no conclusive results. 
</P>
<P>
A macabre legend grew around the "December events" and the authorities 
contributed to it by collecting bodies and burying them hastily at night, often 
with no relatives present. 
</P>
<P>
Tombstones erected later were allowed to say only that the person honored had 
died a "tragic death." No mention of the Gdynia killings was permitted in the 
state-controlled press. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to investigate were blocked even in 1980-81, Solidarity's first brief 
experience of legal existence. 
</P>
<P>
Censorship was eased enough to allow Andrzej Wajda to make the acclaimed movie 
"Man of Iron," in which the 1970 Gdynia killings are portrayed as central to 
the rise of Solidarity a decade later. 
</P>
<P>
Gotner survived five bullet wounds in the chest, eventually became a Solidarity 
activist in Gdynia and organized a civic committee this year to build a new 
monument to the victims in front of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after it was formed, his committee came under public pressure to 
investigate the killings. With the Communist Party out of power, city officials 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
On a sunny April day at the Witominski Cemetery, gravediggers lifted the coffin 
of Jadwiga Sikorska from a sandy hillside and probed a little deeper. 
</P>
<P>
They found two sets of bones wrapped in cloth. One was too old to be from 1970; 
the other did not appear old enough. 
</P>
<P>
A representative of the prosecutor's office was present and the remains were 
taken to a forensic laboratory for analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Sikorska's son, Jerzy, had noticed bones in the earth when he buried his mother 
in March and told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, 70 volunteers dug up a 60-foot stretch of path in another part of the 
cemetery where witnesses had reported signs of newly dug graves immediately 
after the 1970 shootings. No bodies were found. 
</P>
<P>
Experts confirmed that part of the path had been dug up about 20 years ago, but 
only to a depth of about four feet. They said there was no evidence the soil 
had been disturbed below that depth for hundreds of years. 
</P>
<P>
"There were several hypotheses, and mine is that they were preparing to bury 
bodies there and then decided not to because of personnel changes in the 
government," Gotner said in an interview at his modest apartment overlooking 
the shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
He is a slender, articulate man with dark, curly hair salted with gray, and is 
cautious in expressing opinions about the outcome of his search. When pressed, 
Gotner said: "I think it may turn out to be true that five or 10 more people 
were killed than has been reported." 
</P>
<P>
That conclusion would not be popular. "Already, I have heard gossip that the 
fact that we have not found anything proves we are on the side of the 
authorities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several people claimed to have seen secret burials. Three witnesses who 
appeared reliable, including a militiaman, claim to have seen about 200 bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Gortner noted, however, that "no one is coming to us and asking us to find 
somebody," despite public appeals for information. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the victims were more or fewer, Gotner said, "we want to find the 
truth. We cannot let half-truths continue to exist if we want to build the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
He removed his shirt, revealing scars on the upper chest and a very deep exit 
wound in his back. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had known I had five bullets in me, I would have died of fright," he 
said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
But his laughter faded. "Doing this is my responsibility to those who died at 
that time," Gotner said. "I remember when I was walking and I saw someone 
falling down. I wanted to help him then, but I could not."

JAPAN'S CONSUMER WARRIORS FIGHT COMPLACENCY

<P>
They are warriors in a country with more compliant consumers than consumer 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Fumio Matsuda, a former auto engineer, is a stinging critic of the Japanese 
auto industry's safety performance. 
</P>
<P>
Katsuko Nomura, a 79-year-old grandmother, single-handedly introduced a 
U.S.-style consumer movement to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
They are anomalies here, where social harmony is revered and consumers' 
interests have been subordinated to the welfare of Japanese corporations. 
</P>
<P>
But both have made their mark. 
</P>
<P>
Nomura lobbied for local freedom of information laws, now enacted in 32 of 
Japan's 47 prefectures (state) and about 130 cities and towns, and is working 
to get a national law on the books. She believes access to information about 
such things as chemicals in food will galvanize interest in consumers' rights. 
</P>
<P>
Matsuda operates a volunteer network of scientists and moles at Japan's largest 
auto companies. His 20-year-old Japan Automobile Consumers Union has uncovered 
defects in cars and shifted the spotlight of responsibility onto car makers, 
contributing to a recent unprecedented number of recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Matsuda, 63, charges that Japanese auto makers have been feeding their export 
success by skimping on safety in domestic models while the government sets 
safety standards that are often too low and fails to enforce others. 
</P>
<P>
He claims that several car makers have substituted specially-built cars in 
crash tests of new models for the U.S. and Japanese markets. But, he adds, the 
models later sold to consumers probably would have failed the tests. 
</P>
<P>
Matsuda uses the information he gets from scientists conducting chemical 
analyses of engine parts and employees at auto companies to help consumers 
claim damages from allegedly defective cars. 
</P>
<P>
Japan has no product liability laws, and the lack of legal precedent increases 
the burden on consumers to prove fault by auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
"I never get discouraged because I know we're right and that our information is 
correct," said Matsuda, a former engineer at the Nissan Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
He keeps secret the identities of the 25 members of what he calls his "brain" 
to protect their jobs and his group's information-gathering ability. They never 
go to his office, and rarely call. Sometimes their wives meet to pass 
information. 
</P>
<P>
He bristles at the suggestion that his network is spying. 
</P>
<P>
"They are acting according to their consciences, and everybody is very proud of 
what we do." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for Japan's major auto makers deny Matsuda's charges and say they do 
not think their recall records are a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Bret Anderson, a Honda spokesman, said the company "deals within the industry's 
regulations and standards, or tries to improve on them." 
</P>
<P>
A statement by Toyota Motor Corp. said, "Mr. Matsuda, like any other so-called 
advocate, owes it to the consumers he supposedly represents to be responsible. 
Unfortunately, his track record to date does not say much for the sincerity of 
his implied intentions." 
</P>
<P>
That track record includes a conviction for blackmail stemming from charges 
brought by a group of Japan's largest auto makers in 1971. They accused Matsuda 
of threatening to publicize information about defects in their cars unless they 
paid him. He was sentenced to four years of probation. 
</P>
<P>
Matsuda maintains he was negotiating for a group of car owners who suffered 
damages from defects and said he is appealing the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Although some of Japan's major media regard Matsuda as an agitator, the 
national daily Asahi Shimbun has used his research as the basis for many 
newspaper stories, including an award-winning 1987 series on sudden 
acceleration in Audi imports. The Audis were recalled later in Japan and in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Matsuda lives an austere life. On week nights, he sleeps on a cot in his Tokyo 
office, bulging with files and littered with greasy auto parts. He sees his 
wife and two daughters at the family's seaside home south of Tokyo on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife came from affluent families in which charity and compassion 
were taught at an early age. 
</P>
<P>
Nomura recalled that when she was studying at Kyoto's prestigious Doshisha 
University in 1931, "agricultural families were so poor they were selling their 
daughters while I was being taught how to say, 'So nice to meet you,' in 
English class." 
</P>
<P>
Sensitive to the gap between the real world and the privileged one of her 
birth, she ignored English, read books on Marxism and social injustice, and 
married a like-minded classmate. 
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward she launched a 59-year career of consumer advocacy that has 
included organizing labor unions and bringing news of consumer movements to 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese people just don't get mad at manufacturers," she said. "They're 
not concerned with their rights. So I get angry for them."

TAMPER-PROOF SOCIAL SECURITY CARD URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Daniel Patrick Moynihan was 15 when he got his Social Security card in 1943. He 
promptly lost it. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't look like anything worth keeping," the New York senator recalled. 
"It did not suggest its importance." 
</P>
<P>
Moynihan, who chairs the Senate subcommittee on Social Security, for more than 
a decade has been crusading to replace the paper card with something more 
impressive and tamper-resistant. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it a rather simple proposition that a plastic, counterfeit-proof 
Social Security card would reduce fraud and enhance public confidence in our 
Social Security system," he said at a recent subcommittee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have a durable, plastic card that people can carry around in their 
wallets and feel that they have something, a card that gives them a sense of 
membership in the Social Security system." 
</P>
<P>
That "simple proposition," however, keeps bumping up against longstanding fears 
that the Social Security card would become a national ID card the government 
could use to keep track of people. 
</P>
<P>
Those concerns were born with the Social Security system itself in the 1930s, 
when there were worries that the giant retirement system would become a 
bureaucracy that had everyone's number and knew all about them. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the government designed Social Security cards "to be pulpy and 
wear out in six weeks or whatever and not give any sense that the Third Reich 
was appearing in the United States," Moynihan said. 
</P>
<P>
A more enduring card would help instill confidence in Social Security and 
reduce crimes based on false identities perpetuated with counterfeit cards, 
according to Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
But even now, when the use of Social Security numbers is widely accepted for a 
variety of purposes, the government is wary of making any changes that would 
suggest a national identification system. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Social Security) administration has always had fundamental concerns about 
the possibility of the Social Security card and number becoming a universal 
identifier in this country," Louis D. Enoff, the agency's deputy commissioner 
of programs, said at a recent hearing of Moynihan's subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
The General Accounting Office, in a March report to Congress, suggested that 
debate already may be largely moot. 
</P>
<P>
"Many would argue that we already have an almost universal identifier in the 
country -- the Social Security number," the GAO said. It noted that a Social 
Security number is needed to report income earned from work, to claim children 
age 2 and older as dependents for tax purposes and to obtain driver's licenses 
in many states. 
</P>
<P>
Moynihan thought he had succeeded in improving Social Security cards in 1983, 
when Congress enacted legislation requiring the government to come up with a 
new counterfeit-resistant card. But the new cards, although more difficult to 
alter, look much like the old ones and still are made of paper. 
</P>
<P>
His crusade is receiving renewed attention this year because it has been linked 
with the issue of employment discrimination by employers afraid of being 
punished for hiring illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
Under the nation's 4-year-old immigration law, workers can establish their 
legal eligibility to work by presenting any one of 17 documents, including 
Social Security cards. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO's report said discrimination might be reduced by simplifying the 
process for checking work eligibility, perhaps by relying on a revised Social 
Security card or a driver's license with a verified Social Security number. 
</P>
<P>
But Enoff told the subcommittee that Social Security does not need a better 
card and that there are less expensive ways to address employment 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Gene McNary, commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said 
immigration law prohibits the establishment of a national identity card, but 
does allow the creation of an "employment-authorization document." 
</P>
<P>
"We have to work to find a way to produce the latter without violating the 
restriction of the former," he said.

SOLUTIONS LACKING AS HEALTH COSTS CLIMB

Problems plaguing the nation's health care system are bringing Democrats and 
Republicans, physicians and consumer advocates together on at least one point: 
Change is needed. 
</P>
<P>
But what those changes should be could keep them arguing for a long time to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, America's health care bill keeps mounting. This year, medical 
expenditures are expected to exceed $600 billion -- nearly 12% of the nation's 
gross national product -- while as many as 37 million people go without any 
sort of medical insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"We're on an unsustainable path," said Jack Meyer, a Washington health policy 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
But he and other analysts say that with many in Congress averse to new spending 
and lawmakers still stinging from last year's repeal of the Medicare insurance 
program for catastrophic illness, major changes in the health system are not 
imminent. 
</P>
<P>
"The voting public is not yet exercised about this for it to be a major 
political issue, but that's changing," said Lynn Etheredge, a health policy 
consultant based in Chevy Chase, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses, hit by rising health-care premiums, are passing along more of the 
costs to their workers and pulling back some of the benefits. Health care 
benefits have been the central issue in a growing number of labor strikes. 
</P>
<P>
"The average American worker . . . is unaware of the magnitude of the cost" of 
health-care benefits, said William Ferguson, chairman of the board of Nynex 
Corp., where workers last year staged a four-month strike in which health 
coverage was a main issue. 
</P>
<P>
"But they are starting to wake up. Workers are beginning to understand that 
rising health costs are putting a dent in their pay raises," he said at a 
recent gathering of health care providers. 
</P>
<P>
In early March, the bipartisan Pepper Commission, which included leaders of tax 
and health-care committees in Congress, completed a yearlong study with a 
proposal to provide health-care coverage and long-term care for all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
However, the heath-care part of the plan was approved by only a one-vote margin 
and the package was immediately criticized because it did not recommend a way 
to pay the estimated $66-billion federal price tag. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the various players in the existing health care system -- including 
insurance companies, physicians, unions and corporations -- have come up with 
their own proposals. 
</P>
<P>
And new groups and coalitions are still forming around the issue. In March, 35 
major corporations, unions, consumer groups and other private organizations 
formed the National Leadership Coalition for Health Care Reform. It's the first 
attempt by big business and labor to join in drafting a plan. 
</P>
<P>
Of the proposals that have been put forth so far, only a few advocate a 
government-run health system or go to the other extreme with a purely private 
approach. Most fall into a middle ground that, like the Pepper Commission, 
calls for a public-private sharing of the burden. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the plans would build on the existing system of employer-provided 
health insurance -- 85% of Americans are covered in this way now -- with 
various incentives or mandates for business to include more workers in these 
programs. Some would create risk pools to make affordable policies available to 
those who because of chronic disease couldn't otherwise afford insurance. And 
the government would have responsibility for taking care of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Most policy analysts and health-care consultants say this middle-ground 
approach is the only one that is politically possible, but even then it's not a 
sure bet. 
</P>
<P>
"We will address a national health plan when the President makes it an issue 
for his Administration," said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings 
Institution, a liberal think tank in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"The Administration will move when it feels there's a good political 
opportunity," he said. "And the key for any Administration will be further 
crumbling of business opposition to government involvement." 
</P>
<P>
He doubts that the public will rise up in protest and demand solutions to the 
deficiencies in the current system. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time 85% of the population is insured and receives the best medical care 
in the world -- it may be a little too expensive but so are automobiles, and 
people will grouse about that -- they're not going to grouse enough to make it 
a salient political issue," he said.

Two U.S. soldiers who took part in last year's invasion of Panama will be tried 
on murder charges here later this month in connection with the shooting of a 
Panamanian woman. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting took place Jan. 25, more than a month after the invasion, while 
the soldiers were still in the country as part of a cleanup operation, military 
officials said. The soldiers, who are from the 7th Infantry Division at Ft. 
Ord, also are accused of mishandling their weapons, leaving their base without 
authorization and disobeying orders not to use alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Paul Finsel Jr., 25, of Arkoma, Okla., and Pfc. Mark McMonagle, 20, of 
Philadelphia, face sentences of up to life imprisonment. McMonagle's trial 
begins June 18, and Finsel's trial begins June 25. 
</P>
<P>
A third soldier, Pfc. Marc Gussen, 19, of Teaneck, N.J., pleaded guilty to 
firearms, alcohol and obstruction of justice charges at an April hearing at Ft. 
Ord. He was sentenced to two years in prison and a dishonorable discharge. 
</P>
<P>
The case, the second prosecution of U.S. soldiers involved in the Panama 
invasion, has been an embarrassment to the Army, which has contended that the 
invasion was a highly disciplined military operation. Earlier this year, a 
paratrooper based at Ft. Bragg, N.C., was charged with premeditated murder in 
connection with the shooting of a Panamanian man who had surrendered to U.S. 
forces during the December invasion. Army officials are reviewing his case and 
trying to determine whether he should be court-martialed. 
</P>
<P>
The Army has released few details about the shooting of the Panamanian woman, 
and military defense and prosecution attorneys refused to comment. Maj. L. D. 
Walker, a Ft. Ord spokesman, would say only: "The incident is alleged to have 
occurred when the soldiers unlawfully discharged their weapons. Shots fired by 
. . . McMonagle . . . allegedly resulted in the death of Leila Diaz De Panay, 
50." 
</P>
<P>
The incident began, the Army charges, when the three soldiers left their 
barracks, against orders, to visit a bar, which also serves as a brothel. John 
L. Williams, a San Jose criminal attorney hired by McMonagle's family, said 
that Finsel lost his Army-issue 9-millimeter pistol at the bar. When Finsel 
discovered the weapon missing, he became "extremely agitated," Williams said, 
and decided to stage a fake firefight to cover the loss of the pistol. 
</P>
<P>
The Army considers the loss of an assigned weapon "very serious," said an Army 
official who asked not to be identified. "A soldier will go to great lengths to 
ensure that his weapon is accounted for," he said. "And if it's not accounted 
for, he'll go to great lengths to ensure that it's recovered." 
</P>
<P>
The three soldiers began firing their weapons in the street, Williams said, so 
Finsel could claim he lost his weapon during the confusion of the firefight. 
The result, the attorney said, was total chaos. A carload of Panamanians 
responded by strafing the area with automatic weapons, Williams claimed. 
Eventually, U.S. soldiers from the nearby temporary barracks arrived and "began 
sweeping the area" and shooting out street lights as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
As the Americans withdrew, an officer ordered McMonagle and a few other 
soldiers to "cover the rear," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
"Soldiers were firing their M-16s . . . tracer rounds were going off," Williams 
said. "It was noisy, dark and very confusing. At some point McMonagle became 
separated from the group. He saw a shadow and yelled: 'Halt!' The individual 
didn't halt and McMonagle fired." 
</P>
<P>
The woman's body was found near McMonagle but, Williams said, "others were 
shooting at the time and it's not clear McMonagle shot the woman." The Army, 
however, charged both McMonagle and Finsel with murder. 
</P>
<P>
"This may be a lot of things, but it's not a murder case," Williams said. "This 
was clearly an accidental death. . . . It could be manslaughter, assuming the 
Army can prove McMonagle fired the rounds that killed the woman. The facts just 
don't fit a murder charge." 
</P>
<P>
But, according to the Code of Military Justice, the Army can charge a soldier 
with murder even if there is no premeditation, said Walker of Ft. Ord. One of 
the Army's definitions of murder includes participating in an "act inherently 
dangerous to others" that results in a death, he said. Although both soldiers 
are charged with murder, Walker said, "a lesser penalty can be determined by 
the court." 
</P>
<P>
McMonagle faces an additional charge of violating orders not to have "sexual 
contact with Panamanian females," and Finsel faces charges of loss of military 
property for losing the pistol. 
</P>
<P>
McMonagle joined the Army after he graduated from high school in Philadelphia 
so he could eventually pay for college, said his sister, Christine McMonagle. 
He was a high school soccer star and a good student who had "never been in any 
trouble before this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing has been a nightmare for our family," she said. "We asked the 
Army legal people for an investigator to look into some inconsistencies in the 
case and we were turned down. The whole investigation has been very puzzling." 
</P>
<P>
The families of Finsel and Gussen were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Army will pay compensation -- the amount not yet determined -- to family 
members of the Panamanian woman who was killed, an Army spokesman said. But the 
U.S. government is not planning to pay any indemnity for those killed or 
wounded during the invasion. According to unofficial reports, an estimated 300 
Panamanians were killed and another 2,000 wounded -- most of them civilians -- 
during the invasion.

TELEMAP SERVICE TURNS CAR PHONE INTO COMPASS

WALNUT CREEK, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mariners had sextants, early settlers relied on Indian guides, but these days 
Gloria Cohan uses her car telephone for travel directions -- and she gets 
quicker results. 
</P>
<P>
Cohan, 66, got lost in an Oakland neighborhood so tough she didn't dare get out 
of her car, but it was no problem. Telemap, a fledgling Walnut Creek company 
that features computerized street maps and round-the-clock personalized 
"navigators," was just 11 digits away. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a senior running a property management and interior decorating business 
and I'm having a hard time finding things in the past two years," Cohan said. 
"The streets and buildings are always changing." 
</P>
<P>
She became discombobulated while driving 10 miles from the wealthy suburb of 
Lafayette to a shop in the twisted streets of Oakland, where a craftsman 
restores antique radios. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know Oakland too well," she said. "It wasn't an area you wanted to get 
out in. It was rough looking. 
</P>
<P>
"So I sat in my car and used the cellular telephone to get help from Telemap. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me, 'You've gone too far on Adeline Street.' So with them still on 
the phone, I drove back on Adeline Street to San Pablo (Street) and they said, 
'Turn right,' then 'Turn right again.' By then I could see the shop I was 
looking for," Cohan said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're lost, we're the calm in the storm," said Sean Duffy, 32, president 
of Telemap. 
</P>
<P>
The company has about 1,800 active customers throughout the nation for city map 
directions anywhere in the United States and Canada. The fee for individual 
customers is $24 a year. Now, 55% of Telemap's business is with companies and 
corporations, which pay a reduced rate per user. 
</P>
<P>
A staple of the business is planning routes for truck drivers, salesmen and 
limousine services. Customers call on a toll-free number or fax their 
destinations and starting points to Telemap, where a computer plots the 
swiftest, most efficient route. 
</P>
<P>
Printouts of best routes are faxed back to the client in time for departure. 
</P>
<P>
"It works for us," said Steve Testa, traffic manager for President Containers 
Inc. of Moonachie, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we have drivers who don't know where they're going," so President 
Containers, manufacturer of cartons, uses Telemap to help route its 32 trucks, 
Testa said. 
</P>
<P>
Each day, before the trucks start rolling from the plant in New Jersey at 5 
a.m., Testa calls Telemap in California for help in routing them from point to 
point. Deliveries are usually within 100 miles from the plant and Telemap faxes 
back directions that take the drivers from stop to stop. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though its 2 a.m. (PDT) they're cordial and say, 'Call any time, seven 
days a week,' " Testa said. 
</P>
<P>
Telemap was launched in November, 1989, on $85,000 seed money raised by Duffy 
and Dave Licht, 32, chief executive officer. Licht took out a second mortgage 
on his home and Duffy sold a couple of prize antique cars to get money to start 
the business, which features 32 telephone lines, a state-of-the-art computer 
and maps for more than 4,000 population areas. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue projections for the first year of business total $500,000, putting the 
little company "slightly in the black," Licht said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for Telemap came when Duffy himself got lost trying to find the 
address of friends he hoped to surprise by dropping in on them in Plano, Tex., 
a mostly Latino community just outside Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"First I go to a gasoline station, but nobody speaks English," Duffy said. "I 
go to another station that has one of these bullet-proof enclosures and I have 
to shout through the round hole in the glass, 'Do you have a city map?' 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't but they directed me to the police department. It took me another 
10 minutes to find the police station and they helped me, but they also let me 
know they had better things to do." 
</P>
<P>
Why not start a company that you can call for street directions, Duffy 
reasoned. There are organizations offering city-to-city routes, but no one 
actually giving street directions from "your front door to your destination 
door." 
</P>
<P>
It works for Gordon Morris, a salesman for Shasta Insulation Corp. based in 
Chico, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Morris faxes Telemap the addresses of the accounts he plans to visit the next 
day throughout Northern California. The company plots his routes to each stop 
and faxes the information back before the salesman sets out. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest advantage to me," Morris said, is "I no longer have to sit in a 
motel room the night before and try to figure out on a map where I'm going. I 
can actually save time and see more accounts by having my routes all planned 
for me."

FAST ACTION A MUST FOR LOCATING AIRPORT; 
</P>
<P>
SUPERVISORS SHOULD GIVE GEORGE AFB A CLOSE LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For decades, the Orange County Board of Supervisors has been commissioning 
studies and spending scarce taxpayers' funds in a hunt for some place to build 
another commercial jet airport. 
</P>
<P>
For just as many years, knowledgeable observers have been saying quietly that 
no matter how hard the supervisors might look, they wouldn't find another 
airport location in Orange County. As they have correctly surmised, the 
county's growth, size and land-development patterns long ago precluded the 
possibility of finding a suitable site within the county's borders. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the supervisors are scheduled to consider a staff report that 
recommends ruling out once and for all the four sites (two in Orange County, 
one each in San Diego and Riverside counties) that keep cropping up in other 
studies, and to focus attention instead on George Air Force Base in the Mojave 
Desert in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
The four sites, with their built-in environmental and traffic problems, are all 
seriously flawed, as the staff notes. Moreover, the Pentagon is planning to 
close George Air Force Base in 1992. So from Orange County's point of view, it 
makes good sense to at least think about how workable it would be to convert 
the 6,000-acre military airfield to serve the civilian needs of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
To some, singling out a seemingly remote site in the desert about 80 miles 
northeast of the heart of Orange County is an attempt at exporting a problem. 
Skeptics also see it as locating the airport where it would be rarely used, 
simply because it's so far away. 
</P>
<P>
But there are mitigating circumstances that make George Air Force Base at least 
worthy of the consideration that the staff is asking from the board. 
</P>
<P>
Not only can the airfield be converted to civilian use in a relatively short 
period of time, but local residents in Adelanto actually want a new airport 
there and are actively campaigning for it. That eliminates the NIMBY (not in my 
back yard) problem that exists at most every other potential site. 
</P>
<P>
The need for a new airport and more flights is a regional problem that Orange 
County should address with its neighbors in Riverside, San Bernardino and Los 
Angeles counties. Estimates are that by the year 2010, Southern California 
airports will need 25 million more passenger boardings a year than they will be 
able to provide. The bulk of the shortage (15 million) will be in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The remoteness and inconvenience of George Air Force Base for Orange County 
passengers is a big problem. The only way the long trip to the airfield can be 
overcome is if the proposed high-speed rail service between Anaheim and Las 
Vegas becomes a reality. The fact that the train is a private proposal means 
that the public interest would be entirely dependent on decisions made in the 
private sector. The train, if it becomes a reality, could make the airport trip 
feasible and fast. But it remains a question mark. 
</P>
<P>
Still, if Orange County's growing passenger needs are to be met in this 
century, or in the early 2000s, the county board must start making decisions 
and pinning down the potential sites that are economically, environmentally and 
politically the most practical. 
</P>
<P>
The four sites the staff report seeks to eliminate fall short on those factors. 
George Air Force Base may not measure up, either. Whether it does or not should 
be determined posthaste. At this point, any decision that eliminates the usual 
suspects -- tired, unacceptable and unrealistic airport sites -- is progress, 
indeed.

WE'RE ALL THE POORER FOR SOS SHUTDOWN; 
</P>
<P>
THE SOONER EVICTED COSTA MESA CHARITY CAN BE REOPENED, THE BETTER FOR ITS 
CLIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The full impact of Costa Mesa's decision to evict Share Our Selves charity from 
its home in Rea Community Center is starting to be felt. SOS closed its food, 
clothing and financial assistance operations on June 1 after a long battle with 
the city. It will reopen later this summer at its new location in a business 
park on Superior Avenue, a site selected to move the charity away from 
neighborhood protests that led to the eviction. But in the meantime, thousands 
of people who would have turned to SOS will be left in the lurch. 
</P>
<P>
SOS stopped paying its rent in January after it was ordered out. An agreement 
reached with the city forgave that rent, gave SOS until June 1 to close and 
allowed the agency's dental operations to stay at the Rea Center. That might be 
viewed as magnanimous under some circumstances. But it is hard to pass over the 
obvious cruelty of forcing SOS to close down before its new center is ready. 
That leaves the 5,000 clients a month that SOS serves stranded. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, other Orange County social service agencies are facing their own 
financial and other crises, leaving little hope that they can pick up the slack 
until SOS reopens. 
</P>
<P>
There are some things that could be done, however, to help out this summer. For 
one thing, churches and community groups could pitch in with emergency aid and 
volunteers to get food distributed -- the most pressing need. This would take 
an organized effort by agencies that already feel inundated. 
</P>
<P>
But one agency, the Episcopal Service Alliance, says it has the volunteers and 
the space to fill the food gap if it has the money. In the face of its own 
financial problems, ESA is cutting back services by 50% this year. 
</P>
<P>
United Way also plans to bring together agencies and others concerned about SOS 
at a meeting next week. 
</P>
<P>
There also are some things that can be done to speed up renovation of SOS' new 
center. A general contractor, for example, would cost $50,000 to $60,000, but 
could assure SOS of opening sooner. 
</P>
<P>
Also, while there are plenty of "hammer-and-nail" volunteers ready to help, 
skilled tradesmen are desperately needed. 
</P>
<P>
SOS executive director Jean Forbath said volunteers let the phone ring last 
week as the charity packed up its operations at the Rea Center. At the other 
end, they knew, were heartbreaking stories of those who depend on the charity 
to get them through difficult times. It's going to be a long, hard summer for 
thousands.

AIRPORT SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I read Jeffrey Perlman's report "Orange County Is Out as Site for New 
Airport," I was thoroughly disgusted with our politicians who are supposed to 
work for and protect the best interests of the public. Apparently this is not 
true, as they flagrantly make decisions that cost the taxpayers hundreds of 
millions -- making the same mistakes they overlooked at John Wayne Airport, Los 
Angeles International and hundreds of others throughout the United States! 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the Airport Site Coalition was charged with the responsibility 
of selecting a site that was centrally located, had rail and freeway access, no 
noise pollution of residential areas, no obstructions to takeoffs or landings 
and convenient to the counties of Orange, San Diego, Imperial and Riverside! 
</P>
<P>
The beachfront Las Pulgas site at Camp Pendleton has 100% of all these 
requirements and, in addition to being the safest, could be rated as a AAA 
World Class International Airport! 
</P>
<P>
However, the Marine Corps doggedly refuses to give up the small area needed, 
even when they know the site would not be completed and operational until the 
year 2010! 
</P>
<P>
It is the only airport site that could take the overload from John Wayne 
Airport and relieve the residents of Newport Beach from the stress they are now 
suffering. It could also take a sizable portion of the overload from LAX. 
</P>
<P>
Why does the Marine Corps spitefully ignore the chronic needs of 40 million 
airline passengers -- the predicted shortfall by 2010? Camp Pendleton was 
labeled "a wartime need" when it was wrested from the Flood family in 1939. 
Since 1945, a very large part of this acreage is seldom, if ever, used.

TREE CRIMINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Across the country, concerned citizens and civic officials are promoting the 
planting and preservation of trees. Recently, an obscure 44-year-old Huntington 
Beach ordinance -- 9771(b) -- has been brought to light that threatens many of 
the trees in residential neighborhoods throughout our city. 
</P>
<P>
Drive down any street and look at how many trees line our streets and yards. 
Look in your own yard. Many of the trees in Huntington Beach, and very likely 
your back yard, may be illegal according to this law. It states no "hedge" can 
be taller than six feet within five feet of your side yard and within 10 feet 
of your rear property lines. 
</P>
<P>
You may say this does not affect you because "my trees are not a hedge." 
According to Webster you would be right. But a recent amendment to the city's 
ordinances has replaced Webster's definition with Article 9080.65: "Hedge. A 
plant or series of plants, shrubs or other landscape material so arranged as to 
form a physical barrier or enclosure." That's right, as little as a single 
plant can be considered a "hedge" and ordered cut to six feet. 
</P>
<P>
We now have a situation where many residents have a "chain saw" hanging over 
their heads just waiting to be turned loose on their trees and landscaping. 
There are many "concerned citizens" who are ready to use this law to get even, 
in disputes with tree owners. This law and city resources should not be used as 
tools of spite or vengeance.

COUNTY LOSES WHEN MATCHING TRANSIT FUNDS ARE DOLED OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STAN OFTELIE, Stan Oftelie is executive director of the Orange County 
Transportation Commission. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The voice on the telephone line from Sacramento sounded ominous. 
</P>
<P>
"You Orange County guys are dead meat," he said. "Why should we help you if you 
won't help yourself?" 
</P>
<P>
I cranked up the charm. I talked about the great things going on in Orange 
County transportation. Developer fees are building new corridors. Moves toward 
unifying transportation agencies seem to be successful. We're creative. We're 
innovative. At the Orange County Transportation Commission, we are helping the 
state Department of Transportation by using private consultants to design and 
environmentally clear freeway projects. 
</P>
<P>
It sounded great, but it wasn't selling. Charm gets shopworn pretty fast when 
other guys are putting money on the table. 
</P>
<P>
And, in this case, the other guys are putting local transportation dollars on 
the table and turning locally generated funds into transportation partnerships 
with state and federal government. 
</P>
<P>
In California and throughout the United States, the concept of partnerships 
where the federal, state and local governments -- and sometimes the private 
sector -- pool resources to build major infrastructure improvements, is gaining 
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the state government and the federal government require 
dollar-for-dollar "matches," that is, for every local dollar raised, the state 
and federal government will each add a dollar to this special partnership. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner is promoting these partnerships 
in his National Transportation Policy. State propositions 108, 111 and 116, the 
transportation measures approved Tuesday, are built on the concept of the feds, 
the state and local government sharing responsibility to build roads, freeways, 
and rail systems. 
</P>
<P>
It's a concept built on solid logic. It requires government agencies to work 
together harmoniously. It's widely accepted. 
</P>
<P>
It's killing us. 
</P>
<P>
It is killing us because we don't have the resources to pool with other levels 
of government. 
</P>
<P>
In every urban county in California, voters have approved a local option, 
half-cent transportation sales tax. Of the 10 largest counties in California, 
nine have adopted these locally approved sources of local transportation 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The lone holdout is Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Today, we're ringed by counties that have approved these transportation 
measures. And that means we're surrounded by counties that have a competitive 
advantage in the annual hunt for transportation dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County will continue to receive a return on the gas taxes approved on 
Tuesday. We'll see that the state keeps its promises to improve the Santa Ana 
Freeway through Santa Ana and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
But we probably will leave rail money on the table because we won't be able to 
match it. We may lose up to $75 million in the first three years, although 
we'll be trying some fast footwork to try to bring as many of those dollars to 
Orange County as possible. 
</P>
<P>
But the haunting refrain of the voice on the telephone, "Why should we help you 
if you won't help yourself?" will keep us on the edge of gridlock in this 
county in the future. 
</P>
<P>
There may be other ramifications. TRW Real Estate Information Services recently 
reported the first drop in the price of Orange County homes in five years. For 
the first time since 1985, the average home prices haven't been appreciating 
here. 
</P>
<P>
In neighboring counties, TRW tells us, the average cost of homes is increasing: 
The average price is up more than 10% in Riverside, almost 10% in San Diego, 
almost 6% in Los Angeles. Is there a correlation between investment in 
transportation infrastructure and the quality of life? How about transportation 
investment and the value of your home? 
</P>
<P>
Tough questions. 
</P>
<P>
Academic debates on cause and effect can rage for years without resolution. 
Drawing a parallel between what happens with an individual homeowner's 
investment and regional infrastructure is a dangerous comparison for anyone to 
take. 
</P>
<P>
But clearly, in the last year, property values have increased in neighboring 
counties where people have invested in transportation and they've decreased in 
the county where no investment has been made. There may be no connection in 
these fact patterns. Then again, there may be. 
</P>
<P>
The debate on the effect that infrastructure has on our quality of life -- and, 
inevitably, on the investment we have in our homes -- is one which does not 
have an easy answer. 
</P>
<P>
Other issues are much clearer. We're confident that the Measure M package that 
was defeated last November was a strong technical program. It balanced 
freeways, highways, streets, roads and rail transit with a strong 
growth-management program. 
</P>
<P>
It called for safeguards to guarantee that any new transportation revenue goes 
only for transportation purposes. It also included a special Citizens Oversight 
Committee to act as a watchdog over public funds. 
</P>
<P>
The measure was crafted over a two-year period and involved hundreds of people, 
special task forces of city and county officials, an energetic Citizens 
Committee, seven public workshops and countywide public-opinion polling. 
</P>
<P>
The results of the technical work and the public outreach efforts were 
striking: The professional engineers and the citizens of Orange County came up 
with almost identical traffic solutions. They agreed on what should be done and 
how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
OK: If the plan was so good, why did voters reject it by a 53% to 47% margin? 
</P>
<P>
Two reasons: first, low voter turnout. Only about 250,000 voters went to the 
polls in November, 1989. That means 880,000 people who were eligible to vote 
stayed home. According to the political pros, the people who did not turn out 
were the ones who were most likely to agree to a transportation sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
The second reason? No one wants to pay more taxes. Everyone hopes there is 
another solution. They hope the developers will pay. Or the state government. 
Or the federal government. Or someone else. Anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
But the reality is that no one else will bail Orange County out. The other 
counties have stepped up to the plate and agreed to tax themselves. Developer 
fees in Orange County are among the highest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
And when we look to Sacramento or Washington, we're hearing that same old song: 
"Why should we help you if you won't help yourself?"

YOUNG CRUISERS AND BOREDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Curbing Cruisers" (June 3): The article on cruising seemed absurd but 
faintly familiar of my high school days. The article tries to blame the purpose 
of cruising on showing off one's car. 
</P>
<P>
That may be true to a certain extent, but I know the real reason. What are 
teen-agers supposed to do on a weekend night? I can remember sitting at my 
friend's house on a Saturday night all dressed up with no place to go. If you 
are not 21, there is really nowhere to hang out. 
</P>
<P>
Balboa was always our last resort if there was nothing else going on. Movies 
get old, and the Family Fun Center in Fountain Valley is for people 14 years 
old and younger, so what do people expect? 
</P>
<P>
It's funny because those working in the entertainment industry are well over 21 
and have forgotten about the lack of options for teen-agers. They only focus on 
21-and-over clubs, since alcohol brings in money. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, there are 18-and-over clubs in Los Angeles, but if you have a midnight 
curfew, that is out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
I have not forgotten those days, thanks to my 16-year-old sister who complains 
about the same problems. 
</P>
<P>
A solution for bored teen-agers who have nothing better to do than cruise the 
Balboa Peninsula or Lucky Supermarket on a Saturday night is to get a fake ID. 
Better than that, and more in accord with the law, 16-and-over clubs or 
entertainment centers should be started so they have someplace to go and are no 
longer considered troublemakers.

THE GRASS IS GREENER -- AT THE GOLF CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The excellent article by James Gomez (June 4) covering the San Clemente water 
shortage raises again an ogre that many of us have been unable to effectively 
combat. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of San Clemente who don't play golf -- maybe 35,000 of them, or 90% 
of the population -- are probably wondering about the shortage and what role 
they are expected to play to decrease water use in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
And they may notice that some inequities exist in the needs for water in the 
community, such as the 19.5 million gallons a month of pure drinking water 
being used by the new Pacific Golf Club to keep its grass green. 650,000 
gallons a day? And this is only one of three golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
But resident aliens without golf bags have no place to register and their words 
seem to fall on empty ears, since they don't even own a putter. 
</P>
<P>
If, in fact, somewhere between 35 million and 40 million gallons of drinking 
water are being poured onto those three courses each month, all of us must take 
shorter showers, forget about watering the lawn, don't flush the toilet and, at 
the risk of possible arrest, don't ever wash your car. 
</P>
<P>
But, if some of that golf irrigation eventually comes from recycled and 
undrinkable water, it's no problem, unless you wonder where all that money for 
recycling is coming from. 
</P>
<P>
Most local citizens will bend and adjust to the constrictions of the water 
shortage, and their consumption in May had already decreased. Developers are 
anxious, however, to add more trauma to our problems, and they have an enormous 
economic clout with the local government. 
</P>
<P>
The average water users may consume 150 to 400 gallons a day. We can apparently 
all live with this rate of consumption unless, of course, new homes keep 
opening up. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, that one golf course is using as much as 2,166 homes in town (that) 
may consume 300 gallons a day. Why has the city condoned this vestige of 
special interest and placed a sacrosanct immunity around those 5% who wield the 
clubs? Is the revenue to the city all that important? 
</P>
<P>
Those thousands who have sacrificed in the past few months to restrict their 
water consumption should expect some reasonable balance between golf, 
developers and their own needs. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, maybe my unwashed car is really not as important as making the very tough 
4-par on that hole with the fairways of gorgeous green grass. That little 
white-dimpled ball wields a clout much greater than those thousands of 
residents with brown lawns.

OUTTAKES: MORE SHELLSHOCK

<TEXT>
<P>
Raphael, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Leonardo -- a.k.a. the "Teenage Mutant 
Ninja Turtles" -- are back in action. The sequel to New Line Cinema's big hit 
(domestic gross: more than $121 million) is set to go before the cameras in 
October for Golden Harvest. 
</P>
<P>
This time out, the budget's $20 million -- up from the $12 million for "Turtles 
I." 
</P>
<P>
"We want to give the film bigger production values and better sets," says 
producer David Chan. "We want it to be even more entertaining. And we'd like a 
little more time to shoot." (The first film was shot in nine weeks.) 
</P>
<P>
The director is not set, and the turtle players are still being cast. 
</P>
<P>
Todd W. Langen is again scripting. Chan was mum about the storyline, revealing 
only that the character of Splinter, the pizza-loving turtles' mentor-rat, will 
return in a plot involving "the fight against injustice." 
</P>

STAGE WEEK: FOXWORTH SINGS 'NIGHTINGALE'S' PRAISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I'm not sure he has a lot of good things going for him," admitted Robert 
Foxworth of his character in L.A. Theatre Works' production of Timberlake 
Wertenbaker's "The Love of the Nightingale," opening Friday at Santa Monica's 
Edgemar complex. 
</P>
<P>
"Tereus is representative of the tyranny we often allow to take place," the 
actor continued, "whether it be tyranny of silence or silent consent -- how it 
can take place when we're not outraged, when we're not moved to speak up on 
behalf of ourselves and our society. It's the power of the powerful over the 
weak, of government over the governed, father over daughter, men over women." 
</P>
<P>
Wertenbaker, author of "The Grace of Mary Traverse" (1988, at the same site) 
and "Our Country's Good" (1989, Mark Taper Forum) has based her story on a 
Greek myth in which Procne, the eldest daughter of the King of Athens, is given 
in marriage to Tereus, King of Thrace, as a thank-you for helping Athens win a 
war. Tereus, however, only has eyes for Procne's younger sister, Philomele, who 
rebuffs his advances . . . and then things get a little nasty. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the ensuing tragedy, Foxworth refuses to paint his character as 
one-dimensional. "I'm not approaching him like a conniving, evil person," 
emphasized the actor, who played Chase Gioberti on the long-running "Falcon 
Crest." Tereus, he added, "doesn't think he's evil. He's caught in forces 
beyond his control -- love, passion, lust -- and it confuses him. He's used to 
fighting and struggle; these other things are just beyond him." 
</P>
<P>
Presented in period costume and setting but imbued with modern sensibilities, 
the characters are shadowed by a traditional Greek chorus (15 actors play a 
multiplicity of roles), which offers the story up for God's observation. "The 
story takes place in ancient time but uses modern language," Foxworth 
explained. "I play Tereus as a modern man -- fighting with the same passions, 
thoughts and issues that are with us all through time." 
</P>
<P>
THEATER BUZZ: It's June, and marriage is in the air -- especially at "Tony n' 
Tina's Wedding," where the environmental theater piece has provided a backdrop 
for some real-life romances. Newly engaged are Pat Cregan (who plays bridesmaid 
Marina) and actor Paul Navarro, who met two months ago when he attended the 
show as an audience member. Also engaged are Jack Fris (Michael, Tina's ex) and 
Chris Campbell, sister of castmate Mark Campbell (druggie Barry). Eli Ganias 
(Tony's brother John) has just left to marry Jean Synodinos (Sister Albert), 
who's in the show's New York company. 
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSSFIRE: "Millennium Approaches," the first part of Tony Kushner's 
work-in-progress about the AIDS generation, is winding up its run at Taper, 
Too. Oskar Eustis directs. 
</P>
<P>
Said The Times' Sylvie Drake: "It employs comedy, symbolism, hallucination, 
death, condoms and contrapuntal scene-playing. It has politicians, ancestors 
and angels. . . . (It is) at once fascinating, enervating, innovating and in 
severe need of of a ruthless editor." 
</P>
<P>
The Daily News' Daryl H. Miller found it "thought-provoking and entertaining. 
Yet it is also unsatisfying because it rambles through a wide range of issues 
without focusing on any of them or coming to any conclusions. . . . Despite the 
script's meandering, Eustis stages it with a driving energy." 
</P>
<P>
Said the Hollywood Reporter's Jay Reiner: "In a loose, episodic style, (it) 
weaves together three different strands from the past. . . . This is an 
ambitious, freewheeling work, slow to get started, too long, and often lumpy in 
style -- but filled with occasional nuggets of irony and savage humor." 
</P>
<P>
In the L.A. Reader, Alison Sloane praised Eustis' "fluid direction. . . . With 
lyrical dialogue, streamlined structure and surreal sequences, Kushner's script 
is still grounded in visceral reality. It is at once a potent examination of 
society's decaying compassion and an effective call to action."

ON THE RECORD: MEMORIES OF VIOLINIST DAVID OISTRAKH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Oistrakh (1908-1974), the great Soviet violinist of the post-World War II 
era, has been misrepresented even by some of his staunchest admirers as being a 
"sensational" artist: a dramatic powerhouse of the old school, a purveyor of 
throbbing vibrato and the expressive devices of earlier times. 
</P>
<P>
Listening again to some of his Soviet Melodiya recordings, currently available 
here on the French Chant du Monde label -- the "currently" refers to the fact 
that no one is certain who has the marketing rights to Melodiya's catalogue 
outside the Soviet Union -- refutes any notion of Oistrakh the hyper-Romantic. 
</P>
<P>
Just try, and you must, Oistrakh's interpretations of three attractive, 
underrated 20th-Century concertos: the First Concerto of Bartok, Hindemith's 
1939 Concerto, and the First Concerto of Karol Szymanowski (Chant du Monde 278 
941). 
</P>
<P>
The Bartok and Szymanowski are, each in its way, post-Romantic creations that 
invite crooning and swooning, which Oistrakh resists. He presents, rather, a 
quite astonishing range of color and emotion while keeping his tone light and 
clear and maintaining rhythmic momentum in even the slowest and/or most 
convoluted passages. 
</P>
<P>
The Hindemith Concerto may be the most likable creation of the tough-guy 
composer of all that academic music no one really wants to hear, and Oistrakh's 
warm, agile reading exposes Hindemith's suppressed Romanticism without making 
it the point of the work. 
</P>
<P>
The violinist has the benefit of masterful support throughout: from Gennady 
Rozhdestvensky and the USSR Radio Symphony in Bartok and Hindemith, from Kurt 
Sanderling and the Leningrad Symphony in Szymanowski. 
</P>
<P>
Sonically, these circa 1960 Moscow recordings aren't much: strident in the 
upper register of the massed violins and dense in the louder tuttis. But if 
it's Oistrakh you want, this is the real, incomparable thing. 
</P>
<P>
Oistrakh is undermined by pianist Lev Oborin in a 1957 Moscow studio recording 
of the Franck A-major Sonata (Chant du Monde 278 944). Where in a later, live 
edition of the same work (278 885) Oistrakh enjoyed the perfectly attuned 
collaboration of Sviatoslav Richter, Oborin indulges in flights of rhythmic 
fancy that disregard his colleague's -- and Franck's -- needs. 
</P>
<P>
On the same CD, however, Frida Bauer proves the perfect teammate in stylish, 
deeply satisfying accounts of the Ravel and Debussy duo-sonatas. These are the 
same 1964 studio performances available in Philips' Legendary Classics series, 
but without Philips' misguided sonic prettification. 
</P>
<P>
Lydia Mordkovitch studied with Oistrakh at the Moscow Conservatory from 1968 to 
1970, working with him on the two Shostakovich concertos, both dedicated to 
Oistrakh, which she has recorded with conductor Neeme Jarvi and the Scottish 
National Orchestra (Chandos 8820). 
</P>
<P>
Whether she is really as lush-toned a fiddler as this very model of a 
contemporary recording would suggest cannot be determined by one who hasn't 
heard her live. What is clear is that she is an artist of lively dramatic 
instincts and vast technical resources. 
</P>
<P>
Mordkovitch projects the First Concerto, the more interesting of the two, with 
unflagging command of both the brooding tension of its first three movements 
and the fiery energy released in its frisky-devilish finale. 
</P>
<P>
Energy is a quality that also informs the playing of Kyung-Wha Chung, with her 
bright, intense, fast-vibrato tone. For her latest recording she has formed a 
partnership with pianist Krystian Zimerman (Deutsche Grammophon 427 617) and 
the two play the living daylights -- that's intended as praise -- out of the 
young Richard Strauss' gorgeously overheated Sonata in E-flat. 
</P>
<P>
The coupling, Respighi's B-minor Sonata, also aims at the ecstatic but succeeds 
only in frantic groping toward that end, while picking up, without 
assimilating, bits of Brahms and Strauss along its turgid way. Chung's playing 
isn't as clean here as in the Strauss, nor does she make us forget the sheer 
joy of conquering the work's technical hazards that made the old Heifetz 
recording one of those treasurable great performances of rotten music. 
</P>
<P>
The Respighi seems even more expendable in the sober, labored performance by 
violinist Josef Suk and pianist Josef Hala. But the same program (Supraphon 
110710, mid-price) offers an elegant, mobile reading of the Franck A major and 
a dazzling one of the neglected and altogether superb Sonata by Francis 
Poulenc, where Suk's fast, tight vibrato and upper-register brilliance are 
employed to ideal effect. The pianist in both is Jan Panenka, a strong, 
sympathetic partner.

<P>
VERDI: "Attila." Samuel Ramey, Cheryl Studer, Neil Shicoff, Giorgio Zancanaro, 
others; forces of La Scala; Riccardo Muti, conducting; EMI 7 49952 2 (two 
compact discs). 
</P>
<P>
Since his appointment in 1986 as music director, Muti has transformed the Scala 
chorus and orchestra into almost physical extensions of his own superior 
musical personality, which stresses both passion and precision. Based on their 
contributions alone, so readily do they bend to his will that Muti's operatic 
recordings have rare dramatic impact. His sometime odd vocal preferences, 
however, like Toscanini's, can yield uneven results, as these two new releases 
demonstrate. 
</P>
<P>
The "Tell" comes from live performances at Scala in December, 1988. The version 
used is a new edition by M. Elizabeth C. Bartlet of the original French, 
tailored for an Italian adaptation. Inclusion of applause after the big 
numbers, always of the same length and without any notable fervor, is an 
annoyance. At almost four hours long, the opera, Rossini's last, fluctuates 
laboriously between the French and Italian styles, and is heavy going indeed. 
</P>
<P>
The title role calls for a big vocal personality and Zancanaro, despite some 
mellifluous singing, does not dominate as he should. Studer seems uninvolved 
and tired (the Italian enunciation is particularly muddy); her "Selva opaca" is 
bothered by a steady tremolo, but she does manage the rapid scale passages, 
especially the ascending ones, in her Act III aria with brilliance. Merritt is 
certainly fluent enough in the Rossini style and he has the needed C's and 
C-sharps, but the sound remains unattractive and he provides an occasional yelp 
that is almost comical. Roni is an underpowered villain. As in his recent 
"Rigoletto," Muti alone cannot carry the opera. 
</P>
<P>
An altogether different story is Verdi's almost brazenly youthful, vigorous and 
melodic "Attila," a studio recording from last summer. Ramey, in splendid 
voice, is a potent Hun and manages the bravura writing impressively. Studer 
tackles the wide-ranging vocal and dramatic demands for Odabella (a cousin to 
Abigaille of "Nabucco") fearlessly and has that precious quality always looked 
for in a Verdi soprano, the ability to open up on top. In the subtly expressive 
music of Ezio, Zancanaro colors his tones expertly. Shicoff, while not an 
ideally smooth Verdi tenor, sings with fervor. As usual with Muti, all 
unwritten high notes are banished, a small price to pay for one of the best 
early Verdi recordings now in the catalogue.

** 1/2 LITA FORD, "Stiletto," RCA. Albums are rated from one star (poor) to 
five stars (a classic).

<P>
Reunited with Mike Chapman, producer of her last (and first platinum) LP, Ford 
rides her sex-bomb goddess image, serviceable vocals and one o' the lads 
guitarwork hard 'n' heavy for almost one full side of this LP. While "Hungry" 
is pure POP! and "Dedication " is pure raunch, "Lisa" is an honest-to-goodness 
power ballad about her mom (!), and "The Ripper" a showcase for Ford's frenetic 
axe murderings. Unfortunately, Side 2 sports a dumbbell version of Alice 
Cooper's genuinely stoopid "Only Women Bleed" and notta lotta anythang else.

ART WORLD: GEORGE YEPES: HE PAINTS FOR HISTORY -- AND FOR THE MOVIES, TOOFACES 
</P>

<P>
"I refuse to be one of 'the boys,' " said George Yepes, as he lashed out at 
what he called the current trend for curators, dealers and others to group all 
Latino artists together. "I don't want to be grouped with the artists that are 
out right now. These guys today took the guts out of Hispanic art. People like 
Siqueiros, Orozco -- the old Mexican masters -- they are rolling over in their 
graves right now. But they have to pass the baton over to somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Yepes' latest attempts to run with that baton went on view Thursday at Santa 
Monica's B-1 Gallery. The artist's reception for the show, called "Midnight 
Devil Dancing," will be held June 28. 
</P>
<P>
Featured are about 10 paintings, including the 25-foot "Self Portrait 1990: 
Rapture of the Sublime," which depicts Yepes and his ever-present fiance locked 
in a kiss, surrounded by a number of fighters and slain figures representing 
"the casualties of war today." Also included in the autobiographical work is a 
pair of boxers in a ring -- reminiscent of the days when Yepes himself boxed -- 
and a series of green-faced men, which Yepes said represents the attorneys now 
embroiled in his life because of disputes with East Los Streetscapers, a mural 
painting group that Yepes left a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Yepes, 34, who recently completed the "Lady of the East Side" mural at 4th 
Street and the 101 Freeway, has four additional mural projects under 
discussion, as well as two more pending approval of Cultural Affairs grants 
from the city of Los Angeles. But his next project is for a totally different 
medium -- the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
The artist has been commissioned by the producers of "Bewitched Affair" -- 
which stars Mark Hamill and Apollonia and begins filming this week -- to paint 
works for a gallery that will be created as one of the film's key locations. 
</P>
<P>
For the film, which will include "a huge love scene" right under one of his 
works, Yepes plans to paint "kind of epic things" dealing mainly with passion 
and witchcraft. 
</P>
<P>
The short-haired, clean-cut Yepes -- dressed in a white Yves Saint Laurent 
dress shirt and black slacks and shoes -- noted that he doesn't look like a 
typical artist and doesn't fit in with the "misdirected calling that says (to 
be an artist) you've got to have long hair or a beard, live like an artist, and 
have paint on your pants." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he says: "What's important is the art. I'd rather somebody know my 
work than know me. . . . I paint for history -- for what they're going to say 
about the artwork 50 years from now. I want history to look back . . . and say, 
'Wow, this guy could paint.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENTS 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Art Museum will put its $8,500 National Endowment for the Arts grant 
toward the purchase of a set of the 150 prints produced to date by Los Angeles' 
Self-Help Graphics. Included are works by 70 artists such as Diane Gamboa, 
Frank Romero and Gronk. 
</P>
<P>
According to Self-Help Graphics' curator Alex Alferov, the museum's purchase 
will give more importance to the work done by the nonprofit workshop and its 
Hispanic artists. 
</P>
<P>
Self-Help Graphics is excited about the purchase because being in a prestigious 
museum collection validates all the years of work founder and director Sister 
Karen Boccalero has done with the Latino artists, Alferov said. "For the 
artists it is a confidence builder and gives historical value to their work as 
it becomes part of a major collection." 
</P>
<P>
Self-Help Graphics began producing prints in 1982 by inviting Chicano artists 
from East Los Angeles to collaborate with master printers. The Laguna museum 
plans to exhibit the prints in a series of exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
Two fourth-grade classes from San Pedro Street School in downtown Los Angeles 
will participate in a new educational outreach program set up at the County 
Museum of Art in conjunction with the exhibition "The New Vision: Photography 
Between the World Wars." The program, called "Family Keepsakes," includes 
activities in both the museum and the classroom. The goal of "Family Keepsakes" 
is to introduce children to photography and other media as a means of creative 
expression and interpretation of the world around them. 
</P>
<P>
Students in the program will create their own family keepsakes -- an album of 
photographs, drawings or other objects they have created and collected. These 
projects will then be circulated by the museum's Education Department to 
schools and public libraries throughout the L.A. area begining in the fall of 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE SCENE 
</P>
<P>
Art dealers Richard Heller and Bennett Roberts are no longer content with 
simply running their own Richard/Bennett Gallery on La Brea Avenue. The two 
have now taken to curating shows for other galleries, the first of which is 
"The New Fabricants," a show featuring 14 emerging artists, which opened Friday 
at Santa Monica's Richard Green Gallery. Other curatorial projects underway for 
the duo include a group show opening June 21 at S. Bitter-Larkin Gallery in New 
York and a show scheduled for next February at Peter Weber Gallery in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
Neo-pop artist Jim Evans will be honored on Wednesday at a special reception at 
6:30 p.m. at the Karl Bornstein Gallery in Santa Monica. On view for the 
one-night only will be 30 of Evans' original monoprints, proceeds from the sale 
of which will benefit Westside Sane/Freeze, a national peace and nuclear 
disarmament organization. 
</P>
<P>
Evans was commissioned by Westside Sane/Freeze to create a work commemorating 
the eighth anniversary of the United Nations Special Session on Nuclear 
Disarmament, as well as the January, 1991, U.N. Conference on Disarmament. The 
work, "End of the Dream," depicts Albert Einstein surrounded by symbols of the 
nuclear arms race and the scientist's famous quote, "You cannot simultaneously 
prevent and prepare for war."

HEALTH-CARE CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thanks to Jonathan Freedman for his two-part series, "No Care Mothers -- No 
Hope Babies," (Commentary, May 15-16). It was a good start at touching on the 
health-care crisis we presently have in this state, as well as country. What he 
failed to point out was that even insured babies can be doomed by the system. 
</P>
<P>
My children were planned and born into an insured, loving environment. When my 
eldest daughter was 3, she was operated on for a blocked kidney. One can hardly 
find the words to describe the range of emotions a parent goes through when 
something of that magnitude happens to her child. The only thing that allowed 
us some peace of mind was that we had good health coverage, which enabled her 
the best care available. Little did we realize that the true crisis was yet to 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
Today, four years later, our daughter happily runs and plays, her world filled 
with kittens, school and friends. Today, we, her parents, face having her 
uninsured. Our insurance company has raised our rates 100% every year, to the 
current rate of $9,000 a year. And looming ahead -- $18,000? 
</P>
<P>
We have a stack of rejection letters from other health insurers. They will 
insure everyone but our eldest. She cannot qualify for Medi-Cal because they 
take into account her parents' salary. Ironically, our taxes help fund this. 
Unfortunately she (we) are neither rich enough to continue paying what amounts 
to blackmail, nor poor enough to qualify for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Health rights are survival rights. There are no easy answers. Politicians often 
use the phrase "the children are our future." But where is their future without 
the right to medical care? We need to be advocates for the basic rights of all 
children or we end up with a separatist, discriminatory state. Children caught 
in the bind of "pre-existing" conditions face a dark, uncertain future.

BAY HEALTH CONTROVERSY SURFACES AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
POLLUTION: SCIENTISTS, BUREAUCRATS AND POLITICIANS NEED TO COME TO A CONSENSUS 
ON HOW TO DEAL WITH ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS IN SAN DIEGO BAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYN GREENE, Lyn Greene is assistant to the San Diego Interagency Water 
Quality Panel. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With almost routine reports of raw sewage spills and the discovery of illegally 
dumped toxic wastes, it seems obvious that San Diego Bay is a mess. But, for 
nearly 40 years, a debate has raged about the pollution, and no one can seem to 
agree what to do about it. 
</P>
<P>
Now environmentalism is back -- propelled by TV stars celebrating Earth Day and 
the reality of a drought. And, just as it has during the last three decades, 
San Diego Bay has resurfaced as a topic of discussion in local politics. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, politicians and experts are trying to decide how polluted the bay 
really is and what, if anything, should be done about it. And, once again, 
studies have been conducted, and everyone is arguing about the results. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Unified Port District has just announced the findings of its 
study of the bay and has given the bay a relatively clean bill of health. The 
county Department of Health Services is about to announce the results of its 
own health risk study. The port's conclusions already have been questioned. 
Undoubtedly, the health services department's data will be disputed as well. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the results of scientific studies of the bay's sediments, fish and 
water have been the subject of controversy since 1950. That year, the Regional 
Water Quality Control Board declared that domestic sewage was the crux of the 
bay's pollution problem. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s, the citizens of San Diego were the major obstacle to 
cleaning up the bay. The Regional Water board made specific recommendations for 
cleanup, but the voters defeated the city of San Diego's bond measure to pay 
for the development of a better sewage system. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1950s, the city passed and implemented a sewage removal program 
that resulted in a much-improved bay. By the mid-1960s, the bay had recovered 
from its polluted state to become the center of San Diego's growing tourism 
industry. In 1970, the National Observer declared that the by was "the cleanest 
metropolitan harbor in the world" -- a far cry from the bay of the early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
But signs of a different type of pollution problem began to surface at the same 
time that the bay was being heralded as a model of cleanliness. Routine 
sampling of the bay's water and sediments began to show unsafe concentrations 
of industrial wastes. Fifteen years' worth of studies and monitoring have 
confirmed that the bay is polluted with toxic wastes. 
</P>
<P>
Assured that the wastes were a significant problem, the Regional Water board 
shifted its attention to monitoring the problem. Its proposed solution, in 
1985, was a five-year plan designed to study water quality problems, identify 
the responsible polluting parties, and pursue cleanup options. But the plan 
became the center of controversy because, for the first time, it suggested 
action, not just study. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Bay Cleanup Project is now in its third year and the lion's share 
of its efforts have been sunk in further studies of the bay's problems. 
Scientists working around the bay continue to debate the findings of all of 
these studies and to call for even more studies. 
</P>
<P>
A legislative attempt to address the problem of too much research and too 
little action resulted in the creation of the San Diego Interagency Water 
Quality Panel. The "bay panel" brought together the various agencies and 
entities studying the bay to share information and coordinate action. But even 
this entity, specifically charged with the responsibility of helping coordinate 
efforts around the bay, hesitated to recommend cleanup action. Instead, this 
body of scientists suggested better ways of doing more meaningful studies. 
</P>
<P>
Why can't scientists come to some kind of agreement on the bay's problems and 
then act to solve and prevent further ones? 
</P>
<P>
The problem is fragmentation. The bay is the responsibility of numerous 
agencies and entities that focus on separate and disparate aspects of its 
environment. One agency studies mussels to monitor pollutant levels. Several 
agencies sample different fish to measure pollutants. Other agencies take 
sediment samples to determine where excessive levels of pollutants might rest. 
Some sample the water itself and monitor the movement of pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
And what these scientists have found in their studies are various levels of 
pollution. Their findings are different and their data is barely comparable 
because methods of gathering information differ and the geographic areas 
studied differ as well. And so they can rightfully argue that, from their 
perspective, their conclusions are correct and the conclusions of other studies 
have little relation to their own. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a scientist who has been studying the water quality of the bay for 
several years stated that, in his opinion, the bay is healthy, except for a few 
toxic hot spots. He dives for sediment samples, and, after testing them for 
pollutants, he has determined that the levels are not harmful. His statement is 
based on what he has gathered and analyzed. But would a doctor declare the 
patient perfectly healthy if he found a few tumors spread throughout the body 
of the patient? 
</P>
<P>
It is time for the doctors to work as a team to determine the health of the 
patient. The scientists have to come out from behind the cloak of their 
research, take the separate findings of the studies performed and reach some 
conclusions on actions to help the patient recover. Otherwise these fragmented 
efforts at studying the illness will all be in progress, but the autopsy will 
show that the patient died from lack of attention.

MISSING THE MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wow! Did your letter writers McCray, Blethen and Grisolia ever miss the mark 
about Light Up the Border ("Border Lights," June 3). 
</P>
<P>
The anger and frustration expressed by the Light Up the Border people is 
directed at the governmental representatives who have refused to believe the 
seriousness of crime and lawlessness at the border. 
</P>
<P>
We protest the existence of that crime and lawlessness and lay the blame at the 
doorsteps of the truly guilty. We lay it justly on the doorsteps of the people 
primarily responsible for the conditions that allow it to exist; that is, the 
elected representatives of local, state and federal bodies and agencies. 
</P>
<P>
It is their neglect of the border and its function that is responsible for the 
deaths of little boys and unsophisticated adults from the interior of Mexico, 
not law-abiding Americans protesting the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that the vast number of casualties in the border violence are 
Mexican nationals. But the headlights don't destroy dreams (per McCray) unless 
they are attached to a car on I-5 (as Grisolia notes). Insensitive politicians 
who are clearly concerned with their own agendas do, even here.

MURRAY BEATS SHOW, PADRES IN 11TH, 5-4 
</P>

<P>
The Padre players were huddled around an 8-year-old handicapped boy in the 
dugout before Saturday's game against the Dodgers when pitcher Eric Show walked 
up and introduced himself. They chatted for awhile, and Show started to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll see you around," Show said. 
</P>
<P>
Show took two steps, stopped, and said: "Well, come to think of it, I don't 
know if I'll still be around." 
</P>
<P>
He laughed weakly, looked toward his teammates, and no one was smiling. It 
might have been intended as a humorous comment, but unfortunately for Show, it 
was much more truthful than funny. 
</P>
<P>
Show was the man who surrendered Eddie Murray's 11th-inning home run Saturday 
night at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, resulting in the Padres' 5-4 defeat to 
the Dodgers, triggering an onslaught of abuse by the 40,794 fans in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
The moment Murray's home run cleared the right-field fence -- his second of the 
game and the 10th time in his career he homered from each side of the plate -- 
baseball and debris rained onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
There were at least five baseballs that came flying from the stands onto the 
field, among oranges, cups and other nasty odds and ends. Poor right fielder 
Tony Gwynn had to head for cover for his own safety. 
</P>
<P>
But he knew, just like everyone on the field, who was the subject of the fans' 
tirade. Yes, Show still is the Padres' all-time leading pitcher with 94 
victories, but when you're 0-6 with an 8.31 ERA, fans could care less about 
yesterday's heroics. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Manager Jack McKeon, angry at the fans' reaction, said: "We've got 10 
pitchers on the club. "I don't take a poll every night to see who to put in. 
(Calvin) Schiraldi has been gone four days. This guy's been the winningest 
pitcher in Padres' history, and he's the most-experienced guy on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave up seven home runs in two nights, and I didn't hear anybody say 
anything. When you come in to relieve, there's no margin for error. 
</P>
<P>
"You think Eric wanted to give up the home run? He'll never get to be 1-6 
unless he gets to go out there." 
</P>
<P>
Show's one-inning performance ruined he heroism of the Padres' bullpen, which 
had allowed just two hits in the previous five innings in relief of starter 
Bruce Hurst. 
</P>
<P>
It also snapped the Padres' four-game winning streak. The Padres (29-25), 
winners of 11 of their past 15 games, still however were able to stay 6 1/2 
games behind the division-leading Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
"They play the game so well," Show said. "And I come in one inning and kind of 
botch things up. I'm real sorry I let (McKeon) down on his decision that he 
made. It makes him probably more reluctant to bring me in next time, but I 
understand his situation." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres overcame a 4-0 deficit to tie the game in the eighth inning. But it 
took just until the sixth inning to figure out Dodger starter Fernando 
Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
After getting just one hit off Valenzuela in the first five innings -- a double 
by second baseman Roberto Alomar in the fourth -- the Padres unloaded with 
three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Bip Roberts ended a one-for-15 slump with a leadoff double. After Alomar flied 
to right, Tony Gwynn singled to center, scoring Roberts. Joe Carter struck out 
for the second out, but then Jack Clark stepped up and belted a 1-1 pitch over 
the center-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the Dodgers' commanding 4-0 lead had been cut to 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres kept threatening. Benito Santiago walked, and Mike Pagliarulo 
singled to right. But that was enough for Dodger Manager Tommy Lasorda. He 
summoned Don Aase, who promptly induced a groundout by Garry Templeton. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres were in prime position to at least tie the game in the seventh when 
Roberts hit a one-out single to right, and snickered in delight as right 
fielder Hubie Brooks' throw sailed over cutoff man Juan Samuel's head, past 
pitcher Tim Crews and through third baseman Mike Sharperson into foul 
terrority. Roberts took second, and now just needed a single by Alomar or Gwynn 
to score. No luck. Alomar lined out to left field, and Gwynn grounded to 
second. 
</P>
<P>
But in the eighth, Joe Carter changed everything when he homered into the 
left-field seats, tying the game. It was the first time this season that Carter 
and Clark have homered in the same game. And for Carter, eight of his past 19 
hits have been homers. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres threatened to put the game away after Carter's homer, loading the 
bases with two outs in the eighth. But Roberts popped up to first baseman 
Murray, keeping the game tied. 
</P>
<P>
They threatened again in the ninth and 10th innings, but came away empty-handed 
each time. In the ninth, Carter stretched a single into a two-out double. 
Howell intentionally walked Clark, and ended the inning by getting Santiago to 
hit a bouncer back to the mound. And in the 10th, pinch-runner Shawn Abner was 
left standing at third. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, some things never change. The Padres still can't score for Hurst, 
and didn't begin their attack until after he left in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, the Padres have scored two or fewer runs in eight of Hurst's 12 
starts this season while he has been in the game. For the season, they've 
scored just 25 runs during the 80 innings he has pitched. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, even if the Padres had been scoring early, Hurst probably would not 
have been around to reap the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
It was evident early that this would not be his night. It doesn't take a 
baseball scout to tell you that after watching Jose Gonzalez and Mike 
Sharperson open the game by lining shots to left field, with left fielder Bip 
Roberts doing everything he can to keep the balls from tearing the glove off 
his hand. 
</P>
<P>
But beginning in the second, there was little anyone could do to help Hurst. 
Murray opened the inning with a towering home run into the left-field seats, 
his sixth of the season and first in 62 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers kept piling it on, scoring another run in the second inning, and 
two more in the fourth on Hubie Brooks' homer over the left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
For Brooks, it simply was a continuation of his dominance over Hurst. This was 
the same guy, if you remember, who ruined Hurst's debut in the season-opener 
with a three-run homer in the eighth inning. He now is batting .571 (four for 
seven) off Hurst with two homers, five RBIs and four runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
And for the Padres, it simply was a continuation of their nasty habit of 
surrendering the long ball. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres not only have have yielded a major league-leading 68 home runs this 
season, but they now are on a pace to shatter the National League record. If 
they continue at this pace, the Padres will allow 204 home runs by the end of 
the season, eclipsing the league record of 192 allowed by the 1962 New York 
Mets at the Polo Grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Padres signed their second-round draft pick, pitcher Scott Sanders of 
Nicholls State, for about $97,000, according to sources. Sanders, a 6-foot-4, 
215-pound righthander, is a breaking ball pitcher with a fastball in the low 
80s. Sanders worked out Saturday at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium before the 
game. His biggest problem? Finding baseball shoes to fit his size-11 feet. . . 
. So far, the highest-paid draft choice is No. 4 pick Alex Sanchez of the 
Chicago White Sox, who signed for a reported $350,000. . . . Padre starter Ed 
Whitson, who suffered a strained back during the Padres' 12-6 victory Friday 
over the Dodgers, said that he had his back popped back in place, and is not 
expected to miss a start. . . . Padre reliever Greg Harris, who gave up two 
home runs in just 1 1/3 innings Friday: "I just wasn't ready. Things happened 
so fast that I think that was the first time in my life I wasn't mentally 
prepared when I came into the game. I didn't even know who the first batter I 
was facing until he walked up to the plate." It was Kal Daniels, who hit a 
homer on the first pitch. . . . Padre Manager Jack McKeon said that the 
Milwaukee Brewers also telephoned him in an effort to move outfielder Glenn 
Braggs, but he was unwilling to give up any of his five starters. . . . McKeon, 
on the fact that until Saturday relievers Mark Grant and Calvin Schiraldi had 
pitched in a game since June 1: "Really, I don't want to see them in there, 
because if they're not in there, that means we're doing good." . . . Third 
baseman Mike Pagliarulo's three-hit game Friday night was his first as a Padre, 
and his first since May 19, 1989 against Seattle when he was with the New York 
Yankees. . . . Just how crazy was Friday's National League action? There were 
98 runs scored in six National League games, with the league batting .312 with 
22 home runs. . . . The Padres will conclude their three-game series against 
the Dodgers at 1:05 p.m. today. Andy Benes (6-4) is scheduled to face Ramon 
Martinez (6-3). The Padres are off Monday, and then will finish their homestand 
with a three-game series against the San Francisco Giants. Dennis Rasmussen 
(6-2) and Don Robinson (1-0) are scheduled Tuesday; Ed Whitson (5-3) and Bob 
Knepper (3-3) are scheduled Wednesday. And Bruce Hurst (5-3) and Atlee Hammaker 
(4-4) are the probable starters Thursday.

It has been 2 1/2 years and more than 30 competitions since Deena Mapple, a 
native of Sacramento, has lost a water-ski jumping competition. 
</P>
<P>
But there were signs Saturday that Mapple's streak might fall during 
first-round competition of the Michelob Dry Water-Ski Tour at Fiesta Island on 
Mission Bay. Mapple came up with a jump four feet shy of Sherri Slone's 
138-feet. But Slone, 24, said that's not unusual -- or that meaningful. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in the lead after the first round four times," said Slone, a 
Louisiana State University student. "Unfortunately, today doesn't mean that 
much." 
</P>
<P>
Slone, in her second year on tour, said it will probably take a jump into the 
high 140s to win the title. Slone said Mapple, who is tied with Lisa Simoneau 
for second, will once again be the one to beat. 
</P>
<P>
"She's pretty much set the pace for all of us," Slone said. "She's been doing 
it for such a long time. She knows exactly how to do it and when. I look up to 
her and just hope to be as good as she is someday." 
</P>
<P>
Simoneau, 29, said: "I think her success is built on her strength and 
technique. She's also got tremendous confidence that no one is going to beat 
her." 
</P>
<P>
But Simoneau said Mapple's dominance might be ending soon. 
</P>
<P>
"The margin has been narrowing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mapple, who also leads the women's slalom event by 2 1/2 buoys over Kristi 
Overton, said she is becoming numb to the pressure of keeping her streak alive. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I've been fortunate to have won for this long -- to stay healthy this 
long," said Mapple, 30. "I'm not superhuman. I expect to get beat. In fact, it 
would almost be a relief to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Mapple hinted she might soon decide to give up the sport that has been a part 
of her life since she was 2 1/2 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best I've felt in a couple years, but I think maybe it's time to 
do something else -- like maybe have kids," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Andy Mapple, trails Brett Thurley in the men's slalom competition 
by one-half buoy entering today's finals. 
</P>
<P>
Mapple, the men's slalom world-record holder, will be matched with Mike 
Kjellander in today's semifinals. Thurley will face Lucky Lowe in the other 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's ski jumping preliminaries, Australia's Geoff Carrington and Bruce 
Neville are first and second with jumps of 191 and 189 feet. Neville's cousin, 
Mick, is third with a jump of 175. 
</P>
<P>
Carrington, who won the world championships in 1986 and 1989, said the 
saltwater conditions of Mission Bay are to his liking. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the (salt)water is softer," Carrington said. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Ellis and Kjellander finished fourth and fifth with jumps of 173 and 172 
and also qualified for the finals. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's freestyle competition, Mike Tolzman leads Dave Reinhart by 57 
points. Dave Dotter and Hank Amos also qualified for the finals. 
</P>
<P>
Today's competition begins at 1 p.m. with the women's jump finals.

THREE TENNIS GREATS TAKE FANS FOR WALTZ DOWN MEMORY LANE

Waiters in white jackets moved quickly through the stands offering bowls of 
strawberries and cream to ladies in straw hats and pretty dresses. 
</P>
<P>
"Aren't the strawberries lovely, darling," said one woman to her companion. 
</P>
<P>
This wasn't a scene out of the Great Gatsby, nor was it an afternoon at 
Wimbledon, where snacks of strawberries and cream are as traditional as its 
rules of white-only tennis attire. 
</P>
<P>
But Saturday at John Gardiner's Rancho Valencia Resort in Rancho Santa Fe, 
three legends of men's tennis took center court and waltzed down memory lane in 
a charity tennis event to benefit Scripps Memorial Hospital's Stevens Cancer 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the audience did most of the waltzing. All-time greats Pancho Segura, 
Ken Rosewall and Vic Seixas were busy drawing gasps of recollection and delight 
from a gallery that was seeing them now, after having seen, or heard about, the 
way they dominated the game in their primes. 
</P>
<P>
"See that two-handed forehand," said a gentleman who recognized one of Segura's 
trademark strokes. "He was doing that years before anyone else was." 
</P>
<P>
"He still has that beautiful form he had when he played Rod Laver," said 
another admirer. 
</P>
<P>
Segura, Rosewall, Seixas, and Ted Schroeder, who didn't play, were to be 
inducted into Gardiner's Bridge of Champions after a morning of exhibition 
singles and doubles matches, but rain delayed play for hours. 
</P>
<P>
During that time, Gardiner introduced the players to fans who had paid $100 for 
a day of tennis with the stars, or $1,500 for the weekend. Laver and Jack 
Kramer were also to have been inducted, but were unable to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Segura teamed with Sam Nunez, the resort's head professional, against Rosewall 
and Seixas in an eight-game pro set. The players were engaging, the tennis was 
entertaining. But a championship, with thousands of dollars on the line, this 
was not. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know you could still hit that shot," Seixas said after Segura tricked 
his opponents with a perfectly placed lob. 
</P>
<P>
"Move faster Pancho, faster," Segura scolded himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, you guys are serious," said Rosewall after Nunez drilled a volley down the 
middle. But Rosewall and Seixas eventually won, 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
Rosewall, 55, is the touring pro for Gardiner's tennis resorts in Arizona and 
Northern California. When he is not conducting clinics or playing on the men's 
senior tennis tour, he runs two tennis facilities on the Gold Coast of 
Australia. He lives in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
Rosewall said that during his prime he didn't realize he could make a living 
playing tennis. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fortunate the growth of the sport has allowed us to stay in it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rosewall, Australia is going through a drought of top players, and 
he is hoping that change is on the way. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat Cash was our last player to win at Wimbledon," Rosewall said. "Hopefully, 
we can come up with some players and bring Australia back to the top." 
</P>
<P>
It has been 40 years since Segura, who turns 69 June 20, left his native 
Ecuador to make a life of tennis in the United States. It's a move he has never 
regretted. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a dream come true," said Segura, who has been the resident pro at La 
Costa for 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
Since Segura's reign in the 1940s and '50s, Ecuador, a small South American 
country, has produced few top players. Today in Paris, one of them -- Andres 
Gomez -- meets American Andre Agassi for the French Open men's singles title. 
</P>
<P>
"I am proud," said Segura, wearing a bright pink and black Nike shirt that 
Agassi has made famous. "Gomez and myself. We are the best Ecuador has 
produced. We are such a small country. There are only, maybe 4,000 tennis 
players there."

THE SOCKERS: 1990 MISL CHAMPIONS; 
</P>
<P>
SOCKERS' TITLE OVERSHADOWED BY NAGGING QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A championship, a trophy, champagne and hundreds of people cheering at the 
airport are nice. For a while. Then reality returns and the flaws begin to roll 
across and block a bit of the sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
A question went unanswered all season by the Sockers. Why were they so mediocre 
at times? Mediocrity isn't becoming to a team that has been atop the MISL for 
so many years. 
</P>
<P>
Friday in Baltimore, they won their eighth indoor championship, defeating a 
Blast team that had a record of 32-20 during the regular season, best in the 
league. The Sockers were 25-27. 
</P>
<P>
If the championship helped heal the bruises, it didn't exactly answer the 
question. 
</P>
<P>
That bothers defender Kevin Crow. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of problems this year," he said. "That all gets covered up 
because you win. I don't think that's right. You can't forget we were 25 and 
27. There's no good reason for it. We definitely should have been a much better 
team during the season." 
</P>
<P>
Why they weren't successful is difficult to explain. Things certainly improved 
in March, when Zoran Karic was traded to Cleveland for Paul Wright, who gave 
the Sockers added speed and a more complete defense. But the Sockers took their 
time even after Wright's arrival. They waited for the playoffs before lifting 
their game and mystifying their opponents the way they have done so often in 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
Crow thinks the Sockers are due for a few adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think there's got to be a fresh and a new attitude brought into this 
team," he said. "I think we can definitely become a better team next year." 
</P>
<P>
To do that, he suggests a more structured training schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying we have to run like dogs," he said. "I'm saying we have to 
become better players. And that comes down to training." 
</P>
<P>
The guy in the middle of all of this is Socker Coach Ron Newman. Newman has won 
eight championships, but the bottom line is he still doesn't command a lot of 
respect from his team. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not enough respect all the way down to the rookies," Crow said. "And 
that's something that's got to be addressed." 
</P>
<P>
It has often been said that Newman would be lost without all the talent. He has 
a response. 
</P>
<P>
"My answer is, this isn't the only team I've ever won with," Newman said. "I've 
won without (these players)." 
</P>
<P>
True enough. He has championships in both the American Soccer League and the 
North American Soccer League. Newman's strengths have always been his knack for 
knowing when to leave players alone, his keen eye for talent and his ability to 
use the rules to his advantage. 
</P>
<P>
But Newman has been criticized for not providing necessary technical 
instruction to younger players, and not being capable of motivating and 
communicating with the team on a consistent basis. 
</P>
<P>
With one-year remaining on his contract, Newman said he fully expects to be 
back next year. Right now, he isn't sure about when he wants to retire and 
wonders if he wouldn't be bored without the pressures and challenges of 
coaching. He said he wouldn't rule out the possibility of coaching for another 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"A brand new franchise," he said. "Somewhere where there are no ghosts. It 
would be an interesting challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Then again . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'd have to weigh the pros and cons. As you get older, you're really not that 
much of a gypsy. I've really always felt that I'd like to stay here for good." 
</P>
<P>
Without question, his job isn't simple. Problems started before this season 
began when Socker Owner Ron Fowler and President Ron Cady decided that Steve 
Zungul should be signed to a preseason contract as a reward for his 
contributions to last year's championship. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, Zungul, who is 35 and has arthritic hips, wasn't willing to 
accept his role as a reserve player and Newman wasn't willing to play him on 
the basis of his clipping file. Zungul and Newman's strained relationship 
smoldered all season and had an adverse effect on midfielder Branko Segota, who 
really only played to his potential during the championship series. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers managed to escape their problems this season, but Crow isn't sure 
they can continue to do that unless key players such as Segota can turn in 
better performances earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Branko and some of these guys have got to realize it's not like the old days," 
Crow said. "You can't go on cruise control during the regular season." 
</P>
<P>
Cruise control won't do in the off-season either. There are problems to solve. 
Crow said there will likely be a 10% to 15% reduction in the salary cap, 
currently at $875,000. Maximum player salaries will go from $90,000 to $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
That means the Sockers of today won't all be the Sockers of tomorrow. Many 
players deserve raises, but with the cap going backward rather than forward 
some veterans with higher salaries might have to be gone. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's just a pretty unfortunate situation," midfielder Brian Quinn 
said. "You win a championship and you'd like to reward everybody, but you can't 
because of the financial problems in the league."

PITZER COLLEGE HOSTS SESSION ABOUT GAYS FOR OLDER STUDENTS

<P>
Meinard Kooiker, 66, decided it was time to go back to school after learning 
six months ago that her daughter is a lesbian. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Kooiker, of Minneapolis, joined 22 other people from around the 
country for a Pitzer College study session on gay and lesbian issues. 
</P>
<P>
The session is part of Elderhostel, an inexpensive educational and travel 
program for people 60 and over. Most of the older students at Pitzer were 
parents of gay and lesbian children. Others were gay or lesbian themselves; 
some just came for the knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Kooiker, whose daughter is 26 years old, came to be with other parents of gays 
and lesbians. "When I saw this course in the (Elderhostel) catalogue, I knew I 
had to come," the retired social worker said. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to learn as much as I can. . . . Sitting in these classes, I'm 
beginning to understand the hell society has put them (gays and lesbians) 
through." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Boston-based Elderhostel program isn't new, this is Pitzer's first 
session of courses ranging from homosexuality in Ancient Greece to child 
custody battles of lesbian mothers today, said Jiggs Gallagher, director of 
Elderhostel in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is watching Pitzer to see what happens," said Selia Sacks, program 
director of the Northern California Elderhostel program in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Elderhostel began in 1975 with five colleges. Today, it includes 1,600 colleges 
and universities, private schools, national parks and a variety of other 
educational institutions across the country and around the world. Even though 
there is a wide variety of choices available, most courses dwell on pursuits 
such as country music, art, photography, folk dancing, literature, poetry and 
golf. 
</P>
<P>
The $250 charge covers accommodation in college dorms, three meals a day at 
school dining halls, five days of classes (three courses a day), and a variety 
of extracurricular activities, including field trips, movies and dances. 
Courses are not for credit and there are no exams or homework. 
</P>
<P>
"The founding philosophy behind Elderhostel is that learning is a lifelong 
process and it can enrich your life," said Cady Goldfield, representative of 
Elderhostel in Boston. "The course at Pitzer falls into this realm. It might be 
a little more controversial than other courses, but it's typical of the 
challenging topics available. . . . We are always interested in keeping up with 
current issues." 
</P>
<P>
All nonprofit institutions that participate in Elderhostel choose their own 
courses; the only restriction is that the classes cannot deal with geriatrics. 
</P>
<P>
"Pitzer's program is very innovative, and it's expanding the Elderhostel 
program to a new audience, an audience whose needs has not really been met," 
Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who began the gay and lesbian program at Pitzer say this small, private 
liberal arts college was ideal for this set of courses. "When it comes to gay 
and lesbian issues, Pitzer is taking the leadership within the Claremont 
community," said Dr. Lourdes Arguelles, associate professor of Women's Studies, 
who taught the course on "Issues in Lesbian Studies." 
</P>
<P>
Pitzer is the only one among the six Claremont Colleges to offer a course in 
lesbian studies during regular school sessions. It hosted an international gay 
and lesbian conference in April, and Pitzer students recently voted to ban ROTC 
on campus because of the military's discrimination against homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to start a gay and lesbian studies here and we thought the 
Elderhostel program would be a great way to test some ideas," said Pieter 
Judson, a history professor at Pitzer who taught the Sexuality Through the Ages 
course. "We weren't really sure what to expect. But we were all very curious." 
</P>
<P>
Last week's session was broken into three classes a day. The first, "Issues in 
Lesbian Studies," dealt with the "coming out" process of acknowledging 
homosexuality, as well as other problems facing lesbians, such as child custody 
battles with previous husbands. 
</P>
<P>
The second class, "Sexuality Through the Ages," covered lesbian and gay culture 
from Ancient Greece to 19th Century United States and the significance of 
same-sex relationships in history. The last class, "Contemporary Topics in Gay 
Studies," dealt with gay political and social movements in the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The students also took a field trip to West Hollywood to tour the Gay and 
Lesbian Community Service Center, the oldest and largest social services agency 
for gays and lesbians in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"What we want is to educate as many people as we can on the complexity and 
diversity of gay and lesbian issues," said Peter Nardi, sociology professor at 
Pitzer who taught the third class. 
</P>
<P>
Arguelles said that, for most of the older students, this was the first formal 
instruction they have had on gay and lesbian issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Some might be very active in gay and lesbian community centers and 
organizations, but they have never really studied the many issues involved," 
Arguelles said. "There are many issues of concern to gay and lesbian seniors 
that are similar to heterosexuals, but they also have very different concerns, 
such as inheritance laws, which ignore homosexual couples." 
</P>
<P>
Some participants said the program gave them a chance to break stereotypes that 
people have of the elderly. "This is a week not to be old," said Joan Miller, 
66, of San Francisco. "A week not to be ignored and treated like you don't 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Young lesbians don't like old lesbians; there is a lot of prejudice," she 
said. "I came here to meet women and have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
Nardi agreed: "We live in a very youth-oriented society. Older people's needs 
are usually ignored, whether they're homosexual or heterosexual." 
</P>
<P>
Then there were those, like 85-year-old Linnea Ross, who had never known anyone 
who is gay or lesbian, but wanted to come for the "intellectual stimulation." 
</P>
<P>
"I live alone in a mobile home park and the biggest excitement is bingo," said 
Ross, of Pomona. "The only thing I knew about gays was what I saw in gay parade 
. . . I just wanted to learn more."

BRYANT RECALL CHANGES FACE OF THE COUNCIL; 
</P>

GOVERNMENT: HE HAD PROMISED SWEEPING CHANGES AS HEAD OF THE CITY COUNCIL'S 'NEW 
MAJORITY.' INSTEAD, VOTERS SWEPT HIM FROM OFFICE AND ENLARGED THE COUNCIL.

<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago, C. L. (Clay) Bryant was riding high as head of the City Council's 
"new majority" that promised sweeping changes in city government for the 
benefit of the disadvantaged and downtrodden. 
</P>
<P>
The council shook up city government, but not as drastically as voters did last 
week, when they tossed Bryant out of office, enlarged the council from four 
members to six, plus the mayor, and adopted a new system of electing council 
members by district. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant will leave office shortly after the results of last week's election are 
certified in a few weeks; the council will call a special election this fall to 
replace him, and voters will elect four other council members and a mayor in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
Of the current council, only Councilman Tomas Ursua is assured of serving more 
than another 10 months. His term expires in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Ursua was clearly the big winner in Tuesday's election. A former member of 
Bryant's "new majority," he broke with Bryant earlier this year and advocated 
his recall. He also supported the proposal to elect council members by district 
rather than citywide. 
</P>
<P>
Ursua said Bryant was ousted because he had alienated so many voters with his 
statements and tactics. "In the last few months, the guy became a demagogue," 
he said. Melody Peterson, who co-chaired the committee that worked to recall 
Bryant, said the public become fed up with his "bizarre statements and bullying 
tactics." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant had another explanation. "There was a hate group that really did a job," 
he said. Bryant said he had hoped to refute what he called the lies that had 
been spread about him by addressing voters watching the cable telecast of the 
City Council meeting on the day before the election. His plans were foiled when 
the council voted to cut its meeting short, eliminating the customary time 
reserved for statements from the council and the public. 
</P>
<P>
The council meeting ended in an uproar, with Bryant supporters in the audience 
shouting to be heard and one woman screaming obscenities. 
</P>
<P>
By last week's recall election, Bryant had become so politically isolated, he 
said, that he was not surprised when the results showed that voters by a better 
than 2-1 margin wanted him removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, 70, said he will continue attending meetings of the council until it 
certifies the election results and then he will retire from politics. He said 
the June 25 council meeting probably will be his last. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worked hard," he said. "I've had no problem with what I have done. I've 
tried to help people." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant said he prided himself on his efforts to help minorities, the homeless 
and the impoverished; his service to constituents in cutting through red tape, 
and his careful reading of budgets and legal documents to spot loopholes and 
overspending. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents said he berated city employees, traded votes with council 
colleagues in back-room deals and pushed projects that were ill-conceived. 
Feelings against him ran so high that someone painted out Bryant's name on his 
parking space at City Hall the morning after the election and painted in the 
number of votes against him. (Bryant's name was later restored). 
</P>
<P>
Bryant said he has no regrets about his use of blunt language, which made 
headlines and offended some people. He called Ursua a "Chicano gang member," a 
police officer a "psychiatric case," the mayor a "tramp" and his council 
colleagues generally "a bunch of mental cripples." 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is not always pretty," Bryant said. "If somebody else doesn't have 
the guts to tell the truth, I do." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant has served on the council off and on for 10 years since 1969. One of the 
few times he was aligned with a majority came last year, when Ursua was elected 
and teamed up with Bryant and Councilwoman Nell Soto. They fired the city 
administrator and police chief, accused the town's "good old boys" of 
shortsightedness and corruption and promised a new "people-oriented" 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The "new majority" began to fall apart after a few months. The turning point 
might have come when the council hired a new city administrator, Julio Fuentes, 
last November. Soto recruited Fuentes for the job, and Ursua became his strong 
supporter, but Bryant was a relentless critic. 
</P>
<P>
Ursua joined the recall effort, and Soto distanced herself from Bryant by 
saying that she was neither for nor against his recall. 
</P>
<P>
All the council members except Ursua suffered a political setback in Tuesday's 
elections. Soto was badly beaten, placing fifth in her quest to become a county 
supervisor. Councilman Mark A. T. Nymeyer, who was seeking the Republican 
nomination in a state Assembly district, lost by nearly 3 to 1, and fared 
almost as badly in Pomona as he did in the rest of the Assembly district. 
</P>
<P>
Even Mayor Donna Smith, who worked hard to recall Bryant, suffered a loss of 
sorts because Pomona voters approved a district election system she opposed. 
</P>
<P>
Ursua said the ouster of Bryant and the new district elections will remake 
Pomona politically. 
</P>
<P>
"The community voted for professionalism and political reform," he said. "The 
community is not going back to the old days when a few spoke for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, who also advocated district elections, said: "Now you're going to see 
the little guy get elected." Instead of having to raise money from special 
interests to campaign throughout a city of 120,000 residents, candidates will 
just talk to their neighbors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The election last week created the framework for district elections, but the 
City Council has not yet established district boundaries. The ordinance 
approved by voters declares that candidates must run in the districts where 
they live. 
</P>
<P>
Ursua and the winner of the special election to succeed Bryant will serve until 
the municipal elections in 1993. Soto and Nymeyer hold four-year terms that end 
next April, so they will have to run for reelection in districts to retain 
their seats. 
</P>
<P>
Two other newly created council seats also will be at stake next year, along 
with the post of mayor. 
</P>
<P>
With the recall campaign over, Smith said, she is looking forward to a period 
of political calm. She noted that council members last week supported her 
efforts to run more orderly meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Ursua said he, too, thinks more orderly council meetings are in store. "We will 
no longer let people rant and rave," he said. "This guerrilla warfare is over." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said she hopes "we can begin having some boring council meetings." 
</P>
<P>
But Bryant said he is not quite finished. He said he may seek a court 
injunction against the city if the council approves a proposal to give 
three-year contracts to the city administrator, police chief and fire chief. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, who has described himself as the public's "open window" at City Hall, 
released copies of the proposed contracts, which were submitted to the council 
in closed session last week. The contracts would provide financial protection 
to Fuentes, Fire Chief Tom Fee and Lloyd Wood, who is now police chief in Azusa 
but who has been talking with Pomona officials for months about becoming 
Pomona's chief. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant said the proposed agreements violate the City Charter, which says the 
city administrator serves at the pleasure of the council and that department 
heads can be removed by the administrator with council approval. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant said the financial penalty the city would incur in buying out three-year 
contracts would be so high that the council would not be free to remove the 
officials as intended by the charter. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes said council members suggested that the contracts be drawn up, but that 
he does not know whether the council members will approve them. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant said he will be watching closely. "They better not try it," he said.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Free Mail for Members 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 161 to 208, House members refused to appropriate an additional $25 
million to cover postage for their mailings back home this election year. The 
money was sought because the House is expected to spend nearly twice the $44.5 
million already appropriated for its franked mail in fiscal 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The vote occurred as the House sent a $4.4-billion spending bill (HR 4404) to 
the Senate. It showed members becoming increasingly sensitive to charges that 
they abuse the franking privilege. But it will have little practical effect 
because the Postal Service is required by law to deliver congressional mail 
even when appropriations for postage have run out. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento) said, "We are not seeing an excessive use of 
the frank" given the increased cost of processing constituent mail. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) said House members have become "addicted to 
free mail and maybe become franking junkies." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported more appropriations for House members' postage.

Aid to El Salvador 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 175 to 243, the House rejected a Republican plan that was the 
softer of two proposed cuts in U.S. military aid to the rightist government of 
El Salvador. The GOP proposal would have cut 25% from the Administration's 
fiscal 1990 aid request of $85 million if leftist rebels in the Salvadoran 
civil war took certain steps toward peace and other conditions were met. 
</P>
<P>
The House then approved a Democratic plan to halve the $85 million. But that 
50% cut was later voided, clearing the way for El Salvador to receive the full 
$85 million. The foreign aid bill under debate was HR 4636. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor William S. Broomfield (R-Mich.) called his amendment "a measured and 
balanced approach to the situation in El Salvador." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica) said the amendment dealt too lightly with 
human rights abuses by Salvadoran soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was for the softer of two proposed cuts in military aid to El 
Salvador.

Rights of the Disabled 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 148 to 266, the House refused to exempt communities of less than 
200,000 population from a requirement that virtually all newly acquired 
municipal buses in America be equipped with wheelchair lifts. Affected cities 
and towns could have gained the exemption by providing special transportation 
approved of in advance by the local disabled community. 
</P>
<P>
The vote occurred as the House sent to conference with the Senate a measure (HR 
2273) to protect the rights of the disabled at work and in their use of public 
accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Don J. Pease (D-Ohio) said the wheelchair-lift requirement works a 
financial hardship on struggling transit systems in smaller communities. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Norman Y. Mineta (D-San Jose) said, "A civil right to equal 
transportation does not diminish according to a city's population." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported the exemption for smaller communities.

PEOPLE IN THE NEWS: RESERVE OFFICER WINS AN HONOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles G. Ochoa, a reserve officer for the La Verne Police Department, was 
recently honored as one of four 1990 Casa Colina Rehabilitants of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa was paralyzed from the chest down after surgery to remove a cancerous 
tumor. 
</P>
<P>
After one month of inpatient rehabilitation, he returned to a full-time job as 
an engineering supervisor for Hughes Aircraft, as a reserve officer for the La 
Verne Police Department and as an instructor for the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Academy in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Also honored were Henry Lloyd Nearing of Pasadena, who sustained a serious 
brain injury after a motorcycle accident but returned to his position as a 
supervising attorney for the IRS after three months of rehabilitation; 
2-year-old Vanessa Nicole Sapien of Pomona, who was born with spina bifida and 
now is four to six months above normal in her cognitive development, and John 
Lopatkiewicz of Yucaipa, who suffered an aneurysm resulting in brain damage but 
is now back at his job at Southern Pacific Railroad.

AT HOME: 'BIKERS TOWN' SHIFTS TO HOMEY CYCLE; 
</P>
<P>
TUJUNGA: MOST OF THE MOTORCYCLISTS HAVE EITHER LEFT OR SETTLED DOWN, AND HOME 
VALUES COULD APPEAL TO FIRST-TIME BUYERS.

<P>
"Tujunga" is an ancient Indian word meaning "old woman of the earth." But 20 or 
30 years ago, a lot of people thought Tujunga meant "motorcycle gangs." 
</P>
<P>
No one really knows why so many long-haired, bearded young men on motorcycles, 
aligned in groups with names like "The Devil's Henchmen," chose to hang out in 
this workingman's community perched on the southwest slopes of the San Gabriel 
Mountains a half dozen miles north of downtown Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
But hang out they did, in droves, and Tujunga developed an unenviable 
reputation as one of Southern California's premier "biker towns." 
</P>
<P>
That reputation still survives to some extent, even though most of the bikers 
either left town long ago or else have undergone the settling down process that 
inevitably accompanies thinning hair, widening waistlines and advancing age. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents think the historically negative image is so strong as to be bad 
for business, and have suggested -- unsuccessfully so far -- that Tujunga 
distance itself from the past by changing its name. "Hill Haven" is one idea. 
</P>
<P>
But Tujunga by any other name would still be Tujunga. And for people interested 
in a small-town atmosphere and a chance to get into the Los Angeles housing 
market, Tujunga can be a place of opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to live anywhere else," said Evelyn Burdge, 70, who moved to 
Tujunga in 1938, seven years after Tujunga ceased being an independent city and 
was absorbed into the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Tujunga is bounded on the north by the San Gabriel Mounmtains, the west by Mt. 
Gleason Avenue, the east by Lowell Avenue and the south by the Foothill (210) 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Burdge now lives in a small, two-bedroom house on Olcott Street that she and 
her late husband bought for $5,750 just after World War II. She's not sure what 
its value is now, but the house next door to hers sold last year for $179,000. 
</P>
<P>
True, Burdge said: "We used to have a lot of motorcycle gangs here. But they 
finally ran 'em out of town. The ones that are still here are all family men 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Burdge's current concerns about the quality of life in Tujunga have nothing to 
do with motorcycles. Instead, they are concerns one might hear from residents 
of almost any Los Angeles community: too much quick growth, too much traffic. 
</P>
<P>
And even potential problems created by foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
"There are just too many apartments here now," Burdge said. "It used to be that 
you knew everybody when you went into town" -- town meaning the commercial area 
along Commerce Street and Foothill Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"But now you don't know anybody. And Tujunga Canyon is bumper-to-bumper every 
morning now because of all the apartments." Furthermore, Burdge said, "some of 
us aren't too happy" about a planned 18-hole private golf course and club that 
a Japanese firm called Cosmo World wants to build at the bottom of Big Tujunga 
Wash near Wentworth Street and Foothill Boulevard in nearby Sunland. The 
project is undergoing environmental impact review. 
</P>
<P>
"They say it won't increase traffic because all the members will be brought out 
here in limousines," Burdge said. "But I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Theobald, 74, like Burdge an almost life-long Tujunga resident, also 
worries about growth. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting too many apartment houses," Theobald said, "and traffic is worse 
than ever." Theobald, who grew up in Tujunga, worked for the U.S. Post Office 
there from 1938 until his retirement, and his wife, Jean, paid $4,500 for their 
three-bedroom home on Kyle Street in 1941, "and everyone wondered how we'd ever 
be able to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
He estimates its current value at $285,000. 
</P>
<P>
All things considered though, both Burdge and Theobald say, Tujunga is still 
fine with them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's close enough to the city, and far enough away too," Burdge said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lived here almost all my life, and I intend to stay here," Theobald said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Powell, 44, a Tujunga newcomer who owns a small typesetting business, 
shares the longtime residents' feelings about the community. A native of 
Baltimore, she has lived in a rented house on Helendale Avenue for only a few 
months, but eventually she'd like to buy a home in Tujunga. 
</P>
<P>
"Tujunga is small and manageable," Powell said. "Everything you need is within 
a few blocks. The air quality is better than in a lot of places" -- at 
1,700-plus feet above sea level, Tujunga is above at least some of the San 
Gabriel Valley smog -- "and in every direction I look I see mountains." 
</P>
<P>
Powell was aware of Tujunga's past reputation as a tough community when she 
moved there, but she has found that the community doesn't deserve that 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"You do see a few unsavory characters there, and an awful lot of motorcycles 
and pickup trucks," she said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, when I moved in, I noticed that there were motorcycles parked at the 
houses on either side of me. But since then I've met them (the neighbors) and 
they really are wonderful people." 
</P>
<P>
For the record, if one believes that any conclusions about a community can be 
drawn from the types of vehicles parked in driveways, a recent and admittedly 
unscientific survey of three residential blocks in Tujunga revealed a seemingly 
higher-than-average ratio of pickups to cars -- 29 trucks to 44 cars, none of 
them a Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, perhaps, there was only one motorcycle visible; however, the survey 
was conducted on a beautiful Tujunga day, warm and clear, perfect motorcycle 
weather, so the results may have been somewhat skewed. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best things about Tujunga, Powell said, is that housing is still 
affordable -- relatively, affordable, anyway -- "and that's certainly an 
attraction." 
</P>
<P>
According to realtors in the area, single-family homes in Tujunga average 
$200,000 to $250,000, although there are starters or fixer-uppers at about 
$125,000. The highest priced home that has come on the market recently in 
Tujunga is slightly over $600,000, but there are also "horse properties" in the 
area that can run $1 million plus. 
</P>
<P>
Those kind of prices are what prompted Kathy Talbott, 47, a former Glendale 
resident, to buy a home in Tujunga last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't like Tujunga that much," admitted Talbott, a financial 
representative at Verdugo Hills Hospital in Glendale. The streets need a lot of 
repairs, and there are still too many "unsavory characters" for her liking. 
</P>
<P>
"But let's face it," Talbott said, "It's one of the few places that's 
affordable." Talbott, who like Burdge lives on Olcott Street, says most of the 
homes in her neighborhood are in the $175,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
According to Joan Slater of Slater Realty Co., which specializes in property in 
the Tujunga-Sunland area, the majority of housing sales in recent months have 
been to prospective residents, not to investors looking for quick profits. 
"Low-end" properties have been the most active. 
</P>
<P>
Apartment rentals range from about $500 for a single to $800 for a two- or 
three-bedroom, making Tujunga a financially attractive location for younger 
people who can't yet afford to buy a home. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Tujunga's location on the Foothill (210) Freeway between the Glendale (2) 
Freeway and the San Diego (405) Freeway makes for easy commuting to either 
downtown or the Westside. That portion of the 210 is one of the least-used 
freeways in L.A.; barring the odd overturned tanker truck, it seems immune from 
traffic tie-ups. 
</P>
<P>
There are, then, a lot of reasons for prospective home buyers to forget about 
Tujunga's past and check out Tujunga present. It's small, affordable, easy to 
get to and from. 
</P>
<P>
And you don't have to ride a motorcycle to live there.

dream of home ownership -- but housing advocates warn that flaws in the program 
could turn it into a broken promise. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of moderately priced houses and apartments acquired by the federal 
Resolution Trust Corp. when it takes over assets of failed S&amp;Ls must, by 
law, be set aside so that lower-income families, nonprofit community groups and 
state or local housing agencies get the first chance to buy them, ahead of 
investors and higher-income home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
But the RTC's refusal so far to offer discount prices on the properties, 
combined with a shortage of mortgage money for low-income buyers, could shut 
out many of the people Congress hoped to help when it enacted the bailout law, 
say housing officials and advocacy groups. 
</P>
<P>
"The RTC isn't conforming to the spirit of the law," according to Maude Hurd, 
president of ACORN, a community activist group that led protest demonstrations 
at RTC regional offices around the country several days ago to demand price 
cuts and financing aid on RTC houses. 
</P>
<P>
However, the low-income housing program is also fundamentally at odds with the 
broader mandates of the S&amp;L bailout: to clean up the mess as quickly as 
possible and minimize the losses that will have to be paid by U.S. taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand the enormous problem that RTC is facing," said Richard West, an 
official of the Low Income Housing Coalition in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"They're walking a tightrope between trying to carry out the low-income housing 
program and, at the same time, the Congress and the U.S. public have a gun to 
their head to sell this stuff" without further losses to the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of competing interests in the legislation," said Steven 
Katsanos, communications director for the RTC. "The law says we're supposed to 
be selling property at market value, and we're supposed to reduce the overall 
cost (of the bailout)." 
</P>
<P>
The conflict between housing advocates and government officials isn't as 
intense in California as it is in most other states. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the RTC has control of just 351 houses, condominiums and 
apartments in the state -- compared to the whopping 14,328 housing units it has 
inherited from failed thrifts in Texas, or the thousands of other homes that it 
controls in other parts of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
According to provisions inserted by Congress into the S&amp;L bailout law, 
single-family houses or condominium units acquired by the RTC and valued at 
$67,500 or less must be offered first to low-income families, nonprofit groups 
or state and local government housing agencies. Such groups also get first 
chance to buy the RTC's low-priced apartment projects. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 10,000 homes have been identified as eligible for the program so far, 
with more expected as the bailout continues. A test program to sell 100 houses 
began in February and, under interim rules issued a week ago, the RTC 
authorized the sale of 1,000 properties, with low-income families or nonprofit 
groups given a 90-day "right of first refusal." (For apartment projects, 
nonprofit or public agencies get an extra 45 days.) 
</P>
<P>
If a sale is not concluded within that period, wealthier people or investors 
may buy the properties. 
</P>
<P>
"RTC looks at this 'first look' period as a subsidy in itself, a position with 
which we do not agree," said Barbara N. Thompson, director of government 
affairs for the National Council of State Housing Agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Housing advocacy groups argue that the bailout law would permit the RTC to 
discount the sale prices and give mortgage aid to low-income buyers. 
</P>
<P>
But the RTC Oversight Board has voted 2-1 against such steps, with Secretary of 
Housing and Urban Development Jack F. Kemp supporting such aid but Secretary of 
the Treasury Nicholas Brady and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan opposed 
to it. 
</P>
<P>
Discount prices or mortgage subsidies may be the only way that some families 
can get a home, especially in depressed areas such as Texas, Louisiana, 
Colorado and Oklahoma -- where most of the RTC houses are located. 
</P>
<P>
Texas officials estimate that 3 million families earn less than $25,000 a year 
in that state, and most of them would be too poor to buy many of the RTC 
houses, which sell for as much as $67,500, without state or federal subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
The Texas Housing Agency recently agreed to set aside its entire $140-million 
tax-exempt mortgage bond program to help poor families buy RTC houses. Such 
state agencies pay bond buyers a lower-than-usual interest rate because the 
interest is exempt from income taxes, and in turn, the state is able to offer 
cut-rate loans to home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
And under a new accord with the RTC, the federal agency will contribute up to 
$2.8 million to help cut borrowing costs for home buyers using the state 
program, according to Tish Gonzalez, executive administrator of the Texas 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 3,500 families will get low-interest loans and will only have to 
make 3% down payments, Gonzalez said, and some families with incomes as low as 
$16,000 a year will be eligible to participate. "We're hitting a whole new 
class of home buyer," she said, but the money will not stretch far enough to 
help buyers of all of the estimated 4,900 low-income RTC houses in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Texas is unique in that the state agency had not issued bonds in a long time 
because of the state's real estate slump, she said, and thus it could clear the 
decks for an all-out effort to help RTC home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Such housing bond programs are limited, under state bond ceilings as well as 
federal tax rules, in the amount of tax-exempt mortgage bonds they may issue. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Texas, many other states have low-income housing projects standing in 
line to obtain subsidized loans, and the agencies could not exceed their bond 
ceilings to help people buy the newly available RTC houses, said Thompson, of 
the Council of State Housing Agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC is watching the test sales program carefully, said agency spokesman 
Katsanos, and will review what, if any, incentives are needed to make the 
program work. 
</P>
<P>
"Financing from the RTC or possible loan guarantees might be what it's going to 
take to return some of these assets to the private sector," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But advocacy groups must realize, he added, that the RTC "is not in the 
position to give 30-year, below-market-rate loans" because the RTC is supposed 
to be a short-lived operation that cleans up the savings and loan mess and then 
puts itself out of business.

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: INSPECTION CONTINGENCY WILL HELP BUYER WITH UNDISCLOSED 
PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: About two years ago, our best friends bought their first home. They 
knew it needed fix-up work, but they were not fully aware of all the problems 
they would encounter. For example, the seller showed them the "new" roof. It 
turned out only half of the roof had been replaced, and the other side, which 
was difficult to see due to trees and a down slope, was in very bad shape. 
</P>
<P>
It leaked badly within a few months. However, their worst problem was the leaky 
plumbing, which appeared to be copper pipe, but was old galvanized pipe with 
lots of leaky clamps. Our friends sued the seller for not disclosing the 
defects and won, but now they find collecting their modest judgment is 
virtually impossible. As we want to buy a home soon, how can we avoid getting 
into a similar mess? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: That's easy. Just be sure your purchase offer contains a contingency 
clause for a professional property inspection. Such a clause might read, "This 
purchase offer is contingent upon buyer approving a professional property 
inspection report to be obtained at buyer's expense within 10 days after 
acceptance of this offer by seller. Any disapproval of the report to be 
submitted to seller within 15 days from date of acceptance." 
</P>
<P>
I strongly recommend you or your husband accompany the professional inspector. 
The inspector will point out possible problem areas and explain how to prevent 
future damage. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, about two years ago, I hired a professional inspector to check 
out a fixer-upper home. He explained the house looked worse than it really was, 
and it was not beyond hope. As a result, I fixed up that house and made a 
handsome profit on its resale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Check References in Hiring Remodelers 
</P>
<P>
Q: We want to remodel our kitchen. So far, we have interviewed three remodeling 
contractors and didn't like any of them. They have an arrogant "take it or 
leave it" attitude. Their prices seemed very high, so we are still looking for 
a remodeling contractor we like and can afford. Do you have any suggestions on 
how we can hire a reputable remodeler we can afford? 
</P>
<P>
A: Don't be in a hurry to select a remodeling contractor. You are correct that 
remodelers have a very bad reputation, and you can't be too careful when 
selecting one to remodel your kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Your best method of selecting a contractor is personal recommendations from 
friends. If they were pleased with a remodeler, you will probably be satisfied, 
too. Be sure you submit the same plans to each contractor so that you can 
compare their price and terms for exactly the same work. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you don't have friends who can recommend a contractor, start with 
ads in local newspapers and in the Yellow Pages phone book. After you get a 
written estimate from a contractor, insist on receiving at least three 
references from his last three completed jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Phone those people to inquire if they were in any way unhappy with the work and 
if they would use the same contractor again. Ask if you might inspect the job 
to see if the work is up to the quality you expect. You will soon know which 
remodeler should do your work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Where to Obtain a 1-Year Home Warranty 
</P>
<P>
Q: We recently purchased our first home. Then we read in your column about a 
one-year home warranty. Our real estate agent never mentioned such a warranty 
is available. Where can we buy such a warranty policy? 
</P>
<P>
A: It is probably too late. Most real estate agents sell one-year home warranty 
policies. The seller usually pays for the policy, but the buyer or real estate 
agent can also pay. However, I am not aware that these policies can be 
purchased by the buyer after the sale has closed. But check with your real 
estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Be Afraid to Make 'Low Ball' Offers 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am constantly amazed at how you manage to buy bargain properties in a 
high-cost area. But the homes in my town also seem so overpriced I feel it is a 
waste of time to make offers. What is the best way to buy a bargain fixer-upper 
house where my family can reside while I fix it up to increase its market 
value? 
</P>
<P>
A: Don't be afraid to make "low ball" purchase offers. The worst that can 
happen is that the seller might say no. But the seller will probably make a 
counteroffer, and with a little negotiation you can get a very good deal. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure to read the newspaper classified ads every day. The homes advertised on 
the weekdays, incidentally, are often the best bargains. Be sure to leave your 
name and phone number with every realty agent you meet. 
</P>
<P>
Then follow up with phone calls to each agent at least weekly to remind them of 
your continuing interest. You will soon be swamped with so many fix-up bargain 
properties that you can't buy them all. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It Is Always a Good Time to Buy a Home 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband and I want to buy a small home. We both have good jobs, he works 
for the city and I am an executive secretary. But my parents are advising us to 
wait to buy a home. They say the country is heading for a depression. 
</P>
<P>
My dad works for a defense contractor who is expecting major cutbacks in the 
next few years so he is not optimistic. Do you think we should wait to buy a 
home or should we take a chance and buy now? 
</P>
<P>
A: It is always a good time to buy a home. Unless your town is heavily 
dependent on one industry, such as defense work, I would not be concerned about 
doom and gloom predictions. Today is a very desirable time to negotiate with 
home sellers, especially to get good terms on seller financing. 
</P>
<P>
As you may know, in most towns, home sales are a little slow. But there is an 
excellent inventory of homes for sale. The result is you can negotiate hard. 
</P>
<P>
But I suggest you make as small a cash down payment as possible. One reason is 
to maximize your income tax deduction for mortgage interest. Another reason is 
so you maximize your potential leveraged profit in the house. Still another 
reason is a large mortgage minimizes your risk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Do Not Get Involved in Commission Dispute 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our home was listed for sale with agent A. Agent B brought us a purchase 
offer from her buyer and, after negotiation, we accepted. But before the sale 
closed we received a certified letter from agent C who claims he showed the 
property to our buyer and agent B stole the buyer from him. The sale is 
supposed to close the first of next month. What should we do about this 
commission dispute? 
</P>
<P>
A: Nothing. You owe the sales commission to your agent A. It is then up to 
agent A to split part of the commission with agent B or C. Unless the local 
Board of Realtors has a local "first showing rule" it appears agent C is not 
entitled to any part of the commission. But you should not get involved in the 
commission dispute. Let the agents resolve the problem among themselves or 
through their Board of Realtors arbitration committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Buy Retirement Property Too Early 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband plans to retire in about six years. Last winter, we were in 
Florida and visited some excellent retirement communities which seemed very 
affordable. Do you think we should buy our retirement home now and rent it out 
to tenants until we are ready to move? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. It is not a good idea to buy a retirement home in advance of actual use. 
Too many unexpected things can happen to change your retirement plans, such as 
illness, death, disability or other problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pitfalls of Not Having Renter's Insurance 
</P>
<P>
Q: I rent an apartment. Last week, the apartment next door to mine burned, due 
to a kitchen grease fire. It destroyed the apartment, and smoke came into my 
apartment, severely damaging all my furniture and making my apartment 
uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
I temporarily moved in with my girlfriend, but that won't last long. The 
landlord refuses to pay for replacing or cleaning my damaged furniture. She 
says if I don't pay my rent on the first of next month, she will sue me since 
my lease has seven months left. My landlord says if I had renter's insurance, 
my losses would have been paid by the insurance company. Is this true or is the 
landlord saying this to get out of paying for my damage? 
</P>
<P>
A: Your landlord is correct. All tenants should have renter's insurance 
policies because the landlord is not liable for damage to the tenant's property 
unless you can prove negligence by the landlord. If you had a renter's 
insurance policy, your furniture would have been repaired or replaced. Some 
renter's policies also pay temporary living costs when you are unable to live 
in your apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Additional coverages offered by renter's policies include coverages for loss by 
theft and accidents. The major cause of renter's policy claims is theft loss. 
Since the cost of renter's insurance in minimal and the potential benefits are 
great, I strongly recommend you buy renter's insurance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Forfeited Deposit on Home Is Taxable 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our home is listed for sale. A buyer made a purchase offer, which we 
accepted. It included a $5,000 earnest money deposit. But the buyer changed her 
mind about purchasing, so we agreed to let her out of the purchase. However, 
she forfeited her $5,000 deposit to us. Do we have to pay tax on this money? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. A forfeited earnest money deposit is ordinary taxable income. Report it 
on your income tax return under "miscellaneous income." Please consult your tax 
adviser for further details.High Yield on Discount Mortgage Investments 
</P>
<P>
Q: I checked out some newspaper classified want ads offering sale at a 
discount. One woman offered a 2-year-old mortgage on some land with a balance 
of about $6,400, and it would yield me 20%. Another seller has a second 
mortgage of almost $18,000 secured by a nice house at a yield of about 17%. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, I like the loan on the house better because I feel more secure than 
with a land loan. I have studied your report and Jimmy Napier's excellent book 
about discounted mortgages but have come to the conclusion they can be great 
high yield investments but there is no tax shelter. Is this correct? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Investors in discounted mortgages usually earn high yields but this 
income is fully taxable because there are no tax shelter benefits. Readers 
interested in my special report on discounted mortgages can obtain it for $3.75 
from Newspaperbooks, Box 4386, Orlando, Fla. 32802. Jimmy Napier's outstanding 
book "Invest in Debt" is available for $12 from Jim Napier Inc., P.O. Drawer F, 
Chipley, Fla. 32428.Where to Look for VA, FHA Mortgages 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am a Vietnam veteran, but I have not yet used my VA loan entitlement. Last 
week when I was at my bank, I inquired in the loan department about getting a 
VA mortgage, since you had written the VA home loan maximum was recently raised 
to $184,000. But the bank says they don't make VA or FHA loans. I thought all 
banks made these loans. Where can I find out about VA mortgages? 
</P>
<P>
A: In recent years, many banks and S&amp;Ls have quit making VA and FHA home 
loans due to the red tape and limited profit potential. Thankfully, most 
mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers, and some banks and S&amp;Ls make VA and FHA 
mortgages. Just look in your phone book Yellow Pages under "real estate loans" 
and start dialing for dollars until you find a VA-FHA approved lender. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Convey Title Without Any Liability 
</P>
<P>
Q: I own some land, but I am not sure of the location of the boundaries along 
two sides. My buyer understands this problem but still wants to buy. How can I 
avoid liability? 
</P>
<P>
A: Use a quitclaim deed instead of a warranty or grant deed. A quitclaim deed 
conveys only whatever title you might own. In addition, insist that the buyer 
sign an agreement that says you are unsure of the boundaries and make no 
warranties or representations. Please consult your real estate attorney for 
further details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Purchase Pacts Cannot Be Assigned 
</P>
<P>
Q: My wife and I contracted to buy a house from an elderly couple who agreed to 
carry back the first mortgage for us. But they needed 90 days to move out. 
However, after about 30 days, we changed our minds about buying a house because 
my employer may be laying off workers soon, and I don't want to be stuck with 
making house payments if I am out of work. 
</P>
<P>
But my brother agreed to step in and take over our purchase contract. When I 
took him and his wife over to the house to inspect it and to meet the sellers, 
they didn't like my brother and refused to allow him to take over our purchase 
contract. Can they refuse to allow us to get out of the contract? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. The reason your real estate purchase contract is not assignable is it 
is a "personal service" contract, which was based on your income, credit and 
good looks. The sellers agreed to sell to you and to carry the financing for 
you. They do not have to accept substitute buyers. 
</P>
<P>
However, an alternative that might be available is for you to go ahead with the 
purchase. If the mortgage carried back by the sellers does not contain a 
due-on-sale clause, then you can transfer the house to your brother and his 
wife who can then take over the seller-financed mortgage. Please consult a real 
estate attorney for full details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sell Old House Before Buying a New One 
</P>
<P>
Q: We need a larger home for our growing family. My husband and I have been 
looking, off and on, at Sunday open houses. In the last few weeks, we have come 
to realize there are some incredible bargains available. However, we have not 
yet put our current home on the market for sale. Is there any way we can buy 
another home before we sell our old home? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. You can make a purchase offer which is contingent on the sale of your 
old home. However, the seller and the real estate agent will hate you for doing 
that. Although many sellers will reject such contingent offers, in today's 
buyer's market in most cities many anxious sellers will accept such an offer. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, I suggest you put your current home on the market for sale. But be 
realistic. In most cities we are in a buyer's market with more homes for sale 
than there are qualified buyers. So price your home at its true market value if 
you want to get it sold so you can buy a larger home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drawback of Selling to VA Home Buyer 
</P>
<P>
Q: You should warn home sellers of the extra costs of selling to a VA home 
buyer. I innocently agreed to sell my home to a GI buyer. Little did I realize 
I would have to pay about 3% of the loan amount since the law prohibits a VA 
buyer from paying his own loan fee. 
</P>
<P>
The real estate agent didn't explain this to me. The only advantage was I got 
an all-cash sale, but it cost me an extra 3% on top of the realty agent's sales 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
A: Thank you for sharing a significant drawback of VA mortgages. Of course, you 
had the alternative of rejecting that purchase offer from a buyer who wanted to 
use his VA home loan eligibility. With the new higher VA loan limit of 
$184,000, I can't blame him. Perhaps someday VA mortgages will allow the 
borrower to pay their own loan fees, as FHA allows its borrowers to do. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seller Should Leave During Home Showing 
</P>
<P>
Q: My house has been listed for sale for about two months. The real estate 
agent is top notch. He is so cute and courteous it is embarrassing. Although he 
is only 23, he has an excellent success record, so I have every confidence he 
will sell my home. 
</P>
<P>
However, he has an annoying habit of phoning me to let me know when he or a 
colleague will want to show my house. I appreciate that so I can look decent 
and put the dog in the garage so she won't disturb the buyers. But the last 
time, he asked if it is all right if I go shopping while he shows the house. Do 
you think it is safe to let him show the house without me? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. It is not only safe but very highly advisable the owner not be at home 
when a realty agent shows your house. When the owner is not present, 
prospective buyers can be critical and honest about the house. Until a prospect 
starts criticizing a house, they are not serious about buying. My best advice 
is to get out of your home the next time your realty agent calls. And take the 
dog with you. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Remedies When You Buy Lemon House 
</P>
<P>
Q: Last September we bought our first home. It turned out to be a disaster. The 
first problem we discovered was it isn't connected to the city sewer. The widow 
who sold it to us forgot to mention the septic tank. 
</P>
<P>
But it just isn't adequate for our family of five. We had to pay $6,500 to 
connect to the sewer. When winter came, we discovered the insulation is very 
poor, and our heating bills were outrageous. Then the spring rains arrived, and 
we learned the drainage is toward rather than away from the house. This caused 
us to find out the foundation is bad and needs to be rebuilt. Other problems we 
have had include inadequate wiring and galvanized plumbing instead of copper 
pipes. Is there any way we can get our money back? 
</P>
<P>
A: Shame on your seller for not disclosing all the home's known defects to you 
in writing. But your difficulty is proving the seller knew of the problems you 
outlined. 
</P>
<P>
When a property seller misrepresents their property, the buyer has two possible 
legal remedies for buying a lemon house. One is to rescind the sale and get 
your down payment money back. 
</P>
<P>
Rescission should be requested within a reasonable time. The second legal 
remedy is a lawsuit for damages against the seller and the real estate agent. 
Please consult a real estate attorney for further details.

<P>
REACHING TIN RIVER BY THEA ASTLEY (G.P. PUTNAM'S SONS: $18.95; 224 PP.;

By Judith Freeman, Freeman is the author of a novel, The Chinchilla Farm, and a 
collection of short stories, Family Attractions. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is no landscape like the landscape of childhood, terrain at once vivid 
and terrifyingly vague. Thea Astley understands this well, how the sounds of 
teacups being refilled, a grandfather's mumbled comments, or the smell of a 
handful of gum leaves remain fixed in the brain years later as if they were the 
most important moments in one's life, the strongest memory of love. 
</P>
<P>
At first, "Reaching Tin River" seems as if it's going to be a novel about this 
-- a childhood in the magical kingdom of Queensland, North Australia. Not that 
life is idyllic there on the burnt, raw land. "I want love," her small heroine, 
Belle, sobs, and we think it's because she's been uprooted from her beloved 
home and sent to a boarding school; also because she's a fatherless child, 
reared by aging grandparents, a daffy drum-banging mother and a piano-playing 
aunt who form an all-women's band, a duo "welded into a partnership stronger 
than marriage, a kind of twinhood sanctified and integrated by cornball 
rhythms," much more concerned with thumping out "sugar-candy tunes" than 
attending to a small girl's needs. 
</P>
<P>
The novel ends up being about a much different thing, however, namely the adult 
Belle's obsessive search for a "center," a quest that causes her to go off the 
emotional deep end and adopt a "paper lover," a figure out of history named 
Gaden Lockyer whose face she first discovers in the archives of a library where 
she works. Yet the childhood that failed little Belle out on Perjury Plains 
(the telling name of the family property) in the final analysis seems immutably 
connected to her fractured, distressed adulthood. For one thing, she never 
stops looking for love. 
</P>
<P>
Thea Astley -- three-time winner of the Miles Franklin Award, Australia's 
highest literary honor, and author of 10 previous novels and a collection of 
short stories -- is a most original writer whose sentences seem charged with 
incendiary power and whose insight into social mores -- especially the 
relations between men and women -- have a dead-on rightness. Reading her last 
book to appear here, "Two by Astley," a volume containing two novellas 
originally published in Australia in the 1970s, one couldn't help being deeply 
impressed by the energy and intelligence of her writing. The first novella: "A 
Kindness Cup," the story of an aboriginal massacre and its effect years later 
on the inhabitants of a small town, seemed the better work, though it was in 
"The Acolyte" that Astley's social wit and her pyrotechnic flare for language 
was most evident. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, neither talent -- not the story-telling ability nor the 
beautifully charged language -- is employed with the same success in "Reaching 
Tin River." The novel feels hurried, as if written in a rush. Its tone is 
rather conversational. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Astley is capable of writing badly. The wit, the unerring social 
observations, still come through, and the novel has wonderful vignettes -- a 
girl in a bathing suit tantalizing an older man; a mother weaving "red setter" 
place mats out of her dog's hair. But the well-crafted plot of "A Kindness 
Cup," the controlled character revelations found in "The Acolyte" -- these have 
been scrapped for a breezier, faster sort of book about the obsessional Belle, 
a character who at the book's end has gone to extremes that don't make sense. 
</P>
<P>
Belle's American serviceman father, Huck, knew her mother, Bonnie, only long 
enough to conceive a child and take her off to San Diego for a few months 
before Bonnie packed up and headed back to Queensland, though why the marriage 
didn't work is never clear. The legacy of the brief union is Belle. When Belle 
marries a fellow librarian named Seb, she gains little more man than she lost 
in her father. Seb's a self-inflated bore, and worse, he cheats on her. By the 
time Belle realizes her marriage is done for, she has already latched onto her 
next lover, Mr. Gaden Lockyer. 
</P>
<P>
Gaden Lockyer -- no flesh-and-blood man -- is a figure out of history, a 
banker, farmer and politician who lived in Queensland at the end of the last 
century. Not handsome, but compelling in looks, he so intrigues Belle that she 
must know everything about him. Her obsession with Gaden grows, until she is 
fully engaged in "reconstructing or revivifying him." 
</P>
<P>
She has a huge photographic blowup made of his picture so that she can talk to 
him at night alone in her room and insert herself into the "picture" by 
obliterating the image of his wife. Belle sets off to track down places where 
he's lived, assuming a variety of identities until, Belle in tardy pursuit, he 
finally reached Tin River, Gaden's last abode. 
</P>
<P>
What she's really searching for is a "center." That much she makes clear. But 
what kind of a center? One within, or one without? She hopes such a center 
won't revolve around men, and maybe by creating a "paper" man Astley feels 
she's liberating her heroine, at least giving her a stepping stone. 
</P>
<P>
"Philosophically, I suppose," Belle muses, "there is little difference between 
the human center that I seek and the abstract. Modern self-indulgent psychology 
proposes that one's self is one's center, but I find the theory unsatisfying. I 
need a center in which I can merge. An alter-ego center. Isn't that what we all 
look for?" 
</P>
<P>
It's an interesting idea -- using the novel to ask this question: Where is the 
center? But the answers, the whole investigation, is too diffused here; some 
underlying fascination with Euclidean geometry is favored over an obligation to 
real emotional depth in characters. 
</P>
<P>
When Belle finally tracks down her long-lost father, making a hasty trip to the 
States to meet him in New York, their reunion is described in such a way that 
the players seem artificial. And later when Belle tells her mother she's 
located her father, there's hardly an indication of a reaction on her mother's 
part. 
</P>
<P>
Surely such a reunion would matter to both women -- matter deeply -- and a 
reader can't help but long for the emotional truth at such moments.

AMERICA CAN STILL COMPETE; 
</P>
<P>
THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF NATIONS BY MICHAEL E. PORTER (THE FREE 
PRESS/MACMILLAN: $35; 855 PP.; 0-02-925361-6) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steven Schlossstein, Schlossstein, a former vice president with Morgan 
Guaranty, is president of SBS Associates, Inc., a strategic consulting firm 
based in Princeton. He is the author of The End of the American Century 
(Contemporary/Congdon &amp; Weed, 1990). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the 1960s, American firms dominated both domestic and international markets, 
so their corporate strategies tended to focus more on personnel and less on 
product. That was the age of T-groups (T for training) and group dynamics, 
popularized by Warren Bennis and Ed Schein of MIT (later UCLA). 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the 1970s, as competitive pressure mounted from Germany and especially 
Japan, American corporations turned to a growth-share matrix, introduced by the 
Boston Consulting Group. 
</P>
<P>
The buzzwords were cash cows (for low-growth, high-market-share products), 
which fed shooting stars (high-growth, high-share), which maybe became dogs 
(low-share in a slow market) that had to be liquidated to fund the question 
marks. The acquisition craze in this era was driven partly by a desire to buy 
cash cows or shooting stars and divest the dogs. 
</P>
<P>
But in the 1980s, the matrix as an analytical tool gradually gave way to a more 
comprehensive concept called "competitive strategy," which spawned a new book 
of the very same name by Michael E. Porter of the Harvard Business School. 
</P>
<P>
Subtitled "Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors" (Free 
Press/Macmillan, 1980), it established Porter as a leading practitioner of the 
art. The core of his analysis was the competitive behavior of corporations 
within their industries, and it isolated three generic strategies: low-cost 
leadership (such as IBM in computing); differentiation (e.g., Mercedes in the 
auto sector) and focus (Kodak in film). It was followed by his "Competitive 
Advantage" in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the 1990s have now begun, so it's time for another shift in the marketing 
of buzzwords. Porter is back again with another hefty tome that brings us 
concepts such as "clusters" (related and supporting industries) and the 
"diamond" of national advantage that should take us through the decade. 
</P>
<P>
His "diamond" is a complex, four-cornered diagram of what he calls 
"determinants of national competitive advantage." They include (1) corporate 
strategy, structure and rivalry; (2) factor conditions (capital, 
infrastructure, human and natural resources); (3) "clusters," and (4) demand 
conditions (the dynamics of competition in a country's domestic economy). 
</P>
<P>
"National prosperity is created, not inherited," Porter argues. "A nation's 
competitiveness depends on the capacity of its industry to innovate and to 
upgrade. Companies gain advantage . . . because of pressure and challenge. They 
benefit from having strong domestic rivals, aggressive home-based suppliers, 
and demanding local customers." 
</P>
<P>
In his new book, Porter thus deviates from the conventional wisdom of 
comparative advantage -- advanced by the traditional neoclassical economists 
such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo, who argued that it was hereditary -- and 
invites us to think instead about competitive advantage, which is created. 
</P>
<P>
Comparative advantage suggests that nations with rich factor endowments such as 
land and natural resources will be producers of agricultural commodities and 
minerals. The United States and Australia have fit this traditional paradigm 
well. 
</P>
<P>
But the neoclassical model breaks down when it comes to countries like Japan, 
which should theoretically specialize in labor-intensive goods since labor is a 
strong factor endowment. Yet as is now common knowledge, Japan rejects the 
neoclassical theory of comparative advantage and has become the leading example 
of how a nation can create its own competitive advantage: an uncompromising 
commitment to public education, a powerful trade bureaucracy and targeted 
incentives for new investment. 
</P>
<P>
The intellectual cornerstone for the theory of competitive advantage was laid 
nearly two decades ago, however, by Kazushi Ohkawa and Henry Rosovsky of 
Harvard in their seminal work "Japanese Economic Growth: Trend Acceleration in 
the 20th Century" (Stanford University Press, 1973). This original work 
(strangely unmentioned at all by Porter) cited the inherent dynamics of Japan's 
high-speed domestic economy -- not export-led growth -- as the key factor in 
its famous postwar miracle. 
</P>
<P>
Porter spent four years analyzing more than 100 companies in 10 countries to 
refine his new paradigm of competitive advantage. In his lengthy analysis, he 
applies this paradigm both to nations in various stages of development (the 
United States, Japan and Germany are included as advanced economies, with Korea 
and Singapore as industrializing models, in addition to five other European 
countries), as well as to specific industry sectors such as Italian ceramic 
tiles and Japanese robotics. 
</P>
<P>
These specific analytical studies comprise the book's real strength and most of 
its bulk. Less convincing are Porter's general implications for corporate 
strategy or government policy, which take up the final section in an attempt to 
identify national agendas for each of the countries in question. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly disappointing is his pessimistic assessment of America's own 
future, a position popular with liberals these days, especially in Cambridge 
and New Haven and Washington. "That America will remain a great power is not in 
doubt," he concludes, "the issue is whether the American economy has the 
dynamism to maintain or raise (its) standard of living, or whether the nation 
will steadily lose ground in relative terms." 
</P>
<P>
While Porter rightly isolates the many critical problems that America faces 
(flagging performance in public education, a short-term focus, lower spending 
on R&amp;D, an anemic savings rate, etc.), he falls into a common trap by not 
suggesting how we can solve them. Here, even a cursory analysis of tax-based 
incentives to strengthen R&amp;D and capital formation would have been helpful, 
or a discourse on the advantages of market-based competition and choice to help 
reform and restructure education -- unless Porter erroneously believes, as 
conventional thinkers in Cambridge and Washington do, that a national economic 
strategy or its first cousin, an industrial policy (both predicated on an 
outdated Japanese model), are viable solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the book's length (855 pages) and its price will be daunting for 
the general reader, who may find excerpts more appealing. While this is 
regrettable, given the book's considerable detail, both the Harvard Business 
Review (in its March-April, 1990, issue) and Fortune (March 12, 1990) offer 
abridged versions that most readers will undoubtedly prefer. But business 
schools and reference libraries will want to stock it. 
</P>
<P>
The critical question is whether one is optimistic about America's future, as I 
am (despite its present problems), or pessimistic about it, as Porter seems to 
be. Beware the permanent trend: America's great strengths as it moves toward 
the next century are an incredibly diverse and resilient society that is 
capable of unmatched entrepreneurial energy, vitality and skill; a market 
second to none in responsiveness, flexibility and size; an unparalleled 
inventiveness that will continue to drive the information revolution, and a 
dynamic heterogeneity that is being revitalized and rejuvenated by our new 
immigrants, more than half of whom now are coming from East Asia. 
</P>
<P>
These underlying strengths ought to put new and clever buzzwords into a broader 
perspective, because the T-groups and the growth-share matrix and the diamonds 
and the clusters never seem to live much beyond the fads that their short-term 
popularity creates. 
</P>
<P>
The solid building blocks of America's competitive strength, on the other hand, 
clearly will.

FICTION IN BRIEF: BOLSHEVIK SALUTE BY WANG MENG TRANSLATED FROM THE CHINESE BY 
WENDY LARSON (UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON PRESS: $19.95; 154 PP.)

<TEXT>
<P>
Wang Meng's career closely parallels that of Zhong Yicheng, the hero of this 
"modernist" novel first published in 1979: He joined the Communist Party as a 
teen-ager, was exiled to the countryside after something he had innocently 
written was branded as "rightist" in a 1957 purge, endured bitter years of 
manual labor and was finally rehabilitated after the Cultural Revolution. Wang, 
in addition, became China's minister of culture, only to be demoted again after 
last year's massacre in Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Zhong is tormented by the question: What does it mean if the party is good but 
treats him badly? He decides that he must be bad. When his wife's love and the 
passage of time moderate his self-criticism, Zhong concludes that the good 
party made pardonable mistakes or, at worst, that his fate is a mystery. What 
to a Westerner would be the obvious answer -- that the party is tyrannical -- 
is simply unavailable to him, because his whole identity is bound up in the 
revolutionary idealism of his youth. 
</P>
<P>
In a valuable afterword, translator Wendy Larson shows how Wang, less naive 
than Zhong, hints at the unthinkable through the very structure of the novel, 
which exactly balances "positive" and "negative" episodes and bounces Zhong 
like a Ping-Pong ball between the paddles of logic and emotion. Wang implies 
that the intellectual, capable of logic, is always the potential enemy of 
revolutionary fervor; he has no place in communist society and must be kept too 
frightened, guilty or exhausted to perform his natural function: to think.

FICTION IN BRIEF: THE SNAKE TREE BY UWE TIMM TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN BY 
PETER TEGEL (NEW DIRECTIONS: $19.95, CLOTH; $10.95, PAPER; 281 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A West German engineer named Wagner arrives in a South American country that 
resembles Argentina or Brazil under military rule. His job is to oversee the 
construction of a paper mill in the rain forest. On his first visit to the site 
-- where the project is sinking literally into the mud, and metaphorically into 
a swamp of incompetence and corruption -- he runs over a green snake in the 
road. The snake is sacred; the Indian workers consider him marked for death. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner, a rationalist, pooh-poohs the idea of a curse. It's to Uwe Timm's 
credit that the engineer doesn't get his comeuppance in any of the obvious 
ways. The story of Europeans degenerating in the tropics is, after all, an old 
one; Joseph Conrad told it first and best in "Heart of Darkness," which Wagner 
happens to have read. Unlike Conrad's renegade idealist, Kurtz, Wagner doesn't 
go murderously insane; unlike the stereotypical modern technocrat, he is 
neither narrow-minded nor insensitive. His impulses toward love and spiritual 
rebirth get him into as much trouble as his demands for efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
A colleague warns him, as someone should have warned Kurtz: "One can't force an 
alien logic on things, and on people even less." Wagner's good intentions can't 
cancel the fact that the colonialism Conrad described in the Third World of his 
day has been replaced by an alliance between foreign economic interests and the 
native elite, with results almost as bad: "The (common) people pay for 
everything. We give them the loans, build them the (mill), deliver the 
machinery, cut down the forest. . . . What we leave behind is a useless paper 
factory, a red desert and debts." 
</P>
<P>
"The Snake Tree," Timm's fifth novel, is romantic in two senses of the word. It 
trades heavily in suspense and exotic detail: huge cockroaches popping through 
a bathroom drain, a six-lane freeway bridge spanning a jungle gorge but 
connected only to donkey trails. And it uses South American "magical realism" 
in the service of a European idea that flourished a generation or two before 
Conrad: the power of the wilderness to heal as well as destroy, the religious 
and political necessity of shedding "civilization" like a snake's skin. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Tegel's translation is littered with awkward syntax, comma faults and 
misspellings. It won a prize and may represent an attempt by Timm to show the 
decay of "alien logic" through the decay of language, but American readers will 
find it annoying.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE LAST TO GO BY RAND RICHARD COOPER (AVON: $7.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rand Cooper uses a series of overlapping vignettes to present a sort of Cubist 
portrait of a disintegrating upper-middle class marriage. Dan and Mary Ellen 
Slattery seemed like an ideal couple: Their divorce shocked everyone who knew 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper scrapes off their sleek veneer and examines the gradual erosion of love 
that transformed devoted partners into strangers and, ultimately, enemies. The 
story is divided among several narrators, but these characters sound too much 
alike for the switches to be very effective. Toby, the Slattery's son, who 
watches his parents separate (and never forgives his father for leaving), is 
the most credible observer; the version of the separation recounted by a 
heretofore unmentioned neighbor near the end of the book reads like an early 
draft of a different story.

BLOODY SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Martin's four previous non-mystery novels disclosed a far-ranging 
imagination, an intense and poetic prose style and a deep curiosity about the 
dark reaches of the human soul. His best-known, "The Crying Heart Tattoo," 
about the beginning relationship between a young boy and an older woman and how 
it evolved over the decades, was an eccentric but affecting love story. 
</P>
<P>
In Lie to Me (Random House: $18.95; 261 pp.), Martin turns to crime: a worn-out 
cop's pursuit of a demented killer who is one of the true and horrifying 
grotesques of recent fiction. The detective, Teddy Camel, has a reputation as a 
human lie detector. He says he believes the widow when she says that the 
torture murder of her rich husband was suicide, with a side order of 
self-mutilation. 
</P>
<P>
Shifting the novel's points of view between Camel and the woozy perceptions of 
the killer, Martin tells a tale that is Gothic in its grisliness but 
disturbingly persuasive in its setting out of why the killer is as he is, and 
why the ghastly confrontation in the upscale Virginia suburbs of Washington had 
an inevitability about it. 
</P>
<P>
As before, Martin is a master writer whose present-tense evocations of the 
killer's states of mind are frightening, yet at the same time make him as 
pathetic as his victims. The book could well bring Martin the wider audience he 
well deserves. 
</P>
<P>
The pseudonymous John Sandford, said to be a prize-winning Minneapolis 
journalist, made a fine debut in 1989 with "Rules of Prey," which introduced 
Detective Lucas Davenport, who invents computer games in his spare time and can 
afford a Porsche as his car of choice. 
</P>
<P>
In Shadow Prey (G. P. Putnam's Sons: $18.95; 318 pp.), another punning title, 
Davenport confronts a small, shadowy band of Indians who, aiming to take 
revenge on a corrupt government official, stage a daring series of ritual 
assassinations to draw their ultimate target into the open. 
</P>
<P>
Working in the crime genre called police procedurals, which embraces Gideon of 
Scotland Yard, Maigret and all of Ed McBain's 87th Precinct (to sketch the 
diversity within the genre), Sandford creates a cracklingly authentic 
atmosphere, a you-are-there sense of place, a sharp and sympathetic feeling for 
the urban Indian contesting an alien world, and the sound detailings of the 
police at work -- interagency rivalries and dislikes included. 
</P>
<P>
It is a vigorous entertainment, and while Davenport is colorful in his 
particulars, including the nun who talks philosophy and games with him, it is 
the larger story that commands the attention. 
</P>
<P>
Everette Howard Hunt Jr. was a prolific novelist as well as a 20-year CIA 
worker before he became an aide in the Nixon White House, caught up in the 
Watergate scandal. He is now back to writing thrillers, and very successfully, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Murder in State (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's: $17.95; 288 pp.) is an espionage 
caper with the special strength that derives from an author's close familiarity 
with the turf. 
</P>
<P>
The theme, that the State Department is a hill of moles and the Soviets a 
subversive threat implacable as ever, has a very pre-glasnost ring about it. 
And while a character's views are not necessarily those of the author, it seems 
clear enough that Adam Stuart, ex-State now content to fiddle with wills and 
trusts in Georgetown, is a carrier for some of Hunt's attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart grumbles that senators opposing the confirmation of a conservative 
general are "strutting midgets." He had left State, he tells a senator's aide, 
because "any little Fourth World country" could abuse the United States with 
impunity. 
</P>
<P>
An old State Department pal comes to Stuart worried about leaks to the Soviets 
on the eve of arms-reductions talks in Geneva. He leaves Stuart a document 
about his fears and is shortly murdered. Stuart is recruited to the U.S. team 
at the talks and is soon the innocent abroad, kidnaped, drugged, on the run 
with a new identity, trying to discover who's on whose side. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt invents a cleverly tangled yarn, with a double-twist ending, heavy with 
irony, reaffirming the author/protagonist's view that nothing changes and Red 
is a fade-proof color. Crime fiction is generally apolitical; thrillers are the 
most frequent exceptions and this is one. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran journalist-commentator Rod MacLeish has a new thriller out that 
takes a more detached view of the post-glasnost world of espionage. In Crossing 
at Ivalo (Little, Brown: $18.95; 287 pp.), a dissident Russian officer, 
purporting to help a Jewish scientist flee Moscow for Israel, kidnaps him and 
offers him for ransom to both the United States and the U.S.S.R. 
</P>
<P>
Jake Yarrow, an old and loyal CIA hand, heads up the American team to find the 
scientist, a Star Wars expert, before the Soviets do. There are double dealings 
in quantity, an expert assassin on the loose, a weak U.S. President whipsawed 
by a right-wing zealot, all leading to an unexpectedly quiet but no less 
suspenseful ending, near the Russian border at the Finnish town of Ivalo. 
</P>
<P>
Within the novel, as sometimes happens in crime and thriller fiction, there is 
another kind of story implanted. The relationship between Yarrow and his 
estranged wife, and notably their conversations on the ghostly, tethering 
influence of long-dead parents, is embedded like a gemstone set in enamel. The 
shadow of Yarrow's father is not irrelevant to the goings-on, but you have the 
feeling that the theme is one that MacLeish wanted to explore, someplace, as 
Hunt seems to have wanted to say he had not changed the rules of his patriot 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Bino (as in albino) Phillips is a Dallas-sized defense attorney (6-feet-6) with 
very pale hair. In A. W. Gray's In Defense of Judges (E. P. Dutton: $18.95; 328 
pp.), Bino is asked, to his surprise, to be counsel for a tough but liberal 
judge who is threatened with indictment on trumped-up charges of bribe-taking. 
</P>
<P>
The complications centrally include the judge's beloved but drug-abusing 
daughter and an ambitious U.S. attorney who likes neither Bino nor the judge. 
Murder is both attempted and done, and Gray, said to have been both a 
professional golfer and gambler, keeps the pot boiling merrily. There is a 
secretary who is loyal, loving, sharp-tongued and crucially useful. Definitely 
post-Perry Mason, all of it. 
</P>
<P>
Another and quite different lawyer, Brady Coyne of Boston, makes his ninth 
appearance in William G. Tapply's Client Privilege (Delacorte: $16.95; 260 
pp.). Coyne, who would rather be fishing -- Tapply is a contributing editor of 
Field and Stream -- is, like Bino, also asked to represent a judge, an 
impeccably honest sort who is being considered for the federal bench and who is 
at the same moment being blackmailed. 
</P>
<P>
The judge is not into full disclosure, which makes Coyne's work harder and the 
author's work easier. Coyne meets the blackmailer, who shortly turns up dead, 
and who, bafflingly, was an expose-oriented anchor man on a struggling 
independent TV station. 
</P>
<P>
Like many another fictional sleuth, Coyne has an attractive estranged wife whom 
he can't live without, or with. She is pleasant when she's around. Also in the 
great tradition, Coyne has to track through the past -- a loyal secretary, a 
hidden pregnancy, family hatreds -- to reach present truth, which is a smartly 
plotted surprise. Like many series, Tapply's Coyne stories are swift, efficient 
and likable. 
</P>
<P>
The imaginative young publishing firm of Carroll &amp; Graf has exhumed seven 
longish short stories by G. K. Chesterton, most famous in the mystery field for 
his Father Brown stories. Seven Suspects (Carroll &amp; Graf: $17.95; 204 pp.) 
includes "The Man Who Shot the Fox," never before anthologized. 
</P>
<P>
The moral is that Chesterton rests more comfortably with the Father Brown 
stories than with some of his theological apologetics. While the historian 
Howard Haycraft credits Chesterton with giving the mystery a more literary 
form, the evidence of these stories is that he made it more pompous and 
heavy-going, burying his small, paradoxical tricks in reams of not very lively 
prose. Exhumations are always a risk.

WHY THERE WON'T BE A TOP 43 LIST;

<P>
DESPITE THE URGINGS OF THEIR DEFENDERS, THERE WERE REASONS THESE THREE DIDN'T 
MAKE THE FINAL CUT. AND SURPRISE, THEY ARE STILL VALID

It was while I was operating on their canary, one writer began, that I 
discovered my best clients were also the owners of my favorite restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this letter writer had a hard time understanding that the 
canary's parents were not the owners of my favorite restaurant. She was shocked 
and disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
The veterinarian's letter was just one of a flood that came pouring in after 
the publication of my Top 40 Restaurants (Los Angeles Times Magazine, May 6). 
"Do you actually eat in the restaurants that you review?" one writer wanted to 
know. Another spoke of my "poor little Gucci-clad tootsies" tootling around 
town in a Rolls-Royce that is reluctant to stray far from Westside roads. There 
was a flurry of similarly worded cards about San Pedro's Papadakis Taverna 
saying that it was not one of the best restaurants in the area, but one of the 
best restaurants in the world. We heard from neighbors. We heard from 
celebrities. We heard from the restaurants themselves. 
</P>
<P>
But what we heard most, in the final analysis, was about three particular 
restaurants. In fact, all of the following restaurants had so many defenders 
that despite the fact that I have eaten in each several times, I decided to go 
back and try them again. I was completely prepared to eat my words. 
</P>
<P>
L'Orangerie is, without any doubt, one of the most attractive restaurants in 
L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight it seems especially lovely; we have arrived early and sit for a long 
time watching the light fade from the windows and the room grow golden with the 
light of candles. Dinah Shore is at one table with a group of people who seem 
to be having a taste-off of Jack Daniels and Wild Turkey. There's a gorgeous 
starlet at another. Virtually everybody in the room looks beautiful. It is hard 
not to be happy to be here. 
</P>
<P>
Provided, that is, that you are not paying the bill. For these prices are hard 
to swallow. Take this salad. It is a wonderful salad dressed in a delightful 
vinaigrette sprinkled with big chunks of Roquefort cheese and what the menu 
calls croustillants de pommes de terre (these turn out to be the world's 
fanciest potato chips). It's a swell salad. An extremely swell salad. But I 
have yet to meet the salad that is worth $17 to me. 
</P>
<P>
Price isn't the only problem. Take these eggs with caviar. It is one of the 
most beautiful dishes I know -- two egg shells filled with soft, creamy, 
perfectly scrambled eggs and topped with so much black caviar that you feel you 
are getting your money's worth, even at $26. But whoever spooned this king's 
ransom of caviar onto the eggs has left his mark: distinct black fingerprints 
decorate the shells. It is -- at the very least -- disconcerting. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with the white asparagus soup is different again. It's a pale and 
lovely soup, and the waiter did not lie when he said that it was made without 
cream. Unfortunately, it was also made without flavor. Blindfolded, I could not 
tell you what kind of soup it was. 
</P>
<P>
The entrees are good. But they are not great. I love the conceit of the lotte 
with lobster sauce. This fish is often called "poor man's lobster" because its 
texture is somewhat akin to lobster tail. And the sauce on this fish is a 
wonder; it is amazingly intense, so that the flavor of the lobster comes 
shining through. But the lotte itself has been so thinly sliced that the 
texture is nothing like lobster. It's too bad; the whole point of the dish has 
been lost. The noodles with which it is served don't help; they sit miserably 
on the plate in a stuck-together clump. 
</P>
<P>
This grilled turbot, on the other hand, is a fabulous piece of fish. It comes 
with three delightful little ovals of potato puree and some rather wonderful 
caramelized leeks. Even at $36, I don't feel I'm being overcharged. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the only dish of the day that seems worth the money. The white peach 
tart is a nice tart -- but the peaches have no flavor. The sorbets are not as 
flavorful as they might be. And as I plunk down more than $100 per person for 
this meal, I can't help thinking how glad I am that it is not my money. 
</P>
<P>
 L'Orangerie, 903 N. La Cienega Blvd., West Hollywood. (213) 652-9770. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't want this table," says the maitre d' with a gesture, "you can sit 
in the gazebo. It's even nicer." He points off into the interior of La Serre. I 
am instantly suspicious. Why are they being so good to us? Have I been spotted? 
</P>
<P>
I certainly hope not. Because if the restaurant is out to impress, it ought to 
come up with something better than this mealy bit of bread. We are not off to a 
good start. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, things don't get better. The service is sweet, helpful and 
professional. The room is lovely. But the food is just not up to snuff. 
Consider this warm foie gras. A few skimpy slices are served in a blueberry 
sauce so full of vinegar that the strong smell of hot acid comes wafting 
unattractively across the table. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, I can't say that anything we're eating is much of a hit. Soupe au 
pistou is just an unimpressive puree of vegetables. The croutons in the salad 
are sad. And when the very sweet waiter removes the dishes from the first 
courses, it is only to replace them with plates of complimentary sorbets. 
Served on rose petals, these are lovely to look at. Too bad they taste so much 
like iced perfume. 
</P>
<P>
The main courses are not an improvement. Duck with mangoes is overcooked. 
Grilled rouget comes in a clumsy wine sauce. There is too much garlic in the 
potatoes, and the asparagus has been cooked until it starts to turn brown. 
</P>
<P>
Without any doubt, the best thing we eat all night is a hot apple tart served 
with whipped cream melting across the top. La Serre may be a nice place. It may 
have a lot of fans. But the prices are high, and I certainly wouldn't call it 
one of the 40 best restaurants in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 La Serre, 12969 Ventura Blvd., Studio City. (818) 990-0500. 
</P>
<P>
"We come here every year on Valentine's Day," announce my friends as we meet at 
Le Chardonnay. Walking in the door, their faces shine; they link hands, they 
each take a deep breath. 
</P>
<P>
It is a breathtaking restaurant -- a room so charming that your heart lifts as 
you sink into your seat. A faithful replica of a turn-of-the-century Parisian 
bistro, Le Chardonnay manages a sort of restaurant magic that makes you feel as 
if you have walked right out of time. 
</P>
<P>
This is such a magical room that you don't notice when the noise goes up and 
you start shouting. It is, in reality, one of those loud Los Angeles 
restaurants everybody is always complaining about, but it is visually so quiet, 
the service so pleasantly solicitous, that you hardly bother to notice. 
</P>
<P>
People go out to eat for lots of reasons. They may love the way a restaurant 
looks, or the way it makes them feel. It may be the restaurant where they fell 
in love, or it may be the one where they always get a good table. Food is often 
completely incidental to the restaurant experience. But not to me. 
</P>
<P>
I always want the food to be wonderful. The more beautiful the room I'm eating 
in, the higher my expectations. This can be hard on my friends. While they are 
eating up the atmosphere, I am complaining about the food. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, for instance, I can't help noticing that the Louisiana crab cakes 
one friend is eating, have all the appeal of soggy bread crumbs. The texture of 
the cakes is mushy, and the mustard sauce in which they sit so overwhelming 
that any crab flavor that might have been present is totally masked. He seems 
blissfully unaware of all this. "Aren't these wonderful?" he asks happily. 
</P>
<P>
His wife is eating cold tomato soup filled with lots of basil and little balls 
of melon. She thinks it's wonderful; I think it has a sort of silly "be 
creative with your food" sort of quality. I try not to say so. 
</P>
<P>
But my grumpiness must be catching. Although I try to be nice about the three 
tiny soft-shell crabs on my plate, they have been crisped beyond redemption. 
All at once my friends start looking at their own plates in dismay. "This 
Chinese duck," says Ken very distinctly, "is dry." 
</P>
<P>
"So is this grilled breast of chicken," says Patty. I point out that the 
vegetables -- especially a buttery little bundle of whole leaf spinach -- are 
very nice. My friends are no longer so easy to impress. By dessert time, Patty 
is looking at her profiterolles with suspicion and Ken is expressing outrage 
over the price of a dish of unripe berries. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we'll go someplace else next year for Valentine's Day," he says as we 
exit.

NOTEBOOK: PORTS' MICHAELA LIVINGSTON JUMPS SHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's end-of-an-era time at Ports in Hollywood: Michaela Livingston, co-founder 
and co-owner of the clubby, idiosyncratic Santa Monica Boulevard institution, 
has severed her connection with the place. She plans to retire from the 
restaurant business, at least temporarily, she says, and move to Northern 
California. "It's time," she adds cryptically but with obvious finality. Her 
longtime associate at the restaurant, Philip Compton, will stay on as sole 
proprietor. 
</P>
<P>
Livingston and her late husband Jock opened Ports in 1972. A larger-than-life 
actor-turned-restaurateur (he played Alexander Woollcott in "Star," and looked 
a bit like Cezanne as Pissarro painted him), Jock had previously launched the 
Studio Grill just down the street, in partnership with artist Ardison Phillips. 
(The Livingstons subsequently sold their interest in that restaurant to 
Phillips, who continues to run it to this day.) 
</P>
<P>
Ports was looser, more eccentric, than the earlier restaurant, with an 
immensely varied and often luminous clientele (one evening, for instance, I saw 
Michelangelo Antonioni, Claes Oldenburg, Rip Torn and designer Milton Glaser in 
different corners of the dining room) and a menu that was all over the culinary 
map, from Alsace (choucroute garni) to Mexico (mole poblano) to the Balkans (a 
Greek-inspired concoction called watercress and cheese pie, which Michaela made 
and which became -- along with a sort of super-cheesecake called brandy cream 
pie -- a favorite of the place). 
</P>
<P>
Philip Compton joined the restaurant as a manager after Jock's death in 1980 
and, apart from a brief sabbatical, has helped Michaela run it ever since. 
Under their joint tutelage the place has changed dramatically in decor and 
clientele, but not all that much in menu philosophy. And it is still the sort 
of place where you might see, if not necessarily Antonioni, Oldenburg, Torn and 
Glaser, their '90s counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
Compton promises that Livingston's departure will not bring radical alterations 
in Ports. "The menu's still going to be that same old melting pot," he says. 
"Something will probably change somewhere along the line, but I don't know what 
or when." 
</P>
<P>
GOLLY GIO: Another Hollywood institution, albeit somewhat younger and more 
traditional than Ports, has undergone a different sort of transformation 
recently: Gio's, which has served up dependable Italian/Continental food (with 
Brazilian accents) and cabaret entertainment for a dozen years on the site of 
the old L'Auberge on Sunset Boulevard, has closed -- or, rather, has been 
replaced by a disco/supper club called blak:bloo (sic). Frank Stallone, brother 
of you-know-who, is among the owners of the new establishment. Gio's fans 
needn't despair completely, though: Gio Casara himself remains on the premises, 
running the dining room and kitchen, and offering many of the same dishes for 
which Gio's was known. 
</P>
<P>
MAPLE LEAVE: Julie Stone, co-owner and (until recently) manager of Maple Drive 
in Beverly Hills, has severed her day-to-day connection with the restaurant 
following a round of belt-tightening at the popular eatery. Stone, who retains 
an interest in Maple Drive, has returned temporarily to 72 Market Street in 
Venice (out of which Maple Drive developed) in a management capacity, but will 
leave that establishment this week on maternity leave. "I'll be back at 72 in 
September," she promises, "but I don't think I'll be going back to Maple 
Drive." Meanwhile, Maple Drive executive chef Leonard Schwartz will manage both 
the dining room and the kitchen at the Beverly Hills restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
COUSIN/CUCINA: The Long-Beach based University Restaurant Group, proprietors of 
555 East and the Pine Avenue Fish House in Long Beach and of Ocean Avenue 
Seafood in Santa Monica, will open a new Santa Monica restaurant this week -- I 
Cugini ("The Cousins"), a caffe/trattoria with gourmet market attached. The 
250-seat, 9,500-square-foot establishment (2,000 of those square feet being 
outdoor patio space) will serve breakfast, lunch and dinner, and promises (what 
else?) "moderate prices." Michael Fink will oversee both I Cugini and Ocean 
Avenue Seafood, and Rebecca Matarazzi, most recently in the kitchen at Prego in 
Beverly Hills, has been named executive chef. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, URG is now working on yet another project -- this one in downtown 
L.A. Tentatively called the Water Grill, this new place will be located between 
5th and 6th streets, next to the Biltmore Hotel. "Basically," says Fink, "we're 
in design right now. But I can tell you that it's going to be a damn fine 
old-fashioned downtown seafood restaurant, complete with oyster bar. It will 
provide downtown with something it just doesn't have. We don't plan to 
duplicate Ocean Avenue Seafood, though. Our general plan is for food that 
probably might be a little more sophisticated. We're going to do some different 
things." The Water Grill is slated for a January or February opening. 
</P>
<P>
SALT AND PEPPER: Chapo on Melrose Avenue, in conjunction with Hollywood's 
Little Red Schoolhouse, is currently exhibiting a selection of food-themed art 
by Schoolhouse students. The works are for sale, and proceeds will be donated 
to the Make-a-Wish Foundation. The show continues through June 23. . . . Raja, 
on Pico Boulevard just south of Beverly Hills, remains open while undergoing an 
interior redesign (by architect Sat Garg, whose other local restaurant 
interiors include Sostanza and Nawab). A new chef, Kishan Lal, has also been 
imported from Bombay, and is creating a new menu for the restaurant. . . . 
Speaking of Sostanza, that West L.A. Italian trattoria is now preparing 
"executive box lunches" to take out, Monday through Friday, priced from $15 to 
$20 per meal. . . . It's crab city at a number of local restaurants currently: 
Gardens at the Four Seasons Hotel in L.A. is featuring numerous soft-shell crab 
dishes on both its lunch and dinner menus, through the end of June; Orleans, 
also in L.A., offers a selection of soft-shell crab preparations of its own, 
for as long as the season lasts, and Ocean Avenue Seafood in Santa Monica will 
positively crawl with soft-shell specialties from June 21 through July 31. . . 
. And one last seasonal note: It's green corn tamale time at El Cholo.

A PERSONAL APPROACH PAYS OFF AS CANDIDATES TAKE TO THE STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In the day of catchy television ads and slick campaign mailers, successful 
candidates in Ventura County have returned to the age-old technique of knocking 
on doors to woo voters. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's election, candidates discovered, and in some cases rediscovered, 
that their personal commitment to present themselves on the voters' doorsteps 
provided the winning margin. 
</P>
<P>
Going door-to-door "was absolutely the critical edge," said Maria VanderKolk, a 
political novice who defeated Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer in an astounding 
upset. 
</P>
<P>
VanderKolk and about 75 volunteers mostly from the environmental group Save 
Open Space knocked on thousands of doors in neighborhoods concerned about the 
impact of large developments proposed nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer, a veteran officeholder, said she underestimated her competition. She 
stayed home and lost by 102 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) faced the toughest challenge of her 
political career on Tuesday. Her opponent, Hunt Braly, hammered her with 
charges that she misused her office by trying to get authorities to fix her 
daughter's driving tickets. 
</P>
<P>
But Wright spent the last six weekends leading teams of volunteers canvassing 
neighborhoods in her district of 210,000 registered voters that stretches from 
Santa Clarita to Lompoc. She handily won reelection in a race she could have 
easily lost. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing quite like it," Wright said. "I think people want to know you 
are a person, not just a name they read in the newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, door-to-door campaigning is nothing new. But political consultants 
see a resurgence of shoe-leather campaigning, particularly in areas such as 
Ventura County that have no television station of their own and no dominant 
radio station, newspaper or other central way to broadcast a candidate's 
message. 
</P>
<P>
"There definitely is a return to knocking on doors," said John Davies, a Santa 
Barbara political consultant who has run several campaigns in Ventura County. 
"More and more candidates are seeing that the most effective way to campaign is 
face to face." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Davies persuaded Oxnard Mayor Nao Takasugi to hit the streets. 
Takasugi lost 15 pounds walking precincts four hours every day for four months. 
"That was the most vigorous workout I've had," Takasugi said. "And it paid off 
well." 
</P>
<P>
In the evolution of political campaigns, many candidates have grown to rely on 
letters and brochures designed and mailed to narrowly targeted groups of 
voters. But direct-mail campaigns have become less effective in recent years, 
consultants say. 
</P>
<P>
One reason is that campaign brochures are getting lost in a sea of other junk 
mail. Another is that voters have become jaded to accusations in hit mail and 
flyers that try to exploit emotional issues. 
</P>
<P>
"When a fresh face knocks on your door and hands you a brochure, that is a 
tremendously positive statement about a campaign," said Kevin Sweeney, public 
affairs director for Patagonia, the outdoor clothing manufacturer in Ventura. 
"If someone with a friendly voice says, 'Please read this,' you read it." 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney got his start in politics by helping former U.S. Sen. Gary Hart of 
Colorado organize volunteers to walk the precincts of every major city in Iowa 
just before the 1984 Democratic presidential contest. It was the first time a 
presidential campaign attempted such a feat. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, he drew on that experience to assist a slow-growth citizens group 
assemble 80 volunteers to go to the homes of 18,000 voters who were likely to 
vote in Ventura's municipal election. Three of the group's four candidates were 
swept into office in an election that became a referendum on the city's growth 
patterns. 
</P>
<P>
"Walking works," Sweeney said. "If I was running a campaign and had absolute 
assurance I could raise $35,000, or have only $3,000 and 100 volunteers for 
three consecutive Saturdays, I would choose the latter and win by a landslide." 
</P>
<P>
On his own time, Sweeney advised VanderKolk and Save Open Space how to mount a 
door-to-door effort. "I talked a lot with them about canvassing," he said. "It 
looks like it paid off." 
</P>
<P>
Some neighborhoods, particularly those in Simi Valley, saw many candidates and 
volunteers roaming the streets close to the election. 
</P>
<P>
Making the rounds in one precinct last weekend, Wright crossed paths with a 
volunteer working for her opponent. "Hi, Cathie," said Sheila Holt, a Braly 
volunteer, walking down a driveway as Wright was walking up. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure glad I was one step ahead of her," Holt told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
"No," Wright said later. "She should want to come behind me, so I can't turn 
the voter around. People are more impressed when candidates themselves go to 
their door." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Davis and Vicky Howard, the top vote-getters in another county supervisor 
seat, also went door-to-door in Simi Valley, the hub of the 4th Supervisorial 
District. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish there had been more time to go out and walk," said Davis, who faces 
Howard in a runoff election in November. He said he knocked on 600 doors before 
the June 5 primary and plans to personally visit 20,000 houses in the five 
months before the November runoff. 
</P>
<P>
That may be a bit ambitious for one person. But with today's computerized 
voting lists, candidates are able to canvass much larger districts. 
</P>
<P>
For example, candidate Mike McConnell, a construction manager from Ventura, 
spent every spare moment since Feb. 18 walking precincts in the 19th 
Congressional District that straddles Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. He 
figures he knocked on more than 6,600 doors. 
</P>
<P>
For a political unknown with virtually no money and no endorsements, he made an 
impressive showing, winning 35% of the vote in the Democratic primary. He lost 
to Anita Perez Ferguson, a former aide to state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa 
Barbara) who will challenge Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) in the 
November election. 
</P>
<P>
"He learned that 6,500 doors was not enough," Davies said. "But he was on the 
right track." 
</P>
<P>
Political campaigns now use computers to pre-sort voters, eliminating the need 
to knock on every door. Most campaigns only target "high-propensity" voters who 
are likely to vote in the upcoming election and those who can be won over by 
the particular candidate -- saving a great deal of legwork. 
</P>
<P>
Campaigns can purchase computerized lists of voters from the county registrar 
of voters and from a whole industry of voter-contact services. 
</P>
<P>
"They seem to be quite sophisticated," said Ruth Schepler, the county's 
assistant registrar of voters. A few years ago, she said, "they didn't speak 
our language or the computer's language. Now they ask for specific computer 
batch jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Q. Thompson, Wright's campaign manager, is one of those political 
consultants who has learned to skillfully develop voter lists. 
</P>
<P>
He said he purchased a computerized list from the county and then added 
information about each high-propensity voter from interviews with voters over 
the phone. Before the election, he said, the campaign had reached Wright 
supporters and undecided Republican voters at least four times. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing on longtime Wright loyalists, party regulars and a Simi Valley gun 
owners' rights group, he brought together a hard-core group of about 40 
volunteers with occasional help from an additional 150 people to canvass 
precincts in person. "It is an essential ingredient to go door-to-door," he 
said. "Cathie was on her way out." 
</P>
<P>
Davies said going door-to-door doesn't always work. "Sometimes it can hurt you, 
if you have a lousy personality," Davies said. "If you have a caustic 
personality, you can come across better on TV or slick-looking mailers." 
</P>
<P>
Nor does everyone believe in walking precincts. Schaefer said she isn't so sure 
it helped her win the supervisor's job four years ago. She said she often found 
nobody at home when she knocked on doors in 1986. Sometimes, she said, voters 
grew irritated when she disturbed them at dinner time. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to run on my record," Schaefer said. "Maybe that was a mistake."

NEW AGE CHUMASH; 
</P>
<P>
RENAISSANCE: DESCENDANTS OF A LOCAL COASTAL INDIAN TRIBE THAT HAS ALL BUT 
DISAPPEARED ARE REDISCOVERING THEIR CULTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Connie Diaz remembers the day her daughter came home from school, angry after a 
lesson about the Chumash Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"They were teaching her things like, 'When the Chumash were here, they liked to 
fish and eat venison,' " said Diaz, a Ventura County resident who is part 
Chumash. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter said, 'Mom, I just had to let them know that we're still here. 
They always talk about us as if we don't exist anymore.' " 
</P>
<P>
That was a few years ago -- before the start of a "Chumash renaissance" in 
Ventura County -- a time when the Chumash were treated as practically extinct, 
like the California condors that used to soar over their lands. 
</P>
<P>
In some respects, the Chumash have practically vanished. Scarcely 200 years 
ago, when the Spanish missionaries arrived, as many as 20,000 Chumash inhabited 
the coast between Malibu and San Luis Obispo. The Europeans brought new 
diseases for which the Chumash had no immunity. By the mid-1800s, there were 
fewer than 1,000 Chumash, anthropologists say. 
</P>
<P>
Today, they say, there is not one pure-blooded Chumash left. 
</P>
<P>
But there are an estimated 4,000 people of Chumash descent living in the 
region, most of them in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. The vast majority 
have only a little Chumash blood, but three are three-quarters Chumash and 
several are half Chumash. 
</P>
<P>
Through intermarriage, mostly with people of Mexican descent, the Chumash have 
been assimilated into the American melting pot, according to John Johnson, 
curator of anthropology at Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
As they have struggled to discover their origins and assert their presence in 
recent years, they have had to overcome a number of obstacles, some stemming 
from ancient times. 
</P>
<P>
Historians say the Chumash never had the strong tribal organization and 
geographical isolation that helped larger Indian nations such as the Navajo 
maintain their identities. The Chumash were linked primarily by a common 
language, and by 1923 only a dozen people spoke it. The last person to speak 
the Chumash language died in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no continuum from ancient times to the present," said Michael Ward, 
who has worked on Chumash cultural programs for various government agencies. 
"Chumash culture was interrupted by the Mission Period, Latino culture and, 
more recently, by Anglo culture. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't been acceptable until the past 20 years to be Chumash. All over 
you'll find Indian people who would rather say they're Mexican. . . . It's the 
pressure of trying to fit in with the dominant culture." 
</P>
<P>
For many Chumash today, pressures of daily life also get in the way of cultural 
fulfillment, social workers say. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Stenslie, deputy director of the Candelaria American Indian Council in 
Oxnard, said unemployment, homelessness and broken families tend to occur more 
frequently among the Chumash and other American Indians than in the population 
at large. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the obstacles, many Chumash have taken to learning more about their 
heritage and culture, and some are sharing it with the public through folklore, 
songs, dances and art. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Ernestine McGovran, a Santa Paula nurse whose mother was the last 
Chumash to speak the language, tells Chumash stories and demonstrates basketry 
arts. Vincent Tumamait, who is three-quarters Chumash, talks about his 
ancestors and sings Chumash songs to school groups. Tony Romero, who lives at 
the Chumash Reservation in Santa Barbara County, and other Chumash descendants 
demonstrate dances with a group called the Dolphin Dancers. 
</P>
<P>
They and other Chumash take part in well-attended programs sponsored by the 
National Park Service, the U.S. Forest Service, several municipal park 
departments, the Santa Barbara museum and the Ventura County Museum of History 
and Art. Almost every school district in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties 
includes studies of the Chumash. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, considering the white man's role in the disappearance of Chumash 
culture, most of what the modern-day Chumash people know about themselves has 
been uncovered by white researchers. 
</P>
<P>
McGovran was taught Chumash basketry by Pat Campbell, an expert on Chumash arts 
who was formerly affiliated with the Santa Barbara museum. Tumamait learned 
Chumash songs from recordings that a white anthropologist made for the Ventura 
museum. Romero learned Chumash dances through the museum in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an ongoing Chumash renaissance," Ward said. "The biggest problem is 
too many white people, including myself -- too many white authors, writers, 
artists, anthropologists, storytellers." 
</P>
<P>
For most Chumash, he said, "There just isn't the time to devote to public 
presentations." 
</P>
<P>
But there is a demand, especially among non-Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is fascinated," said Kathi Conti, director of Chumash arts at the 
Santa Barbara museum. "They're starved for it." 
</P>
<P>
As sometimes happens in the white man's system, demand for the Chumash often 
exceeds the supply. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this scene last month at the 100-acre Chumash Reservation near 
Solvang, an example of what one skeptical anthropologist called "New Age 
Chumash": 
</P>
<P>
Choy-Slo, a self-described Chumash spiritual leader and keeper of the flame, 
was receiving visitors between the traditional tents he has built next to his 
mobile home. Nearby was a rack with various hides, bones, animal feet and dried 
plants used in religious observances. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting cross-legged on the ground next to the spiritual leader, a woman from 
Los Angeles said she had come to humbly ask Choy-Slo to dance and give the 
blessing at an environmental conference she is organizing at Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
After all, she said, Indians were the original environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
While she had the Indian's attention, the visitor mentioned a Los Angeles gang 
project in which she is involved. Perhaps, she said, Choy-Slo could speak to 
the youths and share some Indian methods of conflict resolution. 
</P>
<P>
With her was a Santa Barbara man who whittled silently while the woman spoke. 
When his turn came, the man said he was putting together a seminar on 
alternative fuels. Again citing the Indian-environment connection, he invited 
Choy-Slo to stop by and say a few words. 
</P>
<P>
The spiritual leader said yes to the first request but was noncommittal toward 
the others. "We'll need expenses," he said, starting down a mental checklist 
that obviously had been been developed from previous negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
He later said such requests average one per week, far more than he can handle 
from the remote reservation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even drive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Choy-Slo and others present themselves as spiritual leaders, experts 
say very little actually is known about ancient Chumash religious beliefs and 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
Most Chumash laugh at the "too reverent" way some people approach Indians, said 
Ward, who has been unofficially adopted by the Tumamait clan and has a long 
association with the Chumash people. 
</P>
<P>
McGovran agreed that it's important to keep things in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be put on as a circus performer," she said. "It irritates me 
if I'm at a party and and someone says, "Tell me a Chumash story.' " 
</P>
<P>
Although there seems to be no effort by the Chumash to gain political clout, 
their increased visibility was reflected in March when Rep. Robert J. 
Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) and Sierra Club officials, who are seeking to establish 
a national wilderness in northern Ventura County, asked the tribe to suggest a 
name for the area. They chose Chumash Wilderness Area, saying it would add to 
the tribe's name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually everyone involved in the revival seems anxious not to resurrect old 
issues that have divided the Chumash, such as who -- if anyone -- should speak 
for the tribe; who should get monitoring jobs at construction sites where 
Chumash artifacts are found; and the most basic question of all: 
</P>
<P>
Who is a Chumash? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who has indexed the files of all five missions where Chumash births, 
marriages and deaths were recorded, hesitates to discuss such things as 
percentage of Chumash blood, saying such talk is divisive and potentially 
racist. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, Johnson angered a group known as the United Chumash Council, 
which controlled most monitoring jobs, by stating that his records showed most 
of its leaders were not Chumash. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson says the closest to a full-blooded Chumash is Vincent Tumamait and his 
sisters, Bertha Blanco and Margaret Duarte of Ventura. Not only was their 
father, Cecilio Tumamait, pure-blooded but their mother, Maria, was half 
Chumash. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say there are several thousand people that have some degree of Chumash 
ancestry," Johnson said, adding that his best guess is about 4,000. Most of 
them live in Ventura or Santa Barbara counties, but some also are found in Los 
Angeles County and the San Luis Obispo area. 
</P>
<P>
Chumash ancestry can be determined through mission records or "judgment rolls" 
-- lists compiled by the government in the 1920s and the 1960s to determine who 
was entitled to federal compensation for broken treaties. 
</P>
<P>
Connie Diaz has a blue suitcase crammed with such records. Her Chumash 
connection is the baptismal record for her grandmother, Maria Rafaela Leiba, 
whose mother is listed as Maria Neofita. Neofita, the Spanish word for "newly 
baptized," was the name commonly given to Chumash converts. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz said her mother often talked about her Indian heritage, but Vincent 
Tumamait said his father never discussed the subject and refused to speak the 
language. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my sisters asked my father to teach her some of the language," Tumamait 
said. "His answer was: 'Who would you talk to?' " 
</P>
<P>
At Shell Oil Co. in Ventura, where Tumamait worked for 30 years, he would list 
himself on company records as an American Indian or a Mission Indian -- a 
catchall term for various Southern California tribes -- but not as a Chumash. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't hear that word till a few years back," Tumamait said, referring to 
the time in 1984 when Ward approached him about doing some cultural programs 
through the Ventura Parks and Recreation Department. 
</P>
<P>
That was the start of a process of self-discovery that is still going on, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It started to build up in me just what our culture was," he said. "I'm still 
learning it. . . . The Indian people I meet teach me. I'm a learner." 
</P>
<P>
He is also a teacher. About three times a month, Tumamait visits schools, civic 
groups and museums to talk about his ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
"These people are very genuine," said Conti of the Santa Barbara museum. "They 
have a beautiful and humble way of presenting themselves. It quiets an 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Tumamait spoke to nearly 100 fifth-graders from Elmhurst School in 
Ventura during their three-day campout near Oak View. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ha-koo, ha-koo," he said, greeting the children with the Chumash word for 
hello. As dusk settled on the valley, he sang a welcome song and told a Chumash 
folk legend. 
</P>
<P>
Long ago, he said, when most of the Chumash lived in the Channel Islands, some 
of them wanted to return to the mainland. So Mother Earth built a bridge out of 
a rainbow, but warned those crossing it not to look down. 
</P>
<P>
Some looked anyway, and plunged into the sea. Not wanting to see the Chumash 
drown, Mother Earth turned them into dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why dolphins are a symbol of the Chumash," Tumamait said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he winced when he was introduced to the children as a "Chumash Indian 
chief," a title he shuns. 
</P>
<P>
"I refer to myself as a Chumash elder," he said. "In the Ojai area, they 
recognize me as a leader because of what I've been doing." 
</P>
<P>
Before he spoke, Tumamait was asked why he spends so much time speaking about 
his people. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to change the American way of life," he said. "The Indian 
cultural ways, that's in the past. But it's good to re-create it and have 
Indians get into their culture."

WATER DISTRICT RATES, BUDGET ON AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Casitas Municipal Water District is holding three public hearings Wednesday 
to raise water rates, increase board members' pay and adopt a $7-million budget 
for the 1990-91 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
If the new rates are approved, the district's 2,400 residential customers 
throughout Ojai Valley will see their bills increase from 5% to 10% in July, 
depending on user category. 
</P>
<P>
The average bimonthly residential rate would go up about $2 from the current 
figure of $27.14. 
</P>
<P>
Another 400 agricultural and commercial customers' rates will increase between 
6.5% to 10%, according to their type of water use. 
</P>
<P>
The overall 8.2% average rate hike will generate $258,000 annual revenue for 
the district. The increase is to cover a 7% rise in the cost of operating the 
district, officials said, and the expected drop in water sales from 
conservation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
This hike is in addition to the 2.75% annual increase for the next eight years 
the board adopted in April to cover operating costs for a future water 
treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
A public hearing will be held Wednesday on a proposal to raise the five 
directors' fees from $121.55 to $127.53 for each day they meet to discuss 
district business. The number of days they meet varies from about three to six 
or more per month. 
</P>
<P>
The draft $7-million budget includes $150,000 for a design study to import 
state aqueduct water and $400,000 for part of the design costs to build a 
combination treatment and hydroelectric power plant proposed at the base of 
Casitas Dam. 
</P>
<P>
The budget also includes $40,000 to develop a pilot program to charge large 
water consumers in the Rincon area higher rates for irrigating in the 
afternoon. That's when Southern California Edison bills more for the 
electricity to pump the water. 
</P>
<P>
Casitas plans to expand the pilot program districtwide in the next five years. 
Officials hope that it will be an incentive to their customers to reduce peak 
demands on the system. The board meets at 3 p.m. Wednesday in the district 
office, 1055 Ventura Ave., Oak View. THIA BELL

CITY PLANNERS DEVELOP UTOPIAN VISION OF SANTA CLARITA; 
</P>
<P>
GROWTH: FOUR MEETINGS ARE PLANNED TO ENCOURAGE PUBLIC INPUT IN CREATING A 
BLUEPRINT FOR THE FUTURE OF THE VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It sounds like Utopia: a city with plentiful parks, unspoiled hillsides, 
free-flowing traffic and lots of oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
And don't forget the monorail. Or the airport. Or the four-year university. 
</P>
<P>
If a citizens committee charged with plotting the future of Santa Clarita has 
its way, that's exactly what the city will look like in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
In short, Santa Clarita would become a model city, a home to high-tech industry 
as well as suburbanites looking for a house and a patch of lawn to call their 
own. That is the vision contained in a master plan for the development of the 
city and the surrounding Santa Clarita Valley. Councilwoman Jan Heidt has 
called it the most important document the city will ever produce. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Monday, the city will hold a series of public forums that will help 
create that plan, technically known as a general plan. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting is one of four informal public forums scheduled this month to 
explain the general plan, answer questions from property owners and hear the 
public's recommendations on improving the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The focal point of the forums will be a map which designates the potential 
development of land, with categories that range from commercial development to 
agriculture. That map, developed by the 23-member General Plan Advisory 
Committee, embodies the committee's hopes for a grander future for the 
2-year-old city. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Trinkley, the city principal planner, called the map the heart of the 
general plan. "It's the hopes and dreams and aspirations," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Property owners will be encouraged to find their parcels on the map and discuss 
the plan with city planners and advisory committee members, Trinkley said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita officials are hoping for large crowds at the public forums but 
concede they could have a hard time rousing public interest in an inherently 
dry subject weighted down by dreary jargon such as "density bonuses," "noise 
impact management" and "hillside management overlays." Even the name -- general 
plan -- is a snoozer. 
</P>
<P>
"From a P.R. perspective, we have got to change that word," said Gail Foy, city 
public information officer. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said their task will be generating interest in the plan without 
raising false expectations about the plan's power to shape future development. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a document that solves all the problems," Trinkley said. "It doesn't 
give all the answers." 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, every city and county is required to draft a general plan, a 
broad blueprint for development in a region. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, it could indicate the city's desire for an industrial park in the 
southern part of the city, but it can't force a developer to start 
construction. Instead, the plan provides a framework that would allow an 
industrial park to be built. In that regard, the plan is subject to the highs 
and lows of the economy and the desires of entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
The plan contains dozens of goals and policies. Some of the unusual or 
potentially controversial ones urge the city to: 
</P>
<P>
* Discourage development and severe grading on the valley's picturesque and 
rugged hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
* Oppose development outside the city limits which does not provide adequate 
roads, schools, sewers or other public services for the growing population. 
</P>
<P>
* Set design standards to improve the appearance of development despite the 
building industry's traditional opposition to such standards. 
</P>
<P>
* Annex most of the surrounding Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
* Establish the Santa Clara River as a focal point for recreation in the city. 
</P>
<P>
* Encourage all new office buildings and industries to make child care 
available to employees. 
</P>
<P>
* Encourage the development of English-language classes and monitor their 
availability to the public. 
</P>
<P>
* Promote affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
* Promote Santa Clarita as a commercial link between Los Angeles and Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Although the plan contains numerous goals and policies, it does not spell out 
nitty-gritty details, such as the dimensions of parking spaces or the height of 
buildings. Those details, said Trinkley, are left to zoning and other 
ordinances which implement the plan's overall goals. 
</P>
<P>
The draft of Santa Clarita's general plan, in the works for almost two years, 
was written by the advisory committee selected by the City Council. In addition 
to the public forums, city staffers will present the plan to community groups 
and homeowner associations. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the plan must be approved by the city Planning Commission and City 
Council, which could happen as soon as this fall. City Manager George Caravalho 
said the final approval could be delayed until next spring if the deliberations 
bog down and the work is not completed before Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
Caravalho noted that the current map and a 67-page report listing goals and 
policies are only drafts that will change during the public debate. "We want to 
emphasize that the maps are not final," Trinkley said. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, the plan aims to preserve the valley's topography, relieve its 
traffic and social problems and promote a prosperous future. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the county's general plan, which governed the area before Santa 
Clarita incorporated in 1987, the city's plan is broader in scope, said Ralph 
Killmeyer, chairman of the advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
The plan covers not only the 40-square-mile city but an additional 160 square 
miles in the surrounding valley, which Santa Clarita hopes to annex in the 
future. In all, it's an area larger than Atlanta. The huge area is a challenge 
and a rare opportunity for planners, Trinkley said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a planner's dream," she said. 
</P>
<P>
That dream is codified in general categories, or "elements," such as land use, 
housing, safety and noise. In addition to those elements, which are required by 
law, Santa Clarita's plan includes some additional elements: economic 
development, parks and recreation, air quality, community design, human 
resources and public services, facilities and utilities. 
</P>
<P>
These extra elements address everything from child care and trail systems to 
recycling and cultural affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The county plan viewed the Santa Clarita Valley as another San Fernando Valley, 
Killmeyer complained. The city's proposed plan strives for the opposite, 
stressing a small-town atmosphere over urban growth. In fact, one goal is to 
"discourage the development of additional strip commercial centers and corner 
mini-shopping centers." 
</P>
<P>
And unlike the county planners, the city sees the need to preserve the right of 
way for a futuristic monorail that proponents believe could be built to shuttle 
residents throughout the city. The plan does not address how the monorail would 
be built or who would pay for it. The plan also recommends that a committee be 
established to lobby for a four-year college in the area. "They haven't 
considered the possibility of a university," Killmeyer said of the county plan. 
"We have." 
</P>
<P>
In another departure, the city's general plan says residential development 
should be limited unless there are adequate schools to serve the influx of new 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, the county supervisors have said that state law makes education a 
state responsibility and thus prevents the county from denying development 
proposals just because they might have a negative impact on schools. 
</P>
<P>
Other ideas are sure to surface in the public hearing process. Councilman Carl 
Boyer III recently suggested that the general plan recommend special incentives 
to residential developers who try to sell to people who work in the Santa 
Clarita Valley. Such a plan would cut down on commuting, he said. "I think it's 
something we want to look into," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For all its goals and recommendations, the plan is supposed to be a flexible 
document that can be amended and revised as the city grows, Killmeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not absolutely rigid," Planning Commissioner Connie Worden said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a living document," Councilman Howard P. (Buck) McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
But the advisory committee also hopes that the final plan will retain some 
solidity, Killmeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita officials and community activists have complained that the 
county's general plan was amended frequently during the 1980s to accommodate 
the plans of developers, thus fueling the region's explosive growth. "There was 
no control over it," Killmeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Killmeyer hopes the city's general plan will change with age, but slowly and 
with care. 
</P>
<P>
Trinkley agreed. "This is not something we want to change frequently," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Monday, the city of Santa Clarita will hold a series of public forums 
to explain a proposed general plan that would guide growth in the city through 
the year 2010. The forums, to be held in each of Santa Clarita's four 
communities, are planned as informal meetings where city planners will explain 
the general plan map and answer residents' questions. All forums will start at 
7 p.m.

MARCHERS SHOUT SLOGANS AGAINST GANGS, CRIME IN NEIGHBORHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAYERENE BARKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
More than 100 men, women and children marched through a graffiti-marred Van 
Nuys neighborhood Saturday morning shouting anti-crime slogans as a protest 
against gangs, drugs and crime. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to go out and wake up the gang members," said Mary Lou Holte, 
founder of Town Keepers Community Watch, the Neighborhood Watch group that 
organized the march. "We're going to get them out of bed." 
</P>
<P>
Some residents of Delano Street peered out windows and doors of apartment 
buildings and houses as the marchers noisily proclaimed "no more gangs" and "no 
more drugs." Others on the sidewalk and in yards stopped what they were doing 
and stared at the marchers. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this helps," said one marcher, Miguel Coronado, 17, of Canoga Park. 
"But the gang-bangers are just going to laugh at this. It won't bother them. 
This march is a temporary kind of thing to them; the gangs are forever." 
</P>
<P>
Miguel, who will graduate this month from Taft High School, said he joined the 
march because after four years in a Los Angeles gang, "I'm tired of it." He 
said he wants to join the Marines and eventually become an undercover police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
Before the march, a group of youths from Victory Outreach Church sang over and 
over, "Once I was a gang-banger, but Jesus set me free" as they waited for a 
rally to begin in front of Van Nuys City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
A group of elementary school students from Bassett Street School held up a 
homemade anti-gang banner. Holte and others cheered the march participants. 
"How many of you are fed up with gangs?" Holte asked. The crowd responded with 
a muffled "yes." 
</P>
<P>
"You're not loud enough," Holte said. The marchers' response was louder and 
more emphatic. 
</P>
<P>
"Gangs are not what's happening," shouted a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Alarcon, Mayor Tom Bradley's newly appointed liaison to the San 
Fernando Valley, also spoke at the rally. 
</P>
<P>
"If the community does not get involved, the problem will remain," he said. 
Alarcon said he was wearing his "Turn the Tide" T-shirt, a memento from a large 
anti-crime rally last month in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"But this today is how we're going to turn the tide," he said. "It is not going 
to be rallies in Los Angeles that's going to do it. It will be the small 
community groups such as this one." 
</P>
<P>
Also lending their support to Holte's effort were representatives of Councilman 
Marvin Braude, the Van Nuys Homeowners Assn. and the Haddon-Mercer Homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
The group marched from Van Nuys City Hall along Sylvan Street, Van Nuys 
Boulevard and Delano Street from Van Nuys Boulevard to Noble Avenue and ended 
at Delano Park for another rally, food and live music. 
</P>
<P>
Holte, who had two ribs broken in an assault in October, 1988, founded the Town 
Keepers last year because, she said, law-abiding citizens have to take a stand 
and actively fight crime in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
She said she was disappointed that more people did not attend Saturday's march. 
"I've worked real hard on this for two months. I had commitments from 400 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County gang worker Manuel Velasquez said the event was the largest 
of three or four marches Holte has organized. But, he added, "there should be 
300, 400, 500 people here." 
</P>
<P>
Velasquez challenged participants to each bring 10 friends with them to the 
next rally. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to back each other up like the home boys," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Velasquez said there have been 14 deaths attributed to gangs in the Valley so 
far this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, my partner and I went to 18 gang funerals," he said. "There are 
almost 200 gangs in the Valley. It's getting worse and it's not going to get 
better unless we do something about it."

MOBILE HOME ZONING PLAN DEEPENS DISPUTE IN CARSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carson's beleaguered mobile home residents have gone on the offensive, asking 
the City Council to approve an increasingly popular measure that would create a 
special zone for mobile home parks and make it all but impossible to shut one 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Although the council did not discuss the proposal, referring it to the Planning 
Commission for review, its place on last week's agenda has set the stage for 
the next battle of the Carson Mobile Home Wars. Park owners are already talking 
about a lawsuit if the ordinance passes. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, the well-organized mobile home residents have played an 
important role in municipal politics, gaining rent control for mobile homes in 
1979, some relocation benefits in 1985 in case of park closings and more 
substantial benefits in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But in the last two years, the 2,700 mobile home households have seen those 
gains threatened with the closure of one park, plans to close three more and 
rumors of other pending sales as owners have sought to cash in on escalating 
land values. 
</P>
<P>
Coni Hathaway, co-chair of Homeowners Against Rent Decontrol, the city's 
largest mobile homeowners organization, said the proposed ordinance was an 
effort to halt the wave of closures. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize we are not going to stop them all," she said. "What we have 
requested is a zone for mobile home parks so that if they are sold, they can 
remain mobile home parks. . . . Mobile homes in the city of Carson have 
provided affordable housing for senior citizens and families." 
</P>
<P>
According to the proposed ordinance, all parks in residential and commercial 
zones would become part of a new mobile home park zone. The proposed law would 
prevent park owners from closing down a park and converting the land to another 
use without a zoning change. 
</P>
<P>
Mobile home residents in Carson have talked of a mobile home zoning ordinance 
since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Similar ordinances are in effect in Los Angeles, San Diego, San Juan 
Capistrano, San Marcos, Escondido, Carlsbad, Oceanside, Chula Vista, Rancho 
Mirage, Palm Springs, Palm Desert, and unincorporated portions of Los Angeles, 
San Diego, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Carson ordinance differs from most of the others because it would 
also require an owner to give park residents six months to determine whether 
they want to buy the park. 
</P>
<P>
The council meeting was filled with members of the homeowners organization 
Tuesday. The proposal also brought out park owners. They have kept a low 
profile since losing a bitter legal battle over the validity of signatures for 
a ballot measure to eliminate much of the city's mobile home rent control 
ordinance last year. 
</P>
<P>
The owners, who are suing to overturn the rent control and relocation 
assistance ordinances, promptly vowed to fight passage of the proposed 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
J. William Finkel, a Rancho Palos Verdes resident who is a part-owner of the 
Imperial Avalon park, said the stakes are high. 
</P>
<P>
"If this new ordinance comes into effect, you are going to have a great many 
more lawsuits that are going to run into millions of dollars," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because mobile home dwellers are only 8% of the city's population, Finkel said, 
"what we intend to do is make up a newsletter and circularize it among the 
total population of the city and let them know where this money is going." 
</P>
<P>
Edward W. Jong said the ordinance would prevent the city from converting Avalon 
Boulevard between Carson Street and the San Diego (405) Freeway into "a major 
automobile dealers' row. . . . This would bring in more revenues." 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Carlburg, an attorney representing Colony Cove Mobile Estates and 
Carson Harbor Village, the city's two largest mobile home parks, said that 
state law appears to bar the sort of ordinance proposed by the residents. 
</P>
<P>
She asserted that the ordinance, taken together with rent control and 
relocation assistance, amounts to an unconstitutional taking of property. 
</P>
<P>
Urging that the city attorney review the proposal, Carlburg said, "Then we will 
come back to you when you have to make that hard political decision, and we 
will give all the good political reasons and public policy reasons why you 
should not do so, as well." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview later, she warned: "If the city continues on this course, they 
will be in perpetual litigation. Mobile home parks in Carson are located on 
major commercial thoroughfares. The owners are not going to lay down and let 
this happen. They have not collected market rates for 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
But Art Eaton, president of the Imperial Avalon Acquisition Assn., which is 
trying to buy the Imperial Avalon park from its owners, said policy reasons 
dictate that Carson retain its mobile home parks. 
</P>
<P>
"It is essential that the stock of low- and moderate-income housing be 
maintained in this city (for it) to remain eligible for state and federal 
funding that is needed in this city. Mobile home parks represent a substantial 
part of the low- and moderate-income housing stock in this city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And in the sole comment from the council, Councilwoman Sylvia Muise, a longtime 
supporter of mobile home residents' interests, criticized park owners. 
</P>
<P>
"The council shouldn't make political decisions, if you will, when we are 
dealing with people's lives and the place that they live. . . . I really resent 
some of the comments that were made by some of the speakers," she said. "If we 
are doing something that is helpful and beneficial to the mobile home 
residents, it is helpful and beneficial to the entire city of Carson." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Pearson, 74, a Bel Air park resident, said: "I'm an old hand in Carson. I 
lived here before it was a city. . . . Now they are destroying the mobile home 
parks. Some are already gone. So I feel nervous about that. I don't think it is 
a good idea for people to feel nervous about whether they are going to lose 
their homes or not. If we had a mobile home park zone, maybe it would stop." 
</P>
<P>
Despite opposition from the residents lobby, Citation park closed in May, the 
Carson Avalon and El Rancho parks have filed for permission to close, and 
owners of the Bel Abbey park have informed city officials that they intend to 
close.

MAN SHOT AFTER FIRING RIFLE AT OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Police shot and wounded a distraught Northridge man during a gun battle Friday 
night after the man fired a rifle at officers from a window of his apartment, 
authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Gary Fassett, 25, was in critical condition at Los Angeles 
County-USC Medical Center after being shot several times. He was arrested on 
suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer. 
</P>
<P>
No officers were wounded, said Lt. William Hall of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's officer-involved shooting unit. 
</P>
<P>
The standoff apparently grew out of an argument between Fassett and his wife at 
a Reseda pizza parlor earlier in the evening, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said the man's wife left the restaurant with their children in the family 
car, and Fassett offered several youths $20 to drive him to his apartment in 
the 8700 block of Etiwanda Avenue. But when the youths dropped him off, he 
returned from his apartment brandishing a .22-caliber rifle, Hall said. He also 
brandished the weapon at the apartment's manager, who called police, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
When officers Leo Slagel, 55, and Hector Jaramillo, 23, arrived in the 
building's rear parking lot about 10:30 p.m., Fassett appeared at his 
second-floor window and told them to leave, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
When they did not, Fassett grabbed the rifle and pointed it in the officers' 
direction, prompting Slagel to fire one round from his .12-gauge shotgun, Hall 
said. Jaramillo fired two rounds from his 9mm pistol, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Fassett disappeared from the officers' view for several minutes and then fired 
two rounds at them, Hall said. The officers returned fire, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two backup officers, John Futrell, 40, and Michael Binford, 41, fired a total 
of nine rounds at Fassett in the building's hallway after he pointed the rifle 
at them as he left his apartment, Hall said. Fassett was shot several times.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: A TEACHER TURNS A SCIENCE CENTER INTO A PLACE TO LEARN 
ABOUT NATURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
What do you do if you teach in the second largest urban school district in the 
United States and prefer the outdoors to the classroom? 
</P>
<P>
If you're lucky, you wind up in Carol Eyster's job. 
</P>
<P>
For the last decade, Eyster has headed the San Pedro Science Center, one of 
seven centers operated by the Los Angeles Unified School District for teachers 
and elementary and junior high students. Eyster is credited with turning the 
five-acre center into a manicured compound with various gardens, an orchard and 
menagerie. 
</P>
<P>
"When she first started working here, this place was a jungle," said Bill 
Fitzpatrick, a longtime aide at the center. "It was totally metamorphosed under 
her." 
</P>
<P>
Now Eyster has set out to do the same thing at the about two-acre 186th Street 
Science Center in Gardena, where she was recently transferred with orders to 
recapture its overgrown areas from the wily ways of Mother Nature and return it 
to children. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to get the kids here," Eyster said the other day as she walked the 
center's grounds and pointed out the trees badly in need of pruning, an unruly 
patch of hops and wheat, and abandoned potting buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to show them there is something different from the asphalt and the 
buildings." 
</P>
<P>
The work is a labor of love for Eyster, who grew up on a large dairy farm in 
Ohio. By the age of 5, Eyster said, she was driving tractors; by 9 or 10, she 
was supervising hay-harvesting crews. She was a member of 4-H until she was 21 
-- an age when many have long since left the student agricultural club. 
</P>
<P>
Eyster said she became a teacher because she was "not into money, and I knew I 
really liked kids." In 1969, she became a teacher at Dana Junior High School in 
San Pedro, where she ran a program that focused on outdoor studies. 
</P>
<P>
"I would always be on the campus, and we would be hugging a tree," Eyster said. 
"I would never allow my students to be encased in a classroom." 
</P>
<P>
Eyster's official title at the Gardena center is resource teacher. As such, her 
job is to demystify science and "lower the anxiety level for teachers, as well 
as the students," according to Carol Takemoto, who coordinates the science 
center programs for the school district. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, Eyster conceded, that isn't easy. With some teachers, she has to 
start at a very elementary level. "Some of my teachers don't even know the 
difference between a sheep and a goat," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For both teachers and students, Eyster said, she relies on a teaching 
philosophy that preaches "hands-on experience. You can only know those things 
that you experience, and that is it. You can't tell me what an elephant feels 
like if you haven't felt an elephant. 
</P>
<P>
"I have another philosophy," she added. "You cannot force anyone to do 
anything. I put the responsibility on the child. . . . It is not my job to 
force someone to learn. They must come wanting to learn." 
</P>
<P>
By next fall, Eyster said, she hopes the grounds at the Gardena center will be 
in tiptop shape. Already, she has made giant strides. With assistance from the 
California Conservation Corps, numerous trees have been pruned. One coral and 
six sweet gum trees have been taken out. Some of the trees were infested with 
termites; the roots of others were cracking nearby sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
Corps workers will return in the fall to plant an orchard where the barley and 
wheat now grow. Eyster has already planted cotton, and work has started on a 
pond. A Japanese garden and drought-resistant plants will be put in as well as 
a desert landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Eyster said she also hopes to establish areas around the center's grounds where 
children can learn about small machines. She also wants to build a weather 
station. To supplement her $1,500-a-year budget, she plans to establish a small 
recycling program at the center where visiting children will drop off 
newspapers and aluminum cans. She started the same kind of program at the San 
Pedro center. 
</P>
<P>
"When she got this transfer, I told her, 'I know where the best science center 
will be,' " Fitzpatrick said, adding that it won't be long before the Gardena 
center is on a par with San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
"By September, it will be cranking," he predicted. Tim Waters

GROVE REMEMBERED

<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for your reporting of the unfortunate killing of more than 20 olive 
trees in the Walnut Grove shopping area in Northridge. I agree with Alex 
Kavvadias, owner of the Greek Market Restaurant, whom you quoted saying that a 
tree is a life, the "lungs of the earth," manufacturing oxygen and providing 
shade for what is otherwise a barren expanse of concrete and asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its graceful olive trees, the Walnut Grove was a place apart. I have 
patronized the shops and restaurants in the Walnut Grove for 18 years. I have 
always looked for a shady spot under one of the olive trees to park my car, and 
I have never been inconvenienced in any way by an olive on or around me or my 
car. 
</P>
<P>
Ignorance is the only possible explanation for the killing of all those 
beautiful trees. Chlorophyll is the only source of oxygen on our planet, and it 
occurs only in green leaves and algae. Every time we lose a tree we lose 
another source of oxygen. But for chlorophyll we would not exist and we cannot 
persist. Why can't we all learn this most fundamental fact of life?

POST OFFICE STRIKES OUT IN RINGERS INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An investigation into claims that a post office softball team included ringers 
with forged government IDs has struck out, a federal postal inspector said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Postal Inspection Service was unable to fully substantiate a mail 
carrier's allegations that a team called the Wongs had issued doctored 
identification cards to qualify ringers, or outside players, for employee-only 
tournaments, spokesman Donald Obritsch said Thursday. He said publicity may 
have stymied the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators verified that one postal service ID was issued to a softball 
player who earns a living by preparing new cars for sale. But the athlete told 
inspectors he had only used the ID once, to play with the Wongs at least two 
years ago in Las Vegas, and the card itself could not be found, Obritsch said. 
</P>
<P>
Although ringers are not uncommon in amateur sports, rules about their use vary 
from tournament to tournament and league to league. What concerned postal 
inspectors, Obritsch said, was the alleged forging of a government document to 
make the Wongs' ringers eligible for tournaments that were exclusively for post 
office employees. 
</P>
<P>
Had the charges proved true, culprits could have faced five years in prison and 
a $10,000 fine for forging a government document. 
</P>
<P>
Obritsch said newspaper and television coverage may have alerted suspects to 
the investigation, causing them to destroy evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it may have jeopardized this case, with the possible or probable 
destruction of the primary piece of evidence," Obritsch said in a telephone 
interview from his Pasadena office. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we recovered the card, you just never know if we'd been able to 
determine who forged the card," said Obritsch, explaining why the investigation 
was not more conclusive. 
</P>
<P>
Obritsch declined to specify the number of people interviewed or their 
identities. He said that apart from the one car detailer, investigators found 
no other corroboration of the claims. 
</P>
<P>
The letter carrier who brought the charges, Jill Helms of Sunland, expressed 
surprise and outrage when told of Obritsch's announcement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"You are kidding! Are you kidding me? How could they do that?" said Helms. "I 
can't believe that. That's a bunch of baloney." 
</P>
<P>
The ringer story surfaced as part of Helms' claim that her former supervisor in 
the Valencia post office -- Wongs team member Charles Evans -- began harassing 
her after she inadvertently discovered the alleged ringers during a casual 
conversation about softball. Helms also manages a successful Burbank softball 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"This has definitely given me something to think about," said Helms, who has 
been on stress leave since October. "This is not right. It's really wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Obritsch said postal inspectors also found no evidence of harassment, although 
the postal service will decide whether administrative charges are warranted. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, Helms' former supervisor, said he was not surprised by the postal 
inspectors' conclusions. He also denied harassing Helms. 
</P>
<P>
The first baseman said postal inspectors asked him to repeatedly write the name 
"John Smith," the signature on a photocopy of the one forged ID card they were 
able to locate. "There's no mistaking my signature and there was no 
comparison," Evans said. "I was not worried, not one bit."

QUAKE UPGRADE MAY START IN YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Repair work on City Hall and other city buildings and bridges could begin 
within a year as a result of Tuesday's passage of Proposition G, a $376-million 
bond issue to upgrade aging municipal structures to meet earthquake standards, 
according to Los Angeles city officials. 
</P>
<P>
The ballot measure, which required a two-thirds majority for passage, won with 
72% of the votes cast. 
</P>
<P>
Almost one-third of the money -- about $112 million -- will be earmarked to 
repair the historic 27-story City Hall. Also on the priority list of projects 
are 136 multispan bridges, including several built in the 1920s that link 
downtown with the Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 459 city-owned bridges are scheduled for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"The measure will allow the city to make necessary repairs for the movement of 
emergency vehicles during and after a major earthquake," said City Councilman 
Richard Alatorre, the proposition's author and chairman of the council's Public 
Safety Committee. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the measure will also allow strengthening of buildings vital to 
maintaining public order, such as police and fire stations and those frequently 
used by the general public. In the last category, he said, are the Anderson 
Memorial Senior Recreation Center in San Pedro and the outdoor 6,200-seat Greek 
Theater in the Hollywood Hills, where the stage needs strengthening. 
</P>
<P>
Also considered of particular importance are the 11 historic structures -- 
including the Avila Abode, the city's oldest building -- at Olvera Street, the 
aging Mexican marketplace north of the Civic Center. About $16 million has been 
set aside for seismic work there. 
</P>
<P>
The city would be "exposed to a great deal of liability" at Olvera Street if 
there is a substantial loss of life due to an earthquake since as many as 2 
million people visit the tourist spot each year, Alatorre said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Engineer Rodney Haraga said the repair work authorized by the 
proposition on 84 buildings and 459 bridges should be completed in five to 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the design work on City Hall, completed in 1928, has not begun.

MATTINGLY IS RICH, BUT ALSO VERY DEPRESSED

Afternoons bring hope to Don Mattingly, only to have evenings deliver despair. 
And the more this routine repeats itself, the more despair begins to swallow 
hope. The toll of playing on the worst team of his pro career is beginning to 
wear on Mattingly. 
</P>
<P>
After another Yankee loss here Wednesday night, Mattingly slouched in a chair 
in front of his locker with a glazed look on his face. He asked reporters what 
the team's record was, and when he heard it was 18-32, he winced. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, oh, man. This is just so tough," Mattingly said. "I've never been on a 
club that lost like this. It hasn't been like this since I was 13 playing for a 
Babe Ruth League team. We were horrible. Awful. Plus we had bad uniforms. Ugly 
green things. It was terrible." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Thursday, he showed up for early hitting 4 1/2 hours before game 
time, shagged balls with a right-handed glove and talked about seeing the 
positive in every situation, even one as bleak as the Yankees' predicament. 
"You've just seen the metamorphosis," Mattingly said of his outlook. 
</P>
<P>
But with each defeat, Mattingly's optimism requires a little more effort. 
</P>
<P>
"It does get harder," he said. "It's very hard the way we're playing. I'm 
learning to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been difficult because we've lost so much. The end of the games have been 
harder than the beginning. I mean, by the seventh inning we're getting pounded 
again or we're down a run and we don't expect to win and you think, 'This is 
another night we couldn't get over the hill.' And you come back today and it's 
a fight to get ready to play tonight. That's the feeling we have to fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if this team was ever confident. We weren't. Remember, we weren't 
exactly a great team last year. And when they traded guys like Pags (Mike 
Pagliarulo), they traded away our attitude. We have nobody with that swagger 
that good teams have. Winny (Dave Winfield) had it. Jack Clark had presence. 
Those good teams we had, we'd be one run down in the seventh and we we were 
going to win. Somebody would pop one or Rickey (Henderson) would get on, steal 
a base or two and score on a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
"This team isn't like that. What they need to do is get rid of anybody who 
doesn't care. I take it home every night and some guys just leave it. That 
ticks me off, to see a guy laughing and joking around when we lose. He doesn't 
care. I'm not saying we have a lot of those guys. But you don't want to have 
any of those kind of guys on your team." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, the Yankees' win total has dropped from 97 to 90 to 89 to 85 to 74 
and, at this rate, to 57 this year. Mattingly, who could have been a free agent 
after this season, committed himself to five more years of this when he agreed 
to a $19.3-million contract on the eve of Opening Day. 
</P>
<P>
Now here he is two months later, having witnessed the ninth change of managers 
since his debut in September, 1982, and struggling for a pathetic team that 
compiled the worst 50-game record of any Yankee outfit since 1913. Mattingly is 
in an 0-for-17 slump that has dropped his average to .263. He has one 
extra-base hit, a double, in his past 64 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"In my worst moments, yes, I say, 'Why did I sign?"' Mattingly said. "I could 
have just played this season and then had my pick of where I wanted to go after 
that. It would have been fun. 
</P>
<P>
"But then I come around and think about the reasons why I signed. I want to be 
a part of winning here. It would kill me if I left and two or three years later 
the Yankees won. I played for a team that won 97 games, had the second-best 
record in baseball, and now I'm playing for one that has the worst record in 
baseball. I want to be a part of bringing it around again. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I've always been real positive. 
That's just the way I am. I can see a lot of good things on this club. I've 
played with some real outlaws here and I've seen the good side in them. I've 
told them, 'You're better than that.' And if they don't come around, it bothers 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly will be 34 when his contract extension expires. He has indicated that 
he prefers to retire then. The danger is that Mattingly will leave baseball as 
the Ernie Banks of his time, a Hall of Fame player who spent his entire career 
with one club and never made it to postseason play. There is no reason to 
believe that it will turn out any other way, certainly not as long as George 
Steinbrenner runs the team. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't scare me," Mattingly said. "I have no fear of that. As long as 
I'm here doing the best I can and being the best player I can be, I can live 
with that. I mean, I want to play in the postseason. And I know I'm going to. 
Here. I have no fear of that. After the five years is up, if I haven't made it, 
maybe I'll just have to come back again."

A LOOK BACK AT THE ORIGINAL BLAZERMANIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The images of that magical June in Oregon 13 years ago still warm the hearts of 
Blazermaniacs: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bill Walton ripping off his jersey and hurling it into the crowd after 
clinching the title against Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A sea of humanity estimated at half a million swamping the team in a 
victory parade up Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Walton pouring beer on Neil Goldschmidt's head as the mayor spoke at the 
ensuing celebration. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers of 1977 were Portland's first and only taste of sports 
success on such a grand scale. 
</P>
<P>
The Blazers' return to the NBA Finals this year has rekindled memories of that 
sunny day when this city became the basketball capital of the world, winning a 
championship that caught Oregon, as well as the rest of the league, by 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"The team had never had a .500 season, had never even been to the playoffs," 
Jack Ramsay, the Blazers' coach that season, said, "so to win a championship 
was kind of shocking and euphoric. I think everyone just delighted in feeling 
the ecstasy of it." 
</P>
<P>
Portland was in just its seventh NBA season. Ramsay was in the first year as 
head coach. He came to town and promptly promised to build his team around 
Walton, the unconventional redhead whose first two seasons had been checkered 
by injury and off-court controversy that surrounded his counterculture 
lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had any controversies with Bill while he was playing," Ramsay said. 
"He was a great player to coach. He was very supportive of everything I tried 
to do. He played hard at practice and was an intense player in games." 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the Portland lineup complimented Walton's exceptional abilities as 
a passer and rebounder. The power forward was Maurice Lucas, "The Enforcer" 
signed when the American Basketball Association dissolved. The other forward 
was Bob Gross, who often was the target of Walton's perfect passes as he moved 
up and down the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
The off-guard was Lionel Hollins, in his second season with Portland. The 
playmaker was Dave Twardzik, nicknamed "Pinball" for his ability to bounce 
through the defense toward the basket. Twardzik, too, was an ABA leftover. 
</P>
<P>
The bench included sharpshooting guard-forward Larry Steele, streakshooting 
guard Herm Gilliam, rookie playmaker Johnny Davis and power forward Lloyd Neal, 
among others. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Walton's team. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that made that team so good was Bill Walton," Steele said. "Bill 
Walton was a great player, and he made other people very good. He was the key 
to our success." 
</P>
<P>
"Bill was magnificent," Ramsay said. "Had he been able to continue, I think he 
would have been recognized as the best center ever to play the game." 
</P>
<P>
The team had a 49-33 regular-season record and opened the playoffs with a tough 
2-1 victory over Chicago in the best-of-3 opening round series. 
</P>
<P>
Next up was Denver. Portland won the series 4-2, even though the Nuggets had 
the homecourt advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Next up was the Los Angeles Lakers, who had survived a rugged seven-game series 
with Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
The Blazers won Game 1 on the Lakers' court, then Gilliam came off the bench to 
lead Portland to a victory in Game 2. Portland returned home to win two more 
and sweep its way into the Finals against Julius Erving and the Philadelphia 
76ers. 
</P>
<P>
The Finals were rough. Philadelphia won the first two on its home court. Game 2 
featured a melee ignited by Lucas and Darryl Dawkins. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a physical game and both Lucas and Dawkins were the intimidators for 
their respective teams, but neither was really a very good fighter," Ramsay 
said. "Dawkins threw a punch at Bob Gross earlier and hit Doug Collins, his own 
teammate, right in the eye. It was right in front of our bench. I couldn't 
believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"Luke came around later and threw a haymaker kind of from the side at Dawkins." 
</P>
<P>
The two squared off but no further punches were landed. Both were ejected and 
fined $2,500 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
"My most vivid memory was of the fight between Lucas and Dawkins," Walton said. 
</P>
<P>
"I also remember Doctor J saying he knew all of our sets and patterns," Walton 
said. "But even we didn't know what were going to do. When he said that I knew 
then we had them." 
</P>
<P>
The Blazers went on to become the second team in NBA history to come back from 
a 2-0 deficit to win the title. Lucas diffused the tension by shaking hands 
with Dawkins before the start of Game 3 in Portland. The Blazers won that 
contest 129-107, then swamped the 76ers 130-98 in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a long layoff (nine days) after sweeping the Lakers and we struggled 
bigtime in the first two games in Philadelphia," Walton said. "And then the 
fans in Portland got us going and we won four straight." 
</P>
<P>
The series shifted back to Philadelphia, and again Portland won 110-94. When 
the Blazers returned, thousands crowded the Portland International Airport 
terminal for the arrival. The players could barely fight their way through the 
throng. 
</P>
<P>
"We Win It Today," screamed the front-page headline of The Oregonian. 
</P>
<P>
And so they did, hanging on for a 109-107 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The city erupted. There was dancing in the streets. The next day, it seemed 
like everybody showed up for the victory parade downtown. Walton, the most 
valuable player in the championship series, tried to ride his bicycle, and lost 
it in the confusion. It was returned the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"It was incredible," Ramsay said. "That parade was such a spontaneous thing. To 
have half a million people there on Broadway. I don't think anybody who 
participated in that parade will ever forget it." 
</P>
<P>
The Blazers thought they had built a dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we'd be in that role for several years," Lucas said. "We were 
looking forward to winning it on a number of occasions." 
</P>
<P>
The following season, it looked like they were right. Portland got off to a 
50-10 start and was the overwhelming favorite to win a second straight title. 
But Walton and Gross suffered injuries and the team never was the same again.

THIS DESORMEAUX LOOKING TO TAKE A TRAINER'S ROUTE TO FAME, FORTUNE 
</P>

<P>
Even before his younger brother put the family name on the racing map, Keith 
Desormeaux had planned to make a name for himself. 
</P>
<P>
Kent and Keith spent their youths "like any two brothers, fighting and arguing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd tear him up," Keith said. So when Kent beat his older brother to the punch 
in the racing game, it was, you could say, the first of his many upsets. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after getting his college degree and paying other assorted dues, Keith, 
23, has taken out his trainer's license in Maryland. He'll soon have seven 
horses under his care at Pimlico, and his first start in Maryland could come as 
soon as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Desormeaux, 20, suffered a cracked rib in a Hollywood Park spill Sunday, 
but, Keith said Tuesday: "He's all right. Knowing him, he'll be back riding in 
two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
If anyone knows Kent, it's Keith. They grew up together -- and with horses, of 
course -- in Maurice, La., the two oldest of Harris and Brenda Desormeaux's six 
children. 
</P>
<P>
When Kent came to Maryland in late 1986, Keith was enrolled at Louisiana Tech. 
Kent went on to stardom and three national riding championships. Keith 
graduated with a degree in animal science, with a specialty in equine studies, 
in the fall of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Keith has worked toward becoming a trainer. For the past year, he 
was an assistant trainer for Charlie Hadry -- who gave Kent the mount on his 
record-breaking 547th inner, Gilten, last November -- before he took out his 
trainer's license two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
In his shedrow this week, there was a 2-year-old that he trains for an older 
gentleman he met at school. There was a claiming horse owned by his father, who 
is back home in Maurice. And there are five 2-year-olds en route, all of them 
owned by Nick Bassford, whose horses race under the silks of his wife, Elaine. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't sleep the first night after Mr. Bassford told me he was giving me 
these horses," Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what this game is all about -- people giving you a shot," he said. 
"Sure, the name helps. But there's a lot more to it than that. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to say that getting my education has been a big help for me. A lot 
of people told me that I wouldn't need it, that I had my name and a few other 
things that would help me make it in this game. 
</P>
<P>
"But I finished my education. I've got the formal skills that I think you need 
to talk to owners and other people. I've got knowledge not only about horses, 
but a lot of other things, and that's important. I'd like to hope it's one of 
the reasons Mr. Bassford is sending me these horses." 
</P>
<P>
Bassford is a well-known local owner who also has horses with King Leatherbury 
and Carlos Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-year-old owned by his Louisiana Tech friend -- Earl Levine of Plano, 
Texas, took classes "just for the learning experience," Keith said -- was 
bought at a recent sale at Timonium for $13,000. The colt is by the prominent 
sire Raise A Native out of a graded stakes-winning mare. 
</P>
<P>
Keith trained horses at Louisiana Downs in Shreveport, La., in the summer of 
his senior year. Until now, it is the only time he has run horses in his name. 
</P>
<P>
"I won with my first starter," he said. "Spy Cliff. He was 25 to 1. Paid like 
$50. I won one other race with him and had some seconds and thirds with some 
babies (2-year-olds) I broke myself." 
</P>
<P>
When asked to pose for a picture, Keith was reluctant. "I'm the same as Kent, 
before Kent became famous. He had to learn how to become congenial and get used 
to all the cameras. Me, I'm shy. I don't really like being in the public eye."

ANOTHER DYNASTY TAKES SHAPE AT UCLA; 
</P>
<P>
SOFTBALL: BRUINS HAVE WON THREE NCAA TITLES IN A ROW AND SIX OF NINE OVERALL 
UNDER COACH SHARRON BACKUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several players on the UCLA women's softball team were talking to a reporter 
when Coach Sharron Backus came in. 
</P>
<P>
"Sharron, open the candy drawer," a player said. 
</P>
<P>
Obligingly, Backus unlocked a large cabinet holding enough candy to keep a 
dentist drilling forever. 
</P>
<P>
The players' eyes lit up as they dug in. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a bad day, you can come in here and eat Sharron's candy and she 
makes you feel good," said pitcher-infielder Lisa Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for everyone's teeth, the Bruins haven't had many bad days 
recently. In fact, they just recently won their third straight NCAA title and 
have compiled a 162-19 record in those three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
When you talk about UCLA dynasties, you start with John Wooden, who coached the 
men's basketball team to 10 NCAA basketball titles. But Backus has built a 
dynasty of her own. Her teams have won six of the nine NCAA softball 
tournaments that have been awarded. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, her Bruins have won seven national titles, been second twice and 
third twice in Backus' 15 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins' success, of course, has created some resentment among opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's UCLA against everyone else," said Yvonne Gutierrez, Bruin outfielder. "We 
make everyone mad. But they're just jealous. Everyone would die to be in our 
position." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA extended its dynasty by defeating Fresno State in a rain-delayed game at 
Oklahoma City Memorial Day for the 1990 title. 
</P>
<P>
With the Bruins leading 1-0, play had been halted in the third inning the 
previous day. Pitcher Heather Compton picked up where she had left off, giving 
up one hit and striking out five as UCLA completed the game, a 2-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tough because you had to warm up all over again and prepare yourself 
all over again," Compton said. "It was like those first three innings didn't 
count. It was really hard for me to go to bed that night and sleep on it." 
</P>
<P>
A freshman, Compton won two games in the six-game NCAA World Series. One of the 
aces of a superb Bruin pitching staff, she compiled an 18-1 record with a 0.36 
earned-run average and 13 shutouts this season. 
</P>
<P>
As a whole, the staff had a 0.42 ERA and recorded 45 shutouts in 68 games as 
UCLA set a school record by winning 61 games. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Lisa Longaker, the Pac-10 player of the year in 1988 and 1989, led the 
staff with a 20-2 record. She had a team-high 131 strikeouts and compiled a 
0.40 ERA. Longaker picked up a win and a save in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
In four years at UCLA, Longaker compiled an 89-12 record and was voted the 
Honda Trophy, awarded the nation's top woman softball player, in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Freshmen DeDe Weiman and Fernandez also had strong seasons. Weiman had a 13-3 
record with 11 shutouts, 112 strikeouts and a 0.64 ERA, and Fernandez was 11-1 
with eight shutouts and a team-low 0.25 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"Having four good pitchers helped to pull us together, (although) everyone 
thought it would pull us apart," Fernandez said. "It helps to have a variety of 
pitchers because we throw different pitches." 
</P>
<P>
Longaker, whose best pitch is her riseball, has excellent control and can work 
in and out of the strike zone. The hardest thrower on the staff, Compton 
attacks hitters. Weiman's best pitch is the riseball, which results in fly 
outs, and Fernandez's best is her dropball, which produces ground outs. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA didn't stop with excellent pitching, though. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez led the team in hitting with a .384 batting average and 28 RBIs. 
Voted to the all-tournament team, she drove in two runs in each of the Bruins' 
first two World Series wins. 
</P>
<P>
"A different player came through in the clutch in every game," Gutierrez said. 
"Everyone contributes." 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, who also played third base, had a .310 average with 22 RBIs. She 
went three for three with a homer and two RBIs as UCLA beat Florida State in a 
semifinal game, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Shanna Flynn and first baseman Kerry Dienelt also hit better than 
.300. Flynn batted .307 with 13 RBIs, Dienelt .304 with 18 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
A junior from Darwin, Australia, Dienelt has won three NCAA titles in her three 
seasons at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what it feels like to lose," Dienelt said. "The first title was 
the most satisfying because it wasn't obvious we were going to win it. We'd 
finished second the year before. Last year we were expected to win because we 
were ranked No. 1 all season." 
</P>
<P>
Although she has since built the Bruins into the nation's most successful 
softball team, UCLA struggled when Backus arrived in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"People wanted to beat us badly in our formative years and we weren't very 
good," she said. "We lost some ballgames early in my career, 18-0 and 15-0. 
Everyone got up for us without knowing anything about us. They didn't care if 
we could walk straight. 
</P>
<P>
"But it was a good lesson for me. I learned that I had to get some ballplayers 
in here." 
</P>
<P>
Hampered by a small budget, UCLA played its games at city parks, where they 
were often bumped from fields by recreational softball leagues. 
</P>
<P>
The team moved its games to the UCLA intramural field, then got its own field 
10 years ago in Brentwood, on land that had been used as a heliport for school 
officials. Brentwood residents have put severe restrictions on the site, 
though, so Backus has plans for a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
After compiling a 44-20 record in Backus' first three seasons, UCLA won its 
first national title in 1978, compiling a 31-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other teams, who wore knickers, the Bruins wore shorts, creating a bit 
of a controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first started, we were the underdogs," said Sue Enquist, who played 
center field on the 1978 team. "We were that funny little team in shorts." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating in 1979, Enquist was hired as an assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Sue's one of the most talented kids I've ever had," Backus said. "She had a 
drive and a desire. You can't beat Sue. She'll bite your arm and your leg off. 
And I wouldn't let her go." 
</P>
<P>
When Enquist received offers from several other schools, UCLA gave her a raise 
and named her co-head coach last year. She said sheplans to remain at UCLA for 
the rest of her career. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first six years, my loyalty was here," she said. "But then you reach 
as point in your life where you realize that loyalties are only going to take 
you so far in paying the bills. But now, I'm here for good." 
</P>
<P>
Backus, Enquist, who has been designated Backus' eventual successor, and 
pitching coach Kirk Walker complement one another. 
</P>
<P>
"Sharron's the mother, Sue's the aunt and Kirk is the big brother," Gutierrez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Backus gets stage fright at even the thought of public speaking, 
Enquist is outgoing and represents UCLA at clinics and dinners. Enquist also 
serves as a buffer between the team and Backus. 
</P>
<P>
Although Backus is the winningest coach in women's softball with a 560-128-3 
record, she's reluctant to take credit for UCLA's success. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people misread her because she's really shy," Enquist said. "She 
won't tell you how great her players are or that she's the winningest coach in 
women's softball." 
</P>
<P>
When she takes over the program, will Enquist feel like the coaches who 
followed Wooden? 
</P>
<P>
"Sure there will be pressure," she said. "But I feel like I've been a part of 
the program from the beginning. If you're going to go into any successful 
program, wouldn't it be good to go into one that you know so much about?"

PHILLIES' VATCHER SAVORS MAJOR PROMOTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was just a dinky hit, but for Jim Vatcher, Friday's single took on enormous 
proportions because it was his first hit in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Vatcher, a 5-foot-9 Philadelphia Phillie outfielder from Cal State Northridge, 
faced Dean Wilkins of the Chicago Cubs with two out in the eighth inning. 
Vatcher topped a forkball and the ball trickled down the third-base line as 
Vatcher dashed to first. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget running down the line at Wrigley Field in the sun," Vatcher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The game was stopped and Vatcher was given the baseball. Philadelphia trailed, 
15-1, at the time, which muted the celebration. But Vatcher is savoring every 
major league moment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm holding on day to day," said Vatcher, who also delivered a pinch-hit 
single Saturday. "I'm incredibly fortunate to be here this early in the season. 
I'm pumped." 
</P>
<P>
On May 28, Vatcher was playing left field and batting a ho-hum .260 for the 
Phillies' triple-A team in Scranton-Wilkes Barre, Pa. Manager Bill Terlecky 
told Vatcher that he wouldn't be in the lineup that night and to meet him in 
his office. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what to expect," Vatcher recalled. "He said, 'You're going to 
the Phillies tomorrow.' I was like, 'Wow.' I was speechless." 
</P>
<P>
Since being called up, he had been hitless until Friday. All six of his 
appearances have been as a pinch-hitter, although twice he has remained in the 
game as an outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
He vividly recalls every detail of the first four at-bats, the way a pilot 
remembers his first flight. 
</P>
<P>
At-bat No. 1: Vatcher leads off the fifth against San Diego Padre right-hander 
Andy Benes. "Not much of a pressure situation except for being my first 
big-league at-bat," Vatcher said. "I thought I'd be a lot more nervous. You get 
kind of locked in with the pitcher and don't really realize where you're at." 
</P>
<P>
Vatcher redirects a 2-2 pitch to right field. For Vatcher, it's that 
unforgettable first major league at-bat. But for right fielder Tony Gwynn, it's 
just another easy fly ball. 
</P>
<P>
At-bat No. 2: With Darren Daulton on first and none out in the eighth, Vatcher 
bats against New York Met left-hander Frank Viola. "Daulton walked on all 
fastballs and I was stupid to think he'd throw fastballs to me," Vatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Viola throws a first-pitch changeup, Vatcher lunges and bounces into a double 
play. 
</P>
<P>
At-bat No. 3: St. Louis Cardinal left-hander John Tudor has made a career of 
getting hitters to swing at pitches low and away. Vatcher lays off 'em and 
draws a walk. 
</P>
<P>
At-bat No. 4: With runners on first and second and Cardinal left-hander Ken 
Dayley on the mound, Vatcher watches a fastball right down the middle for 
strike one. "I figured, 'Well, I'm gonna look at one.' It was the best pitch 
I've seen yet," Vatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
He also looks at strike two and strikes out swinging at a high curve. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, I've got a pretty good eye and I wait for my pitch," he said. "But 
when I'm pinch-hitting, if I get a fastball anywhere near, I'm hacking." 
</P>
<P>
There is no time to waste. Phillie outfielder Carmelo Martinez is scheduled to 
come off the disabled list Wednesday, which could signal a return to the minors 
for Vatcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not thinking about when I'm going back," he said. "The big leagues are 
unbelievable. They take care of you so well. You get spoiled in a hurry, I'll 
tell you." 
</P>
<P>
Hard to take: Steve Dailey knows what it's like to come up short, and it has 
nothing to do with his stature. 
</P>
<P>
Dailey, Oklahoma State's left fielder and a former two-sport standout at 
Ventura High, took a called third strike Saturday to end the College World 
Series. Georgia defeated the Cowboys, 2-1, for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
But if history is true to form, Dailey, a sophomore, will get a chance at 
redemption. Oklahoma State has qualified for the series eight times in the past 
11 years but has yet to win the title. 
</P>
<P>
Add CWS: Cal State Fullerton, which made a quick exit from the series, had 
three area players -- Steve Sisco, Kevin Farlow and Frank Charles -- in its 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Sisco, a sophomore infielder from Thousand Oaks High, was Fullerton's regular 
first baseman despite standing only 5-9. Sisco, however, holds a winning hand 
in low ball. "In our key regional win against Texas, he picked three throws in 
the dirt," Coach Larry Cochell said. 
</P>
<P>
Sisco, who batted .294 with 32 runs batted in this season, has broken a mold 
before. As a senior shortstop at Thousand Oaks, he batted leadoff and set a 
school record with nine home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Across the infield from Sisco, at shortstop, was Farlow, a former All-City 
Section player at Kennedy High. 
</P>
<P>
Farlow, a 6-4 senior, transferred from USC last summer and solidified the Titan 
defense. He also batted .284 with 32 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"He worked out great for us," Cochell said. 
</P>
<P>
Charles, a transfer from Pepperdine who played at Montclair Prep, is a catcher 
and designated-hitter who batted .330 with 43 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"All three of those guys are the type I want on my club," Cochell said. "After 
coaching 24 years, I am interested in being around good citizens. Kevin, Steve 
and Frank fit the mold exactly."

CSUN'S DIVISION I DEBUT AT COLORADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Northridge has set its 1990-91 men's basketball schedule, one that 
includes 10 games against teams from the Big Sky Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge will begin its first season of competition as an NCAA Division I 
independent with three road games in four days. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors, 12-15 against a Division II schedule last season, will open at 
Colorado of the Big Eight Conference on Nov. 23. Northridge will finish its 
trip against two NCAA tournament teams -- Colorado State on Nov. 24 and New 
Mexico State on Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge will make its home debut Dec. 1 against Northern Arizona, which is 
among the seven Big Sky teams on the Matador schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Games at Cal State Long Beach (Dec. 12), at USC (Feb. 4) and at Cal (March 6) 
are other contests of note. 
</P>
<P>
A tentative schedule for next season that was included in Northridge's 1989-90 
basketball media guide included games against the likes of Dayton, Xavier and 
Wyoming. Those schools later removed Northridge from their schedules for a 
variety of reasons, Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy said. MIKE HISERMAN

SHARTS FAMILY TRADITION CONTINUING AT CSUN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Another power hitter named Sharts plans to enroll at Cal State Northridge in 
the fall, but opposing baseball coaches need not fret. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart Sharts is the twin of Scott, CSUN's All-American first baseman, but the 
two do not share a passion for the same sports. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart's games are golf and tennis. And although trying out for the school's 
golf team is not in his plans, Stuart will continue what has become a Sharts 
family tradition simply by attending CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
Brad and Dagne Sharts have five children, all of whom have grown up in Simi 
Valley and matriculated to Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Steve, 26, was the first. A pitcher on CSUN's Division II champion baseball 
team of 1984, Steve later was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies on the 
17th-round of the amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
For the past six years, Steve, a left-hander, has steadily climbed the minor 
league ladder to his role as a reliever for the Phillies' Scranton-Wilkes-Barre 
triple-A affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
Shannon, 23, was next. She was a cheerleader at CSUN for one year and graduated 
last year with a degree in psychology. Stacy, 21, was a cheerleader for two 
years and is on schedule to graduate from CSUN next spring. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, 20, broke the chain in 1988 by accepting a baseball scholarship from the 
University of Miami, but that situation was only temporary. 
</P>
<P>
The scholarship was only partial and at the rate Miami's tuition was rising, 
the Sharts family was looking at a bill of more than $10,000 for Scott's 
sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
Already frustrated by his lack of playing time, Scott decided to transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Every school in the Southland with a Division I baseball program supposedly was 
in the running. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, with a year left in Division II, won out. There were many reasons, 
family history among them. 
</P>
<P>
"The support has always been there for me," Scott said. "You miss that when 
you're 3,000 miles away. There's no one in the stands rooting for you." 
</P>
<P>
Dagne Sharts says her son's decision to return home was strictly financial. "If 
it had been a full-ride (scholarship), I think he would have stuck it out," she 
said. "Scott's not the kind to quit something when things don't go his way." 
</P>
<P>
Still, she says, "the entire family was thrilled" when Scott decided to attend 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The scholarship Sharts accepted was awarded in the name of the late Paul 
Edmonson, Dagne's brother. 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, Edmonson was an all-district pitcher for what was then known as San 
Fernando Valley State. That June he was taken by the Chicago White Sox in the 
amateur draft and he went on to become the first Matador player to make it to 
the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
When Edmonson was killed in a car accident in the 1970s, the White Sox helped 
establish an endowment for a permanent scholarship in his name. 
</P>
<P>
Scott probably will follow the path of his uncle and brother before him. The 
6-foot-6 sophomore batted better than .300 this spring, led Division II players 
with a school-record 29 home runs and was a first-team All-American. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart, who grew up in the formidable shadow of his brothers, somehow learned 
how to survive without baseball. 
</P>
<P>
That fact alone, Brad Sharts says, is quite an accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
Scott agrees. "I'm really proud of Stuart," he said. "He's gone out, kind of 
done his own thing, and found his own way." 
</P>
<P>
And yet he ended up at Northridge, where he likely will enroll in the same 
accounting and economics classes as his twin. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously a very comfortable setting for us," Brad Sharts said. "I just 
wish it was possible to live on campus. . . . We've put a lot of miles on the 
freeway between here and Reseda Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
Idle thoughts: Every time the thought crops up about what it will be like for 
Northridge to play men's basketball against USC on Feb. 4 at the Sports Arena, 
I wonder who will draw the assignment of guarding Harold Miner. 
</P>
<P>
Ditto for when the Matadors travel to Cal on March 6. Who is going to (attempt 
to) guard Bryan Hendrick? 
</P>
<P>
Two-liners: Dorian Manigo, Northridge's top freshman basketball recruit, will 
play for the North squad in a state all-star game June 24 at UC Irvine's Bren 
Center. Manigo, a guard, helped San Francisco Riordan High reach the state 
large schools' championship game. . .Joel Wolfe, a former Chatsworth High 
standout, was the top hitter on UCLA's baseball team this season. Wolfe, who 
had 31 hits in his last 63 regular-season at-bats, finished with a .376 
average, 10 home runs, 44 runs batted in and a team-high 30 stolen bases.

<P>
Mira Costa High senior David Swatik, who led the Mustangs to the Southern 
Section 4-A Division volleyball title and a 22-0 season, has been chosen 4-A 
most valuable player by the division's coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Swatik, a 6-foot-4 outside hitter bound for UCLA, headed six Mira Costa players 
selected to the 4-A squad. 
</P>
<P>
Setter Canyon Ceman and middle blockers Pat Ivie and Mike Ashenfelter were 
named to the first team, outside hitter Mark Shoptaw was a second-team choice, 
and setter Brian Thurston was picked for the third team. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa Coach Mike Cook said it was the first time a team's entire starting 
lineup was selected All-Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tribute to a team that went 77-2 in games," Cook said. "We've became a 
team that other teams can measure themselves by." 
</P>
<P>
Swatik is the second Mira Costa boys' volleyball player to be selected Southern 
Section MVP. Setter Jason McFarland was MVP in 1984, the year the Mustangs won 
the 4-A title, also with a 22-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
Called the top prep player in the nation by Volleyball Monthly, Swatik led the 
Mustangs in kills and was at his best in Mira Costa's 15-6, 15-12, 15-11 
victory over Edison of Huntington Beach in the 4-A final May 26. He led the 
team in kills, digs and service points and was second in blocks. 
</P>
<P>
Another South Bay player named to the 4-A squad was Rolling Hills setter Ross 
Pier, a second-team choice. 
</P>
<P>
Two players for Olympic League champion Miraleste were selected to the 2-A 
Division squad. Brian Johnston was named to the first team, while Mark Mayeda 
earned second-team honors. ROB FERNAS

BELEAGUERED MCDONNELL BETS ON A NEW JET; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: THE COMPANY NEEDS FAST FEDERAL APPROVAL FOR ITS BIG NEW AIRLINER. 
MCDONNELL'S LONG-TERM HEALTH -- AND U.S. SUPREMACY IN THE INDUSTRY -- MAY HANG 
IN THE BALANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At a scorching test site in the Sonoran Desert, a team of 500 McDonnell Douglas 
employees is racing to obtain government certification of the new MD-11 
jetliner before their company runs out of time -- and money. 
</P>
<P>
The mostly young engineers, technicians and pilots at the site near Yuma, 
Ariz., are working around the clock in two 12-hour shifts, flight-testing four 
of the jumbo aircraft. It is one of the fastest-paced certification programs in 
industry history. And the future of the MD-11 program -- perhaps even the 
health of the St. Louis-based corporation -- is tied to their success. 
</P>
<P>
By the company's account, it will come close to its goal of getting the MD-11 
certified by the end of October and capture $350 million of badly needed cash 
this year. If so, that will be some rare good news for the firm's Douglas 
Aircraft unit in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The company remains plagued by a whole range of financial and operational 
problems that have led to major losses, tardy deliveries of aircraft to 
customers, extensive layoffs and sagging morale. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the highly leveraged and risky MD-11 program on the commercial side, 
Douglas is confronting an uncertain future with its Air Force C-17 cargo jet 
program, which carries enormous financial perils. Company officials disclosed 
last week in interviews that a major cost review now under way could create new 
cash difficulties later this year. 
</P>
<P>
So great are Douglas' problems that the company's executives have had to 
struggle to assure workers and outside observers that they are not close to 
writing off the commercial aircraft business and shuttering Douglas, which 
employs 40,500 workers in Long Beach and Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, in a long-term sense the company is very much in a struggle for 
its survival. Just last year, it slipped from its No. 2 world ranking as a 
producer of commercial jet aircraft when Airbus Industrie delivered more 
aircraft seats. 
</P>
<P>
The continued existence of Douglas Aircraft is critical to the United States' 
position as the international leader of aerospace. Company officials insist 
that they are committed to the challenge. Indeed, they have invested a fortune 
in it. And that's why, right now, so much is riding on what's happening in the 
dusty Arizona desert. 
</P>
<P>
So far, McDonnell officials said, the MD-11 flight test program is ahead of 
schedule in demonstrating the aircraft's flying capabilities, but somewhat 
behind schedule in testing the tricky avionics -- or advanced electronics -- 
system in the highly computerized cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
If the company meets the Oct. 31 certification goal, delivers the five planes 
and earns the $350 million, it would abate the ferocious growth in McDonnell's 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
"We will obtain certification by then," asserted Joe Ornelas, the affable MD-11 
flight test manager in Yuma. "The question is whether we will have some loose 
ends. That is a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
By "loose ends," Ornelas did not mean parts of the airplane but capabilities 
that do not require immediate certification and will not prevent deliveries to 
airlines. At McDonnell Douglas' St. Louis headquarters, however, executives are 
exercising more caution. 
</P>
<P>
A recently negotiated bank loan agreement has enough flexibility so that the 
company will not face a liquidity crisis under even "the most Draconian 
scenario," said Herbert J. Lanese, senior vice president and chief financial 
officer. By Lanese's handicapping, the firm has a 50% chance of getting the 
MD-11 certified by Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a recent letter to employees by McDonnell Chairman John F. McDonnell 
raised eyebrows when he said the MD-11 certification program was "essentially" 
going well "except for the avionics." It appeared that he was laying groundwork 
for the later disclosure of new problems. 
</P>
<P>
Certification by Oct. 31 "is important, but not critical," Lanese said. He 
added: "If you look at what I'd consider to be a Draconian scenario, you 
wouldn't get certification until March. . . . That could require an increase of 
$1.2 billion in our debt." 
</P>
<P>
He said only "a very severe problem . . . would force us into a certification 
that late." With certification on Oct. 31, however, debt would grow by just 
$400 million to $450 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A new credit agreement with its lending consortium allows McDonnell to increase 
its debt in 1992 to a level 15% greater than the sum of its shareholder equity, 
preferred stock and subordinated debt. Current equity is $3.3 billion; the firm 
has no preferred stock or subordinated debt but is likely to issue some in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"We not only can survive the worst-case scenario, we've provided financial 
flexibility over and above the worst case for us," Lanese said. 
</P>
<P>
A little flexibility may be a good thing. The Douglas Aircraft unit alone 
posted a pretax loss of $222 million on revenue of $4.7 billion last year, and 
sustained a further loss of $84 million on sales of $1.1 billion in the first 
quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Aerospace analyst Paul Nisbet of Prudential Bache Securities, who considers 
himself an optimist on McDonnell Douglas, estimates that the Douglas unit will 
lose $94 million on sales of $5.3 billion in all of 1990. Paine Webber 
aerospace analyst Phil Friedman has projected a $125-million loss at Douglas 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
A massive management reorganization last year, in which every one of the more 
than 5,000 executives were forced to reapply for their jobs, deeply wounded 
morale. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Douglas is laying off 4,000 workers and eliminating 3,000 jobs that 
were assigned to temporary "contract" workers. Those cutbacks have further 
raised the anxiety of the work force. 
</P>
<P>
"What does it tell you about the company if they suddenly discover that they 
have 7,000 too many workers?" one aeronautics expert said. "Usually, companies 
have layoffs when they have a declining work load, but Douglas is having 
cutbacks when they are facing an increasing work load." 
</P>
<P>
The firm is behind schedule on all of its major aircraft development programs 
-- the MD-11, the C-17 and the Navy's T-45 jet trainer. The huge workload is 
straining management resources. 
</P>
<P>
The MD-80, an aircraft that has been produced in its current and earlier forms 
for several decades, should be a cash cow for the company. Instead, it is 
another headache. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Douglas forfeited $20 million to commercial customers because of 
late delivery penalties, according to internal sources. About 24% of MD-80 
deliveries were late. 
</P>
<P>
The most significant problem has been production of the aircraft's nose 
section, which paces production of the total aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas has had persistent problems meeting the production schedule of 2.5 nose 
sections a week. Just last week, it was forced to mate the fuselage and wing 
assemblies of several MD-80s before the noses were attached to the fuselages -- 
an extreme measure to keep the production line moving. 
</P>
<P>
To remedy the nose shortages, Douglas officials are setting up a second nose 
production line at the large McDonnell Astronautics facility in Huntington 
Beach. That line will produce one nose a week, while the Long Beach line builds 
up to three noses per week. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of Douglas' problems has made workers nervous, and the company's 
handling of the layoffs didn't help. Some workers were escorted off the 
property by security officers within hours of the notification. 
</P>
<P>
Among the remaining employees, there is persistent speculation that Douglas 
will close. One Douglas scientist said recently in an interview that he is 
involved in an effort to develop a contingency plan for such a shutdown in his 
area, but it is not clear what magnitude of financial crisis would trigger such 
a contingency plan. 
</P>
<P>
A catastrophic shutdown of Douglas, while not impossible if McDonnell were to 
face an overwhelming financial crisis, is clearly not what the parent company 
has been preparing for in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
In each of the last three years, McDonnell's biggest investments in property, 
plant and equipment have been in its transport aircraft sector -- Douglas. Last 
year, it in vested $213 million at Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
Senior executives said recently that the future of McDonnell is Douglas, 
because it provides the balance that will carry the military side of company 
through future declines in the Pentagon budget. 
</P>
<P>
But its position in commercial aircraft "has been, for many years, the weaker 
side of our business," according to Chairman McDonnell's letter to shareholders 
in the firm's recent annual report. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, as Douglas slipped behind Airbus for the first time, its share of the 
world market for large commercial jets fell below 20%. Boeing is No. 1, with 
about 60%. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, on one side Douglas faces the Boeing juggernaut, which boasts a full line 
of aircraft, a reputation for excellence and a cash hoard of $1.2 billion. On 
the other side is the Airbus consortium, subsidized by the governments of 
France, Britain and West Germany and intent on developing its own full line of 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Even if all turns out well for Douglas' commercial programs, McDonnell Douglas 
is not out of the financial woods. The Long Beach operation is also contending 
with yet another high-risk, multibillion-dollar program in the C-17. 
Development of the big cargo jet is more than a year behind schedule, and 
McDonnell's spending on the project has risen to its $4.9-billion ceiling, 
beyond which the company will have to absorb all the overruns as a loss. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force, meanwhile, is conducting a formal "estimate at completion" -- or 
EAC -- on the C-17, an effort to determine how much money it will cost the 
company to complete the contract, Lanese disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
An EAC is a projection of the cost of building the airplane and completing the 
contract, an analysis that is periodically done on all major military programs. 
</P>
<P>
The danger is that the Air Force will conclude that C-17 production costs have 
further increased. That would mean McDonnell Douglas has booked too much profit 
so far and would have to take a charge against earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Even worse, if the C-17 costs increase, the Air Force would also conclude that 
it has been making progress payments to Douglas too fast for the amount of work 
it has accomplished. That could mean a reduction of contract progress payments 
-- not what McDonnell needs in its current cash shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Lanese said the company has begun conducting its own EAC. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it was just prudent for us to go through a pretty comprehensive 
look at our own program again," he said. "When you're in a full-scale 
development program, there's a certain amount of risk. And that's why we're 
sensitive to making sure that when we do our EACs, we do a pretty thorough job 
of understanding just what our risk and exposure is." 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether McDonnell could handle a lengthy delay in MD-11 
certification and a sharp drop in Air Force payments on the C-17, each of which 
might be catastrophic alone. 
</P>
<P>
The magnitude of any possible drop in C-17 progress payments is a complete 
unknown. The recent annual report contained a financial footnote, however, 
warning that an increase in the EAC "would have a substantial adverse impact on 
future earnings." 
</P>
<P>
Lanese said there is a possibility that the EAC will show the C-17 to be 
further along than expected. But some Douglas sources say the aircraft is not 
progressing nearly as fast as it should to meet its scheduled first flight date 
in June, 1991. Just recently, the tail section was attached to the first 
aircraft, meaning that a substantial amount of structural, electronic and 
hydraulic work lies ahead before even ground testing can begin. 
</P>
<P>
The picture is further complicated by the recent recommendation of Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney to reduce future purchases of C-17s from 210 to 120, and 
to cut the peak rate of production to 24 planes a year from 29. 
</P>
<P>
That recommended cutback, Lanese said, could provide a basis for a claim 
against the government. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are going to cut the number of planes that are now part of that 
program, it affects not only our return on investment but the rest of the 
commitment on the program. And I think there's probably a pretty good case for 
why we, as a contractor, would expect some kind of relief on that," he said. 
"We're going to have to talk to our customer (the Air Force) and see what can 
be negotiated." 
</P>
<P>
All the risks and unknowns on the C-17 make success in the MD-11 program all 
the more important. And it has the potential to help turn around Douglas. It is 
a big airplane with a gross takeoff weight of 605,500 pounds and a price tag of 
more than $100 million each. Big planes can produce big profits. 
</P>
<P>
The MD-11 has sold well. Douglas has various types of customer commitments for 
371 of them, including firm orders for 144. Douglas hopes to earn a profit 
making the MD-11, something it never did on the DC-10. The MD-11 is a 
derivative of the veteran DC-10, a three-engine jumbo jet. 
</P>
<P>
"The program, from our standpoint, is going very well," said Frederick Lee, 
chief of the FAA's certification office in Long Beach. "I haven't heard any 
complaints from our pilots." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that Douglas will not face a certification crisis on the 
MD-11. "The probability that the aircraft will not be certified by next year is 
very low," said Tassos Phillippakos, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service, 
which recently downgraded its ratings on McDonnell Douglas debt. "If I were to 
take a bet, I think there is a high probability that the MD-11 will be 
certified by March, 1991." 
</P>
<P>
On a recent day when temperatures soared to 112 degrees at Yuma, spirits were 
remarkably high. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no show-stoppers" that would seriously delay the program, said John 
I. Miller, Douglas' chief of flight operations on the MD-11. He said the 
aircraft handles better than the DC-10 and recently came through stall tests 
without requiring aerodynamic tuning. 
</P>
<P>
As for the avionics problems, flight test manager Ornelas first said, "It is 
not serious." But, he added, "It is something that is a major challenge to us. 
It is something that is going to keep us busy right up to certification." 
</P>
<P>
Avionics, particularly avionics software, have caused some of the toughest 
problems for aircraft makers in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas has subcontracted the job of integrating the MD-11's avionics system to 
Honeywell, which is providing Douglas with badly needed help when problems 
develop, Ornelas said. 
</P>
<P>
The two-pilot cockpit of the MD-11 may be the most automated in the industry, 
featuring seven computers that automatically handle a range of mundane tasks 
which consume a pilot's attention on other aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the DC-10 has 28 switches that must be activated to dump fuel in 
an emergency, a task that must be performed at the same time the crew is trying 
to deal with the cause of the emergency and fly the airplane. In the MD-11, 
pressing a single button will purge the fuel tanks down to the maximum landing 
weight, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going for the lowest pilot workload in the industry, and I think with 
this system we will achieve it," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas has lots of problems, but climate hasn't been one. The monotonously 
hot, dry days this year have forced few flight cancellations. 
</P>
<P>
"Good weather in the bag," Ornelas said, "is money in the bank."

JAMES FLANIGAN: ROBERT NOYCE OR IVAN BOESKY? THE CHOICE IS REALLY OURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Bob Noyce changed your life." 
</P>
<P>
That's how an electronics industry executive summed up the contribution of 
Robert N. Noyce -- inventor of the integrated circuit, founder of Intel Corp. 
and pioneer of the industrial phenomenon known as Silicon Valley -- who died a 
week ago. Noyce, who was chairman of the government-industry electronics 
consortium Sematech when he died of a heart attack at 62, exemplified enduring 
values in American business -- and also reflected its current difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
He stood in healthy contrast to the false prophets who dominated business news 
in the last decade -- the likes of Ivan "Greed is Good" Boesky, Henry Kravis, 
Michael Milken, T. Boone Pickens and Donald Trump -- as well as corporate 
chieftains who took millions in salary and bonuses but delivered competitive 
failure. It was a decade not of sowers but of reapers. 
</P>
<P>
Noyce, by contrast, was a builder. A graduate of Iowa's Grinnell College and 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he devised a way to cluster 
electrical circuits on a wafer of silicon and thereby made possible small 
computers, moon landings, automatic bank tellers, microwave ovens and a 
thousand other transformations of our daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he pioneered the modern entrepreneurial company. Noyce founded 
Fairchild Semiconductor in 1958 -- when he was 30 -- and Intel in 1968. He 
strove for a new kind of company based on individual effort rather than 
corporate hierarchy. He called the process "empowering from below," and it 
proved fruitful. Intel people developed the dynamic random access memory or 
D-RAM, the most widely used microchip, and the microprocessor, or computer on a 
chip. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s and '70s, the Intel example inspired a wave of technological 
start-ups, attracting venture capital to the personal computer industry, and 
beyond to biotechnology and other frontiers. 
</P>
<P>
Noyce, the son and grandson of Congregational ministers, showed that the best 
career choice was to follow your dream. 
</P>
<P>
But there's more to Noyce's legacy than past glories. Noyce also reflects the 
challenge of global competition and poses the question, as he himself put it, 
"of whether the U.S. financial system is suited to the development of advanced 
technology to create the industries of the future." 
</P>
<P>
Intel was bloodied in the 1980s by an assault on the memory chip market by 
Japanese firms dumping low-priced chips to drive U.S. competitors from the 
field. "The Japanese semiconductor industry blew $4 billion to get the D-RAM 
business; we (the U.S. industry) blew $2 billion and gave up," said Noyce. 
</P>
<P>
Intel was kept alive in 1983 by a $350-million investment from IBM -- which 
Intel, now a $3-billion-sales company, later repaid. 
</P>
<P>
But Noyce saw that the global market was a fight among nations more than 
companies, and so he sought help for his industry in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
For awhile he got results -- the Reagan Administration stopped Japanese dumping 
with the semiconductor agreement of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
However the Bush Administration lately turned cold to his ideas, holding that 
market forces alone should decide the fate of U.S. companies. Government 
shouldn't interfere. It's an attitude colored by years of government assistance 
to the car and steel industries that has done little to benefit U.S. workers or 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
But it's a mistaken attitude on advanced technology, says Alan Patricof, head 
of a leading venture capital firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Government has to seed technology because start-up costs are high, the payoff 
is five years or more and capital isn't coming forward," says Patricof. 
</P>
<P>
So there's a standoff, with neither government nor markets aiding U.S. 
technology. Meanwhile, future jobs, opportunities and U.S. living standards are 
left hanging in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Noyce showed a way for government and industry to work together, with 
Sematech, the 14-company consortium set up with a $200 million annual budget to 
develop manufacturing techniques for advanced semiconductors. Sematech develops 
know-how that can then be distributed to U.S. industry -- a pattern familiar in 
Japan, where consortiums are widely used. 
</P>
<P>
The point, of course, is to keep firms working and technology developing in the 
United States -- because if companies drop out, know-how fades and the nation 
forfeits further development. U.S. makers gave up on television sets, and lost 
the videocassette recorder. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Bush Administration says no seed money will be given to high-definition 
television. That's unfortunate, says one expert, "because it's abdicating 
spinoff products for the next decade." 
</P>
<P>
What is being abdicated, as Noyce knew, is the profit -- both in money and 
opportunity -- that comes from innovation. In money alone, Noyce's Intel 
returned 50 times its original investment to early investors, such as his alma 
mater, Grinnell College. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the market didn't do it alone. Seed money for Noyce's early developments 
came from the Gemini and Apollo space programs. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is, left to itself the market's forces are as likely to give you an 
Ivan Boesky as a Bob Noyce. If you want to control your own destiny, you have 
to make choices.

TOWARD CREATIVITY IN JAPAN; 
</P>
<P>
TACTICS ARE VARIED, BUT AIM IS THE SAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Canon has built brainstorming rooms. Fujitsu has put up office partitions for 
privacy. Hitachi has cut cumbersome middle management. And Toshiba is turning 
to women. 
</P>
<P>
The ingredients differ, but each company is trying to concoct a recipe for the 
same thing: more creativity among researchers. 
</P>
<P>
Although Japan's private sector has doubled research spending in the past 
decade, executives say money isn't enough. The key, they say, is to create new 
kinds of conditions and policies that will liberate researchers, allowing them 
to pursue pioneering work. Given Japan's tradition of incremental improvements 
through consensus thinking, that is no small task. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly speaking, my biggest job is how to give a creative environment to our 
engineers," said Masaka Ogi, president of Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd. "Fujitsu is 
asking us to find breakthroughs in various areas. Japanese companies are now 
getting rich and can spend big money on R&amp;D, but it's not a problem of 
money. The most important thing is a good environment." 
</P>
<P>
How are Japanese firms pursuing innovation? Consider: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Canon: Meditation 
</P>
<P>
In Atsugi, 20 miles southwest of Tokyo, Canon Inc. has built what may be the 
nation's most futuristic basic research laboratory. The surrounding hills and 
trees inspire the mind, while the center's pastel decor soothes it. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, Canon supplies not one but two types of brainstorming rooms: Western 
and Japanese, lined in carpets or tatami, where researchers can stimulate group 
creativity. For working out problems in solitary contemplation, there are 
meditation rooms. The dining hall isn't called a cafeteria but a "communication 
plaza," and the curved "biotables" make it obvious why. Forget trying to slink 
to a solitary corner to wolf down lunch, because virtually anywhere you sit, 
someone will face you. 
</P>
<P>
"Creativity is very much rooted in the individual, so you have to give the 
individual freedom and time to think," said Hajime Mitarai, the senior managing 
director who built the lab five years ago. "But creativity is also associated 
with interacting with colleagues and stimulating each other. We try to do 
both." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers are required to report to the lab only from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. They 
build the rest of their schedule around their creative needs. They are given 
pocket beepers to shield them from having to answer telephone calls that aren't 
for them. The firm also grants employees as many as 10 "refresh holidays" a 
year, in addition to a new two-week summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
To diversify the firm's research against what Mitarai calls his "single-race 
country where everybody thinks the same way," Canon has opened a lab near 
London and plans to open one in California later this year. Next year, the firm 
will strike out in what Mitarai calls a "dramatically different direction." It 
will open a "Geocenter" in Kyoto for what it hopes will be groundbreaking 
environmental research into clean solar energy. In carrying out the research, 
it will use technologies, such as photovoltaic devices, related to its copier 
and camera business. 
</P>
<P>
"If we stay as just a manufacturer and exporter, nobody likes us," Mitarai 
said. "To be appreciated by people in the world, we have to become earth 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
When it established itself as a camera company in 1937, Canon was basically an 
"assembly company putting boxes together," Mitarai said. Components were from 
other sources. Then the company began producing not only its own components but 
also its own ground-breaking products: the world's first automatic camera, 
first commercially successful laser printer and first full-color laser copier. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we are putting more emphasis on what is in the box -- or, to put it in one 
phrase, materials research," Mitarai said. "We are looking at revolutionary 
functions out of new materials." 
</P>
<P>
Canon's technological evolution, reflective of that of many Japanese firms, has 
placed new demands on its researchers to plumb uncharted scientific territory. 
Today, seeking breakthroughs in such fields as biotechnology and 
superconductivity, Canon has doubled its research spending to 5.5% of its $9.4 
billion in annual sales last year from 2.6% in 1980. In the process, the firm, 
which sells cameras, business machines and other optical products, has become 
the third-largest recipient of U.S. patents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Toshiba: Not a Male Club 
</P>
<P>
Toshiba has also opened an advanced lab and adopted other research-enhancing 
measures. But it may boast the most intriguing research-productivity tool of 
all: women. 
</P>
<P>
Even though a higher proportion of women than men pursue college educations in 
Japan, they account for only 4.6% of the nation's scientists and engineers, 
one-third the U.S. figure. But about 10% of Toshiba's 900 researchers are 
women, which is believed to be one of the highest ratios in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
They are people like Hiromi Kobayashi, a graduate in physics now researching 
oxygen sensors; Naotaka Uchitomi, who is probing gallium arsenide 
semiconductors, and Masako Nakahashi, who joined Toshiba 20 years ago as one of 
a handful of women researchers and now leads a team of five men in metals 
study. 
</P>
<P>
"Toshiba had a great understanding for female researchers. They told me: 'We 
want you to work as long as you can,' " Kobayashi said. "My sister tried to get 
a job at another company as a researcher, but she couldn't because she was a 
woman." 
</P>
<P>
Kobayashi claims that women approach research more flexibly and patiently. In 
one experiment, she recalled, she obtained results long after a male colleague 
gave up. 
</P>
<P>
"I did a lot of funny things which are not in papers or books," she said. 
"Female researchers are more adventurous." 
</P>
<P>
Sakae Shimizu, Toshiba's senior executive vice president, said the company 
began vigorously recruiting women a few years ago to bring an added dimension 
to research and help fill Japan's pressing shortage of engineers. 
</P>
<P>
"In Japan, this resource has been vastly under-utilized," said Shimizu, a man. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fujitsu: Lessons From Silicon Valley 
</P>
<P>
Fujitsu has put up partitions for privacy. It has linked researchers through 
workstations to stimulate electronic brainstorming. It has nearly doubled 
R&amp;D spending during the past five years, to more than 10% of its $18 
billion in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the projects are selected by the laboratory, instead of the 
business units -- compared to half 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the new policies came from Silicon Valley, where Ogi spent 3 1/2 years 
as president of Fujitsu America Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The partitions, for instance. While in the United States, Ogi proposed lowering 
partitions to foster Japanese-style collaboration. He immediately faced 
American-style confrontation. His U.S. staff promptly brought him a thick 
report describing the link between physical barriers and excellent research. He 
was convinced. He returned to Japan in 1988 -- and set up dividers. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers say they love those and other changes. "If each researcher has 
a creative idea, he can gather researchers with the same idea to realize a new 
thing," said Shigeru Sasaki, a researcher in pattern information processing. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the firm scored major triumphs in the race to build the world's 
fastest supercomputer, developing two near-practical applications of devices 
that greatly speed a computer's processing power. Today, the firm is targeting 
the field of artificial intelligence, aiming to make it more accessible to 
business computer users, said lab director Shigeru Sato. 
</P>
<P>
The quest for original research was intensified after what Fujitsu researchers 
call the "IBM accident." That was the 1983 dispute stemming from IBM's charges 
that Fujitsu illegally copied the IBM software code that made Fujitsu computers 
compatible with top-selling IBM mainframes. IBM and Fujitsu agreed to a binding 
arbitration proceeding in which the issue of guilt was not addressed. Under the 
1988 arbitration ruling, Fujitsu was granted a restricted right to examine 
IBM's software -- but it has paid more than $833 million for the privilege. 
</P>
<P>
"Fujitsu people had a good experience: Copying is bad," Sasaki said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hitachi: Research Streamlined 
</P>
<P>
Hitachi Ltd. was also forced into greater innovation by scandal. In 1982, 
Hitachi employees were arrested on charges of industrial espionage against IBM. 
Hitachi was caught trying to pilfer some of IBM's operating system software. 
Both sides agreed to keep the settlement confidential. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the Big Blue problem, we have to develop the very basic software by 
ourselves," said Sumihisa Kotani, Hitachi's chief engineer. Kotani said 
Hitachi's 150% boost in research spending the past decade -- to $2.7 billion 
this year -- has primarily focused on software, microelectronics and computer 
hardware. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Hitachi has a record of original research in its own right. In 1981, it 
became the first Japanese firm to crack the list of the top five recipients of 
U.S. patents. Since then, it has climbed to No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's granddaddy of corporate research, Hitachi maintains 33 research labs 
with 16,000 staff members. In 1985, it opened a new advanced research 
laboratory, where more than 90 researchers are probing software science, 
biotechnology, new materials and electron/radiation beam physics, a field that 
could unlock ways to observe DNA structures and new materials in three 
dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
Lab director Eiichi Maruyama said one key feature was cutting out middle 
management. Instead, researchers report directly to Maruyama and consult twice 
a year with an advisory committee of academics. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, if young scientists want to propose some new research theme, in many 
labs they must propose it first to a group leader, then the department manager, 
then the planning office staff, then the deputy general manager, then the 
general manager," Maruyama said. "We believe the best way is to reduce the 
number of steps for this basic research. The individual's idea is very, very 
important." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Matsushita Electric: New Freedoms 
</P>
<P>
At Matsushita's Museum of Technology in Osaka, the writing is literally on the 
wall. Posted amid 2,600 consumer gizmos ranging from flat TVs to multilingual 
robots, a company poster heralds Matsushita's new crusade: 
</P>
<P>
"Corporate slogan for 1990: Breakthrough." 
</P>
<P>
Hiroyuki Mizuno, senior managing director of Matsushita Electric Industrial 
Co., maintains that basic research doesn't exist in Japan, so he's preparing a 
radical experiment to promote it. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, Matsushita will open a lab in which 20 to 30 researchers will be 
free to pursue scientific discoveries with no commercial objectives. 
Researchers will select projects entirely on their own. They will be able to 
work when and where they want. They will be evaluated -- and financially 
compensated -- strictly on results. 
</P>
<P>
But his colleagues' response to his plan underscores one of Japan's key 
creative blocks: He could not persuade one Japanese researcher to take such a 
gamble. So he plans initially to staff the lab with foreign scientists. 
</P>
<P>
Mizuno also said he plans to push for a huge increase in research and 
development spending -- from the current 5.8% to 15% of the conglomerate's $42 
billion in sales. The company sells consumer electronics and communications 
equipment under the brand names National, Panasonic, Technics and Quasar. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe you can say that radios, TVs and VCRs are all based on the same ideas, 
and when they come to market we are forced to compete with U.S. or European 
companies," Mizuno said. "But if we focus on our own ideas . . . a totally new 
technology where there are no Western inventions, this can only contribute to 
humankind. That is the way to avoid troubles."

SPIRITS INDUSTRY LAUNCHES $20-MILLION DRIVE AGAINST TAX HIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

business issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
The alcoholic beverage industry is using shrewd political maneuvers and a 
growing campaign kitty to fight a proposed ballot measure that would raise the 
tax on wine, beer and liquor. 
</P>
<P>
Up against a carefully plotted campaign, the liquor lobby is priming all its 
guns to scuttle the Alcohol Tax Act of 1990, which is likely to be on the 
November ballot. An estimated $20 million will be spent to defeat the measure 
in what is shaping up as one of the most expensive and sophisticated campaigns 
in California's 83-year initiative history. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the state Senate approved a liquor lobby plan to place a competing 
measure on the ballot that calls for more modest tax hikes. Liquor interests 
also are pushing an initiative that would throw out special taxes that don't 
get two-thirds voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
Pushing the higher tax increase is a well-organized group of activists from the 
mental health community, social service organizations and anti-alcohol groups. 
Physicians, law enforcement leaders and alcohol treatment business owners are 
also behind the campaign to qualify the "nickle-a-drink" tax hike for the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, they turned in more than 1 million signatures to the Secretary of 
State, who is expected to qualify the proposition soon. 
</P>
<P>
The proposition would boost the state excise tax on beer from 4 cents to 57.5 
cents per gallon, on wine from 1 cent to $1.29 per gallon and on spirits from 
$2 to $8.40 per gallon. Proponents estimate that the cost to the consumer would 
be about 5 cents a drink. 
</P>
<P>
The $720 million in added revenue would fund mental health services, drug and 
alcohol-related law enforcement activities, alcohol treatment and prevention 
programs and emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
California has some of the lowest alcohol taxes in the nation, and even the 
liquor industry admits that raising the tax is good public policy. "Nobody is 
arguing about the need to increase taxes for alcohol, but what's fair and 
what's completely irrational?" asked Sue Thurman, a spokeswoman for Taxpayers 
for Common Sense, an alcohol industry group formed to fight the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, an industry is confronted with an unfriendly ballot measure that 
has widespread popular support. Early polls show that 70% of the voters would 
be likely to approve the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The depth of the support explains why the liquor lobby mapped out a 
step-by-step political strategy to stop the measure soon after the proposition 
was approved for petition circulation. 
</P>
<P>
They learned some lessons from the "sin tax" initiative in 1988. Then, the 
tobacco industry and the state's smokers got hit with a 25-cents-a-pack tax 
when California voters approved Proposition 99. 
</P>
<P>
One lesson: "Despite the history of infighting among beer, wine and spirits 
(industries), they have achieved a level of unity rarely reached in past 
years," according to an account of the campaign in a trade newsletter called 
Impact. 
</P>
<P>
The publication says "industry executives will spend whatever is necessary" to 
beat the tax hikes. 
</P>
<P>
Although the measure hasn't qualified for the ballot yet, beer brewers alone 
have spent $3.9 million to fight the tax increase, according to Beer Marketer's 
Insights, another industry newsletter. The latest campaign spending reports 
haven't been made public, but an estimated $20 million will be spent to oppose 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The industry's campaign blueprint tries to force proponents of the alcohol tax 
to defend their position on several fronts. The industry argues, for example, 
that the liquor tax would upset the state budget process by earmarking funds 
for specific health programs, and therefore would deny funding to public 
schools that otherwise would get 40% of all state revenue. 
</P>
<P>
This argument was enough to get state Superintendent of Schools Bill Honig on 
board as an outspoken critic of the proposed liquor tax increase. Also upset 
about losing control of the budget process, many legislative leaders have 
joined with the industry to oppose the steeper liquor tax. 
</P>
<P>
If the new coalition isn't enough to defeat the measure, the industry has a 
couple of fallback strategies. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Constitutional Amendment 38 is the countermeasure that was approved by 
the Senate last week. A different version was endorsed by the Assembly, and now 
both sides of the aisle must come together on the final bill. As a 
constitutional amendment subject to voter approval, the measure would then be 
put on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Under this scheme, beer taxes would go to 20 cents per gallon, table wine to 20 
cents and spirits to $3.30. The measure would raise an estimated $200 million 
in new revenue without designating how it should be spent. 
</P>
<P>
If this plan fails, the industry is banking on Los Angeles tax-limitation 
crusader Joel Fox to come to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
A disciple of Paul Gann and Howard Jarvis, Fox is leading a campaign to qualify 
the "Tax Payers Right to Vote" initiative. The measure would require statewide 
ballot measures that call for special taxes -- such as the proposed liquor tax 
-- to win two-thirds of the voters. Currently, special taxes can win with a 
simple majority. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal doesn't mention the liquor tax proposals, and the industry is 
careful to distance itself from the campaign for the Fox proposition. 
</P>
<P>
But, "it's an obvious ploy to undercut the nickel-a-drink measure," said 
Timothy Howe, chief of staff for Assemblyman Lloyd Connelly (D-Sacramento), who 
has spearheaded the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The language of the Fox measure supports the conclusion that it is aimed at the 
alcohol tax increase. If passed, the proposition would become effective Nov. 6, 
the day of the election, and would apply to any measure approved that day, 
including the liquor tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
Fox admits that the "alcohol industry has supported us all the way," but he 
expects other business groups to get behind his measure when "they figure out 
they may be next for one of these special taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Concerned that voters will embrace the Fox measure, health groups that support 
the higher tax increase are planning to file a lawsuit that will question the 
constitutionality of the proposition. An announcement on the litigation is 
expected to be made this week. 
</P>
<P>
While the campaign maneuvers have begun in earnest, there are more political 
salvos to be fired. "The paranoia around here is as high as it can get," said 
Howe. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't sure what to expect next, but we know it won't stop until Nov. 6."

CAR SHOPPERS MAY GET A BETTER DEAL ON 1991 MODELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM INCANTALUPO, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Car shoppers planning to wait for the fall distress sales on leftover models 
might be disappointed this year. And they might also find the 1991s are a 
better deal because their prices are not expected to be much higher than those 
of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Some who follow the auto industry professionally doubt that the 
end-of-the-model-year deals in August, September and October will be any better 
than the discounts available now. 
</P>
<P>
It's a matter of supply and demand: the production of cars versus their sales. 
When unsold inventories rise, the deals usually get sweeter. 
</P>
<P>
Inventories of models built by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and 
Chrysler Corp. are lower than they were at this time last year and are, on 
average, at levels considered normal, thanks to extensive assembly plant 
shutdowns earlier in the year. 
</P>
<P>
One Big Three executive, who shared company estimates on the condition that 
their source not be disclosed, said there are about 1.4 million Big Three cars 
in inventory now, 540,000 fewer than a year ago. There are about 88,000 fewer 
Big Three trucks, or about 1.1 million, according to the estimates. 
</P>
<P>
But some industry watchers think that current Big Three production levels and 
those planned for June, July and August are higher than is justified by a 
market propped up by some of the most generous cash rebates and option 
discounts in the industry's history. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is up and running now," said Cynthia Certo of Integrated Automotive 
Resources, a consulting firm in Wayne, Pa. "The problem is sales haven't been 
picking up." 
</P>
<P>
She thinks that inventories will rise, and, although many of those additional 
cars will be 1991 models, a surplus could increase the pressure on car makers 
to get rid of their leftover '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Others think that supply and demand will stay in balance. "Sales are not very 
good," said David Healy of Barclays Bank, "but production isn't very high 
either." Adds Joseph Phillippi, auto analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.: 
"I don't see the likelihood of massive fire sales unless (car) sales weaken 
substantially." 
</P>
<P>
Actions last week by Ford and Chrysler seem to support that view. Ford 
announced that it planned a special rebate program between Sept. 28 and Dec. 31 
for leftover '90s. It said some rebates could be less than those now offered, 
although it did not rule out the possibility of some being higher. Chrysler 
announced reduced rebates on five of its models, saying stronger sales had 
reduced inventories. 
</P>
<P>
Experts are in closer agreement about the outlook for the two biggest-selling 
makes of Japanese cars: Toyota's and Honda's inventories are a little higher 
than normal, and the companies are offering discounts -- though not cash 
rebates. But their sales are strong, and experts don't expect their inventories 
or their discounts to change much in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Experts also say they don't expect inventories -- or discounts to buyers -- 
will change much if one or more of the Big Three is struck in September when 
their contracts with the United Auto Workers union expire. A long strike, 
considered unlikely, could cause shortages, however, and drive up prices. 
</P>
<P>
But experts do suggest a few other factors to consider if you're thinking of 
buying a car in the next few months: 
</P>
<P>
* Sticker prices for '91 models probably won't be much higher than those on the 
'90s -- maybe 2% or 3%, according to analysts. They say the weak market simply 
can't support anything higher. Last year, new-car prices rose about 5%. 
</P>
<P>
* A leftover will be worth less as a used car simply because it was a 
model-year older than a '91. 
</P>
<P>
* The leftover '90 you're thinking of buying might be replaced by a 1991 model 
you would consider worth the extra money and the wait. A few examples: Chrysler 
Corp.'s minivans have been restyled for '91. So have the Buick Electra and 
Oldsmobile Regency.

PREGNANT PAUSE; 
</P>
<P>
PHOTOGRAPHER WHO SPECIALIZES IN MOTHERS-TO-BE UNDERSTANDS THE CRAVING TO 
DOCUMENT THIS SPECIAL TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
What first-time mother doesn't have a snapshot of herself at the stage in her 
pregnancy when she has forgotten what her feet look like? 
</P>
<P>
In this archetypal picture she stands sideways, grinning demonically as she 
demonstrates how unbelievably big this baby is. 
</P>
<P>
"See!" she seems to say, "I can barely touch my fingers in front of my extruded 
navel." It is clear that she regards her girth as evidence of the extraordinary 
virtues of her unsprung offspring. 
</P>
<P>
Joanna Keller understands the craving of mothers-to-be to document this 
extraordinary time in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
A professional photographer who lives and works in Park LaBrea, Keller makes 
her living shooting weddings and bar mitzvahs. But last year a pregnant friend 
asked Keller to take pictures of her in the final weeks of her pregnancy. 
Keller has been photographing pregnant women ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Keller's mothers-to-be (she's photographed several in recent months) look as 
serene as Renaissance Madonnas. 
</P>
<P>
Photographed in their homes, they sometimes sit in rocking chairs, light 
streaming through windows behind them, a shawl or blanket draped over their 
bare shoulders and around their distended bellies. Sometimes they glance 
wistfully over at a bassinet already crowded with stuffed animals. Overhead is 
the mobile modern parents trust will stimulate their unborn paragon all the way 
to Stanford or Yale. 
</P>
<P>
When her clients are willing, Keller photographs them in the nude. Swollen 
breasts and curving midsections form voluptuous landscapes. One of Keller's 
clients, a massage therapist, has a butterfly tattoo on her lower abdomen that 
seems to hover over her unseen but very present unborn child as if the baby 
were a flower. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Kipnis, 35, was photographed shortly before daughter Heidi was born 
Nov. 15. Kipnis recalled that she and Keller contrived to wait until the very 
last moment "until I was the biggest." Keller had taken her wedding photos, 
Kipnis said. She wanted prenatal photos because, "I thought my body was really 
beautiful with the baby in the womb." The result is photographs she regards as 
"the epitome of motherhood." 
</P>
<P>
The Mt. Olympus resident didn't feel at all self-conscious about posing nude, 
she said, adding she would do it again only if she were pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Kipnis pointed out that Keller's photos are only the most formal ones taken 
before the baby was born. She also has a videotape of the sonogram made during 
her amniocentesis. (The sonogram allows women to compare their offspring even 
before they are born. Overheard recently: One pregnant teen-ager, with sonogram 
in hand, saying to another, "My fetus is cuter than your fetus.") 
</P>
<P>
Keller became a professional photographer after her 22-year marriage ended in 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
As a child in local schools she had loved art -- until junior high school. 
"Then one of my teachers said something awful about something I was really 
proud of, and that was the end of art." 
</P>
<P>
She went to UCLA, planning to major in theater arts, then dropped out to get 
married. "I did things like heading the PTA bazaar and writing the PTA 
newsletter," she said of that phase of her life. "I made lunch." 
</P>
<P>
She first began taking photographs in an advertising art course. "I loved the 
camera," she said. "Suddenly I didn't have to be able to draw something to 
capture it." 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, photographing mothers-to-be reminds Keller of her own childbearing. 
Keller has two daughters, Lauren, 30, and Julie, 26. 
</P>
<P>
Pregnancy and birth have undergone a revolution since Keller's daughters were 
born during the obstetrical Dark Ages, as she calls it. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, people didn't routinely know the gender of their children until 
after they were born. One hoped one's baby would look good in yellow (most 
didn't) because that was the color of choice during prenatal shopping. Black 
and white was for bachelors. Lavender unsettled your in-laws. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, before amniocentesis, older mothers-to-be worried for a long time 
before most could be reassured that their offspring were just fine, thank you, 
with the median number of toes and noses and no flaw more tragic than Uncle 
Charlie's unfortunate chin. 
</P>
<P>
The major involvement of fathers in the birth process ended nine months before 
the baby was born. 
</P>
<P>
Keller, who charges about $300 for a portfolio, thinks her pregnancy 
photographs are a sign of the times. 
</P>
<P>
In this era of the deferred and oh-so-wanted baby, parents-to-be don't leave 
much about pregnancy and child rearing to chance. If they have the money, they 
don't hesitate to seek professional assistance on infant-related matters that 
were once handled strictly by amateurs. Twenty years ago, who ever heard of 
having a home professionally child-proofed? If a new mother overlooked some 
domestic hazard, her own mother would look at her as if she were Jack the 
Ripper and say: "You want to leave this poison under the sink where the baby 
can get it?" This service was free. 
</P>
<P>
In those days there were football coaches, hockey coaches, even soccer coaches, 
but no lactation coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Keller notes that today's pregnant women are often in great shape and proud of 
their fecund bodies. She said she loves helping them celebrate their 
pregnancies. So far, her clients have found her through word of mouth, but she 
plans to distribute flyers to birth centers and other places where pregnant 
women congregate. 
</P>
<P>
Keller stops time just before a woman's life is changed forever. 
</P>
<P>
And photos are nicer mementos of that time than stretch marks.

ELECTIONS MALIBU CITYHOOD; 
</P>
<P>
WINNER OF 1 COUNCIL SEAT REMAINS UNDECIDED; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: WRITE-IN AND ABSENTEE BALLOTS NOT YET COUNTED WILL DETERMINE IF 
ZEITSOFF OR MERRICK IS THE VICTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A contested seat on Malibu's future City Council remained in doubt last week, 
and a spokesman for the Los Angeles County registrar's office said it may be 
several more days before it is known whether slow-growth activist Missy 
Zeitsoff or retired Judge John Merrick is the winner. 
</P>
<P>
"It's miserable when you want to celebrate and can't," said Zeitsoff, the 
apparent fifth-place finisher in last Tuesday's incorporation election in which 
voters overwhelmingly approved cityhood and chose a five-member council. 
</P>
<P>
Zeitsoff, the former secretary of the pro-cityhood Malibu Township Council, had 
21 votes more than Merrick, with an unknown number of write-in and absentee 
ballots yet to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 30 contenders were two write-in candidates, including attorney Sam 
Birenbaum, who spent about $10,000 on his campaign. Some observers estimate 
that there may be between 100 and several hundred write-in and absentee ballots 
that remain to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
Such ballots are counted separately and by hand, causing the delay. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no way at this point of segregating absentees and write-ins by 
community and thus no real way of even knowing how many such ballots there may 
be from Malibu," said Marcia Ventura, a spokeswoman for the registrar's office. 
</P>
<P>
Despite trailing, Merrick found some humor in the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"The joke around my house is that if I win, we're going to demand a recount," 
said the 71-year-old retired Municipal Court judge, whose wife, while 
supportive, is known to have preferred that he not enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malibu's incorporation, which cannot occur until after the election 
results are certified in a few weeks, also remains clouded. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have asked a state appeals court to delay the actual 
incorporation date until next March, and a hearing on the matter has been set 
for July 18. However, in setting the hearing last week, a three-judge panel in 
Los Angeles left open the possibility of allowing incorporation to go forward 
by late June or early July, pending written opinions from lawyers for the 
county and cityhood supporters. 
</P>
<P>
The county is seeking the delay in a bid to start work on a $43-million 
regional sewer system in Malibu before a new city government has the chance to 
block it. 
</P>
<P>
A victory for Zeitsoff would represent a clean sweep of the council by 
slow-growth activists, who are already celebrating a whopping 84% approval of 
cityhood by Malibu voters. 
</P>
<P>
The four confirmed winners include Walt Keller, the top vote-getter, and 
Carolyn Van Horn, who were co-chairs of the Malibu Committee for Incorporation 
before resigning to run for office. Larry Wan, the second-highest vote-getter, 
was president of the Malibu Township Council, and Mike Caggiano has long been 
associated with the group. 
</P>
<P>
As a judge in the community for 22 years, Merrick, along with Keller, was 
considered to be the most recognizable of the candidates and was widely 
mentioned as a favorite prior to the election. He was the only candidate among 
the top nine vote-getters who was not affiliated with either of the two 
pro-cityhood groups. 
</P>
<P>
Land-use attorney Paul Shoop, who far outspent other candidates, finished 10th, 
and real estate broker Richard Idler came in a distant 12th in the balloting. 
They, along with Merrick, were singled out in ads placed in Malibu's two weekly 
newspapers by opponents who questioned their support of cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
Although once opposed to cityhood, Merrick and Shoop campaigned in favor of it. 
Idler was less enthusiastic about incorporation, expressing concern about the 
adequacy of the city's projected $5-million budget, but said that since he was 
convinced that voters desired cityhood, he wanted a role in Malibu's future. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council outcome surprised even some cityhood boosters. They labeled 
the incorporation vote as a mandate for preserving the community as a 
semi-rural enclave, and proof that residents reject the county's blueprint for 
widespread development that they had warned was a threat to Malibu's future. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's clear people voted for those they know will protect Malibu from 
excessive development and rejected others that they felt wouldn't follow 
through with that," Van Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being co-chairwoman, with Keller, of the incorporation group for 2 1/2 
years, Van Horn, a retired schoolteacher, is an environmental activist who is 
associated with Save Our Coast, a Malibu-based environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
Keller, a retired aerospace engineer who has a Ph.D. from UCLA, has been in the 
vanguard of the cityhood movement for nearly 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Of the confirmed winners, he and Van Horn have been the most outspoken about 
restricting new residential and commercial growth. They have suggested that an 
existing land-use plan for the Malibu area may not be tough enough to deal with 
future development. 
</P>
<P>
Wan, a business executive with a Ph.D. in engineering from Yale, derived much 
of his political strength from his 2 1/2 years as president of the 2,000-member 
Malibu Township Council. 
</P>
<P>
Although also an outspoken critic of the county's development policies for 
Malibu, he has expressed concern that if a new city government engages in too 
much downzoning, it may only entice the county to approve excessive development 
just outside Malibu's boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Caggiano, 36, the council's youngest member, and another Malibu Township 
Council representative, shares a similar view on development. A public-policy 
analyst who works as a private consultant, Caggiano is a former analyst at the 
RAND Corp. He has a Ph.D. from the RAND Graduate School. 
</P>
<P>
As the two top vote-getters, Keller and Wan will serve four-year terms on the 
council, with the other three winners facing reelection two years after they 
take office.

JEWISH GROUPS' TURF WAR GOES PUBLIC; 
</P>
<P>
WESTWOOD: JEWISH STUDENTS ARE REFUSING TO LEAVE THEIR BAYIT -- HOUSING THAT THE 
CHABAD SECT SAYS IT NOW OWNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chabad sect of Hasidic Jews hopes to complete by mid-June its controversial 
planned takeover of the Westwood Bayit, an independent Jewish student housing 
cooperative on UCLA's Fraternity Row. 
</P>
<P>
But, if successful, it will be a hostile takeover. 
</P>
<P>
The Bayit (Hebrew for house or home) has been in the middle of a tug-of-war 
since December and the fight has become an unusually bitter and public dispute 
within the Los Angeles Jewish community, where turf wars usually are thrashed 
out in private. 
</P>
<P>
It pits Chabad, a charismatic movement that mixes mystic revivalism with 
meticulous observance of ancient laws and traditions, against a mixed bag of 
students and their sympathizers, whose Jewish affiliation ranges from 
uncommitted to deeply religious. 
</P>
<P>
Chabad, which took title to the house in a disputed transaction late last year, 
plans to move its homeless men's rehabilitation program into the house on 
Landfair Avenue as soon as its 18 residents can be persuaded to leave. 
</P>
<P>
The residents dispute the building's transfer and have refused to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Groups including the Jewish Student Union and Hillel, the campus Jewish 
ministry, have taken the side of the Bayit residents. So have several Jewish 
community leaders, most of whom were once listed as members of the Bayit's 
Board of Governors. 
</P>
<P>
"Our hope is that the property will be returned to its rightful owners and 
we're working to that end," said Dorothy Goren, one of the former Bayit board 
members and a director of the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles. 
The 20-member board was cut to three last year. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of meetings and letters, the Bayit's volunteer attorneys called on 
Chabad to return the Westwood house and two others in Santa Barbara and 
Berkeley to the Bayit Project, a nonprofit corporation that controlled them. 
</P>
<P>
But Chabad seems unlikely to budge. 
</P>
<P>
"This (the Bayit) was offered to other organizations and they turned it down," 
said Rabbi Boruch Shlomo Cunin, West Coast director of the Brooklyn, N.Y.-based 
religious group, which assumed half a million dollars of debt but did not put 
down any money as part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point we're saying . . . if you think it's a slam-dunk case, use the 
legal remedies," Cunin said. 
</P>
<P>
The homeless program is only one of Chabad's broad range of activities, many of 
which are intended to satisfy the biblical exhortation to "repair the world" 
while spreading the word about its own brand of old-time religion. 
</P>
<P>
Cunin offered to take in the Bayit's 11 men residents at Chabad's West Coast 
headquarters two blocks away, which would also be open to 30 other UCLA 
students, while the women would be put up at nearby apartments. 
</P>
<P>
But the students, who pride themselves on the variety of religious beliefs and 
activities at their run-down residence, are having none of it. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider ourselves a very open place," said Bayit resident Adina Jaffe, a 
junior in history. "If we were forced to move to Chabad, a lot of that would be 
eliminated because they have their set ways and they would pretty much mold us 
into their form of practice." 
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by Chabad's move into two basement rooms at the Landfair Avenue house 
last month, the students put up a banner reading "Save Our Bayit" next to the 
Hebrew letters that mark it as a Jewish house on a street that is largely 
Greek. 
</P>
<P>
They have also taken to dead-bolting the door to their living quarters and 
demanding that visitors show identification. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a military installation," said Omid Zareh, a spokesman for the residents. 
</P>
<P>
Previously the site of the Tau Delta Phi frat house, the financially troubled 
Bayit has been a sort of urban kibbutz since 1974, when the founders put in a 
kosher kitchen, shared the rent and chores and committed themselves to 
observing the Sabbath and religious holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my first encounter with people who kept the Sabbath. It had a very 
strong effect on people's lives," said Nadine Kaplan-Wildman, a Bayit board 
member who met her husband at the house. 
</P>
<P>
While the Westwood Bayit is more than 15 years old, the latest entanglement has 
its roots in 1982, when Michael Goland, an enigmatic San Fernando Valley 
businessman, stepped in to save the house after a previous owner put it on the 
market. Goland is best known as the person who is credited with financing 
almost single-handedly the 1984 election defeat of Sen. Charles H. Percy 
(R-Ill.). 
</P>
<P>
Goland was an unhappy former frat pledge at USC when he was drawn to the warm 
environment at the house on Landfair Avenue, associates said. It inspired him 
to found the Bayit Project, a network of 24 Jewish student houses around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-member Board of Governors was appointed in 1985, and Goland deeded the 
Westwood House to the Bayit Project in 1987. But Goland suffered financial and 
legal reverses -- he was convicted last month (May) of making an illegal 
campaign contribution -- and the Bayit Project virtually collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Only three houses were left last year, when Goland signed a document reducing 
the size of the board to three members: himself, long-time business associate 
Lyle Weisman, and Mendel Itkin. 
</P>
<P>
The latest crisis started last summer, when Weisman and Itkin signed over the 
houses to Chabad, according to real estate records on file in Los Angeles, 
Santa Barbara and Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, Itkin, is a salaried fund-raiser for Chabad, Cunin acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
The Chabad leader said that his lawyers have told him there is nothing improper 
about the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
But Gregory R. Smith, a volunteer attorney for the 20-member Board of 
Governors, said that the two men were not authorized to act for the Bayit 
Project, and that Itkin's role at Chabad made him ineligible to vote in any 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're the employee of another organization to which you're transferring 
all the properties, it sounds like a possible conflict of interest," Smith 
said. "My guess is, if this cannot be amicably resolved, then it will end up in 
court, and that's not the way to go among Jewish organizations." 
</P>
<P>
Chabad attorney Marshall B. Grossman said that there was no conflict, however, 
because Itkin did not profit directly from the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's any validity to any of these positions we'll act accordingly, but 
thus far I haven't seen any activity that would amount to a violation of the 
California Corporations Code," said Grossman, who is also donating his 
services. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm also waiting to see if anyone steps forward with a check sufficient to 
cover the mortgages or repairs necessary at the facility. That line is 
remarkably short," Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
An internal memo prepared for the Jewish Federation Council of Los Angeles 
concluded in 1988 that the Bayit Project was without staff, without programs 
and in need of at least $350,000 in repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Offered a chance to take over the operation, Hillel turned it down, as did 
several other Jewish organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Hillel's decision was made because the houses came burdened with several 
hundred thousand dollars of debt and a possibility that ownership could revert 
to Goland, said Chaim Seidler-Feller, the rabbi at UCLA Hillel. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Hillel would like to see the Bayit survive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bayit is a critical component of Jewish life at UCLA," Seidler-Feller 
said. "It has been responsible for nurturing the Yiddishkeit (Jewishness) of 
countless numbers of Jewish students who looked to the Bayit to provide a total 
Jewish environment that sustains and supports their Jewishness at a very 
vulnerable time in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Goland was unavailable for comment. He is now in Israel, hoping to get 
"spiritually renourished," according to his attorney, Robert M. Mayman. 
</P>
<P>
Mayman said that Weisman and Itkin transferred the properties to Chabad without 
his client's knowledge, and that Goland would like to see them returned to the 
Bayit Project. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to give Chabad the opportunity to be gracious and to recognize its 
error in thinking that the batim (Hebrew plural for houses) were insolvent 
institutions, with no life left in them, but in fact had a board and a 
committed membership and a wish to continue, " Mayman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We had hoped that when Chabad realized that, they would restore everything to 
the status quo," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Cunin was not swayed. "At this point, the ball, I believe, is in their 
court," he said. "Could it be we made a mistake? I doubt it very much." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Weisman said that there was no other choice but to get rid of the 
houses last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically the problem that led to our giving away the assets and winding down 
the corporation was the fact of a negative cash flow," Weisman said. "We were 
actually in foreclosure on one property in Berkeley, we were pending 
foreclosure in Santa Barbara and we were facing a $300,000 balloon payment in 
Westwood." 
</P>
<P>
He also said that Goland knew of his intentions to transfer the houses to 
Chabad even though the two were not on good terms. 
</P>
<P>
"If these other people had been involved and cared (about the Bayit), where 
were they when we went to them for money and help?" Weisman asked. "They're 
interested on an anti-Chabad basis, and I was shocked. I didn't believe in 
today's world that people acted this way in the Jewish community." 
</P>
<P>
Although Goland has not spoken up on behalf of the Bayit residents, his 
presence at a recent meeting of the Board of Governors was seen as a show of 
support. 
</P>
<P>
He also filed documents of his own in February of this year, including a $2.5 
million claim against the Westwood property, that effectively block Chabad from 
disposing of the properties, attorneys for both sides said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a three-ring circus, to say the least," Cunin commented. 
</P>
<P>
The rabbi, who was quoted in the Jewish Journal as calling himself "a street 
fighter from the Bronx," defended Chabad against suggestions of impropriety by 
denouncing the co-ed nature of the Bayit as immoral. 
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Greg Smith, who is representing the Bayit's old Board of 
Governors, is a leader in the Westwood Kehilla, an Orthodox congregation with 
close links to Hillel's Seidler-Feller. 
</P>
<P>
The Kehilla, which was formed five years ago, has no building of its own, 
meeting instead for Sabbath prayers at Hillel House. 
</P>
<P>
"They had designs themselves on the Bayit, to make a synagogue out of it," 
Cunin said. "So there are no clean hands here." 
</P>
<P>
Smith denied that his congregation coveted the Bayit. 
</P>
<P>
Cunin also said that the rent has not been paid since April, while Chabad has 
been pouring in "a fortune in mortgage payments." But the students said they 
have left their monthly checks for $5,650 in the usual place, a mailbox in 
their dining room.

THE LOOK OF 'TRACY'; 
</P>
<P>
COMIC STRIP WITH ITS OWN REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MATHEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a shot in the opening moments of "Dick Tracy" where the camera draws 
back from a live-action street scene, pans slowly left across a wide and 
gloriously unreal nighttime cityscape, then re-enters another live-action 
street scene on the other side of town. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being a nifty optical trick that gives us a quick reference to the 
scope of Crime Stopper Dick Tracy's urban beat, the shot is director Warren 
Beatty's way of announcing that this comic strip world has its own reality and 
we'd better chuck our expectations before entering. 
</P>
<P>
"Warren decided years ago that 'Dick Tracy' had to break all the rules, that we 
were going to have to throw away everything we knew to make it work," said 
veteran art director Richard Sylbert. "He knew there was no way in the world 
you could take this man with a yellow hat and coat who's followed by a guy with 
a flat head and walk him around Chicago. We had to create a parallel world." 
</P>
<P>
The high-profile cast of "Dick Tracy" includes Beatty, Madonna, Al Pacino and 
Dustin Hoffman, but the real star of the movie is The Look. Every scene in the 
film -- whether it's all live action or live action combined with a matte 
painting -- feels like a composition of a moving Sunday funny. It does not look 
like the comic strip, but you leave with that impression. 
</P>
<P>
"It's impressionistic, but to use Warren's phrase, it's impressionistic apple 
pie, simple American values," Sylbert said. "This is not 'Metropolis.' This is 
about a guy who has a girlfriend and hates lawbreakers." 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to do something that I could have the same fun looking at that I had 
looking at the Sunday comics when I was a small kid reading Dick Tracy," Beatty 
said. "(The comic strip) was really pleasing to my eye, like going to Times 
Square for the first time was pleasing to my eye." 
</P>
<P>
"Dick Tracy" is a funhouse of visual gimmicks, not the least of them being the 
assortment of characters whose names match their looks -- Pruneface, Flattop, 
Lips, Little Face. But the original gimmick that became the only rule in the 
production was Beatty's decision to limit the film's designers to the seven 
colors cartoonist Chester Gould used in his original Dick Tracy drawings. 
</P>
<P>
A single scene may include dozens of background objects, but every object is 
done up in one of the seven colors. The same is true for clothing, cars and 
buildings. Every square inch that appears on the screen was either freshly 
painted or freshly made. 
</P>
<P>
So people like Sylbert, costume designer Milena Canonero and the visual effects 
team of Michael Lloyd and Harrison Ellenshaw found themselves doing the 
opposite of what they have done throughout their careers; instead of working to 
blend their work into the reality of scenes, they had to strut their stuff out 
front. 
</P>
<P>
"All the realistic, specific, beautiful tonal detail we did for (pictures like) 
'Reds,' we had to give up," Sylbert said. "Doing work to be noticed goes 
against the grain of your work and it makes you very nervous." 
</P>
<P>
"Warren kept pushing us and pushing us," said Lloyd. "One day he said to me, 
'This is either going to make your career or ruin you. Give me everything 
you've got.' He wanted us to see how far we could take it." 
</P>
<P>
Beatty said he got the idea for shooting the film in basic colors from 
cartoonist-screenwriter Herbie Gardner who told him that when he was doing 
Schmo for the Rotogravure, the magazine assigned colors to objects by numbers. 
"Red is 1, so the hat, the flower and the car are 1s. Green is 2, so the plants 
and leaves are 2s. It's a matter of matching them all up." 
</P>
<P>
Because the objects were three-dimensional that were being filmed, lighting and 
shadows create the illusion of more colors than the seven actually being used, 
but through most of the film the colors are so saturated, it's startling. 
Cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, who (like Sylbert) worked with Beatty on 
"Reds," shot the whole movie without using the prop smoke that is used in most 
films to mute colors and contrasts and create a more realistic atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no atmosphere in that kind of cartoon," said Sylbert, "so Storaro 
didn't put a drop of smoke in it." 
</P>
<P>
Each of the key visual designers were working with color keys, deciding how to 
mix and match, how to compose, how to create moods with the use of certain 
colors. The way Storaro chose to light scenes often affected the choices made 
by the rest of the conceptual team. When Big Boy and his gang appear for one 
street scene, the crew wet the street and Storaro shot it with a cadmium light 
that turned the pavement red. (Red is a 1, so sinister is a 1.) When he shot a 
scene with Dick Tracy and Tess Trueheart on the same street, the pavement was 
soaked again and Storaro bathed it in yellow light. (Yellow is 2, so warmth is 
a 2.) 
</P>
<P>
But the original inspiration for them all was Gould. The cartoonist, trying to 
overcome the limitations of the comic strip medium, had to make his panels more 
interesting by the way he composed scenes with colors. Sylbert said he 
attempted to do the same thing in the art direction of the film. "When Dick 
Tracy walks into his office, there are other objects in the room the same color 
as his coat and hat," he said. "We'd try to make the scene more interesting by 
bouncing those colors around." 
</P>
<P>
Subtlety was never an option, Sylbert said. "Years ago, Warren and I were 
looking at a movie ad for 'The Untouchables' with these FBI agents in tweed 
overcoats. Warren said, 'We can't have tweed in 'Dick Tracy.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nor, they decided, could they fill out the frames with the usual set decoration 
touches -- no paintings on the walls, no textures, no fine detail. What did 
this mean? What did Beatty intend to fill the screen with? 
</P>
<P>
According to the key creative people, this film's list of "do's" and "don'ts" 
only included "don'ts." 
</P>
<P>
Ellenshaw, who had worked on George Lucas' "The Empire Strikes Back," said it 
took him six weeks to even get a sense of what Beatty wanted. Like Lucas, he 
said, Beatty wanted to fill every frame with something interesting, but he 
could not anticipate what the director would find interesting. 
</P>
<P>
"When you showed him something and he said it looked like 'shoe leather,' you 
knew you had more work to do. Shoe leather is his way of saying, 'It's not 
interesting to look at, why are we going to put that on the screen?' " 
</P>
<P>
Ellenshaw said there are 60 matte shots in "Dick Tracy," and each one was done 
to be interesting in itself and, in many cases, to draw attention to itself. 
</P>
<P>
On a routine job, Ellenshaw said he would have one artist on one painting. For 
the early shot in "Dick Tracy" that unites two different live-action street 
scenes, there were seven artists working on the eight-foot by 12-foot matte. To 
get the shot on film required 16 elements -- the matte painting, the two live 
action scenes and a variety of ambient effects that include smoke rising from 
high-rise chimneys and stars twinkling in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
The movie's most obvious matte scene is one where Tracy and Breathless Mahoney 
meet late at night on a wharf to discuss their interests in each other (he 
wants information; she wants recreation). In the background is a fleet of 
ships, painted with a perspective that could only be achieved with a wide-angle 
lens. But the moon that hangs above them could only be that large if it were 
shot through a Telephoto lens. 
</P>
<P>
"The dock scene violates all sorts of rules," Ellenshaw said. "It combines two 
things that are physically impossible. It's also extremely stylized, and that's 
what's fun about it." 
</P>
<P>
It may be corny, but it definitely isn't shoe leather. 
</P>
<P>
Sylbert said that once Beatty decided on creating an artificial world for "Dick 
Tracy," there was no choice but to shoot it with matte paintings and make it 
clear to the audience that that's what they're looking at. "You could go for it 
with miniatures (like they did with 'Batman')," Sylbert said. "But we couldn't 
afford that. Whatever you think of 'Batman,' it's a $60-million movie." 
</P>
<P>
Beatty wouldn't discuss the budget on "Dick Tracy," but other sources put its 
cost at $28 million, which would make it one of the least expensive of the 
summer spectacles. 
</P>
<P>
One way that Walt Disney Pictures will not recover some of those costs is 
through product placement. There is not an identifiable brand of anything in 
the movie. The cars all look like 1946 somethings, but you can't say what. 
Chili is chili, cereal is cereal and milk is milk. Even the money used is 
generic, with big dollar signs splashed on the bills. 
</P>
<P>
"When I decided to do this, I said I'm going to have fun with it," Beatty said. 
"I would say I had more fun making 'Dick Tracy' than any picture I've done and 
I have a tremendous amount of fun watching it. Those people, the colors, the 
music. I think of it as just this piece of cake." 
</P>
<P>
As for his own performance as the Yellow Knight: "I don't know if I have fun 
watching myself, but I do enjoy watching my hat and coat."

'DICK TRACY'- BEATTY'S ARRESTING SUMMER ADVENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON

<TEXT>
<P>
You gotta give it to the gumshoe: "Dick Tracy" is brash, irresistible fun. 
Warren Beatty's vision of a comic strip on film comes in paint box-bright 
colors with nicely irreverent dialogue, a gaggle of crisp performances and one 
with million-dollar moxie. 
</P>
<P>
It's a film of enormous style, with a sure sense of itself. You may not exactly 
brood about the inner lives of these characters for days after you leave the 
theater -- then again, for better or worse, that may be one of the definitions 
of a summer movie. To take the words out of the mouth of another Tracy, "There 
ain't much meat, but what there is is cherce." 
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of "Tracy" (opening citywide Friday) takes place in a sort of 
ultra-stylized Chicago after dark, but for all its nighttime gorgeousness, it's 
still a brighter film than "Batman"; it's sunny in spirit, not feverish, and it 
leaves less of a copper-penny taste of nastiness in the mouth. What violence it 
has is of an old-fashioned, '30s movie cops-and-robbers variety, a man with a 
Thompson submachine gun against a slew of bad 'uns. While "Dick Tracy" has its 
own glorious villain, his tone is entirely different from the leering excesses 
of the Joker; Al Pacino's Big Boy Caprice has to be one of the screen's most 
extravagantly funny creations. 
</P>
<P>
In a struggle for control of the city between Big Boy and the mysterious 
faceless mobster, The Blank, "Dick Tracy's" character villains look eerily like 
cartoonist Chester Gould's own: Flattop, Pruneface, Mumbles, The Brow, even the 
amazing Little Face are perfect down to the last freckle and groove. In 
contrast, the romantic characters and/or good guys, Beatty as ol' tomahawk nose 
himself, Glenne Headly's Tess Trueheart, Madonna's Breathless Mahoney, young 
Charlie Korsmo's Junior (known for most of the movie as The Kid), Seymour 
Cassel's loyal Sam Catchem and James Keane's Pat Patton, are, more or less, 
undisguised. 
</P>
<P>
Yet by some magic, none of the villains are immobilized by their elaborate 
makeup; it seems to have liberated them. It certainly electrified Al Pacino, 
because clearly, "Dick Tracy" is Pacino's movie, not Beatty's and not 
Madonna's, individually or together. Madonna's performance, which in retrospect 
seems to be songs, salty patter and a collection of artfully struck poses, 
won't disappoint her fans, but it may not win her new ones -- her acting hasn't 
caught up with her charisma. Pacino, on the other hand, is likely to wow the 
world by pure, inspired, comic invention. 
</P>
<P>
(The screenplay, thick with quotable wit, is credited to Jim Cash and Jack 
Epps, Jr., the team responsible for the utterly unmemorable dialogue of "Legal 
Eagles" and "Top Gun." Attention is called to the "special consultant" credit 
given writer Bo Goldman, of "Melvin and Howard," and "Shoot the Moon.") 
</P>
<P>
Who could have suspected that a performance of this hilarity lurked behind Al 
Pacino's forbidding intensity all these years? "Dog Day Afternoon" may have 
given more than a hint of it; in "Sea of Love" as Pacino fell all over himself 
to get out of the way of a possibly murderous Ellen Barkin, there was a 
shutter-quick glimpse of the funniness in the man. Beatty's direction -- or 
even the sense of working behind Big Boy's disguise -- may have been the 
liberating force. Whatever it was, something popped the cork and out spilled 
this goggle-eyed mobster with a pencil-thin mustache, plastered-down hair and a 
silhouette roughly like Quasimodo's. 
</P>
<P>
Watching Big Boy coach Breathless and her klutzy chorines in how to sell a 
numbah, dancing it for them himself, touching, tweaking, all the while running 
a nonstop line of Malaprop quotes, "If you ain't for the people, you can't buy 
the people . . . Lincoln!" there is the sense of an actor having the time of 
his life. (Some of the same fun emanates from Dustin Hoffman's glowing cameo as 
Mumbles.) 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Beatty's Dick Tracy strides through his naughty world like a 
yellow beacon light. He is a pillar of command in his work and a Hamlet of 
indecision in what passes for his personal life and Beatty plays him with 
owlish rectitude. As he had in the comic strip, Tracy has major problems with 
the "m" word: marriage. Absolutely sticks crosswise in the man's throat -- 
making him the perfect hero now as well as in the 1930s. The original Dick 
Tracy's engagement to Tess Trueheart lasted from 1931 to 1949; this one seems 
headed in the same direction, in spite of the twinkle to Glenne Headly's sturdy 
Tess. 
</P>
<P>
If Tracy can't quite say yes to Tess, he can at least say no to the 
indefatigable come-on of Breathless Mahoney. "No grief for Lips?" he asks her 
sardonically, referring to her recently departed lover/ boss. "I'm wearin' 
black underwear," she points out. She certainly is, and in the face of such 
provocation, Tracy's morality is to be admired, unless you've come 
for543650405Facing Breathless, Tracy is stunned but inert. (For a PG-rated 
film, the brief, silhouetted nudity, steamy dialogue and amount of routine 
violence is a little stunning as well.) 
</P>
<P>
For fireworks, try the look of the film, under Vittorio Storaro's exquisite 
lighting camera work, which renders all the prosthetic makeups of John Caglione 
Jr. and Doug Drexler completely real. Richard Sylbert's production designs seem 
to have distilled the essence of the '30s, without a jot of sentimentality. 
They're clean, essential, vivid, yet marvelously theatrical, probably the 
richest since "Blade Runner." They're matched by the playful exaggeration of 
Milena Canonero's costumes, which assign a single, all-over hue to each 
character. To see that hoary scene -- a clutch of reporters interviewing their 
subject on the steps of a courthouse -- when one reporter is dressed in 
electric blue from his shoes to the press card in his hatband, another is in 
all-orange and another is all in plum, lifts a cliche into something 
wonderfully witty. 
</P>
<P>
As they invariably do, Stephen Sondheim's songs may grow on you by frequent 
repetition -- something they're sure to have. They get their best innings in 
the lovely duet "What Can You Lose," begun by Mandy Patinkin's lovestruck piano 
player, 88 Keys, and joined by Breathless. Danny Elfman's soaring score, even 
though it strikes a few "Batman" memories here and there, seems to be the 
musical equivalent of Sylbert's darkly various sets. 
</P>
<P>
So before the tsunami of merchandising hits us, and we can't stand the sight of 
one more yellow Fedora or another two-way wrist radio -- the way we were 
Batmanned and E.T.'d to death in stores -- let's have one moment to recognize 
the pure fun of "Dick Tracy," the first clear joy of summer.

COVER STORY: VIEWERS CAN SAY SO LONG TO TV'S SUMMER DOLDRUMS 
</P>

It wasn't long ago that summer brought the dog days of television. Viewers were 
bombarded with repeat after repeat of their favorite -- and less than favorite 
-- series and were force-fed an array of unsold TV series pilots and inane 
comedy-variety shows. 
</P>
<P>
But TV's summer doldrums are over. Or at least tempered, thanks to the savvy 
programming of cable, PBS and the fourth network, Fox. 
</P>
<P>
Cable has chosen the summer to offer new series, specials, documentaries and 
feature films. PBS' summer schedule is its most ambitious to date and Fox hopes 
to increase its ever-growing audience with new programming. 
</P>
<P>
And what about the Big Three networks? Though viewers will be seeing a handful 
of new limited series, ABC, CBS and NBC mostly will serve up their traditional 
summer menu of reruns. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a selective guide to what's new and interesting on TV this summer.

Peter Tortorici, CBS' senior vice president of program planning, explained why 
networks can't rely only on reruns for the summer: 
</P>
<P>
"The successful shows repeat very well in the summer," he said. "But the issue 
is, when you have marginal performers -- or shows that are not even marginal, 
but failed -- you are going to have extremely low audience numbers. I can't 
imagine any of us want to see our circulation levels go to that kind of low, 
especially in light of the competition from cable, from videocassettes and, 
most specifically, the Fox network."

MERCHANT IVORY: THERE'S ROOM FOR THEIR VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The films of Indian producer Ismail Merchant, California-born director James 
Ivory and their writer, the German-born novelist Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, are 
almost invariably literary adaptations, witty and intimate, and reflect their 
own cross-cultural sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
The partners are indeed expert at deceptively gentle depictions of cultural 
confrontations that reverberate quietly with implications. Most of their best 
films have been made in India, yet their most popular picture, the 1986 
adaptation of E.M. Forster's "A Room With a View," was made in England and 
Florence. Their company has had a few failures, but its many successes are 
marked by an uncommon sophistication, civility and intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, Merchant and Ivory contacted Jhabvala in Delhi with the hope of 
persuading her to let them make a film of her novel "The Householder." Not only 
did she agree but adapted it to the screen herself, thus marking the beginning 
of a writing-producing-directing team that endures to this day. Preceding the 
June 29 opening of their latest picture, the detective comedy "The Perfect 
Murder," the Monica 4-Plex will present a two-week retrospective of 14 Merchant 
Ivory films (not all of which were written by Jhabvala or directed by Ivory). 
</P>
<P>
The retrospective commences with "The Europeans" (Friday), their exquisite 1979 
film of the Henry James novel that concerns the impact of Europeans and 
Americans of the mid-19th Century upon each other. A gallant and radiant Lee 
Remick stars as a determined husband hunter. "Quartet" (Saturday), their 1982 
film of Jean Rhys' delicately wrought 1928 novel, captures well the brittle, 
intense atmosphere of Rhys' Bohemian, cafe society of the '20s and much of her 
insight, if not quite a full measure of her rigor. Elegant and wry, it is an 
embittered, impassioned expression of a woman (Isabelle Adjani) at the mercy of 
her emotions and impoverished state. 
</P>
<P>
Their 1987 "Maurice" (next Sunday) is a well-nigh flawless account of a 
conventional upper-middle-class young man (James Wilby, wonderfully unaffected) 
coming to terms with his homosexuality in Edwardian England. It is based on 
E.M. Forster's posthumously published 1913 novel. 
</P>
<P>
In bringing John Masters's novel "The Deceivers" (June 18) to the screen for 
Merchant Ivory, director Nicholas Meyer and writer Michael Hirst took an 
all-too-reverent approach to this old-fashioned adventure, which finds Pierce 
Brosnan going native to expose the murderous thuggee cult in 1820s India. 
</P>
<P>
Merchant Ivory's 1965 "Shakespeare Wallah" (June 19) helped establish their 
international reputation. It's a charming tale in which a playboy (Shashi 
Kapoor) becomes caught between his mistress, an exotic idol of the Indian 
cinema (Madhur Jaffrey), and an English actress (Felicity Kendal) who tours 
India with her parents' seedy Shakespearean company. In the 1971 "Bombay 
Talkie" (June 20), another key early film, Ivory and Jhabvala delineate with 
thoroughness and compassion the ill-fated meeting of a hard-edged, tempestuous 
best-selling novelist (Jennifer Kendal) and a Bombay movie star (Kapoor), whose 
popularity is beginning to slip. 
</P>
<P>
For his first American film, Ivory forsook the distinctive delicacy of his 
Indian films to create in the 1973 "Savages" (June 21) a thunderingly tedious 
allegory about how thin the veneer of civilization can be; the setting is a 
bizarre house party between the World Wars. It's not unlike the current "The 
Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover." 
</P>
<P>
Ivory's latest release, the 1989 "Slaves of New York" (June 22), which Tama 
Janowitz adapted from her book of trendy, slight short stories, is also 
peculiar: a shallow, boring business about arty loft-living lowlifes in which 
Janowitz's messy, unfettered savagery tends to overwhelm Ivory. A miscast 
Bernadette Peters stars. 
</P>
<P>
The airy, delectable 1986 Merchant-Ivory-Jhabvala adaptation of "A Room With a 
View" (June 23) is perfection itself, a virtually irresistible tale of the 
flowering of a deceptively demure Edwardian young lady (Helena Bonham-Carter) 
whose transformation begins in Florence when she witnesses a bloody and random 
act of violence. Daniel Day-Lewis is a hoot as Bonham-Carter's insufferably 
priggish fiance. 
</P>
<P>
The 1983 "Heat and Dust" (June 24) draws us into a treacherous, precarious 
world of vanished splendor, that of royal India under British rule during the 
'20s. Our pretty, witty heroine (captivating Greta Scacchi, then a newcomer), 
however, is not the typical colonial wife, for she possesses a dangerous streak 
of recklessness. Merchant-Ivory-Jhabvala have weighed down their story 
needlessly but not fatally with a present-day framing story that has Julie 
Christie coming to India to discover what she can about Scacchi, who had been 
her scandalously romantic great-aunt. 
</P>
<P>
The troubled-plagued "Wild Party" (June 25) seemed a garbled, garish variation 
on the Fatty Arbuckle legend when released by American International in 1975. 
Starring James Coco, Raquel Welch and Perry King, it now will be presented for 
the first time in Merchant Ivory's uncut version. "The Bostonians" (June 26) is 
a splendid adaptation of the Henry James novel in which a rich, starchy Vanessa 
Redgrave takes in tow lovely Madeleine Potter, enlisting her in the struggle 
for women's suffrage but unexpectedly confronted by a suitor (Christopher 
Reeve) in ardent pursuit of her ward. 
</P>
<P>
The delightful 1977 "Roseland" (June 27) is composed of three vignettes set in 
Manhattan's venerable ballroom of that name; the Roseland of the film is a 
magnet for all generations of lonely people. In the large cast are Teresa 
Wright, Geraldine Chaplin and Christopher Walken. 
</P>
<P>
Concluding the series is the very first Merchant-Ivory-Jhabvala collaboration, 
"The Householder" (June 28). It's a modest 1963 domestic comedy involving an an 
ineffectual, underpaid schoolteacher (Kapoor), his rebellious bride (Leela 
Naidu) and his self-pitying mother (Durga Khote). For showtimes: (213) 
394-9741.

ARE MADONNA, NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK AND MILLI VANILLI SINGING LIVE OR LIP 
SYNCHING IN CONCERT? SOME LEGISLATORS SAY IT'S TIME FOR ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the most talked about moments in Madonna's acclaimed new "Blond 
Ambition" tour is when the former Material Girl joins arm in arm with a man in 
a bright yellow Dick Tracy overcoat and dances around the stage -- while a tape 
of one of her songs plays. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna uses a recorded version of a song from her new album because Warren 
Beatty duets with her on the record -- and the actor, who plays the comic-strip 
hero in the upcoming film, isn't about to go out on the road for three months. 
There's no attempt to disguise the fact that Madonna's not actually singing 
live on stage. 
</P>
<P>
But what about the rest of her concert? 
</P>
<P>
Is she really able to run around the stage with the energy of a marathon runner 
without huffing and puffing at some point or missing a note? 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Janet Jackson executes some equally complicated dance steps during 
her highly touted "Rhythm Nation" tour. Yet no matter how physically demanding 
the novice performer's dancing was at the Forum in Inglewood, Jackson turned in 
studio-perfect vocals on every number. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of concertgoers ask themselves: Are these artists really singing? Are the 
bands really playing? 
</P>
<P>
What seem like simple questions lead to pop's hottest guessing game -- and a 
maze of suspicions and claims, denials and doubts. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna and Janet Jackson concerts aren't the only acts that have left fans 
guessing in recent months. Questions have also been raised about such other 
dance-oriented acts as Milli Vanilli, New Kids on the Block and Paula Abdul. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry insiders insist that tapes -- at least background instrumental or 
vocal tapes -- are employed by some acts, but they won't publicly specify who. 
</P>
<P>
"You won't get any names out of me, but I do know for a fact that there are 
groups now that do use tapes to re-create the look and sound of their videos," 
Louis Messina, owner of the Dallas-based Pace Concerts and producer of the 1989 
Club MTV tour, said in a telephone interview. "But I don't necessarily think 
that it's wrong. If the audience leaves the concert fulfilled, that's what 
counts." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Madonna, Jackson and Abdul deny their acts are using 
recorded vocal tapes (except for Madonna's Dick Tracy number), though a member 
of Milli Vanilli and a spokesman for New Kids on the Block admit their groups 
employ tapes in some cases. The practice, they say, is simply a reflection of 
the need to re-create on stage the sophisticated technology of the recording 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course we work with tapes on a certain level," said Milli Vanilli's Rob 
Pilatus in a recent interview with a Los Angeles TV station. "But we sing live, 
too. This means that on some songs -- because of the high energy -- we use the 
Synclavier, but other songs we sing live." 
</P>
<P>
But some legislators in California, New York and New Jersey feel it's time for 
the guessing game to end. 
</P>
<P>
In May, Assemblyman Neil B. Cohen, vice-chairman of the Consumer Affairs 
Committee in the New Jersey State Legislature, joined with Assemblyman Joseph 
Mecca in introducing legislation requiring performers to make it clear before 
concerts whether they'll sing live or lip-sync to recorded music. 
</P>
<P>
"We inferred that the current trend toward pre-recorded vocals and electronic 
enhancement was to the detriment of the consumer," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
California Assemblyman Bob Epple and New York Assemblyman Jerrold Nadler are 
also trying to enact disclosure bills regarding recorded instrumental tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"My bill will let consumers know what to expect," said Epple, who plans to 
introduce his bill in January. "It will enable them to make an informed 
decision as to how they want to spend their money. 
</P>
<P>
Does the consumer really care whether artists perform live or use tapes? Given 
the pace at which concerts sell out these days, pop music purists would be 
hard-pressed to argue against automation. Truth in advertistng aside, audiences 
tend to be enraptured by the picture-perfect performances that computer 
technology provides. Contemporary artists are judged less on the merits of 
their musical prowess than on the look of their latest video. In this regard, 
proponents of tapes insist that automation does not inhibit the concert 
experience, it enhances it. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Wells, a 15-year-old New Kids on the Block fan club member from 
Danville, Calif. doesn't see a problem. "I've been to four New Kids concerts 
and each performance was great," said Wells. "Even if they did lip-sync a 
portion of the show, it wouldn't bother me at all. They're great entertainers." 
</P>
<P>
But Musician magazine editor Bill Flanagan disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone grimacing and striking heroic poses to a pre-recorded tape is kind of 
like fraud," Flanagan said. "How would you feel if you went to a football game 
and found out every exciting pass and tremendous field run was choreographed in 
advance? 
</P>
<P>
"People buy tickets to live events because they want to watch artists 
accomplish something. Tapes completely negate that. They create kind of like a 
supermarket appearance, where audiences end up cheering the celebrity just for 
showing up." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times, Todd Headlee, who is Milli Vanilli's U.S. 
manager, would not say directly whether his act lip-syncs on stage. But he did 
comment on Cohen's New Jersey "disclosure" measure, which mandates that an 
artist's name appear on the face of a ticket with a notice that the entire show 
or portions thereof are recorded. Failure to comply could mean penalties of up 
to $50,000 for promoters and up to $5,000 for authorized ticket vendors. 
</P>
<P>
"The bill is ludicrous," Headlee said. "It would be like Burt Reynolds having 
to announce before a movie that the hair on his head was not his own, that he 
was wearing a toupee." 
</P>
<P>
Headlee rejects the idea that fans are being hoodwinked. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen about 50 Milli Vanilli shows and I can honestly say that there isn't 
one person who comes to see them who leaves disappointed," Headlee said. "This 
is the wave of the '90s. Fans demand that dance artists get up there and do a 
live video. And no one leaves disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Scott, manager of New Kids on the Block and president of Dick Scott 
Entertainment, maintains that lip-syncing in certain situations can be a valid 
solution to the problem of executing elaborate dance routines. 
</P>
<P>
"I love artists who can sing and, personally, I hate to see lip-syncing done in 
concert, especially when it is obvious," Scott said in a telephone interview 
from his New York office. "But the problem is that it is very difficult to sing 
and duplicate specific songs when they require complicated movements and 
fast-paced choreography. 
</P>

"If we use a tape, we make every effort to make sure that the tape blends into 
the show, so that it doesn't detract from the performance. The main thing, as 
far as I'm concerned, is that the show should be entertaining." 
</P>
<P>
Electronically enhanced singing is not the only technological illusion under 
attack on the concert circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Music critics and some musicians repeatedly charge that the increased use of 
electronic keyboards and computer programming has reduced the contribution of 
live musicians on stage to theatrical mimicry. 
</P>
<P>
They complain that live performances have degenerated into shallow 
reconstructions of video shoots that seem to place a higher premium on visual 
spectacle than musical innovation. 
</P>
<P>
With the invention of digital sampling (a process that allows any sound to be 
digitally analyzed, captured and stored in computer memory to be replayed on 
demand), and digital sequencing (a computerized player-piano of sorts), the 
demand for musical dexterity on instruments is diminishing. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Marinelli of Sonar Productions, a Hollywood recording studio that 
specializes in tracks generated by the Synclavier -- the Cadillac of digital 
sampling/sequencing instruments -- worries about the impact of the 
glamour-oriented, high-tech concert scene. 
</P>
<P>
"We may be looking at a whole new breed of musician coming up here," Marinelli 
said. "A bunch of good-looking graduates from the Hair Institute of Technology 
who can lip-sync." 
</P>
<P>
Marinelli says artists employ sampled vocal and instrumental sounds on stage 
for a variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's cheaper. It's more consistent. It sounds bigger than life and, unlike 
live musicians, it always stays in tune," Marinelli said. "On the downside, 
it's like listening to a tape recorder, and to me that isn't what buying a 
ticket for a concert is all about." 
</P>
<P>
But the concerns aren't just aesthetic ones. Jerry Redmond, vice president of 
the Musicians Union Local 47 in Los Angeles, worries that modern technology is 
putting musicians out of work. 
</P>
<P>
Live orchestras employed at resort hotels are probably the most obvious 
casualties of technological fallout. Following a bitter series of ineffective 
strikes during the '80s, house musicians in Atlantic City and Las Vegas were 
given their walking papers and replaced at revues by recorded music. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Bob Glasel, president of New York's Musicians Union Local 802, 
says music unions around the country have put down their picket signs and begun 
to seek relief through legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same everywhere -- pop concerts, dance clubs, casinos, circuses -- 
technology is the trend," Glasel said. "The public is getting ripped off." 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of Local 802, State Assemblyman Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the 
Assembly Committee on Consumer Affairs, introduced a bill in New York that 
calls for full disclosure in advertising as to whether instrumental music heard 
at an event will be live or reproduced. 
</P>
<P>
In California, Local 47 of the Musicians Union and the California State 
Theatrical Federation have endorsed Assemblyman Bob Epple's plan to introduce a 
similar proposal in the legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the debate continues. 
</P>
<P>
New Kids manager Dick Scott says "People pay for entertainment and that's all 
they care about. They want to feel something in their heart. They expect 
artists to fulfill their expectations, they aren't really concerned with how 
artists accomplish it." 
</P>
<P>
Scott suggests that any truth-in-advertising proposal is an insult to the 
intelligence of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Take our upcoming tour, for instance. We're going to feature a number of magic 
acts. Will that mean that I have to alert the audience before every show that 
when one of the guys levitates or disappears during the performance that it is 
only an illusion? Is that what it's coming to?"

THE '70S REVISITED? YIKES!; 
</P>
<P>
YES, AM HITS SUCH AS 'KUNG FU FIGHTING' AND 'SPIRIT IN THE SKY' ARE BEING 
SALUTED IN A NEW 15-ALBUM SERIES. PERHAPS THOSE SONGS WEREN'T THAT BAD AFTER

When Rhino Records announced late last year that it would be releasing a 
15-volume, 180-song series recollecting the disposable pop music of the early 
1970s, naysayers couldn't be blamed for wondering if there was even the 
slightest market for it. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to '70s nostalgia, folks just don't bother getting out their 
usual rose-colored glasses. Americans as a culture hate the '70s -- especially 
the clothes, the trivial artifacts and the pop music. We tend to remember mood 
rings and wide collars and Grand Funk with only slightly more fondness and 
pride than, say, block-long gasoline lines. 
</P>
<P>
I found that out a couple of years ago when, presaging the current rage for 
post-Vietnam/pre-Reagan kitsch, I threw a '70s theme party. 
</P>
<P>
Guests were asked to come in proper period regalia: The wider the ties, the 
bigger the bells, the better. The house was a veritable time warp, from the Hot 
Chocolate music on the dance floor to the Tab in the refrigerator (nothing Lite 
allowed). It was meant to be both a celebration and an exorcism. 
</P>
<P>
A few dozen of the demonized did show up in their leisure suits and halter 
tops, in search of closure and healing. Some friends, however, refused to come 
to the party on grounds of moral principle, declining to dignify the despised 
decade with their presence, as if they were Nora Dunn and the '70s were Andrew 
Dice Clay. 
</P>
<P>
Others politely declined in the expectation that it would be "too depressing." 
Even some of the stalwarts who did come started moping around by themselves 
halfway through, as if hypnotically re-experiencing a particularly bad prom. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people are having the same reaction to Rhino's "Super Hits of the '70s 
-- Have a Nice Day," a real Rorschach of a cassette and compact disc series. 
(Sorry, but it's not available in 8-track.) Like: Can't we let this stuff stay 
buried? 
</P>
<P>
A recent New York Times review took the standard critical view, with critic Jon 
Pareles declaring, "To me, the early 1970s was when rock bottomed out" and 
calling the Rhino compilation "a reminder of just how awful pop music was." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously Gary Stewart, vice president of A&amp;R for Rhino Records, doesn't 
agree. He sees the music in the 15-album series as in the same classic American 
Top 40 pop tradition as that of the '50s and '60s. Stewart, who compiled the 
series, thinks it's ludicrous to dismiss all the early-'70s hits just because 
they didn't meet the test of "significance." 
</P>
<P>
He has a point. There's a potential arrogance and a form of ageism in assigning 
an entire generation's ear candy -- the hits by generally inconsequential 
artists -- to the scrap heap, while celebrating equally lightweight hits from 
one's own time. 
</P>
<P>
The hits spotlighted in the Rhino series don't carry the artistic vision or 
musical energy of the great early-'60s works from Motown, Phil Spector, the 
Beatles or the Stones. The fact that everyone had bad haircuts doesn't help. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean they didn't still spotlight craft and provide lingering 
pleasures. There is indeed an overwhelming banality to much of what Rhino has 
revived, but in retrospect it's an endearing banality; even that which was most 
insincere and calculated has a long-lost kind of benign innocence to its 
calculation. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt about it, the '70s are back, mostly for camp's sake. First 
re-popularized amid England's acid-house scene, bell bottoms are now de rigueur 
for anyone who's truly hip today in L.A. Smiley faces can be spotted up and 
down Melrose. A Los Angeles dance club called 1970 specializes in period music 
ranging from Donna Summer to T. Rex. 
</P>
<P>
Bands cover '70s songs now the way they used to remake obscure '60s delicacies. 
A short list from recent memory: Doctor &amp; the Medics and Fuzzbox both 
recording "Spirit in the Sky" (see "Have a Nice Day Vol. 2"), Crowded House 
doing "Signs" (see Vol. 6) at the Pantages, John Hiatt singing "Kung Fu 
Fighting" (slated for a future volume) at McCabe's, Erasure resurrecting ABBA's 
"Gimme a Man After Midnight" at the Palace, and the Replacements slaughtering 
"Takin' Care of Business," "Rock and Roll All Night" and virtually every other 
hard-rock song of the period on their mid-'80s tours. 
</P>
<P>
In that spirit, Polydor Records is preparing an album of '70s hits updated by 
current artists -- including Living Colour's Corey Glover tackling Rufus' "Tell 
Me Something Good," Voice of the Beehive putting the sting on the Partridge 
Family's "I Think I Love You" and Hothouse Flowers opening up Johnny Nash's "I 
Can See Clearly Now." The inevitable title: "Guilty Pleasures." 
</P>
<P>
Camp is also the catchword for Rhino's "Super Hits of the '70s" series, which 
is not as inclusive as its name would indicate. Stewart decided to limit the 
series to acts that had only one or two hits in the Top 20 -- parameters that 
necessarily leave out album-oriented rock artists, along with acts that were 
actually strong enough to have, say, three or four hits. Thus you get Daddy 
Dewdrop but no Deep Purple; "Brandy" but not "Mandy." 
</P>
<P>
"The idea was to collect all the odds and ends -- 90% of which is no longer 
available," Stewart said. "In doing that, you sort of produce some music that's 
even more of its time, as opposed to music made by artists who had career 
longevity. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the artists that had one hit, their vision or their musical style or 
their feel tapped right into that very moment and they probably weren't able to 
hit on that again. That makes the music more time-specific and dated, in a 
positive way." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart sees the early '70s as "the last hurrah" for the Top 40. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the last time people made records specifically for the singles market," 
Stewart said. " 'My Baby Loves Lovin',' 'Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes),' 
'United We Stand,' 'Gimme Dat Ding' -- all share the same lead singer, and all 
were made by non-pros. They were writers and musicians who decided to get 
together and make some single hits." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart is going to cut off the series, which is being released in 
chronological order, with Vol. 15 somewhere around 1975 -- "right up to when 
the first Ramones record came out," he said. "That's when 
</P>
<P>
Top 40 radio pretty much became totally invalid or unnecessary." 
</P>
<P>
Was Top 40 ever valid or necessary in the pre-punk, pre-disco period Stewart 
does cover? Even he admits the "Have a Nice Day" series is more for fun's sake 
than to argue a case for serious historical and artistic consideration. It's 
purposefully frothy -- and white. 
</P>
<P>
"R&amp;B records are kind of excluded from this series, basically because that 
music was genuinely good," Stewart explained. "Not that there aren't some good 
singles scattered in this series. But I think soul and R&amp;B reached a sort 
of apex during those years, and they're going to get their own series. (Rhino 
also has '70s disco and glitter-rock collections set for release.) You can 
actually take those records seriously." 
</P>
<P>
And you can't take "Have a Nice Day" seriously as representative of its period 
without its including any of what was uniquely great about the era -- Mott the 
Hoople, early Bowie and Alice Cooper, Al Green, Steely Dan, Roxy Music, the 
Philly soul sound, the Who, Marvin Gaye, et al. 
</P>
<P>
But even some of the most shallow music of the era holds its rewards -- at 
least in retrospect. There was every good reason in 1973 to truly hate the 
DeFranco Family's "Heartbeat -- It's a Lovebeat," which awkwardly combined bad 
melodrama and sickly sweetness in a theretofore unreckoned dosage. 
</P>
<P>
Yet you know that that's indeed little Tony DeFranco putting his 13-year-old 
heartbeat out on the line, a moment in time, without any sophisticated studio 
trickery to puff up his transparently thin vocal range. The song went to No. 3 
on the charts. It's doubtful you'll ever find such nakedness in a bubble-gum 
record again -- at least not in an age when technology makes everything so 
very, very professional. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these sides, it should be noted, are actually enduring or innovative 
quality work. Melanie used the Edwin Hawkins Singers on "Lay Down (Candles in 
the Rain)" nearly two decades before Madonna used the Andrae Crouch choir on 
"Like a Prayer," and to better effect. 
</P>
<P>
Hotlegs' "Neanderthal Man," with a pre-10cc incarnation of Godley &amp; Creme, 
probably has the most unusual production values -- tribal drums on top, vocals 
mixed way down -- of any single ever to hit the Top 40. 
</P>
<P>
Stories' "Brother Louie" went to No. 1 with a controversial interracial love 
theme. The Buoys' "Timothy" introduced cannibalism to the charts 20 years 
before warning labels. 
</P>
<P>
Less trend-setting but equally outstanding pop songs were Smith's "Baby It's 
You," Stealers Wheel's "Stuck in the Middle With You," Dobie Gray's "Drift 
Away" and Loudon Wainwright III's "Dead Skunk." 
</P>
<P>
You can even admire, if not necessarily like, the solid Tin Pan Alley 
craftsmanship of "It Never Rains in Southern California" or the suicidal "Alone 
Again (Naturally)," the earnest likes of which we'll rarely see on the 
Billboard charts again. 
</P>
<P>
Trade-offs have been made. Top 40 listeners and radio programmers have indeed 
come a long way in tolerance for dissonance and odd harmonic progressions 
("Purple Rain" could never have been a hit in the '70s), but almost always only 
if it has a dance beat. Weirdness and classicism both get homogenized by the 
mutual insistence of modern pop's standardized drum sound; heartbeat -- it's a 
machine beat. 
</P>
<P>
The hit parade of the Me Decade offered as much junk as the Madonna Decade, but 
it was an organic kind of junk, neither as wild-eyed as the quasi-hippie music 
that preceded it nor quite as greedily gumptious as the factory-made teen 
fodder it paved the way for. That may not mean that it might not be worthy of a 
good exorcism anyway, but a lingering -- or perhaps first-time -- fondness for 
the schlock monster is no cause for shame. 
</P>
<P>
Having Hamilton, Joe Frank &amp; Reynolds and Dr. Hook as part of your heritage 
is indeed a scourge, but it could be worse, thirty-something and 
late-twentysome-thing comrades -- you could have been born later and have 
"Hangin' Tough" for roots. In the words of the prophets: Hold your head up.

PRIME-TIME FLICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kevin Thomas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gremlins (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) turns Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life" 
inside out with sweet-and-sour funny results involving cuddly stuffed animals 
that turn into lethal monsters; not for the very young. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Attenborough's 1987 Cry Freedom (KTLA Monday at 8 p.m., conclusion 
Tuesday at 8 p.m.), derived from white South African journalist Donald Woods' 
books, is clunky as a narrative but it does illuminate the racist conditions of 
apartheid. Kevin Kline plays Woods and Denzel Washington is the martyrized 
Steve Biko. 
</P>
<P>
In Coal Miner's Daughter (KCOP Monday at 8 p.m.), Sissy Spacek is a luminous 
Loretta Lynn; the heart of this 1980 movie about the country music star is her 
relationship with her husband, played with strength and humor by Tommy Lee 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980 Rough Cut (ABC Monday at 9 p.m.) is unfortunately just that: a jewel 
heist caper that seems to capture the spirit of "To Catch a Thief" only to go 
awry before the end. Burt Reynolds and Lesley-Anne Down star. 
</P>
<P>
The Night Stalker (KTTV Tuesday at 8:30 p.m.) is that terrific, popular 1971 TV 
movie that finds Darren McGavin as a hard-driving reporter on the track of 
vampires in Las Vegas; improbable-sounding but amusing and scary. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicholson and Candice Bergen pair up in the 1971 landmark film Carnal 
Knowledge (KTLA Thursday at 8 p.m.), directed by Mike Nichols to reveal the 
emotional malaise of two men who come of age during World War II. Also starring 
Art Garfunkel and Ann-Margret, who received acclaim for her portrayal of 
Nicholson's pathetic see-pot mistress. 
</P>
<P>
In his final film, Rich and Famous (KTLA Friday at 8 p.m.), director George 
Cukor got terrific performances from Jacqueline Bisset and Bergen. It's a 
witty, occasionally uneven 1981 update of the Bette Davis-Miriam Hopkins film 
"Old Acquaintance." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Redford turned Judith Guest's Ordinary People (KCOP Thursday at 8 p.m.) 
into an extraordinary film, a compassionate 1980 study of the WASP mentality in 
which a wealthy suburban Chicago family attempts to smooth over its deep 
fissures. With Timothy Hutton, Donald Sutherland, Mary Tyler Moore and Judd 
Hirsch. 
</P>
<P>
With the frequently hilarious Love at First Bite (KTTV Friday at 8 p.m.), 
George Hamilton finally got a part he could sink his teeth into-Count Dracula. 
The 1979 film is oddly marred, however, by gratuitous humor at the expense of 
blacks and gays. 
</P>
<P>
George C. Scott is an impressive Hemingway alter ego in Franklin Schaffner's 
fine and affecting 1977 film of Hemingway's Islands in the Stream (KCOP Friday 
at 8 p.m.), set in Bimini on the brink of WWII and involving a sculptor's 
attempts to get to know his sons from various marriages. 
</P>
<P>
With the 1982 Making Love (KTLA Saturday at 8 p.m.), director Arthur Hiller and 
writer Barry Sandler sensitively explore the plight of a young husband (Michael 
Ontkean), seemingly happily married (to Kate Jackson) but in love with another 
man (Harry Hamlin); well-acted but marred by the feeling that these three 
people exist in a social vacuum.

FROM PRIVATE LIFE TO 'MAJOR DAD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A staunch oak tree with Spanish moss hanging to the ground is the logo for 
Spanish Trail Productions, the company behind the CBS series "Major Dad" and 
several TV projects in development. A careful observer might notice that carved 
in the trunk of the oak is the small image of a delta. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a tribute to my wife," said Spanish Trail President Gerald McRaney, the 
spit-and-polished Marine officer in "Major Dad." McRaney is married to 
"Designing Women" co-star Delta Burke. One reason he formed Spanish Trail was 
to provide a solid future for their marriage. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the old Spanish Trail was a highway that ran right in front of the 
house where I lived near the gulf (of Mexico)," said the 43-year-old actor. "My 
grandfather put the first pavement on this highway; it's called Highway 90. And 
it pretty much ends where my wife was born and raised in Florida. So the 
connection is there." 
</P>
<P>
Although McRaney and Burke are almost joined by the hip in private, people who 
surround them in the entertainment industry say that the couple is making a 
decided attempt to establish separate careers before the public. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder. Media interest in the two was so hot for a while that a story about 
one invariably wound up being a story about both. Just last month a National 
Enquirer cover trumpeted that the two had split up-a nasty rumor McRaney's 
publicist said was fanned by a local reporter when Burke was too busy to attend 
a recent parade honoring her husband in Collins, Miss., his small (population 
2,500) hometown. 
</P>
<P>
The couple has turned down national magazine requests to pose together for 
cover stories. Through her publicist, Burke declined to be interviewed or 
photographed for this story. 
</P>
<P>
"We were under an incredible amount of scrutiny," McRaney said during lunch at 
Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
"You can depend on the accuracy of stories written about the personal lives of 
Hollywood couples about as much as you can depend on the information you get 
from a tout at Hollywood Park," he said, the hint of a smile cracking his poker 
face. 
</P>
<P>
The closest he and Burke get to the Los Angeles party circuit is when they 
throw a couple of steaks on the barbecue and invite over some friends. The 
couple was exposed by the bright lights and inquiring mikes of the media a year 
ago during their storybook wedding at the Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel, and then 
again at the start of the TV season when the tabloids began jabbering about 
Burke's weight gain. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't mind so much being out there in the public eye as you mind just out 
and out being lied about," McRaney said. "It gets to be a little hard to take 
after a while. The inaccuracies, the simple inaccuracies, that happens all the 
time. The reporter does a story, turns it in, and then the editor says, 'This 
doesn't have enough punch.' So he puts words in your mouth third-hand." 
</P>
<P>
If the couple is stung privately by all the attention, their ratings are not. 
Burke's "Designing Women" ended up as CBS' top-rated sitcom last season. "Major 
Dad," meanwhile, was the last-place network's only successful new sitcom. Even 
though it finished the season tied for 45th in the ratings, the show won its 
time slot most nights, and CBS picked up the show for next season. 
</P>
<P>
"If you think in terms of making a hit show, you're doomed to failure right 
away," McRaney said. In his sitcom he stars as a die-cast military officer who 
falls for a feisty but attractive reporter and mother of three girls. "If I had 
a formula for making a hit, I wouldn't have to work so many long hours. I would 
just market that formula." 
</P>
<P>
While playing Rick Simon during the final season of "Simon &amp; Simon," 
Universal asked McRaney to develop a comedy for himself. He developed "Major 
Dad," opting for the financial rewards the series would offer over the personal 
satisfaction of returning to the stage, where he left his heart years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a while before I have the opportunity to do stage again," he said. 
"There's no time. You get caught up in this business. You do it for the money; 
I say that unashamedly. I have kids (from two former marriages) who I need to 
get through college. I'm not about to sit and have my family suffer because I 
want to be an artiste." McRaney spit out the word with the gruffness of a 
Marine officer commanding combat troops. 
</P>
<P>
McRaney sees "Major Dad" and other Spanish Trail productions as building blocks 
for his future with Burke. He hopes that in the future he and his wife will be 
considered for their work, and not their internal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"If a guy comes into your house to build a cabinet, what do you care what's 
going on with his wife and his kids?" McRaney mused. "The only valid question 
is: 'Did he build a good cabinet?' 
</P>
<P>
"If an actor comes into your living room on TV and provides you a few yucks, 
then why the next step? My opinion is no more valid or important than the guy 
who built your cabinets. But because I have a multimillion-dollar soapbox, 
people want to know what I have to say. It's an unfair advantage."

THE MIGHTY MILLER; 
</P>
<P>
PLAYWRIGHT AND PBS BRING ANOTHER CLASSIC TO THE 'AMERICAN PLAYHOUSE' SCREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Excuse me," the young actor nervously asked. "Could you please autograph this?" 
</P>
<P>
The balding, bespectacled man looked up from his lunch and smiled. "Sure," he 
told the actor, a boy not more than 12. "Put it here." 
</P>
<P>
The boy put a script on the man's lap and gave him a felt pen. The man quickly 
scribbled Arthur Miller on a page and handed it back to him. The young fan 
beamed. "Thank you," he said and walked away. 
</P>
<P>
The 74-year-old playwright began to chuckle ever so slightly: "That kid told 
me, 'I read your book, 'The Crucible.' " 
</P>
<P>
Miller had flown in from his Connecticut home to observe a reading of "American 
Playhouse's" production of "An Enemy of the People," starring John Glover and 
George Grizzard, which airs Wednesday at 9 p.m. on KCET. 
</P>
<P>
Forty years ago, Miller adapted 19th-century Norwegian playwright Henrik 
Ibsen's all-too-relevant tale of a doctor who discovers industrial pollution in 
his community and is condemned by its citizens when he demands the truth be 
told. For the "American Playhouse" production, the locale has been switched 
from Norway to Maine. 
</P>
<P>
Miller sat silently at the head of a large table in a rehearsal hall at Fox 
Studios and listened intently to the actors recite their lines. When the play 
was finished, Miller shut the script and sat back in his chair. He smiled at 
the cast. He told them he was happy with what he heard. Director Jack O'Brien 
interrupted the proceedings to call lunch, and the man who wrote such classics 
as "All My Sons," "Death of a Salesman" and "The Crucible" retreated to the 
porch outside the rehearsal hall. He made himself comfortable in a 
straight-back chair and took a bite of his roast beef sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
"They were very good," Miller said of the cast. "They had never done that last 
part before. The rest of the play they have been working on, but this is their 
first go at it." 
</P>
<P>
"Enemy of the People" marks the second time Miller and O'Brien have 
collaborated for "American Playhouse." Three years ago, O'Brien directed "All 
My Sons" to great acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very good," Miller said over the din of cars roaring by on the Hollywood 
Freeway. "He's real interpretive and knows how to read. His 'All My Sons' was a 
beautiful production-better than the film version." 
</P>
<P>
"Beautiful" is not the word Miller would use to describe the film versions of 
his work-especially "All My Sons" (1948) and "Salesman" (1951). 
</P>
<P>
"In those days when there were big studios, they wanted the playwright as far 
away as possible," Miller said. "Clifford Odets wrote screenplays but he worked 
out here. I never did that. If you weren't going to do that, they didn't want 
the original writer around. Finally, they would send me a shooting script a 
couple of weeks before they were going to start and I would object." 
</P>
<P>
But the studios never listened to his objections. "I think a certain amount of 
adaptation is required, but (what) happens in general is that the gigantic 
effect of scenes gets undermined because they pull the scenes apart like a 
sweater." 
</P>
<P>
He gives high marks to the 1985 Dustin Hoffman TV version of "Salesman." "That 
was the play purely and simply," he said. Lee J. Cobb, who originated the Willy 
Loman role on Broadway when he was just in his 30s, also did a TV version of 
"Salesman" in 1966 which Miller admired. "Lee was a great actor," he said with 
a twinkle in his eyes. "Lee was old when he was 2." 
</P>
<P>
Miller is working on a new play but won't divulge details. "Broadway is not a 
very happy place," he said. "At Lincoln Center, though, people are trying to do 
some interesting work. They are doing a play of mine next October, 'The 
Archbishop's Ceiling.' That was done at the Royal Shakespeare Company. They do 
a lot of my plays in England. They have theater instilled in them. It's been 
cultivated by those great theater companies. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually," he said, "I can't complain. My work is done more now in and out of 
this country than ever." 
</P>
<P>
But don't expect Miller to write another screenplay. His first, "The Misfits," 
starred his second wife, Marilyn Monroe, and Clark Gable. The moody drama 
failed at the box office in 1961, but has gained in reputation over the years. 
His second, "Everybody Wins," opened this year and was a critical and 
commercial disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"I never liked to write screenplays," Miller said. "It seemed like a good idea 
at the time. You can't control them unless you are going to direct it. It could 
have been something, but there were too many variations which I don't like. Why 
waste my time?" 
</P>

TYSON-TILLMAN, THE PREQUEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When HBO serves up the comeback of former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson on 
Saturday at 7 p.m., we will see him revisiting the site of a defeat that in 
some ways was more painful than the one he experienced February in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
So boxing scholars and psychologists will have no difficulty attaching some 
bitter nostalgic baggage to Tyson's assignment Saturday night. The setting, 
Caesars Palace, will surely summon up unhappy memories for the 24-year-old 
ex-champion. It was there, in the summer of 1984, that he lost in a ring for 
the last time until Buster Douglas pulled off one of sport's greatest upsets in 
Toyko. 
</P>
<P>
And when Tyson on Saturday looks across the ring at his opponent, Henry 
Tillman, he'll see the man who kept him off the 1984 U.S. Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
Forget for a moment that Tyson was upended this year by Douglas, ending a 
championship reign many expected to run for as long as Tyson wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, imagine a Brooklyn teen-ager, possibly on the brink of capturing the 
heavyweight berth on the 1984 U.S. Olympic team. And imagine his pain when he 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 U.S. Olympic boxing trials were in Fort Worth in June, 1984. The 
favorites for the heavyweight berth were Tillman, then 24, and Tyson, who was 
still learning to box, still learning how to eliminate the wild, out-of-control 
fury from his formidable arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
Tillman was from south-central Los Angeles, Tyson from Brooklyn's Brownsville. 
Both were dead-end kids, up from numerous scrapes with the law. Tillman learned 
to box at the California Men's Institution in Chino, Tyson at an upstate New 
York reform school. 
</P>
<P>
In Fort Worth, in a close heavyweight final, Tillman won a 5-0 decision, 
earning one-point margins on every judge's scorecard. Tyson was then chosen as 
Tillman's "most worthy" opponent for the Olympic boxoffs at Caesars Palace a 
month later. To make the team, Tyson needed to beat Tillman twice in two days. 
If Tillman won the first bout, he was on the Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
July 6, 1984: Before 3,018 in the Caesars Pavilion (Saturday's Tyson-Tillman 
and George Foreman-Adilson Rodrigues doubleheader is in Caesars' 15,300-seat 
outdoor stadium), Tillman registered another close, 4-1, decision win. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson believed he had won, but good-naturedly raised Tillman's hand after the 
decision was announced. Then his gloves were taken off, he left the ring, went 
out the door and kept right on walking. His blood was coming to a boil. He came 
to a salt cedar tree about 200 feet from the pavilion, next to a freeway 
onramp. 
</P>
<P>
There, in the hot darkness, all his rage came down. 
</P>
<P>
His fists still taped, Tyson rained hard punches onto the tree. Tears streamed 
down his face and he howled with pain. His 76-year-old trainer, the late Cus 
D'Amato, waited a minute or two, until the fire cooled. 
</P>
<P>
Then he embraced his warrior and gently led him away, to his future. 
</P>
<P>
Tillman went on to Los Angeles and won the gold medal. As a pro, his career has 
been largely disappointing. He is 20-4 and has twice lost to journeyman 
heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who attended every boxing session at the Olympics as an alternate, 
turned pro shortly afterward. He was an instant sensation, reeling off 24 
straight victories until he captured his first heavyweight title, at 20, by 
knocking down Trevor Berbick three times with one punch in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Three and a half years later Tyson was 37-0 when Douglas, a 42-1 underdog, 
knocked him out. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Tyson called it a painful lesson. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd had too many easy victories, fallen into too many sloppy training habits, 
and I never took that fight seriously," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As heavyweight championship runs go, this was a good one. When Douglas won, it 
was Tyson's 10th defense of the championship. In this century, only Joe Louis 
(25 defenses), Larry Holmes (20), Muhammad Ali (19) and Tommy Burns (11) 
successfully defended the title more often. 
</P>
<P>
History also teaches us that the best of fighters, once badly beaten, are often 
never the sa me. One example: Floyd Patterson was a dominant heavyweight 
champion in the 1950s, but an ordinary heavyweight after he was knocked out by 
Ingemar Johansson. 
</P>
<P>
And so boxing insiders will be inspecting Tyson with great scrutiny Saturday, 
when he enters combat for the first time since Tokyo. And make no mistake, 
Tyson was beaten up badly in Tokyo. In fact, seldom in the modern history of 
boxing has any heavyweight taken four punches as brutal as those Buster Douglas 
landed to finish that fight. 
</P>
<P>
Even at that, fueled with uncommon bravery, Tyson got up and almost beat the 
count. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson is a heavy betting favorite Saturday, but a lot of ringsiders will be 
watching him closely, looking for signs of distress in the former champion, 
should Tillman land a hard blow early in the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Footnote: A year ago, hours before a Caesars Palace fight card, I wandered 
behind the pavilion, looking for the salt cedar tree Tyson had assaulted that 
night in 1984. It was gone, replaced by a maintenance yard. So much, I decided, 
for historic landmarks in boxing.

night in Las Vegas. ROBERT LACHMAN

Q &amp; A: TED KOPPEL: TALKIN' ABOUT A REVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABC's Ted Koppel takes a break from ABC's "Nightline" to host PBS' three-part 
"World Without Walls," premiering Sunday at 9 p.m. on KOCE and 10:40 p.m. on 
KCET. The series continues through Tuesday. The special, taped last month at 
the University of Pennsylvania, examines the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe 
and the political, economic and cultural impact they are to have on the United 
States and the world. Koppel discussed "World Without Walls" with Susan King. 
</P>
<P>
How did you get involved in the project? 
</P>
<P>
The University of Pennsylvania came to us (Koppel Productions) and said they 
wanted to do something on the 21st century. What they hired us for was to 
refine the thinking on how that could be produced as three separate programs 
and also how to produce it in such a way as to make for an interesting 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Had communism collapsed when you began planning the series? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, I think we first began talking about this months ago; it was in the middle 
of it happening. By the time we started talking seriously it had happened. 
</P>
<P>
The first installment is entitled "After the Cold War" and features Henry 
Kissinger, Fyodor Burlatsky of the Supreme Soviet and chairman of the Public 
Commission for International Cooperation on Humanitarian Problems and Human 
Rights and Lord Roy Jenkins, former president of the Common Market. What did 
they think would happen in Eastern Europe during the next decade? 
</P>
<P>
I would say that probably the end line was that Burlatsky said that within the 
next 10 years or so the Soviet Union probably will be a commonwealth. 
</P>
<P>
Did they fear the rise of nationalism in Eastern Europe? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the funny thing is the key of the discussion was the fear of many 
Soviets and Westerners and Americans that they are going to have to deal with 
the rise of Islamic fundamentalism. 
</P>
<P>
If you take a look at the Soviet Union, there are 50 or 60 million Muslims 
living there. One of the key questions that has to be decided by the United 
States as it creates its foreign policy is on which side (the Soviets or the 
Islams) does the United States want to be? 
</P>
<P>
How does Dr. Kissinger feel on that issue? 
</P>
<P>
I think Dr. Kissinger feels the Soviet Union carries the greatest potential of 
danger for the United States, and it's premature to think that communism is 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
The topic of the second show is "Winners and Losers in the Global Marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
That ended up being in many ways the most fascinating. We spent a lot of time 
talking about the East Germans and whether the East Germans are Germans in 
everything that implies: the work ethic, the fine attention to detail in the 
work that they do, or are they Marxists who have grown up with this iron rice 
bowl mentality of the state owes me a living, free education, employment, no 
inflation and an apartment for $8 a month? 
</P>
<P>
Are these people going to be able to adjust and, if so, how quickly, to a free 
enterprise system? 
</P>
<P>
With the reunification of Germany, for the first time in their lives East 
Germans are going to be competing and some of them are going to fail, some of 
them are going to be unemployed. They have never known that. 
</P>
<P>
You also have a group of Western industries who are sort of licking their chops 
at the notion of all of this cheap labor in Eastern Europe. It's like finding 
another Singapore, or Hong Kong, or Taiwan, or South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Are the Japanese going to invest in Eastern Europe? 
</P>
<P>
They are going to try to invest in Eastern Europe. The Japanese representative 
made the point they are offering their support to Eastern Europe with no 
strings attached. The Japanese clearly look at Eastern Europe as another 
opportunity for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Kuan Yew, the prime minister of Singapore, who was just brilliant, was 
telling us about the regional corporation in which one product may be produced 
in eight different countries and assembled in a ninth country. The 
extraordinary thing is that they are now far ahead of the Europeans in terms of 
regional corporation. I think the Japanese see that pattern being duplicated in 
Eastern Europe. The bad news is the Third World is going to be left even 
farther behind. 
</P>
<P>
The third installment, "Can Culture Survive the Communications Revolution?," 
sounds fun. 
</P>
<P>
Yeah. We had Tom Wolfe; John Sculley, CEO of Apple Computer; Esther Shaprio, 
the producer of "Dynasty"; Daniel Boorstin, librarian emeritus of the Library 
of Congress, and Paul Fussell, a University of Pennsylvania professor who is a 
very funny guy, very bright. It was a wonderfully provocative panel. I don't 
think they understood each other, and I don't think they made any progress with 
each other, but it was a fun program. 
</P>
<P>
Do you have any more specials coming up for ABC? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, by the end of June, I will have one on the New York legal system and then 
one on sex in the Soviet Union for the fall. Most Soviet women by the time they 
are 40 have had eight to 10 abortions without the benefit of anesthetic. The 
only reason they have them is because birth control devices are not available 
or don't work. So aren't you glad you were born in America?

The patients at Bryan Memorial Hospital in Lincoln, Neb., are believed to have

Lava boiling out of Kilauea Volcano destroyed two more buildings in Kalapana, 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
The fresh damage brought to 165 the number of homes and other structures 
devastated since Jan. 3, 1983, when the volcano began erupting. The Kalapana 
area once thrived, but only 18 homes remain: one in the old village, nine in 
the old homestead area, and eight in Kalapana Gardens housing area. The last 
home in the old village was in imminent danger as lava flowed just yards away, 
and one flow came within seven feet of the home before stagnating, civil 
defense spokesman Lanny Nakano said.

'SUPERVISORS' RIP PRIORITIES OF REAL BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Pete Schabarum was there -- or rather, a smiling picture of the lawmaker, 
propped up in his usual seat at the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
But the other people presiding over the meeting Saturday at the Hall of 
Administration were less recognizable. 
</P>
<P>
The "supervisors" on this day consisted of a gay activist, a homeless man, a 
former drug addict, a union representative and Schabarum's photograph. 
Together, they formed a mock board that was organized by the Alternative Budget 
Coalition, a group of local activists which had rented the room for the 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
For two hours, they listened approvingly as a succession of critics lambasted 
the real county board's spending priorities. Then they "voted" for massive 
increases in funding for health care, child care and programs for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"As the only holdover from the old board, do you have anything to say?" said 
gay activist and mock board member Mark Kostopoulos, addressing the picture of 
Schabarum, whose forehead had been stamped in red with the word "Guilty." 
</P>
<P>
None of the county supervisors was at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Participants directed their most bitter remarks at the real board's proposed 
$10.2-billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if this (mock) board had been here two years ago, my daughter might 
still be alive," said Gloria Panitch, the mother of a Santa Monica mental 
health worker who was stabbed to death in her office last year by a client. 
"There was no money for a 25-cent buzzer or even a window on her door so she 
could see who was coming in." 
</P>
<P>
Others railed against proposed cuts in funds for AIDS treatment, mental health 
outpatient programs and child care, while funds for the Sheriff's Department 
continue to rise. 
</P>
<P>
But the 100 or so people in the audience mostly seemed to revel in the 
uncharacteristic lack of formality of this board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Ordinarily, they don't let you sit in the first three rows," said James Hulse, 
a member of the AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power, Los Angeles (ACT UP/LA), which 
disrupted a Board of Supervisors meeting last month. "There would be 40 
uniformed officers in riot gear behind that door. You'd get three minutes to 
talk, and most of the supervisors wouldn't pay any attention." 
</P>
<P>
A man calling himself "Richard Trixon" took Chief Administrative Officer 
Richard Dixon's seat and haughtily defended the regular board, whose members 
are white males. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just spent $3 million to try to keep it that way," said Trixon, who was 
identified as Tony Arn, a member of ACT UP/LA. He referred to a federal judge's 
ruling last week that county supervisorial districts discriminated against 
Latinos, a ruling the board plans to appeal. "We plan to spend $2 million more 
of your bucks to fight for the right to run the county as we please," Arn said. 
</P>
<P>
The audience booed him off the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the event said they wanted to dramatize the whittling down of 
social service programs since conservatives became a majority on the board in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a massive switch in priorities," said John Suggs of the Los 
Angeles Countywide Coalition for the Homeless, one of the organizers of the 
event. "The sheriff's budget has gone up 108% since 1983, and the mental health 
budget has gone up 1.7%."

HYPERION PAY SCANDAL ALLEGED; 
</P>
<P>
PERSONNEL: POLICE SAY SEWAGE PLANT EMPLOYEES BILLED OVERTIME THEY DIDN'T WORK 
AND REMODELED A PRIVATE BOAT ON CITY TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Los Angeles police are investigating allegations that about a dozen employees 
at the city's Hyperion sewage treatment plant built a fishing platform for a 
private boat while on the job and received overtime pay for hours they never 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at potential grand theft" charges, said Detective Jerry Swick 
of the bunco-forgery bureau. He declined to say how many of the workers might 
face charges or how much money was involved. He said the investigation will 
"take a few months." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials speculated that false overtime claims and work on the 
fishing platform went undetected because of frantic work conditions at the 
plant in early 1989, when several construction deadlines came due on the 
ongoing $1.4-billion expansion of the facility near El Segundo. The city was 
tipped off to the alleged wrongdoing by an anonymous caller to a city hot line, 
the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"For a good period of time they were working 12 hours a day, seven days a 
week," said Assistant City Atty. Tim Hogan, who advises the personnel section 
of the city Department of Public Works. "They were getting two to three times 
their normal hours in overtime." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials said they have taken disciplinary action against two of 
the employees, both of whom were waste-water treatment mechanics with 
supervisorial responsibilities. City officials said they have turned the matter 
over to police and it is unlikely any other employees would be disciplined 
administratively. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, we are targeting mostly the supervisors because, let's face it, 
if the employees didn't know what they were really working on, and the 
supervisors condoned it, they were the ones really responsible," said Marjean 
Schwartz, director of personnel for the Department of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
One of the supervisors, identified as the ringleader, allegedly arranged 
construction of the fishing platform and ordered at least $2,000 in materials 
-- mostly aluminum -- for the project. The employee, whom officials would not 
name, resigned in January after a warning that he was about to be fired, 
Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
The second employee was fired in March for allegedly logging bogus overtime 
hours for his subordinates, having knowledge of the fishing platform and 
providing pornographic films for his workers at the plant, Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
The employee was identified in Civil Service Commission records as David C. 
Fowers Jr. of Upland. Fowers has appealed his firing to the commission, which 
is expected to consider the case next month. A commission examiner concluded a 
hearing on the matter last week. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Friday, Fowers said he knew about the fishing boat 
platform but did not report it because such practices were "prevalent 
throughout the plant" and he had only recently been named a supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a new supervisor, and I emulate what I see," said Fowers, 45. "Throughout 
the plant, people are doing personal projects fully with the knowledge of their 
supervisors. Who am I to go up to my managers and say something?" 
</P>
<P>
Fowers denied that he logged false overtime for his employees, saying the 
overtime in question was for employees on standby duty. He said he did provide 
pornographic films to keep his workers from "dispersing throughout the plant" 
during slow periods. 
</P>
<P>
"I exercised bad judgment, I recognize that," Fowers said. "I should be 
punished, but certainly not terminated." 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz said the city has been unable to document how many hours of false 
overtime were billed because of the large amount of legitimate overtime work at 
the plant. She would say only that it ran into "the thousands of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the fishing boat platform, which was about 10 by 12 feet in 
size, was worked on for a friend of the supervisor who resigned.

LAPD OFFICER SHOT IN ATTACK OUTSIDE HOME; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: SHE IS LISTED IN GUARDED CONDITION. ASSAILANT KILLED, THREE SUSPECTS 
ARRESTED.

<P>
An off-duty Los Angeles police officer was seriously wounded and one of her 
four alleged assailants was killed in a shoot-out early Saturday outside the 
officer's Santa Clarita home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Stacy Lim, 27, was in guarded condition at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial 
Hospital hours after she underwent emergency surgery for a bullet that tore 
through her chest and back, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Joaquin 
Herran. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the two-year Police Department veteran was accosted by two young 
men and two teen-age girls when she arrived home at 1:40 a.m. Authorities 
speculated that the four wanted to take Lim's blue late-model Ford Bronco and 
purse, but didn't realize she was a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Arvin Mani, 20, and the two teen-age girls were arrested on suspicion of 
attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
Details of what happened after Lim arrived in front of her neatly landscaped, 
modest stucco house remained sketchy. But at some point, Lim and Joel Garcia 
Valenzuela, 16, started shooting at each other at a distance of three feet, 
said Deputy George Ducoulombier. Awakened from their sleep, neighbors on Nadal 
Street in Canyon Country said they heard numerous shots being fired rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
When deputies arrived, Valenzuela -- whose last known address is in Los Angeles 
-- was dead, sprawled on the street behind Lim's Bronco. A .357 magnum handgun 
lay next to his body. Neighbors gawked at the shirtless body, which was not 
covered until several hours later. 
</P>
<P>
Lim was found lying in her driveway, next to the front of the Bronco. An 
ambulance escorted by three squad cars took her to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, two suspects -- Mani and a 14-year-old girl -- fled in a 
car, authorities said. Mani and the teen-ager were arrested about 6 a.m. in the 
Highland Park area. 
</P>
<P>
The third suspect, a 13-year-old girl, ran down the street after the shooting 
and hid behind some bushes. She was found by deputies, who were searching 
nearby yards. 
</P>
<P>
"She seemed calm. She wasn't even crying," said a teen-age boy who lives on 
Nadal Street. "It was as if nothing had happened." 
</P>
<P>
Police believe Lim's attackers followed her home, but police said they do not 
know when they began trailing her. Lim, a patrol officer at the Police 
Department's Northeast Division, had not worked Friday, but stopped off at the 
station that night after a softball game before heading home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very unusual to have people from Los Angeles, especially at this age, out 
here in this area," Sgt. Herran said. "Why did they pick her? We don't have any 
answers yet. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing to indicate they knew she was a police officer," Herran said. 
"I think they were surprised she had a gun." 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, dozens of sheriff's officials, detectives and officers 
descended upon the crime scene, which was cordoned off with yellow tape. Los 
Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, three deputy chiefs, various commanders 
and at least one police commissioner surveyed the scene and went to the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Lim originally was listed in critical condition on Saturday. Her condition was 
later upgraded to guarded. 
</P>
<P>
An officer at the Northeast Division, who declined to give his name, said the 
watch commander could not talk to the press. 
</P>
<P>
"He has tears in his eyes," the officer said. "He is so emotional."

RESTAURATEURS SEE RED OVER PROPOSED L.A. SMOKING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
"It's an invasion of my rights," Jacqueline Hughes declared as she puffed on a 
cigarette at La Golondrina restaurant on a recent day. 
</P>
<P>
Under a proposed Los Angeles ordinance, Hughes and three other smokers at the 
Olvera Street eatery would have been prohibited from lighting up -- and the 
thought of that made her angry. "If I want to put myself at risk, that's my 
right!" said the Inglewood office worker. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of La Golondrina is not happy either. Vivien Bonzo estimates that 30% 
of her customers are smokers, and she fears losing that business. "Smokers want 
to smoke right after a meal, and I think our smoking customers would avoid 
restaurants where they can't," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's estimated 10,000 restaurants would become smoke-free under an 
ordinance proposed in May by City Councilman Marvin Braude. Citing the reported 
health dangers of "secondhand smoke," Braude moved to toughen current laws that 
require nonsmoking areas in restaurants with seating for more than 50. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant industry opposes a full smoking ban, saying it would be unfair 
to smoking customers and would hurt business. 
</P>
<P>
"What smokers do is they kill themselves slowly, and that should be their 
prerogative," said Renzo Roder, general manager of Harry's Bar in Century City. 
"They deserve their place in society, and we should make space for them." 
</P>
<P>
Warned Ron Salisbury, owner of Sonora Cafe and El Cholo: "It would be a repeat 
of what happened in Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
A Beverly Hills ban on smoking in restaurants lasted 2 1/2 months, from April 
to July of 1987. While some of that city's 125 restaurants had reported a 30% 
drop in business during the ban, state records showed about a 9% drop in 
taxable sales, compared to a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
After intense pressure, the Beverly Hills City Council amended its ordinance 
and now requires that 60% of each dining room be set aside for nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Braude said he introduced his motion after reports in May that 
the federal Environmental Protection Agency will declare secondhand smoke a 
known carcinogen that causes 3,00 cancer cases in nonsmokers each year. A 
council committee is expected to take up the matter this month. 
</P>
<P>
About 400 municipalities in 30 states have passed various forms of smoking 
limits in restaurants, according to Mark Pertschuk, executive director of 
Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, a Berkeley-based national organization that 
works for nonsmoking legislation. In California, 171 cities and counties have 
such laws. 
</P>
<P>
The only city with a 100% smoking ban is Aspen, Colo., which passed its 
ordinance in 1985. In addition to Los Angeles, similar bans are under 
consideration in Abilene, Tex., and New Hanover County, N.C., Pertschuk said. 
</P>
<P>
Aspen officials said recently that the city had encountered no major 
enforcement problems and that the estimated 65 restaurants there have not lost 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"They jammed it down our throats and we screamed and kicked," said Tim 
Cottrell, president of the Aspen Restaurant Assn. and owner of the Smuggler 
Land Office restaurant. "But in fact it hasn't been as bad as we anticipated. 
It has not been a big problem. It's an idea whose time has probably come." 
</P>
<P>
The Aspen law allows smoking in bar areas, Cottrell noted, and he keeps three 
tables in that area of his restaurant available for smokers. "There are far 
more requests for nonsmoking, and those tables by no means stay full with 
smokers." 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles restaurateurs point out that Aspen patrons are a captive 
audience and cannot easily travel outside the resort city to eat. Los Angeles 
smokers could just go to adjacent communities such as Beverly Hills, Santa 
Monica, West Hollywood or unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County, where 
smoking is allowed in designated sections, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"If the law covered the entire state, or at least the county, then it would be 
more acceptable," Roder said of Braude's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Patti, chairman of the Beverly Hills Restaurant Assn. and owner of the La 
Famiglia Restaurant, said he was convinced that many patrons simply went to eat 
in Los Angeles during the 1987 smoking Ban in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
If Braude's proposal becomes law, the shoe would be on the other foot, he said 
with a laugh. "They're going to come back to Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
Some Los Angeles restaurants already ban smoking entirely on their premises, 
and report no loss of business because of their decision. Lee Rivera, who owns 
the Europa restaurant in Sherman Oaks with her husband, Stan, said the two made 
their decision four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Business has not decreased at all," Rivera said. "Most people thank me on 
their hands and knees." 
</P>
<P>
The Calabasas-based Good Earth Restaurants &amp; Bakery, which has four Los 
Angeles franchise restaurants among 34 nationwide, imposed its own nonsmoking 
ban in October, marketing director Bryon Foster said. As a chain that 
specializes in serving fresh meats and vegetables with no preservatives or 
additives, Foster said the decision came about because "we felt it went along 
with our image." 
</P>
<P>
But some restaurant owners believe the separate dining sections mandated under 
the current city law do a good-enough job of protecting nonsmokers. "It's 
worked out rather well," California Restaurant Assn. spokesman Marc DiDomenico 
said, "because there's enough flexibility in it that provides for all 
customers." 
</P>
<P>
Said Stan Kyker, executive vice president of the California Restaurant Assn.: 
"It's not the same as the closeness inside an airplane. . . . Many or most 
restaurants have air-circulating equipment that moves the air around." 
</P>
<P>
But some nonsmokers disagreed. "Just dividing a restaurant between smokers and 
nonsmokers is not a meaningful solution," said Ted Heyck, a Los Feliz resident 
who works as a deputy city attorney in Los Angeles, as he dined at La 
Golondrina last week. "You end up with smoke. Smoke doesn't divide itself." 
</P>
<P>
About 177 municipalities in California have laws affecting smoking in 
elevators, health facilities, on public transportation, in workplaces or 
restaurants. The varied nonsmoking measures in effect around California seem to 
pose few enforcement problems, according to officials in several cities. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Goldstein, spokesman for the Los Angeles city attorney, said the city 
encountered fewer enforcement problems than expected when it adopted smoking 
restrictions in workplaces in 1984 and the partial smoking ban for restaurants 
in 1987. "To date, we've never had to prosecute a single restaurant or 
workplace," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Of 1,200 complaints filed since 1985, only about 75 have involved restaurants, 
he said, and all were resolved by telephone contacts, letters or administrative 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in such cities as San Francisco, West Hollywood, Irvine, Newport 
Beach, Santa Barbara and Modesto said no one has been prosecuted for failure to 
comply with a nonsmoking ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not received one complaint about smoking in a public place or 
restaurant," Irvine Police Department investigator Ralph Hansen said of that 
city's 5-year-old nonsmoking ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially there was kind of an outcry, and a lot of restaurant owners and 
businesses said it wouldn't work," said John Poole, code enforcement manager 
for the city of Anaheim, which passed its nonsmoking ordinance in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"And initially we did have a number of complaints, did a lot of going out to 
restaurants to get them to set aside a nonsmoking area. In the last year we 
haven't had more than a dozen complaints, this in a city of 250,000 people." 
</P>
<P>
The initial negative attitude changed in Newport Beach as well. Said Glen 
Everroad, licensing supervisor for the city: "The restaurants use our law as 
justification to increase nonsmoking sections from the 25% (of seating) we 
require to 75% or better." 
</P>
<P>
But San Francisco's assistant director of environmental health, Jack Breslin, 
said he believes people don't report the true number of violations. Starting 
this month, his division assigned an enforcement officer to work full time on 
assessing compliance around the city. "We feel . . . secondhand smoke is 
significant enough a public health issue," Breslin said, "that we want to be 
more proactive."

MORNING BRIEFING: EVEN AMERICAN VIEWERS CAN UNDERSTAND SOCCER

As analyst for TNT's coverage of the World Cup soccer tournament, Mick 
Luckhurst, a former English soccer player, realizes that he won't be speaking 
to a well informed audience. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Luckhurst doesn't believe he'll have to explain much to the American 
public. 
</P>
<P>
"The game of soccer is not a difficult game," Luckhurst told the Baltimore Sun. 
"One team is trying to kick it in one goal, and the other team is trying to 
kick it in the other goal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a very technical game." 
</P>

Add World Cup: How did Argentines react to their team's stunning 1-0 loss to 
Cameroon Friday in the opening game of the tournament? 
</P>
<P>
According to Reuters, grown men whimpered during television interviews or cried 
out in anger on the streets of Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the most humiliating defeat for Argentina in all its World Cup 
history," commentator Antonio Carrizo told his audience on the state-owned 
television station, ATC. "Not only did we lose to Cameroon -- they beat us with 
nine men." 
</P>
<P>
Cameroon ended the game two players short. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who was the last 20-game winner in the California League? 
</P>
<P>
Mistaken Identity: George Lanning has yet to win in seven seasons on the PGA 
Senior Tour. And he did not win on the regular PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
But fans still hound him. 
</P>
<P>
Tall, thin and graying, the left-handed Lanning bears a remarkable resemblance 
to Bob Charles, the New Zealand lefty who has been the player of the year on 
the senior tour in each of the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a lot of autograph requests," Lanning said. "But only because people 
think I'm Bob Charles." 
</P>
<P>
Ignorance is bliss: Ruben Sosa of Uruguay claims not to be bothered by his 
team's ban on sex during the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"When you like football as much as I do, abstaining from sex is not a problem, 
you can overcome that," he said. "But, by the way, what is sex?" 
</P>
<P>
Money talks: Karch Kiraly and Steve Timmons, who led the U.S. men's volleyball 
team to Olympic gold medals at Los Angeles in 1984 and at Seoul in 1988 before 
retiring from the team last year, recently signed contracts that will pay them 
each about $500,000 to play in an Italian indoor league. 
</P>
<P>
"We were as shocked as anyone that they made these offers," Kiraly told USA 
Today. "I've been saying for a long time I wanted to help promote volleyball in 
the United States, and I hate to be thought of as selling out. But I guess they 
found our price."

Look elsewhere, man: Said Steve Gutman, president of the New York Jets: "Mark 
(Gastineau) indicated a desire to return to football. We have no desire for him 
to play here." 
</P>
<P>
Standout: It was more than his height that distinguished 6-foot-10 Randy 
Johnson when the left-hander pitched at USC. 
</P>
<P>
According to Johnson's bio in the 1985 USC baseball press guide: "He's also 
quite a cheerleader. He talks to himself on the mound, frequently runs around 
the infield shouting encouragement to teammates, and congratulates himself for 
good pitches." 
</P>
<P>
Former USC Coach Rod Dedeaux described Johnson as "one of the most colorful 
personalities in college baseball. He always provides an exciting performance." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia Answer: Bob Knepper, who was 20-5 at Fresno in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Said publicist Bob Latford, after Greg Sacks had bashed the right 
side of his Ultra Slim-Fast Chevrolet Lumina into the wall during the Winston 
Open at Charlotte Motor Speedway: "That's the best job of promoting a sponsor 
I've ever seen. He made that car ultra-slim, fast." JERRY CROWE

AMERICA'S CUP: BEFORE A BOAT GOES INTO THE WATER TO DEFEND YACHTING'S MOST 
PRESTIGIOUS TROPHY, FUNDING MUST BE SECURED.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Obsessed is not the word that fits Dennis Conner this particular afternoon. The 
skipper who has passionately devoted much of the past 15 years to winning and 
keeping the America's Cup is relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
Slimmed down and well-tanned, he appears to be anything but someone who has 
spent much of his time recently in corporate offices chasing sponsors for 
another run at the America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
He looks ready to the sail. But the next round of America's Cup races in San 
Diego do not begin until 1992. Circumstances require a different kind of work, 
and a different shade of Dennis Conner. 
</P>
<P>
Leave the competitive aggression and arrogance at the dock. Charm might not win 
a yacht race, but it can work wonders with the big egos of corporate America. 
So if you like the way Conner steers a boat, watch him turn a contract. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to fund-raising, Dennis is a real star," said Thomas Whidden, 
Conner's veteran tactician. "He is a good salesman who exudes confidence. It's 
intoxicating to talk to him about sailing." 
</P>
<P>
To get a sample of the style, consider how Conner conducted an hourlong 
interview in his East San Diego office last week. 
</P>
<P>
Not once did he demonstrate any of the behavior that has earned him labels as 
the winningest America's Cup skipper . . . and its most temperamental. 
</P>
<P>
No personal attacks on rivals. No smug answers. The few mild expletives were 
said with a smile. Not once did he raise his characteristic soft voice. 
</P>
<P>
He was patient. He was pleasant. He was accommodating. He flattered. He talked 
football, basketball and baseball. Turns out he is quite a Padre fan and can 
recite the recent rise and fall of Tony Gwynn's batting average. 
</P>
<P>
And when he found himself touting the talent with his syndicate, he apologized 
for the lapse, lest he sound too full of himself. 
</P>
<P>
Yet under it all, there was this unmistakable confidence, as if he knows 
something the other guys don't. As a veteran of six America's Cup campaigns 
either as skipper or crew member, maybe he does. 
</P>
<P>
While one of his U.S. rivals is staging match races against Danish and New 
Zealand challengers in San Diego Bay, Conner is sailing around Manhattan, home 
to much of corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
On his desk is proof of his trip: a color photo of Conner sailing one of the 
1988 Stars &amp; Stripes catamarans up the East River, its corporate-sponsored 
sails set against the Brooklyn Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
The bridge is still there, but the impression is that Conner sold Wall Street 
something else, perhaps a multimillion-dollar sponsorship. If so, Conner isn't 
saying -- he knows how this game is played, too. Those announcements will be 
saved for this summer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
This is how Conner likes to do the business end of sailing, quietly and 
effectively. 
</P>
<P>
There are at least 30 recognized defender and challenger groups vying to 
compete in the 1992 America's Cup, but there is only one Dennis Conner. 
</P>
<P>
"People like to be associated with a winner," Whidden said, "and no one has won 
more than Dennis." 
</P>
<P>
The first America's Cup races to determine which boat will represent the U.S. 
defense are more than 1 1/2 years off, the finals against a foreign challenger 
nearly two years away. 
</P>
<P>
Conner said he fears the U.S. syndicates already are behind because of the 
two-year court battle with Michael Fay's New Zealand group over the legality of 
the September, 1988, races between Fay's monohull and Conner's catamaran. While 
other countries were preparing challenges, the U.S. effort was tied up in legal 
briefs. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't buy time," Conner said. "It wasn't exactly 'all get on your mark, 
get set, go.' The other guys were already eight miles down a 26-mile marathon. 
They had a one-year head start on a three-year program." 
</P>
<P>
The major delay was in fund-raising, Conner said. Not until the final New York 
court ruling April 26 upholding the defense in a catamaran were the U.S. groups 
able to approach potential donors with certainty. 
</P>
<P>
"Until then, you didn't know if the races were in 1992 or 1993," Conner said. 
"You didn't know if it was in New Zealand or America. You didn't know what time 
the television package was on. You couldn't go to corporate America and ask 
them to sign a check for seven figures with all that uncertainty." 
</P>
<P>
Before then, most of his effort was funded out of his pocket, Conner said. 
Since the decision, the fund-raising has accelerated, Conner said. 
</P>
<P>
Conner has set a budget of $25 million for his defense effort, $8 million more 
than for the successful 1987 campaign. And the impression he presents, without 
being specific, is that corporate America has been receptive. 
</P>
<P>
Conner has not spent all his time knocking on doors. He has reserved his share 
of time on the water, was sailing in San Francisco just last week and plans 
more races later this week in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
But the skipper's cap is but one of the many Conner must wear as the most 
successful and durable sailor in America's Cup history. He must recruit a crew, 
assemble a design team, secure space for a dockside operation, choose a company 
to build the first of three planned boats and the sails to go with them, and, 
maybe most important, find the money to pay for all of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it all because the competition for dollars is just the same as it is on 
the race course," Conner said. "If you win that competition, it is very 
difficult to overcome, because money equates with speed. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have enough money, you can buy the best sails, the best technicians. 
You can buy three boats instead of two. All of that translates to speed on the 
boat. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter how good your sails or sailors are, because with a slow 
boat, you can't win. We found that out in '83 (with the loss to Australia)." 
</P>
<P>
Or as Peter Isler, a former Conner navigator who now has his own San 
Diego-based defense syndicate, said: "There is more to the America's Cup than 
technology and money -- but not much." 
</P>
<P>
With Cup victories in 1980, 1987 and 1988, Conner is not about to change his 
methods: Raise the most money, build the fastest boat, hire the best crew and 
practice, practice, practice. 
</P>
<P>
"That always been the golden rule: He who has the gold makes the rules," Conner 
said. "That's the way it has been in the America's Cup from year one." 
</P>
<P>
But there is at least one sign of some softening in his approach. His 
syndicate, Team Dennis Conner, has been participating in a U.S. effort to pool 
initial design work. Known as Partnership for America's Cup Technology (PACT), 
the group is headed by John Marshall, head of design for Conner's winning 1987 
and 1988 America's Cup campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall said the partnership was formed because of concern that the court 
fight with the New Zealanders had put the U.S. effort behind some other 
countries, and that the change in racing boats from the 12-meter class to a new 
75-foot class (dubbed the International America's Cup Class) would require more 
design work than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The joint venture is something Conner might not have joined, Marshall said, if 
not for the lessons of 1983. Only after that defeat was there a realization 
that it was selfishness and arrogance about their alleged technical superiority 
that might have cost U.S. defenders the Cup, Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
Conner does not yet sound completely convinced about the benefits of the joint 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
"If you share information, you start at the same level," he said. "I'm not sure 
what good that is." 
</P>
<P>
But he is more concerned with the challengers. French, Italian and Japanese 
teams already have launched boats. The first U.S. boat is not expected to be 
ready until early next year. Conner expects the first of his three boats to be 
ready by the spring. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese and Italian teams are particularly well-financed, spending about 
$2 million a month, Conner said. 
</P>
<P>
Both groups have added some of the world's top sailing talent to their 
syndicates. Japan's Nippon Challenge group has signed Chris Dickson, the former 
New Zealand skipper. And the Italians have lured Paul Cayard and several 
members of former Conner crews. 
</P>
<P>
Changing allegiances are part of America's Cup races. Participants can change 
national teams as long as they satisfy a two-year residency requirement with 
their new country. Conner might understand the rule, but it does not mean he 
appreciates the raid on U.S. talent. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like that Paul Cayard and half of my crew is racing for the Italians," 
Conner said. "Whatever we bid, they bid higher. 
</P>
<P>
"But how can you ask a guy not to feed his family?" 
</P>
<P>
No one dares say that any of this is a sign Conner has mellowed, but there are 
some other changes, starting with Conner's appearance. He has shed some 
personal ballast, dropping his weight 35 to 40 pounds to 212 in the past year. 
And while not about to call it a health kick, he does admit to eating smarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I started to eat more fish and chicken and lay off the bread," said Conner, an 
open diet soda on the table in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
He is concentrating more on the Cup than in the past, having sold his drapery 
business last year to the grandson of the woman he bought it from. His office 
remains in the same building. 
</P>
<P>
Common wisdom concludes that by losing the America's Cup to Australia in 1983, 
Conner changed the event forever. 
</P>
<P>
The loss took the event away from the New York Yacht Club, whose stewardship of 
the race, critics charge, had gone stale and made the event an infrequent 
footnote in the world sporting scene. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat moved the race out of Newport, R.I., taking it halfway around the 
world to Fremantle, Australia, in 1987 and then back to San Diego a year later. 
</P>
<P>
More challengers, more television, more worldwide attention, more money, and 
with that, more advertising. That has been the Conner mark on the race. But the 
epitaph might need a few more lines. 
</P>
<P>
The 1992 America's Cup might be his last as a skipper, Conner said, but not the 
end of his involvement. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see a time when I'm not sailing the boats anymore," Conner said. "I'd 
like to do for America's Cup what Roger Penske has done for auto racing. Do 
like a Team Penske, but instead it will be like Team Dennis Conner. That's my 
plan. I want to have the sailors this time so that in 1995 I can be more the 
technical man, and I will have the guys to carry the torch."

RODMAN MIGHT NOT PLAY TODAY; 
</P>
<P>
NBA FINALS: HIS BAD ANKLE GETS WORSE. PISTONS TRY TO END 20-GAME LOSING STREAK 
IN PORTLAND. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bench, long a Detroit Piston luxury, today becomes a necessity for Game 3 
of the NBA finals, just in time to add to the problems heading into Portland 
Memorial Coliseum, the site of a 16-year losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Chuck Daly had all but decided Friday that Dennis Rodman would give way 
to Mark Aguirre in the starting lineup, Rodman's left ankle having worsened 
again. But Saturday, Daly indicated there was a good chance that Rodman, the 
NBA defensive player of the year and irreplaceable on the offensive boards, 
would not play at all today. 
</P>
<P>
No one is sure about future games, either. Rodman has spent the past couple of 
days, since the Trail Blazers' Game 2 overtime victory evened the series, on a 
schedule of ice massages, ultra-sound treatments and anti-inflammation 
medication, but the condition remains so bad that team physician Dr. Benjamin 
Paolucci gave a conditional approval to playing. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was not such an important game, he probably would not play," Paolucci 
said. "That doesn't mean he shouldn't play. 
</P>
<P>
"The injury had improved. He got away all of Game 1 without having to use the 
trampoline to keep the ankle loose. But right now, he's probably back to where 
he was when he first hurt it." 
</P>
<P>
That would have been Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals against Chicago. 
Part of Rodman's treatment then was for all to see -- bouncing lightly on a 
small trampoline during games at the end of the Piston bench. When he jammed 
the ankle again while going for a rebound of his own missed free throw in the 
first quarter Thursday at Auburn Hills, Mich., it was back to the trampoline, 
though sitting on a chair with the left leg bouncing solo. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of the injury was immediate and costly. On Portland's final 
possession of overtime, as Clyde Drexler drove toward the right side of the 
lane, the only defense Rodman had was a hand check on the hip that sent Drexler 
to the free throw line for the two winning shots with 2.1 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him limp off after that," Trail Blazer Coach Rick Adelman said. "But I 
looked at the tape later, and it was the very first step (by Drexler) that beat 
him. That's why he had to put the hand check on, because he wouldn't have 
caught him otherwise. Dennis Rodman normally gets there and gets position. He 
moves his feet so well, but he didn't on that play." 
</P>
<P>
To which Rodman replied: "I think with a healthy Dennis Rodman, we wouldn't 
have been in that position." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, in overtime and in position to lose the game. He finished with 
one point and eight rebounds in 25 minutes, this after playing only 23 minutes 
before fouling out in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
The injury strikes at the heart of Rodman's game, his leaping ability. If there 
is any positive, he should be OK on defense going from side to side and 
backward, Paolucci said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to see the ball coming off the rim and not be able to jump 
for it the way I like," said Rodman, who Saturday estimated his strength at 
75%. 
</P>
<P>
So left to Rodman, how much could he contribute today? 
</P>
<P>
"I will tell you about 30 minutes, but I can't do that. I'm not effective at 
all on the offensive boards." 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre back in the starting lineup would not be such a shock to the Piston 
system if it came at any other time than the day before a big-game situation. 
He started 39 times, after all. 
</P>
<P>
"The adjustment was for me to go to the bench," Aguirre said. "This is not an 
adjustment. This is what I'm used to." 
</P>
<P>
But to have this happen with Rodman limping and Joe Dumars apparently still 
bothered by a groin injury, and concerns escalate. The Pistons base almost all 
their success on team defense, of knowing where the help is around them, so a 
sense of cohesiveness is all important. 
</P>
<P>
Dumars played 41 minutes in Game 2, and Paolucci and trainer Mike Abdenour both 
pronounced him fit Saturday. But the team's second-leading scorer in the 
playoffs wasn't sounding nearly as convincing. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to use it as a crutch," said Dumars, whose 17.5 points-per-game 
average trails only the 19.2 by backcourt partner Isiah Thomas. "That's why I 
don't want to talk about it a lot. It hurts, but it's part of sports. You've 
got to play in pain." 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons have been hurting here since Oct. 19, 1974, a 122-99 victory 
followed by 20 consecutive defeats. The most recent was a 20-point pasting Nov. 
26, when they were held to 30 points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a big deal if you can't win in another building," Daly said. 
"But we've faced that over the years with Boston and L.A. and other teams. 
That's all part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Except that if the Pistons continue to get shut out and lose the next three 
here, the series is over. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to get it back to our building somehow," Daly said. "It might be a 
little difficult though." 
</P>
<P>
Adelman was a bit more direct: "We expect their best shot. If they're not ready 
to play, they could be in trouble."

ITALY IS CELEBRATING WIN OVER AUSTRIA; 
</P>
<P>
GROUP A: HOST TEAM MAKES EVERYONE HAPPY. THEY DOMINATE PLAY IN THEIR FIRST 
GAME, SCORE LATE FOR 1-0 VICTORY.

<TEXT>
<P>
It was a warm, magical night for Italians Saturday. Celebrations radiated from 
newly refurbished Stadio Olympico on the banks of the Tiber River via airwaves, 
phone lines and vocal chords -- We Won! Viva Azzuri! 
</P>
<P>
The Italian national team, laden with the burdens of being both the host 
country for the World Cup and one of the tournament's favorites, opened its 
play with a 1-0 victory over Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Italy and Austria are in Group A, along with Czechoslovakia and the United 
States. Italy's next opponent is the United States, next Thursday in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation that the Italians, who won the World Cup for the third time in 
1982, would collapse under pressure ended for the time being. Instead, the 
young Austrian team was jittery before a capacity crowd of 72,303 flag-waving, 
screaming, singing, stomping Italian fans. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian team was masterful and confident, dribbling and passing past 
Austrians who had never played in a World Cup game. Their basic skill level was 
glaringly below the Italians'. 
</P>
<P>
The game was billed as Italy's defense against Austria's offense. After 
neutralizing Austria's offense -- star forward Toni Polster was stranded time 
and again in front of the goal -- the Italians were left with their own 
inability to score. 
</P>
<P>
For much of the game it seemed the Italian team was going to conduct itself in 
the way of Italy's Cup organizers: complete the task at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
When the score came in the 79th minute, the fans erupted, although they seemed 
near hysteria all day. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Rome itself was more frantic and impassable than usual. Harried taxi 
drivers refused to take fares to the center of the city, which had been overrun 
with soccer enthusiasts in all manner of language and dress. 
</P>
<P>
A large group of red and white-clad Austrian supporters sang rousing songs to 
crowds sunbathing on the Spanish Steps. Italian fans engaged in a good-natured 
battle of the soccer songs. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of mounted police watched, but there were no incidents. Everywhere cars 
bedecked in the red, white and green Italian flag honked horns, and people on 
street corners and in piazzas raised fists in response. 
</P>
<P>
All roads in Rome, it seemed, led to the imposing Olympic Stadium, which had 
been refurbished for $140 million. The stadium opened after negotiation when an 
11th-hour inspection found it lacking in safety, fire and health requirements. 
Faced with postponing the first game, officials in Italy's Interior Ministry 
granted a special dispensation for the match to go on as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
So, with police helicopters overhead and the stands a riot of color, the game 
began. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, Italy was impressive. But, for all their technical prowess, the 
Italians couldn't seem to score. 
</P>
<P>
Concern about the Italian team's emotional well-being grew out of a 354-minute 
scoreless stretch during World Cup warmup matches. 
</P>
<P>
The Italians had at least four first-half opportunities that could have 
resulted in goals, and at least equaled that number in the second. 
</P>
<P>
The goal came after an Austrian defensive breakdown. Italian forward Gianluca 
Vialli took the ball on the right wing and lofted a cross to the middle of the 
field. Salvatore Schillaci out-leaped two defenders and, with a sharp-angled 
header, sent the ball sailing past goaltender Klaus Lindenberger. 
</P>
<P>
Schillaci had come into the game only four minutes before, replacing Andrea 
Carnevale, who had played well but who had been worn down by the game's pace. 
</P>
<P>
Italy out-shot Austria, 20-7. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a few problems opening the score," said Italian Coach Azeglio Vicini. 
"In fact, I think we deserved to score in the first half." 
</P>
<P>
That almost happened in the 22nd minute. The Italians moved the ball with touch 
passes to just outside the penalty area, where it was left for defender Carlo 
Ancelotti. 
</P>
<P>
Ancelotti took the drop pass and sent a hard shot that hit the right post of 
the Austrian goal. 
</P>
<P>
Later, while celebrating the victory, the Italian players didn't seem bothered 
by the misfires. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't always score goals on your first try," said Vialli, laughing. "The 
important thing is to keep trying. Sooner or later you are lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Lucky for Italy that its national soccer team gave it something to cheer about, 
at least for one lovely late spring night. 
</P>

World Cup Notes 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen English soccer fans were charged with criminal damage and resisting 
arrest Saturday battling police in the Sardinian capital of Cagliari. Two more 
English fans, who had been detained in Genoa, were expelled from Italy when 
police found their names on a list of reputed soccer hooligans provided by the 
British government. In the first outbreak of street violence at the World Cup, 
some 40 fans were involved in a confrontation Friday night in Cagliari 
following rowdy scenes at a cafe near the stadium where all three of England's 
Group F first-round World Cup matches will be played. 
</P>
<P>
Naples and Udine on Saturday became the latest World Cup host cities to 
prohibit or restrict the sale of alcoholic beverages on days the soccer matches 
are played. Cagliari has ordered a ban on alcohol sales 36 hours before and 
after each match.

MIKE DOWNEY: U.S. COULD REACH ITS GOAL IF HE PROTECTS IT

"So, what are the latest odds?" Tony Meola asked. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia, by 1 1/2 goals. 
</P>
<P>
"One and a half goals! Geez! I hope they don't score half a goal off me," Meola 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And it's 600 to 1 against the United States winning the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not fair," Meola said. 
</P>
<P>
"What would be fair?" somebody asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, maybe 580 to 1," Meola said. 
</P>
<P>
And it's one to three against the U.S. even scoring. 
</P>
<P>
"One to three we don't score!" 
</P>
<P>
Yeah. Sorry, Tone. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take it," he said. "I would definitely take that if I were you!" 
</P>
<P>
So would his father, a New Jersey barber who played soccer in Italy when he was 
about Tony's age. So would his mother, who still prays before the statue of the 
Madonna on her front lawn in Kearny, N.J. And so would his grandmother, who 
still makes her home in Avellino, just above the ankle of Italy's boot, but had 
no idea until recently that her grandson would be coming to her country for one 
of the world's most prominent sporting events as the starting goalkeeper for 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
They'll keep their hands folded and fingers crossed. He won't be able to. 
</P>
<P>
He is Antonio Michael Meola, he is 21 years old, and he's got the whole World 
Cup in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the United States rests ultimately with Tony Meola -- particularly 
with how he plays today, against the Czechs, in the first and possibly most 
morale-influencing of the three games the Americans will play. One mistake by 
Meola could cost his country advancement to the next round. One goal allowed 
could be one goal too many, shortening the stay of a soccer team that took 40 
years to get here. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't make this out to be some 'Miracle on Ice' kind of deal," Meola 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fair enough. Yet, imagine what the reaction might be back home in the Stati 
Uniti if the youngest team in the World Cup field -- average age, 23 -- 
positioned itself in front of this mere pup of a goalkeeper,somebody 19 years 
younger than England's, and beat the odds. Beat or tied Czechoslovakia. Gave 
the Italians a game to remember in Rome. Beat or tied Austria to reach the 
second round. Imagine it. 
</P>
<P>
Not an Olympic hockey gold medal, maybe, but a moment to capture America's 
imagination, nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine putting an entire sport on the map of your country, four years before 
it plays host to that sport's showcase event for the first time. Imagine being 
a boy of Italian heritage, fluent in the native tongue, able to fulfill a 
lifelong ambition by getting offered a professional contract to come back and 
play with the best. 
</P>
<P>
"I can," Meola said. "I can." 
</P>
<P>
His coach, Bob Gansler, refers to it as: "The challenge of our sporting lives." 
Gansler has no idea if his players are up to this challenge. But he has faith 
in Tony Meola. 
</P>
<P>
It took months to find the right man to put in goal. For a while, the choice 
appeared to be David Vanole, the surfer from Manhattan Beach who kept the 
Americans steady during their World Cup qualifying rounds. Then Vanolne fell 
out of Gansler's good graces and the coach attempted to prod better play from 
Meola by bringing in Kasey Keller, whose presence did more to distract Meola 
than to motivate him. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Meola was reunited with the 225-pound, panda-playful Vanole, 
however, his attitude and his game have brightened considerably. They are 
roommates now. Vanole keeps Meola on his toes, challenges him to the karate 
video game that occupies so much of the players' spare time at their training 
camp near Pisa, argues surfing vs. skiing, rhythm-and-blues vs. Springsteen and 
U-2, anything else he can think of. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always kind of a clown," Vanole said. "I'm the rah-rah guy, loud and 
obnoxious. The coach might not have liked me because of that, but that was 
before he got to know me. Now he kind of eggs me on to do more." 
</P>
<P>
Vanole is there to support Meola -- however and whenever he needs it. 
</P>
<P>
The coaches know Meola has the necessary cool. Gansler, trying and failing to 
detect stage fright in Meola, finally came to a conclusion. "Hey," he said, 
"this kid's got ice water." 
</P>
<P>
And, as a big day in the life of American soccer approached, there was no 
indication anything had changed. Meola looked cool, his shaggy hair cascading 
down his neck. Meola sounded cool, laughing at the long odds, kiddingly asking 
a sportswriter to get a bet down for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw where the odds on us winning the World Cup were 600 to 1 or something," 
Meola said. "Hey, pretty encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
Uh, not really, Tone. 
</P>
<P>
"No, the odds have probably gone down," he said. "OK, OK, I'm kidding. We're 
the serious underdogs. How can you possibly put the odds any lower on us when 
we've never won anything in soccer, ever? 
</P>
<P>
"But let me tell you something. This team has already surprised a few people. 
This team has already been more successful than any American team ever has. 
Don't put anything past this team. 
</P>
<P>
"The heart of our team is our defense. I don't know too many teams in the world 
that can score two goals against us. If we're going to win, we're going to win 
with defense. I want to see us win this first game 1-0, and I won't be 
satisfied with anything less." 
</P>
<P>
No? 
</P>
<P>
"No!" Meola said. "Well, OK, unless maybe it's 2 to 1." 
</P>
<P>
Bet on this: 
</P>
<P>
He'd even take 2 to 1 1/2.

Colombia struggled for the first half before coming through with South American 
flair and superb goals by Bernardo Redin and Carlos Valderrama on Saturday to 
beat the United Arab Emirates, 2-0, in a World Cup first-round game in Group D. 
</P>
<P>
Redin ended Colombia's frustration in the 50th minute when he headed home a 
pinpoint pass from Leonel Alvarez following one of the first smooth Colombian 
moves in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Five minutes from the end, Valderrama took on the UAE defense on his own after 
a pass from Carlos Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
He beat a defender and sent a low 20-yard drive out of the reach of goalie 
Mushin Faraj. 
</P>
<P>
Colombia also needed some good goalkeeping from the flashy Rene Higuita to keep 
UAE striker Adnan Khamees Al Taliyani from scoring his country's first World 
Cup goal. 
</P>
<P>
The longshot UAE kept up with Colombia during the first half with slick 
combination plays and fast counterattacks, but failed to pressure Colombia once 
it trailed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was completely even in the first half," said UAE Coach Carlos Alberto 
Parreira. "It was perfect for us." 
</P>
<P>
The UAE retreated quickly on defense and tried to slow down the game to 
frustrate the Colombians. Colombia's first shot on goal was Redin's successful 
header. 
</P>
<P>
After Redin's goal, the UAE could not keep up. When the Emirates pushed men 
forward, it only gave Valderrama more room to show off his dribbling skills. He 
capped his performance with a brilliant goal, taking the ball just over the 
midfield line, dribbling to the penalty area, faking one defender and blasting 
in his right-footed shot.

Marius Lacatus scored both goals and Romania controlled the second half to 
upset the Soviet Union, 2-0, Saturday in the World Cup opener for both. 
</P>
<P>
Lacatus, the leader of his team's attack, scored the first goal in the 41st 
minute on a blistering shot from eight yards out to the right side of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
His second came on a penalty kick in the 54th minute after Soviet defender 
Vagiz Khidyatulin was ruled to have handled the ball in the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second upset in what has become a wide-open Group B. On Friday, 
defending champion Argentina was stunned by Cameroon, 1-0, in the World Cup 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
Romania and the Soviets began cautiously Saturday, playing tight defense before 
a crowd of about 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
The game's first chance came early, when Soviet striker Oleg Protassov failed 
to beat Romanian goalie Silviu Lung from five yards. Lung later made two 
dazzling saves that kept the match scoreless and perhaps instilled confidence 
in his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
In the 35th minute, Protasov and Alexander Zavarov combined on a give-and-go 
that left Zavarov alone 12 yards from the goal. But Lung rushed out to punch 
the shot away. Two minutes later, Zavarov set up Sergei Aleinikov in the 
penalty area, and Lung again turned aside the shot. 
</P>
<P>
In the 41st minute, Lacatus scored for Romania. Midfielder Ioan Sabau fed him 
the ball deep in the Soviet defense. He dribbled past one defender and drilled 
the ball past goalie Rinat Dassaev. 
</P>
<P>
Dassaev said he was trying to anticipate the shot. 
</P>
<P>
"If I hadn't thought so much about where the ball was going, perhaps I would 
have been able to punch it out," he said.

PAUL GONZALES FINALLY GETS CHANCE TO WIN A PRO TITLE

<P>
The last time Paul Gonzales was supposed to fight for an important 
championship, he won without lifting a glove. 
</P>
<P>
His opponent, Salvatore Todisco of Italy, didn't show up for the gold medal 
bout in the light flyweight division of the 1984 Olympic Games because his 
broken thumb was in a cast. 
</P>
<P>
It won't be so easy for Gonzales this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The slick boxer, voted the most outstanding fighter in the Olympics in his 
hometown, finally gets a chance to win a world professional title when he 
challenges International Boxing Federation bantamweight champion Orlando 
Canizales. (2 p.m., Channel 4, delayed). 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales (14-2) won a unanimous decision over Canizales three years ago in Lake 
Tahoe, but is the underdog in the rematch. 
</P>
<P>
One reason is that he hasn't fought since Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, injuries and managerial troubles have limited him to only 16 fights 
since the glory that was Los Angeles six summers ago. 
</P>
<P>
His business relationship with former policeman Al Stankie soured after more 
than one TV movie had been in the works about the Primera Flats gangster and 
the cop who took him out of the streets and into the Hollenbeck gym. 
</P>
<P>
"We no longer work together, but I love Al," Gonzales said. "I always will. 
We're still like father and son. He's got his crazy ways, but we still talk all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old challenger, who will be paid $30,000 today, now manages 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
He has worked out the past two months at the Dame Boxing Club in Los Angeles, 
run by ex-State Athletic Commission official Marty Denkin. 
</P>
<P>
"I like what I've seen of him in the gym," Denkin said. "He's stronger now and 
he doesn't get hit so easily with the right hand." 
</P>
<P>
Canizales was able to knock Gonzales down in the first fight, a briskly paced 
12-rounder waged outdoors on a hot afternoon at the flyweight limit of 112 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Canizales (24-1-1) hasn't lost since. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be a tough fight, no doubt," Gonzales said after a light workout 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"But this time I'll fight my fight. I'll out-think him, I'll out-box him. There 
won't be any need for a slugfest."

Georgia Coach Steve Webber had a surprise for Oklahoma State in the College 
World Series title game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Stan Payne, an unexpected starter, and ace Dave Fleming combined to 
restrict the Cowboys to five hits, leading Georgia to a 2-1 victory for its 
first national championship. 
</P>
<P>
The loss made the Cowboys a loser in the title game for a record fifth time. 
</P>
<P>
The game at Rosenblatt Stadium drew 16,482, a record for the title game. The 
previous mark was 16,071 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody gave us a chance," said Georgia catcher Terry Childers, who had two of 
the Bulldogs' six hits. "I think it helped us relax. We were loose. Once we got 
the lead our confidence seemed to soar. Stan had a great breaking ball." 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs (52-19) became the first team from Georgia or the Southeastern 
Conference to win the College World Series. Two SEC teams -- Alabama in 1983 
and Tennessee in 1951 -- lost in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma State (56-17) entered the championship game having outscored its 
opponents, 35-8, in three College World Series victories. The Cowboys were 
hitting .390. 
</P>
<P>
"Oklahoma State is a great team, as you saw through the first few games of the 
series, but we were just fortunate enough today to have two great pitchers and 
stopped their hitters," Webber said. 
</P>
<P>
Payne (7-1), a left-hander, limited the Cowboys to four hits in six innings. 
Fleming gave up one hit over the final three innings, dropping Oklahoma State's 
batting average to .349, still a tournament record. The previous record was 
.347 by Arizona State's 1977 national champions. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs loaded the bases with none out in the fourth inning when Jeff 
Cooper walked, J.R. Showalter blooped a single to right-center and Brian Jester 
was hit by a Dennis Burbank pitch. Bruce Chick's sacrifice fly drove in Cooper, 
but Burbank (10-2) struck out Doug Radziewicz and got Ray Suplee to ground out. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia scored what turned out to be the winning run in the fifth inning when 
Childers singled and went to third base on McKay Smith's double. Cooper's 
single drove in Childers. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma State scored its only run in the sixth when Mitchel Simons and Brad 
Beanblossom singled and Michael Daniel hit a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys also lost in the 1961, 1966, 1981 and 1987 title games. They won 
their only championship in 1959.

IT WILL BE NEW EXPERIENCE FOR AGASSI OR GOMEZ

It's Andre vs. Andres in the French Open final today, a matchup of Andre Agassi 
of Las Vegas and Andres Gomez of Ecuador, two players with very different 
senses of timing. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, 30, the oldest player in the men's draw, is a veteran of 27 Grand Slam 
tournaments, but will be making his first Grand Slam final appearance. Agassi, 
20, is in his first Grand Slam final in his ninth Grand Slam tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Not since the 1981 Australian Open final between Johan Kriek and Steve Denton 
has there been a Grand Slam final between two players who have never been in 
one before. 
</P>
<P>
"He isn't that old," Agassi said of Gomez. "He is in the same situation as me 
for being in the final of a Grand Slam tournament, so experience doesn't count. 
It will be a question of who outplays who." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez is a left-hander and no left-hander has won the French Open since 
Guillermo Vilas in 1977. Also, no Ecuadorian has ever been in a Grand Slam 
final, although Pancho Segura reached four U.S. Championship semifinals from 
1942-45. 
</P>
<P>
But trivia aside, Gomez has established points in his favor through the sheer 
power of his tennis. To get to the final, he lost only one set in six matches. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez has 30 aces in five matches and has won 76% of the points on his serve. 
In the semifinals, Gomez out-hit slugging Austrian Thomas Muster and had nine 
aces. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Muster was less than thrilled with the prospects of Gomez when asked 
about the final. 
</P>
<P>
"If Agassi plays nearly like he has been playing the whole two weeks, then I 
think he will win," Muster said. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi has 10 singles titles, six of them in 1988 when he basically came out of 
nowhere to end the year ranked No. 3 in the world. He slumped to No. 7 last 
year when he won just one tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to be motivated," Agassi said of 1989. "I didn't want to come 
back the next day if I won. I was just fried. In my mind, my year was over in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of pressure, plus the expectations of people and the 
expectations I put on myself," he said. "I had a lot of growing up to do. I 
still do. But if I'm in for another bad series of feelings, of bad tournaments 
and stuff, I'm better prepared to handle it." 
</P>
<P>
Agassi will go over the $2-million mark in earnings here, already assured of 
$185,000 for reaching the final. Either Gomez or Agassi will earn $370,000 for 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
"I am out there to win it and I will do what I have do do," Agassi said.

It's over now, a 14-year-old's assault on the City of Light that extended well 
beyond the clay tennis courts at Roland Garros Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Capriati took the town by storm and quickly became a crowd favorite. 
She reached the semifinals of her first Grand Slam, where she lost to Monica 
Seles, and was called "La petite Jennifer" in the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Little Jennifer made sure she had a big time off the courts, too. 
</P>
<P>
She and her family stayed at a hotel just off the Champs-Elysees near the Arc 
de Triomphe. Their favorite restaurant was Pizza Vesuvio, just around the 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
Shopping meant suede and leather in shops along the Champs. As Jennifer tried 
on a pair of shoes in one store, a man walked in and proposed to her. Jennifer 
looked him up and down, then said: "No way!" 
</P>
<P>
The Capriatis arrived at Angelina's, opposite the Tuileries on Rue de Rivoli, 
but were turned away because it was two minutes before closing, thus missing 
out on the world's best hot chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer and her 10-year-old brother, Steven, visited Notre Dame for the 
benefit of an ESPN crew. Jennifer and Steven were read passages from Victor 
Hugo's book, "The Hunchback of Notre Dame." Steven could relate, pointing out 
there is now a video game featuring a Hunchback. 
</P>
<P>
When they arrived at Notre Dame on the Isle de Cite, Jennifer and Steven looked 
quizzically at one another and said, almost at the same time, "Where's the 
football field?" 
</P>
<P>
Then they stopped outside Les Invalides, a vast building erected in the 1670s 
by Louis XIV as a home for old soldiers. It is also the final resting place for 
Napoleon, or "the little dead dude," as Jennifer said. 
</P>
<P>
Steven was impressed with the place because he recognized it from the movie 
"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure." Mary Carillo of ESPN has since dubbed 
Capriati's French Open experience "Jennifer Capriati's Excellent Adventure." 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer's new favorite song, by the way, is MC Hammer's "You Can't Touch 
This," which somehow seems appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Out-on-the-limb Dept.: From Monica Seles, assessing quarterfinal opponent 
Manuela Maleeva, whose sisters Katerina and Magdalena are also tennis pros: 
"Manuela is certainly one of the best of the Maleeva sisters." 
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon update: Last week, Boris Becker began hitting with Coach Bob Brett on 
the practice courts on the Wimbledon site, the All England Club. Within 15 
minutes, a security guard escorted them out of the club. 
</P>
<P>
Becker had violated a rule that All England Club members could play only with 
other club members. Becker, a three-time Wimbledon champion, is an honorary 
member, but Brett is not. 
</P>
<P>
British press reports indicated that Becker was not amused. 
</P>
<P>
Mad Mac? London's Daily Mirror reported that John McEnroe has confessed to 
being a "maniac," thus confirming the suspicions of his longtime antagonists in 
the British sporting public. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe is quoted in an updated biography -- "John McEnroe, Taming the Talent" 
-- written by British author Richard Evans: 
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious I have a problem and I need help. I'm seriously thinking about 
quitting for good. I just don't know if I can go on like this. I'm worried what 
I might do on the court." 
</P>
<P>
They will see for themselves at Wimbledon. Citing a shoulder injury, McEnroe 
has withdrawn from six tournaments since last playing in February, but he is 
still in the field for Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
Unemployment line: Gabriela Sabatini, who lost to Jana Novotna in the French 
Open round of 16, has fired coach Angel Gimenez. 
</P>
<P>
Who's on first: Selection of the U.S. Davis Cup team that will play Austria in 
the semifinals in September is sure to be even more controversial than usual. 
</P>
<P>
Captain Tom Gorman has not yet asked anyone to play, which isn't making at 
least one potential candidate very happy. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom's been kind of wishy-washy about it," Aaron Krickstein said. "If he wants 
me to play, I think he should name the team by the end of the tournament so I 
can plan my schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein, who won both his matches against Czechoslovakia in the 
quarterfinals, may not be among Gorman's first choices. Speculation centers on 
Michael Chang, if Gorman can persuade him to play, and Andre Agassi, if Gorman 
can end their squabble. 
</P>
<P>
The doubles team is likely to be Rick Leach and Jim Pugh, although clay is not 
their best surface. They lost in the third round of the French Open and in the 
first round last year. 
</P>
<P>
The team of Jim Grabb and Patrick McEnroe is a distant possibility. Last year's 
French Open doubles champions, they lost in the semifinals Thursday.

A longshot at Philadelphia Park overcame the toughest odds of all Friday. He 
won the race a half-hour after it was run. 
</P>
<P>
Snaps Lewin, at odds of 42-1, and Shinto Magic, at 8-1, ran to a photo finish 
in the sixth race. Shinto Magic was posted as the winner, with Snaps Lewin in 
second. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty minutes later, track officials realized they had made a mistake and gave 
the victory to Snaps Lewin. 
</P>
<P>
There was quite a turnaround in payoffs. Shinto Magic paid $18.60 as the posted 
winner. Snaps Lewin's payoff was $86.20. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the confusion, the track immediately agreed to honor tickets showing 
either order of finish. 
</P>
<P>
"They made a decision to rectify their mistake, and, whatever the consequences, 
they'll pay for it," said Ed Murano, publicity director for the track. 
</P>
<P>
The consequences are sure to be very expensive. Although Murano said figures on 
the total payout and number of win tickets won't be available for some time, 
the mistake figured to cost the track thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Shinto Magic paid $7.80 to place and $7.40 to show on both the original and the 
corrected posting. Snaps Lewin paid $26 to place on both tickets. On the 
original posting, the show payoff was $12; on the corrected one, $12.20.

LAST OF CONTRAS START TO DISARM ON DEADLINE 
</P>

EL ALMENDRO, Nicaragua 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Declaring the Contra war over, President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro disarmed 
and embraced rebel field commanders Saturday at the start of a mass surrender 
of weapons by the remainder of their army. 
</P>
<P>
"I always dreamed of the day the war between Nicaraguans would end," Chamorro 
said in a speech to several thousand rebel soldiers. "Today my dream has come 
true." 
</P>
<P>
In the grass-covered square of this farming center, the rebels stood in 
formation with their weapons for the visit by Chamorro, who achieved in last 
February's election what their U.S.-backed army had failed to do in eight years 
of fighting -- overthrow the revolutionary Sandinista government. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony came on the eve of today's disarmament deadline, which had been 
set in an April 19 armistice pact between the new president and rebel leaders. 
Turning her visit into something of a victory celebration, the rebels said they 
intend to meet the deadline by disarming their remaining 7,000 fighters during 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, Chamorro said she will unveil this week a promised plan for reducing 
the national army, still dominated by Sandinista officers and the largest in 
Central America. Together, she said, the two events will launch "a true era of 
peace that will consolidate our democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Rebel commander Israel Galeano, who spoke from the same platform, said his men 
were disarming "to show the world that we are not the problem in Nicaragua." 
Wearing a hat that read, "44 Magnum: God's Favorite Caliber," he added: 
"Nicaragua has no enemies. It no longer needs an army." 
</P>
<P>
Galeano said 5,000 to 7,000 former guerrillas will stick together under his 
leadership as pioneer farmers in El Almendro to become "a productive force in a 
new society." 
</P>
<P>
El Almendro, a rural municipality of 14,000 farmers in the southeastern corner 
of Nicaragua, is one of seven cease-fire zones where rebels have gathered since 
April under the supervision of U.N. peacekeeping troops. 
</P>
<P>
The government agreed May 30 to build new farm colonies for former rebels in El 
Almendro and to let them form a 300-member police force for the 14,400-acre 
resettlement area. The accord, which satisfied the rebels' security concerns, 
ended a crisis that had slowed the demobilization to a trickle. 
</P>
<P>
As of Friday, 7,882 rebels -- just over half the army -- had disarmed, about 
6,000 of them in the last 10 days. Meantime, all but a few hundred of those 
remaining in the other cease-fire zones were trucked to El Almendro in 
olive-green Soviet-made Zils, driven and escorted by Sandinista soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
"This relaxed the tension between the two armies," said Gen. Agustin Quesada, 
the Spanish commander of the 700 U.N. troops in Nicaragua. "They began to speak 
to each other as Nicaraguans." 
</P>
<P>
Quesada said he had enough men here and in the other zones to collect weapons 
from all the remaining guerrillas by the end of today. U.N. troops were busy 
Saturday cutting surrendered rifles in two with welders' torches. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinista newspaper, Barricada, acknowledged in an editorial Saturday that 
"a real process of demobilization" was under way and expressed confidence that 
it will be finished on time. But the paper complained about "questionable and 
even unpardonable concessions" by Chamorro, including the rebels' police force 
and their representation in four government ministries dealing with 
resettlement. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Sandinistas appear ready to meet their end of the April peace 
agreement. On Thursday the army's Sandinista commander, Gen. Humberto Ortega, 
handed Chamorro his proposal for reducing its budget and manpower, which stood 
at 90,000 troops before the February election. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's ceremony was the biggest event in the 110-year history of this 
former rubber plantation town. Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the country's 
Roman Catholic leader, arrived in gold robes and a red cap to say Mass from a 
covered flatbed truck. Bianca Jagger arrived in a black pantsuit to shoot a 
documentary for British television. 
</P>
<P>
"We're so isolated. Nobody ever visited," said Geronimo Vargas, 39, director of 
the town infirmary. 
</P>
<P>
The Contras chose El Almendro as the site of their colony because the 
Sandinista-led army had virtually abandoned it and because the people here 
support them. The town's voters favored Chamorro 2,306 to 535 over former 
Sandinista President Daniel Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
"We're proud to have them here," Vargas said as he watched armed Contras gather 
in the square. "They're well-behaved. They don't abuse anyone. It's a pleasure 
to share what little we have with them." 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Julio Barrios, a Contra sympathizer, said the rebels had disrupted 
their quiet lives with frequent bursts of recreational gunfire to run down 
their ammunition stocks. 
</P>
<P>
"The nights are horrible," he said. "They've given us war psychosis." 
</P>
<P>
Besides their Soviet-made AK-47 assault rifles, many of the Contras had 
fearsome looks. They include the most battle-hardened soldiers of the rebel 
army -- those who most fear reprisals by Sandinista enemies if they return to 
their native towns and villages. 
</P>
<P>
One veteran, nicknamed "Caballito," or Little Horse, led a famous rebel 
operation that seized La Trinidad, a town on the Pan American Highway, in 1984. 
The Sandinistas claimed several times to have killed him, but Caballito lived 
to fight nine years inside Nicaragua -- not once retreating, he said, to base 
camps in Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
As he stood in formation Saturday, Caballito sported black hair halfway down 
his back and a braided beard hanging to his chest. He said he once swore to God 
never to cut his hair until the war was over. 
</P>
<P>
Asked when he planned to get a haircut, the 36-year-old fighter said not yet. 
"I got a letter from my mother and my wife 15 days ago," he explained. "They 
live in Jinotega. They said it would be wise for me to stay where I am, because 
the Sandinistas still exist there. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot be satisfied that the war is over until I can go home," he said. "I 
have fulfilled my commitment in this war, but I don't have my freedom yet." 
</P>
<P>
While expressing similar fears, many rebels said they were celebrating victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we have fulfilled our commitment to liberate Nicaragua," a rebel calling 
himself "Cuerito" said in a speech opening the ceremony. He thanked the 
president for "her noble work in participating in this holy struggle" against 
the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
After Mass, 24 field commanders -- the rebels' entire second-level hierarchy -- 
lined up to present their AK-47s and Browning automatic pistols to Chamorro. 
Six of them did so, each receiving a presidential embrace in return, before a 
midday thunderstorm interrupted the event. 
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials said Saturday night that 1,460 Contras handed over their weapons 
during the day, 858 of them in El Almendro. That left more than 5,000 still 
armed. Galeano said he and his five-man general staff would surrender their 
weapons last. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an irreversible process," said Max Rodriguez Martinez, the field 
commander known as Wilmer who was the first to be disarmed by Chamorro. She 
kissed him just below a recent bullet wound on his right cheek.

YOUNG WOOING WHITE VOTERS IN GOVERNOR RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
EASTMAN, Ga. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
History is an uninvited guest in Andrew Young's campaign for the Georgia 
governorship. 
</P>
<P>
It was not many years ago that Young, as a lieutenant to Dr. Martin Luther King 
Jr., came to rural towns like this one as inconspicuously as possible. Last 
week, he roared into Eastman in a huge van emblazoned with his campaign posters 
and bumper stickers. 
</P>
<P>
That was exactly the transformation of Southern life that Young and other civil 
rights leaders envisioned as they fought the system, throughout the 1960s, to 
dismantle the barriers that kept blacks from voting. His current campaign 
represents a major step toward validating that faith that all doors eventually 
would open once the polls did. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Young leaves others to draw such historic conclusions from his 
candidacy. In speeches to both an integrated audience in nearby Ft. Valley and 
an all-white Lions and Rotary luncheon here, he mentioned only fleetingly and 
obliquely his years with King. He emphasized his two terms as mayor of Atlanta 
and promised to seed the rest of the state with office towers like those that 
now crowd the city's skyline. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not denying any of my heritage . . . but the jury is still out on civil 
rights for a lot of people," Young said in an interview during a break from a 
long day of campaigning. "That's not the issue on which I'm running for 
election." 
</P>
<P>
Yet however Young may try to focus his audiences' attention on his vision of 
international companies relocating in the Georgia countryside, he cannot escape 
what has become, in virtually everyone's mind here, the central question of his 
campaign: Will Georgians accept a black man as governor? 
</P>
<P>
That dominant issue frames only one dimension of the political evolution taking 
place here. Many politicians also are asking if Georgia could elect a 
Republican governor, a prospect that once would have been considered not much 
more likely than electing a black. 
</P>
<P>
These cross pressures could make this a pivotal election for the biracial 
Democratic coalition that has controlled state-level politics here, as in most 
of the Deep South, since the fall of segregation. 
</P>
<P>
From one side, the dominant Democratic alliance is being squeezed by a 
Republican Party blossoming in the rapidly growing suburbs of Atlanta and the 
state's other major cities. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats consider state House Minority Leader Johnny Isakson, the front-runner 
for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, the most serious GOP contender in 
more than two decades. Though Republicans have not elected a governor here 
since Reconstruction, the moderate (he supports a woman's right to abortion) 
Isakson exudes confidence. "The forces at work in Georgia are such that it is 
not a matter of if, it is a matter of when you elect a Republican (governor)," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
From the other side, Young's candidacy challenges one of the Democratic 
coalition's unspoken tenets. Though blacks have made enormous gains in 
lower-ballot offices in Southern states since passage of the Voting Rights Act 
25 years ago, the white majority has maintained a stranglehold on the powerful 
positions. No black has been nominated -- much less elected -- to one of the 
statewide constitutional offices in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
As more and more whites shift their loyalty to the GOP and black votes become 
that much more essential to Democratic success, that pattern is coming under 
pressure -- not only here but all across the South. Last year, L. Douglas 
Wilder was elected the first black governor in Virginia, and became only the 
second Southern black to hold statewide office. 
</P>
<P>
In North Carolina last Tuesday, a black Democrat, former Charlotte Mayor Harvey 
Gantt, won his party's U.S. Senate nomination. State Sen. Theo W. Mitchell, a 
black, is seeking the South Carolina Democratic gubernatorial nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is Young the only black Democrat to run for statewide office in Georgia. 
State Sen. Al Scott is one of three serious candidates for a spot on the Public 
Service Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"The underlying push driving all this right now is that the Democrats are a 
biracial party, in which black influence is on the rise," said Merle Black, a 
professor of politics at Emory University here. 
</P>
<P>
The potential for conflict created by that shifting balance was underscored 
last month, when 24 black politicians and civil rights leaders filed a lawsuit 
seeking to overturn the state's runoff primary. Georgia and eight other 
Southern states require that the top two finishers in a primary compete in a 
runoff if no candidate wins a majority. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats contend the rule ensures that the strongest nominee wins, but some 
blacks say it unfairly denies nominations to minority candidates who can win a 
plurality in the first round of an interracial primary but fail when white 
voters unite behind the remaining white candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Many here believe that Young could face just such a scenario. He is ahead in 
polls for the July 17 gubernatorial primary, but is extremely unlikely to win 
enough votes to avoid a runoff with one of his four white opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming that black voters cast between one-fourth and one-third of the votes, 
and that Young holds nearly all of them, strategists in the race say he would 
still need 30% or more of the white vote to win a runoff -- a tall order even 
with the gains he appears to be making in such appearances as those in Eastman. 
Without the runoff requirement, he would be more likely to win the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Young joined in similar litigation 19 years ago, but denounces the current 
lawsuit. A runoff against a single white candidate might disadvantage him, he 
said, but it would be even more dangerous to his candidacy "to have Democrats 
bolt and go Republican (in the general election) because they don't feel 
comfortable with me. Sooner or later, you've got to face the white majority, 
and for me, the sooner the better." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Gantt's contest last week proved that a runoff is not an 
insurmountable obstacle to a black candidate in the South. He had narrowly 
missed garnering the 40% of the vote required to win the initial primary, then 
won Tuesday's runoff with a comfortable margin of votes in a low turnout. 
</P>
<P>
Young's chilly attitude toward the litigation is typical of his campaign style. 
He says nothing that could unsettle a white audience. Although Lt. Gov. Zell 
Miller and other Democratic contenders have warned that race relations in the 
state are deteriorating, Young said in Ft. Valley: "Georgia is the place where 
people get along better with more differences than any other place on the 
planet." 
</P>
<P>
If such remarks reflect Young's own larger perspective on the passage from Jim 
Crow to racial coexistence, most observers here believe they also suggest the 
lengths to which he will go to ameliorate the deep fear among many whites that 
his winning the nomination would shift the balance of power to blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"You got a lot of traditions you're going against in Georgia," said Walter L. 
Daniel, the smooth young executive director of the Eastman/Dodge County Chamber 
of Commerce, as Young mingled in an integrated group of businessmen. "The 
(black and white) communities get along well, but everybody kind of knows where 
the lines are drawn. You would have to break traditions that go back 
generations" for Young to win. 
</P>
<P>
Although some black leaders accuse Young of neglecting his base, he is 
virtually guaranteed enough black votes to put him in a runoff. If the election 
were held now, he would most likely face Lt. Gov. Miller, the best-financed and 
most liberal white contender. 
</P>
<P>
Miller has offered the most aggressive and specific proposals of the Democrats: 
a state lottery to pay for increased spending on schools, "boot camps" for 
young drug offenders, a rollback of auto insurance rates, enhanced sex 
education intended to reduce the pregnancy rate among teen-agers. He has also 
criticized Young's record on controlling crime in Atlanta. He says it is 
"misleading" for the former mayor to promise that he can substantially redirect 
development into economically stagnant rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
After 16 years as lieutenant governor and 30 years in state government, the 
silver-haired Miller may have trouble convincing the voters he is the man to 
execute change. "That is difficult, with some of the ones who don't keep up 
with politics and government regularly," he acknowledged as he shook hands 
outside a coffee shop in Augusta. "They see me as part of the same old crowd." 
</P>
<P>
The strongest challenger among the other Democratic candidates appears to be 
Roy Barnes, a moderately conservative state senator who supports tightening 
restrictions on abortion. Barnes has pointedly jabbed at the lieutenant 
governor over his support for the lottery, and at Young for his environmental 
record as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes' problem is that state Rep. Lauren (Bubba) McDonald and former Gov. 
Lester Maddox (who promises voters fed up with the capital crowd that he will 
be "your Ex-Lax in state government"), although lagging in the polls, will also 
siphon off conservative votes. 
</P>
<P>
Even that analysis implies more cohesion than the race has yet acquired. At a 
candidate forum in Macon last week, the overwhelming impression was one of 
candidates struggling to find divergence and mostly failing. To most voters, 
"it's still kind of fuzzy," Miller acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
In any of these candidate gatherings, Young stands out -- and not only because 
of his color. 
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. representative and ambassador to the United Nations is simply 
an unusual politician. He is often vague, sometimes distant and distracted, at 
other times homey, and disarmingly quirky. 
</P>
<P>
His plans for education include pressuring the news media to write about "one 
good thing a week in our schools." In explaining to the Ft. Valley Chamber of 
Commerce how he would get businesses to move there, he stressed not education 
and infrastructure, the usual litany of New South governors, but how much less 
it costs to play golf and tennis in Georgia than it does in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
And he is defiantly unafraid of telling people he doesn't have answers to their 
questions. Not the least of those is whether he can raise enough money and 
attract enough white votes to become the Deep South's first black governor. 
Young faces a steep climb, but despite his reluctance to be seen as a symbol, 
few observers here doubt that Young is pointing the way to a new era in Georgia 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
If he falls short, Young said softly between stops in Eastman, it doesn't mean 
that blacks cannot win the highest offices here. 
</P>
<P>
"It just means I didn't run a good enough campaign."

WHAT'S AHEAD FOR THE PROPOSITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California voters on Tuesday approved 15 propositions that will shape the state 
for years to come. Among other decisions, they approved a gasoline tax increase 
and voted in favor of issuing $5 billion worth of bonds to benefit 
transportation, schools, prisons and housing. Here is an explanation of each 
proposition and, to the extent now known, what lies ahead as they move toward 
implementation. 
</P>
<P>
MEASURE: * Proposition 107: This measure authorizes the state to sell $150 
million in general obligation bonds to help low-income first-time home buyers 
($25 million); to finance low-income rental units ($100 million); to restore 
residential hotels ($15 million); and to add beds in homeless shelters ($10 
million). 
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP: Although the bonds can be sold almost immediately, the state 
agencies involved must first announce the availability of the money and then 
sort through competing proposals, from mortgage lenders, local governments, and 
nonprofit agencies, for spending it. The process could take months. 
</P>
<P>
MEASURE: * Proposition 108: This authorizes the state to issue $1 billion in 
general obligation bonds to pay for the construction of rail systems. At least 
15% of the total money raised must be spent for intercity rail construction. 
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP: Caltrans said it would be 18 months before any improvements are seen 
because regional transportation agencies must submit proposals to the 
California Transportation Commission, which sets priorities for projects. 
</P>
<P>
MEASURE: * Proposition 109: This measure will increase from 12 days to 30 days 
the time that the governor has to sign or veto bills after the first year of 
the legislative session. The governor was allowed 30 days only after the entire 
two-year session. 
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP: The new law takes effect in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
MEASURE: * Proposition 110: This measure gives the Legislature authority to 
extend a special break on property taxes to severely disabled homeowners 
regardless of age. When moving to a higher-valued home, they will be allowed 
the tax rate paid on their previous residence. The tax break, which is 
permitted on moves within counties or to a county that allows such transfers, 
already applies to homeowners 55 or older. 
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP: The measure cannot take effect until the Legislature agrees on who 
qualifies as disabled and passes enacting legislation. 
</P>
<P>
MEASURE: * Proposition 111: This measure increases gasoline taxes by 9 cents a 
gallon over the next five years to pay for a variety of transportation-related 
expenses. It also modifies the state spending limit to permit additional 
government spending. 
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP: California motorists will begin paying an additional 
5-cents-per-gallon tax on Aug. 1. Gas taxes will also go up 1 cent per gallon a 
year in January 1991-1994. A 40% increase in truck weight fees also becomes 
effective Aug. 1. The state will begin collecting another 10% on Jan. 1, 1991. 
The California Transportation Commission will be asked in July to authorize 
$257 million in backlogged highway projects in anticipation of new revenue. 
Over the next year Caltrans is expected to collect about $635 million from the 
increased gas tax and truck weight fees. The increases in the spending limit 
will amount to about $800 million the first year. 
</P>
<P>
MEASURE: * Proposition 112: This requires the governor to appoint a 
seven-member salary commission that will decide on the level of compensation to 
be received by legislators, the governor and other elected state officials. In 
addition, it imposes a variety of new ethical standards on state officials. The 
proposition also prohibits legislators and state officials who leave office 
from lobbying their former colleagues for 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP: The governor has 30 days to appoint the salary commission and the 
commission has until Dec. 3 to reach its conclusions. A ban on honorariums 
takes effect Dec. 3, and conflict-of-interest penalties take effect on Jan. 1, 
1991. The lobbying provisions take effect for most officials on Jan. 1, 1991. 
And since June 6, the Legislature has been required to hold most of its 
meetings in public. 
</P>
<P>
MEASURE: * Proposition 113: The measure requires the state to begin the renewal 
of chiropractors' licenses on the last day of their birth month instead of on 
Jan. 1 of each year. It increases penalties for unlicensed practice to $750 and 
six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP: The state board has until July 1, 1991, to implement the new 
licensing plan. The increased penalties went into effect on June 6. 
</P>
<P>
MEASURE: * Proposition 114: This measure broadens the definition of "peace 
officer" to include a variety of state and local government employees whose 
murder could mean the death penalty for the killers. 
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP: This took effect on June 6. 
</P>
<P>
MEASURE: * Proposition 115: This wide-ranging anti-crime measure amends the 
state Constitution to limit the rights of criminal defendants to those required 
by the U.S. Constitution. It also revises state statutes to try to speed 
criminal proceedings, expands the death penalty, and specifies torture as a 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP: The measure took effect on June 6. But opponents contest the 
constitutionality of the proposition. They contend it violates the legal 
requirement that initiatives be limited to a single subject. They also argue it 
is a "revision" of the state Constitution -- rather than an "amendment" -- and 
thus cannot be enacted by initiative. 
</P>
<P>
MEASURE: * Proposition 116: This measure authorizes the state to sell $1.99 
billion in general obligation bonds to pay for intercity and commuter rail 
systems. The money would go to build various rail systems, including $202 
million for the Los Angeles-San Diego rail corridor, $81 million for the Los 
Angeles-Santa Barbara rail link and at least $80 million for Metro Rail. 
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP: The Transportation Commission meets June 13 and 14 and is expected 
to discuss guidelines for the allocation of the funds. A Caltrans spokeswoman 
said the agency is now reorganizing and will soon appoint a coordinator to 
handle the funds. As with Proposition 108, Caltrans does not seem to be geared 
up for quick action. 
</P>
<P>
MEASURE: * Proposition 117: This prohibits sport hunting of mountain lions and 
sets aside $30 million annually for 30 years for purchase of habitat. 
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP: The prohibition took effect on June 6. Habitats will be set aside 
starting July 1. 
</P>
<P>
MEASURE: * Proposition 118 and Proposition 119 failed. 
</P>
<P>
MEASURE: * Proposition 120: This measure authorizes the state to sell $450 
million in general obligation bonds to provide money to buy land and construct, 
remodel and maintain state prisons. 
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP: No date has been set for the bonds to be sold. Legislators plan to 
ask voters to approve another $450-million prison bond issue in the November 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
MEASURE: * Proposition 121: This measure authorizes the state to sell $450 
million in general obligation bonds to pay for new construction for University 
of California, Cal State and community college campuses. Of that amount, $386 
million is for the current budget: $130 million for UC, $130 million for CSU, 
and $126 million for community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP: No date has been set for the bonds to be sold. Another $450-million 
higher-education bond issue is expected to be on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
MEASURE: * Proposition 122: This authorizes the state to sell $300 million in 
general obligation bonds to pay for the repair, replacement or relocation of 
state and local government buildings that would be unsafe in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP: It may be several years before the state is geared up to administer 
the program and the bonds are actually sold. 
</P>
<P>
MEASURE: * Proposition 123: This measure, which passed by a higher margin than 
any other bond issue on Tuesday's ballot, authorizes the state to sell $800 
million in general obligation bonds to pay for the construction, rehabilitation 
and modernization of classrooms. At least $500 million must be spent on 
construction, no more than $260 million for rehabilitation and modernization of 
existing school buildings, and $40 million for air conditioning of year-round 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP: No date has been set for the bonds to be sold. Another $800-million 
school-bond measure is expected to be on the November ballot. Even if the 
second measure is approved, however, the state will be well short of the amount 
needed to pay for $6 billion in backlogged projects. Almost $2 billion in 
earlier voter-approved bonds still have not been sold.

TEXTBOOKS' BACKERS FIND SUCCESS IN FIGHT TO KEEP THEM IN USE;

EDUCATION: READERS AIMED AT CHILDREN IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED 
AS VIOLENT AND PROMOTING SATANISM.

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite strong protests by parents and conservative church groups, a number of 
California school boards have voted in recent weeks to retain the 
unconventional elementary-grade reading series "Impressions." 
</P>
<P>
Critics say the Impressions readers, for kindergarten through sixth grade, are 
anti-religious, are preoccupied with death and violence and teach disrespect 
for parental and other authority, among other charges. 
</P>
<P>
But the series' defenders argue that the new curriculum is intended to turn 
youngsters into readers by exposing them to interesting stories, instead of 
concentrating on spelling, grammar and sentence structure, although these are 
taught, too, with supplementary materials. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall critics persuaded three school boards in Southern California and one 
in Northern California to reject the books. 
</P>
<P>
But since then, confrontations have been going the other way. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Redondo Beach voted to retain the Impressions series. More 
recently, other school boards, including Yucaipa's in San Bernardino County, 
have either adopted the series or refused to remove it from schools that were 
already using the books. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's a battle we've won," said State Supt. of Public Instruction 
Bill Honig, who supports the books strongly because he believes they are more 
likely to interest children in reading than the old "Dick and Jane" approach. 
</P>
<P>
Impressions, which was published originally by Holt, Rinehart and Winston (now 
owned by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich), was one of 17 sets of materials adopted by 
the State Board of Education for the new California elementary school English 
and language arts curriculum in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The series is used in about 100 California school districts, according to state 
Department of Education officials. 
</P>
<P>
Impressions is an anthology of stories, fables, poems and other kinds of 
writing that seeks to stimulate children's imaginations and to encourage 
students to think independently. Witches, goblins and other monsters populate 
some stories. People are turned into pigs or snakes or toads, and they are 
beheaded or disposed of in other violent ways. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in many districts that are using the books report that children love 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"There are all kinds of positive indicators," said Guy Emanuele, superintendent 
of schools in the New Haven Unified School District in the East San Francisco 
Bay community of Union City. "Kids are reading more, they're taking out more 
library books, they're more interested in what they're reading." 
</P>
<P>
But the books are anathema to many parents, especially those affiliated with 
conservative churches. 
</P>
<P>
"This is disgusting stuff," said the Rev. Robert Simonds, president of the 
National Assn. of Christian Educators, which has been supporting many of the 
anti-Impressions protests. 
</P>
<P>
"The predominant themes contained in this series are violence, degradation and 
death; negativity and despair; witchcraft and animism; fear and horror." 
</P>
<P>
In the first few clashes, the anti-Impressions' point of view prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
In Hacienda La Puente Unified and in East Whittier, the books were removed from 
use in grades 1-6. In Castro Valley, the series had been adopted for use in 
grades 1-5 next year but the school board changed its mind in the face of a 
vigorous protest. 
</P>
<P>
"These people come out of the woodwork and they scare you," said Marilys 
Tognetti, assistant superintendent of schools in Dixon, a small agricultural 
community near Sacramento. "If you're the parent of a first-grader and these 
people tell you these books will introduce your child to drugs and satanism, 
that's pretty frightening." 
</P>
<P>
But recently, school boards have been rejecting the protests and have been 
voting for the Impressions series. 
</P>
<P>
"We have finally begun to stem the tide," said Michael Hudson, Western director 
of People for the American Way, an organization that monitors First Amendment 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Everywhere we have been successful, teacher-parent support has been critical," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Beach City School District, which uses Impressions as its basic 
reading text, was among the first to say no to organized efforts to shelve the 
books. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 6, before a standing-room-only audience of parents, trustees voted 
unanimously to retain the text, despite pressure from a coalition of 
conservative Christians led by activists from a local church. 
</P>
<P>
District Supt. Nick Parras said that, in the aftermath of the vote, about a 
dozen parents asked that their children be given a different reading text. But 
he said that as time passed, most of those parents have changed their minds and 
now all but five or six children are using the Impressions books. 
</P>
<P>
In one community after another, groups of parents and teachers have formed to 
back Impressions, although this sometimes has meant spending hundreds of hours 
on the issue and engaging in scalding public debates. 
</P>
<P>
"At the first meeting I attended, a person I knew called me a 'satanist' and it 
just built from there," said Paula Sullivan, one of the organizers of a 
pro-Impressions parents group in Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
At that meeting of about 100 people in February, Sullivan said, all but a 
handful wanted the Dixon school board to remove the books from the two 
elementary schools where they were being used. 
</P>
<P>
But Sullivan and Tognetti, who called Impressions the "best program available 
in the United States today," helped to organize a strong campaign of support. 
In April the board voted 5 to 0 to retain the series. 
</P>
<P>
Many local school boards and parent groups have had outside help -- from state 
schools chief Honig, the California Teachers Assn., parent-teacher 
associations, the California School Boards Assn. and People for the American 
Way. 
</P>
<P>
"What concerns us is that this is a well-orchestrated attempt by right-wing 
radicals to preach censorship, impose their religious beliefs and undermine the 
public school system in the process," said CTA President Ed Foglia. 
</P>
<P>
Although opponents of Impressions have lost the last few skirmishes, they still 
believe the war can be won. 
</P>
<P>
In Yucaipa, where the Board of Education voted 4 to 1 to retain the series, 
after an especially bitter controversy, an attempt is being made to recall the 
four school board members who voted for Impressions. 
</P>
<P>
In Dixon, the Western Center for Law and Religious Freedom has filed suit in 
Yolo County Superior Court charging that decisions favorable to Impressions 
were made at secret meetings, in violation of the state's open-meeting law. 
</P>
<P>
There is talk of another lawsuit, perhaps in Winters, charging the school board 
with promoting a "state religion," namely sorcery, witchcraft and satanism, by 
approving the books. 
</P>
<P>
Rev. Simonds said local school boards were voting for Impressions because "they 
don't listen to parents, they take their protest petitions and throw them in 
the wastebasket." 
</P>
<P>
But he added, "I know 25 California communities that are organizing for the 
first time, to get a school board that is responsive to parents." 
</P>

SOUTH AFRICA: FUND-RAISERS, RALLIES AND THE KEYS TO L.A. ARE PLANNED FOR 
ANTI-APARTHEID LEADER WHEN HE VISITS LATER THIS MONTH.

When he crosses into California on the last leg of a grueling, eight-city U.S. 
tour, anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela will become the star attraction at 
mass rallies inside sports coliseums, at elegant fund-raisers and on the steps 
of Los Angeles City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
From a $1,000-a-head reception to a march by students, admirers are expected to 
flock to events in hopes of catching a glimpse or hearing the words of the 
black South African activist freed just four months ago after 27 years of 
imprisonment for opposing white-minority rule. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela is scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles on the morning of June 29. He 
leaves early the next day for Oakland, where he will stay for about 12 hours 
before departing for Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-day U.S. tour starts in New York on June 20 and will include Boston, 
Washington, Atlanta, Miami and Detroit.

News that Mandela was coming to the United States unleashed a frenzied 
competition among politicians, supporters and others who wanted to honor or be 
host to him. The demand, say organizers, has been tremendous, complicating the 
frantic and confused preparations for Mandela's hectic itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the cities that were chosen for Mandela to visit submitted schedules 
that included up to eight events a day, according to one organizer. Over the 
last few days, members of an executive committee that is overseeing the tour 
have been struggling to pare down plans -- and expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big fight," said a coordinator. "Everybody wants to have it happen the 
way they want it. . . . It is a testimony to the esteem in which people hold 
him, but it is not realistic." 
</P>
<P>
Concerns about security, which is being handled by the U.S. Department of 
State, and the delicate health of the 71-year-old leader may also force some 
cuts in the schedule, organizers say. Mandela recently underwent surgery for 
removal of a benign cyst. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. visit is part of a 14-nation journey to press for continued sanctions 
against the white South African government and to raise money for the 
cash-strapped African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Darlene Donloe, a spokeswoman for the local Mandela Reception 
Committee, cautioned that many parts of Mandela's schedule are still "up in the 
air." But the events are shaping up, tentatively, this way: 
</P>
<P>
After arriving on the morning of June 29, Mandela and his entourage will 
motorcade from Los Angeles International Airport to City Hall, where he will 
meet with Mayor Tom Bradley and speak to the City Council. Then, Mandela will 
be presented with keys to the city at a noon public ceremony on the steps of 
City Hall. Aside from the motorcade, this will be the only free public access 
of the day. 
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, Mandela will hold a series of private meetings at the 
Biltmore, possibly with members of the local African National Congress chapter 
and religious figures. 
</P>
<P>
A fund-raising reception, with tickets costing anywhere from $1,000 apiece to 
$50,000, will be held at the armory in Exposition Park at 7:30 p.m., while a 
concert and rally at the 90,000-seat Coliseum gets under way about 8 p.m. The 
event, titled the "Mandela Freedom Celebration 1990," will feature Quincy Jones 
and other prominent musicians. Mandela is scheduled to address the gathering at 
9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, a coalition of student groups and black trade unionists plans to 
march from Jackie Robinson Park along Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to the 
Coliseum to attend the rally. The march is scheduled to depart at 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the Coliseum rally will cost $10. A Mandela hot line has been set 
up to give information on where the tickets can be purchased. It also will have 
updated information as it is available. The number to call is (213) 281-3184. 
</P>
<P>
For the reception, organizers are sending thousands of announcements to movers, 
shakers and followers in the entertainment industry, the business world and 
church and labor groups, inviting them to purchase tickets. It is not yet clear 
how many seats will be available for the reception. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as the invitations go out, I'm sure we will be deluged," said Judy 
Levy, a partner with Levy, Pazanti and Associates, which is handling the 
tickets. "There's been a lot of interest." 
</P>
<P>
For information on the reception tickets, the public may contact Levy's firm at 
(213) 386-8014. 
</P>
<P>
In Oakland, Mandela is scheduled to address a rally and concert at noon on June 
30 in the Oakland Coliseum. Mandela's wife, Winnie, will speak at a separate 
engagement honoring women at the Community Theater in Berkeley. Tickets to both 
the rally and the Berkeley event are $5 and can be purchased through the 
B.A.S.S. ticket service. 
</P>
<P>
That evening, a fund-raising dinner is planned at the Oakland Hyatt Regency, 
with plates starting at $100. Seating is available for up to 2,000 people. To 
reserve tickets, call (415) 655-6606. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the Mandela tour chose to sidestep San Francisco because an 
exhibit at the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum is sponsored by Royal Dutch Shell 
oil company, which has substantial holdings in South Africa, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos has been quoted as having urged the museum to 
find another sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
Here is the tentative schedule for the rest of the visit: 
</P>
<P>
The Mandela tour starts with his arrival at JFK International Airport in New 
York on June 20. There he will be honored with a noon ticker-tape parade in 
downtown Manhattan and a City Hall ceremony. His New York tour will include a 
motorcade through Harlem, an appearance at a church service, a rally at Yankee 
Stadium and private fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
On June 22, he is scheduled to address the U.N. General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, he heads for Boston. He will stop at Madison Park High School in 
Roxbury to give his blessing to a teach-in on the situation in South Africa for 
about 1,500 youths and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
A motorcade then takes him to the John F. Kennedy Library where Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy (D-Mass.) is holding a luncheon. That afternoon, Mandela will address a 
free public rally at the Esplanade entertainment center. 
</P>
<P>
A fund-raising reception is scheduled at the Copley Plaza Hotel at a cost of 
$5,000 per couple. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela next plans to spend three days in Washington. A meeting with President 
Bush is set for 11 a.m. on June 25. That afternoon, he is to meet with 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and later with the Executive Council of 
the AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
On June 26, Mandela is scheduled to have breakfast with the Congressional Black 
Caucus and speak to a joint session of Congress at 11 a.m. A rally is scheduled 
for that night at the D.C. Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela flies to Atlanta on June 27, where he will place a wreath at the crypt 
of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and receive honorary degrees from 
several predominantly black universities, including Morehouse College. That 
night, there is a rally at Georgia Tech's Grant Field. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning of June 28, Mandela reaches Miami for a speech to the American 
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees convention at the Miami 
Beach Convention Center. He leaves immediately for Detroit, where he plans to 
visit an auto assembly plant and speak to a rally at Tiger Stadium.

2 SOLDIERS FACE TRIAL IN DEATH OF PANAMANIAN; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY JUSTICE: SHOOTING OF WOMAN TOOK PLACE MORE THAN A MONTH AFTER THE U.S. 
INVASION. THE CASE HAS BEEN AN EMBARRASSMENT TO THE ARMY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Two U.S. soldiers who took part in last year's invasion of Panama will be tried 
on murder charges here later this month in the shooting of a Panamanian woman. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred Jan. 25, more than a month after the invasion, while the 
soldiers were still in the country as part of a cleanup operation, military 
officials said. The soldiers, who are from the 7th Infantry Division at Ft. 
Ord, also are accused of mishandling their weapons, leaving their base without 
authorization and disobeying orders not to use alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Paul Finsel Jr., 25, of Arkoma, Okla., and Pfc. Mark McMonagle, 20, of 
Philadelphia, face sentences of up to life imprisonment. McMonagle's trial 
begins June 18, and Finsel's trial begins June 25. 
</P>
<P>
A third soldier, Pfc. Marc Gussen, 19, of Teaneck, N.J., pleaded guilty to 
firearms, alcohol and obstruction of justice charges at an April hearing at Ft. 
Ord. He was sentenced to two years in prison and a dishonorable discharge. 
</P>
<P>
The case, the second prosecution of U.S. soldiers involved in the Panama 
invasion, has been an embarrassment to the Army, which has contended that the 
invasion was a highly disciplined military operation. Earlier this year, a 
paratrooper based at Ft. Bragg, N. C., was charged with premeditated murder in 
the shooting of a Panamanian man who had surrendered to U.S. forces during the 
December invasion. Army officials are reviewing his case and trying to 
determine whether he should be court-martialed. 
</P>
<P>
The Army has released few details about the shooting of the Panamanian woman, 
and military defense and prosecution attorneys refused to comment. Maj. L. D. 
Walker, a Ft. Ord spokesman, would say only: "The incident is alleged to have 
occurred when the soldiers unlawfully discharged their weapons. Shots fired by 
. . . McMonagle . . . allegedly resulted in the death of Leila Diaz De Panay, 
50." 
</P>
<P>
The incident began, the Army charges, when the three soldiers left their 
barracks, against orders, to visit a bar, which also serves as a brothel. John 
L. Williams, a San Jose criminal attorney hired by McMonagle's family, said 
that Finsel lost his Army-issue 9-millimeter pistol at the bar. When Finsel 
discovered the weapon missing, he became "extremely agitated," Williams said, 
and decided to stage a fake firefight to cover the loss of the pistol. 
</P>
<P>
The Army considers the loss of an assigned weapon "very serious," said an Army 
official who asked not to be identified. "A soldier will go to great lengths to 
ensure that his weapon is accounted for," he said. "And if it's not accounted 
for, he'll go to great lengths to ensure that it's recovered." 
</P>
<P>
The three soldiers began firing their weapons in the street, Williams said, so 
Finsel could claim he lost his weapon during the confusion of the firefight. 
The result, the attorney said, was total chaos. A carload of Panamanians 
responded by strafing the area with automatic weapons, Williams claimed. 
Eventually, U.S. soldiers from the nearby temporary barracks arrived and "began 
sweeping the area" and shooting out street lights as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
As the Americans withdrew, an officer ordered McMonagle and a few other 
soldiers to "cover the rear," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
"Soldiers were firing their M-16s . . . tracer rounds were going off," Williams 
said. "It was noisy, dark and very confusing. At some point McMonagle became 
separated from the group. He saw a shadow and yelled: 'Halt!' The individual 
didn't halt and McMonagle fired." 
</P>
<P>
The woman's body was found near McMonagle but, Williams said, "others were 
shooting at the time and it's not clear McMonagle shot the woman." The Army, 
however, charged both McMonagle and Finsel with murder. 
</P>
<P>
"This may be a lot of things, but it's not a murder case," Williams said. "This 
was clearly an accidental death. . . . It could be manslaughter, assuming the 
Army can prove McMonagle fired the rounds that killed the woman. The facts just 
don't fit a murder charge." 
</P>
<P>
But, according to the Code of Military Justice, the Army can charge a soldier 
with murder even if there is no premeditation, said Walker of Ft. Ord. One of 
the Army's definitions of murder includes participating in an "act inherently 
dangerous to others" that results in a death, he said. Although both soldiers 
are charged with murder, Walker said, "a lesser penalty can be determined by 
the court." 
</P>
<P>
McMonagle faces an additional charge of violating orders not to have "sexual 
contact with Panamanian females," and Finsel faces charges of loss of military 
property for losing the pistol. 
</P>
<P>
McMonagle joined the Army after he graduated from high school in Philadelphia 
so he could eventually pay for college, said his sister, Christine McMonagle. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing has been a nightmare for our family," she said. "We asked the 
Army legal people for an investigator to look into some inconsistencies in the 
case and we were turned down. The whole investigation has been very puzzling." 
</P>
<P>
The families of Finsel and Gussen were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Army will pay compensation -- the amount not yet determined -- to the 
family of the Panamanian woman who was killed, an Army spokesman said. But the 
U.S. government is not planning to pay any indemnity for those killed or 
wounded during the invasion. According to unofficial reports, an estimated 300 
Panamanians were killed and another 2,000 wounded -- most of them civilians -- 
during the invasion.

"Doe doesn't need public relations right now, obviously," spokesman Mike Hogan

SHAMIR WANTS NEW CABINET TO FOCUS ON SOVIET JEWS, AVOID SPLITS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, fresh from welding together a new rightist 
government, pleaded Saturday that it focus on bringing Soviet Jews to Israel 
and not tear itself apart over factional differences. 
</P>
<P>
Since getting enough backing from right-wing and religious parties to ensure 
his stay in power, Shamir has evaded comment on the divisive question of talks 
with Palestinians, sticking to one issue on which there is broad national 
agreement: that a home for as many Soviet Jews as possible must be made in 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I hope this new government will be an efficient one. It will work in one 
united spirit without too many differences among its members, and I hope the 
government will work day and night for the solution of the most important 
problems we are facing," he said in a radio interview. "And the most important 
of all these problems is the mass immigration and the acceptance of these 
immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
About 150,000 Soviets are expected to arrive in Israel this year as they flee 
anti-Semitism and nationalist uncertainty in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir rejected descriptions of his government as right wing and hard-line. His 
new Cabinet faces a parliamentary vote of confidence Monday. "This government 
represents a large (share) of parties inside our political community, and I can 
say, without hesitation, that this government represents the majority of our 
people," Shamir told a radio interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about American proposals to talk with Palestinians, Shamir hedged, 
saying that ahead lies a long process of getting his Cabinet approved, putting 
ministries into action and tackling problems. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's relations with the Bush Administration have been under strain over the 
lack of progress in making peace between Israel and the Palestinians in revolt 
on the Israeli-held West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir has proposed elections for the West Bank and Gaza to let Palestinians 
choose a peace panel. On Saturday, he reaffirmed his offer, although several 
members of his new Cabinet, including members of his own Likud Party, oppose 
the plan. In any case, it has bogged down over difficulties in designating a 
group of Palestinians to sign on to the proposal; Shamir rejects giving a role 
to the Palestine Liberation Organization, which has a wide following among 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's comments Saturday highlighted the difference in priorities between 
himself and Shimon Peres, the leader of the rival Labor Party who tried to 
unseat Shamir in March. Peres' effort to build his own coalition and become 
prime minister failed when he could not command a majority in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Peres focused on peace as his primary goal. He argued that success in solving 
Israel's problems, including immigration, depended on reducing tensions with 
the Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir, on the other hand, suggested that peace is just one in a galaxy of 
Israeli problems and not necessarily the most pressing. "In the next weeks, we 
will take some decisions about our steps in many parts of our activity. 
Diplomatic activity, immigration, absorption, etc.," he said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
His reluctance to tackle the Palestinian peace issue seemed to confirm early 
Israeli opinion that any move in the direction of peace talks will bring down 
the government. Shamir claims only a two-member majority in Israel's 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Along the spectrum of Shamir's core of support, the hard-line context becomes 
clear. Ariel Sharon, the hawkish former defense minister who is now housing 
minister, said that peace can only come after the Palestinian rebellion is 
subdued. "I think one of the main goals of the state of Israel is, of course, 
to restore order . . . because otherwise there won't be any possibility to move 
toward peace," he said Saturday. Sharon also affirmed plans to build new 
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as well as permit new Soviet 
immigrants to settle there. 
</P>
<P>
Geula Cohen, a member of the rightist Tehiya Party which favors annexing the 
West Bank and Gaza, warned that moves toward talks with Palestinians could 
split the coalition. "If they will do so (talk) in a way that we think that any 
promotion of this initiative is endangering the security of the state of 
Israel, we will be out of this government," she said.

DEATH TOLL PUT AT 107 IN KIRGHIZIA ETHNIC STRIFE;

<P>
SOVIET UNION: GANGS OF KIRGHIZ AND UZBEKS CONTINUE TO HUNT EACH OTHER DOWN IN 
ONE OF THE REGION'S WORST OUTBREAKS OF VIOLENCE IN TWO YEARS.

The death toll from ethnic fighting has risen to more than 100 people in Soviet 
Central Asia, officials said, in what is becoming one of the worst outbreaks of 
violence there in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at the military headquarters at Osh in the republic of Kirghizia, 
where the conflict between Kirghiz and Uzbeks broke out Monday, said Saturday 
that 107 people had died and 436 had been injured. 
</P>
<P>
"Gangs of Uzbeks and Kirghiz are hunting each other down in the outlying 
regions, although the town is calm," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The official Tass news agency described the atmosphere in the region around Osh 
as "exceptionally tense," and it said 348 buildings had been burned down, 
including 255 houses and 31 state buildings. 
</P>
<P>
A town council official in Osh said local leaders were urging Uzbeks and 
Kirghiz to stop the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
An Interior Ministry spokesman said earlier Saturday that the death toll had 
reached 83 but would undoubtedly rise. 
</P>
<P>
"The figure is not final. It is likely we will find more bodies in the 
burned-out houses. . . . Also, we found seven deserted cars on one of the roads 
leading out from Osh. We do not know what happened to the drivers and 
passengers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kirghizia's leaders declared Monday an official day of mourning for those 
killed in the unrest, the government daily Izvestia reported. 
</P>
<P>
President Islam Karimov of neighboring Uzbekistan said Friday that the ethnic 
violence is spreading into his republic, and he imposed a state of emergency in 
a number of districts around Andizhan, on the border between the two republics. 
</P>
<P>
Karimov asked Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for help to prevent 
skirmishes from turning into full-scale conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
Extra Interior Ministry forces and regular troops have been flown into the 
region. A Soviet Interior Ministry spokesman said Saturday that the border 
between the two republics was now sealed. 
</P>
<P>
The violence, which started in Osh after a quarrel about allocation of land, is 
one of the worst outbreaks of the unrest that has killed hundreds of people in 
Soviet Central Asia. 
</P>
<P>
An explosive mix of ethnic groups and years of pent-up nationalism, inflamed by 
high unemployment and squalid living conditions, have created a tinderbox in 
the region.

HIGH LEVEL OF ARSENIC FOUND IN EX-HOSTAGE REED

Tests performed on former hostage Frank H. Reed revealed an "inordinate" amount 
of arsenic in his body, leaving him afraid for the safety of other Westerners 
still held in Lebanon, his lawyer said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, where Reed has been 
undergoing treatment since his release April 30, did not say how or when Reed 
may have ingested the poisonous substance. 
</P>
<P>
The arsenic, detected when Reed was released after spending 44 months as a 
hostage in Lebanon, has since been reduced to a nontoxic level, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Boston attorney Bob Woolf said Reed had known about the arsenic for "some 
weeks." He had not spoken publicly about it because, while "we were in the 
process of hoping it would be eliminated from his system, we weren't sure," 
Woolf said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an inordinate amount, which could have been very serious to his 
health," Woolf said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Woolf said Reed was relieved that his health was no longer in jeopardy, but he 
remains concerned for the other hostages, including six Americans, still held 
by various groups in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Reed underwent tests for the arsenic as part of a standard procedure for former 
prisoners, officials at Andrews Air Force Base said. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the safety of the remaining hostages, Woolf declined to discuss how it 
was believed Reed received the arsenic. The element has medicinal purposes when 
combined with bromides, but is a potent poison in excessive doses. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from a brief visit last month to family members in his native Malden, 
Mass., the 57-year-old educator has been recuperating at the Malcolm Grow 
Medical Center at Andrews since his return to the United States.

Kerry Kennedy and Andrew Cuomo were married Saturday in a ceremony that merged 
two of America's most powerful political families. 
</P>
<P>
They swore mutual commitment to the oppressed -- "the people who have 
disappeared in El Salvador, the children in shelters in New York." 
</P>
<P>
The bride, 30, is the daughter of Ethel Kennedy and the late Sen. Robert F. 
Kennedy and is executive director of the human rights center in New York City 
that bears his name. The groom, 32, is New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's son and 
his chief political adviser. He also heads a Manhattan foundation to help the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 people attended the elaborate, closed wedding at the Cathedral of St. 
Matthew, a Catholic church about half a mile from the White House. It is the 
church where President John F. Kennedy's funeral was held in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Kerry Kennedy was 8 years old when her father was assassinated in a Los Angeles 
hotel shortly after winning the California Democratic presidential primary. She 
was the seventh of Robert and Ethel Kennedy's 11 children. 
</P>
<P>
The bride walked the aisle alone as the Kennedy clan, including Jacqueline 
Kennedy Onassis, and a planeload of Cuomo relatives and intimates looked on. 
</P>
<P>
The guest list was not disclosed, but it included New York Mayor David N. 
Dinkins, filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola, newspaper columnists Jimmy Breslin and 
Art Buchwald and dozens of others who occupied a swarm of photographers and 
hundreds of sightseers who lined the sidewalk across from the church. 
</P>
<P>
Kerry Kennedy's cousin, Maria Shriver, the groom's father and several brothers 
and sisters of both the bride and groom gave readings during the wedding Mass, 
celebrated by Father Gerard C. Creedon of County Cork, Ireland, a longtime 
Kennedy family friend now performing charity work in nearby Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Creedon said the couple affirmed a pledge to uphold "family traditions and 
their commitment to human rights and justice." He charged them in the ceremony, 
at their request, to always "cherish the people who have disappeared in El 
Salvador, the children in shelters in New York." 
</P>
<P>
The bride wore a Scaasi-designed dress of gleaming silk and white satin with a 
Basque bodice, a sweetheart neckline, puff sleeves, a voluminous skirt and a 
cathedral train. It was ornamented with crystals, silver bugle beads and hearts 
of pearl. The groom and his 15-member party wore morning dress. 
</P>
<P>
The maids of honor were the bride's younger sister, Rory, 21, and friend Mary 
Richardson, 30. Sisters Courtney Kennedy and Kathleen Kennedy Townsend were 
among 13 bridesmaids. 
</P>
<P>
A three-abreast, blocklong fleet of stretch limousines carried the wedding 
party and virtually all their guests to a reception at Hickory Hill, the 
McLean, Va., home of Ethel Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony blended classical and African-American music and featured Ruth 
Brown, the star soloist of Broadway's "Black and Blue." 
</P>
<P>
Both the bride and groom are law school graduates. They had dated for nearly 
two years before he offered her a diamond ring last Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo has worked for his father's political campaigns since he was a teen-ager 
and managed his gubernatorial victories in 1982 and 1986. He plans to run his 
father's campaign for reelection this year as well. 
</P>
<P>
Following a six-day honeymoon in the Caribbean, the couple plans to settle in 
Queens, N.Y. Andrew Cuomo's current office, as head of HELP, the nonprofit 
corporation to build temporary housing for the homeless, is in Manhattan.

JACKSON SEES 'PATTERN' TO PROBES OF BLACK OFFICIALS

The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Saturday that a pattern of discrediting black 
elected officials is developing in the United States, similar to one that drove 
blacks from office following Reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say it's a conspiracy, but one can at least see a pattern here. Not 
one of these people has been convicted, but they keep investigating," the civil 
rights leader said at a prayer breakfast sponsored by embattled Rep. Harold E. 
Ford (D-Tenn.). 
</P>
<P>
The two-time Democratic presidential candidate centered his remarks around 
Ford, who is running for a ninth term but still faces political corruption 
charges that were first filed in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Ford's first trial ended in a mistrial April 27 after a jury could not reach a 
verdict. Prosecutors said they plan to retry the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Why does this Harold Ford trial take on such national importance? Because 
there is a sense of history, not hysteria. We remember what happened in the 
last century," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years after slavery ended, the numbers of black officials were growing 
rapidly," he said. "But then the group of people who says we are only a little 
higher than animals and a little lower than people started their campaign to 
disrupt, discredit and destroy our leadership. It did not take very much to 
re-instill fear in whites." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson cited probes of Rep. William H. Gray III (D-Pa.), Rep. Ronald V. 
Dellums (D-Berkeley) and Rep. Gus Savage (D-Ill.), which he said were 
fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been all these discrediting leaks and investigations, and not one 
conviction. But there has been just enough suggestion, and the power of 
suggestion has power," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the others, Jackson said Ford has been indicted and tried. 
</P>
<P>
"In a jury of his peers, 9 of 12 exonerated him. But losing 9-3 is not enough 
for the government. They say: 'He is our trophy. We cannot stop because he is 
our trophy,' " Jackson said in urging the government not to retry Ford.

YOUR MORTGAGE; 
</P>
<P>
BANKS GIVE S&amp;LS A RUN FOR THEIR LOAN MONEY; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCING: CONSUMERS ARE ADVISED TO CHECK WITH AT LEAST THREE BANKS, THREE 
S&amp;LS AND THREE MORTGAGE BROKERS AS COMPETITION HEIGHTENS AMONG FINANCIAL 
INSTITUTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Whether you're seeking a loan to buy a new home or simply planning to refinance 
your current mortgage, you'll be faced with an important question: "Will I get 
the best deal from a bank or savings and loan association?" 
</P>
<P>
Of the nearly 10,000 people who attended the three home buyers fairs sponsored 
recently by The Times, the question of which type of financial institution is 
most likely to offer the best deal on a mortgage was one of the most frequently 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
And, as is always the case when you're borrowing money, there's just no 
cut-and-dried answer. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, savings and loan associations generally offered the best deals 
because they specialized in making home loans. Banks tended to concentrate 
their lending efforts on big commercial accounts, car loans, credit cards and 
the like. 
</P>
<P>
But many of those same banks have since refocused their marketing efforts on 
making more home loans and -- in some cases -- now offer better terms than 
their thrift counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
"Some banks have launched such aggressive marketing campaigns that even I have 
to admit that S&amp;Ls are no longer the only game in town for home buyers," 
said Sam Lyons, a senior vice president of savings and loan giant Great 
Western. 
</P>
<P>
The increased competition between banks and S&amp;Ls for a bigger share of the 
mortgage market has generally benefited consumers. Many financial institutions 
are now slashing the up-front costs to attract new customers, while others are 
developing new types of loans to address the changing needs of today's 
borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
Since the line between banks and S&amp;Ls has become blurred, it's best to 
check with at least three of each if you're hunting for a mortgage today. 
</P>
<P>
Also check with at least three mortgage brokers. Brokers represent several 
lending institutions instead of just one, much like independent insurance 
agents represent several insurers. 
</P>
<P>
"Talking with a mortgage broker supplements your own research because he can 
tell you about the programs several lenders are offering," said Peter G. 
Miller, author of "The Common Sense Mortgage" and other real estate books. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you've talked to several lenders and combine the information that the 
mortgage broker gave you, you'll have a pretty good idea of who's got the best 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
One key question that you'll have to ask each potential lender is how much 
out-of-pocket expenses you'll incur before the loan is made. Your biggest 
up-front cost will likely be for "points." 
</P>
<P>
One point is equal to 1% of the total loan amount. So if you want a $100,000 
loan and the lender demands two points, you would pay $2,000 in points to get 
the loan. 
</P>
<P>
Also ask about any other expenses that you will have to pay for in cash. 
</P>
<P>
For example, some lenders charge nothing for their appraisals while others 
charge $250 or more. Fees for processing your loan application, preparing loan 
documents and other items can also vary widely from one lender to the next. 
</P>
<P>
Also make sure you know exactly which rate the lender is quoting for you. Some 
quote the "nominal" or "note" rate, which reflects the rate on the loan before 
compounding. 
</P>
<P>
A better indicator of a loan's true cost is the annual percentage rate (APR). 
It typically takes into consideration the effects of compounding, the amount of 
points you'll be charged and a variety of other costs you'll incur. 
</P>
<P>
Still, you shouldn't automatically assume that the lender or mortgage broker 
who quotes you the lowest APR is offering the loan that's best for you. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the APR gives you the clearest picture of what the loan will really 
cost, but a lot also depends on how long you plan on living in the home," said 
John Tuccillo, chief economist of the National Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, let's say that you've narrowed your choices down to two lenders. 
The first lender is offering a 10 1/2% loan but will charge you two points for 
your 30-year, $100,000 fixed-rate mortgage. The second will charge you an 11% 
rate but will demand no points. 
</P>
<P>
If you chose the first lender, monthly principal and interest payments on the 
loan would be $915, and your points would cost you $2,000. If you went with the 
second lender, your monthly payments would be $952 but you would pay nothing in 
points. 
</P>
<P>
You would save $37 a month by choosing the 10 1/2% loan. However, you would 
have to stay in the property at least 55 months before your savings will offset 
the $2,000 in up-front fees you would pay (55 x $37 equals $2,035). 
</P>
<P>
If you plan on leaving before 55 months are up, you would probably be better 
off choosing the second loan. Even though your monthly payments will be a bit 
higher, you'll save money in the long-run because you won't have to come up 
with $2,000 in up-front cash. 
</P>
<P>
You can do your mortgage-shopping by phone, but it's usually better to visit 
each lender or mortgage broker in person. It gives you a better idea of their 
professionalism and fosters a dialogue that could make the difference between 
getting the loan and getting turned down. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the case of Carla Simpson, who recently bought her first home in the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said she first contacted several lenders by phone to see about getting 
a mortgage loan, but they all rejected her because her annual earnings weren't 
high enough to qualify for the size of the loan that was needed. 
</P>
<P>
She finally scheduled an appointment to visit a local lender in person. As 
Simpson and the loan officer talked, she mentioned that she was recently 
divorced. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me that I could count the $400 a month in alimony that I get as 
income," Simpson said. "The subject never came up with the brokers I talked to 
on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
"That 'extra' $400 a month was enough for me to qualify for a loan," Simpson 
said. "If I hadn't visited the lender in person, I probably would've given up 
house-hunting by now."

ADVANTAGES AND PITFALLS OF 'WRAPAROUND' LOAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENNY L. KASS, Kass is a Washington lawyer and newspaper columnist 
specializing in real estate and tax matters. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: My wife and I have been trying to sell our house for some time. We 
purchased the house about 15 years ago, and we have an existing assumable 
mortgage that carries a very low interest rate. Recently, a friend told us 
about a "wraparound" mortgage. Can you tell us how this works, and whether it 
would have any advantages or disadvantages for us? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Wraparound mortgages gained popularity during the period of high 
interest rates in the mid-1970s and again in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
A wraparound mortgage works like this: You have an existing mortgage with a 
present balance of $80,000 at 8% interest, and you would like to sell your 
house for $150,000. Your purchaser is able to come up with 20% of the purchase 
price, or $30,000, and would have to obtain a loan for $120,000 to buy your 
house. 
</P>
<P>
One way to achieve this financing is for the purchaser to apply for a 
conventional 80% loan. Under this arrangement, the purchaser would have to pay 
appraisal and credit report charges, as well as points, which could be as high 
as $3,000 (three points). 
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, the purchaser could assume your existing first trust (mortgage) 
and seek second trust financing for all or a portion of the remaining money 
above the first, which in this case would be $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the interest rate on the second trust will be higher than the 
interest rate on a new first trust. However, the combined effective interest 
rate (and the combined monthly payment) may not be greater than a single first 
trust in the higher amount. 
</P>
<P>
A third way of working with this situation would be a wraparound mortgage. 
Under such an arrangement, the purchaser would first assume your existing 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
You would then give to the purchaser what amounts to a second trust on the 
property for the full amount of the financing ($120,000), although at the 
beginning of the loan, you are really only lending $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind, because you have not advanced all of the $120,000 at the 
inception of the loan, you may make a "profit" on the difference between the 
interest rate of the first trust and the interest rate on the second trust. The 
result to you is a yield (profit) in excess of the amount of interest stated in 
the second trust. 
</P>
<P>
To be more specific. If you take back a second trust in the amount of $120,000 
at, for example, 10%, and you continue to make the interest payments at 8% on 
the existing $80,000 first, you will be making 2% on the existing $80,000, and 
a full 10% on the $40,000 difference that you are in fact lending to your 
borrower. 
</P>
<P>
This situation may seem too good to be true, but there are problems also. 
</P>
<P>
Although usury laws have been relaxed in recent years, once in a while you run 
into a situation where local law requires certain conditions or imposes certain 
limitations on a second mortgage. You should also discuss this with your 
attorney, to make sure that you are not violating any local law. 
</P>
<P>
Your buyer may also object to this format since it may inhibit his ability to 
place further financing on the property. Rather than being encumbered by a 
single loan, the property will be subject to total liens of the first and 
second mortgages in the amount of $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
This may inhibit the ability of the purchaser down the road to obtain a 
home-equity loan, since the lender would no doubt be in third-trust position, 
unless you are paid in full on your wraparound. 
</P>
<P>
The purchaser may be somewhat hesitant to rely on you to make payments on his 
or her behalf. You can often solve this problem, however, by agreeing to send 
monthly or quarterly proof of payments to your borrower by sending him a copy 
of your monthly canceled checks. 
</P>
<P>
In some instances, the seller can give the borrower a year's worth of postdated 
checks, and the borrower then sends the monthly payment check to the first 
trust lender each month on time. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proper circumstances, a wraparound mortgage can be both practical and 
advantageous. It certainly can be a marketing tool when real estate is 
difficult to sell, since it assures the buyer that a loan is available, and 
clearly saves the buyer a lot of up front lender costs. 
</P>
<P>
You must make sure, however, that your loan is freely assumable. Additionally, 
since there is always the possibility that your borrower may default, you want 
to make sure that the wraparound deed of trust and promissory note that your 
buyer signs is valid and enforceable in your jurisdiction. It is advisable to 
have an attorney prepare the necessary legal documentation in this case.

JAPANESE REALTY FIRM OPENS AN OFFICE IN L.A.

<TEXT>
<P>
A giant Japanese real estate firm with substantial interests in the United 
States has opened a downtown Los Angeles marketing office where it will employ 
the "showroom" concept to sell residential and commercial property. 
</P>
<P>
Just as many other firms have used the concept to market everything from 
automobiles to fine art directly to consumers, Haseko (California) Inc. is 
banking that it can draw prospective buyers to the Haseko Real Estate Showcase 
in the Los Angeles World Trade Center. 
</P>
<P>
The firm already operates a marketing center in Honolulu. A second Los 
Angeles-area center will be opened in Beverly Hills in 1991, company officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The center features customer service representatives, detailed marketing 
materials, exhibit-style photographs, audiovisual displays, conference 
facilities, refreshments and even a tea room. It is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
Properties to be featured include single-family homes in planned communities 
throughout the state, luxury condominiums, office buildings, retail shopping 
centers, high-technology facilities, investment-grade real estate and 
joint-venture opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Among the $250 million in properties throughout the state are projects in 
downtown Los Angeles, Agoura Hills, Brentwood, Huntington Beach, Marin County, 
Rancho Palos Verdes, Santa Clarita, Santa Monica, Sunnyvale, Westwood and 
Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
Haseko Corp. of Japan is a publicly traded $3-billion company that was founded 
50 years ago. It is the largest multifamily home builder and one of the top 
three real estate investment firms in Japan.

SPEAKING OUT: AQMD RULES TO AFFECT WHAT PROJECTS BUILT; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: NEW AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT POLICY WILL INFLUENCE ALL MAJOR 
PROJECTS, INCLUDING OFFICE BUILDINGS, SHOPPING CENTERS AND INDUSTRIAL PARKS.

<P>
The Southern California real estate development industry will soon undergo the 
most dramatic changes since the imposition of environmental impact reports in 
the 1970s. Why? 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD), under the mandate of 
the state and federal governments, is determined to improve Southern 
California's air quality by regulating all significant direct and indirect 
sources of pollution -- including buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the AQMD board adopted a policy of evaluating and commenting 
on every regionally significant real estate project that requires an 
environmental impact statement, including office buildings with more than 
250,000 square feet, shopping centers with at least 500,000 square feet, 
industrial parks employing more than 1,000 people and even residential 
developments with 500 or more dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD will recommend air-quality mitigation measures for local government to 
consider on these projects. 
</P>
<P>
To thrive under these new circumstances, developers and architects must 
carefully study proposed AQMD regulations that will affect what, how and where 
projects are built. With this knowledge, developers and architects can 
effectively plan the building of the future -- one that will meet the impending 
municipal or AQMD pollution-reducing requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"Sources of a building's pollution emissions fall into two categories: direct 
and indirect," said James M. Lents, AQMD chief executive officer. "The direct 
pollution primarily comes from building systems and maintenance work. The 
indirect sources are the building's energy consumption, which causes pollution 
at distant power plants, and the automobiles used by employees for commuting to 
work." 
</P>
<P>
The most common source of direct pollution comes from architectural coatings 
that protect and color the facades of office, industrial and retail buildings. 
The solvents in many paints contain large amounts of "reactive organic gases" 
that are destabilized by sunlight and then combine with nitrogen dioxide in the 
lower atmosphere to form smog. 
</P>
<P>
To replace these pollution-generating coatings, proposed AQMD regulations would 
require water-soluble, lower-solvent and higher-solid coatings. In addition, 
developers may be required to use permanent materials like concrete or brick, 
which do not require any pollution-generating coatings. 
</P>
<P>
Another source of direct pollution at commercial buildings is water heaters and 
the boilers for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, which 
produce carbon monoxide as a major byproduct of natural gas combustion. To 
reduce these carbon monoxide emissions, developers may be urged to install more 
efficient boilers. 
</P>
<P>
One potential technology, now under study by the AQMD, is the "fuel cell." In 
this system, each building has its own on-site generator powered by natural 
gas, which is converted to clean-burning hydrogen before its combustion in the 
fuel cell. The waste heat of this generator is reclaimed and warms the hot 
water tank and the boiler, which supplies the building's heat. 
</P>
<P>
For office and retail buildings, indirect sources are the major cause of 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The most important indirect source is the exhaust from the motor vehicles that 
take people to and from work or on personal errands during the day. Motor 
vehicles alone account for 90% of the carbon monoxide, 70% of the nitrogen 
oxides and 50% of the reactive organic gases that degrade Southern California's 
air quality. 
</P>
<P>
With the recent implementation of Regulation 15 ("the commuter program"), the 
AQMD is requiring Southland firms with more than 100 employees to enact 
trip-reduction plans such as ride-share programs and mass transit use 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the AQMD will influence the design of parking structures at office 
buildings. In the near future, fewer parking spaces will be provided relative 
to an office's floor area than is customary today, and more "priority" spaces 
will be reserved for van pool and car-pool vehicles, plus bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the AQMD will probably encourage large office complexes to 
include on-site services and amenities -- such as day-care centers, 
restaurants, small markets and drugstores -- so that employees will not need to 
make automobile errands during the day. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD also will encourage companies to enact "flex-time" programs in which many 
employees work during off-peak hours. And flex-time will affect the planning 
and management of the building of the future. 
</P>
<P>
Security will become a big factor, because employees will be entering buildings 
during night-time hours. Card-operated security systems, which provide 
continuous protection without requiring round-the-clock security guards, will 
become increasingly common. 
</P>
<P>
Heating, air-conditioning and lighting systems will be highly customized 
because employees will be using only fractions of the total floor area during 
off-peak hours. 
</P>
<P>
Ventilation and lighting systems that operate on a single on/off switch will 
become obsolete. Instead, office lighting and each floor's ventilation will be 
individually controlled by the employees who work there or by a central 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD also will promote increased "telecommuting" by office employees. 
Through the use of advanced communications, employees can perform various tasks 
without leaving the office and making motor vehicle trips. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, modem pooling allows employees at separate locations to work 
simultaneously on the same project at their computer screens. 
</P>
<P>
Another common form of telecommuting is teleconferencing, which allows 
executives in widely dispersed facilities to conduct meetings without traveling 
to a single site. 
</P>
<P>
Besides influencing building design and construction throughout Southern 
California, the AQMD also supports the development of balanced communities to 
prevent a jobs/housing imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
This imbalance is the shortage of employment opportunities in new, outlying 
suburbs that forces those residents to make long, pollution-generating drives 
to work and, conversely, the surplus of jobs in other areas that causes 
congestion during peak business hours. 
</P>
<P>
To facilitate a better jobs/housing balance, the AQMD is removing from existing 
rules the requirements that discourage the relocation of industry within the 
air basin. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Southern California is becoming a trend-setter for the nation's 
real estate development industry, and the environmentally sensitive building of 
the future will reduce the region's air pollution and improve the quality of 
life for its residents. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, some Southland developers, architects and builders will not like 
these sweeping changes in their industry. 
</P>
<P>
However, the AQMD enjoys widespread popular support, and environmental 
protection has become a mainstream political force throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
And the changes are almost here, if Lents' strong statements and the AQMD's 
plans are any indication. Those architects and developers who adapt to these 
new conditions will prosper in coming years.

An unusual collection of antiques, all from gardens past, is the theme of a 
show and sale at the antique shop named Main St. U.S.A., 1325 West Washington 
Blvd., Venice, (213) 392-6676. The show will run Saturday through June 30 
(hours are 11 a.m.. 
</P>
<P>
-5 p.m. daily), but they will also have garden collectibles through the summer 
(regular hours are 11 a.m.-5 p.m., Monday-Saturday). 
</P>
<P>
Owner and avid gardener Tauni Brustin says they will have ornamental iron, 
fountains, birdbaths and houses, furniture, pots and garden sculpture, gathered 
from across the country. Don't look for the cast-iron frog seen in the 
photograph; it is now attached to the end of a hose in a certain editor's 
garden, who couldn't resist. Robert Smaus

BIG, COLORFUL ZINNIAS GREET THE SUMMER SUN; 
</P>
<P>
EASY BLOOMERS: SIMPLE TO GROW FROM SEEDS, THESE ANNUALS BURST FORTH IN ALL 
THEIR GLORY IN THE HEAT OF JULY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ELLEN GUFFEY, Mary Ellen Guffey grows annuals in her Malibu flower 
garden. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not many flowers are grown from seed these days, but zinnias are worth the 
effort. These easy summer annuals reward the grower with bright flowers up to 
six inches across that look right at home in city or country gardens as well as 
in charming bouquets. 
</P>
<P>
Last year I got a late start on my summer flower garden, not planting my zinnia 
seeds until July. The recommended time is May or June so that plants can become 
established before the intense summer heat. 
</P>
<P>
Because I hadn't placed a catalogue order, I went to my neighborhood nursery 
and bought several packages of zinnia seeds. But I also purchased some zinnia 
seedlings, thinking they would give me an earlier crop. 
</P>
<P>
I was surprised to learn that the nursery seedlings, even with their head 
start, bloomed only 10 days ahead of my seed-grown plants. The flowers of each 
group were lovely, but the seed-grown plants cost a fraction of what I spent on 
the nursery plants, and the seeds provided hundreds of plants -- many more than 
I could use. 
</P>
<P>
Zinnias come in a wide variety of forms and sizes. My favorites are the large 
cactus-flowered blooms that look like mop-headed daisies. I'm also fond of the 
smaller lilliput (pompon) variety whose thickly layered petals resemble 
parakeet feathers. 
</P>
<P>
The more formal dahlia-flowered zinnias display large blooms with flat petals, 
while the Haageana or Mexicana type has 1 1/2-inch flowers with pointed petals 
bordered with a contrasting shade. 
</P>
<P>
Zinnias are embarrassingly easy to grow. Children often do as well as expert 
gardeners. The seeds are large, unlike those of petunias or snapdragons, so 
there's no difficulty seeding them or spacing them appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
In prepared soil, dig a furrow about an inch deep. Drop the seeds about four 
inches apart. Cover with one-eighth inch of soil and water gently so that the 
seeds are not washed away. Keep the soil damp until the seeds germinate -- 
usually in four to eight days. Thin the seedlings to 10 inches apart, 
transplanting extras to bare spots or into pots. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem with zinnias is mildew, especially along the coast where I 
live. Its effects can be reduced by planting zinnias early enough in the summer 
that they can bloom before late September -- when the days shorten and plants 
are moist at night. It's also wise to keep the foliage dry by watering only the 
roots. At the first sign of a white powder dusting the leaves, spray with a 
fungicide, such as Funginex. 
</P>
<P>
One summer I tried the species Z. augustifolia (also called zinnia classic, Z. 
linearias, or thin-leaved zinnia). Its 1 1/2-inch golden-orange semidouble 
blooms are not nearly so striking as those of today's hybrids, but the plants 
had one especially appealing characteristic: no mildew, even in my humid 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
Now I see that the Burpee hybridizers have crossed Z. elegans with Z. 
augustifolia to produce a pink 2 1/2-inch bloom said to be mildew-resistant. 
I'm eager to try this new variety, Rose Pinwheel, in this summer's flower 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
Along with it I will plant pink statice, rose shades of strawflower, blue 
salvia (S. farinacea Victoria), pink cosmos, rose cleome and gloriosa daisies. 
The gold centers of Rose Pinwheel should blend nicely with the gold daisies, 
and blue is always an excellent complementary color. 
</P>
<P>
Because they take longer to flower, I'll start the strawflowers in flats a 
couple of weeks before they go into the garden. All the other plants will be 
sown directly in the garden. Although blue salvia is easy to grow from seed, 
it's a perennial (often grown as an annual) that takes several months to begin 
flowering, so it's one summer flower that I usually purchase from the nursery. 
</P>
<P>
To use water as efficiently as possible, all my plants will be grown alongside 
soaker hoses. Although some irrigation systems are quite sophisticated (what 
with computer timers and multivalve stations) mine is simple. 
</P>
<P>
For each tier of my garden where annuals are sown, I use 150 feet of soaker 
hose that connects to the garden hose. I allow the water to run about five 
hours, gently, twice a week. By monitoring the soil dampness, I can determine 
whether to apply more or less. 
</P>
<P>
For gardeners who prefer the speed and convenience of seedlings, several 
familiar zinnia strains can be found at garden centers. 
</P>
<P>
The largest is dahlia-flowered State Fair, a reliable favorite that's been 
around for years. Peter Pan, Pulchino, and Cut-and-Come-again zinnias produce 
three-inch flattened blooms on 12- to 18-inch bushes. The smallest zinnia, 
Thumbelina, is cute but it's in bloom for such a short time that it seems 
hardly worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Hartog, who raises thousands of bedding plants for his Vintage Nursery in 
Lakewood, likes to use zinnias as backdrop plants. He favors a mass planting of 
Peter Pan (because of its relatively large flower size and compact growth) 
bordered by white vinca Little Bright Eye. The vinca hides the lower leaves of 
zinnias, which can become unsightly. 
</P>
<P>
Terry says: "Both vinca and zinnias are good bets for hot-weather areas because 
they can stand up to the heat." 
</P>
<P>
The best selection of zinnias is in such catalogues as Burpee Gardens 
(featuring zinnias on the cover), Warminster, PA 18974, and Park Seed, 
Greenwood, SC 29647-0001, Most local garden centers also have a variety of 
zinnia seeds.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week: 
</P>
<P>
* Plant a tree this summer to shade the hot spot in your garden next year. 
</P>
<P>
Choose from a good selection of container trees available now at nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
* One last planting of dahlia tubers will give you fall bloom as the plants you 
set out earlier are dying back. 
</P>
<P>
* When spraying plants for insects and diseases, don't forget the underside of 
the leaves. 
</P>
<P>
* It's not too late to plant tomatoes. Set them deeper in the ground than they 
were in the nursery container to prevent weak, leggy plants.

Leon Whiteson's excellent article " 'House Machine' at Home on Southland 
Hillsides" (May 20) was a pleasure to read. As a private building inspector, it 
has been my good fortune to examine numerous residences designed by the 
architects cited in the piece. 
</P>
<P>
To me, these structures are museums unto themselves, for the most part standing 
distinct from the more mundane homes that surround them. 
</P>
<P>
One can find "clusters" of architecturally significant homes; there are several 
Case Study houses that survive on Moore Street in Mar Vista (one I inspected 
still has several original "moveable" walls, permitting the home to be 
reconfigured instantly) and a group of Quincy Jones designs in Kenter Canyon, I 
believe, on Deerbrook. 
</P>
<P>
Other areas where these homes can be found are Whitley Heights and Mt. 
Washington. For the most part, the owners of these homes have had the good 
sense to "leave them alone," or remodel them coherently. 
</P>
<P>
I think Los Angeles is blessed to have such a trove of wonderful residential 
architecture; a proper reminder that architecture means more than tall 
buildings made solely of concrete, glass and steel.

THREE MEANS OF DEALING WITH RUST; 
</P>
<P>
REMOVAL: IT CAN BE DONE WITH ABRASION OR CHEMICAL TREATMENT. OR IT CAN BE 
NEUTRALIZED WITH OTHER CHEMICAL PRODUCTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. J. HAND, Los Angeles Times Syndicate 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes right down to it, there are three basic ways to deal with rust. 
You can remove it via abrasion. You can attack it chemically with a rust 
remover. Or you can leave it right where it is, but chemically transform it 
into something else. Each of these techniques works, but each is best in 
certain situations. 
</P>
<P>
Rubbing away rust with abrasion isn't a lot of fun, but it can certainly be 
effective, taking you right down to bright shiny metal and producing a surface 
that is ready to prime and paint. For most homeowners, the best tool for this 
job is a disk sander. You can also sand the area by hand. Start with 80- or 
100-grit paper to chew away major deposits and smooth out any pits. Then go to 
220 to prepare for final painting. 
</P>
<P>
A sandblaster is another very effective abrasive tool. It's main advantage over 
a sander is its ability to work into the spots, creases or highly textured 
surfaces the disk sander can't conform to or reach. 
</P>
<P>
What about wire wheels and cups? They can conform to unusual shapes better than 
a disk sander, but aren't as effective as abrasives at getting right down to 
bare metal. 
</P>
<P>
A relatively new product (shown in the sketch) I've tried actually combines the 
flexibility of the wire wheel with the clean finish produced by abrasives. The 
secret is nylon bristles impregnated with abrasives. The bristles conform 
nicely to contoured work, and the abrasives cut right down to bare metal. 
</P>
<P>
Chemical removers work pretty well, but ironically, not if you follow the 
directions. These read more like a sales pitch than helpful advice: "Just brush 
on, let set and wash away rust like magic!" 
</P>
<P>
Don't believe it. I use a somewhat more labor-intensive procedure. First, since 
rust is often impregnated with grease, oil, grime and other contaminants that 
tend to seal it against rust removers, I like to start with a thorough 
cleaning. Scrubbing with a strong dishwasher detergent usually does the job. 
</P>
<P>
Then, I turn to the rust remover. Most of these contain phosphoric acid, which 
eats away at the rust. Since this is a chemical reaction, it will proceed 
faster if you work where it is warm. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever possible, I like to soak rusted parts in a tray or bowl of remover, 
stirring them around every few minutes. This keeps the rust wet and constantly 
exposed to fresh remover. 
</P>
<P>
You can't very well put a car fender in a tray of remover, however. So for 
large work, I brush the stuff on as thickly as possible, then go back every few 
minutes and brush on some more. This keeps the rust constantly in contact with 
fresh remover. 
</P>
<P>
For really tough rust, you may have to help the process along by rubbing with 
sandpaper or steel wool. If you do this, wear rubber gloves. Then let things 
soak. A couple of hours isn't too long. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, wash off the remover very carefully with detergent and water. If you 
cut corners on this step you'll probably end up with a white dusty coating all 
over the work. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, it pays to follow up with a wire wheel to knock off any deposits 
still clinging to the metal. If you plan to paint, it's a good idea to sand 
lightly with 100- then 220-grit paper. 
</P>
<P>
Chemical transformers are the latest weapons against rust. Yet, they don't 
remove it at all. Instead they chemically transform it into a blue/black 
compound that binds well to the base metal beneath it, and at the same time 
protects against further rust. 
</P>
<P>
These transformers -- sold under brand names such as Neutra-Rust, Rust-Oleum, 
Rust Reformer and Extend -- are easy to use and effective. If you like the look 
of the blue/black surface they produce, you can leave it as is. It needs no 
further treatment. If you will be happy with a so-so paint job, you can also 
paint right over these treatments without the need to prime. 
</P>
<P>
But since these treatments don't actually remove rust, they can't produce a 
nice smooth surface ready for a high-gloss paint job. Of course, if you do want 
a smooth finish, you can sand the rust after it has been treated, but if you 
are going to do that, you might as well skip the chemical treatment altogether 
and rely completely on a thorough sanding. 
</P>
<P>
It's your choice, but if you do decide to use a reformer, you can go ahead and 
follow label directions. Unlike rust remover instructions, these are right on 
the mark. 
</P>
<P>
Once you've dealt with rust, you may want to put down a protective finish. This 
consists of one or two coats of primer, followed by the desired top coats. I 
usually use aerosol primers. Alkyd-based primers (such as Rust-Oleum) are tough 
and work well over existing finishes, but are slow to dry. 
</P>
<P>
Lacquer primers (like Krylon and most auto touch-up aerosol primers) dry much 
faster, but they may attack existing finishes already on your work. Test them 
on an inconspicuous spot if possible. 
</P>
<P>
For the smoothest final finish, spray on at least three coats of the final 
color. Let each coat dry and sand lightly between coats with 320 wet-or-dry 
paper. Use 400-grit paper before the final coat. If your work isn't that 
critical, just brush on your top coat and go fishing.

ASK THE INSPECTOR: UNBOLTED FOUNDATION INDICATES OLDER HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL ROSS, Ross is the public relations chairman for the California Real 
Estate Inspection Assn. (CREIA) 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I have been informed that the foundation of my house is not bolted. 
Is this a serious defect? Should I insist that my next home be bolted? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: First of all, a "non-bolted" foundation is not necessarily a defect; it 
primarily indicates that your home is older. After the 1933 Long Beach 
earthquake, the Field Act went into effect in 1935. Most notably, the Field Act 
called for improved concrete, the use of reinforcing steel and the joining of 
structures and foundations by anchor bolts. 
</P>
<P>
This makes homes built post-1935 more earthquake resistive, and by definition, 
stronger. However, bear in mind that a pre-1935 house you may have been 
considering has survived three significant earthquakes (1933, 1971 and 1987), 
and the vast majority have come through in good stead. 
</P>
<P>
I have inspected hundreds of pre-1935 houses, and while some have had problems, 
I can recall fewer than five where the foundation system required wholesale 
rehabilitation or replacement. While ultimately, a house with a bolted 
foundation might be preferable, it would be a bit close-minded to exclude from 
your plans an older home simply because the foundation is non-bolted. More 
attention should be paid to an older foundation, however, particularly with 
regard to area drainage (from the eaves and grounds) and trees directly 
adjacent to the home.

Inspector Is Needed to Protect Investment 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why do I need an inspector? 
</P>
<P>
A: 1. You are making one of the most important investments in your life, and 
you should have it inspected by a professional home inspector who is trained in 
the home inspection industry. 
</P>
<P>
2. Each home has many idiosyncrasies. Some can be life threatening, costly or 
very minor. A professionally trained, experienced inspector can evaluate these 
problems and professionally report them to you in a written report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Get Bids From Licensed Contractors for Repairs 
</P>
<P>
Q: I want to make repairs on my new home. Will the inspector tell me costs of 
repairs? 
</P>
<P>
A: If the inspector is a general contractor, he should be qualified to give you 
approximate costs. However, these costs will vary depending on who is giving 
them. For actual costs, it is always recommended that you get three bids and 
always get them from a qualified, licensed contractor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Insulation Required in Houses Built After 1975 
</P>
<P>
Q: My new home is not insulated. Is this a requirement? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. It wasn't until about 1975 that new homes were required to be fully 
insulated. This is a state law, Chapter 24 of the housing code. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smoke Alarm Needed at Time of Home Sale 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do I have to have smoke alarms in my home? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. At the time of a sale of a home in California, the smoke alarm has to be 
installed. The state requires one alarm in a home. Each city has its own codes. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles requires smoke alarms to be installed in bedrooms and 
adjacent halls to the bedrooms. They are to be on the ceiling or within 12 
inches of the ceiling. Alarms in single-family dwellings can be battery 
operated, and all others shall be hard wired. In new construction, they will be 
hard wired in all units. The homeowner may put in the alarms. If he doesn't, 
then the buyer is required to. In apartments, they were required by law in 
1983, and the owner is supposed to check them every six months. He is supposed 
to keep a log on this. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Power Lines Will Tell Voltage of Wiring 
</P>
<P>
Q: How can I tell if I have 240-volt wiring in my home? 
</P>
<P>
A: If there are three wires from the power pole to the home, it is 240. On the 
twisted cable drop lines the cable is the third wire. Any home built after 
World War II will have 240. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inspector Should Act on Safety Hazards 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am selling my house, and recently our house was professionally inspected 
for a prospective buyer. We were gone at the time of the inspection. I think 
the inspector hired by the buyer overstepped his bounds by turning off our gas 
because he found a gas leak. 
</P>
<P>
We returned that evening to a cold house with no gas and nothing to alert us 
but a note to call a plumber or the gas company and a message on our telephone 
recorder from our realtor with the same advice. 
</P>
<P>
A: Come on now! Would you rather have returned to find your house filled with 
gas -- or worse? While there are no rigorous guidelines for an inspector 
detecting an unsafe condition, common sense (and probably common law) should 
demand that the inspector take suitable action when an imminent hazard is 
detected. It would appear that the inspector and realtor both did what they 
could in your absence, and you should thank them both for their concern. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Upgrading Fuses Can Boost Electrical System 
</P>
<P>
Q: My home has fuses. Should these be changed? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. There is nothing wrong with fuses. They usually never fail to function. 
However, a lot of them deteriorate with age. Some lose their ability to carry 
their maximum volted amperage with each tripping of the breaker. Fuses will 
date a home. Most homes built after 1950 will have circuit breaker panels. They 
still use fuses for main electrical panels. 
</P>
<P>
However, most older homes have upgraded the electrical systems to meet today's 
electrical needs. Older service panels were 50 or 70 amps. With all of our 
modern appliances, these usually will not be large enough to carry the load 
required by today's electrical needs. Panels are required to be a minimum of 
100 amps or larger on all homes today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan Home Inspection at Beginning of Escrow 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am preparing to buy a house. Different people give me conflicting advice 
on scheduling a home inspection. Some say, wait until near the close of escrow 
so any problems that develop during the escrow period will be spotted. Others 
say, have it done right away. Any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
A: Most sales contracts will require you to have the inspection early rather 
than late, because it is a contingency that "clouds" the sale until completed. 
But there are good reasons why you, too, should prefer an early inspection. 
</P>
<P>
The risk of new problems developing during escrow is small compared to the risk 
that you will have to make a hasty decision if you wait. Bear in mind that the 
inspector is a generalist, and may very well advise you to consult a specialist 
on a specific problem. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a furnace may show suspicious symptoms that the inspector flags. 
He or she will likely advise you to consult a heating contractor for further 
analysis. If that advice does not come until the day before escrow is to close, 
you're left in the lurch between assuming the risky furnace or delaying 
closing.

FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
Home wiring -- An item in the Ask the Inspector column June 10 addressed what 
voltage is coming to the house from power lines. If three wires extend from the 
power pole to the house, the voltage is 240. However, many houses have a 
voltage regulator at the meter so that only 110 volts come in. To get the 
higher voltages needed for heavy appliances such as an air conditioner, 
electric range or electric clothes dryer, you must have a 220/240-volt meter 
and a 220/240 circuit breaker and branch circuit. In older homes, those with 
only two wires coming to the house, 220 or 240 voltage is not available.

ON THE HOUSE: ROLLER PARTS AVAILABLE FOR SLIDING GLASS DOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Last year, my sliding glass door stopped sliding! The repairman said 
the roller was broken and he could not locate the company or an interchangeable 
part. He said the whole thing might have to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that a few months ago you mentioned the name and telephone number of a 
company that has thousands of replacement parts (this one is American, I 
think). 
</P>
<P>
Will you please tell me once again how I might be able to make contact with 
this company so that I can replace my broken roller? The repairman lost the 
broken roller so I don't have something to have a part made from. Before you 
know it, it will be hot again, and I need to have that door working! 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Ah yes, the case of the sliding glass door that won't slide. A familiar 
tale to those of us that deal with crime around the house. That is to say that 
it's a crime that your door isn't operating properly. Fear not, you have come 
to the right place. We'll surely get you and your sliding door on the right 
track! 
</P>
<P>
What do you want first: the good news or the bad news? The good news is that 
The Blaine Window Company of Hagerstown, Md., boasts an inventory of more than 
20,000 replacement parts for almost any aluminum frame window or sliding glass 
door. And, if you send them $2, they'll send you a copy of their catalogue. Not 
a bad thing to have if you have a home that is surrounded by windows and doors 
with aluminum frames. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news is that the folks at Blaine have a minimum order amount of $25, 
which means the inexpensive do-it-yourself roller-repair project that you 
originally estimated at about $5 (labor and material) just got blown out of the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's significantly less than the cost associated with the full removal 
and replacement of the existing door. (We call this our "glass-is-half-full" 
philosophy). 
</P>
<P>
We suggest that you first attempt to find a replacement roller at your local 
hardware store or home improvement center. You'd be surprised at the broad 
inventory of repair or replacement parts that many of these stores have on 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, most sliding glass doors that we are familiar with have more than one 
roller. So, just because your repairman lost one of the rollers doesn't mean 
that you don't have something to take into the store to use as a comparison. 
Simply remove the remaining roller. 
</P>
<P>
A final note: You may find that your sliding door is hard to operate without 
rollers so hurry back from the hardware store. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

Insulation Helps to Silence Dishwasher 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm shopping for a new dishwasher and want a recommendation on which one I 
can rely on for the most quiet operation. 
</P>
<P>
A: According to Consumer Reports, Kitchen Aid and Whirlpool top the list for 
quiet operation, but we don't recommend that you stop there. Add extra 
insulation as part of the installation of your new work saver. 
</P>
<P>
You'll need a can of 3M spray adhesive, and a small roll of 1-inch spun glass 
insulation (your local heat and air-conditioning contractor will be your best 
bet in locating the small amount of materials that you'll need). Follow the 
instructions on the can of adhesive carefully to achieve a lasting bond. Apply 
as many layers of insulation to the machine as possible, and yet still allow it 
to fit into the cabinet opening. 
</P>
<P>
An additional layer applied to the inside surfaces of the cavity in the 
cabinetry where the dishwasher fits into is also recommended. Consumer Reports 
Books publishes a handy reference called Guide to Appliances, which may help 
you to get your money's worth when purchasing most appliances.

Ceramic Tile Sealer Maintains Floor Shine 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm writing you to ask if you could tell me what I can use on my ceramic 
tile kitchen floor to keep it bright and shiny looking. I have used vinegar and 
water, ammonia, and Spic &amp; Span. It keeps the floor clean but not shiny. 
Any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
A: You have 50% of the project down pat -- that's the cleaning. The second half 
and equally important phase is the sealing of the fresh and clean surface. This 
is where many of our "weekend warriors" make a mistake. Many of them believe 
that the grout is the only portion of the tile installation that needs to be 
sealed. On the contrary, you should seal the entire surface, grout and tile. In 
addition to protecting your grout from staining, it will lend itself to a 
long-lasting finish that will enhance the beauty of the ceramic tile. 
</P>
<P>
We recommend that you make a trip to your local hardware store or home 
improvement center and pick up a container of ceramic tile sealer. There are 
many of these products on the market under a variety of labels. To get the most 
for your money we suggest that you purchase a sealer that contains acrylic and 
silicone resins. 
</P>
<P>
This is a super Saturday morning project that is guaranteed to be well worth 
the investment! 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Check Panes for Label on Tempered Glass 
</P>
<P>
Q: We have a sliding glass door in the family room of our 20-year-old home. Our 
first child will be walking soon, and we are concerned about the type of glass 
in the door. Is there any way to tell if we have the type that breaks "safely" 
or is it better just to replace the glass? 
</P>
<P>
A: According to the Uniform Building Code, glass contained in doors like yours, 
shower enclosures and windows that come within 18 inches of the floor, is 
required to be tempered. That means that in the event the glass is broken, it 
will break into a million small pieces rather than large jagged chunks that 
have the potential of doing tremendous physical harm. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, if the glass is tempered, a small tempering identification mark 
that reads "tempered glass" will appear in one of the corners. These labels 
tend to be rather inconspicuous, so you may need to do a little looking. If you 
don't see the tempering mark and you're not certain that the glass is tempered, 
we recommend that you replace the glass with tempered. We believe that an ounce 
of prevention is truly worth a pound of cure -- this is especially true in this 
case.

COMMERCIAL SCENE: DEBT-LADEN THRIFTS ARE UNLOADING SUBSIDIARIES; 
</P>
<P>
RESTRUCTURING: COMPLYING WITH NEW FEDERAL REGULATIONS, SEVERAL S&amp;LS ARE 
SELLING OFFICE TOWERS AND OTHER PRIME PROPERTIES.

<TEXT>
<P>
Dozens of Southern California real estate development companies are being put 
up for sale or liquidated altogether as the thrift industry begins to comply 
with FIRREA -- the landmark federal Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and 
Enforcement Act of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
H. F. Ahmanson, Glendale Federal, Columbia and Great American are just a few 
examples of savings and loans seeking immediate ways to raise cash and 
substantially unload their development subsidiaries. The race is on, because 
many managers are worried that what they don't sell now will only get harder to 
sell in the months to come. And, on July 1, thrifts must meet stricter real 
estate related capital requirements or risk getting taken over by federal 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
H. F. Ahmanson is one of California's healthier thrifts. Its Home Savings of 
America headquarters building went up for sale this spring, and now the company 
is exploring the sale of both Ahmanson Commercial Development Co. and Ahmanson 
Developments Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Ahmanson executives didn't want to talk directly about their plans to get out 
of the real estate business last week. Instead, they referred to remarks by 
Richard H. Deihl, chairman and chief executive officer, who told shareholders 
last month that the company was "exploring the possible sale" of its real 
estate operations. These include 10 million square feet of commercial space 
completed or under development. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Home Savings of America Tower being marketed by Goldman, Sachs 
&amp; Co., Ahmanson is involved in building the 40-story Savings of America 
Tower in Chicago, nearly 1 million square feet of space at Lake Merritt Towers 
in Oakland and a long list of office, industrial and retail projects throughout 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman, Sachs wouldn't confirm that all of Ahmanson's real estate portfolio 
was for sale. But, said Barry Sholem, vice president and manager of real estate 
activities at Goldman, Sachs, "Home Savings has the best portfolio in the 
business." And, he added, "1990 will be the year of the portfolio deal." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Salomon Bros. Inc. has been retained to sell GlenFed Development 
Corp., which has gross assets of about $500 million. "Our job is to find a 
buyer or buyers who will pay the highest price," reported David L. Knowles, 
managing director at Salomon Bros. in Los Angeles. "We think the strongest 
candidates are a combination of Asian interests." 
</P>
<P>
The problem with selling off a whole development company such as GlenFed's, 
Knowles conceded, is "it's a heterogeneous portfolio and most real estate 
investors target a specific type of asset." The result is that most buyers 
expect a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
With all the portfolios coming to market, "some may have to sell at a 
discount," predicted Sholem of Goldman, Sachs. "In California, we are at least 
blessed with economic fundamentals better than the rest of the country." That 
means some California properties may get discounted, but they won't be selling 
at fire-sale prices. 
</P>
<P>
Who will the buyers be? "There are a number of war chests being developed," 
observed Sholem. Unlike Knowles, he doesn't expect many Japanese trading or 
insurance companies to be among the likely candidates, though. Foreign buyers, 
said Knowles, aren't equipped to perform the intensive due-diligence research 
necessary to analyze a whole portfolio versus one particular project. U.S. 
pension funds may also opt out of the running, warned Sholem. 
</P>
<P>
". . . The pension funds themselves are rethinking whether they want to be in 
real estate," Sholem said. While many of these companies have increased their 
real estate investments in recent years, Sholem said they are beginning to 
realize, "Gee, it's not performing as we expected." 
</P>
<P>
Pension funds may become more circumspect about their real estate investments, 
he noted, and that could create "a herd mentality." 
</P>
<P>
Before buyers lose interest, many thrifts hope to sell their portfolios and 
start cleaning up their lending operations. Thrifts are also concerned that 
once the Resolution Trust Corp. begins to liquidate insolvent S&amp;Ls around 
the country, the supply of properties for sale will depress prices even more. 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to beat the RTC to market," reasoned Barry M. Rubens, chief 
executive officer of California Research Corp., a Santa Monica-based banking 
consultant. "When the RTC comes on line it will glut the market." 
</P>
<P>
Just how to best market these properties is the center of a growing debate. 
Some institutions are selling their real estate assets piecemeal through 
brokers. Others prefer auctions. So-called workout specialists are popping up 
everywhere, and investment bankers such as Goldman, Sachs and Salomon Bros. are 
seeking a high profile too. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm wondering if the investment bankers are the right ones to do it," Rubens 
said. "We often give them more credit than they deserve. I haven't seen a lot 
of success using them." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, nobody's quite figured out how to sell billions of dollars in real 
estate quickly and painlessly. Even thrifts that manage to line up a buyer may 
find closing the transaction a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-April, Landmark Land Co. of Carmel, the parent of New Orleans-based Oak 
Tree Savings, announced that Hon Development Co. of Laguna Hills would pay $967 
million for a sizeable chunk of the S&amp;L's $1.3-billion real estate 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
The sale was designed to make sure that Oak Tree complies with new capital 
requirements that go into affect on July 1. But the Office of Thrift 
Supervision in Washington, D.C., rejected the deal. Hon planned to borrow about 
80% of the purchase price from seller Oak Tree; federal authorities said no, 
arguing that it was unsafe for the thrift to loan so much money to one 
borrower. 
</P>
<P>
With the sale nixed, Oak Tree probably will join a growing list of institutions 
that fail to meet new federal capital requirements July 1. To remedy the 
situation, however, Oak Tree and Landmark will sell Hon 7,000 acres of land at 
the junction of the 10 and 60 freeways in Riverside County for $275 million. If 
that deal closes as expected, Oak Tree hopes to return to the good graces of 
the federal regulators by late July. 
</P>
<P>
This partial sale is but a temporary solution, for July 1 is only the first of 
several deadlines set for thrift executives to restructure. 
</P>
<P>
Starting next month, thrifts will have to back up 10% of their real estate 
investments with institutional capital -- meaning that if an S&amp;L has $1 
billion in real estate assets, it must have a corresponding capital account 
(assets less liabilities) of at least $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, however, that percentage jumps to 25%, followed by 40% in 1992, 60% 
in 1993 and 100% in 1994. While these new guidelines don't expressly forbid 
direct institutional investments in real estate, they make it completely 
impractical for thrifts to consider holding on to such assets with no leverage. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to get those assets out of our (thrift) institution," said Landmark 
Chairman Gerald G. Barton. Properties on the block include the PGA West, La 
Quinta and Mission Hills golf resorts near Palm Springs. Said Barton: "We 
intend to shrink as we sell our real estate." 
</P>
<P>
The same goal is shared by just about every S&amp;L in California. Great 
American Bank of San Diego placed its Great American Development Co. subsidiary 
on the market in February and is seeking to sell about 30 real estate projects. 
</P>
<P>
"We originally set July 1 as the date we wanted to complete a sale, but we now 
hope to do so by Sept. 30," said spokesman Brian Luscomb. 
</P>
<P>
The need to complete a sale is particularly acute for Great American. As of 
March 31, the thrift failed to meet all three federally-mandated capital 
requirements. On July 1, those will, of course, get even tougher. Great 
American won approval of a new plan to straighten its finances by the end of 
this year. In short, Luscomb said, his company must raise $350 million by the 
end of 1990 or risk getting taken over. 
</P>
<P>
Troubled Columbia Savings &amp; Loan in Beverly Hills is equally anxious to 
sell a chunk of its real estate holdings. "We're winding down the real estate 
operation," reported Jeffrey E. Palmer, first vice president of Columbia Real 
Estate Group. The company has already sold about $153 million in properties and 
is dissolving Columbia Development Partners as its seeks to sell several 
developments on Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills called "The Masterpiece 
Collection." 
</P>
<P>
Columbia is simultaneously looking to sell both its current headquarters 
building and a new one under construction. If they both sell, the S&amp;L will 
have some tough choices to make about where to move. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Coast Federal Savings sold out its interest in CoastFed Properties 
to joint venture partner Alan Casden for $112.6 million. The portfolio included 
two Beverly Hills office projects and a number of residential developments. 
</P>
<P>
Great Western too has an office building for sale in Beverly Hills. Executives 
report that they're out of the real estate business for all practical purposes, 
and Goldman, Sachs is evaluating offers for the building at Wilshire and La 
Cienega boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Not every thrift is ready to call it quits when it comes to real estate 
investments, however. As FIRREA goes into affect, several strong institutions 
are finding new ways to stay in the real estate game. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed Corp. of San Diego, parent of HomeFed Bank, recently created HomeFed 
Communities, a new development subsidiary that will operate by borrowing money 
from third-party sources instead of from its parent. By using outside money, 
HomeFed Communities can add to HomeFed Corp.'s bottom line without requiring 
HomeFed Corp. to set aside lots of extra capital as a guarantee of solvency. 
</P>
<P>
The bank's real estate subsidiary, Home Capital Development Group, which was 
financed with HomeFed Bank money, will be phased out. 
</P>
<P>
California Federal Bank is spinning off assets from subsidiary Cal Fed 
Enterprises to C.F. Income Partners L.P., which is structured to operate 
independently. The new partnership has already taken over seven properties from 
Cal Fed Enterprises and has options to acquire another 19. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cal Fed sold 20% of its management interest in the new partnership 
to New York-based real estate merchant bankers Wellsford Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Fed also sold its direct investments in the Wilshire Courtyard and in its 
now-former headquarters tower in the Miracle Mile District for several hundred 
million dollars. New investments through C.F. Income Partners will be financed 
through outside sources instead of through the bank, but profits will still 
kick back to Cal Fed shareholders. Eventually, if any of C.F. Income Partners' 
investments go sour, some other lender will be left holding the bag -- not Cal 
Fed. 
</P>
<P>
How all these sales, liquidations and recreations sort themselves out has yet 
to be seen. About the only sure thing, said Ivan Faggen, director of real 
estate services at the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., is "five 
years from now we'll still be talking about this."

NEW CHURCH GUIDELINES ON QUINCEANERA CELEBRATIONS PUT A DAMPER ON TRADITION'S 
BOOMING SERVICE INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Yolanda Rossi Garcia, a seamstress and designer for more than 25 years, recalls 
a time when it seemed as if her staff could not sew fast enough. Just months 
ago, her seven seamstresses were stitching up a taffeta and silk storm of 
ruffles and bows for quinceanera gowns, a traditional white formal -- similar 
to a bride's -- worn by a Latina celebrating her 15th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia hired extra salespeople to help fill the orders coming into her downtown 
Los Angeles shop, which specializes in creating the quinceanera look, complete 
with a headdress and bouquet. Almost all of her mannequins were adorned in the 
elaborate frocks, stopping potential customers in their tracks. 
</P>
<P>
That was certainly the case last year when Garcia and her staff at Bridal City 
averaged 75 quinceanera dresses -- her No. 1 seller at $125 each -- a month. 
</P>
<P>
But since January, Garcia says she has not had one quinceanera order, "only 
cancellations." She has had to lay off four of her modistas, or dressmakers. 
Even the mannequins reflect the shop's 60% downturn in quinceanera sales. Only 
one of them is wearing the specialized dress. 
</P>
<P>
For many other merchants, the economic forecast looks bleaker. Luis and Julie 
Yanez, the owners of a Reseda fashion shop, face possible bankruptcy before the 
year is over. And they blame the Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
So do about 400 other members of the Grupo Latino Por Nuestras Tradiciones 
(Latino Group for Our Traditions), an organization of small businesses that was 
formed after the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles issued new 
quinceanera guidelines at the start of the year. The group includes merchants, 
ranging from florists and caterers to printers and tuxedo rental shopkeepers, 
who provide services for quinceanera parties that usually cost, on the average, 
about $3,000. Families and close friends frequently pitch in to defray the 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
The archdiocese issued the guidelines to encourage Latino families to simplify 
the quinceanera. The tradition had, in the eyes of the church, become too 
secular, too social and too costly. (Until recently, at least, the daylong 
event included a Mass for each celebrant, elaborate dresses for 15 girls, and a 
fiesta with a banquet, mariachis and a dance.) 
</P>
<P>
But since the first of the year, hundreds of merchants report as much as a 60% 
decline in quinceanera sales and services in an industry estimated at $30 
million in Southern California, according to Luis Yanez, the Grupo's president 
and spokesman. He adds that many dress shops that cater to the quinceanera 
trade may close before the year is over. 
</P>
<P>
Father Anastasio Rivera, director of the archdiocese's Latino ministry, says he 
is saddened that these dress shops are facing tough times. "The church is not 
interested in seeing anybody go out of business," Rivera says. "This (the 
guidelines) was not done to put them out of business. The point that I am 
making is that the church's angle is neither in terms of promoting or 
denigrating anybody's business. The church is concerned with the spiritual 
formation of these young people." 
</P>
<P>
He says the new guidelines also were designed to increase awareness and 
understanding of the tradition among priests. The quinceanera, he points out, 
is a custom that has been passed from mother to daughter through the 
generations and is not a sacrament like a baptism or first communion. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera says the guidelines also suggest that a monthly quinceanera Mass be 
recited so that several girls can be honored at one time. There are not enough 
Spanish-speaking priests to handle individual requests. 
</P>
<P>
Another suggestion is that the quinceanera do without or have fewer than the 
usual 14 teen-age attendants (and their 14 escorts) at the Mass. Each couple, 
according to the Latino custom likened to a debutante ball, represents a year 
in the quinceanera's life. 
</P>
<P>
Again, Rivera says that the church's suggestion "is in favor of simplicity in 
the ceremony." But the guidelines, he adds, are to be tailored to the needs of 
each family and parish. 
</P>
<P>
"The kind of costs or expenses that a family wants to undergo is up to the 
family," he says. "The church is not going to intrude on the family's privacy 
and tell them what to do. The role of the church here is the teaching role, one 
of stressing religious renewal and faith formation for our young people." 
</P>
<P>
Rivera, who has met with a delegation from the Grupo Latino, says the group's 
main gripe with the guidelines is the monthly quinceanera Mass. In a recent 
meeting with the Grupo's delegation, Rivera says, "they kept insisting that 
there should be a private Mass for every single young lady. I said we just 
don't have enough priests for all the pastoral needs in the archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
"If the business people feel that the guidelines are impacting on their 
business, then my great hope would be that there would be some way that the 
church and business community can come together. We need to work together in 
terms of the coordination of these ceremonies and for the religious education 
of these young people," Rivera says. 
</P>
<P>
"The legitimate concern for all the community," he adds, "is for the welfare of 
our young people." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Grupo Latino point out that for many Latino teen-agers and their 
families, a traditional quinceanera with all the trimmings is a proud tradition 
they hate to see reduced to a simple birthday party or no party at all. 
</P>
<P>
Angela Castillon, who turned 15 last month, and her parents put the brakes on 
her quinceanera after the guidelines were announced. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been looking forward to it, but we still had a nice party," Castillon 
says. "We went to Mass and a restaurant afterwards." Her mother, Maria, says 
the Canoga Park family saved money by not having the quinceanera, even though 
the economics for the event was not the deciding factor. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to go against the church," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia hears similar stories from mothers and daughters calling to cancel, yet, 
another quinceanera order "because of the guidelines." 
</P>
<P>
She says parents tell her they are disappointed "but they want to do what is 
right in the eyes of the church. I understand their point of view. I'm upset 
with the guidelines, not the parents, because I think it's so unfair that our 
traditions are being rewritten." 
</P>
<P>
She says even though she might have to lay off personnel in the next few months 
she will stay open because she does a brisk business in weddings and 
debutantes. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been around for a long time and I can go into the jewelry business if I 
want to," she says. "I'll keep the wheel going." 
</P>
<P>
But not every quinceanera merchant can speak with such confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Schmerling, president of Tuxedo Connection and the Latino Grupo's vice 
president, says his tuxedo rental bookings are down "a good 40%" since January. 
He explains that because a quinceanera's attendants need escorts, the young men 
prefer to wear tuxedos. 
</P>
<P>
Some of his stores used to report orders for 60 tuxes a week for quinceaneras. 
"Some of those shops haven't ordered one tuxedo," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He adds that he has heard "horrible stories" from merchants about mothers 
wanting deposits on gowns or bands returned "because priests have recommended 
against having the quinceanera." 
</P>
<P>
Hyman Hendler, the owner of Hyman &amp; Sons, a fabric company in downtown Los 
Angeles that supplies many quinceanera shops with materials and accessories, 
calls the situation tragic. 
</P>
<P>
"I sell to the smaller shops like those in the (San Fernando) Valley that 
depend on events like the quinceanera to make a living. If this is affecting my 
business, it's affecting them," says Hendler whose own business is down about 
20%. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to survive because there are so many angles to my business," Hendler 
says, "but it's the small guy that's getting hit right now." 
</P>
<P>
Nora Gudiel, the owner of Melissa's Bridal in Baldwin Park, a shop she opened 
in December, says: "Maybe I made a mistake opening my place." She had hoped to 
do big business in quinceaneras. Not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lost a lot of business. And I think a lot of people really don't like the 
guidelines. They say it is not right what the church is doing with our 
traditions, but they must do what the church says even if it hurts." 
</P>
<P>
Julie Yanez doesn't know if she will be able to keep her shop open after the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're suffering," says her husband, Luis. "Like others, we were waiting for 
the prom season to hold us over. But my guess is that by the end of the year 
many of us will be closing. We're feeling the pinch right now, and the worst is 
yet to come."

AMERICA'S HEROES: MARBLE AND BRONZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each year, 1.5 million visitors view the bronze and marble statues that stand 
throughout the Capitol waiting to be recognized. 
</P>
<P>
Some are well-known. Many are not. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1864, each state has been entitled to donate statues of two of its most 
distinguished deceased citizens for permanent exhibit in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Once a state legislature decides who is to be honored, a statue is created and 
accepted by Congress for a place in the National Statuary Hall -- America's 
hall of fame. 
</P>
<P>
"People are always anxious to see the statues from their state. But often 
they're surprised and disappointed because they have no idea who (the people) 
depicted in the statues are," said Barbara Wolanin, 46, curator of Statuary 
Hall since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
California's statues, both dedicated on March 1, 1930, are of a minister and a 
priest. It is the only state with two statues of clergy. 
</P>
<P>
Most visitors recognize Father Junipero Serra, the Franciscan priest who 
established nine California missions before he died in 1784. Father Serra's 
bronze likeness holds a little mission in his left hand, and in the right, a 
cross, held high above his head. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Starr King is not so familiar. "What did he do?" Californians typically 
ask when they see the statue. 
</P>
<P>
King, a Unitarian minister, came to California in 1860 from Boston to serve as 
pastor of the First Unitarian Church of San Francisco. It was during the Civil 
War and many Californians favored the Confederacy. Of the more than 100 
newspapers in the state, only 24 supported Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
"King traveled throughout California championing the Union cause. He is 
remembered as the man whose matchless oratory kept California in the union," 
curator Wolanin said. 
</P>
<P>
King lived in California only four years before dying at age 40 in 1864. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 95 statues from 50 states, 14 are of religious leaders, including Father 
Damien (Hawaii), who devoted his life to lepers on Molokai; Father Kino 
(Ariz.), a Jesuit missionary, and Brigham Young (Utah), the Mormon Church 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
Five states -- Nevada, North Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico -- have 
contributed only one statue each. 
</P>
<P>
On May 2, Utah became the latest state to present its second statue, a 7-foot-7 
bronze likeness of lanky Philo T. Farnsworth (1906-1971), known as the "Father 
of Television." The statue shows Farnsworth holding one of his first 
cathode-ray tubes. He transmitted his first electronic TV picture in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
Students at Ridgecrest Elementary School in Butler, Utah, under the guidance of 
Principal Bruce Barnson, led the effort to put the Farnsworth statue in the 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
In a statewide poll conducted by students, residents favored Farnsworth over 20 
other Utahans, including Eliza Snow, a poet and wife of Brigham Young; Mormon 
Church leader Ezra Taft Benson; hotelier J. Willard Marriott, and heavyweight 
boxing champion Jack Dempsey. 
</P>
<P>
Among those present for Utah Gov. Norman Bangerter's unveiling of the statue 
was the inventor's 81-year-old widow, Elma (Pem) Farnsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Three statues are of Presidents: George Washington (Va.), Andrew Jackson 
(Tenn.) and James A. Garfield (Ohio). Four are of vice presidents, 36 of U.S. 
senators, 23 of House members, 30 of governors and 32 of military heroes. (Some 
held more than one of these titles.) Six statues honor women: Dr. Florence 
Sabin (Colo.), author of the "Sabin Health Laws" that modernized Colorado's 
public health system; Frances Willard (Ill.), founder of the Women's Christian 
Temperance Union; Marie Sanford (Minn.), educator and champion of women's 
rights; Jeannette Rankin (Mont.), the nation's first congresswoman; Mother 
Joseph (Wash.), a Catholic nun who contributed to the fields of health care, 
education and social work, and Esther Hobart Morris (Wyo.), the first woman to 
hold judicial office in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
There are statues of four signers of the Declaration of Independence, and of 
six physicians. A king is here -- Kamehameha (Hawaii), and a famed cowboy 
artist -- Charley Russell (Mont.). Oklahoma honors two American Indians: 
Sequoya, inventor of the Cherokee alphabet, and Will Rogers, humorist, 
newspaper columnist and movie star. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with Rogers' famous advice to "Always keep an eye on Congress to see 
what they're up to," his statue is the only one facing the House chamber. 
</P>
<P>
The feet of many of the statues gleam from constant rubbing, "for good luck," 
by visitors. Will Rogers has the shiniest feet of all. 
</P>
<P>
There are statues of the president and vice president of the Confederacy, 
Jefferson Davis (Miss.) and Alexander Hamilton Stephens (Ga.), respectively, as 
well as of "Father of Refrigeration" John Gorrie (Fla.), and steamboat inventor 
Robert Fulton (Pa.). 
</P>
<P>
America's best-known historic figures are here as well: Henry Clay (Ky.), Huey 
Long (La.), William Jennings Bryan (Neb.), Daniel Webster (N.H.), Robert E. Lee 
(Va.), Samuel Adams (Mass.), Roger Williams (R.I.), John C. Calhoun (S.C.), Sam 
Houston and Stephen Austin (Tex.), and Ethan Allen (Vt.). 
</P>
<P>
Some of the lesser known include Jabez Curry (Ala.), Uriah Rose (Ark.), Edmund 
K. Smith (Fla.), George Shoup (Ida.), Samuel Kirkwood (Iowa), George Glick 
(Kan.), Zachariah Chandler (Mich.), Zebulon Vance (N.C.) and Jason Lee (Ore.). 
Most visitors to Statuary Hall have no idea who they were, the curator said. 
</P>
<P>
"Other people pass away who are much more famous than many in Statuary Hall, 
but the states are stuck with those selected at an earlier time," longtime 
Capitol guide Madeline Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
Statuary Hall is in a part of the Capitol completed in 1807, a domed 
semicircular room with sandstone walls and breccia marble columns, a room that 
housed the House of Representatives until 1857, when the House moved to its 
present, larger chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Congress passed a bill in 1864 to create the National Statuary Hall to house 
two marble or bronze statues from each state "of deceased persons illustrious 
for their historic renown or for distinguished civic or military services." 
</P>
<P>
In 1870, Rhode Island contributed the first statue, Revolutionary War hero 
Nathaniel Greene. By the turn of the century, 23 were on exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
By 1933, there were 65 statues crowded into Statuary Hall, and it became clear 
that the floor would not support any more. 
</P>
<P>
It was then decided to keep most of the collection in the hall and place the 
others in prominent sites throughout the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Although the statues no longer stand in the same room, this gathering of heroes 
-- famous or not -- continues to be called National Statuary Hall.

HOW TO PATCH NARROW CRACKS ON DRIVEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Popular Mechanics 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: There's a long, narrow crack running across my driveway. What's the 
best way to patch the crack and keep it from getting worse? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: There's really no way you can keep the crack from getting worse. 
However, there are several ways to patch it. If the crack is 1/8-inch or less, 
fill it with a paste made from portland cement and potable water. Vinyl 
patching compounds are also suitable. Brush out loose particles and dirt. Soak 
the cracked area with water and cover it with plastic for at least 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
You can mix your own patching paste from one part portland cement, 2 1/2 parts 
sand and enough water to make a stiff paste. Vinyl patching compounds used for 
patching cracks are applied with a caulking gun. Lay the patching compound on 
the crack and press it in. Allow the material to set for about 15 minutes and 
then scrape off the excess. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use Bleach to Identify, Remove Old Mildew 
</P>
<P>
Q: While washing down my house to prepare for painting, I found the dirt came 
off but the mildew didn't. I know this will destroy the new paint soon. What 
should I do? 
</P>
<P>
A: It's often hard to distinguish mildew from ordinary dirt since both appear 
as dark stains. To test a spot, dab at it with a bleach-soaked rag. If it's 
mildew it will fall off. The best all-purpose washing solution for paint 
preparation is made with 2/3-cup trisodium phosphate, 1/3-cup household 
detergent, one quart bleach and three quarts warm water. 
</P>
<P>
Be particularly careful in choosing your detergent: those with ammonia can 
produce a toxic gas when combined with bleach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Test Before Painting Over Wallpaper 
</P>
<P>
Q: The wallpaper in our home is peeling in some areas. I'd like to reglue the 
bad spots and simply repaint the room. Do you see anything wrong with that? 
</P>
<P>
A: Painting over wallpaper is not recommended for several reasons: Paint 
solvents can loosen paper in areas that are now sound and cause dyes in 
wallpaper to bleed through paint. Also, wallpaper seams will show through 
paint. 
</P>
<P>
The rule that it's best to remove wallpaper before painting has two exceptions: 
when the plaster beneath is suspected to be in bad condition, and when 
wallpaper has been applied over dry wall. In these cases, resurfacing walls 
with 3/8-inch plasterboard provides the best simple solution. 
</P>
<P>
If you ultimately decide to paint over wall covering, first paint a small area 
to see if colors bleed through or if the paper lifts. Apply alkyd or latex 
primer coat to wallpaper. Prime vinyl fabric wall coverings with alkyd and 
smooth vinyl coverings with printed designs with a latex primer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pools Not Great for Investment Return 
</P>
<P>
Q: We're thinking of adding a swimming pool and wondering how good an idea it 
is from an investment point of view. 
</P>
<P>
A: While new automatic maintenance equipment has eliminated some of the hassles 
in owning a pool, returns on this investment are notoriously low -- 30% to 35% 
in cooler climates. Meanwhile, the costs remain high, $19,500 on the average, 
with elaborate pools costing over $30,000. You might recoup more in warmer 
climates (65% to 80% in the Sun Belt) and in posh neighborhoods where a pool 
may be almost a necessity for resale.

RANKS OF NRA GUN FOR LEADERS AT CONVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The president of the National Rifle Assn., refusing to buckle under to 
unprecedented pressure nationwide from gun control supporters, told about 1,000 
cheering members at their annual convention here Saturday: "All guns are good 
guns!" 
</P>
<P>
But as President Joe Foss and other NRA leaders sought to rally their troops 
with imagery of "battles" and "wars," they heard open divisiveness and 
frustration from their members over a series of legislative losses suffered in 
the last year by the once-unbeatable gun rights lobby. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to stop playing politics. We have to stop waffling," demanded Jerry 
Lustig, a competitive shooter from Northridge who was one of several dozen NRA 
members to address their leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, marked by lengthy diatribes against NRA policies and battles for 
microphone time, was among the most contentious in recent memory, several NRA 
leaders said. Lasting more than six hours, it revealed a deep-seated rift 
between NRA leadership and many in the general membership who are pushing for a 
more hard-line philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming under particular fire was NRA Chief Executive Officer J. Warren 
Cassidy, a former Lynn, Mass., mayor who was attacked by a vocal faction for 
what it views as a policy of appeasement toward gun opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Several members called for Cassidy's ouster. And the general membership, by a 
close but undisclosed tally, passed a resolution that would strip Cassidy of 
some of his power and give more influence to the head of the NRA's lobbying arm 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But the measure by one of Cassidy's chief detractors is not binding on the 
group's 72-member board of directors, which will meet Monday and Tuesday in 
Anaheim. And while some board members would not discuss Cassidy's standing, 
several others said he has the continued support of NRA leadership as the 
group's top staff officer. 
</P>
<P>
Despite rumblings over a major shake-up at the NRA in the wake of recent 
setbacks, executive committee member Howard Pollock said: "I don't think 
there's any serious challenge (to Cassidy) on the board." 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy came under attack for several key decisions, among them: 
</P>
<P>
* His refusal to revoke President Bush's honorary life membership in the NRA 
last year after Bush decided to ban importation of 43 types of foreign-made, 
semiautomatic assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
* His response to legislation before the California Legislature banning some 
types of assault weapons and imposing a 15-day waiting period on the sale of 
all firearms. Critics charge that Cassidy realized the severity of the threat 
to gun owners too late and did little to head it off. Each piece of legislation 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
* His refusal to pull the current convention out of California in protest of 
those measures. Cassidy countered that by keeping the convention in Anaheim, 
gun enthusiasts are showing their willingness to fight. He also kicked off a 
California campaign to raise more than $1 million and target "anti-gun" state 
legislators in November. 
</P>
<P>
* A reported decline in membership of about 250,000 in the last four years, 
down to about 2.8 million, with about one-tenth of that from California. NRA 
officials blame the decline on a $10 increase in annual dues, but critics 
charge a loss of confidence in leadership is the real reason. 
</P>
<P>
* Cassidy's February nixing of talks by an NRA faction to attempt a hostile 
takeover of broadcasting giant CBS. Supporters of the idea billed it as a way 
of combatting anti-gun coverage in the news media. 
</P>
<P>
An NRA investment committee looked at the idea of having members buy up CBS 
stock. But Cassidy decided that such a move could cause more public relations 
problems for the already-embattled NRA. Also, the move probably would be a 
fiscal impossibility for a group such as the NRA, with assets valued at $118 
million. Financial analysts have estimated it would take 10 times that amount 
to attempt a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy said he was somewhat irritated by the tactics of his critics on the 
convention floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm obviously in the spotlight, so I'm the guy that's going to get thrashed. I 
accept that," he said. "But what I don't like is the demagoguery by the 
critics, the heavy-handedness." 
</P>
<P>
The attacks came despite an early appeal for unity from NRA President Joe Foss, 
a World War II Medal of Honor winner who has been governor of South Dakota and 
the first commissioner of the old American Football League. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a stormy year, no doubt about that," Foss said, pointing to 
legislative losses at the federal level and in several states over gun bans and 
other restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
In order to win battles such as the current one in the Senate over a ban on 
semiautomatic weapons, Foss said NRA members have to quit public in-fighting 
and rid themselves of a few internal dissidents who appear as "termites in a 
good piece o' wood." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Riley of New Hampshire, who likely will take over as NRA president next 
week, added that NRA members must unite to fight gun control activists who 
"work to deny God-fearing, law-abiding Americans their right to self defense." 
</P>
<P>
At an evening banquet, NRA members also heard from Rep. Mike Espy, a black 
Democrat from Mississippi whose appearance reflected an attempt by the NRA to 
reach out to blacks. Saturday's meeting was made up of white men, most of them 
middle-aged or elderly. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to broaden the group's base will continue today with an afternoon 
talk by Ellen Morphonios, a Florida circuit court judge with a law-and-order 
reputation. Women make up 3% of the NRA's membership.

OFFICIALS FIND FAULT WITH AIRPORT PROJECT OVERSEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With costly delays and construction woes plaguing the $310-million John Wayne 
Airport expansion, county officials and others are questioning the job of a 
little-known firm being paid $23 million to oversee the work. 
</P>
<P>
Several officials say the firm failed to accomplish its primary task -- to keep 
the project on time and within budget. And controversial airport contractor 
Taylor Woodrow Construction California Ltd. blames it for an array of simmering 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
But the firm -- known as HPV -- defends its job and draws praise from county 
airport staffers. 
</P>
<P>
"HPV's charge is to stay on top of what is going on out there and coordinate 
everyone's schedules," said Jan Mittermeier, deputy airport manager. "They have 
done that very well. I think they have done a remarkable job under trying 
circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Board of Supervisors generally support HPV, but several say they 
wish the firm had told them of problems earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"Early on, I vaguely recall that there appeared to be some confusing lines of 
authority which took some time to sort out," said Supervisor Roger R. Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
"The lines of communication may not have been clearly drawn out," agreed 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said he was shocked to learn that HPV was not 
attending meetings between Taylor Woodrow and its subcontractors, which number 
more than 30. 
</P>
<P>
"The airport staff did raise red flags to some extent," Vasquez said, "but then 
the first flag I saw was when the first opening date (of April 1) was missed." 
</P>
<P>
With county officials dominating a recent flurry of debate over the airport -- 
now expected to open Sept. 16, five months late and as much as $26 million over 
budget -- Taylor Woodrow has received most of the criticism. Supervisors voted 
three weeks ago to strip the contractor of a $25-million airport parking garage 
and road contract but for the time being left intact its $60-million terminal 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Woodrow executives responded by criticizing HPV and filing a lawsuit 
charging the county with breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
But this may only be the opening round of legal fighting. By the time the 
airport actually opens, most observers predict, the whole project will end up 
in court. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not unusual for a contractor and a client to have bitter fights during a 
major public works project such as this," said Cecil Hoyt, a structural 
engineer at Colorado-based Kellogg Corp. "But I've never seen as much." 
</P>
<P>
Without suggesting that HPV bears any responsibility for Taylor Woodrow's 
troubles, Robert Cashman, a member of the county's appointed Airport 
Commission, said he would give the management firm "a grade of only C-plus 
because I think we should have been advised of what was going on much sooner, 
so that we could have acted more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
". . . It's kind of hard to understand why it was at a crisis level recently, 
when only four weeks before the crisis developed, HPV was telling us that the 
project was on schedule." 
</P>
<P>
HPV's John McCarney concedes that his firm, a partnership of three independent 
companies, is now feeling some heat. 
</P>
<P>
"Project director and professional scapegoat," he quipped recently, when asked 
his official title. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we will be the fall guy," said HPV executive Randy Smith. "But that's 
part of what you take on when you sign up for one of these projects." 
</P>
<P>
The airport job was riddled with problems from its beginning in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Originally priced at about $40 million, the terminal bids came in markedly 
higher. Taylor Woodrow's winning bid was $59.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
That left HPV with the difficult task of trying to whittle down the cost. But 
HPV internal memos show that there were pointed differences within its own 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Begley, then-HPV project director, often directed one of his top 
assistants, Robert Bowman, to tone down memos critical of airport architect 
Leason Pomeroy &amp; Associates, which was ultimately fined $775,000 for 
turning in late and inaccurate blueprints. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman went public with the dispute after he left HPV, charging that Begley had 
deliberately under-reported problems to the county. 
</P>
<P>
Begley, who had hired Bowman, counters that there was no attempt by HPV to 
cover up problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob really wanted to take charge of the work and do it himself and simply 
could not let the Leason Pomeroy firm do its job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Begley and his crew recorded some victories as they found ways to shave 
millions of dollars off the expansion program. For example, the first of 
several terminal parking garages, finished last year and now in service, came 
in under budget. 
</P>
<P>
But the successes have been overshadowed by the problems with Taylor Woodrow. 
At the terminal in particular, Taylor Woodrow claims savings that resulted from 
trimmed frills -- such as seamless glass and a fancy roof -- have evaporated 
over time. Taylor Woodrow blames it on increased construction costs and delays 
beyond its control, but the county and HPV disagree. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the project, county records show, Taylor Woodrow failed to order steel 
for the terminal building for two months even though HPV had authorized it. 
</P>
<P>
Subcontractors were frazzled, complaining that Taylor Woodrow was not paying 
them on time and was ordering design changes without corrected blueprints -- 
only to have to change again when HPV or county officials countermanded the 
instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Some subcontractors were fired. Others said the delays and disputes were simply 
too much to bear so they walked off the project in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
A few subcontractors complained that they got no support from HPV. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Shanazarian, whose Structural Beton firm worked on the project and ended up 
suing Taylor Woodrow for nonpayment, says he tried to warn HPV several times 
that design drawings were incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
"They wouldn't even talk to me about it," Shanazarian recalled recently. "I 
wrote letters. I copied them to the county and to Taylor Woodrow. But I 
couldn't even get an appointment with HPV. They would not see me." 
</P>
<P>
Shanazarian charges that HPV was negligent in not supervising Taylor Woodrow 
more aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
But HPV officials counter that such problems should have been handled by Taylor 
Woodrow. 
</P>
<P>
"It was precisely because we and the county did put pressure on them (Taylor 
Woodrow) that they are now current (in payments to) all the subs," Begley said. 
</P>
<P>
Caught in the cross-fire between subcontractors and Taylor Woodrow, HPV began 
firing off blistering memos and letters criticizing the prime contractor. And 
Taylor Woodrow executives fired back. 
</P>
<P>
The correspondence is laced with invective, airport records show, and at one 
point HPV officials went so far as to accuse Taylor Woodrow of "gross 
negligence" for continuing to work on a defective concrete slab in violation of 
a stop-work notice. 
</P>
<P>
But airport files also contain memos from Taylor Woodrow seeking answers to 
technical questions or emergencies -- sometimes critical to keeping 
subcontractors in place -- only get no response from HPV for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, as the county prepared to strip Taylor Woodrow of the parking 
garage contract, the contractor hired an engineering firm -- Kellogg Corp. -- 
to independently critique its performance. Kellogg engineers ended up generally 
pointing fingers at HPV. 
</P>
<P>
"HPV has not provided adequate coordination and direction to the various 
contractors working on the various and concurrent project work activities," the 
Kellogg report says. 
</P>
<P>
The report mentions one instance, for example, in which HPV took months to 
respond to a Taylor Woodrow request for design information. 
</P>
<P>
HPV officials acknowledge that they have been slow to act on some Taylor 
Woodrow requests, but they also blame the contractor for not supplying 
necessary data. 
</P>
<P>
When Taylor Woodrow recently gave supervisors the Kellogg report in a 
last-ditch effort to keep the parking garage and roadway contract, however, the 
review was dismissed as meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you expect them to say?" Supervisor Stanton asked. "Look who hired 
them." 
</P>
<P>
HPV officials say some of their critics may have had false expectations about 
the degree of control the firm has had over the massive airport project, 
especially since county officials -- not HPV -- were legally required to deal 
with problems affecting project schedules and costs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in some instances, HPV has not performed as well as they should have," 
said Hoyt, of Kellogg Corp. But the consultant agrees that "the relationship 
between HPV and Taylor Woodrow seemed to get off on the wrong foot." 
</P>
<P>
Even with the airport project now apparently nearing the finish line, tensions 
between Taylor Woodrow, HPV and the county continue to run high -- so much so 
that when a county airport official paused last month to watch a tile worker 
lay pieces of marble flooring in the terminal, a Taylor Woodrow executive 
appeared at his side within seconds, according to one observer. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you going to do today," the executive snapped, "that we can sue you 
for?" 
</P>
<P>
HPV: THE $23-MILLION MANAGER 
</P>
<P>
While county officals mostly praise HPV, hired to keep the John Wayne Airport 
expansion on time and on budget, prime contractor Taylor Woodrow Construction 
says the managers have only themselves to blame for problems. HPV -- a 
partnership of three firms -- is being paid $23 million, even though the 
terminal is five months behind schedule and $26 million over budget.

SCHOOL PROVIDES THE SPARK FOR FUTURE LINEMEN;

TRAINING: THESE HARDY MEN AND WOMEN CLIMB POLES AND LEARN TO REPAIR ELECTRICAL 
EQUIPMENT. THEY KNOW THEY ARE BEGINNING A DANGEROUS LINE OF WORK.

They are barely visible over the roof of the school. But as one walks around to 
the rear of Rancho Santiago College, there they stand -- about 30 telephone 
poles in a circular pattern on a small patch of land. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, as every weekend, this suburban Stonehenge is the official 
training ground for union electrical apprentices -- the men and women who erect 
and maintain power lines. 
</P>
<P>
"My whole family's in it, and there's such a sense of accomplishment when 
you're done putting a line up, and you know, in 20 years, you can drive by and 
say, 'Hey, I built that line,' " said Kimberley Rowley, who became on Saturday 
the first woman to graduate from the California-Nevada Joint Apprentice 
Training Center. 
</P>
<P>
Rowley was speaking from a roped-in seat about 10 feet off the ground as she 
and Shannon Skinner worked to fix a transformer cable. 
</P>
<P>
At varying heights on electrical poles around her, other graduates and students 
were working on similar skills: climbing the 25- to 40-foot high poles, using 
long gripping sticks to manipulate simulated high voltage wire, or pulleying up 
a cardiopulmonary-resuscitation dummy to practice first-aid procedures from the 
top of the poles. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the students trained by the utilities programs, most graduates will work 
full time for electrical contractors, and the school is funded entirely by the 
contractors and local electrical unions. 
</P>
<P>
Although the training program uses a classroom and the pole-climbing course at 
the college, there are no special academic requirements. But participants must 
be over 18 and physically fit to climb poles. 
</P>
<P>
"When these individuals graduate from here, they are such a hot item, they get 
picked up right away," explained program instructor Fred Barker. "They are the 
people that Southern California Edison calls when they are understaffed, and 
need a line built . . . or when there's a hurricane or disaster and they need 
the electricity restored quickly." 
</P>
<P>
The professional line worker is a journeyman who moves from job to job on a 
regular basis, explained Barker. To be "in the trade," apprentices must not 
only learn the academics of electrical manipulation, like using transformers or 
which voltages are appropriate for which uses, but must also master any fear of 
heights and the dangers of working with high-voltage electricity. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a saying in the trade that we work with everything from light bulbs to 
lightning bolts," Barker said. The danger in the work is what draws a lot of 
people to the profession, and it also scares a lot of people away, he added. 
</P>
<P>
But for many of the students who graduated on Saturday, line work is just an 
enjoyable way to make a living. A union journeyman is paid about $23 an hour, 
and many of the students say they enjoy the money, being outdoors and getting 
to travel. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, I got interested in the school because I needed the money," 
explained Dean Evans, who will take the journeyman test later this year. "But 
since then, I've learned to revere and respect the linemen. . . . I've seen a 
lot of things in the last few years." 
</P>
<P>
Evans was referring to accidents, which are common for people who spend their 
working hours more than 30 feet in the air. In the four years since he began 
working, Evans said he watched a man fall from the top of a pole and die, and 
saw another man crushed under a falling pole. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very dangerous trade, don't let anyone tell you otherwise," said 
32-year-old Douglas Archibald. "But that's part of the attraction for some 
people; there's a feeling that we're bad and you're not." Denis Nageotte, who 
has also graduated from the program, agreed. "I used to work in a job where you 
had to wear a suit and tie, but this working as a lineman, it gives you a 
chance to use your head and it's still physical." 
</P>
<P>
"Every day is different, and every pole is a different problem."

<TEXT>
<P>
His brow furrowed in concentration, 9-year-old David Ruvolo fell into a 
runner's crouch when the starter raised his revolver in the air. 
</P>
<P>
As the shot from the starting pistol split the humid air, Ruvolo leaped from 
the starting line, never losing his lead on the pack of seven runners who 
huffed and puffed the long 50 yards to the yellow police tape. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends thought I was going to be beat," Ruvolo said happily as he stood 
panting in the middle of the grassy track of the John Ward Athletic Field at 
Rancho Santiago College's Santa Ana campus. "(But) I did it." 
</P>
<P>
Ruvolo was one of about 200 county children who gathered to participate in 
Saturday's 13th annual Children's Track and Field Meet, sponsored by the Santa 
Ana Police Department and the city's Community Oriented Policing Assn. to 
promote charity, drug awareness and a healthy sense of competition. 
</P>
<P>
The meet for children ages 7 to 12 offered a day of fun and laughter, but it 
also allowed police and community leaders one more opportunity to convey the 
familiar and serious message: "Say No To Drugs." 
</P>
<P>
The track meet offered first-, second- and third-place medals in six events: a 
100-yard run, a 75-yard run, a 50-yard run, a softball toss, a long jump and an 
obstacle course. 
</P>
<P>
The local Elks lodge and Rancho Santiago College funded the event. 
</P>
<P>
The half-hour anti-drug rally that preceded the competition was interrupted for 
about five minutes by a sudden but short cloudburst that soaked the onlookers 
and sent the children scurrying for cover. Other than that, the meet went on 
without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic gold medal winners Steve Lewis and Danny Everett, world champion 
hurdler Kevin Young and actors Dan Fischman and Reginald Veljohnson were 
invited by the Police Department to sign autographs and help spread the message 
that illegal drugs are harmful. 
</P>
<P>
Fischman, a stand-up comic, is best known for his character Arvid, the nerdy 
but brilliant student in the television sitcom "Head of the Class."

<P>
Veljohnson has a starring role in the television series "Family Matters" and 
played the helpful policeman in the motion picture "Die Hard," starring Bruce 
Willis. He is also starring in the sequel, "Die Hard 2; Die Harder." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty athletic myself," Fischman told the crowd of kids, parents and 
friends who had lined up on the bleachers at 9:30 a.m. "In fact, I'm doing a 
commercial for a fitness center. I played the guy named 'Before.' " 
</P>
<P>
Then Fischman launched into his pitch for the children to stay away from drugs, 
talking about lost careers he has seen among fellow comedians and actors who 
have become addicted to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"It drives them right down to the ground," he said. "It's a terrible thing. We 
can have a lot of fun without it." 
</P>
<P>
Plans for this year's track meet began three months ago, when the Police 
Department sent flyers to schools, churches and youth organizations throughout 
the county, police spokeswoman Gloria Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
The flyers sparked the interest of some of the county's most athletically 
inclined youngsters, Perez said. But they came not only to participate in their 
favorite track events but also to enjoy the upbeat, anti-drug speeches. 
</P>
<P>
The children's only fee to enter the contest was a can of food, which will be 
given to needy families in Santa Ana at Christmastime, Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
"We just want to show the better part of law enforcement," said Officer Art 
Morales, who took the job of announcer for the day. "These kids are under a lot 
of peer pressure in their neighborhoods (to use drugs and join gangs). We want 
to show them that we care and there's a positive side to us." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some parents said that they actively pursue weekend activities such as 
the Children's Track Meet to keep their children's minds and bodies occupied on 
something more positive than drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Rosie Toffolla of Santa Ana beamed when her 8-year-old daughter Vanessa came 
running to where her mother was sitting, clutching two medals. Vanessa, who 
hopes to be a dancer, earned a gold medal in her age group for the obstacle 
race and a silver medal for the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
Vanessa joined many of the children who cheered wildly when Santa Ana Policeman 
John Reed talked about the evils of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"She is totally against that, but she's well aware of it," Rosie Toffolla said. 
"She knows what it can do to people, that it can destroy them." 
</P>
<P>
Reed set up a display that showed dirty needles, crack, and photos of arms and 
necks ruined by needle marks. 
</P>
<P>
One display showed a series of mug shots of the same woman, who was arrested 
several times. The pictures graphically illustrated her deteriorating condition 
from drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gross," said 12-year-old Omar Cordero, looking at the picture display. 
"She got old really fast, didn't she?" 
</P>
<P>
Standing on the sidelines watching the 75-yard races, Reed said that it was 
satisfying to see dozens of schoolchildren he has met during his weekly drug 
abuse prevention programs now come up to him and joke around. 
</P>
<P>
"Teaching these kids to respond to different things and to see us as a positive 
force helps build relationships," he said. "It goes a long way to encourage 
them to do well."

PROSECUTORS AND DEFENDERS URGED TO CONFER ON COURT REFORM INITIATIVE 
</P>

<P>
In the wake of Tuesday's approval of Proposition 115, Orange County deputy 
prosecutors last week were learning how to implement the statewide court reform 
initiative, while public defenders were discussing how to keep prosecutors from 
ever using the measure's provisions. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most judges in the courthouse went about their business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Presiding Superior Court Judge James L. Smith said the initiative 
could seriously affect business in the county's courts. But, he added: 
"Proposition 115 is one of those Bott's dots in the freeway of life. It's not 
going to cause any serious damage to the mechanism." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Smith said, he plans to call a meeting next week of judges, 
prosecutors and public defenders to discuss making Proposition 115 work. 
</P>
<P>
The measure was designed to speed up the time between arrest and trial and to 
shorten the lengths of major trials. 
</P>
<P>
For example, procedures in preliminary hearings will be shortened, because 
police officers will be able to provide hearsay testimony. Instead of 10 
witnesses testifying, the police officer who interviewed the witnesses can 
testify for all of them, including the victim. 
</P>
<P>
But defense lawyers say this is just one of many provisions in the initiative 
that curtails a defendant's right to a fair trial. That's why the county public 
defender's office is planning either to file its own test case or to join 
others in the state in challenging the constitutionality of the initiative in 
the California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative, all sides agree, swings the pendulum away from individual 
rights and toward the district attorney, representing the people. 
</P>
<P>
For example, defendants have always had a right to demand a trial within 60 
days. Under Proposition 115, the people, represented by county prosecutors, 
have that same 60-day right. 
</P>
<P>
That's one that worries Judge Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"The initiative gives prosecutors an opportunity, really, to manipulate the 
system," the judge said. "If prosecutors start coming in and demanding we go to 
trial on all these cases within 60 days, that could jam up the system." 
</P>
<P>
Chief Deputy Public Defender Carl C. Holmes said it is too early to know how 
serious the friction over Proposition 115 will be in the county's courts. But a 
few problems have occurred already over discovery issues, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery is an important legal term that in the past has meant that the 
accused has the right to see all of the evidence against him. Before 
Proposition 115, a defendant had the right to see within 48 hours the initial 
police report that led to charges against him. That is eliminated under the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is left to the prosecutors' discretion when to make police reports 
available, up to 60 days before the trial. Most prosecutors statewide generally 
agree that it will usually be in their interest to let a defendant's attorney 
see those reports right away, to pave the way for a quick guilty plea. 
</P>
<P>
However, as soon as Proposition 115 passed Tuesday, Holmes said, a few local 
prosecutors began balking at requests for evidence against a defendant, 
including police reports. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Maurice L. Evans said that is one reason for the 
training session Friday: to make sure that all prosecutors understand 
Proposition 115 and that the office acts with some uniformity. 
</P>
<P>
"This initiative is one of those situations where we'll just have to feel our 
way along for a while," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that the public defenders will get their way on one major issue: 
They want Proposition 115 to apply only to cases that came to court after 
Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office will go along with that for now, said Assistant 
Dist. Atty. John D. Conley, who helped with Friday's training. The reason: 
Prosecutors do not want to end up losing a good case on appeal later by 
insisting that Proposition 115 provisions be applied retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
Such differences are why Smith said that everyone involved should confer. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't going to set any policy; we're just going to talk," Smith said. "We 
can't tell each other how to do our jobs, but we all work in a common 
environment, and this is a common problem." 
</P>
<P>
While Proposition 115 primarily intensifies differences between prosecutors and 
defense attorneys, one of its major provisions may pit them together against 
the judges. The initiative is designed to speed up trials by having judges 
control the voir dire, or questioning, of prospective jurors. Up until the 
initiative's passage, such questioning has always been dominated by the 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of D.A.s ask us to join in some kind of task force to get the 
judges to look at that section very liberally," defense lawyer Holmes said. 
"Many of them don't like it any better than we do." 
</P>
<P>
But that is yet to be ironed out. Smith said judges have a different view "A 
lot of judges consider that a strong section. A lot of them think there are 
some major economies in court time that can now be saved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While it is too early to tell whether Proposition 115 will create a dilemma in 
the county, Presiding Judge Leonard Goldstein said he is not too worried. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys will make it work, he said, at the same time that they are 
fighting to get it ruled unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
"They won't want to shoot holes in the boat just to prove anything," he said. 
"The people who practice law in this county are very civilized."

MCCASKILL EXITS EARLY, BUT WINS

<P>
Kirk McCaskill earned his second victory in his past seven outings Saturday, 
but he wasn't able to enjoy it completely. 
</P>
<P>
Presented with more offensive support than in his previous six starts combined, 
McCaskill appeared certain to go nine innings for the first time this season. 
Stiffness in his elbow forced him to leave after 5 1/3 innings, but that was 
enough for him to be credited with the victory in the Angels' 8-3 rout of the 
Texas Rangers at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill (4-3) gave up one run and five hits before exiting. The 29-year-old 
right-hander was forced to miss a start on May 16 for the same reason, but it 
was not immediately clear whether the problem he experienced Saturday was the 
same as his previous ailment. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels used home runs by Brian Downing, Rick Schu and Dick Schofield to 
build a 7-1 lead through six innings, the 10th time this season they have hit 
three or more homers in one game. Each homer was distinctive: Downing's home 
run led off the game and was the 19th leadoff homer of his career, Schu's homer 
was his second in two nights and Schofield's was his first hit of the season in 
11 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Schu's homer highlighted a five-run fourth, the Angels' best single-inning 
production this season. In that inning, the Angels chased Texas starter Mike 
Jeffcoat (1-2), who had pitched a complete game against them last Saturday in a 
6-3 Ranger victory at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Eichhorn, who pitched the final inning, was making his sixth appearance in 
nine days. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels struck at their first opportunity against Jeffcoat, as Downing 
lofted a 3-2 pitch into the left-field seats. It was his fourth home run of the 
season and his first leadoff homer since April 5, 1989 against the Chicago 
White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels stirred again in the fourth, scoring their five runs after two were 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Chili Davis drew a leadoff walk and after Dave Winfield flied to center, moved 
to third on Dante Bichette's ground out. Davis scored on Lance Parrish's line 
single to left. Schu took two balls and then slammed a 406-foot home run to 
left-center, his fourth homer of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Schofield walked and went to second when Downing singled to center, which was 
enough for Texas Manager Bobby Valentine. He sent for Jamie Moyer, who didn't 
fare much better. Moyer walked Donnie Hill to load the bases and gave up a 
two-run single to Wally Joyner, who was back in the lineup after missing 
Friday's game because of a sore right knee. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill faltered a bit in the fifth, when Harold Baines and Pete Incaviglia 
lined back-to-back singles, but he got out of trouble by getting John Russell 
to fly to center and Steve Buechele to hit into a force play. However, he 
wasn't as fortunate in the sixth, as Texas ended his shutout and ended his 
evening after 5 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Former Angel Gary Pettis led off with a fly to the warning track in left that 
flew over the glove of left fielder Davis for a triple. Jeff Huson walked on 
four pitches, but McCaskill got Rafael Palmeiro to take a third strike. Franco 
lined a 3-1 pitch just past McCaskill's head, scoring Pettis, and Huston 
scrambled to third when the ball hopped out of Bichette's glove in center. 
</P>
<P>
Angel pitching coach Marcel Lachemann promptly came out of the dugout to take 
out McCaskill and bring in Scott Bailes, who got Ruben Sierra out on a popup to 
short left. Franco stole second but was stranded there as Bailes got Baines to 
ground back to him for an easy relay to first. 
</P>
<P>
Schofield extended the lead to 7-1 in the sixth, when he propelled a 3-1 pitch 
from Moyer into the left-field bullpen. It was his first home run since last 
July 25 at Oakland and his first at Anaheim Stadium since last July 22 against 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers produced an even better display of home run power in the seventh 
inning. Incaviglia led off by blasting Bailes' first pitch to deep center for 
his 10th home run of the season and Russell followed by hitting his first homer 
of the season, also on the first pitch, to left-center. That brought Lachemann 
to the mound for a conference. Whatever he said was effective, as Bailes 
retired the next three batters. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels padded their lead to 8-3 in the seventh without a hit. A pair of 
walks, a ground out and a passed ball brought Winfield in with that last run. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Johnny Ray was placed on the 15-day disabled list because of a 
strained right shoulder, and third baseman Jack Howell was activated after 
recovering from a sprained left knee. available. . . . Kent Anderson (sprained 
right shoulder) is eligible to be activated Monday and said he expects to be 
ready. Anderson was put on the 15-day DL on May 20 and later shifted to the 
21-day list. . . . Mark McLemore, who was sent to Triple A Edmonton on May 24 
on rehabilitation, was transferred to the 21-day DL after spraining his right 
wrist again. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels signed five draft picks, including 24th-round selection Don Barbara 
of Cal State Long Beach, a first baseman who was the Big West Player of the 
Year, and catcher Eric Buechele of Servite High School and Fresno State. Also 
signed were second-round pick Phillip Leftwich, a right-handed pitcher at 
Radford University, third-rounder Brandon Markiewicz, a shortstop from Dixie 
Hollins High School and 16th-round pick Wayne Johnson, a shortstop from 
Oklahoma Christian College.

WHEN THE ANGELS FIND THEMSELVES IN A BIND, SCHU COMES TO THE RESCUE 
</P>

<P>
The Angels keep finding themselves in binds this season, because of this injury 
and that, one situation or another. 
</P>
<P>
More than once, Rick Schu has been the man to help them out. 
</P>
<P>
When the Angels needed an emergency pitcher last month because Kirk McCaskill 
had a tender elbow and Chuck Finley had twisted an ankle, they went to Schu. 
</P>
<P>
Not to pitch, of course, but to make way for Mike Fetters, who was called up 
from triple-A Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
"There were only a few guys they could ask to do it," said Schu, a third 
baseman. "They figured I'd be the guy to do it for them." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't matter to Schu that he could have refused the assignment to Edmonton 
because he has more than five years' major league experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I did it for the team," said Schu, who was back in Anaheim in about a week. 
"We were in a bad situation and needed a pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
The latest favor has been one he has not only agreed to, but one he has 
relished. With Jack Howell out with a sprained left knee, he has started the 
past 11 games at third base. 
</P>
<P>
In the past eight days, he has thrived at the plate, hitting three homers, 
including a two-run shot in the Angels' 8-3 victory Saturday. He also homered 
Friday night. Saturday night's homer came off Ranger starter Mike Jeffcoat, who 
had also given up a homer to Schu last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit pretty much the same pitch," Schu said. "A ball, up in the zone. I think 
it was a changeup." 
</P>
<P>
Being a regular -- or at least a temporary regular -- has given Schu a chance 
to feel good at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to get the at-bats. You can get in a groove," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he knows as well as anyone that with Howell's activation Saturday, he will 
be out of the groove soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect to be on the bench," Schu said. "But (Manager Doug Rader) finds a way 
to get guys in." 
</P>
<P>
Rader is pleased with what Schu has done and won't have any part of discussing 
the four errors Schu committed in the past week -- including a critical one in 
a 1-0 loss to the Rangers Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"He's done a terrific job," Rader said. "He's driven in some runs, and that's 
been important. Let's talk about what a good job he's doing for us. Those 
things (errors) happen. The fact of the matter is, he's contributed greatly to 
our success. We've all been very appreciative." 
</P>
<P>
Schu is not a guy who has longstanding ties to the Angels, just a 28-year-old 
player they signed in February. But after several seasons in Philadelphia, 
where he was once slated to replace Mike Schmidt, and after stints in Baltimore 
and Detroit last season, he was ready to go somewhere else and stay. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to win," Schu said. "I played the last couple of years for some 
teams that didn't win." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't hurt that his chance came in California. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played my whole career on the East Coast," said Schu, who played at 
Sacramento City College. "I'm from California. It's nice being here." 
</P>
<P>
With Howell back, Schu expects things to change. Howell entered Saturday's game 
in the ninth as a defensive replacement, already beginning Schu's latest 
reshuffling. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been great just coming to the park, knowing you were in the lineup," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But that will change. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done this before," Schu said. "It used to be that Schmidt would go down 
for a couple of weeks every year, and be on the DL for 15 days." 
</P>
<P>
And if experience proves the rule, as long as he's with the Angels, some bind 
seems sure to come along.

ANGELS DRAFT TODD BLYLEVEN IN 39TH ROUND

Villa Park High School pitcher Todd Blyleven, son of Angels' pitcher Bert, was 
the club's 39th-round pick in last week's free agent amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
Todd, 8-2 as a senior with a 1.26 earned-run average and 80 strikeouts, has 
been offered a scholarship by Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"He has some options to consider and we're keeping both avenues open," said 
Bert, who was a third-round pick from Santiago High School in Garden Grove in 
1969. "We have to take into consideration where the Angels would expect him to 
go, the money, things like that. I'm his father first. My only concern is for 
my son." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven said he'd love to have his son as his Angel teammate. "It would 
definitely be a good feeling if that could happen," he said. "I wouldn't mind 
(retiring) if my son could take my place. That wouldn't be bad." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Mike Bradish of Christ College Irvine has signed with the Chicago 
White Sox. Bradish, a first baseman who batted .325 with 30 RBIs and seven home 
runs, was drafted in the 13th round. 
</P>
<P>
Buster Nietzke, an outfielder at Saddleback College, was drafted by the 
Milwaukee Brewers in the 23rd round. Nietzke, an first team all-Orange Empire 
selection as a freshman, doesn't expect to sign with Milwaukee this year.

TOUGH RULES ON HAZARDOUS WASTE ADOPTED BY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SANTA FE SPRINGS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This city has courted industry for decades and is accustomed to the sights, 
sounds and smells of zinc plating, printing, metallurgy, adhesive manufacturing 
and oil refining. It has more than 3,000 businesses packed into nine square 
miles and a daytime work force that swells the population of 16,000 to more 
than 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
But last month the industry-friendly city began looking for a way to say no to 
one of the state's booming enterprises: treatment of hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
In its May 24 meeting, the City Council unanimously adopted a customized plan 
to manage hazardous waste. The plan establishes a legal basis for turning away 
a company that stores or treats hazardous waste. As a result of the city's 
action, such a treatment business will find it more difficult to prove its 
operation safe enough for Santa Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
"We would hope that Santa Fe Springs would not become a giant treatment 
facility," Mayor Al Sharp said. 
</P>
<P>
No one wants such treatment operations, certainly not people who must live near 
them or politicians who seek reelection. But the waste has to go somewhere, and 
Los Angeles County generates more of it than any county in the state. Although 
the vast majority of this waste is neutralized where it is produced, in 1986 
alone about 430,000 tons had to be shipped to places as distant as Minnesota 
and Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
This waste is not newspapers or aluminum cans, but toxic, infected, flammable 
and cancer-causing industrial and medical byproducts, such as solvents, 
asbestos, hospital wastes, oil and paint. 
</P>
<P>
The risk of a toxic accident increases when the wastes are transported. And 
fewer regions are content to remain dumping grounds for poisons from Los 
Angeles. The Alabama Legislature, for instance, recently tried to bar the 
import of toxic waste from California, said Mike Mohajer, a specialist on 
hazardous wastes with the county Department of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
As of May 9, federal law bars ordinary landfills from accepting untreated 
hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, Los Angeles has to deal with its own waste. County officials 
estimate that may mean up to 15 additional treatment, incineration and storage 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"All communities would like to keep them out," Mayor Sharp said. 
"Unfortunately, that's not even a realistic thought or approach." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the state passed legislation that allowed an appeals board to overturn 
a city's decision to deny permits for recycling and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first legislation that, in essence, takes away control of land use 
from local government," Mohajer said. 
</P>
<P>
Or, as Sharp put it: "Big Brother can come along and say, 'This is what you're 
going to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe Springs officials became particularly concerned after looking over a 
county map that they could only interpret as ominous. Shaded portions represent 
"general areas potentially suitable for . . . hazardous waste management 
facilities." 
</P>
<P>
Most of Santa Fe Springs qualifies. The reason for this is simple: Heavy 
manufacturing is zoned in 60% of the city. By contrast, about 8% of Whittier is 
zoned that way, and 2.7% of Pico Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
So instead of adopting the county plan for managing waste, Santa Fe Springs 
devised and approved its own before a May 30 deadline. Many other cities have 
not taken that deadline seriously, but Santa Fe Springs officials believe they 
can't afford to take chances. 
</P>
<P>
Leigh DeSantis, the city's environmental manager, said her city's customized 
plan differs from the county's in key areas: 
</P>
<P>
Any waste facility must be at least 1,000 feet from neighborhoods, schools, 
parks, hospitals and nursing homes. The county plan sets a distance for storage 
facilities but not treatment plants. 
</P>
<P>
There is a larger safety zone between a treatment facility and a well or 
earthquake zone. In areas of shallow ground water, such facilities are 
forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
The city can assume the operation is unsafe until the operator proves 
otherwise. DeSantis grants that this provision places a daunting burden of 
proof on applicants: "We would rather err on the side of protection. With a 
toxic substance, it can be 20 or 30 years before you can demonstrate what the 
negative effect is. It took 30 years to see how DDT got into the food chain." 
</P>
<P>
The introduction of new hazardous wastes is limited. In Santa Fe Springs, "we 
don't generate infectious waste to speak of," DeSantis said, so "we would not 
be enthused about getting an infectious-waste incinerator. Given the volume and 
range of things already here, if we don't generate it, we don't want to treat 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Santa Fe Springs has problems of its own, including two designated 
toxic dumps and a score of suspect plots left from a time when there was less 
control of toxic waste. 
</P>
<P>
A 1989 study commissioned by the city showed that Santa Fe Springs generates 
more than 15,000 tons of hazardous waste per year. And county researchers found 
that in 1986, the only county cities that shipped out more hazardous waste 
annually than tiny Santa Fe Springs were Los Angeles, Long Beach, Torrance, El 
Segundo and Carson. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can deal with what we have here already," DeSantis said, "we've done our 
part." 
</P>
<P>
In the view of Mohajer, the city's bid to control the import of hazardous waste 
may fail as the state wearies of communities trying to keep out such facilities 
at all costs. He predicted that a court will decide the issue.

MUSEUM USES WHODUNIT TO LURE YOUNGER PATRONS

LONG BEACH

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The museum-goers eyed each other suspiciously as they gathered in the courtyard 
of the Long Beach Museum of Art for an unveiling on a recent Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Some guests whispered that the donated painting was a forgery. All of them knew 
someone in their midst was about to be murdered. 
</P>
<P>
Mildred, the museum's doddering assistant director, ushered people into the 
gift shop. Rebecca stood alone in the garden, winking at men who looked her 
way. Lance drank a whole bottle of champagne at the bar. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was Frank, who arrived with two women, spoke loudly about his past 
wives and confessed that he had never been to the museum. Frank, no doubt, was 
a man to watch this evening. 
</P>
<P>
But Frank Pepe was not in the cast of "Consequences," a mystery dinner theater 
being held at the museum every Friday night through November. He was a guest 
attending this unique fund-raiser staged to recruit new and younger customers 
to the museum, which has drawn mostly senior citizens. The idea is to 
incorporate the museum's exhibits, gardens and gift shop at 2300 Ocean Blvd. 
into a whodunit so that the museum can attract a wider audience. 
</P>
<P>
"I've driven down Ocean Boulevard for years, and I never knew this was here," 
said Pepe, a Fullerton ad salesman. "I'm sure I'll be back, now that I know 
it's here." 
</P>
<P>
A Long Beach friend of Pepe, Jeanette Brown, said she had visited the museum 
once but would like to return because a cast member told her the exhibit 
changes every six weeks. Meanwhile, Pepe and his daughter, Darlene Sternberg of 
Simi Valley, eavesdropped on the characters and compared notes. Pepe solved the 
crime and was named the evening's super sleuth. 
</P>
<P>
The mystery centers on a work of art -- actually commissioned for this show -- 
donated by fictional Long Beach socialite J.W. Bennett, who brings a voluptuous 
wife half his age. Bennett soon alienates many of the guests with his 
pomposity, and no one is surprised when he is poisoned soon after dinner. The 
plot and the murderer are the same each night, but groups that have solved the 
mystery are asked not to give away the secret to their friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would I want to kill one of the most famous people in Long Beach?" one 
cast member said after being accused by a member of the audience. "After all, 
there are so few." 
</P>
<P>
The cast takes the 50 guests through every corner of the red-brick museum, 
including the video library, offices and both floors of the gallery in search 
for clues. Along the way, characters talk about the museum and comment on the 
art. 
</P>
<P>
"This piece looks like an altar to bird droppings," Rebecca said to guests 
gathered around a permanent metallic sculpture in the gardens. The audience 
follows her and catches snippets of an argument between two characters on a 
nearby balcony. When the cast members on the balcony see that the guests are 
watching, they rush inside. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the best laughs of the night are unscripted lines made by guests. "And 
he did these while studying in school," the curator said, explaining some 
abstract olive-green paintings in the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"Was that grade school?" interrupted Delores Morgan, a Long Beach resident 
celebrating her birthday at the event. The curator acted put off by the 
outburst and laughter. The actors stayed in character, dined among the guests 
and toasted Morgan's birthday at dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"We love people interrupting us, unlike other shows where it's inappropriate," 
said actor Rory Johnston, who was playing Lance, a dashing character over whom 
Morgan swooned all during the show. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, it hasn't thrown us off, because we incorporate the guests into the 
story," said Shakespearean-trained actress Terra Shelman, whose character, 
Rebecca, was being consoled by one of the guests, under the watchful eye of the 
guest's wife. 
</P>
<P>
In a mock news clip, the actual museum director, Joan Van Hooten, is 
interviewed. The previous director supposedly died after falling off a cliff 
behind the museum, and a serious story turns hysterical as a reporter 
interviews the surfer who found the body. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of fun," Van Hooten said about the fund-raiser, which started a 
month ago. "We've already had such good response." 
</P>
<P>
The food served in "Consequences" is catered by local Long Beach restaurants. 
The whole evening costs $49.50, with some proceeds going to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
The idea came from Brian Mann, director and co-author, who plays a character 
known as "one of the Long Beach police's rankest officers." Mann started a 
similar mystery dinner theater in Laguna Beach about a year ago. "People come 
here (Long Beach) and really get caught up in the story with us, and that's 
what makes this different." 
</P>
<P>
Dwayne Larson, a Long Beach high school psychologist who bore the brunt of many 
jokes because he spoke up so often, said the event piqued his interest in the 
museum -- so he would return. Many guests thought Larson was part of the act. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an interesting evening," Larson said dryly. "It's the first play I've 
ever been to where I've been accused of murder."

COMPTON WILL BE URGED TO FORECLOSE ON HOTEL PROJECT

<TEXT>
<P>
The developer of the ill-fated Compton Lazben Hotel has failed to meet a 
deadline for paying $6.8 million in construction loans that he owes the city, 
and two council members said they will propose that the city take over the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Compton redevelopment officials billed the $35-million hotel and convention 
center complex along the Redondo Beach Freeway as the catalyst for the city's 
economic revitalization, but from its inception about five years ago, the 
project has been plagued with delays and financial difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Maxcy D. Filer said he plans to propose that the council begin 
foreclosure proceedings against developer Naftali Deutsch. Councilwoman 
Patricia A. Moore also said she would support such a move, which would have to 
be approved by a majority of the five-member council. 
</P>
<P>
"Why shouldn't the city be responsible and take back the hotel and supply 
everything the citizens were promised?" Moore asked. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of their agreement with the city, the developers were to pay 
off the loans by May 31, according to a report that the staff of the city 
Redevelopment Agency sent the council last week. 
</P>
<P>
Deutsch said, however, that his agreements with the city were written in such a 
way that it was "understood" that he did not have to pay off the loans until 
the hotel generated a sufficient cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
Deutsch also said he is "days away" from reaching a franchise agreement with 
the Hilton Hotel Corp. A top city administrator said City Manager Howard 
Caldwell is taking part in the talks with Hilton. Caldwell and Hilton 
representatives did not return calls from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Filer, however, said he is skeptical about any franchise discussions: "I don't 
want to upset any negotiations, but I just believe this is a ploy." 
</P>
<P>
The developer has earned the enmity of some people in Compton, who say he has 
not lived up to the terms of his development contract. Deutsch halted 
construction several times, saying he needed more money. The city gave him more 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
"Here when people are five days late paying their water bills (to the city), 
they get their water turned off," Moore said, "and this man can go on never 
paying a dime to us." 
</P>
<P>
Filer said: "He has been in default as a contractor for over two years. He has 
been in default of the loan (payments) over 10 months. He is now in default on 
the loan." 
</P>
<P>
According to Filer and Moore, the developers owe the city more than $400,000 in 
interest payments, in addition to the $6.8 million in principal that was due 
last week. The city and the developers have been arguing for two years about 
whether the project was built to the city's specifications. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, saying some of the furnishings and construction materials did 
not meet specifications, withheld some payments from the construction firm, 
Tucon Development, until it replaced some of the items. 
</P>
<P>
The Deutsch family owns Tucon and other construction companies that worked on 
the hotel. Deutsch's son, Benjamin, said his father now has no financial 
interest in any of the construction companies or any of the financial or 
management companies involved in the hotel development. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Deutsch said he and his three brothers own and control all the various 
firms.

DOCTORS WANT DUMP CLOSED TO SAFEGUARD WATER SUPPLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 35-member governing body of the Los Angeles County Medical Assn., citing 
risks to the San Gabriel Valley's underground water supply, has endorsed a 
resolution opposing expansion of the Azusa landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The medical group adopted a position paper that calls for the landfill's 
operator to close the dump and to "acknowledge that the Azusa site is not 
suitable for a landfill." 
</P>
<P>
Controversy has surrounded the expansion by Azusa Land Reclamation Co., even 
though it has received approval from local and state water boards. In addition, 
a Los Angeles Superior Court judge in April ruled in favor of the dump's 
expansion. But that decision was appealed last month by the Metropolitan Water 
District of Southern California and San Gabriel Valley water officials, who say 
the expansion threatens an already contaminated ground-water supply. 
</P>
<P>
The medical association, which has 10,000 physicians as members, joins a 
diverse group of dump expansion opponents, including the Environmental Defense 
Fund and the March of Dimes. 
</P>
<P>
Operators of the dump, whose parent firm is Browning-Ferris Industries, 
maintain that their facility is state of the art and that great lengths have 
been taken to protect the environment around the landfill.

Forget about Dick and Jane. 
</P>
<P>
In this storybook world, radish-munching rabbits consult psychiatrists, fat 
mice inhabit a planet with shopping malls made of Swiss cheese, and scary 
creatures speak through Ouija boards. 
</P>
<P>
And every one of the 274 youthful authors receives a prize. 
</P>
<P>
Elementary and junior high students from 13 school districts displayed their 
works at the East San Gabriel Valley Reading Council's Young Authors' 
Conference, held May 22 at the Performing Arts Center at Citrus College in 
Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
This year's offerings ranged from whimsical fantasy to serious social 
commentary, with some instructional tomes thrown in for good measure. 
</P>
<P>
There is the psychological drama of Billabee Rabbit, who prefers radishes to 
carrots. In "The Rabbit Who Ate Radishes" by Alisia Tran, a second-grade pupil 
at Cullen School in Glendora, Billabee's concerned parents take him to a 
psychiatrist to help him get over his craving. But Billabee's preference 
prevails in the end when he turns red after eating one radish too many at a 
rabbit picnic. His color enables him to scare away a fox with a phobia. (He's 
afraid of red.) 
</P>
<P>

 On a lighter note, William Young, a fifth-grader at Evergreen School in 
Diamond Bar, spun a first-person tale of being abducted by fat mice in UFOs who 
transport him to a mouse planet where he shops at a mall made of Swiss cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Valencia, a third-grade pupil at Dalton School in Azusa, offered tips 
on building a snowman: 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing you've got to find is a mountain with snow. Then park your car 
or else your car will run through a house." 
</P>
<P>
In "The Moving Glass," Ann Mijares, an eighth-grader at Torch Middle School in 
Industry, told a ghostly story involving the supernatural Amy, who speaks 
through a Ouija board and gets even when people ask her rude questions. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Welch, staff development specialist at the Hacienda La Puente Unified 
School District's Instructional Services Center, said the annual event, now in 
its ninth year, is designed to reward and stimulate literary efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be a reason to write," said Welch, who chaired the conference. 
"And when a student is honored in front of a thousand people, that's got to be 
an incentive." 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1,200 people -- young authors and their parents, friends and 
teachers -- jammed the auditorium for the afternoon event. Certificates were 
awarded to each participant, and about 50 blue ribbons were bestowed for 
special efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Some students watched in delight as their stories were dramatized by 
Imagination Machine, a children's theater group based in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Dawn Brandi Anderson, a fifth-grader at Los Altos Elementary School in Hacienda 
Heights who offered a poetic appreciation of felines in her illustrated story 
"Cats in the Mood," said her work was inspired by real life. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking of my own cat, and I tried to be as descriptive as I could," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
She added that she wants to be a children's author of "realistic fiction" when 
she grows up. Meanwhile, she is getting plenty of feedback at home. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad, mom and brother look at my work," she said, "and give me 
encouragement." 
</P>
<P>
Other participants showed less interest in a writing career. Michael D'Elia, a 
second-grader at Magnolia School in Azusa who wrote and illustrated "What I Saw 
at the Ocean," said he has other career plans: second baseman for the Angels.

DOCTOR GETS 16 MONTHS IN PRISON FOR MEDI-CAL FRAUD

A doctor who headed a Huntington Park clinic has been sentenced to 16 months in 
prison and fined $347,000 on 17 felony and misdemeanor charges, including 
collecting false Medi-Cal claims and aiding employees who practiced medicine 
without a license. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Suresh Gandotra, 41, was taken into custody after sentencing recently. 
Gandotra's wife, Rita, 39, was sentenced to 180 days in County Jail, five 
years' probation and fined $10,000 on five felony counts of Medi-Cal fraud and 
grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
An appeal is pending, said lawyer Daryl L. Smith, who represents the Gandotras. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Richard Rojo presented evidence during the trial that 
indicated the Gandotras defrauded the state of $8,600 by billing Medi-Cal for 
services provided by unlicensed employees and for services never rendered. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court jury in March found Dr. Gandotra guilty of 14 felony counts 
and three misdemeanor counts ranging from grand theft related to fraudulent 
Medi-Cal claims, to aiding and abetting the unlawful practice of medicine. Rita 
Gandotra was found guilty of five felony counts of filing false Medi-Cal 
claims, conspiracy to cheat the government and grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
Rojo said Dr. Gandotra performed only about 10% of the services that were 
required to be rendered by a licensed physician. Unlicensed employees -- 
doctors from Mexico who were not licensed to practice in the United States -- 
provided the bulk of the medical services, Rojo said. 
</P>
<P>
Rojo said he did not know how many patients received medical care and 
prescriptions from unlicensed personnel at Gandotra's Coast Urgent Care Medical 
Clinic. The clinic's clientele generally is poor and Spanish-speaking. Rojo 
alleged in a Superior Court trial that the fraudulent billing and unlawful 
practice of medicine had been going on at least since 1983. He said there was 
no evidence that clients had been injured. 
</P>
<P>
"Hundreds came in and out," Rojo said. "They were open 24 hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
The case was referred to the attorney general's office after state auditors 
detected a suspiciously high number of Medi-Cal claims, Rojo said. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Urgent Care Medical Clinic will continue to operate out of a 
one-story building on Soto Street near Slauson Avenue, acting administrator 
James Bartholomew said this week. Gandotra had run the clinic until he was 
jailed last week. Another doctor has been brought in to treat patients, 
Bartholomew said. 
</P>
<P>
Gandotra and two clinic employees, Carlos Cuellar and Ricardo Santos, were 
arrested at the clinic and charged in January, 1989. Rita Gandotra and a 
billing clerk were charged later. 
</P>
<P>
Cuellar and Santos, who originally were charged with practicing medicine 
without a license, among other things, each pleaded no contest to two 
misdemeanor counts of forging prescriptions. Cuellar and Santos, both doctors 
in Mexico, were given two years' probation, fined $1,500 and ordered to perform 
100 hours of community service, Rojo said. The two testified against the 
Gandotras. 
</P>
<P>
Charges were dropped against the billing clerk.

FOUR RACES TO WATCH IN NOVEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County Superintendent of Schools 
</P>
<P>
How They Fared in Tuesday's Primary 
</P>
<P>
Peterson: 43% 
</P>
<P>
Dean: 44% 
</P>
<P>
The combatants: Robert D. Peterson, a 24-year-incumbent, takes on Whittier 
College Prof. John F. Dean and Peterson will tout his experience and longtime 
support of academic competition. . . . It's Peterson's toughest battle in two 
decades, and support for him among district superintendents is soft. . . . "I 
don't know very many superintendents who would support Bob Peterson's candidacy 
for another term," says one. 
</P>
<P>
The job: Supervises special education programs and services to local districts. 
. . . Pays relatively well -- at $98,633 a year, it's one of the top 
public-education posts in California. 
</P>
<P>
Hot issue: Dean would abolish the ejected superintendent's post and replace it 
with an appointed one. . . . That's not popular with county voters. They've 
rejected it twice. 
</P>
<P>
Early outlook: Peterson holds the fund-raising edge and says he'll spend 
whatever it takes. . . . Dean will batter Peterson with grand jury reports 
criticizing his department's management. Look for this race to get dirty early. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor, District 2 
</P>
<P>
How They Fared in Tuesday's Primary 
</P>
<P>
Neugebauer: 20% 
</P>
<P>
Wieder: 47% 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The combatants: Three-term Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder faces Joy L. 
Neugebauer, 18-year veteran of the Westminster City Council. . . . Not since 
1980 has a supervisor been dumped from the post, and the loser in that contest 
was under indictment. . . . Wieder has her own troubles: She blew a race for 
Congress two years ago after discovery that she lied about earning a college 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
Hot issue: Wieder. She says she has paid her dues for lying about her degree, 
but the issue lingers. Neugebauer promises not to dwell on it, but predicts it 
will "stay with Harriett." 
</P>
<P>
Key strategy question: Money. Who can raise it fastest and spend it best? 
Advantage Wieder, but her congressional campaign left her tapped out with many 
sources. . . . She may find the going rough. 
</P>
<P>
Early outlook: Neugebauer will run a grass-roots effort to save money, but if 
Wieder can raise what it takes to launch an effective ad blitz, Neugebauer 
could be in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Voter Turnout 
</P>
<P>
November balloting 
</P>
<P>
1982: 65% 
</P>
<P>
1984: 78% 
</P>
<P>
1986: 60% 
</P>
<P>
1988: 77% 
</P>
<P>
1990: 
</P>
<P>
June balloting 
</P>
<P>
1982: 46% 
</P>
<P>
1984: 50% 
</P>
<P>
1986: 38% 
</P>
<P>
1988: 49% 
</P>
<P>
1990: 39% 
</P>
<P>
November's Ballot 
</P>
<P>
In addition to county races, voters will consider a slew of city candidates and 
could decide several controversial spending measures. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
Half-cent sales tax for transportation 
</P>
<P>
General obligation bond for court construction 
</P>
<P>
General obligation bond for open-space acquisition 
</P>
<P>
General obligation bond for jail construction 
</P>
<P>
Separately, those proposals are considered popular; together, they represent a 
billion-dollar wish list that would boost taxpayer bills significantly . . . If 
they all make it on the ballot, betting says voters would revolt and reject the 
lot. . . . Look for their proponents to elbow for position between now and 
August, when the supervisors finalize the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
District Attorney 
</P>
<P>
How They Fared in Tuesday's Primary 
</P>
<P>
Enright: 29% 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi: 41% 
</P>
<P>
The combatants: It's an in-office duel, as Michael R. Capizzi, appointed 
district attorney in January, takes on the office's chief deputy, James G. 
Enright. . . . The campaign tests office loyalties. . . . Capizzi counts most 
of the staff in his corner, but the primary contestants have rallied to 
Enright. 
</P>
<P>
The job: County's chief prosecutor with 184 lawyers, $34 million and nearly 700 
staffers at his disposal. Pays $110,781, with a raise due in July. 
</P>
<P>
Hot issues: Enright will portray Capizzi as the "politicians' " choice, since 
Capizzi was appointed by the supervisors. . . . Capizzi will lay lower, and 
will try to ignore Enright altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Early outlook: Armed with money, endorsements and incumbency, Capizzi will be 
difficult to beat. . . . Enright needs to get his name out, hard to do without 
big contributions. . . . Capizzi is the early favorite. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
72nd Assembly District 
</P>
<P>
Umberg defeated Jerry Yudelson 64% to 35% in the Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle was unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
The combatants: Backed by state heavyweights from both parties, it's rookie 
Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) versus Democrat and ex-federal 
prosecutor Tom Umberg, both vying for the $40,816-a-year job. . . . The 
battlefield's a great equalizer. . . . Predominantly Democratic, it votes 
Republican. . . . Prickly turf for any incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Hot issues: Pringle, a 22-year resident of Garden Grove, hopes to tag Umberg as 
a carpetbagger for recently moving into the district. . . . But the big issue 
is crime. As the one who sent bad guys to jail, Umberg argues he's the best 
crime fighter. 
</P>
<P>
Weaknesses: A messy primary split Democrats into feuding camps -- a problem for 
Umberg. . . . Pringle is collared with a controversial 1988 decision to put 
guards at polling places on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
Wild card: In this close race, Latinos could tip the scales. . . . Despite 
large numbers, turnout has been notoriously low. . . . Armed with a recent 
$150,000 court settlement, Latino groups plan a massive registration drive.

CELLULAR TELEPHONE BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GWEN MOORE, GWEN MOORE, (D-Los Angeles), chairs the Assembly Committee on 
Utilities and Commerce. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cellular telephone use is booming. Every month, more than 10,000 customers are 
activated in the Los Angeles area alone. This growth has produced enormous 
profits for cellular service wholesalers, but has not reduced Los Angeles-area 
service prices, which remain the highest in California. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the California Public Utilities Commission could have forced these 
rates down, but refused to do so. This is curious economics and even more 
curious public policy. 
</P>
<P>
Cellular service is a fixed-cost business. Most of the expense occurs during 
the initial construction of the network; ongoing operations and maintenance 
costs are relatively low. Once the break-even point is reached, every 
additional customer is extremely profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the growth in cellular customers has caused profits to soar. 
Estimates of profitability are imprecise, but the Cellular Resellers Assn., 
which represents retail service providers selling directly to the public, says 
the two Los Angeles-area service wholesalers, PacTel Cellular and L.A. 
Cellular, earned 82% and 119% on their investment in 1988. In comparison, 
Pacific Bell's 1988 return on investment was roughly 13%. 
</P>
<P>
In competitive markets, profits this high are virtually unachievable because 
new companies step in and cut prices -- and therefore profitability -- to win 
customers. However, the wholesale segment of cellular service is a duopoly. 
Because only two wholesalers of cellular service are permitted in any given 
region -- a decision made by the Federal Communications Commission -- new 
competitors cannot step in. 
</P>
<P>
The two existing wholesalers operate without the threat of new service 
providers entering the market and cutting prices and are thus completely 
insulated from real or potential price competition. In contrast, the retail 
market for cellular service is very competitive, with many providers -- such as 
Cellular Service Inc. and California Cellular Communications -- and no 
restrictions on new competitors. 
</P>
<P>
The following chart compares the 1989 wholesale service prices of the providers 
in three of California's largest markets. 
</P>
<P>
Notice the pattern. Further, these prices haven't changed since 1984, despite a 
dramatic increase in profits for cellular wholesalers. Clearly, there is no 
competition in any of these markets, a consequence of the duopolistic market 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
The appropriate response to monopoly power is some form of price regulation or 
control. This is how we check the monopoly power of other utilities, such as 
Southern California Edison and Pacific Bell. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC is empowered to regulate prices for cellular service and could force 
price reductions. However, until only recently, the commission has virtually 
ignored prices for cellular service, thus enabling the remarkable profits of 
the wholesalers. 
</P>
<P>
Their profitability has not gone unnoticed by investors. Noting the industry's 
growth potential, lack of regulation and favorable economics, an investment 
research report by Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. says: "Cellular communications as 
an economic enterprise has some of the most attractive characteristics of any 
business . . . (While cellular telephone service is not an unregulated 
monopoly, it) is a duopoly, which is almost as good." 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of a near monopoly with virtually no regulatory price controls has 
encouraged an investor feeding frenzy for cellular service providers, as most 
recently evidenced by McCaw Cellular Communications' record-setting bid for Lin 
Broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC has just concluded an investigation into cellular-service pricing. 
Disappointingly, the commission -- in a ruling issued Wednesday -- refused to 
reduce prices. The cellular service wholesalers' extraordinary profits will 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC argued that the profits are necessary to attract the capital needed to 
expand the cellular network. This rationale is not without some validity. It is 
true that the network needs capital to improve service quality and expand 
capacity. The high profit potential attracts investment capital that would 
otherwise be invested elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
However, what the PUC missed is that the level of profits need only be higher 
than that achieveable in competing investments, adjusted for risk. Excessive 
profits lead to speculation and misallocation of resources. The tremendous 
speculative run-up of cellular property values, as demonstrated in McCaw's 
purchase of Lin, is precisely the result of excessive monopoly profits. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of reducing prices to eliminate monopoly profits, as the PUC does with 
other public utilities, the commission in this instance chose to ignore their 
existence. Consumers are stuck. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC disingenuously claims to be supportive of consumers because the 
decision permits cellular telephone companies to volunteer to decrease prices. 
When was the last time you remember a company reducing prices voluntarily? 
</P>
<P>
Without any competitive or regulatory pressure, prices will not decrease. And 
prices should decrease. The Cellular Resellers Assn. estimates that wholesale 
cellular service prices could drop by roughly 40% in Los Angeles and 20% in San 
Francisco and still leave wholesalers with enviable profits. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC decision contains statements to reassure us that it is, in fact, 
working on behalf of the consumer. In a bold assertion, commissioners say they 
"are not inclined to permit carriers to keep profits due solely to a failure to 
compete in a duopolistic market." Yet the PUC has done exactly that by ignoring 
the spectacular profits of the wholesalers and refusing to order lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of competition gets to the root of the problem with this decision. 
While the PUC has espoused the virtues of competition, it has ignored the 
fundamental reality that the duopolistic wholesale market for cellular service 
can never be competitive. As long as the commission clings to this flawed 
notion of competition, cellular customers are likely to pay exorbitant prices 
for service. Sadly, the commission has missed an opportunity to balance 
business concerns with consumer interests.

I'm alive. Maggie the Cat is alive. -- From "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" 
</P>
<P>
It was that indolent hour after supper. Noel Coward was playing piano softly in 
a corner, Maria St. Just was hiking up her dress, and this desolate-looking 
young man was sitting all by himself, looking as if he were quarantined on the 
couch. St. Just considered his peculiar attire, which terminated at his toes in 
one red sock and a mate in the unlikely hue of blue. Clearly, even though 
theater heavyweights the likes of Laurence Olivier were mingling mere steps 
away, the solitary rumpled figure couldn't possibly have been anyone more 
humbling than an understudy. Someone, in fact, much like St. Just. 
</P>
<P>
She barreled right up to him and offered him a drink. 
</P>
<P>
"He was obviously very surprised at the interest and the gentleness with which 
I approached him, because I could see how terribly shy he was. When he spoke, 
he blushed," St. Just recalls 42 years later. "And then he looked at me with 
these wonderful eyes. And he said, 'Who brought you up?' And I said, 'My 
grandmother.' He said, 'My grandmother brought me up.' " 
</P>
<P>
What difference did it make that the untidy gent was already the prince of 
Broadway, having triumphed with his piercing "The Glass Menagerie"? Tennessee 
Williams had always depended upon the kindness of strangers, so he was thrilled 
when St. Just, a dark young Russian actress, befriended him during that 
otherwise intimidating party at John Gielgud's in London. Their click of 
recognition forged a fierce friendship that has only now emerged from the 
wings. And their intimacy lasted for nearly four decades, until death did them 
part, when the pill-dependent and still solitary Williams choked on a bottle 
cap in a New York hotel room in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
St. Just shudders at the thought, and her booming voice drops to a halting 
whisper: "So terrible. All alone." 
</P>
<P>
Not any more. Williams' most zealous ally -- and chattiest muse -- is back in 
sync with the man some call America's greatest playwright. For St. Just is 
doing her damnedest to resurrect his once-tattered reputation, as well as his 
art. She has compiled his chatty, funny, angry and poignant letters in a 
just-published volume, "Five O'Clock Angel: Letters of Tennessee Williams to 
Maria St. Just, 1948-1982." The critically hailed collection chronicles one of 
the very few relationships that was a constant in the playwright's restless 
life, as well as an artistic inspiration for him. St. Just's exuberance, her 
"wit and gallantry," in the playwright's words, gave birth to Williams' 
deathless character Maggie the Cat. 
</P>
<P>
St. Just's first reaction to the news was impassioned. "Good heavens," she 
whoops, "I was livid. 
</P>
<P>
"We were sitting in his flat and he flung this play at me, and he said, 'Oh, 
Maria, I've written a play about you.' I was very pleased. He said, 'Take it 
home and read it.' He regretted it. I came back the next morning fit to be 
tied. I said, 'This is absolutely ridiculous. I want to be a Tartar princess in 
a sleigh. With wolves.' I wanted to be like a character from Dostoyevsky, 
Tolstoy, you know. He said, 'Oh, Maria, it's your spirit, your tenacity, your 
life force.' " 
</P>
<P>
St. Just's stage counterpart hasn't been doing too badly herself. Maggie the 
Cat is alive in the Broadway revival of Williams' Pulitzer Prize-winning "Cat 
on a Hot Tin Roof," which has earned thunderous applause, a Tony nomination for 
the latest Cat -- Kathleen Turner -- and a Tony for Charles Durning as Big 
Daddy. St. Just had a hand in that as well; as co-executor of Williams' estate 
-- and one of the people who must give the nod to revivals -- she has picked 
her shots carefully, approving only those productions that would do the 
playwright proud, and working closely with directors to communicate Williams' 
intent. 
</P>
<P>
All this comes on the heels of last year's Broadway revival of Williams' 
"Orpheus Descending," which starred Vanessa Redgrave. And now St. Just is 
gearing up to turn his Key West home into a museum, as well as shepherd into 
publication his diaries (with his title, "Dead Planet the Moon, I Salute You"), 
not to mention six unpublished plays. 
</P>
<P>
Maria takes credit for Maggie's famous irritation with "no-neck monsters," 
immortalizing a child who once had the dubious taste to splash St. Just in a 
pool. But Maria and Maggie have much more in common than that -- they're 
fighters. And, as fate would have it, 35 years after the Broadway curtain first 
went up on Maggie the Cat's struggle to keep her homosexual husband, St. Just 
is battling for posterity's good opinion of the gay playwright, her closest 
friend. "You couldn't have another friend if you had him. You didn't want 
another one," St. Just says simply. 
</P>
<P>
"She's terrific, she really is," says Williams' other co-executor, John 
Eastman, the playwright's New York attorney since the early '70s and Paul 
McCartney's brother-in-law. "She cares a great deal. She's very energetic. It's 
a real passion with her." 
</P>
<P>
"What (Williams) admired most about Maria was her unswervable, desperate grip 
on what she valued in life," director Elia Kazan wrote in the book's preface. 
"It was what he admired in women, he would say, that they would fight with 
claws for what was essential for them as women and never be deflected." 
</P>
<P>
Maria the Cat is indeed alive. The recent Broadway successes are helping to 
salve the critical record on Williams, which flagged later in his life. What's 
more, St. Just is counting on the letters, which show the playwright's loyal, 
compassionate side, to correct the impression left by his trashy memoirs and 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
If they presented the aging Williams as a mercurial boozer, St. Just blames it 
all on, well, him. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave the most awful interviews," she says in her gunshot cadence. "He 
simply presented himself in the most impossible way most of the time. He was 
hurt and he was tired and he was fed up. I was always trying to shut him up. It 
was impossible. If I ever wrote my memoirs, they would be called, 'Do Shut Up, 
Tennessee.' " 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing but affection for Williams in that remark. The 60-ish St. Just 
-- she won't give her exact age -- is bustling about her ample hotel suite, 
petite but powerful, her hair a swoop of ash blonde, white silks trailing. She 
has checked into the lush Beverly Hills Hotel because it was a favorite haunt 
of hers and Tennessee's. The playwright is absent but somehow everywhere 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
He is present in the snippets of plays that pepper St. Just's throaty speech. 
He even circles her fingers and wrists, in a brilliant ring of rubies and 
diamonds, a chunky gold bracelet and a unicorn brooch studded with tiny 
diamonds and rubies, all gifts from the playwright's flush days. 
</P>
<P>
"We were luckily walking by Tiffany, and I was repeating one of my nanny rhymes 
-- 'Unicorns do not exist, they only think they do. Unicorns do not exist, 
they've better things to do.' Isn't it lovely? And then Tennessee yelled and we 
flew into Tiffany, and he bought me that. I love the little diamond hoof. It's 
so Tennessee. He gave such lovely presents." 
</P>
<P>
Williams also gazes from a 1953 photograph propped on a hotel coffee table, 
poised at the wheel of his Sunliner sedan. Next to him sit his beloved 
grandfather, the Rev. Walter Dakin, who sports a white cap, and Mr. Moon, one 
of many English bulldogs that passed through the playwright's life and homes. 
The photo is a prickly memory, as her commentary, laced through the letters, 
tells: "When Tennessee was in London, Maria's mother looked at the snapshot . . 
. and then in a dreamy voice said: 'Tennessee, I never knew that dogs wore 
white peaked caps in America.' . . . He never totally forgave her." 
</P>
<P>
When Maria did finally meet Williams' ailing grandfather, at a nursing home in 
St. Louis, the incident was equally ill fated. "He'd already had a slight 
stroke. We took in ginger wine, which he drank with a straw. We smuggled it 
past the nurse. He was in his bed, deaf as a post, 97. And Tennessee was very 
excited because he was proud of me. And he said, 'Grandfather, here is Maria.' 
</P>
<P>
"Grandfather said, 'She's just come from Korea?' 
</P>
<P>
"And then (Williams) got into a rage with his grandfather and said, 'I've just 
written this play about her,' and Grandfather said, 'What play?' And he said, 
'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,' and Grandfather said, 'Cats don't come at half past 
eight, tap, tap, tapping at the garden gate,' which was so lovely. He just said 
this little rhyme, which sent Tennessee into hysterics because he decided that 
half past eight was the exact time that the curtain went up, and if the cats 
don't come knocking, that means there won't be an audience. Paranoia, of 
course, bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
"He snatched that ginger wine from his grandfather. It was no nonsense. He 
stamped out of the nursing home and said, 'Such bad luck. I wish I hadn't told 
Grandfather.' He was terribly superstitious." 
</P>
<P>
The tempestuous Southerner and the Russian aristocrat may have seemed unlikely 
soul mates to the uninitiated. St. Just was the daughter of a prominent White 
Russian surgeon appointed to attend the Dowager Empress. Born Maria Britneva in 
Leningrad, she was brought up in London as the revolution consumed her 
homeland. Britneva, who eventually married her childhood friend, the banking 
scion Lord Peter St. Just, studied ballet as a child and performed at Covent 
Garden with the Ballets Russe de Monte Carlo. When a foot injury derailed her 
ballet career, she turned to acting, studying at the Old Vic School in London 
and later joining John Gielgud's theater company. 
</P>
<P>
But what St. Just shared with Williams -- beyond a love for the theater -- was 
an appreciation for nonsense. And when his play openings around the globe 
threatened to make Williams crazy, he would summon Maria from London, because 
she was the one person whose sense of humor could prove more compelling than 
his nerves. 
</P>
<P>
"As he says somewhere, 'I've always pressed the panic button for Maria.' We had 
such fun together. We doubled up with laughter most of the time. We had our 
little private jokes. Whatever it was, when things went wrong, we always said 
it was Liebling's fault," St. Just says, referring to the theatrical agent, 
William Liebling, who was married to Williams' agent of 30 years, Audrey Wood. 
"It had nothing whatever to do with poor Liebling. But we had to have some sort 
of scapegoat. It was really very funny." 
</P>
<P>
Liebling came in handy at the 1955 Broadway opening of "Cat" as well. In the 
book, St. Just recalled the tremors that surrounded the evening: "In his usual 
state of nerves, Tennessee kept muttering loudly to no one in particular during 
the performance: 'You see, people are talking all the way through my play,' and 
'It's absolutely disgraceful,' and 'They're talking, you see,' and 'They're 
spoiling my play.' All around us the audience was saying 'Shh! Shh!' Eventually 
I had to snap at Tennessee savagely: 'You're the one who's talking -- you're 
spoiling your own play!' 
</P>
<P>
"At the interval I felt obliged to remove him from the theater and stop him 
from having a fight with himself. We went across the road to a sort of 
semi-strip bar, where we gloomily sat, Tennessee convinced the whole evening 
was a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"We returned and stood at the back of the theater during the last scene. It 
finished with an enormous ovation for Tennessee and the cast. Tennessee was 
still unconvinced. He succeeded in having a blinding row in the middle of the 
first-night party with Audrey Wood, who had done no harm to anyone. He told her 
she had ruined the play, and that it was all Liebling's fault, anyway!" 
</P>
<P>
St. Just did more than hold Williams' hand in cab rides to the theater. She was 
the one person, Kazan wrote, Williams would seek out when he wanted "a loyal, 
because absolutely true, reaction" to his plays -- their poetry and 
productions. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always a bit of ambiguity in everything," she says. "Tennessee always 
left questions unanswered and that's interesting. There were 16 productions of 
Tennessee in Russia. I was at home and he was staying with us and a letter 
arrived from Russia. I was absolutely outraged because they'd done 'Streetcar' 
and they changed the end. This was in Moscow. (Blanche du Bois) never went into 
a mental home at all and she married Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
"And I translated this to Tennessee. I said, 'Isn't this outrageous, Tennessee? 
You've got to stamp your foot and do something!' Tennessee laughed, and he 
said, 'Of course, they're absolutely right. She'd have conned her way out of 
that nursing home in a fortnight. She'd have married Mitch, yes.' " 
</P>
<P>
Williams called St. Just his "Five O'Clock Angel" because of her last words to 
her dying grandmother: "When will I see you, my angel?" her grandmother asked. 
"At five o'clock" came the reply. Tennessee signed his letters "10." 
</P>
<P>
Not all the sobriquets the two bandied about were quite so adorable. The pair, 
who reveled in St. Just's Russian passion for pet names, nicknamed Williams' 
friend Carson McCullers "Choppers" because St. Just decided her cheeks looked 
like lamb chops. 
</P>
<P>
Even Williams' longtime companion, Frank Merlo, wasn't spared -- they called 
him "the Horse" because of his large teeth. Merlo's equine appearance was not 
lost on the irascible Tallulah Bankhead, who met him during a Miami run of "A 
Streetcar Named Desire." "Bankhead was horrid to the Horse," Williams wrote St. 
Just in 1956. "When he arrived, I said:Isn't he good-looking? And she said, 'He 
looks like a horse. It's very nice of you to love such a hideous person.' " 
</P>
<P>
Williams loved impromptu jaunts, to Broadway, Rome, Tangier, anywhere he could 
dissipate his unyielding restlessness. So, in their younger days, the three of 
them would often pick up and cross continents. 
</P>
<P>
"I was ready to go anywhere, Russia, Barcelona, Hong Kong," St. Just says. "I 
absolutely adored it. I didn't mind at all because I was rather wild in that 
way. This is what Tennessee should have called his memoirs and didn't, 'Flee 
Flee This Sad Hotel.' He wanted to call them that and I think Doubleday stopped 
him." 
</P>
<P>
After St. Just married Peter Grenfell, the Lord St. Just, in 1956, she settled 
at Wilbury, the family's spectacular 1,000-acre estate in Wiltshire, England. 
She pretty much retired from acting (she once played Blanche, but never, oddly, 
Maggie, because "I was too young and I was English. I would have mucked it 
up"). Instead, St. Just tended to her family, which came to include daughters 
Pulcheria and Natasha, now in their early 30s. Her familial role also meant she 
was less free to follow Williams' peripatetic whims. And, of course, there were 
always the letters. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about Tennessee I did learn very quickly was that if I really wanted 
him to listen to what I had to say about anything, I would always write to 
him," St. Just says. "He was a writer and the written word penetrated far 
quicker and deeper than the spoken word. "He was not very articulate in real 
life. He was much more articulate with his pen. There would be long silences, 
which I never minded. I'm a chatterbox and I would chatter away. Tennessee 
would listen or not listen. Basically, the written word had more meaning for 
him than the spoken word." 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, Merlo died of lung cancer (on the back of a photograph of Merlo, 
Williams wrote: "When your candle burns low, you've got to believe that the 
last light shows you something besides the progress of darkness"). And Williams 
fell victim to a procession of mercenary young men, whom he referred to as his 
"traveling companions." 
</P>
<P>
"He was so afraid of being alone. He was so lonely. I used to snarl at him, 
'What are you whining about? What's wrong with being alone?' Because I loved 
being alone. He'd say, 'It's all very well for you, Maria. You can choose. I 
can't.' Of course, I never thought of that." 
</P>
<P>
Still, St. Just couldn't help registering her disapproval of Williams' less 
charming companions, such as the young man who billed the playwright 500 pounds 
for having to endure dinner with St. Just. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you how it cheered us up, too," she says. "We'd just come back 
from a flop. And you think someone is being really spiteful, 'I'm going to hurt 
Tennessee,' and we cried with laughter. We were sitting at dinner, one of these 
rather chi chi places with candles, which were blowing in and out every five 
seconds, and Tennessee kept saying, 'I don't believe this.' I don't know about 
the 500. I expect Tennessee gave it to him." 
</P>
<P>
And so Williams would always say it was the women in his life who were most 
important -- even though people thought just the opposite was true, St. Just 
says. "He was fascinated by women, adored women. The first was (his sister) 
Rose and his grandmother. And then Hazel, who was the girl he was in love with, 
who comes through all the early journals. She was his first real love when he 
was in college. He quotes her at the end of his journal saying, 'Tom, do you 
ever think I would ever say anything that would hurt you?' And then Marion 
Vaccaro (the widow of the heir to the United Fruit fortune, nicknamed 'Banana 
Queen'), who died. 
</P>
<P>
"And then, of course, 'There's Maria,' he says. 'Ever since 1948 there's been 
Maria, who's fiercely and actively alive.' Lovely." 
</P>
<P>
In "Five O'Clock Angel," Williams writes in a letter: "What a flat-sounding 
word (friendship) is for what becomes, later on in life, the most important 
element of it! To me the French word for this deep relationship, probably all 
the deeper because it exists outside and beyond the physical kind of devotion, 
is much more appealing. It covers a broader spectrum and surely its depth is 
greater. The word is l'amitie . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "L'amitie never involves a material transaction. You don't see it in a shop 
window with a price tag attached to it or close beside it, and it requires no 
exertion of will to animate it with the breath of spirit. It is a consecrated 
thing and it is devoutly to be wished for, because, if it is real as opposed to 
artificial or trivial, it can endure until death, and Miss Elizabeth Barrett 
Browning was convinced that it lasted after. I think she was right to the 
extent that it lasts afterwards in the heart of the survivor . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I have been told and have no reason to doubt that l'amitie can exist between 
two men as well as between a man and a woman, but in my case it has occurred 
usually always with someone of the opposite gender. 
</P>
<P>
"I have had many close friendships with men which were without any sexual 
connotations, God knows. But I have found them less deeply satisfying than 
those I have had with a few women. 
</P>
<P>
"Of these women, the most important has been with Maria, as both Maria Britneva 
or as the Lady St. Just." 
</P>
<P>
He returned the favor by advising her on everything from love to money to 
poetry. And when her beloved cousin lay on her deathbed, Williams flew to her 
side and waited outside the sickroom for St. Just to emerge -- hours later. "I 
said, 'Tennessee, I thought you'd gone back to the hotel.' And he said, 'As 
long as I'm here, you're never coming out of that room alone.' Now where do you 
get that? You just don't, do you?' " 
</P>
<P>
But for the longest time, St. Just kept their private relationship private. 
"Tennessee was like part of my family," she says. "And you don't boast or talk 
about something that's so precious and so personal." 
</P>
<P>
Then, as his letters turned up over the decades, both in her antique Russian 
trunk and folded within books at Wilbury, she considered how useful they could 
be in rewriting his public history. If Williams' later unfettered years had 
produced a bizarre portrait of a tormented, boorish, failed artist, she had the 
wherewithal to tell the rest of the story, of a ferociously disciplined, often 
hurting man, devoted to his friends, generous with his family. And that was the 
tenderness he offered to his characters -- the misbegotten, the aging 
spinsters, the dying behemoths, the lonely and the lost. But first, she 
consulted her Russian Orthodox priest, who convinced her that publishing the 
letters would not violate his confidences. 
</P>
<P>
"This must come out," she says firmly. "This is what I remember so much, not so 
much the dark days, but the light, wonderful, fragile days of laughter and 
poetry and reading things together and sharing. I really was very blessed," and 
here her voice trails off, as she seems to consider how past tense it all is, 
"to have that in my life. With such a person, such a wonderful, magnificent 
human being. There wasn't anything he didn't understand and didn't have 
compassion for. There's a wonderful line, he says, in 'The Night of the 
Iguana.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Nothing human disgusts me.' Wonderful. And it's true."

<P>
Don't tell Kazuhiko Nishi that Japanese people aren't creative. 
</P>
<P>
After all, he's the charismatic Wunderkind -- the "Steve Jobs of Japan" -- who 
dropped out of a prestigious university to become the nation's chief evangelist 
of the personal computer revolution. 
</P>
<P>
At age 21, in 1977, he started a computer magazine publishing firm. Renamed 
ASCII Corp., it is now Japan's largest software publishing firm. 
</P>
<P>
At 22, he talked Microsoft Corp. into making him its sole agent in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
At 23, he persuaded NEC Corp. to let him help develop Japan's first personal 
computer. That year, he also marketed the nation's first packaged software. 
</P>
<P>
At 26, with the assistance of Microsoft, he designed the world's first 
mass-produced portable computer -- the Radio Shack TRS 80 Model 100. 
</P>
<P>
At 27, he developed the MSX computer standard, persuading Sony, Matsushita and 
other Japanese electronic giants to adopt it. Four million machines using the 
MSX standard have been sold, although it has not swept the market as initially 
envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
At 33, Nishi made history again by becoming the youngest corporate president to 
take a Japanese company public. He raised $40 million in Tokyo's 
over-the-counter market. 
</P>
<P>
ASCII's per-share prices have almost quadrupled to $100 from $26. Annual sales 
have doubled since 1986 to $200 million for the fiscal year ending March, 1990. 
Profits have grown 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Now at the ripe old age of 34, Nishi is a regarded as a brilliant technologist 
and silver-tongued salesman. He is at work on satellites, semiconductors, 
Hollywood films, an aviation school and all manner of new products, including a 
pocket-sized computer with a split keyboard that folds in three. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, he has confounded expectations and proven that creative thought 
and deed are hardly the province of the West. Even the way he talks about 
creativity is, well, creative: 
</P>
<P>
"There are two types of creativity: the creativity of making zero to one and 
the creativity of making one to 1,000," he said over a white custard dessert at 
ASCII's headquarters in Tokyo. "Making zero to one is called originality. 
Making one to 1,000 is called the art of manufacturing. Japan is thinking about 
the art of manufacturing, plus at the same time it is thinking about making 
originality. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a matter of time" before Japan breaks out of its creative binds, 
Nishi added. "Everybody has the consensus of the need to move in that 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
With such flourish, the baby-faced Nishi has managed to command confidence from 
executives twice his age in a nation that stresses seniority. He has managed to 
mesh a dashing lifestyle of chartered jets, a $20-million art collection and a 
country home with Japan's conservative climate. Nishi says his secret is 
simple. 
</P>
<P>
"What you need to do is maintain compatibility with existing society. In your 
own company you can be as creative as you want. But when you have to talk to 
the bank, you have to behave like an ordinary Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
To behave like an "ordinary Japanese" means, for starters, that Nishi drives 
around town in a black company car -- not the Bentley that he ordered 
custom-designed to the same specifications developed for Prince Charles. Still, 
he has occasionally provoked grumbles by coming on too strong, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, Nishi can appear soft-spoken, speaking barely above a whisper at 
times. He can seem disheveled, with a rumpled suit and long hair. But 
associates say that when he springs into action before investors or clients, he 
is spellbinding. 
</P>
<P>
Microsoft executive Ron Hosogi recalled one particularly tough sell with a 
Japanese electronics firm, which was balking at starting a project with 
Microsoft amid the personal computer slump in 1984. Within 30 minutes, Nishi 
"turned a roomful of skeptics into believers," Hosogi said. 
</P>
<P>
"He can paint pictures and have people say yes. In a Japanese environment, 
where you usually meet with 15 different levels over a period of weeks, doing 
it in 30 minutes is shocking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And Nishi generally delivers on his visions, associates say. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a genius," said Fumio Otsuka, general manager of information processing 
and electronic systems for Mitsui &amp; Co. "His vision is always correct. So 
everybody trusts Nishi." 
</P>
<P>
Otsuka said every joint project between ASCII and Mitsui has made money. The 
firms have collaborated repeatedly on such projects as the laptop computer, 
semiconductors, graphics systems and facsimile machines. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of track record has quieted questions about his youth. 
</P>
<P>
"Those old-age executives are charmed by Nishi, and they're getting something 
new from him," Otsuka said. "In this kind of new industry, where it's difficult 
to catch up with technological changes, age doesn't make any difference. He 
understands the direction of revolutionary trends." 
</P>
<P>
Married, with two daughters, Nishi credits an unusually enriched childhood for 
his success. His family founded a girls' secondary school in Kobe, raising 
Nishi in an environment of libraries, music, art and newfangled machines called 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
After his father went to bed, the 9-year-old would sneak into the study, wrench 
off the computer cover with a screwdriver and pound away on early, rudimentary 
Wang and, later, Hewlett-Packard models. 
</P>
<P>
Why? He pauses in thought. 
</P>
<P>
"Because they were there," he concludes. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he entered Waseda University in Tokyo, he was a computer fanatic. 
His room was always littered with vacuum tubes and electrical wires. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, as the personal computer age was dawning, Nishi took a fateful step 
toward what would become ASCII's most celebrated linkup. He made a cold call to 
William Gates, chairman of Microsoft, and ended up as the firm's exclusive 
software distributor in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Although the association helped Microsoft gain its present 65% market share for 
operating systems in Japan, the two men had a falling out in 1985 over future 
directions. Nishi wanted to branch into semiconductors, but Gates' interest was 
strictly software. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy's life is a mess," Gates said then, without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
"If I stay in Microsoft, I have to work for Bill Gates," Nishi said. "Here, I 
can work for myself." 
</P>
<P>
Nishi's vindication came last September. When he took ASCII public, it was 
viewed as a decisive rebound from loss of its most important business partner. 
</P>
<P>
ASCII opened a U.S. operation in San Jose in April to invest in leading-edge 
technologies, including systems and applications software. Another new venture 
is a satellite communications business. In April, the company set up a joint 
venture with Mitsui &amp; Co. and C. Itoh &amp; Co. to offer a rapid data 
transmission service for stock quotations, supermarket prices, teletexts, still 
pictures and the like. 
</P>
<P>
Along with new investments in Hollywood, which Nishi would not detail, he is 
continually stretching his vision of ASCII -- and himself -- as mass 
communicators. 
</P>
<P>
He owns 2,000 compact discs and reads "two or three feet of books" a week from 
his 10,000-volume personal library. He writes commentaries for newspapers. He 
gives speeches. He lectures at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. He is 
constantly interviewed, and in the interviews he is philosophical, colorful and 
unabashedly direct. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody perceives me as an ordinary businessman," Nishi said. "I think I am 
quite extraordinary."

SPARKLING IN A STYLE OF TIFFANY; 
</P>
<P>
NG AIMS TO SURPASS CHIN'S ACHIEVEMENTS IN FIGURE SKATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pardon Joanna Ng if she doesn't throw a triple salchow when she is compared to 
Tiffany Chin. Ng, a figure-skating phenom, is flattered by the comparison, but 
she prefers to be recognized for her own achievements. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Tiffany was a really good skater," said Ng, 11, of Woodland Hills. 
"But I think that I can be better than her if I keep working. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I say to myself, 'Well, Tiffany did this move, but did this wrong 
and did this wrong.' I say I'm going to do this better and this better than 
her." 
</P>
<P>
Ng (pronounced Ing) is off to a strong start. 
</P>
<P>
Ng won the silver medal in the Novice Division of the U.S. Figure Skating 
Championships at Salt Lake City in March, missing first place by only one-tenth 
of a point. She was the youngest skater ever to win a medal at the nationals 
and she accomplished the feat against Novice opponents who ranged in age from 
12 to 16. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't really disappointed (about failing to win)," Ng said. "I was the 
youngest (skater) and I'll be older and more ready next year." In 1991, Ng will 
compete in the Junior class against opponents at least four years older. 
</P>
<P>
Ng has a specific goal, one that Chin never achieved. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to win the gold medal in the Olympics," Ng said. "I want to have a 
title, and I think that the Olympics will bring me higher." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Toluca Lake's Chin was regarded as the premier skater in the nation, 
winning the U.S. Seniors national skating championship. Chin, a fourth-place 
finisher in the Sarajevo Winter Olympics in 1984, was called the favorite to 
win a gold medal in the Calgary Winter Olympics four years later. But a muscle 
imbalance in her legs in 1985 forced Chin off skates and subsequently ended her 
competitive career. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly many people in this sport feel that Tiffany never achieved her 
potential," said Frank Carroll, who coached Chin and now coaches Ng at the Ice 
Castles International Training Center in Lake Arrowhead. "It is very important 
to watch the physical development. It is an extremely physically demanding 
sport." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said that it is not surprising that Ng and Chin are compared so often. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many parallels," he said. "Both are Chinese, both are very advanced, 
and both are wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Ng prides herself on her ability to play well to an audience. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my favorite part about skating," she said. "When I skate in front of an 
audience and the audience gets behind me, it brings me up and I skate better.' 
</P>
<P>
The ebullient sixth-grade student at A.E. Wright Middle School in Calabasas 
understands that skating is a full-time activity. It doesn't leave much time to 
socialize. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my friends are skating friends because I am at the rinks so much," Ng 
said. "But I don't mind." 
</P>
<P>
Each morning at 5 a.m., Ng skates at Pickwick Ice Arena in Burbank or at Conejo 
Valley Ice Arena under Coach Doug Varve. Her blades are strapped on again after 
school. She travels to Lake Arrowhead to practice with Carroll as often as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
It is a grueling schedule, incorporating freestyle skating, compulsory figures 
practice and dance. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't mind when I have to go to bed early, because I love to skate so 
much," said Ng, who turns 12 in August. "It doesn't bother me when I have to 
miss a birthday party or can't go to a movie with my friends because I 
understand that I have to compromise." 
</P>
<P>
Ng does little compromising on the ice, performing extremely technical 
routines. She has been doing triple jumps (three full rotations in the air) 
since she was 9, and performs a Biehlman spin, a dangerous move in which she 
spins on one leg while holding the other leg above her head. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to do a lot of different moves," Ng said. "I like to jump the best, but 
I like the variety in my routines." 
</P>
<P>
Ng believes that Carroll "brings the sparkle out" in her programs. His style of 
teaching is sophisticated. He teaches difficult jumps and complicated programs 
and expects his students to learn quickly and to perform accurately. 
</P>
<P>
"He has helped me so much," Ng said. "He's a great coach, and I don't think 
that I could find anyone better.' 
</P>
<P>
Ng maintains a straight-A average and also plays the piano. "I like to do a lot 
of different things," Ng said. "Of course I love skating the most, but I also 
like dancing, piano, painting shirts and skiing. I like everything, actually. 
I'm just a happy kid." 
</P>
<P>
Ng stands 4-foot-10 and weighs a mere 70 pounds, but she is a powerful 
performer on the ice. "There are some things you cannot teach, like the 
relationship between the audience and the skater," Carroll said. "She is so 
bubbly, so up all the time that they just adore her. 
</P>
<P>
"You can never make predictions about skating. Look what happened to Tiffany 
Chin. But as far as having the equipment necessary to be a world champion, she 
has it."

HE'S EMERGING AS THE ACE OF HIS PLACE; 
</P>
<P>
IN HIS FOURTH SEASON, ANGEL LEFT-HANDER CHUCK FINLEY HAS THE NUMBER OF AMERICAN 
LEAGUE BATTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Throughout his career, Dave Winfield wore uniform number 31. Always. 
</P>
<P>
Through Little League, the University of Minnesota, National League, nine years 
in the American League. So, when the New York Yankees traded him to the Angels 
a few weeks ago, he naturally asked for 31. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield, baseball's active leader in runs batted in and a 12-time all-star, 
wanted it. Pitcher Chuck Finley, who has 11 fewer all-star selections to his 
credit, had it. 
</P>
<P>
Finley still has it. 
</P>
<P>
That's not because he is a slave to superstition and not because Winfield 
didn't try good-naturedly to coax him into giving it up. Finley kept his number 
because Winfield came to realize, as have Angel opponents, that the 27-year-old 
left-hander deserves that kind of respect for his accomplishments and for the 
boundless potential he continues to fulfill in his fourth full major league 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I had done things to earn the number," Finley said, not boastfully 
but with the quiet self-confidence of a sparkling 16-9 season behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"I wore 31 all during college and the minor leagues. It would be different if 
this was my first year or I didn't have success. He and I did talk about it and 
he understood. He was very professional. If he wanted it bad enough, he could 
have said, 'I want this,' but he didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Firmly as he stood on that point of pride, the 6-6, 212-pound Louisiana native 
insisted that the numbers that matter more than those on his back are those he 
accumulates by the end of the season. In 1989, those numbers were eye opening. 
</P>
<P>
To complement his career-best 16 victories -- a total only three Angel 
left-handers had reached before him -- Finley compiled a 2.57 earned-run 
average, second only to Cy Young Award winner Bret Saberhagen of Kansas City. 
His nine complete games ranked third-best in the American League and he struck 
out 156 batters, the eighth-best total. 
</P>
<P>
Boosted by the addition of a forkball to his curveball and a lively fastball 
that can reach 92 m.p.h, Finley stymied left-handed hitters. He held them to a 
.172 batting average and no home runs in 199 2/3 innings, while limiting 
righties to a .243 average. 
</P>
<P>
"The advent of his forkball pushed him over the hump," pitching coach Marcel 
Lachemann said. "It gave him a third quality pitch people had to be aware of." 
</P>
<P>
Being aware of it didn't make it easier to hit. Finley's hits-per-innings ratio 
of 0.86 placed him behind such luminaries as Nolan Ryan, Saberhagen, Toronto 
veteran Dave Stieb, Oakland's Mike Moore and Boston's Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
Angel catcher Lance Parrish boldly grouped him with another left-hander of some 
repute. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to draw comparisons, but he resembles Steve Carlton in stature and 
effectiveness," said Parrish, who became Finley's batterymate last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Both have, or had, a different repertoire. Carlton relied on his slider and 
his fastball. Chuck doesn't throw a slider, but he's got that real effective 
forkball instead. It's a deceptive pitch because it looks, coming out of his 
hand, like a fastball. He throws it with good arm motion and it looks like he's 
throwing a fastball and then the bottom falls out. If he takes a little off, it 
works as a changeup." 
</P>
<P>
It changed the course of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"Without it, I would have been in the minors two or three more years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he had a brilliant year in 1989, highlighted by his one-hitter against 
the Boston Red Sox May 26 in Fenway Park. But even then, he didn't immediately 
get the recognition he merited. 
</P>
<P>
Said shortstop Jody Reed, whose two-out single in the eighth ended the no-hit 
bid, "You've really got to take your hat off to that Steve Finley." 
</P>
<P>
So what if Reed didn't know his name, or that some people might not know that 
the Angels' most successful left-hander this season isn't Mark Langston, whose 
services cost them $16-million in last winter's free-agent feeding frenzy. The 
Angels' big winner so far is Finley, whose 8-3 record and 2.71 ERA reaffirm his 
place among the game's top pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if people know who I am, but I don't really care," he said. "I 
know who I am, my teammates know and the guys who bat against me know I'm a 
pretty capable, pretty complete pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go out and do the job enough times, people will realize what you can do 
without you saying it. If somebody notices and says, 'Nice game,' it's 
gratifying to know you're appreciated. But I don't really need to hear it." 
</P>
<P>
There's no way to know whether the outcome of last summer's title race would 
have been different if Finley hadn't injured his left foot Aug. 21 while 
warming up for a start against the Royals, but it's tempting to speculate. The 
day of his misstep, the Angels were tied for the West Division lead. While he 
lost four turns, including the game in Kansas City he left after 17 pitches, 
they lost 13 of their next 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
"When I did that, I thought it wasn't a big deal because I was still able to 
walk," he said. "Then I tried to pitch, and I just couldn't. I try not to think 
about what could have happened. We could have done the same thing (faded out of 
the race) with me there. It would be easy to say, 'I wasn't there and the team 
was in a skid.' " 
</P>
<P>
A hint of wistfulness crept into his voice. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on a roll and we all were throwing well," he said. "We had a real strong 
chain as a pitching staff, and me going down takes one link out of that chain. 
The guys did the best they could. They picked it up toward the end but there 
weren't enough days left." 
</P>
<P>
That Finley would play so pivotal a part in a title race seemed unlikely as 
recently as 1988, when he was 9-15 in his first year as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I threw the ball pretty well but the team was kind of going in 
different directions," he said. "We'd have a good week and then a bad week. It 
was a learning process. It was more like a steppingstone for what was to come." 
</P>
<P>
Not that it appeared he would come to much at all early in his career. 
</P>
<P>
Selected by the Angels in the first round of the secondary phase of the 
January, 1985, free-agent draft, Finley didn't make the most favorable of 
impressions at a camp for drafted players held at Cal State Fullerton. He was 
all elbows, legs and kick the first time Joe Coleman watched him, a fury of 
motion and raw power begging for refinement. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw somebody that was 6-foot-6, who was pitching like he was 5-foot-10," 
said Coleman, then a minor league pitching instructor for the Angels and now 
their bullpen coach. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw the first couple of fastballs he threw after he loosened up, I 
said, 'Geez, it doesn't look like there's much there.' A few fastballs after 
that, I almost swallowed my tobacco. I knew he was special." 
</P>
<P>
He required special attention from the Angels before his vast talent could be 
mined. His minor league apprenticeship was brief, 29 innings with Class A Salem 
in 1985 and 12 with Class A Quad Cities in 1986, all in relief. 
</P>
<P>
But he used his time well, as Coleman and Lachemann taught him to modify his 
delivery so he would be at a more upright angle that took advantage of his 
imposing height. He also changed his motion so that he no longer threw across 
his body, gaining a better angle on the strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
But he got his real education on the job, in a major league uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a short (relief) man for us because at that time we had very few 
left-handers in the organization and no left-handed closers," Coleman said. "We 
thought we'd start him out as a closer because we weren't really sure if he'd 
develop a good enough breaking ball to get him into a starting situation. 
</P>
<P>
"The next year (1986) he started at Quad Cities, and about a quarter of the way 
into the season, Marcel gave me a call asking for left-handers. I told him, 
'Right now, the only left-hander throwing good enough is Finley.' He chuckled 
and said, 'Let me talk to (Manager) Gene Mauch and I'll get back to you,' and 
they said they wanted him." 
</P>
<P>
Told that he'd be moving up, Finley thought that meant double A. It meant the 
Show, the big leagues, in the biggest city he had ever seen, New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to go to New York, and there I was, coming from Waterloo 
(Iowa) and the first place I go is New York and the first stadium I go to is 
Yankee Stadium," said Finley, whose hometown of Monroe, La., has a population 
of 130,000. 
</P>
<P>
"There were more people in one place than I'd seen in my life. It happened to 
be hat day or beach-towel day or something like that and I couldn't believe all 
those people. Then you see all those (plaques) on the wall and everything. It 
was really something. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little more comfortable in places like that now, but I still don't get 
too cocky in the city. I stay close to the hotel, but I might venture out every 
now and then." 
</P>
<P>
Finley didn't make his major league debut until four days later, May 29. It 
coincided with the debut of the late, late show back home, where his parents, 
Charles and Sue, thrilled from afar via their satellite dish. 
</P>
<P>
"They got it the first year I went to big league camp, because they had trouble 
getting Cablevision out to the house," said Finley, who is close to his family. 
"They thought it would be neat to watch Angels games whether I was there or 
not. 
</P>
<P>
"Two months later, I told them 'Watch, you might see me.' The day they saw me 
on TV in an Angel uniform at Yankee Stadium, my dad said it was worth 
everything it cost." 
</P>
<P>
Watching their son pitch late innings in late-starting West Coast games cost 
his parents a good deal of sleep. They were as delighted as he was when he 
became a starter late in 1987, a season he ended with a 2-7 record and 4.67 ERA 
after three starts and 32 relief appearances, mostly as a mop-up man. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked them to make the switch so it would be easier on my mom and dad," 
Finley joked. 
</P>
<P>
Being a starter in 1988 was no laugh. Fifteen of the games he started were 
decided by two runs or fewer and in nine of his 15 losses, the Angels scored 
two runs or fewer. 
</P>
<P>
"That was experience under fire," Coleman said. "He was 9-15 but he pitched 
much better than that, and that was without the forkball. It was his rookie 
year, so to speak, as a starter. We knew if we could come up with a third 
pitch, he'd be able to turn things around." 
</P>
<P>
It took a considerable effort. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought it would be easy, that the wins would keep clicking and 
clicking," Finley said. "I saw when I was in the pen that you could pitch well 
and not win. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it was a matter of being put in situations I'd never been into. You 
can feel you're capable and people can tell you and tell you, 'You can do this 
and do that,' but until you do it, well, the only way you're going to get 
better or worse is by doing it. 
</P>
<P>
"Things clicked midway through the '88 season. I can't put my finger on what it 
was. But I remember a couple of games where I felt completely in control. I'd 
get into situations and say, 'I know how to get out of this,' instead of 
falling to pieces. Plus I added the changeup (last season), which gave me a 
little bit different look and another pitch I could get over for strikes." 
</P>
<P>
He struck out nearly twice as many batters as he walked last season -- 82 
walks, 156 strikeouts -- a ratio he has improved this season. In 73 innings, he 
has walked 22 and struck out 47, better than 2-1, and more impressive because 
he has not consistently had the "stuff" he had last season, whether 
lockout-related or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
For Finley to win by pitching and not by blowing hitters away is another 
significant milepost. 
</P>
<P>
"That's an indication how well he's learned how to pitch," Lachemann said. 
</P>
<P>
"Talk to any successful starting pitcher and he'll say he has his good stuff 
maybe one-quarter of the time. The ones that end up being really good are 
capable of winning when they don't have their good stuff. If you can win half 
of those games, or over half, and win a great majority of the ones where you do 
have your good stuff, you'll be a good one. If you can't win when you don't 
have good stuff, you're going to be mediocre. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now he's one of the premier left-handers in the league and that's pretty 
good." 
</P>
<P>
Good though he is on the mound, he seems to have problems completing simple 
functions such as walking. A slip on a rain-slicked step in Toronto left him 
with a sprained right ankle and cost him a start May 18. 
</P>
<P>
In his next start, May 22, he tried to kick a chair in the dugout after he was 
removed from the game, and missed. After being routed by the Rangers June 2 at 
Texas before more than 30 friends and relatives, he stomped angrily to the 
dugout -- and hit his head on the roof. 
</P>
<P>
"Aw, that was a freak deal," he said. "Two months from now, I could stumble on 
the carpet or hit my head on a pipe and people are going to remind me about 
what I've done and say, 'What else is going to happen to him?' " "Just because 
of the position I'm in, it gets a little more hype." 
</P>
<P>
The position he'd most like to be in is starting a World Series game for the 
Angels. A taste of the American League playoffs in 1986, when he made three 
appearances and pitched two innings, made him hunger for more. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have that big a role that year and now I've got a little bigger part 
to play," he said. "That's everybody's goal, to play in the World Series the 
first time. Once you're here, you work that much harder to get there. I know 
I'm working hard for that and everybody else here is striving for the same 
thing."

TO HIM, IT DOESN'T MEAN A THING IF IT'S NOT SWING; 
</P>
<P>
RADIO VETERAN JON HOLIDAY BELIEVES THAT BIG BANDS CAN KEEP WINNING FANS, AND 
HE'S PROVING IT WITH A NATIONALLY SYNDICATED SHOW.

"Big Band Swing -- the Hit Music of the 1990s!" Say what? Believe it. That's an 
actual headline from Fortune Magazine's "Trendspotter's to the Tastes of the 
1990s." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, predicting something doesn't make it happen, and this particular 
report from the old crystal ball might seem like especially wishful thinking. 
But it came as good news -- "real confirmation of what I believe in" -- to 
radio veteran Jon Holiday of San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the headline is far from the only thing that Holiday finds 
encouraging. All he has to do is check the Arbitron ratings for "Swing Era II," 
his nationally syndicated radio show. It's been battering the "adult 
contemporary" and "modern country" categories in some of the larger markets. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday says the show, which presents a blend of classic and contemporary 
swing, is the only one of its kind in syndication -- it's produced in stereo 
specifically for FM. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always felt that swing was due for a comeback," Holiday says. "Hell, I 
wasn't convinced it had ever really gone away. It was just being ignored by 
most radio programmers -- even though new swing records are being recorded 
every day." He cites Linda Ronstadt and the Manhattan Transfer as two such 
artists, along with lesser-known lights such as the Spitfire Band from Canada 
and Bill Tole's Orchestra from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem," Holiday says, "is that even with all the research they have 
available, a lot of people in the industry don't seem to know much about their 
audiences. They hang out with other radio people and they don't get out into 
the field to find out what their listeners want to hear." Among the 
disbelievers are programmers in Orange County, who won't give the hometown 
hero's show a slot. 
</P>
<P>
If his track record is any indication, though, Holiday knows just what his 
listeners want to hear. The most recent Arbitron numbers for Cleveland, for 
example, list his four-hour show, known there as "Big Band Saturday Night," as 
the top-rated radio program among people 35 to 64 years old. Figures for other 
cities -- Philadelphia, Washington, Jacksonville and San Antonio among them -- 
show similarly impressive results. 
</P>
<P>
What really makes Holiday gloat, though is that "in Philadelphia, we're getting 
500 listeners per quarter hour in the 12- to 17-year-old demographics!" 
</P>
<P>
"All the radio guys think kids don't like swing. But the truth is that kids do 
like it -- when they get a chance to hear it." 
</P>
<P>
Holiday's primary strategy for reaching "the kids" is to steer clear of 
nostalgia. "I don't, and I won't, program nostalgia," he declares. "I program 
swing music." The difference, he says, is that nostalgia is "designed to appeal 
to listeners who wish to be vicariously transported to the past," whereas swing 
music reaches out to listeners who are interested in "interpretation, 
improvisation, musical value and quality of composition. 
</P>
<P>
"The love of swing," Holiday asserts, "crosses all demographic lines. (It's) 
uninhibited by the age of the listener." 
</P>
<P>
About 25% of the music Holiday plays "is from the '30s and '40s -- Glenn 
Miller, Benny Goodman, and so forth," he says. "Fifty percent is from the '50s 
through the '70s -- Billy May, Ray Anthony, Frank Sinatra and Jo Stafford. And 
25% is music recorded in the '80s." (See box, next page.) 
</P>
<P>
Holiday, 69, is tall and craggy-looking and has the deceptively laid-back style 
of a cracker barrel philosopher. But he has the drive and determination of a 
man at least 10 years younger. His resume lists jobs at 14 radio stations in 10 
states stretching from Georgia to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday, who was born in New Jersey, began playing the clarinet in 1935 after 
he heard a radio broadcast by the Benny Goodman band. "I couldn't believe what 
I heard," he recalled. "Nobody could play like that. So I got really serious 
with the instrument. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time I was 14, I had a gig in a tavern, playing four hours a night for 
a buck an hour. May not sound like much now, but in 1935 that was pretty good 
pay. You could buy a hamburger for a dime and a Coke for a nickel. And they 
were real hamburgers." 
</P>
<P>
Holiday joined the Navy a year before World War II started. He managed to spend 
much of his shore leaves in New York City, following the multitude of big bands 
appearing there. But all that changed on Dec. 7, 1941. 
</P>
<P>
"After the war started, I spent four years, one month and three days outside 
the continental limits of the United States. Had two ships torpedoed under me, 
one of them sunk. I was awarded 12 battle stars. But I sure didn't hear a lot 
of music." 
</P>
<P>
When the war was over, Holiday was in Atlanta, uncertain whether to continue a 
music career. "I ran into two guys who'd been on the scene and asked them what 
was happening. One of them pulled out a record by an alto saxophone player, 
knowing that was my instrument. Well, I was just blown away. The next day I 
went out and sold my horn. The sax player was Charlie Parker." 
</P>
<P>
Holiday enrolled at the University of Georgia, majoring in journalism and 
music, and he soon was working at the Athens radio station WGAU. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the start of my radio career. From then on, as we used to say in the 
Navy, I never unpacked my sea bag. I worked in Athens, Ga., and Rockfield, S.C. 
-- which is a wide place in the road. I worked in Charlotte three or four 
different times, as well as Greensboro, Winston-Salem and Raleigh. I was in 
Little Rock, Ark., for five years, then Kansas City, El Paso, Spokane, Seattle 
and L.A. I guess I've pretty much covered the map." 
</P>
<P>
Late in 1983, Holiday suffered a severe heart attack. A triple bypass operation 
and long recuperation followed. "By the time I was ready to go back to work, my 
job was gone. And few radio stations are in love with the idea of employing 
program directors who are over the age of 60." 
</P>
<P>
Forced, then, to work as an independent, he founded Holiday Broadcasting and 
developed the "Swing Era II" syndication format. By the mid-'80s, it was 
established well enough to spin off a swing-oriented newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday's one real regret, he says, is that he has not been able to place the 
show on an Orange County station. "Oh, I've tried all right. But they've got 
their minds made up that what they're already doing is good enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to one local station about a Saturday night swing program -- that's 
when it's done best across the country -- and they said they were content to 
cover horse races in that time slot." He shakes his head in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
But his characteristic enthusiasm for all matters relating to swing soon 
overcomes his incredulity. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what I'd really like to see? Big band radio remotes, like the kind of 
broadcasts we used to get from all those famous ballrooms: the Glen Island 
Casino, the Steel Pier, Meadowbrook, the Palladium. 
</P>
<P>
"And it could be done, too," Holiday continues, his voice brightening with 
fervor. "Disneyland has bands working every weekend. You could easily do a live 
broadcast from there, and I'll bet you anything it would get better ratings 
than some of the sound-alike programming you hear on FM every night." 
</P>
<P>
Holiday pauses for a moment, a wry smile on his face. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, I'm well aware of the fact that I may be a dinosaur. I may be the last 
of a breed, trying to make this programming work. But I'm convinced that 
there're an awful lot of folks out there, maybe some of whom don't speak up 
quite often enough, who agree with me. So I'm going to hang in there and keep 
trying to make a case for swing music. 
</P>
<P>
"What the hell. Nobody ever said life was easy. And I'm too damn mean to die 
anyhow. When it gets right down to it, my final ambition is to keep on 
programming swing music -- and then get shot dead by a jealous husband when I'm 
99."

WILLIAM BALL STAYS UP AFTER THE FALL;

<P>
FOUR YEARS AFTER A CONTROVERSIAL DEPARTURE FROM A THEATER COMPANY HE FOUNDED, 
HE'S WINDING UP A ROLE IN 'CHERRY ORCHARD' IN LA JOLLA

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Chekhov, that supreme painter of ironies, is looking down from the heavens, 
he is no doubt smiling with quiet pleasure over the casting of William Ball as 
Leonid Gaev, whose family loses its homestead and deficit-plagued property in 
"The Cherry Orchard" at the La Jolla Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
It's perfect casting and not just because Ball lost his own cherry orchard of 
sorts four years ago. At the time, he resigned amid charges of poor management 
of the deficit-ridden American Conservatory Theatre, the San Francisco company 
he had founded and directed for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
Like Gaev, who is endlessly distracted by beauty, the 59-year-old Ball insists 
on accentuating the positive, even, some might say, at the expense of truth. 
After granting no interviews in four years, there are numerous questions about 
the various accusations leveled at him in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Did Ball -- one of the pioneers of the regional theater movement -- advance his 
own salary disproportionately at a time when the theater was in fiscal crisis? 
Was the well-publicized fight between him and Cyril Magnin, his longtime 
fund-raiser, the beginning of the end? Does he regret the letter he wrote to 
the California Arts Council, accusing the organization of "being ineffective 
and lacking in integrity" after it cut ACT's grant allocation by 83% from 1980 
to 1982? Does he regret leaving ACT? 
</P>
<P>
No, says he, denying it all, down to having the slightest twinge at the loss of 
ACT, where he hasn't seen a show since he left. 
</P>
<P>
"I did everything I wanted to do as a producer of a resident theater," he said. 
"I produced all the plays I wanted to (more than 300), raised all the money I 
ever want to raise. Twenty years at a job is enough." 
</P>
<P>
The only thing he does admit to is an unwillingness to talk about regrets: "The 
dark time," he says, "is like putting out the garbage. You don't look at the 
garbage." 
</P>
<P>
In a way, it is his continuing belief in himself that propelled his rise and 
then kept him afloat after his fall from grace. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always had this sense of being guided," he said recently. Such a hand may 
have pushed him to take this part -- the first acting job in 28 years for a man 
whom Craig 
</P>
<P>
Noel, executive director of the Old Globe Theatre here, calls "the best Hamlet 
I've ever seen." Ball played the role at the Old Globe in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
Guided or not, what in fact happened was that Ball moved to Los Angeles in 1986 
to develop feature film and television projects with producer Bud Yorkin; 
nothing came of that and he was willing to try something new after four years 
of sporadic employment, which included teaching and an ill-fated assignment at 
the Odyssey Theatre to direct "Tom and Viv." (Ron Sossi, artistic director of 
the Odyssey, told The Times that Ball quit prior to the opening when Sossi 
found fault with the leading actor, Scot Bishop; Ball said that he never 
formally agreed to direct the piece in the first place.) 
</P>
<P>
Ball acquired a casting agent who, on seeing Ball with a beard (since shaved), 
thought he looked Russian and sent Ball's picture to the Playhouse. He didn't 
realize that "Cherry Orchard" director Tom Moore had staged many shows for Ball 
at ACT, including a lavishly reviewed production of Chekhov's "The Three 
Sisters." 
</P>
<P>
Moore and Playhouse artistic director Des McAnuff went to Ball's home in Los 
Angeles to discuss the part and Ball auditioned for the role as any other actor 
would. "I wasn't quite sure how it would go . . . . But I'm having the time of 
my life." 
</P>
<P>
After years of literally and figuratively being the golden-haired boy, Ball, 
now balding and gray beneath the blond wig that he dons for Gaev, retains the 
charismatic zeal for art that has touched so many artists who worked under him 
at ACT: Harry Hamlin, Annette Benning, Michael Learned, Denzel Washington, Rene 
Auberjonois and Mark Harelik (also in "Cherry Orchard"). 
</P>
<P>
Harelik, who worked at ACT, from 1979-81, says he has never seen Ball work so 
hard, or be so happy. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very important to him that the play be successful and his role be 
successful," said Harelik, who plays Yermolai Lopakhin -- the character who 
purchases the Gaev estate. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he really knew what it would be like walking on stage again, in 
probably what he considered to be a relatively high-powered company, and with 
as demanding a director as Tom Moore, who is an absolute perfectionist. For him 
it was something like jumping off a cliff at night. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no sense of having been his prior subordinate," Harelik said. "It's 
almost as though during those years as artistic director he wanted to climb up 
on stage with us and now he's gotten his chance. He's just in heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Ball is also making a return as a director. Another graduate of ACT's acting 
program, Bonnie Tarwater, now the artistic director of the Del Mar Theatre 
Ensemble, just hired Ball to direct his own translation of Moliere's "Scapin," 
starring Tarwater and Scot Bishop (of the "Tom and Viv" controversy), for a 
July opening in San Diego. She sings his praises: "A lot of his ideas of 
heroics and positive thinking, the idea that if you can envision something you 
can make it so, has influenced my life in a big way." 
</P>
<P>
Recent hip replacement surgery has left Ball limping slightly and using a cane, 
which seems a poignant reminder of the knocks he has sustained. But his 
performance as Gaev is extravagant and fine, even though Ball refers to Gaev, 
affectionately, as "one of the dingiest characters that ever lived." 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to inspire high principles. He wants to preserve time-honored values, 
awaken a sense of the majesty and glory of life," Ball said. 
</P>
<P>
Ball's own theater career started "accidentally." As an undergraduate majoring 
in set design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, he was 
repeatedly cast in shows, so he switched his major to acting. Later a producer 
asked him what he should look for in a director for Chekhov's "Ivanov." The 
response impressed him so he asked Ball to take the job. The Obie award earned 
by the Off-Broadway production led to a flurry of directing offers. 
</P>
<P>
Then just as Ball was about to leave the nonprofit theater for commercial 
opportunities, a 26-page college paper he wrote on his vision of regional 
theater was sent to the Rockefeller Foundation, which Ball says made the offer 
he couldn't refuse: "Can you make it work? We have a check for $450,000 if you 
can." 
</P>
<P>
That Ball made it work in the form of the American Conservatory Theatre is 
history. That he made the word "conservatory," which once meant a music 
academy, mean a school of theater as well, is a matter of lexicological record. 
Benjamin Moore, Ball's managing director at ACT for 15 years, speaking from his 
current office at the Seattle Repertory Theatre where he is managing director, 
expressed admiration for what he refers to as Bill's "genius. It's thrilling to 
see him work again." But, at the same time, Moore expressed reservations about 
Ball's Draconian fund-raising methods that ultimately brought down his reign at 
ACT and nearly destroyed the company. 
</P>
<P>
According to several sources, Ball's regular approach was to threaten to close 
the theater or to move it to another city if he didn't get sufficient money. He 
also refused to work with a conventional board structure; Ball instead set up a 
national board of trustees that consisted of like-minded professionals and a 
California Assn. for ACT, which was a fund-raising organization without any 
governing powers. 
</P>
<P>
"So much of what he wanted to do and how he would do it ran so completely 
against the grain of a public trust organization," said Moore. "He arrived 
almost in the wrong century." 
</P>
<P>
Joy Carlin, who started working with Ball as an actress in 1969 and is now 
associate artistic director of ACT, blames the problems on "bad investments, 
bad judgment -- he was trying to do it all. Now we have business people taking 
care of business. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a genius. It was his inspiration that started the theater. But 20 years 
is a long time to maintain that genius or posture. People use the term 'burned 
out' or 'worn out' and I think that's what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Others like Rick Najera, one of the stars of "Latins Anonymous" and an ACT 
alum, complain of what Najera calls Ball's "cult of personality." Najera was 
bothered by Ball's extravagant speeches to the students at ACT about their 
being "the best and the brightest," and especially the effect such speeches had 
on an actress who knew that she would be cut from the second-year program along 
with half of the first-year class -- a customary procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you do when all of a sudden you're not the best and the brightest; 
what does that do to an impressionable head?" Najera said. "This girl tried to 
commit suicide. It was very tough at ACT." 
</P>
<P>
But Ball does not hear the critical voices. Like Gaev, who found relief from 
tension once the cherry orchard was lost, Ball describes the loss of the ACT as 
a helping hand that has brought him to where he says he wants to be -- teaching 
in Los Angeles, writing, directing and acting again. He follows his own advice. 
He takes chances. Maybe he failed big -- even if he won't admit it. But he 
continues to take chances. He thinks positively. He has ideas about where 
theater is headed in the '90s. He wants to be a part of it. He believes he is a 
part of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm beginning a new life," said Ball. "I'm tremendously grateful."

THE GRANDE DAME OF GAY LIBERATION; 
</P>
<P>
EVELYN HOOKER'S FRIENDSHIP WITH A UCLA STUDENT SPURRED HER TO STUDIES THAT 
CHANGED THE WAY PSYCHIATRISTS VIEW HOMOSEXUALITY 
</P>

<P>
THE SUMMER SUN beat down mercilessly as the Gay Pride Parade made its way along 
Santa Monica Boulevard. Leading the lively parade in a white Cadillac 
convertible was a striking woman whose strong, chiseled face resembles Golda 
Meir's. Evelyn Hooker, retired UCLA psychology professor, would seem an 
unlikely grand marshal. But as she smiled and waved to the crowd lined up five 
deep on both sides of the parade route, dozens of spectators rushed up to greet 
her by name and cheer her on. Many others, however, were probably wondering how 
a woman who calls herself "hopelessly heterosexual" had come to occupy the 
place of honor at the Los Angeles gay community's biggest annual event. 
</P>
<P>
Three decades earlier, Hooker published a paper in which she cautiously 
concluded that homosexuality was not a mental illness, as most psychiatrists 
assumed. Experts agree that it was the first careful, controlled scientific 
study of the mental health of gay people. When the American Psychiatric Assn. 
decided to remove homosexuality from the second edition of its Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders in 1973, Hooker's study was a major 
piece of evidence used to attack the idea that homosexuality was a sickness -- 
a psychopathological condition, in the jargon of psychiatry. "It was the 
reference point we always went back to," says Dr. Judd Marmor, a former APA 
president and a leading proponent of "de-pathologizing" homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
Hooker, now 82 and retired, lives alone in the sunny Santa Monica apartment she 
has occupied for the past 20 years. Slowed by a bad back and other health 
problems, she retains a commanding yet warm presence. As she talks about 
scholarly research on sexual behavior, it is easy to see why former students 
describe her as charismatic: Her enthusiasm for the material is contagious. At 
the same time, she takes a keen interest in people, and the unwary interviewer, 
flattered by the attention of her searching intelligence, can find himself 
answering Hooker's questions instead of asking his own. She is a woman of 
strongly held opinions, but she will as often as not answer a question with a 
"I'm not sure about that. What do you think?" An accomplished raconteur, she 
enjoys telling her stories and often breaks into a hearty laugh. At the end of 
one anecdote, she says with mocking self-importance, "I usually require an 
audience of at least a thousand to tell that one." 
</P>
<P>
But when Hooker leans back in her armchair, enveloped in cigarette smoke and 
lost in thought, one can imagine her listening intently to the patients who 
came to her during the 15 years she was a psychotherapist. "When you talk to 
her, you instantly feel the difference," says Los Angeles artist Don Bachardy, 
a longtime friend. "Most people don't listen. Evelyn does." Though she no 
longer practices or teaches, she continues to read voraciously and frequently 
serves as a consultant on papers and manuscripts relating to sexuality and 
homosexuality. In fact, she had to delay one interview until she finished 
reviewing a series of papers from an "AIDS and Sex" conference at the Kinsey 
Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction. 
</P>
<P>
Upon reflection, Hooker is at a loss to explain why she didn't share the 
pervasive prejudice against homosexuality that was more common when she first 
began her research in the late 1940s. Some of it she attributes to her warm 
feelings for the remarkable group of gay men with whom she was friendly: 
Christopher Isherwood, the novelist and outspoken gay-rights advocate who died 
in 1986, Don Bachardy (Isherwood's lover) and poet W. H. Auden, among others. 
For a time, Isherwood lived in a cottage on the grounds of Hooker's Brentwood 
house. "Christopher was an interesting mixture of two character traits," Hooker 
recalls, "an absolutely compelling sense of humor and a deadly seriousness." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in life, she observed acts of prejudice against ethnic minorities, 
which may have affected her feelings about the treatment of outsiders of any 
kind. During a fellowship in Europe in 1937, she lived with a Jewish family in 
Berlin. She became close to them and, though she never witnessed the worst 
anti-Semitic persecutions, she watched as members of the family were taunted in 
school, lost jobs and went to prison. Although Hooker is not Jewish, a mezuza 
-- a Jewish ceremonial object attached to the door frame of a house -- hangs in 
her home. "It was here when I moved in," she says, "and I couldn't take it 
down." 
</P>
<P>
EVELYN Hooker started her professional life as a researcher in animal 
psychology, at one time studying the behavior of neurotic rats. Born to a poor 
farming family in Nebraska in 1907, she earned bachelor's and master's degrees 
in psychology at the University of Colorado and a Ph.D. at Johns Hopkins 
University. After working at several colleges, she came to UCLA in 1939. While 
teaching an introductory night class during the latter part of World War II, 
she met a student who changed her life. 
</P>
<P>
"It quickly became clear that Sam From was very bright," she recalls. For his 
part, From went away from the first session of Hooker's class and told friends 
that his new teacher was "another Eleanor Roosevelt" -- a woman of high ideals 
who spoke her mind. The two became friendly when From offered his professor a 
ride home after class. When the course ended, From called on Hooker and her 
first husband, Don Caldwell, a Hollywood screenwriter. After From's first 
visit, Caldwell said, "You told me everything else about him. Why didn't you 
tell me he was queer?" Hooker had never given the matter any thought and asked 
her husband how he knew. "He did everything but fly out the kitchen window," he 
replied. Surprised, Hooker accepted the information easily and continued the 
friendship. 
</P>
<P>
From and his lover spent a good deal of time with Hooker and her husband. On 
one occasion, the two couples went to San Francisco and took in the drag show 
at the Finocchio Club, the famous North Beach nightspot. Back at the Fairmont 
Hotel, From told her: "Now we have let you see us as we are. It is your 
scientific duty to do a study of people like us." 
</P>
<P>
Hooker insisted that she couldn't undertake such a project. As a "rat-runner," 
she worried that human behavior was not her area of expertise. In any case, she 
was already teaching 18 hours a week as well as conducting animal experiments. 
But From kept pressing her. He eventually won her over and persuaded her to 
begin the research. Hooker began to administer psychological tests to gay men 
whom she recruited through From. But she abandoned the project when she went to 
teach at Bryn Mawr College after the breakup of her marriage in 1947. She 
returned to UCLA the following year and married Edward Hooker, an English 
literature professor on campus, in 1951. (He died six years later.) She resumed 
her research on gay men, and shortly thereafter, From died in an auto accident 
as he was returning from the Salton Sea. "It was just before Christmas," Hooker 
says. "He was always a very generous person -- he had made all the (holiday) 
preparations. All his friends, myself included, were absolutely devastated." 
</P>
<P>
After From's death, Hooker continued to pursue her research, but she realized 
that she would need a comparison group of heterosexual men if she ever hoped to 
publish her findings. 
</P>
<P>
With a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health in 1954, Hooker was 
ready to proceed in earnest. She believed that there would not be a 
statistically significant difference between the test results of heterosexual 
and homosexual men. "How could my hypothesis have been anything else?" she 
asks. "I'd seen these men and saw nothing psychopathological in their 
behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Hooker had little trouble recruiting 30 homosexual subjects. By this time, she 
had dozens of gay friends and acquaintances, including members of the 
Mattachine Society, the pioneering gay liberation group founded in Los Angeles 
in 1951. Finding heterosexual subjects proved more difficult. She canvassed the 
education secretaries of labor unions, thinking that they would have liberal 
attitudes. "I was wrong," she says; as soon as she explained the nature of the 
study, no one wanted to participate. Not only was there the traditional 
moralistic taboo against homosexuality but also anti-Communist witch-hunting 
targeted "sexual perverts" along with the politically unorthodox. So Hooker 
took to collaring candidates wherever she could find them, including a fireman 
who showed up to inspect her home. "No man is safe on Saltair Avenue," joked 
her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Subjects in place, Hooker began the long and demanding testing. Each of the 60 
subjects was given an IQ test and three projective personality tests widely 
used at the time: the Rorschach test, the Thematic Apperception Test and the 
Make A Picture Story test. The Rorschach test requires subjects to describe 
ambiguously shaped ink blots. In the Thematic Apperception Test, the subject is 
asked to describe and make up stories about human images. The picture test is 
similar, except that the subject is asked to place cut-out figures in a variety 
of settings, such as a living room, a street or a bedroom, and then tell 
stories about them. 
</P>
<P>
Hooker submitted the test results to three judges, all recognized psychological 
experts, who did not know whether a subject was homosexual or heterosexual. 
First, they evaluated each test and assigned a rating of overall psychological 
adjustment on a scale of 1 (superior) to 5 (maladjusted). On all three tests, 
two-thirds of the heterosexuals and homosexuals were assigned a rating of 3 
(average) or better. Next, the judges were presented with pairs of tests and 
asked to distinguish between heterosexual and homosexual. They were able to do 
so no more accurately than if they had been flipping a coin. 
</P>
<P>
The judges' shock is readily apparent in Hooker's description of their efforts: 
"As a judge compared the matched protocols (results), he would frequently 
comment, 'There are no clues' or 'These are so similar that you are out to skin 
us alive' or 'I just have to guess.' " Before he became a judge in the project, 
Edwin Shneidman, inventor of the picture test, had assumed that he would be 
able to pick out a homosexual with no trouble. By way of comparison, he says 
that "if you showed me the protocols for 30 schizophrenics, I'd be surprised if 
I didn't get 28." What Hooker's test proved, he says, is that "homosexuality is 
not a diagnostic category." 
</P>
<P>
Hooker recalls that when Shneidman was analyzing one subject's picture test, he 
went through the living room, bathroom and street scenes, saying, "This is as 
heterosexual as I've seen." When he turned to the bedroom scene, he discovered 
that the subject had placed two male figures -- one naked, one clothed -- in 
bed together. "He's heterosexual everywhere but the bedroom," he said and then 
burst out laughing. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a paradigmatic moment of the study," Shneidman now says. 
</P>
<P>
Hooker published her findings, titled "The Adjustment of the Male Overt 
Homosexual," in the Journal of Projective Techniques in 1957. Criticism sprang 
up almost immediately. Dr. Irving Bieber, a psychoanalyst and leading proponent 
of the view that homosexuality is an illness, wrote in 1962 that "the tests 
themselves or the current methods of interpretation and evaluation are 
inadequate to the task of discriminating between homosexuals and 
heterosexuals." Years later, however, researchers confirmed Hooker's results. 
</P>
<P>
AFTER THE publication of her paper, Hooker continued her research but began to 
approach the gay community as an anthropologist might. She visited Los Angeles 
gay bars to better understand how homosexuals lived. "Quite early on, I began 
to have a sense that there was a gigantic intercommunicating network," she 
says. "If the larger body politic has a community and gay people are left out 
of it -- or think they are -- they are going to form one of their own." 
</P>
<P>
Whenever the opportunity arose, Hooker dashed off to a bar with a gay friend or 
her graduate assistant for an evening of observation. Over the course of a 
decade, she interviewed hustlers, drag queens, as well as less-colorful 
patrons. She focused on bars because of their central place in gay society. In 
the days before gay volleyball leagues and clubs for gay bankers or bikers, the 
bars were practically the only social forum available to homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
As a woman -- and almost 6 feet tall to boot -- she stood out in the all-male 
environments. She never took notes for fear of standing out even more. The fact 
that she usually went with a known patron of the bar smoothed the way for her. 
Generally, she didn't worry about what might happen if the police showed up. 
One time, however, she asked an attorney if she would have any problems if the 
police stopped her while driving with a man in drag. "Stay the hell out of the 
car," the lawyer advised, and Hooker did. 
</P>
<P>
Just entering a gay bar at that time was dangerous enough: Police raids were 
common well into the 1960s. As a precaution, she obtained a letter signed by 
the UCLA chancellor explaining the nature of her research; she carried that 
letter for 20 years but never had occasion to use it. 
</P>
<P>
Hooker modestly downplays her bar studies, saying they weren't systematic 
enough. But they were published in a number of scholarly journals and prompted 
more thorough studies of bar culture and other aspects of gay life. And her 
writings about the gay community and its social institutions were ahead of 
their time: As she noted in a 1956 article, "many homosexuals are beginning to 
think of themselves as constituting a minority, sharing many of the problems of 
other minority groups, having to struggle for their 'rights' against the 
prejudices of a dominant heterosexual majority." 
</P>
<P>
By the late 1960s, Hooker was recognized within the scholarly community as a 
leading authority on homosexual behavior and was asked by the director of the 
National Institute of Mental Health to head its Task Force on Homosexuality. 
The group recommended decriminalizing homosexual acts between consenting adults 
and psychiatric treatment for homosexuals who desired it. Hooker acknowledges 
that she may have been too optimistic in hoping that all its recommendations -- 
including the establishment of a center for the study of sexual behavior -- 
would be implemented. Nevertheless, the report expressed a more compassionate 
approach and encouraged a flowering of research during the next two decades. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, Hooker went into private practice in Westwood as a psychotherapist. At 
the same time she was changing her life, the American gay community was 
undergoing a revolution. On June 27, 1969, a group of lesbians and gay men, 
including drag queens and young runaways, rioted after a routine police raid at 
the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York's Greenwich Village. Two nights of 
rock- and bottle-throwing ensued, and the name Stonewall became a byword for 
American gay liberation. In the following years, gay organizing picked up 
momentum, and a panoply of gay liberation groups emerged. 
</P>
<P>
Gay activists began targeting psychiatry, contending that it had taken over the 
traditional role of religion in supporting cultural and social prejudice 
against homosexuality. They alleged that labeling homosexuals as sick was the 
justification for keeping sodomy laws in place and for practicing job 
discrimination. The gay patient who went to a psychiatrist usually embarked on 
a course of individual or group therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation. 
In the newer behavioral approach, gay men were given electric shocks when shown 
pictures of nude men to extinguish sexual desire for them. In 1972, the Gay 
Activist Alliance staged a demonstration during a meeting of the Assn. for the 
Advancement of Behavior Therapy to protest the use of aversion techniques. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, gay activists began meeting with members of the American 
Psychiatric Assn. to discuss the classification of homosexuality as a 
psychological disorder. In December, 1973, the APA board of trustees voted to 
remove homosexuality from its diagnostic manual while adding the classification 
"sexual orientation disturbance" for people who are disturbed by their 
orientation. But the new entry stated that homosexuality "does not necessarily 
constitute a psychiatric disorder." 
</P>
<P>
The decision was vehemently criticized by many within the association, who 
successfully pushed for a referendum by the entire membership. The membership 
reaffirmed the board's decision, although 37% of the members voted against it. 
Opponents of the change tried to challenge the referendum result on the grounds 
that the National Gay Task Force had helped organize a mailing to the APA 
membership. The APA upheld the results of the vote and ruled that no unethical 
action had taken place. 
</P>
<P>
Hooker says she "did not lift a finger" to influence the APA action, although 
she was aware of the battle. Bruce Voeller, former president of the Gay 
Activist Alliance, says that Hooker's study had a profound influence on the APA 
-- and provided gay people with a positive self-image. "Evelyn's work gave us 
the opportunity to stop thinking of ourselves as sick and perverted," he says. 
"It is difficult to overestimate how important her contribution is." 
</P>
<P>
ONE OF HOOKER'S contributions to the research community has been to legitimize 
homosexuality as a field of study. "She's stimulated other people to do 
research on homosexual behavior," says Joe Carrier, a Los Angeles 
anthropologist who has studied homosexuality in Mexico and who considers Hooker 
one of his closest friends. "Over the years, she's been approached by a number 
of graduate students for advice, and I don't think she's ever turned anyone 
down." 
</P>
<P>
According to John De Cecco, editor of the Journal of Homosexuality and 
professor of psychology at San Francisco State University, gay studies have 
grown dramatically during the past few years. "First, there was a focus on gay 
people themselves, which gradually broadened out to the social and political 
environment," he says. "The area where research is now going on with the 
greatest energy is history." Recent books have looked at subjects as diverse as 
ancient Greek homosexuality as a social institution and gay people in the 
American military in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Hooker points with great interest to new research on racial and ethnic groups 
within the gay population, including Carrier's studies of male homosexual 
behavior in Guadalajara. Carrier found that his subjects classified themselves 
as active or passive according to their sexual behavior more rigidly than 
American gay men. 
</P>
<P>
There also has been a surge in homophobia studies. A number of researchers have 
determined that prejudice against gay people tends to correlate highly with 
other types of intolerance, such as racism and sexism. 
</P>
<P>
The lesbian community, neglected in the past, is also receiving more attention. 
Hooker never studied lesbians for two reasons: She did not have the personal 
entree into the lesbian community that her friendships with gay men gave her, 
and she thought that a woman researcher -- even a married one -- could have 
been undermined by critics who might have questioned her sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
During the course of her professional life, Hooker has witnessed a growing 
social acceptance of gay people. According to the National Gay and Lesbian Task 
Force, there are between 45 and 50 openly gay and lesbian elected and appointed 
officials in the United States, including two congressmen. "It trickles down 
into every area," she says. "It's remarkable." She wishes she could conduct 
some interviews on gay attitudes toward the larger society. "My hunch is that 
there would not be as many grievances as there were in 1954." 
</P>
<P>
But Hooker has her own grievances about an overriding issue in the '90s -- 
federal AIDS policy. "The scandalous thing about federal policy is that the 
expenditures are niggardly," she says. She also decries the labeling of people 
with AIDS as guilty victims who have brought the disease upon themselves. "What 
ought to be involved is an all-out effort of the federal government in the 
discovery of a cure and a vaccine." 
</P>
<P>
For years, Hooker was an unsung heroine of the American gay community's 
struggle for acceptance and equal rights. Although well known among 
specialists, she recently has been receiving a good deal of notice, including 
leading the 1986 Gay Pride Parade. A documentary by filmmaker Richard 
Schmiechen (who won an Oscar for the 1984 documentary "The Times of Harvey 
Milk") is scheduled for broadcast on public television this winter. Last 
December, she received the Morris Kight Humanitarian Award from the Los Angeles 
Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center "for her compassion, foresight, 
intelligence and tenacity which has enriched and improved the quality of life 
for all lesbians and gay men." 
</P>
<P>
Accepting awards sometimes poses a challenge to Hooker's speech-making ability. 
When she was asked to address the Assn. of Gay and Lesbian Psychiatrists, she 
wondered what she could possibly tell them that they didn't already know. "I 
decided to talk about not what I did for them but what they did for me," she 
recalls. "Suppose," she said to them, "I had not started this research. Where 
would I be today? I'd be doing animal research until the animal activists got 
to me." In a more serious vein, she told the group that friendships in the gay 
world have enriched her life deeply. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the great joys of my life is that I was able to do something for the 
ordinary man and woman," she says. Often, people have approached her to thank 
her for her work. One woman told her that she had been waiting to meet her for 
years. Her parents had sent her to a sanitarium when they had found out she was 
a lesbian; the only thing that prevented her from undergoing electroshock 
treatment was that her doctor had read Hooker's research. Another time, a 
pediatrician at a meeting of gay health workers came forward. "I hunted 
everywhere for some encouraging word about my homosexuality," he told her, 
tears streaming down his face. "And I didn't find it until I read your work." 
</P>
<P>
Says Hooker: "I'm gratified that my work had an effect on the APA, but what 
really brings joy to my heart is that somehow it reached those people I wanted 
it to reach."

Boss: 
</P>
<P>
Here are the notes from my interview with Warren Beatty. As I said, even though 
the two hours he promised me turned into nine hours and a Chinese dinner, I 
didn't really get a chance to ask him many of the questions I'd prepared. He 
took the interview away from me in the first minute and by the time I got it 
back, it was midnight and my mind was as weak as the batteries in my tape 
recorder. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not complaining about the assignment. Beatty, as advertised, is good 
company: bright, thoughtful, funny and as openly excited about his life as 
anyone I've met. At times, he would lapse into reverie about the great people 
he's known in film and politics -- even journalism -- and talk about the upside 
of fame as if he'd won it all in a lottery. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, he will only talk about himself in the abstract. He will not go on 
the record on any subject where he would appear critical of someone, or reveal 
some tidbit about a relationship. He keeps up on the gossip about himself, I 
can tell you, but he isn't about to contribute to it. At least not on the 
record. By the end of the evening, he had told some of the greatest Warren 
Beatty stories I've ever heard, but only after he'd reached over and turned off 
my tape recorder. 
</P>
<P>
The reason the interview got away from me -- other than the fact that he's kind 
of a take-charge guy -- is that I prepared for the wrong things. Having seen 
the Barbara Walters interview, which consisted mostly of them agreeing on how 
badly the interview was going, and reading the recent Rolling Stone piece, in 
which his answers to questions about his virility and image included pauses 
that lasted as long as a gall bladder infection, I decided to take the high 
road and focus on his attitudes about filmmaking, Hollywood and his own career. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 20 years, he's been one of the ultimate Hollywood insiders, a 
double-threat power player in the sense that he can tie up important projects 
as both an actor and a producer, and he's a Hall of Fame limousine liberal. 
</P>
<P>
What I didn't know was that he had been preparing for the interview longer than 
I had. In fact, he'd been working himself up for it for three years, ever since 
Sunday Calendar published a story about the making, marketing and swollen 
budget of "Ishtar." I didn't write that piece, as he knew. But there I was. 
</P>
<P>
"Before we start, let me ask you a question," Beatty said, as soon as we had 
closed the doors in a small cutting room of the Hollywood studio where he was 
doing some final tweaking of the sound track of "Dick Tracy." It was about 3 in 
the afternoon. "May I write a letter to the Los Angeles Times that you would 
print?" 
</P>
<P>
It sounded like a trick question, and it was. Sure, we'd print his letter, I 
said. "But why don't you just tell me what's on your mind and maybe it could be 
incorporated into this story?" Did I get an earful! That "Ishtar" article had 
formed a lump in his throat the size and flavor of a camel and he was using me 
to dislodge it. He was also angered by a rumor whispered to him by one of his 
publicists that he'd better give us a better interview than he had given 
ABC-TV's Barbara Walters or he'd end up on our cutting room floor. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, (the Walters interview) was funny," he said. "But I hate it when 
somebody says, 'Well, he didn't talk to her.' I talked to Barbara Walters at 
length about a myriad of crap. . . . Do you think I sat for the 15 or 20 
minutes the way they used it? The frustrating thing is you sit there and go 
through the serious stuff and then it's not what (they use)." 
</P>
<P>
There's the irony, huh? I went in planning to talk only about the serious stuff 
and suddenly I'm Father Kerrigan in "The Exorcist," covered with the green curd 
of the devil's breath. But as harsh as all this seems when it's played back, 
there wasn't an uncomfortable moment in the entire day. Beatty's attack had a 
specific target -- entertainment journalism, particularly as practiced in his 
hometown newspaper -- but his approach was intellectual, reasoned, almost 
fraternal (you'll recall he played a journalist in "Parallax View" and "Reds"). 
The Beatty graciousness we'd heard about ("Would you like something to drink?" 
"Is that chair comfortable") was evident at all times. 
</P>
<P>
But the camel had to come out. 
</P>
<P>
"The Los Angeles Times doesn't seem to take itself as seriously as the paper of 
record for a place that is the cultural engine in several fields of the 
country," Beatty said. "Calendar doesn't know if it wants to be a cultural 
section or a business section so it mixes the two. . . . It seems that (the 
newspaper) thinks that what sells, sells." 
</P>
<P>
Beatty said the media's routine reporting of things like box-office grosses, 
film budgets and production problems demeans the actual films, and that while 
they may make good business stories, they shouldn't be published in the 
cultural pages where readers and potential investors will get the idea that the 
only measure of success is the bottom line. He went farther, saying that 
box-office reports are promoting bad movies: "People see that one movie is 
making more money than another and think, well, maybe that's a better movie." 
</P>
<P>
Beatty says that "money" stories can both heighten and lower interest in movies 
for reasons unrelated to the movies themselves, and -- here comes the camel -- 
he cites "Ishtar" as one of the victims. Beatty does not acknowledge that 
"Ishtar" -- directed by Elaine May, produced by him, and released by Columbia 
Pictures in the spring of 1987 -- was any kind of creative failure. He calls 
the film a "nice little comedy that cost too much money" and blames both the 
studio management and the media for killing it before it reached the theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot make a movie today that has any visibility for it and not be 
supported by the studio," he said. He made his strongest comments about former 
Columbia chief David Puttnam off the record, but he let this much stand: 
"(Puttnam) never talked to the director, he never talked to me, he never saw 
the movie. He just said, 'This is not going to work.' You know, the movie was 
previewed three times before all that negative publicity was unleashed on it, 
and each of the previews were great. I have never had a more successful 
preview. And your own critic gave it a good review." 
</P>
<P>
True, but there weren't many good reviews. Most critics panned it. 
</P>
<P>
"How could they not? After all that (negative publicity), how could they like 
it? You can't laugh at a $40 million movie." 
</P>
<P>
Beatty said that he and Dustin Hoffman foresaw the problems coming on "Ishtar" 
and offered to defer their salaries (reportedly $5.5 million each) in order to 
keep the cost of production down, and that Columbia declined. The Times was not 
the first publication to cover "Ishtar's" production problems in Morocco, but 
it was "the most vicious," according to Beatty, and because of the paper's 
influence, it caused a negative backlash with critics elsewhere and with people 
in the film community. 
</P>
<P>
Although he does not like to have press people on the sets of his movies, he 
said he "opened" "Dick Tracy" to deter speculation. "I'm scared to have a 
closed set now," he said. "The only way you can combat the negative rumors is 
to invite anyone in." 
</P>
<P>
"Ishtar" and the larger subject of cultural reporting took up the first three 
hours we were together and then became the leitmotif for the rest of the day. 
Even though the conversation -- that's what it was, not an interview -- took 
some interesting side roads through his film and political past, and his 
attitudes about today's Hollywood versus the one he found when he arrived 30 
years ago, virtually every subject spun from his current fixation on America's 
swing to the right, which he partly blames for the Decline and Fall of American 
Journalism. 
</P>
<P>
"Movies have gotten tamer, politics have gotten tamer, everything's gotten 
tamer," he said, at one point. "And I'll tell you something else. In actual 
political analysis, journalism has gotten tamer. Much tamer. It's a 
catastrophe! They're not very tame about trying to uncover sexual peccadilloes 
of people and things like that, but getting down to what's really happening in 
the country, it's very tame." 
</P>
<P>
That last reference includes the media flashfire that incinerated his friend 
Gary Hart's political hopes during the last presidential primary campaigns. 
Beatty stumped for Hart, as he did years earlier for Bobby Kennedy, Hubert 
Humphrey and George McGovern, and he thinks the media speculation over the 
relationship between Hart and model Donna Rice may have cost the country a 
great leader. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, he is sympathetic to any public figure whose sex life becomes more 
important to the public than whatever it is that made him a public figure in 
the first place. He accuses the media of loading up with demographic research, 
then pandering to the majority's worst instincts. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only does (this approach of discussing sex) reduce me as a human being, it 
reduces the writer as a human being, and it reduces the reader as human beings. 
Do we all want to be reduced? Is that what we want?" 
</P>
<P>
Not me, and true to my word, I did not ask him about his sex life. But the 
Beatty Legend is there and to identify him as someone who makes movies is like 
identifying Casanova as a guy who worked in a library. Beatty won't discuss any 
personal relationship -- "never have, I won't now, I don't intend to" -- but 
the smile says everything when you suggest that there are worse things than 
being thought of as intelligent, stimulating and sexually indefatigable. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, oh, oh, yeah. It could be a lot worse," Beatty said. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, if you have to have an image, this one's not bad," I offered. 
</P>
<P>
"Listen, I've been famous since 1960 and . . . and . . . I've been lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Beatty's image was formed almost immediately when he got to Hollywood in 1960 
to play the high school heartbreaker in Elia Kazan's "Splendor in the Grass." 
Kazan was a director noted for his work with such emotionally mercurial and 
sexually charismatic actors as Montgomery Clift, Marlon Brando and James Dean, 
so all eyes were on Shirley MacLaine's little brother. The movie was a critical 
success and Beatty's star has not really dimmed since, even though he has done 
only 18 films altogether, and just four in the last 15 years, including "Dick 
Tracy." 
</P>
<P>
Less than half of his films can be regarded as socially, critically or 
commercially important and of the five films he's produced, only three -- 
"Bonnie and Clyde," "Shampoo" and "Reds" -- tapped into any of the serious 
social issues in which he has been personally interested. The only one of those 
he directed was "Reds." 
</P>
<P>
Those are great movies and it says something about Beatty's appeal that he has 
remained one of Hollywood's most prized actors despite his light workload. But 
the question is begged: For someone as hypercritical of others in the media, 
why hasn't he done more -- through his own medium of movies -- to address some 
of the social problems he's complaining about? 
</P>
<P>
He thought for a while and spoke very slowly. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, the answer to (that) is I think I will (make more of those movies) and 
I'm slow. It takes me a long time to develop things and I think about them a 
long time. I've been developing a movie about Howard Hughes quite a long time. 
I developed 'Reds' for a long time. There's a movie I've been working on that 
deals with some of this stuff. . . . But when you're asked why don't you work 
harder, I think the answer is I ought to work harder and I ought to work 
faster, but I don't." 
</P>
<P>
He then drifted into another explanation that seemed to raise a second 
contradiction. 
</P>
<P>
"I think your whole life is not made up of making movies. . . . You have 
another side to your life, your own personal exist 
</P>
<P>
ence. And if you're not totally self-indulgent and self-concerned, you have a 
political side of your life in which you relate to the society you live in. I 
don't know that movies have to be as articulate about your society views as you 
would be if you just went ahead and said what you think." 
</P>
<P>
Other than speaking out for political candidates, Beatty has been notoriously 
mum on other subjects. When Paramount released the $33 million "Reds" in 1981, 
some right-wing publications attacked Gulf &amp; Western, the studio's parent 
company, for financing it. Beatty did no interviews, prompting others to scold 
him for hanging Gulf &amp; Western out to dry. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that people didn't understand the nature of it and actually there was 
nothing I could do by running around proselytizing for it," he said. "I always 
had doubts that a movie about a communist who dies at the end, a movie about a 
dream that seemed to be not working, a movie that was 3 1/2 hours long, would 
(have a big audience)." 
</P>
<P>
Beatty said the communications revolution has made the speed with which 
information can be moved more important than the information itself, and the 
result is a lot of bad info being taken seriously. He blames Ronald Reagan, the 
Great Communicator, for failing to warn the nation about the downside of the 
new technology, in the way Eisenhower warned of the dangers of the military 
industrial complex when he left office 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Because you can't cut down on the technology, there has to be a lot more talk. 
I've decided that it's stingy of me not to participate in that talk. . . . It's 
self-defeating, non-contributive and ultimately antisocial not to participate." 
</P>
<P>
So he's making himself more available as "Dick Tracy" approaches, and if people 
want to ask him about his sex life or his image, he'll wait them out with 
pauses. If you want to know what's really on his mind, you get these passionate 
speeches about what's going wrong with the world and your part in it. And if 
you listen long enough, the subject of gossip comes up because it's played such 
a big part in his life. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing his background as a confidante to Bobby Kennedy and other major liberal 
Democrats during the late '60s and early '70s, you have to wonder how much of 
his current anger is fueled by memories of a period that was not only more 
dynamic politically and socially, but for him personally. He admits that as a 
young actor, it was a heady experience getting to know people like Kazan, 
Michelangelo Antonioni, Francois Truffaut (who put him up to doing "Bonnie and 
Clyde"), Jean Renoir, Clifford Odets and David O. Selznick. As he drifted into 
politics, he got to know his political heroes too -- the Kennedys, Eugene 
McCarthy, Stuart Symington, Abraham Ribikoff. And through politics, he met his 
heroes in . . . journalism. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great (expletive) time," Beatty said, excitedly. "I was ecstatic that 
I had access to newspapermen at that time. I had access to Arthur Krock, Walter 
Lippman, James Reston, Izzy Stone. These amazing people, this amazing period." 
</P>
<P>
It's an even more amazing time looking back, and when I wondered out loud what 
it must have been like to have been in Bobby Kennedy's inner circle during that 
intoxicating, ill-fated 1968 campaign, there was a real moment. Beatty put his 
feet up on a table, crossed his arms and sighed loud enough to leave a skid 
mark on my tape. He paused several seconds, his eyes misted over, then he began 
softly: "It's funny. When I see those people from those years, you couldn't pay 
me enough money to do movies (that would) take me away from that involvement. . 
. . It's very different, it's the real thing." 
</P>
<P>
Beatty's artistic contributions to that tumultuous period of the late '60s and 
early '70s were "Bonnie and Clyde," which came to be regarded as a metaphor for 
America's restless youth, and the 1974 "Shampoo," a social comedy about sexual 
and political self-indulgence in 1968 Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The release of "Bonnie and Clyde," which was produced by Beatty and directed by 
Arthur Penn, is one of the great success stories in Hollywood history. Warner 
Bros. had no faith in the movie and when it was panned by critics at the New 
York Times and at Time and Newsweek magazines, the studio pulled it from 
release. Beatty recalled the unusual review he got from Jack Warner when he and 
Arthur Penn showed him the rough cut at his house. They had been warned that if 
Warner went to the bathroom during the screening, they knew they were in 
trouble. Beatty said that by his count, Warner rated "Bonnie and Clyde" "a 
three-piss movie." 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'How long was that picture?' At that time, it was about two hours and 
10 minutes. He said, 'That's the longest damn two hours and 10 minutes I've 
ever spent."' 
</P>
<P>
Beatty stumped for his movie with critics and when Pauline Kael weighed in with 
a 9,000-word New Yorker review extolling "Bonnie and Clyde" as a breakthrough 
in film art, both her and Beatty's careers were elevated. Other critics -- 
including those who'd panned it earlier for the news magazines -- reconsidered 
and Warner re-eleased it to great commercial success, followed by nine Oscar 
nominations. (A decade later, Beatty recruited Kael to work for him as a 
production executive, but the relationship was severed soon after and Beatty 
said they haven't spoken since.) 
</P>
<P>
Because the studio had no faith in "Bonnie and Clyde," Beatty was given a 
greater percentage of the gross profits than he would normally get and the 
movie made him rich. He had taken roles earlier because he was broke, but 
suddenly he was free to do as he wanted, and mainly, that was to get involved 
in the political campaigns of liberal Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Although he acted in four films (and two very good ones: "The Parallax View" 
and "McCabe and Mrs. Miller"), it was six years before he would produce again. 
That was "Shampoo" and though Beatty seems more enthusiastic about that film 
than any other he's done, he again faced a disinterested studio chief. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember after the first preview of that movie, the head of the studio put 
his hand on my knee and said, 'Look, they can't all be good. So you just go on 
to the next one.' The very next night we ran it again in Beverly Hills and the 
roof went off. They loved it and we didn't change a thing." 
</P>
<P>
"Shampoo" starred Beatty as a philandering hair dresser who can't commit 
himself to anything but satisfying the swarms of sexually exercised women 
around him. The film is extremely political at its core, one of the most 
telling films of the sexual revolution, but it was the assumption that Beatty 
was playing himself that dominated much of the analysis. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they thought it was somehow sexually self-advertising in an arrogant 
way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Beatty loves the movie. "It's a great film, it's as political as you can get 
and it's outrageous. . . . There was a real revolution, a cultural and sexual 
revolution, that 'Shampoo' tapped into." 
</P>
<P>
Since "Shampoo," Beatty has had one monster commercial hit -- "Heaven Can 
Wait," which he co-wrote (with Elaine May), co-directed (with Buck Henry) and 
produced. Beatty agrees with Pauline Kael, who called it a "piffle," but 
Academy members anointed it with nine nominations. "Reds," while not a 
financial disaster, had the trouble Beatty predicted for it at the box office, 
but ran up a total of 12 Oscar nominations and made Beatty the only person 
besides Orson Welles to receive four nominations -- writing, directing, 
producing and acting -- for one movie. Beatty won that year for best director; 
"Chariots of Fire" won for best picture. 
</P>
<P>
"Bonnie and Clyde" and "Shampoo" were part of a political Golden Age in 
Hollywood, a period of about 12 years where issues-oriented filmmakers 
flourished. It was an accidental gap, according to Beatty, "a little period 
between the loss of studio bullying and the advent . . . of heavy television 
marketing. . . . It was a period where you could make a movie that could grab 
the attention span of the public and not have to do it in a week. A picture 
would come out in a very small number of theaters, then move to greater number 
and by the time you got to (wide release), people had some understanding of the 
subject. . . . The period came to a close when people got serious about it and 
said, 'Hey, we've got to get some demographics, some research.' " 
</P>
<P>
The upshot: Today, movies are opened in 1,500 to 2,500 theaters, supported by 
massive TV ad campaigns, and the opening is like a presidential election. 
Studio executives know by Saturday morning whether a new release is going to be 
a hit or not, and can either yank their advertising to cut their losses or up 
their budgets to fan the fire. Movies that are difficult to sell don't have 
much of a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"They're like fast food hamburgers," Beatty said. "They sell a lot of them. The 
movie business is very successful and you hope that the success of those 
hamburgers will finance more original dishes. But more often than not, I'm 
afraid it just finances more hamburgers." 
</P>
<P>
Dinner wasn't on the schedule for this interview, but it got to be about 8:30 
and Beatty suggested we go out to Ginza Sushiko, a Japanese restaurant on 
Wilshire Boulevard. It is, he said, the most expensive restaurant in Los 
Angeles. He and Madonna had gone there recently and the bill came to about $450 
. . . at the sushi bar! 
</P>
<P>
"Would the Los Angeles Times think you were compromised if I took you there?" 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Not if I pick up the check." 
</P>
<P>
We ended up at the Mandarette Chinese Cafe on Melrose Avenue instead. (The 
check came to $56; it's on my expenses.) The Mandarette, an unpretentious 
corner restaurant featuring home-cooked Chinese food, is one of Beatty's 
frequent late-night haunts and neither the waiters nor the other diners paid 
much attention to us. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner subject, we decided, would be "Dick Tracy." The movie had barely 
come up during the first five hours, but we had just arrived at the restaurant 
when he got a telephone call from Madonna. She had just finished a concert in 
Toronto where she had performed under the threat of being arrested for lewdness 
and she called to tell him about it. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, the subject of gossip came up again and -- click! -- the tape recorder 
was turned off. There followed some marvelously ribald tales of the "here is 
what you might have read and here is what actually happened" variety. This was 
a double-feature for me; I hadn't even heard some of the rumors that the true 
stories were dispelling. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, sometime after 11, on the ride back to the studio and during 30 
minutes or so in the parking lot, we got around to discussing what he had in 
mind in making "Dick Tracy," a movie that -- whether you like it or not (and I 
do) -- will meet Pauline Kael's definition of a "piffle." 
</P>
<P>
"People had come to me over the years with 'Dick Tracy' wanting me to act in 
it. I could not imagine doing it because I didn't think I looked like Dick 
Tracy. Then I realized nobody looked like him, thank God, and that I could play 
him as well as anyone could." 
</P>
<P>
For a long time, "Dick Tracy" was in development at Universal where such 
directors as John Landis, Richard Benjamin and Walter Hill had been involved at 
one time or another. Landis got Beatty interested in it and years later -- with 
Landis out of the picture and Beatty in possession of the rights -- the project 
ended up at Disney. It was Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg and his 
boss, Michael Eisner, who had originally put "Dick Tracy" into development at 
Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
Beatty said he did not want to direct "Dick Tracy," and only decided to do it 
after being turned down by so many others, including Bob Fosse and Martin 
Scorsese. Scorsese had actually agreed to do it at one time, Beatty said, but 
he moved on to some other projects and lost interest. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, I just said, 'I've got to do this movie now and the way to do it is 
to just go ahead (and direct)." 
</P>
<P>
Without admitting that either instance was premeditated, Beatty said he got Al 
Pacino to play the part of Tracy's archenemy Big Boy the same way he got his 
friend Jack Nicholson to play Eugene O'Neill in "Reds": by asking them for 
their advice on who to cast. 
</P>
<P>
First, Nicholson: "I called Jack and said, 'I've got to get an actor to play 
Eugene O'Neill and it's got to be somebody who leaves not a shadow of a doubt 
that he could take Diane (Keaton) away from me.' He said, 'Well, you have no 
choice. There's only one person.' " 
</P>
<P>
Then Pacino: "I saw Al in a restaurant and I said I want to get somebody to 
play this part. 'Who's a good idea?' He said, 'Well, let me think about it.' He 
called me later in the day and said, 'What are you really thinking about? If 
you're really thinking that, why don't you just say it?' I said, 'Well, OK, I'm 
really thinking that.' He said, 'Then let's talk.' " 
</P>
<P>
Beatty doesn't spend a lot of energy trying to oversell "Dick Tracy." He said 
he did it for fun and it worked out that way. He talks about the fun of 
matching Madonna with Stephen Sondheim songs, of watching Al Pacino and the 
others chew up his comic book scenery, of the elegance that Dick Van Dyke, who 
plays Mayor Fletcher, brought to the set. 
</P>
<P>
But he may soon begin exercising his more serious side. There is that unnamed 
project dealing with unnamed social issues, and, of course, his long-planned 
biography of Howard Hughes, a man whose appetites for the company of famous 
women was, according to the gossip of his day, more than a match for the 
appetites of Warren Beatty, according to the gossip of his. 
</P>
<P>
How long can he wait? Beatty is 53 and the subject of rumors that even on "Dick 
Tracy" close-ups were reshot by his friendly director to make him look younger. 
Not true, he said. "You try to look as good as you can, I guess, but I didn't 
reshoot one close-up. I didn't reshoot anything on this picture." 
</P>
<P>
He said his physical condition has often been a point of attack. "When I was 
finishing 'Reds,' the story went out that I had gained 70 pounds in the cutting 
room. . . . I weigh the same now as when I played high school football. I think 
I'm in slightly better shape." 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Beatty isn't in a hurry to meet anyone's expectations except his 
own. Sorry, but this life belongs to him. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain things that had to get done by me and I did some of them. 
And there are certain things that I have to get done now and I hope I'll be 
able to do them. There are a lot of things in my life that have nothing to do 
with movies. . . . There's so much to do and only so much time to do it in." 
</P>
<P>
Or, to put it another way, so many women, so little . . . No, I promised.
